DAYS OF CRIME AND YEARS OF SUFFERING * AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. CHAPTER X. THE BITER IS BIT AND HE BITES AGAIN. On arriving at Maidstone I went to the Railway Inn, and remained there till the next morning. Not liking the house much, I re- moved in the course of the day to the Royal Hotel. As I always give the world a full account of my proceedings when I am doing others, it is only fair that I should be equally communicative when I get done myself. I affected billiards, and fancied I could play well. There was a billiard-room in the hotel, and to it I went on the evening after my arrival there. There was present a rather stylish-looking person, who introduced himself to me in the course of the night. He told me he was an officer in the Royal Artillery, and had recently invented some wonderful rocket, which he gave a very hard shine to, but which I forget. He invited me to play with him. I __________________________________________ * All rights of reproduction and of translation re- served. __________________________________________ did so, and won £5 from him that night, promising to meet him there the next evening. But I was not to be done in that manner. I knew it was a common practice among sharpers to allow the victim to win something at first, and as I had some slight idea that the artillery gentleman’s munitions of war were furnished chiefly by his wits, I was not going to be plucked so innocently as he imagined. I met him the next night, but declined playing, alleging as a reason that I had been suffering from a nervous attack all day. The officer seemed by no means disappointed, but entered into conversation in the most dégagé manner, and finally proposed to introduce me to a young lady to whom he was paying his ad- dresses. I accompanied him in a cab some two or three miles out of Maidstone, but where I know not, and we alighted at a little cottage, into the parlour of which we were immediately shown by the servant girl who opened the door. Nobody was there. In a few minutes a young lady, certainly not more than seventeen, made her appearance. I was introduced in the approved fashion—“ Miss Nelson, Mr, Hamilton—Mr. Hamilton, Miss Nelson.” I have never seen Miss Nelson since that evening, but I retain a most lively recollection of her. She was good-looking, could sing charmingly, and had the most fascinating manner imaginable. Wine was introduced, and although I drank only a couple of glasses, it had such an effect upon me that I found it impossible to keep my eyes open. Of the after events of that night I can remember but little. The next morning I awoke with a most splitting headache, and found myself in my own room in the Royal Hotel. I jumped out of my bed and dressed myself, and on ex- mining my pockets I found that I had been robbed of all my money except a solitary £10 note, which being in a separate pocket, had either escaped notice or been charitably left me by the thief. All thieves are dreadful bad losers. I was no exception to the rule, and I could have cried for very vexation. I rang the bell, and asked the waiter how I came home the previous night. He told me that I was brought to the hotel about one o’clock that morning ; that the gentleman who came with me in the cab said I had finished two bottles of claret, and was senselessly intoxicated ; that he and the gentleman had carried me upstairs, and that the gentleman gave him half a sovereign, telling him to undress me and get me into bed. Of course, I saw in a moment that it was a regular “ diamond-cut-diamond” affair, and as talking would not bring my money back, I said nothing of my loss. I have seen the “ military officer” since then. We worked together in chains in the same cart some few years ago, and I only re- cognised him by his telling the story of the “ young swell at Maidstone” for the especial edification of myself and the other cart parties. Having been so completely cleaned out, it behoved me to buckle to at once to replenish my empty pockets, and as my funds would not admit of any lengthy finessing schemes, I was compelled to commence immediate opera- tions. That very day, with the zeal of ancient Strabo, I made myself completely master of the geography of the place, and before night I not only knew how all the rooms were situated, but had made myself pretty well acquainted with the sort of people by whom they were tenanted. I know enough that it is quite common for a well-dressed thief to take apart- ments in an hotel and “ barber” all the in- mates ; in other words, to get up in the night, visit all the rooms, and steal as much as pos- sible. This, in technical language, is called “ Dancing a lushing-drum.” Philosophers de- fine instinct as “ knowledge prior to exper- ence,” and as I certainly at that time was wholly without experience in such matters, I must have been under the guidance of the in- stinctive faculty. I didn’t go to bed that night, but merely lay outside the bed reading. The book was of a moral and religious character, but it failed to influence me with its arguments. By one o’clock the house was silent, and out I glided like a ghost. I felt a little nervous on entering the first room ; but, despite the model system, I have been remarkable for good nerves on many a trying occasion, and on this first essay in the “ dancing” line I was soon as cool as a cucumber. It would be dull work telling how I searched the clothes, made my way to the dressing-table, pocketed purses, watches, chains, gold pins, and other little articles that would produce “ money, and money in any way.” I visited four rooms, and then thought it time to return to my own. The next bedroom to that in which I slept was unoccupied, and with the pocket- handkerchief of a commercial gentleman whom I had somwhat extensively fleeced, I tied all the watches, purses. &c.;, to- gether, entered the empty bedroom, and placed them safely out of sight on a ledge up the chimney, keeping out a few sovereigns for my immediate use. Having done this in a neat and workmanlike manner, I retired to bed. At eight o’clock I jumped out of bed, slipped on my trousers, and then rang the bell violently. A waiter very soon appeared. “ Tell the landlord I want him ; fetch the police, I have been robbed in the night. Twenty-three pounds and a promissory note for thirteen, my studs and my pocket-book, all gone. Who can have done it ?” The waiter didn’t let me get to the end of my sentence, for he ran to the landing and called out, “ Here’s No. 7 has been served the same.” Up came the landlord. He said he was sorry in the extreme ; he couldn’t conceive how the thing could have been done. No loss had ever been experienced in his house before. He was sorry, very sorry. The police had been sent for to investigate the matter, and he hoped they would succeed in tracing the robber. Four other gentlemen had been robbed also. The inspector of police came shortly after- wards, and looked into the rooms, and under the beds, as if he thought the thief might have taken a fancy to have a nap there, asked a variety of questions, took an inventory of the property lost, and then went away, shaking his head and looking remarkably wise. I remained at the hotel a week gratis, for as no funds had arrived for me I told the landlord I should be forced to leave my bill unsettled. Under the circumstances the land- lord of course could not reasonably demur, and at the week’s end I left Maidstone, and proceeded by the coach to Chatham. I need scarcely observe that I had during the week removed the “ goods and chattels” from the chimney ledge, and conveyed them to Chatham, without any fear of consequences. Suspicion fell upon the “ military gentleman,” for although not in the house on the night in question, he was well acquainted with the premises, and his sudden disappearance was unaccountable, otherwise than by connecting him with the robbery. Thus was my own safety secured, and I at the same time “ grati- fied a double grudge ” — against the world and against my particular antagonist. The money result of my night’s foray amounted to some forty odd pounds — just sufficient to keep me going while I struck out some fresh scheme for victimising the world.
