More than over beforeo, since i tar began, the fito of the Confederacy tIhe prospects of peace seem to hang on issue of tihe next great battle. It is ng the possibilities that the collision nmay e and pass, and neither party be ftially ';.ted by it. Should the armies of Grant Loo, Thomas and Johnston meeoot and \- result be no victory for the Union, while ould. produce groat political commotion perhaps, pitch overboard somo otlicors 4csooem to stand firmly on their foot now, :no one dreauns that in the worst inuagi Jlo event the govermnment would retreat ?c its determination to fight tihe thing 1ughI to final success, o, that if the go muiont flteorod, the people would not givvo administration its walking plapers, and ilaco it with a firmer ancd still more war , Olle. ocssibly we have not allowed onough for pluck and Ondurance of the robols-pos ily the loss of Ricihmond and of the interior C'oorgia would not causee tho Confodoricy toll its belly up towards thoe sn and give Stho ghost. 'The Confdoracy is a monster Ilong governments, and it is exceedingly .icult when you catch it fish, the likeoof cich never beooro swaam, to toll whore its tiit of life is. lTnis anomalous concern which, starling and never forsaking its faith in slavery as Idivino institution, yet with slavery it putri g corpso at its foot, fights now for tho arsonal liberty of its loaders, has certainly 1striitgo tonacity of lifo. A higlly organ iod animal gonornlly (lies whon its heart is eiorcod-this concern moro resembles tlat |aosios of tortoise whose jaws srnp maliciously vion after its heart is chopped lino and is jino with its tendorer parts to swell the impleo proportion of some fat alderman. ltt ovon the snapping-turtlo abates Ihis igour and gives up trying to live when you 'Elvo turned all his Ilush into soup aid founded his lhad liat. That is what Grant Spreparing to do, and what lie is oxpected do to' tho Confbdoraey as tho season ilvancos. No one in the country has iudied more practically the strength uind oaknoss of the Confederacy than Grant. HIo lnows what limbs are already dond, whiiat oed one more stab to paralyso them, to ihat quarters the vitality is lied, and bo Col on what ribs to strike to reach and spill H. o in has boundless resources of men and "naatorials to do his work with. It would be ,io strango thing if by the fourth of July teo war wore substantially ended. Ofcourse t cannot be unless the campaigns now organising are succossful, and as no mortal Ias powor to predict the issues of oven the most promising compaign, and as the event ovfery battle depends more or loss upon intflunces beyond humani control, thoro is anl uiitnsual nervousness felt as to the event es Jocially of the noet Virginia innimlpign. i Banks' set-back on the Red Rivor was a Svory serious thing for the General com iianlding, and its cost was gruat in lives and munitions of war. Any defeat is sincerely to be regrotted, yet the success of Banks' expedition to Texas, however desirable, is not vital. It was undertakon rather as a siupplement to last . year's progranmmo-a |concluding essay of the anaconda policy tlan a s any portion of this spring's plan, which aims at the centre to stab rather than by winding around the circumforonco to crush. Nor is it yet settled, bid as our' men woro handled thoro, that the rebels did not sufllr about as much; nor that Banks' oxpedition is moro tltan temporarily chocked. The robols fool the necessity of some de monstration in North Carolina. Governor Vanco not only fears the consequence of por mitting the eon of his State to moot in con vontion, but dare not oven allow the Logis latur oan extra session lost tie reprosonta tivos of the' people bolt from the Cotn foderany.. rThe, prospect of mongro crops, throats of instant starvation, oxorbitant prides, and an utter disgust with Jeff Davis' tyramny and the war that has come of it, .minlo North Caroliii a broken bono in the sido of the Confederacy. Satisfied tlat slho will not bo quiet unless thoro is some show of relief for her, the robols lately made a des po?ato effort to expel the Union troops from near, the mouth of the oRonoko river, but woro ropulsed with great slaughtor. Thoe Governmonts of tlh loyal Westorn 'Border States are taking stops to defend "thoi .fotrritory fromi the inroads of sulch 'raidstors as Forrost. Thoy propose a plan .which will call off none of the veterans iieededint the groat armies of Grant. They ask the Presidont to call out 100,000 volun 'itis 'fromi tihoi States. "Whether complied with or not, the request shows a grictifying disposition on the part of the States to leave tlioir' d6tdirins whero tlio greatest nood of thomn is, and to defond by other moans their homes threatoneod with invasion. On ,the whole; though. no unmistakablo mioveimont tdward a collision has yet boon d'iidao iiiVirginia, there is renewed activity along atllour lines, and thoero are abundant symptoms that the gioat anud bloody struggle on whic'sb' miuch.doponds is hot' long to be postponed. r i'Tho'following are the united press telo graims from the seat of war, -which we quote -hiiio lyfromi the Woekly Bullotin:- ;OumIAoo, April 15.

Ilhe inauguration xeircises of the Mary land Sanitary Fair last night wore very im posing. President Lincoln waspresent, and, in 'esponse to repeated calls, madoe a brief address.

When hlo alluded to the massacro at Fort Pillow, he said many sup posed the government did not intend to do its duty in regard to the protection of colored soldiers. lie desired to say that all such were mistaken. Whlenthe question respect ing colored men as soldiers was left to the government, it rested very much with him self whether he should mako soldiers of them or not. 1ie pondered the matter care fidly, and when lie becatne convinced that it was his duty to employ them, he did not hesitato. loe stood before- the Amorican people 'responsible for the act-responsible before the Christian world-and should stanid responsible in the eye of the historian. 1Ho did not shrink from it; lie hesitated not. lie declared that the governmoiit would pro tect them the same as white soldiers, whon over a cleai and authenticated case was made out. ' Hitherto it had boon dillicult to ascortain with certainty what the govern ment's decision in a matter so serious should be. But in the Fort Pillow affair ho thought we wore likeoly to find a clear case.' When government does know the facts from official sources, and should they substantiato the reports, retribution will be surely given. The President's remarks wore warmly ap plauded, and especially his determination to retaliate for the barbarous deeds of the roebels. Tho Herald's Washington deslpatches stato that Grant will appoint lMc Clellan to a command in the army of the Potomac. Washington splcial'despatches say that it is reported that Gilmore has beenr clieved froen the command at Charleston, and has been ordered to service elsewhere.

Nothing, however, of reliable infor mnation has been recoived. Tho presence of a considerabloe reliol cavalry force near Lees burg has induced measures to be taken to check an advance, should it be attempted. It is roprosonted that Goenral Grant las decided to send to the front suchl mon of the invalid corps as are able to boar arms, and return to their homes those disabled from active service in the field. Information has been received that a largo body of rebel cavalry, supposed to be from the main army, woro at Leesburg and the vicinity, seizing forago, teams, and taking thlm olf towards Upporvillo. Colonel Lowoll immediately started with a brigade of cavalry from Vienna, supported by General Tylor's brigado of infantry, from Fairfax court house to give them battlo. Hodge's robol brigado attackled Colonel Gillospio's force at Painsvillo, on Tuesday last, but was repulsed. Gillespio pursued the retreating rebels with 800 men of the 1lth and 3'Jth regiments, and surprised them on the i1-th in camp, at Half IMountain, capturing 70 prisoners, 200 horses, 400 sad dles, 300 stand of arms, and all their camp equiplgo. 85 rebels were killed or wounded. Privato letters have boon received from Red ivor-ono dated Grand Ecoro, tho 10th, and another Alexandria, the 12th-stating that the army under General Banks mol with reverses on the 8th, near Mansfield. Our army fell back, and on the next day the robols attacked them and woro handsomely whipped, the loss being boavy on both sides. An Alexandria letter of the 9tli says tih rebels are burning all the cotton on the Rod Rivor and Ouaclohta. W?ASnIKOTON, April 20. In the Senate, yesterday, the bill to repeal the fugitive slave law was amended by ac cepting the Act of1795. A motion to.table was lost. PJIILAIDEPIIIA, April 24. The Enquirer says that rebel deserters who have arrived at Washington state that Loo's force on the Rapidan is 60,000. Longstreeot was at Charlottesville, marching toward Stanuton, for the purpose of advanc ing down the Shenandoah Valley. Lee's army has received seven days' rations for a forward movemoent. Theo. following information has been re coived from the army of the Potomac :--Fivo deserters of the 45th Virginia rebel regiment came into our lines yesterday. It is posi tively ascortained that Longstroot's army is at Orange court-house. Leo's entire forces are not more than 45,000 or 50,000 strong. The rebels are vigilant, strictly forbidding their pickets to hold conununication with ours. OAcno, April 21. Tho naval despatch-boat General Lyon, from Red River, has arrived, and we' have theo following in regard to affairs in Banks'. department :-The fight of the 8th was at Sabine Creoss Ruoads. The rebels are said to havo numbered 35,000, from Texas, Louisi ana, Arkansas, and Missouri. On the morn ing of the 8th, General Banks sent forward a cavalry force, with a supply train, of 100 waggons, to Natchitoches.

"The com mander of the cavalry thought the i'ebel force small, and sent a message to General Banks to that effect, but asked for reinforce ments, Ransom's division was sent forward by brigades, which were successively do foated, by placing themselves between the rebls, who were on both sides of the road, and closed in on one bofore the other could come up. The enemy took the supply trains, and killed and wounded a large number. They took many prisoners and threw the re mainder into confusion, so that they retreated rapidly, the rebels in hot pursuit. As they approached General Smith's forces, which were drawn up in line of battle, the latter opened his lines and lot the fleeing troops pass before the enemy came up. He then closed his lines and prevented further chase, driving the enemy back. The noxt morning General Smith attacked the noemy under KIiiby Smith, Dick Taylor, Magruder and Holmes, defeating them badly and driving them back. The Federals took a large numibor of prisoners, and killed arid wounded more than the rebels did the day before. The fighting was desperate. General Smith is considered to have saved the whole army.

The next day we occu pied the 'place without resistance. Our forces'here divided, one detachment crossing the rirer and the other reconnoitering this side. The enemy were found some distance from : Mount' Elba,' having been :roinforced and advancing on our forces. Hasty pro parations for their reception were made by extemporising fortifications of' logs 'rails, anu cottonbales. The enemy charged three times, and each time were repulsed. - They finally retired after six hours' vain effort to dislodge us. Our forces then charged on themr, scatterino them in all directions. In this and the engagement at Branchville we killed eighty-four, wounded 350, and cap tured fifty.
