j. FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM. 'HY ¥OQQY f. i.. Dear reader, ore yougtfnfö? and if you be, Tell tte Ik*dfá truths 'did :evet you get 'drtinkT * Which, did you ^o-^-to Bed, or bu fe spree ? Hoglike were yon in some hole snoring slunk,- "-. . - . Or raving round that eyery one might see How far yon were degraded, ruined, sunk. In either case/ you sobered someJsrhere-^-well, Tou need no ghost to tell you there's a hell. ir. Tou sobered, and were sick, and you were grieved Because you were aptj§ck enough to die. Restoratives your body's pain repefed, But no restorative could th^^aj>ply To soothe your spirit, whlärhäd just received A wound to rankle wneresoe'er you fly, And haply drive you, maddened by the pain, To drink, and to be wounded o'er again. m. It is a curious fact, that dull or bad men In general can drink upon the sly ; 'Tis honest, talented, warm-hearted mad men That play the devil in the public eye, And in one night make cause to keep them sad men From that night forward till the night they die; And know, ye moralists, there's little use in all Your lecturing-the disease is constitutional iv. And lhere is but one cure in all the world Effectual-that is Total Abstinence. Man knows not when, where, how he may be whirled r. Out of.the.orbit of bis common.sense; Arid from the heights of genios, -virtue hurled Beneath the feet bf worthless consequence, The veriest two-legged poppy, he or she, Stents, barking o'er the tool of one night's spree. - v They're very few in number who cali drink Like gentlemen, auH. stall be^a^tts mentes ; Pity warm friendship leads to^r^Vbrink That follies ^ sent is, HowgteiSjt pity that thW brak^oldd wink ' JiÄtJwffen tbe heâft oá char#jnápst bent is, For social spirits pity's still in sfot^' But none for those who swill behj^d the door.

O, you unmarried women, watch and pray Yours be it never to unite your lot With one who may become some future day A raving madman or a drivelling sot. Mind, person, rank, and riches, what are they, When love that feels, and grace that guides, are not? Wed to a husband you cannot respect, You'll find your every hope in Ufe is wrecked. VIII. Pat travelled on, and travelled on far, far, Turther than either you or I can tel!, Upon his lone path shone no guiding star; He felt a shivering, he was far from well, He sought for comfort at the bar, And he succeeded to a miracle. He chuckled to himself, and thought it odd he Had ever suffered pain of mind or body. ix. On board a steam-boat he became notorious, Treating sb many friends he ne'er had known ; Down at the steam-boat-bar hegrew uprorious, Some disrespect was towards his country shown. But when upon the railroad-over glorious Out of the car he was going to be thrown. How far degraded is the finest fellow, Who has the bad luck to get over-mellow ! The cars stopped, at the depot ; he got out Men sometimes when the drunkest stagger 1 least There in a bar-room he began to spout Collihs's Ode and Alexander's Feast ; He spouted Latin, too, which raised a doubt, Or certainly that he must be a Priest. Four honest Paddies seized him by the limbs, And bore him, struggling, off to Father JimV. XI. He fooled, slept, and awoke ; flush after flush . Over his memory shot the horrid past; He jumped, and would have acted something rash, ' Stay there he would not, and the door was fast. But now he thought creation gave a crash, \- Back to the wall the door was sudden cast; And à rich, manly, playful voice exclaimed «* Well, If you ain't a nice one, Fll be blamed.^ xn. It was the Priest-Pat looked, and in bim saw, A clever, dashing man, still in his prime ; At onee mspiring conudence and awe Strangely familiar, startlingly sublime. Life and its cares, he valued not a, straw, But floated cheerful down the stream of tune j. And, as he boated, cast upon tile wave, The bread to nourish, and the plank to ¿ave. . . ' . XITJ.
