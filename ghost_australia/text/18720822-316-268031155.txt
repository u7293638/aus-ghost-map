HAVE YOU SEEN" THE GHOST ? (Tp ihe JZditor of Hie GippsTand Merewg): Sir,â€”The Avon Shire -is -haunted hy the ghost of a cheque whicb nxpirad five or six yeara ago. Somc folks in 1st that it did not die, but: tfaat- it : was .cru-Uy confined in a tdrawerin theOoimcil cba ubers. I am not a business man. but ] bave been-talking to one or two business man about the matter, and t&is; is what they tell A cheque -waa drawn - in favour .of. a -pera in.,-- Tha amount: was, , of course, entered-a a the credit side of the cash-book- Xhe pera in whose favour it was -drawn would sot have it. Conseqaently it was afterwards entered ton the debit side of tbe book. Now, I say that that entry took away the life of the -cheque- Ths amount having appeared on both aidoa of thB bode, it was disposed of, and:; the cheque having expired, ought to have been subjected to tlie process of incremation. 1. wonder whether the Council would let me have the cheque for the ten pounds odd, if aol would .{ay the ghost in the bank. .
