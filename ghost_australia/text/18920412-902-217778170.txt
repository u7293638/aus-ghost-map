r - Poetry. BROKEN HEARTS. Pale ghosts of a passionate past come thronging, r The feverish folly, the fierce embrace,, . The vague unrest and the ceaseless longing, . The last wild" kiss on an upturned face ; Of ft heart that cried:, and that broke in crying, : Of bitter sorrow and blinding tears, -When bops lay dead and when, love lay dying, . And all the folly of bygone years. Bnt now how we smile at the fond love token — \- And laugh at the sweet words whispered low, We,- whose hearts have been broken, broxen, . Broken ever so long ago. . Wlia hearts that beat in this great sad city, . ' - That sorrow m vain for a lost delight ; Ah l yet we hear, with a wondering jnty, Thelstifle-d sob in. the lone, dark night. Wonld-ye were even as we are — sorrow ... Should strike its hardest, but never again _ Would " the sad heart break for a hopeless morrow, . Or the face grow weary and- white from pam. Ob. calm, like gods, on a woTld of woe— We,' whose hearts have been broken,, broken, Broken ever so long ago, -- - : At the merry feast, in the light talk af tar,- In .dreamy maze of the sensuous valse, . Doesever a sob break thronghjtbe laughter! " Does ever a jarring note rmwfalse 7 Who carries their burden of life- so lightly ! -.Who dons so gayly the jester's gaise 1 Who.langhs so loudly as we, who nightly Ik>ok laughing back into laughing eyes ? -Drink deep, langh loud,- and dance for a tokeD ; Tour hearts are merry," and none will kp'ff.
