Venezuela. . It will be remembered that soon after that Venezuela troubio aroBo, our. dear Cousin Jonathan toob it in band and appointed a committee to settle it right away. There wan just tho ghost of a suspicion tli.it Jonathan would havo all his work before him, oven if allowed to go at it, and to do it in his own way. No hints, no remonstrances sufficed to oheck his ardour, or to cool bis natural courage. But his first progress roport is uncommonly liko a report of no progress at all. The text of tho cor respondence up to date was published in July ; but so far tho parties had not pro gressed beyond showing a more friendly spirit. Porhaps tho most ustounding part of tho information disclosed is thut Jonathan has not, at present, tho necessary data for a settlement- of the question in dispute. Ho relied upon having cosy acecss to the country itself, and to tho readiness with which a Venezuelan would swear to anything required of it. Reports say that the task of sifting out the truth from old maps and grants and charters has been " oven more arduous than wns anticipated." This is not saying very muoh, because the certainty is that Jonathan did not think it would bo au arduous tusk; so thut its being " even mure arduous " would not surprise anyone. Truth to tell, howevor, Jonathan finds that ho must send a commissioner to the Vatican, Madrid, and the Hague to study archives there. The settlement by Jonathan ounnot, thorefnre, take place during President Cleveland's reign; und he may ho glad to escape from tho diffioult situation by passing out of office.
