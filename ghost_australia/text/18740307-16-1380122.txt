LONG ODDS. BY MARCUS CLARKE. CHAPTER XVIII. E) WHICH BOB THINKS ABOUT RETURNING TO AUSTRALIA. Ten days 'lagged drearily at Matcham. A gloom seemed to have fallen on the old house. The winter sun looked coldly down upon the shivering trees in the park, and the winter wind wailed round about the quaint gables?, and whirled the withered leaves hither and thither at will. Saville Chatteris still preserved a decent outward show of dignity, but his heart was sore within him. It is not a pleasant thing for an old man who has worshipped Mammon and Society all his life long to find that his days was barren and joyless, and that grim death draws nearer and nearer day by day. Yet the old man was gradually confessing to himself that his life had been a mistake. He had heaped up for himself no riches of affection or honor, and the moth and rust of civil law and society were corrupting the sordid treasures of worldly respect that he had toiled for so long and so earnestly. The death of his firstborn weighed heavy on him. The good name of the Chatters family had been the idol of his life and his second son had, in his father's eyes, disgraced that good name for ever. Cyril Chatteris, whatever he might be to the world, was to his father a dishonest and dis- honored man. The skeleton had been hidden, it is true, had been wrapped up and put away in a doubly-locked closet, and its ghastly bones covered with the sweet-smelling herbs of repentance and promise of amendment. But it was there nevertheless. The accounts of his son's doings had not been cheering. That good fellow, Dare, who had been instructed by Mr. Saville Chattel-is with the task of steering Cyril's back through the shoals and quicksands of youth, wrote diligently of his proteges progress is but the letters were not satisfactory. They did not report any now crime, or any glaring dereliction from social virtue, but they were utterly barren of all positive good news. Cyril had not done any of the things he ought not to have done, but it seemed from Mr. Dnere's elegantly worded epistles, that he had left undone many of those things that he ought to have done. Cyril seems to have become a determined misanthrope," wrote the kind secretary. " He is seldom seen in good houses now, and though I am bound to say, my dear sir, that I have never by any chance heard of him save as a perfectly gentlemanly, and even rising and clever, young man, still you, Sir, who know the world so well, cannot but feel somewhat annoyed at your son voluntarily absenting himself from that society which his father's position, and his own abilities, so well qualify him to ornament. I have frequently urged upon him the necessity for establishing his position ; but he rejects my advice, and seems, I regret to say, to lean towards that Bohemian world which destroys so many young men of promise, and which, though necessary no doubt, is scarcely the sphere in which your son should move. This letter, written by Mr. Dacre the morning after an " opera supper," at which he had been the presiding genius, was but an echo of many that were read and deplored over in silence by the late charge d'affaires at Kruiumelhoü'. The sun of the Chatters family threatened to set in Bohemian midnight, and the heart of its Head Was heavy at the prospect. "If Fred had only lived, this would not have happened," said the old man to himself. Fred had been all that he could desire hand- some, honorable, debentures, and an ornament to Society ; moreover, the old man fancied that the dashing dragoon might have " ranged himself " after a year or so and made Kato the partner in such ranging. Now Fred was gone, Cyril was disgraced, and Kate was losing her good looks. Poor Kate ! First love is a very pleasant thing for poets to write about, but it is not so utterly without alloy as they would have us imagine. The jealousies, the heartburnings, the fevers of expectation, the sickness of hope deferred the pleasures and the twins which go to make up that bitter-sweet that men call love are pleasant to look back on but I question much if, at the time, we are so violently happy is the poets would have us. Perhaps we remember only the sweet, and forget the bitter. It may be so ; but hopeless love is the only real love after all. Alas ! ive burn, ive groan, we toss, and cry aloud ; we sonnets, and make our lives burdens to us for the love of one fair face. Fortune is kind, perchance ; the soft eyes smile upon us alone, the sweet lips murmur love words for our ears only and to ! we find the fruit but ashes in the mouth ; the violet eyes are but common gray after all the exquisite love songs but childish prattle and we go down to our deaths with the ghost of another memory haunt, ing iv. We cannot animate the dry bones, our dead loves will not live for us again ; perhaps it is better that they should not. Kate was in love. It is a remarkable fact, and one which explains much human misery, that women have a predilection for forming passionate . attachments to men who are in every way unworthy of them. In some few instances their love is so violent that it blinds their eyes for longer than the usual period of married kitten hood in most cases, however, they speedily find that their idols are but common clay, and their relief must be to loathe them." A marriage such as this must be a bondage indeed ; but the women slaves work well, and the social Pharaoh hardens his heart, and " will not let the people go." What a curious farce it is that we are playing, and how glad some of us will be when the euratha falls, and we can wash the paint from our faces and go Home ! Kate thought that she was in love with her cousin. He was in disgrace, she guessed in trouble of some kind, she knew ; he had told her that he loved her, and he was unhappy-all excellent reasons for giving her heart away. Moreover, the beloved object was far away, and this circumstance invested him with numerous qualities that were not his own, but belonged properly to Lancelot, and Sterford, and d'Arta gan, and Mr. Carlyle, and other heroes of those modern days. So Kate loved in silence, and set up a graven image for herself, and worshipped it duly ; all unwitting that another young man was rapidly fashioning her own likeness into that of a goddess, and was, in his turn, bowing down before it. This young idolators was Mr. Bob Calverly. That young Australian had commenced to economise, but had not got with the task as well as he had expected. He had fulfilled his threat of " cutting the concern," and had presented himself at the Hall in the character of a sports- man. There was plenty of fun at sturdy old Sir Val's place in the winter season. The usual complement of London dandies, eager for the slaughter of game and the hunting of foxes ; the usual complement of pretty) girls, who dressed in the latest fashion of the Ruo Breda, and talked like a decoction of Shaftesbury and water, the usual mixture of matchmaking mothers, husband hunting daughters, "jolly fellows, and "their) fellow, and clever fellows,' and fellows who had written books you know, and fellows who travelled, did all that sort of thing in fact, fellows of di kinds and species but one As Pottnonbj often declared, " I like going to looks plate, because you never meet all) 'stuck up fellows there, you know, which was fine 'The Hall was a place for polite) and rexellmg-nl\\\a)s within the limits of becoming north Into tins genial atmosphere had the young Australian dropped, but he was not so well disposed to cure) it as heretofore In the first place, he was in debt, not to any great extent certainly, but enough to make him anxious con coming mails, and economical m personal ex- penditure He had paid off his I O U 's by the assistance of Ducie and his fncudMi Charles Ryle, but he did not quite see how Mr Charles Ryley himself was to be paid The expected remittances had not aimed, and Messrs Pack and Greece were inexorable So Bob went down to the Hall, mil hunted three times a week, and made all sorts of good i resolutions touching economy, and g unhung, and borrowing money Moi cot or, for the first time in his life, he was in love From the moment when late, crucen j and benignant had swept in from the terrace at Matcham, Mr Robert G dvcilj wits more He confessed to himself that in a hive was hoped that such a goddess is Chattel ia cousin would never look upon a i ongle, uncouth fellow, like unselfish fellow who was married to driving looms, md who always turned over ' music four bars too soon He remembered bon silent he used to sit on those occasions when he was a guest at Matcham and how Lord) Loughborough snubbed him, and how the courteous host, after nil) attempting to discuss the Schleswig Holstein question, would say, with a weary) smile, "Au) more wine ?
