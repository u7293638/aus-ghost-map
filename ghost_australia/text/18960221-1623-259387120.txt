FIRE AND SJN'AKES. An incident of the recent forest fires in the Pine creek region is related by Sam Campbell, who works in the woods near Blackwell's. Saai was one, of the crew of men sent out to " back fire " (tight lire with fire), and he declares thattheir experience was most thrilling. While setting fire to a thicket that crowned a rocky ridge, he and his crew were startled to find themselves suddenly in the midst of a lot of rattlesnakes. The forest fire was advancing up the side of the hill at a rapid rate. Its whistling, whining sound as it devoured the hemlock tops was terrific, and the men were bent on building a line of fire to start toward it, hoping that when the two linos met the fury of the flames would be subdued lor lack of material on which to feed. It was while thus employed that they encountered the snakes. The ground seemed to be literally alive with rattlers, the reptiles crawling in the direction of a rocky hi tiff not more than one hundred yards distant. The men were all equipped with high-topped leather boots and paid little heed to the snakes, stepping on them as though they were but harmless old sticks. Campbell says that tho rattling made by tho reptiles could bo heard above the roar of the distant flames. The " backfire " made by the men caught dozens of crawh is and they were burned to death. Campbell said hc watched several of the rattlers " give up the ghost." When the flames advanced so close that the snakes saw further escape was impossible they would coil up in a heap, darting their heads angrily at the tongues of flame, then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them, a moment later to be devoured.
