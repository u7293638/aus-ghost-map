A LONG YEAR. It is over 29 years since since we were able to view Saturn in perihelion before, and that is the length of a Saturoian year. While in perihelion ho is under certain conditions nearest the earth, and under circumstances most favorablo to scicntific observation. His journey around tho sun of 9,000,000,000 miles covers almost a generation of the lives of the men and women of this planet, aud when he maltes each fresh appearanco with his present distinctness, it is an event indeed. The science of astronomy is enlarging as constantly and as rapidly as any other science, and tho observations that astronomers will now be able to take of the splendid planet under its present favorable conditions, ought to add much to the information concerning it,andcertainlynoneof the heavenly bodios has inspired more eager or intelligent research than tho one whose return we celebrate. But what a journey is made by - this luminary, whoso mean distance from the sun is 881,000,000 miles, or more than nine times the distance of tho earth. If it has a race of beings fitted to exist at such a distance from the source of heat and light, what lengthy seasons they must en joy. * Under such conditions there would be some satisfaction iu having a cottage or a mountain chalet, for what they would call their heated term would extend over a number of years. But the fact is a hundred millions of miles or sn make very little difference in those almost unimaginable distances. Probably distance lends enchantment to the view. But when our earth is dead, then Saturn and tho other great planotB in tho course of some millions of years will take their turn in physical development, and perhaps in some countless ages hence the wandering ghosts that have vanished from the earth will reappear in new forms of life upon the yet imperfect, but magnificent world rolling in space and waiting for its day to dawn.-â€” Providtnoe Journal.
