"FOUNDED ON FACT. BY T. MALCOLM WATSON. I had written a novel which, I may say wihout affectation, had boon received, aliko by the public, and the preos, with marked favour.. Possibly the generous reception. xtgiided to it niay, in some measuroe, have boon the result of my own frankness in at once" acknowledging the source fron whlich I ihad drawn my Inspi . ration. Nevertheless, Ilan, Ithick, jUs. tified in saying that'the book owed its. succesa less to the intricacy of its plot than to the adroit manner in which the incidents were handled, and, above all, to the subtle analysis of a msind gifted beyond the common. TIle,volumee has boon so recently in the, hands of readers, and by, them so fJlly" discussed, GthlatIh.fecl- a unot en? .?i di i "doncoâ€¢in-r e 'rrii'g f t l 9-if er '7i" thing like detail. If there is one thiing dislike more than another, it is the thrust;" ing of my own personality before the" public. But, unfortunately, I have no option in the present instance; I have given asolemn pIledge under circumstances of peculiar gravity, and the responsibility rostingon me until that pledge is redeemed cannot readily be over-estimated. I have -unwittingly, it is true--perpetrated a serious wrong against a follow-creature, and the only inethod open to .me of un. doing tllo'ovil.thus wrought is to make my recantation. no less public. than the .error which renders it necessary. . .Although, thoerefore, I do not feel called upon to enter with any degree of minute. nesa into the particulars of my story-a task particularly distasteful toone of my modest disposition-I am forced to call to the reader's memory one or tivo of the leading events sot forth in its piages. It will bo remembered that in the preface I at once, as I have said, 'disharmed hostile crificism on the score of originality by can didly daclaring the basis of my tale to be tihe account of a certain trial for murder, which I had uneartlhed fronc an old news paper. It would, however, be unfair to my own share in the work did I not add that thlodetails there given vwore of the most eaongro kind-a veritable skeleton in fact fromnt which not only every vestige of flesh had long sinesoo disappeoared, bua which, diuring those years of sopulture, had lost a goodly numbor of. its original bonses; and among those many of its most important.. To. me, then, fell the tiask of rehabilitating thisticno-worn structuro--of clothing it agaicn, nso .to speak,:'.with its former wrappings-and of imparting. to it such vitality as might prove acceoptable to the public of the present day.. -- " The newspaper report to which Iliavo alluded was. short and to many inight seem prosaic. It told ici conciso laniiguage io' a certain Benjamin North Ihad been stried and convictdd'of the murder of his .wife, Hypatia, which crime no doubt, althoegh the fact remained unrecorded, he in dci -course expiated on the., scaffoldi. Thle evidenco went to: show, that for ?inany years.previohs to.theircmcucriage tis union .of.,tloase5oulcsl-.obseclocn ed.uloljtedoit a *probable, and that only a series of malign influences .ihad- prevented the "consumn mation of thleir hopes at an eaTrlior priod. Their happiness, howover,'was fated to be of brief dunration. - Shortly after the. wedding, Ilypatia-no longor, be it said, in the firstbloom of heryouith-delvelopcd symptoms of ill-lhcalth. The circumstance . did not pass unobserved by liher husband, in whose favour it was urged at the trial that no one could have dmsplnyed greater patience or devotion. The haunts of her earlier days were forsaken, and old friends saw almost nothing of their former corn rade. On tho-raro occasion which found hint absoitt from his Wife's side it wias ap parent, nmorover, that he had changed grcatly. .' His manner was. moro serious and at times oven depressed. A certain gloosm lhid settled upon his faco, 'ancd his very gait betrayed ae mind ' anxiois and. haranssed. The sudden deatl of his wife followed' soon after. . Of its cause.theor never was the slightest doubt: a day or two pro-e viously.North had purchased a quantity *of arsenic with the oestonsiblo purpose of giving it to his horaos to iinprove the itp, pearnceo of their coats. It wass clearly proved, aid indeed was never denied, thlat his wifo'a'death lied resulted from a. dose of this very poison. Tihe defence hppears to have boon con ducted'on the most primitive loins. , A plea certainly, was advanced that the woman had, either by ccildent or design, taken the arsonicherself; .lut. as no ovi-. dence was adduced in support of the as sortion, the man's cease quickly fell to the ground.. Nor, from nwhat I could gather, did the result cause hiit. either surprise or uneasiness. . Like the Greeks of old, le seemed to see in his approaching doom the hand of fate from which no miortal aid could save him. Such was the frainovwork upon which I had avowedly built up my story, carry ing candour even so far as to give chapter and verse for iy autlhority. And althoigh. it may, at first glance, be thiought that the narrative contained little either of an extraordinary or sensational nature, to me thororwas much both keenly pathetic and dramatic in it. I conjured uli tlhe early struggles of. these Idving hearts. the long, slow years of waiting until their hopes at last should be crowned with fruition. In Hypatia I re cognised a woman of a trusting and loyal disposition ; in North a man of lofty, if sonmwhlat self-contained, charncter. And towanrds these two, just as the cup of happiness was raised to their lips, the hand of death cwas soon to stretch forth, and the inoevitable end to approach. That North was convinced of lis wife's near dissolution I had no doubt, and that he felt the coming separation even more acutely than herself was no less clea- to smo. And so hle had taken his determine. tion. If they mnight no longer live to. getlher, death at least should .not iart thoim. Imbued with this rd?slvoi holsad purchased tie poisoec, intending'to mcak away with botlh hIis wifo andh-limsaolf. But, after admincistericg hier pdrtioa~ his nerve had failed him ; and beforie ho could, sunimon up courage sullfcient to'coiijplets Ihis purpose, juatoo was on lhias tracmk. Neverthleless, when his fate came, hle met it calmly andheroically, consciousi that if he had sinned in act he was at least innoedont ie intention. The character of the man lied grown upion me with wonderful vividness, aid I hlad taken the greatest pains to portray thle ciotives by whilch eo- had been animated, The success of tihe book may be accepted as some iisdication that nmy efforts were not wholly in van. : 'Some forw wceeks aftoir its publlcntion I nas sitting one evonine c alonoei niy study,' It;was closoe upoin nudnighe, and .Ilhad already boon writing for aseveral hoursa;'a it was Ics ossnary the work?I had ie lande s ashould-be finislhedby seecifidtiin;e, and I was anxious to keep fafth. Just at that moment I found myself brought to a stop by the want of certain data, which I re membered were to be found in one of my refodrnc-books. Being desirous to com plete the article before retiring for the night, I accordingly laid aside my pen,. and proceeded downstairs in pursuit of the volume in question. A few nemmutes' searchl sfliced to pro vide me. with ivwhat I roequired, and, taking the book in my hand,'I returned once moreto ney work. Enterinig the room hastily, it was ,lot until I reached imy place at the table that I noticed the chair oppositb to me to be occupied. I must confess to considerable surprise and even somie little alarm at thleo appari tion of a stranger in nmy house. With the exception of the servants Ilivoe alone, and certainly Iliad no recollection of having iinvited an~yone of this getlieman's appear trived to eoeter: without nmaking'himis?lf heard 3 S-" Good evening, air,l he said, with a strong provincial accent, as I :took smy seat. " Good evening," I replied, nsot very cordially, perhaps; but under the circum stances as absence -of warmth might be excused. "-Ifear, however,' I coitinoued, !'

His features seemed wholly unknown to me. . These, ib may bo. observed, were sufli ciently remarkable to.leavo a lasting is- pression iupon a memosry .less retentive - thal my own. But What struck ie cniost forcibly in this first examination was the old-fashioned air of the man ; an imlires sion, by the way, coiesiderably heightened by his style of costume,': which appeared to be modelled upon a pattern fashionable in the years of this century, but curiously. oet of keeping. with the present-day fur-' niture of my room:- The otlher.points in particular attracted my attention :.the first, thalt-Io was a very small man-so small, indeed, that is eo: satboila sriot' in-: ordinately high ;chair, his feoot did not even touch the ground, beet hlung "sus ponded in Inid-air, oscillating: backwards and forwards likoe a pair. of pondulumns'; the other,- thiitilso face was exceedingly red and chubby. -Throe was, mioreover, a good-naturered twinklo abot his eyes wvlich unmcediately suggested to tlhe observer, a. power of approciating a joke, if not of.too subtlo an order, quiteo equal to 'the average.

I sat back in my chair spoeechless, over come with tihe variety of oemotions which crowded upon me. But what, perhaps, oppressed' -el.cloro tihan anly, was the thought ihat. I had boon-basely tricked and deceived.

As he said those words I felt iiclisned to break .into a hysterical .laugh at, the absurdity of the . accusation,, but with a strong -effort I controlled myself. " I do not,'" I observed, "quite understand wvhlet grouilds you have for complaint." . '-No soonor lhnd I spokeoi than I would have given much to' recall the sentence. Tliohe ofect upon BMr. North was so decided as to cause Ine srious alarnn. 'His face becamce purple, and I feared eovry'instant to seo him roll off his seat in a tit of. npolilexy. Thile horrible thought forced itself upon me : what if I were loft with the corpse of a ghost upon mlly hands? Fortunately, howover, I was spared that calamity, for, recovering himself, lie again addressed me, thies time almost savagely- " "C Grounds for comnplisint I' he echoed.

But I spoke to regardless cars, for, paying no heed to my interruption, Mr. North again proceeded to the-attack: " ' Coine, sir, let's have a look at this precious book of yours., You've a copy tndoer yoir ha?!..,e: 't.h"ore iro t.on.i; ;p?asure -of hearing you' repeat aloud.
