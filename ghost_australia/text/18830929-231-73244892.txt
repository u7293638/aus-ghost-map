"OUR HARRY." A TALE OF THEI DIGGINGS. BY J. iM. B. CtIArPrIct xvtII. "Alas!. hi. hears yodu notL?. His i ar is stopped with earth."' TnI. poor woman now gave way3 to the tide o grief which she" had so powerfully, repressed during the last moments of her husband's-lifc, and her wail was pitiful to li.ten to as she lamented her loss with a voice-broken by sobs. ' "'Resquiesa! in pace,' my darlinig ! The heavens be your bed, for yourself was the -lov? ing husband to me, 'evcr since the day you took tiee from my father-s door. Azn' was it for. this that 've crossed the salt sea to'conme to this land of gohl ?-to a place where never a priest comes to bless is, or a doctor can be had. Was ii to bei'vbrking underground like a modicwort, and be crushed like a worm undler the earth, liat'ye left ould Ireland ? Sorrow for the day when it Was ever said to ye to come to Aus tralia, imy Bonnie James. And what shall \ve say to the por old motlter, too-that her eldest son was crushed to de-ath, an' Its wife and brother looking on ? lIowshall I tell it? God be good to.me now, if ever I leave the spot till himself is taken out and goes up the hIole before I go. ' Mary ! mother undefiled; mother of sorrows !.. Ora ro me.'" In vain they tried to remove her frosi the body, and at length one of the maltes clambered up theshaft and found some inore helpers, by swhose aid tie heavy tinibers wvere levered up, and the crushed framd of the once, strong man was, extracted aand removed to the tent, the widow insisting that the body should be taken up the shaft before she would ascend. ,-The.- painful scene need not be dwelt, upon. One more of the many nameless graves which are found in numbers near all .thee earlier diggings in Victoria. ' One more victim in the search after goli l had met his fate, and left ihose'he loved to the cold mercy of the world.> Yet inot alone-her - brother was with her, and she was not left destitute in a strange land,- as ninny have been, for the incident of sudden accident and painful death was not an un commnion feature'of the diggings when the gold fields were young. The mates, sad andi weary, found their way across the ranges towards their tent in the even ing, wet with perspiration anlndorn: out with hard toil.' As they passed the tlat at the bot toi of the gully, they came in sight of the smallstore which was thesole remaining place. of business, of all the numblirs that had floirished a few nionths since. - J im was dragging his limbs along in a weary, listless manner, and with a sort-of bhiver spoke to his mate., , "Leti us go over there and havea nobbler, HIarry. '. I am dead-heat, old man. I never felt so queer before. - I am all in a tremble with cold, attd my-lcad throls as. if it.would btirst. If I do not get something to lpnt life into me; I will never get to the ten!. - -" ".Come .along, oli fellow ; cheeri up. ;i: 'o lave caughitcohl with your wet clothes, iut we vill have a stiffdrink hot--that will makc',ou better. Give ineyotr pick, and laiy lold of ity arni.. I'll'pull you through." - . " The store was. reached; and the brandy was obtained. It coihd'l be had: at every store at that time, even altlhougth our wise rulers made if Rietil offence to sell spirits to the aniners.

Between the :pair poorJ Jim, weak and staggering, ias. half arried, half carried, dragged, to the, tent, undressedi, and laid dowri, when he at once sank intoa:i lieary iiroiubled sleep._:i: i."He will be. oit of:his.inind-cr .mornmng, .matey".:saidold Jake.

The dawn :-began to show in the sky, with faint gray streaks gradually changing to blue then the -.slightest tinges of pink and yellow made their appearance, and the whole horizoni was lit up with magnificent glowing crimson, gold, and az.ure.
