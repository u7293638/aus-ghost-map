WHB.'tE LIFE If? CHEAP. I The wickedest town ou tbe American eon- ' tinent is Cripple Creek, Col., aeoording to the bxpert*. To an influx ot desperadoes it owed a great labour strike of last year, tike quelling of whieh required a sheriff's posse of 1,600 men, horse and infantry, armed with Winoeetors and supported with (iatling guns and cannon. ' General ' Jack ttmitb was the commander of tbe miner*' foroes. He appears to have been a desperado almott from boyhood. Coming to Cripple Creek over a year ago, be found bimaelf in the midst of a horde of men of like character, and it took them but a short time to foment a labour agitation among tbe miners. Destruction of mining property, tbeft, and the murder of oon-union miners began to be of regular occurreooe At the out set of his geowaUhip Smith made bis head quarter* ou Ball Hill, a mountain whose every approach could be guardtd. All tbe trails and roads were oaiued with dynamite that eculd be touched off through wire* from tbe summit, if necew^ry, to drive away an invading (orce. It was given oat and Mirved tbat tbe striker* had caution on the bill, and oa a crag a fort waa built, a corner of it being visible by tbe aid ot j glasses. For over a mouth toe miners owned | Cripple Creek. Tbey tnafte daily raids into 1 private houses for arm« and ammunition, aod appropriated anything elae that caught tbeir fancy. Other oolrages,too numerous to particularise, were committed, but tUc moat malicious waa tbe blowing op of the Strong Mine abaft bouse ' The superintendent anrl two men were in tbe mine at tbe time, aed would have perished but . for the fact that one ot them waa ao Oddfellow aod one of the. strikers, wbo belonged to tbe aame organisation, opened the covering ot the air-shaft. A few weeks ago some ot Smith's I friends were put in tbe Bull Hill lock-up for a I misdemeanour, and Smith shot the padtodc oft tbe }*il door and liberated them. He then began to look for the marahal, with the . avowed iutention of killing him, bat his intended victim was quicker with bu gun aod toppled over both Smith and a companion named Popst. Smith lired a short time after reerinng bu wound, and his la t with waa for a Chriatiao baptism, whicii was giren him bv a Catholic pr, m «bo was near.
