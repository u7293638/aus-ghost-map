JUVENILE DEPRAVITY. to the editor. Sir, — I think it is about time « branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was formed in Geraldton ; as it would seem some of our young people delight in wan- ton cruelty without let or hindrance at present- Catching sea-oirds on the jetty by means of a fish-hook with a tempting bait tEereOn, appears to one of the forms of amusement most popular with the juveniles of Geraldton. of; late, and a day or two ago, I found a number of boys aged between 16 and 7 years, rejoicing over a more ingenious method still of capturing some of the feathered tribe which wing their graceful flight about our beach. The means resorted to con sisted of a rat-trap baited, of course, "with a tempting morsel and hung seductively over the jetty. Into tbe jaws of this trap a victim soon found its way where it was caught, tbe force which the springs of the trap gave to the clasps being sufficiently strong to shatter the bird's bill. Then while it burig trembling with pain to the trap some of the youngsters plaited its wings, having done this they next threw it into the sen. Subsequently some of their appetites for cruelty not being satiated the bird was re captured and more fan evoked by buffeting the bird about the heads of the youngsters round about until it gave up the ghost. " And this is tbe refined cruelty In which young Geraldton appears "to revel in, and relish exceedingly. No v. if these birds were edible or the catching of them served any good purpose, no one would scarcely object to the boys resorting to any m-'ans to capture them, but when as in the case I have mentioned, love of cruelty, for cruelty's sake is the inducement which leads to these vicious practices, we can only deplore the faet that kindlier feelings towards to the lower (?) creation do not assert themselves. I am, etc., yours truly, A LOVER OF BIRDS, Geraldton, March 45th, 1890,
