SPIRIT OF THE PBESS. WHAT IT COSTS TO BE A CATHOLIC. (Catholic Sentinel.) \- Perhaps there are few Catholics who live in peace under the United States, who ever stop to consider the sacrifices the people ih many European countries have to undergo, simply because they profess the Catholic Faith. In Russia, to become a convert to the Roman Catholic Church entails forfeiture of all estates, and prevents promotion in the civil or military sphere. In like manner, in other countries, paius and penalties await all who dare to cast aside the perplexities pf Protestantism, and take up the Cross of orir Divine Saviour. Even in America, with all its boasted toleration, tbe man who openly professes the Catholic faith is in a measure os.traoised by those who are imbued with a spirit of Puritanism. The world, in a won?, hates the Catholic Church, as her teachings are repulsive to those who follow the world, the flesh, and—as a oonsequence—the deyil. Worldlings cannot reconcile to themselves tbe teaohings of that spiritual motber who tells,all her children there is a spiritual lan which iB .far more imperative than tbe law of Mammon; nor ca.n it endure that Clioroh which places the Cross of Christ above and beyond the sceptre of. Caesar. In the creedless churches, men, learn, that to be rich, powerful, and independent of religious scruples is the aome.of perfection, and thus tbe; intuitively are taught to hate the teaohings of the Temple of the Holy Ghost, whioh tells UB that the poor are the people of God, that the humble shall be exalted, :and that selfabnegation is the eolemn obligation of ererj Christian. The world tells its votaries that the religion of Dives is the true -method by whioh to gain happiness, whilst the Catholic Church tells her children that to be good and perfect Christians they r '&aust-; be like.Lazarus in spirit, J3P that the .Son of . God may-take pity upon them, and raise them. up to the glbry He has promised'al! wholove and serve him in faith,- hope, :: and charity; '-For these reasons, and for; others. fully as potent, .tbe worldly-minded look'upon prabtical Catholics as men who arebeneath'them in intelligence, who are blinded, to their o\?n .best interests because they believe 'in the' teachings of the Church, rby which* t^iey &e.;'i>r6Vjanted from committing"'nameless crimes, whose veij mention pollutes the ' jips'that, give them utterance, and whp.l mor^byei 1 ; are so Xircom* scribed .bjr }fee laws of. :God,'.that they torn away in 'disgust "i^m; wh^t ; the World is pleased to cairits'i>leaiures.''"
