ONE ON ' THE JUDGE.' Roy Bean, the high judge of the courts of Langtry, where justico is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An tonio last week, on the occasion of which visit- he was made the victim of a cruel practical joke, sayB the San Antonio ' Ex press,' He met a drummer atthe hotel, who said ho had just come from Lanztry. 44 Did youscc my bear ? Howis hegetting along ?' was the justice's first question. Judge Bean's bear throughout West Texas stands second in fame to the judge himself. The animal was chained to a tree in the rear of the judge's beer saloon, and in its day drank many a bottlo of beer at a cost of 25e per bottlo, to the edification of the wayfarer who was compelled to spend a few hours in Judge Bean's judicial distriat. ?4 Didn't you hear of it ?'*asked the drum-, mer. 44 The bear died last night.' The dunnner had an old score to wipe out at lioy Bean's expense, and he succeeded in convincing the judgo that his bear was dead. Roy Bean lost no time in making for the telegraph office, where he penned these in structions: 44 Skin the bear, and express the skin to me at once.' To this he attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean's man at tlie saloon promptly killed the bear and expressed the Bkin, and in the letter that accompanied the fur was this note: 41 We hated to'kill the bear, and he hated to die. Ittook three shots before he gave up tho ghost. Weure now smoking the basons.' When Roy Bean received the message'he broke three chairs and then set out in quest of tho drummer. The offender is said to be conducting earnest diploniatic negotiations by mail with Tho Law of West Texas.'
