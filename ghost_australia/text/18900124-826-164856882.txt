IRELAND. An Interesting Comparison. Some facts mentioned in a recent pronouncement by the Archbishop of Dublin on the higher education of Catholics in Ireland, are of much interest. His Grace contrasts the work done in the faculty of arts in the two Catholic University Colleges at Stephen's Green and Blackrock with the results obtained in the two Queen's Colleges of York and Galway. The total number of honors gained by these two Queen's Colleges at the examinations of the Royal Uni versity during the five years ending with the present year is 117- Black rock alone took 118, or one more than the two Queen's Colleges together, while the University College at Stephen's Green won 168, or nearly 45 per cent, more than the two Queen's Colleges. The total number of graduates in arts in the two Queen's Colleges for five years was 68, against 82 in the two Catholic Colleges. The latter colleges are not only under Catholic manage ment, but the professorial staff is almost exclusively composed of clergymen— the Blackrock College being under the Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and the University College, Stephen's Green, under the Jesuit Fathers. The Arch bishop called attention to the fact that the medical schools of the three Queen's Colleges have an endowment from the exchequer of £5,000 a year, besides having the building and equipment ex penses defrayed by Parliament, while the Catholic University does not receive a penny. Yet during the five years the medical schools of the three Queen's Colleges won only six first-class honcrs at the medical examinations of the Royal University, against five won by the Catholic medical school. The three former medical schools won five first class exhibitions at the same examina tions, while the Catholic school won also five.
