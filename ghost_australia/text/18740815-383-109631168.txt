OUR CIVIC AiRANGEMENT. CONSERVATISM VEBSUS WOULD-BE PROGRESSION. Hail, British sway! Hail, Briton's righteous causo! Hail, Britain's code of municipal laws ! Inheritance her sons can claim by birth, Where'er they dwell on any spot of earth O'er which her flag is to the breeze unfurled, A spectacle to angels and tlhe world. Her glorious charter to this land is brought, For which in olden times our sires have fought; And war to the usurper that is found To touch this bond, mn which our life is bound. Freemen we are, in freedom we rejoice, : And o'er the wave we hear a friendly voice An echlo wafted to our Southern shore, Pointing the way our father's trodo before. When our affairs are in the hands of men Who can by virtue of their speech and pen, As well as tact for work, perform their part, And who from rectitude will not depart, We can with comfort by their acts abide And sit quite cozy by our ingle side, Believing that no evil dare approach Our sacred homes, nor on our rights encroach. But men do not their fellow-mortals sway Whoso only rhetoric is--yea and nay. Those wlio can't grasp the subject in debate Come on the stage for honours rather late In this progressive and enlightened ago To leave their mark upon our history's page: Instead of wrangling and provoking schism They shduld go home and learn their catechism. Our town and suburbs exercised their right, On Tuesday last, and proved that right scaS might, For no place hunter, snichkering protection, Had half a ghost of chance at our election: No canvass made o'er swipes or yet Bohea Had served to send our good town's-folk agee, They know as well as any sage could teach In measured terms, or by a hunting speech,. No three showed front that well could bear com parisonl With Dixon, Fuller, and old' SBIvLLY HARRISON.
