THE FGRSAKEN FARMHQU3E. Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of a dead home, staring through Its broken lights on wasted lands Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown,_bv scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm-fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bare ft, \- Ti3e garden plot no housewife keeps; Through weeds and tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom-cla-i, Sways bare before the empty rooms ; Beside the roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in mould of dust and drouth, On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the tireless chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Eesounds no more on busking eves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresher beats his sheaves. So sad, so drear! It seems almost Some haunting spirit makes its sign; That down yon shadowy lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine. â€”J. G. WHITTIEB.
