NELLIE'S ROMANCE. "So you are going to be married, Nellie?" said Bertie Egerton, stroking his tawny and decidedly handsome moustache. They were alone in the conservatory, and the musicians were playng tbe "Mabel Wa.tz" and the dancers were whirling round like mad. ,*' Yes," she said, and she said it a little raef.dly, aa if she stall carried her heart about with her, and had not given it into the keeping ef her future lord and master. " I don't believe you care for him, Nellie Vince, though yon are going to marry him." " iio," she answered slowly, " I don't. Indeed, on the whole," she added candidly, " I think I detest him." The Vinees were miserably poor—those moat unfortunate of beings, poor gentlefolks— the sort of people who, in the coarse of a season, suffer a dozen of martyrdoms from petty mortifications, with an en durance which, if known, would excite the envy of the ghost of the never-to-be forgotten Spartan boy, and extinguish his glory for ever; the sort of people who have an appearance to keep up, and nothing to keep it upon. They gave a dinner twice a year, and starred for a fortnight before, and grumbled for a fortnight after it. They never went to a theatre unless they had orders given to them, and then they hired a brougham, because cabs east nearly as much, and were more vulgar; and they stinted themselves for a week after the indulgence. The girls went to all the parties they were invited to. " be cause," said politic Mrs. Vince to Colonel Vinos, who," if he bad little money, had much pride—" because," said Mrs. Vince, "they might get off." Besides, going to parties was loos expensive than giving them; so the girls went in their everlast ing mu?lins, which were ironed when they were tumbled, and washed when they we? dirty. Heigh-ho! They wen so poor, though they did not show it jnuch—that is, not much, considering, j They wore cheap gloves sad common dresses, and made the latter at horns ; and they passed by the bonnet shops, which they were never allowed to enter, with a sigh. They pretended to like walking better than driving, and to dislike all wine (that is, at_ home), excepting claret, which was twelve shillings a dozen. And they kept small fires, and threw up the cinders"; and didn't feel inclined1 to go to «hnreb. on -ooUeetkm Sundays—that is, the'ColOnM TOU-Mra.-'VnuJe'didn'fc ycllin, m* "I- 1-. ""* -ArthurJtesi^to. High Church, where there was always a collection; but they ignored the bag altogether, -and when it came round, sang very loudly, and looked at their hymn books very attentively; *? they didn't'notice it. ' ' Nellie was the eldest girl, pretty rather, and decidedly spirited—clever, too, and lively and «"n?i?"?g She was twenty-one all but a week, and looked younger and felt older. She had been in love with Bertie Egerton all her life, but he had nothing besides his handsome self and pretty name to boast of; 'so, though they understood each Other ai perfectly as if there had been a dozen proposals between them, they bowed to circumstances. He wm supposed to bea barrister, bat he had -never held a brief in his life. He had an undle rolling in money, who had sent him to eollegd, and pronnswl to dp something for him, and who bad paid tbe fefesfo* his entrance at the Templa; but Bertie, though he had acquired great .knowledge "of the world, had acquired' little know ledge of law, so his uncle was hot best pleased, -MoWj-i'-Monfiy-bags." M hia_ nerJhew irreverently called him, was seventy- five, and not attuabl?—so he would not have been-lamented ; but he showed no«igas of dying, siid if h? had; perhaps there might be nothing in' lfis will for Bertie, though: he was his nearest relation. Altogether, therefore, things .were hopeless; they could not marry on love and live on sir; besides, JBerfis had *& righteous honor, of: ipcwjar^y. HeUu was romantic, very decidedly, .romantic, though she pretended'to be matter-of fact. In her hear* she wss horridly ,'di* appointed that Bertie didn't propose Gretna, or its equivalent (since •• that useful institution was abolished). She was in love, rery much in love, .and if he would have only asked-her, would have married him, an* settled down to genteel poverty for the rest of her with the greatest satisfaction-; "but he didn't. On the contrary, he bewaflW nis riutwlyj an! ssid.hft tfcottgbj Ks&aMip;*it& tq " Flanbrtjot^,'—g^tatioybeing a West Indian heiress with, plenty/ifinoney and little b&nty.; Therefore, Ifeme, after being tafeed-toraaeVhavingall the advaa tages explaiaei/to her by s her politic mamma, and being lectured and called " Myjdear daughter" by her: proudrpapa^ had accepted old Brownlow. They were to be married in July, and this was May; so phe had two months' freedom yet,ijuid then—but she resolutely forbore to-look any farther. .; ;., '■•• .. :-■ ; : ■ ■'■ Old Brownlowwas as rich as a Jew; so it was «a excellent match, people said, and theT were more attentive to the Vm6es in''cbnsdquflDcey especially'to' NeUiey ;He wwo't Mndsome. He was fifty-five, and rather gray...; He. wasn't 'over head And ears pi love with Nellie— io adored himself too much for that. 'The fact was, he wanted a mistress fdrUs noose, and some one to. head .his table, and he thought she would do. ' He Bad hesitated between Nolliotod her younger 1 .sister -Clara. . Clara was prettier, but Nellie had mpre spirit, and that had d% cided him. He liked her independence and spirit, though he intended to curb it as for as he was concerned. Clara would have accepted him much more willingly;* she liked the pomps aniv&nities-of; this iniquitons world, and rather envied tfeQie on t&t;& wholOj"" and. "Sdmipod lior <liiuntiii<l engagement ring particularly. Nellie had. not seen Bertie since the evening that ring had been placed on her not at all willing finger, till they met at the WDfords'party. Lucidly, old Brownlow was not there, so they had it all their own way. They had danced about a dozen ban of the "Mabel," and then betaken themselves to that dimly-lighted and remarkably convenient conservatory. "Detest him!** said Bertie; "pleasant, certainly;" but he seemed rather pleased, on. the.whole, or, at all events, decidedly not sympa thising, as he ought to have been. "In deed £ do, Bertie." The/were sitting down in .the cosiest corner of that cosy flirtation harbor. "Why do you many Mm, then f Oh, heVxiob," she replied a little scornfully. " Wordly young per son you must be," he said, looking as if he considered her a curiosity; but there was a look in his eyes as he bent them down on her which .Nellie didn't see, or her heart might have fluttered unplea santly, " very wordly young person," he repeated, "but not at 'all wingniar, though.'* "lam sore I would orach rather not," ahe said dolefully; "yon don't know how I dread it. lam sure 1 dbnft mind poverty in the least; indeed,' I! rather 'like it $'■' bat her tone i? doubt' fal when she added the latter clause, and hbr thoughtuwsrtad-to the bills in the letter-clip on her papa's writing table, and the foot-notes appended to many of them, to ■ the efieot that 'Messrs. &o;>and sb muat regueat, &c..;" " Doesn't Ao now alday?^drfSg^Heilg*.' fie ealfe&'her darlingnowandthen, and Nellie pretended not to hear it. fie only did it now and then. everything," she remarked sagely, : ','Jtk a great deaL though." <<Oh,of«oaneitis,"aheaii?werea. «| tittle crossly;' Bh?wa?« shade-vend, to tell the truth.

"Wish I wasn't such a pauper,'r he remarked presently, and he sighed. Nellie heard the sigh, and was de lighted. He had left off stroking his moustache now, and was looking into her eves. She did see the expression in his now, and she felt her turn hud opine. " What a delightful oonple we shall be.!'' she said teafingly. "How We shall yawn: at each other from each side of the toe place; and how superbly polite ire shall be to each other,. and how he will bate me in six months when ha finds I fulfil all my duties properly, excepting that of loving him;" and she was-a little bitter now. "Youdon't lore him,thenf he asked eagerly,•_ "Dida't I tall yon Ide? tested him!" "Nellie"—and his faoa was very dose to her"*—"Neffie, bow happy we could hare been!" "Yes," she whispered, and she didn't more her face. "No use, darling;" and he kissed the' lips whioh wen so temptingly close to his, and wasn't TeprovwL , Yen; shocking,-. wasn't it?—espeeiaUy oonsi oaring that diamond ring on the third finger of her left hand.
