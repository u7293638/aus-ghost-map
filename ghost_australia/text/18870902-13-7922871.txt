IN RIVERINA. THE ROAD, THE MINISTRY, AND THE SHEARERS' UNION. BY TELEMACHUS. It is easy to get as far as Deniliquin The not very fast train takes us over that breadth of plain and 'is pleasant enough to rest ft while in Deniliquin, for there are good houses of accommodation and broad surroundings, and the beginnings of new forms of life to be studied but 'is very hard to leave Deniliquin at half-past 4 o'clock in the evening with a promise of wet weather and a certainty of infamous roads for there is no more railway travelling now "the Old Man Plain" his right ahead full of crabholes, swamps, ruts, bogs possibilities of floods in the coach, of capsizes, of stick inst, of "turn out there and bear a hand to get the horses along, they Lim never drag you through " The coach itself is terribly prepared with more light than an ocean steamship carries , two great lamps with reflectors right over the driver s head , two more on either side six in nil when the candles are lit they will throw a flood of clear white light far ahead of the leaders It will be impossible for the driver to plunge suddenly into any trouble that declares itself on the surface. But what does the surface declare of the depths below, even in daylight' "Is there any water on the road ' ' ' not much - a mile or two " ' Many passengers going ' "Plenty-a dozen at the least-and all for inside if they can get there " It seems at the first a matter of impossibility to bestow more than six inside-a couple of women and four men In the midst of one's own anticipations of troubles it is impossible but to pity those, two poor women, packed up for 14 or 24 hours' travel in thntsquaroboxof a couch with hard seats, straight back and front and a handful of dirty, well trodden straw on the floor One of them will evidently pull through all right, she of the stout old bush woman sort with wall tanned face and hands She had known more of camp thin city life, and will not make no fuss, no matter what happens but the other is a poor flimsy girl with a whitish face and a fringe on her forehead and a lot of doubt, which iv i armies soon wears down as to how she is to bestow herself in the exceeding narrow space allotted to her Then we have a city wool man who has ventured out on a coach trip to Wilcannia, a squatter, who has crossed the Old Man Plain a son tired times, and sleeps or talks the journey through without the slightest symptom or discomfort of any kind A bush workman makes up the inside party and a company of shearers or business of various kinds are stowed without. the horses and the coachman appear to time , the latter mightily clad in woollens and oilskins, but with the brown cheek and bright eye which in pilot or helmsman or something in always beget confi- dence. The garb of the man tells you there is a lot to be done the glance of his eye gives assurance that it will be got through I am taking up a little space with this coach and its journey because I have a profound conviction that it is the last time my folly will ever lead me into such an expel pence, and a sincere hope that it is a trouble which will not much longer be endured by any travellers between Deniliquin and Hay. We started at halfpast C, well packed to gether, with the leather curtains shut down to keep out the driving rain, and an atmosphere speedily so bad that it could hardly get worse, composed of oft breathed air, tobacco smoke, and chilly draughts creeping in through the crannies We rattled and jolted out of the town, and came in an hour or less to the first of the bogs The good horses pulled us through in grand style Amidst the gurgle of the waters, the falling of the mud clogs, the " Up then, up II of the coach map, and the frequent swish and crack of the whip, we could hear them allotting and blowing They find frequent half miles of this sort, with intervening patches of tolerably hard ground they might be seen at every half enveloped in a cloud of steam mud bespattered tram cars to begin, with widespread nostrils and drooping, de jected heads they were not asked to do long states it took more than 10 of them to take us through, but it was hard unkind work that ought to have been ended many a year ago Three glimpses of the night will be enough It is 11 o'clock We have done 30 miles with four changes of horses The men outside have ended all their singing and laughing and jolting His cold has subdued them Within, the "tout bush woman sits silent and composed in her corner, the poor girl permits her head to roll about helplessly, and the balance of her body to slip or jolt into any position of temporary ease My squatting friend has talked out all his memories of old days, and seems, with the faculty peculiar to bushmen, to be smoking and sleeping at the one time The other people look uncomfortable I am becoming sore and cramped, and fired and cross. Where are we' At the Black Swamp It is a weird look out through the couch windows. All the light from the lamps is sent right hand. We see only a late winter and black trees, The water holds so much clay in solution that it appears absolutely white close beneath the coach, grey 10 yards away, then utterly black Far away in some patch of dry ground a curfew calls, or yells, or Bhtieks My friend, who knows the road well, wages for a moment, and says-The Black Swamp Queer thing, cattle will never camp quietly here There must be something in it "In what'' "Don't you know this is the place of the Trotting Cob and cloudless Trooper' A trooper was murdered here and beheaded years ago, and his ghost is supposed to trot round on a bald faced cob I never saw it, but I have seen cattle restless all night, and I know the drovers will never stay here if they can help it " Sleep again, and a chance to dream of the headless horseman, or to think about Brunton Stephen- quaint rendering of the legend Raspings of corns, bumping of knees, collisions of shoulders or of heads, broken sleep for four hours more, and how than do we appear ?

Dull pain in eyes and forehead, too, and a soreness of the throat, Let us be done with it. Two hours and a half more, 16 hours in all. and we are turned out in the street of Hay, at the door of one of the most comfortable hotels in Australia. We can got a warm bath, a quiet sleep, Of sleep will come in such unfamiliar circumstances, and must needs turn out with all the rest of the town in the warm and cheery afternoon to note the arrival of the NSW Ministers They have been travelling all the West, study mg the rabbit question, and the land question, and the railway question, and are supposed to have gained a lot of information which will be useful by-and-by they come driving along the main street about 4 o'clock with a cavalcade before and behind the Minister for Mines, Mr Abigail, who introduced him self to the world by his detection of the railway frauds the Minister for Justice, Mr William Clarke, who went out into the corridor with a mem her of the late Ministry with intent to proceed from justice to execution in summary fashion It is the Minister for Mines a trip, and, as he has been journeying through country which has been all developed by Victorian energy, and is now worked by Victoria capital, and educated, moreover, with Victorian newspapers it seems to nor a reasonable and necessary matter to obtain from him a few impressions or opinions to understand what he has learned, in fact and if possible what he thinks the little gentleman is quite approachable, though clothed with new and unfamiliar charity A little bit time , he has not come out " to express opinions but to gather information that is natural and satisfactory of course, and what every Munster ought to do , but what generally strikes one in interviewing ans Sydney man returning from out West is, not how much he has learned, but how deplorably ignorant he must have been when he set out. I was quite sure that Mr Abigail would tell me that he did not intend to express any opinion, and equally sure that I should be able to chronicle opinions-or impressions which would have all the weight of opinions before we parted A man must be a fool who can take the notions current in Sydney out into the Western district and bring them back intact-and Mr Abi(, id is not a fool What do you think about HUB question of compensation for improvements to Crown tenants? Of course it would be a breach of confidence to say what was thought but Mr Abigail did say, and readers objection to the publication of the en, ing that his views of the matter had been considerably changed by his recent experience He had seen that the squatters had many troubles and losses and harassment-, and that their case was worthy of more consideration than it had so far receive I. We do not want to hear any more than that Let the whole of the Ism South Wales Cabinet come to the same opinion, and justice will be done. He landholders the pioneers and developers of the western country only ask justice, though any man who knows them and their circumstances understands the soundness of their claim to consideration, assistance and indulgence there as to the rabbit trouble j Mr Abigail has seen the rabbit trouble and recognised its magnitude, and braced himself to a noble attitude of Britons never shall be slaves " even to rabbits He has also seen a good work of destruction effected by boughs of emu bush steeped in some poisonous solution and placed in a securely tenced paddock He thinks various paddocks can be cleared in that way, and by-and-by that the country may all be paddocked and cleared. Also, he under- stands, as all men of practical experience have understood for years past, that the present methods of paying for scalps and employing men to work by results is injurious in many ways and must be stopped. And there is an end of his views on the matter and they are nothing worth. No man living could in a month of experience form views of any practical value in such a matter as this. It is a question to be given into the hands of a commission of gentlemen of the most thorough practical information and profound scientific knowledge. Bush science, chemical science medical science all the arts and craft of sport need to be combined for the performance of this work. It is no use saying the British race will beat the rabbits, they never yet beat me quite orders But the railways, Mr Abigail What do you think after travelling, those tremendous distances You have come right in from Milparinka by W llcaunia, you have seen the dealings of the Burner Itiuiees you understand their proximity to Adelaide, and the wastes which intervene between them and Sydney You see also here, in Hay, the possibilities of vast development, and Melbourne, set by nature just down there, and Sydney right over there, and you are a sworn freetrader and member of a free trade Government, and acknowledge the right of every man to buy and sell in the cheapest of the host market -on have not been across the 'Uli Man Plain, at a coach by night or you would know much more about it, but from what you have seen are you anything more of an Australian than when you left Sydney ' Not much, says Mr Abigail still deems it possible to drag the produce of the Barrier Ranges 350 miles across to Sydney, still is not quite sure of the desirability of bridging that dirty, dirty ditch of absolute undisturbed protection the Old Man Plain Still is more disposed to be true to the old motto of ' Australia for "Sydney than for that newer and brighter and nobler and better of All for Australia. All for the common interest to which Melbourne and Sydney, and Victoria and New South Wales must be subsidiary Mr Abigail went out to look at hospitals school, of art, court houses roads, bridges parks and schools Doubtless he was much instructed by what he saw, and certainly he gave much satisfaction to the townsfolk by what he promised later on but I think that at a banquet in the evening he received a more liberal education as to the actual requirements and wants of the people of Riverina than through all his previous travels The dinner was over, the usual loyal toasts honoured the health of the Ministers and Parliament proposed and responded to, and the district introduced linen outspoken the voice of the district in most unmistakeable words We have heard Band and man after another, all that has been n auld about curtsies to Sydney and New South Wales, and we Stand fast In our attachment to our capital and loyalty to our colony but what we desire to experience is the loyalty and justice of the capital is displayed in actions toward us Here is a country fit for everything and a population capable an 1 willing to develop it Down there is Melbourne, our natural market, and at our doors 'IO miles or so,; swamp, or desert, which you will neither bridge for us nor permit us to battle for our selves It we trade with Melbourne and make more, we make it for ourselves as citizens of New South Wales And as for journilwny toJlMlcannin and to the Barrier houses what possibility is there of any returns from it. It will entail a permanent church on the country We shall be tuicdtupiy interest on its cost-be taxed, that is, not for the benefit or development of any native in dustry or resource but to allow Sydney to win a little trade from Adelaide It was some straight talk, and it is much to be hoped that it will sink into the hearts of the Ministers, and influence the decisions of the Cabinet. but that it is not much hope Ndtherot the Ministers seemed able to take any large view of the matter neither had ever opened his PJ cs and behold Australia If the lines people really wished to get their railway made, they should not have kept Ministers at all but by some mean" have pro value 1 a magnificent demonstration at Deniliquin, and packed them off by Cobb's coach at night to enjoy it. The troubles of the road would have sunk far more deeply into their hearts than all the eloquent pleadings of line They would have made up their minds either never to travel between Deniliquin and tiny again or to travel by rail When the Ministers had gone, there was time to look about at the town, or the city it slum! 1 be said the episcopal see and capital of Riverina. I talked, as was most natural and necessary, with the two good Sydney pressmen who had been all round about with the Ministers, and they both agreed that this was a town which did not seem to belong to New South Wales, It was clean and bright, I and well watered, and tree planted, with roads well formed and metalled to some extent, though the expense of metalling here Is enormous, burnt brick costing 21s per yard, and gravel from Narrandera 17s 6d, per ton It had a good water supply years ago, while Bathurst folks, whose town is coeval with the century almost, were content to go un- washed. It is indeed a pleasant little town, and in this bright spring weather, after, or in the intervals rather of the early spring rains, has elements of beauty peculiarly its own. now the sunshine warms everything in the early after noon the thermometer is standing at 70deg , the steam 13 rising from the saturated I green lines, and a flood of light pours down the long broad streets, making the berries on the white cedars and the brown twigs of the elms twinkle and shine At frequent inter- vals between them are well grown pepper trees, with heavy crowns of evergreen foliage and bunches of scarlet berries beneath the leaves, jacarandas also, looking a trifle ragged, but later on, when elms and willows are full foliaged, to burst into plumes of purple or blue bloom The grand verandahed and balconied front of Espn's Hotel will be almost came pletely bowered in then With the banks and post office it stands boldly forth now, one of many good substantial buildings doing credit to the town and its people There are a good many people moving about a half dozen squatters from near and distant stations arranging for the forthcoming shearing, and a half hundred shearers hanging about the various hotels, a vexed, and weary, and disconsolate look on their faces lins union business is bothering them a good deal, and they are doubtful if it will do them much good One tall figure in grey, walking silently along, must needs arrest attention More than 11ft in height, thin, stooped somewhat, hair and beard fast chanting through grey to white clad in loosely fitting grey clothes, a great Bille handkerchief twisted about his neck in the place of the usual linen collar It is Mr James Tyson, whose possessions are estimated to be worth a 1,000,000, who never married, and his whole life long has not been known to drink a glass of intoxicating liquor or smoke a pipe of tobacco, or enjoy a merry moment, or waste a shilling or a farthing He has done liberal things of late years It is said that he gives largely to charities and churches One of his latest this was at EGO to the Brisbane Cathedral Fund. It is rumoured, indeed it is true, that the bishop wrote back remonstrating The game was too small and inadequate to the donors wealth The donor replied, ' Send back the cheque, and I will consider the matter " It was sent, and is under consideration still Another figure in the street somewhat strange to the bushmans eyes 13 the bishop The bishop, in apparel, corn promises slightly to the exigencies or customs of the bush He wear, a lett but, but loops it up with tassels apron but not gaiters He walks about the town quietly but busily, one does his utmost to associate himself with the life of the people, and shed abroad all the lustre which naturally attaches to his high position-considerable natural capacity and late endowment of old world culture and experience Mrs Bishop, I am told, is still more active than his lordship, and has taught the people of Riverina more of the necessity of testifying to their good will by good works that they ever knew before the bishop tells me that the union people are wrong this time, and I as we propose to go to the bottom of this matter it may be just as well to make state. ment of the present circumstances and the various events which have led up to them First then, as to how the union came to be formed Best year on some of the northern rivers of New South Wales some few of the squatters met together, and determined that, as bu 1 season bad followed bad season, and squatting investments had returned no profits whatever, it was reasonable and right that shearers should share the general IOSB, and submit to a slight reduction of their customary rates. They met, therefore, and agreed on a reduction of 2s (6d per hundred, and advertised that this reduction would be made by all members of their union The shearers determined to resist, and formed a union in Ballarat. A paid secretary was appointed, and a course of agitation and canvassing commenced The majority of the shearers in all the colonies joined, and there were some slight conflicts, with varying results, in a few of the northern sheds With the commencement of the shearing season of this year, however, now Steps were taken, a form of agreement was drawn by the union, of which all the Working Rules of the Amalgamated Shearers Union of Australasia " were to be taken to form part, and this was to be signed by equal tors and shearer" It is unprecedented even in the history of trades unionism that any tradesmen or artisans seeking em ploy meat should draft their own contract with the employer, and It is also against the whole letter and principle of unionism that the employer should bind himself in any way to union rules Experienced unionists never obtrude their rules on the employers' notice But it is pretty clear that the leading spirits of this business knew very little about either unionism or the common or statute law of the land Otherwise how could they have framed and sane tioned such a by law as this - Members on strike shall remain on the ground, and the roll shall 1 0 called every morning: Number not answering to their names to be lined fis." W line would be thought of union lenders in Melbourne who would order men on strike to remain vv than any factory Such a by law attached to the rules of any society shows an utter ignorance of the com- monest facts of life and work , yet there it stands in the documents of the society, Bignell and attested by president and vice presidents, treasurer, and secretary When blind lead blind in this fashion it is tolerably certain that both will fall into the ditch, and I fancy flic ditch has already been found, at least on the Murrumbidgee The union lifts raited difficulties where none before had existed, and union men have deliberately broken agreements which were entered into with full knowledge and in good faith on both sides I know all about the "menu squatters" of the colonies, the "middling" and "running," the exorbitant rates for rations, and, as I think, foolish and saucers gary attempts to reduce wages All these blinds constituted grievances, but instead of attempting to redress those grievances, the union lenders, seeing doubtless their own advantage in any conflict, have sought to place practically insurmountable difficulties in the any of cordial agreement between the squatter and the shearer As things stand now the leading squatters and the steady and trustworthy shearers are in perfect accord nil down the Murruml and there is no difficulty whatever about rates or accommodation or quality of work required, or fines or penalties, or any matter whatever, but the nuitiitorsmid controllers of the union have manufactured 11 fetish in the shape of their agreement and the men fall down and worship or run blindly after it, to their own loss and injury, the hindering of much necessary work, and the serious disarrangement and delay of the commerce and progress of the colony I am going to Mungadel to morrow to witness a roll call, on 1, it may be, a fight
