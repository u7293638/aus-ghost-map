Rather a peculiar case (says the Echuca Advertiser of Wednesday last) is set down lor hearing at the Heath cote County Court, to commence sit ting on Friday next, before his Honor Judge Cindon. At the intersection of Pohlman and High streets, Heathcote, iB situated a brewery, which has been untenanted for a long time past, and was said to have been the haunt of a ghost, some white object having fre quently been seen patrolling the premises at the mystic hour. A young gentleman, living not far off was escorting a yoong lady home one evening, some two months since, and when passing the snpernatural's pro menade, beheld a white object in tront of him. Withoat more ado, he rushed forward and struck the supposed ghost a heavy blow with his walking stick. However, the ghoft proved to be sub stantial flesh and bone in the shape of a daughter ol a trooper, and who wsb quietly talking at the place with a friend, she being dressed in a light coloured dress. Negotiations at an amicable settlement having failed, the father of the injured intends to bring an action in the County Court to recover Â£200 dnmages.
