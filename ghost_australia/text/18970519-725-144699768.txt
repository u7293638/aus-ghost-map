An officer of tbe Grenadier Gnards, who would probably prefer to lead the for lornest of forlorn hopes rather than to have to make an admission so eminently calculated to bring ridioule and chaff upon him, atlcks to his assertion that he has seen something; whioh he believes to be supernatural in Windsor Castle.
