Seivice. Mr.Tiangton went further; he said that it would be profitable if we were to give to these niamif ictmeis the capital they had invested and to pension them for lifei j and he finther insulted the people of Melbourne by telling ^hem tliat he wold prefer seemg the men employed as shepheids, the women as female seivante than to have them 111 factories. Mr. Langton fuither,in- sinuated that every woman employed in a factory was immoral, an insinuation^ which has thrown their fathers and "brothers into -a s perfcct irensy. ^ I can tell you the tunes look troublous m Melbourne. As for the Mmistiy- my opinion is unchanged. Th^y may pass the fiscal changes contained in. tben budget, with the assistance of the Fiee Tiaders, but thcii taxation scheme will b° -defeatedliy an immense ma-jonty. Of coarse, if they aie willing to let the House completely alter then budget they may live, but "how degiading this will lie L I don't tlnnlr the Ministry can go so low as this Supposing that the tariff passes through the Assembly, it does not stand a ghost of a chance m the Council, It will either be thrown out ignominously 01 so amended that its* authors will not know it, and then the hon- Geo.

He was soon led out, a hopeless, bioken- down man. _ • I have heard a piece of intelligence which is of the most staithng kind but unfortunately the source is such that I cannot give it. Peihaps I will be jat liberty to telegiaph - it on Monday. Some distinguished artistes have aiiived in Sydney by the Cabfoiman mail, including Mdlle. Uina di Muieka and Madame Boston. The former is a gieat inima donua, who has in her time sung as the rival of Paitij Neilsen, and Albani. She goes on to- Melboiune. Madame Bistoii is the nval and contemporary of "Baehel, and the gieatest female tiagedian 01 our tune. Tlie. brings a tioupe of 33 Italian ai tastes, and it is very questionable if her enterprise can pay. Howew, she is veiy ilcli and should not feel a loss. However, coitain tiaits shown by Madtoie recently go to show" that she lovos money. My Sydney correspondent telegraphs to day that Madame kept ine Galiforman mail Bteamey, the City OJ, Melbourne, "walling for two laours K and then wanted -Captain Browne to, warf for. another "hour while she settled a dispute with a boatman about ihe_ fare.
