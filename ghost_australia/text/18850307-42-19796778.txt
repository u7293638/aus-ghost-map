CHILDREN'S CORNER The Short Cut. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] BY ISABELLA MAUNSELL. "I DON'T see the fun of going all the way round by the road. There's a short cut through the bush somewhere here that saves half the distance." "That's all right. Fred, but do you know tho way through it? " No, I never went that way myself, but I know scores of fellows that have, and they all say that it ia a deal shorter." "But if we tried it we should be sure to find it longer, if wo did not get lost into the bargain." " Lost! How can you got lost with a moun tain on one side, a scrub on the other, and the sun setting straight in front of you ? If any one went astray here he would deserve to be lost' "Well, as perhaps I deserve to be lost, I think I will stick to tho road, bo as not to give opportunity tho chance to lone me." " What do you say, Dick?" " I think we had better atick to the road, as Walter says." " Then you two can stick to the road, and I'll go homo by the short cut and tell them you are coming, and to wait tea for you." " Perhaps we shall get homo only to organise a search party for you." " All right—when I give you the chanco." "But really, Fred," said Walter, altering his bantering tone, "you had better come along with us. It ia not so very far by the road, and the moro tho merrier, ao the road will be shorter." " No, I'm bound for the short cut, but go your wav, and we'll see who will be homo first." And Fred Miller, whistling a merry tune, turned away from his two companions, and directed his stops resolutely towards the short cut. He was a bright, active, wayward boy, about cloven yoars of age, and as he had the misfortune to bo an only child ho was inclined to bo rather overbearing in his mannor, and vory little disposed to yield to the opinions of others, especially when they were not much older than himself. His two cousins, Walter and Dick, woro on a visit to him, and Fred had much enjoyed their company, but still did not consider them nearly bo capable of deciding matters as him self. In the present instance, if he had followed the dictates of his own real feelings, he would have returned home with them, but that would bave been yielding a point, 10 it was absolutely necessary to hia dignity to face the short cut, even if he had to do it alone; and having fairly started ho hurried along as speedily aa possible, for bo bad the additional stimulus of wishing so outdo Walter and Dick and arrive home first. But he found tho ground rugged and broken, and his way—for there was no track —con- stantly intercepted by huge trunks of fallen trees, endless intricacies of vines, and thickets of impassable scrub, which obliged hira to turn aside so often, and sometimes to retrace his steps for a short distance, that he soon became slightly confused, especially as his infallible Snide— the setting sun—had already bade good ye to this hemisphere and night was swiftly closing around him. For another hour ho toiled manfully on. always hoping that tho next turn would reveal seme familiar object that would show hira where he was, and prove that he was travelling in the right direction. But he could see nothing. The mountain was lost to view, and he had found it impossible to keep out of the scrub. It was quite dark now, and he had to feel bis way round and through impediments. The hop, hop, of paddy* melons and tbe mournful wail of some stray night-bird, with the rustling of his own foot steps, were the only sounds he could hear. Fred was a brave boy in one sense. The loneliness of his position did not alarm him in tho least. He would have been quite willing to lie down supperlcsa under the nearest tree and sleep till morning and then start on his way afresh. But there was one thing that frightened hira : His cousins wonld laugh at him, and the sense of his failure and their ridiculo—for he knew tbat long before this they mvist havo reached horne —were more bitter to him than a night in the bush could possibly be ; and for this samo reason he would not coecy, for that Wottjd be owning his failure. He had seated himself on tho spur of a gigantic fit*-tree to rest and muse on hia situa tion, and began to feel that he was really alone in the bush, and was quite at a loss which way to turn. Suddenly a sound arrested his atten tion ; it wan the familiar sound of tools. He could distinctly hear the gurr-gurr of a saw, the swish of a plane, and the bang bang of a hammer. Starting up he saw a glimmering light before him, and he mado towards it as quickly as he was able; and there by tho light of a fire ho saw a man Btooping over his work whatever it might be. "Hallo, mate, what arc you doing hero?" said Fred. "Making short cut*?," said the stranger, quietly, without looking up or betraying the least surprise; "do you want one?" "I want one that will take mo home," said Fred, feeling slightly uneasy, for now that he had como into the light it was a strange weird spectacle that he beheld. The man was gaunt, bony, and misshapen to the last degree; bis fingers were like tne talons of some fierce bird of prey, and were armed with cruel claws that closed round the handle of his tool with the same clutch that a hawk bestows on the body of its devoted captive. The flickering light as it danced and fell showed his poor ghastly weather-beaten features in liglits and shadows, each more dreadf al than the last; indeed, Fred fancied he saw the outlines of the trees through his body as he looked'up with his burning sunken eyes. "You want to go home, do you? I have wanted that, for many a weary year, and I am not home yet." "Have you been here all the while?" asked Fred, feeling not a little frightened, and sink ing on the ground. " Yes, 1 have been here all the while, and T have got to stay here till my work iv done— whenever that will be."  But why don't you come out of this? What is to keep yeu here? what work are you doing?" "Why don't you go out of this, and go home?" "Because I can't find my way out," said Fred humbly. " And I can't find my way out either, and if you can't get out of this you will have te stop with me all the rest of your life." Fred remained for a moment speechless with terror, and then asked : " But how did you get here f "Itisnotavery long tale," answered the man, " but it happened a long time ago. I waa a boy then, and I had been out shooting one day with two young friends of mine ; cousins they wore, too, and nice jolly chaps both of them. Well, aa we were coming back, I wanted them to take a abort cut through the bush home. Though I had never been that way myself, I felt quite certain I knew all about it But they would not be persuaded; 80 I act off by myself, and before I knew what waa up the night had act in, and I was all astray and soon quite tired out. I sat down on the spur of a big fig tree to rest a bit I was too proud to coooy, for I would not acknowledge that I was lost, and I couldn't bear being laughed at. All at onco I saw a light in front of me. It was moving about, evidently carried by somebody, and it was coming straight to me. When it came close I saw a little old man carrying a lantern. He stopped when he came up and asked roe what I was doing there. I told him I bad gone astray looking for a short cut through the bush. So he told me to follow him and be would put me in the way of short cuts. I wont after hira, and I cannot tell you through what a labyrinth of vines and bruah wood tangle he conducted me, but he brought me to thia place and showed me this basket of tools, and told me ray task was to cut all the timber in this scrub into short lengths of fHn., piano them to a point, and hammer them into the ground, and when I had finished that task I should be free to go. And then he laughed a loud, horrid, mocking laugh, wished me joy of my short cuts, and vanished away. I have never seen him since, but I hear tbat cruel laugh often and often in tho dreary lonely night, and then I know that he is near me watching my torture and mocking my misery, for I must work on and on ; I bavo no power to stop myßclf. lam starving for food, but I must still toil on. My mouth is parched and burning with thirst, but I must not stay a moment. lam f rozon with cold, burnt with the Bun, pelted by tho rain, but here I must stay. Yes, I havo had enough of short cuts." Fred gazed in bewildered astonishment. " But what is your name ?" he gasped at length. "My name ? I had almost forgotten it; it is Fred Miller. Ah !no one would know Fred Miller if he saw mo now. But I know what Fred Miller never could havo believed of him self. I know that ho was a very foolish head strong boy, and thought more of his own opinion than anyone else did. I know that he thought himself very brave in venturing through the short cut alone ; but I know now that he was an arrant coward, and was afraid his cousins would laugh at him if ho gayc way. And I know also that he has been sorely punished for thoso faults." Fred started in terror to his feet, and found himself alone in the darkness, with the gloomy outline of the big fig- tree looming above him. Then his clear young voice rang out on the still night air in a coecy that waked the echoes of the lonely solitudea around, and in another moment an answering call came back to hira in a familiar voice that he knew too well to be mistaken, and with what glad ness he turned hia stops towards it! and after half-an-bour'amore struggling hewasabletoget free from tbe tangled brush and was met by his father and Walter and Dick, who were search ing for hira and quite closo to the place, where he had parted from his cousins. Fred was very quiet and humble over his mis adventure. Ho found plenty to think upon, and with real good sense set about mending some of the baa places in his disposition, and soon made the diacovery that by thinking little of himself he raised himself very considerably in the estimation of othera, which in no way detracted from hia happiness or pleasure in life. As to the ghost of himself that appeared to him in the short cut, he had no further trouble with that unhappy monster, and has no doubt it is quite at rest now along with the self conceit and ignorance ho baa buried by the wcll- Bpringa of knowledge and humility.
