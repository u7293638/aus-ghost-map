THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 1886. One of theatres of tliegcneiilolpc tion was the attempt to organise a Public Service vote Some 1 public Somco Committee appointed for the purpose issued a list informing the departments what candidates had pledged themselves to co-operate with the committee and requesting votes for these personages the list was a curious one Mr C L TONES Jh D GAUNSON "Mr L L Sunn JII Minim (North Melbourne), and Mr litiNWiiir were to obtain the sea vi of vot s Colonel SMITH, after his ] duration Office ex pensioner, was done for with enthusiasm, and the famous statement of Mr JfmAMS about overseas seems to have won him sympathy The public servants were urged to keep Jif T L Pmiitsov out of Parliament, and to excludes LvNriuDoi andJIrRoniiiT CArry R, Jil CirAitris Saving and Jfr Bosisto Tor did Mr MUNRO. find favours the eyes of the committee the Ministry was severely dealt with 'The name of Jil German does not appeal in the favoured list, and Messrs NIMMO and Wynn it were to be ostia cased 'the Public Service Association, we are glad to say, promptly disavowed the document, and the committee " appointed a i the per 'pose' have not thought proper to disclose their identity They are wise in their generation no doubt for it may be presumed that then can action with the State would not be long continued after the disclosure the attempt to bribe candidates by promising them Mippoi t independently of their politics, if they would undertake to grant the votes certain books, is as bad as the abrogated system of patronage itself the incident shows how the old leaven is capable of working in the body the Victorian patronage mongers have friends in every) department The demonstration, abortive as it was, will open many people eyes to a danger in the way of a possible new combination But it ought not to prejudice the claims put forward with moderation by the Public Service Association ] of these a fair hearing may be claimed The leaders of that body it must be remembered, have affirmed their hearty sympathy with the principle of the act and all that they ask for is that the new system shall be eased in places where it pinches And of course a perfect system is not to be expected except as the result of many endeavours, and it is for the supporters of the same patronage principle to see to it that the great scheme is not rendered unpopular by incidental errors of machinery which have nothing to do with it in this spirit we hope the amending bill drafted by the association will be con- sided The first proposal it can this certainly ought to be conceded At present in officer classified under the old net retains his old mere ments so long as he remains in the class in which he is found , but if he is promoted to another class he comes under the new scale of increases As it was not intended to, take away any rights of privileges by the new act (There is force in the contention that the classified officer is entitled to the old late of increases during the whole of his career The second and li cation is to abolish the fifth, 01 lowest, class of the service The effect of this arrangement would be that whereas now a fifth class officer has to wait until there is a vacancy in the foul til class for promotion, all the employ s would go up to the head of the fourth class as a matter of course, by annual increments According to the scheme every officer in the ordinary division of the service on attaining the age of 38 years would be receiving an munno of Li 6 per annum irrespective of the value of the work he is denied before coming to a decision on the subject, Parliament in the interests of the taxpayer, will have to ascertain what additional charge this concession involves an amendment of the antis ] lade Wednesday clause is also proposed Section 70 protects The officer from summary dismissal by Ministers but allow s the commissioners to ' dispense with the. ser ' vice of any officer ' the idea of course is to veto a political laid, but to allow "seasons bad bargains to be drafted out Some Safety Valve is necessary, and it has one is dispensed with another check will atomic to be devised, and the association may be asked to suggest an alternative scheme A proposal that any officer who has attained the age of 10 years and who has served not less than 20 years shall be entitled to retire upon a gratuity of one month ] ty for every year of service is one we should like very much to see adopted Dissatisfied men could then withdrew We should get rid of veteran grumblers, and promote a would be more rapid of those that remained the permission sought to be obtained, that the public servant shall be at liberty to engage in private work outside of the office hours would create a storm in the community Parliament would not debate the proposal and so apart from its merits it may be set aside the association desires a new insurance scheme and it is to draft proposals, which we are sure will be fully and if possible fa notably seen sidered The provision that no officer shall say control quarter which It is compelled to occupy by the nature of his duties is to be cordially approved of Un, rule is really in operation to day, but there is no objection to the value of the quarter is not being stated in addition to the salary as is now done the cm. comes with clauses of the proposed amending bill proMising that my officer dissatisfied with his classification shall be allowed an i appeal to a board, to be appointed by the Governor in Council Ivo more delicate question will come before Par lenient than this Outside boards, it must be remembered, would not have the peel of enormously increase the cost of the service before the eyes The) could be as generous as they, pleased, and the Government can small ask responsible gentlemen to make ILCOIII mendations which might play ducks and drakes with the revenue yet h n members and the community will be unwilling that the service should contain any large number of men who will be brooding over a classification grievance The stage tion of some feasible working compromise would be a real) welcomed Considering the case from this standpoint, we would ask if test cases, affecting the l option of classes could not be mitted to a board of appeal? The Government would then consider the recommendations, and the commissioners would apply to the individual cases whatever rules might be finally adopted James valuable work, 'Ihr Estate III in Ntl

A question of law was reserved at the trial as to whether the report was privileged lines question was recently argued before the Full Court and the decision of the Court was that the report was not privileged I he jury had assessed the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled in the event of tin reported being privileged at one farthing An application was made to Mr Justice Williams on behalf of the plaintiff to enter up judgment for him for one farthing and costs.
