SEQUEL. TO A GHOST ^ STORY* As a venerable minister rells this story j it would be ungracious and superfluous to adduce further evidence of its truth fulness. ' I went to a new parish j that year, '.he relates. ' In looking j about for a house I came upon a hand some residence tbat was charmingly sicuatea. J3ui every tuiug juuicawu that the place had long been without i a tenant, and I made inquiry. The | house was haunted, according to neigh bourhood tradition, and no one would I rent it. I saw the landlord, and he was glad to let the plaoe on easy terms. It would be worth much to him if I j would exorcise the ghost placed there by popular superstition. We moved j in and I admit that we had a very i creepy experience â€” one that my wife I could not long have endured. When every thing had settled down to the quiet of the night we would frequently I hear the most distressing moans and the Bound as of Bome one walking heavily in the attic, I made several visits to that gloomy part of the house, but could find nothing to account for the uncanny noise. The next night that we were disturbed I went up there with a determination to fathom the mystery. And I did it. The moans were produced by the soughing of the wind through the district telegraph wires that were numerous on one side, of the roof. The 'heavy walking' was accounted for by a loose slate, flapped by the same winds that did the moan ing. Next morning I had the wires removed and the roof repaired.' ' And that was all ?' 'Not quite. The landlord at once advanoed my rent one hundred per cent.' .
