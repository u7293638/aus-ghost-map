THE SECPT OF BiRI(i¥O£. ' CHAPTER IIL ' Loot here,' Mr. Barclay ; you're shrewd enough, I'm thinking. Let me '/alone: I'll leave you alono. I'm pleased to «eo you, and you're welcome to all I ; have/ and to, go fishing with Kathleen as long as' you like ; but don't you in terfere with ine and the drink,' because it'B the best friend I have in the world, and' the only friend that will never betray Joe,' .As he said these words, Kathleen eatered;.and; pat down^aibwek bottle be ? side him iii 'silence. ' Good girl,' he said, seizing her unwilling hand — ' good ;.; girl 1. you know! what your old father likes, don't you? ;. and ? if we're poor, . and wretched, and alone, we have still a . sixpence' to spare for the whiskey. Mr. 'Barclay, your health !'??'. ? . Thoroughly disgusted, I was about to ' say, gbodrbye to my incorrigible host, ,and then and there shake the dust of his house from my feet, when I caught a glance from Kathleen, so broken-hearted, so, humble; that a man must have been a stone to remain impervious. I restrained the words of farewell that hovered on my lips, and quietly left the room. I sauntered into the ? yard, kicking at the sturdy ? weeds-%hile I meditated, and ,'? dislodging them with infinite satisfaction from '...'.their grim clinging to the bits:-of 'earth between the.rough irregular stones. Kathleen's look had decided me. The .girl meeded my help, I was sure. Per haps she meant to make a clean breast of her last night's adventure. to. me after all : perhaps 'she was scarcely so much to blame as in the first moment of irritation Iliad : fancied. ' The sound of a step \' roused': me. I looked up. Kathleen stood there with the sun shining on her 'bright brown hair* causing it to look like ' burnished gold, and. holding in her arms a .small white kitten. . -.ouuii. nc gu tu due luiua, i-xi. ^Barclay?' she asked, in quite a natural .manner ;; 'I should like, to show them to you.' ... , .?

I asked, sauntering slowly beside her. Kathleen's walk, erect, - active, and '?: springy, with the grace of a Nile peasant, whose bearing would shame that of most ladies, was one of her greatest beauties. I could watch that lithe figure, with the'J broad '. hips and fine sloping shoulders, to my heart's delight as . she. moved on a little before me, turning eagerly 'round now and the'n: to enforce her remarks with ai look.: If I had ever doubted the advantages of natural grace and- unfettered activity over the strained and padded stiffness of a town belle, I ?; was convinced of: it now. . That' elastic ' step, that fine carriage of body, ithose well-made limbs, were born of open air r and exercise, and of. the health given by [?'. mountain breezes and simple habits. ? ^'Poor little Kit,' said Kathleen, ' it : ; is so 'fond of me; it follows me about the garden. But you would find it tire some.' '?Vyhy, am I such a bear?' ' Sure, no ; but you're a man, and ? men weary of the little things we women .viike.' ' ? _ '. ' ? '.?;.... ;? ?' .'-'Indeed,' I said, wondering at her ?profound philosophy. This little girl ;\;Was no fool ; oven in her' immorality she ? i would be consistent, I felt sure. 'Here stood the old abbey,' she said, now coming to a halt among the ruins, .', which were almost choked by a wilder-' rtness of aggressive brambles, burdock,. !?:? mulleins, and dock-leaves. ' You can :- see the pointed window of the chapel, and there was the sacristy with the small side- door, and yonder the monks' garden.

' Are there any legions about this -.place?' I asked, wishing to divert her thoughts from sad recollections. ' No 'wonderful- tales of saints, or martyred monks, or ghosts ? There should be ghosts here, I think.' ' There are ghosts at Barravoe,' said 'Kathleen, lowering her voice, as though i: the ghosts could hear and would take -?..offence. ' I've seen them.' '? ? ??What?' I asked; leaning on my atick and looking incredulously into her faco. To me, whose life had been passed among sober business people, and in tho practical realities of everyday life, ghosts and spirits seemed a vanished super stition of the middle ages. ' You don't believe me; I see,' she said, and a shade . of vexation passed over her fair forohead ; ' but I've heard — oh, such strange things ! and I've jeen— — ' ? ; ' (To be Continued.)
