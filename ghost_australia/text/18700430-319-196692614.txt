I have if I lost sight of my runaway, husband, again ? No, no ; I shall be jhappy with him ..;. and.if, bythe time we get back tpjndia, I.have not had ' a long sea-voyage,' the ;dockirs must have prescribed something which it, is impossible-, for -a poor patient to take.' So, ,ox\r happy meeting was. short, and tho ' fare 'well' came , by far too soon ; but tho tears that wore, shed at the parting were not all sad. '(Brother,; Ned,' said Mary, as we stood on the deck,(of the steamer at Southampton, and the 'order., Ayas- given for the return to the shore — 'jBrdther Ned, I don't think dear Jenny will fret so long .for Jack ; and when you have found a husband for, her, nobody will wish him moro hap piness .than Jack's wife.' - Thon we were over the sidp, and|thosteamer. was moving away ; and whon wo could., no longer seethem or return their signals pf adiou, ,m.other forqed a little laugh, and asked : 'CPpcs anybody, here want to go to India ?'. ' Not . I/.for. .one,' tsaid Cousin Jonny, drying 'her eyes, [it - last. , . ' Nor I, for another, ' said I. And it' is 'just as -woll; that neither of us did ; for af tjcr ,, a iyhile, when, the year was nearly, round iigaiii,' ,1 began to wonder whether. I might havo hop'p.s. of Cousin, Jenny, after . all.. Not that I mustered^ courage, even then, to run the risk of another , . rebuff, by , asking any straightforward question; but, I ventured, pno day to say to my inbthbr : ',Po you think that Jenny is still in thu saine mind .about Jack, as she was bofore Mary iiri-jycd V' '„'.' Well, upon iny word, Ned, you arc a Iqpl ! was the old lady's eiuphatic reply. ; I'should have preferred a more . explicit an swer, or, at all events, something in the way of enlightenment on the subject to which my ques tion; had .referred; but this I found it impossiblo to obtain ' from that ? quarter. . So there was nothing for .it but to appeal to Jenny herself ; and1 this at .'last I managed to do, though in a somewhat' roundabout way. I'm quito conscious that I did not deserve any success ; but there arc some things in this world that go by favor. No doubt r was a vory stupid kind of confessor; but, for all that, and in mercy and compassion for my manifold shortcomings, Jenny made a full and clear confession, that was by no means terri ble to hear. Orthodox vows were inado, and scaled with a vory agreeable formality. j _'But; Ned, you are a terrible goose,' said Jenny, 'or you would have found it : all put sooner.. Why, how, did' you suppose I could think, any more about Jack, after I saw what a slave ho was to Mary 1— as indeed he ought to be, for she'sr the dearest creature that - ever way ; and I'm very glad she's going to be my sister-in-law, as well as-, yours. Besides, when, I really came to under-1 stand myself, I found that I could never bo,26n-r tent with a quarter of a heart, and that I, was' just intended to throw myself away on a dcar,1 good, faithful goose like— like you.' ' ? Well, well; it was all arranged, and I don'ti want tobe any happier than I am. All the pre liminaries were settled a long time ago; and thero: |was another visit to St. John's ; on which occa-' 'sion I . had the satisfaction of appearing in the 1 pharacter , of the bridegrom. There is a letter, ;from India, announcing tho arrival of a junior, ;Ned in Brother; Jack's bungalow, as the baby-, 'brother of ' little Mary,' who was born a year ;and a, half ago ; and the best ' home , news' , is . that a junior Jack— a miniature edition of all niy ; virtues and personal beauties, revised and cor-; - rected by 'Mrs. Ned'— better known in the ? family as 'Cousin Jenny'— is at this moment; crowinglustilyin my wife's arms. ' I've onjy two things to say of myself, by way of ! parting egotism,, and in these I believo Mrs. Ned will agree :. first, that,. on the whole, I do not sot; up to be as clever or as worthy a porsonasiny brother Jack : but, secondly, that in.one respect I think myself more meritorious than even'he— in- ? ' that, wheri, Cousin Jenny condescended to go to St. John's tho second time, I certainly did not: keep her' Waiting in the Church.' r
