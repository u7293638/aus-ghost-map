" POETRY. ' . i- 9 ROMANCE. My loye dwelt in a Northern land l_4- di tower in a forest green Was i his, and far away .the sand: y- gray wash of the waves -was seen \- The woven forest hougha-between ; . And through the. Northern summer night v The sunset slowly died, away, And herds of strange deer, silver- white, n Came gleaming through the forest gray, , And fled like ghosts before the day. . And oft, that month, we watched the moon vWax. great and white o'er wood p,nd lawn, And wane, with waning of the Jnne, ' v Till, .like a brand for battle drawn, . ;. She-fell, and flamed in a wild dawn. T know not if the forest green Still girdles round that castle gray, I. know not if the bonghs between. The white deer vanish ere the day ; The grass above my Love is green ; .His heart is colder than the clay. â€” andbew Laso.
