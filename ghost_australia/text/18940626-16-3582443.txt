CHEAP MONEY. III. By X. Y. Z. In the preceding articles an effort has been made to outline the mortgage system of the Continent-the loans repayable over a long series of years by easy instalments, bearing but a slightly higher rate of interest than the Government itself can borrow for, covered by a security equal to that of Government stock, and involving no fixation of capital on the I part of the reader, for his letters of mortgage are as easily negotiable as Government stock or short dated bills of exchange. It is this system which has raised the age culture of the Continent to its present proud pinnacle of prosperity It enabled the French vignerons to lose the colossal sum, according to Meyer's Encyclopaedia, of X540,000,000, through the ravages of the phylloxera, and yet face Fortune with an undaunted front It has been written, "If the plough has a silver share, the spade has a golden edge " If so, the great alchemist who has tipped the share with silver and the edge of the spade with gold is this great system of co- operative finance Contrast this with our miserable system of obtaining short dated deposits and re lending them on I longer terms than the institution itself borrows for, on the miserable assumption that fresh deposits will counterbalance the fixation of capital and withdrawals-a policy foredoomed to inevitable disaster Then, again, contrast the Continental co-operative agriculturist, borrowing upon the credit of all the land of his district, upon as good as Government security, and repaying the loan by easy instalments spread over a long period of years Contrast him with the Australian squatter or agriculturist, borrowing upon his individual credit at 8, 9, or 10 per cent for short dates, liable to be called upon to repay the principal at its due date, or he foreclosed upon How can our producers borrowing upon these disadvantageous terms hope to compete in the markets of the world? Then consider the impetus which would be given to industry, the employment which could be found for wealth producing labour, if a considerable, portion of the capital, which is the life blood of commerce which is now Bunk, fixed, dead, being locked up in unrealisable securities could be released and made to pulsate vigorously through the veins and arteries of the body politic. Think well on these things, and then consider well THE REMEDY There are features in the Continental system which are inapplicable to young colonies. The question is how to adapt the best features of the Continental system of co-operative finance to our needs The solution of the problem has been briefly outlined in a little pamphlet by Mr H L E Ruthning, which deserves to be better known " The Principles of Banking as applicable to Agricultural and Pastoral Settlement " It will suffice for the purpose of these articles to briefly review the solution of the problem suggested therein SOLUTION First and foremost should come the creation of the Credit Foncier of Queensland in order that its letters of mortgage should be freely saleable, the example of Continental Governments should be followed by the Queensland Government, and the interest payable on the letters of mortgage should be guaranteed by the State for a limited period All that the institution would require is power to elicit the confidence of the investing public at the outset, after a very brief period the institution could safely be emancipated from State aid of every kind. The difference between the State aid extended to the great producing industries through the medium of a Credit Foncier and that sought to be given by the Sugar Works Guarantee Act and similar statutes already passed, or hereafter to be passed, is simply this the State assistance required by the Credit Foncier would be for a period of at the most two or three years, and the amount of the liability could be ascer- tained beforehand to a penny, while the operation of the Sugar Works Guarantee Act involves a perennial charge upon the Treasury, practically unascertainable in amount, for the political exigencies of the Ministry will act like a valve, increasing or contracting the flow. Furthermore, it is now the accepted policy of the M'Ilwraith Cabinet to extend State aid to the great producing industries. Our industries must be forced in order to pay the enormous foreign indebtedness, and even if this were not the case the extension of State aid would still be necessary to compensate for the enormous sums of productive capital locked up for long periods under various reconstruction schemes This is admitted by all political parties, and the question is now restricted to this-In what form can State aid be extended to the great producing industries with a minimum of risk to the Treasury and a maximum amount of benefit to the producers? The answer undoubtedly is by means of the foundation of a Credit Foncier, for the following reasons -(a) The security is the best possible, and therefore there is the least probable danger of the State being called upon to make good any deficiency under its guarantee. The first security is the productive lands improved by the loan to the full amount of the loan, the second the paid up capital of the institution and the State can at any time recoup itself from those sources for any sums advanced to meet the interest due on the bonds of the Society in its early days This additional security of a paid up capital, which could, if necessary, be levied upon by the State does not exist in the case of loans advanced direct by the State to sugar planters under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, claimed by the Ministry to be the most beneficent measure passed last session. Again, the board of the Cr√©dit Foncier is not under direct Government control, though the Government would be represented thereon. Political advances would therefore be tabooed, and the board will be obliged to make its advances on strict business principles, in accordance with the statutes, which eschow advances on city properties and speculative advances pt every description further, any sound system of finance the primary object of which is to foster i industry is deserving of some countenance and support from the Government. It is undeniable that the Credit 1 Foncier is bound by the terms of its charter to charge only a small specified increment upon the late of interest at which it itself can borrow at, in other words, the Credit Foncier of Queensland would be bound by law not to charge more than, say, 5 per cent Hence it is a by stem of li inking designed primarily in the nation sts of the borrowers that is, the producers of the colony-and not in the interests of absentee shareholders It is respectfully submitted that these cogent considerations entitle the institution to some small measure of Government support On Friday last a most enjoyable concert was given at Dunwich, unique in its character, inasmuch as till no overtures, with only two exceptions, we o inmates of the asylum The concert was got up by Mr Phil Agnew and Miss Dennett, the matron, the latter acting as accompanist throughout, 'the association of Mr Agnew's name with the undertaking was a sure guarantee of its enjoyable nature In the first part there were fifteen sentimental and comic songs very creditably rendered, some of the singers possessing excellent voices, notably Mr Gardiner, who gained great applause for his rendering of " The old log cabin and " When the cruel war is over The second part included a dance by " Mrs.' O'Grady, and the whole concluded with a grand spectacular finale, " The houses Ghosts " The programme, a fine piece of penmanship, was the work of one of the inmates The concert created much exotic | ment on the island, and the projectors are entitled to great credit for providing such a I pleasant means of distracting the minds of the inmates from the monotony of their loved life, and the hope was everywhere expressed at the establishment that this will be the precursor of many such pleasant evenings,
