The amount that passed through the totalizator was £5,053 10s.', which was just £100 short of the suth invested at the Spring Meeting last year. The racing was noted for several surprises which cropped up, the consequent result being that some healthy dividends were recorded,. The biggest was paid over the first event, the Trial Stakes, in which backers of LongboW received £2119s. in return for their sovereign. The Idler was served up very warm, but he just failed to catch Bridal Morn and Longbow, and had to be content with third place. The half-sister to Tradition led Longbow into the" straight, but after an interesting set-to Patterson's gelding wore her down, and beat her by half a length, while the favourite missed second honours by a neck. The Rector made his reappearance, but he was not fancied by his party? and ran nowhere. The absence of Conscript in the Hurdle Race did not occasion surprise, as it was reported on the previous day that he was to be reserved for the Si ring Handicap. With, him out of the road Itosedale, who was making her debut over the small sticks in public, was entrusted with the most money. She had acquitted her self creditably over the schooling hurdles, and Mr. Mallen was pretty confident she would score in this company. His confidenco in lier was not misplaced, as she won pretty comfortably from Snowdrift after Holmes had ridden her very vigorously between the five and three furlong posts to gist on terms with the lenders. Home Rule was going well until he jumped over the rail into the course instead of negotiating the hurdle af ter rounding the Stand turn. Another maiden performer was Happy Jack, and he was conspicuous for a time, but he tired away to nothing, and he evidently requires a littlo moretimoatthegame. Fifteenoutofthesixteen coloured on the card in the Flying Handicap passed the scales, and My Novel was voted the pick of the bunch, she carrying double as much in tho machine as Diadem, who was the next in demand. She and Helena, however, were badly placed at the start, which militated considerably against her chance of success. Electric, on the other hand, jumped off the mark first, and never again being headed won easily by a couple of lengths, paying a dividend of £11 3s. Electric is the horse which could not get a place in the Trial Stakes at Kapunda the pre vious week, but later on won the Flying Handicap, his two performances calling for an enquiry by the Stewards which has not yet been decided. On Saturday fie put npa7-lb. penalty. The same farce was enacted in connection with the Steeplechase as took place in the Kapunda Steeplechase. Eclipse was a decided favourite, and being only one of two to go the course correctly he won by over a furlong, Young Lucifer coming to grief at the last jump when on terms with the winner. Postal and The Ghost declined the first obstacle, while later on Repetition baulked and Strike ran off. Wood field did not make a mistake, but he was so 3low that I10 only just beat Young Lucifer for second place after tho latter had been remounted. _ Trout found most favour for the Spring Handicap, but he was never dangerous, the places being filled by the three outsidersof theparty, theactual winner being supplied in My Novel. The success of Carlton's sister occasioned as much surprise as tho failure of the favourite, M.ompa, and Conscript, as it was thought she would find tho mile a bit too far for her. In spite of his missing the Trial Stakes, tho Idler was again selected as favourite for the Totalizator Handi cap, but he was seen to less advantage than lie was earlier in the afternoon. The race pro vided the most exciting finish of the day, Bridal Morn, who battled on more gamely than she did in her first encounter, defeating the well-supported Doubloon by a nose.

At the fence at the three-furlong post Repetition baulked, while at the first of the quadruple Strike ran off. The race was from this point reduced to a match between Eclipse and Young Lucifer, the latter just getting his head in front as they negotiated the stone wail, where Strike and Woodfield were following 100 yards in the rear.
