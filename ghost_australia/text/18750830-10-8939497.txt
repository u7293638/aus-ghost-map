THE GHOST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY, Sir-Your harmless correspondent, "Mathinna's Ghost," would have afforded much more amusement to the gaping public had he only written his own signature at the foot of his literary production, instead of sneaking into your columns under cover of a shadow. There is evidently something of the hammer-Btoaling about his character, and therefore, I class him as belonging to the same genius as that winning hypocrite Seto," who had stealthily attacked Mr. David Lewis in the same column as that which was found by the Ghost. It may be immaterial, but for my own part I endorse every sentence uttered by the hon. member for Clarence on the Sunday question, and would add that we have far too many " loose professors " of the Soto type amongst us, whilst there is a pitiful scarcity of " Christian charity and true religion." As for " the old Bible " referred to by " Soto," I think it would be well to leave that hook along the Old Testament at all events until the company now engaged in England revising it, have made its pages more readable by our children and ourselves. Yours obediently, J J. W. GRAVES. August 27th, 1875.
