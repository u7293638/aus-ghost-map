DEAN STANLEY ON CHRISTIANITY AND ULTRAMANTANISM.* (From the Contemporary' Review ) THERE are two theories respecting the modes by Christianity is believed to have been prop» jftn the world One theory is that it has been ¿times and places propagated by a corporation or ¿of men who have been the exulusive depositaries of its truths, and also the exclusive expounders oí A and that the other elements ef Christendom ¿lus outside of this-not indeed as wholly use ? bat ai irregular, subordinate, intrusive forces ¡otter theory is that Christianity is propagated irf one particular corprration or order of men, but Adjoint influence of all good elements in human La. and in the order of the world, working to AJJ', that it is not through asy one form of polity Kthio-ßh *U tlie Tanov,B lnstitutione and charas Ljjd of Ohrutendom that the advance of truth and '(.cbother Perhaps noone has held either of ! with absolute eonsistencj , nor does either of jinn exactly parallel with the great external see . ef ecclesiastical or social life The former ,- hu been held by the Ultramontane section of gunin Catholic Church, and has been latelv put À nth much vehemence by a well known advocate r-iil icheol, and has also been supported in vary ...rrrets amongst the more rigid English Noncon Lu and Scottifh Free Churchmen oswell as in -du* of the so called Anglo Catholic divines of _ Bnghth Church All these have been Jjj. claimed as alhee by thosp advocates Tjjje Ultramontane creed who maintain that rat Independence and supremacy of the Christian Church cannot be denied without denying the Christian revelation ** It IB,'-* such is the allega fj.-itiictly relevant to bring forward Anglicans .Lfjtrttnsni, I ree Kirk men, and Nonconformists, ?nftoac' t0 tto importance of spiritual mdepend ^tiov the civil power To these allies might AjhT* been added the philosophical or indifferent politicians, whether in the Liberation Society of Eng land, the French school of Auguste Comte, or the Italian statesmen who have adopted Cavour's maxim of 'a free Church in a free State."

' the powder which, according,,o the general instinct of mankind, and according tq the language both of the Old and New Testament, hu been placed at the head of human affairs The question was really fought and decided in the struggle over the Constitutions of Claree dop. It was alleged on the part of Hecket, as on the part of many high ecclesiastics of that time, that no clerk ought to be subject to civil jurisdiction for dimes or misdemeanors It has in our day been often pleaded on his behalf that in him was repre- sented the coûte of spiritual independence If so, then in him the cause of spiritual independence was entirely lost Net only in Protestant communities, but in Catholic-not onlv by Eraatiaus, but by Ultramontane s and Free Churchmen, Is the elaim which Recket put forth universally surrendered lhere is not now, in any country of Europe, any clergyman who would desire-much less claim as a right-to be exempted from the protection, or from the jurisdiction, of the law of hu country, if assailed by others, or if himself accused of crimes against society 1 he principle of the Constitutions of Claren don hss become the law of Europe-that is, the law* of Christendom It lies deep m human nature and in the essence of Christianity It is the principle that in the great institutions of society there is nothing "common" or '. unclean," that the natural ordi nances of the family and the State are as truly ' oi dein ed of God" as those that are more strictly cccleiiSBtical, that in this sense " the nation is greater than the Church "-that is, the nation in the lense of a fociety comprehending all the diverse elementa of loctal liib ii greater then the Church, in the sense of the clerical corporation which, great and beneficent as it is, comprehends only a few li. But it may be said that those elements of truth which the ecclesiastical corporation represents are BO much more precious, that they invest it with a moral supeiiority to which the more general factors of human society cannot lay claim It is possible that a tune mightecome, or that times may have been, when this superior claim of the clergy over the whole body of BOcicty may have been manifested, or may hereafter manifest itself If ever, and whenever, that time should orme, then it might be worth while torecon tider our position Rut looking to the experience of the past, the beneficent action of the clergy or of "the spiritualty," is not so Belf evident as to support the immense superstructure built upon it 1 skin g again the case of General Councils as the most complete instance-the voice not only of Pro testant theologians, but of all impartial historians bears the same testimony, that " when they be gathered together, forasmuch as they bo an assembly of fallible men, whereof all be not governed hy the Spirit and Word of God, they may err, and sometimes have erred, not only m matters of ceremony, but va thisgB pertaining to God ' There is much, no doubt, to be end in behalf of those great ecclesiastical assemblies But when their decrees are Bpokcnofas "undoubtedly the voice of the Holy Ghost, ' and when they are described as " the organs of the active infallibility of the Church,' it may be worth while to ask what they have done or not done, for the permanent spiritual good of man kind? The Council of Nicæa -What is there that actually remains to UB from that venerable assembly î A creed which, however good in itself, was for the mostj part not composed by the Council, but merely adopted by it-which, since its adoption, has boen altered, mutilated, and interpolated in points which at tbe lime were thought essential to it «o that in no single church in Europe is it uow recited BB once delivered and of which tho only word of importance thattWB6 inserted by the Council was adopted asi meia party move, and was afterwards hardly e\er used by Athanasius, its chief champion The Canons oi l^icEca -Of the whole twenty moBt are merely temporary, and of these which axe not some are [wholly disregarded and hardly one strictly. observed. Even of the one which at first sight ¡.eenie to have obtained general acceptance, that on the .observance of Easter, it has been slid by a learned Roman Catholic writer that " the Gregorian Calendar cannot be observed without running counter to thb whole spirit of the Nicene Council ' Of the Couijcil oi Constantinople, everyone knowe wha. waa ¡.aid -of its strange proceedings by the bishop who presided, Gregory lNazianzen, and of its acts nothing is now cherished except a portion of a creed which it certainly did not compose The Council of Ephesus -lhere remain« from its violent and discreditable cinflicts cnlythe famous word Tkeotokot, which has not beru deemed worthy of acceptance in any Pro testent Church The Council of Chalcedon -How miny Clnistian pastors in any Church have gone to ita atoimy debates or its ambiguous decisions for the j uipfcie of refreshing their spiritual life > Or let UB pats to the later Councils The Council of the Lateran gave us its sanction of Transubetan uation and of the Albigcneian Crusade, of which the first U only accepted b) the Roman Communion, and that m very diverse senses, and the second is sow not accepted by any The Council of Constance - Read in Milman's History of Latin Christianity the comparative treatment of the three Johns-the Warne tess John Huss burnt alive the infamous John Petit and the infamous John XXII with difficulty con demncd, almost condoned Or read the stern judg- ment of Hallam— It will be easy to weigh the re- trenchment of a few abuses o gainst the formal sane- , Uon of an atrocious maxim ' The Council of Trent -It effected, no doubt many useful reforms of prac tical abuses , but do its acts contain anything like a code of permanent and universal truth ? The Council of the Vatican, the largest ever held, and the least re b train ed by the external world -Its two decrees threw no new light ou any single subject Its chief declarations aie either disbelieved or explained away even bj many of those who profess to accept them Ana, on tho other hand, now many are the good TA ordX and works in which the Councils have bad no part »li he Creeds -As we have said, even the Nicene cr Constantinopolitan Creed is m substance the creed not cf* a Council but of Eusebius and Epiphaniu« - Ihe Apostles Creed, and, with all its ment* and demerits the Athenasian Creed, is not sane tioncd by any Council at all. The Cation of Scripture -It was not adopted, or Banetion d, or explained by any Council until the Council of lient, and the decision of that Assembly, recouru tag as authorised only the received version of the Vul(,ite no educated man, either Roman Catholic or Pro en ant, can in tbe present day accept Theologii -Is there any single theological question winch nay Council or Synod hss argued or decided with an tibillity equal to that of any of the great theologi ins, lay or clerical ' The nearest appproach to it art. the chapters on Justification in the decrees of Trent, and on the Bible in the Westminster Confession 1 ut how inadequate to the needs of the case, how uifeuor to the, truly inspired utterances of individual genius I -to the enlightenment of the world by Origen by Jeronie.by Augustine, by Dante, by Hooker, by Bat in by Thomas & Kemp», by Bossuet by Luther ? 1 he formation of the bymnology, or of the music, or of the liturgy, or of the morals of Christendom-all these were the works of public opimos, of genual inannoV» or of gifted individuals -not tho work cither of a general council, or of the corporate or synodical action of the clergy as euch . It is exactly in the capacity of guiding and instructing the world that these (Corporate meetings havo most signally failed The spirit of the corporation has prevailed, nnd this has occasionally produced results of moderation, of compromise, and of local reform Rut it is very rarely that this corporate action has men to the level of the eternal and vivifying truth which commends itself to tho universal conscience of mankind What is true of the Councils is true also of the Popes No one would say that the occupants of the papal chair have been the chief intellectual or moral oracles of mankind, with the exception of Leo the Great and Gregor) the Great in early times, and of Benedict X1T m later times, there is hardly a single Pontiff who ranks with the luminaries whose writing« have enlightened (ho Church But it is unnecessary to refute a chum which is not maintained except with so many rcier/rations ns to deprive it of any meaning It is enough to state the well known fact that whilst Borne brilliant examples of courage, generosity, nnd tolernnce have been placed before the world on the pontifical throne, these have been counterbalanced by on average of mediocrity and by excesses of wicked nets not surpassed in any European monarchy It is enough to ask, whether, whilst there have been many bulls giving the pontifical sanction to the pernicious doctrines of the unlawfulness of usury, and of the belief in witchcraft—there have been any repudiating those doctrines? The general influence of tho clergy on European society has, doubtless, contained elements" of the purest beneflcence Guixot, Arnold, Carlyle, even Hallam in bia severely judicial chapter on

eon vccatiors, general aieemblies or synods, Christianity would have ceased to exist It may bo worth while briefly to enumerate the elements which go t/i make up the ¡best patt of Christianity, and with which none of those ecclesiastical institutions had any, or if any, only the minutest, connection He whole literature of Christendom-poetry, his tory, j hilosophy, hymnology, science theology, except a few isolated fragments of theological spéculation is the result of agencies quite independent of Pops or Council The whole art of Christendom, from the Catacombs to Raphael, and from Raphael to Sir Jotbua Reynolds (unless we except the decision of the 7lh .Council in favour of the sacred Byzantine pio tures), is equally spontaneous end general in- its character 1 he whole of European legislation for at least the last 300 years hss been conduoted by assem- blies from which the ecclesiastical element was almost absent, or at any rate not predominant The charities end philanthropic institutions of Europe have bein fosteied by great ley philanthropies, by the founders of religious ordere, by philosophical Sovereigns, but only in exceptional cases by the desrees of Pontiffs, Cour eil s or ecclesiastical assemblies These (briefly Bpeaklng) are the " historical facts, in the fsce of which ' (to use the words of a celebrated Roman Catholic writer of the present day) " it is most difficult logically to maintain " the theory (to use the words of another writer of the same communion) of the identity of " Ultrsmontanism witb Christianity as it has been held by all men in all ages, by Catholics and Protestants alike ' No doubt UltrsmontaniBm, like Calvinism, like Pelagianum like Methodism, like Quakerism, is one clement m the development of Christianity, and has produced many fervent and zealous spirits But to maintain that it has been held by "all Christians in all ages, Catholic and Protestant alike, is a state- ment as incorrect as it would be to assert the samo of CalviniEm, Methodism, or Pelagiantfm Np doubt Ultrsmontanism, whether amongst Catholics or Protestan a, is (in part at least) the e xogger at ion or distortion of on undoubted and in- estimable tiuth That truth is the nsiertion of the independence of the moral and spiritual being of men above any external force or authority , the exprestiion of the doctrine of the Emperor Charles Y, that " the conscience is an impregnable citadel"-the doctrine of the ApoBtles, that " we must obey God rather than man ' But this truth is obviously quite irrespective of the conflict between the civil and spiritual juna dictions It is quite as easy to be guilty of-unworthy -bUbmiBBion to external authority, m the case of the ecclesiastical, as of the civil power It is equally necessary to obey God rather than man, whether the wrong decision come from the supreme Csear ox, the supreme Pontiff Those who resist decrees of Councils or declarations of Popes which they do not btlihVe ere quite as truly vindicating the spiritual liberty of the Church and the supremacy of God and of conscience as those who resist unlawful demand« if tyranny or of democracy We repeat, therefore, whilst conceding to Ultrn montcnitro, whether Protestent or Catholic, its place emosgst the various elementa which have contributed to the foi motion of Christendom as it now exists, we entirely decline the alternative claimed by one party in a recent dispute, and not sufficiently repudiated by the other-t^at " TJltiamcntamem fe identical v ith Christianity " AN c cannot ollow a name io great and so
