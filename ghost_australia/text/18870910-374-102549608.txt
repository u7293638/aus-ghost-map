! : H A Beal Ghost Story. The NepeaD Times, (Penrith) states that on Tuesday, Aug. 19, Mrs. Small, presiding at Luddenham, about two ' miles from Penrith reported to Ser geant Pore that her son, aged 19 years, . onireturning home at about 12.30, that morning, saw a phosphorescent figure abofrt the size of an elephant and the . shape of a dog. This changed to a •'fiery circle shortly afterwards, and then to the figure of a man headless. 'The' young man became so terribly alarmed that he started oft home at a pace that would surprise even Samuels. 'He told his mother what he had seen, and on the following morning the two proceed edto the spot, where they saw . -the remains of a fire, and among the v ^debris, some burnt bones and other •things, which caused Mrs. Small to 'give information to the police. On "Wednesday, Sergeant Dove, accom panied -by Mounted-constable Belfour, WK to .Mrs. Small's residence, took them to the spot iffcer a search the sergeant 1 •polfeeted certain portions of the burnt deblfe^incluj^ng bones, &c.;, which he broogm^lto Penrith. The locality is deicxibed as in a very out-of-the-way place (gear the southern boundary of the "Itomestead run, ^uid ^sear the famous Filly Paddock, and about a mile and a half from the Luddenham road. Judging by all the surround ings, there is every appearance of a body being burnt, and what is most suspicious, within a few feet of the fire a hole had been dug about 6 feet long, about 2 feet wide, and about 18 inches deep, dug. by some blunt tool. This hole and the remains of the fire appear to be about two years stand ing, and the general impression is that, there has been some foul play. The police have made every necessaiy inquiry, but so far with out 'finding anything that would at all lead to identification. The bones were on Thursday examined by IJoctor' Brady and carefully compared, wifch-the resalt that the doctor at once pronounced the bones to be those of a human being.
