Captain,1' I said, with a half-ashamed and half-affrighted expression that I- knew well how to assume, "but'thisis a blanked nasty placé saving your presence." Then, with an uneasy glance at the gallery a glance which he intercepted in its passage -"Do you hear nothing there! I could »wear J «aw something move just aa you came down, and I admit I did think for a moment as how that all fired Tresillis.might havè^-ime.back." He laughed again, but my keen 'ears were4 not to be deceived, and I deteoted that I had aotutlly shaken him for a moment, and that bis ¡laugh rang a mere trifle .cracked and hollow, and having' impregnated him with myowd |eWS I knew tlint I bad satisfied;' him, and was safe. " Nonsense,'Bridger, you've been at Tre carrel's bottles' again," he returned, almost, savagely ; "butithis is serious, and I'll i just' have a look in there and see if any of. pur, fellows are playing pranks on the guanta.' If I find the joker I promise you PU bring him.up;with a round turn and a pistol ball in<:his jacket," and he strode towards the ^as^ge? drawing a pistol frony bis belt as he fflio 60.' ? ¿ > - ' \ Don't go away with the idea that I wil- fully put the Wrecker on the track pf the truant pair. That was the last idea I had in my mind, as I'would have given my own life if' needful 'to save tfiss^Ransome; and disappoint the vengeance of this'fiend, but I saw pnly^too:twell- that; his suspicions-were thoroughly aroused, ándth'at nothing short1 bf fomething tangible to go. upon would satisfyi.the snbtie Chief of; the gang» and remove his suspicions of myself, and besides aU this, it waa Impossible that the escaping pair could long remain in the passage, and I had given them all I was able-time to reach the cavern and hide-that is, all 1 could offer them without losing my life, for if they,were starved in thé place and took a fancy to come out and give themselves up/ where should I bet The Wrecker* would satisfy himself BB to who was on guard when they entered-.the gallery, and there would be an end of me and also of everyone in the mine. ^" God's truths captain," I said, springing forward. "-You--are surely not going to venture in there alone?" "Don't be a fool, Faro," waa the almost savage answer. " Give me your lamp." " Can I go down into the mine, captain ?" I eagerly asked ; " I don't want to stay here in the dark." " I dont care what you do," was the curt «?eply. " Go to the- if you like, but don't try to make me afraid of either Godot mari¡'^and 8eieingithe lightJfrom my hand he swung round on his heel and in another instant he had turned the first corner of the gallery and was lost to> view. For a moment I hesitated, and then remembering his words I chose to take them in the literal sense. He.had said he did not care what I did, so I would follow him and chance his seeing me, though I believed I was going to certain death, for if he happened to look behind him with those ey es of his, to which the darkness of the gallery would, be no.bar at all, he was quite capable of waiting' behind the first dark corner, and either kniting or shooting me on the spot and before I had an idea where he was posted. However, there was nothing else for it, and perhaps there might be a chance at him for Miss Ransome's sake, so I cocked my pistol and hurried on as fast as the darkness of that infernal gallery would permit me, whjlat my heart fairly thumped against my ribs every timo I had to turnacorner. At last, however, much to my relief, I saw his lamp twinkling like a distant star in the darkness far in front of me, and as he was very fortu- nately too much occupied with his own affairs to look behind, he failed to notice that I was following him. A little further and he entered the cavern, first setting down che lamp in the passage, then he brought np all standing, and 1 slipped around the nearest corner and watched his actions as well as I was able. Clearly he had seen something, there was no mistaking that fact, and, unpleasant though the inference was, I was bound to accept it. For a moment or two he stood thus, like a tiger ready to spring, and then stealing round the corner, crouching softly like a great cat, he disappeared from' my range of vision. Now came my greatest danger, for if I was to'know anything, orto be of any use in case of my friend's need, which was clearly approaching, I must reach that corner, with no cover of any kind and the possibility of meeting the Wrecker face to face at any instant. However, there was absolutely nothing else for it, and away I went; but when I reached my coign of vantage I quickly saw that there was no danger for myself at present, as the chief, still preserving his crouching attitude, was close to the opening in the sea-wall and engaged in approaching it as quietly and as stealthily as it was possible for him to do with no cover. Flying past him my eye lighted upon the aperture in which swung the giant door, and .my heart gave a great jump, for by the blaze of the torch which the foolish fellow still held in his hand. I could see Trccarrel standing with the light stretched out over the gulf, whilst just behind him was posted the young lady, with her gaze also directed downwards and out- wards, and still that murderous shape crept on. Ah, God, would they never see it. With a quick exclamation I lifted my pistol and. was about td" pull the trigger and fire a warning shot at all costs, when the doctor suddenly turned and saw the Wrecker. With a great shout he plucked a pistol from his belt and levelled it at his foe, but just then a most fearful catastrophe occurred, for, influenced by a gust of v»»»d wWMt- came breezing down the lagoon, the great door swung suddenly down- wards and shot Trecarrel into the watery gulf beneath, whilst the poor little girl ah, God of mercy, shall 1 ever forgot) it too late she saw the movement of the rock, and with the instinct of self- preservation tried to spring inside, and next second-my God, I can hardly write it-she Was flattened to pulp under the giant rock, which closed over her puny body as if it disdafned to even notice her existence. One wild, dispairing shriek she gave just as she saw her danger, and then, without, time for a prayer, she was in eternity. One great sickening sob I gave, and then, seeing the Wrecker turn in hie tracks, as if the sight was too much even for him, I wriggled myself back into the passage, blew out his light to detain him, and in an instant more I was fifing from the spot as if all the friends of hell were on my heels, but with my heart nearly bursting with grief. Thc girl was dead, of that unfortunately there was .no doubt, and it was a thousand chanccB to one that the doctor was dead also Indeed, in my rage I sincerely hoped so; for, dead or alive, his folly had brought to an early end and a horrible doom a sweet young girl, who would in all human pro- bability have been in a few days' time as free as air and at liberty to become his wife if he had not once again stepped in with his cureéd and foolish interference, and, as I said before, I devoutly hoped that he was dead and be hanged to him for a fool. I tell you I was down those ladders like a flash, but I was too fly to pads any sentinels and let them tall the chief that Í had just gone by. No, I stopped at the entrance to the passage which led to his own house/and w,ai ced till he came down. A glance showed that he was too full .pf thought and. far too preoccupied even to notice my presence or think of inquiring after me at the moment, 1 so I spoke : j " ïou've got back, then, Captain," I said. He faced round on me with a start, and I 'saw that his face was grey, and fairly drawn with horror. '.Yes, Faro," he said, speaking with an | effort, aB it were. Then, in a low voice, and grasping me by the elbow as he spoke, " Who do you think I found in there, eh ?" 11 Not his ghost, sir?" I said, with well affected terror. . " My God, no, I wish it had been. No, Trecarrel and Miss Ransome had by some infernally mysterious means got together in the disused part of the mine, and both fell down a shaft when they saw me, and are dead." Then seeing that 1 looked askance at him, '.'You are wrong. Faro," he said, impressively. "I never laid a finger on either of them, and though I have wished them out of the way many a time lately, I would give a good deal if this had not hap- pened. Not a word of this to anyone, and now good night," and turning off abruptly ' he entered his own passage, and I watched him stride aloug with bia chin on his breast, and lost in thought. It is strange what an effect the unexpected motion of God's hand has even upon the most hardened at all times Here was a man ,who, left alone, would in another moment have exulted pyer the corpses of two people, and been delighted ir he could haye seen them bleeding at his feet, and for ever out of his way, but just because a higher power steps in and sweeps them from the earth he is altogether taken by surprise, and ready to wish them back. That this mood of the Wrecker would last beyond next morning was too much to expect from a man like him, and I don't think I am far wrong, or that I am making him ont worse than he really was,, when 1 say that I am of opinion his corftrition was in effect the consequence of two facts which he feared would possibly affect him personally-one was what the men, already mutinous and grumbling, would hare to Bay about the death of Miss Ransome, who was a favorite with them all, and tbe other, still more important to him, was what his daughter would say when she found that Trecarrel was lost to her for ever-for let me here say that if the Captain cared for one person in the world it was for his lovely daughter Nina, and for her he would have released a dozen Trecarrel* if he could have seen his way to do BO without getting himself into trouble, or would have waded through ocean's of blood to secure her slightest desire-at least so they said in the mine, and small love had anyone there for the young lady in question, though they feared her more than they did the chief .himself. Both mother and daughter were, however, absent ia London ut present, and I could only suppose that Trecarrel had in consequence been badly guarded, and had .managed to get free and compass his own death and that o£ the girl he was so anxious to love and to protect with his life if need be. And I-how could I face old Sir Harry and tell him how she died? Gods, I felt like making a clean bolt of it, and washing iOiy hands of the whole business, for the wrecker was welcome to kill everyone in in the mino, and serve them right, now that Miss Ransome was lying a disfigured corpse above us, with the waves singing her eternal lullaby and none to say a reqniom.
