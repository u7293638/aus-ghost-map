" At last he started- up, and ultored a violent oath. ' "* " ''"•Curse him, let liini go," lie growled. Let'iiim try—. I defy him to—" ' '"Me' stopped 'mattering.' Then he went and poured out some more brandy. " What'-a' devil of a lrian. that Brown is," he said with a reckless,laugh, " and decidedly I think I will miss the old muff." .--..:.• On the morning after this scene, as Mr. Gartrell was di-iiikirig -brandy as usual, a step wasjheard upon r tlie portico, a knock resounded, and a moment; afterwards the attentive Jairies announced Mr. Jobson, who came into the apartment." ' At sight "of the lawyer. Mr. Gartrell assumed a stiff and formal air.' "You wish to" see me—Mr. Jobson, from Water ford, I think ?" '*." Yes, sir." . --. -• • - " Your business, sir ?'- Mr. Jobson had not been invited to sit down, but he now proceeded to do so, looking at Mr.' Gartrell over liis spectacles. • , " I called to see you once before, sir," he said quietly, " but did not find you at home. My business is to have a few words on the subject of the codicil to the late Mr. Cleave's will, which I beg to inform you before going further, was not worth the paper it was written on, as it was not witnessed." Thereupon Mr. Jobson proceeded, with great coolness, to business ; spoke of the extreme hardship of not releasing to George Cleave, after his magnanimous surrender of tlie estate, any portion of of it ; and ended by urging upon Mr. Gartrell as a course dictated by common propriety, some provision for his cousin. ' Mi-; Jobson had visited Mr. Allan Gartrell at an unfortunate moment—which does not., however, involve the statement tliat urider. any circumstances his course ^vpyid.have been other than that which lieuipw pursued.' ;. -" Curse my cousin,". said Mr. Gartrell, scowling,.

There was something so singular in his look that even Mr. Gartrell noticed it. : It might almost have been said Mr. Jobson was doing what he never did«i—smiling. . ' " What brought you, then, old parchment face ?" said Mr. Gartrell with a sudden access- of humor, due to the brandy; " any money in the affaii' do. youthink—eh !" ^•J expect none, sir." "Come, speak out, old black gown. Say half ; will that dot' Mr. Gartrell burst into sudden laughter,"adding: . , •-.- " Well, 1 see we can't come to an understanding- Have,,,some brandy, Jobson." \- * . Mr. Jobson politely declined and rose. " Mr. Gartrell," he said.quietJy, with the former ghost of a smile upon his thin lips, " I" do -not often throw away my time, but I have deliberately done so to-day, I see. I will not further trouble you on this business this morning. Is Mr."Brown hferei "A most worthy gentleman-^yonr And with the. air of a personage who has perpetr3t3d_-.au excellent jest, Mr..
