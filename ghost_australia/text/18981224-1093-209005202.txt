A GHOST WITHOUT A CHEQUE BOOK. It is a relief to turn-from a story of horror like this to a ghost which showed itself possessed of reasonable intelligence if not a sense of humor. Glamis Castle, the residence of . Lord and Lady Strath more, is, as everyone knows, notorious-., as the scene of the terrible.; events in "Macbeth"—and of course Glamis has its ghost. When Dr. Boyd was staying there he, like'all visitors to the CaStle,' heard' a • grear deal about the haunted room. It had been put about that the mention of it' was a painful subject in the family. Never Was ranker nonsense. In the morning the first thing the countess said to her guests was, "Well, have you seen the ghost?" The earl treated the subject in a fashion yielding practical counsel. He toldj' how some years before'an excellent digni tary had just gone to bed when of a sudden the ghost appeared. With great presence of mind the clergyman took the first word. Addressing the ghost, he said he was most anxious to raise money for a church he was' erecting; that he had a bad cold'and could not well get out of bed; but that his ^collecting-book was on1 the dressing-table, and. he" would be ex tremely obliged if the visitor would give ' him a subscription! Upon this the ghost vanished and has never returned. ,
