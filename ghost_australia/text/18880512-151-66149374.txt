A GHOST AT MOONEE PONDS. Some enterprising youth is having a game at ghost at Moonee Ponds, and has already succeeded in frightening a number of women and children who happened to have ventured out late. This promising young man dresses himself up in a sheet, and suddenly pops out from behind a hedge in some dark and lonely place. He then flings about his arms in a tragic fashion and walks about in front of his victims until he considers that he has frightened them sufficiently, when he as suddenly disappears. Ladies, in con- sequence, are afraid to go out after dusk, for fear of meeting the " ghost," who, up till now, has been allowed to carry on his pranks unmrolested. A number of the male residents are so indignant that should they drop across the ghost, he will come off rather badly.
