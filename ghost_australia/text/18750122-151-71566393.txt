AN ESCAPED LUNATIC. On Saturday Congjo Burke arrested \- Iman (&uppond-;,b 1t. ....pialunalto) on the Sydney road, Brunswick. He is a quiet looking fellow, and accosted the constable as " your Royal Highness" each time he asked him some frivolous ques tion. From the corversation which an sued, the man was arrested as a lunatic, and from the brands on the inside of the coat and vest, there appears to be little doubt of his having escaped from some asylum. The vest has simply L arrow A on the breast, while the coat has, in addi tion, M.D. underneath. He tells the police he has " been living in the wilder. ness for 16 years on dead men's bones, till the ghosts frighened him away, and that an Irish ghost named O'Ferrall, whom he had known in the old country, had stolen his boots, and given him the old ones in exchange." He was sent to the Yatrr Bend yesterday, where he was well known from having been an inmate for twelve years. He had only been at large day or two, and is regarded as a very harmless creature.
