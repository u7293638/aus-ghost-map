FRIGHTENED TO DEATH. There are several well authenticated orawled while he was niaii asleep. he was sure that a cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves and he died. Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she escaped from her keeper and, 4abbling her clothes with blood, rushed upon her hus band while he was dLzing in his chair. King Frederic imagined her to be the white lady whose ghost was believed to invariably appear whenever the death of a member of the royal family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever and died in six weeks. But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear Ã½vas that of the Dutch painter, Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth century. Qne day lie went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some teath heads and skelet ns for a picture he in tended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him, and the skeletons, suspended from the ceiling clashtd together. In a fit of horror he threw himself out of the window. Though he sustained no serious injury and was intormed that a slight earithquake had caused the commotioh among the ghostly surrouindings, he died in a few days of nervous tremour.
