WVEALTIH OR WORTH: A SKETCh OF nToO IrUSiANDS. "You see," said Addic Mortimer, "I heave always intended to marry rich." S?he sat there in her luxuriouslyfurnished room, the golden luir oanging down hier back and Iher saplphire blue eyes sparkiling like jewels--the very image of ome radiant Eastern queen. ler dress was of pale blue silk, buttoned with turquoises, beneath tile hem of wliceh peeped out a tiny embroidered slipper, and her slender fingers glittered with the rare and radiant gleams of ruby, emerald,, and mrutlhyst, wlhile ose royal diamond blazed upon thie forefinger of hier left lhand--tlhe mute proclhimer of her rngagemnt. "Yes," said hier cousin, Bell Anderson, "but Laurence Denhollmn is such a bore ! Excuse tthe plain nes of my speech, cousin mine, but I must speak out for once, if I hold my peace forevermore afterward." " Oh " said Addie, carelessly, "I am not offended. I know Laurence isu't a second Sir Isaac Newton." " And his manners are so gruff and bearish," pursued lell. "My dear," laughed Addie, imperturbably good humoured, "a coat of gilding hides all the bresrieric! lIe's worth half a million of money--tlhat is quite suflicient." " But you will always be ashamed of him, Addle he is like a ploughman, and an ugly, stupid one, too." " What does that matter, as long as I have plenty of moniey to spend, thle handsomest set of diamonds in town and a pair of horses suaeh as would make Creasus Ilimself envious?" " But, Addle," said Icll, gravely, "lie will be your husband. You will have to spend all your life with him." "You dear little unsophlisticated goose!" laughed Addie, "thatisn'tthle fashlionable codeatall, nowadays. When you are once married to a man you see very little of him nafterward. I dare say Laurence and I shall get along famously." "Addile!" cried Bell, her pretty brow contracted, and hier hazel eyes flashing a sort of brown lightning; "it's a wicked sin to marry this man just for hIis money-it is ! And if there is no one else brave enough to tell you so, I will. You have broken Edwin Cliff's true, nobleheart; you have sold yourself for mere wealth, and you will one day live to. repents it in sackloth and ashes." "Thlere's necessity for exciting yourself,"said Adeline, sweetly gracious, and smiling as over. " You always were a romantic little entliusiast, Bell, or you would never be engaged to Areisbald Leslic, without a cent of money to set you up in lhousekeeping-a mere briefless lawyer. You may preferto live onlove alone, but I, for my part, should find it rathller a spare diet. It's notling on earth but a difference of taste between you and me,. Bell-that's all. Don't let's quarrel about it, dear; but come down stairs, and let me show you Ihow sweetly my modiste has trimmed that rose coloured satin with point d'alrphqul lace, just the colour of cream. You haven't any dinner-dresses? Well, that comes of love-in-a-cottage. I always did take a more practical view of things." But, in spite of her pretended philosophly, Miss Mortimer did colour a little when, on entering the drawing-room,she foundherbridegroom-electsprawled out on the yellow-damask-covered sofa, Iris heels considerably higher than his head, reading a sporting newspaper. "Laurence, dear," she said, sweetly, "this is Miss Anderson." lMr. Denhlolm nodded slightly, withllout altering his position. " The horses hiave been waiting these ten minutes," he growled. "Dear me!" cried Addile, laughing; "I declare I never thought of our drive through tihe park." "Of course you didn't! That's just like you womnen " said the gracious lover. "Don't be all day getting ready, or I'll go off and leave you. It'sa deuce'of a bore this waiting!" Addie flew to get on her hat and scarf. " Won't you go with us, Bell ?" she asked. "Thank you, no " saidMiss Anderson. " I have no special ambition to be grumbled at by Mr. Denholm all the way." "Oh, that's only hIis manner!" said Addie, coquettislly, adjusting a rose in her hisr. "I .am very, glad that Archio hasn't any such 'manner'," said Bell. And Addio hastened down stairs to coax Mr. Laurence Denholm into good hIumour again, with hlier pretty witchleries and enchanting smiles, while Bell Anderson went hIome to hier owsn lumble dwelling. "I can't understand," thought honest Bell, "how a woman can deliberately sell herself for mere money. LaurcncoDenholm is avicious, ill-tempercd,ill-loosdng fellow, yet Addle is going to marry him next week l Well, well, as grandmamma says, wonders will never cease." She was musing over these things, when the door opened and Mr. Arclhibald Leslie, her plighted lover, came in, a tall handsome, bright-faced young fellow, "Hyperion to a satyr" as compared to Laurence Denholm. " Where have you been 1" he asked, gaily, glancing at tihe little plumed hat in hlier Ihand. "To Addie MIortimer's." "Looking r.t hIer wedding presents, I suppose. Well, caro ssia, do you regret that your lover can't give you neither pearls, diamonds, great hIouses, or opera. boxes!" "Not one particle, Archie," cried Bell, hier eyes flashing half indignantly. "I have you, and thlat is all I want." "My little heroine !" said Arclsie, proudly. "'tis portc--we'll work our way up in thie world yet, and love shall be tile foundation of it all." Thus widely differed thie views, thoughts, and feelings of thlese two young girls, eachl standing on the thlreshold of life. Bell thought Addle was crazy, while Addeio secretly considered Bell a romantic visionary! It was not a luxurious hIome; it was only a cozy parlour, with a crimson carpet on the floor, thie plainest of lair-clothl furniture, warm crimson hangings to the windows, and a bright fire craclding in tlhe grate; but to Mrs. Leslio it was better tshan any royal presence chamber, for slhe sat tlero in the ruddy twilight, with her baby ini hier arms, waiting for Archlo to come home from the office, wlero ihe was already picking up a nice little practice, spite of Addle IMortimer's disparaging remarks; for a man who makes up hirs mind to succeed willbe tolerably certaiin to do so; and Archlibald Leslie was not one to be discouraged by any temporary gloom of adversity. Her face grew radiant with happy wifely pride as Archio burst into the room and caught the crowing baby from her lap asif hie liad been a mnere feather. " How tlhe littlokitten grows !" hlie exclaimed, " and lis chleeks as red asif tioy hIad been painted. IMalnuna, Ibelieve you use rouge on your son's complexion." Bell smiled. "There, give him to me, Archlie, and get ready for tea." She bustled merrily to set the steaming urn on tlhe table, and move tihe big chair whcrer it would be warsmest. " What do you think ?" she said, as fisally ltheIy eat down, wills the baby compliracently staring roemnd fdlee the safe depths of hIis hligh chalir. " I had a lobg letter from Addle Dcnlolmn to-day." "Did you ?" "Yes. She writes from RIome. They are lsivisg ruch a gay tino--plarties alls, la, opelrnss, ill siInanner of fersivities.

"But is nothingrsecured to his wife P" asked Bell, eagerly. "Not one cent." Oh, poor Addic! poor Addie!" gasped Bell, her kind heart feeling acutely the terrible blow which had come upon hlerbeautiful young cousin. And, involun. tarily, she put one arm round her baby and looked wistfully across at her husband. "No business reverses can reach our house!" was hermute thought. And ArchibaldLeslieread it in her eyes, and smiled back the tenderest assent. Could she but have been possessed of the gift of infinite sight that night, and penetrated into the gorgeous suite of apartments in the Petorelli palace, in Rome, where fMr. and iMrs. Laurence Benholm dwelt, her heart would lhave ached with a still keener pang of pity. Could she have seen Denholm himself, confused with drink, his eyes bleared, his face flushed, and, worse than all, his hand still clenched from the blow he had just dealt the young creature he had vowed at the altar to love and cherish--could she have seen Addiecowering athis feet, in gleaming satin and jewels which seemed to blaze in scintillating fire, her hands clasped pitoeusly together, her lips faintly articulating: "Is it true? Oh, Laurence, is it true?' "It is true !" he uttered, savagely. " Get up, and don't lie sniveling there, you beggar. Yes, we are both beggars now." And lie burst into a discordant laugh.
