'"' ~ Obadiah Trnepemiy died that night, and when, upon the day of the funeral, the "will was read, the. people,ol Plimpton Centre thought it a wicked and unjust thing for Deacon Truepenny to leave half his 'fortune to that scape grace of a nephew, Matthew Goree. Time rolled on, however, and Matthew did not come to' claim his inheritance. Every ni^ht the ruddy glovr'-. tirpin] Misa Truepenny's sitting-room .friudows gleamed half-vray across the! road, but it was fully three years afterward^th^t it shpne upon :a shabby. disherell.ed, fi^ccelooking vagrant, vbo stooped upon the door-step: to putsome of the. snow by the wayside. upon; his burning, .thjrpbbjng head. Bos breath was nearly spent, and the Cbiistmas bejls that raj^g out fjom the church below made a confusion in his brain. His shaking hand raised the massive oil sllverknocker, but Betty did not unfasten^he chain. ; -. f Obadiah Truepenny ?' she said ; * Why, Lord o' .mercy, he's dead and buried these three years!' ' Dead!' said Matthew, and dropped on the door-sill like a stone. That word ' was like a bullet to' him. ' Dead!' he gasped out, and gave up the struggle.. He fell on his face along the porch, and there Elizabeth found him. Some hours after he' opened his eyes upon the wide pleasant old sitting-room. The Christmas fire was burning upon the hearth, casting a ruddy glow upon the homespun carpet blazing upon the polished heads of brass, the quaint old heads of andirons, Btovel and tongs, staring at each other from their separate cOrnei-Sj jHBt ai in the old time; flickering upon the solid old mahogany sidebpard, with' Its. chubby/ deciliters Said! tall glasses, its big-square tray, upfto which that Japanese 1 woman ha,d : Weh these years, and never'^et 'spilled ^those impo^blg'^^wi^n'thte'-VntoWaSA^jy her side; lighting'up'th&' hu;h Btraightbadked chairs^ihe taH^Aferor, the -dried' grttfees ati 1 tK© : i maiitel.'
