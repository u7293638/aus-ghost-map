A Strange Curse, In the Christmas number of the Review of ' Revkws, is an assertion that a clairvoyant, standing by the mummied in the British Museum, "could no doubt see their aetrals (or ghosts) keeping their silent watches by the dead." This reminds mo of a curious story I heard lately from Lady M. concerning Colonel X., a friend of her's, who was an officer engaged in the Gordon Relief Expedition. On the way back from that fruitless errand a native offered to show him some ancient tombs whore, against the orders of the Egyptian Govern- ment, secret excavations had boen going on. \ Accordingly, he went to the place by night, and having seen a tomb opened, and a large mummy case unearthed, he bought it, and managed to get it conveyed home to England, notwithstanding the stringent rules that no antiquities are to be taken out of the country. On ita arrival Colonel X's wife did not receive it with the enthusiasm he had anticipated On the contrary she regarded it with superstitious horror, and íetused, after the tri ii of a week or two, to keep it longer in the house, alleging that more than one incident had occurred m connection with it which had greatly teinfied the set vants. A friend in the neighbourhood was nevertheless induced to give it an asylum pending Colonel X's return, who, meanwhile, had gone from Egypt to India with his îegiraent The mummy, therefore, was duly installed in an upright positiwn in the fine entrance hall of its new abode It « a , of conioe, encased in several eovenngs, the outer une of which stood about mue feet high, and wai, as usual, painted lu repieaenta tion of a human figure of the Egyptian type But after a time the domestics of that establish- ment also got alarmed, aad could not be perouaded to pass through the hall after dark They asserted that the face on the sarcophagus, or outside covering of the mummy, waa gradually as3uming a more malevolent expression, while a few (and these were probably clairvoyante) vowed that by night they had been the whole figure en- veloped in a pale cloud of shimmering light. In a body, therefore, the teinfied servants waited on the mistress, and refused to remain m her service unless the mummy was sent away Accordingly, it was despatched to the British Museum, where it was duly opened by learned ll^yptologists Inside was discovered, deposited along with the embalmed lemams, a roll of papytus -inset ibed on which was a terrible imprecation directed against whoniaoevei should have the hardi- hood to remove the mummy from its resting place In continuation it prophesied also the unlucky man's death within the year, and concluded with the emphatic declaration that when his friends s ould make Eearcb. for his temaras, one single bone alone should be forthcoming Fearing lest this gloomy and vindictive prophecy should cause uneasiness to the officer or to hia fi lends, it was decided by the authorities at the museum not to divulge it to them A few months latei, however, came the intelli- gence that Colonel X, while on a shooting exppdihon m India, had filien fiom his elephant and had been killed on the spot He waa reverently and decently interred by the friends who wen» ii ith him, the spot being carefully marked by a wooden cross But as his itílatives in England expressed a desire by telegram that Ina body should be Bent home for bunal, some of Colonel X's brother officers returned to the locality within a week in order to be present at the re opening of the grave 1 hey found ei eiything as they had left it, the ground undisturbed the memorial erosa in position Strange to i elate, however, on uncovering the soil in which they had laid their comiade to ieBt, every trace ot the eoip=e was found to have disap- peared, with the exception ot one collat bone Thus was the curoo, uttered several thousand yeais before, liteia'Iy fulfilled in every single p »rtieulai
