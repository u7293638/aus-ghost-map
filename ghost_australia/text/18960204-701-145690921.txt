The trophy, which is valued at 100 guineas, takes the form of a magnificant tea ; and coffee service and salver, and weighs i upwards of IStiozs. of sterling silver. The astute Dan O'Brien, in reply to a Maoriland pressman, gave it as his opinion tbat Coil was the ' boss ' of tbe New South Wales two year olds, witb Huret and Adora tion next in order. But he considers that the Carbine â€” Venice colt, Fucile will beat them all as three- year-olds. In their annual supplement to the ' General Stud Book' Messrs. Wetherby give account of 55G2 thoroughbred mares, and of these 1634 had colt foals, 1525 filly foals, and 1265 were barren : while 189 were not covered in 1894, and 124 slipped foal. In addition to this, 104 died during the year, and 19G were sent abroad, the remaining 372 not being accounted for.

Ayrshire, Donovan, Adieu witb Pioneer and Sheen witb 20, Kendal and Common witb 25, Mint ing witb 24, and St. Simon* Hampton, Galopin and Pepper-and-Salt with '23. Disquieting rumours come from Adelaide about Auraris, who is said to have developed unmistakable lameness. All who profess any interest in the turf will anxiously await news of the filly'6 speedy recovery. It would detract a good deal from the interest in the approaching V.R.C. Meeting if it were found impossible to run of I in the Champion that C. B. Fisher Plate dead heat between Aurariaand Wallace. Patron's racing days appear to be about ended, and the horse having shewn signs of 'cracking up' in his Australian Cup preparation has been scratched for tbat event.

Meeting Eobold in the Sires' Produce Stakes at Geelong on Saturday on 61b better terms than when he suffered a fluky defeat in tbe Normanby Stakes, Newhaven avenged the Normanby Stakes defeat in hollow fashion, Kobold never having a ghost of a show with tbe Nevvminster colt. The Welter Handicap at Canterbury Park on Saturday was run twice, AH There win ning on each occasion. Tbe cause of the first race being a false one was on account of a strong wind, which was blowing at the time, releasing the starting barrier when the field were marshalled at the poet. When the barrier went up, as mentioned, the whole of the eleven competitors ran the course under the impression that it was a legitimate start. Pilot, a foar-year-oi'd son of Swircller and wild Bose (dam of Labour-in-Vain), won tbe Geelong Cup on Saturday, defeating 7 others.

Mr. Wilson denied having any inten tion of scratching Wallace for the Australian Cup, and promised, providing be is all right, to start bim for that event.
