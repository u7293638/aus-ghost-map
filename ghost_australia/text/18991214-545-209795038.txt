Keep Out of the Past. Keep ont of the past t for its highways Are damp with malarial gloom, Its gardens are sere, and the forests are drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb. Who seeks to regain Its lost pleasures t Inds only a rase turned to dnat, And Its storehouse of wonderful trea sures Is covered and coated with roit Keep ont of the past ! it is haunted, He who in its avenne gropes Shall find there the ghost of a joy prised the most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopesa In place of Its neantlfal rivers Lurk pools that are covered with slime, And these groves gleaming white In the phosphorous light, Cover dreams that were slain in their prime. Keep out of the past I It Is lonely, And barren and bleak to the view, Its fires have grown cold, Its stories are old, Torn, torn to the present, the new 1 To-day leads yon up to the blli tops That are kissed by the radiant ana, To-day shows no tombâ€” all life's hopey In bloom, And to-day holds a prize to be won.
