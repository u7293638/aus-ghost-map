TO THE EDITOR.. Sir— There is an old adage that people who inhabit glass houses had better not throw stones. Your correspondent 'Qui Hi' (which by the wayis an oldandfallacious Anglo-Indian system of spelling the well-known words sig- , nifying 'Is there anyone there') has ap.' parenuy torgotten tnis wise ma^m, and nas commenced to throw metaphorical stones at Mr. Tomkinson on account of the alleged want of interest attaching to the latter gentleman's lecture on his brief Indian experiences. 'Qui Hi' leads the public to infer that he himself could have done much better if he chose to lecture on his experiences. It may be so, but those who have any acquaintance withHindustani, when they read the absurd sentence which he puts into the mouth of a native magistrate will perhaps come to another and a totally dif ferent conclusion. I quote his sentence : ? ' Bi cltdheydar? Clvola Betatee Sahib pucke row! Jeldee, Jeldee! Sub CJtokee' Ugiou. Urn gJtevta !' The ghost of Gilchrist would probably be tempted out of his grave bv these sentences, supposed to emanate from a well-educated native of India. The literal translation of this is as follows: — 'Ho, policeman. Catch hold this little English gentleman.' (The preposition 'of' is mis sing.) 'Quickly, quickly. All take away, gaol.' (Preposition, wanting here again.) The last two words are. almost unintelligible. 'Urn,' by which 'Qui Hi' means, I pre sume, ' Hum,' is the ' I' of polite parlance. ' gheuta' might be anything, out may mean, 'am going.' What the particular point of the whole thing is, when it is translated, most people will probably fail to see. — I am, &c;, ALIPH JEEM.
