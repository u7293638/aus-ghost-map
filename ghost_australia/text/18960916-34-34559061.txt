THE Y.M.C.A. The attendance at the "Men's own" on Sunday afternoon in the Victoria Hall was one of the best of the series. In the absence of Mr. Virgo the honorary acting general secretary presiaea,- ana; openea me meeting with devotional exereites. After some hearty chorus tinging by the audience, and a solo, "Davidslament." by Mr. Peagam, the Rev. A. J. Clark addressed those present on the subject of "Samson'a Wedding Trip." After afen- introductory remarks onthe personality of Samson he said his life was a picture of our conflicts, struggles, and difficulties. Everyone had contiictd, especially younff men, and there came a. Waterloo in the hfe of every Christian which influenced the whole of his after life. He proceeded to' show ttat as Samson slew the lion in the power of the Holy Ghost it was by this same power also that men over came to-day. Samson's experience afforded a further illustration of life's joys. He tound a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of a lion—the very place where ho had had a con flict. So we found joy in the place of conflict, in conquered besetmenta and vanquished temptations. And lastly, Samson was" a symbol of life's Eervice. Aiter partaking of the honey ho took some home to his father and mother. He did not keep the sweet things to himself. God expected men to talk to others of the good they received and to carry their Christianity into every detail of life; not to keep it" to themselves. The address was "en livened by many happy illustrations and pithy sayings, and the close attention of the audience was kept throughout." A Jarge crowd attended the usual service at the Theatre Eoyal in the evening. „
