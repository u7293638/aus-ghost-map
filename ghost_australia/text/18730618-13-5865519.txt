The imitation itself was evidence that his visit was most favourably received by the exalted personage to whom it was addressed and the manner in which he was entertained by his distinguished host and hostess and then family shows how well ture politeness con sorts with the highest dignity A hearty health was drunk to Germans here and elsewhere outside the huts of the empire (The 1 mice s goblet was used after Mr Beighoffs narrative was concluded on Saturday night in a reciprocal toast ).
