One of the first visits he pays-is- to Dr. Ingleby. He is admitted at once, but the doctor reeeiTea him with aishake of the head. ' Yon have oome in the vain hopo that-tbe let ter might have been discovered ; but I am sorry to say it has not, and t tell you fairly that I think that there is little or no chanoa of coming upon it now. All likely plaoes have been over hauled without a sign of ife Mrs. JPossdyfee and Miss Hyde, al&oagh; neither of them read it over, were bom positive it fraB-quite a short note, and agree in thinking 9s was probably destreyed. From the accooat of the scene at the breakfast table.' continued Doctor Inglebj, ' X have no doubt yon asa quite right in the estimate yon put upon that note. It was a good deal more than an invitaJaan to dinner, no doubt; men are not agitated in the way poor Fbssdyfce is described to hnvp been by notes of that kind. I presume that, if lie had it about him, it would have been found at Has Hopbine/ 'Hia ofothes and effects, you see, sir, were searoaed by Inspector Thzeiher before I got there ; and, bear m mind, it was not till I went over to Dyfce -with. you. that I ever heard of that letter.

'Quite so; cpxijbe so; and now I'll say good night. I'll oaU in-before leaving Baumborough. to-morrow, and hear anything yon may have to tell me. Ones more, good night, 6ir;' and so saying. Sergeant) Usher vanished in the dark ness. He busied himself -about Baumberoogh in that fioit of demttary fashion in which the sergeant always xruvinod bia inqnisies. He seemed the veriest lounger aboui, ready to goaeip with any-, body upon aaxf sabjeot^or even to drink with any one ; tfgtj tihcjngh free enough in the matter of trying for other people's liquor, it was little M-. Usher consumed himself. Similarly though his was addicted apparently to holding the most idle: coiM-eise, y^t bow eye and ear were ever on. the alert ; and let him Ascourae about trade, politics, horse-racing, the weather, or, in a town like Baumborough, about the price of corn or oxen, the talk invariably gravitated towards the mur der. Mr. Usher had no objection to advance some vague view of his own upon the subject, but . noted k«ealy what other people might say. That - there was mneh winnowing of chaff inevitable in such invaofigation no one knew better than Mr. Usher. So-one had a keener eye for that grain of evidenoe or information, when he crossed it, than the aerjtea&i;); but he had talked through many a long day, *nd deemed the words of hia felioj-menidle. Mr. Uaher had laid down - JUs programme, and intended to adhere rigidly to it; he was by no means — agning, but the four channels from which he conoelved faapirfttiou wifii regard to the crime might eeroe he resolved should be honestly dredged.

At length 2S*» Marlinson said bololy he should ttgret very Brack not to be able to accommodate the gentle man, bat that unless those rooms suited him he had no others vacant on that floor, exoept a set just at present out of use. If the gentleman &ver; looked at a paper, he had no doubt read of the awful oa\a-mity that had befallen the Hopbine — and hece Mr. Marlinson paused to give the straofer an opportunity of condoling with him. * Yon mean,' said the old gentleman, 'the set in whloh the murder was committed. But I have no superstitions 3 interviewed, tried, and hung too many murderers in India to hare any compunctions about apartments because some little difference of opinion was quietly disposed of in them. No, no,. my good friend, in all my experiences ifstho dead men alone you can re ly upon not turning up again, dive them long epeUsof imprisonment and etfllthe scoundrels oox&e; before you again, but onoe dead they are doae with, and bother you no more. Let's Bee tie rooms/ ; ' Ho ain't a sticker ... At trifles apparently,' muttered Mr. Martinson; but at the same time it flashed across him what an excellent persoztthe old gentleinsn would be to sit in judgment on James Fozborougn, wherever he ebould be laid hands' on. The new comer professed himself perfectly satisfied with these rooms, and ordered a snug little dinner and a fire in the sitting-room, remarking that long residence in India was apt to make one somewhat chilly when onoe more encountering the climate of one's native load. It was a, raw evening, aad a blaze in. the grate was unmistakably chesi'iul, and Ser geant Usher — for, of course, the ci-devant Indian, judge was that functionary — his dinner satisfac torily disposed of, thought as he sat sipping his port and cracking his walnuts that the Hopbine was a, very comfortable and well- oondocted house. He had metamorphosed himself so as to have an unrestricted investigation of the rooms, not san guine about obtaining a result by any means, but he wished to look these rooms over and pick up what he might in the hotel without taking the Hopbine into his confidence. . He had not even let SoBpeetor Thresher know of his presence, but determined to work out this business by himself. It might bej perhaps, the swagger of a well-known London officer, or it might be genuine disbelief in bis professional colleague, bnt certain ife is that ~the sergeant was not prepared to give much' cr'e ?denee to Inspector Thresher in his busi ness. No sooner did he have the room to himself than Mr. Usher commenced bis course of investiga tion. . He had questioned the waiter no little during dinner concerning the murder, and Jen kinsen, after the ma-one* of his elass, was only too delighted to tell his story,, and readily led into the relation of all the minor details. 23bc an article in the room but was closely scrutinised, and to aid him in his task the Sergeant drew from his breast pooket a -strong magnifying glass. Through this, attd even going- down on bis knees for the purpose, he earetully examined the carpet and also the furniture, bnt no tell-tale stain supported the theory of both Dr. Ingleby and himself, that it was in that' room Fossdyke earns by faia death. Neither on carpet nor furniture conld Mr. Usher's well teained eyes detect the sign of a struggle sor the deep-hued. spots he sought. The theory might be just, bnt there was nothing whatever to corrobo rate it. Mr. Usher sat down, lit his pipe, ordered some spirits and water, and proceeded to reflect over the affair generally. ' E Fossdyke was tilled here/ lie-said- to him' self, ' either by accident or design, it was an uncommon well-managed assassination. Not a iraceof it is to be found. If he was killed in tke bedroom, how did it come about ? or is it, ddspite Dr. Ingleby's opinion, a mere ordinary case of suicide. No, I don't believe it is a matter of self-murder ; that the quarrel should arise here, and Foxborough in his. anger slay him is intelligible enough; but that he sneoid have followed him to his bedroom and filled him with .out creating a disturbance seems almost incre dible. In his sleep, yes ; but Mr. Fossdyke evi dently mot his death before be bad u&dressed;, before he had hardly begun t» throw his clothes off. I've ne craving to see ghosts, but if John Fossdyke's spirit would give me a wrinkle to night I'd be obliged to it* and I don't think I'd be too much agitated to take down the evidence/ However, the sergeant's sleep proved as dream less as a healthy man's after a moderate modi cum of . grog and tobacco should do. ? CNo inspira tion came to him from the world of shadows, and as he sprang out of bed next day he exclaimed, ' The&itting-Eoom; won't speak, I wonder whether' this room will disclose the secret of that, September evening. The key of the door, for instance, if It was suicide, whese is it f If it is murder, . it may - be anywhere ; but if the former, it must be 'here,' and Mr.. Ujsher began an eager apd searching investigation of the apartment. It was one of the best bedrooms in the Hopbine, and- so somewhat extensively furnished. Not an inch of the old-fashioned mahogany wardrobe did the sergeant leave unexplored; he turned out the drawers, pulling them out and looking behind them seeking principally for this missing key. The inan haobeen found dead- stabbed to death, in this room, there -was no necessity to prove that^-but whether it was his own doing or an other's was matter of grave inquiry, and to this fact the sergeant was now confining himself, not altogether incapable of noting anything that might bear upon the case, but concentrating him self, jw great scientific discoverers usually do, for the* time upon the one point. Bo searched the drawers of the (brassing table, he lifted the washing^tand, he sioved 'the bed, he felt the carpet all oy«r v-fth. his hands ami bars f«et, he withdvew the ganiy-out paper device that masked £h« flre-plac*, diseloaing somo few crumpled jpraps . of paper bakind it, but no key.
