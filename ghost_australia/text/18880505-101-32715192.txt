' Yes ; only you see, dear father, my leg hurt me a good bit, and I think I must have fainted or something, for I didn't see. the guard changed at all, and the next thing I krow was that they were lying quite close to me pretending to be asleep, ah 1 Fly was scratching at my h inds aud licking my face.
