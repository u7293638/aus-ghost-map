English 'Extracts.. -0 ABSOLUTION. -To "the Editor of the Merning C/Ironcle.. SIR-Observing some remarks made by you in.your paper of this, day (yester. dlay) in regard to the pow er claimed by the Bishop of Exeter of forgiving sins, I beg to refer you to your .Prayer Book, where in the order for the visitation .of the sick you will find the form ou the absolution to be delivered by the minister, which differs only in a very trifling. degree from.. the Catholic form, and yet, strange to say, the Protestant clergy are continually abusing the Catholic clergy for performing the sam'e function. I send you a copy of the Protestant form of absolition as follows, iz.: " Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church t, absolve all sinners who truly,repent, and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee-thine offences, and by his authority committed to me I absolvethee 'friom all th. sinse, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen."-I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, A CONSTANT READER OF YOUR PAPER.
