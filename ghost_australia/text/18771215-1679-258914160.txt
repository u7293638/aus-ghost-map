k QUEER COURTSHIP. You know how it is in a letter (begaq the little shop-keeper, rubbing her thin hands together helplessly). I was writing to brother Joshua away down East, hundreds of miles from here, and happened to tell him, among other things, tbat the widow lady that helped teach school here, and boarded with- me, was going away. I didn't say a word one way or the other about^Mr. Steele, for what did it matter to them whether he waB a tyrant or not) I only wanted to tell them I'd been at a good deal of expense in fitting up the room, and I didn't mind her board money so mucb as I did to have the chamber idle again, and nobooy about tbe house but mjaelf, though she was poor company at the best, being sickly iu constitution and low in Bpirits the most of the time, and after a while nearly driven crazy by the continual badgering and 4 bickering of Mr. Steele. She used to come 4ome at night that worn out, what with the wickedneesof the children and the eternal nagging of the school- master, that I've seen her put her head down on the table and cry fit to break her heart. She said she couldu't please him, do what sbe might, and it was ruining her nerves to see bim beat the boyB* in the way tbat he did. She was sure he'd break some of their bones. I tried to cheer her as best I could, telling her that boys' bones were tough, and the little rascals deserved to be paid up for ~sonie. of their deviltry. After an hour or two she'd come around again and be~comfortable, but, lame 1 what was tbe use f The next day, perhapB, abe'd be worse than ever, and the creature's health began to fail so, I was glad when she - gave up aud went away. She was very downhearted, Sam Biley, the stage-driver, said, all tbe way down to tbe train, and he gave it as his opinion that Mr. Steele was no better than a black-hearted tyrant. S*m is cuch a good-natured fellow that it quite wore upon his mind, and he stopped a bit with me on bis way to the evening train to talk it over. I wanted .him to get some ittle,things for me at Fikeville, and while I was making out tbe memorandum, Sam told me how he pitied whatever poor body was to take tbat poor creature's place. You can just fanoy how I felt when Sam drove'up to the door that night, and I went out to get the package, to see brother Joshua's daughter Jemima on the seat with Sam, chatting and laughing away as merry «s. a cricket. "I was powerful glad to see the child, but dreadfully mirtitted to find her. tucked in there with the.driver. ' I told Sam pretty sharply that he ought to know better, for their was plegty of room inside, and I didn't know what the boarders over the way would think of it. " She waB bound to ride butside/' ssid Sam.;, " and a wilful woman must have her way." "Why,its all the fashion up oujr -way," said Mime. " -The summer boarders swirm all over.the -tops of the ooaohes like feo many lively bees; butif it hurts anybody's feel-" ingB, I'm sorry. ABchool marm must. mind, herp's andq'a." '. "A school-inarmt" I said, wondering what thejchild meant. ' Then she told me she'd , come oat to take that poor little woman's place; that she'd written to Mr. Steele as soon as my fetter 'was" read -at home, for she couldn't get along at the school there. r.-, J "It would.take, a saint to put tip with their airs and their interference, ind yon know I like to have iny Awn vay,'^iBaid >my nieoe Jemina. • .

Then .she -was Jttjr^oini Aeiih; and blood, and had the ^ohbonm^r noieia' little high with Mime, and freckled over the bridge a bit, but she.wm a bonny, blithb, fresh-Tfeilng creature, so different from the wretohedMittle woman that had jost gone away. - '• / " • I oouldn't'bea'r the thoughts of her spirits and health being broken by ,that dreidful Mr. Steele.: , ; : ;•' : " ~ "I'll tell you, Mime," I said, as she dried the disbeB for me, what we'll do, • You shall stay, sit home with'' me and help about the jhop; there's bonnets how and thenrto trim, and lots of little knioknacks in worsted work to be made." "Now, aunty," said -Mime, "a buffalo would be UBS clumsy at trimming a bonnet than I would, and as for worsted- work—" " I suppose ao, 4 ' I said, for I could see she was determined to teach, The next morning slie went to scbypol, and for a month or so everything went right, and I didn't hear a word of' complaiut from her. She made fun enough of the school-master, and said he didn't kuow how to .manage the boys, and ' made hiuiBelf more trouble than was necessary ; that a coaxing tford of hers went farther than a dozen slashei with that rod of his ; but everyone had their own way, and it was none of, her business. She was getting along .splendidly, and the smaller children were quite delighted with a way she had of picturing out things on the black-board. Mime w«s quite ready with her pencil, and had wade us laugh, Sam Biley and me, man; a time by scrawling off funny conceits on paper. Sim Rily began to drop in at night, and I noticed he was quite taken with Mime. Sam was well to do, and, outside of his line of stageB, owned a fine house down on the main road. Sam didn't miud being hit off himself once in a while—him and his horses and paBseDgers aad all; he used to ait back in his chair and laugh till the tears rolled down his cheeks, and look over at me, winking and blinking, and whispering, under his breath, what a wonderful woman she wa«. " She's aB freBh and handsome as a rose," he would Bay when Mime was out'of tbe room; " and what health she's got,land what spirits 1" I could see how things were going. Dear 1 dear ! I used to Bit and picture it all out to myself, and think how nice it would be to have Mime settled near me for life. So when ebe came home one afternoon from school, with a bright Bpot burning on either oheek, an angry flame in her eyes, and said to me that war had began between her iand Mr. Steele, I didn'.t BO muoh mind, for I thought the sooner she got .'discouraged the better. Sam was well on to thirty, and though Mime's Bkin made her look younger thau Bhe was, there wasn't so muoh difference as yon'd think between their ages. " He's forbidden my illustrations on the black-board, aunty," said Mime; and though I didn't know one bit of board from another, I oould see by the way she felt about it that it was a great spite to Mime. " He oalis them peroioions and exciting to the imagination, and injurious to more practical requirements," Baid Jemima. And I couldn't quite get the hang of his objections, for every word of tbe EchoolmaBtef'e was as long as tbe moral law, bat I could tell it waB.some imposition of his. " He's a narrow-minded idiot, and I shall tell him so if he persists n tbis notion," said Mime. "II he persists," I said, "yon'd better give it up. He's so set in his way, there's no use crossing him." " I won't let him cross me," said Mime, and she didn't. She went on with her pictures on tbe blackboard for a fall week or more, till one night there was a rap at tlie sitting-room door, and it gave me qaite a turn to see the long bony figure of the school master standing on the threshold. Mime started up, a hot,colour leaping into her face, and stood thsrs confronting him like a young Jezebel. The maa looked pal&enough; himself, sinking into the chair I sat for him as if he was quite warn and spent like, and he seemed beat out in soma way; for though he fixed his eyes savagely on Mime, there was something in 'em that looked tired and hunted. "I have come here to remonstrate with your niece, madam," he said to me, " though I've found it of very llttls use and profit heretofore; but however capable and efficient he may be, and however judicions it may seem to retain her services, her spirit of insubordination is too dangerous an example to the naturally rebellious and headstrong temperament of youth. She must confine herself strictly to the rales that govern the method of instruction. . The trustees—" Don't put it-on th^rustees," broke in Mime'.; and I was glad in took it upqn herself to answer him, for I couldn't make out bead or tail of what he was saying, wbat with his long-words and the'fiuster I was in. " The trustees are mere lay figures for yon to dress your petty eohemes of . conceit and tyranny Upon." , He waved his hand impatiently, and went on : "It it the will of the trustees that you shall put aside the puerile and reprehensible coarse yon have taken in exoitfng sthe imagination -and' creating frivolous and mischievous emotions. The pursuits of my own class have been interrupted, their Attention distracted-r" " Why don't your class mind their, ojro d business t" said Mime. , " Why do you look i at'me,fbr listen to ma, or bother with_me at, c dlf It is not your blaas that is disturbed, ' Mr. Steele, it is you." 'The school-master's faoe suddenly reddened, then grew paler than before; he wiped tbe perspiration from .his long high forehead, and fcis bony fingers actually trembled cm bis knees. I don't wonder he was mad, fpr Mime went on in the t p s most outrageous : Her spuuk. wat.up, and she -wasn't a bit afraid of mm..', ' <• .--V M "Yoa can't bear to see knowledge tntde easy and pleasant," she sald.

A> She began from that time «ut to flghi hard for her own wav. and it gotto be.pretty well known sbe was winning ovist' the trustee's. The children had never liked anybody as they did Mime, and little Bill Prltohard, that used to play truant half the time, and would rather take a beating any day tban be pent up in school, went there aB regular as olook- work now, and began to mark, out horses and dogs with a stamp of apenoii himself; and Mr. Pritohard he wasons of the trusteesj and thought the world and all of my niece Jemima. But somehow or other, just as I said,-the oontinual worriment of it fretted Mims, and she got thiu and lost her pretty oolour; and the night Bhe came home and sud she had got the best of the school-master, and the notice had been served on him that day that he was to let her have her own way of teaohing, that night I made up my mind it was about time it was settled in tome way, for.Mime was more fidgety and contrary, than ever; and I don't believe every thing would have turned out as it did if Mime had been in ber sooer senses. The girl was about half wild, and I don't believe she knew what she was about; for it stands to reason'she must have hated tbe school-master, and yet when I. began to glory over his defeat; and ; say how glad Sam Riley would be, she shut me up in a minute. * "Sim Eiley and- Mr. Steele," shB said, " are two very different man." " I should hope so,'' I safd. "Samis made of a different stuff," she went on to say.; "The little pricks and torments that sting the soul of Mr. Steele to m madness would be ntterly unfSlt by Bam. Sam is a good fellow—- - * •. "Thank you for Sam." I said, for she was enough to provoke a saint. , " But be has not the capacity for suffering that Mr. Steele has; and oh, aunty,vh»; do«s suffer 1" " Serve him right, the monstpr," I Baid? and had scarce got the words but .of my mouth when there was* rap at the dpor. I. went ovet, thinking it was Sam Biley, wlien there was the tbin, gaunt faoe of the schoolmaster again. He oame in and bowed as grave as an owl, and sat down on a chair, by the door; his oane rolled down beside him on the floor,- and. for a full minute or so he ooaldn't find a word out of that long dictionary in hishead. * I was glad to see that Mime's spank came back at the sight of him. Her eyes were as bright as they coald be, and her cheeks like the heart of a hollyhock. "My errand here, Miss Jemima,", he began, " is altogether a friendly one. ..You have bo muoh spirit and determination that I think your present subordinate position is unfit for yon. I know of one tbat will be shortly vacant, whioh you can fill with great credit to yourself and all'conoerned:" " I am much obliged to ysu," Baid Mime, her lipa begiuning to carl, and tlie oolour in her obeeks deepening io aflame, "but I'm quite satisfied where I am. : I can well understand that you'd b« glad to be rid of me, bnt||I must beg to decline. I'm not going away from here." " But I am going away from here," said tbe schoolmaster, getting upon his feet. It is my plaoe tbat will be vacant, and that I think yon may have it if you^chooae." . 'Tou—you 1" said Mime: and I don't wonder the ebild was astounded at the news, - I was quite flustered myself, "Yes," Baid the schoolmaster: "youoan have your own way now." , And he went out the door, bowing awkwardly as he went, • queer, miserable smile straggling into his face. ." Dear I dear t the ooiitranness of woman 1 No'sooner was the door well shut on him. than Mime put her head down on the table and began to cry. Her hair got loose anc} fell all about her, and, to make tbe matter worse, I heard a footstep outside, and .this ,time-I ' thought it must be Sam Biley. . \- " For goodnpss'sake, Mime,'* I said, "'don't let Sam Biley seeyouin-thu way l''~ '••-'-;., V- But the door opened, fend there stood the - school-master again. -,He said he had oqme ' back for his cane; but be never even stooped to pick it up, hut stood staring at Mime 'tts if she" was a.ghost instead of the, fresh, pretty, wholesome creature that she wav fihe ralsed > her head, and though her face wai half-hidden by her hair^ hsr eyelashes were.
