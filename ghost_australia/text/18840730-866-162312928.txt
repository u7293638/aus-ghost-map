. A DANGEROUS EXCAVATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TASMANIAN NEWS. S i r ,—Not being very well up in points of law as to liabilities of contractors, will you kindly inform me if in the event of any unfortunate wayfarer accidentally falling into a monster ditch, extending right across the road, and iu places Oft and 7ft deep, situated in Lansdowno Crescent, nt the junction of Petty street, the contractors would be liable for damages tained ? Such a place has been excavated there, and n.t night is left without tin ghost of a lig h t to Mam any person of its whereabouts. Can it be, Mr Editor, that the contractors have taken tbc job at so low a prioo that they cannot afford any light on tho subject, or do they imagine that tho lives of residents of the Crescent arc of tio value? I think that they will find out their mistake if a light or two 1b not exhibited for the future. 1 ask where is the City Inspector? I think it is his duty to see after these tbiugs. Why d« not the contractors try and push along the job a little faster? Lnst week two men were employed on tlie works. Surely w< are a long suffering people. But ns sure as the night follows the day, wo will watch our interests at all future elections of candidates for Muuicipal honours, lor tin way the business of the city is managee now is simply unbearable. Thanking you for the insertion of thisgrowl.—Yours,etc , WATCHDOG. liobavl, July 20, 3SSL
