OVERLOADING STEAMERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY, SIR-The loss of the Tasman will be a gain to the company, and to the community at large, if it serves to direct attention to the questions life-saving apparatus provided proportionate to the number of passengers J What would have been the state of affairs had the accident happened to, say, the last boat from Melbourne before Christmas? That, and, in fact, many other steamers are scandalously overloaded in comparison with the carrying accommodation of the boat, and with what is offer greater importance, the life-saving apparatus, I have more than once discussed this matter when on board with other passengers, and the conclusion arrived at has been that in case of a serious accident most of those on board would not have a ghost of a show. There, were less than 80 on heard the Tasman. What would have been the result had there body seven or eight times that number? I don't with to crook, but 'some morning a thrill of ' horror will run through this island, and our holidays will be passed in sorrow and vain regrets.
