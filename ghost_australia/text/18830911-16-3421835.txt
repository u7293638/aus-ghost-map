HOLLOWAY'S DRAMATIC SEASON. HAMLET. Most of those who are regarded in Brisbane as authorities upon stage matters generally predicted that Hamlet would be a financial failure at least As is often the case, however, in the multitude of counsellors there was not wisdom, and Mr Holloway must have been more than gratified with the select and appreciative audience that thronged the theatre last night From the very commencement of the piece, the audience seemed to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the play, and the applause that greeted every point showed that they were most intelligently sympathetic Mr W J Holloway took the part of Hamlet, and this is undeniably one of his very best characters His reading of the part evinced the most careful and conscientious study, and when it is i remember ed that he has seen none of the great English models but has practically evolved his conception of the part from his own inner consciousness his performance last night is all the more remarkable He played with a power and passion that showed he entered fully into the spirit of his part, and, besides his artistic conception of the character the comparatively minor attributes of by play and diction were most effect tively rendered Mr Holloway must be congratulated not only on his artistic triumph but also on having given an intellectual treat to his audience, the more valuable on account of its extreme rarity in this city Mr Charles Holloway played the Ghost of Hamlet's father in a most impressive manner His elocution was dignified and his men was stately, and the comparatively unimportant part of the Ghost acquired in his hands an added stateliness and solemnity that went a long way to complete the tout ensemble of an excellent play Mr Olly Deering as Polonius, the lord chamberlain was very fine He did not overdo the part, and while maintaining the privileges of 'gar ruinous old age still kept himself within bounds and showed his capacity for other lines than the low comedy in which he has recently been so successful Mr Douglas played well as Claudius, King of Denmark, and made the most of a by no means easy part. The Laertes of Mr Jowett was exceedingly good and he appeared to great advantage both at the grave of Ophelia and in his final and fatal encounter with Hamlet The one fault we have to find with him is his tendency to overdo his part. His motto is evidently "Aut Caesar and nihil, ' but a facility for granting will most probably terminate in mud rather than Caesars This, however is merely thrown out as a hint for his acting last night is deserv- ing of the warmest praise Ophelia was played by Miss Essie Jenyns This talented young actress never before appeared to such advantage in her native city and we cannot help thinking that it is a pity that such talent as she evidently possesses should be thrown away in the exaggerated sentimentality of the sensational dramas in which she has recently been playing She portrays the virgin fresh ness and innocence of the unfortunate Ophelia with a grace and depth of feeling with which it is impossible not to sympathise, and gives no uncertain promise of a brilliant future on the stage We were glad to notice that she had recovered in a great measure from the severe cold from which she was suffering last Friday night, and she sang her pathetic songs with a tenderness and feeling that completely carried away her audience Miss Carrie George made a most admirable Gertrude, Queen of Denmark Her presence was queenly and her costume magnificent The scene with her son was admirably played, and completely brought down the house Perhaps as a thoroughly good all round actress Miss George is one of the most valuable members of the company Miss Constance Deorwyn as Oiric had a small but most effective part, which she made the most of in her own inimitable manner The other parts were all well filled and for completeness of detail and perfection in all the minor accessories "Hamlet is one of the most successful plays given by the Holloway Company-a fact which is all the more creditable as the piece was only played for one night The principal actors were repeatedly called before the curtain, and even after the curtain had fallen on the closing scene the audience insisted on calling their f favourites before the footlights -an almost unprecedented compliment in the annals of the Brisbane stage There is no doubt that really good acting and beautiful scenes v must command success and the ti seraph Mr Hollow as obtained last night over the obstinate prejudice against anything Sliak spearman must have been doubly gratifying from the fact of its being so thoroughly de- served To night the company play Taylor's amusing comedy of ' Still Waters Run Deep," conclud- ing with the farce " A Silent Woman "
