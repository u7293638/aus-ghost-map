A Tzar intelligent dairyman, Mr. John Spier, has nude known some valuable ei perimenU recently carried out in the feed ing of cowi on different kinds of food, with a »iew to testing their Krer&l; effects | apon the quantity tad quality of milk. Tha average dairyman believss that tha more food of any particular kind he girea to hi* cows the richer will be the milk. Mr. Spier's conclusions point to the effect that »t least two foods, vii~, young fresh grass and brewer's grains, hare the po«.er of lowering the percentage of fsfiß the milk, and that retches decorticated cotton scad cake hare a tendency to incraae it. The effect of grains and young graas upon tha milk is well knowji to dairymen Both.of theaer fuods have V U'.tiency to iueraase the yield of milk." bat Mr. Spier maintains (states "Thistledown" in the " Australasian) that an increased flow is the cause of a lewer quality. He asserts also that most changes of food seeoi to be followed by an increase of fat iv the milk, but that there is a strong tendency for the milk to return to what may be called its natural condi tion. The maiiuium or minimum of fat seems to be reached in about ten days, and within other thirty ihe probability v that the milk will be returned to near ita normal condition. The solid* other than fat in the milk seem to rise or fall in much the same manner as the fats, although to a lets degree. An increase of oil in the food docs not (teem to give auv increase of fat in the milk. The effect of food was more marked in the quality of the butter producer than'the quantity. Like the fat in the milk', (%• yield of butter seems to attaiu iv masiinjiis) about the middle of the second week, after which it decreases, attaining the uurraal about the end of tha fifth week. Also some foods seem to pn>duc« milk from which a greater percentage of the f%t can be recorered by ehuruiug than others. Tha "ft'ateist iiSttejvpß ra the etiecU of tUe- fouls was m*a ia she quality of the batter. !■ fact, mutt foaaa teem to h»»e tomm aSeet ia the flarnur, neltiug puiat, or keeping qualities of the batter pro. duced >>y their use.

Mackey, barrister, has ; >»en annouuced as a jirobalile c.-tndid.-»tc :\>r Kip»ii Mil ILim[Klen, tho following: jxpnsitinu of his views upon tbe fiscal issue will be of interest. It was nnje in the course of a demonstration by the /reetradc and Ueumcr-ilic Association at RilUrat. In speaking upon tlie ijucstion •" I>r?» protection to ml t>> increase em ployment or nut >" he pointed out thit notwithstanding thst the suspir duties in Sew South Wales were bein:; reduced a beetroot sujjar factory had been estab lished there, and urged that while a krgM amouut per ton was charged as a duty on susar in Victurin, the confectionery, jam. makin?, and fruit- prtst'rvi.ig industries uf this colony could not compete with those of New South Wales. While a bis cuit factory hid recently boon pulled down and sold in Melbourne, one had been established in Sydney, simply be cause the machinery and ingredients for the making of bircuits were free of duty orer the bonier. The chairman of Foster* Lager Beer Company had told him that protection was ruining them, •imply becui»o they had to pay 8d a pound duty on the particular kind of hops they use* (Boheroiaa), and had last yeir paid £1500 in duties on their machinery. The speaker referred to the decline in the ■hip building trad* on the bank* of the Varra, and pointed cut that there were 1800 people employed in that industry, but at the mine time said tint boat building livl flourished far mor* in Mel bourne than in the other colonies, •imply because this wa» the only place •here the boat trade waa thorough]; free. (AppUuae). In 18»3 therTwere 571' persons employed in th» biscuit trade iv Victoria, and in New South Wales there were 836, while in the coach building trade and in the mining in duitry the facts were all in favour of free trade. In conclusion, tha speaker drew attention to the report of tbe Amalga mated Society of Carpenters and Joiners of Great Rritiiii, the statistica contained in which showed that in New South Walus carpenters' wage* in three cities - were 54«, and in one.4Bs, while in Victoria they were from 42s to 48s.

Then by deducting «11 these ex penses from the value of the crop at market rates, whether wild or consumed on the farm, he can tell how much he has ;f lined or lost.
