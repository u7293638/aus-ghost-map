MB COLORS OF MASOSBT. _ There exists nothing in Masonry without significance, and a moro perfect system has never as yet been devised whose mastership can alone bo attainod by study and reflection. The very colors employed at present for deco ration, as it were, of Masonic clothing possess a latent moan'ng derived from the ancient mysteries wherein white was tho symbol of me eann, oiuo cno color of the sky, that of air; purple of tho sea, and that of scarlet fire, the four elements, trial through which consti tuted initiation into tho mysteries of old, upon semblance to which the symbolic craft has been founded. Originally white, or purity, was tho all provading color of Masonry, as tho officers woro their jewels suspended from _ white collars and tho brothern a plain white apion and it was from EYanco that was borrowed tbo use of blue, as that was tho color of tho Order of the Holy Ghost, tho highest within tho royal gift, equal in rank to that of the Garter of England, which is likewise blue. Consequently, symbolically spoakliiij, a brother decorated with bluo is elevated to n rank n-itli tho proudest peer of the realm, while tho Royal Arch was de signated by red fire, emblem of purification, likewise color of the Golden Fleece. Purple, which should be worn by Giaud Lodges, is symbolic of union, as it is create:! by fusion of tho blue of tho Ancient Craft with tho red of the Royal Arch, while the general colors of Masonry aro blue, liberty; red, equality; and white, fraternity.
