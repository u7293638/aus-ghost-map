The dancing horse, the Chinese tumbler, the celebrated jes- per, and even the performing dogs, were objects apparently of the intensest delight to him; but an edifice designed for the grand purpose of improving, "coming " mankind, this Chris- tian minister could not countenance or endure. Well, to my thinking, Mr. Eliott was a finer sight, when laying that stone, than dogs, horses, jesters and jumpers. I may be wrong, I hope not. I own it was a proud day in my thoughts, as well as a proud day for Gayndah. Political, as well as social, lessons were being inculeated. There, might have been satire in this part of the arrangements, but nevertheless I thought I saw the foundation stones of common sense, serious citizen- ship, and other improvements, being all laid at the same time, and by the same hand. I fancied I heard the men who were honouring themselves by attending the ceremony, acknowledging that they wished they had never made such political asses of themselves, as to establish the striking and detrimental contrast they had, between their members and the one who, trowel in hand, stood before them. They prayed, I believe, for what my Countrymen would call a ' drap of lathe,' to wash, out of their very consciences the recollections of those stupid things they have said, and meetings they have had, in obedience to that intolerable postal snuff and Brisbane truckler, the Colo- nial Treasurer. How admirably "G" exorcises them on this subject — more power to him. I see you have been afflicted with a note from the ' Inhabi- tants of Ban Ban.' I have noticed a sad change coming over their manners of late; I have deplored their descent since they lost their light and life, but I was in hopes that a friendly chide, and perhaps a recognition of my voice, would have had a recuperative effect upon them. But I, even I, am not capable of staying their determination to be ridicu- lous. They know how proud I was of the place — proud of their characters as well as my own. To me they vowed eter- nal fidelity ; come high, come low, I was to be their guide their boast ; but now their loyalty is so changed, their servi- tude so abject, their desire to please so morbid, that I notice the very finest and most striking natural feature in the neighborhood, they describe as the ' Seven Ills.' Tet them yet accept a piece of information - Ghosts never trouble mortals who have serene consciences ; and mortals who have any brains never trouble ghosts.
