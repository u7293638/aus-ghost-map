Druids' Concert at Terowie. The concert held in the Institute hall on the evening of the Druids' gala and sports was one of the best of its kind held in Terowie and was rewarded with a bumper house. Directly the Orchestral Society struck up the overture—"Abbey March"— everyone felt that they were going to have a real good time. The Druidical tableau was very well arranged and looked a very pretty sight. The special feature of the concert was the comic songs by Mr Blunt—"The Ghost of Benjamin Bins," and "The Goblin's in the Churchyard." Mr Blunt's songs met with vociferous applause and certainly his acting and singing are far above the average amatuer talent. Miss McGillick sang "Robin Adair" in her best style and Miss Billiett sang "True to the Last" very nicely, but slightly marred her efforts through nervous- ness. Miss McLachlan sang "The Old Jack Tar" sweetly, and received a very flattering recepton. Miss Gillespie has received a thorough tution in music and the manner in which she rendered "Tell, Tale, Tit" left little to be desired. Mr A. Steadman again exhibited his skill and powers with the Indian clubs and the way in which the hair of the whole audience stood on end during his exhibition of axe swinging only too clearly proved the absolute confidence placed in Mr Steadman's skill. Messrs Brooks and Wiltshire gave two good recitations in their best style and Mr Hean assisted with a clog dance. The prizes were distributed to the fortunate winners of the sports' races and the entertainment con- cluded with a nigger farce. After the concert a ball was held and about seventy couples took part, proving a great success in every way. Mr Vannan made a very efficient M.C.
