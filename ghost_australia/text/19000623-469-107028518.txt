INDIAN SUPERSTITIONS. The Bhattia women are very superstitious. They believe in gho3ts, demons, and other supernatural beings; and to drive all these out of the house in the evening (for it is just before the lamps are lighted that all these evil spirits come into the house) a woman strikes a light and goes into each room and shows it in every dark corner,and the spirits, j who are supposed to have a great dislike to ' any kind of light, go quietly out of the ' house. Another custom is that they will not eat until a portion of their food is set apart for the cow, whom they all worship. They believe that their food will turn into poison ] ! if this is not done ; and one of the women or a servant takes it out and gives it to a cow j if one is in sight, or leaves it on one side of the road. ' But the most unnatural custom j that they have is that they never use the I name " mother " when speaking of or to their own mother, but they call her Bhabhi, I which means sister-in-law. Little children, | as well as grown up sons and daughters, call her so ; and the sweet name of " mother " is never heard in their homes. Again, a woman will never say " my son," but in speaking of him will say " the husband, or ! brother, or nephew of So-and-So." The first time a Bhattia woman says " my son " is after that son is dead. She believes that j if she calls him so while he lives a certain i goddess will get so jealous of her that she will strike him dead at once.
