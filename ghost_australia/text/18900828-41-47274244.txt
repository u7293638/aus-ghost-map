JOURNALISTIC HONESTY. TO THE EDITOR. Sir â€” The reading pubbc will require some thing more tangible than the 'wishy- washy' subleader appearing in the Advertiser on Monday as a reply to Mr. Hussey's charge accusing your con temporary of journalistic buffoonery and political jobbery of the most glaring description. Mr. Hussey deserves the thanks of the community for exposing such a disgraceful partizanship on the part of a paper which so often boasts of its numerous circula tion. Would it be too much to ask the Adver tiser in future to confine its columns to the re counting of 'tiger yarns' and 'ghost stories, r and leave the discussion of political and ot!.- v important matters to those papera whose columns are open for the discussion of both sides of the question. It would have been much more to the credit of the Advertiser had it confined itself to reply ing to Mr. Hussey's accusation, and not attempt by an evasion of the whole matter to throw out insinuations to the effect that you had been accused of altering a telegram purporting to be the feeling of James town on the political crisis. The telegram in question appeared in your columns in the exact form it left the hands of your correspondent. The Advertiser makes a big flourish at the end of their article about Mr. Hussey not acting for them in the future, but it is significant that the misleading statements originated in Way mouth-street, and not at Port Elliot. I am, Sir, &c;, J. H. TOUCHELL. Jamestown, August 26.
