Ghost-Hunting at Hackney. Skldom has such a scene occurred in a London churchyard as was witnessed during the early hours- of the morning of the 21st August in the churchyard of the old parish church of St. John at Hackney, when fully a thousand men and women turned out from their houses in the neighbourhood to hunt the par;sh ghost. For some time past people pass ing through, the churchyard late at night have been startled by ' a ghost in a sheet.' Women havu fainted with fright, and the local newspapers have published accounts of the strange affair. Whether this morning's scene was planned cannot be ascertained (says the Westminster Gazette of the 21stÂ»August), but between 10 and 11 o'clock last night a mixed crowd began to assemble at the rear of the church where the ghost was supposed to be, and where in the usual way scarcely anyone passes after 11 (?'clock. A Jong wait until midnight, and then, as ' no ghost ? appeared, the crowd went in search of it. Armed with lanterns and candles, and carrying sticks and stones, the crowd climbed the railings from the pathways, and took possession of the burial-ground. Graves and tombstones were clambered over, and recently restored mounds were trampled down. A portion of the crowd looked upon the whole affair as a joke, and consequently every few minutes the cry was foolishly raised of 'There it goes I' and immediately the whole crowd rushed in the direction indicated, and, as no ghost could bu seen, it. was argued by the more superstitious portion of the crowd :that the ghost had 'disappeared into the earth. Others in the crowd amused themselves. by making the night hideous with imitations of unearthly cries, and although the police were called to clear the place, it was not until the verge of daylight that tho last few dis appointed stragglers went away.
