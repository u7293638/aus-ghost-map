I C CURRENT LITERATURE. Mr Froude has published, as a volume supplementary to his History of England, a detailed account of the proceedings connected with The Divorce of Catherine of Aragon (Longmans) It is in some sort an apology as well as a supplementary answer to those who objected to his character of Henry VIII, and a A indication of his method of writing history As a supplement we cannot regard the book as necessary As an apology and a defence it is imperfect, failing m precisely those points in which Mr I Froude is weak The excuse for the writing of his volume is that certain papers connected with the transactions of that period especially the despatches of ChnsBajs the Imperial Ambassador in langland ure now for the first time available We do not know that they materially affect the story of Henry s quarrel with Rome, which is really the important question, as we have all known it, even as it appears to Mr Froude Mr Froude a position which is re affirmed and maintained in his introduction, is that Henry VIII has been maligned by the " orthodox historians that granted that he was a little loose in his matrimonial enterprises, and rough in his manner of getting out of them, he was, on the whole, actuated by patriotic and con scientious motives in at least his conduct towards Catherine of Aragon that if he was wrong he was wrong in company with Gummer and Ridley and Latimer and other good, men if he acted, as the orthodox historians represent him to have acted from motives of personal greed or lust or wounded pride only, then the England of the Cromwells and the Cianmers, the Howards and the Fitzwilliams, the Wnothesljs and the Pages, must have been made of baser materials than any land of which mankind has preserved a record '-a conclusion to which, perhaps, the orthodox would not demur Mr Froude s own view is that the Reformation was "the greatest incident in English history-the root and source of the expansive force which has spread the Anglo Saxon race over the globe, and imprinted the English genius and character on the constitution of mankind and he is " unwilling to believe more evil than I can help of my country men who accomplished so beneficent a work 'The orthodox might, oath pio bably will, triumphantly point to this very puRsue as a proof of Mr 1 roude s unfitness to deal impartially with so perplexed a question A writer who is " unwilling to believe e, whose incredulity is admitted to spring entirely from patriotic leanings, is hardly one who can be trusted to examine the evidence calmly and dispassionately So far as this, we are willing to believe with Mr Froude Henry VIII desired a son to succeed him in his not too firmly established dominion The nation, doubtless, fully shared in the Kings desire Catherine of Aragon was believed to be past child bearing Had Henry put her away for political reasons, he would have been justified by the good of his country and by numerous precedents But in that age divorce was impossible, or, at least, only granted as an extreme favour by the Pope to any king Catherine was powerfully her family and connections and, being a high spirited, passionate woman, was not likely to accommodate her husband by a peaceful surrender of her rights of a wire the Pope would probably have made no scruple as to granting a divorce had he not been influenced by the then all power ful Emperor of Germany and King of Spain that the Reformation did not spring merely out of Henry a quarrel with the Pope, but from other causes connected with the political and national character of 1 Englishmen, must be obvious to every impartial and non orthodox student of the times Whether Mr li Froude has greatly ash danced the interests of either Henty or the Reformation by his book is another question It is a work which abundantly testifies to the authors power of rhetoric and to his command of style but we are not impressed, any more than mother of Mr Froude's w orita, by the display of those quality is most essential in a historian judgment, sagacity, impartiality, and acumen 111 the a weighing of evidence There is no room here for description, in which art Mr 1 Froude is strongest, nor is there much of a story to tell, such us the delights in reading, but plenty of balancing of reasons and motives, which is precisely where Mr. 1 roude 13 weakest Those who have followed Sir Edwin Arnold round the world in the London Daily Telegraph, as well as those who have not, will be glad to have his letters in the handsome form of Seas and Lands (London Longmans, Melbourne Melville, Mullen, and Slade) What is unusual 111 letters written for new papers, they are even better in their permanent shape than in their first ephemeral appearance Sir Edwin Arnold made, as we all know, the circuit of the earth, going by America and returning from Japan via India and Cey low His description of his travels and of the countries and peoples he visited abounds in all those gorgeous effects of style with which we are familiar in our author, in prose and verse Sir Edwin Arnold has a flowing pen, a keen faculty of observe tion, and especially a high sense of colour and beauty His pictures of Japan and the Japanese are especially good Among this delightful people, who up peal to be in a fair way of becoming the spoilt children of mankind SirlMwinwas particulars recommended by his great poem in praise of Buddha " 'I he Light of Asia ' His book is made additionally attractively numerous pictures better rendered than usual from photographs Mr Edward Laman Blanchard, whose Life and Reminiscences, in two large volumes, are given with almost superfluous breadth of detail by Messrs. Clement Scott and Cecil Howard (Hutchinson), was an excellent and most amiable man, of a type which is now fast disappearing from the world-thehterarj Bohemian, who lived by his pen that was a living, during the earlier part of Blanchard s career, which was none too luxurious In deed, this record of a writing minis life during the first half and the middle of the century is for this reason alone deeply interesting For Blanchard the struggle for existence began from his boyhood and continued during the whole of a life, the most busy and active ever led, perhaps by any one whom this generation can remember And few of those who encountered this pleasant looking, ever cheerful, and juvenile younger man at any of his favourite haunts-the Edmbro Castle in the Strand, the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet street, and latterly at the Arundel Club at the bottom of Salisbury-street of which this institution (one of whose unwritten rules is that the the last man to 1,0 turns out the gas and tiles in the milk) Blanchard was one of the most frequent and constant of frequenters lew of those who exchanged chaff and chat with the brave and honest gentleman, ever guessed how keen with him was the battle against poverty and misfortune and the thousand ills which assail the ( usual penman From his ear best years Blanchard was a journalist, ready for all work and doing all work when ever be could get it, at a rate which the lordly newspaper man of the present day blushes to hear of He was the son of a comic actor who had acquired a certain reputation in his time, which be left to his family as their sole inheritance At sixteen young Blanchard was already at work, writing play bills for the minor theatres, and paragraphs for the small journals From astrology to pantomime essay a, sketches, tales, descriptive articles, lecturer plans nothingcameamisstohim excoptthepajment for them, which was absurdly small, and subject to interruptions At sixteen he sub edited Pinnock s Guide to hnmoMp' and Moore's Almanack Before that he had travelled in the provinces with a conjuror, in which walk of life he acquired a facility in prestidigita tion which in after 5 years was the amuse most of his friends When barely out of his teens he had written a prodigious number of dramas, for which, when paid at all, he would be remunerated at ten shillings an acre He wrote short skirts for the ephemeral comic papers and fly sheets whose many names we have forgotten Journalism was then very much " in the gristle Blanchard was glad to get " a crown ' for a thrilling notice, and something cutting and moral was thought to be lavishly paid for by seven and sixpence Blanchard's adventures with those who employed him, who were mostly as impecunious as himself, and not half so honest, were very ludicrous, though the record of them is pitiful One of his publishers was a Mr Olinthus Bostock, for whom he had written a story at once thrilling and didactic It was on the career of George Barnwell When hard at work and looking forward eagerly to the promised pay there entered to Blanchard the publisher, with a rueful countenance and a request for the loan of a pound, on the ground that the paper maker wanted some thing on account and until he was paid a trifle would not send the ghost of a quire " Have mercy on me, Mr Blanchard I 'you don't know the straits of mercantile men You are at work in your shirt-sleeves , let me have your coat and waistcoat to raise a few shillings on them The author gave up the garments and was requested to surrender his boots as well which with an illustrated Bible would reach the required sovereign Blanchard had great difficulty in rescuing his clothing-the pub Usher wanting, to have his trousers too as a last resource, which demand Blanchard had to refuse protesting that he was " not going to light this ridiculous situation in a state of semi nudity For want of clothes he had I to pass the night in the printers study little office, and could only get out late (the next afternoon upon the loan of a watchman greatcoat and a pair of slippers from a laundresS Of similar scenes there is a plentiful crop in these volumes At last, after writing for years for publishers, managers and printers upon a bare subsistence Blanchard was for tunate enough, after repeated essays in "flimsy, to be accepted as a regular con- tributors of theatrical and other notices to the Daily Telegraph at first upon no magnificent stipend-to rise painfully in years after to the post of dramatic critic for that journal of the largest circulation The records of his gratitude to the family of Levy (now Lawson) are touching in their revelation of simplicity and purity of heart which no poverty or neglect could spoil To the present genera- tion Blanchard is chiefly known as the writer of pantomimes In fact pantomimes and obituary notices wore what he lived upon No one ever wrote so many of them and certainly no one ever wrote better ones though he complains repeatedly in his diary of the poetry and sentiment being taken out of his pieces by the managers to make room for scenic effects and " legs To the lust Blanchard preserved a certain freshness of heart and simplicity of soul which were very attractive to Ina companions and a strange character for him to retain after his arduous struggles in life with publishers, editors, and people of that sort His Diary, which forms the bulk of these two volumes, is very scrappy and all too brief and disjointed, but together with the ample notes by Mr Cecil Howard it forms a storehouse of information for all time to come regarding the state of journalism and the drama during the middle period of the nineteenth century Mr Clement Scott's contribution to the work is out short, but graceful in spirit and in good taste 'the Country of the Vosges by Henry W Wolff (Longmans), is an admirable book of combined description and personal adventure, treating m precisely the most attractive manner of a region which is one of the most delightful in Europe Those who have visited it can never wonder at the intensity of the longing which France has for the recovery of her lost Alsace and Lorraine It is true that the country was originally German, as the language of the people and the names of the places with ciently indicate It is true that the French dominion was a matter of yesterday originally acquired by force or fraud, to which the consent of the people was never obtained It is true that Germany, as the conqueror exercised no more than her right in recovering possession of her loSt provinces What would the french have done had they been victors in the war of 1870-1' Vv with all this there cannot be a doubt as Mr W olfl s pages show, that the sentiment of the Vosges is still rather French than German in spite of his tory and of ethnology There is one practical reason why it should be so Up to the eve of the French Revolution Alsace and Lorraine were probably somewhat lukewarm in their attachment to France Lorraine had only been French for some half a century , Alsace was thoroughly German in blood in speech, and in aspirations But there was no part of Europe into which the Revolution broughtsomuch relief and whercitdid so much substantial good as in these frontier regions which suffered more than any part of France or Germany from the abuses of the feudal system This is the secret of the present attachment of the ^ eager people to 1 rains It is to France that they owe what liberty they have They have returned the gift by contributing to an extraordinary extent to the glories of the Revolutionary and the Imperial wars There is scarcely a village in the Vosges which did not send some illustrious warrior to the French ranks Many of Napoleon's best generals were Alsatians or Lorrainers as every, kleber, kellermann c At present it is curious to read what Mr Wolf) has to say about the political sentiment of this region Of Strasburg he say 8 - ' In 1861 I found the whole city German, very German except the official apex which, of course, was Trench In 1890 the apex was as distinctly German but the city had become to a considerable degree I reach French in speech, French m manners, French in sentiment ' What may be the result in another fifty years supposing that in the meanwhile the i earache is not accomplished, no one can predict, but it is impossible to ignore one important factor which is working for Germany, namely, the greater rate of increase of population among the Germans than among the French Politics apart. and he does not meddle with them more than there is occasion for-Mr Wolff has written a very pleasant and interesting book on the innumerable delights of the Vosges country The Life of James Boswell, of Auchmlec!, With an Account of His sayings doings, and II if in/s by Percy I it7t,crnlil (Chatto and W Indus), is a specimen of Mr Fitzgerald's favourite art of book making, which is likely to obtain a kind of success among books to read though it is not worthy of Boswell, or even of Mr Fitzgerald Boswell though little better than a fool-yet a fool with flashes of genius wrote one of the cleverest and most amusing of books the very best biography perhaps many lanL,iini,e Mr Fitzgerald, who is no fool has written what is certainly not a good book There is very little in it that is new A few letters from, Romveil to John Wilkes appear for the first time, in one of which is this very naive and characteristic confession I have the most inconstant mind in the world. At times I can hardly help becoming a man of considerable parts but at other times I insensibly fall into a state little better than that of a blockhead ' It was a fortunate thing for Boswell that he made the acquaintance of Johnson, and no less forth unto for Johnson that he admitted this prattling Scotch coxcomb into his intimacy Had they never met the world would never have had a proper conception of either Johnson or Boswell F veil Mr Fitz Gerald though he protests against Macaulay 8 notice of Boswell is too contemptuous, sets too small value on Boswells undoubted abilities Vam weak and foolish as he was, Boswell had the sense to know when he had written his life of Johnson that he had produced the most entertaining collection that has appeared in this reign He, the best of biographers, surely deserve c3 a better biography Mr David Hannay s book on Rodney in the Men of Action series (Macmillan) gives evidence of care and conscientiousness in the writing but the effect is much frittered away by tedious de tail dissertations on uniform and naval discipline in c cannot help suspecting, more ever, that Mr Uatinay s knowledge of man time matters is less extensive than his lead mg of naval books Rodneys battles are described in a name which is scarcely m tel visible to saline n Mr Hiiniiny stems not very clear as to the distinction between larboard and starboard and by his misuse of technical terms makes it difficult for the reader to follow Rodney s tactics The great battle of the 15th of April 1782 for its results perhaps the most important and decisive ever fought at sea which raised England a prestige in the world when it had fallen to the lowest point and neutralised the effect of the disasters in America and claewherc-ia Rodney a chief title to fame and to his country's gratitude a title which Mr Haunay rather spoils by the intrusion of the question of whether Rodney borrowed his idea of breaking the enemy's line or not from Clerk of Lfdm. After all it was Rodney who fought and won the battle-not Clerk of vidin On Surrey Hills by A. Son of the Marshes (Blackwood) is one of the best of the numerous imitations of Richard Jefferies The Son of the Marshes has more humour than Teffenca had and perhaps more literary quality But he is a little too self-conscious of the pleasure which hero cures for his readers in dwelling upon the delights of the beautiful Surrey landscape surely a treasure such as the I ondoner intend) appreciates at its full worth Major W innate eMalidnsm and the Egyptian Soudan (Macmillan) is a most elaborate and exhaustive account of the rise and present condition of that singular movement-as much political and religious - which has created so much disturbance in Egypt Major M invite us an officer of the Egyptian army), has had the best possible opportunities of studying the history of the rebellion in the Soudan and his work will tend to dispel many of the prevailing illusions respecting the Mahdi and his influence and rule for instance the absurd | picture drawn by Mr Gladstone's imagination or conscience of a people struggling to be free is shown to be in entire fiction The people consist of five races differing essentially in character in origin and in opinion who have been brought together through the oppression of one great tribe the Baggaras The free dom which they have succeeded in winning is a system of terror which is only maintained by brutal force upon a basis of gross ignorance and the most revolting supers tion as)tern of which the people are already beginning to tire Major G Ingate a book, which includes the fullest and most authentic particulars of Gordon s death and the fall of Khartoum is illustrated by numerous maps and plans Mr T P O'Connor lina done a smart piece of work in his Charles Stewart Parnell A Memory Ward and Lock) Hardly was the breath out of the once great lender-the ' uncrowned king -the Moses who was to lead the tribes into the promise 1 land of Home Rule when Mr. O'Connor pub wished his memoir which with all its evidences of hasty composition must have been prepared for such an event in anticipation Mr. O'Connor's work is chiefly remarkable to the outside world for one curious an 1 rather important remark which surely must have slipped in without due consideration ' With one single exception Essays there was not one of us who regarded the divorce action in itself as a reason why Parnell should no longer be accepted as our leader we were politicians not censors or moralists Doubtless this is true but the utterance is a little unfortunate for the party The Pentateuch of Printing with a Chapter on Judges (JChot Stock) is an oddly named treatise on the history and development of printing by William Blades to which is appended a memoir of the learned and eccentric author by Mr Talbot I!
