The weather was fine, though a fresh wind blew asross the range. There were a number of spectators in attendance, amongst whom we noticed Lieutenant-Colonel Matthe ws and Major Claxton.of the L.M.F. It was in tended that the competition' for the Presi dent's Cup (obampion) should have been tired, but after the first and third-class matches were finished it was found that time would not per mit of it. The match was therefore postponed till July. The following are the scores obtained and the names of the prize-winners- - --- ■ prasT class; - - - • 1 v r : . Yards—400. 500. 600.;;' Ttl.

' ... 403 ■Adelaide Punch appears this week in a new and improved form. The paper has been enlarged in size,- and-contains considerably more literary matter than formerly, and it^ appear ance is altogether decidedly creditable. The chief cartoon, representing Mr. Bees, backed up by the Speaker exhibiting the ghost of the new Parliament buildings, is clever alike in concep tion and executing being a marked improve ment on those published in Punch previously. The smaller caricatures are also fairly well done,' and the title page is new and deoidedly better than the old one. The reading matter for the most part issmartly written withoutfcrenching in any way on the proprieties. We observe that, some advertisements apropos of the forthcoming elections for the Legislative. Council are illus trated by portraits of the candidates, some of whiGh are excellent likenesses. The proprietors deserve every success in their efforts to produce a satirical and , humorous paper, which will prove a credit to the cblony. The question of a new casualty hospital at Port Adelaide seems to be how finally settled. Some few weeks back it was onthe tapis to con vert the present Mercantile Marine 'Offices into ah hospital and to build new marine offices on a vacantplot of-ground oppositerthe institute in Nile-street. Lately however an agitation for a new court house arose, and it was suggested by Mr. D. Bower, M.P., that arrangements might be made fer procuring a better casualty, hospital and a new courthouse without going to the necessity of erecting more than one new build ing, as was at firstintended.. -With this object in view Mr Bower recently'invited the Com missioner of Pnblic Works, the Architeot-in Chief, and Mr. B; J. Turner (3.M. for Port Ade laide) to inspeot with him the various buildings and premises concerned in the proposed altera tions. After some consideration it was resolved that anew court house: should-be built, at the corner of Commercial-road and Nile-streetj and that the present Mercantile. Marine Offices should be converted into a casualty- hospital. The old court house and^adjoining rooms .will bh altered to receive the officers of the Mercan tile Marine, - - i . The . President of the ' Marine Board (Captain B. H. Ferguson, S.M.) commenced an investigation on Friday mofning,' July 2, into the loas iof ;the ketch Tasinan (Captain Thurston) off. Smith's Bay, jEangaroo Island, on June 24. It appeared-from the evidence that the. Tasman.. arrived at Smith's Bay from Port Adelaide oh: June 19, to load there with timber. ~ She was moored to a buoy with a 55 fatbom chain, and in addition had- an anchor down with 60 fathoms of cable. From the time Bhe arrived until .the following Sunday night the weather was-bad, but at that time there was only a slight; wind from the north-west blowing. No watoh was kept that night, all hands having turned"in; but just after mid night on the following morning the captain went on deck and found that the mooring cable bad parted, and that the anchor was dragging. In the meantime the weather had got rough again; the wind was blowing hard from the north-west, and there was a heavy sea running. .On seeing the state of things the captain oalled the mate and they at once let out another anohor, It was, however, of no use, as at 1 o'clock the ship bumped and struck heavily. No efforts were made to save the vemel from" destruction after she struck, the men having all they.could do to get ashoresafely. -Previous- to the accident- it was noticed .that -the barometer; was very ; low, bnt no anxiety was felt,.as* the ketch was con sidered to befirofiy held,.Oapfe. Thurston said he thought that Smith'sBay was not at all a.safe place for vessels in the -winter months. Capt. Fergusou.will give his-findinjron-the affair on Mohday. next. ' , . - ' ' ' "
