THE POEMS OF OSSIAN.— It has become fashionable to abuse the poems of Ossian ; but, admitting their forgery as well as faultiness, they seem to us, in their better passages, to approach more nearly than any modern English prose to the force, vividness, and patriarchal simplicity and tenderness of the Old Testament style. Lifting up like a curtain the mists of the past, they shew us a world unique and intensely poetical, peopled by heroes, bards, maidens, and ghosts, who are swathed in mist, and separated by their mountains from all countries and ages save their own. It is a great picture painted in clouds instead of canvass, and invested with colours as gorgeous as its shades are dark. Its pathos has a wild sobbing in it—an Æolian tremulousness of tone, like the wail of spirits. And than Ossian himself, the last of his race, answering the planets of the wilder- ness, the plover's shriek, the " hiss", of the homeless stream, the bee in the heather bloom, the rustle of the birch above his head, the roar of the cataract behind, in a voice of kindred freedom and kindred melancholy con- versing less with the little men around him than with the giant spirits bf his fathers—we have few finer figures in thu whole region of poety. Ossian, in short, ranks with the " Robbers" and the " Seasons" as a work of prodigal beauties, and more prodigal faults, and partly through both, has impressed the world.—Bards of the Bible.
