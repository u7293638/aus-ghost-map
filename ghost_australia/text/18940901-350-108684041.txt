BADGERY'S CREEK SCHOOL.-The following has been handed to us by Mr. S. E. Lees, M.P.: Arncliffe, 22ud August, 1894. Dear Mr. Lees, Thanks for your note of 20th inst. I am about again now though not quite up to form. Re Badgery's Creek, I trust that the school question will shortly be satisfactorily decided. The proximity of the Kemp's Creek School, the limited number of children between 6 and 14, and the cost of the site, &c.;, have been obstacles in the way, but the whole question is again under consideration, and will probably be settled in a very little time. I havo the honor to be, &c.;, H. S. KILLMAN. IN IT AGAIN.-Alf. Jackson, the Claremont ghost seer, who had quite a lively time over those bones, &c.;, which were found at Claremont, is again in trouble. It will bo remembered that Jackson shot a Chinaman up Orange way for a lark-and killed him too. He wasn't sentenced to death, but to a short stretch in gaol. Whilst in gaol he played up and got something extra for his pains. Recently ho came cut, but wasn't long free before he has again come to grief, for on Friday last, at Camden, he was committed for trial to the Campbell town Quarter Sessions for stealing six head of cattle, the property of Mr. Smith. FLOUR.-At the beginning of the present year Mr. H. C. Mathews of Acmo Roller Mills, Bathurst remodelled his mill to the Hungarian Full Roller System and the new dust has been gaining fresh friends daily, and is now to be found in every bake house of importance in the metroplis the suburbs' or alone; the Western line. With those who have already tried it, the opinion seems to be that to use the Acme Roller Flour is to have a large, light (we do not mean underweight) anil snow-white loaf. Of course all others mill produce is obtainable from the mill, and Mr. Mathews will bo pleased to answer all enquiries.* OFP TO THE DIGGINGS.-On Thursday last, Messrs. A. F, Cope, T. Carter, and J. Corner started out west to try their luck gold digging. They have with them a good turn-out, two horses and a covered dray, as well as a supply of provisions for three months, and tools of every description. Cope is a handy man and can do anything from a job in engineering, down to pick and shovel work. Carter is a first-class brick layer but is willing to turn his hand to anything. Jack Corner is also one of Penrith's best carpenters and joiners, he too is willing to turn his hand to anything. The latter has had some experience of roughing it, having visited Coolgardie. They all intend going for the precious metal if it is to be got, but in the meanwhile they intend doing any job they come across. SANDER AND SONS' EUCALYPTI EXTRACT. In protection of the world-wide fame our manu facture has acquired all over the globe, we nublish the following :-Hazard, M.D,, Professor of General Pathology and diseases of the Mind and Nervous System, says in an editorial published in the Clinical Record :-" We have examined half-a dozen . specimens of different manufactures: the preparation of Sander and Sons was the only one that proved to be reliable and corresponding to scientific tastes." Another concoction called " Re fined Extract of Eucalyptus," has made its appear ance since. This product stands, according to Dr. Owen, foremost in causing injurious effects. That gentleman communicates at a mooting of the Medical Society of Victoria, that a child living at Fitzroy became most seriously indisposed through its use. In another case a lady states on the strength of statutory declaration that she suifcred cruelly from the effccts of the same concoction To guiirdtlie high reputation of our manufacture we feel waranted in exposing the above fncts, and desire the public to exercise care and precaution when buying. SANDER & SONS.-(Advt.) MULGOA MISHAPS.-On Sunday last quite a large number of Penrith residents paid a visit to Mulgoa, Some went as far as the river, whilst others made Mr. F. Boylan's the terminus, and there were several other places QÂ£ call. Among the number were 4-lderpjan and Mrs. Easterbrook and Alderman Rcid, who made tlieir stopping place Mr. J. D. Ensterbrook'a. The party, who were in. a light buggy, had a good trip out, except that the horse shied terribly at a heap of wood lying on the road side near the Regentville bridge, and the party narrowly escaped being thrown into the creek. After resting and looking round Mr. J. D. Ensterbrook'a establishment, thefv started^ for home. Just before reaching the bridge in question, " Blink Boy" (Alderman Easterbrook's horse) began playing up. He kicked, jumped and bucked and all soon became terribly alarmed. Alderman Reid was the first to meet mother'eartlj, then followed Alderman Easterbrook, then Mrs. Easter broqk. Alderman Easterbrook was not much injured^ but Alderman Reid and Mrs. Easterbrook were. Alderman Easterbrook soon secured the animal and the pnrty were quickly on tljeir way homewards. Mrs. Easterbrook is a good deal knocked about, and Alderman Reid was unable to get about until- Wednesday. Alderman Easter brook is O.K.
