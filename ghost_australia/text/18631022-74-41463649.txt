WESTERN RAILWAY. To the Editor of the Launceston Examiner. SIR,—Your two correspondents, "A Farmer" and "No Surrender," are not, perhaps, aware that my last communication to you on the sub- ject of Mr. Doyne's letter, was written before your correction of the error contained in it. I now perceive, quite as clearly as those two writers do, Mr. Doyne's meaning, which, as you pointed out Sir, was not clear before. The would-be great commentator on Mr. Doyne's epistle is en- tirely mistaken if he supposes me to be opposed to the project of the Western Railway. Rather than see it given up altogether I would fight for it under the banner of the promoters; but I consider myself justified in urging upon the public an equally efficient and a safer scheme, concerning which I am perhaps somewhat more qualified to give an opinion than that renowned queller of croakers "No Surrender," though I ought to be cautious as to what I write of him, for he may be the ghost of the great Newcastle engineer, Stephensonius redivivus. If "A Farmer" had read my letter with less culpable careless- ness, I may good humoredly remind him, he would have noticed that I had not seen your correction of Mr. Doyne' letter. I believe Mr. Doyne to be a very able civil engineer; but that is no reason why, in so very momentous a matter as the expenditure of £400,000, the strictest criticism should not be applied to his statements. And now it appears that Messrs. Peto, Brassey and Co. have not tendered within the £400,000, but at £15,000 above that sum; so that there is good reason to fear that, with extra require- ments, and the compensation for land, the total cost would be little short of £450,000. In constructing our railway under Mr. Doyne's guidance, we should set a very bad example of economy to the Government, whom we con- stantly accuse of extravagance. I am, Sir, Your obedient servent, W. ARCHER. Cheshunt, Oct. 17.
