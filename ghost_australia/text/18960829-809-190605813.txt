GOLD AT YARRA GLEN. to the editor op the age. Sir, — A short time ago you published n report of tho conditions under whicli rhining operations woro carried ou nt Yarra Gleu> and stated that up to the present no q uartz mining ventures wero working. I beg to inform you that the Ghost Gully Gold Mining Company was incorjioratcd on 2oth April this year for the purpose of mining for a reef which was supposed to exist at the head of Ghost Gully, Steel's Creek. A shaft has been sunk to a depth of (5(5 feet, niid a cross cut put in 87 feefc, in dhig which several very rioli loaders were imsscd. After the oroscut had boon driven 70 feet, a mass of blue pug wns encountered and although thin has been cut into to n distance t of 12 feet, no wall hns been reached. Tbc pug is intermixed with very tninuto quartz, and hns been as?aycd, tho unsay Iwing — gold, 18 dwt.; silver, 22 dwt. Resides the pug large boulders have been met with, and have evidently been brought down with some volcanic eruption, as they aro found in tho middle of tho pug, and upon assay havo given almost the same return. From tho enor mous width of tho mass, a very low percentage would pay ; but it is the intention of tho com pany to go through this, and then sink a winze, when it is anticipated a very rich reef will bo discovered nt little depth, as this formation must be disrupted from one. Tlio company hag a capital of £230') in 20,000 shares of 2a. fid., and tlio shareholders arc naturally very pleased with the prospects. — Yours, Ac., A. S. DLOOMFIELD, Manager. Tho Ghost Gully Gold Mining Company. ! 418 Collins- street, 28th August.
