A SEASONABLE INVITATION. COME out with me, come out with, me, And watch the sunset from the sea. Where is the boat, you'd like to know ? The boat is sleeping on its side, On the tawny sands up which the tide Is crawling in the cove below. Come out with me, come out-the moon, That all the sultry afternoon Looked like the ghost of herself as she lay Whelmed in the blue, will be stealing soon Pale fire, from the dying touch of day, And lighting with her beam the way For those who wander o'er the deep ; And the silver stars by twos and threes Out of the gathering shades will peep . To view themselves in the waters fair And better still a gentle breeze Begins to blow delightfully You can see it yonder, sweeping o'er The liquid golden floor. Of the dying suns most high pavilion, , Breaking its smoothness up into a million Small diamond sparkles-come with me, Come out, and taste the freshening air. , One shall steer and one shall row (Then we'll be face to face, you know,) And over the water we will go, And have such talk the while-I trow About all things in earth and heaven : Sometimes we'll pause and for a spell Sit watching the wild face of even, Gleaning such lore from her sweet looks As never can be found in books Which some we know love all too well ; Or listening to the curlew's cry, Piercing the stillness near at hand, As silently we drift hard by The reedy margin of the land. -Elise Cooper.
