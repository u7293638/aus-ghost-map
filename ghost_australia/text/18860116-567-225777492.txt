A liOKl \ TEAK. It is over twenty-nine years since we were able to view Saturn an perihelion before, and that is the length of a Saturni&n; year. While in perihelion he is under certain conditions nearest the earth, and under circumstances most isvouraDie to scientitic observation. His journey around the sun of 9,000,000,000 miles covers almost a generation of the lives of tbe men and womeu of this planet, and when he makes each fresh appearance with his present distinctness, it is an event indeed. The science of astronomy is enlarging as con stantly and as rapidly as any other science, and the observations that astronomers will now be able to take of tbe splendid planet under its present favourable conditions, onght to add much to the information con cerning it, and certainly none of the heavenly bodies has inspired more eager or intelligent research than the one whose return we celebrate. But what a journey is made by this luminaiy, whose mean distance from the sun is 881,000,000 miles, or more than nine times the distance of the earth. If It has a race of brings fitted to exist at such a distance from the source of beat light, what lengthy seasons they must en joy. Under snch conditions there would be some satisfaction in having a seaside cottage or a mountain chalet, for what they would coll their heated term would extend over a number of years. But the fact is a hundred millions of miles or so make very little differ ence in those almost unimaginable distances. Probably distance leads enchantment to the view. But when our earth is dead, then Saturn and the other great planets in the coarse of some millions of years will take their turn in physical development, and per haps in some countless ages hence the wan dering ghosts that have vanished from the ; earth will reappear in new forms of life upon the yet imperfect, bat magnificent world rolling in space and waiting for its day to dawn. â€” rroozdence JournaL
