^dtdtlm §0ettgi CHILDHOOD'S FAITH. When life's long journey I began. And all around mi strange and new — Long ere I crew to be a man. Or read the boots ol learning though — What grand conceptions filled my bead '. WUat wooden startled eye and ear ! Ere cruel science argced dead Ibe baby senses, love and fear. I feared the dark, I loved the light. And when the bright green earth 1 trod For sunlight -was the smile of God : .Ard when the son had passed away, Its ghost I thought the moon to be ; Mtch nearer than the god of day. More cold and rpirit like than be. I thought the stars were signal lights By »?!? geb- in their windcw* placed. That through the locg and lonely nights Our paths to hnnn might be traced ; And when a star *hot down the sty, I breathless -watched the fading spark, And thought perhaps the angeliidie. And then their windows will be dark. VTben lightning flashed a'oDg the cloud, The Lord in anger glared at us ; The thnndar following long and loud, To me was but His warning voice. The sparkling rain that came amain Was but the tears the Father sbed, Secause Bis children strayed again. Arid love to Him was cold and dead. Now I am old, and day by day The Ood so near my infant eyes 'Has far acd farther waned away. And I am sceptical and wise. But am I happier, knowing more ? Would I be happy, knowing all 7 With naught to love nor to adore, Not power to rise, nor chance to fall? If this is all that knowledge gives. Let me toward the ciadle move Back to a. woi Id whtre credence lives, Atd hearts feel reverence and love. -Give me again God's sunlight smile ; The twinkling stars that angels light ; The thutder, tbengh I quake the wnUe ; The son's pale ghost that walks by night. Give me the anger of H13 eye, « nd I will tremble and adore : Give me Bis tears, that fill the sky With mercy for the weak and poor ; Give me the wonder end the faith. Give me the sorrow and the psin ; Tis mockery all that science saith — I'll be the trusting child again.
