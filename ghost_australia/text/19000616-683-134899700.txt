Songs of the Down trodden* FOR THOSE WHO FAIL. 'All honor to him who shall win the prize,' The world has cried for a thou ? sand years ; But to him who tries, and falls, and dies, I give great honor and glory and tears. Give glory and honor and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born in Time in advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies shame, ' And lets God finish the thought - sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine ; But the man who fails and yet Btill fights on, - Lo! he is the twin- born brother of mine. â€” Joaquin Miller. ? - X? - ?
