ANOTHER GREAT SPIRIT SEANCE AT CASTLEMAINE, BY THE SAME PERFORMERS, ON WEDNESDAY EVENING. Castlemaine, Wednesday Afternoon. [By Electric Telegraph—From, our Special Beporter.] 4 P.M. The midday train from Melbourne is arriving. Messrs. CHARLES BRIGHT, JAMES SERVICE. H. G. TURNER, STANFORD, Detective BLACK, and your reporter are now on the platform, where Mr P. is waiting. Mr P. is excited beyond description, as liis house was chock-full of spirits all last night, and Mrs P. bad been carried four times round the room, twice on her head. 4.10. Great curiosity from the crowd to see Mr SERVICE, as lie is already known here as the female weigher-in. 4.12. Mr TURNER is missing. Detective BLACK is arresting a boy to keep bis hand in. Mr BRIGHT and Mr TURNER are embracing three female spiritists, old seancists, and altogether tbe scene is most impressive. 4.14. The crowd will not leave Mr. SERVICE alone. They want him to weigh some one, but Mr. P. objects, as be wants all SERVICE'S odic force for the great scene to-night. 4.16, TURNER is found. He and STANFORD were sitting on an old man to keep their mesmerisms healthy. It is agreed for a general move to Mr. P.'s house, as Mrs. P. bas tea ready. The crowd call for one cheer for BRIGHT and SERVICE, whom they • designate tbe " women-weighers." 4.28. Here we are, and the wires connected. I shall now signal every movement to you, even if it may be considered indelicate, but my duty to you, &c.; 4.30. A general tea. I find Mr. and Mrs. P. are fearfully excited, aud promise a huge succcss. A scene occurred at tea. TURNER'S hand became entangled in the housemaid's back hair, but thanks to BRIGIIT'S able defence of TURNER'S love of long hair, all difficulties are over. BLACK eats terrifically for a detective. He won't use a fork. This is considered a good sign (by STANFORD) of electricity being in the air. STANFORD is showing P. samples of a new SINGER sewing machine, which Mrs. P. is in ecstacies about. SERVICE wants to pray, but Mr. P. says bis spirits object. SERVICE IS now sitting closer to his liquor, aud everybody is excited. 4.40. It is intended to so right off into the next room, aud buck at these spirits. Betting, f to 1 on the ghosts. BLACK is missing. TURNER is eetting into a dignified attitude. He reports for the Unitarian Gazette to-night, as the Argus considered his report of Tuesday indelicate. BRIGHT reports for Dr. PERRY aud JAMES ALIPIUS, SERVICE for the Presbyterian Synod and CHARLEY WRIGHT. BLACK will take notes for the Police Gazette, STANFORD for the New York Herald, and the rest you know. It is intended to open with a benediction by SERVICE, a short account of the London aud Lancashire Company by BRIGHT, aud notes will be telegraphed to HENRY HARWOOD, City Missionary, GEO. CRISP, President of the Hebrew City Mission, and F. W. HADDON, editor of the Prahran Telegraph, . 4.50. A disgraceful scene has happened. Mr. BLACK was m tlie kitchen examining two Scotch servant girls with a view to any con cealments, whereupon Mr. SERVICE threatened to resign as the weigher-in of spiritistic women ; then BRIGHT interfered, offering to tackle the whole seance solus, and Mr. BLACK struck him. The utmost efforts were made, and were successful at last in restoring order, Mr. SERVICE'S wrath being soothed by his being allowed to lift an old woman instead of weighing her—13 stone 6, clothes in ! Order restored. Temperature 76. Wind N.N.AV. Heiglit of water above summer level, 13 feet. No sheep crossing. Only cows. 5 p.m. At last we are at it. I am standing. All the rest save BLACK are sitting. A peculiar smell is noticeable, and the detective is endeavouring to .arrest it. Mr. P. and Mr. STANFORD are together. The mesmeric atmosphere is greatly disturbed by the smell. The smell is of Geneva. 5.6. BLACK has found the smell. It was whiskey escaping from a flask in Mr. SERVICE'S pocket. Order is restored, and the table shows signs of weakness. Before putting out the last light, we have been weighed again. SERVICE weighs better than ISAAC HINDS, of the V. E. C. TURNER weighs remarkably light. He is evidently padded. 5.10. Four minutes spent in total darkness. 5.11. I felt something crawling mysteriously about me, and called out, whereupon BLACK put the light up. BRIGHT was grasping STANFORD'S hand! how strange, how wonderful! SERVICE wishes to weigh again. 5.12. Mrs. P. says there is a spirit about, the signs being a pale light across STANFORD'S nose—Mr. P. knows the spirit, it being an old visitor to the great centre, and known as PUMPKINSQUASE:, an Indian. Excitement'fearful, and raps frequent. BLACK is anxious to light up, but SERVICE refuses. BBIGHT is breathing heavily : TURNER is giggling, and STANFORD says he can't stand the tickling of the mesmeric force. SERVICE wants to weigh again. 5.14. Without a moment's warning a heavy weight fell on the table, and a splash of dust followed, causing us to sneeze frightfully. Upon the light blazing up, the table was literally covered with oatmeal, and all seated. 5.16. We are weighing. Mrs. P., Mr. P. and self are to an ounce. SERVICE is two pounds lighter. All eyes are on him. His pockets are oatmeal. A Scotch spirit did it—BLACK says it seems to him, " adjective rot." 5.26. A shriek and a yell, then a sigh. No one knows where we may be in an hour. BLACK thinks the gaol. BRIGHT has got a spirit, through the medium, an old decayed insurance agent. He says they are doing building risks where he is at 2 per cent.; marine lower. BRIGHT is terribly excited. Nothing heard for some minutes. SER- VICE wants to weigh P. P. says SERVICE is too anxious on weighing. 5.32. BLACK without being told put the light up suddenly. I find we have all changed places. BRIGHT was sitting close to an elderly lady who had fainted. TURNER had his hand in SERVICE'S pocket, near the flask. P. had lost all knowledge of where he left off. His hands were everywhere. SERVICE was weighing himself, and one of his boots was missing. Mrs P. insists on a weigh. SERVICE insists on a change in the programme. 5.35. Singing is necessary. SERVICE is leading out a solemu hymn. TURNER is singing seconds. BRIGHT is playing on a petitionary principle. BLACK is cursing in detective yet plain language. STANFORD is quoting kerosene oil to an imaginary spirit inquiry. I am going gradually yet undeviatingly mad. Mrs P. is giving P. a treat—lie is weighing her. 5.40. BRIGHT is up ; he says he is full on it. SERVICE is trying a Scotch hymn taught by an old precentor. We had two spirits present before SERVICE tried singing ; at present we can't raise half a spirit. They say that SERVICE has a lot to learn in the musical world. I am weighing Mrs P.; she is falling off steadily. Poor P. is hugging BLACK, and TURNER is in the kitchen searching for imaginary concealments J 5/45. Without a moment's warning, BLACK put the light up. Mr. and Mrs. P. were busily engaged crowding the table with sides of bacon and tumblers of water, as also mysterious articles, totally unlike the delicate vases of Etruscan lore. SERVICE is now praying. His perorations are living examples of fogged deadened brains, with a serious admixture of broad Scotch earnestness and cannyness. 5.50. Mrs. P. demands a weigh. Her honour is at stake. The odds are 10 to 1 on the spirits for non- attendance. BRIGHT is outside praying in a petitionary sense, with an excited crowd in the garden. BRIGHT, on his pray, displayed great tact in quoting his fire risks. BRIGHT is elevated even above snuff. TURNER is sitting on the back fence selling carte de visites of the new Governor. He is doing a steady business, the spectators taking him for a perfect stranger. Detective BLACK arrested himself in the act of blowing out his candle, He has released himself in heavy bail. He says spirit rackets lick Chinese gambling. 6 p.m. Mrs. P. is weigliing^SERVICE. This is immense. If Mrs. P. is eightounces short, does'it justify SERVICE in advising her of a shipment of JOHN MOIR'S sauces 1 Poor STANFORD is rubbing kerosene oil into P.'s back hair. 6.4. SERVICE is weighing the elderly female ; she is a stone short. BRIGHT has returned, prayed out, arm in arm with TURNER, sold out. BLACK is using most undignified language. SERVICE begins a song. Mrs P. is missing; STANFORD is missing; P., poor P., has fainted. Noises are heard in the air. The cry savours of " Turn'em-out, P. —them ere Peeblesites and Dunnites; let's get at 'em ! Go it, SER- VICE—weigh'em, old man!" ( Commmication interrupted by locusts.) MENTAL ACCOUCHEMENT.—Anything bom in mind.
