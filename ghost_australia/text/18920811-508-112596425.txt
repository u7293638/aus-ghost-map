According to 'Cranbrook,' like all the progeny of Meg Merrilies, her' daughter Meg is possessed of the gift of galloping, and the way she won at Geelong was a caution. This filly is as quiet as the prover bial sheep, and shewed none of that bad tem per so- noticeable in her sisters Maddelina and The Shrew. Without- a doubt the finest looking youngster which sported silk in the Geelong First Two-year-old Stakes was Zeph, the half- sister to Magic Circle. Zeph is, I fancy, juBt a trifle longer on the leg than her illustrious relative, Lonsdale, whom she much resembles ' on top,' and, judging by appearances, weight should not trouble her when she gets set. Despite the oft repeated cry that the totalisator kills racing, the leading ciubs in Adelaide appear to be doing very well. At the annual meeting of the Adelaide Racing Club the chairman congratulated the members on the Bound position, and the report showed 'the revenue from all sources for the past season has been J?13,025, being an increase of .£305 on the amount received last year. The club has paid away in stakes ,£7579, as against .£6770 paid last year, an increase of .£809, and is able to show a profit at each of the meetings, notwith standing the inclement weather during the Birthday Meeting. Since the club was formed in January, 1889, to June, 1892, they have given in stakes the sum of .£21,994, and expended in improvements .£5232, salaries and wages £4466, on course and track .£1516, and the various charities have received .£1142, thus in three - and a half years they have expended no less than the sum of .£34,350.' From Hobartville eomes the information that the imported mare Terrara has slipped twin foals. She was stinted te Marvellous. rThe,2-year-old colt by Marvellous . from Ethel, who wos raffled last Monday at Newcastle, was won by Mr. Fisher, of Braden. The colt looks a good one.
