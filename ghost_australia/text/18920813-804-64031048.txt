ri! trM ... ... . j¡¡ |j¡jj THERE are many curious family traditions J ll connected with the ancestral homes of the éf'ft aristocracy and landed gentry, in the United Kingdom. These traditions have |l ?4 been handed down for generations, and I'111 events, portents,: warnings, have been ff [J noted, Been, and heard in later years, even MM in our own time. There are numerous Jj^k Haunted Houses in this country ; in the <fj;'5f old world many castles and country fl 'H houses have their own special apparitions, *, ,*f sounds, or sights which have been heard I Ifr. or seen by visitors of undoubted veracity, I fy who have testified to the facts as set forth J |':| by Sir Bernard Burke and other writers of îj pf tradition. % fi We do not propose to unearth ghost |j.y stories in these columns ; stories which J! have been worn threadbare by much tell I y ing. Our purpose is to relate the facts of l[¡;||¡;| certain true and actual occurrences-of || |i signs, and tokens, and warnings, which, I ^| though traditional, are true as any state ments can render them. Some of our family histories have revealed curious iffl'l events in olden days : dark, deeds which SjM have left their stains upon the annals of \jjt\ the house ; and events which did not bear mM the light in former days are thus revealed, jlj J'jg The blessing, it may be-the curse,"it may jj be-the actual warning is to this day lip fulfilled in many a family. Many a pre jj ri diction, regarded as an old wife's fable, ;| li has been exactly fulfilled under circum !'! j;| stances the most unlikely to favour them, jijij We propose, therefore, to relate, with «jj |?] such surrounding incident as may appear j]>.;ji| suitable, the legends and the facts con jjjl^l nected with some of our ancient houses. ||| The framework may beat times modern, II III ^ut *k® picture, the fact, the history, will |c|jf De true to the annals of the time. The ii^4|| experiences of those who have witnessed sj! j,!',) or perceived the phantoms, who have lived f?f|| in the haunted houses, will be given with I ifi authority, and no inventions of the writer jji fl!] shall interfere with them.
