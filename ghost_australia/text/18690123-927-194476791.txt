Her name is Mrs. Lemin. She was babtised at St Stithian's Church, May 3, 1764, )6 in possession of all her faculties, and seems likely to live some years longer. The Pbikce Alfred Hospital. — Tbe Com mittee of the Institute, in passing the following resolution, have placed in the early history of the hospital a grateful tribute to the memory of the late Mr. Francis Burdett Franklyn ;--' Re solved that this Committee place on record tbeir deep sense of the loss sustained by them through the death of Mr. F. B. Franklin, to whose zeal, activity, judgment, and urbanity, a* a member 01 Uommittee, the movement for a new hospital is greatly indebted. Tost a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Mrs. Franklyo, with an expression of the persot-J esteem and regard which were entertained for Mr. Franklyh by the members of the Committee, and of their deep sympathy with her in her great bereave ment'— Herald. Fish AccuvmsATioK.— On Friday last, the 15th inst., Mr. Bockland, who arrived by the Southern Cross, in charge of the yonug trout, proceeded by the three p.m. train, accompanied by the Secretary oi tbe Acclimatisation Society, to New Giaborne. These gentlemen were re ceived on the spot by Mr. TEos. Hamilton, and, after having ascertained that the little fish were in perfect order, started for the creek. They were met on the bank* of BiddeU's Creek by the prineinal residents of tbe district, Messrs. Robertson, Dr. Plnmmer, Mr. Biddell, and others. The water was found much cooler and higher than had been expected, and Mr. Buck land declared himself perfectly satisfied with the selection made for his trout. The fry were deposited in the creek, and were soon Bwimming away in all directions in search of food in then sew home. On Saturday, 4ue 16th, the other half of the trout were deposited in tbe Yas Vean Beservoir, tonder the immediate super vision of Dr. Thomas Black, the President of tile Society, and the Secretary, with equal success. We may, therefore, look forward to a good day's eport in the creeks of Victoria, at some future and not very distant time. —Argtu. A Stbteikg TEsrmoKUi.— 'A subscrip tion for a novel purpose,' say* the BaUarat Star, 'was raised at the Corneron Saturday. The object was to present a pane of ben sove reigns to t stableman, and the testimonial was to be given to mark the appreciation the donors held of hi* conduct in giving his master a. severe beating. Gossips say that tbe master, who is one of our wealthy mining magnates, bad some words with his groom, and, feeling insulted, used a stick he held in his hand by striking the man. This was not quietly submitted to, and the youth ' went in,' took the stick away, broke it, and then used his fists with such dex terity that he quickly bad hu master beaten. Several bruises and a pair of black eyes were given in fxrhange for the rash and unlucky blow with the stick, and the master had a bad night, although hi* Bufferings were alleviated by tbe family surgeon, who was called in. The groom hat been paid off and there the matter ends, for he does not wish to proceed against uu maoer lor ansanit, ana the assailant does not see his way clear to mend mattes by going to law.' A Ghost Stoet.— Ghostly visitations are of «uch rare occurrence in Victoria that we may be excused for giving the following from a local paper, as a notable spiritual incident of the cur rent time at Talbot One could almost regret that toe writer of the paragraph should have struck so determinedly at the interest attaching to a real 'haunted bouse.' 'Practical jok ing,' he says, 'iaat all times reprehensible, but that the vagaries of eotne mischievous and ?illy persona should excite fears of supernatural agencies in this, the nineteenth century, almost suprasses belief. We are, however, most credibly informed that such fears are ex perienced by some of the residents in tbe vi Commercial-road, and to whose wife a fatal accident happened on Christmas Day. Since the occurrence, although tbe house has been cleaned and the furniture placed in order by one of the neighbours, it has remained unin habited : and great alarm and surprise have been manifested at the mysterious disturbance of the tumiEnre during the night time. How ever carefully tbe furniture may be placed in proper position during the day, tables, chain, tc, are found the next morning upside down or piled upas one another, and a report that the bouse is 'haunted* actually prevail*. That any one should take toe amount of trouble ench nocturnal freaks must involve without being detected i* extaorduary in the extreme; but it seem* still. more wonderful that credulity ahould reach the pitch it has in connection with the matter, as to believe that other than man. ? d««hju»dlM»fnil^oftieduturbiacc«,' t^-i: '?-'_ :?:?-? :i :=:=:- .'.
