The officer takes up his abode in one of the rooms at night, and recently some visitors who had goiie up afte^dark to the scene of the murders hearing him moving about in the villa, lied in terror, crying out that the ghosts of the woman and children who liad been murdered were- in possession of the place. Some consterna tion was caused in the village by the report, wliich is stall believed by many of the more superstitious inhabitants. London, March 26, 5.55 p.m. Dakiel's agency have received a cable to the effect that Williams has confessed to the commission of two of the White cliapel murders hitherto attributed to "Jack the Ripper."

London, March 27, 7.30 a.m. Conflicting opinions are expressed with regard to the alleged confession by Wil liams that he is identical with "Jack the Bipper." The detectives of Scotland Yard do not believe the story, but they admit that it may possibly be true, as his movements in 1888, when six of the Whitechapel murders were committed, are unknown, and the places of bis residence when the other murders .were committed are -con sistent with the theory of bis guilt. Great excitement has been caused by the report at Tbtinlilll, as it is remem bered that Deeming frequently discussed the doings of " the Bipper," in whom ho evinced much interest, fie was known also to possess knives such as would be capable of inflicting injuries similar to those sustained by the Whitechapel vic tims. The head of die Criminal Investigation Department thinks that Williainsjs trying to secure a remand to England so as to lengthen bis life by a few months.
