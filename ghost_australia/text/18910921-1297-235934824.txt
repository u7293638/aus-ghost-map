THE CHILIAN WAR- SHIPOWNERS CLAIMING COMPENSATION. It is stated that tho owners of the istrathearn, Of Liverpool, and otiier British vessels which wero present off Pisagua during the taking of that town by the Congre.ssionalists, intend claiming compensa tion from tlio Chilian Government for harboring refugees. During January, February and March the British vessels wore constantly retorted to by refugees of both the contending parties. It Is esti mated that the Strathearn, which recently arrived at Antwerp, afforded accommodation lo about 1000, and a considerable expense was incurred thereby. Many of the ships also sustained damage. Thu Hidston-hiU, of Swansea, was penetrated by a shell from President Buluiuccdu's artillery which entered the port siJe just nbovo tliu watcr-linu ami burst between decks. One family of refugees was on bburd the Strathearn for six weeks, bringing with them not only their furniture, but pigs, goats and fowls. The claim for compensation will probably bo resisted on the ground that previous to tlje com mencement of the action the English captains were given notice by the admiral of the Chilian licet to take their vessels outside the range of lire.
