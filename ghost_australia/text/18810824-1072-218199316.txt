LONGFORD. (From a Correspondent.) Our football team has been again vic- torious, having defeated the Perthites on Saturday. The juveniles also scored a win against No. 2 Grammar-school team. Some cowardly rullians have, I hear, been acting Ghost in the vicinity of the Church Burial Ground, but as they are only visible to females, there is not much chance of their being caught. Immersion is the all absorbing topic of conversation. I think Mr McCullough would have been wiser had he not rushed into print. Great preparations am being made for the ball to-morrow evening, all the hotels being full. Vaccination here is going on briskly, the streets on the days appointed being quite lively, which I can assure you is a novelty for Longford.

George wrote back that ''in the bright lexicon of youth — ' Worcester's Unabridged' — there's no such word as 'fale.' "
