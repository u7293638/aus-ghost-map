Codrlnirtun. FItOlI OUK COUHESPONDEKT. FiBG.-Last week Mr. Baillie's saw mill had a narrow escupe of being burnb to the ground.~About. il o'clock in the morning tho hands on board a pass- ing steamer noticed smoko issuing from tho build- ing, and gave tho alarm by blowing tho whistle. AU the mill hands were quickly summoned, and after some smart work succeeded in mastering the devouring clement, but not before tho saw-bench was badly damaged and some of tho belting destroyed. Fortunately there was little or no wind blowing, and consequently the task of quenching the liro was comparatively easy. If the fire had started in the other end of the building, there would have been little chance of saving it, as .there is a deal of dry inflammable timber stowed away there. How the fire started is a mystery', as there is no fires near that ond of tho building, and no possibility of sparks from the fur- nace reaching tho spot. The fire ocourred at n very inopportune time, as a certain consignment of timber was to bo shipped for Sydney a few days after, but owing to tho damage done to tho bench, it was impossible to carry out tho arrangement, and as Mr. Baillie himself was in tho metropolis awaiting this particular shipment, ho was sub- jected to much inconvenience by tho delay. OUB SCHOOL.-Our teacher, Mr. M. Spalding, has fairly got into harness, and ns the attendance is good, will no doubt in a short time produce good results. There are over thirty children on thc loll, with a few more to como in yet. ' FAHMEBS' UNION.-This society, at Tatham, hold a meeting lost week, so I was in error in saying it had " given up tho ghost." THE BLIGHT.- This evil has not abated in thc least, and some patches of maize aro completely destroyed by it. One authority hero states that lime sprinkled at the stalks will care it, but ho might as well tell us to drain the sea. Fanoy sprinkling lime Over forty acres 1 Trnly the euro is as bad as the disease.
