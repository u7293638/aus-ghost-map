A WHITE SLAVE. BY PLEESMAN X. SARGENT D he ast me lately Wy the Mews was silent now, And hobservd as he had notist Of a shaddo hon my brow. Which that ere remark is troothful, Likewhys eye am gettin bald; And by serting jewnyor members, A old fogy eye am cauld. Wen I rit them former poems In a toonful pleasin gingle, Eye was yung and noo to Melbourne, Also eye was gay and single. Now hive got a whife and horfspring, Won and sometimes too a year, And this blessed Berry tarriff Makes their togs unkommon deer. So mi heldest gurl Eliza, Which they say is jest like me, She gose out too hern a trifle In a sewing fac-to-ree. But it greeves my art to see err, Wurkin konstant, wurkin late, Leevin ome at herly mornin, Kummin bak at arf-past ate. Like a ghost in face and feechur, Sad of art and dull ov eye, Daily growin thin and thinner, Smiling only wen I sigh. She is wun of nearly forty Beein slowly ground to death; And that bit of hectick kuller, And that katchin in err breath, Tell a tail of eated rooms, and Over work by nite and day; Wareby that pore girl is sloly Fadin like a flour awhey. Yet a woman's err slave-driver And tho no bad thorts eye arbour, There are thymes at which I feel that Eye cood strangle Missus -------. She's a swell and I'm a bobby, Eye a sinner, she a saint; So it wood bee unbekomming If err portrate eye shood paint. But ide rather kutt both ands off, Than a white slave-driver bee,â€” And ware out the weakly lives of Girls a-workin under mee. For too evry shillin maid so, There must kling the taint of blood, And I think my rekollexuns On my victims still wood brood. Munny wrung from such slave labour Kannot spend well, I suspex; And eye ope as ow there's many Thinks the same as Pleesman X.
