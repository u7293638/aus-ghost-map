It waon't because they waor in a back ethbreet. for be wasn't proud. The dclakens a bit of coneate was In poor Paddy, bathe had the name of a haps of money, an' vobedy ever heard the jingle of it but him So It was a sort of coriosity to And rot how bhe was livin', but, 'cote enough, he kep' all to himself, like a hermit of the moontains, Whin he was in his tcp bask room. Now and thin ye'd ad him with an odd abillin', but, like a motherless calf, it was always alone. Paddy seemed to baer no relations, or, if e haad, he didn't encourage their soqualatanaes. But there's one thing certain -Paddy was full op of money, wherever on artb he managed to serape it up. Some say that be dShamin' onea night he fooad out where there was a orock of goold bid in the Dublin mountains-that he dog it up in the dark and carried it home in a bueket covered with water-creases. 'Yer haeklt"a very heary,' sih a polls to him one mont.' 'What have ye got in it ' 'Nothin',' sir Paddy. 'Jest let me look at nothin',' si the polio.

'm not gain' o steop In the force-I don'tlike it, and I hate to be an informer, so we'll divide the money an' say nothin'. Paddy acoldn't help it, so they squared it on the ditch. But that's only a bit of the uessip that got oat about him-just because his neighbours were jealouv, Two or three times he was on the pop of lalo' married, buhot somehow he tound out it wes the money the girls wor dhrivin' at, an' he .dhrew oct aof the job cn a sodden. ' He ebackmated thim,' as Lannigan the wax arse be say. Well, tho' he grew to he spurty steleowld bachelor, all his money, wherever he kept it, onuldn't bould the breath in ble body.
