Mil. F. J. C. WILD ASH, AND HIS DETRACTOR. i ( To the Editor of tht Warwick Aram.} SIB,-Ton gave a kind of currency to a rumour that Mr. Wildash bad subscribed Â£100 towards defraying the expense! of defeating Mr. Macalietor's election, wbich Mr. Wildaah baa contradicted in tba fol lowing manner " Having taken no action whatever in the forthcoming election for the Eastern Downs, I trust that the electors will re gard such an accusation as a miserable attempt to deceive tbem, as well as to fklsify my own position.-Tours truly. " F. J. C. WILD as ii." Now, sir, [ want you to tell me bow can the above slipshod denial be neon- j oiled with tbe fact, that the chaste War wick benefactor did, on Thursday night last, spurn the enjoyments of bis downy pillow, and at the nnballowed hour of two o'clock in the morning, proceed along tbe Condamine, regardless of tbe ghosts of dead fish, or the piscatory odour which pervaded the atmosphere, leading a broken down racehorse to accommodate a candi date on a canvassing tour. I am, sir. Your obedient servant, ANGELINA. [Our fair correspondent must be tnisin tormed, the story is evidently the inven tion of some enemy anxious to " falsify the position" of that excellent man, for Ur. Wildash's actions though seldom ' equivocal are often characterised aa being like the actions of a certain sable Portu guese potentate-almost "too good." We refuse to credit this slander unless indeed on tbe principle of "doing good by stealth" or of not letting your left hand know about tbe charily wbich your right hand dispenses. Mr. Wildaah may possibly like to do good in the dark, and if so, may have felt a secret and placid kind of gratification while sauntering into town on that dark night, in thinking that his left band was so profoundly ignorant of the halter which ne beld in his right hand. This of coarse would alter our view of tbe story considerably.-ED.]
