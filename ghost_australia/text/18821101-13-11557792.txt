THE CUP DAY. The great annual sporting festival, the national rejoicing in which visitors from the most distant Victorian inland town and the furthest point of the remotest Australian colony take part, was celebrated yesterday at Flemington The sport was excellent, and the public at tendance was larger than ever, number- ing nearly 100,000, but as a spectacle the Cup Day of 1882 will not be remembered among happy anniversaries of the event With the great race viewed through the dripping eaves of an umbrella, while a cold wind drove the rain in the faces of the spectators with magnificent toilets wet and sodden, and their wearers compelled to seek the shelter of the stand, instead of adding beauty to the lawn the scene was robbed of the peculiar attractiveness which his long made the Cup Day famous For tunately, however, the weather held up sufficiently well in the morning to justify the presence of the vast concourse of people who had long been looking forward to the pleasure of this meeting Certainly no exception could be taken to the number or quality of the competitors The programme of sports provided, which is sufficiently good to attract the best horses from the neighbouring colonies was in every way worthy of the reputation so long maintained by the ARC, and the visitors must have been well satisfied with the quality of the entertainment All that was wanting to make the day one of unalloyed enjoyment was a bright sun Though that was lacking, and though the course at no time appeared in its best holiday garb, the spectacle was nevertheless a striking one To those who can remember the first Melbourne Cup race of 21 years ago, the scene of yeaterday, dull as it was compared with recent celebrations, must have seemed like one of enchantment The beautify ing of the ground and the enormous increase in the public attendance afford the most gratifying proof that we are a progressive community The important day, fraught with momentous issues to so many, broke warm but cloudy There was room for unpleasant anticipations, but the weather was so fair that it did not in the least check the great stream of pleasure seekers which began to flow from the city at 11 o'clock Trams were fired oil from the Spencer street railway station like minute guns, and there were drags, carriages, and cabs enough to give great animation to the road. The whole town appeared to been made, for open windows were crowded with spectators, the people who lined the streets often stood still to see the vehicles pass, with their gaily costumed occupants, and the post office steps looked like a circus gallery By 2 o'clock the unwonted bustle of the streets had died away, and an hour later the city was a haunted silence. All the world was at Flemington A little before 12 o'clock the wind began to use an ominous sign The sky became more During, dark heavy clouds massed together, and an hour later a light shower of rain fell, obliging those on the course to seek shelter Light showers fell intermittently until half-past 3 o'clock, when a heavy downpour set in, and lasted until half an hour after the Cup race had been run The various triumphs of the milliner's art, on which so much care had been bestowed in expectation of fine weather, had no opportunity, except for a brief half hour, of unfolding their beauties The lawn lay like a charm- ing expanse of green , its soft four tanks played, and its beds of flowers gave colour to the landscape, but the crowning attraction the gay procession of forms of rare beauty clad in rich hues which feed the eye and delight the senses, was niiEting the flood of exquisite tints which has so often glistened in the sun was not to be seen Chilled by the westerly wind and drenching spray, the enchantments of colour had faded out of sight The ladies took refuge in the grand stand, which presented an animated picture in spite of the sombreness of the surroundings It was like a vast opera be-. crowded to overflowing with the best that the land has to show of bright and fair It is true that the marvels of the modiiU'b art here massed together did not appear to the advantage recorded on other occasions There was less of the dancing kaleidoscopic changes, of the vary- ing sheen of silks and satins, and of the changing splendour of tints which echo the flying banners of the Australian summer sky and the grass and flowers that clothe the hold The buzz of mirth- ful conversation which went up was sub clued rather than like the gush of glad- some sound from the " cicadas In their summer bliss " With a radiant sunlight, the stand is like the famous banyan of India, its expanding cloud of foliage supported by a fantastic maze of ion ii roots, while gorgeously plumaged birds hang among the boughs, gom like lizards bask on the limbs, and a crimson flutter of butterflies gives life to it Yesterday there was the hum of innumerable bees, but there was no golden splendour to delight the eye The hill was filled to its utmost verge The additions and improvements which have been made to this part of the reserve were greatly appreciated while the fine weather lasted The recreation ground with its summer house and plantations affords a very agreeable retreat from the turmoil of the hill itself, and it was a favourite place of resort between the races The flat was largely attended, many visitors landing by steamer at the wharf on the river's bank The time honoured amusements for the entertainment of the populace were generally in dulged in before the rain began to fall, and the scene here in the earlier part of the day was one of high enjoyment. The carnage paddock was crowded The picnic tables, being under cover, were in great request The great business of the meeting was of course done in the sad ding paddock. Hero, and on the ter- race in front of the stand, old friends met who had not seen each other for a year The customary greeting was heard on all hands, and the day was jovially celebrated in spite of the rain A great babel of sounds from the book makers drew attention to the saddling paddock A brief visit to this locality suffices to show that what was originally an amusement has become a business and n Bcienco Here are to be found the cof/iioaccuft who can lay a finger on the winning horse, and who in mysterious terms offer to lay against the favourite, of the field, bar one. As to the inner mysteries of this period also, the mind of the general public in a tabular i ass But their position is by no means to be despised, for the old adage about " ignorance and bliss " 18 perhaps seldom oftener verified than on a racecourse, and it frequently happens, as far as " horsey" Bapicnco Is concerned, that it is indeed folly to be wise, while the uninitiated, placing themselves unreservedly in the hands of the Fates, were more fortunate Little, shrewd looking man, sometimes with coloured Bills: peeping through their overcoats, gild o noiselessly about the paddock in close attendance upon the horses, preserving the most mysterious reticence upon points on which they are often well qualified to speak, and it is left a matter of the vaguest uncertainty which animal is going to win when the time for starting has arrived. Meanwhile, the bookmakers industriously follow the advice, " always make your hay while the sun shines," and a fine harvest they generally succeed in reaping As the time draws near when the great event of the day is to be decided, that part of the reserves the centre of attraction It is all animation and bustle An obvious feeling of excited expectation quivers through the vast throng, and all thoughts are turned to the horses, on whose pluck and muscle so much depends The favourites are closely scrutinised as their last toilets are made These animals, trained to the Hat pound, are a noble spectacle as they stand in their shining coats of glossy satin, while the veins stand out on their necks like the markings of a vine leaf bandages are removed from legs clean as a fawn's, shoes are taken off, mouths are moistened with a little water, the light saddles are admired, the beautiful creatures have received the last marks of the trainers' solicitude, and these " kings of the kings of the stall ' file past in front of the stand to test the merit of all that has been done for them Full of impatient ardour, proudly arching their necks to the curb, their delicate lines, uno heads, long necks, and london Banks appear to the best advantage The easy stride of the thoroughbred, the sw mging canter, and the play of powerful limbs, are all admiringly remarked The jockeys, in their colours and trim boots, gently urge the mettlesome steeds into trial paces, while thousands of anxious eyes are fixed upon them At this time a heavy rain squall came on Every point which seemed to promise shelter and also a view of the race was rushed There was a suffocating block in the stand The corridor and staircases were all crowded, and the two presa boxes not having separate staircases, they were speedily appropriated, those for whose accommodation they were intended having to take their notes of the race as they best could, exposed to the rain in various parts of the ground Numbers of people crouched in the ice of the stone wall at the back of the carriage paddock , the sheds in the carriage paddock were all full , every available space that offered protection from the rain was occupied, and numbers were still left to the pelting of the storm Many handsome dresses were irretrievably ruined The hill presented a curious spectacle It was a convex mound of glistening umbrellas the people had come out to see the race, and it was evident that they would see it under any circumstances in the stand itself umbrellas were hoisted , a dense line of spectators occupied the ground in front under umbrellas , men with umbrellas mounted the carriages and drags, and the people on the flat crowded to the fence which divided them from the straight running, some with and some without umbrellas Gradually the horses gather together on the starting place at the far end of the straight running The race is to be run over a slippery ground in driving rain. Presently the wavy line takes form There are some signs of fractiousneBS, a false alarm, a little commotion, and the flag falls to the start the ball in the stewards' box announces the fact with one stroke of its iron tongue, and the cry They're all runs from end to end of the ground All eyes are turned to the line of horses advancing with the even front of a cavalry charge Each spectator is endeavouring to ascertain which of the competitors will first emerge and appear to have the advantage Soon the dark line, BUT mounted by its parti- coloured funge, has broken The "hold" is scattered over the course in rides tinguishable confusion Then it is clear Unit Stockwell has a strong lead There is the thunder of hoofs, an arrow flight, a rainbow flash, and the horses in a confused welter have shot past the stand, and in a crow did rush are dashing on to the river All the fines of the spectators are instantly turned from left to right to follow the course of the lace It is an extraordinary sight, that vast simultaneous movement The figures are blended and the features are blurred, but the gaze of all is clearly lived on one moving point During a brief period of silent suspense the horses have turned at the river, and crashed across the wide stretch to the abattoirs Now is the time at which glasses are eagerly used It is generally the turning point of the race But Stockwell is still to the fore. It is difficult to distinguish at the distance in the blinding rain the positions of the other horses As the competitors enter the straight the excitement reaches fever point the horses are nearing the post Amid cries of "Stockwell wins' " Assjnan ' Assyrian "Gu days is going up ' ' Tile undulating sea of umbrellas sways, the stand rocks and" surges, the pulse of the throbbing multi tide is beating in every vein, the jockey right firms are raining blows, the horse's' hoofs leave a shower of mud in their track, the great heaving human tide on the lull emits a sound like the cataract a divvy booming, the crowds on the flat are agitated by a tempest of feeling, there is a roar from the ring, and Assyrian- has won, with Stockwell second, and Gudarz third The excited populace roll on in the wake of the horses to the winning post like a tidal wave, and when the numbers go up the winners name is shouted by a chorus of voices The horses come to scale dappled with foam and mud bespattered the jockeys are indistinguishable, and look with their blackened faces like a band of negro minstrels The rain was still falling here ily, and the great event of the day being over, there was a tremendous rush for the train to get out of the wet The crash at the gates was something quite unusual The first train to leave after the Cup race only took half those who were clamoring for places, but the succeeding drama followed so rapidly that the crowd on the platform soon dwindled away. An hour later and the rain had ceased, so that those who remained for the last races were enabled to reach their homes in comfort The evening proved beautifully fine, so that the Cup must be considered to have been run under exceptionally unlucky circumstances. The day's forecast given in 27ic Argus weather chart was singularly accurate It was "This weather and northerly winds, followed by westerly winds and unsettled showery in other ' THE FORENOON IN MELBOURNE The hour V which business is usually commenced arrived, but there was no business for any one except for those who totalled luxuries, stimulants, or medicines The ware- houses and stores, therefore, remained closed, and the only shopkeepers who took their shutters down were the tobacconists, and fruiterers, and the chemists, and the hotel keepers as a matter of course also kept open doors It was a cloudy morning with a north wind blowing, indications of a dusty sultry day The people turned out in summer garb and thronged beetroots in countlesanumbors, but the wiser of them having glanced at the barometer or observed Borne signs of a change of weather, provided themselves with cloaks and overcoats as a protection in case of rain. The great majority, however, were too eager for the day's sport to think of anything disagreeable, and set out for the course with light hearts and as few impedi- merits as possible Between 10 and 11 o'clock Bourke street became the main channel of a contiunousstreamof human beings The many smaller streams from the eastern and north-eastern suburbs, united in Spring street, and flowed westwards to the Spencer street railway station, their volume increasing at every intersecting street. Large numbers cashed theomnibiiBeeattho omnibus office in Bourke street, and so started at once by road for Flemington, and the cabmen had their own share of the public patronage And yet the people, apparently undiminished in numbers, kept hurrying on westward on foot to Spencer Street, By half-past 11 o'clock the street traffic had reached its maximum, and the scene at the General Post office was very animated Here the great majority of the public and private vehicles converged, and the onward progress of the burr. ing pedestrians was impeded by thousands of spectators who lined the footpaths. The wonder was that accidents did not happen and that confusion did not take place This would undoubtedly have been the case had not Sub inspector Pewtress and a strong body of police been there to keep order. The crowds of spectators, and cape all those persons who were perched on the pedestals of the Post office columns, or comfortably seated on the steps, seemed to derive as much enjoyment from what they saw as those on whom they looked expected to obtain on reaching Flemington They were representative of the non racing portion of the community They could, however, understand the meaning of the pleasure giving excitement and hope which was depicted in the thousands of faces passing before them, they could obtain interesting glimpses of the richly dressed fair ones who occupied the carriages and drags, and they could criticise or admire the equipages and their steeds, or the skill of the various gentlemen who handled the ribbons and whip They could also gather from the easter talk and confident declarations of the hurrying throng, that a horse called "Sweet Milliara was going to win untold wealth for thousands of his admirers, and that other quadrupeds named "Mistaken and "Little Jack, were to do the same for others, and that certain persons termed "book settlers, were to be compelled at last to disgorge the money of the long suffering public. This of course was interesting, but all that the onlookers could do was to hope that everything would end for the best Soon after 11 o'clock, however, an ominous change took place in the weather The wind fell away for a short time, and then set in from the south west in strong gusts, which raised the dust and the sky becoming obscured, threatened rain, a promise which was fulfilled during the afternoon THE ROLL) The road, as one of the most popular of the three modes of access to the course is always a feature in the Cup meeting, and as the weather during the early part of the day was as favourable as could be desired the traffic was quite as heavy as at previous meet- ings In the vicinity of the course, where all the roads meet and concentrate their being Streams in one broad thoroughfare, a striking scene of animation and variety was presented The rattle and realised with some of them there was considerably more cattle than rush of every variety of vehicle that has ever sprung into shape as the fruit of mechanical ingenuity, created an incessant din and was terribly Buggies tive of collisions As a rule there are, however, few mishaps on the way to the coarse It is on the return journey when people are excited with success and champagne that disasters more frequently happen the morning mash is a thoroughly cosmopolitan gathering, the most exclusive of cleanse crazy driving side by side with the " collected devilry of the nation An unusually large number of handsome drags were out, the best turn out in this way being Mr W J Clarke a well bred team and neatly appointed drag, though it need hardly be mentioned that Mr Clarke himself was not present but is now voyaging across the ocean in the delayed Peshawur Mr R Power a team was driven by Mr C HT Hart, of Adelaide, while Mr P Agnew occupied the box seat on Dr Balls Headley s drag, headed by four very neat says Mr George Teague had also a good team on the road, while Mr M'Culloch a four were neatly handled Two of Garton a drags, and four greys driven by Mr J Gar diner, M L A , were also noticeable Cabs were simply legion, and it seemed as though every vehicle of the kind that had ever plied for hire within a radius of 10 miles of the metropolis had deserted its ordinary route to reap a harvest in this direction Most of them were inscribed with the legend, " Racecourse, in very large letters, and a few with the word "Gates in very small letters, the attention of passengers being only directed to the latter word when they had been deposited a half mile distant from their destination, and were objecting very strongly to what they termed a swindle Some very original notions in orthography were displayed on the sides of many of the cabs, the word " course proving especially troublesome to the proprietors If variety really possesses some thing to charm under any circumstances then the various methods adopted for Spell ing the one simple word were charming in the highest degree Even in the cabs them selves there was as much variety as could reasonably be looked for, since on the road might be noticed a solitary specimen of the Banque Albert cab and one veritable Irish jaunting car The most attractive feature of the road was decided. the large number of handsome family carriage, drawn generally by well matched pairs of horses in man; instances showing almost as much breeding as the more valuable animals stripped later on to compete for the V R C prizes THE majority of these carriages had large hampers slung behind, showing that their owners were determined not to place reliance on the caterers alone for the creature comforts which form such valuable auxiliaries to the enjoyment of a race meeting Through the windows of the carriages a glimpse was obtainable of those mysterious mixtures of fair divinity and fancy milliner, which, unfortunately, were not fated to grace the lawn to any extent on this particular occasion homes and vane are always conspicuous in the road procession to the Melbourne Cup, and many of the city brewing firms turned out four in hands composed of the substantial, well fed Clydeadales that are to be seen any day attached to their homes in the metropolitan thoroughfares The vane, which are early on the ground, usually convey a party of mixed aorta-a conglomeration of racegoers and picnic people, with a large hamper and appetites to match-everything on a liberal scale, in fact, save the compassion for the horse, which, strange to say, seems to take but a languid interest in Cup Day and its surroundings Occasional young couples may be seen occupying a trap, hired a week ago for the occasion, and carefully shepherded ever since as though there were a dozen deep conspiracies on foot to deprive them of their holiday, and half young Australia had determined to annex this particular turn out to convey their sweet herbs to the Cup Gun has triumphed, however, and he seems to know and to believe, moreover, that pretty well everyone else out for the day knows it also He holds up his steed with two hands, and would have another if he had it to spare, as though the animal was a lineal descendant of Wild Dayrell instead of an asthmatic livery stable slave, bred and fed anyhow ' Gentlemen of the ring, with unpleasant financial faces looking more financial than over after the blight which fell upon their prospects daring Saturdays running drive high-stepping, fast moving horses in buggies that are something to be envied in the way of vehicles Hansom cabs are almost as plentiful The hansom cab method of locomotion is extremely popular with young Australia, who, provided with the customary paraphernalia of race glasses, betting books, last night's odds, and this morning's scratchings, lazily lounge inside, The majority of them have no opinion of their own concerning the great race, but intend to follow the advice of others, which advice generally-like all advice gratis-is worth avoiding, However, the orthodox little bird has whispered in their car, and they have yet to discover that the orthodox little bird is the essence of an ornithological fraud Bill and Emily ore on the road in strength. The; ore gregarious, and not hypercritical, as they crowd into furniture vans lorries spring drays or everything and anything resembling a vehicle with the remotest apology for a horse in front of it and room to hang on anyhow inside The Melbourne Omm bus Company had 80 vehicles running during the forenoon, the number being after wards increased to 100 As soon as the race for the Cup was finished 40 of their vehicles were ready to start on the return journey and in less than 20 minutes after the horses had passed the post each of these had obtained its load and started for Melbourne When the block occurred at the railway gates the rush of people anxious to travel by the omnibuses was so great that 100 vehicles could have been loaded without difficulty Altofcether Borne 4,000 passengers were carried in this way during the day It was noticeable that on the return journey very few mishaps occurred and when the crush had passed not a single damaged vehicle was to be seen along the line of route The greater portion of the road was thoroughly watered in the morning in order to keep down the dust and it was intended to adopt the same course just prior to the Cup race had not the ram rendered such a proceeding unnecessary THE RAIL The convenient and rapid mode which the railway affords for getting to the course was largely availed of yesterday and from half vast 10 till half-past 1 o'clock there was an air ceasing stream of people towards the Spencer street railway station The system of allowing tickets to be purchased at the Flinders street station, at the post office and at the Exchange relieved the rush upon the booking windows at Spencer street to a very considerable extent and the increased number which were opened allowed in tending passengers to secure their tickets without having as on some former occasion to almost fight their way through to the booking windows The general arrangements at the station were also admirable Gentlemen were admitted by two doors while ladies alone and accompanied 1 by gentlemen were admitted to the platform by other doors There was therefore no an early TUBI ing or crowding and as one train followed another in very rapid succession those persons who were unable to obtain seats in one quietly waited for the next and for the Blight patience which they display in reaped the benefit of being con v eyed to the course with comfort The second class passengers were admitted to the trams by doors facing Little Collins street and those who journeyed to 1 Footscray and then walked to the course entered the platform by the Williamstown entrance fee strain upon the traffic arrangements was very great but profiting by past experience and exercising, forethought the general traffic manager at dine subordinate officers managed to meet the demand and to give every satisfaction to the thousands who patronised the railway The rain which set in in the afternoon caused a stampede to the train immediately after the race for the Cup was over the great rush came from the hill and as the people been edged the first class as well as the second class entrances those going to the station from the grand stand had considerable trouble in getting up to and through the station gates The second class passengers who had reached the first class entrance were refused admis- son and as they retraced their steps they had to force their way through the crowd hurrying to the station from the grand stand Rain was falling the whole time and as the roads day was worked up into a quagmire the situation of those struggling in the surging mass outside of the gates was anything but a desirable one This early departure for town greatly relieved the subsequent pressure at the railway gates A good deal of crowding necessarily took place at the railway entrance after the last race but once inside the gates the platforms were soon emptied the arrangements for con v ey ii g the people back to Melbourne being as come here as at St enter street earlier in the day The actual number of single tickets issued from Melbourne to the course was "0 0 4 or about 4 900 more than last year In addition to these J 173 tickets were sold to persons going to Footscray and then walking to the course The rain in the afternoon caused a number of persons to return by rail who had either walked to the course in the morning or gone out by omnibus or cab and the single tickets issued for Melbourne at the booking offices near the course was 2 490 The railway traffic yesterday was larger than on any preceding Cup Day not excepting the Exhibition year when there were so many thousands of visitors in Melbourne Yesterday s receipts at the railway department to tickets were ii j more than on the Cup Day of 1884 About 60 trains each composed of an engine 12 carriages and two guards vans were despatched from Spencer street to the course beside a number of extra trains put on the Williamstown line The whole of tho train arrangements were worked without a hitch and reflect great credit upon the officers in charge Mr Reade had the control of the traffic direct from Spencer street to the course Mr rates of the trains to Footscray and Mr Moule of the return traffic from the course to Melbourne TUT LAWN AND THE DRESSES A more disastrous day for the display of the milliner a part it would be difficult to pick out during the course of the year Although the weather prophet of the Observatory sent forth his forecast of a change of wind and unsettled showery weather there were few of the fair ex v he could find it in their hearts to believe him Nevertheless he was right and those who refused to listen to his words of warning bitterly repented it before the day was over The lawn up to 9 o'clock promised a grand display of toilets as by that time many hundreds of ladies had arrived and the show of costumes bade fair to eclipse all former Cup Day efforts But immediately after the first race a change came over the scene and the rain beginning to fall the lawn was speedily cleared The stand and corridors were soon packed and hundreds of ladies had to remain in the driving rain with only parasols as shelter the exposure soon told its tale and numbers of beautiful dresses were quickly ruined In many cases the colours ran into each other and the rain poured down from sunshades on to lovely bonnets and dresses in streams of variegated dye Directly the Cup was over a rush was made for the station and those drCBH'B that were not quite spoilt had the of rushing touch put to them in the jostle on the journey from the stand to the tram It was a pitiable sight to see light and rich dresses dragged round the bottom and splashed with mud and the effect of the tramping through the dirt by those who unfortunately overshoes to match their costumes can be more easily imagined than described A few defied appearances and tucked their elaborate dresses up round their wants in a manner that would have drawn tears from their dressmakers others let them draggle in the dirt and seemed utterly indifferent to the result Nearly every woman in the stand gambled in the harmless form of half sovereign Sweeps and those who were lucky enough to win took the unfortunate weather more cheerfully At present the stand IS utterly unequal to afford shelter to more than half the visitors on the course and the promised alterations and addi- tions of Mr Byron Moore will not come a day too early It is his intention to erect a stand exclusively for the use of ladies just below the present one in the carriage paddock, and at the rear of the old one he purposes to erect two very large retiring rooms for ladies, where tea, coffee ices, and other light refreshments will be served during the day If such conveniences had been on the Flemington coarse yesterday, many a bitter regret would have been saved In the early part of the morning those ladies who had taken time by the forelock had at least a couple of hours promenade, and the sweetness and light that tripped so daintly over the beautiful green sward brought to mind the words of the social poet " Glad lady mine, that glittered In shimmer of BUrmah athwart the lawn " But when the rain began to fall the conclusion of the verse was even more forcibly illustrated ' Like a human fly done thou (butter by, Oh whence and oh whither art come and gone Speaking of the toilets generally, pompadour reigned once again supreme, both in rich satins and cotton sations, but invariably worked up with a plain material, Nearly every colour of the rainbow was worn, and no hue predominated Marked good taste characterised nearly all the dresses that were seen, and there was little that was vulgar or ouré Hats of nearly every description were worn, mostly by young girls Married ladies gave the preference chiefly to small close bonnets Now and then a pretty face would peep out of a large coal scuttle or a pretty Kate Nickleby poke The hats ' most in favour were the Manilla, flop, and the mushroom, one of these latter being at least 3ft 6in in circumference It was trimmed with muslin and smothered with black and red cherries Flowers

The innovation first appeared in Adelaide a month or two ago and was after wards brought on to Melbourne being sue I cheerfully tried at the late Caulfield meeting. The practice of taking deposits in full from backers at the time of making the bet and settling with winners immediately after each race is one which does not commend its If to colonial bookmakers of good standing They do not consider it dignified It reminds them too much of the petty operations of the hill men who used to stand on logs with labels on their hats and bawl the odds out for the benefit of persons who could not afford to put more than a few shillings on any horse As now practised in the recognised. betting arena the cash system transcends the trivial speculations of the brother hood on the hill, past or present It suits the wants of a class The men who bet to win hundreds or thousands in single wagers will always prefer to transact their business where they can do so with the least trouble namely, with bookmakers of known standing in the ring who jot down a bet in an instant deferring all payments until settling day In order to retain a hold upon the custom of the smaller wagerors some of the leading bookmakers have been reluctantly compelled to follow the example of their new competitor Nearly 200 cash bets were made by one professional on the Cup race alone Shortly before 1 o'clock the anxious looking ring began to move towards the grand stand and lawn the leviathans being the first to go but several lingered by the clock tower anxious to pick up the last crumbs It was in the minutes preceding the start that a few sportsmen who were lucky enough to think of Assyrian took the odds of 100 to 6 about IUB winning the great event the victory of the outsider caused great joy amongst the bookmakers, and correspond- ing displeasure to backers Nearly all the great doubles that had been taken with Navi gate and they were both numerous and heavy-bad failed, and the ring had an im mence load taken off their shoulders Under these inspiriting circumstances the tossing, of hats did not satisfy them and a good many bets were jumped upon HIL HILL The Hill one of the most popular resorts on Cup days is always patronised by thousands of ardent devotees of the noble sport It is a sort of common ground upon which all classes are able to meet on an equal footing Without being so aristocratic a reserve as the grand stand, it is certainly considerably above the flat both in situation and in social respects and it is undeniable that from its crest the races can be more satisfactorily watched than they can be from any other point Its occupants consiBtforthe most part of people who have made up their minds to enjoy themselves whatever may happen A genial freedom characterises almost every individual one meets Many are evidently from the country In not a few cases whole families, numbering six or seven may be seen quietly seated on one of the logs conveniently scattered over the ground looking as happy as it is possible for mortals to look and congratulating each other with smiles that plainly indicate What a day were having There is not in g shadowy or ethereal about their pleasure It is solid and substantial fare such as will be looked back upon with feelings of delight in coming years There are plenty of representatives of middle class respectability to be seen Although their conversation is desperately 'horsey it is subject to join" interruptions and upon the whole the greatest (good humour is observable in every face Una is a truly representative gathering of the people who form the backbone of the colony, and it a somewhat conservative in character as it maintains several of the old institutions which have grown up with the development of horseracing as a national sport There are thimble riggers, monkey sweep men, and professors of ollie, well established games of chance there are the men who get up race Sweeps for a small commission, and who glory in jackets and caps of rainbow tints and there are a few whose features, and still more whose actions indicate that their presence is due to anything but a desire to earn an honest penny The improvements which the committee of the Y R C have made in this reserve were subjected to a good deal of admiring criticism, the fountains the prettily situated kiosk, and last, but not least, the Punch and Judy show attracting much attention from those whose interest was not confined to the rating During the forenoon one could hardly have asked to see a livelier or more pleasing picture than this reserve presented had the weather been such as to favour the full enjoyment of the occasion When the first few threatening drops of rain defended, and the appearance of the sky indicated a thoroughly wet afternoon umbrellas were hoisted with a startling rapidity, and in surprising numbers, and some few weatherwise ones, who had had the forethought to bring greatcoats and water proofs with them donned these garments and smiled complacently at the dripping and clinging silk coats which their over confiding companions were A rush was made for the friendly protection of the kiosk, but this rustic shelter was soon crowded to over flowing. It was occupied by a very mixed assemblage, one of the number being a blind old lady, who, upon a cracked violin, scraped out kilts and jigs to which one or two persons managed, but with some difficulty to dance The Punch and Judy show looked anything but gay for instead of taking cover under its canvas, the multitude, as a rule, Bought more substantial protection, and the clown, thinly clad and evidently very cold, tried in vain to draw them into his show by lugubrious at tempts at impromptu joking Returning to the brow of the eminence, similar effects were found to have been produced by the rain storm, Fathers and mothers, recently so happy, were concentrating themselves and their olive branches into small apace in effectually endeavouring to screen their little family circle under an umbrella, the droppings from which, despite all ingenious efforts to the contrary, always a appeared to be falling down the neck of some unfortunate member of the party, The Sweep mon, though but ill protected from the elements, continued to ply their loud calling with unabated vigour, for the hour was approaching when the great race of the day was to be run A temporary cessation of the ram brought numbers of people from the grand- stand reserve to the hill, whence they hoped to get a better view of the struggle, and 10 minutes before the start a densely packed throng bad as usual on these occasions, spread itself over the face of the incline overlooking the course Just then, however, a burst of wind and rain occurred which swept the ridge of fully a fourth of its occupants, who hastily Bought the lee side of the retaining wall leading to the grand stand Finally the race was started in pouring rain, and amidst great excitement Much indignation was caused by the obstruction offered to the view by large numbers of wide spreading umbrellas, those persons immediately behind them bawling out lustily for the offending articles to be closed, as they were not only deprived of seeing the race but were also being wet through by the drops falling from their points Judging by the quarrels which were thus created at least one half of the drenched crowd were unable to witness half of the great event They did not lose much, however All that could be seen of the race through the blinding rain was a blurred picture of a string of horses rushing in a dirty cloud round the course no colourS being discernible The finish of the contest was greeted with cries of ' Darebin winB ' ' Sting for over ' ' Stock well by love and when the numbers went up and it was known that the And man had conquered several disgusted individuals, finding themselves losses instead of winners, remarked, ' A blooms outsider, "Who'd a thought it A desperate rush was then made towards

expect tors commenced to arrive at a most uncoil seasonably early hour in the morning and continued to pour in upon the scene until the sudden chance in the weather put a stop to the excursion There could not then have been less than between 10 000 and 10,000 people scattered over the not the majority of these were pedestrians who arrived in detachments either from the direction of Kensington had or over the river from 1 Footscray At the cam mencement of the racing every available e post of vantage within hail of the stand was taken possession of not even excepting the venerable old gum tree nearly opposite the judge a box, which has been allowed to continue there unmolested for the last quarter of a century I very accessible fence and hurdle was more than fairly occupied and there was a

placed, the crowd was equally dense, and the fences were occupied and thickly lined from the lawn callings to near the five furlong starting, point In fact every nook and crannies was occupied as they had never been before either by the free spectators, the nondescript showmen, or a mixed vant ty of professional and amateur sweep promoters At times the spectators scattered a good deal over the course in groups, until the rain commenced in earnest, but on the sound of the saddling bell and the appearance of the horses they invariably returned to their former positions The chief occupation of the people on the flat was asleep making and nearly every other pastime was subordinated to that particular amusement it was a modest weakness No Sweep on the Hat exceeded a shilling and as the investment gave a treat to the sport, the public as a rule get a good deal of fun for the money Interest in the running of the horses for the pure enjoy- ment of the sport, however appeared to be quite a secondary consideration with the million This might probably be due to the fact that the majority of those on the Hit are unable to see the whole of a race A start or a finish is the most they can hope to distinguish, and the feet of the race in which the interest of the spectators usually worked up to a cul military, point of enthusiasm, 13 either totally lost to view or SO obscure and

course at the conclusion of every race It is really not so much due to cure Only as to anxiety Interest in the Cup race was seriously marred by the rain, which prevented it being watched with the attention usually bestowed on the event by the statute In fact the rain spoilt everything on the flat, including the equanimity of the million It dumped the ardour of those who for the love of the thing took an interest in the sport, and made those more tasty than their wont who were already angry because they had not achieved the success which they anticipated. But withal, the conduct of the people was joyous, unconstrained, and temperate, and no disturbances occurred of any more serious consequence than the disputed tenancy of a rail The view obtained from the flat of the running in the Cap was very meagre After a deep pause, which spoke more plainly than language of the feeling of the public in the matter, the shout went along the anxious line of faces, "They're off, and a general movement took place among the crowd to get out into the middle of the flat to see what could be seen of the horses It was a profitless change Nothing could be seen beyond the fluttering of 25 indistinct colours over the heads of the people in front with a prominent scarlet jacket leading the field by several lengths The prospect was not much improved at the horses shot past the stand, but at the river turn the positions were more easily seen, and Stockwell was everywhere spoken of as a certain winner He could be that nctly seen, but the other colours were mixed and uncertain to the eye. They gradually faded away, and no idea of the positions could possibly be obtained from the flat until the home turn was made, when Stockwell was seen to be still leading, but somewhat less in advance than when at the back of the course, At the turn into the straight, a dirty muddy looking jacket set off with a light bar was seen to go up to the front, but it was impossible to identify the horse, and before a shrewd guess could be hazarded, a long straggling field had shot past the winning post, and the race was decided Until the numbers were posted the million were in a state of utter perplexity. Immediately after the Cup race the crowd, by an unconverted but unanimous movement, turned tail upon the weather, and scampered away over the fields through the thick wet cross home ward bound. THE CUP ATTAINING ITS MAJORITY. It is just 21 years since the first Melbourne Cup race was run. Before the Cup there were Champion Races, and, still earlier, matches, between New South Wales and Victorian horses. Intercolonial racing such as we have now has all sprung up in the lifetime of a horse ! Only a month or two ago The Marquis was led round on the tan, before Mr Yuille's rostrum, under an awning, at the National show yards, and the ring of sportsmen present were invited to bid for the veteran, foaled in HOLT-The year of the first Australian Champion Race, when Flying Buck led the hunt Prior to 1859, the representatives of the colonies had only met in matches, such as on the day when the powerful chesnut Veno, from New South Wales, beat our grey champion mare Alice Hawthorn A wooden box then did duty for the grand Bland, over by the Salt water River, while the since famous hill was at that time only peppered with a few buggies and stray spectators On the same day the New South Wales horse Cooramin beat Tom- boy, and Veno beat Van Tromp So we were" thrashed all round Tomboy afterwards retrieved our laurels by boating Veno, and his victory created immense excitement. It was announced that Tomboy and his rider Sam Holmes, would appear on the stage at the Princess's Theatre, but the little brown horse could not be persuaded to face the audience, BO Ins jockey walked on alone in the popular yellow jacket We have. In Australia, types of the Arab horse of the Sahara, from which out racerB emanate. Such Arabs are the Messrs Learmonth s Abdallah and Serang of the pure Kuhlman or Nedje breed They incline a good deal to the grey, a colour which is almost eliminated from the cracks of the British turf Every racehorse of blue blood in Australia has a recorded pedigree traces able right back to the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Arabian, or some other Steed of the desert. Yet the Bedouins cannot produce a horse having anything like the dash of the English racer The superiority of the blood imported to New South Wales over that in Victoria was long evident, tomboy a blare of glory ended with his relegation to the shafts of his owner a buggy, and Mr Orr drove about for many years the little old brown horse on whose back he had sported the canary silk at Flemington Tomboy a defeat of Veno was a flash in the pan, and flying Bucks Champion victory was a fluke The regular ding dong of racing was all in favour of Sydney Melbourne was never dashed into higher excitement than by the Champion Race which resulted in a dead heat between De Mestre's Tarragon and Tait's Volunteer, two Sydney horses The event made a local sensation like that created by the match between Flying Dutchman and Voltigeur, at York Victorian present" is mainly due to the introduction of the great Fisherman, who was established at Manly byrnong, a delicious estate occupying a loop of the Saltwater River, so that a straight fence, from water to water, completes the enclosure of the whole Many can remember the eagerness with which turf patrons watched the titbits of the 1 Sherman youngsters on the Melbourne course. They were expected to brush away the young Premiers and Dolos like flies The fillies did better than the colts, The latter seemed to be under a cloud, until Fishhook entered upon his memorable contest with The Barb, which left the supremacy doubt. Maribyrnong hurt a foot, and could never be raced, otherwise he might have been the Grand 1 labour of his time Angler was unlucky, too These two horses stand at present foremost among Victorian-bred aires. Longdown the vista of Melbourne Cups, we may take this series as illustrating the whole history of intercolonial racing, after a few Champion Races and the events above mentioned The first Cup was won in 1861 by De Mestre s Archer, winch boroo also won the second, in 1802 Cutta rode him This jockey was a rival of Uiggerson, Ashworth, Driscoll, Donnelly, and Stanley, on the New South Wales side Uiggerson was a particularly fine rider, and a most instructive man to listen to, in his odd mixture of enthusiasm with scientific theory " A man must put his whole soul into a big race' was one of his sayings Ashworth rode for Unit mostly and is remembered for his victories on Zoo and Volunteer. He ran neck and neck with Higgerson in professional fame Ashworth still traine for " Old John, and wired up Strathearn for the last Hawkesbury Handicap White anxiously watching that horse in the race he was knocked down, with three other men, by Comet, which bolted off the course "They talk about this Comorin he said, 'but does his gallops at early morn at a million miles an hour. I hope I shan't be about when he runs into our world, for I tell you these comets knock too hard The old fellow was in the saddle again, brisk as ever, at Randwick, after being a little while in hospital. It was said of Sam Holmes that he had ridden on every course in Australia long before there were any railway trains to glide about in His Victorian compeers in the pigskin were Waldock, Later, Monaghan, Simpson, Perkins Wilson, and many more found in the chronicles of antique cory In 1863 Victoria snatched the Melbourne Cup, with Harper e Banker In 1861 we had it again, with Hurtle Fishers Lantern by Muscovado Both these horses were three-year olds. By this time the 1 fisherman stock were coming, forward under the rose and black stripes of Mr Hurtle Fisher A pilgrimage may yet be made to 1 fisherman s grass on the Maribyrnong estate, which ought to be provided with a tear So tie for " old sports such a phial as via late Sir Redmond Barry exhumed from an ancient Italian grave, and presented to our National Museum fisherman's distinguished son, Maribyrnong is on the New South Wales side, at Mr towns, in company rath Grand Flaneur in ISOjtbe Melbourne Cup was won by grey Toryboy, an old and indifferent son of Premier, who gave the Victorian turf Mormon, Dying Jib, and MuBidora the last named little mare was a nut, and nearly snatched the Cm once, if not twice Her revenge came later with the success of her daughter Briseis Tory boy's year was remarkable for the splendid running of Panic, who came in second, at top weight, having been fetched away from the stud, to which he returned, there achieving a name second to no Australian sire for all the qualities which make useful horses, as compared with gambling machines," the term applied to Blair Athol s Stocks in England, with their shelly feet and general want of soundness Mormon rode Panic in the Melbourne Cup, and the defeat is said to have been because the jockey was weak through over wasting for another mount Panic, being a desperately strong puller, ran away with his rider, and got out of band.

If the Cup brings all horses fairly in line, then a survey of 21 years ought to show that the prizes are distributed more among the weights In the course of years the Victorian Derby, like the poor, will probably outvie any handicap The Melbourne Cup may now be near its zenith the Champion Race, under present conditions, will never replace it as the carnival There have been, and are, ambitious minds in England with an idea that the Epsom Derby will ultimately have to yield the lead to a great handicap such as the Cesarewitch, the Liverpool Cup, or something like that Heavy added money is given by the Manchester people, with the notion of bringing the crowd there Yet nothing can break the charm of the great meeting of the three year olds on equal terms, while the Two Thousand Guineas and other sapling stakes have still left their merits in abeyance Reflecting, in common with all other newspaper moralists, on the added crowds brought to the Cup by the new railway, we also think over our experience of improved locomotion for the racehorse that is, in conveying him about One may almost say that we can put a horse in the tram at Randwick and take him out at Flemington the best groomed turf is not so smooth as the iron or steel rail The most delicate cattle may be launched upon the turf indifferently in Melbourne or Sydney, for the horrors of the middle Boat passage are no more Travellers will have a vivid recollection of me steamer a tween decks filled with racehorses, up to their knees in straw bumping about in their well padded cell in stormy weather Now it is heads up, and now tails, with neighing, stamping snorting, and the din of the jockey boys What owner can forget the 1 leseare, after this, of seeing all his horses started once more on land, at night, when the dim glow of the stable lamp shimmers over the line of haunches, covered with their check cloche of red and white Then, with the incense breathing early morn, we have them all out, in a string, for their gallops over the cinder or the tan talking about the Melbourne Cup, we should have referred to the succession of first class animals of the last 21 years which do not show Cups to their credit, such as Fishhook, TireworkR, Mermaid, The Ace, King of the Ring, Dagworth, First King, His Lordship Lurline, and Richmond To such a hat the enemies of handicaps will point On the other hand, the Champion Race does not always appear to produce the champion horse, unless we are now to look uporvC (irons as holding the belt till next New Year's Day At one time the handicap was quite an exceptional thing at Flemington the important events were run in two heats, proven three, and horses raced up to the distance of four miles We can call to mind, too, an eccentric wealthy sportsman of the period, Mr Twisden Hodges, who maintained that handicaps would become all the rage Because the Victorian Turf Club refused to put more than about 1 per cent of handicaps on the programme he presented a large prize himself for a handicap This was at the same meeting where J P Hydes, of the Queen a Theatre, was doing such good business as to be able to give of 1 thespian cup At the outbreak of the gold fever the Queen was the only theatre deserving of the name in Melbourne. It was nearly 30 years ago that this cup was run for Not long afterwards Bourke street became the home of the drama, and the old Queen a was transformed into a coach factory, but Mr Hy dea himself only passed away so recently as last Sunday week Another odd recollection we have of a meet rag which took place nearly thirty years ago, me beat race meeting of Melbourne was held once, and only once, without a drop of alcohol being sold on the racecourse ' The reason of this was that three men had been killed at the previous meeting, through being thrown from their horses, while intoxicated Surely we have improved since that time with 100,000 on the course, solitary drunkards having to be searched for Hardly anyone now goes to the races on horseback This style once used to be the correct thing As soon as a race started, a mob of cavalry went off straight across the course to see the racers pass the bill, then nearly opposite the grand stand and three quarters of a mile away There is fanciful speculation about the colour of racehorses The preference for dark bay may be accounted for as we account for white sheep eating more than black sheep-there are more of them. The brown is more predominant here, comparatively speaking, than in England among heavy winners, through the Fisherman bias The blood bay does not shine, and, looking over the great horses referred to in this article, we hardly see one of that colour The chesnut Stockwell, with his white legs, and occasionally the Blair Athol forehead blaze, have left a streak on the Australian turf, brough Marquis and Ace of Clubs, but merely an individual opinion) we think this strain IS thinning quite away. The Australian hat of eminent chesnuts may be numbered on the fingers of one hand, begin ning Bay, with Dagworth OurStockwolIshavo nearly all been imported of the mother's colour conceding Fisherman the first place as a sure, we must rank the late Yattendon next, with rich area on Grand Flaneur, Cheater, and tl8M0t,eb' who was only weighted out of goal A Burne Cups- Maribyrnong has for do iT mOre is noted with than Yatton you, but yet (speaking Individually again) we see not think that Hamlet, Horatio, Richmond, The Diver, Miss Jessie, Woodlands Calamia, Segenhoe, and Hecla attain to the Yattendon record. English Tim Whiffler made an astonishing spare a few years ago when his fillies Briseis and Sibyl ron first and second for the Victorian Derby and Melbourne Cup, just as Grand Flaneur and Progress did in 1880 Among the new names now figuring is Grand Master, the sire of Sting. This is the introduction of French blood to our turf, Grand Master being by the renowned Gladiateur, by Monarque But, of course, another remove shows this to be English blood, too, just as with the Hungarian Fisher, which snatched an Epsom Derby, as the French did before with Gladiateur, and the Yankees afterwards with Iroquois HOW THE CUP SHOULD BE RIDDEN " You will observe, ' said a past grand- master in jockeyship, who had some spare minutes on his hand before the engrossing event took place, ' you will observe that the Cup course is like one of those musical signs, a loop with a tail The tail loads down to the Cup start You have a straight gallop of half a mile to the stand Then you round the corner to the left, and gallop nearly three quarters of a mile straight there is a turn by the abattoirs, and a curve leads you right round to the straight for the run in, Well, I usually know as weeks or so before what is to be my mount for the Cup A jockey, in practice, has besides a tolerable ' all round knowledge of the horses that are in running With such a Blake as the Cup, the owner, if he intends to win, takes care that I am well acquainted with my horse, over the tan or cinder " I can't say that the winning of a big affair like the Melbourne Cup affords particular scope for artistic horsemanship, The grand jockeyship in the Cup race has too often been among the losers One of the best and most successful bits of showy riding was by Cutts, when he rode Archer the second time to victory, in 1862 He waited on them 'lag last, and then picked off his horses beautifully one by one flinging them behind him The day of such tactiCB is past even with an Archer The St Albans stable has generally shown a peculiar style of riding, the inspiration of the genius and experience of Mr J Wilson He trained his two sons, who were formidable light weights, one after the other As the second grew out of the G stone register, he was replaced by St Albans, who has proved him self pretty well up to the mark of the Wilson blood If you have watched these three riders, you will perceive that they have all been great on the finish-the rush on the post-' the St Albans rush is the word lins involves a careful nursing of your horse until the critical moments in old times in England, that is to say over 60 years ago, Sam Chifney a rush was proverbial. In the next generation 'Aldcrofts rush was in variably looked for this is a feature, too, in Archer s riding, and every jockey has his own recipe " In Wales we have a clever, if not a great artist. His brightest performances were on Grand Flaneur, with whose name he is identified, in the glorious season of 1886 when the great Sydney horse was invincible, and beat our Progress every time they met without taking any trouble over it Grand Flaneur a Cup race was momentous Hales knew that the envious eyes of his brethren were specially directed to him He got away a little wide so as to avoid as breeze Then he manipulated the field as nicely as possible His management of the race was something like that of Cutts on Archer, referred to above, but Hales took a more forward place amongst the crowd He knew the quality of the magnificent animal palpitating under him Hales speaks of these as the happiest moments of his life He knew that his horse was the purest steel, and despised the field. At the same time there was the golden opportunity of a clear stage, against which the chances had been so great Hales felt he was winning as he liked all the way up past the lawn He could come and go on the horse TV uni. a pity there was nothing better than Progress an admirable racer notwithstanding-to draw out this 1 clipBe of our day He sailed in with a full sheet, the worthiest of Cup winners Another horse which lives in the fond memories of jockeys is The Barb His heart was as big as a pumpkin When called upon he would shake his head, as much as to say ' I tell you I'm doing my best ' An equally game look had Navigator last Saturday when he came out for the Derby canter, and I felt I had put my money on the right horse when I saw him lifting up his head to get a sight for himself the course and the crowd beyond the rails and across the flat Some horses come out to do what they are bidden, and others to work out their own salvation A great horse knows when he a got a big race on hand long before the flag drops "I recollect once Merinos saddle turning right round as he was finishing at Fleming ton, but he came in first with the saddle dangling, while the jockey rode on the bare edge of the horse's backbone This was a fair win A jockey is liable to be fined for losing his cap, but will not be disqualified if he weighs in all right Archer, Fordham, and other crack jockeys at home have started a fashion of occasionally riding youngsters without whip or spur in the belief that those incentives are but seldom absolutely required. " Did you notice the quiet, easy going look round Hales took on Navigator last Saturday near the finish ' He had his wife just as fully about him as when he took the trial gallop, and the race was nothing more Many a flurried jockey has been beaten on the post through just glancing over his shoulder They say that in the race for the Caulfield Cup the jockey on Verdure was looking back over the wrong shoulder when Little Jack stole up between him and the rails, where he ought to have kept a closed road Such a movement by Day on Nimblefoot would have made Lapdog first in 1870 for the Cup, and such a look, again, would in fallibly have caused Pigott on Chester to be beaten by Savanaka, when race it would have been in two yards more These were both W llaon rushes, like that on Romula, which failed to overhaul Pear), in 1871 " Hales stands at the head of the flat racing jockeys, OF Corrigan leads the jumpers, but, intrinsically, I look on Corrigan as the best horseman in the country I find his name only in one Melbourne Cup list, and not placed He has every requisite splendid dash as well as judgment. In fact he is the Scoboleff or General Sheridan of the cross country Saddle Doubtless he would be far and away the premier of the flat if he could come to the scale lighter Yeomans in a most reliable man. I would like to see the winning brackets brought out as in England Cracknell is the one for making the pace a 'cracker,' to borrow the sporting jargon, and yet scoring wins His performance on Damwell, winning the Cup was almost Superb Pigott is a thoroughly good jockey, too he can always be entrusted with a first class horse Among ourretiredjockeyson the Victorian side, Morrison deserves special praise, not only for horsemanship, but also for his example he was, and is a beautiful rider, the beau ideal for handling a young blue blooded Gasworks or Charon His temper never failed. I recollect him putting spirits again into Glencoe, and restoring him to the ranks of the winners, when other jockeys said the horse had walked away to nothing On the New South Wales side, Joseph Kean and Stanley ought not to be overlooked in your gallery None more brilliant than Keen at his best, or more dogged than Stanley. I remember two jockeys fighting in a race at Randwick. I was going to give you their names, but refrain as I happen to see that one of the names appears in this Melbourne Cup race Yes, the two rocks flogged, not their horses, but each other ' Of course, they were had up before the stewards, and smartly dealt with, This puts me in mind of a case in the hunting (field, In Leicestershire, where two huntsmen flogged at each other with their long whips, over a distance of three miles, taking the jumps almost together, and resuming the fan between whiles. There must have been a lady in that case " But what you want to know is how we ride Cup races Well the day comes We saddle up, and weigh out We are not hasty in getting through the gates, be cause there is an idea that the first horse out IS unlucky Many jockeys have a regular fancy for coming out late Now, I give my horse his preliminary canter or gallop There are some horses you must get away for a gallop before the start or they are pretty sure to be left on the post Others will bound right off at any moment a great advantage Some good ones are sure to be stiff and must have their homes oiled by a downright rattle for a quarter of a mile My instructions are either (1) to wait on them and come towards the finish 2 to make the running on my own account (3) to make the running for another horse , (1) to block Something, With a really first class bore the instructions will be to wait and come One of inferior stamp with dash of foot and a weight that is a great deal too light-say a Nimblefoot, a Haricot a Darnwell or a Zulu must usually be forced to the front, and kept there Then there is the horse on which I am only put to wind and tire out favourites This animal shoots a marvellous bolt and makes good ones run away so that they race pumped and flustered, and cannot come at the right moment when our second string whatever it is, the horse meant, Blips up "It is no use blinking the fact that some horace started altogether on the off chance are very useful at jamming the favourite upon the rails and keeping in front of something You have got the inside on a scrubber, and are deaf to all the cries of the man behind with a horse full of running to let him come up The new fence round the course in a helptotheso tactics and a fearfully dangerous thing besides You see the Cup field is such a mob that it obscures a good deal of scientific riding There is a ruck jumbled together like the worms in a pot when you go Calling the ruck will hug the rails but if you gallop wide you have ever so much further to go Just figure out the course on a sheet of paper, and calculate "We draw for places before going to the start One has to get off well and yet in hand We must have as near as we can to being fined As I pass the stand I have some idea whether it is my horses day out No one can afford to be the last along that oblique stretch your horse may die away at the abattoirs, and you will not really ride him another yard Suppose you feel him pulling double there then he had a splendid chance Trou let him comfortably price one after another and rounding the turn he is among the first half dozen who have shaken off the field Now you can ride freely as if there was no score of horses behind For the finish you must sit down on your saddle If flogging a man has to be careful not to strike another horse on the nose which may throw him out of his stride and hung in a foul The arm is revolved and you skim your horse a flank It is a nice point to decide whether you shall run it out or not A bad second or third will ruin your horse in future band cops and ensure you a blowing up for not easing him off Owners don't care much for places A jockey who keeps his head cool knows when he is doing a dead horse If you feel the go in him why, let him run it out if there is a ghost of a chance Still, take for your maxim, ' First or nowhere THE RACING The racing commenced with the Maldon Plate, for which seven horses started, Belmont being the favourite at odds against the field Aide de Camp made the running" till nearing the turn into the straight', where Belmont, who had been running very handy all the way went to the front and notwithstanding a good effort on the part of Caima won very easily Gostwyck was a poor third The Railway Stakes, which followed brought out SIX Flatters Prome the us who was made a strong favourite notwithstanding his recent indisposition, went to the front soon after the start and held his place full of running till reaching the turn for home where he compounded suddenly and Boolka who had been running second all the way, went to the front and held his place all the way home Colstoun was a good second and Larpent a fair third Pell Melb ran fairly, but seemed unable to make an effort at the finish Sir Oliver ran badly all the way Sixteen youngsters started for the Kensington Stakes which was won in good style by Lady Jervois who ran in the front from the start Halifax was second and Off Colour third Scarcely anything but the placed horses were mentioned in the betting The winner was put up to auction and bought by Dr Fitzgerald for 400 guineas The sky had been for some time growing more gloomy, and by the time the race was over the rain began to fall heavily Long before the jockeys began to weigh out for the Melbourne Cup the stand was crowded with spectators all anxious to get a look at the great race The passages were so densely packed that it was impossible for the occupants to move As the bell rang for weighing the rain came down very heavily and those who could not get under shelter were soon thoroughly Boal ed Under these circumstances the toilettes of the Cup candidates were performed as hastily as possible, the rusH not being stripped off till the very last moment the usual final polish so dear to the hearts of stablemen was therefore dispensed with The parade which is such a marked feature in the race for the Melbourne Cup and which is so much appreciated by the ladies was not observed on this occasion, the horses coming on to the course in the usual style As most of the joel cyB wore overcoats it was with difficulty the uninitiated could distinguish the horses The rain continued to descend heavily, and entirely robbed the preliminary gallops of all interest Owing to the misty state of the at Biosphere and the backers of the jockeys being wet and dirty it was almost impossible to tell the relative position of the horses and soon after the start, owing to the mud flung up by the horses all the riders were of one colour before they reached the stand The first to show at the post was Sting followed by Lord Burghley, Mistaken, and King of the Vale, and then, in the midst of a blinding shower, the rest cantered down in Indian file the majority of the riders enveloped in top coats As the public favourite trotted down the line he was cheered by the spectators Mr Wat son was early down at the post, and as soon as the boys discarded their outer covering be gave the order to marshall into line Lord Burghley took up the inside position next the rails, and stood as quiet as a sheep till the word was given to go tsexttohim was Jessie, King of the Vale Little Jack, Sting and Segenhoe The centre division was occupied by Sweet Wil 1mm, Missal on, Lord Lisgar Odd Trick, Stockwell, Anglesey, Standard Bearer, The Assyrian, The Drummer, and Darebin Those on the outside were First Water, Police, Segenhoe, Brunette, Cunnamulla, Savanaka, and the others Cunnamulla exhibited his temper, and lashing out but missed Little Jacks near hind quarter As he was becoming dangerous to the other horses, Mr Wat- son removed him to the outside, and next to Savanaka After one or two attempts they were sent away at 10 minutes past o clock in a heavy shower of rain to a very even start, Sting in the centre, Stockwell, Gudarz, and two on the outside getting a little the best of it Lord Burghley and Jessie were both Blow In moving As they swept by the Stand Flying Jib was in front, Stockwell was next, Gudarz, Little Jack, Santa Claus, Sweet William, and Drummer were close up After rounding the tnmpsBt the stand, Stockwell went to the front, led along by the river and round the far turn, where Segenhoe raised the hopes of his followers by showing for a moment near the head of the main body At the sheds Mis taken went upon the outside and took third place, but he compounded very suddenly before reaching the turn for home At the half mile post Stockwell was a clear lead in front, and going in such form that it was the firm opinion of all who were watching him that the Melbourne Cup would go to Tas mania Assyrian who had been running, second from the far turn, and Gudarz who was next were being ridden in chase of the leader Darebin and Sweet William were at the head of the second division Stock veil led into the straight and was going so well that a general cry arose of " Stockwell wins Assyrian, however came on very gamely under the whip, and Darebin next the raid!" made a fine effort to get up to the leaders Half way up the straight Stockwell Assyrian, and Darebin were close together The big horse dropped back before reaching the distance and nearing home ABsynan passed Stockwell and won by nearly a length The victory of Assyrian was a great surprise the horse not having been mentioned in the betting since the Caulfield meeting where he never got near the front in the Caulfield Cup won by Little Jack It was noticed however, yesterday that the horse was being backed quietly but persistently in the paddock Assyrian was backed some months ago but after his defeat in the Caulfield Cup the public lost faith in him Assyrian is a good looking bay horse, with plenty of power and standing nearly 10 hands high He is by Countryman (imp ) out of Tinfinder by Tarragon out of Deceptive He was bred by the late Mr Holland, at Turret field, S A, and sold as a yearling to Mr Barnard for 90 guineas He afterwards became the property of Mr W 1 the who in turn sold him to Mr Saville, his present tra net Mr J Allison, the theatrical agent in conjunc- lion with one or two friends bought him a few months ago for 1300 Hewasheavily backed by his present owners for the Caulfield Cup and so disappointed were they at his performance in the race that it is said one of them laid heavily against him for the Cup Had a first class jockey been on Stockwell the Cup would, in all probability have gone to Tas mania the most creditable performance in the race was undoubtedly that of Darebin who with his long striding action and heavy weight would suffer more than any other horse from the state of the ground He showed that he is a the roughly game horse and that he can stay a distance as well us carry weight The victory of Assyrian is a great relief to the fielders for though he was backed fairly some time ago and a good deal of money was put on him in the paddock, he was a much better winner for the ring than most of the starters The race for the Melbourne Cup of 1882 was a disappointing one alike for the backers of horses and the few who like to see a truly run race without the additional excitement of gambling From the state of the ground it was felt by all racing men that it was as outsiders race and consequently there was a lack of that excitement and intense interest that usually accompanies this great race In the Darling Stakes, which followed Essex very easily dis- posed of the five horses brought out against him Sinking Fund was second Tamworth was third Lnan Born slipped and fell soon after the start, and a drunken man got in the way of Doctor near the sheds and caused him to fall The rider was not much hurt but the drunken man was a good deal shaken The winner was put up for sale and bought by Mr T W Wilson for 140 guineas The Yan Yean Stakes brought the day a racing to a conclusion Bagot won comfortably length in front

The bookmakers returned to town yesterday with much lighter hearts than they went out-thanks to the victory of Assyrian in the Melbourne Cup There are no large winners in the ring, but they were saved in the very bad double books which the victory of Navigator in the Derby caused Assyrian, who is owned by Messrs J Allison and T Barn field, was backed for a good amount in Adelaide, and the owners landed £8 000 A well known Ballarat stockbroker won a couple of thousand, and Mr Allen and Mr A Josephs lost £1,000 each having laid the double half of the latter s money going to Sandhurst Assyrian, on the whole, was a very good horse for the ring, as his starting price was 83 to 1 The public so far, however, have had the best of the wagering, as out of 12 races the ring have been hit on 11 To night books will be opened on the Oaks Stakes, the V R C Handicap, the Hurdle Race, and the Steeplechase BAY EXCURSIONS As a counter attraction to the Cup meeting the committee of the Young Men's Christian Association organised their ordinary annual picnic to Queenscliff, and for that purpose chartered the steamers Williams, Casino, and Pharos All the adherents of the association, and a number of others who do not find an joyment in race meetings mustered in force There were upwards of 1 000 altogether, and a special train conveyed them from Melbourne to Sandridge, where the steamers were berthed The embarkation was conducted without any difficulty, the numbers being divided between the steamers-the Williams, whose passenger accommodation is very large taking about 400 She left at 9 o'clock (half an hour before the others), and reached the Queenscliff pier after a run of three hours and a half On the way down the passengers amused themselves with various games, and were entertained by the music of the Blind Asylum brass band The two other steamers gained on the Williams and completed the trip in about a quarter of an hour less time On berthing the Casino, the wind caught her and sent her with great force broadside on to the Williams, smashing the rails of the latter steamer carrying away her awnings BUP porte, and almost starving in her star- board after boat The excursionists landed expeditiously, and the majority of them went to the reserve at the rear of the new battery to play cricket and indulge in various pastimes, while others engaged themselves in games on the Band At 3 o'clock the Wesleyan Church bell called a number of people to that place, and services were conducted by the Rev. Messrs Langley and Macartney and Dr. Porter About this time the rain began to fall very heavily, and those persons who were out of doors crowded rapidly on board the steamers to obtain shelter The rain did not cease for the rest of the trip, and it completely spoiled the enjoyment of the visitors The Williams left for Melbourne at 23 minutes to 4, followed a quarter of an hour later by the Pharos, while the Casino waited until half-past 4 for the purpose of picking up any stragglers She reached the wharf at 8 o'clock On the return passage of this vessel the excursionists were addressed by the Rev Messrs Langley and Macartney and Dr Porter The singing was conducted by Mr Alfred Johnston Among the passengers were Major Barker and Captain Sutherland, of the Salvation Army, who are on a visit to this colony The manner in which the excursion was managed reflects credit on the committee and its secretary Mr Marsh The paddle steamer Albatross made an excursion to Queenscliff, leaving the Sandridge railway pier at half-past 9am, and making a smart trip down the bay She was not well patronised, but the passengers had a pleasant day until the weather changed The steamer left Queenscliff at few minutes after four, and reached Sandridge at a quarter to 8 The two steamers that trade between Melbourne and Geelong ran at excursion fares yesterday, and the facilities thus afforded for enjoying a short marine trip were utilised by several hundred pleasure seekers At half-past 9 in the forenoon the Edina left the Queen's wharf with a full complement of between 300 and 400 passengers A band accom- panied the steamer, and considerably enlivened the passage down to the Pivot, which was reached shortly after half- past 1 Three hours were allowed the visitors to inspect the various eights of interest in Geelong, and at half-past 4 the steamer started on her return trip to Melbourne the Alert left Geelong at an early hour, bringing between 200 and 300 excursionists and arriving in ample time to allow her passengers to witness the first race at Flemington EVENING I NTLRIAINMENTS Of the thousands of people who annually visit Flemington racecourse on the Cup Day there [are very few who have the slightest intention of allowing the sports to terminate their days pleasuring Their betting speculations may be unsatisfactory, they may be drenched by an unexpected downpour of rain, and many things may conspire to mar their pleasure and ruffle the serenity of their tempers, but they have the consolation of knowing that at night they will be afforded an opportunity of reviving their spirits The various places of entertainment in the city, as a rule, offer on Cup night the greatest attractions available. The caterers for public amusement are aware that golden harvests await their efforts if well directed, and they therefore take pains to make the performancesattheirestablishments as alluring as possible They have to supply the craving of country cousins for a good lough, a startling tableau, a piece of declamatory elocution, or anything which will cause them to say that if the proceedings of the day were indifferently enjoyable those of the night were not so Last night the pieces performed at the theatres offered plenty of variety, and that there were many diverse tastes to be satisfied was proved by the closely packed array of forces which awaited the rising of the different curtains At the Opera house Von Suppe s comic opera, " Boccaccio was repeated by the excellent company who have for so long tenanted the boards of this place of amusement Dress circle, stalls, pit and galleries were filled with an assemblage thoroughly capable of appreciating the humour and the music of the piece One who had attended the theatre frequently during the last two months would find plenty of a novel kind of diversion in watching the unrestrained delight of country visitors as they submitted themselves to the full enjoy- ment of the hour Every joke told upon them, and applause and laughter were indulged in without stint The system of electric lighting adopted by the management was an interesting feature to many, who probably witnessed the introduction of the new source of public illumination for the first time The spectacular drama " Youth, at the Theatre Royal, was favoured by, if possible, a still more numerous attendance. Every part of the building was packed, and judging by the outward manifestations of satisfaction those present must have enjoyed the performance immensely. The varying fortunes of Frank Darlington were watched with interest ; the broad Irish brogue and humour of Larry O Pheysey were received with repeated bursts of laughter and the cleverly contrived situations of the play evidently excited a good deal of admiration A drama with such an attractive title as "The Green Lanes of England could not fail to draw many visitors into the Bijou Theatre, and the management of that establishment also participated largely in the general augmentation of receipts, " The Strategist," at the Princess's Theatre, was repeated before a very large audience, who revelled in the up. reasons mirth with which it abounds One of the features of the comedy is that, whatever laughable misfortunes happen to one of the characters, there is always some other character who is amused thereby, and with him or her the audience is at perfect liberty to sympathise. Sympathy of this kind was not wanting last night, and the house was in a simmer of pleasurable excitement from beginning tend Mr Maccabe'aveteranenter tainment drew a full complement of visitors to the Victoria hall The effect of the performance of the popular delineator is one which is admirably described by the distinguishing motto, "Begone Dull Care The eccentric post- prandial speech of the old gentleman whose words and ideas, though so few are so forcibly expressed, the modern minstrel' performances, and the other clever conceptions which formed the programme threw the audience into fits of mirth, in the midst of which the stentorian daughter of a voice from the back blocks would occasionally be heard with startling distinctness On the outpouring of the various assemblages, the streets were again filled to inconvenience, but the suddenly formed crowds Been dispersed, leaving the city to all outward appearance in its normal condition. THE TOWN-HALL. The experience of the first promenade entertainment at the Town hall on Monday night was so favourable that the second entertainment, which took place last night, was given in the presence of an immense audience, and in the midst of even more emphatic approval than on Monday night, and with the same general consensus of unmixed satisfaction at the end of it The programme was compiled on the same plan as that previously noticed by UB, but it was different in detail. Miss Alice Rees sang in the first part of the programme "Only to know," a melodious song by Plumpton, in the place of " Waiting for the King, which was the title of the song given in the programme In the second part she Stung "The Shadow Song," from "Dinorah." These were the two holes for the soprano voice, the last-named being the great vocal achievement of the evening, and one to fully sustain the reputation of the talented young artist who sang it. It was remarkable for perfect purity of intonation in the production of difficult intervals and for fluent delivery, and deserved the enthusiastic applause with which it was received. The name of Mr. Moule, the accompanist, deserves to be specially mentioned in connexion with the success of this last named performance. Miss Christian was particularly happy in her solo selections, which were the pathetic Scotch song "Caller LTemn'" and "The Merry Old Maid," composed by Louis Diehl, and heard for the first time here in public The humour in this last named song was keenly relished by the audience, who applauded the singer greatly, and honoured her with a recall. The two duets sung by these ladies were " O come to me," composed by Kucken, and a bar moniBcd arrangement of "Ye banks and brass Miss Christian and Miss Keys are to be thanked for introducing to the concert room such a beautiful composition as the duet by Kucken just named, and the effect of their voices in the familiar Scotch duet was ingratiating that both singers were recalled amidst great warmth of applause Miss Lucie Martin, a young lady pupil of Madame Carlotta TOBCO, ployed Benedicts "Erin,' a well known pianoforte fantasia on Irish airs, including " My lodging in on the cold ground, and " The Minstrel Boy " Miss Martin shows the result of good training, and gives promise of a firm and vigorous touch. The performance was received with marked favour by the audience, and the young lady was re- called amidst a shower of bouquets. Mr. David Lee's Selections at the organ were admirably suited to the tastes of a great mixed audience. They consisted of the overture to "Semiramide" by Rossini, a Fan. tasia arranged by David Lee on airs from Flotow's " Martha," and a fan taste, also of his own arranging, on "Irish National Airs " In the overture the orchestral effects were very well brought out, and particularly that characteristic effect the RcsBinian crescendo In the operatic selection from " Martha, the " Last Rose of Summer ' was BO exquisitely played that the charm which belongs to the beautiful tune was felt in its highest force. There seemed to be thorough accord between the audience and the player. Mr W E Sheridan was received with the most flattering warmth of welcome, and carried out his important share in the entertainment with conspicuous success He read the concluding part of the second act in " King Lear," that part which contains the most temble malediction in the language, and which was the first achievement to stamp the reader here as a great Shakspearian actor The recitation of Le 1 army's " Shamus O'Brien was delivered with such a rich brogue, euch sense of humour, and penetrating sympathy as roused the audience into stormy approval. "The Bells,' by Foo, amoBtdiflioult subject to recite, was rendered by Mr Sheridan with novel and heightened effect through the organ accompaniment, which Mr David Leo improvised, and with which he reflected the tonal colour of the silver, the golden, the brazen, and the other bells spoken of in the room, The effect was curious and interesting, but we will not say that it will be lasting Finally Mr. Sheridan gave a fine recitation of " The Seven Ages of Man, and a comical sketch of his own called " First Lessons in Elocution." The popular actor was recalled with enthusiasm, after each appearance, but on his final recitation be was recalled three times before he was allowed to retire There are to be 500 extra chair sittings provided for visitors to-night The general programme. which appears in another column, a new and attractive. Mr Sheridan will repeat the scene from "King Lear," "The Seven Ages of Man," and the First Lessons in elocution,' and will recite, In addition, The Yarn of the Nancy Bell and " Sheridan's Ride "
