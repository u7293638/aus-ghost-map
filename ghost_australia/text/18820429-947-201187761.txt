OfiuaHEp.[ AnkIiE.— On' .Saturday afternoon^. an -accident occurred on. the wharf, by which, a man named Edward Kearney was seriously injured. Kearney ,- with several other' lumpers, had just finished their work at about 3 :3Q', and were* sitting on the staging which reached from the wharf to the steamer Esk. :The arrival of ) the ' Mangana ? agitated 'the water'and .caused the Esk to mpv^,'when the lanyard' which fastened the ; staging to the vessel became , unfastened;. and , it fell.. -l Unfortunately Kearney .was sitting with his- foot -under the staging, 'which weighs over: 7owt.;J together with- the ^weight of the' ten men on \it,: , arid , it crushed , his,., foot ' on the- wharf. :, The sufferer was taken, home, and Dr; Stewart,, ?who attended on him,' pronounced that nobones'were broken, but' the foot was dreadfully, crushed. Kearney, we ba lie'ye, .is'.'a poor man with a large /family of children depending on him for:-supr port, anddt 'Will fbe) a considerable time ; before he, will be able to' return to work. ' ?? Received.— We have received the first number, dated April'- 17 thj. of the Mining; Chronicle,' a' rxevr weekly journal started iii i Melbourne,' by the well-known' firm of 'Ai ' EL' Massina and Co., and devoted as .. its - name denotes,- to the collectionand classi- : fication; of mining news, which is now; scattered o ver 'many channels. ;, The ipro- [ priefors state' their idea* is ' ' that ' mining ? shareholders will thus have brought into one paper a thoroughly reliable record of ' all matters affecting their interests in 'as concise a- form as possible, thereby effect ing a great saving of time,', aiid enabling ' them, with little trouble, to watch, the in- ? terests they hold, and be relieved from the necessity of searching a number of papers with the' risk of overlooking the^ most, important items.' There ia ino doubti such a journal would be of great service! to shareholders and others, if the standard set up can be maintained, but' though a; great deal of trouble has evidently been taken in gathering the reports '.of'1 mining managers' arid, particulars for the, tabulated list of mining companies, ; much more still^ -remains to be accomplished, ' and at pre sent the list is confined; to Victorian com panies and Tasmanian' companies regis-, te'red in Victoria. 'The' journal is well, got up, and excellently printed on thicki paper; we wish the new venture .every ; success. ...... ?
