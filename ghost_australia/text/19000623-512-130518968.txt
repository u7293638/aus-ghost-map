INDIAN SUPERSTITIONS. The Bhattia women are very superstitious. They believe in ghosts, demons, and other supernatural beings'; mil! to drive all these out of the house in the evening (for it is just before the lamps are lighted, that all these evil spirits come into tlie house) a woman strikes a light and goes into each room and shows it in every dark corncr,and tho spirits, who are supposed to have a great dislike to any kind of light, go quietly out of 'the. house. Another custom is that they will not eat until a portion of their food is set apart for the cow, whom tlioy all worship. They believe that their food will turn into poison if this is not done ; and one of the women or a servant takes it out and gives it to a cow if one ie in sight, or leaves it on one side of the road. But tlie most unnatural cuBtom that they have is that they never use the ammo 'mother' when speaking of or to their own mother, but they call her Bbabhi, which means sister-in-law. Little -children, i» well as grown up sons and daughters, call ljer sb', and ? the -sweet name of ' mother ' is never heard in their homes. Again, a woman will never say 'my son,' but in speaking of him will say ' the husband, or brother, or nephew of So-and-So.' Tlie first time a Bbattia woman says ' my son ' is after that son is dead. She .believes that if she calls him so while he lives a certain goddess will get so. jealous of her that »be will strike him dead at once.
