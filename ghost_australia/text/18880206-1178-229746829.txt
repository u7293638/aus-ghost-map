MINING INTELLIGENCE. Review of Last Week's Market. Tub week has been one of fluctuations in several progressive Broken Hill stocks, while others whoso position is desorvedly mcro assured, have mot with steady support nt advancing rates. In this latter category are the Proprietary, now worth about JK170, British Brokon Hill, and Block 1-1. These claims may be said to be outudo ordinary progressive stocks. With the parent company at one end, the sstnu out cropping lodo in their own ground, and the Junction Broken UllFCompany at the other end. It Is Impossible hot that they should have the lode | depth only is re quired to give It in its best form. Centrals, whoso prospects nro equally good, hive had a fluctuating market, and leave off £1 lower than at the end of last week. If any company has a goud show for tho money its shares stand nt, it is this, which In n few months from date will probably stand at about 150 or 200 per cent, advance on present prices. South B.U. have experienced tho heaviest fluc tuations, selling on Monday up to £12 15s, and on Tuesday nt £3 "3 Gil ; then on the following day improving to £t07s GJ, only to fail on Thursday to Tuesday's price. South Extended and llising Sun nro affected by these fluctuations in South'. Holders quietly awaiting development can view these market vagaries with in. difference, but they are mischievous as tending to sbnko the confldcnccof nervous investors, who quite fail to see any reojon for this see-saw of prices, now up, now down. New North B.1L are quoted for tbo first time this week. Froui its position on tho lino this company should have an excellent out-look. Tho coupany.floating business appears to be having a good time of it. In u Mel- bourno journal wo count a list of 17 companies launched within tho loot few days. Tho total capital represented is £1,300,000. Not had for ono week. Bat how about the futuro P The calls on now ventures floated and to he floated, will be somvtbiog enormous ; and it is doubtful whether companies «m the iin can smll- cicntly quickly show returns to offer a set-off to tbo numberless ventures in every direction, which will require steady con tributions from tbo public. Our greatest danger lies on this direction. With the above general principle even promoters agree, but each wishes to seo hisowa little venture set afloat, quite regardless of the crop of liabilities which ho helps to aug ment. In former years, in booms as ex- tcnaivo as tho present, it was tho hordeof speculative ventures forced on tho public, and greedily swallowed in u time of specu lation, that helped to cuuso tho ruin of thousands) and as nothing can bo more sure than history repeating Itself, unless some limit is put on tho increasing urea of' mining venture— in tuauy instances backed by no reasonable prospect of suc cess— thu year 1838 may close with a record as memorable for the failures it in duced as for the discoveries it made. The collapse of tbo Jackson's Koet Gold- mining Company, Kimberley, merits a mora than passing notice. In this cue, we have a prospector with a bag. or some bags, of gold- bearing quartz; the quan tity being about half a ton. ArrivuJ in Melbourne, he places himself in communi cation with some leading men on the Stock Exchange, Investors, mine mana gers. To a syndicate so composed ho sells his claim; they having first taken all reasonable precaution against fraud by communication with tho warden of tae district ; also having the golden quartz assayed, Ac. The stone yielded at the rate of -frtoz to the ton. Everything ap pearing satisfactory, tho transfer was effected at a high price, and the new com pany set going. Besides the money spent in acquiring this property, a considerable outlay was incurred for work and material. Months went on, hut the mine produced nothing but glowing reports from tho local mining manager. SoapecUms some thing to be wrong, the directors appointed an honest and practical man to go and take charge of tho property. He went, ilii first impulse was to come straight hack, for ho saw that the whole thing was a sham i but he Immediately wroto to his employers reporting the state of things. In consequenco of tho information thus acquired, a meeting was bold, and the whole thing lias hurst up. A few Jock- eon's Beef episodes, and mining would be loft solely to miners, unsupported by the public. Confidence is at the baso of every true commercial enterprise, and, once thoroughly shaken, it would be diffl- cult to restore. Tho Gold Creek Company has suffered a a great fall in the value of its shares during the past week. It had a crushing of some 175 tons, which yielded ot to the ton. Under ordinary circumstance such a yield should bo considered highly satis- factoy. In tho present instance, judging by ' communications, written and verbal, which we have received, shareholders were led to expect a very much larger return, by,' it is alleged, persons who nadnmplo opportunity for being well informed. It is also stated that theso persona sold out their shares under cover of the golden rumours they had put about. The share holders should Investigate the matter, and act us the evidence may warrant Webb's have bad steady support through the week, at about previous rate. Mount Cottigan have also had a number of calcs, at prices ranging from 50s down toffffs. The week's reported sales in tbo local moikot aro as follow i— Ilarwocl, 3<W, IS 61. SU. S8« 03.

' EhUg Sua, 17 The Mount Costigan Lead and 8llvor Mining Company has produced during the poat week 15 tors of silver lead bullion, assaying over itOOoz of silver to tho ton. Not to bo out of the fashion a silver Itoorn has been inaugurated at Uokitikaia New Zealand, where twenty leases of 100 acres each have been applied for with tho neccwttry consequent excitement. The actual scene of operations Is Mount Uaogitoto, a belt ot isiaoral country currying gold and silver. From thu Waiton wo learn that a pro- firlctorof a mining lead, supposed to bo lighly auriferous, but whicu turned out flulc, has offered a reward of JfilOO for tho conviction of the person who saltod the test parcels of tho stuff from the Waitoa guldiields. Considering that the person offering tho reward is identical with the one who tried to Uoat tho venture the situation is at least comical. The member of the Molbourno Stock Exchange will soon havo to build for theiu- solves, Tbero Is not accommodation lo their prvsont offices for tho applicants for mcmlMirship, though each of these has to pay on entrance fee of X1000. Tho collapse of tho Jockson's Iiccf G. M. Coy., Kimberley, W.A., lias caused grc.it disappointment. Tbo company wits floated with a nominal capital of XI 20,000 in 100JXX) shares of XI -bleach issued paid up to XI. Tho syndicate reserved 00,000 shares to pay for tho purviioie of the pro porty and their own interest. 10,000 shares were offered to the pnblio at XI per share, hut of these about GOOD wero taken up 'by tho promoters, each of whom paid from XGOo to X750 for shares, at tho aatno price as the puhtie obtained thorn. So that at the outset tho Interest of the general pnb lio in the mine was limited to about X K)00, hut as time wore on this was largely la creased. Tho vendors received from tbo syndicate floating tho company about X1200 in cash, and 119,003 paid-up shares. Of these a considerable number have bcon disposed of at prices ranging from 6s upwards ; but about 12,000 of tho shares ore known not to have been sold. Tho XI0.000 realiiod by tho 10,000 1 tores subscribed for when tho company was floated was placed to credit for the purchaso and erection of machinery and about XC000 luu already been expended. Although tho promoters havo disposed of a large number of their shares, they still stand to loao heavily, and evidently acted in the purchase of the property and In floating tho company in ths beat of faith, and with the utmost confidence in tho value of the mino. Within a few months probably £15,000 of other people's money — Melbourne people's mostly— ha gono to thu bourne horn which few mining investor expect more than the ghost of n return, and of this amount fully XG000 has been ex pended for 100 tons of ore-carrying geld. The diacorcrert sent one of their party to Victoria i and on tbo strength of seme half ton of atone, alleged to have been token from the lode, aomoof thu cutest investors, mining speculators, and others, were induced to go into the concern t not, however, without taking certain precau tions; Thoy communicated with the local authorities, and obtained from the Warden testimony corroborating tbo dis coverers' assertion, aa to the appcamnxe presented. In the meantime the stone exhibited, amounting to about half a ton, was operated on by trustworthy experts, one cf whom the proa pectus suted obtained flSoz to the ton from the outcrop of the lode, another Gloz to tho ton trotu a depth of 15 feet, and a third 1G2oe lOdwt to thu ton, from the greatest depth then reached. The syndicate that bad beon formed im mediately determined to make purchase of the property on tho terms indicated, subject to approval after inspection by representatives to bo selected from mem bers of tho Conference. Two representa tives of tho syndicate went to Kimberley, inspected Jackson's Beef and reported— tho report was appended to the published prospectus—1 4 alter careful and thorough examination" that "It may truly 1m said that thu amazing results obtained havo created confusion In tho mind of every expert whoso treatment of it lias been invited. For ourselves wo may briefly obaurvo that nothing but its actual personal manipulation could havo enabled us to realise tho possibility of tho iuoicitre value of the stono where tho appearance exhibited differed so widely from tho gold hearing rocks of the southern colonic. Tho half ton waacruriicd, andfttid toyioM at tho rate of -Itostothe tuj t'v.» p ir- chase of tho mine was completed, and a temporary mining manager was appointed. Glowing accounts were received from htm. hut, as dividends could not be paid out of reports, tho proprietary sent up a practical : mining manager. Writing on Dec. 11, tho latter says : — " It is my painful duty to inform you that tho mino you sent mo out to manage is likely to provo one of tho most complete failures it hsa been my lot to bo engaged with. Indeed, so much was I disappointed with your prospects after tbo glowing accounts given of it to mo by yonr board, and several shareholders, that I was strongly inclined to return at once to Melbourne." Later on, bo writes " I 1 find, on examination, tliat tho supposed lode on your mine is nothing more nor less than a blow of auriferous ore, containing <msrtv, bluestone, nod ironstone, mixed throughout, a mass of slate, in ail not morothan 4ft In thickness. . . There is now every eido of tho lode running out. No gold boa yet been obtained from the shaft put down." And so this expensive babble burst.
