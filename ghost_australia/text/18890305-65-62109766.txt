Parkes a Political Coward. THE main charges made by Sir Henry Parkes, Ur DIBBS experienced no difficulty in rebutting. He proved especially, that the alleged unconstitutional offences committed by himself had been committed by his accuser in an aggravated form. During the greater part of the time that Mr. DIBBS was speaking Sir Henry was away from the Chamber, and he also walked oat on the following evening whenever he waa being criticised by a member of the Government party. * This has been his practice for two or three years. Some of the papers say that Sir Henry possesses indomitable courage ; but the truth is that he is the greatest coward in the Legislative Assembly. There never lived a politi- cian in Australia who was more afraid of hostile criticism than he. The exclamations when he ran away from Mr. DIBBS' fire on Thursday Â»nd from Mr. CRICK'S on Friday, would have arrested the foot- steps of any man who possessed even the ghost of a courageous spirit ; but the only effect of the exclam- ations was to accelerate his movements.
