THE INDIAN HORSE MARKET. We have been always under the impression that the Australian climate and soil are particularly well adapted for the raising of horse stock But if the system pursued for a long series of years by our readers be the right one, and we are assured that it is thou cert unit there must be something radically w long in our ''oil and climate Instead of nature being fiyoublefor the purpose here, she must be decidedly inimical Our stock has increased exceedingly fast, it had increased in Victoria alone from 47,000 m IboT to 121 000 in 1860, and in similar proportion in the other colonies Side by side with this super abundance in Australia there is a standing market for horses in India alaigeandie regular annual report from many quarters, and more than in that, an urgent demand for fresh sources of supply, yet an occasional ship load at long intervals is our only son of in the trade in face of such a state of things, it is evident that something must be wrong Either natural circumstances no unsuitable, or else the present system of trading must be a mis take Let us hear what the defenders of that system have to say in reference to the Indian market Indian buyers complain that the horses we now send them are generally bad, and that the quality has completely changed and degenerated from what it was twenty years ago in answer to this we are told that a really good article will be supplied if a proper pt tee be paid for it A Veil, one would suppose that £(jo 8.70, and £80 paid in India for good saddle horses ought to suffice to thaw norn Australia any number of hardy useful animals fit for the requirements of the private residents of as remounts for the day play in 1 artillery Such, at least, were the pi tech p m on Bomb by on the last occasion of an unwonted Demand for out com sons but only a very limited supply was fn(booming it those figures Once more there has been another In my demand in the sum pi ice because of the exigencies of the Abyssinian war which, as the Flint, s of India remains, ' is ear] bay Filly one of those companies spoken of by Marshal Saxe in which success depends on logs-not bill of la legs but quadruplets But we see that beyond a couple of ship loads Victoria has been unable to say on behalf of the opening they insist on a good article in India I hey say that our horses don the u exp sure and don t st and the chin to as formerly md as the Cape imports do now, and in reply it is said here offer us a still higher price and we will continue to pick out what will suit roll Now, there is not a country in the world, no matter how ill adapted for her so I using, where an occ istonal good similarity not be got hold of if you offer some extravagant price for him But here with our immense quantity of stock, met with our local of special lilies for it why should good horses be sent co in 1 dear as it seems is the case' With our much huge quantity of stock in these colonies we do not see why plenty of h e 11, spirit! d, serviceable lucks should not be forthcoming as they near the Cape is even so low a figure is from JM I to £18 the prices offered there by the agents of the newly established export companies When Colonel Robbins was in Victoria having for the Imbill run and he paid double those places, and could not got what he wanted to my thing like the required extent, and his dissatisfaction was duly expressed in the Melbourne Press at the time It is impossible to understand all this unrest on the supposition that there is egregious blundering in the bleeding system If that were not wrong, the general ran of our horse stock would be good not bad The good would bear as considerable a proportion to the whole as it notoriously did twenty years ago, and as it still does in the Cape colony, and, our stock being so numerous, good horses would be (abundant and attainable at moderate prices into id of being so nee and den 1 yen the defenders of the present system cannot deny that we have a vast number of mis shapes weedy blues, worth next to nothing and a drug in the market J el us take them to consider since what period this has been the case Every old colonist knows that it was not so before the gold discovery that such equine mon stiosities were then one indeed It has only become the case since the great increase of shipping and of opportunities of import It has only come to pass since the breaking up of our native laced by the. perpetual crossing which has been going on for years with foreign horses bred under opposite natural enemies meet a violent and unscientific proceeding which could be only expected to produce confusion, and which has produced it. It is no wonder, therefore, that we so often hear of horses selling for five shillings or for an old song, and of their being dead at that Nor were we at all surprised to road some time ago, in some of the border new s papers, of preparations for actually boiling down this description of stock the best thing, no doubt, to do with a great deal of it Imagine an establishment for boiling down horses on the coast of Barbary, or in Ai area, or in any other natural horse country but our own? It is a pretty commentary on the shrewdness of our breeders A little more of the present system, and we shall have no alternative but to enter largely into this new branch of the boiling down trade " The system of crossing, ' says Youatt, " requires more judgment and experience than breeders usually possess Judicious or injudicious imports can, and gradually do, affect a country's whole horse stock The same authority points out how every description of horse in England hunts, hackney, coach horse, and even cart horse has been materially influenced by the in troduction of the blood horse, as far back as the time of Queen Anne Here, where we have been importing English horses without pause or respite for sixteen years, it is easy to understand how widely their influence has spread How the system is operating we see, " 1 he horses of the Nedjid," Says a writer in the Spot Time Magazine, "are as even as a flock of sheep" there, to be sure, the horse is used for only one purpose, and his treat ment is uniform also, and no such evenness of good quality is even possible in civilised countries But the principle holds, never theless, that wherever nature is favorable, and are not astra), the stock ought to be generally good, and not merely a percent age of it. There was a time when the Aust lian horse had a very strongly marked and valuable character, and it has not wholly disappeared yet though far more rarely seen than formerly In comparison with this typical Austiahan,theLnglish with all his good qualities is emphatically a soft horse It is nothing to the purpose to tell us that he can beat all competitors on the racecourse or in the hunting field A days hunting 01 speed on the racecourse is not the criterion of endurance to show in what the genuine Australian excels we cannot do better than make a quotation from a letter lately published in the Quitindaiidti, on the comparative merits of the two animals Every bushman can corroborate the writer observations ' Like produces like, ' says the time maxim and we will only add, that our object should be repressive and restore a native laced so vigorous way, and spirited, instead of softening confusing and destroying it by the constant influx of horses from a con- tractor climate. -Melbourne Argus, Oin 1 MiND A wider, in speaking of England as it was two hundred years ago, remarks -"Let us take the lit 11 ty of passing behind a set cm which stands in front of a passage way that leads to the kitchen This, too, is a loom of his age dimensions, limits and flitches of bacon hung from the blackened celling Uno then is not only a fireplace, but a chimney that one opens a whole side of the room Nor is its rapidly at all unsuited to the rtqiuicincnts also culinary operations which go on shore are not on the model of Airs Glasse m M Soyer 1 here are no little stews or economical pOints, of slight dishes for the appetites A small animal, like a sheep is put on the spit whole All ok is cut into pastes, the em class hay has been laid out for that pur- pose on the kitchen table Our I rightly ancestors had the reputation of being the the greatest cars in existence, and there is abundant evidence that then pawns in this respect were not on stated Inlhoyeu leathers was a gun!
