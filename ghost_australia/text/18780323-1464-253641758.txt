OUR AMUSEMENTS. " Have a care of your Entertainments." Theatre Royal, Mr. Darrell's sensation drama, " Back from the Grave " has been l withdrawn in favour of another play by the same author, entitled "Transported for Life." It is excellently put upon the stage, the I Mining scene especially, with canvass town in the back-ground being i very effectively arranged. i Victoria Theatre. Mr. Creswick has been appearing, during the last few evenings, in " William Tell " and " The Stranger," and in each has achieved an undoubted success. Want of space prevents a lengthened notice of his performance in this issue. On Saturday, " Henry VIII." is to be produced, in which Mr. Creswick takes the character of Cardinal ; Wolsey. | The Queens. Kelly and Leon's troupe play to-night for the last time this season. They have had a most successful career, attributable to the very j charming ballad singing of Beaumont Read, the capital lady imper- sonations of W. Leon, and the eccentricities of Messrs. Kelly and | Courtright. | The Guild Hall. Mr. D'Arey Read's Ghost is still to be seen at this Hall every | evening. The illusion is very perfect, and the entertainment well deserving public support. | Rev. Charles Clark. After an absence of nearly two years, the King of Lecturers will make his re-appearance in Sydney, at the Masonic Hall, on Monday next. While he has been away he has exercised the royal prerogative of coining a good lot of money ; and out of his mental mint he has also coiued two or three new lecture-entertainments. Judging by : the enthusiasm with which one of these — " Westminster Abbey " — was received at Newcastle the other night, the new lectures are quite ; as admirable and amusing as their predecessors. On the occasion of ; Mr. Clark's last lecture in Sydney, before he went to America, many ; hundreds of people failed to obtain admission. Next Monday the j disappointed ones can take their revenge. '
