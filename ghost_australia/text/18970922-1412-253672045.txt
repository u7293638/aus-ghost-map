The Fancy Dress Ball. A GAY SCENE. A very enjoyable evening was spent last Thursday in the Bijou Theatre, when a fancy dress ball was held under the auspices of the Esperance Assembly, and no little credit is due to the secretary (Mr. Frank Black) for his indefatigable labors in bringing matters to a successful issue. The theatre had been tastefully decorated with flags, and the band placed in one corner of the auditorium in order to leave the stage free for those who did not dance. About forty couples were present, and the gallery was crowded with spectators, the whole scene being of a most brilliant description. All the members of the Parliamentary party were present, special invitations having been given to them, with permission to join in the terpsichorean festival alt,hough not iu fancy dress, and we are pleased to say that no feature of their visit was more heartily appreciated than this entertainment. The highest commendation is due to the ladies who, on such comparatively short notice, had prepared such elegant and varied costumes. Where so many excellent costumes were in evidence it was very difficult to give the palm to any one lady, but a committee of nine gentlemen, upon whom devolved the delicate task of selecting the " best-sustained character " amongst the fair sex, awarded the palui to Miss McCarthy, who represented a " Highland Lassie." We may state, however, that so great was the diversity of opinion ou this matter that no less than six ladies secured votes in this informal competition, the prize being a box of gloves. TIM ESPERANCE TIMES was well represented by Miss Johnston, whose elegant dress was completely covered with an impression of our anniversary number. We must not omit to make special mention of the comic element, well sustained by two ibony gentlemen, also Mr. F. lliindle ns a scarecrow, and Messrs. C. B. Ilarston and 11. Fort as clowns, the antics of the three latter creating no small amount of diversion during the evening. Another source of much amusement and speculation as to identity was the ghost impersonation by Miss Carmen. We append a list of the characters represented :â€” Mrs. Bostock, Night.
