"THE BATTLE OF HYDE PARK"--A SECOND FRAGMENT. BY THE GHOST OF MACAULAY. Alas! for Charley Cowper Who wrought the deed of wrong; With haggard face and stealthy pace He shirks the madd'ning throng. Men say he sees strange visions Which he alone may see; And that strange sounds are in his ears, Which none may hear but he. John Hubert lank and ghastly, With night-cap on his head, All through the watches of the night, Writes letters by bis bed: And as he plies the goose-quill, In a hoarse voice and low, He croons of hostile "houses" That shall work Charles Cowper woe Of sympathetic "meetings," Of Camden's champion squire, Of "honest" Ryan's splutterings, Of Fowler's h-less ire; Of Saintly F---f-x's libels, Of the Parson's hireling spite, Of sober 'Possum,--brothers sworn To do John Hubert right; Of patriot shouts from verdant Wilds, Of Squatters' patriot gold, That shall bring John Hubert back to power, And the red-tape days of old. So mutters and so writes he Until the East is grey;-- Then points to an official scroll, And yells, and flees away.
