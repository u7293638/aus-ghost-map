LORD MAYOR'S DAY IN LONDON. (FOOT BB FACIAL, COMMÏèS:ONi.H.) LONDON, Nov. 14. The Australian who when doing the world does not spend a November in London misses many very interesting experiences His idea regarding fogs, grey, yellow, brown, and black will be of a limited kind He will not properly understand England's climate nor know how it is possible to jam 12 distinct changes of weather into one week-a glimpse of blue sky in the morning, a fog at lunch-time, and a storm with rain for supper seasoning What is much more important, he will miss the Lord Mayor's show and its most enviable opportunity of seeing a London crowd Fortified with the knowledge that the great day had at length arrived, armed with an umbrella, and rendered sleet- proof by Overcoatings and wraps, on last Saturday your representative sallied forth to make a unit of the crowd It was a disagreeable morning, misty, grey, dull, and dis- spiriting, but suburban London was true to its duties House after house poured forth its contents Trains and 'buses were crammed, and if there was any feature of the morning more remarkable than the weather it was the good humour which seemed to pervade the struggling masses which were hurrying towards London centre In all streets close to the line intended for the great procession wheeled frame was completely suspended Instead of 'buses, waggons, and cabs, there were from side to side great armies of pedestrians A fair proportion of great London's five million inhabitants were determined to see the Right Hon Sir Walter Wilkin enter in state to his Mayoral duties, and when Londoners mean to perform a time-honoured duty it takes more than bad weather to keep them off the tracks But is London a great city The curiosity of the tourist whose special mission is to know all about everything, everybody, and every place, may, to a certain extent, be satisfied regarding the magnitude of London and its suburbs by three trips. He can start from Ilford, which is due east from the city's centre and distant from it nine miles, and go straight through in a westerly direction Stratford, Bow, Mile End, Whitechapel, Aldgate, Cornhill, Cheap- side, Newgate-street, Holborn, Oxford street, Bayswater, Hamersmith, Brentford, and Hounslow, a distance of 20 miles Then for a pleasanter variation he may go north to Enfield, which is from London's centre about 10 miles, and from that point travel in a southerly direction through Enfield, Southgate, Hornsey, Crouch Hill, Finsbury Park, Islington, over the Thames at Blackfriars Bridge, along the Borough-road to the Elephant and Castle, along Kensington-road past the celebrated cricket centre The Oval, through Loughboro', Brixton, Clapham, Norbury, Thornton Heath, and Croydon, a distance of 20 miles After these two interesting journeys Mr Tourist may have a third excursion across London from the north east to south-west from Loughton to Woking, a delightful walk say of about 40 miles This is why the travelling Londoner speaks of his home at " that little village called London " As a matter of fact the " village " is now as if several cities were gradually tacked one on to the other For more than one half of the distances mentioned in the three journeyings of investigation will be through streets which are lined with shops and other places where business of some kind is transacted, while the other half will be past terraces of dwelling-houses and substantial and well-adorned suburban villas Suburban London is charming , better still it is clean The systems of drainage are perfect, the roads, streets, and footpaths almost as good at the furthermost points as in the city's centre There is no niggardliness in the disbursements of the municipal institutions The rates are heavy, but those who pay them know and feel that they are enjoying substantial benefits When a new suburb is found to be necessary drainage, roads, footpaths, goal, and water go simultaneously with the erection of the houses I could name a city in which suburban progression is not so well ordered where the evil odours of suburban surface-drama have for years polluted what should be if properly treated the purest and most health-giving atmosphere of this great globe The Londoner respects his Mayors and aldermen, and pays up his rates and taxes like a man, but I know some parts of the world where the mere mention of a road rate suffices to make property-holders feverish Once again to the Lord Mayor's Show of 1895 There happened one of the most unexpected of changes The nearer the crowds got to the respective vantage points the better became the weather Actually before noon the sun was visible The order of the day was " The procession will start from the Guildhall, at 12 o'clock noon, and proceed along Gresham-street, Princes-street, Mansion House, Cornhill, Leadenhall-street, St Mary Axe, Houndsditch, Aldgate, Leadenhall street, Cornhill, Mansion House, Poultry, Cheap side, St Paul's Churchyard, Ludgate Hill, Fleet street to the Royal Courts of Justice, returning by way of Strand, Northumberland-avenue, Victoria Embankment, Queen Victoria street, Queen street, King-street, to the Guildhall " On ordinary days one might stroll over this route in less than 90 minutes, but it took the procession about five hours to accomplish the task Many parts of the journey were under festoons of flowers and through triumphal arches Each window had its occupants, and the shops which had their shutters down placed temporary frames of solid planking before their glass fronts Policemen on foot and mounted were everywhere Each range of steps and each doorway had its crowd, and each lamp-post had its cluster of small boys My position was in the crowd's centre, near the Mansion House, in the great space before which there was a solid mass of patient humanity that now and then would sarge backwards and forwards as the waves of a well tempered sea My earliest impressions were that what would be left of me before the procession arrived might be readily rolled like a piece of cloth and returned by parcel post to Sydney But like the eels and the skinning, one became accustomed to even hydraulic pressure at times, and like others I commenced to use my elbows and enjoy the fun Lose anything, your watch hat, or umbrella, but don't lose your temper in a London crowd I kept mine despite the fact that sometimes I was politely requested to " let some- one stand on my hat," " to keep my hair on," and asked " if I intended to grow any more " A mild expostulation would bring the free explanation that it was wrong to " annoy the gent Don't you know who that is It's the Lord Mayor " Yet in this crowd there were well dressed women folk, some with babies, and of fathers with children on their shoulders, supporting their offspring in the true sense of the word, there were thousands Outside the pages of the crowd, in good positions, there were parties of ambulance nurses and their assistants, all ready with handcarts and larger vehicles to move wounded or crushed folk The duties of these nurses were not heavy They looked as modern nurses usually strive to do, as charming as possible, and did a fair share of flirting The latter part of the work would be occasionally interrupted by the call for attention to some of the female crowd who had fainted, but the day was devoid of any serious results The procession was grander, better ordered, and better dressed than the usual run of Mayor's shows Taken as a whole the dressing was magnificent, and the music grandly imposing While one of the crowd I did not see much, but some hours later, when I had a good position in one of the windows of the Sydney Morning Herald's London Branch, 78 Queen Victoria-street, the special features of the show went well under observation It was not a very lengthy procession, and took no more than 17 minutes to pass the Herald Office, a great width of street having given opportunities for good speed. About 10 trade companies were represented by mounted men, banners, and carriages. The great triumphal car which bore the trophy of the Fruiterer's Company was a most attractive portion The artillery, with what is said to be the best mounted band in England, detachments of the crook Cavalry Regi- ment of Hussars, the gorgeously attired State band of the Royal Horse Guards with costs covered with gold embroidery, and wearing black velvet huntsman caps The cars bearing trophies representing Africa and India, and last but not least the great State chariot of the city, were one and all sights which could not be soon for- gotten Of firemen there were hundreds, and of steam fire engines several Mayors of the olden time, from Whittington's days to those of George III, passed as so many ghosts of former shows Men in real armour, not the ordinary theatrical tin plate, kept their places and tried hard to make it appear that their iron units were of a comfort able kind Footmen and coachmen displayed liveries, the- cost of which probably would be too much to mention, and the Lord Mayor and sheriffs kept on smiling with that grimness which five hours of journey is likely to provoke There were the Gordon Boys in kilts, there over bagpipes, Bailors dad as the sea-dogs used to be in Nelson's day, and modern cars as represented by the boys of the training ship Warspite Africa was strongly boomed by its car, which bore enough gold, or what seemed to be gold, to float hundreds of duffer mines, and as everyone said that the show was a success it would be a bold action on the part of any journalist to chronicle it as having displayed even the smallest decree of the theatrical element
