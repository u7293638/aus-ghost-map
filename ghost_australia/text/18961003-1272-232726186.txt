I vas much impressed with tMslstory, and it struck me my long friend knew more about the stealing of the Duke Of Athol than be cared to tell. The sequel of this story came a few tteeks after.

When I catches sight of"the Duke, sometimes it's over this way, sometimes it's 40 miles away towards Eulo, I gammons to go to Cuiinamulla now and then for a spree, but I don't until I have a try to get the Duke.
