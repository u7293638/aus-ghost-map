A Trip Round Dederang. [Communicated.] Come with me old chum and we'll ride down the trail And peep at our friends in the Dederang Vale ; . The first that we come to is Mrs Bill Smith, In her nice little home and all the wherewith; Now over the green wattle creek we must go, And up through the paddock and visit old Joe ; With his plump spritely wife, and his family so big, Who are always so happy, and can dance a wee gig; Now again we cross over and call on Mick Bourke, Where his wife is feeding turkeys, and Mick's hard at work ; The next we will call on is Smith of the Glen, And hear all the news of the horses, cattle, and men ; Now trot over the bridge, then peep in at the school, And see how the wee children submit to the rule ; Then back to the right there lives Mrs Binnie, With a house full of babies, I can't tell how many; The next that we come to is old Arter aud Sons, Who are all fond of horses, their dogs, and their guns ; Now on the bank of the creek stands Haig's Roller Mills, Where they grind all the flour that runs up long bills ; Next come tlie miller and his dear little wife, But they never chase mice with a big carving knife ; Here the next on our way is old Archie, the bold, Who is trying his fortune at digging for gold ; And just round the hill lives old Archie's daughter, Somewhat out of the way, but near the good water ; Now through the red cutting till we come to George Briggs, Who owns lots of cattle, sheep, poultry and pigs ; That is the bridge where they say dwells the ghost. And if we should meet him we will give him a toast ; Next we come to Ivers in his pretty clean white nest, Whose wife is one of the kindest and one of the best ; I think that Mick must be the last that we can see to-day, For time is flying very fast and we must haste away.
