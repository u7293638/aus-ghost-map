"I : suppose," I said, "that you don't know all that was m it?". "Nat I. lAlil 1 know ls that 'there were a lot of papers and things- iprlnolpally receiipted bills, I fancy, for the things in old Ben's collection." If that were so, then they were gone. I emptied the contents of the drawer out upon the writing table.; "There are no bills here now." "No. That's doosed .odd. Look again. I'll swear. that the drawer was half-full of them." I did look again. We both of us looked. We looked everywhere^ turning out the other drawers as well. There was not a trace of anything of the kind to be seen. "It strikes me, Mr. Clinton, that if you had drunk a little less, or kept your presence of mind a little more, you would have seen very gnod cause for handing over your uncle's 'ghost' to the tender custody of the police." When he perceived that there was not so much as a vestige of a bill remaining, he seemed him self to realise that there might be something in what I said. "But what on earth could Ryan, or anyone, want with a lot of old, paid bills?" "Ah-what?" I wondered, without imparting my wonder to Mr. : Clinton, , if Ryan, or anyone, would have liked, to have had Phillp-Bennion's diary as well.
