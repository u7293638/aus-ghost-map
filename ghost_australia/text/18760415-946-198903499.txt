He says it is sadtothink of such a vast; amount of knowledge! being stored up .in so many varied quarters, and not as^ practically available as it seemstha't it'tnight be arid should be 'naaiJe.

The'News .ITkom, ''England.— Oar cable mossage ; in : another ; column contains- some interesting : news 'from England, the'mpsfc important items being connected ^ith the war -between 1 the 'Egyptiansiand' the rAlbys- sinians. ,Ourcorrespondent telegraphs that '?it is hoped. 'peace will be restored, as the Bussian General, .Von Kaufman, has under taken the organisation of the Egyptian army.' That is precisely. the reason ,we should infer why no 'peace' in that part of the world might be hoped for, but we trust we may be mistaken. Mr Disraeli did not call tho atten tion of Parliament to the position of a Russian force close to the frontiers of British India without reason. It is very dear . that ; General Von Kaufman, with. his golden sword— «,for the defeat of the Kho kanders' — has not .undertaken the organi sation of the Egyptian army with a view to peace. The army and navy estimates for the .year have -been increased by half a million sterling, each. This is not a peaceful symptom either. The other items of home newsarehot of much importance.
