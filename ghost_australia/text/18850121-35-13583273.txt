interesting occurrences in rela- tion to Methodism during my Mar of i lib o now closed are the General Conference in New Zealand, and the revived interest in the subject of religious man union In Public schools On these and other subjects I ask to be allowed to certain own judgment us I for it from my own stand- point without intending in any way to commit this Conference to my utterances 2 I think I may not, how ever on behalf of my brethren who attended the General Conference at Christchurch that we are glad to have been present there, and that we are satisfied with the decisions of the Conference, especially on such important questions as the m [m m m of the New Zealand Conference, the union with the other Methodist Churches and the pacifi- cation of long 1 cannot doubt that God did in arms or to many a protest prayers guide us to the conclusions which for the time are the best We were impressed with the vitality and strength of Wesleyan Method diNin in New Zealand, and with the ability and energy of its representatives in the Conference, but rev brethren here will please to correct me brief ter if I am mistaken, I am I certain) carried away the thought that before the Coal French closed there was no ten ardent wish among the laity of New Ze land Methodism either for speed) tot ata tion from the Australasian Conference's, or for the construction of a new Methodism in order to incorporate elements which do not clearly appear to bohomogtnoou» disease To mark the symphonic which indicate a necessity of coalescence between public bodies whether in Church or State Whether these symptoms exist in this case the annual Conference will have hereafter to determine I should be very sorry to survive a Luton of Methodist Churches which would resemble the combination of an acid and its alkali which results in badly cxlfcrvesonco followed by insipid and intolerable stagnation is the arrival among us of a Bishop of Sydney), who is earnest and able enough to in use his influence felt far be) ord his own Church, and is large-hearted enough to desire to draw other churches with him in his noble ambitions, has come to us as a glad surprise The Bishop has Minion with no small force and persistence on the question of religious instruction in Public schools as a question intimately connected with the Christian w ell-be my of even home throughout the colony interests are concerned hero which overflowed Church organisations, and spread themselves far and widening the people During the New Zealand Conference, I had opportunities of conversation with ministers and laymen from the other colonies, and I found them all concerned about the difficulties surrounding the question of religious instruction in their Public schools, and all earnestly longing for even a portion of the privileges which are secured to us by Act of Parliament In the course of discussion on this) subject there has been some variance of opinion as to the meaning of the terms in the 7th clause of the Act for Public Instruction viz -' In all schools under this Act the teaching shall be strictly) non sectarian but the words ' secular instruction ' shall be held to include general religion!, of aching as distinguished from dogmatical or polemical theology ' What then, does the law intend by non sectarian teaching or non dogmas theology " The answer is to be found Surely in the text box as which the same authority has sanctioned and pro \ ided. 1 take up then the four small volumes of Scripture lessons, with their questions and notes, which we have recently ascertained teachers are bound to use in the Public schools of the colony, and are not allowed to omit them, exempting only the 10 scholars whose parents object, as they have a right to object, to their children being so taught I find, then, that the law prox ides a rich and various feast of what it calls non-sectarian and non dogmatic relie, out instruction of such loss in the following -The Ilium authority) of the Old Testament in general and of Messianic prophet v in particular the best rich character of the Mosaic account of the Creation, of the fall, and of the early history of the world, including the Deluge of Noah a day, and its typical lesson as foreshadowing the destruction of the world by air ; the personality of the Devil the reality of miracles in the Old and, New 1 estimate the Morne

former the law was written on tables of stone and announced to the Israelites as a rule of conduct by the latter it is written on the heart as a a living, principle the former was a ministra turn of

and Protestants, the reality of the trac»tlt,ura tion of our Lord, His divine power in casting out deacons, that He encouraged perseverance in prayers assuring the petitioner success, that He spoke of

thus declare de* It will greatly add to the torments of the wicked to remember that they had neglected or made a bad use of their advantages ' the power of faith is declared also-that the early Christians escaped the miseries of the siege of Jerusalem through remembering how Christ forewarned them of the exact time for escape These backs also not only teach in the very words of Scripture but comment upon and ask points of questions on such events as the descent of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost, the origin of the Christian Church, the miraculous c aversions Saul of Tarsus they explain the meaning of words so perplexing tocbtldronos these " as many as were ordained to eternal life believed " the time of this ignorance God winked at." these lesson books employ as genuine records the Apostolic Epistles quoting at least eight out of the 11 Epistles of St Paul, and speaking of him as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews They also teach from the Gospels that the destruction of Jerusalem was a type or figure of the day of udgmont " that the Passover Lamb was a type of Christ, and relate how He instituted the Lord's Supper that our Lord claimed to be the Son of God at His trial, and that the Jews changed the charge from blasphemy to sedition when they brought Him before the Roman governor that prophecy was fulfilled in his crucifixion the result) of our Lord's resurrection, and that after He was rison He proved the necessity of his resurrection from the Old Testament scriptures and thin copious and almost matchless series of Son pt are lessons, courting this non- sectarian teaching and non dogmatical theology as understood by the highest legal authorities, is introduced with the following words " Those selections are offered not as a substitute for the altered volume itself, but as an introduction to it, and they have been compiled in the hope of their leading to a more general and more profitable perusal of the Word of God " " the Commissioners for those extracts from Scripture to the careful attention of teachers and children, not only as a truth, but as a truth recorded under the influence of inspiration and truth with which it le of the utmost importance for them to be well acquainted ' Now, I think most of us will say at once, if these and their kindred topics in the Scripture lesson books are now dogmatical and non sectarian, so long as we get these lessons for the instruction of our children, we do not much care it the) never hear anything all their lives about what is dogmatical and sectarian Here is surely the very) living substance of the truth out of which Christian faith grows and which all Christians dearly loved But then I have heard it said, though the lessons are good, are not man of the teachers irreligious or sceptics), or ruches have no sympathy with the sacred lessons they are bound to give-' him able to say, on the authority of a minister who is more familiar with the temper of the teachers in our Public schools in this city) than poihapsanvonctlie, that a majority of them are not only six cere and reverent in teaching the prescribed Scripture lessons, but are cordial fellow-workers with those who visit the Public schools to give religious instruction under the provisions of the 17th clause But supposing it were not so and that the noble series of lessons given under the 10th clause was occasionally qualified by suggested doubts and undisguised sneers on the part of the teacher, yot 1 affirm there is a weight and beauty in the bored Word that was never yet hindered from benefiting the rumor) that held it, even though a hostile or reluctant teacher conveyed the sacred lesson Elijah's dinner was not spoiled though his prov thorn wore Agnostic ravens who led the prophet, but did not believe in him These w ord Are seeds that will produce their legitimate fruit, no matter who sows them And nothing surer) canbeworte than that any child's entire education should proceed in a schoolroom as utterly blank and barron of Christian influence as a dcBort is of fruit or flowers It is always easy to die in a desert, but very difficult to live there And it there is a danger that the series of religious lessons prescribe to he teachers may not have justice done to them, there is surely the greater need that the Church should in some way supply possible deficiency and guard possible danger by maintaining the religious teaching provide under the 17th clause But I know it is Bau!, and said with good mason, by many of our ministers, that they have no time to do any thing like justice to five or six of more Public schools in their on cults some of them large and some of them a uttered far from each city r I hope this Conference will determine both the religious instruction shall be given as far as possible in all Public schools where there are children of Wesleyan parents, and that they will make Misoial provision to assist the ministers in their work It would bear excellent thing to a point one of our younger ministers, ur n ([distilled and -used', to take charge of the work, cooperating with the linniHtora in their circuits, organising

The relation of the Sunday School to public worship opens many perplexing questions I am told that the ss parate service system in America for Sabbath schools is not an entire success, for the school in which they have left school, in many instances are insured by their absence from the house of God They are trained from the Church instead of to it. But if it is bitter that the elder scholars, at least in Sunday schools, should join in the service of the sanctuary, ought we not to rain limber their presence and adapt our services a little more to their needs i Where there is Sunday-school in the morning for at least an hour and the children with scarcely a quarter of an hour's interval are taken into the Church for public worship to be detained there nearly two hours increases there not something wrong here? Physiology, common sense, and religion are all alike offended by such an childlike constraint And why should not this Conference consider the question of adaptation in our public services generally P Have we learnt nothing by the experience of a century and a quarter 1 In fact in particular con- gregations alterations have already begun In one church 1 find the ps time read in alternate verses by number and people in another an unto me in sung during the election in another the prayer is divided into three portions and a printed form is placed in the pews to and the worshippers in the new modelled service 1 convey my sympathy is with most of these changes the Conference ought not to ignore them If it does ignore them alteration will follow alleviation, and or public worship will become to a stranger an incomprehensible tangle I hope this Conference will at least appoint a committee to consider this important matter, and to prepare a report 1 bore is one other topic which wine needs our consideration, and that is the expansion of ov egotistic work by our own talents and in our own way the Salvation Army has hewn out for itself a DOW path, and while it pur- sued its noble workers excavating souls for Christ out of the great outfield of ungodliness and vice, and keeps door of proselyting, especially in small places, it merits from us sympathy and words of good cheer bore saying the greatest work to be done on this oil the God bless abun- dant! v all who can do it 1 yatie.clistio work has always been the most productive field of Methodism It has given us more genius for our leaders and more life for our workers than all other methods put together But let us remember too that boots can be say ed without the din that " Henery with tremendous sound your ears asunder With gun, drum, trumpet blunderbuss and murder Our missionary sun ices in this church have been a new and a wise departure from old routine, and I look forward with joyous hope to the possibility of a new York Street, where not only a great variety of melinda will be possible and great success will to given by our Master, but where our theological students may catch, and carry away many a bro take that will help to worry and radiate dull y Elligott and tippling townships fir HW as in the Australian wilderness We want every kind of talent con- secrated to the sere ice of CUring l(,rud(0 to the devil not only every eloquent speaker, every willy intellect, every humourist, oury scholar, but every sweet voice, every fair face, every loving heart I of the day to take his own if he must, but 1 j protest that the bright young face in our boronia the scholars in our sick oils the worshippers in our tanotuuricB, do not in any once told, to him We need a revival of the conservative work of the Church which will secure and keep our own children, quite as our line we need revival of the ov linguistic ardour win it a century and a half ago thrust out Overs Maidens >s will in converted pageantry and prizefighters lo Iianiiuiu Mount, to Owen nap Pit or Bartholomew full", but m, - ' Uatessts of men to you Iel, It Trio s and pub) calls and the rev " Old Methodism had quite other elements than these as a framework within which it got the gems which its leaders field preachers recovered from the human, di stationers of cities, and towns, and village s all over Great Britian J is great missionary and other constructive enterprises of Wesley and his successors needed men of education, of great administrative of gifts and business tact to murder. them.
