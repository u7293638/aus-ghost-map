THE WIND THROUGH THE KEYHOLE. Hark to the low wind sighing, So sad, so bleak, so cold; It comes like the voice of a wailing ghost, Full of misery untold. It tells ot endless sorrow. Of fire and parting wreck, And ot the bare rope pressing Bound a choking creature’s neck. It comes trom storm-swept, raging seas, And from the wild morass; From wandering round the ruined towers In many a dangerous pass. From whistling against prison bars, And over miles of snow, Where the dying mother and her child Crouch to the Cossack’s blow. From long forgotten battle-fields. Where the grass grows coarse and rank; From the yeasty breakers frothing Against the shoal's sunk bank; From forests madly tossing Before the shattering storm; From moors where, on the gibbet. The body stills bangs warm. Come, children, then together. And pray for drowning men. For suffering creatures floating faint On wreck far from our ken. Pray for ail human sorrow. For all who suffer now By sword or storm, by sea or land, In this our world below.
