MINING. Since our last summary there has been an altera- tion in the method of transmitting gold to tbe sea- board, and ti e escort returns no longer reflect the true position of the gold fields as to the yield of the precious metal. Until nov we have, in common wita other gold fields, been able to use tb* returns furnished by the government escort officers as at least approximate statements of the actual amount of gold produced, for although there never has been a time when tbe whole of our yields has been sent by escort, the great bulk of gold was confided to the care of the escort, and as the custom was the same on all the gold fields, the returns thus obtained served for the purposes of comparison or contrast. Now, however, the banks and other large purchasers of gold transmit by private methods for the most part, and the small quantities taken by escort are only the ghosts of the substantial produce of our several fields. Several causes have led to this result, the main ones being the want of agreement between the gold buyers and the government as to allowances for tare and for rebate of duty after th« crude metal has been assayed, and the reduction of the export duty next mofftb. The opening of railway communica- tion between the gold fields and Melbourne hsj also led to a greater independence of thc government escort, as a safe and rapid means of transit is now available for everybody. This being the state of facts as to our gold returns, aud thc banks and other buyers having neglected to supply the returns now required'to supplement those given by the escort authorities, we are unable to furnish our usual monthly table of the gold yield of the district. It is to be hoped, however, that some means will be found of arriving at this important information, for. in the absence of reliable statistics of this nature it I is difficult, if not impossible, to guage the amount of i progress we are making as a gold producing com- munity. That we are not retrograding is at the same time pretty certain, for, in the price of snares in our large claims, we have a tolerably satisfactory indication of the actual value of mining property, a value which is determined solely by the actual or all I but actual yield of gold. Sometimes, it is trae, a little unhealthy speculation arises, but the duration of the malady, especially in relation to dividend j ¡ paying claims, is brief, and affairs rapidly right themselves. A few days ago an unwonted excite- ment was visible in the Bhare market That portion of the south side of Sturt street dedicated to share dealers and known as 'Change, was all day lon? in a I perfect hubbub of money making excitement which lasted from early morning till past the orthodox hour for closing brokers' business. All the well known speculators, including bankers, miners proper, and money lenders, as well as many others not so well known, were clustering in busy knots or scud- ding about from point to point, and the excited con j venation and flashed faces betokened .that more than j omul was opon the carpet The canse of the un- wonted animation was the reçoit luck of the Great Republic Company in the striking of the new lead we reported a short time since and which is turning out surprisingly rich. The wash dirt is from nine to ten feet deep, and the gold is the heaviest ever seen in this notable gold field. Such at least is the verdict given to us by. some of our oldest minen, m]iá¡t»Ü!^^t^áMtaM-mx rhett cxistimr dabas. I?ÎBwnJjra'|ra ore day last irj^SSS orara on ti» Wlflnie rfj&TO-liM;'hnPii »atoni«l.iTig Shares, which tlie week before coola1 widi difihailty be mored off at .£180, aiejtbw worth £1100, anä it is sall that not less than £10,000 changed bands in one day upon -Change. This lively tone is not confined to Kepub lic ahares either, albeit the advance in value on other scrip has not been anything like co marked. Albion and Nelson shares are now worth £1800, and Great Extended are quoted at from £2650 to £2700. Signs of a new ron are reported in tue latter company's claim, bot further exploration is necessary to establish the fact assumed. Working Miners' shares are quoted at Ugh rates also,and the fact is the more noteworthy in reference to this company and the Albion Company, inasmuch as neither company are yet in gold. The Cosmo- politan Company's claim is still keeping ita rank amongst the very best on Ballarat We are informed that a short time ago X20O0 were offered for a share and a quarter in this company, sud £700 for a work- ing half share. The Royal Saxons, Koh-i Noor, Cosmopolitan, Hill, Prince of Wales, and Borne others are also maintaining splendid positions in the share, market, as large dividend paying claims or claim with certain value in the immediate future. One of our oldest and most intelligent miners sends na the following estimate of the value of mining in- terest» in the Ballarat proper and suburban portions of this goldfield: Ko. of Claims. Shares. Prices. Amount. Extended.

I am not sure of the number of shares in the Mill Co. £843,600 divided among 625 shareholders will give in round numbers about £1356 per share. Leaving oat the non-dividing claims, we have 448 shareholders receiving dividends on an average from £10 to £100 per fortnight, so that there are 448 miners doing well on Ballarat at present in the deep alluvial claims. If we add to this .the Essex and Band of Hope companies, besides other claims, it will be seen that the value of less than 20 claims on Ballarat is a million sterling. The value of the claims of the co-operative companies is . £843,600 To which may be added the following not co-operative : Claims. Shares. Price. Essex. 230 £40 9,200 Band of Hope. 1,600 30 48,000 £900,800 There are other chums, the Defiance, New French- man's, Wheatsheaf, &c;, which ought to be included in the above list to make it complete. The above, although, as oar correspondent states, only an approximate estimate, is near enough to the truth to show the importance of the mining interests of the district. In some of his quotations our cor- respondent is inaccurate. The Extended shares are too high, for instance, and the Koli-i- Noor shares too low, actual recent sales showing the average of the two claims to be £2600. A similar remark will apply to the Working Miners and one or two others, but, as has been already stated, as an approximate sketch, the results are nearly enough accurate for the purpose of indicating the rough aggregate value of mining properly in the alluvial department only. It would be within the mark, perhaps, if we estimated the total value of alluvial property within the area indicated by the above sketch-that is all the claims on the raining grounds touched upon by our correspondent, at a million and a quarter sterling. So that if we add the alluvial interests of the other portions of the district, as the Durham, Smythesdale, Brown's, Lin- ton, Carngham, Lucky Woman», Creswick, and Bald Hills, and other outlying places of minor im- portance, we may calculate on a- total value of not less than, two millions sterling (£2,000,000). To this has to be added the value of our quartz mines and their plants, and if we value them at half as much as the alluvial claims and plants we shall not be very far from the mark. Thus we arrive at a rough aggregate of threemillionssterling(£3,000,000). as the value of mining property in the district. And this estimate is not a fancy one, but for this most part an estimate of the actual market value of the property deducible from actual transactions in the major part of the claims. The Royal Saxon Company's claim, on the In- kermann and National leads, is and has been for some time past one of our best paying ones. By a return of the yield of the claim for the last two months, furnished to us by one of the company, we j find that from the week ending 5th April to the week ending 31st May the company obtained 1943 oz 12dwt of gold, and paid £180 per share in divi- dends. The yields were for the weeks ending 5th April, lil oz 1 dwt ; 12th April, 211 oz 7dwt ; 19th April, 221 oz5dwt; 26thAprU, 183oz 15dwt 12gr; 3rd May, 173 oz 13 dwt 12 gr ; 10th May, 249 oz ll dwt ; 17th May, 154oz 8dwt ; 24th May, 285 oz 5dwt; 31st May, 353oz 6dwt. The dividends were-5th April, £10 ; 19th April, £40 ; 3rd May, £30 ; 17th May, £40 ; 8 Ut May, £60. There are 40 shares in the company, three of which are thc joint propertytof the company, the dividends on the three shares defraying the greater part of the ex penses of the mine. It will be seen by the above returns that the company are now raising some capital washdirt, and we understand there is a pretty good area of ground yet to work, from which the company reckon on obtaining returns equal to the average of those already cited. The value of the company's scrip in the market is a tolerably safe criterion of the real value of thc mine, and quota- tions at £1200 show that the claim is in the first rank of well paying properties. As a comparison with the foregoing, we may cite the luck of the Windsor Company of puddlers in Pennyweight Gully, whose operations are limited to wishing the surface, or from the surface to a depth of from 4 or 5 to 10 or 12 feet. The company have been working some four years in a quiet humdrum fashion, but with excellent resulta. The expenses of the company average about £10 a week, including thc wages of two hired men, and a regular weekly donation of 5s to the Hospital. Beckoning the company to have been working 219 weeks, we find their expenses at £10 per week would be £2190, which, deducted from £10,000, the rough value of the gold leaves £976 per man clear, or bard upon the pleasantly sounding sum of " a thousand a man." Although the gold obtained is not worth quite £10,000, the aggregate dividend per man will not be much if at all under the sum we have quoted, for daring the four years in which the company have been working they have been compulsorily idle for several weeks, during which of course no expenses were incurred. We give still another phase of gold fields experiences, as showing the vicissitudes of a miner s me, ana now me poor man 01 one aa; is las rich man of the next. A man named Simon Grant has been prospecting for the last eight weeks in a gully knowu as Middle Gully, near the top of the Inkermann Lead. He continued to prospect this ground, in spite of the hardship* he had to undergo, as for many weeks his earnings did not exceed -two or three shillings, and one week they reached the magnificent sum of eighteenpence. On this income -he had to Bupport a wife and, we believe, three chil- dren; and, to show that there was no idling, we may j mentiou that his wife has assisted in working the claim. As we have said, Grant worked for eight weeks for almost nothing; but on Friday week his fortune changed, and he strack a sort of quartz lode, mixed with cement, at a depth of 16 feet, which he found to be highly auriferous. In a few hours he had obtained, with the assistance of his wife and son, no less than £170 worth of gold, with a very fair prospect of getting a large quantity more. The lucky prospector, wbo visited our office accom- panied by his wife, showed us two fine specimens, one weighing 33 ozs 14 dwts, apparently gold and cement, and another weighing 8 oz 6 dwt, con- sisting of gold and quartz. Grant thinks*' that he has struck a continuation of ooe of the Black Hill quartz lodes, and since the news of the discovery got abroad a rush has taken place to the locality, and several claims have been marked out. The New Waterloo Company, near the Wesleyan reserve, Lydiard and Albert streets, have struck a gutter running from the Clydesdale Company's claim underneath the Gaol and Courthouse reserve. This ran is a good deal shallower than the Golden Point Lead, and, according to the course it appears to be taking, it is likely to ¡oin the main gutter near the Welsh Church reserve. Clark and party, the prospectors for a supposed new lead at the Springs, have got through the rock at 70 feet, and have slabbed Hp. They will resume sinking at once. A collision between the Leviathan Company and some occupation license holders in the neighborhood of Dogtrap Creek has taken place. The latter hare taken np allotments within the boundaries of the company, and are now taking steps to secure eighty acre sections. To prevent this the company have made np their minds to memorialise the Government or send a deputation to the Board of Lands and Survey, praying that the issue of Crown grants may he stopped. What would be the effect of a collision between the holdings under the Crown grant and the miner's right is somewhat hard to teU. The miner holds except as against the Crown, but the Crown could hardly seek to recover possession except for a public good. To dispossess a company of minen for an individual squatter or farmer seems hardly reconcilable with equity or public policy. To add to the detagrement of the companies there, ano- ther interference with their interests is threatened by the Alston and Weardale Company, who are applying to be registered for. the Cobbler's, French- man's, and other leads supposed to be going down south. This registration has been omitted by the former company, and if the latter obtain what they seek Ute effect will be to render them all tenants in OKianotú À growing interest attaches-ipall the cîaiiffllnljiÉijilher^^ gains ground that the great trank lead of Ballarat bas ita coorie. eonthwaróVsad any gening ap of litigation there will be watched with eager eyes hy those who are. mivlitj.tmg ipTOrtmpñtai în th¿t lnnafoy. \- In quarts-mining there is nothing new to report of any moment. Several of the chums that vere left idle hy the disorganisation brought about by the New Zealand rash have been re-occupied sod are bidding fair to repay the new adventurers. The : Black Hill Company «till estimate the cost of raising and crushing at 6s 6d per ton, Including the wages of ninety men, the number employed in the month of May. The company are now building a furnace for smelting iron for the manufacture of their owe stamp heads. By this means the company reckon upon securing better metal and also effecting a saving of. £500 a year. This calculation, and the fact that 18 cwt. of iron a week represents the consumption for the purpose stated, indicate the extent of the com I pany's operations. The Borra Burra Company are re-organising with a capital represented by 400 £10 shares. This company is, next to the Blaefc Hill Company, the largest in the Ballarat proper division of the district. Mr Surveyor Cowan's report for May supplies us with the following returns of quartz companies in his division: Total yield Companies. Quartz Average of gold Tons, oz dwt gr oz dwi gr Old P. O.

The average in Mr Fitzpatrick's division for the previous month was 4 dwts, while in Mr Cowan's it was 3 dwts 13 gré, so that in one division there has been a falling off of 1 dwt 7 grs, and in the other an increase of 23 gre. There are some excellent quartz reefs in the Jim Crow neighborhood, as will be seen from the follow- ing:-We hear that No. 3 company, Adam's reef, Daylesford, has crushed 40 tons, which have yielded 105 Ibs of gold. This was a party of Frenchmen, who were so philosophical as to be satisfied with this splendid haul, and to take their departure at , once for la bell France. No. 4 cr4shed some time ago 13 tons that yielded 209 oz, and 20 tons that yeilded 411 oz. At present they have about 80 tons of stone on the ground, which is expected to run 10 oz to the ton. No. 5 are 170 feet down, and driving for the reef. No. 6 have just struck the cap of the reef, which is looking promising. No. 7, or Hoff's Company, are down near 170 feet, and intend opening out at 200 feet. All these companies, except Hoff's, have four or six shareholders oniy. " Hoff's," however, is composed of 20 shareholders, holding 1200 feet of the reef. The work is done at present by contract, and the management being good, the prospects of the company look very welL Oar Climes correspondent supplies the following particulars under da*e 6th June:-The Clunes Com- pany paid a dividend of £9 per share last Saturday, and a larger one is confidently anticipated the next pay day. The mine is said never to have looked so well as at present. Shares are ruling at £350, hav- ing increased £100 in a short time. The new tram- way to convey the large blocks of quartz to the hydraulic stone-breaking machine is completed, and the machine has been at work. The Fort Phillip Company for this month makes a return for six months. The quantity crushed was 4248 tons, yield 3428 oz 12 dwt, average per ton 16 dwt 3 gr. The works are doing well. There are some additional experiments in progress, to which I may at a future period be permitted to refer. The Clones United Company have newly finished their new battery and engine bouses. The framework of the new iron battery is fixed and being rapidly completed. This is the first company which has here essayed a trial of cast-iron framed batteries. This, I may say, pre- sents aa appearance of great strength. They have not much water in the shaft, which is raised at present by very large canvas buckets. The Yankee Company are acknowledged to be doing well, but I have no returns to furnish. The Criterion Company have crushed, from 3rd May to the 31et May, 924 tous 2 cwt, which yielded 389 oz 8 dwt, averaging per ton 8 dwt 10 gr. The Victoria Company crushed since the last corrected returns 725£ tons, which gave the satisfactory yield of 655 oz 12 dwt 12 gr, averaging per ton 18 dwt 2 gr. The house for the new battery and the engine house is a lofty and spa« ions building. It is being finished very fast. The foundations for thc battery are being laid. In the Creswick and Said Hills part of the dis- trict the alluvial grounds in occupation are yielding very fair returns for the most part, and several large undertakings on the Red Streak, at Creswick, are now getting anderweigh with promising evidences of future success. In the Smythesdale and Linton divisions things are rather quiet, but some of the claims are yielding splendid returns. The Great Western, Warren's Lead, have paid some extraordinary dividends, equally, if not occasionally exceeding those of the best claims in Ballarat proper. As much as £7-4 pei share for the fortnight has been paid by this lucky comoanv. The Melbourne folk have lately been apprised of the probability of a deep lead of gold underlying their magnificent city. Mr C. F. Nicholls, an old re- sident here of large experience, both practically and scientifically in mining affairs, has published in our columns from time to time his reasons for conclud- ing that such a lead exists. From a recent contri- bution by that gentleman, who now resides in Mel- bourne, we extract the following. He says: "That a deep lead existed I had no doubt, but to justify the supposition of its being rich I considered that it was necessary to find auriferous ranges in its immediate neighborhood, and gold-bearing quartz reefs intersecting the course of the lead and probably acting as local feeders. These I believe to exist. Gold bearing reels have been worked at Boorandara, four miles from Melbourne, and on a farm of Mr Peter Smith, about eight miles from Melbourne. Gold has been found in alluvial drifts at North Melbourne, at Emerald Hill, at St. Kilda, at Greville street station, at Kew, Hawthorn, and at Studley Park, making a circle round Melbourne of about thirteen miles. My own special search led to the discovery of heavy gold in the gravel at Studley Park on the 23rd of February last, and a speck or two of fine gold and a large per centage of black sand out of as much wash dirt as I could poke np with a stick from a gravel pit and carry home in a cambric handkerchief. At Prahran there are like indications. On the south side of Prince's bridge, near the St Kilda road; tbe same at Batman's Hill, and the hill on which the exhibition building stands. I presume that all the auriferous deposite on the high ground around Melbourne lead into the deep ground, the Yarra valley, which is primarily fed by the auriferous drifts of the Dandenong Plenty, and great dividing ranges. Without attempting to be scientific, I rest upon two or three facts, which, if Government allows me to follow up may be dealt with by our sarans as seems to then best. I account for nothing, and do not prêtent to interpret nature or justify scientific induction, j rest npon common-place observation and minin¡ experience, and judge by analogy and fact. Mj special tacts are these:-That on the Studley Pari reserve there is opened out to view an nnmistakabli deposit of washdirt, in which others have found gol and in which I have found gold. This washdirt i being carried away to gravel footpaths and mak concrete. Hr Nicholls has applied fur permission, t work a portion of the ground he has surveyed, thu demonstrating his confidence in the conclusions b has drawn from the observations he has made.
