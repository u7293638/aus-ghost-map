Prayer was then offered, followed % a few [; remarks by the Hon. J. Forrest, who.said they hid met that day to lay the fonndation-stone of a branch of the Churoh of Scotland. The object of the new church to be erected in Fre mantlewas to promote theoanseof Christianity in this far and distant oountry, and to teach them to do their dnty to God and 'to .their neighbour. They would be taught ¿in that Churoh to honour their father and mother, to be obedient to those in authority, and .to lead good, upright and honest lives t in fact they would be taught to be good men and good worn Bri. Ina great work anon aa they had entered upon that day, fae felt all classes of the oemmonity had a great and direct interest ; not poly the rulers pf the people, those .who sat in authority, but everyone who had the best interests of the colony at heart, because in promoting religion they wer promoting the greatest safeguard for th good and well-being of society. He souli only hope, and he was sure they would joh with him in the bops, that this Churoh woul< have a great influenoe in the future, that fron Jbmng a. branoh of the great old Churoh ii the mother country, it would in time gron sp prosperous and ao great that it wonh! ultimately be come a tree itself, sending fortb branches in the same way as the old mothei ©burch had, to all parts of. the world. He congratulated the Bev. Mr. Hanlin, tnt clergyman of the ohnroh and the offioe bear- ers on jtibe great energy they had displayed in being able se soon to lay the foundation of that church. Personally it gave bin great pleasure to join with them in that good Work. He eould only say again that he hoped Jta course would be long and prosper, ons and (that all those,present.that day would ¡see-, it rise ¿nt»a; Jtoaufófu! edifice and that its work might be prosperous and its effects far reaching. t .; T^e ? Ber. J>. SÇBABEB expressed his pleasure.at being;present. Eight years ago he .had-the privilege of presiding at the laying pf the first foandation stone of their Church in the colony..:. Kow be was present at the laying pf the second* and ho trusted that in a few,; weeks he would ses the third one of taapther Cbprph laid. He remarked upon the rejtiresentatirs ¿ga^hering^he /ssw .before him, ap4.,,said it indicated; .the, good feeling that pxisted. As he U?pked arpnnd he saw minis terpof varionsphprohes. i He also recognised prominent individuals belonging to all the Protestant denominations in the oolony, and it showed that although there were various mmo^ points pf difference between them, they ould remember that they were all branobes of the Christian Church. He wished it to be understood that they bad not. come to this oolony with a .sectarian spirit, but to assist in the great spiritual work that lay before them ip that colony, and that they were willing to co- operate with thoBe previously in the field. They recognised ¿ta doty devolving on them as a Christian Church,' to follow its BOUS and daughters to the land of their adoption, end ¿here'keep before them the preoepts of the mother Churoh. He wished the new Church and its members every prosperity. The proceedings terminated with the sing- ing of a hymn, and the laying of offerings on the stone. .'
