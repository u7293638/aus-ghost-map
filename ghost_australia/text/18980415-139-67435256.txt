Saplings ha:d been cut to form atretchers for the wounded, and tt.r camp prese-ted a most dreary leok, for ihe red-skins had besn forced to le-ave their dead. and nearly half a hundred -warriors wino had died from the.ir peounds and tihers- inbo had frozen to dleath had been ?eft !n the camp. i There were deadt ponies, too, and a few Swounded one:. showing that the warrior band had sufnered terribly, and thei rent nea?t, cut down to one-half, were Tress Lng on in flitht for their vi!lage.

It was but an hour to sunset. and the scout expeoed to reach the entrance to the outlaw valley by dark, then camp for supper, and when the men were warm and rested, make a night attach on the cabins. But he halted again and again and glanced about him. The snow shut out all from view, and he had no mountain peaks to guide him. At last it became evident.that the ever-unerring scout, Cody, was at fault. "Lieutenant Seaford, we must camp here, sir, for I ainlost." "Lost, Cody?" - . "Yes, sir. This is a miserable place for a camp, with no water and little wood, t but night is falling, -and to wander aim lessly means death. We must make the best of it until daylight" "It is all we can do, though I fear for our hdrses-and men thus exposed.?. -"It will be worse sir, if we go on, and darkness catches us where there is no wood." "You are right; and so here we will camp, for it is growing dark now" b The order was reluctantly' given, and the nien were compelled io make the best c of it. Where they had expected to reach a the outlaw retreat that night and find 0 shelter, if after a hard fight, they must make the best of what was before them. r But no one blamed the chief of scouts, for all had wondered how he had thus far led them -through .that blinding storm. ' - They knew that they and their horses s1 would suffer terribly through the night -that some would die, perhaps: but there was no grumbling, and the men eet to work to make the best of it, when suddenly a cry from Cody startled one n and all, and every eye was upon him. CHAPTER XXVIIL-A WEIRD GUIDE. In the gathering gloom., of coming U night, in the driving mist of snow, the scouts and soldiers saw Cody seated up on'his horse - for he had made another effort to find a better camping ground his hand outstretched as he pointedt to= wards some object -upon which his eyes rested. - - - ' - . 1 At first they saw nothing, but the keen gaze of Lieutenant Seaford pierced the sweeping :curtdin. of- falling snow, and beheld a horse and rider. It a-ivas as white horse, and the rider was envelop- ti ed in a mantle as spotless as the snow about him. It looked like a shroud, and floated about the form of the horse man almost like a cloud it seemed. p "See! it is a horseman, and steed and e: rider look like ghosts," cried Lieutenant Seaford. . Every eye saw it now, and they beheld an arm of the weird horseman rise and a' beckon them towards him, then point a In a certain direction. "Come, Lieutenant Seaford, we must follow him, for that is my Ghost Guide," cried-Cody. is '.Yes, Seaford -Spectre Horseifan or ti whatever it be, we must follow," said Surgeon PowelL T The young-officer saw Cody ride to wards the phantom-like form, and in stantly.it moved away from him, but still beckoned for him to follow. "Come, mount men--forward, march!" at Lieutenant Seaford commanded; and ft the men, who had dismounted, leaped to their saddles as quickly as their be- it numbed limbs would allow. "He leaves a trail, Cody, I am glad to Ct see," cried the lieutenant, springing for ward to the side of the scout. "Yes, sir; but horse and rider are about as :weird a pair as I ever met Still, he led me to safety once, and I will follow him." "Yes, I remember; but why not ride up d and Join him?" w '"You notice, sir, that he does not wish it, for the moment I hasten my pace he does the same." "True, so humor him by all means, only do not let him get out of sight." "I'll try not to, sir." sir.."" r " " It "What do' you make out of sh aIa guide?" sc- - - "I do not know, sir. But whoever or whatever he is, he diells in these moun- tl tains, and-knows them, though just how he came In time to save - us I do not "-"Wellt ghost or m?oital .man, we are indebted- to him for our lives. I almost -begin to feel:. -It is growing very dark -do.yourse.hlm?", - -. "Yes,. sir; he has dropped -back nearer to us. as though.not to-have- us 'lose him." ... After riding on a short distance, fur ther, Cody began to look about him, in spite of the darkness. At last he said : - "Lieutenant Seaford, I know where we are." . - r "Ah!" "We are in the canyon leading to the little valley. I recognise the high cliffs now, and I find I got off the trail a couple of miles back. See there. sir:" and Cody pointed to high cliffs upon one side, and ahead loomed another wall of ock. - '!The weird guide has halted, Cody." "Yes, he is at the entrance of the pass. See, he points up the valley, and - he has gone." "You are right." . The aeird guide had suddenly turned and his horse had dashed off at a bound. "'What does it mean, Cody?" "It means, sir. that he knew we were lost, and he has guided us to tile pass entering the valley In which the CMid nighters have their retreat."' "And it is near?" "The barrier across from cliff to cliff is not a qnarter of a mile 'head, and then we enter the valley, and. crossing it, are upon the cabins." "Well, we will not delay in attackingl them. for the men are half--frozen :and the horses used up." "Yes; and through thile snitOW e canl ride rigiht up to the cabins aud demand the surrender of the outlaws, for we can surl'ounld each hut. and tile sooner we fight It out and get warmthi and shelter the better." "You are right: so lead the way, and I will have the men come up in close order and look to their reapons;" and the lieutenant waited for his men to come up while Cody rode on ahead. 1 When they came up a~.lin wilh hlim, he1 wes at the barrier, ::Ild had let tilhe bare down Thle weird guide had bIeen tlise, the goal was before them., u-d th-ey were ready to fight to thie ellnl.

It was not late, and yet the outlawns ' seemed to have ali retired. Not a spark Ir or a sign of smoke was seen rising utIp 1- fromn any of the chimneys. A- t last tile men hlad got their positions, dismounted, and witih their arms ready, Sstood awaiting the ordeal. 1 Knoclting loudly upon the door of what hs. e 1mew to be the cabin of Captain Law t- icss, Cody nawited a reply, -while Sur t geon Powell, Lieutenant SeaLord, and O Lieutenant -Emory at the sane.time kInocked at the doots of the" other log as huts. . . . But no answer came to any of the ( knocks. Again they were repeated. but It was the same silent response that greeted v them. "Open in the name of the United t States army." commanded Lieutenant c Seaford, and his words Were repeated at the doors of the other cabins. Still no response. U "Come, men, break in the doors!" t: commanded Seaford; and large logs of n wood lying outside of each cabin and six feet in length were raised and hurled I against the doors. C Whatever the fastenings they soon gave way, and the doors stood open. F Then the pine knots were brought into s. requisition, lighted, and one was thrown It into each cabin. n The light revealed that each cabin was S' deserted. and, running in, the pine torch b was thrown from the clay floor into the o: large fireplaces. g The ashes in each were cold, showing that there had been no fire there for t1 some days at least. h: The large logs outside were then Et brought in. and quickly fires were blaz- fe nog and sending forth a cheerful light and genial warmth. The Midnighters w had not been found, but the half frozen a men were in a place of refuge front the E fearful storm and cold. Quickly their horses were unsaddled. to blanketed, and led into three of the th cabins, and the oats brought on a pack animal given to them in a rather gener- Itt ous quantity, while the ice on the lake 0m was broken, and the hores' comfort t' cared for by their humane riders. he The tired, hungry, and cold brutes greatly enjoyed their shelter and pt, Food. and the soldiers and scouts 'n :tthered in the other cabins and cooked l supper, while the officers.

Cody ,-as the first one to awaike in the ' morning, and ie threw-some logs on the fre; and, opening the door of the cabin, fo stepped out to see what the.weather was Ir to be. . t. " IC The wind still howled dismally, and . the skies were overcast with leaden t5 slouds, but the snow had ceased to fall. " "At last the storm has spent itself. It lb will clear off . to-day," -muttered the i ,cout, with evident satisfaction, and he ti urned to aweaken the others in the cabin when his eyes fell upon a slip of paper sefere the door. It had been stuck there with a large pin. Instantly the scout took it down, sxpecting that the outlaws had left it here, and unfolding it read as follows, written in a legible hand: Or Colonel Cody, --our foes have fled, co end you must return to the post, and to malt another time to strike them. ta The Indicues will make a sweep down ipon the poet and settlements In the tl: .haw that will follow this storm, for all lie s ready for their raid: so return with all o'< taste and prepare for them, do re CHE GHOST OF THE MOUNTAINS. re C1 CHAPTER nXXX.-THA RETURn. di: When Lieutenants- Seaford and Emory all end Surgeon Powell had. read this ta it'ange warning found by Cody, 'the se: ormer said:- th "Well, Cody, what do you think of fs. t," . fo: "I have had reason to feel perfect w onfidence in my weird friend, lieu enant" alt "Then you think it just as he has in; aid?" ste "Yes, sir." .. fr "And you,'Powell?'

We f? have missed the outlaws, iut titen we s have given an Indian band a savere drubbing, and this warning is worth more than the hanging of a hundred Mtidnighters just now; while I notice a A P.S. here which you doubtless have not Seen:" and Lleutenant Emory read, under a fold of paper : "Return for another time to pounce down tpon the outlaws, for you will find them here later' on." The paperc passed from one to the other of the party, was read in silence, and after a few more comments, Lieu- : tenant Seaford said : "Emory, please give the order that we v will start on the home trail in an hour's a time. The metn had hoped for a day of rest t under shellter. 1Iut there was no grum ilihlg when the order was given, and as ' thlere ',as everv indication that the out laws. fearing the return of Cody. had left the place for good, all were in the saddle ready for tIe march at tie ap- o pointel time.

"I admit all that you :-ty, Ethel, is to to the scout, offcers, and nmen ; but they Ila have Nature to subdue in fighting this storm, and the contest is too unequal, In for we have had three days of It now." p "See, uncle, the snow has ceased, the i wind is losing Its strength, and there is I ia break of sunshine in the clouds," cried to Ethel.E The colonel and Captain Nolan sprng i.11 to the window where she stood. and Faw a! that it was as the young lady had said. s.
