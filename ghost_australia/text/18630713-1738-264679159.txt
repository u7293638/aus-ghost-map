It is important that the approach of ships should be laiown som'e hours at least befo/e - they can r^ach the port, and, in the case of passengers vessels, this information is^stillroonB necessary, to enable the friends of those on board to come down.from the country districts to meet them.. As the infocmation is sent. throughout the 'colony by telegraph free of charge, the least shipmasters can do. in return, if, when they arc within .signalling distance, to take care that the men at the station shall have an opportunity of reading the signals.— Captain J.
