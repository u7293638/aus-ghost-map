Ariadno started proceedings as usual, hut she only cantered twice round. Simon did half-pace work by himself, and looks hearty and well. Tumbarumba bowled along round tbo sand track at hie best pace. Saxby started. to gallop once round the poll track, bub when ho had gone half way a bandago which ho was wearing became loose, and brought him down. The fall looked a very bad one, but, fortunately, such was not the case, as boyond a slight shaking, neither horse nor rider were hurt. Stella galloped once round the sand track. Stciladean, Piety, and Eurolic put in some good work, finishing with & run home. After breakfast Impostor was oxercieed over tho hurdles, also Reform* ation. Mousoon performed long strong work. Britomarto easily, beat Fairy King over six furlongs, tho titno being lmin 23seo. Rushlight ran a very good gallop over tho Cup distanco, and has an outside show.

Numerous others wcro on tho coursc, but they did not do anything worth recording. I never romembcr seeing so many horses in work in Wagga at 0110 time, and tho Holds will bo tmusuully large. The Steeplechase promises to bo tho most interesting race at the mooting, as I think there will be a good few starters and all good jumpers. . .
