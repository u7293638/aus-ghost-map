For Fashion's Sake. i " Do you think you are sufficiently decayed ?" was perhaps a reasonable question in the days of rampant ffistheticism. But (says a London contemporary) the ura/.o for imitating mortality upon tho verge of putting on im mortality Has died a muoh-prayed-for death ; and .there seems no reason now why anyone should starve himself into a skeleton for the pure love of true art. But in spite of this revival of healthy sanity we learn that there is a growing feeling in the direction of imitat ing. some of the feeblenesses of existence, a feeling which takes a twofold expression. One is not praotioal. It consists of seeking after some dye or unguent to produce that fascinating white hair which is tbe envy of young and old. Of gray hair we have plenty; of white hair we have a fair quantity. But gray hair is too common to be valuable, and white hair (the legitimate) is too apt to be attended with that other less digni6ed phenomenon known as baldness. What is desired to ba obtained is a good crop of white hair while one is yet young enough to appreoiate the advantages of its striking appearance. But, alaa! art has not yet learned the secret of nature in this respect ! and there is no more simple way of blanching the hair than the good old receipt of passing a night with a ghost, or hanging from a preoipitous cliff by a rope whose strands are slowly untwisting. Failing white hair, then, we oome to the second method. This is to look as consumptive as possible. A dead load-white complexion, relieved by a hectio flush, is said to be the ideal of happy beauty, Ibis, unfortunately, cau be produced by the aid of propor cosmetics, and we understand that the psitrinaire is the ooming mode for ladies. We advise them, however, to abjure the bectio flush. The most effective pallor of whioh we ever read—that of the County of Monte Cristo—was of an abiolute corpao-liku white.—Echo.
