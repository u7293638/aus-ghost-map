HAVE YOU SEEN THE GHOST ? The theatrical notice which appeared in last Tuesday's Herald contains the following exquisitely constructed sentence : — Mr. Hoskins, as the Ghost, has been for several years a feature of the Australian stage, and has lost none of its power by recent repetition. It must be peculiarly gratifying to the artiste in question to know that he has been, as the bfhost, " tor several years a feature ot the Australian stage." But surely the critic cannot mean that Mr. Hoskins has nightly impersonated a shade " for several years." One would think that so prolonged a performance would become tediously monotonous both to the player and his audience. What is "a feature of the Australian stage ?" Surely the features of Australian stages— scenery, proscenium, footlights, drop-scenes, &c.; — are com mon to most other stages in all parts of the world. However, our gusher proceeds — " and has" (meaning presumably "and Mr. Hos kins has") "lost none of its power by recent repetition." "Lost none of its power !" Why, can this ready-made critic have the audacity to consider our Hoskins — the great Hoskins — Hoskins the magnificent— a thing ? Ye gods ! that he who as Mark Antony, Old Tom, Prospero, and in countless other characters h is again and again "brought down the house," should c mo to be referred to as an inanimate object — a thing ! Mr. Punch sincerely trusts that this r ish scribe will lose a consi derable amount of his present power, and then recruit h:s exhausted energies by a few copious doses of English grammar — syntax and prosody to be especially studied. «
