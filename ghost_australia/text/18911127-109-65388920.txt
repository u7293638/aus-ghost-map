"There was noting of shrness in her manner," said the foreigner, " and I did gather from other indicathons-" Rimpler decided that Dorcas should wait it ort that night, and went on with the foreigner to Hackbit'e, where a loan was arranged. CHAPTER LXIII.-A CoryT T"rurr. The little matter of busoness IMonieur Ptli ols had to transact with Mr. IHackbit was arrsnged atunally in that gentleman's abserce. Ke.ioh had been up at her mother' all day. so Mr. Biacklit took the opportunity of looking over all her belongings, imagin!cg that he might discover some prerations for fight. But he wsu disappointnl. He found n thing in KeziGs' orderly drawers and boxes hut the most natural and ordinary things. Incon: sistent as it must app ear, he was angry at n t Ending what he had sought, and a recelve came into his mind, without his being per fectly conscious cf it If pc-opte put themelves in a frame of mind to do a thing, they are rertty sure to find an opportunity, and them.

Stas and 3Monsieur PelI.is ca.me in liret, and re.nained in the omo same. time, the for?igner going away before UsckLit's return. That gentle man made a great noise in the entrance-hall when he did come, and to all appearan:e had been drinkining again. He came in smiing,. jnutu he always emiled when be was going to anything remakably offen.ire. " Well, Rimpler," he said sarcastically, " I hope yon ar enjoying my wroe's oO.cey.". limlper made no rely. lieialh bt her lip, anrod looked angry. "'You know the stock she comes of, Bimpler," he went en. " One of them, whose Sriptnre knowldge is groat, said something about not gathering tigS frc. thistles. I wish Ihad thought of that when I married my wife. We're all toos till we learn. I took her for a saint You know what she is, Rimrler. Did you ever see a man so infernally sold "" Keziah fixed her black eyes with wrathful intensity on Hackhit's face. "s'hat do you want to goad me to do i'" ?aid she. "Is there anything you are anxious to be goaded into doing i' replied Hacktit, seating himself in a chair, and tipping It up on the hind iasish looked as if about to quit the room, but she changed her mind, and aet down. ;he would not have done so had she known what would follow. " Have you ever heard the story about my wife, Itimpler " went on Iackbit, insolently. he had a situation at I.eamington, and managed to get over the medical man in at tendane at the house, whro was uUbeO.uently taken up on a charge of murler. the then laid her traps for me, and here I am. anyone SLHow dire yon insult me sol" treke out Kezisa.

He waited some time patiently; but lba dida not see hn r are outride. Ie thought to himself, if she hid gone to meet that fellow -bhlsed brpcal .rngtmtt with YL t Elnwrthy, they must have geoue round to the back of the back of the house; so he deter mined to go round and reconnoitre. Tlhohouse was quite still. lie thought he might venture to do it. The lauding window lay between the rooom where Keoiahiwas raw sle, ping and the night nurser, lie thoug ht. ii they were in the garden behind. he should hear as well as see from this po'ition. It was hia habit when he wentinto a new house to trr all the lucks and all the windows, to leant if they had ?su peculiarity of opening and shutting. This he alwaysmsna",ed to to in a natural manner. Conselquenllr, he had ascertained that the landing windorw would open without a sound, though his own would not. So he very quietly rised the window. and put his head out. lie could see nothing, it was so dlark. Blut then, he argued. "If I cau gee nothing, the sasredarki les renders rme inrisilto to others, which is also o.,mething." Yes, there was some one moving below, and the sound of low voices. "I am afraid to stay in the same house with hint," he heard Keeih say. "Yet if I freel myself, and went away from him, then he and all the world would say it was to go to you, which I would never do, except as now." A lor voice answered, " Is my reputation worth more to me than yon arn, Kizzyry You must come to no, if you have so much rea>on to fear. And why nioti Thee laws are men's laws, antd nt God's. You are mine be right. What does it matter what people saz You would goaway, far from the reach of their Voices. It cotld not matter to you then." "If no one knew, I should know," was Keaish's renlr. "No, I will never do that. If I leave mr'housland's roof, you must promise me faithfully you will never see me or apeak to me again." She wasso arnest that she could nriot but promise. But he felt in his heart he hall priomki.d more than he could perform. In the hbatlies ;o'he ool it it a question of thIe riht of the strongest: and lore for Keziah, and desire to possess her, were stronger this time with p:or lIlworthy than any mans-made laws. Silas, who had heard every word of this, felt he had bhen having a irrr good time; and as thery '-~n'sd talking. an apptredl to separate, he sioely ht'gan to put d own the window. nut s 'et'tin" hapl ned that made him stop 5su dd nl in theperation.

Nor did tIle exipe.rince tenninate as yet. Suddenly he felt himse?. being drag-ed in the darkncss, along the !anding into his own room. Then a voice for the 1:rst time ecc:sted him. It was W\ilon's.

All this to be put n paper." Mr. limpler wrapped himself in a blanket, and wrote down his list of itemsin his pocket book, to be remembered against Wilson for ever, and whilehewrote, Wilson had cleared away all the mess, and was anxiously waiting for Keziah to come in. And now that her I exertions were over, and that she had had the ileasure she had longed for, of giving it to "that ?impler," a feeling of depression came over her. She had heard Keziah's voice below. SThen it is true." she thought, after all. " What a pity :" end she waited and watched for Keziah's camiing in. But Kerah was at that moment tbing ?rsuaded never to came in ran mere. and she was wavering. But she and Rupert had heard the cry. though they had ict recognised the voice; and they thought they had been discovered. Keziah had dung desperately to lupert's arm and he held her firmly. "Come away, Kiz'y, mr dear love, while there is yet time. If rou go he will murder you, now he has disocreeed. Why should you throw yourself into the jaws of death at ran. don, and ruin my life too, for such a villain as he is?

And no: waiting for a reply, he led her with his strong arm about her, downc the gpardauo path and out at the gate. :'he had been scarcely cons?eicus of anything but the strength of what he said, till now that she was moving wayw . She stoplped with a new strength, and ,ased his arm from about her. "No." she said, "Ieanbotdie. I will go back. le will think all this evil against me. IIe shall never hate retaon. Since I hae lost oamy solf.respect lthe oe!y thing left to me: ard would you, who say you love me. rob me of t.hat " Ite did not aler to take hold of her again. A streak of light was beginning to be visible in the east, and the objects in the garden bgin to te delined. "Oh'" she said, with a shudder, "it is growing daylight; another m:oment and it would be too late for me to go btack." .\nd even while the spoke she fled away, and entered the bhoase. As she went she heard a gieat sob follow, and it wrung her hea't. 'he b?eit.atcs one moment. " Is he wcrth this sacrifice," ehe .aid to herself, " of both our lires i" But ertn while she thought, a roicewithin herbade her go bark. She en tiered the house.

And oh, that I should have lived to see this day !" .Shall I go and tell my husband all about it before Mr. :impler can go to him 1" said K?e"ih, in a tone that might be used in a for Wion hesItatecd. "No." at last she re. plied, "Ithikntot, miss. ilhs angermight be a, that he wouldn't know what be did to you, ile heard it fIrcm on." And Kei-h felt that a stronghold of htr integrity had died; far she could not say to her huahand," He never tried to persuade me to leave you." Some women milbthiave said it, even if untrne: but Kezinah could not. She feared this must come out with the rnt. She would nottell part of the truth, hilt the whole traUth, if shemat spe.k. And eovn iI she hid not speak, her hushand waould cme to her, and abe woald bare to answer him. While they talted, the grey streat in the sky, had crorn larier. Wilson started. Sho noticed the could sce Ke:iaoh naw--the outliu? of her f9iue. "The servants will he coining down,' she said: "no to your ro:it. It is a wonder they are not down lefoure, but I have been to staggered, I had not tholught of it." Knzihh fled up the stairase like a creature airaid of the light, and Wilson went to Leonard. who was waking. It was soon breakfast time. Keiah had dresned herself nicely, why, she could hardly have toll, for she felt she was going to hear her sentence., 'o her great surprise, on going to the break. fastrronm, for it wt not Ke'iah to abunt here snif, Mr. Rimpler was there before her. and appeared ea!m, as if nothing had happened. He had a black eye, and a plaster under it, which Keziah did not remember to hare seen before, and which air. Itimpler blunderingly proceeded to a:naogise for, saying he had tumbled over something in his room in the dark: he did not attempt to say what. Keeiah felt he was telling her a lie, and instinetively the idea itme into her mind that he had had a tussle with Wilson, and ehe smiled. Strange that humanbeings are so con. â¢titute, that, in the moments when they are saddest and most sore pressed, the coptirv mind releases itself from bandago in spite of all con. tml, and catchse eagerly at an opportunity for mirth. So Ke.iah smilet in the depth of her trouble. A few minutes later IMr. Itckbit came down. ie was much as usual, rude and inattentive, and aggravating. But, beyond this, nothing occurred. Was the storm about to blow over, or was its breaking only deferrcd. Could Wilson have been mistaken about Iimpler's having found her out? These quentions puznled Keciah extremely, and she could not help thinking about them in spite of herself. After Ireakfast she noticed that Mr. Rim lrr made no attempt to have private commmucai tion with her huslband, ani she remarked this to Whieon, and said that he might not know, or, if he did, he right not be go:ng to tell. "larve you ever seen a cat with a mouse, missi'" was the answer. "She lets it run about, ael think it'elf free, because she can put her foot on it when she likes." "Well," .ait aeriah. wearily. "Only if it is to come, I with. it wotild come quickly." CIIAPTER XI.IV.--Jr:aL itr.vrcrs Jri'xry. That morning, when it was nearly dinner time at the house of Iinlrrmrr, Jubtl and his uncle Iivid 're comllig aC?oot the Old hPark from the stationt of .rutley. " What a hCeathenish place this is!" Juhal remarked to his uncle, looking scmrnfully aroundl at the wretched tumb!e.down buildings, the literally black road, and the great mounds of cinders, and ominous.looking holes. " Ieally, I had no idea it wan half so bad as this." "Ab, J::bTln' said his uncle, " we never can judge a place till we rc another to compare it wmit. When I was a little lad, and ued to carryr our gr.'n: father's d:nner in a bahin tied up, in a h rlkerchief, I shouil have been ready to slar nro:'iv as had said Jumley wasn't the tinest'llace in the wer!l. No, not that," !aid David, b!,shinc: t!iyhtly. " I was always more like rannin awayr than slaying aoeoty. Ilat these minet," he went on, pointing with his walking alick, " weren't worked out then, Jubti, that is, Ial o! 'om weren't. And Jcsh::a, your lather, Dlrcna, and I, and the dear laby that died, we used to play of a night, at hop. scotch with a piece of coal, in this very place, and we used to run over the pit-banks until it got dark. And you tee that house over there, Jubal '" he said, indicating the remains of one; "manr's the time I've aren your grandfather washing what he elled ' the lint coat' off, out. side that door. There was always a bench standing there, with a tub on it. ready for him. Your grandmother mwas a very dlean Womtn, and she couldn't bear to have her place mesed np, she said, as soon as it was c!eaned." "Well, unole," rejoined Jubal, with a high colour in his cheeks. "I mean no offence; but for oar future conmfoet, it may be as well that I Ihould just nay, that I am not particularly proud of haring had a grandfather who worked in a coalpit; nor am I particolarly in. terested in detailed accounts of his methods of performing a toilet: nor of games played by my father and aunt I)orcss and you. And if I tring any fellows home with me. as you told me I may, I beg you will not mention this kind of thing. Of course, I mean no offence. But fellows are apt to look down on this sort of thing. I don't mean to say my grandfather might not have been a very good man." "lie was a very good man.' said his uncle in a low tone. Ie was taking in with diuicultywhat be was hearing, and he was wounded. Jubal went on " You see, however interesting these accounte may be to members of the family, they eannnt be interesting to ountiders." "But you are not an outsider, Juba!," re. plied his uncle, in the same grieved tone. "Still,rou s*c," went on Joubn, "I never knew my grandfather, which is almost equal to notbelonging to him. And,"he a?ded, tak ingout cigar, and lighting it, atthe rame time being very careful not to soil his straw coloured glove, which fitted to a nicety, and wrsbordered by the whitest of white cuffs, " I can't say that I know a single membtr of the family that anyone would lke to belong to ex cept you." And Jubal glanced through his long lashes, at his uncle's face, to see the efect of his little c mpliment. Hle saw only the troubled l.ok. Ivaied Iimmon did not care much for complients, and did not see them readily. but he did notice Jubal's cigar, and said tohin "Well, .Tubal if I were you, I wouldn't go into your father's ahoye smoking, seeing he dislikes it so," " I would do a good deal to please you, uncle, but I *ball not come here to pdarer my father. Thee are not to kill the fatted calf on tug thalf, and hail the prodial retrnld. .And that is the kind of story he'd tell to all the clerks in the bank. if I humoured his wishes ever so little. If he says I'm penitent, it shall be a direct lie, he shan't have a fouindation of excunre for it. And see. uncle," he aaid, point ing with his hand in which he bld his lichted clear for a morment. "as you are fend of re mix aee .-, there in the nole edifuce occupiedby grandmo:her during the latter ptrt of her delightful nojourn iu this neigdhbocrhood." David, tslo though he wras, c:uld take the impression of a tone as quickly as anyone; and he felt that Jabol had known her as a quetlons old woman, it wans true; but David had known her as the patient, hard-working mother of the family, lie could remember many a time being racked in her arms at the cottage door, wb hen had falleni down, or when some pl?yfellow had lbeen hitting him.

"Oh, all rigiht, uncde," said Jubal. "I didn't mean to hurt you. It's all true wht you say. Iwas on:yj hitngeither."

Yes ; the knife hrd boen to the grinder's, and had got aharpentd; but it seemed to have dreamsof cutini on it. own account. Jn?t.al, having a notion that his uncle was pondering over what he had picked up. and winhiog to change his thoughits, remarked, "VWhat an aful mer this road makes of one's hoots nod one's trousers !" "You can turn your trousers up," replie his uncle, ookiungldown at Jubal'. "1 tiurme mine up in th? u atina."

It wis no beggar comig to his fther's house to o?k bread. Julal went s a prince conferring a favnur by his presence. Tho doorwas opened. Sarah, who had not seen Jubal ,o long, could hardly keep her joy in. Sho seized him after the manner of the Ilia'k "'aunty people, no too gently. " And, i4h, what a beautilul gentlhman he's growed ilito,' she exclaime. " less his handsome face." SIt war not until she had exhiauted as many teithets as she could think of, that she began to notice that Jlhal was not so effusive. In fact, lie was considering whether she had beent cooking, and might poNaibly grease his clothes. Ies aid- "Oh, so it'syou, Sarah. How do you do " This without a smile, and in a very condescend.

I just remembered it." - Strah stared at him in blank amaiement, hut did not hold out her hand-the hard. working, tough hand that was always to kindly and so ready to labour to the uttermost in loring oices for those she cared for. Jubal dropped the half-a-crown into her hand, taking great care not to touch her with his glare. The tnuch of the cold metal seemed to make atrahre.uliss the truth. She flung it from her, and flung her apron over her heal, and began to sob, whileshe gasped out '"No, I will never take it: no, not if I were stir-ing. To think that I would ha' giTe all my osmgs for one shake of his hand." Jubal flushed, and drew oft one of his tight fitting gloves. " Dear me," he said," if its a shake-hands you want.

She knew that for years she had llghtered his life when he war at ho::ie and miserable, that she had during the past week prepared all kinds of pleasant surprises for him. And now he treated her like a stranger, and did not even bhake hands with her. O simple Sarah ' with your good heart, you h--e mae and hidden away in the cuiiloard an apple.

(Sarah had slipped away into the kitchen.) "It is not to enjoy myself I have came, bhit to se the nakedness of the laud. You see." he said, hopinghis father was eomewherewi:hinhearing, " I've not let my Scripture knowfldga ruat. aBt relly aunt, you are behind te timesdown here at Jumley ; green isn't in fashion, you know, now-not in 3!arcester.' This was a very spiteful thrust, and it went home. " To are ver rnde, indeed," rejoined Dorcas, feeling the glory die out of her green silk nevertheless. "I get the fshion-plite regularly. I know what's in fashion better than ou. Well, David," ihe said, turning abruptly towards herbrother; and a col family kis was exchanged. But where was Mrs. rimmon all ths time? Will It be believed she was within hearing, and et did not come tospeak to her son? Sthewu half-afraid. He did not seem to have received the others -r t: what woald he think of her ? Jubal went iniu tsh dining-.u? ..- -.. ; hs mother in the dark p?asse leading into the kitchen. The table was.idfordinner. Jutal looked at CTetrthing en the table, whiile his unc!e and his father thook hands. Mr. iimmon was determined not to be the first to speak to his son, andJubal decided that he could vre w.thout thaking hands with his fathtr; to there wasno sort of greeting between them. Juba meant to speak to his father, if there were any occasion, u he would speak to any stranger; and an occas:k n came. Jubs! sat down o one of the chair, and got up again directly, looking scornfully at it. " You don't mean to sea that TOu:'r nSot hal the sprinu of that chair mended ett'" he said to his father; and that was all. Dinner must come in, a::d Mrs. Ilimman knew she coul de!ly no longer; so, he timidly entered the room. her face ne:rously working, and her tears redr to fall. Jubil ki5eed her and l.ld hEt ion him arn looked at her, and kissed Ler rgain. " The fareo has beg., has it "" tsail :iss Dorcas, seing this. " No," l ail Jubil, s'D.nir,. with las nnn round his mother's waist, " it as not. The far.e will begin when the nmnister comes in to tea, and you and father ac: hes loring fLmily before hia." When .Ke.ii entered th! room, iry r ale, and lookir plaler in her b!Lak .ire, which she w?re for her randnm:ther, Juhl cJl:dd hid1ly oel;tce it was his sister. The shart, crsp, bLack carts were the same as ever, but the features appeared to be chalnge; they were more pointed--a change due to thinnes,. She went first and kissed her uncle Da;ild. He prsssed her hand en-ouregingly, and was much tenderer than erver in his ranr,,r tcwaards her. Then Keiush wentbehind Jutu.l's chair, and, tleaing over, kissed his forehead. "Oh. Ke;i;ah," exclaimel Jubal, starting, "ho frirlhtfully cold yor lps ae " " Are they i" fsid Ke.iah,with a wan stile; and the took her place at the table, k.Lsing her mother au hiepased her. The door was now flung open, and Mr. IHackb;t iwa:'ered in, anrid srared the com rany with a er. tie ga?e a general nod, sat ,uown and plared his napkin across his knees. " Well, brothc-in-law," said Jtal, atross the ttble, " your ralet has Leglected you this morning. Do yo know yonur toilet's rather deifectirv " !fr.HIeklit looked severely acirss at Juail, ad remarkted with someapetritv that he would rather wear no clothes at all then be i.uered up like a loll, as Jlintl we. Doreas was sitting next to him. " Your necktie's righlt under yeaor ea," she said, " and you look as if you'd been to bed in your clothes." "*And you." retorted tl akbit, locking iti~dllr at his annt and her get-up. ' you look l if you'd just come out iroe unaer a glass shade, you do." "Oh, don't let us have cny quarrellin,." put in David. " Whot cn be the use of toat ?" After dinner, Jaulal announced his inten tion of taking a stroll. The mother would have liktd to have begged him to remainwith her, but how could the cieC'te to thi. son who had gnown into such a gentlcmai ? Yes, thno yornell to thi ichabitants,' was Ilackbit's comment " You'll collect a crowd if you go out." "You'll collect a bggercrowd than I shall, some day," retorted Juaul " And really, IIacbit," he taid, eying his brolherin-law witha good bit of merriment in lisilfae. "I want to light a cigar, and I beliere I could do itat your nose. Hlave you leen acting the dcown, sud forgotten to wash your face i" With this h'me.thraut he went out; and Kezch helted to dclear the tale. Mr. I'imp!er was to coe to tn. IHe balt been invited to dinner. bn:ut had made an excuse. When tea-time ca?e he appeared. There woo a marked callness in Daorms's arnierotreceiving Mr. Itimpler. which that gentleman could well account for. tie, for his part, appared to have tome fine joke on hand, and laughed to himself without any evident rea-on several times in succesion ; and at each laugh Dorc ol colured. IIe was, bow ervr, s:rupulousin his attention to her, and also seemed to take somn interest in Jubal, whom he had been led to suppose a very different sort nf person. CHAPTER XLV.-- Mo-s DBrrTz TaxNr When atlast the erenine wu over, and it was time to go home, Mr. Ilmpler offered to escrt Mio Dorca, which seemed naturel enough; but n sooner had he made the proposal than Dcrca sid, spitefally, " No, thank you, Mr. rimpler, I am no chicen, and not at all lafraid of bringin the Old;'ark myslf at'aight."

" lBut I haplih fo be neitlher an alien nor an outcast. I tell yo~n once for all, you must drop it." "Oh. Silu,- " Mr. Rimpler stoplel in the pathway. "If you don't drop it, I won't go another inch with you; mo now you know. And another thin.: I should like to refer tois your manner of nak:n;, signs at me before people." "And you never take any notice when I do," interrupted Miss Dorcas, "no matter how im portant it may be." "And I never will notice. I tellyou once for all, I won'thave it. )o you think I want all the world to believe we have a secret under. standingtogether? It was disgausting all the evening to net your eye fixed on me every timn I looked your way," "And thi after the way you left me in the Old Park last night:" said Doran, growing irate in her tamrn. They were on the same ground now. "I'll leave you here again if you don't mind." "Then you'llleave all that I have to con. municate to you." "I don't carea d--about your cromuni cation." "You know you do, or you wouldn't have taken so much trouble about it all. Well, at any rate, I got the papers you asked mc to get out of Joshua's safe." "W'here are they:"' responded Silas, now interested in a moment, and betrayed into showing it. Ie had not expected this. "Well, I waited here, till I was c'1t and tired, last night, and I ;oat them; so there.' "You lost them," said lI:impler, horror. struck. a "Yes, and Thad th:n aeafe enogih, when you came tirstn; and you'd ha, habd them ii it hadn't been for your going of with that foreigner.
