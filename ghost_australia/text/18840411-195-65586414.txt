ELSTERNWICK PARK RACES. A very enjoyable race meeting was held at Elsternwick Park on Saturday after. noon, when some really excellent racing took place. The weather was favorable, but the attendance was very poor, which, however, may be accounted for by the existing counter attraction in the shape of the intercolonial boat race, which doubtless drew the attention of a great number of sportsmen who would otherwise have visitedthe races. The pro gramme embraced five events, including a Maiden Trot, which was appropriated by Black Tracker,who succeeded in outpacing his adversaries in the first two heats. I The Hurdle Race, as was anticipated, fell to Ned Kelly, who started first favorite, asd was judiciously ridden by Batty. Don Alonzo was second and First Try third. The Elwood Handicap was cleverly won by Honors, who, assisted by a light weight at last scored a victory for her popular owner. Priestess who finished with a marvellous rush, second, and Coun tryman third, The Selling Race fell to The Ghost, a namesalke of the winner of the Ladies' 3racelet ; Loporello was nest and Anagram third. The last race of the day was the Elsternwick Park Handicap, in which Agatha, a handsome looking daughter of Yattendon and Agnes, got home first, and landed a good stake for backers, who supported her at 7 to 4 in a field of eleven runners. The winner was followed home by Raillery and Lyons Lady, in the order written. The starting in the majority of the events was thoroughly bad, especially in the Elwood and Elsternwick Park Handicap.-Age.
