A DAY OF HUMILIATION AND PRAYER. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-My Handhold believes that people can be brought to know and observe the laws of health by means of prayer, especially if it takes the form of public prayer It is strange that so able a minister of religion and BO diligent a student of the New Testament, should have overlooked the very obvious fact that public worship was denounced and prohibited by Christ and that He impressively admonished His disciples to pray in secret, and to use a very simple form of words Passing over this, however, permit me to offer my experience, as opposed to Mr. Handfield's belief. I was living in a cathedral city in England when the cholera broke out in 1849. The mortality was excessive, just as it had been from the plague in the same place two con tunes earlier A special day of fasting and humiliation was appointed, and prayers was offered up every Sunday in all the churches and chapels for the abatement of the malady I have no doubt that these were earnest and sincere, but they had neglect whatever either in lowering the death rate, or in mitigating the violence of the symptoms in those who suffered In conjunction with some of the medical men of the place, who had no belief in the efficacy of play or, I, or rather we, commenced an agitation in favour of bringing the city under the Health of Towns Act, and of taking power to borrow a large sum of money for the purposes of sewage and water supply We encountered an immense amount of opposition from the stupid, the selfish, and the superstitious Our worst opponents were the Consul will yes and the religious people The former wore, of course, for standing on the ancient ways and the latter clamorously asserted that it would be flying in the face of Providence to endeavour to put a stop to epidemics which were main firstly ' a visitation of God, the Fountain of Beneficence being, according to those premises, the author of all the evils which we bring upon ourselves by our own ignorance and immorality Having a newspaper at my command who eventually carried our point The Health of Towns Act was applied to the city. It was drained and sewered, and supplied with pure water, and it is now one of the healthiest places in the United Kingdom. The annual death rate, which before 1849 was 21 in the thousand, is now only 17, and no case of cholera occurred there when it was last in England. It is gratifying to add that the physician who was one of my most active and enlightened colleagues in the agitation has been selected by his fellow citizens as one of their representatives in the House of Commons in two successive Parliaments Five and twenty miles off to another cathedral city (Winchester) the inhabitants of which have no faith in sanitary science, but a firm belief in that " stimulation of the conscience ' which Mr Handfield, in the warmth of his imagination, supposes will bring it under the influence of the highest motives to repentance and amendment ' Now I saw by some recent English papers that the in sanitary condition of W chester is perfectly disgraceful, and that not all the combined and separate prayers of the bishop, the dean, the archdeacons, the prebendaries the canons, and the local clergy have had the slightest effect in amending the habits or improving the health of the inhabitants I gather f torn Mr Handfield s letter that all the religious preaching which is transacted every Sunday in Melbourne has very little effect upon mens daily lives, and that thoughtlessness, selfishness, and dishonesty prevail to a great extent in spite of it As he not then, confess that it is a failure, and apply the pulpit to more beneficial uses ' I recently read an American paper a really charming sermon preached by the Rev. W C Bennett, of Boston the subject of which was the physiology of vegetation There was not, I think, a word of doctrinal theo logy in it, but it abounded with beautiful illustrations of the power, wisdom, and loving kindness of the Creator Why cannot our preachers expound the laws of nature, and take for their text some one of the myriads of beautiful objects by which we are sure rounded-some one or more of the sublime laws by which the universe governed and in the study and exposition of which we obtain glimpses of the Infinite Mind from which they emanated? The bible of nature is distinctively a revelation of God to man and is stated to be so in that other book which has set all dina tender by the ears for the last 18 centuries 'Aeknow the beasts, and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee , or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee, who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this But what little we do know about these things, we owe not to preachers of religion, but to Aristotle and Pliny primarily, and subsequently to men of science, who have been discountenanced, proscribed, and persecuted by the church in all ages And the words of Job are repeated with greater emphasis and concise ness by Paul, The invisible things of God from the creation of the world even the eternal power and Godhead are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are [ made, so that men are without excuse for their ignorance of God, inasmuch as He is to be clearly seen in the laws and operations of nature, which is HIS garment, the visible presentment and manifestation of the in visible and all informing mind I have heard preachers dilate upon the words "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost," but I never remember to have heard one of them explain to his hearers the structure of that body, nor those laws of health by which that temple may be kept sweet and wholesome, may be preserved from disease, and maintained in healthful and happy activity until it is fairly worn out by old age Yet, surely, this is a matter of unspeakable importance to every one of us - Yours, c, COMMON SENSE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS Sir-This view of the function of prays put forth in to day's Argus by two well know and highly esteemed Anglican clergymen (fe it is not difficult to penetrate "JSL a disguise is a very high and noble one But it differs, I conceive entirely not only from that of your Ballarat contemporary, but also from that of the Church of England itself 1 or on turning to the Prayer book we find ourselves bidden in the prayer to be used in the time of any common plague or sickness' to beseech Almighty God to have pity upon us miserable sinners who now are visited with great sickness and mortality and that like as thou didst then (i c at the time of the plague in the wilderness and the pestilence in David s timo) accept of an atonement, and didst command the destroying angel to cease from punishing so it may now please thee to withdraw from us this plague and grievous sickness This prayer is quoted as most appropriate to the discussion but others of a similar tenor, especially the alternative one in the time of death or famine ' also seem to be based upon the simple and plain belief that if we ask God to stay the ram or pestilence He will do so This view of the matter is supported by the language of the alternative of thanksgiving for deliverance from plague or sickness, in which we thank God because he has been pleased upon our weak and unworthy humiliation to assuage the contagious sickness wherewith we have lately been affected ' Nothing in these petitions and thanksgivings gives colour to the supposition that the object of prayer in times of trouble is, as Mr. Handfield puts it to stimulate the conscience to regard as Bins the thoughtlessness and selfishness not tosayalBotho dishonesty which he behind the flagrant disregard of the principles of health " Historically speaking we know that such a supposition was not hold by the com- pliers of the Prayer book, and the belief is in fact a product of modern growth, put forward honestly enough, no doubt, by the eminent men whom Mr Handfield names at the end of his letter, because reason and conscience alike rejected the orthodox one. Applying the golden legal rule of interpret- ing words in their usual and ordinary moaning it cannot be said that God is not be- sought in these prayers to alter His laws at the intercession of His creatures, which laws, however, J. S L" yot says are "wise and beneficent " In no quirking or uneasiness spirit I ask "J S L' and Mr Handfield to reconcile the view of the object of prayer expressed its reconciliation is impossible *.
