"PAÄUAMATTA. ' * . I (From a Correspondent.) Tho nomination of tho Tlonorablo Ministor for Works, .Tamos "Byrnes, Esq., went oft* ..rory quietly on Tuesday lust. Thara was nu excellent attendance of electors, «nd tho Ifonoruhlo Momber was listened to with niarkod attention. It was currently boliorod that thoro would liavo been a contest, tho iniluonco of a few outsiders, inducing Mr Birmingham, (who had twico tried tho dodgo beforo at Sydney), to como forward. Sosing all hope, hopeless, hnwover, ho hauled down his uolours at tho 11th hour, nod tho ITuiiorablo .Tamos walked over the course, us boldly as over, defiant of all comors, mid rounds of applause, i MrJNioil'ATj ELECTION.-This approaching con- test-waxes warmor und wnrmor, every day. There uro already 7 nags in tho field, who aro declared starters, and aovor.il others will outer if a ghost of a ohanco is loft for tho ruco. Thoro aro howovor as follows :-Tho Knight of the Stool j Trotter; Calico; 3?Iamo; Stick, (Jato Knock 'om down) ; Cornstalk ; Lcuthor, and Merry Andrew. Latest Batting :-Knight of tho Steel, 1000 to 10 ; Trotter, 100 to 1 ; Culioo, 70 to 1 ; Flume, 20 to 1. Tho extraordinary performances of the old popular Knight, during tho last year, und particularly in his race for tho Oriental Stakes pf 1700 guiucas, as woll as the Retrenchment Stakes, hava rallied round him many udmirors aud firm friends, und ho ¡B consequently looked upon as nn easy winner. Trotters gallops havo always bron firm and steady, and his cusy going und indopondout itylo of running load his backers to IOOK upon him with much confidence for tho first or second placo in tho eontust. Calico is an un- tried horso, but his tniiuors ara never known-to turn out a bad ung, mid hu is oxpocted to tako at least third plaao. Of Flame, Stiok, Cornstalk, Leather, und Merry Andrew, but little known, oxoopt of Cornstalk, w ho wou a trial ruco somo years ago hut is a reluctant starter.
