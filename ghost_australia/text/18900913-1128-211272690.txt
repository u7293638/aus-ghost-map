It was in the fair sunlight of a May morn ing, in tiie year of Grace 1672, that that jfteat brave ship, the Golden Grove of Leith, floated her broad sails, with many a Jbj&tering; pendant and streamer above and stood proudly down ihe,Firth i.Eorto, designing to reach the open tena, not far from the btfl, well known, tjjpftiariners by Hie namnof the North Berwick Wkw. On board of the Golden Grove, I, Z&enard; Lindsay, then in my twenty-second I jM i. was, yon must know, a sailor, and I Mfcpe a bold one. My father was a fisherman, ra, aB I may say, his coble was my cradle. Smiy a rough rowing in truth it;bestowed honme, for it was his use even before. I Cj&ffi; go alone, to carry me with him a fito- m, wrapped up, it maybe, in a tattered sail, wrjmte my mother, with a creel upon her back, jdnrneyed through &e; landward towns, ana fd file houses of the gentry, to sell the spoil rf hook and net. ; . We fared hard and worked hard ; for ne fhpre industrious folk lived in the fisher-town of Kirk Lesliea pleasant and goodly spot, IflDg not far from the East of Nenk of Fife, ma old Davie Iandsay and Jess, his wits aj£l my mother. Many a wearynight and ijgjiaTC come and gone since I beheld that mm "whereon I was born ; but I can yet fiat my eyes and see oar. cottage and oar Imt— nealled the " Royal ThfsQ-— rocking- at five lee of the long rough, pier of -unhewn yjtnstone, gathered from the wild' maim" WOund, which ran into the sea and sheltered iablitue fisher harbour; formedby the burn ofDalwearie, where ifcjoins fin waters of its f»ek pools to the salt brine. . Opposite onr ItfnsB was. a pretty green bourook, as we tagledi that is to .say, a little luD, mostly ef raght green turf, yin. bunches of bent and , Hng giasB, which rustledwith a sharp sad jKpsa when the east wind Hew snell, stedereepiiig . coaly ' into the chimney neuk, WS woud bsten to the roaring of the see. But the.bourock was oftentimes brown ami sets or with wet sails stretched there to <Uy, and below it there lay, half-buiied in the sand, old boats, mouldering away, and aaastB'ana oars all shivered, bleaching like haar banes in jhesnn and the rain. 1 remember old Dane Lindsay my father weB. He was a . stern, big man, with a grisly grey beard, shaved bat once a month. No fisher on the coast had m surer hand for the taller or. a firmer gripe to haul aft the . sheet of tin in a fresh br&eze.and; a gathering MS. Often when we were iisingand falling on the easterly swell, half-a-score niiles fiom XSrk Leslie pier, he loved to tell me old- \- ararid tales and sing old-world songs of the MS. Then would he recount how the Sever V sank the bell which good abbot Ignatius, of Aberbrothwick, caused to be plased upon the Wild Bell Rock, as a .guide to poor mariners ; ad how the pirate dreed the weird— that is, underwent the fate — he had prepared for himself, and lost with shipand crew on that vary reef. Sometimes, too, he would drop lis voiee, and when I came dose to him, he would speak of great monsters in the sea ; of fibs ocean snake, whose head locked up at the i bridge of Starling, and whose tail, wont nine ; fifmes around theBass ; of'rtngiTig: mermaids \- who come upon the yellow sands at night, Mid begnfle men with their fain lays, till they leavehousa and home, being bewitched by the glamour of elfin palaces under the jbrine ; and, most terrible of all, of phantom with crews of ghosts, which sailors see by the pale glimmerings of the moon, when it shines through the 'driving agad, "upon a mik midnight and a roar- ! sea. Bat, then, if I was fright ened and cried, my father would straightway change the theme, and hurst "oat with a gflWg clear voice into some loud fishing song, aag,' what I loved better still, into some brave, , orient ballad, about the fair kingdom of : Sootland, and its gallant Icings and stalwart knights ; and of such, my favourite was the l«y of Sir Patrick Specs, for he was both a knight and a'saOor. The king site in Dunfermline tows, Drinking the blade-red wine, O wham will I get a steely skipper To sail this ship ef mine 4 Then up and spake an cldero kniabt, Sat at the king's right knee, 8ir Patrick Specs Is toe bests£lar Xhat ever sailed toe eea. _ Oh, I can yet hear my father's strong voice over the dash of the water and the aa$an of the wind, as he song the brave Mage of Sir Patrick tff Norzoway, to bring Itftne toe king's daughter; but his tones Wnld sink ana grow hoarse and low, when he chanted toe storm, and toe perishing of 21 the fair company on the voyage home. O. forty mile off Aberdeen TSsnfty fathom fee?. And there lies gndeSir Patrick Spena, Wi' the Boots lords at his feet. My father's long home was also the bottom oLthdsea. One wild March day, the coble left Kirk Leslie pier without me. I staid at hti&ie; mending a dredge-net with my fisher. The easterly bar was. on toe cgttt, that is to s-iy, thick eold mists aauakeen wind. As the son rose high so dij the tempest ; we could see nought sea- wtari, for the grey fog was out upon the water, but every wave came white, over and OVgr the pier, from eid.to end. My mother W8&t; to and fro, wan. and praying to her- sagE; as indeed did many another fisher- I wife, for they had great cause. The night Wits awful. I sat cowering beside my atotosr, who was rocking herself on a settle with her apron over her head; or now anc Wfr stole down to the beach, to where men tpodwith lanterns upon masts to show toe hdibcrar mouth to the poor folks at sea. Three boats, with crews pue and worn, made thp land before toe da y-t an hour after dawn war coble came tossing to thft outside belt of toe surf — but toe was Ijottom upwards. In a month after this, my mother and I west to her father's, a very old man, and a xeyerend elder of the kirk. . He sent me to school to Dominie Buchanan, a. learned carle, who by his own account behoved to be of toe race of the great Geordie Buchanan, oi whom tojev tell merry talee, which surely are Idle nd false, for he -was a severe, grave man, .fetyl handled the tawse unmercifully, as his mayal pupil, gentle King Jamie, ootdd in his tone well .testify. At school I was fliliymf., wnfl pleased master and friends. : - Afterwards, np to my sixteenth, birthday, I wept ranch a .fishing in .the boat of Saunders langglefiate, my maternal nncle, when de- riling to see nw»e df my conntry ihan could _be descried in our furthest voyages between Xhk Leslie pier and the deep-sea fisheries at the back of the Isle of Msj, X made'tcoany jfldgsting trips, for toe space of nearfiveyai,: -fit toe stoat brig J'.lAringstitoei, belonging' ' to Kutaddyj, dariiig vtoich tote I toice' Jviated the lhames arid the city of London ; : jfiyin& jalso onoe each y<to wito a.greatcargo irfherringsto Antwep, in the Low Countries.'

Indeed, X. pmst tell you that it is to toe exertions of that learned "«" that tola narrative is alto gether owing, for . he, seeing, as he was pleased to say, a more congenial soH in my mind for the seeds of his instructions than was presented by .the other fisher -boys, - took great pains to imbue me with a love for the humanities, which has not deserted me entirely until this day. Afar 'much ponder ing upon my "prospects, I toereftm finally made up my mind to offer myself oa hoard of toe Golden Grove, which I did, and waa accepted without more ado: My friends would have me pause and think of the dangers of unknown coasts, and pirates and robbers of toe sea ; but I knew Captain Jdhn Goxon, of the Golden Grove, to be a stoat and experienced seaman, and one who was readily trusted with rich freights — while as to freebooters, whea l looked upon toe amjr of culverins, demi- culverins, and fslconete ranged apon the deckB, andalso the show of cazatnnes and pafcterreroes placed about the masts, with many stoat feuows toman and wield them, I ieft we could tnd defiance to any rover who ever sailed eat of Bailee. Therefore, to make a long story short, we completed oar cargo, took in provisions and water, and, as has been said, on a fine May morning, I do not remember the exact- day, sailed. The wind was so fair that by even- fall we saw St. Abb's Igpd. And here at the outset of what was to me so adventurous a voyage, X would dee- eeribe my oaptain and my shipmates, as.wdl as the stent vessel herself, the latte- being indeed a brave eeafi, with top-gallant fore castle and high poop, surmounted by three great lanterns ; but, as the reader will shortly perceive, Sie Gddea Grove and 1 soon parted company, and X never saw either her cr Jmy of lier crew again. We earned the fair north wind with us all along the "English coast, until passing through the Straits of -Dover, we hade fare- well to the white cliffs. Then in two days' time we saw npon toe larboard bow great rocks which form toe cape caficd LaHogtte, in Franca, and passing to toe westward of toe island of Guernsey, sighted toe Btfle iflle of Ushant lying off the port «£>.Brest, where the French maintain fleets and great naval stores. Hereabouts the wind changed, veering roand to the westward, andspawly rolling in upon us billows so vast that we could well disoem that we were no longer in toe narrow -atea, bat exposed to toe great strength and fierceness of toe Atlantic or : Western Ocean.' Notwithstanding, however, we made good progress. ; The breeze was not steady, bat blew in squalls, «naArteg it often necessary to band topsails, sad raising great seething seas around us, over which toe Golden Grove rede, very gallantly. At nightfall on toe eighth day of our voyage, "ire. lost right of Ushant and entered into toe great Bay of Biscay. The sea here runs exceedingly nigh, tumbling into toe chore in great ridges of Hoe water ; bat with a stoat ship, well manned, toe natore of toe waves is not' so dangerous as that of toe ahert, hoiling saiges in toe North Sea. And now I come to toe accident which so sadly deter mined my lot for many a day. On toe morning of either the 13th or toe 14th May toe weather was squally and un settled, and the sea irregmar and high. About 3 o'clock, looking forth to windward, I saw a great blacknesn in the sky, which I took to be toe prelude of agost of no common strength. At the same moment the mate of toe watchordered toe topmen aloft to hand toe topsails we carrying at toe moment no higher canvas/ My atation was npon toe leeward fore-topsail jrardazm, and as I Hang by too manropes to me great creaking pieces of timbmr, grasjhig the fluttering canvas of toe saiL I thought I had never seen a finer right toaa toe great .rcOing ship below, wallowing and labouring in the white foaming seas, which would sometimes strike her and pour heavy masBea of clear green water in a flood over toe decks. When we were securing the sail, the tnotion aloft waa very great, we being violently swung from side to side in -each wire as aright wad make giddy even the grizzled head of an old manner. Meantime, the gust to windward was coming tost; toe blackness increased/and a rushing sound, as ef toe chariot wheels of a host, rose shove toe rede clamour of toe sea. Then, amid great showers of flying brine, whuh it drove be fore it, too fierce wind struck toe Golden Grove bodSy over upon her side. At toe same instant I heard a hoarse voiee below summoning the men from the yards down upon deck; bat as I was about to obey, toe tempest grew terrible. There were great Hoods of mmt above me, toioagh which I could see nought below bat toe white patches of waves breaking over the strong bulwarks of the ship. Suddenly toe canvas, which had not been quite seoared, was torn open, as & woe, with krad screech by toe wind, a®d flapped and banged so that I frit toe very mast shake and quiver violently, while I received mde blows from toe loose and flying ropes, insomuch 'as, being half Mined by that and the pelting of toe brine, I shot ray eyes, and bending down say head rwnennn nia vani fipmifwiii mw ovisac T TMin4ii J1WM.MAUAU.J A" Uin. «. 1 aave remrined thus three or four seconds, when Xheardtoeloodhowlof toe wind suddenly in crease toasort of eldfltch scream. In a moment, toe mast gave two violent jerks, and with toe third I heard five er six sounding twangs like the breaking of harp-strings, and imme diately a crashing of wood. Then, still Hing ing to toe yard, I "was hurried wito a mighty rush through the air, and suddenly plunged down into the choking brine, which rose all gurgling over my head, and I knew at the same time that toe Golden Grove had carried away her fore-topmast, and X was overboard in toe boiling sea. By instinct, X suppose, X straggled to climb apon the floating wreck so as to get my head and shoulders above water. Then I saw that I was alone in my misery. I have said that my station was at the enter end of toe yard, and X conceive that my shipmates most Have gained toe top, and from fhenee, X hoped, the deek. Bat as for me, X saw nought bat speedy drowning for my fate. The seas rose in great foaming peaks and pyramids around me, and the wind drove drenching toowers from toe erests of the waves down into the hollows. AK around gloomy clouds passed swiftly, torn by the sqnall ; bat the pitchy darkness which showed where its strength lay, was far down to leeward, and looking thereat as X rose upon a' higher sea than common, I faintly descried the ship in a crippled plight, hat having managed to put her helm np so as to scad before toe storm. She was already near a league away, and leaving me fast, . so that toe bitterness of death rose up in my very heart. For a moment I thought I might as well die at once, mid letting go my hold of the spars, I allowed myself to sink backward into toe sea. . Bat God has wisely made man to love life wito wito a clinging love, and to grapple wito death as wito a grim enemy. Therefore, as the water Hosed above me, and X felt suffocating, X could not help making a struggle, which soon replaced me on my desolate seat on toe floating wreck. I looked at toe spars, and saw that toe topmast had broken only about a foot beneath toe place to whieh the yard had been lowered. Nearly the whole of the fore top and toe top-gallant masts of toe Golden Grove, with toe frag- ' ments of the foretopsail, which had been rent almost into ribbon, and toe yard to which they were fastened lay therefore in the sea. I clambered in from toe end of toe yard, and took up my position where the mast and it crossed each other ; making myself fast thereto with one of . the numerous ends of broken rope which abounded, and for near an honrsatdiRmal and almostbroken-hearteti. un- heedfnl of how toe waves tossed me to and fro, or how. they sometimes- burst over and almost stifled me. . I was sometrhat roused by a feeling of wamth, and looking abroad saw that the clouds had b-roken, and that the sun was shining rightly" on the sea. The wind -was also abated, and the -waves not combing so violently, I was '.more at ease. .Then I heard that .terrible squad — the souna, of . toe sea alono— Whioh no. one hlistont' tb. Aave he. who has gwaiia far from, any :vessHj.or whD, :likejmelf, hw Hnngto.adriviiig epar. vOtn toe beato yon : 'hear'.toe surf, .where the -nriTes'.burst apon ' rock or sand; on "ribipbpard you.hfeartoe . dashing the WBo ws en counter and pniw: riUtiOm of-toe orise-r it is -as of a great mnHatninouB hiss, rising universally about you — the buzz of the fermenting and yeasty waves. There are no deep, hollow rumblings. Except for that hissing, seething sound, toe great billows rise and sink in silence; and you -look over a tumbling waste of blue or green water all laced and .dashed, «nd variegated. wito a thousand stripes, and streaks, and veins of white glancing froth, which embroider as it were wito lace, toe dark masses of heaving and falling ocean. Hearing this sound, and string this sig&t;, I tossed until the son got high and wafem. I felt no very pcignant anguish, for my soul was clothed, as it were, in a species ef lethargy — the livery of despair. Sometimes only X tried to pray, bat thoughts and tongue would grow benumbed together. Once, indeed, I was fat a lime aroused. 1 heard a shaip little dash in the water, and a soft quackle, as of a sea-fowl. Looking up, X descried betide me two ducks of that species which we, in.toe Scottish seas, called war- rots ; thev are white en the breast and neck, and brewn above, and have very bright, glancing, yellovr eyes. Moreover, they dive, and use their short wings under water, as other fowls do theirs in flying. By toe appearance of these creatures I knew that tend was, at farthest, within two days' sail. There — tilting gayly over each sea-toey swam for hours, seeming to look at me ; sometimes they would dive, bat they never weat far from toe wreck, always coming up . and riding head to wind, with their keen yellow eyes fixed, as I thought, npon the poor drowning mariner. Thgy seemed tame and fearless — -for, indeed, wh&t; should they dread from me I Once, in a sort of melancholy mirth, I raised my arm threateningly, but they stirred neither wing nor leg to floe, lifting over seas whieh would make a great man-of-war work and groan to her .very keel, hut which these feathered ships, built by God, could outride without a film of down being washed aside f mm" their white hreasfe. ' The. sun, having attained its zenith, began , to descend toe westerly does, and. toe afternoon waa fair and warm, the wind now Mowing but a summer breeze. Sometimes when en ths crest of a swell, I looked anxiously for a sail, hat I saw nought save toe bright 'horizon, against which, the sharp outlines of the waves rose and fell in varying carves and ridges, so tost now again I resigned myself to drato, and, covering my face with my hands, I, as it were, moaned, rather than sung mwardly . to myself, many verses of psalmjL which, when I waa bat a little child, I had repeated at my mother's knee. Meantime, I began . to feel a stiffen ing and a heavy drowsiness over all my limbs and upon my soul. When X opened my eyes the heaving waters turned into divers colours before my sight, so that I knew that my brain was" wandering, and that my soul waa de parting. Howbeit, a holy tranquility came (town upon me. The hlae sea appeared to melt away, and I saw— bat dimly — the green boaroek and the sweet, soft swaraed.links of toe' Balwearie born, with, toe brown Tierring nets drying, en toe windy grass. The place seemed holy and still ; toe sun was hot, and none were stirring, and presently X knew it was a summer Sabbath day, for trom oat toe open windows of the grey old kirk there came a low sound of psalmody, mid I heard, as it were, in my brain, the voices oi£the congregation, as they sang — In Judah'a land God ib well T town, Bis name in L<raef s great, In Salem is his tabernacle, In 2&an.; is His seat. After this,, there camo on -me silence and darkness, I having gradually fallen into a fit or trance. \- I was zoosed by rude shocks and polls, and a confused clamour of voices. Opening my eyes wito effort, I saw surging npon the broken water. Hose to theBpars, a ship's boat with men, one of whom — he -who rowed the boat oar— had grasped the collar of my eea doublet, and was hauling me into toe pinnace, in which effort he succeeded, ere I could well make out whereabouts I was. At the same time several voices asked; in two different la nguages, what was my name and country, and bow I came there. Now, ef both, of these tongues I had some smattering, the one being French and the other Jjow-Xhitoh, of whito I had heard and picked np somewhat in my several voyages np the rivar Scheldt to Antwerp. £ therefore, trying to master my senses, replied truthfully that my name was Leonard Lindsay — that I was a Scotsman, a mariner «f toe ship Golden Grove of Xriih, where- /rom -I had fidlea overboard, to qpar to which X clung having been, as, indeed, they might perceive, blown away in tempestuous weather. At this tbey consulted in a low tone amongst themselves. Tbey were all seafaring men, mostly very swarthy, and tanned fay the sun and the wind. They wore long black hair, and silver and grid earirngs, which glanced amid their greasy earls. Only two were fair and blue- eyed — namely, the men who first addressed me in flemish AM I A ftnw VMaHMtatefli f n v A/wwii. dxtwa aouimuui AVI « K/LMU uwe beside toe spars, and seeming to consult as to whether toey were worthy to be made a prize of, they decided in toe negative, and dipping their oars into the water, rowed away, toe steersman narrowly watching toe fan of toe seas, so as to avoid being broached to and' swamped. In toe meantime, X had clambered from toe bottom of toe boat., and looking over the bows, saw, not more toaa a third ef a mile from us, a hark, which appeared to he both small and frail to con tend with such a sea. The manner of her rig was new and strange to me, for she carried two masts, both very stoat and short, and above them were two great supple yards, upon which was spread a good show of canvas, each sail being of that trinagular form, called by the seamen who use them, lateen. In fine, the ship belonged to a port on the Mediterranean coast of France, and was of the class named feluccas. It was necessary to approach the Tassel with great eaation, inasmuch as toe rolled and surged excessively. We therefore came slowly up, under her lee quarter, and a man, of very dark complexion, and the fiery est I eyes I ever saw. jumped up upon the gdn- vrale, and hailed the boat in French, bat talking so rapidly, that I could make nothing of it. Then, a line having been thrown on hoard, it -was made fast to me, and without more ado, I was soused . into toe sea, and dragged on hoard the felucca, where I lay pantmg on toe deck, while toe crew— very wild and fiercp-looking saiiors — amuBed them selves wito my wretched appearance. Presently, however, tthe man who had hailed the boat, and who seemed to have great authority on board, came up to me, and putting the yeet aside, said more deliberately than before, but still in French, and with a peculiar accent — " You are not, then, a Spaniard r5 I mastered my few words of ".French, and answered, that — "1 was not, .bat a Scots man," Without more ado, he stooped overjme, and searched my pockets. They contained some small English coins, being groats and silver -pennies, and also a letter, which . Oaptain Swanson, of the Jean; Livingstone, had. written -to. me to Leito. The sight of "these things appeared to satisfy his donbts, for he spoke a few;" words in a kinder tone to those about him, and presently leaving me, a man dressed in a tarnished livery, like a lackey, brought me a great cap of hot dis tilled waters, which I greedily swallowed, and found myself comforted and refretoed. Bring, however, much exhausted from the length of time which I bad passed in the water, I laid me down upon a heap of sails in the forecastle, and being taken bat little notice of, -thanked God, inwardly, for my deliverance, and began to drop off to sleep. Only beforehand, like a sailor, I -observed toe coarse of toe ship. The wind being westerly, and toe bemg Hose -hauled, and labouring heavily to- windward, X deemed, \ and wito troth, thatfier destination must be I across toe. Atlantic. But whithersoever toe : went, with my then feelings, mattered little. : I was saved from au eariy death, .and grate- : fid -for .my epe, I fell ,into a deep and \- . sskemed it was dark right, and I Jthe firat watchwaS eet- As the wind, how- j ever,'was now vezbsteadyand the sea mbt :<mlyiQwer"bnt iegaUt, the men were mostly ty'finfldbring 'about- top deck,exeept;he I 'fetriirikhdlieThLat steered:"' Seeing hm | itri, 6 BaflOT pretoi came to me into a . ,|PI ? = lantern in Ws-hand, andyflSTiny great Joy, addressed me in. JBnglito, »kiT»g me from from whence I came, and toe particulars of my disaster. Having shortly informed him, X requested that he would tell me what the ship was which, had rescued me, and what manner of treatment X might expect at toe-hands of the captain and crew. At first, he made as if he would put off tailing of these matters, but as I was importunate, he asked main torn, whether I had not heard of the great association of men of all nations, but principally Englishmen, French men, and Hollanders, who carried on a con stant warfare wito toe Spaniards »w»rwig toe islands of the West Indies, and along the coast of Darien, sometimes even crossing that narrow neck of land, and descending wito fire and award upon Panama smA other towns sf the South Sea. To this I replied, that certainly I had heard of these companies, bat only very partially and nothing distinctly, that they were, I suppose, the adventurers eaQad Fubnstiers or Buaoaneers, and more anciently the " Brethren of toe Coast." My new friend made answer moodily, that I should most probably have ample means of learning more ofthese Freebooters ere I put my foot on British ground again — "That is, says he, " after you have either escaped or served your time." - These phrases naturally threw me into great trouble, and I earnestly asked what he signified by them. "Why," he replied, "that you will be eHd as an apprentice, or in other" words, as a slave, to the French West India Company, in toe Isle of Tortogas, on the northern coast of Hispaniola, whither we are bound." At these words ' I grew sick at heart. " Better," I said, " to have allowed me drown in that sea than to have rescued me only to sell me into slavery." Not so,' answered ray companion, some thing Btenuy. " Yon are young, and have a thousand hopes before yon. The band that miraculously preserved you this day is ever stretched out in wisdom and mercy, -readier to brip than to chastise." |X» SB eOSnSCKD.)
