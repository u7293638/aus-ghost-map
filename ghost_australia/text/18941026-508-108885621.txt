GHOSTS AND HOBGOBLIN'S. ' To the Editor of tfc Evening Newt, Sir,— X -was more than pleased when reading your leading article to-day on ' Spook*,'' and tke manner you dealt with the partaeB that Mr- Alfred G. Edward* 4e*i?*d to chMnpiop, and I regret to sty each people generally manage to influwioa a certain cotetie of parsons to assist them in carrying oat their so-called spiritttalistie seances, pot only m Sydney bet in many other places. Qhettm am not in the habit at eating ohooolate em&s; ! Yet we hear of otte lately in Sydney «oniag forward and upon invitation accepting and eating some. Bahi hnmbog! This is a little too muoh to listen to. If those whopre tecd they have power over theBe spirits they solicit to appeal will produce tbem in daylight, where there can be no d*cep* tioa pmctrfBtd, X will, it permitted, go and see that even in daylight there is xzo fraud or Blight- of-handtrieta»ry resorted to ; and to prove this I most have permis sion to lay hold of and handle the sup posed ghost. From the time I was a child, in Ireland I heard ex traordinary stories «f ghosts and fairies, but I thssk Ged I had parent* who taught »e that there were no such things, so I grew up in the strength of tbe teach ing I received, to laugh at tbe idea of such things as ghosts, banshees, fairies, pook*s, lepracauns, -?r any other of tbe spiritualistic tribe. Although being out late at night and in the early dawn travelling over upland and moor, passing by Baths when ghosts and fairies were said to nightly assemble, I never saw one in my lifetime, but I caught a live .ghost once under tha following oforamriuiaas i Wbendoiog business in Cork, I think in 1853, an old lady belonging to the Society of Friends died, and waff tmried. After her death it was stated she wished to be interred in the taxji&g-gr0und; ot anc£ii0r cle&oroinaiiQfi;, aixd, being dffesatls* Sad at where she *w burled, she took to stone-throwing, to the great smtoysaos of tlie people near tfee graveyard. Hearing thifc X laughed at the etory.and afterward* mads one of th»e to try and 'lay' tht ghostr-the tergeast of potto* who had the matter in hand, a young friend of the de geaiMlsad the writer. The ghost gone* r*liy commenced opemttoM between 9 and 11 o'clock.

It was all no use, but I was obliged to upset her i» order more surely to secure her. I whistJed, and the sergeanfwd my friend oawe running to me.
