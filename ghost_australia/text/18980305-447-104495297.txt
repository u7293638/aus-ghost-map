Sign of the Harp. AFTER LONG YEARS. Dear, whom I would not know , If I passed you on the street, So long and long and long ago Are the days when we used to meet, You may be glad to hear That somewhere out of the blue Come vague, sweet dreams that bring you near, , That I often think of you. Tliat now and then I thrill At a rustle in tho dark ; .That I start as the wind sweeps over the hill, As I see the fire-fly's spark. Somebody stepped on my grave 1 Or somebody slipped out of yours ? I cannot tell ! There are ghosts that crave A bit of the love that endures,
