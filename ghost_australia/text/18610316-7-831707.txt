VERY WIDE OF THE MARK." To the Editor of the Advertiser. Sir Permit me to draw your attention to list Thursday's therein, and to remarks made on a letter signed " Catholicus," published in last Tuesday's Advertiser. After you have read the comment, perhaps you will not object to allow a correspondent the opportunity of replying to this literary oracle, in the few following sentences The Thursday Review has misinterpreted the letter of " Catholicus " published in your paper of Tuesday last. My Protestant fellow-colonists need be under no apprehensions ; nothing serious is contemplated, as the Thursday Review would endeavor to insinuate. The JRcriew has conjured up some ghost of its own imagining, and wishes to frighten people with the demon that he? lately taken such stronghold of his own faculties, evident from the symptoms its recent writings have disclosed. "Catholicus" is no neophyte, and God preserve him from ever being a pervert ; he is not the person supposed. He always was and hopes to die CATHOLICUS. Port Adelaide, 15th March, 1861. [A paragraph in the last number of the Thursday Review indicated, in a sort of pain, the supposed author of the letter signed " Catholicus." The re- viewer was, however, mistaken and now having allowed " Catholicus " the explanation he desires, the matter must drop-Editor.]
