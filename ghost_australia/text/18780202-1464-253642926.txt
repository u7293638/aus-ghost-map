THE AUSTRALIAN URIAH HEEP. On Friday the worthy Commissioners met ; There were Samuel, Sir Alfred, and Hay ; There were Busby, and Calvert, and others a host, With bosoms exalted and gay. There came to the meeting, with countenance wan, And aspect as meek as a sheep Augustus the " 'Umble " â€” he looked to the life A lineal descendant of Heep. So modestly stroking the brim of his hat He looked very far from at ease ; He'd a " tear in his eye like a travelling rat," And a weakness affecting his knees. He stood on one leg like a cochin at roost, And he blushed to the roots of his hair ; And he seemed to imagine he hadn't the ghost Of a shadow of right to be there. His breath came in gasps, like the snorts of a whale ; His aspect was such as to give One the notion he thought it a favor that they (The Commission) allowed him to live. He looked so excessively 'umble, in fact, That he silently seemed to imply That he was, if the worthy Commissioners pleased, Most perfectly willing to die. " Augustus, Augustus, why look you so sad ?" Said Holt in encouraging tones ; And a shiver ran right down Augustus' spine, And spread through his marrow and bones. But, bracing his nerves, with an effort at last, He up, and he spake to the host ; But his aspect was meagre and wan, and his voice Was as hollow as that of a ghost. He felt 'twas an honour too great for himself By some dozen or so of degrees, To have lodging and board in the Place de Concord, The Boulevards, or the fair Tuilleries. He said he was used to a simple cuisine, And 'twas easy enough to divine That at banquets of turtle with fat that was green, He was scarcely adapted to shine. He said that though omelettes were all very well, He was used to boiled mutton and beer ; And he couldn't, he knew, look the sort of a swell A Commissioner ought to appear. In fact, it was certain ; he told them, in fine, j That Bailey and Cooper's baboon i Would be more at his ease in a Methodist Church Than he in a Paris saloon !
