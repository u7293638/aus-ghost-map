HOW A GOOD SHIP WAS LOST. On the night of October 27th, 1842, the good ship 'Mary Compton,' of Bristol, England, was struggling with a fearful gale off the coast of North America. The wind blew furiously, but the weather was clear, and the Captain expected every moment to get sight of the light in the lighthouse on the Iron Rock Shoals, This lighthouse marked the entrance to the harbour. Once there, and they were safe. Sure of his position, he sailed on confidently. Five minutes later the Bhip Btruck with a fearful shock and went to pieces. Four men, including the Captain, were Baved. On reaching the shore they found a strange thing had happened. An enemy of the lighthouse keeper had bound him hand and foot and extinguished the light. Souls, as well as ships steer by the lights, Hope is the most important lighthouse in the world. What shall be said of the man who darkens it in the face of a storm-tossed spirit ? ' You are beyond human aid.' These words were used by a physician to a woman who had come to consult him. Admitting that he thought so, had he the right to say so ? No ; for he might be wrong—and in any case he had no business to put out the light. This woman had been ill for some time. In June, 1889, she had been greatly alarmed by her symptoms. Her heart palpitated, and she was so giddy she could scarcely stand. Her head whirled ' and,' she said, ' all objects Beemed to go into a cloud,' She had to hold herself up or sit down for fear of falling. She broke out into a sweat although cold as derttb. A dreadful cough racked her frame so that the could not lie down in bed and Bleep. ' I could scarcely crawl about the house,'she Eays, 1 1 was so week. I tried different remedies and medicines without aavil, I went to the Dispensary at New Briggate and asked the doctor to tell me the worst. His answer was, 'I have mixed ' you some medicine ; you can take it or leave it. I took it for lliree weeks, then gave up in despair. 'I talked with two other physicians. The last one said, ' Vou arcpast human aid.' ' My heart sank within me, for I had five little children, and my death would leave them without a mother's love and care. I went home and cried till 1 was sick. I had no appetite and had lost flesh till I was thin as a ghost! My mother came to see me and did not know me. My skin was of a green and yellow colour, and when I ate anything it seemed to stick in my throat. About this time I commenced vomiting, and what I threw up was tinged with blood. Once I began to vomit at nine o'clock on a Saturday morning, and scarcely got any rest from it until Monday morning. ' At this time I remembered that Mrs. Wilson, with whom I formerly worked in Crawford's Mill, in East Street, Leeds (where I live), had been cured by Mother Seigel's Curath e Syrup. So I sent to Mr. Jesson's, the Chemist, in Great Garden Street, and got a bottle. A few doses stopped the vomiting, and by degrees from day to day I felt better. Soon I could eat a dry cruet, and by the time I had finished the second bottle I had got over all my bad sjmptoms, and was fast getting my strength back. I am now (April, 1890), in better health than ever before in my life. ' I should have taken Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup sooner, but my husband was out of work and we had only a trifle coming in from his club, but I thank God I did get it at last, and it cured me, bad off as I was. All my friends and neighbours know the facts I have related, and I will reply to any letters of enquiry.' (Signed), Mrs. Ann Mills, 40, Bread Street, York Road, Leeds. This was a case of indigestion and dyspepsia, with symptoms showing how far it had affected the nervous system. A few months, or possibly weeks more, and Mrs. Mills would have had no tale to tell. She did wrong to wait one hour for any reason, after having known what Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup had done for her friend Mrs. Wilson. •
