THE GHOST. . town EDITOR or no atnccKY. I SIR-I was extremely sorry to see in this morning's paper that the ghost' had again made his appearance, and that he has nothing to fear from guns being used. Would it not be better for the police to be authorised to use firearms, as they do to run- away prisoners and to let the ghost know that he was in danger of becoming . verit- able ghost at any rate, such pranks should be stopped. How many nervous people might not be made ill through it? Such things have before now caused death and insanity. Only the other day I heard of two young girls who had been made very ill through his appearing to them. I writers to hope that the villain will shortly receive the just reward of his mia deeds.
