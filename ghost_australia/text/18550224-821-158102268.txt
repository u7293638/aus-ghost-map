** TE SUUAXTEH>"S Ef EJTGLAJTD." irom Icff, of the l< neuters tn the Crimea, to Mm, of the Grenadiers, at St. James's. k c suoattcrns in England, Who live a life of case, How little do you think upon Our sufferings o'er the sea*. To eup, lunch, dine, aud lunch again, Upon fried pork we go, And three-deep, we've to sleep, In the trenches, all a-row, With the batteries roaring loud and long, Four hundred guns or so! The ghosts of clothing colonels Would shudder in their graves; For no two of us are rigged the same. And scarce a fellow shaves. Light cavalry and heavy swell Black as coal-heavers show; You can keep clean so cheap. But here a tub's no go; For water you've to shell out strong. And then it's salt, you know. Out here we need no boot-jacks, For in oar boots we sleep. One never sees a dressing-ease, And liair-brushe6 are cheap. Deuce a cigar one gets to smoke; Short pipes we're glad to blow; And we door rum from store, As we can't have Rourdeaxâ€” The point is something short and strong. Although it may below. But round the flag of England We'll our last cartridge burn, Till we have made the Russians smart, And victors home return. Then, when, as veteran warriors, At fete and ball we show, With the fame of our name. The ladies' hearts will glow, And while you swells are voted bores, The pace, oh, shan't we go 1
