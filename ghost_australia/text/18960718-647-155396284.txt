WANTED— MORE RECEPTIVENESS. By Eev. J. G. Greenhough. Do not all our churches and congregations need at this time, and at all times indeed, just this — more receptive power? We are not straitened in Him or in His gifts, but in ourselves. Behind every new missionary effort there is somewhere a new Pentecost, a grand receptive hour, when heaven opens to send down a fuller measure of grace, and the heart of the Church is wonderfully enlarged to take it in. Behind William Oarey and the modern missions there were the Wesleys and Whitfields and the great Evangelical revival. Behind the Moravian missions there was that wonderful opening of the heart to the Holy Ghost known — perhaps vulgarly — as German Pietism. Behind even the Jesuit missions there was a strange new revelation, an unsealing of vision given to few men like Xavier and Loyola, of the entrancing beauty of Jesus. Behind every forward movement there is an inrush of Gross power and of the Holy Ghost, a Church throbbing, thrilling, excited, burning with the consciousness of its privi leges and the sweets of Jesus' love ! And then from a hundred lips there comes a cry 'Here am I; send me!'; and from a thousand lips leaps the song, Oh, that the world might taste and see the riches of His grace ; The arms of love which compassed me would all mankind embrace. You pray that Christ's people may give more. Yes ; but oh, ask first that God's gift may come more abundantly into them. Perhaps the best of all missionary prayers is that which the old Psalmist taught us : ' Cause Thy face to shine upon us.' Why upon us ? you say ; is that a prayer for the heathen? Yes. 'Cause Thy face to shine upon us, that Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations. God, even our own God, shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.' Freely'you will have received and 'freely lyou will give.
