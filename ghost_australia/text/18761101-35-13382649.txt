The command of our Lord to His Apostles, when he said unto them, "Go to me all the world, and pre which the Gospel to every creature, ' is as binding on the Church to day as it was when it was first given How many of our fellow men are still in a state of heathenism and are thus perishing for lack of the knowledge of the all sufficient -about, the Lord Jesus Many of them are in the midst of us there are still some rerun nts of the aborigines of the former lords of the soil of our sable neighbours who inhabited this sunny island continent when it was a terra incognita to our ancestors There are also sojourning at ith us numerous Chinese, most of whom are idolaters, and are without the knowledge of the only hung and true God We have also close at our doors comparatively many thousands of the heathen scattered over the numerous islands of the South Pacific From all of these heathen peoples, tribes, and ton_*UPS, the cry may be heard ' Come over and help us ' That cry we have heard, and have been enabled to render a little help May the Lord git ous both the heart and power to do more in spreading the glorious light of the Gospel among those who are sitting in darkness and the region and shadow of death. Our ministry has comprehensive relations It touches on all the laws of right and wrong and sweeps in its embrace the ten thousand shades (of morality and conscience their loyalty to our Lord we ought to aim at guiding and moulding public opinion Gnr M istor claims as His po sessions all the kingdoms of this world All the customs of men, all the laws of men, all the pursuits of men, all the amusements of men, ought to be pleasing to the Lord Jesus ought to be in subservience to the promotion of the interests of that kingdom which He has founded upon the earth. We should therefore, as a Church endeavour to produce sound, healthful, and exalted sentiments in the minds and hearts of the whole community Opinions moto and keep in motion malaria measure the actions of people both individually and collectively Lot there be divinely approved opinions, which must ever be of a salutary character entertained by the people at large, and their practice shall be all the more in accordance with the holy will of the Most High How needful, therefore, that the Church should put forth every effort to produce in the minds and hearts of the people sentiments which shall tend to lead to a Godly practice, and to most beneficial social results Thus, how much does it become us to throw around the Christian Sabbath all the sanctity placed upon it by its du ino author that on that holy day all ordinary labour, travelling, and receipt on should be at sided in obedience to the will of the Master, and in the interests of man's best wellbeing alike Thus too how much does it become us to point out the evils of intoxicating liquors which prove in so many cases, and among all classes of people such an awful CHrse in the land. Thus, also, how much does it become us to bring to light the heavy responsibility inseparably connected with the possession of property, which is never absolutely our own. At the best we are but stewards of it unto the Lord Jesus, and if we do not give to him in support of the claims of His kingdom and of the poor, who shall be alway s with us, then we shall be held to be unprofitable servants fit only to be gathered as fares to be burned, and our giving should be in proportion to our means of giving. Thus, likewise, how much does it become us to combat the scepticism which may prevail, to sweep away the cobwebs which profane and Godalming mes may throw around the Bible- that grand old book-that leaves lighted torch lighted for the guidance of men amidst the moral and spiritual darkness of this evil world Thus we should not only bench, as we delight to do, the sublime and gracious doctrines of the Bible, but we should also give some little prominence to the ample | ey dome which we possess of the authenticity and genuineness of the Bible, in order to confirm the faith of our people, and in order to show cause why the enemies and assistants of the Bible ought to be silent and ashamed At the present moment there is a question before the public mind in regard to the introduction of the Bible into the State schools of this colony in such a question as this we cannot but be deeply interest el, as ministers and elders of the chum Author of that most blessed Word Whether theBibl»mat be sanctioned by the Legislature as a text book in the Public schools of the land or not yet we all most devon lv pray that all school children within the territory may be brought under the ins ruction aid power of the Bible Thus we all most earnestly desire the Bible to be habitually used by the young so that their hearts and consciences may be enlightened and purified by its hallowed influences We are all agreed thus far Nay, we believe we are all agreed that, were there no obstacles in the way, it would be a good and proper thing that the Bible shi and be used as a text took in all our Public schools But at this stage of the question possibly four of us may differ in opinion it is to be hoped, however that such difference of opinion may soon pass away or we think the supposed obstacles in the way of the Bible being introduced into the State schools are not insuperable Without entering into details, we express the opinion, that were the office bearers of all our Protestant denominations to endeavour to give effect to their c evictions as to the desirableness of the daily use of the Bible in our Public schools, then the apparent imprac- tical list of the thing would be found to finish as quickly as the mist on the mountain bro v before the rising sun Never let it be paid that we would put a bin upon God's holy A\ ord from entering any other x i, rather let us help to scatter the leaves of it wide up the Polo, as the leaders of that tree whit h are for the hearing of the national Thus our Church should be conspicuously on the side of the Bible of holiness op righteousness, of pence of Fohnetv of industry, of liberty, and of humanity and she should by her teaching, example, and influence be instrumental in induc- ing the people to applaud and to practice all these Christian virtues Our Church ve readily acknowledge has a missions mission given to her by her bind the Lad causes in s i n most glorious and most important, the fulfils cat of which will bring " Glory to God in the highest and on earth price good will toward men ' This mission we avon should be fulfilled, should be energetically faithfully and heartily f filled Grant that the Church sets befo e her the task, and is resolved to perform it, yet in order to this we have several urgent requirements We need at once additional ministers and additional funds the Lord 13 not unmindful of us I from time to time. He Bonds to us some of His servants from a distance, educated and trained, qualified and prepare to help its in carrying on the work of the ministry within the pale of our united Church Nor does he leave us altogether without water at rose rees Are have still room for more-" pious and learned mini-ter«-m,n who may be both able and willing to minis- or at the altars of the Lord wherever H may dine' them. There are vacant tes to be filled and numerous Bphoreso11 immaterial usefulness not yet o cupiel, told taken up by us There are, cities where we have never yet had any of our ministers sett od 1 it will see some outfit to be Besides there are per e at or trees where up his of ministers but where we ought to hay > more Some minister in space and for the extensive In some instances where there is only one linnistT there ought to be two, or three, or even more, in order that the important work to be done in such a di rest must be ssmewhatado.uately overtaken The have t truly is plenteous but the labourers are few It bec nes us therefore to pray to the Lord of the hn trait that he will band forth labourers into his harvest ' Thus we pray to the Lord to send to us doth more men and in from not for the use of that portion of His sanctuary which is entrusted to our peculiar care Prai c- is a mighty letter in moving heaven and in promoting the interests of Christ s kingdom noon the earth AVu would much rather- expatiate on the spiritual aspects of the Church he. would infinitely rather speak of the beauty of' holiness of the blessedness. of the saints and of the stones of Immanuel s Land, than on the scaffolding on which we to omit to the attainment of the e things but dust constrains us to come down and handed the cords and st likes and nails of the tabernacle of (God in the midst of us It would, indeed be delightful to soil on the wings of faith and prayer along the banks of the River of Life, clear as crystal which is in the Pnrnd set of God as etc but we must return, and attend to the business of the Church below Well, then, we desire that the cranes wheels of our beloved Zion may roll --northland majes locally through the length and breadth the land and is seas charlot mils that the blessings of the Gospel may be scattered richly on every "side. In order to this we need a large increase of gold Le. men say what they will in regard to our Church s wants -.-? ever that her usefulness is greatly, tea la.trentsblr, marred for the lack of an adequate sum of money for d -tribution For the want of gold She is adopted in all her movements-in her most vital c-ncms,-yea in her honest and 1 latest aspirations AA o li axe various Church finance schemes in existence all of them good, day essential, for the health and prosperity of our ecclesiastical organization All of them should be well supported, and others should be called into being Among others there is one which should be created as soon as oncttcablc We refer to a scheme on behalf of aged and infirm man stars There are such schemes in con- ned len with the home Churches Several ministers of the Church, when they left their fatherland and came to this country, forfeited all right to and participation in the benefits of such a fund even though they might stand in need of it in which they had a dam while ministers at home Could we do without such a scheme it would be well But we fear such a thing cannot be Let us contemplate the condition of our Church, and we think we shall find their needs in this respect here will soon appear to be as great in proportion as those in other and older established Churches elsewhere All our mind term in all our horses should be made to feel that the Church care for them as the servants of the Lord, call and act apart from worldly business to minister wholly unto the Lord in behalf of the people that should any of them suffer in the Master's service that their sorrows and trials shall thrill the hearts of the brotherhood, that should they work faithfully for Christ that their work shall be acknow- ledged by His people and that they shall not be left a neglect and wretchedness in the case of infirmity or sickness, or old age AA o are sorry to have to say our Church finance schemes, however good year however excellent and neces sart, languish for the want of funds Our claims cannot be met nor can the expectations of many of our ministers be realised as the circumstances of the case would demand I has for the want of funds we cannot help as we ought many of our weak congregations and the minutes thereof have heavy burdens to bear Thus for the want of funds we cannot cheer on, as otherwise we might, many of our hard- working ministers amid their numerous toils and anxieties Yet on the whole they are found doing the work of the ministry with earnestness, affection, and magnanimity as humble, intelligent, Christian gentlemen We have a church and manse buildings here which ought to be of paramount importance. In many charges suitable church buildings cannot be got without extraneous financial help, and for the want of such buildings, and in consequence of the burdensomeness connected with the efforts put forth by such congregations to obtain them, the moral and spiritual aspects of the ministry in such cases are greatly and lamentably frustrated In order to remedy this state of things, might it not be a most desirable thing to institute on a great general Church scheme distinct from all the others, to be for the purpose of assist- ing all our particular schemes ?> From such a fund aid might be obtained in behalf of our church extension scheme, and in behalf r four church and manse building scheme, including liquidation of debt on Church property, in behalf of supplementing small stipends, and in behalf of the necessities of aged and infirm ministers. Should the Church in its wisdom see meet to inaugurate such a scheme, we conceive it would be desirable to aim at raising within a reasonable period of time a capital sum of not less than six 000. This might be done by appeals and deputations with the view of calling out special subscriptions and legacies from the people at large and the rich in particular We rejoice to find that several of our people remember, both in their wills and otherwise the interests of learning, culture, and science. We would like, however, that our good friends who may be disposed to give donations for worthy objects, or who may be regulating the diet sal of their wealth after their demise, to know that their own Church, and their fathers', stands in much need of their gifts and bequests and that in our opinion he claims are not one whit behind those of any other institution either in this land or in any other nay more, that we are all under deeper obligation to promote the interests of our Church which, even with all her faults, is set up for the glory of Christ and the salvation of men we say we we are all under deeper obligation to promote the interests of our Church than any other object whatever. If the resources of wealth which are in possession of the members and adherents of our Church do not issue forth very freely in hills and streams to refresh and fertilise the fields of our Zion if the blessed work which we have at heart is much impeded for the lack of such golden waters, yet the Lord can change all this . For after all the cattle on a thousand hills are His and ten thousand rivers of oil are His, tea,' the earth is the Lord 's, and the fulness thereof ' It is He who can give to His profession" people the generous he art and the liberal hand, into His hands, therefore, we desire to commit our Church with all its interests She may have minute wants, defects, and blemishes, let me wish to look upon them all with a kindly eye, and whatever they may be they shall not prevent us from loving her, and labouring and praying that she may be highly honoured to be eminently instrumental in doing good in the present generation, and in generations yet unborn. "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us and brought our Church out of many straits The gates of hell have not yet proceeded against her, no nor ever shall Many a conflict she has already passed through, and many a sorrow she has already exp rtenced Oft has she been rocked upon a son of troubles. There have been dissensions within her palaces and assaults without yet, by the good hand of our God upon her, she has endured them all, and she is more vigorous to-day than she had ever been for doing service in the Christian warfare. Nor is her warfare accomplished. "Rise! for the day is passing The, sound that you scarcely hear Is the enemy marching to battle Arise ! for the foe is here ' Stay not to sharpen your weapons, Or the hour will strike at last, When from dreams of a coming battle, on may wake to find it past " Our Church has within her bosom numerous elements of vitality, strength, and blessedness Let us, therefore, have courage The good old Gojpe' resounds from her pulpits, the laws of Christ are being published by her many faithful followers of the meek and lowly Jesus are watershed pile, prayer and praise arise daily from the hearths of not a few of the- people not a few of her members have faith in her future glorious destiny not a few of them believe that though she his been afflicted and tossed upon many a wave, ye he shall EOjn'r or later appear amidst the various institutions of the land, whether sa red (r civil, in the enviable position of being clothed with divine grace, lovelies s, and all moral attractions - the n knowledged refuge of the o*. re seed guide of the simple and custodian at once of Chistian instruction, order, liberte, r n 1 friendship Our ck sing words shall be Grace, mercy and peace from the Father, Son and Holy Ghost " to all evangelical Chur here. (Applause ) Several formal matters of business were transacted, and the sederunt was closed with prayer by the M derator.
