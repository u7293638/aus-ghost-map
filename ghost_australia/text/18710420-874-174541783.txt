THE LAST APPEAL. MURTHER! but, GAVAN, come home wid me now; The clock in the stapel shtrikes one; Bad luck, yees did promis that yees wud come home So soon as yer canvass wor done. Yer footsteps are weary, and blood-shot yer oise, And yer faytures despondingly look: Div yees think that the mimbers intind afther all To rally round yees—wid a hook? GAVAN, deep GAVAN, come home wid me now; Be the powers, it is noigh upon two: Yees have badgered thim all so persistently that There can be prishus little to do; And what is the "tot" av the promishes made— Av the votes yees are loikly to win; What! wapein, me GAVAN! Oh, is it because MACMAHON is sure to go in? GAVAN, poor GAVAN, rip home wid me now! Hark asthore, but it's jist shtrikin three; Now don't yees git into a pelther, me bhoy, And lash out loike blazes at me. Oi know that the thruth is a sharp, bitther pill, And yet it is best yees shud hear; For all oi can gather, oi don't think yees have The ghost av a chance, GAVAN dear!
