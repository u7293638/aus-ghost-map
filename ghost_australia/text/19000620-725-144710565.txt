WHEN FATHOMS DtfEP. A sailor tells the story of a diver who saw two ghoBts. He had gone down to the wreck of a large steamer and was' crossing the main saloon when two gray shapes of enormous Biz e came ambling towards him. He did not wait to make notes, bnt gave the daneer signal and was nulled ud. Told in the cheerful light of the day, tit | seemed rather a lame story, so another direr went down to see what he could make of it. Towards him also came the ghostly gray shapes. He stood irresolute for a moment and then, going boldly forward, straek his hatchet through â€” a mirror ! ; The ghosts were only a dim reflection of his own legs, much enlarged, of course, as everything is that a diver sees through the frontal eye of his helmet.
