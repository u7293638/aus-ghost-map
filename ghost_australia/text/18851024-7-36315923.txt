TO THE EDITOR. I am, &c.;, JOHN WESLEY GHOST. Adelaide, October 23. Sir—"C.T.s " letter in the Advertiser of this date is a fine illustration of the saying, "that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good." The censor of Methodism should at least acquaint niiuelf respecting the facts upon which he comments. He says, "One hundred years ago John Wesley was -ex pelled from the Church of England for follow ing the dictates of his conscience," fox Thia 16 a startling revelation. WQI "C.T." inform those who have hitherto believed that Mr. Wesley never' was expelled foam the Church of England, upon what mysterious and previously unknown authority this state ment is made? "C. T." proceeds to state—sot directly, but inferentially, and mtiunil any reserve—that Mr. Carter was requested to resign because he bad "dared to step out of the track of orthodox Methodism in Bis desire to benefit men." This second statement J??rt not even the shadow of a foundation in truth, as may be understood when it is said that the action of the district meeting fo?^ nothing whatever to do with Mr. Carter's belief or preaching or lectures, not even a reference being made to these subjects in the discussion.
