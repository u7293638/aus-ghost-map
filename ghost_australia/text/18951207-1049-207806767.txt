[?] fl ' 1 Advt. from a local f \\\\\ 0 nowspaper. Spiritualism. — Public Seance To-night, 8 o'olook. Sixponoe. Spirit friends will coutrol. Wo thought that spiritualism was as doad as tlio spook of Cissie or Josephine sinco Mr. Honry throw a "Mellon "-choly light on tho medium. The foregoing ad. would indicate, how- over, that tho ghost still walks at sixpence per current walk. Personally, wo would not pay sixpence to be controlled by any " spirit fiend " othor than that which camo out of a special black bottle. Tho pooplo who insert an ad. liko this must be dead sure of the dead. They must fool certain that their relatives will come in from the cemetery in ordor to start shifting tho furniture about. The Bird lias always viewed both pro fessional and amateur spook-raisers with a sceptical ©ye, and will continue to do so until the ghost of its grandmother comos along and consents., to Ontor an empty pickle bottle and be corked up for ex hibition. Thon with a good realisable ghost in our possession wo might bo inclined to tour tho country in pursuit of the nimble shilling, " GRANDMOTHER'S GHOST " ON EXHIBITION. ADMISSION-ONE SHILLING. CHILDREN IN ARMS FREE. Wo would got out posters like that, but iu the country towns we'll hire a boy to turn somersaults on tho stage and take the money at the door, and we would most likely do well enough to sell grandmother out after a season or so.
