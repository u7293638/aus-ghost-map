THE EX-EMPEROR NAPOLEON III. Tne Times, speaking of the Emperor Napoleon, observes : — ' The character of Napoleon III. will long remain one of the enigmas of history. Weaker in its composition than that of his uncle, it will be universally allowed hereafter— as those who can rise above prejudice allow now — that it contains better elements. No misgivings ever disturbed the serene selfishness of the first Emperor. He could sacrifice armies and nations without compunction. The ghosts of the tens of thousands _ who died for his ends never haunted his conscience. He could leave an army buried in the snows of iiussia, and warm his hands before a fire at Warsaw with no other thought than * This is better than Moscow.' The exile who will soon be among us possesses little of this compact strength . Always halting and irresolute of purpose, and never more so than during the last months of his reign, he has been averse from war, and only entered into the contest with Germany because he dreaded what might otherwise be the resentment of France. In his heart he has believed in the fulfilment of the cloudy dreams of his early manhood. He anticipated France in the inauguration of free trade, as we shall probably soon find by the adoption of a retrograde policy. His avowed detestation of the Treaties of 1815 was in a confused way mixed up with the rights of nationalities upon which he rested his claim to rule France. If, indeed, we compare the present fugitive with the refugees of 1830 and 181S, apart from the terrible disasters which his last great fault has brought upon France, we may be induced to think that he deserves to be received with as much respect as they. The Citizen King showed how little ho cared for tho interests of millions when ho sacrificed Spain to enrich a eon, and Charles X. was innocejitly incapable of looking upon subjects except as multitudes bom to obey his will.'
