m\c$ mA «f fcctte. MRS. THORNDYKES CONSCIENCE. (From tite Detroit Echo.) One brilliant morning, about two years ago, a lady who was leaving her carriage, which had stopped before a spacious mansion on Fifth avenue, suddenly paused with an excla mation of surprised welcome, addressed to a gentleman who was passing along the side walk. ' Mr. Varian !' called the lady. ?' Mrs. Thorndyke -' was the astonished reply. Immediately afterward they were shaking hands with apparently an equal amount of warmth on either side. The lady was tall, fair in coloring and noticeably handsome. Her age could not have been past 30. She wore a costume oE black silk, cut with a most modish elegance. The gleam of her hair was an almost keen gold against tltc black of her dainty, bugle-trimmed bonnet. She had an upper lip that was perfect, a deep dimple in her pink chin, an arch, irresistible look about her straight, pure brows. But the chief charm of her face was a pair of golden brown eyes. Velvet in their softness and jewel-like in their lustre. The gentleman looked a gentleman every inch, as the phrase goes. He had a tranquil face, touched with a few wrinkles that seemed of that premature kind which thought and study will print at the corner of the eye, at the edge of the nostril. His smile was soft and genial ; it had a winsome spell to which the dark gloss of his drooping monsfaiche gave added chftrwr. ' Did you think me a ghost?' said the lady. *' Vou looked so -™-w3 at me that I half believe you did.** ** I was not at all prepared for you,' he re plied, in a slow, gentle way that was a habit of speech with him. juts, jjuimayiu: utuguea- oul- mmie a. gesture toward the impressive building just opposite. ' I've been back from Fans over a month.** she -».M- ** Come in and have a chat.' They mounted the broad stoop together, attended by a. footman, who rang a bell for them. And presently they entered a drawing room appointed with richness, even splen dour. 'How is thisr Baid Mrs. Thorndyke, with ft light wave of one hfl'*^ tntiiivifinp tiie fine environment* ** Don't you think it rather nicer ' I think it very nice,' said Mr. Varian. -* Sit down. Take that plash chair ; it's so comfortable. That is right— how like old ^flfl^n it seems to see you sitting beside me '. I saw that you had got buck to America ; I read of your arrival in the Servia — wasn't it the Servia? And then there were one or two articles about you in the newspapers.

Was it a great bore?' ** The interviewing ?™ naked Varian. ** I assure yon I thought it a shocking one. L had no Hwi what to say. I fancy I really said very little. I've an idea that the re porter made up all that stuff out of his own bead.' 'But yon ought not to hare been bored,' declared Mrs. Thorndyke, beginning to take off her bonnet. She soon tossed it upon a tittle mosaic table near at hand. Her lia-ir glistened about her lovely temples ; her eyes beamed like stars ; a slight colour had crept into her cheeks ; the lines of her slender and charming figure took a new grace and sym metry. She was apsuredly a woman of great personal attraction. ' You have written two novels since you were in Europe, and you should accept the penalty of your fame, Varian,' she continued. ' Upon my word, I quite envied you when I saw how they had received you here. Any sort of a definite ex perience on this shore must be so attractive ' You don't like it here Y' 'Like it? As if oue coold ! You don't mean that yon do ?' He nodded, with grave emphasis. ' I fiud nt/vot*. nf thf rw-nnl-- u'hnm T Iix.vh tlnis fur in fit charming. There is a sort of tangle in the social atmosphere ; things are livelier anil sprightiier, somehow.' 'How can you talk like that ?' exclaimed Mrs. Thorudyke, with a pretty disdain. ' You know you don't mean a word of it. You know that New York is detestable to you after all those years in Rome, Paris, V ieniL&T; even dear old smoky London.' Varian was looking at the carpet. ' I think it horrid form,' he said, 'for an American to detest his own country.' Mrs. Thorndyke shrugged her shoulders. *' How rude of you,'' she baid, bnt she said it very amiably. ** Well, I suppose you ore right, however.' Then there was a little pause and she stole at bis, drooped face a glace that was covert, almost sly. Yon arc thinking of things that you will not speak,' she at length murmured. There was a twinkle in his quiet eyes as he raised them to hers. ** How like you that is/' he commented, with Boft amusement. ' You want to draw me out ; you want me to ask you why you crossed the ocean.' Her colour deepened somewhat, and her eyes grew serious. ' I had no reason to come, )taA I ?' she questioned. You know what Alma Thorndyke was— and is— in Paris. With my great hnap of nv-nuy I did what I pleased, did I not? Look over my past life, Hugh Varian. I went ahrwul at Hi, with poor dead father. At IS I had married one of the richest men in Europe. He was 60, and had the gout, bat he was one of the richest men in Kurone. At 25 John Thorn dyke made me a widow. Then I left London and went to Paris. I had social ambitious, and I succeeded splendidly.' Yarism was watching her now with much intentucss, and not a little puzdemeut as welL 'Ifyoadidaotenccecd,' he answered, 'I don't know anybody who ever has done so. You got the Faubourg St. Germain people to come to your salons. You did everything.' *' No, I did not do everything.' These words were spoken by Mrs. Thorndyke with so melancholy an intonation that her hearer started visibly ae they left her lipa. He rose with haste and went close to her side. 'Good heavens,' he said, ** your eyes arc full of tears ! What do you mean ? I — I don't understand.' The lady lowered her head for a moment, but before she did so he san- the tremor that was disturbing her beautiful mouth. The next instant she lifted her head and made a little imperative motion for him to reseat himself. He obeyed. Sue now addressed him with a certain tierce sadness. JIur voice was almost a whisper wliilc she spoke. ' I don't think I have ever Hurd auy man as I like you. That is just the word — like. bo many men nave tried to mate love so me \ you've always been so discreet and sensible. have half a mind to make you a confession It will ease me, I think, if I do. You are not like tiie great herd of the others. You're cold —yes you are ; don't deny it. I do not beli eve you've ever had a passion — a real passion — in your life. That is why you write so well ; your best critics know that you are al most A great novelist and your little ones am you merely surgical and analytic because they want enthusiasm and ** gush ' instead of in eight. I used to be just us cold as you, and that was the secret of our old friendship. We could laugh together at the whole silly eomalie kumaine, could we not ? We neither of us ever got any wounds, and it was so entertaining to see the other victims carried off dying from the fight. But we were cruel. Do you remember how we used to make our jokes in Paris about this heart-broken iomeo and that love sick Juliet? Well, I suppose punishment was only fair and rightful. It ought to have come to both of us, for we both, deserved it. But it came only to one.' Hugh Varian leaned forward with a very earnest and meaning1 look as he now res ponded : guess your meaning. But if I do ? ' 14 Of course you do,' broke in his com panion. The next moment she had burst into tears. For quite a little while she wept almost silently. He watched her and his face paled while he did so. At last he said : ??Yon followed Paul Charlton to this country. You came here because he -*am«». I see it «.11, now. I never dreamed of it before. And he is engaged to marry that girl, Gertrude Inaslcy.' Mrs. Thorndyke had almost crimsoned before he ended. ' I should be so very angry,' she faltered, 'if any one else were as mercilessly blunt as that. But I— I suppose I have brought it noon myself, Hugh Varian. Well, am I not a sad fool ? To think t-hft*, of all men oiire, it should be he.' Varian shook his head. ** He can't dream that he has even roused your caprice. He painted pictured for you in Paris. You were his rich and lofty patroness. He would as soon have thought of trying to gftt the sun in heaven. And I don't— I can't believe that you would ever have thought about him at all if be had been on a level with yourself or had shown you the homage of having been fascinated by you, an each a throng of the others did. This is a mere vagary an your part. You must dismiss it. Can it be really tone that you crossed the ocean because this man hadn't hud his heart at your feet ? Tell me it is not trac and I will firmly believe you. Marvels are always hard to credit.' Mrs. Thorndyke had by this time gained her wonted composure. ' I can really explain to you nothing,' she said, measuring each word. ' The whole thing flashed upon me one morning in Paris, when he bade me a polite, ceremonious, grateful farewell, after telling me that he had taken passage for thin country. I spent the rest of the day in agony. I paced the floor of mv chamber like a panther. I felt like oue of thus*: feline creatures in a French noveL My punishment bad come at last ! I wonjd not even admit my maid for hours lest she might guess my Hccret from my face. Vou arc the only person to whom I have ever breathed it. I .Ion't quite understand why I do — it is like talking ?* Ah,' said Varian, with a kind of solemn was staring down at them as they lay iu the lap of her dress. ' Wltat do you advise?'* she askei. ** That you return at once to Paris — and forget.' ' I can't forget.' 14 Then return, all the same.' She very alovly shook bur head. ' Not yet,' she replied. ' Have you seen this New York girl. Miss Innsley 7' ' Oh, yes ; a numiwr of times. I know her well. Have you ever met her ?' 14 No.' *? You eha.ll do so at my honse this evening, if you wibh,' «aid Mrs. Thornriykc. 'She and her finucv dine with me quite informally. Pray join us. ' Varian accepted this invitation, but he did so in a rather bad humor.

' had often frankly complimented Varian as a novelist ; indeed, he thought there were - certain points about his friend's books that ] were unsurpassed, nearly unsurpassable. ' But he had his little stiletto of criticism. | which he now and then knew bow to draw ' red blood with. On the other baud, it was ; very much the same with regard to V Brian's feelings toward his friend's pictures. They i had eiich given the other certain thrusts, and ' were l»th perhaps the better for the I antagonist dealt with. In character they were almost antipodal. Hugh Varian was all repose, concealment, polish, discretion. Society accepted him and respected him ; he represented so much of that graceful yet emotionless decorum which is one of its chief cults and tenets. He was not at all salient as a member of it, but then he was never in the least diminutive. He hod held his own among the best people in foreign circles, hut he had never flaunted his own there nor seemed to heed much whether or not it were paid great delerence. His pl&je; and fame in modern letters had come to lim slowly, but he had never seemed in the least haste either for distinction or achieve ment. His dead parents had long ago left him comfortably prosperous. Panl Charlton, on the contrary, had had, years ago, to strive hard for actual bread. But he had always served, his ideals with rigorous fidelity. There were those who knew — and none knew better than Varian — that he might repeatedly have gained money and a kind of success, by sinking individ uality and forsaking cherished principles. Bat the want and strife and worry had now given place, with him to a secure peace and a wholesome competence. He was recognized ; he was even, in some quarters, quite greenly laureled. He had a far more picturesque and dis tinguished look than his friend. He was not very tall, and his figure, slenderly built, ex pressed by its brisk movements, its often odd postures, an almost painful overplus of nervous energy. His head, with its broad forehead and full temples, was clad with flowing silky hair, black as night, and the eye with which he met yours when his firm, thin hand took your own, was very dark indeed and of vivid brilliancy. He never wore either moustache or beard, but a bluish line marked his upper lip and found corres pondffnt hne *poptft^? coi^TKict moulding of his delicate cheeks and chin. This effect came, most probably, from the extreme softness and clearness of his complexion, which 'was quite olive in tint. Hugh Varian bad wanted very mnch to meet h'n since leaving the steamer. But a number of assertive duties — the looking up of near relatives not seen for several years, and the investigation of money affairs which might well have received more prompt attention— had thus far stood in the way of their coining together. They had correspon ded since their separation, and in hfc letters Paul Charlton hadmade not a few confidences regarding Miss Inusley and his engagement. 'Her father,' he had written, 'was, 20 years ago, a rather famous portrait-painter here. His work is not known over the sea, bat I knew it well before I went abroad and have always thought it worthy of higher praise than it received. Luke Ihnsley married a Miss Bond, of New York : Gertrude is tlieir only child. It was not considered at all a good m;utch for Miss Bond at the time ; the Bonds, jmu know, are what people call an old familj- here, and although Innsley's bride was of the poorer branch, her relations, I have heard, curled lips and lifted noses at snefa an alliance. Gertrude lives comfortably f at present, with her mother, an elderly widow. They have apartments, as we used to say in Paris, here you would rail them a mmleBt flat.' Paul had written much more of a personal and even amatory nature, concerning his promised wife, but even if his lines had not piqued Varkii's curiosity, the latter would still Itavc felt keen desire to meet his friend's choice
