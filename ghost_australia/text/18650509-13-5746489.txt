SANDHURST. (ghost our own correspondent.) Monday, May 8. The number of fat cattle yarded to-day was 211, 133 of Morris's (Yanga), good and middling, averaged £7 le. 6d. ; 78 Putnam's, young stores and pigs' meat, £2 is 32 calves, good (Yanga), brought 47s. 6d., and 31 calves, bad, 25s. Outside. Sinclair's lot, from Canally, were bought for the Ballarat market ; Morris's (Lachlan), for Ballarat and Dunolly ; Morris's (Yanga) for Tarrangower and Joachim's lot for store cattle. The cattle yard tramway was opened to-day for the first time, and 1,400 sheep were despatched along it for Melbourne. By next week it is anticipated that beef will be able to be forwarded anywhere. The platform for filling the upper story of the sheep-tracks is constructed on quite a new principle, and succeeded admirably. The rain has apparently set in for the night, and has relieved the apprehensions of many who were fearing the supply already fallen was insufficient.
