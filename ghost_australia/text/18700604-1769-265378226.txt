AN AUSTRALIAN POEM. (Written in the approved style by Our Special Poet.) Where tbe Wallaby wobbles for ever, By forest, by fell, and by tree, Comes the rush of the rain-riven river, " Swirling " down to the straits of tbe sea Now Dand-raong darkens, and voices I Sonorous "brool" up from tbe bay ; Now twilight and tremnlaus noiseB Are passing like phantoms away J What matter, ye woodlands, what matter, At ihe fall of the nebulous night, If a poet can't say who's his hatter As he topples home, turbnlent, tightl Though "Euterpe " be eaten with apples For Bauce on her beautiful breast, What odds while the winter sun dapples The nose of the 'wildering westf Are we to B'.I down in the ashes, With faces of sorrow and scorn, Because of the sodc ; and dashes We've mournfully taken at mourn 1 It is well to be comic and cunning In the heart of this hyaline land. Where peddling pays better than punning, And grocess are glaubous and grand I Far better, O darling, to " slither " Down depths ot a bandicoot hole, Vfhen ghosts of nolicitsrs shiver In realms of the boreal pole, . â€”Punch.
