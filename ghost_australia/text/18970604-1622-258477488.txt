W \va- the daughter of humbl.) parents living Jn an agricultural village in Westmoreland. She was one of eight children supported on His a week. At IS she married with good prospects. At 2(3 she became a widow with tive little children totally unprovided for. She sought parochial relief for her children, and went out nearly every daycharing, thus keeping her humble little home tegether. Two years ago an eldeily couple (lady and gentleman) coming to the neighborhood, required two servants, only to find that no one would enter their service, the house having the reputation of being haunted. Noth ing daunted, this woman, hearing of their dilemma, undertook the duties of the household for the old couple. The lady died eight months ago ; now the old g"ntleman has departed also. Mr?. —— is left everything, including a good-sized villa residence, splendidly furnished, several cottage 3 , a few acres of land, and an income from several source--, at present yielding £'420 a year !
