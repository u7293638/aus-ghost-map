ULLADULLA. [from ouu correspondent. j Tiiunder&tork.; — On tho evening of Thursday last wo were visited by a heavy thunderstorm. For several days previous the air had been very warm and sultry. On Saturday, just about sundown, the sky became very dark away to the northward, and there was every indication of an approaching storm. Byo and bye wo could hear tho peals of distant thunder, and, shortly after midnight, the storm swept over ns with terrific violence, the electric current, in zig-zng shapes, illuminating tho Heavens with its colorless fire, accompanied at times with fitful strong gusts of wind and heavy drops of rain. Tlio storm was so uear and violent that it caused many of tho houses to rock and shiver, as if an earthquako shook tho earth. 1 liavo heard that tho house of one person has been struck with lightning, and that somo of his family had a provi dential escape. I have seen several trees which were knocked down and rent by tho lightening. Tho storm j lasted about three hours. j Accident. — I am sorry to have to record tho occur- j rence of an accident to Mr. C. Murray. Ho went out on | Friday last after somo cattle, and by some means ho got : thrown from his liorso and severely injured. Ho lay in j tho bush for two diiyn, notwithstanding a strict search ! was mado for him. By his own exertions, and in great ! pain, ho reached the residence of Mr. T. R.^ Kendall on ' Sunday morning, where medical aid was immediately procured for him. Shortly after ho was removed to his own house, whero ho is recovering rapidly. The Ghost. — Tho much talked of noise in tlioSwamp of tho Big Hole Farm, is now admitted by tho most superstitious to be only tlio screechings of a very largo bird. Several parties have been there and seen ifc; None of tho same species have been ever seen in this placo before. 22nd December, 1857.
