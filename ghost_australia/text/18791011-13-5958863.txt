¿RANCHES FEOM THE HAIL SOUTES. WITH THE AVATER SPIRITS. Br J. H. The beauties of the English lakes and their surroundings, even from what is seen of thetn only about Windermere and Coniston, are satisfying Tbey git e one an idea whence the romancers got their notions of Naiads, Lurlmes, Undines, and all the kith and kin of water sprites and spirits The like of them will, to the mind s eye, be hobgobbling me for my da} s to come in this quarter From Ambleside and Windermere, past Grasmere and Rydal, the coarse of a tour through Lakeland lies mainly northwards An excursion conveyance of the old stage coach style takes me onward one fine morn ing among scenery that would be satisfactory to any one in search of the romantic We all have our ideas of what that should be, and such will be but bettered bj what is here to be seen.

lsitmg one of the pencil factories, I find a pleasant illusion destroyed that is but one moio of the hundred beliefs of a lifetime that I have had to give up since I began travelling A black lead

"Vhat then, is the thing called a lead pencil made of if there is no lead in it ' " 'Carburet of iron is the proper name for the substance It is found in the mountains about Cumberland, and is

one of the many cascades of Lake land has been the sole reason of the snecial hotel here behind which ia the little water fall that has been made known by Southey s rhy mes as widely aa Niagara itself It may be different in the winter, but as I see it, in the dry summer time, the fall is altogether what young England calls a " sell lhere is no occasion to ask, or to have explained, ' ' How the water comea down at Lodore, for there ia so little of it falling that the only descnptiv e word for its way of coming is that of "dribble, which is not, however, in the crow ded assemblage of adv erbs and adjectives that the poet descriptively applies to it One feels sorry about Lodore as thus seen -it is such a disappointment Southey s description of it, so well known is also so early known to all of us, that it makes thereby the greater impression, and is the longer remem- j bered As one of the Lake school of poets, simplicity and clearness are parts of his sty le 1 or that reason and the ring of its rhy mea and their curious stringing, his account of Lodore s water, and the way of its fall is given ÜB as an early school piece, and for elocutionary practice Moat schoolboys know it by rote

from that something at least like a Niagara on a reduced Beale, but no one with Southey on his mind could prepare for anything like the failure that Lodore appears aa I see it' Niagara Booma as a waste of water and water pow er altogether which to a practical mind ia eaddemng, but Lodore shows, per contra an economy, a skimpineBS in that way that is only aggravating The hotel pro pnetor is not

gratuity to the old dame who cornea about to open the gate, and appears properly enough to have charge of the fall, w hieb, is as quite a thing for an old woman to take care of I say nothing to her

it, but there ia no auch difficult) with Lodore There is tho channe1 to the edgo of tho rocks, there are the rocks all ready, and the only want is the water ' As water in the lake district ia of no account, and aa there are now no known engineering difficultiea it ia only a queation of enterprise, pumps, and pay- ment, to aend every visitor away satisfied. Southeya Lodore Fall, a very wet season one, as per his celebrated description of it, would be an expensive affair to get up, and also to get down, in dry weather Like other difficulties, however, it would be only a question of coat to overcome, and there are those no doubt who would pay for it. On the road from Lodore across Borrowdale to Honister Crag and its famous Pass I came upon a solitary big boulder, weighing about a couple of thousand tons, that rolled down from the hills above probably at the time of the Deluge Unless blown up by dynamite for building or other purposes, the " Bowder Stone, aa it is called, will probably remain for ever the show and curio that it now is A ladder placed against ita side conducts to a railed platform on ita top, but the greater attraction ia below and not above this gigantic monolith About the centre of its length the great bulk of this stone dwindles beneath to a thickness that ia sufficiently far from the ground to admit of two romantically inclined people juBt shaking hands from either Bide, with the monstrous mass above and between them To do that neces3itate3 lying down, but the sensation got ia worthall the trouble Ii is (hal ofsltahng hands with one wlio i? m another woild-putting one a hand through the thick ribbed wall of the earth to grasp that of one who was never on its sur face We are allowed to imagine some sensations, and that ia one of them A good old dame ia m chargo here, and takea care that no one runa away with thia mam- moth stone Like u theatrical box keeper she opens the gate at the stair foot, and hands me for a shilling a descriptive account of the little that there is to be told about this "YYoolw ich Infant of hera It reads thua - The Bow dor Stone Mary Thompson begs to acquaint tho lako v Isitors near to Kesw ick that she continues at the Row der Stone House and attends on all parties desirous to seo and c\amlne that Immense Fragment of Rock, the largest Bolltorj, detached Btono to be found In tho world Tho Dimensions aro as follows - Length 02 feet Height, SO feet Circumference, 83 feet YNcigus 1,971 tons, and Is of Basaltic Green stone In this account is Btrangely omitted YVorda worth a apt description of it, quoted in Blacks useful Little book on the lakes, to which I now, aa previously, refer " A mass of rock, resembling as It laj A stranded ship with Keel upturned, that rests Careless of winds and waves Passing the locality of the great mine from which the world gets the beat of its pencils, I am done for a time with w heels and, for roughneaa and ateepness of roada, am re duced to walking down Buttermere hill to and through Honister Pass-nearly an hour s walk Honister Crag ia a towering wall on one Bide for some distance In the face of tina rock aro quarries having entrances óiie above the other, from which holes roofing slates, there Bpht and cut, are sent down wooden shoots for transfer to town I don t think I should have known of these mine3, high up m the fifteen hundred feet high cliff, but for the quantity of broken slates lying about, which looked as if extensive roofing operations were going on somewhere 'I he entrances to these quarnea, ni the ex posed surface of the cliff, would appear, if peopled with the heads of the minera within, as an upper box tier does at the opera In that case they would seem to be gazing upon a great performance in the grand natural amphi theatre, to which these box like holeB have a fine outlook Looking at their apparently unfenced state, one would suppose that a miner occasionally stumbles out and down ten or tweh e hundred feet anJ gets broken up here among the alatea that ha\ e aimilarly fallen Vt hen I hat e got through Honister Pass the ride IB resumed, and by the margin of Crummock YYater I get round again to Keswick as pleasant head quarters Into this Crummock Lake there descends adown the tall clift" like side of a tall mount the narrowest waterfall for ita great height that I had ever seen It is that Scale Torce before alluded to, and is a mere ribbon of a stream that runs ao quietly and continuoualj down ita great depth to the lake below, that it is not eaBy at first to believe hat one is looking at a waterfall No motion is observable in the wat»r so descend ing It looks rather as if a prodigiously long, narrow strip of glass had been laid againat the hill aide that would jet bo wanted above and pulled up by the glaziers at work there It was onlj bj getting very near to it, on the opposite Bide of the lake, that ita real character of a skeleton of a waterfall waa verified. Little Keswick I find to be in a great atato of excitement, caused by the discovery of the body of one of its loat tounata The un fortunate traveller had been amissing for a month, and his remains had been at Ust dis covered- much by the agency to which Hamlet alludes us a guide to finding those of 1'olonius He had left Keswick, this solitary adv enturer, on the way to Buttermere by a circuitouB route over little frequented moun tam passes W arnuig had been giv en to him against such a tour all unaccompanied, but ho was as inattentive to all advice as waa Longfellow's celebrated "Excelsior youth, and shared exactly the Bame sad fate He had wandered from the track or failed to find it had got benighted, felt the froway effect of the cold mountain air, had lain down to aleep, and been chilled to death while sleeping It had been a painless death evi dently-found aB he waB on Bmooth, mossy ground, bia head resting on his left hand, in the attitude in which he had paaaed placidlj awaj to what apintualiats call " the inner life A sensible dog had, it appeared, made efforts, as a reasoning being would havo done, to rouse the sleeper from hia dangerous re pose The clothing on Ina arms and lega bore marks and renta caused by the shaking he had, in such canino kindness, uselessly re- cen ed YY hat had tempted him thua to emulate the "Excelsior" example was un known, but aa a form of Buicide, if such was sought, tbo result had been attained.
