'We* sympathise with you, mydearJ-rothersf^in rthe position in which you. -are -pla^d- TtcMiigh^^ for weicnow full well ^he path xzl which ypu;^ayB to tread, the work 'you have 'to do in the Lord's vineyard, the temptations you: will fce subject to, and the trials whichare f-eculiar to 'minis- terial life — trials that others, are strangers to. We sympathise with you, and .you hayefour most earnest -and hearty yiBhthjit GjddVIaeBS- ing may rest -upon you. {Although. Anere imay be ^difficulties- in '? your -*ray,' ; there are ' &*&£T promises to sustain you~ amidst afl rthe-triafi of life. Ifr becomes my -duty m^ conscience of the relation in which I stand' ^b; ithis Church, to address a few words'of -iadyice' iind encouragement to yon, and I shall endeavor^ to ? , do so on the subject of -mihisferial'faltnrolness ^V — not that we are about to' detain you ifprsSiy lengthened period. The remarks we have; $o make will be plainana - practical, ::and, l-jr *3od's help, I trust they may -Toe of service . to ybu-^fco strengthen you in this great work. Let me re mind you of the necessity t-f faithfulness, .to yourself, by which I mean the cultivation faf personal religion— personal '-piety. .'Sjoji have said this -evening, before Cod and 'th:8tt-e6ple, that you have been brought to a saving ac quaintance with Christ-^-that* you have been converted to God. And- as has already been said to you, this is the first fqualification for the work— personal conversion. ''We recoljnis'fiSo'' man's. claim to. the ministry who if uncon verted. God never * calls an| -an-|-nyerteft:. man to do Has work — he 'has 'no' quali~ fication — no fitness— he cannot, understand the great truths of reKgion^^he ^cannot direct others into the safe path into which; he has not ' entered himself. We thank God. oil your Be half that you know what conversion is, and that you are prepared to press it on the acceptanceiof those to whom you preach. Cultivate that grace that has been bestowed upon you, and cul tivate and strengtheoallTthe]gifts:jaiift graces of the Holy Spirit. You believe In the doctrine of Christian perfection1— you believe in tfie idBc trine of maturity in grace. , . Let me urge upon I you to seek after this. Let it-beihe gr^at par* I suit'-bf iyour mfe to reach 'that standard3hatJ mark of perfect love, that holiness, that inward J piety, thatsanctification'of nature, thbaght,*rid motive which will ^render; you ^ore: useful in the Christian Church; and more happy in the work of the ministry. Need I say to you that ? you must urge on God's people; io this state of holiness and piety',? We, as ministers, are called to be -examples — to- -stand in this respect before jour people asMkhdje^al; are in the enjoyment of greater holiness than] those to whom we preach. We are to urge God's people to press into ' the -Janaari~ of -:j-eri] i feet love. I trust this 'will ?always - be your eit-' '^ . deavor. Cultivate a spirit1 ; of holiness '*$$ piety, and urge it upon others. ''!Flieri iefrme' say to you that youare -Mled upofftbibedilii' gent In your studies ; and whatever Iriadwledgie you may acquire, make it -subservient to xthe great work to which you have derated your lives. Is : there any knowledge you may. acquire i that cannot be used in the xChristaan religioh? God expects us to cultivate, our powers, -am- prove our minds, husband -our time; thus ;see]k ing to know Him and understandjHiB: wnrkeii that, we may be the better able jto expound His, Word, and urge upon those to whoni we preach the great' doctrines of our holy GhriBtianity. You are .not only to be diligen±,Btudents study ing God's. Word and. reading proper, books, but 'to be' 'painstaking , in your.,; pulpit preparations. .You are to be. fmthful to ^our selves. God holds you awouniable for the jm-. provemeht of your minds, and if He has -called, you to this great work iha /expects yon to zpake due preparation for the distribution — ghalUI, say-^or'the bread of life. He expects you to provide a portion for aU those 4w whom; ywi minister ; which, cannot 'be done by .etudyjing, only, bat by prayer and meditation. We are, not to go before. His people and^gjve otferanspr to sentiments we have not well we^hed. ^He expects us to give them principles/ ^eiiav-e' well weighed and of the truth of ?*bj£h-wp.ar£ satisfied. Prepare, therefore, for 'the _-pnipi£. £ A man that is weakiand feeble /in the, J-jupit will be freak 'elsewhere ; therefore endeavor-by] properly husbanding your time .to prepare for the ministration of God's Wgrtl #o;.^. to, secure that for which you are -Aled4nto this ininistry. You are also. callM npiO,aito!'«jd-v tivate the ' spirit of prayer aa/3. :;ine ;gi£t, ei prayer, for you .lave': ,;ip'; Jeadr'the devo-' tions of God'e r people— to leaU-i^g^^h, to lead them, to God— to lead'them -jtp the foot stool of ^DiTOie. mercyirtOLJead. Jthem-io the. great .Mediator; And if you -are -to. lead ^he; devotidns bf God's people' aright; you^musf Jr'' caltivate the spirit of prayer and the gift of ;-* prayer. And our worship in lUis house should be free from all formality; there ntust 'not be the worship ef lips only,1 but also if heaite.^;'^1' sure that you avoid that i.bmiietic^orspasr modic style of prayer that is so common in oar day. I mean the preaching to Gofr instead&f; praying to Him. He expects us to pray 1in the great congregation, and to address Him as humble -suppliants. ; Cultivate that proper style of address to God — simple, plain, humble, language— the language of the peniteitt-~-the language of the sinner when infinitely blessed ; and let your prayer be comprehensive but not wearisome]; and let there be fervor, earnestnesu, and faith, in all the petitions you offer to God. Thisiflfaithfulnessto yourself. For your encour agement in this duty let me say to you that yon, have promises ofr help in) prayer, £ar -vsupeV rior to any forms of prayer. You have the promised help of the Holy Spirit. We are not here to condemn all forms of prayer — we do not generally use them in our public worship ;but in their absence you have something far more important and certain to re&tupon; — the promised help of the Spirit. Did not the Lord promise His Spirit to the apostles? and the promise is. as valid now as it was when made to rthem y and as sure as the Spirit came down, and sat upon the heads of the apostles like cloven tongues of fire, and as sure as it came down upon the first Christians, so surely will It 'come down upon you if you wait upon God in^rayer, not only day by day, but especially when you are going to minister to the. great bpngrsgationi — so mil your services be acceptable to God and beneliial to His people.: : You have to-night declared, before this conr gregation that you are moved by the iHply - GhoBt. We believe you-^that you are' moved by. the Holy Ghost to take upon yourself, this work and office of the Christian ministry. \ It is: well foryou that yon feel -uch^is the case/ You j will have often in f he future to fall back upon r^~ this great truth.. You- will'many times have to revert to the impression received by the indwel ling of the Spirit, and you will many times have to look back to this period as well as to past periods in your life that you may gather strength and encouragement in your future trials and discouragements. That Holy Spirit * who has moTedryour hsa^^^TEffi Christian' work willj.we bejieve, abide with ^yoa.THie; Church believes you are called, having *et you); apart for the work of the ministry by the im posi ion of hands— the liands of the ministers' ^ ^^p^lif thisiCharch. fast ^me p.y 'that iwhiiewpdonotuse that term, we believe that' iall ?S£e- 'mdriistera of STesus Christ who have been called bj: Him and, have, charge of any portion sof Hie ': Lord's flock; and' administer the holy Sacrament/^are 'truly ^nd properly bishops in the Christian Church.' i You have, we say, been thus set apart, and now you nhave ibTje faithful to your 'ffird^-faithful-to Him^in' your teaching the %reat -truths that He Mas' commanded. And here let me say that the in spired Bobkfof God 'is' our 'book rof theology ; ire acknowledge norther soufceof Divine truth but thef Bibler 'J'hJH is our standard. Sometimes men speak of us*as4f we regarded 'the writings of Wesley, Hetcher, and Benson, as on a -par with 'the teachings of ^criptttre ;and'they speak of our creed; -ButJbiircree'dLis. in the Bible, andfl urge you to shun;every. system and do j- ' trine which cannot be'prpved by the Bible to be ' Of God. When we speak of our standard books and writers, all that we mean is that we believe such idS&kkv;&wrifteri; tmths %Kich are\inhar mony with the teachings of God's Word. Bre thren, allow me a word with you now withregard to speculative theology. 33iespeculative spirit of theagehasfouhdits way lutooivine things. Be upon' your iguard against the introduction : of novelties into the ChriBfian religion. * A man might read a book upon speculative theology without injury i~ but' iwhen '. '?&? ihan imbibes the sentiments and becomes speculative himself, he is likely to introduce the subject to the attention A-6f;rthe I congregation iro whom 'he-tpreachtes, jand-; -it . is -probable he may be the : means of creating doubt, and affect ing-the-belief of' fiome individual; and if by enunciating ariy; speculative' ^theology or dogma you should instil into the minds of any of your people^ that whicV led them* to doubt, and from doubt to unbelief, and then to Hell,. God rrwilj demand their, souls at your hands. Itaie'c&re;' that 'you observe thie ancient land ^marks, tha^you walk in the old; path, and %ake heed to the warnings which you find dfstmptjjrrwritten; in God's Word,: and: keep to the great fundamental doctrines of oar holy religion.
