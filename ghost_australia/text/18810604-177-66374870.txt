Poetry. _ LONGFELLOW ON BURNS. I SEK -ftHTid tl..-i tieids of Ayr A ploughman who, in foul or fair. ivn<rs at his task, - So clear wv know no; if it is The laverock's song or his^ Nor care tna.sk. . For him the ploughing of those fields A more ethereal harvest yields Th.ui sh".i\\-es of trraiu ; ? ; Song< tlush with purple bloom the rye ; : The piovvr's.call. thc curlew's cry, Sing in hi.-> bi-ain. Touched by his hand, thc way-side weed Bccouii's a flower; the lowliest reed l'c-ide the si ream Is clothed with beauty, gorse and grass And .heather. where his footsteps pass, The blighter seem. He sincrs of lore, wliose flame illumes The darkness of lone cottage rooms ; He feels the force. The treacherous under tow and stress, Of wayward passions, and uo less The keen remorse. At moments wrestling with his fate, His vuice ishar-h. but not with hate ; The brushwood hung Above the tavern door lets fail Its bitter leaf, its drops of gall, Upon his tongue. But still the burden of his song Is lov'e.of ri'-rht. dis hain of wrong ; Its master-chords Are Manhood. Freedom, Brotherhood; Its discrds but an interlude , . lietweeÃ¹ thc word*. And then to die s\vounr. and leave Unfiui-hel what he ini'rh; achieve I Yet he! ;..]. sure Is *Jiis th.tu wa/i h-rijig np and down, An old niau, in a eoiuitry towd, 1 ii ti rm and p ) >r. For now he haunts his na-ive laud As au inimortal youth : his hand Guides every plough ; He sits beside each ingle-nook ; His voice is in each rushing brook, Dach rustling bough. His presence haunts this room to-night A form of minirled mist and light, ? ' 'From that ftiir coast. Welcomcbcneat h this roof of mine ! Welcome ! this vacant chair is thine, Dear guest and ghost !
