PflE6ENTATroN6.—A t th e conclusion of the welcome te a to tb e Ri>v. R. Thom in Chalmers' H all last evening two present*.' tioae were made. M r Jas. Afacfarlane said in regard to th e first—to M is L ang—th a t it would be like H am let with th e ghost absent. H ad she b*eti present it would have been bis pleasant duty to have handed her a token of esteem (a silver cruet) «n her leaving- th e choir to enter the marriage state. As it was, he would have to ask Mr Rogere to take charge of the gift. M r Rogers said be would convey it to Mrs Lang, a n d on her behalf thanked them for the handsome present. M r T. L.

He asked him to accept of a purse and its solid contents, as a proof of th a t esteem. M r Cex hod been most faithful to duties, conscientious, punctual, and 1ready to do anything to assist. The presentation had been got up hurriedly, nod b u t a few of th e members ot the congregation had been even on tbe m atter, otherwise it would have been larger. Mr Cox fisid he ucVer felt in a more oinbarraFBtd position in his life, and he could only thank them all mo&t; sincerely for their erpre66ion. I t was indeed most gratifying to him to find th a t After nearly 19 years' service a* precentor be was thought worthy of th e ir commendation and the handsome present ju s t made to Mr C-ix again tnanked the congregation and retired.

T be response to the invitation far exceeded the expectations ef tb e promoter, who last evening was placed a t his wit's end to find means of locomotion for tbe throng of gaily dressed youngsters who assailed him on all points. The secret armoury of th e r i d ' was, however, penetrated, and over 200 yoongstera disported themselves on the rotlera, which, in some i, assisted to fu rth er show their dexterity, whilst in m any others served as a means of making a close acquaintanceship with a harder substance than the buman frame. W hen th e carnival started, it was estimated th a t over 600 sightseers were in e room. The festivit Ses commenced with grand march, headed by M aster Steinbach dressed as Bam bini in " Tam bour Major,” T be little fellow, who be- 1 bis courtier costume well, ably supported by a dim inutive i who was attired as a Fairy. T he costumes of these dots wore striking and tasteful, and complimentary to those who were instrum ental in arraying them . M aster Bircb, an ocean h ero, and one of th e most dexterous juvenile skaters m tl gladdened th e beatta of bis psreute by shoeing th a t gsllanbry which can only come from one of N eptune’s protcgsi to the fair Hebes who came a th w art bis path.

The maypole danoe followed tb e march, and was one of the cleverest evolutionary displays of skstiog th a t has been witnessed on th e floor of the rink since its establishm ent.
