It was Im elly to be expected tint the membeis of the Legislatue Assembly would be \Mlhng to postpone the Ministe nal explanation on luesday last at the moment when the Piemiei was about to make it, in ouler to discuss Ali Wai sa s motion foi the appointment of a select committee to lnquue and lepoit as to the « orking of the Gold fields Act ind Regulations, and of the re\ euues and ex penses itising theiefrom Mr Wai bil must ha\e felt it would be a hopeless task to try to peisuade the House to any such course and the wontlei is that a membei of his oxpeiiencc should attempt it And jet theie eau be uo question is to the \eiy pressing necessity theie is for an in quny of this kind Iheie is, eithei lightly oi rtrongl}, i \eiy Hidespiead dissatisfaction with the piesent Gold fields Act and Epgu ¡ations, raineia aie îepoitecî to be leaving the colony in laigenunibeispaitly in conse quence oí this, and c ipitihsts aie saul to be afraid of investing m gold mining for the same îeason Hie permanence and prospeiity of a gold field depends moie than any othci índustiy upon populai opinion, and, therefoie, the soonei the whole mattei is thoioughlj inquited into the bettei for the inteiest of oui gold fields and the colony at laige Such a committee judici ously selected and setting about thou woik in a piopei mannei could \ery soon ascei tain whether there weie any just grounds of complaint, and if »o, to what extent and how they could best be îemedied It is to the interest of e\eiy one m the colony thateiery encouiagement should be gi\ en to the development of our gold fields , no party question is m\ oh ed, and the defects m oui Gold fields Act being cleaily pointed out theie should be no difficulty in getting such amendments made as the circumstances of the case îequued When the question was brought befoie the House on Tuesday last, Mi L vun, the late Minister foi Woiks, and Mi Hodgson, who succeeded lum, weie in a gieat hurry to piotest against the proposed com nnttee on the ground that it w ould imply a censure upon the administiation of the gold fields w hile undei their charge Of course these gentlemen know better than anyone else eau possibly do how fal their administiation has been open to consule but just then at least, no blame was laid to them The general opinion is that the Goldfields Act is so defectne that the most conscientious Minister, and the moat intelligent and honest Commissioners, are m man} cases powerless to pievent injustice and injury from being done to minéis who ha\e to appeal to it And fmthei, it is asserted, on w hat appears to be \ ery good authority that under this Act neither Local Mining Coulls 1101 any othei body can possibly make such îegulations as would effectually lemedy the defects com plained of Looking at the matter from outside the Public Works Office it w ould seem that a conscientious Minister ought to be the \eiy fust to couit au inquiry of this kind, if foi nothing else but to prove ho« honestlj he had perfoimed his dut} The proposed committee, however, would in all piobabihtj have devoted verv little time and attention to the mannei in which the Act had been aduiwisteied, unless, indeed, the) discos eied in the course of the inquiry that there had been verj great mai administration of it-which is not likely , otheivwse it would have been dis- covered and exposed before this The chief fault is said to be m the Act itself It is charged against it that it is not only so looseh, w orded that the chinee» are as ten to one against any tw o Commissioner», ínteipietiug the «ame clause in the same manner, but that it» provision» are alto gather obsolete, and were siipei^eded in the «outhern gold nuning colonie» ind New Zealand j ear» ago Then again it is urged that anj regulations framed under this Act, a» a matter of cour»e, mu»t cou tain mmy of the defects inherent in the Act itself The establishment of a Local Mining Court at Gympie some months ago was unquestionably a step in the light dnec tion, ind the new legulation» issued bj that Couit are, on the whole, admitted to be a decided improvement upon those which weie in force previousl) But even this is a vei) negative praise, because, m the first place the old îegulations were declared on i all sides to be worse thin useless, ind, in the second place, the only opinion which | his been publicly gi\ en of the new regula tions condemns them in se\ eral important paiticulars It is alleged, foi instance, that the new code of the Gjnipie Court peipettiate some of the most objectionable defects of the old íegulations As this subject was discussed at length m otu columns only two days ago b3 a piactical minei, Mi Arm, the manager of the Golden Curne and Victoria Company, at Gympie, it is not necessaiy to go o\ei the same ground again in the present instance, more especially as Mi. Aplin's objections to the legulations havo been endoised by a numbei of persons well acquainted with the subject, and laigely interested in mining at Gympie, whom v\ e ha\ 0 spoken I to on the subject But, it is necessary to point out, that the chief of these objections go to show that at piesent suiface alluvial digging may be saul to be at an end on this gold field, that there is no sufiicient provision made foi woiking quartz íeefs and alluvial claims íequiring deep sinking on a scale on which they can alone be made îeinuneia tive, that theie is no piotection to the capitalist who invests his money in these diggings, because whenevei a claim 111 winch ho is inteiested becomes íeally valuable he is 111 dangei of losiug it altogether, 01 of being foiced to spend a consideiable amount of money in law ex penses to defend his lights , and, finally, that the law in this íespect is so unceitain that the chances are against him, howevei strong may be hu moral and equitable rights This maj be an exaggeration, but at anj late it points to the pressing neces sity there is foi a full and seaiching mquiiy As the editor of the Gympie Timei \eiy duly said, in an aiticle which appeared in that papei a short time ago - " In order to cnablo capital to bo invested in a ByBtomatie monnoi [in gold mining] throe con- ditions aro imperatively nocossary-a sullloiont area of ground, a secured title, and a suitable Mining Paitnership Act " He goes on to saj that " Ilio first of thoso conditions exists uudei tho Local Court Bules to a modeiato oxtont, and it is moro than probablo that oxpononcc «ill justify tho increasing of tho aroa of claims, especially in old and abandoned ground, or new ground, eithei alluvial or quart/, that when tested has been proved to be unprofitable 111 tho ordmniy way Lui go claims aro requisito to justify the expenditure of capital, and if reason able labor conditions are attached, ground being worked in largo instead of small ureus 13 boBt not only foi tho working miner und (ho capitalist, but it is also tho most bcncticinl for tbo Stato As a proof of this, take any of thogicat contros of mining industij in Victoria 01 JSow South Wales, 01 even Now Zealand, and contrast thoa social condition with that of minors rcsidont on these diggings, where capital is not invested, whero fosBickoiB abound, and the puddling machine ib tho onlj macbinerv orooted to ox ti act gold, and no doubt can exist that thoso minors who aro employed whoro capital is laigclj invostod 111 mining opeiations, aro the best fed and housed, easiest worked, and the most intelligent citizens Xhoy tako a deoper interest in mining affiins, local and gonoral, and sholl more energy in guarding then rights, than tho apathetic workers on «hat arctcchni cully known us 'pipeclay' diggings" Now Mi. Ai_\ saigunientgoes to show that the piesent legulations dnectly ia\oi the "fossickeis1 and " pipeclaj" diggeis bj discounging my other mode of w 01 lung the ground Othei managers of companies complain that m consequence of then not being allowed to amil^amate their claims, so as to woik them to the best advantage, thej aie 111 dnngei of not being able to woik them at all except it 1 loss, while theie can be no question tint the Paitnei ships Act now 111 toi ce 111 this colony is alto gethei too cuiubious and costlj in its pro vi sions for gold mining speculations Possibly theie may be anothei side to this question , but, w lule the present discon- tent exists among solaige a numbei of dig- gers, this only aftouls another pioof of the pressing necessity theie is foi such an enquiry to be made "Whether the new Ministei foi AVoiks will bo able to take any steps to investigate the niattei and apply a îemcdy, if necessaiy, befoie the House again meets we cannot say, it would bo well, howevei, for him to see what can be done in this duection liir general public aie frequently at 1 loss to know the piecise ariangement which exists of the minor depaitments of the seivice under the several Mimsteis of the Ciown Lven when people in town ha\c business to ti ansact w Inch renders it necessaiy for them to visit the head of a department or his immediate suboidinate, this lgnoiancc as to who is the propei person to applj to leads to much mcon vetnence and loss of time The Ministei is pestered by inquiries on subjects with which he has nothing whatever to do, and the mquirei loses his time and temper, and fancies himself snubbed and pitchfoiked about by people whose salanes ho helps to pa) There will alwajs be people too stupid to understand even the plainest institutions , but a great deal of this annoyauce might be prevented by tho publication in the GaxHlt of a complete statement of the administrative arrange- ments The uewspapeis would copy it, and copies might be struct off and posted up in every Government office in the colony. To persons at a great distance from the seat of Government such information would be particularly- useful, and would frequently prevent serious loss of time and money. From time to time instances have been brought under our notice of persons, many hundreds of miles from Brisbane, writing to some Government ofiicer here on urgent business, going to great trouble to state their case, and receiving in reply a curt intimation that they had applied to tho wrong officer, and not a word of in- formation beyond that. Sometimes ap- plicants have not been so fortunate as even that comes to. The fact of their having in their ignorance of official routine applied in the wrong quarter, lias been availed of by soma of our sadly over- worked Civil Servant« as au excuse for throwing their letter aside and taking no notice whatever of it, They have waited for months expecting that every mail might bring them an answer, and in the end have come to Brisbane to make inquiries in per- son. A great deal of rumaging in dusty pigeon-holes results perhaps in the discovery of their letter, and they then learn that "it is not the business of that department."' The chances are that it is then too late for much good to come of any department entertaining the matter. In one instance we knew what the lawyers would call splendid case " to arise in this way ; but however pleasant may have been their pickings out of it, a great and undeserved injustice and loss was inflicted upon the person who had got enmeshed in official red tape. The evil complained of is one felt especially in the North, and if for no other cause, it is to be hoped that it will be remedied without further delay.
