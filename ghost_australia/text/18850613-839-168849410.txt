A Hen on her Eggs. Ah I ah ! this tima I've got, I think, just five, Whilo as the moon upon an August night, I long to see the contents well alive, For those ehioks, still unborn, are my delight. My eldest egg — now let me pause and;'see : Haying tho grace of the ailantua tree, A linnet's voice, the brute strength of ahorse. My Hecond, I must very fondly dream, Will be a poule dc httres, and very wise ; She in linguiatics will be held supreme, And she will learn the idiom of the flies. That third, delicious, speckled egg of mine Will bring me forth the handsomest of males, With military genius, I opino — A fowl the foe of garden slugs and snails. That other there— that dotted little dear — Will cause my poor maternal mind regret ; For she will bo, I positively fear, The wayward Cleopatra of my sot. Bui, ah 1 the one that has a beauty mark Right on the top, from Duty ne'er will quail ; She, Christian-like, will suffer in tho dark And bo tho chickens' Horonoo Nightingale. So saying, the hen clucked loudly in her joy, And waved her winga upon tho unhatohed eggs ; But then appeared a stalwart poultry-boy, With squinting oyes and odiouB crooked legs 1 He seized her offspring right before her oyes, Took the throe best, tho ones she prized tho most. And, to the mother's infinite surprise, Vanished around tho corner like a ghost 1 And, while ahe hurried after him to Bay, ' Spare, spare my ohildren, and bo ever bloat I' A wensel, who had seen no food that day. Happened to tramp along, and Buck the rest. — Cupid Jones.
