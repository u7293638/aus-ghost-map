THE JULY MAGAZINES. A short poem in praise of Chaucer, as associated «vith the month of May in Eng. lund, and «vith tho beauty of its country roads, from the pen of Mr. Swinburne, is awarded the place of honour, and is printed in the largest type, in the present number of the Nineteenth Ceiitwi/ It IB followed by a caustic reply to Mr Harrison's "Ghost of Religion" from Mr Herbert Spencer, who entitles his rejoinder "Retrogressive Reli- gion " The sharp things said by the former writer about the " Infinito Unknowable" are retorted by others equally tart concerning the Orcat Being, Humunitj, set up for worship by the disciples of Comte. Tar from seeing nnj thing worshipful in the lrench man s fcMsh, Mr Spencer is of opinion that ' contemplation of it is calculated to excite feelings which it is best to keep out of con- sciousness " He investigates the moral and intellectual traits of theavcrageAnglo Saxon, aud finds m neither nuvtaing capable of ex citing tho required rehgn i s feeling " Not reverence, not admiration, scarcely even respect," he observes, " is caused by the Bidit of a hundred n dhan paganB masquerading as Christiana ' ' Sir Samuel Baker's paper on "Egypt's Proper Fron- tier " is a timely and valuable contribu- tion to the discussion of the great questions ofthedaj In his belief, the Soudan insur- rection would never have assumed the pro- portions it has done if England had from tho first declared her determination to enforce obediente to tho Khedives rule, lier determination to repudiate all con nexion «vith the Soudan, while assuming the supreme control of Lower Egypt, «vas certain, ho says, to entail confusion at the moment when co operation would be most important We «vero bound, ho argues, to accept the responsihihtj of the whole when undertaking that of a part '1 he mission of General Gotdon ho declares to have been worse than a cruel blunder , and Sir Samuel uflirms, in the most positive language, that it is impossible for Egjpt to abandon Khar- toum, Senaar, and those central pro« incea of the Soudan that should be knoivn in future as Upper Kgjpt The insurrection in the Soudan must be stamped out, and England must exhibit her hxed determination to maintain her influence and position as the guurdian ot Fgjptian and British interests combined m undoubted union, and to offer an unmistakable resistance to any attempts on the part of other countries either to con trol or dictate her action A second article on tho same question, by Mr E Dicey, deals chiefly with the concessions made by England to Tranco at the recent conference, «vhich he stigmatises as having combined the mnxi mum of e« ii «vith the minimum of good, and ns amounting to the complete and permanent surrender of British supremacy in Egypt Sub siquiut p«cnts, hotvever, ha\c deprived Mr Dncy B dissertation of the interests which it might have otherwise possessed Sir R. A. Crosse, M P , reviews theorigin of the London Livery Companies, the objects for which they «veie originally founded, the functions which '.hcj continue to discharge, and their methods of administering their large incomes, which amount in the aggregate to upwards of ¿750,000 per annum. Deducting from tins sum the revenues held in trust, and the ex- penditure on salaries and improvements, there is a surplus of £200,000 u year avail- able for benevolent purposes, of which no less than £100,000 is now spent upon entertainments. How shall this quarter of a million be applied in future ? This is the question considered by Sir R. A. CroBse, who, while he concurs «vith the recommendations ot the commissioners, is of opinion that a portion of it should be expended in "enabl- ing the craftsmen of their several handicrafts in London to procuro for themselves whole some d«veIhngB in which to live, supplied, at all events, with some of God's greatest hies sings, which manv of them arc now unable to obtain-pure water, pure light, pure air.

He thinks the f< deration of the British Ftnpiro would be precipitated if the mother country «vero engugi d in a war with a foreign power, but nrgues that "it would be far bettir for ourse!« es, as well ns for friends foes if our federation and union were brought about bj reasonable indem ours beforo such catastrophe befel us.'
