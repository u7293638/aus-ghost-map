YE YEARS ! ' Tis but the ghost of a feeling, ' Tis but the ghost of a smile; Gone is the true light revealing, This but a shadow the while. Thus shall each rose-tinted vision Fade as the leaves in the Fall, Leaving, it may be, derision Casting a gleam o'er the pall. Years glide along without number (Swift as a wind-driven wave), Hiding away in its slumber Much we would struggle to save. Taking the bloom from the roses, Taking the down from the peach; Leaving the thorn from tho posies, Leaving the ashes of each. Bringing the end of our dreaming, Rounding the sphere of our life; Tinting with shades of new meaning Harshness of pain or of strife. Waking our souls from delusion, Chasing the shadows that throng; Piercing the vale of illusion, Righting full many a wrong. Scattering the false that would cluster Only when fortune is fair; Shrining with ever more lustre Love that all danger would dare. Testing the true from the faithless, Tearing the mask from deceit; Leaving but few that are scatheless, Few - but how preciously sweet ! Thanks, then, each year that unveileth Tenderness, courage, and truth; And for the rest - what availeth? Take them, ye years, with our youth !
