S ----- " Tws but a little word il anger spoken; While proud cyes flashed through bitter, .burning tears; But oh, I felt that fatal word hlol broken The corn of love that bound our hearts . for yoprs. The tortured face, that long, wild look of sorrow, i Like 'ron' pile ghost, must haunt me S while I live; And yet, how bright, how full of joy the morrow, Had I but breathed one simple word " Forgive !"

Thy lleading voice, thy tortured face, was golle. That angry word, I may recall if never; For o'er thy nalrow gtve ranlk weeds have grown. "Remember, love, that it may be forever." Alh, wonlrd prophetic! love, had I b!t knlows ! My locks are gray, mty eye anr dim, with .The face once.loved by tleou no longer , fair! lieneath" tile daisim s thou art calmly sleeping ; There a ]oieo woman ofteln kneels in prayer.
