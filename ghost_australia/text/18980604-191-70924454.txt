News is to hand from Spain of an exciting contest between a racing cyclist and an .... ? «:qia'£Ji£a^Vi3iuau.Jm^ side. The race was for three hours, and was won upon two tracks, one within the other,' the outer circle being ''224 yards 'in ? circumference, and the inner oue four yards shoiter. The lady had the use of five horses, and the option of changing as often as she desired, whilst the cyclist could change his machine if he found it necessary. For the. first ten minutes the race was an evenly -contested one, the lady, who liaTT selected the outer circle, having si slight ;vd vantage ; but from this out the cyclist gradually drew ahead* of the equestrienmy v altlmugli she made repeated changes. As time crept on the equestrienne began to regain her lost ground, and the excitement rose i,j fever pitch- as it was seen that the cyclist was tiring. But the hard ridiug was tolling badly on the horses,, who wen; now thormighly.iFxliaust.ed and unable to n'spiw-Hsrthiyrr.idoi''s'-e.ff-»rts-to-redu(«J! the cyclist's lead. At the expiration of th«^ three hours the -cyclist was pronounced tlio^ winner l-y five, miles, he having covered 5S miles -S8() yards (unpaged), as .against his antagonist's 53. miles 280 yards. * *?_*;? a 1 Mugger Bilmartin has won his first match since his return to the States.
