THEATRE ROYAL. HAMLET. Mr. Dampier, who has long had a high reputation as a versatile actor, appeared for the first time in Melbourne as Hamlet at the Theatre Royal last evening. It was expected that Mr. Dampier would give a very respectable reading of the part, but his performance was one of great merit, which largely exceeded in effectiveness the anticipations of his friends. The impersonation cannot be compared with that of the late Walter Montgomery, but Mr. Dampier's Hamlet is the best that has been seen on the Melbourne stage since the death of that actor. The first scene with the ghost was highly impressive, and the soliloquy, " Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I," was given with much dramatic ure. Mr. Dampier makes one or two new points, and his exits' are all well contrived. in the closet scene with the Queen, he remains standing until after the departure of the ghost, and in the latter portion of the scene he kneels at his mother's feet, an attitude which seems to heighten the earnestness of the Prince's entreaties. The most noticeable innovation, however, is the introduction of the body of Ophelia on a litter immediately after the announcement of her death, so that the speech of Laertes, " Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia," is delivered over her corpse, Mr. Dampier was very heartily applauded throughout, and he was called before the curtain 2 at the end of each act Mr. Appleton appeared to great advantage as Laertes, playing this choleraic character with proper fire and spirit Miss Blanche Stammers may, also be congratulated upon having made a pronounced success in Ophelia; while Mrs. Bryer enacted the Queen with more than average ability. Mr. O'Brien's Polonius was respectable, but he had not mastered the text Mr. Lawrence was too heavy for the King. The remaining leading characters had familiar representatives. " Hamlet" will be repeated to-night, and " The Stranger" is announced for Wednesday,
