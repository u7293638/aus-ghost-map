feopean Intelligent*. IRELAND. "PLAYING THE GHOST" AT ENNISCOETHY. DEATH BESUIiTING FBOM ALLEGED fbight. On 21st December a young girl of 19, named Eiiza Kearns, Duffry Hill, died from, it is alleged, consequences resulting from a fright which Bhe received owing to the "ghost-playing" pranks of some persons as yet unknown. It appears that one evening whilst proceeding home she encountered a " ghost" who was airing himself in a sheet for the purpose of amusing himself by frightening passersby. Being of a very nervous temperament she got a considerable shock, the effects of which she experienced for some days after. After a week had elapsed she was attacked with intestinal inflammation, to which she succumbed on Thursday 21st December, expiring rather suddenly. The coroner was communicated with, but as the illness had been of such duration he did not consider the holding of an inquest necessary. No clue has been got to the identity of the parties who frightened the unfortunate girl. It is not improbable that they are juveniles, as a man would hardly be so thoughtless as to perpetrate such a reprehe: joke, especially when the victi young girl.
