THE RED SPECTRE AND THE EMPEROR. "Tell him that the Red Man is wait ing for an auodience." "Him " was Napoleon the Great; th command was addressedl to Count de Mold, the Emperor's counsellor; and the speaker was the Red Spectre, whose mission it was to watch over the desti nies of the Little Corporal. The Spectre, fantastically dressed in Red trousers, blouse, and cap, was told that his Majesty was busy and must on no consideration be interrupted. The only answer that the apparition deigned to return to this message was that he must see Napoleon-must see him alotte, and at once. Still the Emperor refused point blank to grant this importunate being an inter view. "But I must see him," he persisted. "Tell him the Red Man is waiting for an audience." Trembling and awestruck at the im perious tone of the Phantom, Count de Mold again went on tiptoe to the royal room and delivered the mysterious mes sage. It is said when Napoleon heard this message he became a spectacle pitiable to behold. The Man of Iron grew ghastly white, and his arms dropped at his side like lead; but though he was completely un nerved, he managed to give orders for the admission of the unwelcome guest. Then there ensued one of the most ex traordinary conversations that ever were held. Count de Mold, whose curiosity had been raised to the highest pitch, played the eavesdropper, and overheard the greater part, if not all of the remarkable dialogue. " General," said the Red Spectre, "ThIh is the third time I have appeared before you as a man. The first time we met was in Egypt, at the Battle of the Pyra mids; the second, after the Battle ol Wagram. " When we met at Wagram, I granted you four more years in which to com plete the conquest of all Europe or to make a general peace, threatening that if you did not perform one of these two things within the allotted time I would withdraw my protection from you. "Now, I come for the third and last time to warn you that you have but three short months of power. In three months from this hour the Allies will be invad ing Paris if you do not take my advice and sue for peace. A general peace must be perfected within ninety days, else your sway will be limited to a small bleak island of the sea. Remember, all will be over with you if you do not achieve a conquest or accede to peace within that time." Napoleon then endeavoured, with a degree of superstition that is well nigh incredible in such a man-and yet not altogether strange either when one comes to think of it-to reason with the Phan tom and to extort easier terms. He pleaded that it was impossible for him to make an honourable peace in three short months. "Do as you please," returned the Red Man, "but I will not change my resolu tion. Now I go," he said, as he opened the door and strode down the hall, fol lowed by the Emperor and Mold, who pretended to have been standing on guard at the second door from the room in which the conversation had been held. His imperial Majesty begged of the Red Man to stay, but all to no purpose. "Three months-no longer," shouted the Spectre as he disappeared at the end ofthe hall. Just three months to a day from the time of the Red Ghost's warning, the Al lies entered Paris (Mairch, 3t, IS4), and Napoleon abdicated four days after wards. I-Ie was allowed to' retain the title of Emperor, but the sole sovereignty he exercised was over the tiny island of Elba, which was the little bleak isle of the sea that had been held up to his mind's eye by the Red Man in the pro phetic talk of the preceding New Year's Day. It is but fair to add that the official documents upon which the account of the Red Spectre's interview with Na poleon is based were signed by the Count de Mold and the guard. The former, it will be remembered, overheard the conversation; the latter attempted in vain to stop the Ghost when he demanded admission. Moreover, it is said that the story had been one of the traditions of the French Court ever since the singular visit took place. Still, the whole tale wears a very suspicious look, and it is given here with all reserve. We think our old friend Mr. Burchell,. of "The Vicar of Wakefield," would have uttered many a Fu_;dge! could he have read the statement of the Count de Mold. It is notorious that Napoleon was cre dulous. He had a firm belief in his star of destiny; and General Rapp has re corded an instance of the " Corsican Up start's" behaviour while under the influ ence of this curious spell. Rapp, whose irilliant defence of Dan zig was at the time the theme of univer sal animation, once suddenly called on Napoleon and walked into the latter's room wholly unannounced. The Emtperor sat by the window per fectly still, gazing intently upon the heavens. Noticing his Ipresencte hIad not been observedt, Rapisltsheda chair withl noise enou~sh to attact Naloleons's at-. tention. Yet thie latter madte no sign, and seemed utterly obliviouts of every thing. l'erceiviog this, Rappii rushed to the side of the Emperor, fearint tlhat hie had fallen into a stspor, when the latter, without taking his eyes from tIhe heavens for an instant, seized Rapp by thle arnm, and exclaimed in a loud tone of voice- " Look thlere; up there." " I see nollthing but thie pale, twinkling stars," retturned Rapp, quietly. S"\Vl;hat," exclaisled thle Emsperor, ex citedly;" is it possible that you do not see my star; the fiery red one, almost as large as the moon? It is before you now, and oh, Ihow brilliant." Then, warsming at the sight, he fairly shriceked as he cried out, " It has never abandoned me for a single instant : I see it on all great occa sions; it commands me to go foward ; it is my sign ofgood fortune, and where it leads I will follows." Rapp said that he really screansed .is he uttered the words " I will follow," andl that his face was livid as heseated himi self in confusion and suppressed excite ment. Several minutes elapsed before the Emperor was calm enough to take part in ordinary conversation. Cas.sd/'s Salt'urdat" Journal.
