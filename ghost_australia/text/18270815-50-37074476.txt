" POTATORIS.'' Epitaph on a Toper in the Church of the Holy Ghost at Sienna. Life-giving wine, that juice divine. My blissful days extended ; But death alas! has drained my glass, And all my pleasures ended. The social bowl my jovial soul Ere morn ne'er thought of quitting; A jolly fellow, his wine, till mellow, To leave is not befitting. My thirsty bones, beneath these stones, Cry out for irrigation ; In pity o'er my tomb then pour A copious libation. Next till a cup, and drink it up, Pure wine like ruby glowing ; This boon I pray, dear, traveller, pay, When from this place you 're going, Topers farewell ! where'er you dwell, May wine be most abounding ; Be all your lays of wine the praise, In Paeaus loud resounding,
