THE GRAVE DIGGER'S LAMENT. As true, sir, as I am alive, There's not a dead man in the town; They look up, and fatten, and thrive, I'd like to put some of them down. When people are happy and gay, And shoot in exuberant glee, Grave-digging's no part of the play— Which is a grave matter to me. At me they all jeeringly laugh, Ah, had they more crying to do, Td take all the grain from their chaff, Buy all animosity, too. But, never a coffin comes here, Save tins old casaof cough in my ohest; And never the sight of a bier, Gives hopes of a beer, or a crnst. I scaroe keep the wolf from the door, Of wolf snaps I've more than my share ; And at last I am left to deplore The want of a bottle of square. To my colon I always was true, In violet my promises were ; > Bat now the chameleon's hue Comes over me everywhere. My favourite color Is black, But I'm white In fit of the bines ; I'm don when the season is alack, And green when my tradesmen abase. But then Tm undoubtedly red, They know its not rosy with me ; My browns will scarce pay for my bread, I'm lead colored sadly yon see. The Olive I took for my briie Keeps telling me every day, I'm no longer a figure of pride, Bat growing both yellow and gray. There is no epidemic to cheer, The Fort's a clean man in the chair, Hence Deslandes' black horse comes not here Through Sanit'iy Morris, our Mayor. I surely must give np the ghost— If ghosts will not give np, I must, My creditors come in a host, And I muBt down with the dost. < GEORGE MATSON. Fort Adelaide, October, 1895.
