ROMAN CATHOLIC ORDERS. But can Cardinal Yaughan rely on the1 assumed orders of the Roman Catholic Church ? In the R.C. Directory, pub lished yearly by the. Roman Catholic Publishers, Burns, Oates & Co., Permissu Superiorum, a connecting line of Popes is put forward, which is not only full; of ' fictions, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies, exposed in a pamphlet issued by the Protestant Alliance, under the title of " Apostolic Succession" but varies mat erially from the list given by the R. C. Bishop Milner, from the list given by the learned Jesuits Labbe . and? Cossart, and from the list given' in the Corpus Juris Canonici, works of unquestionable author ity- 1 It would be impossible to refer fully to all the broken links that may b.e observed in the chain of succession, as 'given in the Directory, but, , it may be remarked that no mention is made of the Vacancies., in j the See of Rome, as given in the list of Labbe and . Cossart, who state, A.P., 1268, " the See was vacant 2 years, ,6 months, 2 days." — a.d. 1291, " the See was vacant 2 years, 3 months, 2 days." — A.ni 1313, "the See was vacant 2 years/ 3 months, 17 days." — A d. 1415,.,'.' the- See was vacant 2 years, 5 months, 10 days.",, No refer ence either, is/ made to the innumerable schisms created by rival Popes, as given by Labbe : and Cossart,- nor , is. there any allusion. ,to the Great , Western Schism which, rent the. Chnrch' of Rome, com?, mencing in the year 1378,. when for fifty years rival Popes , disputed tke right to , the Papal Chair.? High Roman Catholic authorities can be produced in support of the claims' of . each, of the: rival Popep. Christendom was about equally divided in their, support. They are mot only, cursed and excommunicated, one another,/ but also tbe adherents and followers of their opponent. /The main. Roman argument for. the existence, of qu.infallible guide in thq Church is, thatf it. is, inconceivable; that God could 'have ! , left ., Christians : exposed to the .'risk' of. error in, matters concerning their eternal salyatipn, . during, these .fffty years,, private . persons . were consigned to. eternal , damnation by one or other of these .infallible Popes for acknowledging the rights of bis. rival', arid Christendom \fas kept! in a state qf miser able perplexity. < \- Romish .
