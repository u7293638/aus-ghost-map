ENGLISH NEWS- 1>EATH OF THE DUKJEJ OF ORLEANS. ; !' WE perceive from the Morning Chronicle of the, 15 th "July, that this young and gafllantprince has come t6 an untimely Vend. It'appears, that his ;Royal Highness the DukeofOrleans was going to Weuilly to take leave of his august father previous to his setting, out for St.Omer. On the roa<J,de la Hevolte, the horses of his carriage ran off ; the Prince leaped out and had a tremendous fall, Having pitched, on his head. He "was taken up senseless and carried into a netghbojiring house. Assistance was immediately obtained.; he was bled and' leeches were applied, but every effort was in vain. The Prince died about ifour o'clock. " TheKing aceom^anied by the Queen and 'Madame Adelaide, happened to arrive atthespotalmost at the time the Prince was taken up. The scene was •heart-retiding. The body of the unfortunate Prince was plaeed on a litter and carried by the soldiers to the chapel of the chateau OfNeuilly. The King, Queen, Madame A delaide and the Duke d'Auraale followed jari foot, the melancholy train which was escorted by a battalion of the J 7th regiment.; the soldiers had tears in their eyes. Behind the litter, mingled with the members of the' Royal Family, walked the ministers, officers of all ranks, and citizens of. every class, who had fathered together on the first ®ewa of the catastrophe. This melancholy occurrence has caused the greyest consternation in France. The Threes at the Cafe de Paris on Wednesday evening, were down as low -as 76f. then got to 77, and left off at 76f. 75 c. at half- past nine o'clock. As will be seen by an extract below, great cdncern has been expressed by her Majesty Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, for this disastrous calamity. The Duke 'of Orleans was born at Palermo 1 , -on the 2nd, September, 1810., so that lie" was only thirty-two 4# at the time of his death. His mother, Marie Amelie, the present Q-ueen of the French, is daughter of Ferdinand, Kincr of the Two Sicilies, and whom Louis Phillipo." .espoused at the time when he was wandering about as plain Due D'Orleans. We hear from undoubted authority that when, the truly sad and distressing Intelligence of the death Gf the Due d'Orleans was conveyed to the Queen at Claremont, her Majesty could not refrain from weeping. Autograph letters of condolence from her Majesty and Prince Albert tri the aflcted royal family of France have already been despatched.— London Paper. A GHOST IN THE TOWEB.—-STRANGE AFFAIR.-—The good people in the Tower of London, civil and military, the Ordnance officials, the! warders, and various, others, lay and clerical, who compose the population within the fortresses, and whose imaginations must be often haunted with the (jleeds of darkness., the butcheries and murders perpetrated by tyrannical mbnarchs, Roman Ca|hoHe Priests, and usurpers in the old ' Smldings, of the place, have been lately thrown into a state of excitement and wonder by a very strange appearance^ which hajs, given rise to muph speculation. About a month ago, a soldier named, Simpson, belonging to the Coldstream Guards, was stationed onenight as a sentinel in front of tie Jewel- office, ; the very post where the assault was committed by. Elder on. private Youl. Soon . after that hour when it is said "Churchyards yawn, and graves give up their dead," the guard on reserve were not a little astonished at Simpson rushing into the Guard house In a jstate of great fright, with his musket in his;<hand. The; soldiers'present jdeimanded• ;Of Him why he had left so abruptly this post, and one so important the Jewel-office where the regalia is kept ? ^ Simpson, whose senses appeared disordered, and ; who stared wijdly aroundj could make no reply, and - directly swooned away. It was some time before he recovered, and when he, did so, His inind was evidently disturbed; hje^raved incoherently, and declared that the. cause of iris terror was a ghost, wBipkjha^ppeared to him on h;s post, lie continued ^aying^ about the ghost /or son^e ho>urs afterwards, and on being £li£Stiofced by his officers, who suspected of a .das- that-a' ghost had suddenly appeared to him in front of the^ AeWel'-Qffice, that it was dressed in white, and appeared to be a wom an without a head. Simpson afterwards relaps^ into a state: of delirium, in which state he was removed to the infirmary, where for several days his life was despaired of. -i At intervals he was again questioned about the spectre, and he stated that he. could not see where it came from, but it suddenly appeared alongside of him, and . he immediately fled, and was pursued by the ghost some distance- • When the story got wind in the tower, various were the conjectures of the inhabitants. Some persons asserted that $he ghost without a head-larks that .of . - Anna /iBoleyni" the -.-Queen 6f Henry the VtIL, or Lady Jane Grey, the victim of the bloody Queen Mary, who were both decapitated in the Tower, and many old ladies. in the fortress gravely declared, that the ghosts of those unfortunate Queens . were doomed to visit the earth periodically, and that mighty ehanges were to be expected. The authorities in the Tower, however, after a careful investigation, came to the conclusion that Simpson, who was known to fee a very careful, sober, and brave man, had been visited by something more substantial than a ghost, and suspecting that an attempt might be made to plunder the jewel- office, or do some other mischief under cover of a pretended spectre, they ordered * the guard to be doubled and relieved every hour, .and at the same time directed the sentinels on duty to give an immediate alarm if they saw anything unusual. These precautions had the desired effect, the ghost did not again make its appearance, but singular enough, only three nights after the double guard had neen discontinued., Mr Elder made his appearance to the sentinel on duty at the jewel-office, and assaulted him, as we have described elsewhere. THE COURT.^—The court wilt go into mourning next week for the late Duke of Orleans, The Royal Family wear mourning immediately. The Queen and the Princess of Saxe Coburg. Gotha left Clareinont for Hampton Court Palace, in a pony phajton, at half-past nine on Friday morning. Prince Albert aud the Prince of Sfexe Coburg riding on hor«ebaek s the Viscountess 'Canning, Lady in Waiting, following in another pony carriage, and Col. Grey and Col. Bouverie attending on horseback. PRUSSIA.—A private letter from Posen expresses serious fears for the consequences of the projected visit'of the King of Prussia to St, Petersburgh, There has, as our readers will recollect existed a treaty between Prussia and Russia, for the reciprocal surrender of deserters from those States respectively. The term of the treaty has expired, and a proposition for the renewal of it has been made to the Prussian Government on the part of the Emperor Nicholas. " If it be acceded to," say our letters, ''the King will have for ever destroyed the popularity he has gained, for there iafe fn ; the Prussian States at this moment no fewer than ; 50,000 deserters or refugees in Kussiah Poland. For the sake, therefore, of the King's own popularity and welfare, as well as on the score of humanity, let us hope that his Majesty will not commit an error so great as to renew tlie treaty now happily at aii end." During the month of April 13,000 emigrants have sailed from the port of Liverpool for the United ^States; arid 2,000 more for Canada. ; N^W ROMAIF CATHOLILC CITHEDRAL.. —Nearly £40,000 have been subscribed^ for the purpose of erecting a new .Roman Catholic Cathedral, on a most magnificent scale, in the ancient city of York. The ground and buildings have been . already purchased, and some of the latter i have'been pulled down. THE INCOME TAX;.—Officers* widows ! residing in Dublin have been surprised j by the receipt of circulars from the •j office of the Paymaster- General of the Forces, containing three forms of certificates for their immediate -signature, with reference to the amount of their incomes It appears- that the .residence of this class ; of persons, in Ireland will not exempt them from: the payment of their prouortion of the Income Tax, in cases- were the yearly income of the party amonnts to thefataL.£150, per annum.' If- tbey have any other source of revenue whiclr with the pension will r^ise the income to: £150, tpartyalso/be liable.* Bimj ilar documents have been ^served din''all half-pay and other officers receiving pensions out of the Consolidated Fund. NEWSPAPER.—The newspaper is the chronicle of civilization the common re- i servoir into which every stream pours its living watery, at which every man can come and drink: it is the newspaper which gives to liberty its practical life—,. its constant • observation—its perpetual vigilance—its unrelenting activity. The newspaper is a daily%nd sleepless watchman, that reports to you every danger, whiehmenaces the institutions of your country, and its interests, at home and abroad. The newspaper informs the legislator of public opinlon, and it informs ihe people of acts of legislation thus keeping up that constant sympathy, that good understanding between people and legislators, which conduces to the maintenance of order, and prevents the stern necessity for revolution. THE WELLINGTON ARCADE. —A new and splendid arcade is about to be erected, extending from Wellington- • street north, immediately opposite to the portico of the English Opera House, to Catherine-street, Strand, the boarding for which has been erected, and the preliminary clearings for it already" commenced. THE PREMIER AND THE PUSEYITES. —It is currently reported that the Puseyite party in Oxford University has gained a triumph by obtaining from the Premier the appointment of the Pu ?eyite Archdeacon (the Rev. Robert Wilberforce) to the Reg?us Professorship of Modern History, vacant by the decease of Or. Arnold. Is this appointment to be regarded as an acknow» ledgement of Archdeacon Wilberforce's vote against the removal of the interdict on Dr. Hampden, which was prevented by the Puseyite party in the University ? THE VULGAR RICH.—Sir Robert Peel, in his speech ia the House of Commons, on Mr Hume's motion, that an humble address be presented to her Majesty, praying that she will be graciously pleased to give directions to the trustees of the British Museum, aud of National Gallery, to the authorities having charge of the Armoury and Jewels in the Tower of London, to the Commissioners of Grenwich Hospital, and to all other persons having the management or direction of public edifiees and cathedrals, for facilitating the openiug of those buildings to tne public on Sundays, paid a high compliment to the industrious classes. Sir Robert said it was not the poor who could not afford to pay the price of admission, that damaged works of art, but the vulgar rich, - EMIGRANTS, &c.;—Over 3,000 people, says the New ,York Herald, landed in the city of New York in.the last two days, including agriculturists and all kinds of mechanics. In the city they cannot remain. We have 4,000 persons of our o wn already out of. employ, and the Mmber Isfteljr .thrown adrift by the! navy has add^d tb the c^amity.- To the cduhtry then tiSy must go, and there is room enough for all if they will but follow good advice. The countries of Delaware and Ulster, 50 to 100 miles west of Catskill, on the North Bivei, offers the best prospects to the settler— good land, and fine health on the mountains. To these people we say, go to the mountainous parts of Delaware and Ulster, and see the Scotch and Welch settlement in the vicinity of Delhi, ' The; lands recomtnended may be reached in two days. It is folly to go to the west,away from all kindred, friends, and connexions. There ' arrived at Quebec this year 16,292 emigrants; last year, 13,509; increase so far 2,783.
