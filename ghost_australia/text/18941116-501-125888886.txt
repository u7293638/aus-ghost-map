Thrashing a ' Ghost.' At West Stafford, a village near Dor chester (E.), considerable excitement had been caused by the rumors of ghosts waltzing nightly. Ultimately a search party was formed, both men and women being armed with sticks. On arriving at a gate they saw a figure upon it draped in white ; the crowd pressed forward, and the leaders severely thrashed the ghost, who screamed for mercy. He was found to be a labourer of the village, whose wife was one of tlie attacking party. He was so bruised that he had to go to tho Dorset Hos pital.
