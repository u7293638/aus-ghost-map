THE TELEPHONE TO BENDIGO. What is being done in connection with the extension of the long-distance tele- phone from Melbourne to Bendigo? Very little, we believe, but we are not very greatly surprised, this having been the prevailing at- titude of the governing authorities to- wards Bendigo ever since the present re- gime was inaugurated. It is very sur- prising that long ago Bendigo, which is far and away the most thriving mining and commercial centre in Victoria, was not telephonically connected with the capital. The impression prevails else- where that this work has been done, for in one of yesterday’s Melbourne papers we see that it is taken as a matter of course that “already Melbourne is connected with Ballarat, Geelong and Ben- digo.” Unfortunately the lively ima- gination of our contemporary’s ready writer outstrips the performance of what he calls the “Unprogressive de- partment over which Mr. Duffy so peace- fully and contentedly presides.” It is remarkable that the department—even the famous high-kicking department— should be so neglectful of its duty as to leave Bendigo completely out of it, whilst experience has shown that the telephone line from Melbourne via Geelong to Bal- larat, is proving such a popular conveni- ence that the public wire is being dupli- cated. It is paying the department well to do this work, notwithstanding that it must, of necessity, take away business from the telegraph branch of the department. We are told that the public telephone wire to Ballarat is an inestimable boon as be- tween the Melbourne and Ballarat specu- lators in mining shares. During the pre- sent Glenfine racket the telephone is play- ing an important part in buyers’ and sel- lers’ negotiations. Brokers who can get on to the telephone instrument have a great advantage over those who have to wait for the slow process of telegraphing and the then much slower process of the messenger lad taking out a sheaf of mes- sages and delivering them in rotation at their respective near and far addresses. So valuable is the advantage which tele- phone communication gives to smart wide-awake brokers that one Ballarat broking firm is offering the Government £5 a week for the privilege of a wire of its own. If, therefore, the telephone has been of so much value during the past few weeks to the broking and commercial community of Ballarat, is it not certain that it would be found equally valuable to the people of Bendigo? The parties most interested should remonstrate against the extraordinary backwardness of the department. The extension of the tele- phone to Bendigo is not an expensive work. Yet it is apparently too expensive an item to be justified from the Govern- ment’s point of view by the political in- fluence or energy which this city and dis- trict can at present bring to bear. Consequent on the application of the Ballarat broking firm for the exclusive use of a wire between Melbourne and Bal- larat, the question has arisen whether the department is under any circumstances justified in granting a monopoly of such a character. It appears that the poles will only carry six more wires, so that at the utmost only six more firms could be ac- commodated with special wires. It is said that the rental offered of £250 a year would repay the Government for the cost of fixing an additional wire. But the wire is only part of the capital cost of telephonic communication. The poles and instruments have to be taken into ac- count, and it will then be seen that a fair rental is a very different thing from the sum offered by the Ballarat firm. But there are very special reasons why no special wires should be granted to stock- dealing firms—not if they offer a thou- sand a year apiece for the privilege. It can only pay them by getting before- hand with the public and with other brokers less fortunately circumstanced. On the principle of the greatest good to the greatest number, we are sure that the public of Victoria do not wish that any of the Government departments should be so used as to work into the hands of stock exchange operators. Outside in- vestors find it difficult—impossible we might say —to keep up as it is with those within the inner circle of professional Speculator-dom. If to the advantages which these professional persons possess special monopolistic facilities for market operating were granted, the case of the outside or amateur investor would be much more uncertain and unsatisfactory than it is at present. So also would be the position of the less wealthy class of brokers, amongst whom are often to be found some of the more scrupulous and trustworthy men of the market. The de- partment should once and for all set its face against granting special wires to broking or stock-jobbing firms. It is not for the public interest that the depart- ment should be so used. It is no part of the duty of the Government of Victoria to give Broker A and his clients a pull of the sharemarket in Melbourne, Ballarat or Bendigo, at the expense of Broker B and his clients.

The Govern- ment Astronomer’s forecast for to-day is: — “Moderately fine over west and central parts of the colony, but cloudy with some occa- sional light rain in the eastern districts ; calms and light variable winds chiefly north ; foggy or misty at coastal places ; slight to smooth sea generally.” The Rainfall.—Splendid rain commenced to fall yesterday to the joy of gardeners and farmers, but to the disgust of business people and others whose callings took them into wet places. Up to 10 o’clock last night, when the rain had ceased, 34 points were registered. There are prospects of more rain to-day. The Death of Miss Reed.—The death of Miss Reed, daughter of Mr. Reed, one of the officers of the Bendigo City Council, and re- ferred to in yesterday’s issue, was terribly sudden. A Traralgon correspondent says : — Miss Reed, the forewoman of Messrs. Leslie and Co.’s dressmaking department, left the workroom on Monday to go into the shop for some material, when she was taken sud- denly ill, and became unconscious. She died within half-an- hour. She had been away from business for a week through illness, and resumed work on Monday contrary to medi- cal advice. Her death resulted from failure of the heart’s action through weakness of the system, consequent on sickness. She was about 30 years of age, and a native of Ben- digo. Complimentary.—The officers and teachers of St. Paul’s Sunday school are tendering a complimentary musical evening to the Ven. Archdeacon MacCullagh on the anni- versary of his birthday on Tuesday, June 6. The Barambogie Strike.—On Monday (says a Chiltern correspondent) Mr. John Cock, superintendent of the Barambogie mine, and Mr. Geo. Hawke, president of the A.M.A. of Victoria, discussed the situa- tion relative to the strike. The interview was unofficial, but there is reason to believe that the trouble is approaching settlement. The strike committee meet at once to con- sider proposals submitted by the manage- ment for return to work. Deposing the Rev. S. H. Ferguson.— At meeting of the North Melbourne Presbytery yesterday the Rev. S. H. Fer- guson was deposed for teaching doctrines not in accord with what is called the “Westminster confession.” He refused to appear before the Presbytery, and was dealt with in his absence. After long discussion in points of procedure the Rev. A. Stewart read a motion, which was to the effect that, inasmuch as the Rev. Mr. Ferguson had re- fused to obey the citation, and had defied the injunctions of the Presbytery, he was found guilty of aggravated contumacy, and of the charge of heresy preferred against him in the libel which the court had found relevant; and that the Rev. S. H. Ferguson be disposed from the office of the holy minis- try. The motion was declared by the Modera- tor to be carried unanimously, in spite of a protest from a gentleman on the side benches. The Presbytery then engaged in prayer, after which the Moderator pro- nounced the formal deposition, as follows: —“In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the sole king and head of the church, and by virtue of the power and authority com- mitted by Him to it, I do now solemnly depose Samuel Hector Ferguson, minister of the congregation of Northcote, from the office of the holy ministry, prohibiting and discharging him from exercising the same, or any part thereof in all time coming, and I do declare the church of Northcote vacant from and after the date of this assurance.” Must be Educated.—“Even if in Rags.”— Manfred Rodwell was charged at the St. Kilda court yesterday with neglecting to send his child, Ernest, to school. Truant- officer Collingwood said the child had not been to school for twelve months. Defend- ant : “I am only earning 13s a week stone- breaking. The child had not a shirt or boots to go in. I have just managed to get him a shirt, and now am summoned.” Major Krone, J.P. : “You must send your children to school.” Defendant: “Well, if they will take them barefooted they can go.” Major Krone: “They must go in rags if you have no means of clothing them.” Defendant: “The last time they went the teachers sent them home, and told them not to come.” Major Krone : “You will be fined 2s 6d, or six hours.” Defendant: “Well, I’ll take them to the school to-morrow, and see if the teachers will have them.”— Herald. W.C.T.U. Concert.—An excellent concert, arranged by M r. W. H. Ferber’s Sunday- school class, was held under the auspices of the W.C.T.U. at the Temperance Hall last evening. Mr. Ferber was in the chair. The following programme of vocal and instru- mental music was gone through, to the en- joyment of all present:—Overture, piano, Misses Mitchell, Holman and Budden ; quartette, “Sweet and Low,” Misses Wil- lan and Nicholls and Messrs. Thomas and Roberts ; song, “Man of Sorrows, Mr. Stan. Hall (encored); recitations, Messrs. C. Tilson and W. Hocking and Misses An- derson and Fairbrother ; song, “The Gift,” Miss Ethel Brown ; song, “By the Foun- tain,” Mr. E. H. Collett (encored); piano duet, the Messrs. Johns; vocal duet, “See the Land,” Miss Brown and Mr. E. H. Collett ; song, Miss Griffiths ; song, “Dear Heart,” Miss Willan ; quartette, “God is a Spirit,” Misses Brown and Messrs. Collett and Hall. The accompaniments were ably played by Mr. Alex. J. Pearce. Miner’s Rights.—An Important Opinion. —At yesterday’s meeting of the Sandhurst Mining Board, a communication was re- ceived from the Department of Mines and Water Supply, submitting a copy of the Crown Solicitor’s opinion recently asked for at the suggestion of Mr. Phillips, in con- nection with section 14 of the Mines Act 1890, respecting neglecting to renew expir- ing miner’s rights within the prescribed period of one month. The opinion of the Crown solicitor was as follows : —“I am not quite sure whether I understand the ques- tion, but I assume what is intended to be asked is whether the neglect in taking out the miner’s rights immediately following the expiration of the old right renders the interest held liable to forfeiture before the end of one month. If this is the question, in my opinion the answer would be, ‘Yes.’ It is, I think, liable to be forfeited at any time after the expiring of the old right, but even should proceedings to enforce the forfeiture of the claim be taken during the month, the fact of obtaining a renewal before the expiration of the month would de- feat the proceedings, even though the right was renewed after such proceedings were commenced, provided, of course, the renew- al was obtained within the month. As- suming no proceedings are taken to enforce the forfeiture until after the expiration of the month, if the holder has no right at the date of the proceedings having been taken, the forfeiture can be enforced, even if the holder may have a right at the hearing, but, according to the decision of Mr. Justice A’Beckett, in the case of Tinswell v. Woods the fact that there is a continuity of the right is not a ground of forfeiture if the holder had a right at the time of the proceedings for forfeiture were instituted. This is in conflict with an earlier decision of Mr. Jus- tice Hood, in the case of Abraham v. Della Co., so far as regards residence areas, which again was overruled in a case of Vial v. Al- lander; therefore the case of a claim can be distinguished from that of a residence area. Mr. Justice A’Beckett’s decision must be accepted as good law. E. J. D. Guiness, Crown solicitor.” Loyal Heart of Friendship Lodge.— The fortnightly meeting was held in the Oddfellows’ Hall in Monday evening. Bro- J. M. Cook, P.G., presided. The lodge- room was draped in mourning out of re- spect to the late members—Bros. J. Bul- len and J. Dorr. One new member was ini- tiated, and three propositions received. Bros. C. Houstin, P.P.G.M. ; L. G. H. Anderson, P.G. ; J. Vafiopulous, G.M., and J. M. Cook, P.G., were elected delegates to the district meeting to be held on June 6\. A circular was received from Bro. S. H. McGowan, P.C.S., asking members to attend the Manchester Unity Hospital Sunday parade on June 11. The receipts for the evening amounted to £75 and £29 2s. 2d. sick-pay was passed for payment. Bro. W. Stubbs, D.P.G.M., responded to the toast of district officers, and Bro. Trounce to the toast of visiting brethren. Children and Mine Firewood Stacks.— At the City Police Court yesterday a girl named Mabel Argyle, about thirteen years of age, was charged by Senior-Constable O’Keefe with stealing 124 lb. of wood, valued at 1s. 3d., from the Carlisle, North Garden Gully and Passbye Mine. Mr. Dunlop, who appeared for the defendant, urged that she did not know she was doing wrong. She had gone to get chips, and had come away with some rather large pieces of wood. He asked the bench to give the girl a lecture and let her go on condition that she promised not to commit the offence again. Mr. Jewell, the mana- ger of the mine, said he did not object to children taking chips, but one of the pieces of wood the child appropriated weighed 64 lb. He did not desire that a conviction should be recorded, but would like the bench to warn her, so that it would be a caution to others. The bench accordingly severely lectured the child, and allowed her to go on her promising not to steal any more wood. A Recreation Reserve for Long Gully.— A meeting of the residents of Long Gully was held in the Mechanics’ Institute last evening to consider the best means of se- curing a recreation reserve for the district. Mr. Ambrose Dunstan, who presided, stated that as the City Council was raising a loan of £30,000, it was a good time to ask for a grant of £500 towards the construction of a recreation reserve at Long Gully. Other por- tions of Bendigo had their reserves, and he thought Long Gully was justly entitled to one. The difficulty seemed to be that there was hardly any ground available for the purpose. The opinion was generally ex- pressed by those present that immediate ac- tion should be taken, so that something de- finite should be laid before the City Council on Friday. It was then resolved on the mo- tion of Mr. J. H. Weller, that a committee, consisting of Messrs. A. Dunstan, Hocking, Eva and Wilson, interview councillors and ask for a grant of £500 for a recreation re- serve. The most suitable sites to the locality were considered by the meeting to be the piece of land used at present as a cricket ground, or better still, the large space of ground below it. Insolvency.—A meeting of creditors in the estate of Albert Ridley Curnow, of Garsed street, grocer, was held at the office of the chief clerk, Mr. Beaven, yes- terday. Seven creditors, representing £175 6s. 2d., were present personally and by proxy. Mr. E. W. Small, of Melbourne, was elected trustee of a remuneration of 5 per cent. on the net amount realised. Dogs and Poultry.—The secretary desires the members of the Bendigo Dog and Poul- try Society who intend to exhibit their col- lies and Leghorn fowls at the next monthly meeting to notify him so that proper ar- rangements may be made. The Ballarat Ghost.—The “Courier” says that the idiot who is playing “ghost” ap- peared on the White Flat on Monday night, and was chased by several men with dogs. Unfortunatey the “ghost” had too good a start. If he had broken his neck when he jumped the fence he would have “given up the ghost” in a good cause. City Police Court.—Messrs. Harkness, Hedley, Anderson, Gibson and Hoskins presided yesterday. A drunkard was dis- charged. A cabdriver was fined 5s., with 2s. 6d. costs, for plying for hire off his rank, and two cyclists were mulcted in similar amounts for riding on the foot- path. Debt cases were dealt with as fol- lows :—Edwards and Lee v. P. M. O’Dwyer, £1 2s. 3d., costs 18s. 6d. ; Geo. Prit- chard v. M. J. Chisholm, £18 4s., costs 26s. Benevolent Asylum and Lying in Hospital. The committee met yesterday afternoon. Present—The president (Mr. D. Watson), in the chair, Messrs. Claridge, Crofts, Good- isson and Birch. An apology was received from Major Kirby. Five applicants were awarded aid by orders on stores, 49 in kind from the institution. Aid in four cases was discontinued, two pairs of blankets and one pair of boots were granted to needy per- sons, and two men were admitted. Reports were received from the medical officer (Dr. J. D. Boyd), superintendent (Mr. J. S. M‘Ilroy), and collector (Mr. R. B. Sibley). Two hundred and fifty-six distributions were made outdoor during the week to families, consisting of 260 adults and 93 children, and there are in the institution 220 males, 46 females ; total, 266. Three hundred Miles in 33 Days.—After a passage of 33 days from Snowy River, the ungainly looking little ketch Peterell brought her cargo of maize to Hobson’s Bay late on Sat- urday night. She started (says the Age) from Melbourne in charge of Captain Peter- son and two hands on April 16, was blown round to Snowy River in good time, loaded, and left on the return voyage on April 22. Ten days afterwards the Government steamer Lady Loch made a search for her in vain, and it was considered that she had been lost in the heavy gales which prevailed between April 25 and 27. Most unexpectedly, how- ever, the lighthouse keeper reported that the Peterell had called in at Cliffy Island and had been supplied with shipwreck stores. Since then the ketch’s movements have formed the subject of daily coastal tele- grams. Captain Peterson states that after leaving Snowy River he made fair progress for three days, when he struck the south- west gales. He had the ketch hove-to, but was blown through the group of islands known as Kent’s, and then out to sea. The provisions gave out, and all hands had to subsist on the maize cargo, which they ground up and boiled. Their health seemed to improve on this diet, but their fears were from scarcity of water, and it was only with the strictest economy that their supply held out. University Extension. —The second of the series of six lectures on “Music” by Herr Scharf, given in connection with the Bendigo centre of the University Extension Move- ment, was delivered last night in the lecture hall of the School of Mines. Despite the un- favorable weather there was a considerable attendance. Herr Scharf traced in an inter- esting manner the history of stringed instru- ments, and the development of music gene- rally down to the sixteenth century. The lecturer supplied practical illustrations on the pianoforte. Daughters of Temperance.—A social will be held in the Temperance Hall to-night, commencing at 8. An attractive programme has been provided of leading local vocalists, after which refreshments will be partaken of and parlor games indulged in. Congregational.—The 41st anniversary of the Congregational Sunday school will be further celebrated to-night (Wednesday) by a tea meeting in the school room at 6.30 and concert in church at 8. A fine pro- gramme has been arranged, consisting of songs, duets, recitations, also choruses by the scholars under the conductorship of Mr. Parker. Dredging for Gold.—It is expected that Mr. Foster, thet Minister of Mines, will visit Newstead and Joyce’s Creek this week, in connection with leases that have been applied for for dredging purposes, and to ascertain how far these can be granted along the course of the River Loddon without injury to the agri- cultural and pastoral interests. At the meet- ing of the Twelve-Mile Irrigation and Water Supply Trust at Macorna, a resolution was unanimously carried, asking the members of Parliament for the district to use their in- fluence to prevent the issue of any more dredging leases on the Loddon River until a Royal commission had been appointed. It is feared that if the dredging is allowed on the Loddon it will result in the filling of the Laanecoorie storage basin with slum. An Injured M.L.A.—Mr. Rawson, M.L.A., was in Melbourne on Monday for the first time since he met with a bicycling accident two months ago. He was riding the ma- chine near Kyneton, and was going at a good pace when his hat blew off. In making an effort to catch it he overbalanced him- self, and received a severe fall, injuring his knee-cap and straining the sinews of the left leg. For some weeks he had to use crutches, but yesterday he was able to get along with the aid of a walking-stick. Returning.—Mr. Best and Mr. Trenwith left Auckland for Sydney on Monday the steamer Westralia. Phylloxera in New South Wales.—A strong body of vignerons in the Liverpool district are up in arms aginst the methods employed by the Government to eradicate the phylloxera pest. They intend to ask for the establishment of a zone system of periodical inspection near the infested areas. Divorce of the “Struck Oil” Partners.— The divorce suit of Williamson versus Wil- liamson was heard before Mr. Justice G. B. Simpson, in the Sydney Supreme Court, on Monday morning. The petitioner was Marga- ret Virginia Williamson, commonly known as Maggie Moore, and the respondent was James Cassius Williamson, theatrical man- ager. A decree for the dissolution of the marriage was applied for on the ground of respondent’s adultery, between 1897 and 1899, with Miss Mary Weir, at Ithaca road, Eliza- beth Bay, near Sydney. The suit was un- defended. Jane Laurie, a married woman, residing at Darlinghurst, gave evidence as to Mr. Williamson’s relations with Miss Weir. James Edward Sullivan, hotelkeeper, said that he was formerly on the stage, under the name of James Moore. He knew respon- dent, and remembered the occasion of his marriage with the petitioner, which took place in St. Mary’s Cathedral, San Francisco. The petitioner was his sister, and was a Roman Catholic. Mr. Kelynack said that was all the evidence he was prepared to call. Justice Simpson then found the issue proved, and ordered a decree nisi, returnable in one month, with costs against the respondent. A Plague of Mice.—In the Cannum dis- trict (Wimmera), the damp, cold weather is driving immense numbers of mice out of the wheat paddocks into the farm houses and hay stacks, where they are doing a great amount of damage. In the houses they are destroying clothes hanging against the walls and eating away the lining and wall paper. Many of the old residents of the Wimmera state that a plague of mice is a sure forerunner of a bountiful harvest. Almost Scalped.—A little girl named Airy Chase, a grand-daughter of the late Canon Chase, was injured in a terrible manner on the Queen’s Birthday, through being bitten by St. Bernard dog. The child, who resides in Punt road, Prahran, was taken for a walk by her mother during the afternoon of the 24th inst., and as they passed a pad- dock in High street, Prahran, the child evinc- ed some interest in a pony which was runn- ing inside. To give her a better view of the animal, Mrs, Chase took the little girl in her arms, and held her head over the top of the fence, upon which a huge St. Ber- nard dog leaped upon her, and fastened his teeth in her face. Mrs. Chase battled with the dog, and eventually, when he relaxed his hold, pulled her child into safety, nearly dead with shock, and with her face covered with blood. The mother, fearful that the bitten one might be badly hurt, hurried with her to the Alfred Hospital, where Mr. Hearn, M.B., found that she was in a very serious condition. Just missing the child’s eye with his fang, the dog had torn the flesh of her forehead back, and dragged the eyelid and eyebrow completely out of their place. The little sufferer was at once admitted to the hospital, and is now making favorable pro- gress towards recovery. Stealing a Judge’s Oranges.—A couple of heavily laden orange trees, the pride of Mr. Justice Holroyd’s garden, in East St. Kilda, proved too great a temptation for some co- vetous persons on Sunday night. A raid was made on the garden, and the lower branches of the orange trees, were almost stripped of their luscious fruits. About 200 oranges were removed. A Girl’s Shocking Suicide.—A shocking tragedy occurred at Sunny Corner, New South Wales, late on Saturday night. An unmarried woman named Harriet Smith, aged 19 years, blew the top of her head off by putting the muzzle of a gun to her mouth and pulling the trigger with a tape attached to her foot. Her mother and brother were away from home at the time. Deceased was aunt of the child Guyot, who was lost in the bush at Easter time, and this had preyed upon her mind a good deal of late. Playing Bushrangers.— Four Walhalla boys were playing at bushranging, and one of them, 14 years of age, named Claxton, was shot with a revolver bullet in the shoul- der by a companion named Bain. Claxton, whose condition is critical, has been sent to Melbourne, in order that a skiagraph may be taken to locate the bullet for extraction. Immorality and Murder.—The inquiry in- to the death of the young woman Kate Far- mer in Sydney has closed. Evidence was given to the effect that an illegal operation had been performed on the woman. A Syd- ney “specialist,” Herbert Stanton Dick, was present, in custody, and the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against him. He was committed for trial. The Sydney Burial Scandals.—The case against John Moss, sexton of the Sydney cemetery, who was charged with having dis- interred a dead body without lawful author- ity, was concluded in the police court on Monday. For the prosecution it was stated that defendant had been instructed to pre- pare a grave for an interment on the 9th inst., and that he had re-opened an old grave, and removed from it a child’s coffin and portions of a larger coffin. For the defence John Moss stated that he was digging a grave in ground which he thought was unoccupied, when he discovered a child’s coffin about four feet down, and below this the boards of a child’s coffin. He took these from the grave and covered them from view, intending to replace them when the new interment had taken place. The magistrate discharged de- fendant, as it was clear that there was no intention to exhume the body for gain or profit. Messrs. J. C. Walker and Co. announce that on June 17 they will offer at auction the well- known Boort Flour Mill, together with five acres of land and a four-roomed house. The mill is far famed, it being in the centre of a large wheat growing district. Full particulars are ad- vertised. Messrs. R. O’Neill and Co. advertise on im- portant sale of freehold property and two acres of land at Kangaroo Flat to- day on account of Dr. O’Donnell, also all his well-kept furni- ture in lots to suit purchasers. The Sandhurst Pioneer Co-operative Co., Limited, announce a stock-taking sale. The windows are tastefully arranged with a splendid assortment of crockery, glassware, electroplate, wedding and birthday presents, lamps, etc., and the prices marked should certainly have the eff- fect of reducing the stock very rapidly.
