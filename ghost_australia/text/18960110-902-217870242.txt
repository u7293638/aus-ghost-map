Original Ghosts. Clandon House, near Guildford, which belongs to the Earl of Onslow, but is at present let by his lordship to a tenant, is honored by the visitation, not of one ghost only, but of three, all of an original and peculiar character. For some time the domestics employed in the mansion have repeatedly seen a beautiful lady attired in a cream colored silk dress, and wearing what they describe as 'quite lovely jewels.' Sometimes she covers the cream colored silk with a black cloak, and occasionally she carries a knife or a tumbler in her hand. Her favorite haunting ground appears to be chiefly the state bedchamber and the apartment known as the Yellow Room, which were shut up for a very long time, but were thrown open again when the present occupier took the mansion some five or six years ago. In addition to the 'lady in cream,' there is also frequently seen an apparition in the form of a very ugly female black dwarf, with a glittering ring in her nose, and whose dress indicates a condition of servitude. She also carried about a lighted lantern. There is also said to be a rough looking man, with a beard that is evidently the pride of his ghostly existence, but he has only sought the acquaintance of a few of the domestics. The under footman stoutly maintains that once he saw the 'lady in cream' take a book from the library shelves, and, after glancing through its pages, carefully replace it. A lady spiritualist in the locality has bad the hardihood to converse with ihe cream laid spook, who, it is reported, related as sad a story as ever ghost told. In her time she was the precursor of the Woman who Did, and her husband found it out. He accordingly bribed the black dwarf— his wife's attendant— to kill her mistress, which she did, and has ever since been going about with a lighted lantern looking for forgiveness.
