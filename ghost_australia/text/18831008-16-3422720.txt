ADELAIDE AND DION MT V "DlOXElTlI' "Yes, my lady " The maid and her mistress were in Adelaide's di cssing room and Dionetta was brushing her lady's hair, which hung down in neb heavy waves The Advocate's wife was proud of her hair, and often wished it were the fashion to wear it loose, so that she might prove to men women, of eouiso,didnotneedthepioof, they could see with half an eye, as the saying is that she had no occasion to call in th" rid of art It took his years off her age when he has hung over her shoulders, as it was doing now She smiled at herself in the glass, before which she was sitting, and her smile became more joyous as she noted the whiteness of her teeth and the beautiful expression of her mouth She was never tired of admit ing her beauty), it was to her a most precious possession, of which nothing could 106 hot but time The idea of growing old was soicpugnaut to her that she thought of it as little as possible ' fell i) is mine," she frequently said to herself, and she had once said to Arthur Balcombe that she wished with all her heart there were no to morrow Yes, to div) was his, and she was beautiful, and, gazing at the perfection of her fan self, She thought that she did not look more than eighteen ' Do you think I do, child'' she asked of Dionetta "Think you do what, my lad)'" inquired Dionetta. Adelaide laughed-a musical child like laugh which, a man, heating, would have judged to be an expression of june innocent delight She derived pleasure even from this pleasant sound "I was thinking to myself, and I believed I was speaking aloud Day on think took twenty-five >' " But you are not so old, my late " "No-and I don't look it, do I, Dionetta' ' "No, indeed, my lady, not by many years You look j oranges the vi I do ' "And you are not eighteen, Dionotti'' "Not yet, my lady ' It was really to UP, and Adelaide's eyes sparkled as she recognised it She looked younger than her maid, who was in herself a beauty and voting looking Certainly, at the particular moment Dionetta's face was very pale, and there was a frightened look in her eyes, but that would count for very little "If Arthur could see me now ! ' she thought, and sighed happily) at the wish "If suddenly at the glass he should appear, standing in the door way, gaming at mc ' Her white arms were bare, and her dressing gown had fallen from her shoulders What matter' Her arms and neck were b use when she was dr cased But she knew that the presentment of her self, as she sat before the glass, would have been, in his eyes, entirely more attractive than her an penance in evening costume I wonder why it should be so' she thought, and smiled again at herself for the wondering as if she did not know why it should be so' "I would close my eyes and pretend not to see him, and he would not move, for fear of disturbing me But if he Uni happen to take courage, and, thinking I was asleep, steal softly into the room why then there would be this stupid Dionetta screaming out all of a sudden, and there would be nothing but confusion and won by It is a wicked, wicked, shame that we can't do exactly as we like in this world I wish I had the ordering of things " "Dionetta," she said aloud, "I have had a little di cam - "I saw you close your eyes for a moment' my lady " I dreamt I was the most beautiful woman in all the wide world " "You are, my lady " The words were uttered in perfect honesty and simplicity Her mistress was truly the most beautiful woman she had ever seen " Nonsense, child, nonsense' There are others as fair, although I should not fear to stand beside them. It was only a die here, and this but the commencement of it I was the most beautiful woman in the world I am not a poet, and cannot properly describe my self, not a painter, else I would show you myself on canvas I had the handsomest features, the loveliest figure, and a shape that sculptors would have called perfection Then I had the most exquisite dresses that ever were worn, and every thing in that way a woman's client could doune "A happy dream, ray lady. " Wait ' I had a place to live in in a land where it was summer the whole year through Such guidons, Dionetta, and such flow of s as one only sees in dreams I had a pigs enough to cover my fingers a dozen times over , diamonds in pi of vision for my hair, and neck, and arms trunks full of them and of old lace, and of the most wonderful jewels the mind can conceive Would you believe it, child, in spite of all this, I was the most miserable woman in the unit or some " It is hard to believe, my lady ' "Not when I tell you the reason, Dionetta I was absolutely alone. There was not a single person near me, old or young-not one to look at me, to envy mc, to admire me, to love me I What was the use of beauty, diamonds, flowers, dresses The bl lightest eyes, the low chest complexion, the whitest skin-all were thrown away It would have been just as well if I had been dressed in rags, and were old and w wrinkled, like Pierre Lamont Now, what I learn from my di earn is this-that beauty is not worth the having unless it is admired and loved, and unless other people can see it as well as yourself " "Everybody sees that you are beautiful, my lady , it is spoken of everywhere " ' Is it, Dionotta, really now, is it Yes, my lad And you are advan cd and lovett" "I think I am, child, I know I am So that my di earn goes for nothing A foolish of and, was it not, Dionetta' but women are never satisfied I should never be in ed never, never, of hearing the man I love say I love you, I love you You are the most beautiful, the dearest, the sweetest " She leant forward and looked closely at herself in the glass, and then sunk back in her chair and smiled, and half closed her eyes "Dionetta," she said presently, " what makes you so pale '' "It is the Shadow, my lady, that was seen tonight," replied Doretta in a whisper. "I cannot get it out of my mind." "But you did not see it " " No, my lady , but it was there " " You believe in ghosts '" " Yes, my lady " "You would not have the courage to go where one was to be seen ' ' "Not for all the gold in the world, my lady " ' But the other servants are more courage ous " "They may be, but they would not dare to go, they said so to night, all of them " ' They have been speaking of it, then ' ' "O j es, of scarcely anything else They know whose spot it was that appeared " ' Whose was it, child ' ' " The spirit of Master Arthur s mother ' "How do they arrive at this knowledge, Dionetta "Do you not see it yourself, my lady ' It is so very plain For months and months nothing has appeared Grandmother said to night that if you had not come to the villa the belief in the Shadow would have died away altogether " "That is too ridiculous," interrupted Ade 1 aide ' ' What can I have to do with them ' ' "If you had not come," said Dionetta, grandmother said our young master would not be here. It is because he is in the house, sleeping here for the first night for so many many years, that the spirit of his mother appeared to him " But your grandmother has told me she does not believe in the shadows " "My lady, I think she is changing her opinion, else she would never have said what she did It is long since I have seen her so disturbed " Adelaide rose from her chair, the fairest picture of womanhood eyes over gazed upon-a picture an air that would have contemplated with delight She stood still for a few moments, her hand resting on her writing desk "Your grandmother does not like me, Dionetta." "She has not said so, ray lady," said Dionetta, after an awkward pause "Not directly, child," said Adelaide, "and I have no reason to complain of want of respect in her, but one always know saw neither one is really liked or not," Two hours before Gauti ati's unlawful entrance into the Advotatis study there had been a difficulty in getting Pierre Lamont into his bedroom It was situated on the first floor of the villa and as he was unable to advance a step it was in to sary that he should be carried up stairs His own servant, whose duty twas to wheel him about and attend to his wants was on the spot, but into Pierre Lamont's head had entered the whim that he would be called to his room by no other person than Fntz the fool The man w as sent for but could not for a long time be found, and it was quite half an hour before he made his appearance When he did so, all the other guests had left the villa , of those who had come uninvited onlyPietic Lamont remained "Gently, gently), Fntz said the old law j ear, as he was being carried up the stairs, " my bones are buttle "Brittle enough, I should say," rejoined TnU, "chicken bones they might be, from the weight of you As e diamonds heavy, foot' "He! had laughed Fntz, "if I had the selling of you, Master Lamont, I should like to make on the value I should get a rare good price for you at that rate ' In the bedroom Pierre Lamont dismissed his own servant, and retained It is to assist him to under ess the old law or, under eased, was a veritable skeleton, there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his shrivelled bones "What would you have done in the age of giants /' asked Is it", making men by at Pienc Lamont's attenuated appearance "This would have served " replied Pure Lamont, tapping his forehead with his fore finger "I should have contrived so as to lion match for them Bl ing that small table close to the bedside Now place the lamp on it Put your hands in the tail pocket of my coat, you will find a handler duet there ' He tied the handkerchief about it In 11, it was a coloured one, and as the small but in face peeped out of it blown skinned and Char les" it looked like the face of a mummy Fritz gazed at him and laughed immoderately, and Pu are lamont nodded and nodded at the foot, with the a smile of much humour on his face "Einoy yourself, fool, enjoy 3 out self " he said, kindly, ' but don't pass your life in laughter , it is destructive of hi am power Are there any books in the room Look about, Fi ltz, look about " " For books ' exclaimed Fritz " People go to bed to sleep " "I go to bed to think ' reported Pierre Lamont, and lead People are idiots- the) don't know how to use the nights " "People are not fowls There are, books in the 100m " "How shall I pass the night grumbled Pierre Lamont 'Open that drawer, there may be something to lead in it " Intz opened the drawer It was filled with books Pier re Lamont uttered a cry of delight " Bring half a dozen of them quick ' Now I am happy " He opened the books which Fritz handed to him, and placed them by his side on the bed They were in various languages Lavater, Zimmermann a Latin book on demonology, poems of Lope de Vega, IClmgcninnn's tragedies, Italian poems by Zappi, Filicaja, Gas siam and others " You understand all these books, Master Lamont'' "Of course, fool " " What language is this "Latin ' "And this'' " Spanish " And this " Italian No common mind collected these books, Fritz " " The master that's dead father of him who sleeps in the next room " " Ha ha ! inter posed Pierre Lamont, turning over the ranges as he spoke "He sleeps there does he "Yes His father was a great scholar, I've heard " " Avanotts scholar, Fritz, if these books are an epitome of his mind Love, philosophy, gloomy wanderings in dark paths-here we have them all the light and shadow of life Which way runs join taste, fool ' "I love the light of course What use in being a fool if v you don't take ad vantage of your opportunities' " Well said Let us indulge a little These poets are sly lascars The) take unconscionable liberties and play with women's beauty as other men dare not do " Fritz's c) es twinkled " It does not escape even you, Master Lamont " " What does not escape me, fool '" " Woman's beauty, Master Lamont " " Have I not eyes in my head and blood in my veins' asked Ptctto Lamont "It warms me like wine to know that I and the loveliest woman for a hundred miles round are lying under the same roof " Fntz indulged in another fit of laughter, and then exclaimed, " She has caught you too, eli ' Now, who would have thought it Two of the cleveicstlawvirs 111 the world with one or row Beauty is a fine power, Master Lamont almost as good as being a fool ' 1 I sh if he a Lake and think of her, and head love v cases Listen to Zappi, fool To dream of love is almost as good as enjoying it' And in a voice Really tender, Pierre Lamont lead from the book A hundred pretty little Loves in fun Ay ere romping laughing noting one day "A hundred cried Fntz, chuckling and rubbing his hands "A hundred pretty a little boy on Ii Father Capel were hiding under the bed, his face would grow as long as my arm!

Love that found no room while there he flew Tall down into her bosom with delight Who fares the best? he cried or For you? The picture of this withered old lawyer sitting up in bed with a coloured handkerchief for a nightcap tied round his head, reading these languishing verses in a tender voice, and stirring to Lung into his wizen features an expression in harmony with them, Less truly a comical one "5Th), Master Lamont,' said Fritz in ad amration, You were cut out for a gallant Had you recited those lines in the drawing room you would have had all the ladies at your feet supposing," he added with a broad gun " they had all been blind " "Ah me' said Pierre Lamont, throwing aside the book with a mocking sigh "too old too old, I am afraid " " And shrunken,' said Tntz " It is not to be denied, Fritz and she unken " " and ugly ' "You see! daggers into one Yes and sigh) Ah" and with simulated wrath he shook his fist in the air, "if I were but my brother the Advocate, and he were Inch, Fritz eh" Fritz shook his head slowly "If I were not a fool, I should say) I would much rather be as j 011 are-old, and withered, and ugly, and a cripple-than be standing in the place of 5 our brother the Advocate And so would you, Master Lamont, for all your love songs " He 3 [The sole right of publication in Queensland of "The House of White Shadows has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, limited.
