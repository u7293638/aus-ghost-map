LiBTTE&S; TO THE EDIT0E. A GRESFORD GHOST. oik, — I noticed by your issuo of Friday last that your Gresford correspondent says that their quiet littlo village has been startled by an apparition that came with tho advent of the bridge repairers, and since they have gone it has also disappeared, thereby wishing to infer that it was one of the bridge party who assumed the role of the supposed ghost, which if truo would be anything but credit noie, ana no deserving ot tnc severest censure. But I can assure you that tho ghost has no identity with the bridge repairers. I know nothing of his advent to Gresford, but I am sure they have him still with them, He came to the bridge repairers' camp with a sheet on for the purpose of frightening them, and coming from the cemetery I com assure you it had the desired effect, but becoming aware of his identity, on recovering from the shock they were about to make a real ghost of him when he decamped some distance, placcd the sheet on a . stump and fired at it. This is the substance of the ghost story which has causcd us some annoyance by being accused of such foolish pranks, — Yours, etc., . J, FERRY, Junk. East Maitland, 2nd December.
