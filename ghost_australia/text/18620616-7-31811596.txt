TOPICS OF THE DAY. We need scarcely remind our volunteer friends, and riflemen generally, that the Kapunda matches com- <*> mence to-morrow. The mining intelligence from the Peninsula con- ' tinues to be very eatisfactory. The Wallaroo end Moonta Mines are yielding larger quantities of ore than ever. Captain James Wf__ungton, of the Mooata has, to tbe regret of the proprietors, felt it necessary to send in his resignation on account of ill-health. At the New Cornwall Mine the repairs to tbe engine-boiler had been nearly completed, and the engine was expected to get to work again on Friday night or Saturday morning. The lode at the Karills -Cue is tw*niiag out very well, aB also is that at the Matt— The north lode has been cut at the Duryea Mine, but was only penetrated to a very slight depth when the mail left. It was -ridding mundic > and black ore. The proapeete at the Kftrkanlls Mine have improved considerably ; they have cut what is t supposed to be the main lode, and we are informed that, judging by what can now be seen, there will be no difficulty in i-uung 100 tons per month. Wo beer that a project is on foot for recommencing work on the V—lean Mining Company's property, and arith . good prospects of success. The Napoleon Mining Company have recently received some fine specimens of ore from their property north of Port Augusta, and in a day or two we shall probably be in a posi- tion to furnish some further information from this quarter. We have also heard of fresh discoveries in other directions, and expect soon to be in possession of particulars. The proprietors ot the newly discovered silver- lead mine, Cape Jervis, returned on Saturday from a surveying end inspecting trip, but the results of the 1 inspection caunot be known until Mr. Jen—u, the j irjinerttlogietwho?crioiTjpanied the party, prepares his report. We understand that other claimants besides the discoverers are likely to contest the granting of a ?ninsral lease, on the ground of an error of distance from one given point, but the original party feel con fident that their description is su—eiently correct for the identification oi the precise spot where the ore lias been discovered. The present proprietors have surveyed the ground, and forwarded the surrey direct to the Government. The funeral of the late Mrs. Cheethatn, wife of tha Rev. Henry Cheethatn, of Kensington, took place on Friday, 13th instant, at the burial ground attached to the Congregational Chapel in High-street. A con siderable number of persons were present, amongst whom where the Bevs. F. W. Cox, W. Harcus, and John Gardner, the Hon. W. Peacock, Mr. L J. Barclay, Or. Mullcr, Dr. Taylor (Mayor of Kensington and Norwood), Messrs. C. Fisher, — Caterer, W. Hughes, E. B. W. Crlandfield, _<%, all of whom followed in mourning coaches and private carriages. Several persons in connection with Mr. Cheothain'e congregation also attended. The Ber. W. Harcus read selected portions of Scripture, aud engaged in prayer. The Bev. F. W. Cox then read a portion of Scripture, and addressed those assembled in the Chapel in a most solemn and impressive manner, paying a high tribute of respect to the memory of the deceased. The comn was then carried to the grave, where the Bev. John Gardner addressed a few words to the assembly aud engaged in prayer. Much sympathy was shown to the bereaved minister and his family, and many of those present were deeply anected. On Friday, the 13th instant, a very interesting lecture was delivered by F. H. Needham, Esq., 8.N., at the Hindmarsh Institute, on " Becoilectione of tbe Crimean Campaign." Mr. Pickering presided on the occasion. The lecturer f*ommenced with a description of Constantinople, giving a favorable sketch of the Turki. He then followed the fortunes of the fleet through the a-tair at Odessa to the) time of the invasion of the Crimea, describing the advance of the tj*oops t the ——tie of the Al—a, and coatdoding with a brief sketeh of the final operation*, interspersed with cne_B*&e;_tstae a__d_tea.

The at-r-ctious of the field were greatly added to by the band of the West Ada—ado Bifles arhich, during the day, played some most excellent music The College side won the toss and took the eastern side of the field, which gave them the advantage of a fresh breeze, which was blowing in then* favor, when they went in end continned till the finish. The play co—lmenced decidedly in favor of the Col legians, apparently through having the wind in their favor, and eontin—ed going on most satl_tactorily till about half past 3 o'clock, when a dispute arose on accotnit of the ball being kicked through the goal of the Pinks (the Collegians) by tbe Blues (the Towns men), which aras disputed by the Pinks on the ground that they were entitled to a free kit— as tbe ball was behind their goal. After a short discussion this point was conceded by the Blues, and eufc_>wtedged to be no goal; tbe game waa then resumed and kept up tail sunset, arhen ** the araU " was lield, neither party gaining the advantage, being, in tact, a drawn match. With regard to the game of football, if what are aritacesed of the sport on this occasion is a lair specimen are can only say that to qualify for this pastime one ought not only to be swift on toot and strong in limb, bat shoald have the capacity of bearing " punish mtmt," judging from die many and heavy capsizes that took place.

Tbe object of the andertnldag is to provide means of transport at the terminal and totermediate stations along the fine of the ?"?——- Railway and routes of the staau—re on a similar plan to the establishment of Messrs.

The enormous amount of i—-rrjba—idise and produce con veyed apon these lines, for which the existing native in——s of conveyance has been found to be totally inadequate; when it is known that a single line of railway—the Great Indian Peninsula Railway—con veys 750,000 tons annnally along its line, it is snf ficaentiy convincing of the great want of oa organised company tor n-eeting this traffic. The t2hairman and la- rectors of this new cornpony are all Dirr*tors of the aeveral lines of rada- ays in India, with, the exception of Mr. Hadow, arho is Deprily-Chaii-oon of the P. and O. Cornpany.

Mr. Carvnaso is now building those im mediately required, wtaich will be Bent to Calcutta and Madras by the Ck__okee.

Tne general statement cannot be gainsaid, that the more important ma?ventente of the ?—*?—??l forces, in the early stages of the present war, arere made on Sunday, and that they were undeniabie fiulures.
