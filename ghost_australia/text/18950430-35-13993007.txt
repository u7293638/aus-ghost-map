Tho introduction and passing of tho amendment in question moy bo traced to tho mngienl influence of tho calch-phraso " ono mau 0110 '\ oto " upon tho minds of Bomo mon As wo hn\o pomtod out, thoro has boon a failuro to discnminnto botw oon tho application of this principle to Parliamentary oloctions and ita appli- cation to municipnl eleotions Thoro has boon a failuro to distinguish botwoon a slnro council and a Parliament A spenkor m a lato debato propoundod tho doctrino that tho Stato had a porfoct light to do whatever it liked Now, without accepting that doetrmo as sound, it is to bo admitted that Parhn niont, ns ropiesontmg tho Stato, has a very wido rango of action Tho liberties and evon tho lues of tho pooplo aro at loast theoretically within its cognisance ns subjects for legislation That is tho mam reason why Parliamentary oloctions now rest on tho bioadcst popular basis. Tho doarost personal interests being al stako, every man has boon given an equal \ oting powor at tho polls, and equal representa- tion in tho Assembly. But tho Stato, as represented by a shire council, will not havo a perfect light to do whatever it likes, or to pass laws regulating tho lives of the people. The business of the shire councils will bo confined in tho main to tholovjingof latos upon tho ratopayors and tho expenditure of tho money so raisod, together with tho endowment re- ceived from tho Government, in offecting And _aa__Uuuxig material laiprovoraeats within tho shires, for tho oonvonionoo and bonolit of tho ratopayors. Tho mombors of tho Bhiro councils will bo oloclod by tho ratopayors first for tho purpoao of giving tho latter a voico in (lotormining tho amount of tho rate, nnd next for regulat- ing and controlling tho oxpondiluro. Hut sooing that tho councils will bo occupied in dealing -with thoso questions of rates and improvements, and will liavo t litllo to do with personal liberty nnd nothing with tho disposal of life, tho justification of a demand for equal voting power for nil ratopnyors falls to tho ground, and tho claim for some dogroo of in croaso in voting power in proportion to tho liability to bo taxod and tho interest in tho oxpondiluro stands on tho simplo but unshaken foundation of justice Thoro is a cortain analogy botween tho relations of tho shareholders of a joint stock company to tho directors ond thoso of tho ratopayors of a Bhiro towards tho shiro council. It is the function of tho councillors, like that of the (liroctors, to administer the funds at their disposal to the best advantage ; nnd as in a company tho largor shareholders havo a larger numbor of votes in tho oloctiou of direclors than tho smallor shareholders, so tho hoavier contributors to tho muni- cipal funds aro ontitlod to a largor sharo ot influonoo, man for mau, than the smallor contributors. They aro so entitled not only because, whatever tho rato may bo, thoy will bo tho larger con- tributors, but oho bocauso, ns tho larger contributors, thoy will havo tho greater intorost in tho question whether tho rnto sholl bo high or low. "Whon this subject was discussed in tho Assembly on a pre- vious occasion, ono of tho opponents of tho principio of varying voting power said that tho small ratopa}'er had a right to a voico as well as tho largo ono. No ono donies it. But tho converso is ns true, namely, that tho largo ratopayor lins a right to a voico ns well as tho small one, and that principio lies nt (ho basis of tho scliomo proposed in tho bill. As it will gonorally bo found that llio lnrgo ratepayers aro tho fow and the small ratopayors tho many, the voico of tho largo ratepayer can only havo a chance of boiug hoard effectively if ho bo givon moro voles than ono, or, in other words, voting power ia somo dogroo pro- portionate to tho amount of his intorost. The bill docs not propose, and no ono would propose, to corry on tho principle of proportionate increase until tho few lnrgo ratopayors wore enabled to overpower tho many sninll ones. Tho maximum sug- gested is four votes, whatever the Amount of a man's intes abovo n cortain point may ho. But what is tho uso of protend mg to givo tho lnrgo iatopajpi3 a voico if thai unco is to bo diowncd bj tho multi tudinous shouts of 1110111011«, small ones ' It is btsido tho mink to contai 1 that
