Alone With. Conscience. I sat alone with my conscience In a place where time bad ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased ; And I felt that I should have to answer The questions it put to me, And to lace the answer and question 1 Throughout an etemifcv. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; And the vision of aU my past life Was an awful thing to face, Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly-silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning Of a sorrow that was to be mine; In a land that then was the future And now is the present time ; And I thought ot my former thinking, Of the judgment day to be ; But sitting alone with my conscience - Seemed judgment enough for me. » And I wondered if there was a future To thiB land beyond the grave, But no one gave me an answer And no one can come to save ; Then 1 felt that the future was present ^ And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming. And the vision passed away, And 1 knew that the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday ; And I pray that I may not forget it . In this land before the grave, That I may not cry out in the future. And no one come to save. And bo I have learnt a lesson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learnt it dreaming', I hope to forget no more. So I Bit alone with my conscience In the place where the.yeaw inceW; - ; And try to think ol' t&e; future In the land where time will cease ; ' And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone with my conscience . Will be judgment enough for me. ? ? — Spectator.
