? ? IWhbbb are < thosS dead days,; Wtose ghosts loafing -to and fro '' When evening leads us through the maze f Where are they gone f Ah ! who can tell f Who weave once more that long-fassod spell; . ' . They did exist when we were young, We met our life with strength and trust, We deemed all things were pure and. just, Nor knew,life hada double tongue; We lightly sang a happy song, Nor dreamed our way could tfer be "wrong. 'And then all changed; as life went by, The frienddeceived, Or bitter death Smiled as she drank our dear one's breath, And would.not let vs also die. Day. followed day;. as on they went Each took some gift that life had sent. Yet it was ours, that perfect past 1 ' . We did have days that knew not pain. We once had friends death had not ta en, And flowers and songs that could not last Were ours in that most blessed time, When earth seemed Heaven's enohanted dime. ' And so I think, when lights burn low, And all the house is fast asleep, From out a silence vast and deep Those dear dead days we worshipped so, Breathe on us from their hidden, store Their long-lost'peace, their faith once more. God,keep those good old times; ah me! Beyond our virion they may rest TiU on some perfect day and blest Once more those dear dead days will be, For death, who took all, may restore The past we loved, to us once more.
