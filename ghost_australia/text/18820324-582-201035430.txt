And yet it was no't'hL 1 v.'iiya sd, f6r tho ancient forest of SlieHvobd orico i covered all the land around for miles,"'' toheife i Robin. Hood and his merry men- hunted .their prey, and' made havoo with "the king's, deer. The village still boasts its Wags tafia and Hard- staffs j but it is needless to say tho weapon which rendered their unmes famous is out of use. One of the former, indeed, wields the more peaceful drumstick with some skill ; and if the Beardalls were as common in the days of the quarterstaff as they are now, and worthy of their name, the latter weapon must have been brought into fre- quent use. Follp>ving the main road towards Kimborley, I saw the, mansion where the Byrons lived before the one of tliom with tho big beard rocoived New stead from tho stout old robber King Hal. Tho door being open, and hoaring somo one moving about inside, I stepped on to tho threshold and knocked. Prosontly, a slook-faoed maid-servaiit appeared, and cautiously gotting tho door be tween me and tho interior, without giving m'o time to stato my business, told mo 'that "tlie master was in tho fields. Clearly this was an -unfortunate beginning. I asked- in my beat possiblo inaunor if sho knew anything of the Byrons, or of Colonel Hutchinson who had once livocl there. Sho gavo mo a very docided 'No,V and sottlod tlio question sharp ; so I retired.

From this point, woods of beech and olm, and pino overhung the . road, and thon opening out at a considerable elevation, revealed a bsautiful landscape. Newstead lay below in the valley, under the slanting rays of the sun, and the light smoke from its chimneys curled Up lazily among tho woods, oh a background of gray and purple cloud. What grand old giant is this stretching his loiig powerful avinS on each side of the en- trancd'gato, and challenging intruders ? An old- yrul'ld king of iho' forest — the only ono that has escaped the ravages of timo and the axo. When the . fifth Lord Byron , cut down all the timber on, the estate, this oaken, monaroh was bought by somo gentlemen of Mansfield, and after wards presented to the poet.
