THE BIJOU THEATRE. MR. CRESWICK FAREWELL NIGHTS. The dress circle of this theatre was the only portion of it last night in which the attendance was visibly weakened by the heavy downpour of rain which set in just before the doors opened In all other parts of the house Mr Creswick a friends and admirers assembled in great force to witness his last performance but one in Melbourne, and they gave him such a reception when he presented himself aaaSBisted to animate Inn to put forth his best efforts as Hamlet in the three first acts of that tragedy Of the high quality of his performance w s spoke fully when he first played the i are in this city and it is only necessary to add that last night he appeared resolved that the final impres sions to be left upon the minds of a Melbourne audience should be agreeable ones and should be associated with one of the greatest characters in the whole range of the drama Alli e in the scene with the ghost on the platform in his interview with Ophelia where he betrays the consciousness that he is watched in the lay scene and in IUB passionate remonstrance with his conscience stricken mother after the murder of Polonius by misadventure the Hamlet of Mr Creswick delighted an audience which was both liberal and discriminating in its plaudits and called him before the curtain at the end of each act From the members of the company he received a degree of support which was almost uniformly efficient and which appeared to be prompted, on this particular occasion, by a special desire to give due effect to the valedictory appearances of a Shakespearian actor who is almost the last of the famous school to which he belongs Garrick's compressed version of the "Tamar, of the Shrew was given as an afterpiece, with Mr Creswick as Petruchio J and Mrs Lewis as Katherine and the same but will be repeated this evening, when that gentleman takes his farewell benefit. At the close of the performance we under stand it is intended to present him with a service of plate as a souvenir of his visit to Australia as also of the two highly success- ful engagements he has played in this city
