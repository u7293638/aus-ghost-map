poetry. Conscience nn<l Future Judgment. US CIIillLES W. STUUI13. I sat alona with my oonBoicnoe, In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I should have to answer The question it put to me, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Wera alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to faoe,_ Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to bo, But silting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there waB a fnturo To this land beyond the grave ; But no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, Bor it was but the thought of my paetlifo Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I know the far-away warning Had a warning of yesterday'— And I pray I may not forget it In this land beiore the grave, That I may not cry in the future And no ouo come to save. And so 1 have learned a IeEeon Which I ought to have known before, And which, though 1 loomed in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience, In theplnoe whero the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know of tho future judgment, How dreadful soe’er it be, That to sit alone with my oonooience Will be judgment enough forme.
