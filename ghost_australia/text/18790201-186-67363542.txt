Its name was ongmaDy a good Staiptnre RarrKhaR, but had degenoated intoBarMby; its location was among the higji nwantjins of one o£ tie Southern States ; its characteristics wvce dazfcnenand wHdneas. It -W* bra* Having along its narrow length, ami tin. clifis on ad side vas high and straight; you could ascend them by searching for loot-bolds anddxavingTonradf op by the trees, bat you could not nm op, or indeed cumb op, with the least grace, for it was a matter of tine, and yon must go, as it were, altitough erect, on all fonts, using both hands and feet. Below, there was just room enough for the brook and the roadway, with hardly a yard to spare ; the clifis wee lit* walls, shadowed nidi homing trees, and made the day dait even at the noontide. How the brook em caught any sunshine down there in that deep green trench was a mystery ; hot it did. Josepha bad seen it catching and reflecting beams much more gajiy than the river that ran through the brad open meadow ouiade. Once she said to her mother that she thought it was like a woman who could love bat once, whereas the river in the meadow was like a fair, lovely heart that is sweet to every body, the Bnn«h'MS the winds, the bees, and the clover scents, and to all alike. 'Nobody loves any body of coarse, but their hnsbandB,' replied Mrs. Kay. 'I can not imagine who* you get yoar fancies.' 'Norl, mother,' said Josepha. Bnt Mrs. Kay was not JosepWs mother, only her step-mother; aiair- hairedlittifi woman whom Joseph Kay had married, with that sort of nnconsctons fatnxty which comes, as a kind of eqnaliration pwifjpgj after middle life to almost all much-admired men ; bettering that all TComen are {''fug for t^****', they fall an easy prey to the first infantile-faced person who has no object in seenringthem. Josepha's own mother had died when her little daughter vats but two mnnfliF old, and the girl had spent her life with an a -a™*, a**A at the boarding-schools of an austere kind, until, at her father's sadden death, she vas called home to Hope Cottage to take care of the stall fair- haired bnt faded little step-mother. It bad been no home to her; bet it was a. pretty place, and she looked around the hanriotxs rooms and the rose garden with slow surprise. She had not realized that life could be made so plexsaai, for her aaat was an iron nerved woman, and in her house lamps were not shaded for the eyes, nor chairs fitted to thy frqafir nor rooms ****^«* beautiful for mere beanty 'b sake. Bat for the mind there had always been every alimwit. Thus Josepha had become what she was — a quiet girl with a. large store of book-knowledge, and a large ignorance of ft-0 th»t. exmtftjfrtt*-A her step mother's ideas of living and of life. 'It is not that she is disagreeable at aH,' mi-l Mrs. Kay, sitting tip in her heavy crape to receive a visit from Mrs. Verdyne, her rich neaghbonr, 'bat so different, so nn^!iyinpat1if4ic ; and I, as you very harnL Mrs. Verdyne thought it was, and made one or two beautiful remarks. She then took her departure, having fnlfiHed all the Antie* of the occasion : let it be understood that Hra. Verdyne always fulfilled all her duties to a T. The whole of the widow's visiting list, very well-bred people all of them, fnlnued their duties likewise ; they wrote notes of I condolence, to which Josepha was obliged to ) reply, copying from her step- mother's ; -iict3iioiL. : 'I do not see the necessity for this,' ehe ,, fortieth sheet. ' * ° j *' A^1 1 life is not atl npppniL.ii y ^ child.1' sighed i the widow from her sofa. !j Bat it tamed oat that there was a good ' Seal of necessity m it, after all, for Joseph Kays affairs were found to be mrolned, and his j widow was left with less than nothing. This j last phrase was repeated more than once by ? the lawyers engaged, and by those lookers-on trho always gather imctaoaaly around a broken fortune like birds around a wreck. 'I do not know what you mean by less than nothing, ** said Josepha at last. 'She has me, and I am something, I hope.' ' 'We hope so too, 'said the lawyers. 'But young i*Aia nowadays — *° 'I have found out since I bare been here,' said the girl, bluntly, *' that I do not belong to 'nowadays1 at alL Mother herself has told me so. It is just as well, as things have happened. Pay the debts, and give us what you can, Mr. Brown. I shall take mother away.' ''What are you going to do. Miss Kay T 'Teach, of coarse. Thai is the only thing I con do.' And so it happened that as friends fell away from the wreck, as they always do, Josepha set oat alone m her little row-boat, with her step- motaer in the stern, on the long voyage of Me. The austere aunt gave them a little, bat she herself was not rich, and so fixed in her ways, besides, that it would have cost her I great pain to diminish her various contribu tions to the missionary societies and educational insertions in which she had long been interested. Josepha and her mother drifted from one place to aaother, poor and poorer as time wore on, until at last the girl was glad to obtain this postum of x&isteesB; is a school *mr-ng the Southern mountains, in one of those settled regions in the midst of wfldness which the traveler comes upon with emprise. These little aeighbooriioods are fringings around springs whose waters have attracted visitors for generations. Two years had passed since her father's death, and Josepha had seen sometiiing of the dark side of life ; but she had a calm, prosaic carnage and a thorough way of working hard which did not leave much tame for borrowing trouble — an aTiriwtwnt belonging generally to doleful idleness. They started on their journey, and in due time arrrived at a small village a half way station between the Springs and the railroad, where the stage etopped, and where there was a imnrrtr*' inn. Here Mrs. Kay, grown resigned to her nuth, bat quick as a cat to take the advantage of whatever of pleasure appeared, wished to remain. ' We coold not see 4he stage go byererj day, and ppt4iapa ^wm^tniw^ the passengers would take tea here,' she said, hopefully. 'lam eocry, mother, bat we can not do that; itistoonu- from the echool. t mast toy to find a little home for as that will be 'Of course, since / wish it, we can not do it ; it is always bo,' said Mrs. Kay, dissolv ing not into tears exactly, but into a certain JampMCT of tone and visage. 'And I think I could stand it better, Josepha, if yon would not passt in calling me 'mother' in that bosmesa-like way. If I had a daughter of my own, I am sure she would have called ** I think it very probable ; bat as I have been brought op diffisrenfly, won't you try to overlook my defioenrifs, mother ?

'But I do my best with you, and the spirit of my Glinted Joseph can view us witii satisfaction, I am sons, ineveryre* spect Bare our worldly surroundings, which, however, are teash to the spirits, I suppose,** she added, with a sigh. ?' I hope father's spirit ha something better to do,' said the gid.

'Oh, wt^tiiOT is not mnch to understand.' answered the girl, with a weary littfe laugh. She vas very contemptuous toward herself at iroiiaa fof she thought she ought long before tins to have aecompushed1 snrnpflinig in the world, whereas all she had done so faramwinted merely to *'*»p«»g tile wolf a few steps bom the door. bus. Eay^ ccape was all worn uul now £ her weeds were node of baxe^e. She never failed to be distressed about this every time die left ihe house, lest she should meet some of her old visiting fist, who most hare been endowed with *** *IJ j**™ utary powers of moving about to have been in all the places where she looted for them. Josepha had begun by «»Tpl%fnipg ttiai: they crwM not possibly be here nor there; bat, after a while, she had perceived that even the distress was pleasant to her step-mother, as a relief from the monotony of the life she led, *' exciting possibility turkins anjund evexr corner ana coming oat of every boose door. Every carriage might contain, every person approach ing might he — who knows? — somebody she had known. A thousand tunes had she rehearsed in her mind her opening «-witfiwyg, with the sighs already at the proper places, and was affected even to tears by the little scenes she conjured ap, apropos of a back like somebody'*, or a Roman nose that bad associations. They found a little brown house and settled themselves in it with their few belongings; it stood at the edge of Baznaby Pass. The school was on the opposite «de of the small valley, half a mfle away ; and four times a day tfae young mistx-esB took, the eteugbt walk between the com fields and over the bridge, following a little path bordered wfth Michael mas daisies thafr ran alongside of the dusty road. Bat nothing passed save the winds and *Hn». bees, aid, to-night, thp cows, walking solemnly and far apart, each in her own golden dond, and tftinlrmg; no doubt, *3»t aS the world was dust. Mrs. Kay arranged the boose ; then she re-atxanged it. Then she began anew, and she u-raBged it all ©rer again. It grew- to be quite a -common thing for the danfdifar; coming home, to see aD the chairs and tables Out on t^*** J**vm 'I am glad yoa are interested,' she said. ' Interested !' said Mrs. Kay, throwing up 1 her bands — ' interested 1 But tiiaf. only shows how Uttie you know me.

IThey had come in ihe late winter ; it was now spring. Josepba tanght almost contin i noosly, not only in school hoars, but oat ; for ! she had eveai&g; scholars at home, and on Saturdays a dozen tesaons. The only time she kept {or henjelf was from five in the afh»rn*wrn ontildark, and Sundays, when she hid «H the -i*y. In the afternoon she walked. After a time, tired of the meadow, she wandered into the Bme. It was in April; she never fotgot the day. Kot ttiat anything happened ; xt least only «o email a aiatter as an awakening on her part to what had been in the world always from tbe beginning, although -fcf had not had eyes to see it. As progress, a langnajse will all at once burst upon thestademv and suddenly h. knowaitaB, so now, as suddenly, this girl was taken all at once into tile order of Katuce-loven, leaving forever the great majority who have eyes am see not, ears and hear not, and hearts into which it has never entered even to oraave the beauty of Gaffs earth. There had been a shower the night beEon, and the cool Pass had kept the mmfare ; the earth of the road way was elastic and dark, and exhaled a peculiar freshness, tbe aroma of Hie contented soil. The low bushes along the brook went covered with* light green lace-work of small buds, some opening into little leaves, others ended, others rfflf bnt ftnzy down ,- ai the cliff-side werecmstena! tbe ferns in troops, in regiments, all kinds, bom the delicate Venus-hair to the bold evergreen with epear Doinfced tips, which took care of her. Than Kaanthe bees, growing in ranks one above tbe other, and Josepha, walking along and looking up, saw their green tops swelling out, roiTx&rW;, nntflthe last btnsbed the eky. He atrip of Wne at the top was narrow. The rad eauU see it for some distance, as the hass was almost straight for nearly a mile. Indeed, with all its length and windings, one came out of it at last almost dicectiy opposite this entrance, eight miles back as the bird Sies. The bro* flowed along with the rushing sound one hears in dreams when bonmibyfeverina hot city. It seemed to laugh, and the sunset light came down to it as magically as Smhad flew down into the valley ofouamonds. Birds were emging their spring songs here and there, each, no doubt, with a demure littie auditor near, and unmindful of tbe rest of the Pass, which, nevertheless, |iri»n»d, It was a wonderful bird auditorium, for there was no hum, no whir and rarill msect lAnmiinfo as as in the meadow outside, the little load voiced, sun loving creatures rarely venturing into the shadows of the Bass. There was no jar of passing wheels, no lowing of cows, only the low rush of the brook, like bough trilled forth such a rapturous shower of notes that Josepha, listening, said to herself, -I have never beard a bod sing before.'* With her senses filled with new delights, the leaf-bud tracery before hereyes, the touch of the woolly fern crosiers on her hands, the fresh odors of the brown ground inhaled with her breath, and the bird songB and rush of Ok brook in her eus, at last she turned homeward. 'To-day is an era in oar life here, mother,' she said, as she took her seat at file tea table. The stage has then begun to cosne Hois way?' said Mis. Kay, putting down her cup excitedly. ' Ko ; I believe cot.' 'YThat, then, yon disappointing girir* 'I have made me acqnamtauce of— ** 'Some one staying at theSpringsT ' No mother : of Nature.' Mrs. Kay threw herself back in her chair and tapped her foot on the floor impatiently. ' I shall never become used to your ways, Josepha,' she said. ' You do tzy me dread fully sometimes.

'A kinder spirit, mother, and more «fiorte to make you happy.' 'I do not Bee what the Pas has to do with that, Josepha; and as to efforts, they are not in your line atalL Ton can go steadily on in your monotonous way, doing the same tiling day after day ; but as to snorts, real true efforts, I am the person who makes them in this family. Efforts require nerve, inspira. tion. Look at thut divan '' The divan was a dry-goods box covered with chintz, [u spite of hay, it had a most ms-OrieBiaQp hara appearance, and being without back, engendered discomfort and whitewash for the unweary occupant. Josepha looked at it, and decided that she could never be a Turk ; but the new influence of the Pass made her say, after a moment, that the chintz was pretty, whereat the person of efforts condescended to be pleased. The chintz was pretty : Mis. Kay had understood colours in her day. It was tills wngnlir mixture of things which she did and did not understand that made her mind like an old curiosity shop, where, amid much rubbish, occasionally something of value is found. After that day Josepha went into the Pass every afternoon. She learned to fee) that delicate yet deep enjoyment which Nature gives to those who love her, something which can hardly he described or expressed, but whose intensity is nearer the soul than the influence oE any poem or pbilosoby ever written on the book's page. It is true that there are many persons, otherwise exquisitely endowed, who can not appreciate this enjoy ment, as there are persons also who can not appreciate music. But tiiis taciturn girl was of a different nature, and she had at bat come to her own. Her favourite seat was on a high crag where the sunlight feU on her head; there she sat and took in aD the perfume and uncmiingof the spring, and listened to tbe growing. One day in July tbe stage did come through the Pssb; Josephs, on her crag, heard it ntamg by below, and was angered. She did not want the world there. However, the world did not come. Day after day Mrs. Kay, who bad watched carefully bum her little piazza, reported, 'not a passenger ;' day after day her small tableau of heradf, her work-basket, and her white cat i»™.;~J unnoticed save by a small driver in a lacge napping hat, who did not seem at aO impressed by it 'I can understand it,' she said. 'I thought a gnat many persons visited these Springs; I am sure I have heard of them all my life. Sot as one hears of Saratoga, of coon^l^stffl as something outefaiWouable m its way. like camping out m the Adiran daebs. or going to titose queer littie places at the mouth ofttie St. Lawrence.' after a 'wiillc JoBcnha lyim If met tbe stage, and, in spite of berjealffuey, could not bear sneer hnTagaiBst the intruder, it was sueb a forlorn old vehicle. It bad no curtains over its windows, no shining georgeous paint; its wheels were dingy, its imgE inausted with ancient mud; the rack behufl looked M though it had never beU a bunk, so shriveled and lean wen: its ancient leather coverings. Four thin hones drew tins old ghost, and their countenances showed that although, according to law, they were having an easy time, they knew better; tbe merry voices of nine inside and six en tap would have cbeered them, and they ware -J™~J in a homely way, of the dingy vehicle behind them, and the fact that there were never any passengers eare mauMiags. They hid known better days. Tbe driver had stopped to water ins team. Jowpha, coming down from her crag, paused on a ledge above him, and bowedsUghtly, according to He custom of the country, where all passers-by salute each other. He nodded in return, and climbed down on to the wheel ; under Iris flapping hat she saw his email brown face and lantern laws. ' What stage is tins V she asked. 'The Greenoway express, mum.' 'But it does not go so far as Greenoway, does it r 'Ko, mum— it don't.' 'Ton have nut many passengers, ' she observed, when the littie man had raffled « his pail and tte second horse waa drinking.

'Well, they pray some; and they eat.' ' J*o, mu*a,'bega|uig vour pardon,' said the driver, emphatically, standing on tiptoe to check up his noises' heads, which seemed, however, no higher of ihe operation than before. 'Camp-meetingB belong to my own Church, if you pteassTwhich Isthe Methodfe', and bat nothmgin amman with Tunkfira.'* ^ Be then climbeSup to his seat and untwisted the £ei&s.; 'I hiayou good-day, mum.' be said; and Hie old stage started off with A groaning sna raffling tit every joint. That evening, when Christian Convene came for his lesson, lbs. Kay asked if the stage that pasaed every afternoon was the stage to theSprings. ??You do not Sink that old top was the Crystal stage, did you, ma'am r eaid Chris tian, who, wittt red hair, bars feet, and a speDing- book, was yet desperately in love, in a bashful, awkward way, with tbe school mistress. 'That ait's the old express tint carries the mail through the mountains west of here. The Crystal coach goes the other way to tbe Springs, and a utanner she is, too.' 'Then it never comes by here?' 'No. ma'am ; all the Springs' coacbea go byoutiie-iauiesdeoftbe~rxver- ' Now, Converse, begin your lesson,' said Josepha. She called tile large boys by their but names, and had thereby won, thongh all unconsaousiy, their deepest anections. ' We must certainly move over across tba river, Josepha,'' said Mr*. Kay. Every afternoon now in the Pass tin: school mistress saw tht old stage, or heard itcattiing by below over the rocky road, while she sat on her high crag. She did not come down again to talk to the driver, butabe feU into the habit of waiting for it to go by before she started homeward, using it as a forest dock. After a week or eo the camping people began to appear, coming over the bridge and up toe road Vtween the com fields toward the Pass in wagons, in old gigs, and on horseback— plain sober folk, upon whose iaoes reigned a subdued excitement ; tor this assembling of themselves together in the greenwood tobold converse and to rouse religious favor waa the one festival of their lives. They wens not 'Tunkers.' as the driver had called them, bnt a kindred sect of German origin, Separatists from the Lutheran creed. All the year round tiiey toiled on their small farms, men, women, and children, like patient beasts of burden, with hardly a thought above the ground they tilled, and the~puciples of cheirfaitli aught have been euninumea on in the words industry and economy.
