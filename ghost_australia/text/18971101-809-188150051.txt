OTHs, EVENTS. A start "was i e at 1 o'clock with the Alaiden Plate, i which eight saddled up. Clarion on pape oked to have the race at his mercy, lie li; ig run second to Amber ite in tlie A.J.C :rby, and that colt's sub- sequent form ji: id that there was merit in the performs . Besides, his work on tho track was o; ch a good character that some of tlie wai re had been led to view his Cup chance 1 favor. So heavily was he befriended til it the rise of the barrier the ring were to ; 11 to 8. Amnesty was well backed, tb pinion ' that J. Wilson would hardly have paid . up for her for the Alelbourne Cup if she were a moderate being a sound one. The two practically monopolised the mar ket. Clarion was kept ' very much ' in the rear for the greater part of the jour ney; but when young Cook called upon him he made hacks of his pursuers. For the public this was an auspicious start. Amnesty, who is 'by Trenton— Pardon, and therefore sister to Pigeontoe, Rosella and Lady Bettj', failed at the end, but for seven furlongs she showed plenty of pace. Clare, the dam of Clarion, was bred in 18S7, by Richmond from Lady Wilton, and at the break up of the Lerderderg stud she and a colt foal by Carbine, and served by liini again, were sold to Air. James Alonaghan, of Sydney, for 050 guineas/Clarion is in the Alelbourne Cup at li st. 8 lb., aud is otherwise well en gaged. , ihe Alelbourne Stakes, because it was ex pected to throw light upon the probabilities of the Alelbourne Cup, attracted consider able attention. An even dozen cried con tent, and of these only three — Auraria, Key and Bloodshot — are missing from the Alel bourne Cup list. Delaware, despite the ex cellent public trial he did at Alaribyrnong during the week, was ousted from the posi tion of favoritism by Coil, and others who carried a lot of money were Positano and Wait-a-Bit. Delaware was ridden the race he likes best — in front; but when the light commenced he was soon beaten. Coil seemed to have the race in hand after lie had settled Wait-a-Bit, and Delaney, apparently taking matters a little leisurely, was sur prised to be called on to meet a desperate challenge in the lust few strides by Battalion, who snatched the prize on the post. It was bad luck for the public, as Coil should have won. Battalion was not backed by the stable, although he has done- a splendid Cup preparation. He is engaged to-morrow at 9 st. 4 lb., 5 lb. more than he carried in the Alelbourne Stakes, and he will probably be ridden by his trainer, J. E. Brewer. Battalion came from Sydney with Coil, but was stopped for some days at Albury be cause of the tick regulations with regard to Queensland horses. No doubt Payten is sorry now be made persistent endeavors to have the regulations relaxed, so that the horse might resume the journey. Battalion is a great performer in Queensland and Sydney, and lias a chance in the Alelbourne Cup. Positano, who was gene rally admired for his fine racehorse up- pcarance, looked, like The Alerry Boy, in want of a little more work. Positano rail with great gamcness1 in the straight, and gave no sign of those eccentric- pranks which have got him sfich a peculiar reputa tion. Key ran a good mare, and Wait-a-Bit's display gave his friends no reason for mis givings with regard to liis chance in the Cup. Poor Auraria is now a mere ghost of her former brilliant self, and True Blue and Toreador would seem to have small chances to-morrow. An interval of 65 minutes gave ample time for luncheon, after which tne Hotliam Handicap, one mile and a half, demanded attention. Aletford, a stable companion of Coil's, was picked out as having the best chunce after his forward running in the Caulfield -Cup, apd he left tho paddock favorite. The recently arrived Sydney horse, Surge, was in strong request, aud tlie tjaulus and Alischief stables risked a Cup penalty. ' The favorite was always up with the leaders, and he drew away easily when called upon, his victory partly com pensating for Coil's downfall. Surge had bad luck to run up against such a good thing as Aletford proved to bo, but the Gib raltar gelding will probably soon repay his purchase money and Saturday's losses. Bac chus ran a satisfactory race, but Alischief's display lacked the brilliancy which a Alel bourne Cup candidate should boast. Gaulus only ran fairly well, but he should do better on Tuesday. The enforced withdrawal of Symmetry, who met with an accident on the way to the course, cutting her near fetlock joint, robbed the Alaribyrnong Plate of much interest. Standish, a brother to Redeourt, who had never pre viously started, was installed favorite, Ormuz, who bore Air. W. It. Wilson's colore, being next in demand, and the Syd ney people were sweet on the chances of Essex and Vigorous. Lady Mostyn was ab solutely discarded, her form in the St. Al bans Handicap at Aloonce Valley on tlie previous Saturday having been compara tively so poor; but she gave tlie ringmen a delightful surprise by winning easily and beating her two Sydney rivals. How she could be backed on her form at Aloonee Val ley is a mystery. She ran a most erratic course on Saturday, finishing right under the judge's nose. Lady Alostyn is a bay filly, bred in South Australia, by Neekeregat —Aliss Alostyn (imp.) (dam of" tho brilliant Alostyn), by Uncaa (son of Nightingale), Jier .dam, Lady .Alostjm, by Lord Clifden from Annette, by Scythian (imp.) from Alice Caracal, by imported Sarpedon, by Emilius from Rowena, by Sumter. She was bred by the late Sir Thomas Elder at Atorphettville, South Australia, and was sold as a yearling at Newmarket for 200 guineas. She is engaged in tlie A.J.C. De cember Stakes, the Champagne Stakes, St. Lcger Stakes, the V.R.C. Oaks, &c.; Ormuz ran' fairly well, and so did Stoiidish; but Aloss Rose's brother, Roscommon, was a failure. The last race on the card was the Coburg Stakes, and the Sydney people, who had had a splendid day, declared it to be tho best thing of the meeting for The Grafter, js short a a®2 to 1 being taken in a field of 22. The Grafter won easily after having a forward position throughout. Fitz- roy, who was the subject, of a big commis- sion, had the bad luck to run up against another Paid Pry. The Grafter is in the Melbourne Cup at 7 st. 7 lb. (including 7 lb. penalty). , The following is a detailed description of the general racing: — MAIDEN PLATE, of 5 sore., with 200 added; second, oO sovs. out of the stake. For 3-year«olds and upwards.

Amnesty, after playing up for a time, jumped away in front of Koha and Snapshot. The latter, however, went out and led the field along the back. At the abattoirs, Snapshot mid Titheradgc were racing together; Amnesty and Pinfire coming next, and the favorite lying last. Erl Queen swept round the turn in advance, .of the rest, but tho entrance to the straight was made by -Snapshot from Am ncsty and Lrl Queen. Clarion lay behind the lat ter two in a good position at the distance. Then Look called on him, and the colt, responding well, shot past the field and won in a canter by half a dozen lengths from Koha, who just managed to beat Pinfire off by a head. The fourth home was Alva, then Amnesty, Snapshot and Erl Queen last Time, 1 min. 40 sec.

Wait-a-Bit was first under the barrier, with .Key, Delaware and Battalion following, the last to move being Positano. At the river sid Delaware ran out, and, held the lead to tho bridge from Wait-a-Bit and Key, Toreador now being last. The favorite began to move at the back, but fell away again at the abattoirs, where Delaware hold Wait-a-Bit in hand two lengths in front of Kev. p.wOujliut inhuC u MrWaru iiiuVc at the aiiwua, .Ulii leaving the turn behind Wait-a-Bit moved into the lead from Delaware, Key, Coil, Positano, the latter being- on the outride in front of Battalion, who was now marking out a running course. Wait-a- Bit entered the straight in front of Delaware and Coil, and the positions were maintained to the dis tance, where Positano was beaten by Battalion on the outside, and the latter coming fast upset an ticipatory shouts by landing a winner a head in front of tin favorite, behind whom Key lay just a neck distant. Wait-a-Bit was fourth. Toreador, Delaware, Merry Boy, True Blue, Fucile, Blood shot and Positano next in order, with Auraria last. Time, 2 min. 0) sec.

The favorite was quickest to anticipate the rising of the gate, Pluviu6 II. and Devon being on his heels. Gaulus negotiated the turn behind Plu vius II. and Devon. The last two led at the river side from Mischief, Luster, Surge and Bacchus, Canoona being last. Mischief cut out the running along the back in company with Surge; then came thefavorite, Pluvius 11. aud Devon closely bunched. At the sheds Surge assumed the lead, and retained it up to the diriance. Mischief, Metford, Surge, Gnulus and Devon being nearest of the field over that length. But at the half distance Metford began to creep up, and coming with a dash not far from home, won by two lengths from Surge, who in turn beat Gaulus and Canoona, who were neck and neck, by half a length. The next was Bacchus, then Mischief, Straightfirc, Devon and Pluvius II., the last being Catspaw. Time, 2 min. 38$ sec.

Vigorous, Ormuz, Moonshee, Hainault and Stjndieh left the mark in compuny, and at the half-mile Ranfurly and Cardamon joined the bunch, which suffered a de fection in Moonshee, who dropped to the rear. Lady Mostyn took shelter under the far rails, and was lost to the view of most of the onlookers until the concluding' stages. At the course proper Vigo rous wns at the head of affairs, followed closely bv Ranfurly, Ormuz and Essex. The favorite droppe'd back badly at this stage, and Essex, feeling his legs, came with a rush into third place at the dis tance. Vigorous still plugged on in front, and passed the half distance post in front of Essex. Cardamon and Ormuz; hut here Lady Mostvn raced forward and won easily by three lengths from Vigorous and Essex, a dead heat; with Cardamon, a neck away, fourth.
