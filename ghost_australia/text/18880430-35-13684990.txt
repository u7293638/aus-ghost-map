GAIETY THEATRE. At the Gaiety Theatre on Saturday night "Hamlet" was produced to an audience that completely filled all the lower parts of the auditorium, and made a respectable show in the dress circle. The tragedy has been so often produced in this city by Mr. Dampier, and his impersonation of the name part is so well and favourably known that it was taken as a matter of course that there would be a good attendance, and the result quite fulfilled expectation, while those who attended seemed fully satisfied with their entertainment Mr. Dampier was again the Prince, and throughout the performance he gave a most interesting and instructive impersonation of the great bard's wonderful creation, while the " set speeches" were spoken by him in a manner that must have been the envy of all aspiring amateurs. Miss Katherine Russell was Ophelia, and her rendering of the port was most favourably received.] On the whole the support was good, though some of the characters were rather feebly represented. Mr. Stoneham was the King without dignity, Mr. J. D. Marsh Polonius, Mr. A. Boothman Laertes, Mr. W. Wynn Horatio, Mr. H. Leston the first grave digger, Mr E. Holloway the Ghost, and Miss Julia Morton the Queen. To-night, Macbeth is to be produced. On Thursday Mr. Dampier will take a farewell benefit, and the piece to be presented on the occasion will be The Merchant of Venice. On Friday, which will be the last appearance of the company in Sydney for some time, a complimentary benefit will be given to Mr. Dampier by a number of amateurs, and a most interesting bill has been prepared for the occasion.
