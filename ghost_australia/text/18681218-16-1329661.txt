THE LATE SIR JOHN DEAN PAUL. DEath "was carried off a once notorious character, the late banker of the Strand, Sir J D Paul, who, having lived for some years in retirement, died a few days since at St Alban's, having nearly completed his 68th year. The eldest son of Sir J D. Paul, the first baronet of that name, he was born in October, 1862, and succeeded to his father's title in 1892 ; his connexion with the unfortunate and fraudulent banking house of Messrs Strahan, Paul, Bates, and Co his criminal conviction at the Old Bailey for making away with his customers' securities, and his consequent punishment, will be fresh in the memory of most of our readers The late baronet, who had once served the office of High Sheriff of a southern county, was three times married- first to one of the Beau clerks, of St Leonard's, Sussex , secondly, to a Miss Ewens, of Brighton, and, lastly, to a blue Bugden, who survives him He issue needed in his title by his only son, now Sir Aubrey John Paul third baronet, who is married to a daughter of Sir John Lister Rev The old seat of the Paul, Rodborough Manor, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, was purchased some twenty years ago from that family by Earl Russell, on account of its proximity to the borough which he had formerly represented in Parliament Thoughts of many other men who, long before their last breath was drawn, had died out of the world which knew them, are awakened by the brief announcement recording the decease of Sir John Dean Paul I fourteen years have passed since that memorable afternoon when the shutters were put up for the last time at the great banking establishment of Strahan, Paul, and Bates Few commercial catastrophes of modern times have of cared anything like the consternation caused by that bankruptcy Banks have failed for larger amounts, both before and since, but probably there never yet was a failure which carried rum into circles so far removed from the ordinary vicissitudes of commerce The fashionable world, the aristocratical, the religious, all had their money lodged in the old established house, which had acquired a reputation such as did not belong to ordinary banks Peers, dowagers, dignitaries of the Church, and religious societies formed the distinguished constituency of Sir John Dean Paul, Bart To have an account in his bank was a test of genteel respectability-was a proof, to quote Thackeray's dictum, that your name was recorded in the peerage as well as in the Book of Life Not only was the character of the establishment itself deemed beyond suspicion, but St John's personal repute afforded an additional guarantee for its solvency He was the chairman of benevolent societies, the treasurer of religious organisations, the friend, patron, and counsellor of half the clergy- men in the metropolis So when the bank of the nobles and the divines failed, great was the fall indeed Widows were left destitute, orphans were thrown helpless on the world, charitable societies were bereft of their funds Great, too, was the consternation when it was found that the customers of the establishment had not only been exposed to the ordinary perils to which depositors are liable, but that there had been some tampering with the securities entrusted to the firm Not unreasonably, the indignation of the defrauded public was increased by the high pretensions which then defenders had made to superior piety and virtue, and when a a mural prosecution was instituted against the bankrupts, the verdict of society had already condemned them It was a curious kind of Nemesis, that the one creditor who proved obdurate to their appeals for mercy, who declined all idea of compromise, and who in sisted in placing the oil riders in the dock, should have been a magnate of the clerical world-of that very world which it had been the special care of the firm to conciliate and attract The details of the great trial of Strahan, Paul, and Bates can hardly be forgotten It was proved, by the admission of the prisoners, that, without his sanction or knowledge, they had negotiated securities entrusted to their care by Dr Griffith Strong prima facie reason was adduced to show that all the members of the firm must have been cognisant of the fraud, and we believe that the opinion of all competent legal authorities has confirmed the view, that the attempt of the partners to avoid the responsibility of their acts by a voluntary confession before the Court of Bankruptcy, was not tenable in law or equity Yet, now that the excitement of the hour has passed away, we can see that more excuse might be made for the unhappy men who had perpetrated these frauds than society was disposed to admit at the time Their failure was not due to culpable personal extravagance, but to embanaEB ments of long standing, dating from times far beyond the period of their own entrance into the business. It is certain that when they raised money on the securities entrusted to their care they did so in order to tide over temporary difficulties, and under the conviction that they should be able to re- place the abstracted property at a not far distant day We are not saying that all this constituted any moral, still less any legal, justification for the conduct of those fraudulent trustees, but, in some respects, it may mitigate the severity of the judgment which we might otherwise pass upon their crime The jury would have fallen short of their duty if they had not convicted Sir John Dean Paul and his partners of the offence charged against them and yet, on the other hand, it may be thought that it was possible to temper justice somewhat with mercy Considering the peculiar temptations to which the prisoners had been exposed, the sacrifices which they had personally made to bolster up the credit of the concern, and the technical difficulties which were encountered in the framing of the indictment the sentence pronounced was cruelly severe Four teen years' transportation was the punishment inflicted by Baron Alderson on these men, all of them advanced in years, all men of education and culture, and all accustomed to the enjoy- ment of wealth and Station Public opinion, which always in the long run inclines to mercy felt, when the excitement of the moment was over, that the sentence had been strained to the side of seventy One of the partners died in penal servitude shortly after the commence ment of the punishment, the other two received tickets of leave after some five or six years of their term had expired and the remission of their penalty was generally held to have been justified by the circumstances of the case Many of Sir John | Paul's old friends and associates believed in his innocence to the end at all events, they believed that his errors had not been the result of deliberate dishonesty If so, the incident of his death at this hour may serve as an eloquent moment to a numerous class who have recently been contending with similar temptations men of the best connections of good intentions, of considerable and undoubted intelligence, who have, in the arguments offered by a fluctuating yet inviting commerce too often hesitated to draw the line" between strict integrity and a culpable hazard at the cost of others to such the memory of the convict baronet may speak like a ghost in Dante But even the severest censors of public manners will not be sorry to think that for the last half dozen years of his life the sometime philanthropist, ex bunker, and released convict, lived peaceably in obscurity If he sinned grievously he also suffered cruelly , those who can now read that stern lesson most profitably amid the errors of the living, will also look back with the most charitable thought for the dead, and even those whom he most wronged may learn with satisfaction that he died neither friendless nor in gaol - Daily Telegraph states Mr Thomas Powrie, the actor, whose render- ing of the character of " Bob Boy" is well known to both English and Scotch playgoers, died lately, in Edinburgh, from an attack of British cholera The foundation stone of Her Majesty's Theatre was lately exhumed In a cavity in the bed of the stone were found a guinea, date 1788, half-guinea, dote 1789, a shilling, date 1787 , a sixpence, dated 1787, a fourpenny piece, date 1786, a threepenny piece, date 1772, a two penny-piece, date 1736, and a silver penny piece, date 1786.
