SELECTED POETRY. AT NIGHT. The moon hangs in a silver mist ; The stars are dull ana thin ; Sleep, bending low, spreads loving arms To fold the whole world in ; The air is like a spell; the hills Waver, now seen, now lost-; The pallia river wanders by, A vast unquiet ghost. A home'd owl cn silent wings Fron: out a cavernous space Speeds, like a boh of darkness hurled Athwart the shimmering space, Above the vale from wood to wood, And leaves no trace behind, Like some dark fancy, flung across A pure and peaceful mind. marr.ice Thompson.
