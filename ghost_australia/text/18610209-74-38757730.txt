REVIEW. Tue DocTrnlE OF BArPTIoos, reduced from its ancient and modern corruptions, and restored to its primitive soundness and integrity according to the word of truth, the substance of faith, and the nature of Christ's kingdom. Pp 30. Tns is a remarkable pamphlet. Two hundred years have elapsed since it was written. It cuts away the ground from those who 'hold baptismal re generation possible, who.practico infant sprinkling, or observe adult immersion. The argument is shortly this: ,Tews wore initiated into a tem poral covenant by circumcision: the coming of Christ was prefaced by the advent of John and his water baptism of repentance ; the ascension of the Saviour inaugurated a new dispensa tion-the baptism of the Spirit. After the day of Pentecost, Timothy was circumcised and believers were baptised in water; but the former was a Mosaic institution, the latter a Baptist institu tion;.i both temporary, and superseded by what John himself described (Matt. iii. 11, ll e iii. 16) as the bap tismi of Christ: ,'"-Ho shall bap tise you with = the -Holy Ghost and w-vwith fire.'" This prediction was accomplisihed according to the writer of the Acts of the Apostles in the following mnanner--" And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon leach of them. And they were allfilled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utteratice." We purposely avoid expressing an opinion on the subject and desire that each should be at liberty to decide for himself. Tih discourse of Mr. William Dell, who was master of Gonvil and Caius Col lege, Cambridge, two centuries ago, is no ordinary production, and we merely remind the render that "there were giants in those days." The pamphlet can be obtained at Mr. Hudson's, Bris bane-street, price is. Gd., according to advertisement.
