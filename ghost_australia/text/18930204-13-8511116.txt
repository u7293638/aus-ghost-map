THE JANUARY MAGAZINES. Blackwood begins the 77th year of its existence by putting on a new suit of clothes ; or, in other words, by appearing on large paper, with broad margins, new type, and a generally improved aspect, as if it meant to renew its lusty youth. A fresh serial story is commenced under the title of " Earlscourt," the scene of which is laid in a country town, and the circumstances under which the pro- digal son abruptly returns in prosperity to the place of his birth are calculated to pique the curiosity of the reader at the outset. The benighted politicians who attribute the bad plight in which the English farmer finds himself to free trade will be angry with Mr. J. B. Kinnear for showing that the American farmer is much worse off than the British agriculturist, while he indicates how a net profit of 24 an acre may be made from the land even with wheat at 4s. a bushel. He also contends that on 0,000,000 acres the mother country could grow all the wheat she now imports, leaving 15,000,000 acres of her present pasture land for other grain and the feeding of more cattle and sheep. Recent events in Dahomey have been so difficult to follow that an article containing a succinct narrative of them, by Mr. A. P. Crouch, is both opportune and acceptable. The French had no option but to attack and punish the half-civilised savage who now reigns over the country is but it is to be feared that the deadly nature of the climate will always be a bar to its profitable occupation by its conquerors, while its natural products are said to offer no opening for European commerce. A review of some recent works of German fiction speaks in terms of high praise of one of the psychological studies of Max Nordau, whose writings are said to breathe the very quintessence of the nineteenth century spirit, An essay on Mobs is directed to show how easily popular demonstrations may ripen into disastrous revolutions where Governments are weak, and tolerate excesses which should he firmly repressed at once, as incompatible with law and older. Professor Blackie analyses some recent "leases on Phrialinn misses " lv recent Essays on christian Greece, by Demetrios Bikelas, which have just, been translated by the Marquess of Bute, and declares that " there is not a single scene in the whole of that wonderful drama, from Constantine to King George, which the learned and judicious Hellene does not touch with the feeling of a brother, the hand of a master, and the impartiality of a judge." A clever paper on Ornament, by Sir Herbert Maxwell, animadverts on the dearness of taste which universally prevails, and reminds the London County Council of what a splendid opportunity is presented to it of adopting a spirited policy in public works. Writing on " Our Mission in Egypt," a contributor points out that in the short period of six years British rule in that country has been the means of placing it in a position of solvency, and that to relinquish its occupation before the work is finished would he treason both to civilisation and humanity. The political article is entitled "A Retrospect and at Prospect," and dealt trenchantly'' with the " eccentric imbecilities" of Mr. Morley, and with the conduct of those who are " drugging the name of Liberal through the dirt." A memoir and portrait of the Archbishop of Westminster are given in the current number of the English Illustrated Magazine, followed by a description, with several views, of the Chicago Exhibition, which will cover just five times the area of the Crystal Palace in Hyde-park, while all. manufactures building is the largest structure in the world. Mr. Burne-Jones and his art form the theme of a laudatory disquisition by a writer who places him amongst the greatest of English painters, and gives seven examples of his work. Captain Price sketches the military career of four famous Generals in the British army and Mr. S. J. Weyman takes us through the Pyrenees in December, beginning at Olornn and ending at Bosost, describing the people and the scenery he met with by the way. Mr. W. T. Greene introduces us to some of the song-birds of India, one of which, the shaina, seems tocxcelev'cnthenightingalc, Mr. Bret Harte concludes his story of ally Dews," and Mr. Henry Herman con tributes a clever novelette, entitled "The Last Letter." Writing of the South Meath election petition, in the Fortnightly Review, Mr. J. E. Redmond, M.P., deduces from it the moral that there are large masses of Catholics in Ireland who are determined to think and act for themselves in political affairs, and that there is no fear of clerical ascendancy in the event of Home Rule being conceded to that country. Mr. W. J. Corbet, who states that his avocations have imposed upon him for years past a close and continuous study of the statistics of insanity, showed from official figures, that there is an appalling increase in the ratio of the insane to the same in the mother country, and that the number of the former has considerably more than doubled in one generation. Speak- ing from personal acquaintance with the Ameer of Afghanistan, Sir Lepel Griffin protests against his being connected with every trivial dispute on the north-west frontier, and against it is being worried into an altitude of coldness or hostility by Indian officials ; pointing out, at the same time, that for the past eleven years he has behaved in a loyal, friendly; and honourable manner towards Great Britain. Cast. away on the shores of Terra del Fuego, and constrained to remain there for two months, Mr. D. R. O'Sullivan is enabled to contribute a highly interesting account of that little known region and its cannibal inhabitants, who constitute a race in themselves, distinct from all others in appearance, language, customs, and beliefs. Another of the fallacies so dear to the heart of the protectionist, namely', that highly-paid Labour requires to be protected against competitors earning low wages in other countries, is mercilessly knocked on the head by Mr. D. F. Schloss, who proves that cheap labour is the dearest of all labour, and that the superior productiveness of the highly-paid operative renders him more than a match for his underpaid rival elsewhere. The late Sir Thomas Brassey demonstrated this when making French railways half a century ago.

Professor Muhally exposes and de- nounces the sham education of the du). He asks what primary instruction leads to, and replies, " to the leading of the lowest and worst forms of ephemeral literature. I mean that which is distinctly intended to be in Barometer), to rouse passions, of which the political, which are bad enough, are perhaps, the least reprehensible."
