Vhe fiarlr Closing Bill. The iEarly Closing Bill has at last ..got. as:far as tlie Legislative Council to die there. The Conservatives have fowled : for months about the Bill, •frightened country people about what never-rhad -a ghost of chance of ever iifiecting them, misinformed people signed petitions by the thousand, and there was a general corroboree about nothing. The Government and the Labor <Party stuck to the original Bill with , stubborn tenacity, in face of an utter iuipossiliility of success; fiually the amend men ts of Mr Morris^ Secretary of the Independent Party, were in most cases incorporated and after days of wasted time, due to the stonewalling tactics of the opposition on one hand and the stubbornness of the ;Premier on the other, the Bill lias passed the Assembly. Had the Premier agreed four months ago with ihe Independent Party to make it a half holiday Bill,-it would be in the Statute Book to-day, but as it is, stripped of two-thirds of i«s original appendages and not as good as a haif holiday bill pure and simple, it is likely to be interred in tlie channel house of slaughtered innocents.
