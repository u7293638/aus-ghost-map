A case of great profligacy was brought under the notice of the Sandhurst bench on 5th inst., An elderly man, named Thomas Kilby, was brought before the court, accom- panied by his daughter, a girl about sixteen years of age, charged with having no lawful means of support. The evidence adduced by the witnesses— principally Chinaimen— was, that the father had, in the first instance, sold his daughter to a Chinese "shanty- keeper," living near the Sydenham Gardens; and that after allowing her to live with the fellow for some months, on condition that he maintained her, father and his other children, he took her away, and became a procurer of the prostitution of his daughter amongst the Chinese residents of the Ironbark Encampment. The details of the circumstances connected with the depraved and profligate conduct of the father are of too immoral a character for publication. The police magistrate very properly sentenced the father and daughter to twelve months' impri- sonment. We often talk about the hideous immorality of the Chinese, but in this case, at all events, it is outdone by European depravity. ?

Even tho Postmaaler-GPneriil appeared to, be aware that it was rather a tough point to decide, At length Sir William Maiming gave; andiblb expression to what appeared tebe uppermost in' everybody's mhid, and asked this joint blank question.^1 Where is Columbia V- Vaguo. re miniscences associated with the patriotic air of ?Hail, Columbia'/ possibly suggested, the idea that it might be some now appellation of the f United States of America,' par excellence ; bat Captain -Towns gave the matter quit© another aspect byboldly expressing his belief that it might bo probably the North Amercion colony of ?

It was six o'clock and dark, When tliG boat bnilt by Cobb and Co. was engaged in, cpnve^ying the mails and parcels brought by the coach across .the river. There were a ; nnrnber .of peaj^e waiting, to. be ferried over from the Kelsoside, and, against the wish , of. the person in chavgo of. tlie boat, seven or eight of these jumped in, .and amongst them a, drunken raffian,..who, see iug.a female in the boat, stood on..the!gunwale, and commenced rocking it from side te side, despite all entreaties. The boat -^vas. yery deej) in the water, the sides not being more than n : few inches above its level. . When the centra of the stream was reached, an extra lurch given by the fellow turned the boat completely over, and the passengers were precipitated into llio river. All were saved but two — Mr Caples and Mrs Croft — who were drowned, and though the iivor has been dragged ' all day, their bodies have . riot been recovered. There has been another accident just now with another boat, and one or two more lives nearly lost, but luckily those immersed were picked up in time, one being quite insensible.' The Herald, with natural indignation, observes ? that ' The circumstances at tending tho death of these two porsons, if correctly given, call for some rigorous mea sure by which life may not be jeopardised through the conduct of the numerous drunken scoundrels who are often f erried over the cross ing places on the rivers of this colony. It is really a matter of surprise that seven or eight men will permit one ruffian, like the man who has been .the cause of the deaths of Mr Caples . and Mrs Croft, to pursue such a : cowardly course as that of frightening a woman in the manner adopted by this brute. Had such an act been perpetrated in America, it is more than .probable tho delinquent would have been , hung on the first tree available for tho purpose ; and if ever Lynch law could be justified, it wpuld-have been in this instance.' The Southland News tells us a queer story to the following effect : — ' Two or three days ago a respectable looking person of quiet man ners walked into our omce, and requested to be- shown a copy of the News ©f the 11th instant. The file was of course handed to tho visitor, who with, infinite gravity pointed out ak extract paragraph from the Hampshire Advertiser (respecting the Tichborno romance) and with a look evidently intended to ? be at once myste rious and solemply impressive, ; said— placing the point of his index linger . under tho words ' Sir Roger. , Tichborno,' — ' I am that person.' Naturally wo felt a gentle surprise at the an nouncement of a' duplicate baronet. . The new Sir Roger further, informed us that he intended to take passage for England immediately, and after, some few commonplace remarks he left witbont ; haying introduced the subject of a loan. . , It seems, however, that the baronet, ,who turns out to be a shoemaker with the very plebeian name of Thomas Wholan, made Boine purchases arid paid, them '..in cheques signed R. C. Tichborne, for doing which ho has come to grief, and is now in custody of the police, at Iurercargill. It is supposed that the iinfei'tunate baronet is cracked. ?A boy named William Hettman vmet with his death in a singular and dreadful manner, on Thursday, 4th inst;, on one of tho land selections iu the area of Wircholiba. A wit ness examined at the coroner's inquest'gavo the following account of the disaster: — ' On Thursday evening last, about six. o'clock, I heard a noise outside tho house, which seemed unusual. I went outside, and saw a maro with hobbles on. At tho same instant another horse came round, and then I heard; a scream. I called out to Boyle, the shepherd, that tiw horse had made off, and that tho bov was entangled in tho tothcr-rope. I ran after the horse with an., axe, think ing the horso .would balk at the fence. Tho horse got to tho fence , and leaped over, dragging the deceased after him; 1 went back to the house and we got candles hi .bottles and searched for deceased, but con\\-7 not find any traces of him all that night. At daylight next morning, after reporting the matter, we resumed the search and found tho body of deceased about a quarter of a milo fram the hut; ho was lying on Iris; 'jack ami was quite dead. The police caro-o, and the body was curried into Glenovchy. The boy hadbeen.on the f mm about a fortnight, and was engaged to look after tho pb\co and coo!: for the shepherd and myself. I. had not told hint to go after the horse. Fxo had caught the horso tho same afternoon nnd brought' him to tho stable. I told him he had better turn him out.

' v ' -? . v '' '.: If Mr Longmore has not yet read the fable ; of the gold and silver shield, he would do well to make himself conversant with that' trito little story and its moral. There are two sides £b every question, and it entirely depends^upon the point of view from which it is studied, whether it is the right or the wrong one. The story told Mr Longmore by Mr John Bell, of Flinders-street, of his being compelled to, sell a subdivision of his land for a consideration was a good one until the other side was heard, when it assumed a very different aspect as told by Mr Grant. His reply has placed both Mr Longmore and Mr Bell in a most unequivocal position, and it is due to Mr Grant that a dis claimer should be' made by Mr 'Longmore of any knowledge of . the letters of Mr Bell and the statutory declaration of Mr Eaves, 'which so emphatically contradict his' assertions, otherwise he stands convicted of resorting to the most contemptible means to gratify his spleen against the Minister of Lands.
