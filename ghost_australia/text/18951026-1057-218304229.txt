Old Favourite. ' ' haunted houses. ALi. hoiiROS wheroin mo3 h&vo; lived and died Are haunted houses. Through tho open doors Tho harmless phantoms on Inch: errands " glide, With feet that maka no souna upon vac floors. . Wo moot them at tho doorway, on tlio stair, Aloug tho passages they como and go, Impalpable impressions on the air, A tense of something moving to and fro. ' There aro moro guests at table than tho hosts Invited ; the illumioatcd hall Is thronged with quiet, inoflensivo ghosts, As silent as tho pictures ou the wall. The stranger at my fircsldo can not sco Tho forms I sco, nor hear tho sounds I hear ; Ho hut perceives what is, while unto mo All that has been is viulblo and clear. Wo havo no title-deeds to houso or lands; Owners and occupants of cnrlicr dates From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands, And hold In mortmain still their old estates. Tho spiril-worjd around this world of sense Floats liko an atmosphere, and everywhere Wafts through these earthly mists and vapors donso A vital breath of moro cthcroal air. Our Uttlo lives nro kept In equipoise By opposite attractions and desires ; Tho struggle of tho instinct that enjoys, And tho more noble instinct that aspires. Those perturbations, this perpetual jar Of earthly wants, and aspirations high, Come from tho influence of an unseen star, An undfeoovercd planet in our sky. Aud as tho moon from somo dark goto of cloud Thiows o'er tho sea a floating bridge of light, Across whoso trembling planks our fanoics crowd Into the realm of mystery and nightâ€” So from the world of spirits thcro descends A bridge of light, connecting it with this, O'er whoso unsteady floor, that sways aud betid, Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss. Henky W. Longfellow.
