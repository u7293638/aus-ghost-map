A Reminiscence of Tennyson. At His Son's Wedding. I was present in Westminster Abbey on the occasion of the wedding of Lionel Tennyson, son of the poet. It was a most memorable gathering. All the Whig and Liberal aristocracy were there, and almost every representative of English letters. Dean Stanley, who was in bed and not well enough to perform the marriage, had arranged that, as Mrs. Tennyson was an invalid, and the poet did not wish to be needlessly stared at, they should come in with their son Hallam by the little private north door in the nave. But when they got there they found it locked, and had to make their way round by the deanery. Meanwhile the service had inevitably be gun, for the bride aud bridegroom were ready in their places, and the abbey was thronged from end to end. The service was being performed, in the Dean's inevi table absence, by Archdeacon Farrar. Mrs. Tennyson, who was even then a great invalid, came in, supported by her husband and her elder son, only just in time to hear the words— "I pronounce that they be man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Tlj^Hkrriage register was signed in the Jerusalem Chamber, which was crowded with celebrities. The poet was of course to sign it, and I had to conduct him through the crowd. As we passed a lady stepped out, and said— " How do you do, Mr. Tennyson ?" " How do you do ?" answered the poet eordially. " I don't in the least know who you are." " I am Mrs. Lewes," she said. It was the only time in my life that I saw George Eliot. The poet knew her perfectly well. She was, in fact, one of his nearest neighbours; but, as he pro ceeded to explain to her, the chamber was dark,a,nd dim, and he was short- sighted. —Archdeacon Farrar (in the Sunday Magazine).
