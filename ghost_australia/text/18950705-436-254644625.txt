THE EDUCATION OF NERVOUS CHILDREN. It is difficult to exaggerate the evil that may be worked upon a nervous child by the tales of ghosts, robbers, bogies, or policemen, with which many children are continuously indulged. The inculcation of tbe precepts of religion also too often becomes the means by which terrifying ideas are implanted in tbe infant mind, much to the disturbance of that peacefulness dnring tbe hours of rest which is essential to its normal development. It is pitiful to think of the number of children who instead of dropping into dreamless slumber look forward to bedtime as a time of terror bury their faces in tbe bedclothes, and only when exhausted fall asleep, haunted by visions of ,a constant all-seeing eye, by dread of unending torments for each unforgiven, may be forgotten, little fault, and by fear of lightning and other natural phenomena which they have been taught are instruments of wrath. From all such thoughts the developing brain should be protected. But later on, when education, as it is now understood, begins, the child, among whose ancestors neurosis has prevailed, re. quires even more protection, for every iaflciencc 53 often brought to boar to ciidurl hie mental rquililir'aro. If he ic cMl ar.d backward he is punished ; if be Is blight, intelligent and precocious he becomes the pride of his teachers and is set to win scholarships for the of hia school, la either case he is ex- posed to the very turmoil of mind from which he should be most protected.
