OUR LUNATIC. WE once had a lunatic on our staff. He disappeared telling us that he was going from " the aunts of men," and his farewell words were, " de gustibus nil boni nisum." Like imported bacon, his Latin was rather rusty. This week, however, he has turned up again. Perhaps there has been an escape from Kew. Like the ghost of Hamlet's papa, he always came in a qvestwnaMe shape. His form was that of a demented note of interrogation. He invariably wanted to know something. He now seeks information on the following points :— Are potatoes matrimonially inclined wlien they require pa(i)ring? Has the Queen's new title made a good empress-ion on India ? Does the Indian doctor of Emerald Hill prescribe black draughts ? Is it likely that a minister of a large congregation would go in for payment of members; and when the congregation go to bed, do they sleep on & flock mattrass ? At Scotfs Hotel, are haggis, porridge, and other Caledonian delicacies provided? If Aarons objects to Lewis favouring dead-heads, does Creswick think that Phillips went for lire ones ? Is there a ring in the music of the opera of Belle Poule? If, as Swift says, "a nice man is a man of nasty ideas," is not the Rev. H. B. Macartney the nicest man in Victoria? Is Lalor the Ince-stigator of the unseating of Levien ? Would a proper epitaph on a deceased coal-merchant be " peace to his ashes ?" Will the Hobson's Bay Railway people give a pedestrian running powers over their line? TIME-PAYMENT.—Purchasing a watch. A SAFETY MATCH.—A sparring one, where the combatants are "warranted to strike only on the bow."
