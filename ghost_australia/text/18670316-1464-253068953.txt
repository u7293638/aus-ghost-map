SOMETHING LIKE A THEATRICAL NOTICE. By Our Great Hypercritic. "Justice wheels about and twirls about, and jumps Jem Crow." — Shakspeare. E are glad to be able to re cord that the new drama of Berinthia the Blue- mouldy (adapted from the French of Leonardo da Vinci) was deservedly a ung grong soucsay, and is decidedly one of the very best and meri torious works ever sub mitted to public attention by its author, Mr. William Shakspeare, Esq. , who sent it out expressly to the man agement. Mr. Buffer was the perfection of a famished father, some of his points reminding us strongly of Mr. George Coppin as Ham let — Mr. Smith was himself — need we say more — so was Mr. Jones, can we say less — Brown was funny as the murderer, and Mr. Green was excruciatingly rich as the ghost. The great sen sation -scene in the last act but seven where the heroine is rescuedby her father's bull f noble Arthur, in the larue bills), was oneofthose striking bits of nature which John Philip Kemble would have revelled in. Mr. Bellows' imitation of the Jackass in the ball-room was not acting — it was nature. Mr. Tomkin's Stout was delicious, and Johnson's Snout really immense. The shipwreck scene was remarkably grand, and biit that the dust raised by the raging billows nearly choked the pit and buried the stalls, would have com pletely realised the idea of a lighter hurrying to eternity — a more judicious arrangement of the Ipecacuanha light in the dark scene would be, in our opinion, more judicious. Notwithstanding the dis approbation at the fall of the curtain, the piece may be as fairly called a legitimate and unqualified success, as many others we already have had the pleasure of commenting upon. P.S. — Since writing the above, we hear the piece was not played at all, so our readers will be kind enough not to read this till it comes out, and so save us further trouble.
