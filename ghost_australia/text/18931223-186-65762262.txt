MELBOURNE GOSSIP. [FEOM A. LADT CO£KE£PONDENT.] Dear Lai,— Picnics are the fashionable amnsement at Unr eexsoa. There are picnic club* the members of which call themselves '* butterflies n or ' grawboppere, ~ and fly off to the country or seaside whenever posstble. Tbey rtarr hy special rrain euiy hx tfce afier □ooq, t'k*riffrr'fn'mbiT[iwTP witfa tit**™. =oic&hie; for a tea. When night falls they adjourn to a ball (there is generally one with a piano available &t; these rtsortt) and the ' butter flies' ball that follows is a very enjoyable finale to tbe day's outing. At one of these gatherings, eigbt pceny girls fussed up as tee train started and begged » yonsg and verdant male 'bctterflv ' to jet their octets, which he did, and is 'still »»itiEg to be paid. The same damsels moDopoliseu more than their ehare of atteoaon in tbe over-womaned dance that it was discovered that ' those creatores ' I'ome months aso Melbourne was completely gfaosx-nddeo. Every snburb had its own 'appalling tp-im and tricky ~* ghuet- There was tbe hopping ghost, which leapt across the street at a. boc&df; and Tasked a fence ? x feet high on the other side. There was the mounted gho&t;, which, dressed in while, rode a snowy charger: and there was a 'chic thing ' in gfaoste, which suddenly throwing back a. long black cloak, revealed » horrid form wre&thed; in phoephoresceat fiam*w vTomea were afraid to star out after d&rk;, and even Betsy Jane in the kitchen left off having to be afraid. Let xhfrrv wring their bony hands and tremble, as they sit ia the dark among the tombs ; for the 'Psychical Be they and that new-fangled spirit, Mr. Stead's ' Spook,' are to be run to earth and bro&gbt; forth to tbe light. I do not know whether the ghost hunters win be able to do anything for the n-ian who is haunted by— Ghosts ot ' Copy, declined vith Lh*cfc*-'~ Bat perhaps whea they hare reduced all the popenr parts, tbey will in\'e&Ugate; his case. 'iheSonnnerGirl'©* the ' Block ' looks her best at this season. She is arrayed in a white pink or blue lines frock, a mnal) sailor hat encircled by a gold-lettered black band is placed on fEy* Ir^k of her bead, to show a. trimly coded fringe (the hair bong do longer wwn'aft if the bos had been ecra- dang in n) and her feet are clad in white doe-ekin shoes, so that altogeth- r ehe is a cool and refreshing ei^ht on » hot day. Max O'BeU says toe Australian wooua are the moat frivoJoua be has ever w»*». My maiden aunt says, that as children they are brought forward too much at M breaking up parties ' and dancing school demonstratuniE, and so learn to dunk over much of excitement and display. lately Mts. Green's d^^ftng classes gave an entertamment in aid of the charities. Some five hundred children took part in it, a&d; the afiair was opened by the Mayor of Melbourne. The cb fldren'e dresso out -rivalled those cf thesta^e, and little maids of tender years capered, pirouetted, and twirled before the foot lights, on the tips of their bahy toea, with all the skill and *4 sang frotd' of profesaonal baUel dancers. Aunt wa& horrified, and as boou as she has per suaded Parliament to label all smoking men *' Beware of this animal, he spitr,' she intends to torn her attention to the dancing questian. The latter day plague of State School con certs is again raging, and no youngster puses a boose, without ringing the bell and trying to sell tickets. la a row of villas near a Urge eaburban school tbe ujmAtes resorted to btraiaptm, and swathed thtir knockers id white kid slov^*,. bat they were immediately invaded by vendors of patent feeding bottles, who refos-^i to belK-ve that their wares were cot re^uirtd, and were harder to shake off thao the juvenile-.
