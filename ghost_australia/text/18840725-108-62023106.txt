3Ab PORTFOLIO. - The Holy Ghost-likeneth the name of the bridegroom 1t oil when He maketh the bride say to the. Bridegroom, "Thy name is as oil poured forth." Oil indeed giveth light meat, and unction. It feedeth fire, it nourisheth the flesh, it a'ootheth pain,--it is light, food, and heal ing. Behold thus is the name of the 4Bridegroom-to preach it is to give light, to think of it is to feed the soul, to call on it is to win grace and unction. What bath made the light of faith so suddenly and so brightly to shine in the whole wrorld, but the preaching of the name of Jesus ? Is it not in the light of this name 'that God hath called us unto His marve lous light ? Dost thou ever call ittomind and remain unstrengthened? Is there anything like it to enrich the soul of him that thinketh of it ? What is there like it to give birth to good lives and pure af fections ? Behold, when the day of that 'name beginneth to break, every cloud will flee away, and there will be a great calm. -St. Bernard.
