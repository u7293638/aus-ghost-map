THARGOMINDAH RACES. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) May 9. The annual meeting of the Thargomindah Jockey Club was held on the local racecourse on Thursday and Friday last, and was one of the dullest and least interesting meetings ever witnessed here. In the majority of the events only two horses started, and the results were almost a foregone conclusion. The two big handicaps (the Jockey Club Handioap and Bulloo Handicap) wore simply matches between two horses, as all the others had been scratohed for reasons best known to the owners them- Belves. The Opening Handicap on the Becond day resulted in a walk over for Sting. The track was in splendid order after the recent rains, so it was a pity that the fields were not larger and the racing more interesting. The attendance was very small for an annual meet ing, but I am pleased to be able to report that the olub made a substantial profit. The fol lowing are the results:— Maiden Plate, of 15 sovs.; 1£ Mile.— Blackbird, Bat. 101b., 1; Cassius, Bst. 21b., 2. Won easily. Handicap Jumping Back, of 30 sovs., 1J Mile.—The Ghost, lOat. 131b., 1; Odd Sook, 9st. 101b., 2. A very good race, both horses jumping splendidly. Won by two lengths.

This was one of the best races of the meeting, all the horses being bunched together till the home turn, where Jackson, Gaylad, and Defiance oamo away, and a great race up the straight ensued. Jackson won by a length from Gaylad, with Defianoe olose np. Consolation Handicap, of 15 sovs.; 1 Mile. —Defiance, Bst. 101b., 1; Marion, Bit. 61b., 2; Lunatio, 7st. 101b., 3. Good race between Defianoe and Marion. Won by a length. The return oricket matoh, Town v. Country, was played on the 6th instant, and resulted in a win for the Town after one of the most ex citing matches ever played in Thargomindah, by only 2 runs. The Town batted first, and com piled 54 runs, Chessman contributing 23 and Stacey 8, by careful cricket. The Country then handled the willow, and their last wicket fell when the score stood at 52, of whioh J. Cordner, by vigorous hitting, contributed 18.
