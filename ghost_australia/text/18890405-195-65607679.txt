A BOSTON HYMN. Thee nations have their little day,] To rise, to flourish and decay; But from the eternal arches springs Thy Kindom, O Thou King of kings ! " . Thy ceaselessages ., \- We yield our swift, uncertain breath ;.. Thinse if the power to vanquish death. No'throne its trrnsient head uprears, No planet swings amid the spheres, But shall proclalm, in rise or fall, Thine is the Glory, Lord of all!. Grant us Thy grace that evermore Our little wills Thy will adore ; One Kindom, Power, and Glory boast Through Father, Son, and Holy Ghost !
