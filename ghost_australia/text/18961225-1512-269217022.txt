Tlie Dust of Ages. All the world is covered thickb ivith the dust of ages, writes James C Purdy. What of that? Nothing; onli :he dust of ages — much of it — is th' lust of dead people. In dry weathe ive sprinkle the ground to keep dowi ihe dust of remote ancestors. In we veather we wade through mud com Bounded of forgotten generations We are curiously thoughtless of al hat. We fence in our cemeteries an< Drol ect the graves there with reveren jare. The man who carelessly steps 01 1 sodded mound feels that he has dese jrated the home of the dead. Yet hf vill tramp for miles along roads and tcross fields with never a thought of tht mortality beneath him. Plenty of people are afraid to live lear or even pass through, a graveyard Because of possible ghosts. If ghost rise from graves, think of the disem Bodied Indians and Mound Builden likely to exhale from every cellar ir America! We moralize over the skull >f poor Yorick, because it happens tc kave kept its shape. But when the lead Caesar has turned to clay wc Blaster up a crack with him, nevei Bothering our brains about the wonder hi man he used to be. Well, that ii is it should be.

There arc o many of them that we never could hink of anything else if we though' nuch of them. And in comfortably orgetting them we may justify our elves, if we choose, with this reflection V thousand years from now our poster ty will be dealing with us precisely a: ve are dealing to-day with those ole mcestors of ours.
