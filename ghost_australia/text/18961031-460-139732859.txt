THE SERMON. 'THE SERVICE 01' SONG.' By the Itev. Dr. WATKIN, Wesleysn Minister, Melbourne. Psalm cl, 1.—Praise God in Ilis sanctuary. On a forme? occasion we referred to Uio import ance ot praise in connection with sanctuary worship, to the underlying unity of tlie Christian church as shown in the varied authorship of our hymns, and to tiie indebtedness of the Christian churches for some of their best-known hymns, to metrical ver sions or paraphrases of the Hebrew psalms. With out making any further remarks- on. the transla tions of Greek and Latin hymns, a pissing re ference ii necessary to our obligation to Ccrman hymn-writers. Towards the close of the last century a list of nearly 73,000 German hymns, arranged in alphabetical order, was published, and the number has been largely increased during the present century. Martin Luther wrote many stirring hymns. Coleridge said that Luther did as much for the Reformation by his hymns as t# iris translation of the Bible. Most hymn-books owe some of their noblest hymps about God, His attributes, and His providential government, about Christ and His work of redemption, and about the Holy Spirit and His influences on the church aud the individual Christian to translations of the hymns of Rolhe, Scheffler, Ziuaendorf, Gcihardt, and oLher German hymn-writers. Comparatively few of the hymns written in the English language in common use in church praise date back beyond the ISth century. Early in that century Bishop Ren wrote his morning and evening hymns. It has been said that he did inoro for the Church of England whqp he wrote tliosc two hymns than if he liad endowed a couple of bishoprics. There arc many doxologies in the English language, but pre-eminent among them ail is Hen's " Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow; Praise Him all creatures here below; Praise Ilim above, ye heavenly host— Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." Jolm Wesley objected very much to anyone alter ing his brother's or his own hymns, but he him self altered the hymns of other writers freely, and generally unproved them, and notably this was the case in some of the hymns of Isaac Watts. An alteration he made once wlton giving out in a religious sendee Bishop Ken's dcxology was not a poetical improvement. He substituted for tlie third line these words— "Who would not have one sinner lost." Our hymnals owe a great debt of obligation to the hymnists of the great evangelical revival of the last century. Among these tiie most eminent were Cowper, Newton, Doddridge, Watts, and Charles Wesley. Comparatively few of the poets of England have been successful as hymn-writers, with the exception of Ooxvper and James Mont gomery. The Olney hymns, so popular a century ago, were the joint productions * of Oowper and Newton. Among Cowper'a best-known hymns are "God Moves in a Mysterious Way," "There is a Fountain Filled with Blood," "O for a Closer Walk with God," "Jesus, Where'er Thy People Meet," and "Sometimes a Light Surprises." John Newton had forgotten the teachings of his godly mother. He was the mate of a slave-ship olf the coast of Africa. During a thunderstorm he was the subject of religious awakening, aud re luming home to England . he become an eminent minister of the Church of England and the writer ot many hymns, which helped in the promotion of the great evangelical re viral. Although Ins hymns are not so well known now as they were in the early part ot this century, some of them rank among the best-known hymns ot Christendom. IDs hymn, "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds," stands side.by.aide jn popular csteoin with Saint Bernard's "Jcsu, the very thought of : Thee." Among those in all the churches who believe in the power of prayer his hymn "Come, my soul, thy suit prepare" is.justly esteemed. Another well-known hymn ot his begins with the Words, "Glorious tilings of Thee are spoken." Philip Doddridge, a Oongregationallst minister _ and theological writer, hflB given to Hie Christian church some beautiful hymns." In many •noncon formist churches his hymn "Sec laud's Gentje bL^L^.I'01-^JII A— -.r -A II.. LnnffeMMl *lt>. All Thy metrics, oli my God." Olheiu of his most " " — God of OcHiel, by Widely-used hymns are "0, God of Bethel, by Whose hand," and his Easter saw?, A- humble Souls that seek the Lord."

After * weary day'* travel he and j his family came at night to an inn, and the wife, i dispirited. bewailed their sad lot. ller husband tried to comfort her by quoting from one of the j Psalms, ti lth that Psalm on his mind he wrote j a hymn, which stands in the front rank among | all the hymns, teaching us to remember God's I superintending providence. Among its verses are ' these:— '• Give to the winds thy fears. Hope and be undismayed. Cxi hears thv sighs and counts thy tears, fku shall lift up thy head. Through waves and clouds and storms Ho gently clears thy way. Wait. thou. His time; so shall this night Soon end in joyous day. Isaac Watts sat. .n the early summer, on a hill in Hampshire, and looked over the waters of the Solent, to the green fields of the Isle of Wight. The scenery before him suggested that hymn about heaven, which is such a favourite with children, the middle-aged, and those who are drawing near the end of life. The land and sea. before him sug gested these linos;— '• Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood. Stand dressed in living green. So to the Jews Old Canaan stood. While Jordan rolled between." A Baptist minister in the Tutted States, silting in ids study at Brooklyn, was thinking of the | large number of persons who had died through : the epidemic which was then raging. His thoughts i took this direction. Shall 1 meet those who have ; gone down to the river of death st the river of : life? Sitting down at the organ, the words and ! music of the well-known hymn cgme to him as j an inspiration— ! Shall we gather at the river. | Where bright angel feet have trod, j With its crystal tide forever | Flowing from the throne of God." _ Let us seek to sing with the spirit and the un derstanding to make the psalm and hymn, and spiritual song the means of expressing our peni tence. cur thankfulness. our hopes, and cur fears, and so shall the service of praise on earth fit us for life's duties, sustain as in life's sorrows, cheer ns at Sifs's o 1 :~e. And when we have censed to take part in the songs of tbechufch en earth, we Hall be L und joining in the songs of the church in fcearen. ,
