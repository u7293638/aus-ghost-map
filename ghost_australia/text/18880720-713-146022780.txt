The Value of the Stage and the Decline of Art. BY Al/FBKD DAMJ'IISR. As all men and women are capable in some degree of feeling pleasure and pala, consequently the ohlef end of and aim of their doalrea 1« to avoid pain and se«k plensure. All, except the few whose en" joyments and aspirations are passionately bound up with the work of the day, mutt get a respite from the monotonous labor, and to eDjoy lb thoroughly mast turn their thought* from the well-worn grooves and moulds In which the machine of every day business mores, and repair to those metaphorical gardens and meadows and lakes bathed In sunshine nod kept In order by the imagination through the efforts of poets, painters, ao,d, playeiy. The Drama, which is pootr.y In Us highest and most suggestive, as well as Its most compact form, has ever oceu the chief Intellectual relaxation of the gene ral public. It places the j >ya, sorrows, passions, fears, struggles, temptations, and triumphs that are the essouae of poetry living before the audience, and makes every spectator, as it were, a poet for the time being by inspiring bim with vivid sympathy for the passions and emotions portrayed. Men and women, howdver, much resemble the " muttons of Pan urge" - when one breaks through thicket the others follow headlong-and there is much discussion at the present time as to the decline in dramatic tire and the desire made manifest by that many-headed personality the play-going publlo for other pursuits, There aan be no doubt also that skating rinks, whloh under a thin disguise have taken the place of the old danalag-rooms, have, to use an Americanism, " caught on." But that theatrical art has lost its value as a teacher, and a very groat teacher, exists only in the invertebrate imagination of fanatics, fanned Into h ilimo by in terested speculators. 1 may point out also that in its entire history thorn has never been a time when the stage has not been exposed to the severest con demnation our languago is capable of expressing. It has always been giving up the ghost, always doiul, or worthy of death ; but the drama is a vital principle, and must survive all vlcclssltudo while civilisation endures. And there has boon no epooh in histrionic history when the profession of acting-a pro£es«iou to whlah 1 am proud to answer to my name when the " muster " is cmlled -was so honored by the wide sympathy of Intel leotual greatness, But a jar Is fult by those who really lovo art by the at titude soalcty takes with rogard to her. Society may ' bo sukl at prusout to flirt only with art, not to marry hur, not to knit her Into the earnest, real iU'u of ovory-day dutltis, Ttiord is a wwut of trim aousltlvcness among the Philistine class, as to the hli<h position which Dramatic Art has taken and t.hu highest poult Ion to which she is utt titled, l t'aul that it H strange that this ooardoturns i>f llbro and want of Intelligent study of the things whloh we learti through the uyu artd ear, whim there h so tnuoh doll eaey and subtlety In the study of thought and books. Thus the players proper mttlor Is that of a toaohor who fathoms the depths of churactur, who truue.4 Its latent motives, who oomprohoiuls its philosophy, arid thus possessing hlmsjlf ol! the autual mind of man, holds him up as a mirror to .Naturu, And it speaks volumes for the drama's onjn-lf. dt> aorjitt in mi ago when play.goorsi too oftcin pay a player In an Inverse ratio to Ills deserts, whim they go to the tlijatro, nob to see tliu play, but because It Is the l'n>ihloii, or that tliuy am bored ; that theiitrloal art now-a-days In mo re coherent, system iMo, anil (lompreliiiiislvu than It has ever biien, The exact. ell\ietalso of the actor In Intro, duclng relltdiig lulltumooH to (hit great ''heart and brains" ol' the people hin hardly been reallseil, Without, the sugn where are those who do not go to ohuroh. who are not reaehe I by the glovod hand of fashionable religion to leant oven mi elementary Idea of morality1/ Tho teach Ing of the theatre reaches m.hiv who would Hull the teaching ol' the iiluirclt above their heads, at least, lint, for II, It Is a step to higher tilings, ami It.
