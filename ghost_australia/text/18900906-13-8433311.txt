THE JULY REVIEWS. It would be difficult to point to a number of the Quartet in Rev. cw presenting a more judicious diversity of articles than will be found in the current number, which opens with a paper on Eton College, and conclude with a survey of the calamitous results of 20 years of Home Rule in New York The first named article is, to a great extent, historical, and traces the rise and progress of that famous school with affectionate care, while at the same time calling upon the methods of instruction and government pursued by recent Provosts Gustav Freytag ' Reminiscences of the Crown Prince of Prussia, afterwards the Emperor 1 redencl, are subjected to dissection by a critic, who shows that they have been inspired by the Bismarck Memorial, and by other papers directed against friends or associates of the late Emperor, and that the book is in many respects untrustworthy in fact it appears to have been the work of a man who has been disloyal to her dear friend and former sovereign in order to curry favour with the then all powerful Chancellor Not only so, but, while ostensibly professing an enthusiastic admiration for the ability of the Crown Princess Trcytag does not scruple to insinuate clothier ey mpathiesarenotwith Germany, that she b3 tray ed important secrets to the enemies of her adopted country, and that she held her husband in absolute subjection Curiously enough at this very time, prior entrench publicists are complaining of the Empress Frederick that her sympathies are intensely German, and that she lSBtriung in concert with her son, to bring about an Anglo German alliance A vigorously written essay on " Realism and Decadence in French 1 action ' is evidently the work of a thorough muster of Liaaubject. All the modern writers of this class of literature are passed in review, and the conclusion arrived at is that there is not one just man amongst them in that "city of the plain Pans ' Realism- peSBimnsui , pessimism realism , the pendulum swings to and fro, always describing the same hope less curve, in this literature of an exhausted race, the life blood of which seems corrupted in its veins . A putrescent civilisation, a corruption of high and low, a cynic is ahameleBBiiess meet us, at every turn, from the photographs which in sult modesty in the shop windows on the Boulevards, and the pornographic literature on the bookstalls, to the multiplication of divorces and the 'drama of adultery accepted as a social ordinance The civilising bond of the moral law has burst asunder in France, and the whole beast nature it kept in check is stripping itself of its last bit reds of decency that it may go about naked and not ashamed " Shakspearean ghosts, witches, and fairies, constitute the theme of an elaborate disquisition Its fundamental proposition is that the dramatist, " like every other true poet, was raised by his poetic inspiration above himself, and was greater than he knew His plots and characters were the creatures of his vision and faculty divine, and not-as some critics have maintained-the result of any merely analytical processes and arrangements The writer does not doubt that Shakspeare, like his contemporaries, believed in ghosts, and also in witches , while the fairies he has introduced into certain of his dramas were simply the inhabitants of that dream land in which his imagination occasionally disported itself. A paper on the Acropolis of Athens is a scholarly production, and acquaints us with the somewhat remarkable results of the excavations of late years on that famous site , excavations which are enriching the Athenian and provincial museums, and promise to render Greece what it was in the days of! Tansanias, " the most glorious storehouse in the world of the sculpture of the only nation which ever really understood sculpture ' Rather more than ten years ago the Qxarlerlu startled its readers by a description of the literary garbage which then formed the mental sustenance of the lowest sections of the British population Today it returns to the subject and examines the character of the Penny Fiction which circulates by hundreds of thousands in the mother country week after week from one factory of the literature of rascal dom, no fewer than 15 pernicious publications are issued These are mainly devoted to the glories cation of vice and crime Some of them are written by men who are capable of better things Broken down university men, clergymen who have been unfrocked and ex schoolmasters are engaged in the manufacture of the trash, as also reporters compositors, and hangers on of the newspaper presS Nor can the shabby, vulgar, and vicious prints which emanate from the purlieus of Drury Lane be driven out of the market except by the efforts of the publishers of wholesome literature, and it is some consolation to learn that the sixpenny edition of Charles Kingsley's II equal Zoo' has already sold to the extent of 100 000 copies, and that the demand for it still continues But are such books bought by those who spend their weekly pennies on S/n turn heeled Jad, (Sweeny Todd, Cheeky Charlie ? Mr. John Morley's epitomised biography of Sir Robert Walpole furnishes a peg upon which to hang an able dissertation on his character as a statesman and on his political career, which is made to point a moral, namely, that the formation of a national party, which implies personal government in some shape, is no more likely to succeed in the days of Queen Victoria than in those of George the Second On the contrary, it is asserted that party organisa- tion, party divisions, and party sympathies and traditions are all stronger instead of weaker than they were in the middle of the last century Remembering the ridicule and opprobrium heaped upon Mesmer during his lifetime, it is amusing to find a scientific essayist in the Quartet I j concluding a discussion of the mysterious phenomena of hypnotism, see, by stating that "the only theory which attempts to go to the root of the matter is Mesmer's own, and it may be that some day, when our knowledge is extended, that theory, though couched in the vague and fanciful language of the last century, will be found to contain the germ of the true idea ' A caustic exposure of the infamous results of 20 years of Irish Home Rule in New York, reveals a state of things which is by no means new to habitual readers of the daily news papers published in that city, but will have the effect of confirming British unionists in their determined opposition to a transfer of such enormous evils, involving fraud, corruption, wholesale robbery, and wanton murder, to Ireland In the Fdmhmgh Review we have an in teresting digest of the contents of two Bump tuous volumes edited by Sir William Fraser and privately printed relating the story of a Scottish family-the Earls of Haddington as told for the most part in public or private documents The narrative covers a period of three centuries, and it incidentally throws a good deal of light upon the history of Scot- land during that period A review of the Journal of Marie Bashlertsef is preceded by an apt comparison between the writer of it and Eugenie de Guerre who also confined to her diary not only the details of her daily life and the portraits of her family, but also her studies and amusements, hopes and fears, loves, hates and aspirations A compendious account is given in the next article of the progress which is being made by Japan in adopting the learning, science, and arts of Europe Many people doubt whether this is progress , but one point appears to be pretty clear, and that is that the administration of justice h IIB been immensely improved, and that all the corruptions and impurities which formerly disgraced it have been abolished Unfortunately, Japan has borrowed from the nations of Western Europe the art of concocting bubble companies and of booming shares, and the result has been the creation of financial difficulties which the Government has endeavoured to mitigate by the questionable expedient of expanding its issues of paper money The publication in Paris of the first life of the great chemist Lavoisier worthy of the name of a biography is taken advantage of by a reviewer to present an acceptable sketch of the career and achievements of one who was not only a man of supreme scientific genius but "an indefatigable philanthropist, ' a political economist second to none of his time, a reformer whose zeal, unalloyed by personal ambition, was animated only by an earnest compassion for the ills affecting his fellow countryman " And, having been one of the benefactors of his nation and his race, he met with his reward "At the age of 60, in the plenitude of his splendid faculties, his mind teeming with unfulfilled discoveries," Lavoisier was conducted to the scaffold and guillotined I A disquisition on the origin of alphabets, based upon the latest information on the subject obtained by researches in Chaki ei, Persia, China, and other Asiatic countries, falls to show, by the concurrent testimony of independent scholars, working on separate lines of study, that all the known graphic systems origin etc in a picture writing IIB rude as that of our own aborigines, that from the picture they proceeded t J the hieroglyphic representation of a word, and from the hieroglyph to the syllabary, of which the alphabet naB a simplification introduced by the more civilised of the ancient nations It was not until somewhere about the year 1000 D o that the merchants of Phoenicia succeeded in producing an alphabet, consisting of 22 letters, the use of which spread rapidly over Greece, Asia Minor, and Palestine, and extended as far westward as Numidia and the Canary Islands "MontchriBticn the First French Economist," is the title of an essay upon a treatise of which he was the author, published as far back as their, mid anticipating some at least, of the principles laid down by Adam Smith, while it is interesting to note that Montchristien " was the first of those Frenchmen who derived enthusiasm for liberty from the air of England," whither he has fled to escape hanging for having killed an enemy in a duel. He was an advocate of free trade under conditions of reciprocity, was opposed to monopolies, recommended the foundation of industrial schools, insisted upon a pure coinage, and argued that the real wealth of a nation consists, not is an abundance of the precious metals, but in the quantity of the necessaries and luxuries of life which it is capable of purchasing In the next article, on religious persecution in Russia, a scathing exposure is made of the atrociously intolerant spirit of the national church in that country, an establishment which is described as " the mast centralised and absolute Creiaro Papacy in the world, and just as subjected to the civil power as the latter was subjected to the church in the theocracy of the former Ponti fiscal State The autocrat C'sr, in whose person all civil power is concentrated, by his coronation at the Kremlin, the national sanctuary, is the supreme lord of orthodoxy." And any departure from it on the part of his subject is treated as a crime which must be summarily and mercilessly stamped out, the result being that "a Government which claims to be a Christian one, persecutes millions of its subjects in a way unheard of in any civilised empire" A charming paper on "Birds in Great Britain " by an enthusiastic ornithologist, is calculated to induce many persons to take up the study of the modes of life, the homes, affections, structure, powers, and varied beauties of these interesting creatures, so many of whom are the useful allies, while others are the delightful companions, of mankind What a field presents itself on this continent for someone who would give us a book like the Bird Life of Dr Brchm, or the OrmtholojiePass circle of A. Toussenel A review of the latest French biography of the Prince de Ligne sets his character in a very attractive light, and exhibits that "man of many nations "OB a unique example of what can be brought about by a curious assemblage of intellectual and personal effects The official narrative of the Soudan campaign, compiled by Colonel Colville, under direction of the War Office, is carefully analysed by a military expert, who does not conceal the magnitude of the toil and flncrificeentailedbytlmt campaign, nor the coin closeness of the failure and the final tragedy, while doing justice to the unconquerable determination of the British soldiery, and the serene courage of the hero of Khartoum. The political article deals with the deplorable successes of the party of obstruction in the House of Commons during the past session, and remarks that in the face of such tactics "it will require in the future the hearty co-operation of our ablest and most trusted statesmen to indicate and re-establish the fundamental principle upon which parliamentary government is based. It is out of the question that the representatives of the people should long Buffer their wishes to be despised and their authority to be set at naught The Chief Secretary for Ireland contributes to the North American Review a crushing reply to Mr Parnell's article in the previous number of that publication That gentleman's objections to the Government proposals for facilitating land purchase in Ireland are dealt with the taHni, and he is told that his own scheme of dealing with the Treasury advances is nothing more nor less than an ingeniously devised method of depriving the landlord of all property in the Soil he owns beyond the prairie value. Mr Parnell is reminded that not one of the projects of law brought forward by the Nationalist party has touched the subject of land purchase, or has offered, or pretended to offer any solution, however inadequate, of the economic and social problems which press for solution in the congested dis trade " But as Mr. Farnell and his friends have entered into a conspiracy to impoverish and expel the Irish landlords from the country, they naturally " view with undisguised hostility a measure wind, in exact proportion as it is successful, must deprive them of their chief instrument for carrying out their avowed intention of making the government of Ireland impossible " Mr E T Gerry, president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, inveighs with a good deal of exaggeration of statement and vehemence of language against their employ meet on the stage, and asserts that but for the humane provisions of the law these child - slaves of the stage would be subjected to a bondage more terrible and oppressive than the children of Israel ever endured at the hands of Pharaoh, or the descendants of Ham have ever experienced in the way of African slavery " As for the American newspapers, they are accused of being in league with the theatrical slave drivers by whom they are placated through the medium of plentiful advertising We should think Mr Berry is likely to hear from some of the New York papers before long Miss or Mrs Mona Caird is still harping on the emancipa- tion of the family, which is only to be accomplished, in her opinion, by the granting of equal political, social, and domestic rights to the two sexes by the economic independence of women, and the establishment, rapid or gradual as may prove desirable, of free marriage Sir Charles Dilke replies to the American critics, as he has done in our columns to the Australian critics, of his latest book', and, speaking of the aspect of foreign affairs, he says that never, to his mind, in our time has there seemed less chance of the outbreak of a general war than during those three or four last years in which it has been continually prophesied by a portion of the press 'the only cloud upon the horizon is the possibility that Russia, with her extraordinarily able diplomacy, " may one day succeed in replacing the alliance of Germany with Austria by an alliance of Germany and Russia, leaving Russia free to attack Austria, with a view to the ultimate completion of German unity by the absorption of the German provinces of Austria into the German Empire and in this ultimate danger lies the greatest of those which will menace European peace " Mr. Andrew Carnegie writes what he calls, with an amusing per version of language, a Summing Up of the tariff Discussion " which has been carried on in the pages of this Review It is much as if the counsel for the prisoner at the bar should take his seat on the Bench, assume the judicial ermine, and charge the jury to acquit his client Mr Carnegie has amassed a colossal fortune as an American manufacturer, privileged to levy a special tax upon his sixty millions of country- men, and he has naturally nothing but good to say of the fiscal system which has enriched him. The only other noticeable contribution to the present number is Mr. Justin McCarthy's eulogy of the Prince of Wales, whose great popularity he considers to have been well earned, and who, he has not the slightest doubt, " will prove himself a the roughly constitutional sovereign, and will perform the business of royalty, such as it in, as well as any man could do it . So long as we are to have an heir to the throne," adds Mr. M'Carthy, " I do not think we could find anyone better able to conduct the business of the position than the Prince of Wales has shown himself of late years."
