A GHOST'S VENGEANCE. 1¥e Cock-lane ghost is a very famous one, perhaps chiefly from the fact that old . Samuel Johnson was largely concerned in it. Here is the story in brief. In 1756 Mr." K., of Norfolk, married Miss E. L. In less than a year the wife died, and her sister Fanny came to keep house. Fanny and Mr. X. were married after a while, though at first Mr. K., not liking the match, rani away from his ardent sister-in-law. After their marriage they went to live in Cock lane, in the house1 of Mr. Parsons; clerk of St. .Sepulchre's. During Mr. K.'s. absence little Elizabeth Parsons, the larid-t lord's1 daughter, slept- with Mrs^ K. Both; of- them "were . disturbed byt. strange scratchings ' and rappings". /'Me, Jan:lV lord's wife thought: the'cobbler "next .door was at1 the bottom-.of- it.- Having V quar relled with -Parsons," Mr. K. and his wife". Fanny went to live in Clerkenweli,/ where she died of smallpox,1 as the physician ^and apothecary testified.. 'After 18 month's (why .was the ghost silent so' long?) the noises in the Cock-lane house began again. ' ; ■ . - • A:girl who was attending the medium-^ Mary. Frazer ' was' her name—suggested that-the ghost should be talked until by. iheans1 of, raps, one .rap meaning "yes," two "no.". Shrewd-girl that Mary Frazer.. The'ghost rapped out its message. .Fanny had, been"' poisoned by Mr. "K. with "red arsenic in a draught; of purl, for. which Fanny,: it; appeared, had'a liking. 'JLhe'vin? dictive ghost 'added that it—we mean she —wished to'see K. hanged. Then followed • public, examinations of the child, at which Dr. Johnson, among other celebrities, was present; and the end of it was that Par sons,; Mary Frazer, and several . others were tried at the Guildhall and convicted of a'conspiracy on July 10, 1702.
