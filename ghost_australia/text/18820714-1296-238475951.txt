THE ARMAMENT OF SHIPS AND FORTS. TO THE EDITOR OK THE SYDNEY DAILY TELEGRAPH. Sir,— Seeing that war has begun again, and for tho present ironclads," so- called," against forts, will you permit me to state that both are mere "duffers." They should bo mado on the principle of "buffers," which I invented as far back aB Her Majesty's first visit to Scotland (between 1810 and 18IG), oir \Yiiiiaui uruiatruug, u uitwuii.ii, ur n-tupp, might just as well blow peas through n tube, in the full expectation of penetrating nn elephant's hide, as to send their projectiles through a "buffer" armament. But tbc British, for many years back, wait until they sec what others do. I hope for the honour of the land of my birth, that if complications arise and wc have to fight an enemy, not a ghost like Egypt, that we shall not have a repetition of the wondrous Warrior and Black Prince of " supposed " invulnerable properties, contrasted with two com paratively washing tabs, only encased in armour, the Merriinac and Monitor, oithcr of which cost little, and could have played with those enormously expen sive vessels referred to. Our toy defences nuiusc me. Even when at Plymouth, some 12 years ago, just as the very heavy guns were being mounted, I spoke to the master gunner on the above subject. He was at one with me, and so have many others skilled in the art of war ; but as " things" as a rulo work inciclcs, my idea must bide its time, just ns my invention of tbo atmospheric engine had to do, which cost me over £1000 to mature, and all for others. — Yours, Ac., JAMES H.
