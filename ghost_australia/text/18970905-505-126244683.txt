AN APPALLING INVENTION. We have been favored with a picture of an appalling invention — literally 'made in Germany' — having for its object the pre vention of premature burial (reports the London Chronicle). The machine is well calculated to add a new terror to the grave yard. It works on the slightest movement in the buried coffin, so that a passing van, or still more, a moving train, may by the oscillation it sets up cause the dread thing to work. And what happens is this : An iron box springs open ; a black flag flies wildly upright, a bell clangs, and the glare of an electric lamp lightens the countryside. We can conceive nothing more trying to the nerves of. the living than the consciousness that these dread engines are scattered promiscuously over the churchyards of the land. We aro not afraid of ghosts, but we frankly confess that we would not pass hy a church at night if we thought tiiat one of these terrors was nigh. Statistics show that in Antwerp alone neatly 4000 horseB wero slaughtered last year for ' human consumption, and tho number of shops dealing exoluBively in horseflesh in the Belgian ports exceeds thirty.
