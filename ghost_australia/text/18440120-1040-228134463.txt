PORT PHILLIP. Mr. Clarke, professor of Music, is making an effort to introduce the Wilhelm system of tuition in Singing, which, under the name of " Singing for the Million," has of late years attracted a large share of public attention in the mother country. The honourable R. Dundas Murray has announced for publication a new work to be called " A Summer at Port Phillip ; includ- ing the latest information regarding that Colony." The Melbourne Times gave up the ghost with the close of the year, and a new paper has been started, entitled the Melbourne Weekly Courier, which gives a fair abridg- ment of the news of the week.
