Many of them do. in the west ; but the greater part are in Spain. You may see my western possessions any evening at sunset, when their spires and battlements flash against the horizon. It gives me a feeling of pardonable importance, as a proprietor, that they are visible, to my eyes at least, from any part of the world in which I chance to be in my long voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India the only voyage 1 over made when I was a boy and a supercargo), if I fell homesick, or sank into a reverie of all the pleasant homes I had left behind, I had but to wait until sunset, and then looking toward the west, I beheld my clustering pinnacles and towers brightly burnished as if to salute and welcome me. So, in the city, ii I get vexed and wearied, and cannot find my wonted solace in sallying forth at dinner-time to contemplate the gay world of youth and beauty hurrying to the congress of fashion, or if I observe that years are deepening their tracks around the eyes of my wife Pine, I go quietly up to the housetop, toward evening, and refresh myself with a distant prospect of my estates. It is as dear to me as that of Eton to the poet Gray ; and, if I sometimes wonder at such moments whether I shall find those realms as fair as they appear, I am suddenly reminded that the night-air may be noxious, and, descending, I enter the little parlor where Pruo sits stitching, and surprise that precious woman by exclaiming, with the poet's pensive enthusiasm, Thought would destroy their PAKIUIK, No more whose ignorance is the;?, "THE folly to be wise. . Columbus, also had possessions in the west and as I read aloud the romantic story of his life, my voice quivers when I come to the point in which it is related that sweet odours of the land mingled with the seasons, as the admiral's fleet approached the shores that tropical birds flew out and fluttered around the ships, glitter- ing in the sun, the gorgeous promises of the new country that boughs, perhaps with blossoms not all decayed, floated out to welcome the strange wood from which the craft were hol- lowed. Then I cannot restrain myself. I think of the gorgeous visions I have seen before I have even undertaken the journey to the west, and I cry aloud to Prue, " What sun-bright birds, and gorgeous blossoms, and celestial odors will float out to us, my Pruo, as we approach our western possessions !" The placid Prue raises her eyes to mine with a reproof so delicate that it could not be trusted to words and after a moment, she resumes her knitting, and I proceed. J. These are my western estates, but my finest castles are in Spain. It is a country famously romantic, and my castles are all of perfect pro- portions, and appropriately set in the most picturesque situations. I have never been to Spain myself, but I have naturally conversed much with travellers to that country ; although, I must allow, without deriving from them much substantial information about my property there. The wisest of them told me that there were more holders of real estate in Spain than in any other region he had ever heard of, and they are all great proprietors. Every one of them possesses a multitude of the stateliest castles. From conversation with them you easily gather that each one considers his own castles much the largest and in the loveliest positions. And, after I had heard this said, I verified it, by discovering that all my immediate neighbors in the city were great Spanish proprietors. One day as I raised my head from entering some long and tedious accounts in my books, and began to reflect that the quarter was expir- ing, and that I must begin to prepare the balance-sheet, I observed my subordinate in office, but not in years, (for poor old Titbuttom will never see sixty again !) leaning on his hand, and much abuse acted. " Are you not well, Titbottom ?" asked I. " Perfectly, but I was just building a castle in Spain, said he. I looked at his rusty coat, his faded hands, Elia and eye, and white hair for a moment, in great surprise, and then enquired, " Is it possible that you own property there too ?" He shook his head silently and still leaning on his hand, and with an expression in his eye as if he were looking upon the most fertile estate of Andalusia, he went on making his plans ยก laying out his gardens, I suppose, building terraces for the vines, determining a library with a southern exposure, and resolving which should be the tapestried chamber. "What a singular whim," thought I, as I watched Titbottom, and filled up a check for four hundred dollar!), niyquavteily salary, "that a man who owns castles in Spain should be deputy book-keeper at nine hundred dollars a year !" When I went home Late my dinner silently, and afterwards sat for a long time upon the roof of the house, looking at thy western property, and thinking of Titbottom. It is remarkable that none of the proprietors have ever been to Spain to take possession and report to the rest of us the state of our property there. I, of course, cannot go, I am too much engaged. So is Titbottom. And I find it is the case with all the proprietors. We have so much to detain us at home that we cannot get away. But it is always so with rich men. i Prue sighed once as she sat at the window and saw Bourne, the millionaire, the president of innumerable companies, and manager and director of all the charitable societies in town, going by with wrinkled brow and hurried stop. I asked her why she sighed. '? Became I was remembering that my mother used to tell me not to desire great riches, for they occasioned great cases." said she. i " They do indeed," answered I, with emphasis, remembering Titbottom, and the impossibility of looking after my Spanish estates. * Prue turned and > looked at me with mild surprise ; but I saw that her mind had gone down the street with Bourne I could never discover if he hold much Spanish stock. But I think be does. All the Spanish proprietors have a certain expression. Buunie has it to a remarkable degree. It is a kind of look, as if, in fact, a man's mind were in Spain. Bourne was an old lover of Prue'?, and he is not married, which is strange for a man in his position. It is not easy, for me to say how I know so much, as I certainly do, about my castles in Spain. The sun always shines upon them. They stand lofty and fair in it luminous, golden atmosphere; a little hazy and' dreamy, perhaps, like the "Indian summer, but in which no gales blow and there are no tempests. All the sublime mountains, and beautiful valleys, and soft landscape, that I have not yet seen, are to be found in the grounds. They command a noble view of the Alps ; so fine indeed, that I should be quite content with the prospect of them from the highest tower of my castle, and not care to go to Switzerland. The neighboring ruins, too, are as picturesque as those of Italy, and my desire of standing in the Coliseum, and of seeing the shattered arches of the Aqueducts stretching along the Campagna and melting into the Alban Mount, is entirely quenched. The rich gloom of my orange groves is gilded by fruit as brilliant of complexion and exquisite of flavor as any that ever dark-eyed Sorrento girls, looking over the high plastered walls of Southern Italy, hand to the youthful travellers, climbing on donkeys up the narrow lane beneath. The Nile flows through my grounds. The Desert lies upon their edge, and Damascus stands in my garden. I am given to understand, also, "that the Parthenon has been removed to my Spanish possessions. The Golden Horn is my fish-preserve ; my flocks of golden fleece are pastured on the plain of Marathon, and the honey of Hymettus is distilled from the flowers that grow in the vale of Brassall in my Spanish domains. From the windows of those castles look the beautiful women whom I have never seen, whose portraits the poets have painted. They wait for me there, and chiefly the fair-haired child, lost to my eyes so long ago, now bloomed into an impossible beauty. The lights that never shone glance at evening in the vaulted halls, upon banquets that were never spread. The bands I have never collected play all night long, and enchant the brilliant company, that never was assembled, into silence. In the long summer mornings the children that I never had, play in the gardens that I never planted I hear their sweet voices sounding low and far away, calling, " 1 either father !

' said I, without preface lit looked at me for a few moments without speaking, and without seeming to see me His brow gradually smoothed, and his eyes, apparently looking into the street, west really, I have no doubt, feasting upon the Spanish landscape "Too many, too many," said he at length, amusingly shaking his head, and without address- ing me I suppose he felt himself too much extended, as we say in Wall street He feared, I thought, that he had too much impracticable property elsewhere, to own so much in Spain , so I asked, "Will you tell me what you consider the shortest and safest route thither, Mr Bourne ? For, of course, a man who drives such an immense trade with all parts of the world, will know all that I have come to enquire " "My dear sir, answered lie, wearily, "I have been trying all my life to discover it, but none of my ships have ever been there, none of my captains like any it point to make they bring me, us they brought my father, gold dust from Guinea, mr) piculs, and precious st mes from every part of the earth, but not ft if, not a solitary flower, from one of my castles in Spain I have sent clerks, agents, and to a sale] s of all kinds, philosophers, pleasure limits, are invalid-,, in all sorts of ships, to all sorts of places, but none of them ever saw or heard of my castles, except one young poet, and he died in a mad house " Mr. Bourne, will j in like five thousand at ninety ser en? hastily demanded a man, whom is he entered, I recognised as a stoker " We make a splendid thing of it Bourne nodded assent, and the broken d13 appeared "Happy man. muttered the merchant, is the he ever went out, "he has no castles in Spain ' "I am sorry to have troubled you, Mr Bourne," said I, curing "I am glad you came,' returned he " but I assure you, had I know the route you hoped to ascertain from me, I should have sailed in 1rs and years ago People sail for the North west Passage, which is nothing when you have found it Why don't the English Admiralty fit out expeditions to discover all our castles in Spain" He sat lost in thought " Its nearly post time, sir," said the clerk Mr Bourne did not heed him He was still musing and I turned to go, wishing him good 11101 ning When I had nearly reached the door he called me back, say tug, as if continuing his remarks, "It is strange that you, of all men, should come to ask me this question If I cm j any man, it is you, for I sincerely assure you that I suppose you lived altogether upon your Spanish estates I once thought I knew the way to mine I gave directions for furnishing them, and ordered bridal bouquets, which were never used, but I suppose they are there still ' He paused a moment, then said slowly, " How n your wife?

TIIKJUDOMKNT OF FRIENDS. It is very certain that a man's intimate flies 's are often the last to suspect his possession of unusual abilities. This is a trite observation, but one is constantly being surprised at some now proof of its truth. It was not long ago that a gentleman told us that he did not believe a certain celebrated poet had any real genius, because he once lived in the same town with him, and know that his family were no better than they should be. He had never read any of his books, however. It was the old story over again. " He a great man ! Noiisoiiso ! I know him when he was only that high !"-Seribncr's Monthly. THE INVENTION OF GuNroiVDEn.-That Roger Bacon know, invented, and made the discovery of gunpowder is beyond all question, as he tells us that " thunder and lightning may be produced by air; for that sulphur, nitro, and charcoal, which when separate have no sensible effect, which mixed together in due proportion, and closely compressed and fired, yield a entrepot." A more exact and precise description of gunpowder cannot be given in words ; yet fifty-six years after the time of bacon, the discovery was assigned to Bert hold Schwartz, an Augustinian, who resided at Friburg, in Bringan, twenty-six miles south of Strasburg. This monk, says Sainte Fois, having put a composition of sulphur and saltpetre in it mortar, it took; fire and blew off the stone which covered it with great violence, which led the chemist to think it might be used with great advantage in attacking fortified places. He accordingly added to it a quantity of charcoal, to render it more apt to take fire, and to continue it. Thus, adds our author, the French worn long in possession of this terrible secret, but it was left to the " ferocious Jumper" of the English to make use of it (I), as they did with such signal success at the battle of of Cressy, thus awkwardly admitting that the English were in possession of the secret also.-" The Technical Education" for February. CuNO iNi; ron IUONCLADS.-Not because of the sex attributed to armoured in common with all other ships, but for the same reason for which, according to the learned Knickerbocker, the maidens of Manhattan enveloped their ample figures in manifold packets, it is proposed (Iron reports) to oned clo our ironclads with a network of iron wire, supported by booms at a distance of 22 feet, and kept rigid to below the depth of the keel by heavy weights. The danger to be guarded against is the fish torpedo, one species of which can be unerringly propelled under water a distance of a mile, and if it then strikes the ship beneath her water-line silo must inevitably sink for it is understood that all the pumps on board a turret ship, working at their highest pressure, would be incapable of discharging the water which would be admitted through a hole no larger than that made in The Vanguard by the prow of the lion Dulce. An experiment with this nothing is about to be made on the Thun- derer the most costly of all iniiichids-and There is just a chance that, notwithstanding the crinoline, she may be sent to join what 'has been called our submarine fleet. The Whitehead torpedo appears to be a most effective implement of destruction ; indeed, it would seem that there is no end to the " pot is that environs" ironclads. BUIUHNH OF ETON Cw.r.oi'.-Tho foundation stone of the college was undoubtedly laid by the King himself below the future site of the high altar, but little progress was made with the new church during the first four years of the work. The building accounts of John Hampton, surveyor of the work, have been preserved among the muniments at Eton, his Jornale anno prime commencing on the 3rd July, hill. The King hall already directed the Lord Chancellor to issue letters to the master mason, authorising him " to take," or Empress, " as many masons, where so ever they be (sounded, as may be thought necessary." The number of workmen varied considerably in different weeks, but the wages were settled on a regular scale. All the skilled men received three shillings a week a place ; except that the sawyers, carpenters, find ordinary masons only received half-a-crown in those numerous weeks which contained holydays ; while the free- masons received their entire wagesiftospectivoof Saillis' days and anniversaries. The common laborers were paid at the rate of 6d. a day. These wages are rather lower than some paid elsewhere at the usual dale ; but, on the other hand, no reduction was made in the winter, when the hours for work were of course shorter. The workmen at Eton, were, moreover, supplied with tools, as appears from fines imposed on some of their number, for breaking of a tray, for by eking a scope," for braking of a shovel." Like workmen of our own time, They used to dine in the middle of the day, ยกiiidthcyivcroflucdifnot back at work again " at one of clocks." A whole batch of men forfeited a day's wages on one occasion because " they would not go to their work till two of clock J" and others got into trouble for "late evening." A modern trade union would probably support I a member who was fined merely because " he would keep his cures, and to go to work till the clock says." Even one of the freemasons lost half a day's pay for going away without leave. The men were under strict supervision during working hours, and fines were imposed on such us were found " feeling," or who "wrestled well played, and ron about in working time." The paymaster naturally raised objections to a man who " wot not do nor labour but as his list thyself," or who " will not do if he is better." The fine "forbidding Time" was and that " for looking about," " for playing," or for chiding," 2d. The overseer was also severe upon one who "would tell tales;", and another who insisted on telling tailors and " ( letting his fellowes." of oratory of Eton College by U. 0. Maxwell late, U.A. THE Rev. Mr. Beecher IUIB recently become embroiled in another scandal, one Bowen, a Deacon of Plymouth Church, appears to be his accuser, and judging from the following extract, from an American paper, the Deacon is not likely to have what his countrymen call "a good time", over the business. The imperturbable Bowen, after having for months racked and tortured the Brooklynites by the simple expedient of minding his own business and keeping his own counsel, has at last been baited and exasperated into making a clean breast of a very nasty subject. This was perhaps pardonable, but scarcely wise. The i vault has been to sweep away at one blow , the saving foundation Beecher had built (for him self out of the partisanship of his congregation, and to plunge the country once more into nauseated endurance of the ungrateful orders of this social cesspool. But it has also brought down upon the devoted head of Bovveu the united malediction and defamation of every individual member of the Plymouth Company, The result is as inevitable as it is simple. To-morrow's slow declining sun will hardly hide his disgusted face , beneath the horizon before the nervous ramifica- tions of the telegraph will flush to the uttermost ends of the afflicted each the first instalment of concerted abuse that will make that rash man's life a burden to him for the next six months. Day after to- morrow the Associated Press will artlessly and regretfully convoy the information that Mr. Bowen has one or more superfluous wives in distant localities. The impression will be gradually inculcated in the mind of the newspaper reader that he is a thief. Gradually his character will become merged into that of a blackleg and a swindler. A dark suspicion will be hinted that he has a weakness for other people's horses. A doubt as to his exact legal relation to Mrs. Bowen will be hazarded. A seducer and the three-card monte man will be held up as comparatively virtuous examples for his imitation. And finally, at the expiration of the requisite six months, there will be an unchangeable public conviction that Judas Iscariot was a martyr and Nero a persecuted saint beside this hapless dear- son of the Plymouth Rock upon which the great preacher has split. Such is (an !
