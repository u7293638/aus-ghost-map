Jims. LANSELL'S HOME AND SOMETHING ABOUT HER. Tho"Jorsoy Lily," although transplanted from her native soil, and existing in a somewhat artificial atmosphere, still seems to thrive, in spite of the withdrawal of that majestic patronage which cast such a li do round her in her bloom It is a lamentable fact, but true nevertheless, that even It lyal personages are human and will tire sometimes when they got too much accustomed to the propinquity of one face, however, sweet, so now the lily, and of the rose, is blooming alone, perhaps not altogether friendless, but still somewhat alone And what sort of soil is it that grows such flowers as those and perhaps is still growing them Surely a fertile Ohio, and rich with the wealth which Nature showers upon her favoured scenes , a little island-you could walk across it in a day-which Nairne made in one of her holiday moods As you approach it by steamer it presents its most picturesque side to the tourist, and seems to invite him to feast his eyes upon its charms In front a wide sweep big bay with yellow sands and white villas peeping from amidst bright green foliage on the right an old gray fort, standing like a sentinel above the town, and guarding, with a bristling row of guns, the approach by sea on the left and at the other side of the bay a rocky promontory. Norman Point, j utting out into the water, and beneath the old fort, lying coiled around its base, the quaint old-fashioned little town with its suburbs running out into the green wood lands-with its houses and thou Venetian shutters shining white and green in the strong warm sunshine Surely when Nature made the scene she intended it for a birthplace of beauty, ands caused the daughter of its soil to wear the unmistakable stamp of the place Mrs Langtry was a Le Breton, and has the old Norman blood in her veins The old Dean, her father, was a grand old man, with the old fashioned courtly manner A handsome man, with his stout upright figure, strong features, and snow white hair, an eloquent preacher, hour the old town church with the mellow richness of his voice, but somewhat broken down by family misfortunes In later years his eloquence somewhat deserted him, and he wandered off occasionally into English history, which rather bewildered his hearers Mrs Langtry's mother had been beautiful in her youth, and even retarded a considerable portion of her good looks in her age. To walk behind her in the sheet you would think her a woman of 30 with a good figure, but when you met her face to face you changed your opinion The Dean and his better half did not get on well together (so society said), and chose to live apart for a short time, but one day when the Dean was away his wife returned, took possession of the house, and retained it Perhaps it was to her mother that Mrs Langtry owed a good deal of her success she nursed her ambition and fanned the spark into a 11 imo A E old lot were the sons, handsome and devil may care When a well known prize fighter visited the island on the occasion of some places it was a Lo Bicton who put on the gloves with him and knocked him over the ropes in the first round It was a Lo Bicton, too, who dressed himself up as a ghost with sheet, skull, and a pair of spring heels, and kept the whole place in a state of alarm and anxiety for upwards of a fortnight Terrified old women, alarmed by a white figure which sprang from the top of one wall into the road and over the other side, had hysterics The local papers teemed with paragraphs as to the localities in vi Inch the apparition was last seen, and weary and aged policemen tumbled over, and narrowly escaped shooting, one another in the search That the culprit was shot at and after winds apprehended wusbobevod, as after a while the ghost was no more heard of but policeman are but men, and a sovereign or two judiciously administered goes a long way with them that Mrs L uigtry is a beautiful woman there is no doubt what you would call a remarkably fine woman but perhaps in her of aspiration of manner lay her chief charm Very low men could avoid falling in love with her if she chose to make herself agreeable to them I would describe her, but alas ' who can paint the lily On her return from her grand London triumph she went in for rusticity and lived at a little hamlet at the opposite side of the bay, and drove about in a little talent, with her back hair down One rather good story is told of her about this time Attired and disguised in a pi juant washerwoman s costume she is out about the hamlet selling fish in an in teas manned with a gentleman friend, also disguised, a hundred yards or so in the rear Unfortunately, a republican grocer, with a gift for seeing through disguises approached, with an evident desire to purchase fish So pleased was he with both ARD. and fiBherwomon that he clasped the latter to his breast and pressed a large pair of hon upon her cheek Her cheek then deserted him, for he fled before any wrathful protectors could arrive on the scene There were no more washerwomen seen in the hamlet after that, no doubt much to the disappointment of a republican grocer Society says Mrs Langtry is vain she is also beautiful farm is a miralem all is vanity CrrniSTOPinJS.
