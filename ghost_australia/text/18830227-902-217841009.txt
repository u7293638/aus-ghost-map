PIGEON MATCH. Owing to the inclement weather on Wednes- day, the pigeon match which was to have been shot off on that day was postponed till Friday, when the elements being more favourable a fair sprinkling of spectators were present on the course to witness the match. A suitable place having been selected and the traps (three in number) fixed, shooting commenced at 1 o'clock. Out of 26 handicapped, 13 knights of the trigger signified their intention to test Iheir prowess, and among these were some of the best shots in the Northern dislricts. The shoot ing on the whole was very fair indeed, but probably would have been better had the birds flown more freely on the trap being pulled. The match was shot under the Sydney Gun Club Rules, and the conditions were: — A prize of £50 with a sweep oE 10s. each added, seven birds both barrels ; charge l£oz. ; first man, 65 per cent., 2ud, 25 ; third, 10. W. Bowd, Vege table Creek, 26 yards, II. Chalker, Gretna, 29 yards, shot all their birds, and thus tied for first and second honors, and consented to di vide. For third money there were two equals — runnel)', A. Stout, Nana Greek, and W. Scott, Glen Innes. This pair shot off, and Scott miss ing his third bird, Stout was declared the winner. The Committee carried' out the ar rangements in a praiseworthy manner, and Dir. P. Kinsella'b decisions as umpire gave general satisfaction. Betting was fairly brisk, and good odds were offered generally against the bird. The following are the scores : — Grnney, 29 yards, 1101011 5 Bowd, 26. 1111111 7 Evans, 27.1101110....... 5 Sully, 24, 0011110 4 Scott, 27, 1111011 6 Chalker, 29, 1111111 7 Keenan. 28, 0011000 2 Hughes. 27, 1110001 4 .

One mile heats, took place. The entries were :— H. Green's Ghost, scratch ; W. Ruining's Sambo, 20 yards ; J. Ward's Queen of Hearts, 75 yards; J. Doolin's Maude, 100 yards. This was a very hollow affair, neither of the nags apparently be ing able to trot a yard, although the Ghost and Sambo came with great reputations. Maude won both heats with the greatest of ease, tak ing about ten minutes to do the circle.
