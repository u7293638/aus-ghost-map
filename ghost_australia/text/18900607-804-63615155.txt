BY ORDER OF THE CZAR (Continued from page 27). Driving through, the pleasant streets, and saluted here and there hythe music of evidently social evenings which gave occasional light and merriment to sundry houses en route, they presently came to a quieter part of Verona, lighted only hy the great white moon. They approached the pleasant corner selected for Juliet's apocryphal tomb through a o old-fashioned garden, with patches of green turf and blooming gilliflowers, rows of peas in blossom that rivalled the white Marguerite daisies in the moonlight, and a rich per- fume from beans in flower, and the scent of many herbs. It was a mixed garden of the English kind, that seemed uncon- sciously to lend itself to the Juliet illusion of the English poet.
