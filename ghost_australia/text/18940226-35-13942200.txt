AMUSEMENTS. CRITERION-" CAPTAIN FRITZ." " Captain Fritz," the new Tseco produced at the Criterion Theatre on Saturday, though far from being a one-part play, owed its favourable reception chiefly to the charm with which Mr Charles Arnold invested the principal character This actor has not appeared here for five years, and Saturday's audience in an evidently delighted to renew acquaintance with J an old favourite Mr Arnold has an engaging manner, and the character of Cij it an Fritz, the gallant, gentle frank-lictrtcd Gems an officer, has evidently been written especially for him Doubtless, Mr Henry Hamilton, the experienced author of " Mother " and " Harvey it," was confronted.! with certain difficulties in executing this commission Mr Arnold's refined high-coined 7 anting had to be given free play, and then, as if fe sang the general public should find the piece too to me, the resources of " drawing-room melodrama," and even of farce, were laid under contribution Hence "Captain Fritz" does not form a homogeneous whole-an [aesthetic consideration which weighs Ettie with an audience content to " take the good the, gods provide them " without question so long as it is good And, as a whole, " Captain Fritz is ama ring, and! even stimulating The smart lines are in ray, the acting is excellent and thou oh some of the Â«Ctinos*haso a slightly old-fashioned lins our, they are unbViuablj dr to the General Hnnilev, whose death has but lately been recorded I, wrote his naval, Lady Leigh's Widowhood,'" Roma 10 years ago when it first appeared in Rlae/niood'n MaqimHf It was not to be expected that such a good subject for stage purposes could escape dramatisation until now. Mr Hamilton's version has been long preceded by the late Letter Wallach's adaptation, produced many years ago in New York. But, as has been indicated from the nature of the case " Captain Fritz " is on murder less original hues The play leaves a pleasant impression, the interpolated song appear to form an essential part of the action instead of being " dragged in by the head and shoulders, there were many encores, and Mrs Arnold's " first night "wins night of enthusiasm. In brief' terms the plot may be- outlined as re ferring to the machinations of Colonel Vereker towards securing succession to the family estates As he remarks Intnsolf, however, " two beastly healthy lives " stand between him and the old manor There is the young and widowed Lady Vereker, and her son, the value baronet Now, Lstdy Vereker en- courages the. settlement on the outskirts of her property of a tribe of gipsies, for the feminine and all sufficient reason that they "look so picturesque " One of them, Simeon Lake, the putative son of a former steward of the estate, hangs about the park, temples and it suits Lady Vereker, and is struck down by Captain Franz von Holstein for his insolence Then he suggests to Colonel Vereker, who has been haughtily rebuked by his wealthy sister-in-law a scheme of! mutual revenge Simeon will carry off Little H E Geoffrey, and make it appear that he has been a yawned in the black pool in the wood. The child will then be removed for ever from Colonel Vereker pan, by a tribe of foreign gipsies This is done, and the bereaved mother behoves her darling drowned. But Captain Fritz deems otherwise Disguised as an old Jew pedlar he penetrates to the gipsy camp, at rest the child to his side with a snatch of familiar as melody, and then, an the robber band wake to his real character, summons to tea and a file of soldiers he has had within call throughout the perilous adventur- ' In this way all is smoothed out Colonel Veroke it is brought to book. Simeon Lake who had claimed to be the brother of Dr Earle, in love with Lady Vere ker, is forced to acknowledge his imposture, and Ct pital Fritz von Holstein is rewarded with the home for dainty Sibyl Errington All this is sympathetic fully set forth at the Criterion Theatre Mr Arnold, better than any actor * e can recall, threw a glamour of romance over the simple characters he loves to depict A handsome stage figure in the German was lal uniform, no wonder that Captain Fritz wins the heart of Sibyl errington Miss Dot Frederic play I his part gracefully, and the comedy scenes between her the two are amongst the best in the piece Especi time) successful was that in which the pretty maiden is Inches her lover the ballad of Lord Bateman" De lie with a perfect air of nature and earnest endow tear between mistress and burnt, the house was vast say amused at the way in which Sibyl raised her fa Sts to the lover she cluded with her finger "Can't to catch the note of she cries impatiently, and their noisome lieutenant swoops down upon her mouth and ten east roars of laughter explains naively. "But you told me to catch the note " These comely scenes are brightly played Mr Arnold sings li i If a dozen new songs during the evening His you a bas music in it, and touches the heart. The mc 11 popular of the songs was the dashing " Private 1 Tommy Atkins " with its trumpet calls and tattoo beat, given with great spirit, and thrice encored 1 by the audience. The most fascinating was 'Fairy Bubbles" Captain Fritz is alone in the haunts of room, and little Sir Geoffrey 'S error creeps i in his nightgown to frighten the blithely kilted German with " ghosts " But Captain Fritz, it appears, is fond of ghosts He lifts the tiny apparition on to his knee, the Tod glow of the fire warms the dimly-seen figures, a moonbeam slants across the old panels L room, and Captain Fritz with more art than his is tenors are aware of, sings ' Fairy Bubbles " His voice rises and falls in harmonious evidence as he < catches the iridescent globes on his hand, or watches them burst when the " ghost " launches them with a so palpable an im- pulse upon the moonlit am. Jessie Mead, the English child actress, who may be her debut here as Sir Geoffrey, played well, and I had not too much to do Mr Percy Brough made a deal and ed hit as Corporal Soyer The dish impudence, 1 honest good nature and cure responses of a tyme k1 Tommy Atkins of the Cockney species demoted by Rudyard kipling, were cleverly illustrated by Mr Brough It was a good piece of stage work, and the young actor will be remembered by it.
