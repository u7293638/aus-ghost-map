ENGLISH CRICKET NOTES. The first match between the Gentlemen anil players took place on July 6, T, and 8. The pro fessionals won the toss ; bnt their Innings only realised 185, although they played a splendid team. Flowers led the tray with St, and then came Barnes 28, Dlyett 22, and Midwinter 21, not out. C. T. Studd bad 3 wickets for 16, and A. G. Steel 4 for '49. The Gentlemen stopped.at 105 on going into to bat, and this result was brought about by the fine bowling of Allan Bill and Bates. The former t >ok t wii keta for Bj, and the latter 4 lor 49. The Players, on taking he hat again, put on 207 Bulow and Ulyitt, who led off, had 65 and 45 respectively, while Flowers claimed 50, and Maurice Bead 21. These are in their form this season the four best professional batsmen in England. C. T. Studd capture l 5 for 80, Steel 3 for 01, and Grace 2 for 28. The Gentlemen had 230 to make, and they failed at 160. They began very badly, as Grace and Lucas only contributed a single between, and C. T- Studd also failed to come off. A. N. Hornby came in late, and cracked lie bowling in great style while he was making 54. Lord Harris was next with 43, and 25 we credited to A. G. Steel. Eight bowlers were used by tbe players. Flowers got 4 for 20, Bates 3 tor 49, and Peate-2iorl6. Tbeeecond match played at Lords resulted in a Very different way. The Gentlemen were in first with Grace and Hornby. The former was bowled for 4, and the latter fell alter making 21. Lucas and C. T. Studd then made a splendid stand. While they were associated the score was taken from 32 to 236, and then both left together. Lucas had made 107 when he was caught, and without any alteration in the score Studd was thrown out from cover point. He had made 100, and neither bats men gave the ghost of a chance. A. G. Steel hit hard lor 74, and the Bev, V. Boyle putting in 32, the score reached 374. The opposition was weak in bowling, as Peate, Morley, and Hill were absent. 1 The Players began with Barlow and Ulyett. A11 save Bates and Scotten got into double figures, but Glyett's 23 was tbe highest score, and the total only reached 163. Morton howled 4 for 38, Steel 4 for 78, ■and C. T. Studd 2 for 39. On following, Ulyett hit Very hard.and made 56 by splendid cricket. Barnes followed with 62, and then came Shrewsbury 47 {not ont), Bates 36, Selby 26, Barlow 10, and Lock j wood 19—the -total being 287. This left the task of making 77 to.the Gentlemen, and it cost them two Wickets, C. T. Studd being ont with 31. Surrey beat Sussex by 0 wickets in their first match. Scores, 164 and 116 (for 1 wicket) against 08 and 179. For Surrey, J. Shuter played two fine innings of 49 and 68, not ont; S. W.

Pooley was in fine form at the wickets, five batsmen falling to him in the second innings of Sussex. The second match played on the Oval came off the other way, as Surrey played without Barratt and Lucas, and Jones was too unwell to do much bowl ing. Sussex began, and made 240 (Whitfield 40 Bettesworth 66, Blackman 43, H. Phillips 45, New man 31). Suriey realized 202 in reply, and at their second attempt could only make 132.

In tbe second innings of Surrey Hide, syoung bowler, bagged 4 wickets for 25, and on tbe other side Jones, with 3 had 64 and 2 for 17, did best. Ihe second game between Kent and Sussex was drawn. Sussex were in first, and registered 195 (0. A. Smith 68, H. Phillips 45, and C. J. Lucas 21) Kent made 275, alter having only 4 wickets down lor 255. Of these O'shaughnessy had 98, G. Hearae 90, and F. Beam 31. Sussex on going to the wickets again just equalled this score (Blackman 75, Trevor 45, H. Phillips 35, Bettesworth 32). Kent lost 1 wicket lor 33, and then the match was left drawn. The Notts and Lancashire match was seriously interfered with by rain. The scoring was low, and Notts won alter a very exciting finish. Barlow, in the second innings, carried his bat for 5. He was in an hour before he scored, and over two hours alto gether. Notts—116 and 42 (Oscroit 12 and 0, Shrews bury 13 and 4, Barnes 15 and 13, Wright 6 and 11, Flowers 24 and 8, Mills 18 and 0). Iancashire—52 and 69) A. G.

For Lancashire Crossland (first innings) 5 for 44; Steel 5 for 18, and Watson 5 for 23 (second innings). Yorkshire bad very bad luck against Surrey, as the call of time saved the latter from a crushing defeat. The Northeners began with 277, Ulyett played splendidly for 120, but was missed when he bad made 6. Lockwood came next with 64, and Barratt had 5 wickets for 109. Surrey could only make 123 and 197 (J. Shnter 57 and 59, M Bead 14 and 18, W. W. Bead 0 and 24). For Yorkshire Peel, a colt, took 4 wickets for 36, and 5 for 83. Ulyett had 3 for 4 in the first innings. Yorkshire went in to make 44 runs in thirty minutes, and Ulyett and Hawke had knocked off 35 of the number when time was called. The Gloucester Eleven have not done much this season, but with a Boore of 348 they easily beat So merset, who could only realize 62 and 109. E. M. Grace made 108 and Midwinter 107, not out. Each gave a chance, but Mid's was a fine display of sound cricket. Middlesex lost their first match with Surrey by 25 runs, but they were amply revenged in the return, played at Lords, when they won by 8 wickets. Sur rey, 117 and 209 (J. Shuter, 38 and 23; S. W. Cately, 28 and 24; M. Bead, 4 and 20; W. W. Bead, 26 and 70; Pooley, 12 and 15). Middlesex, 235 and 93 for 2 wickets (A. J. Webne, 70 and 40, not out; L D. Walker, 61 and 6; C. T.

At Lords, on July 17 and 18, a remarkable match was played between Lancashire and Middlesex. The latter got in first on a splendid wicket, and, with all their crack amateurs in the ranks, rc was thought that a batting treat was in store for the spectators. The first wickets tumbled very rapidly, however, and it was only through the brilliant dis play of Hon. A. Lyttleton (49) and the hard hitting of Vernon 133) that the total reached 123. Cross land got 5 for 51, and Barlow 3 for 9. Lancashire did well from the start, and 243 was the outcome of ill fir innini.u Hnnihv led thp wnv with 1S1.

Middlesex made 163 at their second attempt. Lyttleton (76) was again in fine form, and G. B. Studd contributed 45, but Webbe, Walker, Leslie, and C. T. Studd only raised 14 between tbem. Crossland and Steel did the destruction, each getting 5 wickets for 30 and 49 respectively. Lancashire got the required 49 with the loss of a wicket, Barlow making 27 not out and Steel 12 not oat. The Eton and Harrow match resulted in a draw, and contrary to expectations, Harrow had none the worst of it. Harrow, 187 and 141; Eton, 140 and ,132 (for 7 wickets). Surrey escaped a certain thrashing at thehands of Lancashire through the rain preventing play on the second day.
