I ,am not long, however, to phjby'iriy' soli-, tudo, for herç is a stop close by, me, and tho glimmer of a cigar. ; " Ali! Miss Paisely," says a low, musi- cal voice, with which I am very familiar.' " Did you take me for a; ghost'?" I' say,; laughing. ; . ,' ' " Hardly. ,, I never yet hanrd of a1 ghost wearing flowers. 'I left the dining-room before tho others because I wished to have a few minutes' serious talk with you." ; , "Oh, don't he serious," Icry,:piteously, aad making a wry face. '.'"'? "Oh, put by jesting," he rejoins'Jn rather a weary tone bf voice ; " after this I shall make no further exactions upon your' time br niood;" 1 ; 1 .'?.? My vanity is wounded, and I say, sharply j " I can bo as grave1 as most people when tho occasion requires it ; but there are person^ who inistake moroseness for gra- vity and good spirits for heartlessness." " Very likely," ho'goes on, hardly heed- ing my sally ;. " but I have not como to defend my own conduct but rather to pléad for anothor. I am going-I am ' going to speak about my young friend Hamilton! Look beroj lîhoda Paisely,' you may flirt with ninety-nine men, and though it may hurt your vanity to hear it, do them no lasting barm ; but with the hundredth ' it' may be different ; you may at last'drive him to madness or perdition.

" An excellent young mari, doubtless," I put in with something of alancen ; Not noticing tho interruption : " Ho is, I know, not ' generally ' attractive to women.' From a boy ho has boon physi- ' cally very delicate; his nature is high strung nnd nervous. Now, you know he loves you." "Indeed, you flatter me," I say, looking down to hide ' a blush,' which I fancy (though I know really it is not visible in tho darkness)] ; cannot; escape; his gray, penetrating eyes. ' >- ¡ , i ;.

I cannot help contrasting tho two friends ; tho younger-and so much the younger, too-so fair and fragile ¡¡the older,-certainly'; not at jail;,handsome, but strong of limb and broad chest, with tl io dark, resolute facie worn and beaten-by the stonn!wind,of tho¡world ;.

' To-day papa has got to his office occupations again, and to-day I feel terribly sad and cheerless-a sadness which ali things around me tend to deepen ; the ruetle of dead leaves bf -thbgaidenpaths, the moanings of ? the wind in the leafless branches/ the cold gray aspect of the sky; Is there nothing I should'like-to db ? .'" I thurk, as I wander listlessly between the garden and the honse. Ah 1 yes, th ere is : ono thing I have always intended, to do, arid why not to- day? I gather a nosegay bf. late Autumn flowers out of our,own garden, knowing that,if living, that would have pleased him most,'and i Bet out on my sad pilgrimage. : They have laid my lover to restât Norwood,in tho. dim vaults - away under tho church. :! As I,-walk up the long, rows- of tombs a chilly rain begins falling, boating in my face ; but lido' not' feel frightened or lonely in this capital of the dead, nor-db I shrink as, lit by a faintly glimmering tapor,.-I wander down.the sad, - populous region below, though Lshiveraí: the dank air, in which death seems to be- come almost palpable. My guido, looking carefully at the name's, taper in hand, stops before one. ' I signify to him that I would be alono for a few minutes and he; retires. I bend down and read the inscription : " William Hamilton, born May 17,1851; died Juno 9, 1873. Ho giveth His beloved sleep." It is, indeed, sleep for him, and unmaired by any dreams? ? I think of how he loved ino-that love which I hold so lightly-and the plenteous tears come. But here is a . sten. The custodian of the place coining back,.I suppose. I raise my eyes lmrriedly, and Colonel Gordon enters;, but they hare in them a" milder, sweeter, dook than I havo ever seen there<before.. Ho takes my hands in his and holds them," looking long and lovingly at the inscrip- ? rion on the collin.. "VVe do not'.speak a 'word, but we leave the placo together and como out into tito gray wintry light of the jfading day. i He draws my'arm in hi8, still holding, rny hand, and we walk a little way in silence.'
