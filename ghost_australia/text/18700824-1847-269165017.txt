After .a smart ^ walk of twenty minutes over all sorts of" country, saying nothing of swamps, barriers, and such like—(but what is \- this to a fellow that's bent on sport?— «cho answers, <f nothing ")—I suddenly espied a ^ brush.' 5 For the information icf some of my friends, I may mention that it was «t a ".iaSrbrush, - " but a, « hairy brush;/' in tny simplicity I thought it had very much the appearance of an " airy brush.' 9 * Yes, there the little merry cus sat deliberately surv :•••'veying our movements. Down upon one knee I went in an instant, with warrior-like promptitude, and in. the most approved fashion JJOW in vogue throughout our volunteer vorps of = the «olony. Yes, Mr 3-ditor, once I had the great honor of being ^a full private " in that glorious band of brothers, from whom I learnt the most valuable position, After having cocked my gun, I slowly raised it to my shoulder, solemnly; shutting-one eye, and was-about to take •deadly -aim at the little-chap's head, when he quietly wheeled to the right about and skedaddled. I almost thought I detected a grin upon the iinpudejR, •young scamp's " •counting- house might have been fancy. Just imagine my feelings-, to be grinned at by a brush," is rather too much of a *' goak." In the meantime Dick went thundering along, thro' mud and mire, up hill and down dale, across barrier after" barrier, when all of a senond I heard his rifle go " whiz up I rushed, in hot haste, nearly dislocating my neck ia the excitement, and when I hove in •sieby.here in front of rre was scudding a •'hopper" under full sail, and the youthful Richard " stood like Patience on a ". Tnonument smiling on beef," and ever and anon muttering half-aloud, " Oh, my beauty, it was well for you I missed," sentiment, I am sure, our longegged friend fully participated in. After this the game became very scarce, and we walked for miles over such country as I hope, Mr Editor, you may never have occasion to pass over, without getting the sight of a kangaroo, ;they having evidently taken up the alarm rand-kept themselves mighty quiet. I now began to feel a most uncomfortable ^peckish" sensation, aud proposed getting home to dinner as soon as possible. Accordingly we started, and gave up the idea ofeany more shooting, having had only one shot between the tvro of us and that one was of the feminine gender, viz., "a miss"—pleasant was it not ? but there being no help for it, we had just to grin and look pleasant (a; hard task under the circumstances)^ Having now arrived at what was once a ford, but through the rain had become a crec k of no niean dimension?, we went into a committee of the ways an&roeaas;^ to be employed to cross, and finally determined that there was n-.thing for it but to walk, therefore after having divested ourselves of our boots and socks and " shied" them to»the other side, we commenced our passage, but not before we had tucked up our continuations. The " ridiculosity" (if I may coin a •word) of our situation at once struck me, and forthwiih I burst into an.uncontrollable fit of laughter to which poor Dick put in a most doleful second— what a change bad come o'er the spirit of his dream. Yes, sir, there stood the; valiant Dick of the morning looking thepicture of hopeless misery, whilst I: stood, or more correctly, stuck a fewyards off in the greatest state of anxiety and fully believing that every minute would be my next. Was not this a dreadful position for a vnung man of weak nerves to be in ? Well, after a great deal of floundering, splashing, and bathing we again reached terra jirma, and having resumed our boots, &c.;, Dick determined to .fire off: his^ remaining barrel, so that'when he got "home it would appear as if he^hadrsbot something—ingenious Bide; he- was always a smart boy, Accordingly lie .took aim at an unoffending old gum tree which was distant about five yards, and inflicted a mortal wom.d on the fine old fellow. " Ah !" cried I, in a philrsophi cal voicc, " if that had only been a kangaroo wouldn't 3 7 ou have made him dance a jig." "Yes," soliloquised my crest-fallen friend, " If is a great word, and its meaning we do not all thoroughly comprehend; vif Dr. Curdle had not meddle-d with hot ore he would not ha YP burnt his fingers;"-^wise Richard! " True, most potent, grave, and noble Socrates" I exclaimed ; yes, true it is ihat the doctor:bas slightly s'nged his fingers, but still beholds the cure in his own hand i.e., to eifteimirate the spurious ore, and leave netting but the genuine article belrn^. v'z., himself, as exemplified by the polling cf Thursday, and this result n^t only gives sat ; sfaction to all enlightened minds, but adds a tone fo the Council table of Camperdown. As this conversation ended we found ourselvessonce more at home, and vowed that it would J»e some time before we again went kangaroo hunting in the langes and barriers of Stonyford. I have much pleasure in suhseriling myself your pale companion, THE GIJObT OF 01.
