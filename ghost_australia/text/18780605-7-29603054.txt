In the legislative Council— The usual formal opening business was tran[?]d, by the election of Committees, &c.; The adoption of the Address in reply to His Excellency's Speech was moved by tbe Hon. A. HaY, and seconded by tiie Hon. J. Prices. Too Cbxkf Seceetj!3EV bavins briefly Bp?kea ; t'_3 debate, on the motion of the Hon. S. A. Tasoxos, was adjouuci until Wednesday. In fiie Assembly— A large number of <-pestioiis were asked, and regies given. Mr. Qtjxh. on a formal motion, drew a. js*iti ti to the position in which builders end others at Port Adelaide were placed, erring io the in sufficient quantity of stone -recei*i*-d fr_ta Dry Creek, end asked that free labor shonM ti employed to raise stone if the prison labor was inaaequate to supply the dta—ond.

Mr.^A?SOire moved, and Mr. Fnian-s seoowdc-l, the nlopthm of ttie Address, a—An. debate ensne_, which wat ad jonrned on Mr. Buama-B motion tiU next day. The House adjourned at 20 minutes ti 4 o'clock tMU next day. Th*e debates on Tuesday on the Address in reply to the Acting-Governors Opaning Spec A were exceedingly time in bath Houses. In the Assembly Mr. Parsons made, in moving the adoption of the Address, one of the test maiden sp:~ Acs that have been delivered in our Parliament, and created. a very favorable impression upon his feUow-membars. His rot-narks upon Berryisn were particularly effective and well received. Should he prove as su(*-cesEful in the strife of discu -'on as in the delivery of a prepared spaech Mr. Parsons will be one of the most u^af jl ol our legislators. His expression of a hopa that hon. members would during tV.t session rice above mere party and persanal feeling, and that the veteran politicians of the House would eat a pattern to the younger member-?, met with approval, but there was a cy-aicaL smile on , many faces that was ps-mfolty significant. With regard io this Education question, which is likely to ba brought prom'nently forward this session, Mr. Parsons, whose opinions es a late memfcar of the Council of Education carry weight, affirmed that the present system is not answering the purpose of securing the instruction of thosa children who had baen neglected bafore the present Act was pass-id, and he urged that the enforcement of the campulsory c'.aus*3 bas beqojne necessary, and that compulsion must involve free education. In this view he'was supported by Mr.-Furaer, who sa conded the motion for the adoption of the Addreas. On Mr. Hardy rising there was a rush- flor the refreshment room, so that it was before a thin House that Mr. Glyde solemnly warned the Government that they would not.bp allowed to go through the session without attempting to grapple with th^q-apsfidn Of altering for the batter the prpspntinridanne of taxation. Allwhos.?->ke were (rimnjnoui-J npon this question. Mr. Glyde did not consider the revenue in a floix-riehiMg Condition, but from this opinion the Commissioner Mt Public Works and Mr. Colton bj_ exclamatory interpellations expressed,,thejr emphatic dissent. Thera was natiitafly consl-ferable difference of opim.-&J;^th_referen-? to new railways. Mr. Hardy, is opposed to. the Wentworth line, as probably forty members of the Aj?^mhly-twillbe. Mr. Henning could not reconcile the intention of the Govern-ae-at to c#ntentth?meelves as far as the Alb?r. distilct 16 concerned with the construction of a line from tfonacoorte to Frances with a speech deUveced by the Commissioner of Public Works at Border Town, and regretted 'that tbe coaunenceme.it of a' railway, from Adelaide to Victoria did not form part of the Ministerial pro^a-nm? Mr. Landseer was also in favor of a line through the -hills, with a view of carrying !it to our eastern .boundary. The Speaker I was put-ting the motion for the adoption o. the Address when Mr. Bundey moved tiie adjournment of the debata tail next day. In the Council the Governmeit polio/, so far as it was dealt with, met with a qualified support. Several hen. members expressed themselves in opposition ta the Ministerial-proposal giving the Governor power to send a portion of the Council ta the country on the occasion of a dissolu tion of the Assembly. Mr. Hay would -rather get over Upper House obstructiveness by allowing the Governor to nominate when thought necessary a few Councillors. The Outer Harbor scheme was also con demned by more than one speaker, and there were diverse expressions of opinion with regard to railways proposed and lines forming ne part of the Government policy for this session. What calls for special notice is the fact that 60 far the Ministry hare completely ignored the questien of re adjn&ting; the present inequitable mode of taxation. This was the subject that excited most interest at the recent elections for the Assembly. At the elections for the Upper House all, or nearly all tthe candi dates denounced the present system, as extremely unjust to persons of small incomes, and Mr. Morgan was specially earnest on this point. Now we find this great tax reformer absolutely dumb on the matter. We know that they hare on the hustings urged as a reason for delay the negotiations going on between the Govern ment of New South. Wales, Queensland, and South Australia, with a view to estab lishing a Customs Union between the three colonies, but the Parliament and people would ba glad of some information as to the probability of thef.3 negotiations having a satisfactory termication within a reason able time, and what are the intentions of Government with reference to reform in tthe incidence of taxation should those nego tiations prove a failure. It would have been satisfactory had some allusion to this snt - ject appeared in fiis .Ezcellescy's speech. Certainly some reference should have t:zn made to it by the Ministers on Tuesday, but the Premier in the Lower Hou^ would apparently, bad not a private member inter posed, have allowed the debate t? close without a angle Minister -owldcg an ot*:er vation; and in the other Chamber the Chief Secretaiy did not say a word on what -used to be a prominent part of his policy, and is now -receiving more attention than ally Other .Subject in the country. We do not remember an icstance before in which, in a general debate in our Parliament on the Government policy, the Ministry treated irith silent contempt the observations of honorable members on a question of great importance, ooncendng which their con stituents had e-qpreased strong opinions. It would ba a bad day to% tiie couniry if any Government should over discover this to be a good method of getting over diffi culties, or holding their party together. These is no doubt tbat onr education system will again this year he put through the crucible of debate in the House of Assembly. Mr. Basedow probably is not entirely satisfied with the failure of his attacks on the system last year, and Mr. Rees already shows much ardor in his dis approval of the present stite of things, and may not unnaturally be regarded as possibly aspirinj to succeed the memfcar for North Adelaide in the position he fills on the Treasury Benches. Parliament will now, in Hb deliberations on this subject, have the valuable assistance of Mr. Parsons, who has been a member of the Council of Edu cation, aid may fairly bs supposed to have tscome acquaint;! with all the excellencies and defe_ts discoverable in the working of he system, and pc ha able to indicate th? points in which amfmdments are desirable, and what should be the nature of those pmendment?? Mr. Parsonsbsliev?sstron-jly, ns meet people do who take any interest in the subject, that the time has snivel when the compu'-Sory ctetras of the £ location Act should be enforced, wherever there are t ?hools to a-xommodata the children it is desired to -feS-ene from the >3norance in which careless, heartiers, or criminal parent:• are allowing them to grow up. He also contends that if we make education com pulsory we must also make it free, seeing probably the difficulty there will be in deciding what parents rertHy are able or unable to p_y for the schooling of their children. Mr. Furner, who has bad some experience in the working o? the Act on Yorke's Peninsula, takes the same view ; and as other hon. men-bars appear to agree with hint on this subject it may ha expected that one of; the leading prro-nples of the present system will ba assailed. Mr. Parsons says that very little progress has been made in securing the instruction of those children who were allowed to go untaught before the Education Act was passed; in other words, that the children now at the Government schools are of the same classes as those who received educa tion under the old state of things. We are not getting many if any of the garter children to our public -schools-; but they with others to whom that tsrm might not apply are growing np without obtaining the rudiments of education. The report of the Council of Education for the year 1877, which was laid before Parliament last weak, saams to baar out Mr. Parsons in his assertions. The average monthly roll for 1875 showed 15..7 C) scholars, the average daJlyattendancebr-ing 11,931. In 1878 tbe figures in 17,726 and 13,622. Last year the average monthly roll showed 19,430, and the average, daily attendance was 14,406. Now,-con-' iddering the increase of population during the last two years and the numbar of pri vate seminaries that have been closad by the opening of the Government s-jhool-s, -these figures are anything but satis factory; in fact, we doubt whether they show any improvement at all with regard to the proportion or the children of the colony who are receiving education. It appears, too, that the per centage of attendance to the number on the roll bas fallen off. During 1875 it was 75-80, in 1876 it was 76*58, in 1877 it had decreased to 73-C5. The Council express regret that they have baes unable to ascer tain how many children are being in slructad at home or in privata schools, aid state that in their opinion it will be neces sary to secure the -registration of all the children tatween the ages of five and 13 before compulsory provisions of the Act can be carried out. "For numerous rea sons/* says the report, it has been found impracticable to carry out the compulsoiy clauses of the Act in North Adelaide and some of the country distriists, as had been intended. A house to house census has been taken of the children of a school-going age in Adelaide, Norwood and Kensington, Port Adelaide, Lefevre'e Pen in?ula, PorUand Estate, and East and West Torrens. The numtar of attendances of each scholar required by the Act is 140 during the year, and only about a third of' the pupils on the roll have attended that number of times. It is evident enough that the Act is not working so well a** could be wished, and the Parliament will re quire to know whether this arises from inherent defects in the Act or from faults in' the way in which it is -administered. Last cession many objections -were not un fairly c&possd; of by the reminder tbat tbe system was only just put into opoiatioD, and it was too zoon to expert that it wonld effect all or nearly all. that the friends of education might rcat-roably require in an established system; but tb;s apology for shortcomings will not be of so much effect now~tbat the Act has had another year's faiaL - . ... NoTWrrHBTANDiKQ the forebodings to :4he^ contrary lately prevailing in political circles in Europe it'now seems probable that the Conference will speedily meet. The formal invitations have been issued; tthe date fixed for the meeting is June 13th, and the place of aseembling will be Berlin. The Mjarquis of Salisbury and Sir Stafford have officially communicated the terms -of the invitation to the English Parliament. It appears that England only accepted the proposal for a Conference subject to the acquiescence of the other Powers, and to the f till discussion of the terms of the Treaty of San Stafanb. .Both these requirements it is announced hive been . complied with. Each of toe Powers will, he represented by the Premier and the Foreign Minister. Siichan arrangement will, however, give rise to some difficulty. In Germany, Austria, and Russia, for example, there is, strictly speaking, no Premier Or President of the Ministerial Council for the whole E^mpire. Possibly Prince Bismarck might in the case of Germany be regarded as combining tbat office with-the Ministry for Foreign .Affairs, but in Austria there is a Pfc-efijaeut of the Council of Ministers buth in Austria and in Hungary, and in Bussia there is no such office; Probably, however, the arrangement is simply intended to mean that each Power should be repre sented at the Conference by twa of tbe chief members of the Cabinet. It is gratifyirg to learn from the Euro pean telegrams that the Emperor of Gar-many is lapidly •recovericr* fe*m the effesh of the. wounds inflicted npaa him by bis dastardly assailant. The Australian cricketers are engaged in another match. On this oecu.on their antago nists are the well-known eleven of the county ef Surrey. So far as the game bas gone it is very even, the Australians beipg only three runs... ahead of their opponents in the first innings. There iB therefore every' pnibabilitj- of a clo^a siii eaccHmg contest. 'We understand that the Government b(.ve Ltuc 1 a writ a_-af->st the Adelaide Stsam ehip Comp-jjy to recover the expansas in .mired "' id railing the dredger Willuo-ja, which was stink thronsh a colLiskta with the steamer Victarian, and a'so £oinp3tisa.tion for the damage done to the dredger. We bear that the Company suggested a referencs of the matter to arWt-uCion or the ascepta-acs of the decision of tihe three Admiralty sm -reyors in South Aus tralis, Victoria, and New South Wale?, and that the Government refused to entertain either proposal. ' The Council of the University met on Tuesday afternoon, but notbtng was done with rir_-:_3ce to the cste of frotessor Bead. The Couioil meets again to-morrow. IWe believe that it is probable the Ade laide and Suburban Tcamway will be opened oa Monday next. The Company have had many obstacles to overcome, and we hope now that things will go along more smoothly, and that the operationsof the Company will be productive of advantage to the public. Up to "the time of our going to press there were so tidings of the .steamer Cazeo, which is now doe. The Murray at Echnca is 7 feet 3 inches stove summer level * at Overland Corner it it rising. ■ The new tug Yatala proceeded to the North Arm on Tuesday morning, June 4, and had her compass; .adjusted by Captain Blanch, F R.G.S., and in the afternoon she towed the ship City of Glasgow to the Semaphore an chorage. \- A special meeting of the seatholders of Trinity Church, Adelaide, was held in the Sehoolrccm, on Tuesday evening, June 4, when a Committee was appointed for the purpose of rii'aing funds towards the cost of hnilding a new church. In the Legislative Council on Tuesday next the Chief Secretary will move:— ** That he bave leave to intrcince a Bill for an A:t to erable tbe Governor, on any dissolution o" the House of A«:-;-;mbly, to declare vacant th? seats of one-third of ths members of the Legislative Council," • John Weid?er ; ft shepherd in the esijiloy of Messrs. Ros-.h, butchers, Moonta, has received a slice of goci fortune. The Tithe's Peninsula ttdvsrtiser is told on gocd authority that ££D,CCi3 has beei left ta him by the will of a deceased relative. His chief regret is that he will h-tv-e to leave his sheep. Mr. H. Lamshed held an inquest at Port Victoria on Saturday, June l,on the body of Thomas Omond, who was recently drowned at that port. The evidence of Messrs. K. McLeod and R. Ormond and Dr. H. R. Brown was taken, after which a verdict of death by drowning was returned. A meeting of the promoters of the Com mercial Insurance Company was held at Mr. C-raie's office on Tuesday, Jnne 4. Mr. Thomas King, M.P., presided. Applications were re ceived for 16.CC3 shares, of which 15,000, the number constituting the share-list of the Com pany, were allotted. Mr. Hare -was proceeding to give notice in the Assembly, on Tuesday afternoon, of his intention to move for a-a alteration of the inci dence of taxation by the imposition of income taxes, when he was reminded by the Spraker that this was a subject usually left for introduc tion by the Government, and that it wonld bs better to allow tbem to del' with the matter. The hon. me*at:r accepted the intimation and withdrew his motion. Mr. Mortlock bas given notice of a motion in the Areemb'y, which will have the effect if carried of bringing the Sunday Closing Clause of Neck's .Act before Parliament. On Wednesday next he will move:—"That, inthe opinion of this House the various Licensed* Victuallers' Acts should be consolidated, and that clause 4 in the Act No. €3 of 1877 be re pealed ; and the Government do bring in a EiU for that purpose.'' On Tuesday, Jnne 4, Police-Trooper O'Mahoney.of Kapunda, reported to Inspector Peterswald as follows :—" On Sc*iday-_wrniog. John JEeanes, of Moppa, found a Mask shawl and driving -whip near his pis'*. Pinned to the shawl was a note (unsigiied) 3-3-fa.ting tbat tbe writer intended to commit suicide the previous night.

Speaking of Panl-nd the early praaehen, tht- jir duad vantages, the opposition they encountered, and their wonderful power notwithist-uading, the p-m-3_heraaid*lteseaetof their power was the possesion of toe Holy Ghost.

A case of perjury ariang oat of an actinn tried in the Local Court on May 15 was heard at .the Police Court on Tuesday, Jane 4. The defendant was John Lemon, a conteactor 3M_d bmlder,of Hindman-i, and the prosecutor William Emg, a fisherman, of the same place. Tbe facts of toe case were these:—Kiug com menced tim 3_rec_tonof a honse, and after getting the fonr walls np stopped work, as hismeana woold allow him to go no further. I_*monthen came to him and offered to roof the house for £30, aad fo finish off the test of the work for another _-90^pron*_sing to Wait six months for payment. This ax-rangera-it was agreed to, and when the roofing had bean finished a summons was issued fay Lemon "for £35 12s. dd. for a horse sold and fur the work done, and be obtained a verdict. The charge of yespisf waa based on the facto that Ltsum ja-hjle oh oath denied that only 10 bbah-_< of~ime had been delivered on the -t-rorks; his denial.H_f various particulars connected with the_ 3_4_foj-titrj of the lime, of which he had an intmaato'Jaiiowledge; his sayingthat five bushels had first been delivered, aad that the horse was sold to tbe plalntiS; and denying that credit had been given. A preliminary objection was raised fay Mr. Pater, on the ground that Mr. Vandrey, who adxniii-stered the oaths to the witoesses in the local Court on May 15, was not the Clerk of the Court. Hie quoted from the Local Court Act of 1881 to show that power was vested only with the Magisteate to tem porarily appoint a desk, whereas Mr. Vandrey had consented to act at the request of Mr. Row land, Clerk of the Court. After some little discussion. His Worship ruled that it was in his opinion tbe Court who admimu'-tered the oath, and the Court only. The case was then pro ceeded with. The evidence for the prosecution < -weqt to prove all that had been contradicted by the defendant, while for the defence c*>*_.' lonce was called to -show that probably about 25 bushels of lime wonld have been required o%\ the work the defendant had been engaged in. The defendant was committed for trial, bail being allowed, hhnself in one surety of £50, and two otiier sureties of £25 each.
