I FIELDS OPMIHfliNOWN I BY JOSEPH HOCKING;. I Author of . 'All -Men- 'ire Xiiars,' 'Ishmael ? Pengally,' 'The jStory of Anflrew ? Fairfax,' &c.; I CHAPTER J, I Merlin Rosev«ar was walking along a Cor-; I E!sh lane on a June evening. As usual,: he; I was dreaming, Tor Merlin was a great; I dreamer. Nearly all thei*ther youn^ men' ? wlio liveS in the village near, or were con I iiected with the Besowjsa'Mjne, had either. ? mne to see 'their' sweethearts of were srather | '^^H ed together in groups in owlet to talk of mat-' e ~^M tevs in which they were, interested. But Mer « ^^H iiu had been known all his Ufe as a 'loanly « :^H booy.' He preferred, the companionships of * '^H the people o£ his imagination to those of the ? .^H village; he would rather dream of the future ?t :^fl be ll0Ped fc*- tpin 'lifeten: to the talk of the is ;^H lads with ,whon%. iie had gojte to school, * ^H xhe general opinion in Besawsa Mine was * -.^H that Merlin would never, make out much in * 1H . me. People admitted that he was clever, and I -^H that he had 'nearly, as much, larnin' as the ^ -^fl passon hisself,' but then iie wasn't practical. a ^H When he had left school he went to work j, ^H B-ith his father' underground, and while he I. ^m -gamed a thorough knowledge of mining, he n :^H wa,s never contented as a miner. He gener f ^1 ally carried a book in his pocket, and was far 3 ^M inoie interested in the history of the strange & ^M people who ages before came to Cornwall to l. H w- for tin, than in the welfare of Besowsa y ^M Tin aiming Company, Liunited. ^M A year before this story opens he had :T-een '^H appointed as miae clerk, and while his work ^m was rnore congenial than tj^t, of the men who ^M ,w crted underground, he Tk§§~Jtar'£ftim. liappy. ,. H The truth was Merlin waited to. be a man k ^H of letters. From the days: of his childhood U ^M he liadrevelled in the stories for which Coro & ^1 Wnll is so famous. He had delighted him B ^M eelf in listening to old cronies' stories of ?? ^M wizards', fairies, and witchcraft, and in after Jj ^M years he longed to gi^e to the world books if ^M vliiclr should tell out his dreams of life. He i. ^M would rather have seen his name on the title ^M -page of. a ; successful .book than to be a peer H of the realm or the Prime Minister of the h ^B country. a '^M 'Some of the dreams of his life, too, were H very beautiful. He lived in the' woi£d of ro 1 ^M iuance; and true, pure romance is ever beatiti ^m ful. Ho had visions far removed from the ^M sordid materialism which he saw around him. :^M He saw ?Utopian* heights which to him were H possible, and- these he wanted to write about \- H He was a great reader, as the reading of * ^M country youths goes. He revelled in' the fine B writing .of Isaiah and that in the Book of Job, * H and could repeat from memory many a pas ^B sase from Milton and Shakespeare. Neither '^B was he altogether ignorant of later literature. H He- knew Walter Scott and Charles Dickens. ^M He knew a little of Browning, and more of H Tennyson. H As I said, Merlin Rosevear was walking ^M along a Cornish lane on a summer evening, H and as he walked he saw visions of what he * ^M wanted to doand be. H 'Yes,' he mused, 'I'll do it. I've stories to ,H tell, as well, as the best of them. I'm full of ^ H fancies, full of hopes. I'm sure my work is H far better than half of that which is accepted. H Oli. if 'those editors would only give me a H chance!' ^| He strode on, his lips moving nervously. H 'I've no one to encourage me; no one tm H dorstands me,' he continued bitterly. 'Peo- ^1 pi' laugh at my ideas. ? Even the new tra H yelling preacher tells me that my thoughts ^M are too unpractical to..1je . worth anything, ^M while father is always laughing at me. But K I. Ill do it; I'll do it,' and his eyes sparkled at ^M the thought of victory. ?s ^M 'No man can be happy unless his,surround :. ^m Inzs are agreeable,' he went on; 'Every- ' ^M thing frets and irritates him otherwise. Be: ^M eides, why should I do work that I hate when ^B thnre is a possibility -of spending my whole ^M time in doing what I love? Some people call ^M me lazy because I will not do as they do, but ' ^M they shall know some day! Why do I have ^H thesp dreams unless it is to fell them. Why ^M elwuld these- longings come to me, if they are H not intended to be satisfied? IWhy cannot I ? be a Walter Scott or a Victor Hugo? Why ^M cannot my thoughts be welcomed in the (H homes of England? Ay, ano^they shall, too V ^M ~~&ey; shall!' and the young man 'clenched H his fist as he strode onward. |H By this time the aspect of the roaS had \- ^H changed. ' instead of high hedges covered hy ? iH hnzel bushes, tall elm trees grew by the road .H 6ii'e- while, a little, further on: was -a gateway, ^H which stood at the end of a 'road leading up H to an old- fashioned house.- * . H 'Good eyenin', Merlin.' H 'Good evening. Jack.' ^H 'You ba'ant 'fraid of the ghost eoniin' up '? out of the addit, then?' . - H 'No; I don?t think it's been seen lately.' ? 'Oa, the sarvent chap over to Downderry ' H do zay that 'ee 'eard purty grooans there H w.wni night.' H ?-lerlin laughed. * H Near where he stood, and at the end of the H row of 'elins, was a disused mine pit, which H wis supposed to *be haunted, and the man B Jo. iced timidly towards it ^M 'Well, I shouldn't like to be here arter dark H for oal that; but some people doan't seem to ^B care. I do hear that Creekavose' is tooked '» ^M at last, after nobody Jivin' there oal thaise ? years.' ' * *? H 'Indeed! Who has taken it?' H 'Oa, a .cent by the name pf Granville.' * H '(rranville! ' That is an old Cornish' name.' H 'Yes; I do; bear -that the family was waunce ? tery rich, but that they've lost some of their ? riioney. Still, it'll taake a few pound a year ^ ? to biP up Creekavose.' \ 'b H 'Yes, it's a fine old place, but rather lonely. ? Good night. Jack.' ? . ? 'Good night Merlin.' H Merim walked ;along under the elms until ^M he came to the gaiteway which formed the en D H nance to ' Greekavose, an old commodious -. H bouse, which !had\been built long years before »- ^m ky a well-to-^o yeoman, who had- an ambition 2 I* to be reckoned among the landed gentry of H the county. Most of the land around had' ? -li^en cultivated by-neighboring, farmers, but H +1k- houso itself had been linihhabited for H ni-my years. The reasons for this were va H Jiuus. For one tiling, it was said, and reli H si msly believed among a section of the vil * H lasicrs^ that the spirit of the old yeoman who S I !lid built it came back to earth and haunted ^ H it: moreover, it was too large for the farmers H of the neighborhood, while capitalists did not care about burying themselves in a place so lemote from the busy world. Not that the i place .was 'destitute! of beauty. Bather, it ^as much to be. desired because of its eur j* foundings.

It is'true thatn|«nbers of the Besowsa Tin Mining Cbinpany, Limited, sometimes ap peared in the neighborhood, but they were never accompanied by ladies, henee the young lady coming along, the road ^became an ob ject of .peculiar xfinterest ^to. Merlin. As she came nearer ^he: jhtere^t^increased; He saw at a glance -iiiat:::sh« *was far removed from the young women of. the parish. He could scarcely „ tell. why, but her dressy Jier walk, the ^expression of her fiice, told him that she lived in a world different from that in which the mine girls of Besqwsa or .pie farmere' daughters, of the neighborhood lived. Not that she was what might be called handsome; her. features wer&.by fflo tomans -perfect; but there was an expression pf nobility on her face and a light shining from her eyes which revealed to the youngSman something of the life she lived. The face told Mm of many things which he could not put into words, the eyes, large and dark, spoke in a. language which strangely appealed to him.' Merlin felt all this rather than,' saw^ it— it .came to %a as an impression; and yet, had, he been agked to give reasons -for having these feel ings concerning /her, he could not have given satisfactory answers. - ? -They passed each ether without . a -word, but she lifted her «yes to. his for a moment, and then dropped them. That one look, how ever, set Merlin's heart beating wildly. Like other lads, he had- his dreams and fancies concerning women, but he had never followed in the wake of the village youths, whose one great object in life seemed to be to 'git a maid.' The women, he had lov«d. had been those he had read about in romances, or those whom he had conjured up by his own ima gination. This graceful girl, however, pas sing by hini in the country lane, ' her face aglow with' the health of youth, her eyes re fleeting, the brightness of the ?westering sun,' seemed to be the fulfilment of his dreams; she appealed to all ;the poetry of his nature, and set his heart throbbing with a joy that was half pain. He did not know who she was; for a moment hie did not care; he only knew .that from the moment their eyes met. his ufe became new. ' - He did not .turn and look after her; he wan dered on like one in a dream, and then sud denly stopped. For a few moments he stood thinking, and then he turned and silently fol lowed her. By this time she was out of isight— a tarn in the lane had hidden her fromi his view; but he hurried, along close to the hedge side, as if anxious to escape observa tion; then, coming up to the bend in the lane, lie stopped, for she had again become visible. With a strange; yearning look in his eyes, he watched, her uniil ^gke- came to Creekavose Gate. 'Nero, Nero!' she called, and instantly the great dog came bounding back to her. 'Don't you know the way to. your new home, Nero?' she said, with a laugh, as she patted the dog's huge head; then she opened the gate, and dis appeared beneath the shadow of elm trees which formd an avenue leading up to the house. Again Merlin ran along on the grass which divided the road from the hedge, until he came to the gate; then ie watched her until she was out of sight For a long time he stood thinking; but, suddenly realising his position, he hurried away as though he had been doing something of which he was as hamed. ? ? ? : ? : He had nearly reached Besowsa Mine when, seeing a footpath tnrough some fields which led to a ^-wooded v.alley, he jumped over the stile, and made his way thitherward. Pre sently he slackened his pace, and soon after stopped. ? 'She has come to live at Greekavose,' he mused; 'I expect she is the daughter ofVthe new owner. Her name will be GranvinW' He paused for a few seconds, and again went on musing. 'Anyhow, 6he is far. removed from me. , Merlin Rosevear, the clerk of Be sowsa Mine, has no right to speak to sueh as she. I wonder now, I wonder ? ' He walked on again until he came to the mouth of the valley. \- 'Good evenin', MJerlin.' 'Good evening, Abraham. Prospecting as usual?' . . 'Iss, I'm lookin' round a bit Tell 'ee what, sonny, you doan't knaw haalf the lodes in Besowsa. You do jist kep on workin' 'pon the new part of the mine, and do never tich the ould men's workin's. I've heerd my faather tell of a grand lode that th' ould men worked. They knaw'd- tin, they did; as fur yer new up-the-country cap'n, he doan /knaw nothin' 'bout Cornish mines.' 'Well, he, thinks he knows more about it than you older men, Abraham; besides, the company didn't think you knew much about the new ideas concerning mining. That was why you were asked to resign, and why Cap'n Kent was appointed in your place.' 'Iss, iss, I dersay,' replied the old man, sadly. ''Tis jist like the new-fangled no tions to put a man like Cap'n Kent to work a mine, when he doan' knaw nothin' 'bout it But I tell 'ee, cheeld, there's a grand lode not a hundred fathoms from the' injin shaft which could be worked from/the thirtyfa thom sollar.' 'But why didn't the old men work it, Abra ham?' 'Why? 'Cause they had no machinery to kip the water out, that's why.1' 'Well, we are working from the twentv fathom collar towards the old mine, Abra ham.' 'Iss, I do knaw. Now look, Merlin, you be the clerk of Besowsa, and you've got a map of the underground workin's. E-o 'ee knaw about the addit level that do run from jist here up close, to the backs, not far from your twenty-fathom sollar?' * . ; 'No, I never heard .of it.' 'I knaw'd you didn'. But there es, my dear, there es. Look, 'ere's the mouth of the level.' . Merlin looked,, and saw a hole in the hill side which seemed to run in the direction of the Besowsa Mine. -J 'Well, now,' continued Abraham, 'that level do run close up to the *baeks' where the, imen be stbpin'. I spoase, now, that j-our cap'n do think that the ground es saafe jist there?' 'It's well timbered, Abraham.' 'Well tembered!'^ responded the old 'man; 'tell 'ee what, Merlin, there's hundreds of tons of stuff jist ready to falL and it'll smash all yer temberm'. like matches'.' ''.'..-'.?? 'You should tell Gap'n Kent.'- ? '? . 'I have iould 'un, my dear. But he do knaw too much to be tould. He jist laughed. But mind, Merlin, I. went underground yester day, jist to zee, and any tinie the ground may fall, and the men'll either be buried or jist boxed m so that they caan'f git to the engine ishaft.' - -? - ? ?'.? 'Poor old man,!' thought Merlin, as he walked back to his home; 'he's awfully cut up at not being captain, but for all that there's. no -man iij.~the county Tthat knows as much about mining as he.' ?; Then he ceased to think any more about Abraham or the mine, for he remembered the young girl. be : had .seen tiiat evening! and then all through the long night her .face seem ed to haunt him, wMle his heart went out to her in a way that he cj-uld riot understand. .
