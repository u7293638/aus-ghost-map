SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. [BY TELEQU unit (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS.) SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB AUTUMN MEETING. MELBOURNE, TUESDAY. The autumn meeting of the South Australian Jockey Club was concluded on the Flemington course this afternoon. The weather was charming, but the attendance fell short of the two previous days, and so the first race was announced to a limited number of spectators. The Vice-regal suits in attendance included Lady Robinson and Miss Robinson, from Adelaide. The racing opened with the second Hurdle Race, for which a small Hold of five went to the post, the same number being absentees. The betting underwent considerable chops and changes amongst JJcho, Minerva, and Father. The last named ultimately went out favourite. The actual result rested between Rattler and Echo, but Howitt on Tattler, about 20 yards from home, appeared to hold the Ballarat horse too cheap, for although the mare seemed to have her bit in hand, a determined dash made by Coingun just landed Echo a bare half-hour winner on the poet. Seventeen weighed out for the Ladies'' Bracelet, with Bomus as favourite at 5 to 1, and he was backed to win a good stake Later on a heavy commission was put into the market for Lantern. He left for the post most (noted, Remus having receded to 3 to I. The race to all intents and purposes was cut out for Remus, judging from the easy manner in which he won the Nursery Handicap with 7st. 4lb. last Saturday)'. Crucknoll came at the proper time, and although East Lynne looked a winner all over up the straight the Pytchley Lodge colt won cleverly by a neck. I ho bracelets were presented to the nominators of the first and second horses by Lady Robinson. The Steeplechase dwindled down to a miserable field of three horses. Colebrook had the call in the betting. The race was run at a slow pace the first time round, Blackthorn making pretty well all the running into the straight, when he died away, and Songster and Colebrook had the finish to themselves. The favourite, however, immediately had the race in hand in the final run, and won in a canter by four lengths. The whole thing jumped beautifully from first to last. The Charity Plate saw five go to the post. This number was reduced through Titania bolting. She galloped all the way back to the saddling paddock, and unshipped her jockey at the entrance gate. The race turned out a good thing; for First Pop, starting at a nice price of 2 to 1. On being put up to auction the filly was brought in at the upset price of ISO says. The meeting was brought to a conclusion by the South Australian Jockey Club Handicap. A ashore sported silk, and Britisher was the favourite at 7 to 1. The winner came from the outside division in St. John, who was most prominent all through, and ran a fast race in 2 minutes 35 seconds. He defeated Britisher by 25 lengths.
