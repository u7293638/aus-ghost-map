jpoetr?. Conscience and Futtire Judgment* BX CEL4BLES W. STCBBS. I eat alone with my conscience. In a place where time liad ceased, And we talked o? my former hying In the land where the years increased. And I felt I Bhould have to answer The question it pat to me, And to lace tha answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Wera alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my past life Wsb an awfnl thing to facr, Alone ivith my conscience silting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to be, Cut eitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave; But no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by. For it was but the thought of my paEtlife Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Had a warning of yesterday And I pray I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry in the future And no one come to eave. And so I have learned a lerson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learned in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sic alone with my conscience, In the place where thg years increase, And I try to remember the future la the land where time will ceaee. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful eoe'er it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough forme.
