BANQUET TO THE REV. FATHKR CARR. TIjc bauquct tendered to the Rev. R. J. Carr by the vesidente of the district, in conjunction with tin* members of the local Turf aud Coursing Clubs, prior to his leaving to take charge of the impoi^aut parish of Chilteru, took place ou Thursday, 11th inst, at the Mechanics' Hall. About ght- p.m., the hour appointed, the doors en? tin-own oi»cn, the Hall presenting a truly brilliant spectacle: - Ove r head were festoons of twining cvergreeus artistically arranged, while the walls were decorated; with gatlands'of the evetgvecu eucalypti; i-elieved here and; there with flags of all nations. The enrtaiu wa« for the nonce utilized as a background, iu tlie centre of whit'h hunc the national flap Ireland with the motto " 4t Cead Mille Failthe" as an appreciative adjunct, while the sid^s were rniouutcd with the British and Colonial sipus, the whole making a pleasing and attractive picture. Mr Ryan, the worthy host and caterer, had his tables arranged in quadraneular form, and right well did the Misses Ryan merit the encomiums that were lavished upon them for their excellent taste and iiBdouhted skill in arranging the viauds, fruit, and flowers with which the tables were so amply provided. Between fifty and sixty gentlemen «at down to a sumptuous repast, tntly a reclienjhe affair, and we venture to assert that for n uniticeuce acd magnificence the like has never been seen in Nagambie before. Mr E. W. Hill, president of the Turf Club, occupied the chair, with the guest of the evening (Father Carr) on his right, while. Mr P. Deane (who was deputed to make the presentation of a purse of sovereigns to Father Carr ou behalf of the parishioners) occupied bis left. Then came Councillor Gormau on one side with Councillor Healey (Waiauga shire) on the otK*r. Dr Reid, as'president of tlie Coursing Club, occupied the chair on the left quadrangle, Mr Bazeley doing duly on the right. The Chairman stated in order to allow time to those who had come iu late and had not quite finished their supi>er, and to give those who weretot-peakau oppoitunity of considering what they had to say, it was decided to open the toast Jist witd a piano and comet sol". He then called ou Mcssis Hartley and Ctdeman who gave selections ou tiie piauo and cornet. Dr K. G. Reid then apologised for the absence of Dr Carr (brother of the Rev. R. J. Carr) aud Fathers Fitzgerald and Cavauagh. The Chairman proposed the tnastof " The Queen,which was drank with musical houors. Mr E. W. Hill said he regretted being appointed to the chair ou this occasion, as he did not think he could do suliicieut justice to the position. However, he would' itsk them to charge their glasses and fill tbeui with the flowing wine,.as the to»st he about to propose was the most important of the evening, aud to do honor to il tliey ought to empty all the bottles. The toast he was about to propose was that of their honored guest—the Rev. Father Carr. He had known Father Carr for some time and had always found him a sterling gentleman in all matters appertaining to the welfare of the town and district, hi6 know- ledge of him being more particularly in coutection with the Tutf Club, but he must say that he did not have such an intimate knowledge of their guest as Dr. Rcid, who Was more closely identified with Father Carr, owing to his taking a deep interest in tiie Coursing Club. (Applause). He could with safety say that if it came to a vot* whether Father Carr was to j_"0 away or stay with as, the verdict would be in }.rvour of (Hear, hear).

Although Father Carr was going to Chilteru he did hot look upon it that he would beabsent from them always but felt sure they would oTten «ee him amougst them again, lie. therefore had great pleasure in proposing, the toast of the gue&t; of the evening—the Rev. -Father Carr. The toast was drank uith musical honors. The chairman then said he would be glad to hear any gentleman who wished to say a few words on the occasion. Cr. Healy (from Colbinabbin) on rising, was greeted"vriltr applause;' and said.'"he had travelled over 40 miles to be present that evening todo faonour to their guest. He wab sure all present were so try to lotse Father Cair, asjhe was a toast sterling man and a good priest {Hear/'ifeear).

As an instance of Father Carr's perseverance, zeal, and matchless energy, they had only to point to the two beautiful churches he had built— one at Avenel aud the other at Moorilim— both of A-hichl'.c left practically out of debt. Til the diataut future thos^ churches would be a -telling proof of the pious, zealous priest who had built them. Their rev. guest had proved himself a dear, good friend to all, and his kind visits.to the sick was sure to find a ready response in the hearts .of his grateful people, who extremely regretted he was going from amongst them, for they knew they "were losing a kind, warm-hearted friend, and a zealous gcd priest. He had very great pleasure in presenting their late pastor with a purse of sovercigus as a token of^the love aud esteem they entertained for htiti, aud would request Fattier Carr to kindly accept it as a token of mutual aOection- - between' pftest 'and people.—(Loud applause). . . . . Father Carr, in responding, thanked his flock most heartily for their kindness that day. He remarked that but for their testimonial he would be as poor a man to.day as he fifteen years ago. Tlie churches he had built—oue at Tatura, one at Moorilin, and at ATeno!—had t^ken all his money very freely, and " although receiving. a good income he always fcund a way of getting ^id of it-as quickly as he got it.

He fo'ti.nd great satisfaction at seeing -so many of liife friends present that night, and it was pleasiDg to think he would ieav« his legacy behind him Nagambie—and between man atid man he would sa-y foster it, for it was well known that all the prejudice and- bitterness in this colony was imported -here.- Where he came from in Ireland there was a superstition among a number of the people-that ghosts conld .aot cross over water, and, he would be: glad if, like . the- -ghosts, the> bitter prejudices and hostile feelings were never to cross the water..

Mr .P. Deane, responding on behalf of the agriculturists pf the district,', said that'the farmers were called the chaihptou grumblers. Perhaps they were for tliey bad indeed a let to put up with. The general depression affected them not a little, but he was pleased to think the' prospects of tne future looked somewhat reassuring, and as he - had 'implicit faithiia the present Ministry, .he was sanguine of its success in eventually accomplishing the arduous, duties that they were i unfortainately-^ompelled to adopt in order to retrieve the stability^of the country, which was apparently drifting into the vortex of hopeless siaeoWcoey;; .with ? that - abandon characteristic of a people delirious with the intoxication that reckless / extravagance generally assumes when'playing fast and loose.
