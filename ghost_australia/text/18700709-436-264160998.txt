REVIVAL MEETINGS BETTEE PBIVATE THAN PUBLIC. VERY great interest lias been taken in tbe services held by tbe Rev. Mr. TAYLOR as well by tbe general public as by tbe members of tbe Wesley an body. Large congregations attended- tbe whole series of services. On Sunday last Mr. TAYLOR preached in tbe Court-House. Albury, in tbe morning, afternoon, and evening, and a prayer meeting, at which a number of persons professed themselves to be visited by tbe Hoh- Spirit, and to be "received into Christ," concluded the labors of the daj\ The style of Mr. TAYLOR'S addresses is in a marked degree energetic, original, and forcible, and in these respects, as well as in the decided Americanism of bis language and pronunciation, his preaching is eminently in agreement with tbe practical American character. But there is a disregard of minor proprieties of language and expression which excite repulsion in conventional English Church goers. For our own part we cannot but think that too great familiarity of expression in" treating of the profound mysteries of religion tends to lessen the influence which those mysteries ought to exert upon the mind of mankind. For instance, the action of the Holy Ghost in affecting the inner nature of man, the accessibility of the redeeming waters of life," and other such subjects which Christians for ages have approached only with solemnity and awe are handled by the Rev. Mr. TAYLOR with the flippant smartness of - the pedlar in SAsr SLICE who illustrates the value of the commodities he retails by a profusion of familiar illustrations. In - this way we were reminded on Sunday that the river of life is a stream to which the Murray could not be compared—it was " none of your muddy streams" ; and the grace of God was on one occasion compared to a round of beef to which you could " cut and come again." . While doubting the general usefulness of eccentricities of this kind, which many regard as vulvar and profane, we are quite prepared to admit that they may present themselves to some minds as -illustrations which are justifiable by reason of their motive and intention, and for the vigor and striking effect with which they arrest attention and perhaps excite inquiry. But, although this SPURGEONESQUE style may gn counter to the notions of hearers who have been accustomed to the more disciplined deliverances of University graduates, it forms but the sharp angles of Sir. TAYLOR'S method of teaching, and possibly binders the diie effect of bis ministry to .no greater, extent than the rough angles of a crystal would impede its mass in rolling down a slope. The "revival" or prayer meetings which •succeed the evening services held bj- Sir. TAYLOR throughout the colonies are a marked feature, of bis ministry which invite somedegree of comment in regard to their influence upon the general public, and not, be it expressly understood, as respects their relation to the sect or congregation in whose especial "behalf they are held. T-o members of the AVesleyan body the procedure anil phenomena of these revival meetings are doubtless matters of intelligent and reverent consideration, hut we suspect that the cause of- religion sustains positive damage among persons of other denominations who attend ' these revivals under no other motive than that of mere •curiosity. To persons of this kind, trained as • they may be in the forms of their own system of religion, the efl'ect of a revival nieetin very different to the impression created oii the minds of those who have been taught to see in the excitement and menta 1 agony of the •devotees jhe _^,ij-ept, and ^sudden..action of n reforming spiritual-influence.
