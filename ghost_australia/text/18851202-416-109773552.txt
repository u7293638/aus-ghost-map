GREAT PORTER SQUARE A MYS.TEB Y. CHAPTER XVII.—In which Becky, con tinning her letter, i dales her impressions of Mrs. Preedji'syoung man lodger. ; •What I wanted now to ascertain was whether any person had heard the tapping or the scratching in No. 119, and the person I fixed upon to settle this point was Mrs. Bailey, our old .lady lodger on the first floor. If anything was going on in the next house it could scarcely have escaped her ears. • Yesterday morning while I was tidying up her room, I broached the subject. • I' wonder,' I said, whether the next house will ever be let.'; . , ' I wouldn't take it,' said Mrs. Bailey, • if they,;offered it"to; me: for - nothing a year—eh ?', • It wouldn't be a pleasant place to live in certainly,' I remarked. ' I should be afraid'of ghosts.'- , • ' Do you believe in them, eh,.Becky .-V , ' I've never seen one,' I; replied, ' but I can't help believing in' them—a little. There's one comfort—they don't trouble people who haven't wronged them. So we re all right.' . v ,' Yes, Becky, yes—they wouldn't;.come through brick walls to scare a poor old woman; eh ?' ' ' , P 'No,' I said, ' arid I've never read 01 a ghost speaking or making a noise of any kind.'• (Have.you ?' . ' 1 , . . . ' Not that I can remember, repliecUne old lady. ' . , . , . , t r ' ' Mrs. Bailey,' I said, • since the night of the murderi you : have!^npt^jheard' anything going on next door ?' - ' ' .,1 ■ ' Not a sound, Becky. It's been as ■still as a mouse.' • .' : • •"? • As a mouse,' I repeated; 'ah, but mice scratch;at walls sometimes.! ' ' So they do ; but there can|t he. any mice next door, or I should'have heard them; Nothing for" them to' eati Becky eh ?M'Micecari?t eat ghosts—eh ?'. ' No1, indeed," I'said.^'' l; hope you' are sleeping:well; Mrs. Bailey.' ' « No, lam not; Becky.' As night comes on I get a pain in my side, and,it keeps me awake for hours.' , _ • T ' What a shame 1' I exclaimed. 111 come and rub it for you, .'if, you like, \Vhen my. work's done. Were, you awake,; last night,-Mrs. Bailey ?' • rdidn?t„ close my eyes till past two this morning; too bad, eh, Becky ?' '»Indeed it is.. I hope <you .;were;notvdis turbed.'; ;■ r > - . < • * > , ' Only my side, Becky nothing else. This • conversation ! convinced:; me i - that Richard' Manx had not)heard vany such sound as .he-stated;' What'/was his purpose in endeavouring to deceive Mrs. Preedy? ' ' Theihsame day .1. was sent out- to the green-grocer's, and the \voman. said to, me that she supposed I was; not going' to stop much longer in my place.'' ! 1 'Why not?' I asked. •There>isn't..one girl.;in a thousand, said the woman, 'as'd live willing in a haunted house. Why, Becky, it's the talk of the1 neighbourhood'!' 1 ■■ ■' '■ ' ' All I can say.is,M replied, 'that -1 have heard nothing of it, and I, don't think , Mrs. Preedy;has, either.'," ; ; ■'■ Ah;Vremarked the wpman, ' they^ay you • must'go abroad'if you want to hear aqy news about yourself.' , • My dear, the woman in the green-grocer s shop spoke the truth. Before the day was out it was the talk of the neighbourhood that botli houses, Nos. 118 and 119 Great Porter Square, were haunted. When I went out last evening to write my first letter to you I was told of it by half-a-dozen people, and the policemen himself (they are all friends of mine) made inquiries as to the time and shapes in wliich the ghostly visit ants presented themselves. And to-day I liave observed more than a dozen strangers stop before our house and point up to it, .and shake their heads mysteriously. 1 Mrs. Preedy opened the subject to me this evening. ; ■■•' • 'Becky,' she said, 'there is 110 end to the wickedness of people. '' . 'That there isn't, mum,' I replied, sym PE'WhyBecky,' she exclaimed, 'have you heard what they are saying about the house ?' < ■ < 0, yes,' I said, ' everybody/ says it's haunted.' , „ «Do you believe it, Becky ? 'Not me, mum !' (Observe my grammar, my dear.) ' Not me ! Who should know 1 better than those that live in a house whether it's haunted or not ?' •That's it, Becky,' cried Mrs. Preedy, cxcitedly; 'that's it. Who should know •better than us ? And I'm sure I've never l seen anything nor heard anything. Nor you :eithcr, Becky.' , v. ' Nor me, neither, I replied. But the worst of it is, mum, mud sticks. Give a dog a bad name, and you may as well hang him at once.' t 'Now, who spread this rumour about our house being haunted > Somebody, for sure, who has a motive in giving the place a bad reputation. There is never, smoke jvithout a (ire. Shall I tell you who is the cause of all this ? Richard Manx. To iik Continued.
