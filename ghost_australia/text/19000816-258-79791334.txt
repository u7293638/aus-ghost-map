MR. SHELDON ON THE PROFESSIONS. The Bot. C. M. Stddan has been teUfrE the people of Edinburgh that, fa order .to apply the tofWnt! of Jesus Christ to four different kinds of people. viz., lawyer?, doctors, business men, and JonrnaiietB, he got leave of ab-1 sence from ids church in Topdo, and' lived a TMk With the lawyers, another] with the doctors, a third with the busi ness men, and edited a newspaper for a week. As to the lawyers, his general ccmdUEioD iras that Christianity did not influence tfaeir Uves at all, and some of the best lawyers said they did not think men. In their profession could be Christiana. He did not believe: that. He was disappointed with his week among the doctors. They never talked shout Christ; they became' hardened, and talked ahoot the human body, ""the temple of the Holy Ghost,* as if It were a bit of meat. He urged doctors to ennoble their profession. They ehonld tell patients, and partic ularly young people, of the evils of al coLol" on the hnman body. Not more than half-a-dozen business men with whem he talked In his week with them could Gay that they really tried to live a Christian life In business. They said it was not possible. He did not be-! line that, though It might mean loss ot money. He hated the word "suc cess" when applied to the success of some business men. Successful thieves he called them. In America men -who had pews In cHuch and helped to pay the pastor's salary combined to 'cor-' ner' the necessities of life. Dealing with journalism, Mr. Sheldon denied that his essay at editor of a dally was a failure. His editing was meant as an object-lesson, sot as an experiment. He had received thousands of letters jHomiBbig support to a real Christian daily if lie woald only start one. One &ty; he got 988 letters.
