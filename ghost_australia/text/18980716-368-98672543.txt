The Ghost at North Goulburn. IT was reported during the week that an un- earthly spectre, which gave forth a strange and horrifying sound, was to be seen nightly in a lonely spot at North Goulburn. After contact with the alleged supernatural visitor residents were said to have arrived home in a state of collapse, and the affair was developing into another " Fisher's Ghost." But it appears that a young man named Daly solved the mystery on Friday even- ing. He followed up the sounds, and found them to issue from a large squeaking doll dressed in white and worked with string from a culvert by undoubted human agency.
