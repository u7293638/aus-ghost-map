To the Editor of the Melbourne Argus. SIR-The inimitable Sheridan makes "The Critic" say of the players, that " when they do agree, their unanimity is wonderful " Every Representative Assembly, from the House of Commons to the Melbourne Council, is more or less a theatre, the performances more or less amusing, and the performers, " when they do agree. more or less unanimous and mutually complimentary I perceive by the newspapers, that on Thursday last, a " worthy member ' (I suppose I must speak Council wise) of your Council, moved a series of resolutions, from the tenor of which, although no man living could dis set, yet they were couched in terms which might have been infinitely improved by an amendment, retaining their full spirit and somewhat more, yet although the worthy money ' (1 suppose I must speak Council wise) thrice a week indulges in personalities to Mr Kerr, certainly not of the most saccharine softness, the latter gentleman rather than disturb the unanimity of the Council, by moving substantial reasons of his own, (and it is universally admitted that perhaps no member of the Council is so perfectly qualified to produce them as himself) preferred to warmly support and even eulogise those which had been produced, at a sacrifice which cannot be supposed to be other than of considerable personal feeling the quasi Governor of the Province may see from this how entirely his sentiments are opposed to the universal wishes of the people, whose interests are supposed to be confided to his hands He will discover that "the time has arrived when the thirty thousand inhabitants of Philhpslund (to adopt the nomenclature of the highly gifted and profoundly erudite Dr Lang) demand, Una voce, the full enjoyment of the constitutional right of appropriating their own resources, as may seem most proper to themselves by their constitutional representatives, and that any attempt to enforce opposite opinions, has only the effect of recon- curing the most jarring elements in resistance. It certainly seems strange, almost an act of political insanity (Quem Deus vult petdere, prior democrat) that the head of any Government should raise even the ghost of a question as to the perfect legality of an assembly, the elections to which he had himself recognised on repeated occasions, the legitimacy of which he had acknowledged for several years, and with which he so long corresponded without expressing the remotest suspicion of even a doubt I It certainly appears highly creditable to Mr Kerr, that in order to preserve the most perfect unanimity on this subject, he gave his best support to a series of resolutions, to amend which his acknowledged talent, experience, and public spirit, saying nothing of personal feeling, afforded him so many temptations I am, Sir, Yours, c, NEMO.
