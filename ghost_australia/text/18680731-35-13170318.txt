STRANGE, BUT NOT VV, rump . ~_ THE MYSTERY SOIJffip, ' and his captains story in the, March nuiraJer of Good Words will have more than the passing Merest of a tv well-told tale for enemy raiders is not untrue appended to the story of an 0pp(mtl0ri( challenges the ingenuity of all wring "", aiow 10 believe such marvels. 'The writer of these lines is one of those who can never dismiss a duly authenticated ghost story until he has four d some possible solution for it, having a strong conviction that the a priori objections to the JDivme permission of apparitions (at any rate for the purposes for which they are generally supposed to " make night humble") are stronger than the testimony of any one per son senses, and that a plausible explanation of such a one-night my sister y is always more credible than the support ion " of its being a supernatural event. Remembering the old anecdote of how the Merry Monarch (shrewdly suspecting that the passion for theorising is greater in most men than their patience in verifying facts) hoaxed the members of his own Royal Society, by asking them to account for the fact that a fish might be put into a vessel brimful of water without causing it to overflow, 1 might challenge the accuracy of the captain's story, and raise a doubt as to whether it was altogether . an unvarnished tale." but this would be to cut the kn it, instead of untying it. So far from doing this, I shall rely mainly upon the circumstantial accuracy of his narration, and regard the somewhat qualified voucher, " but not un- true," as merely the modest utterance of a man who is reforming what, he knows is hard of belief. The outline given of the captain s history-his thirst for ada enture, Ina romantic passion for Isabella, and his project for transporting the whole family to Ger- man), prove him to have been a man of warm sensibilities, txtuable temperament, and lively imagination. On his return to the scene of his early love, the sight of the ruined homestead would make him pain- fully sensible of his loss, and give a vivid reality to the priest's account of the fate of the family. Com- pelled to remain there for the night, his thoughts would be led back irresistibly into channels frequented long ago. Everything about the room in which he had had a sick man, tended by his beloved Isabella, became for the time an object of deep and tender interest, a link of associations to which hung memories of the past He especially mentions a sponge found in the cupboard, " hard and dry, which had often been used by Isabella for his wound, and recalling when he touched it " the minutest details." Mark these words-the minutest details of the amputation, for of that he had been unconscious, but, we may suppose, the first discovery of his loss, the tender respect shown for him in the care of the amputated limb, Isabella's preparation of the box for it its interment, perhaps by the brother, his being shown the spot when able to leave his room, and probably some reference to it by Isabella on his departure. Very likely his leaving his arm behind him, was whimsi- cally regarded by the voters as a pledge of his return. Hint piece of sponge, with the minute details it re- called to the memory of the captain, is the clue that will lead us to the solution of the mystery the raging of the storm, the loneliness of his situation, and the painful memories connected with the place, all helped to quicken thought and excite his imagination for a long time he lay awake, at last, overcome by fatigue, he sank into a dreamless sleep " Observe he calls it a dreamless sleep There is the first unconscious defence of the mind against the unwelcome idea of having imposed upon itself Depend upon it, the captain never recalls the circumstances of that night, nor tells the story, without being careful to note that it was a dreamless sleep Well, he sleeps What follows is The mind is still active about the past, and, but for the heavy sleep into which fatigue has thrown his external senses, would soon arouse him to full consciousness It is highly probable, to say the least, though he has not mentioned it, that when he touched the sponge before retiring to rest, and was so powerfully affected by the memories it awakened, be had some thought, not amounting perhaps to a positive intention, of visiting the spot where his arm was buried. It mayor may not have been 60, but the thought, if for a moment entertained, was afterwards forgotten. In sleep, however, it came, and with irresistible impulse, so as to raise him from his bed, and send him forth still asleep to the well remembered spot The box is readily found, he returns with it to his room, and deposits it upon the floor beside his bed At this moment the storm in creases, and the thunder disturbs his slumber, while the lightning illumines the room. He is sensible of the lightning, though his eyes are closed for vivid flashes can always be seen with the eyes shut. He fancies himself awake , perhaps is so for one moment, to be asleep the next. Who has not thus crossed and re crossed in an incredibly short space of time the borders of dreamland ? Then a more vivid flash lights up the room, and into the framework of the lighted chamber he projects a dream of what he had just done He fancies that Isabella's brother, dressed precisely as he remembers him, brings the box, enter- ing the room by the doorway through which he had so often seen him come into his sick chamber Both circumstances-the familiar dress and the usual way of entrance, though the latter was nailed up-indicate that memory was the painter of the scene Another trial, and he sees the apparition place the box where he himself had put it beside the bed This is too much , he starts up as a man from a nightmare, and a third gleam of lightning shows him that there is no one in the room but himself, and that the door is shut Our loving, chivalrous captain is a somnam- burst. T oxla tout Now for the reasons pointing to this as the true solution 1 that a somnambulist should attribute his own actions to some creation of his fancy is precisely analogous with our ordinary experience in dreaming We constantly imagine persons acting in a manner that surprises, delights, or terrifies us, put into their mouth arguments we cannot answer, or statements which fill us with pain and wonder, without the slightest consciousness that we are imposed upon by puppets of our own creation and management The mind multiplies its personality into all the dramatis persona placed upon the stage of fancy, and regards itself as a spectator of, or a single actor in, its own music plays This is undoubtedly one of the most singular of pay chological phenomena, and affords a glimpse of a world of latent thoughts below the sphere of re- flective consciousness. A similar story, laughable enough and founded on the same phenomena of dream- ing and somnambulism, 19 found in the Ingoldsby Legends A gentleman visiting at some house full of guests is reduced to great straits by a skeleton which every night enters his bed-chamber, and walks off with his trousers, until his wardrobe is entirely exhausted The skeleton proves to be none other than the gentleman himself, who gets up, goes down the garden in his sleep, and deliberately buries his own inexpressibles. If this story were true, it would be an illustrative case, if only invention, it as as good as true for our purpose, for Mr Barham was too good a story- teller to make the denouement of a tale of this kind turn upon an impossible occurrence 2 We may find in the narrative itself indication of a latent knowledge in the captain's mind that the box had been brought to his bedside in a natural way. How else can we explain the state of mind which he has recorded in these words 6-in spite of the connected way in which the sight of the apparition was followed by the finding of the box, I still could not believe that there was caught unearthly the occurrence, but waited quietly till the next morning to find some natural explanation " Now is it at all probable that a man who had seen a door thrown wide open one minute, which the next be found to be closely called upon he believed, moreover, that while he was lying awake the form of a man whom he knew to be dead had entered the room through this door, so mysteriously opened and closed up again, should be unable to " believe that there was caught unearthly in the occurrence " unless immediately after this strange experience he felt some indistinct consciousness of his having imposed upon himself by being the author of what he had seen? The usual, the natural order of impression would have been for him to dread something supernatural in the darkness and stillness of the night, and to refer it to some unexplained trick in the after thoughts of broad daylight His only chance of detecting the ira position he had practised upon himself, lay in carefully observing his state of mind when he first awoke. The further he got from it, the more unaccountable his experience would appear. But how about the ring on the finger ' Here is the only singular coincidence, but then it is nothing more than a coincidence It does not need the shadow of evidence for anything unearthly Had the captain found it on his build hand, upon disinterring his arm in the day-time, he would have at once assumed a natural cause for it, as that it had been put there to please the dying girl, who might think that should her lover ever return he would be pleased to find this token of her faithful attachment to him Perhaps at parting there had been a pledge given that the ring should never be given up to any hand but his own, and she had redeemed it in this way. Whatever be the explanation of this circumstance, it has nothing to do with the apparent supernaturalness of thirst occurrence, wrote The reader will judge whether the mystery is solved to vtBt? claimed for the' explanation issuSt likelihood to prove that, after all, the story may belong to things in heaven and earth that as dreamt of in our philosophy, E.
