THREE GHOSTS. TO IST EDITOB OP THE OOC1USR. SIB,—In your ksue of Saturday there appeared s letter from a correspondent describing a scene between three ghosts." Now, with yonr kind.permission, I will give him some light on the subject He does not wish Ballarat to be outdone by Russia in ghostly honors, bat be makes a mistake in believing the third ghoet vanquished. He is jrogresaug as a ghost should, where he is least suspected. He is now passing through tbe Vale of Btca, he shall shoot forth as the branch from Jesse's stem, and bis brandies shall spread forth. His beaaty shall be ss the olive tree, and bis smell as Lettoon. His .glory is Uiruo limine taXa brightness as the star from Jacob. His motto a/cart num devoir. Soch is the ghoet which Ballarat will soon bring forth, for the third ghost has held his own. though he wrestled with double numbers.—Yonra, ? C.D.Z.
