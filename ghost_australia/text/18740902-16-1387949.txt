Our Sydney Letter. SVDSKV, August 21. BOTH in town and similar) meetings and men-) makings and speechifying are still the order of the day first and foremost is Ali Pasha's, whom a particularly) lively and could dental goods dated the Sniglek mans at the agricultural dinner to "now revelation-, if the biography of Henry Parkes ' Some little time back, Sir John Robertson informed the public that one of the highest qualifications for occu paying the position of a member of the Assembly of being Minister of the Crown was the apt tude for i uniting of cattle, milking a cow, 01 ploughing a field, in all of which redeemed himself to be a proficient At the Singleton Show, Ali Parkes appears to have followed suit, for he told the company that he, too, had been an agricultural laborer, a sheep washer, and a reaper of wheat-the offer once of course being that his success in politics was made) to be attributed to his agra nan proclivities But while discs anning all knowledge of bulls whether English, Irish, colonial, 01 Papal-the Pi ends rather plumed himself upon the fact that his opinion as to the finest animals among the bulls and cows had been endorsed by his hon friend, Mr T AAlute Two other curious facts were elicited, which will probably account for the wonderful pertinacity) display) ed by the hon. gentleman in sticking to office, and his occasional ' wailing in with such signal success One revelation was that though only a tyro in the harvest field he kept his place, and suffered no one to " out him out, while at sheep we Tailing, if it was a question as to who should go in the deepest, he was, like Balkis, always willing ' Ali Parkes rather affects this style of harangue in country v districts, thinking, I suppose, to endear himself to the people from the fact of his having risen from the people to his present high position I recollect some little time back he addressed his constituents at Kiama after the same fashion -"I have worked at manual labor till the blood has gushed from an) fingers Stud) tomlins cences of this kind are sufficient to bind me to the people. The Premier has now gone south, and we shall doubtless ere long heal some of his Uti erina utter slices Next on the list of out political travellers is Mr G A Lloyd who appealed before the citizens of New castle last we neck, and after being consulted for his indifference as their representative to the wants of the people as to the harbor of mt very cleverly) got out of the difficulty by id putting that it was a burning shame that no) ship should come into the Newcastle hut here and be detained eight weeks waiting for cargo adding that 'if how at of not a member of the Government he would go so far, perhaps, as to say that it did not reflect much credit upon the Government. It will, of course, be highly satisfactory to the public of this colony to learn that the presence of Mr George Alfred Lloyd reflects such lustre upon an) Government of which, he in a) be a member as to and case the credit 01 respectability) of that Government and cause it to be beyond suspicion I do not think it necessary by to chronicle all the sayings and doings of the other Ministers and members of Parliament who have gone on then "stalling engagements in the provinces as ltvvouldiieithei profit nor pleasure dear readers We have, however, had some people that public meetings lately) in Sydney, to one in two of which I must refer A very large and influential meeting of the friends and supporters of the Church of England Denomination ii Schools was held this week, the Bishop of Sydney) being in the chin The speech of the chairman was, while thoroughly conciliator and pacific, ov month) in favor of direct ill) administered Dciionunitioinilisin Bishop Du Roi expressed himself as crime el) opposed to the "seeulai,coiiipuluoiy, and fi co education system, about which some little outcry) has been made lately, and, as it is generally believed, for the simple purpose of making political capital out of it. At this meeting The speaker denounced the compulsory) puts on liifniigoinent of our civil 1 lights, and an enter for sale without tell gious coin actions The chairman said I to have the public school system is capable of extension, expulsion, and luigi ov lenient, and that the efforts of all friends of education should be directed towards this Uns latter is precisely the line of argument adopted by the 1 ith of the Education Act, Ali Pill keys in his speech to his friends and supporters the other evening Mr Parkes, however at the same time give a good wholesome counsel, that it would not be expedient to alter the present educational 6) stem at all) degree, unless it could be, in the first place conclusively proved that such change was absolutely necessary, and for the public benefit Altogether, the whole case was very badly laid before the public at this meet mg, and there was throughout an absence of sectarian bitterness that was high!) commend- able At St Tar) pro Cathedral and) numerously) attended meeting was held this we k to i cecil of the annual report of the new Cathedral of Building Committee the report of the treasurer was highly satisfactory as it appeared that after expending some £12 n £13,000 up to the present date, there was still a very considerable balance to the credit of the Bull Ring Committee for meeting the next contract to the balance a large amount about £2000-wosadded at the conclusion of the meeting through the liber ally of the Archbishop, the Coadjutor Archbishop, P A I tailings and other members of the Catholic communion A meeting of some forty five members of the Bat took place on Saturday last, at the Attorney General's room, for the purpose of discussing met with grievances to which the profession, has for some little time been subjected The unanimity with which the following resolutions were passed speaks well for the entente cordiale of using at the present time among the barristers : (1.)
