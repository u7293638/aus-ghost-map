The first settled upon a sausage of singularly appetising appearance, and made a hearty meaL But he speedily died of intestinal inflammation, for the sausage was adulterated wi\h aniline. The second fly breakfasted upon flour, and forthwith succumbed to contraction of the stomach, owing to the inordinary quantity of alum with which the flour had been adulterated. The third fly was slacking his thirst with the contents of the milk jug, wheu violent cramps suddenly convulsed his frame, and he soon gave up the ghost, a victim to chalk adulteration. Seeing this the fourth fly, muttering to himself, 'Tho sooner it's over the sooner to sleep,' alighted upon a moistened sheet of paper exhibiting the counterfeit presentment of a death's head, and the inscription ' Fly Poison.' Applying the tip of his proboscis to this device, the fourth fly drank to his heart's content, growing more vigorous and cheerful & every mouthful, although expectant of nis end. -But ho did not die. On the contrary, he throve and waxed fat. Tou see, even the fly poison was adulterated 1" Medical Record." —" New fork ?
