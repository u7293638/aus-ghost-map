He was speaking to her in tho parlor just before he went away. You will probably find her there yet.” ' “Somewhat wondering who this Lady Buford was, the rector followed the ball boy into the parlor. It was deserted' save by' a tall, richly-dressed lady, who was standing at the window, gazing at tile-busy scene in tho attcet below.
