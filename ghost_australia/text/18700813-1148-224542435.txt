Sirâ€” The puerile attempts of your vindictive contemporary the soi disvant Protestant Advocate to weaken the influence Catholics are daily getting are unworthy of notice, and I am sorry that 44 Cobbett's Ghost" should have referred to them. They remind one of boys shooting arrows at the sun, and although they do not the least affect that luminary they amuse the hoys. I would like, however, to ask both your correspondent and readers not to judge all Protestants by the trash which weekly appears in the columns of that 44 Catholic reviler," because there are many who have too much sense to be gulled by the misrepresentations there to be found, and who have a better opinion of their Catholic neighbors than to believe them guilty of one-thousandth part of the crimes which money-loving men delight- to accuse them of, as a means of replenishing their coffers. I am. &e..; READER.
