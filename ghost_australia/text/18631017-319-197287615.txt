Mysterious Affair. — Pepper's ghost is beaten by. a real, substantial ghost, now living occasionally at Smeaton, and, spectre-like, sometimes changing his residence to Kingston. The following brief out line will throw some light on the subject : — On Sa turday, the 22nd November last year, an inquest was held on the body of James Smith, a gardener, aged 53 years, unmarried. Mr Anthony Dockerythen gave evidence that he had laioym the deceased for the last eight months, that he (deceased) had left his employ about three months ago, and had seen Richard Jones identified the body. Dr Eoche ex amined the body, and found, two scalp wounds, which, as he stated, might have been occasioned by a fall. The skull was uninjured. He believed the body of deceased to have been in the water more than a fortnight. Constable Gowon deposed that he had searched the body, found a knife, a purse and a shilling on his person. From the position in which the deceased was found, the constable believed that he had fallen from a rock 15 feet high into the creek'. The following verdict was returned : — 'Deceased was found drowned on the 21st November, 1862. The jury are of opinion that he was accidentally drowned about two weeks ago.' It hasv subsequently turned out that the man alluded to is not dead, but alive, and that he has been seen moving about in good health, by several persons who know him well, and who have not the least doubt about his identity. The body of the de ceased man having been in the water for about a fortnight, there is no doubt that the features, by the time the inquest was held, had undergone such an alteration as easily to mislead the witnesses, and, as no other individual in the neighborhood was missing at the time, a verdict of the jury was returned in accordance with, the evidence. We hear that steps are being taken to clear up, if possible, this mysterious affair, and to obtain a clue as to the identity of the man who is really dead, and whose remains wore taken for those of James Smith, the gardenor. As ten months have now elapsed since the inquest was held, the exhumation of the body | if ordered — would, we believe, not furnish much additional information. Since the above is in type, we learn that Mr W. B. Lees, the district coroner, roceived an official intimation from the police, through Constable Willdnson, confirming our re marks as to the existence of James Smith, the man referred to. It appears that, prior to the in quest being held, a warrant for his arrest was issued, and thus explains why Smith kept out of tho way. The report alluded to has been forwarded to the Attorney-General, who, very likely, will order further Btops to be taken in tho mattoi',— Creswich Advertiser, Ootobox1 14.
