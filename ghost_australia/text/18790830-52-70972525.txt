Good-Mght. GOD koop you safe, my littlo Iovo, All tb.ro' tho night ; Rost oloso in His encircling arms Until tho light. My heart is with you as I kneel to pray ; Good-night ! God keop you in His caro alway. Thick shadows creep liko silent ghosts . About my hoad; I lose myself in tender dreams, While overhead The moon comes stealing thro' tho window-bars, A silvor sickle gleaming 'mid tho stars. For tho' I am far away, Feel safe and strong To trust you thus, dear love-and yet Tho night is long I say with sobbing heart tho old fond prayer, Good-night! Sweet dreams ! God koop you every where !
