V.R.C Autumn Meeting. [By Telegraph.) [From our Special Correspondent.] Melbourne, March 10. Several of the Newmarket Handicap horses put in an appearance at Flemington this morning, but no sensational gallops con- <*> curred or indeed anything to assist the solution of the morrow's problem. Over the short distance course Baron yon Mueller went as well as anything, and there seems to be a growing tendency to favor his chance in the result. Josephine, Lar pent, Ventare, Lohengren did the best sprats of the morning. There is every probability of an immense field coming to the post for the Xewmarket Aspen, Billingate, Quick silver, and Culwyn are tfw only hones not paid up for the issue, which I fancy will rest between Creuiome and Hyacinth, with Largout and Aureola possessing good shows. Among the others for a straight out selection I shall abide by Cremorne. Sly remaining selections are as follows:— Nui«ery Handicap, V&ndeuse;, Jaak-ut-the t.'reen, Sjlvanus ; Town Plate, PfeU MeU; All-aged Stakes, Navigator: Steeplechase. Roebuck; Three and Four Year Old HandT cap. Commotion or Sweet William. The latest betting is as follows: —New- market Handicap, 5 to 1 against Ghost, 7 Hesperian, 8 Larpsnt, 30 each Sweet William, Battburst, Sir Joseph. Surrey, Joseph, Verdure, .Somerset, Tyro pean, Hyacinth, and Cremorne. The above-named are the only horses backed legitimately.
