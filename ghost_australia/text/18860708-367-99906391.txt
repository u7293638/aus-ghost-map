_;::"..THE FORSAKEN FAiRMHOUSE. Anssazr the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of a deadl home, starieg through Its broken lights on wasted Inude Where old-time harvests grew. Unplouighed, unsown, by scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm.lields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. Of helthful herb and flower bhoreft, The garden plot no housewife keeps; Through weoods nod tanglie only lift S The snoake, its tenant creeps. A lilao spray, once blossom-clod, Sways bare beflore tlhe empty rooms; IBeside the roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in monid and dust of drouth, On floor and Ihearth tho squirrel leaves, And in the fireless chimney's mouth Bis wob the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall lesounds no more on hunking oves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresler beats his slcaves. So sad, so drear ! It seems almost Some Ihaunting Piresence makes its sign; That down yon lshadowy lane some ghost Miglht drive hIis spectral kine I -JoBhn G. lhittiier.
