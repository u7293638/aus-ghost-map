Mr Bobert Louis Stevenson, the well known author, has, according to recent ??? ndvices, made up his mind to live and die ??: ?? :'?'? in his Samoan paradise. His home is two ? miles from Apia, on the island of TJpolu, ?'' ???; and the site of the house was, when he 'f-'i: bought it, a virgin forest, through which the foot had never trod. The house faces on the sea; about it are the great leaves ' of the cocoanut, palm, and bread fruit trees, within it all that civilisation can furnish to minister to. creature comfort. ': ' ' ' One who had visited Stevenson there two months ago says : — 'He is still very thin '''['and '.fragile; his shoulders are bent, and .' ,': his ohest seems hollow. But his voice is '' strong and hearty, and his grasp firm. His, , , 'complexion has lost its deathly whiteness; ' ': and. is now a heatthy bronze. He _ still ? ? wears his hair long, and his delicate effeminate mouth is shaded by a drooping moustache. His eyes, too, seemed to be Half closed arid dreamy, and he talks with a slow, languid drawl.' He believes he v i has : found a safe haven from consumption .'.:??? at the island of (Jpolo, and hopes to liveto ' a ripe old age. He has no thought or care ?? '- for .affairs on the other side of the globe. If there should be a massacre of Europeans at Samoa because of the heavy taxes iin ';??'?' posed '; ori the natives, he' has no fear of ?'??perspnal injury, for he believes that the ? ;!:;;nativesrespectaridtr'usthim.

A well informed American' has met 'the ^'assertion, of a London journalist that the'.: American magazines were fast losing their' enormous circulations, -as ? follows : — ' All , the leading magazines are making money, \- ?? 'j-while'aslate as two years ago this was not 1 the'- fact. '? ?' Soribner's, for example, has \- -jumped from 90,000 to an actual circular \- tion of 120,000 copies each month. The ? Century holds its own as between 180,000 : -and 190,000 copieB every month. Harper's never changes, and prints close on to ; 150,000 of each iesue. The Cosmopolitan, ''which a year ago had Ecarcely 30,000, has ? to-day 90.000 in circulation. The Ladies' '' : Home Journal has leaped from 400,000 to ; within 100 of lOOflOO copies each month. ??' Lippincott's is stronger than it ever was in . ? ' point of circulation. The North American :??'??'? Review never printed so many oopies as it ? does to- day.

They \- are exactly the reverse of the actual facts. ? ???' There died recently at Wiesbaden, at the : age of 80 years, a much-esteemed German ? authoress, Amely Bolte, who began her \- .literary »areer when living in London as a '' governess, by writing essays on English literature and English manners for German papers. She received encouragement from \- ?'??'?' Carlyle and Varnhagen, returned to ? Germany in 1851, and wrote for Gutzkow'B periodical.
