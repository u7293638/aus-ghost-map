THE STORYTELLER. BLACK BUT BEAUTIFUL. By BERNARD. I "JuJian Hazel to take charge as resident engineer at Tadmor." The Minister for Public Works read in la thoughtful undertone from a document on liie omce table. The office was carefully lighted and beautifully furnished, as befitted a Minister of Gotham, which is the capital city of a certain Australian colony. In imagination the Minister saw the selected [engineer for Tadmor seated in bis rude- hes sian office in the far north, working under conditions so trying that the official heart felt a human pang. "To Tadmor," repeated the Minister. | angering his pen. for the document awaited his signature. ' Have you any particularly bad reason, Williamson, for getting rid of this very good man ?" Williamson was the Minister's brother in-law, and was Something Very High in the P.W.D. He frowned and 6aid irritably, "Well, Langley's the alternative." "No one else?" asked the Minister, for Mr. Langley was going to marry his eldest daughter. "Kaytree. It's time he had a hard turn, for he's had 'soft' things long enough, but his mother would be certain to go to her brother, the Premier, and make a row about her son s going to live amongst blacks, cro codiles, and fourteen different forms of fever." "It's an awful place, but someone's got to make straight the jungle paths." The Minister sighed, and signed, and pre sently asked, "liazel's predecessor there died, didn't he?" "les, and his predecessor. You are very cheerful company to-day, sir. After all, it's a compliment to be selected for the Tadmor post"—he smiled grimly—"if Hazel could only see it. We pick the strong-willed, level-headed, resourceful men for such j posts." "Yes, and when they come out, if they , do so alive, soured, dispirited, ana broken [ with fever and overwork^ we put them aside, because tbc-y are Out of date." "It's the liver, murmured Mr. Wil liamson, "these cold nights and hot days " So the Gotham rulers bade J ulian Hazel clear the bush, drain swamps, level moun tains, construct tanks, make surveys, keep down expenses, and send in monthly re ports. When the young man got notice of liis new appointment he cursed the Gotham P.W.D. for an hour, until his lips were dry. Then he had a drink, and sat down to write to the girl he loved. He and she had been engaged for five years, and though the wives of other officials in Hazel's former districts had shared their husband's hessiau houses, Ethel's mamma would not hear of her daughter doing likewise. Now this Tad mor billet put, as Hazel wrote, the jasper vault on the horror. The pluce was not fit for a white man, let alone a very highly civilised white girl. When Ethel got the letter she said she would continue to wait. She was only 22, and her majiuna would never hear of her going to such a horrid place as Tad mor. She had heard that the mosquitos there were enormous. Hazel had hoped that the girl would ai least offer to accompany him. There was a camp on a hilltop, known as "Excelsior," 40- miles from future headquarters. It was a kind ol> sanatorium, and he had thrown out hints about her living there for a few months in the year, and he could come to see her from Saturday night to Monday morning. Ethel said it would be too awful to think of Julian travelling all Saturday afternoon, under that terrific Tadmor sun, just to spend a day with her, and leaving at some unspeakable hour in the morning without a proper breakfast, or a flower in his coat. No, she would not be selfish, &c.; So Hazel went up to his district, and settled to work, and, between attacks of fever and ague, tried to keep at bay the ever-recurring thought that life was an accursed thing. There was a mail from Gotham every fortnight. The man who brought it travelled in a buckboard buggy, drawn by four brumbies. He had a black driver. A large white umbrella, lined with green, was fastened to the back seat. The mail carrier always spent a night in thd engineer's quarters. He was cultured, and quite fitted to fill a much higher position than that he occupied; also, he was quite fitted to empty many bottles, and with him Hazel would sit and yarn and nip. and nip and yarn, almost the whole night through. Men who live in the God-for gotten districts have a pathetic, womanish craving for the companionship of their social equals. And the mail-carrier was a gentleman. Up to noon on Sunday, Hazel would read what he post had brought him, then he ate his dinner of tinned food, and settled down to pour out his heart in ink to Ethel. He would have eased off in the matter of love letters after a time if there had been any white female society to give him tea ana sympathy in darkened hessian sitting rooms, while the earth without split from heat, and the sun was darkened with dust storms. At dawn of every week day, he went abroad on a high bony horse, or a little riding camel, dressed in khakee breeches and singlet and solar helmet. Already the gangers were rounding up the navvies, who were mostly Italians or other foreigners. When autumn came, the Government sent up a doctor, two wardsmen, and a dis penser, for 20 per cent, -of its employes were ill, or dying of various kinds of fever or internal troubles. Some of the works contemplated proved more difficult and scattered than had been anticipated, so presently Hazel applied for an assistant, and to nim was sent one Stansell, a fine, promising voutb, fresh from a University, with a good deal of theoretical training. He took to the practical work like a retriever to water, and the engineer took immensely, to him. In fifteen days from the date of his ar rival, Stansell was dead, and Hazel bad read the burial service over him. « * # * * * I When Julian Hazel was a child, his governess used to set-him as a slate copy the headline, "Melancholy 4a the Enemy's plaything.". The little boy had not the ghost of an idea what "melancholy" signified, but he hated it, because he would forget and put two l's in it, and be "kept in lO mfhutes." The "enemy" also meant nothing to h'm but the fact that he was weak in capital E s. Before the autumn waned, the ph™®®J > come out of the Past, and ti,e i hiin horribly. While Stansell vas / j > engineer had done with ahout tlir sleep a week, for he helped to nurse too ! ygunger man, apd kept a grip on the extra ft r,s jr'ttej. irtir «• ziir.ti***. »K»nv > *a»tRi srt?!# *^-r s*.'#r - i'-f-r -nj; -i -iawB^E ta* -twrrKM'ueic r. w» '.TU-r- *<*».♦. * £5> JU s»f^" . <»• ..vi»»rt ■ • ■'- «**_ Winr- j«n»- ;• &c; -i -U; ..{ r,u, #r-_ Sfiinsrr ivin ?'■ •:. •■_. :->*« I. gcr«r- «< *zxr*+ r -..r sjr.i ;_it a* .vrrri-; it- -?•<" \j- -i: •■-».
