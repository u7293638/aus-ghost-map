THE Y.R.C. AUTUMN MMHING. First Day. — Newmarket Handicap. Ky Telegraph. I From our own Reporter. Melbourne. March 1. The first day of the Autumn Meeting of the V.R.C. was thinly attended in conse quence of the inclement weather. It rained all through Friday night and looked so siozmy in tne morning that many retrained from making a journey to Fieniington. The lawn received very scant patronage, and at no time during the afternoon was the Stand half-tilled, although no rain fell after 10 o ciock. The going was rendered very heavy by the previous night's downpour, aad with the exception of the Hopeful Stakes all the races were very slow. Early in the afternoon the well-known Adelaide book maker, Mr. \V. A. Wood, was put off the course as a defaulter. It seems he lost heavily backing horses in Tasmania, aad had not been able to settle up to Saturday. His creditors refused to give him any more time, so he was declared a defaulter, and removed from the paddock by a V.R.C. detective. When betting opened on the Essendon Stakes Malua wa3 made an even money chance, but when he was seen walking about- he was observed to be lame behind, and before the flag fell Commotion was in better demand. The race was run at a stron g pace, and at the home turn Commotion went to the front, with Malua in pursuit, and as they swept into the straight the latter appeared to be coming so fast that his victory was loudly proclaimed, but it was only a flash in the pan, for he could never get within cooee of Commotion, who won easily by four lengths. Malua pulled up lame, and is not likely to run again for some time to come. Fearing that the penalty might atop Monte Christo in the mud, Mr. White deter mined to start Uralla as well as : the colt in the Ascot Vale Stakes. The result proved unfortunate, as Monte Christo was quite equal, to settling the pretensions of l)unlop,*but his defeat by UraUa raised a dis turbance on the flat, and a number of roughs congregated round the weighing stand and hooted as the colt returned to scale. There was not the slightest reason for the demoa stration, as it was apparent to every one who watched the race closely that Uralla had the verdict in baud a long way from home, and she might have won by several lengths if it had been necessary. The followers of Silver King laid odds on their colt for the Leger, and having the pa.ee of his opponents at the end of a slow run race he got home cleverly. It was a very nretty finish, but the winner did not show that wonderful superiority to the rest of the three-year-olds which his admirers claim for him. The whole of the thirty coloured for the Newmarket Handicap weighed out in good time. There were some chopB and changes in the betting at the finish, but Coronet was universally liked. I'romZtol he came to 4 to 1, a lump of money beinsc entrusted to him in the paddock. Sir Garnet moved very gingerly when his plates were taken off, and perhaps he would have run better with them on, as his feet seemed very tender. PrometheuB, Sheet Anchor, Welcome J ack, iBattailoas, and Leporello were all much admired when saddled up, and taken all round it was the finest field ever stripped for a Newmarket Handicap. Cracknell was very late in weigh ing, and the others had to wait fully hve minutes for him at the post. The different incidents of the race are detailed elsewhere. Coronet swerved from one side of the course to the other, but still he had the race won a furloDg from home, though had a stronger rider been on Middlemarch the finish might have been very exciting. Sheet Anchor ran well, and so did Leporello and Sir Garnet, but the latter, like Coronet, loBt a lot of ground through not Bteering the straight course. The Messrs. Robertson backed Coronet for between £30,000 and £40,0C0, and they have now got back all the money they have lost to the Ring during the season. Crackneil comes in for £1,500, and all the followers and connections of the stable win good stakes, the owners of the horse having displayed great liberality in putting every one on the good thing of the season. Matchlock was made the medium of a plunge in the Hopeful Stakes, but he was beaten from the fall of the flag, and to the surprise cf her owner and trainer Juanna, though Ehe was not backed for one shilling, von easily in remarkably fast time. The victory of Juanna was rather galling to her party, as although not supported in the face of Matchlock, the filly was declared equal to the task of winning a Nursery Handicap at the end of the meeting. Happy Thought and Little Sister were heavily backed for the Brunswick Stakes, but they were out in the cold at the finish, and after Madcap had looked like walking in Grace Darling cut her down very easily on nearing home. The following are the results : — ESSENDON STAKES. ' A. sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, h.ft., with 250 added ; 200 sovs. and all the,sweepstakes for the first horse, 30 for the second, and 20 for the third. Weight for age. One and a half miles. Hon. \V. Pearson's b.h. Commotion, by Panic — Evening Star, 6yrs., 9 st. 3 lb. (Power) .. .. 1 Mr. J. O. Inglis's b.h. Malua, 5 yra., 9 st. 3 lb. (Robertson) ? .... 2 Mr. S. Martin's b.c.

Off Colour, 4 yr3., 9 st. (Moore). Betting— 5 to i agsfc. Commotion ; 7 to i agsfc. Malua ; 5 to 4 agst. Off Colour. The flag fell to a moderate start, Off Colour, Com motion, and Metal being the first to get on their legs, but rounding the turn Plausible, who was left at the post, ran through his field and took a length lead of Metal, with Commotion four lensrths off third and just clear Off Colour, the field beins ?whipped in by Malua, who was quite a hundred yards behind the leader. This order was pretty well maintained as they ran along the river, but at the bridge Metal got his head in front of Plausible, and Commotion and Off Colour drew nearer, while Reginald and Malua also improved their positions. Past the abattoirs and sheds Metal and Plausible ran abreast, but at the half- mile post Commotion left Off Colour, and join ing the leaders at the turn, he entered tli9 straight clear of Plausible, while Malua was now seen coming on the outside at a great pace. Power sat down and drove Commotion along to Seep out of his old rival's way, and the old champion racing on, he won easily by 'four lengths, Malua being eased at the finish. Two lengtb.3 off Reginald beat Plausible and Off Colour by a head for third place, while Metal can tered in last. Time, 2 min. 47J sec3. THE ASCOT VALE STAKES. ; A sweepstakes of 20 sots each, £6 10s. ft., with 6S0 added ; 500 .sots, and all the sweepstakes for the first horse, 100 for the second, and 50 for the third.

Lady Claudia, by The Drummer— Camilla, 8 st. 7 lb. (O'Brien). Betting- 5 to 4 on Monte Christo, 3 to 1 agat. Uralla, 5 to 1 agst. Dunlop. Alter one fake start the flag dropped with the six on very even terms. From the Stand Antonio apreared to be leading, Dunlop coming to the tan, with Monte Christo and Dralla well up in the centre. Antonio looked to be going well until entering the course proper, when he collapsed, and Mr. White's pair went to the front. The favourite appeared to hold a slight advantage till the entrance to the lawn, when Uralla drew along and won cleverly by half a length. Duclop was a bad third, with Lady Claudia fourth,' Antonio fifth, and Buttress last. Time, 1 min. 2L'r sec. The following'^ a list of the winners of the Ascot Vale Stakes :- Vr. !

Welcome Jack, Coningsby, Middlemarch, Topaz, md Mirrey, 83 to 1 each agst 8t John, Mascotte, Marie Louise, and 40 to 100 to 1 agat the others. There was some delay as the post owing to the fractiouaness of Mascotte and one or two others, but at last the flag was dropped to an even start, the onlv horses that did not net off well being Velocipede and Mistake. The first to break the line was Duenna, who took a slight lead of Mascotte, Town Moor, and Hannibal on the far side, with The Ghost showing prominently in the centre, and Coronet on the Stand side. Sir Garnet swerved badly directly after starting, and lost ground, while Coningsby was all over the course. As they came on. Town Moor, on the rails, was seen in front, with Hannibal, Mas. cotte, Westbury, and Sir Garnet in dose attendance, while on the right Coronet, The Ghost; Sheet Anchor, md Leporello were going well, but Prometheus was never visible among the leaders. They crowed the tan without much change of position, bnt coming on to the course proper Town Moor surrendered to the two blacks, Hannibal and Westbury, while Sir Garnet was Well up near the rails, with Sheet Anchor and The Ghost in the centre, and Coronet tacking across from the sand side next. As the distance a great change had taken place, as Coronet, despite his steering right across the track, was clear in front from faheet Anchor, Sir Garnet, and The Ghost, and the race seemed all over until Middle march came with a very late run, and catching the leader band over band, Cracknell had to sit down and ride to get home a clever winner by three parts of a length. Half a length off Sheet Anchor was third, and a length from him came The Ghost, Sir Garnet, and Leporello, heads separating the three. Some distance divided the next batch, and the lot were whipped in by Alphabet, Mistake, and Velo cipede. Time, 1 min. 19} sec.
