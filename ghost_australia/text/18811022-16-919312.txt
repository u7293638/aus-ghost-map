Amusements. " Hamlet.' THERE was a rather better house at the theatre last night to witness " Hamlet. ' In noticing this performance it is necessary to preface our remarks by saying that Mr Dewhurst's concep- tion of the characper is evidently quite different from that order only presented It is usual to represent the Prince of Denmark as a young man full of noble impulses, anxious to do right, but of weak mental fibre, so that throughout the play the dread task imposed upon him weighs down his soul, and if it does not actually madden him, at least tortures his whole being The wildness of his outbreaks are in indications of the mental storm ruling within This is the usual conception, but Mr Dewhurst's Hamlet is a man of quite a different stamp Strong in mind, as in body, his purpose grow a upon him, and his engines are deliberate the part which he has cooly determined to play, and is playing To such a man for breach with Ophelia is not heartrending, and Lacitis was quite right in his warning to his trade r, for with Mr Dewhurst a Hamid line would be more of a diversion than the governing motive of life Whether this col ce lion is the right one or not we are not now ci accrued to inquire, but it must be acknowledged that Mr Dewhurst carries it out. Such a man won a seam the dotard Polonaise, and allow no qualifying touch of pity for 0] hchas father to lessen the sentiment Accordingly Mr Dewhurst is uniformly bitter in his plea to the old man, and the look of concentrated contempt with which he rebukes Polonius when be interrupts the player with his comments is-from this point of showery fine Even when he draws the curtain to look upon the old man's body there is nothing but coldness in the tone with which he pronounces the line Thus far begins on 1 worse remains behind t Still keeping up the same c inception, he is rough and almost brutal in the scene with Ophelia There is passion rather than love in the embrace he gives her, not the clinging touch mess of the Hamid we have been accustomed to boo When by a natural gesture he allows the audience to see that he has dm covered the watch set upon him, there is very real bitterness in the wild wilds with which he continues the interview He wishes Ophelia with his camera, taking a savage di light in thus chaBtiBing what he sup or b to be her deliberate treachery But an ltitonsiateiicy j follows When he re-enters the renate cured his instructions to the players he picks up the casket Ophelia Ina returned to him, which is lying on the fl or, and Francs it Mr Dewhurst's Ilamht would not have done this The advice to the player is exceedingly well given, and indeid- nt-sutiung Mr Dewhurst's conception of the territory to be a correct one, as also are most of the hoMe pin The interview with Qutldcmlcii and Americans is very natural Tina Hamid find no difficulty in playing apart, and he admits the friendly tone with complete success The idea of sending the second act seated at the table and beginning to write the lines intended to be spoiled by the players, makes the itch n suit the words Another innovation introduced by Mr Dewhurst is in the commencement of the well known To be or not to 1 u He enters musingly, idly lingering his dagger, and flour tiny it in most unconsciously at his brear, thus giving the keynote to the idea of suicide which is running through his brain But even from Mr D whurst a point of view, the interview with the Ghost was bad-V least when the latter speaks Hamlet sinks to his knee at the announcement I am Li) f tie i s soul but rising afterwards continues the interview with no sense of the supernatural No no in under such circumstances would oinphaHino li is to me to know t 11 at I death was gd ns uttift, As retaliation, or the thoughts of love, "VI by mishap to his motive with an oratorical flourish of his sword. In fact it is rather as in a colloquy between two men, than as a mortal receiving message from beyond the grave that Hamlet corufortB himself Miss Brandon played Oj helm, and considering her inexperience, fairly well Mrs Palmer b Queen and Mr Palmer b Polonius were performances far above anything that we have recently seen in that character Mr Jin-ford, as King, is as usual correct, but introduces a new reading which he would do well to discard At the climax of the play scene lie rushes forward, and with his own hands draws the curtain to hide the stage There is no warranty in the text for this, and it is the last thing that the Inn; would have done Mr Modus is over weighted as Horatio, but does his best, and Mr Inglis ns Laertes has been already noticed Mr Raynor was solemn and effective as the Ghost To night Mr Dewhurst plays " Macbeth, and the programme for the coming week is never Used It is to be hoped he will have more encouraging houses His performances have been 1 Hely criticised, but this has been denied because he is an actor worth criticism Brisbane play goers have been compelled to witness the performances of many who were beneath it The Circus The circus was well attended last night, and the whole performance was favourably received by the audience. The most interesting and amusing part of the evening a t entertainment consisted in the performance of Miss Rosie, and in the really clever, and pleasing, musical treat on the hand bells, by the Brothers Matthews The dummy clown (Moxon) was, as usual, in great force, and caused quite as much amusement as two or three of the older style the lion's den was again entered by Mr Darling and there can be no doubt that he displays great boldness in what is generally but absurdly looked upon as a very uncomfortable position Mr O'Brien as the "Sailor Boy" also went through a number of feats on horseback very creditably This afternoon there will be a matinee performance specially arranged for the convenience of families, and there will also be a performance in the evening. The afternoon performance ought to be well attended, as there is not much chance of its being repeated.
