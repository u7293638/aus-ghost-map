In regard to tlie new Parliament, it was well to ask what the character of that Parliament was, ior upon the character of Parliament depended the character and tone of the municipal and other institutions in the community. It was essential that we should have a Parliament winch Bhould be able to discuss great questions ufteetinc the life and the permanent weltare of the nation. Having this object in view, he was glad to say that tlie attempt that had recently been made to rev ive the old part) distinctions had utterly failed (Hear, hear) The attempt to raise those old ghosts of the past had ended m utter lailurc " Lot the dead past bury its dead ' The questions raised by the people of Vic- toria years ago were eettled and past, and they bud to do now with the present and with the future. Strange to say, they found that every man in the present Parliament was a " Liberal " There was not one mern her who avowed nimself as ft "conservative, ' and not one had gone in ns a "radical." They were all now constitutional liberals " (Laughter ) The fact was that the two old parties - the constitutionalists and the liberals-bad become solidl) fused together (Ueur, hear ) It was no longer a ooah tion - it was an absolute fusion of parties, nnd until some new principle nrose which would call forth a difference of opinion, and cause people to tuite sides once moro on new issues, winch, at the present moment, could not be foresten, we must remain, us he hoped we Bhould remain for years to come, a united people, interested onlj in promot- ing the material progress of the colon!. (Applause.) Hint was the character of Parliament as a »hole But take the Parliament itself, and divide it into the Ministerial Bide und the Op position side - because there was an Opposition, but what an Opposition I (Laughter ) It »as the most curious Opposi- tion, surely, that liad ever been seen in any country under Parliamentary Government lhere was at lirBt nota single mun Bitting on the Iront bench of that Opposition Ihe Opposition met ¡n caucus, and they felt so ashamed at the idea ot leaving their front bench empty that they resolved to lill it, und how did they fill it* Hie usual wav »as for the members ot an Opposition to agree upon certain principles or lines ot action, mid Belect their leaders accordingly, but nothing of the kind was done in this case No par- ticular part ot the Ministerial policy was as-lulled, but it happened that there were B'vera I ex Ministers in the Opposition, mid it was resolved that these ex Ministers should occupy the vacant front bench. They evidently sinipl) enid to themselves, "We are not in the Government, and, I here lore, we are in the Opposition " (Laughter ) Ï lint was a very good thing, and it showed that this coalition and fusion allowed the Ministerialists and the Opposition to select the best men ni the Asseinbl) us their leaders. The) were entitled, therefore, to ex- pect to see good leadership in the Opposition ; und it the centlemun w.'io did duty as lender on the lir.it day ot meeting »as to be appointed to that position, he (Mr. Service) was quita sure they would hud the Opuosition conducted honour îbly and straightforwardly ni the present Parlia- ment (Hear, hear ) Nevertheless, it re mained true that the leaders ot the Opposi tion at the present time were, to use tin old phrase, Bimply "a fortuitous concourse of Parh imentury atoms ' (Laughter) Ihey simply stud in effect " We aie out, we want I tobe in" (Hear, hear ) He was pleased to hear that the Government intended to bring in new rules of procedure. The question of obstruction »as one which must be dealt with Because matters seemed just now to be quiet and peaceable, it wits all the more reason that the Uot eminent should BCire the opportunity to submit such altera tiona m the Btunding orders ot Pnrhiment as would enable business to be conducted in a lair wa) (Applause. ) It must be taken out ot the power of a single member ot Parlia- ment to cause the House to be cleared of "strangers," and it should not be possible, lor t»u men to obstruct business lor du) s together. The indulgence in personal abuse should be checked to a lar greater extent than it had bteu in recent sessions. Hiese things were looked at m a dillcrcnt light in the da)a when he himselt hud been called to order by the late Sir I'runeis Murpli) because he had characterised some remarks ot Mr Aspinall's us " brilliant non- sense " He looked lomani willi nnxiet), also, at the tendency to indulge in a game ot grab at the public expense which seemed to be pervading the whole colon). Requests were made» fur state assistance which were wholly unjustifiable. Ihe miners were asked to advise the Government as to u better method ot distributing the prospecting vote, which »ns already ¿bOOOl), and their reply »us, "Double it.' Hie larmer« wuited the Government to open a rotail shop for the sale of tencing wire, and tbo municipalities lind been promised an in- crease ot their endowment to the extent of £140,000 The last proposal would not be so objectionable if it were accompanied by the ces»mon ot special local votes, for which members of larhument were obliged to crawl mid beg at the eloors ot the public ae pjrtments ^__ On the motion of Mr J. Jamieson, n vote of thanks was passed to the visitors, and the proceedings ended. It should be mentioned that earl) m thu evening songa were sung by Miss Toinliuson mid Mr Parkinson, to the greut pleasure ol their audience
