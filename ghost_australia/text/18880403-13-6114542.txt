.. NOTES AND COMMENTS. ON OUR SOLDIER PLAY. The man is an ass who talks about our playing at Soldiering in terms of contempt, fit indeed to be a Chinaman rather than a Briton for contempt of soldiering is a distinguishing characteristic of the Mongol race and of no other the world knows The soldier play was good, though its best friends will agree perhaps that it ought to have been better Whether we judge our selves by the risk we may have to run, or by our numerical strength in proportion to other colonies orto English counties or towns, the fact remains indisputable that we ought to have been better represented So much may be acknowledged without detracting one whit from the merit and virtue of those men who did turn out They were brave fellows, who feared neither rain nor Russians, 'Tis pity there were not twice as many of them It is said that twice as many will turn out when danger comes. It has been said so before, and with some emphasis "For I trust if an enemy a fleet came yonder round And the whistling battle bolt sang from the three decker out on the foam, The smooth faced snub-nosed rogue would leave his counter and till, And Strike were It but with his cheating yard wand-home ' It is not certain that he would strike with much effect, however, or that his untrained yard ward' would be in any case an effective substitute for a rifle and bayonet But as to the play we have seen it was merry at Langwarrin, merry even when the late regiments were marching into camp at midnight of Thursday with the ground very wet and the rain falling fast Merrier still in cleaning up the camp on Friday, and best show of all perhaps on Saturday when his Excellency went down with ten thousand citizens, and the sham fight was gone through with a fall measure of success to the invincible defenders Pretty to see the enemy marching through the bush there, and falling on ever stronger and stronger forces of judiciously placed ambuscade and reserves " They had it a ghost of a Show," was freely Bald and further, "We would have made a ghost of a blow of them if they had been Russians ' Bat, supposing that army corps at Langwarrin represented the fighting power of the colony, and war was about to be proclaimed any day or hour (as it may be), and three Russian ironclads were hull down (as they might be off Westernport Bay at sunset, and that by midnight they were well inside, with Hinders telegraph station surprised and taken, and two thousand men rapidly disembarking They could get ashore fairly easily, they could entrench themselves under cover of their guns, they could land light artillery and ammunition and what then about the advance' "What then says the gallant Australian soldier. What then, why, we would drive them back again into the sea, that's all "Doubtless we would, but would the force as sembled at Langwarrin be sufficient for the purpose' ' We would clear the country ahead of them , we would establish redoubts on all possible routes to Melbourne, our fleet would go round and attack them in the rear " Gallant fleet of little vessels, yes, but it would be consoling to have some professional opinion on the matter, and reassuring to know that some few thousand more soldiers were ready for the redoubts. 1 he and one of our camp and its advertisement maybe to instruct possibly hostile powers that we are ready, for true is it now, as of old, that while the strong man armed keepeth his house his goods are in peace, and that the unarmed condition invites attack We should be much better armed if half the adult male onlookers of Saturday and Sunday had been participants in the game, and why were they not' It was maliciously said recently that it is because the women of Victoria are developing a sort of Chinese tendency towards indifference for the military art They will flock to football matches, and dress like lambs for the slaughter for race meetings, and work caps and collars by thousands for cyclists, but for the soldier, the volunteer, the defender of their hearths and homes, they have neither encouragement nor favours. Doubtless it is a libel, for it would be an awful thing if true. But, after all, Langwarrin is not the key of the position There are not many of us so chicken hearted as to suppose that any arm), any nation, could land, would ever be able to march away across the isthmus to 1 Frankston, and up by Mordialloc and Brighton to our capital Men, women, and children would turn out We would drive on" 10,000, and we have very little fear that any flee, carrying 10 000 men would ever be permitted to cross the oceans. The deb Bible imminent danger which appears is of two or three powerful ironclads creeping or racing pistons forts, bringing to off Sandridge and St Kilda, and demanding-" Your money or your lives' Can they get he that is the first question, and the bombardiers at the Heads must make reply 'The bomber "era, like stalwart fellows and true Britons 48 they ate, reply " No," though many of the commanders of our fleet, like Captain Mandeville of old, have their doubts We have been looking and listening to the forts of late, endeavouring to understand what they might do And the fort- have answered manfully, though there is a little doubt if they have spoken exactly at the right time there is controversy indeed between our naval men and our bombardiers which renders any certainty in the matter difficult When our Meet went so gallantly down our bay, Ironclad, old three decker (sadly stultified gunboats, and hopper barges following in the wake, there were some amongst us who said now we are safe, and others who gave a still more cordial approval to the agreement which secures for us the bulwark of the Imperial fleet Most people, however, looked to the forts, desiring to know if we had strength there to lock the door at need And just on this point there is desire to know still, but little knowledge The ships went outside, the forts were manned within, the night settled down, and the electric lights were fixed. Curious effect these electric lights make in the waiora two blue bands na of phosphorus, separated by a breadth of black mess stretching right from Point Nepean to Point Lonsdale Over all the waters beyond a broad electric Hame wandering like a monstrous divining rod, or a gigantic "W ill of the wisp If that fail to discover any approaching enemy then he must cross the high lands and cannot be missed unless all the sentences are asleep There was an assumed enemy out on Sunday night, gun boats, hopper barges, and what not, and the question was, and is, can or did that enemy) enter unperceived ' It is sad that there should be controversy over so simple a matter, but really it is impossible to make the accounts of the parties specially interested accord at all Ihemcuonthe gunboats declare that they ran over all the light hands and got right away up to Melbourne, and had they been Russians would have blown the town to pieces and sucked half the banks before laylnJit But the men at the forts differ with them in toto "Got past us unperceived says one of the watchers, "why, we saw you a couple of miles away at sea, and penetrated your disguise the moment you entered our first light band All your dummy gear did not deceive us for a second lot stood revealed with all your false spurs and painted funnels and canvas droppings , our glasses and indicators were on you, and we could be e blown you out of the water before you could have reached either channel " It is heights-, of course, not to know when you are beaten, but there should not be a similar doubt about discovery The lost men and the fleet men must fight this matter out amongst themselves If it was a question of light, not talk there could not be much doubt about it. But there is another little matter in connection with a possible entry of a real enemy which affords room for a little speculation suppose him inside, and as fairly abreast of l the city as was possible. What should we do with him' Let him have three or four or five Buipg, and demand as -any or twice us many millions in cold Should we pray! What could he do to us if we refused t Bombard I Lot him, It would," said in our soldier, who had witnessed the bombardment of half a a European allies, '. Like all ships of the British navy six days to destroy ten million j pounds worth of property in Melbourne, and if we could not shut our channels in a week, so that no ironclad could possibly pass out, our ingenuity in the way of defence would deservedly be rated very low." Keep prepared, and don't be afraid, seems to be the lesson of the various encampments, and encounters, and all their incidents.
