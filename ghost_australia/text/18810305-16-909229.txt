They started to work on Tuesday after dinner, and on Saturday night had 9 6 (19 oIuin Soles for at 10 Tree's work Booker blaine quite excited when he saw the cold club seemed to him an immense quantity, but seeing Hebb very cool over it Indeed," he said " he did not think it any great things 'she soon grew calm However, they were very well satisfied with the beginning, and Robb augured well from the harshness of his mate and his willingness to do what fell to his 1 it On Sunday they employed themselves in building a stone chimney and fireplace to their dwelling, as the weather was cold They worked at the surface while it I rested, and then took up a claim in the river bed, from which they did not get much, enough, however, to pay them good wages and something over The attention of the miners was about this time directed to the holes in the river Boo'gor and Robb joined two Americans and two natives, and having procured pumps and other necessary material the party set to and drained a hole in the river They were about eight weeks at the work, and shared among them at the e repletion a square gin bottle full of told at least that is what Boolger had to his share The yield of gold falling off, with the restlessness of true diggers some of the party proposed to set out for some new diggings which had been discovered at a place called Bongo Bongo Robb was one of them, and they all but quarrelled over it Eventually they agreed to separate, Boolger, Robb, and the Americans agreeing to go together, the Australians preferring to remain, is they had relations settled in the neighbourhood Booloor was very nearly losing all his gold in the following way His mites were in the habit of selling their gold as they got it, but from some reason which he himself could not well divine Be eager retained the greater part of his in his own possession very foolishly, as there are plenty of sh iq ers on every diggings ready to shove anyone lucky enough to possess gOld of the trouble of looking after it His safety lay in the prevalent belief that his party had not done any good, they having kept their own counsel B inlger had buried his gold under his bed In the hurry of i relating to start, and i under the influence of such) p rting glasses, which he could not well nfu e to part like of with his mates, he shot all about his told, and they had started and were i 'nally some three miles on their load for the new diggings when he suddenly recollected that he had not one girthed his treasure show this start was very different from his former one from Maitland Then he was ob led to pedestrians now he was the possessor of a good horse to ride, a packhorse, sa Ideas, and all necessary furniture, not forget ting a Colts "navy' and ammunition YY'heu it flashed across him that he had forgotten to remove his buried gold, he wheeled his horse without a word to his mates, who had stated he had got a sunstroke, and galloped madly back to their humpy, looked round cautiously to see if there were any traces of its long been visited in the interval, and flinging himself off his horse rushed to his cache, which he found undisturbed Fortunately he had strapped a leather value on his sad He at starting , indeed he had intended to put his gold in it, which he now did, and re i and his comrades, two of whom he met returning to look for him "YY'beic in thunder have on been was the first saint thou " We thought you had gone off your chump (Angliee, crazy) When he explained the reason of his mad career he was told he might bless his stars that some of the fossickers had not been before hand with him, and was advised to put it in the bank as they passed through Armidale, which was what he ought to have done at first It was represented to him that if the fact had leaked out that they were in the habit of keeping gold in the but some of them might have lost their lives over it And on some of the southern diggings such an occurrence a is highly probable Everyone of them had ghastly stones to tell of men who were known to keep their gold being found murdered One of the Americans, by name Baldwin, said " In the year '53 I was on Ballarat There were four of us working together, we had got a good claim There was I and my mate here (Ghnn), a Scotchman named Frazer, and an Irishman named Collins Ghnn, Collins, and I lived in the same tent, Prizes had a small tent close to ours, where he lived by himself YY'o got a pretty good haul of the pewter, which was divided regularly among us at the weeks end Us three used to put our gold away with a storekeeper of our acquaintance, who used to forward it by escort 11 aer, who was a bit of a miser, kept his gold planted somewhere about his tent ; none of us even knew where he had it At all events it leaked out in some way that he had it, and things went on quietly for some weeks One Monday he did not turn up to work at the usual time, and Gunn, who went to call him, found him with a pick in his head, dead as i nil The murderers had turned the ground inside the tent over, but whether they got the gold or not was never known Perhaps not, he might have had it down an old shaft Anyway, if he had not got the name of keeping it by him he might have been alive now ' As they journeyed towards Armidale many stones of the same kind were related , among the rest Robb told one of in old mate of his who had a craze-not for keeping his gold by him, but of planting the money he received for it. He had an aversion to putting it in a bank, imagining that he could be more easily plundered in that way and whenever he had a sum of money he used to plant it in all sorts of places hollow trees, rocks in the banks of gullies, never near his place of abode Robb was of opinion, from one instance which came to his knowledge, that Phelan did not recollect half the places in which be deposited his plunder He and Phelan were working together once were getting a good lot of gold, and one Saturday they divided the gold and sold it Phelan s share came to BUS, which be took all in notes That evening, contrary to their usual custom, they indulged in what Phelan called a ' mild drink " He managed to get intoxicated, and about midnight Robb helped him to his humor, and putting him to bed left him When he visited him next day to enquire how he was he found him in great distress He had planted his money in a tree after Robb had left him on the night before, and could not recollect where the tree was He had searched in all directions, but could not find his mark He said he always put a private mark, known only to himself, in the neighbourhood of his plants " Up to the time I saw him last" said Robb, ' he had not recovered it If I had known what I do now I would have put him in the way of recovering his cash ' "How is worn' ' Said Boolger " Well' "Phed Robb, I'll tell you I have come across some queer ones in my time, but the queerest coveR you can ever meet are those who have been swells I had a mate ones for a short time, a fellow who had been a cm dry officer, and I had some high old games with him. He was what they call a well educated chap, he could write splendid, stud dear to the life , I 'm blessed if he used not to draw the hump), and claim, and everything about em as natural as could be, as for real "gut down work, precious little of that went a long way with him, I tell ye But for drink, at a what he shone at he could drink me Wind, and I can, now and then, do a tall bit of nriuking-though, mind ye, I don t neglect the m for the sake of it, as you know Well, talk about planting, this cove that Pin a telling' ye about, when he got tight-that Was whenever he had the chance became mighty careful may be SUSpicious is the word-and used to plant his watch and his ring (for the beggar stuck to these things through thick and thin, leastways as long as I was with him and his gold, when he had any you may be sure he hadn't it long. The storekeepers looked out pretty sharp when he did happen to get a bit. Well, sometimes be used to recollect where he put his things, and at other times he could not remember, for the life of him, where the plant was. What do you think he used to do 1 You'd never guess. He would go away and get as tight as a fly, and the strange: part of the thing was that he used to died this plant-somehow the grog used to bring his memory back, Yes, it's as true as death. I recollect once we was camped on a creek about a mile and a-half from the town as they called it and Dodds-that was his name went to the town after supper as usual to get his skilful, and as he was fond of litigation' himself up he took his watch and chain and put on his rings. He had one ring with a diamond in it about the size of a grain of shot that used to twinkle like a star. 'Twas a wonder he was not eased of his trinkets, for he was always particular about his company. He would go anywhere, and drink with anyone that asked him, and was free enough in that, way himself when he had the tin and when he had not, the way he used to stick it upon them storekeepers was a caution, I've seen many a hard- working man refused credit often, but this fellow could run up a bill almost everywhere. Well, on this night as I am telling' ye of Dodds got drinking at all the shanties in the place till at last he found himself in about one of the worst of 'em, and though he was as drunk as a piper he had sense enough left to see that he was watched by one or two sharpers who were in the place, and that they had their eyes on his rings pretty often ; so what does he do but make an excuse to go outside, and make tracks for the humpy as fast as he could, now he got over the road in the state he was in I could never make out, and he did not know himself ; but about 4 o'clock I must tell ye the night was as dark as pitch-he tumbles into the humpy. I was asleep, but he awoke me by the noise he made coming in. He was that bad he could hardly stand. I was going to strike a light, but he told me not to mind it, and rolled on to his bunk. I fell asleep again. He must have got up in his sleep ; say how, in the morning watch and rings and all were gone, and he did not know any more than a baby where he had put them. He was mighty near losing them altogether that twist It was some days before he found them, and then he had to get drunk to remember the place. I got tired of having such a mate, as I had to do all-the meanest of the work, so I left him and went to another diggings. The last I heard of him was that he was cook at the copper mine on Rat'B River, and the darned trinkets had gone down his throat in the usual way." "Well," said Baldwin, "I like my letters as well as any man, and may be I do take a little more than is good for me at times, as Qlyuu can tell ye. he and I have seen some hard times together, but we have never been robbed. If we was on for a lark, one of us managed to keep pretty straight, and I guess the loafers know pretty well we could both Shoot straight. A chap can get along light if he only keep, clear of the shanties where there are those darned women. All the murders I ever knew of happened through them, and when we were down South in the early time of the rush to Bendigo there were a few-and more that no one ever heard of. Well, you see, Glynn and I have been mates ever since we landed in this colony for we did land at Sydney first and we were at Bendigo, as I said before. YVo had a claim on a pretty rich spot ; the gold was nuggety, and every now and then we came on rich pockets. YVo kept our tongues quiet, and no one knows how we were doing. The sinking was pretty deep, and we watched our Bhatb pretty close to keep the fossickers out. A man had to keep his eye skinned on these diggings. YYTeII, for a little while there were not a great many diggers close to us, and we were pretty peaceable until some darned fool found a heavy nugget near us, and could not hold his tongue. Then the ground was rushed. There was a piece of spare ground next our boundary that was taken up by two Irishers ; tolerably decent fellows they were, and beliefs neighbours we saw a good deal of them. With the rush there came one of those sportsmen, as we call them in our country fellows who make it out by card-sharping and that sort of thing and he builds a wooden shanty about twenty yards from us, and commenced to deal out fire- water along with the cards. He had three women in the establishment, and women were scarce them. The place soon grow into a little hell. Every night there was fighting going on, if if not murder, and there was no more quiet. Sleep was out of the question until near daylight, and Glynn and I wished to get the claim worked out in quick as we could, and clear ; but we had some weeks' work to do, and in the meantime something happened that made us more anxious to get away. Those two Irishers I told you of were good-working fellows, but like most of their countrymen could not keep from the grog, and when the boss started a fiddler there was no holding them is so every night they were to be found at Cleary's. One of them was a fresh good-looking chap, and it seems that one of those women at Cleery's was from his part of the old country, and kinder cottoned to him. I guess it would I have been better if he had never met her, or she him. Glynn and I kept away from the shanty as much as we could we had a goodish bit of gold by us still we had to go there now and then not to seem particular, as well as to see what was going on, and the sort of cattle that were hanging round. I did not tell you these chaps' names ; one was called Burke, and the other (the good-looking chap we only knew as Tim. These two fellows worked away with fairish luck. At length one day Tim, who was a free sort of fellow, rushed over to our camp with the news that they had struck it heavy, and showed us some of the gold ; nice shotty gold it was, with here and there a big piece. He was in high spirits over it, and talked of clearing out for home when the claim was worked out. Burke we did not see, but Tim said he was almost beside himself with joy. Of course they had to celebrate their fortune at Cleery's, and we had to go over with them. We did not stay long, but saw before we left that this female was bound on making The drunk and the other fellows mad jealous at the attention she paid him. The last sight we had of him he had her on his knee, and they seemed pretty comfortable. We returned to our tent and went to bed. In the night we were both awaked by the devilish row over at Cleery's, but, as we were a pretty well accustomed to hearing rows there every night, after seeing that no one was prowling about the shaft we turned in and slept till morning. Next day we saw nothing of the Irish, but as they had been drinking the previous fight we paid no attention. In the afternoon we noticed that Cleary was taking his departure, with his belongings, women and all we never counted how many, being right glad to be rid of them. And so a few days passed. One morning we noticed an old fellow prowling about, but as he was a well-known fossicker we did not mind him much. Not far from Cleery's shanty there was an old deserted shaft, down which the old fellow went. Presently he came up, white as a ghost, and told us there were the bodies of two men and a woman at the bottom of the shaft. The police were sent for, and the bodies hauled up, when we recognised one of them to be that of the Irishman Time another that of his woman ; the other was the body of a stranger. Burke never showed near his claim, and nothing was ever known of the way of their death. Such things were too common to cause any great row to be made over them. So, stranger," said he to Boolger, take my advice : Keep your eyes skinned and your mouth shut." Boolger thought he had got into a nice sort of country if such things as were related were of common occurrence; but he determined to follow part of Baldwin's advice, and keep his mouth shut. They arrived at Armidale before sundown, and put up at a hotel where they were known. Next day Boolger deposited in the Joint Stock Bank £500, the produce of his gold, reserving a few pounds for current expenses, As he had never had so much money in his life before, he felt correspondingly elated, and looked on himself as quite a man of property. Now that he was possessed of the means, the wish to return to Ireland revived ; but he, after a " fight with his devil," as Baldwin would call it, concluded to try and add something more to the nest-egg. The next day they remained in order to get their horses shod and obtain some necessary Articles. On the morning after they started. Boolger was not favourably impressed with the country through which they trialled The weather was cold, the road dreary, and at that time the accommodation to be met with along thorold was of the scantiest kind they were indebted to the pastoral tenants for supplies, and at some places to tell the plain truth met with incivility chiefly because they were wandering diggers, against whom, as a body, the most in- veterate hostility was shown by a section of the former class In some instances they were treated well and kindly Baldwin who was not given to prolixity in his conners ition, summed the matter up by saying, "Well boys the truth is, a man is a man, no matter where you may find him The party arrived at their destination without accident, and immediately set to work but after a few weeks trial, not meeting with the success they anticipated, they left and went back to Armidale, where they agreed to separate the two Americans going south to Victoria. Robb and Boolger joined a party on their o! 1 field, the Rocky River, with the object of tunnelling into a ball on the mer bank called Mount Jones Rooster stayed here for some months, when he grew weary of the monotony of the life, and lining had the go d fortune to do tblohia capital in the- time he felt a strong desire to put into execution his design of revisiting Ireland lie ei Id his interest for considerably more than the real value, got rid of his horses in the sun manner, and started by coach for Yinitland, w i h a draft on a Sydney bank for £2000 and sufficient loose cash to provide for contingencies I Bearing in mind Baldwin sale son about keep ing his mouth shut, he was careful not to appear in the character of a " lucky digger, as he knew by experience that by so doing he would only be throwing out a bait to attract the attention of the sharing fraternity During all the years he had been away from home, unaltered by some feeling of false pride and shame, he had never corresponded with any members of his family, nor had he ever come in contact with any person (rim his part of the country who could inform him how things stood with his relatives But on his arrival in Sydney, and while debating with himself whether he had better write and an nounce his coming by one of those rare ch races which do sometimes occur in life, the very man capable of giving, him the desired inform tion appeared on the scene True to his fixed determination not to approach anything like display, either in his dress or mode of living, Booloor put up at his former place of abode on the Circular Q lay, and to all inquiries as to how he had fared while up the country returned evasive replies Soon after his arrival of ship with immigrants arrived, and some of the young men came to reside at the house where he fixed Knowing by the peculiar brogue the Bocca Corkaginou'us that one of them came from the province of Munster at least, Boolger entered into conversation with him, and to his surprise found he was not only a countryman but a townsman, by name Lamb, and, further, that he know all about his (Boolger 5) f milly Limb did not recognise him under his assumed name, and having no suspicion of his personality told him frankly all he knew about the person in whom he is interested The sum of which was, that his father was dead-head been dead for some years, his sister married to a man by name Power owner of some property in the county , his mother still alive, and hung in Ochylo As to his other friends-old Standup Sti sight was dead, and the business had been sold to stranger But of the transaction which had been the means of Boolger b leaving home Lamb knew a thing Boolger s schoolfellows were scattered about the world-some in America, some in India , one of his intimates, by name Robinson, had been killed in Spain a long time ago he was 11 i flicer iii the Spanish Legion, and was shot while crossing a river to post a letter home-30 they s laid-out what regiment Robinson had been in Limb did not know Boolger remembered hearing of a young officer having been shot a the way do scrub d, by the Carlists, and know now that it was his old schoolfellow, and that they must have been quartered in the same place several times without his knowledge IIibii as to his old (lime-and his enquiries were made very cautiously at this stage oh I yes, Lamb knew her.
