So much interest has been shown by our readers in this marvellous case that we have published the facts again as they appeared in the " Australian Workman " a few weeks ago : " One afternoon our representatire made his way to the home of MIr. Thomas Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane, Ultimo. He was discovered nursing a two- year. old baby, and his face declared him t, be one of the happiest men in Sydsney. He was up and about and able to an:wer the knock at the door. In reply to the preliminary questions he said, " You want to know all about my case ? Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may be of value to those who are stricken as I was." " How long were you suffering 1" " Well, twelve mouths ago I got Eo bad that I had to leave off wcrk, and 1 have done nothing since then. About five years ago, next Christmas, I met with an accident. I was badly scalded while taking a bath in Pitt. street, Sydney. Since the accident I have been in failing health und after four years of gradual development of the malady I was forced to give up siy billet at the Glebe Island." " What were the symptoms ? " Simply indescrible. The pains were something terrible. They were just about as much as I could bear. They were for all tile world like as if a saw were cutting my bones-in two in every part of me. I had no control over my bowels or bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and everyone else. I was incessantly shivering and shak ing. and could neither eat or sleep. On the 23rd March last 1 saw a well known doctor, and he told me that my case was utterly hopeless. However, he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable Institutions." " Did you make use of the order :. " No, I came home and went to bed, and have been pretty well in bed ever since. Five weeks ago I could not walk across the floor; in fact I could not get out of bed. I felt then that it was all over with me, and only a question of days when 1 would give up the ghost. My doctor was att-ending me, and did all lie could, by opimu alid morphia pills to ease tile agony I was in. I was under him for five or six weeks. He came to the conclusion that I was suffering from locosmotor ataxia, or progressive locomotor ataxy. a disease of the spinal cord charac terised by peculiar disturbances of gait ano difficulty in co- ordinating volun tary movements. He told me that I might last for ten years and that I might never get the use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his legs with energy to show that medical opinion is not infalliable.) Well, just as a drowning man would grasp a1 a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by the advertisement describing the cure effected in the case of another boiler-maker in England, which 1 read in the " Australian Workman," by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pals People. I read in the adverisemeanof a case which seemed to fit my wan. I determined to give the Pink Pills a trial anyway, and. send for a box. The effect was as marvellous as it was magical. I was able to eat and sleep as though nothing was the matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest I had for many a day. It was i',: credible, I immediately Ifeft the bed and was able to move, about, I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills . during tile past four weeks, and am Dow tak ing the fifth box. I can Walk about with the aid of a stick, and am gradu ally, but surely, recovering my former vigor and vitality. You see these crutches here ? 'They were male for me before I got Dr. Williaxes' Pink Pills. but I was too weak to use t?e and now I don't waunt themn. API want is this stick and I; hope soon lo do without it, You, seel am rapidll regaining ~r strength." " HIe is 100 per cent. better," said Mrs. .Jarvis, who had come in and taken the baby on her knees. "~ r. 'Villiams' Pink Pills have saved hii life, and made another man Oi him, A frienlld who called il at this point. said that Jarvis lhoked tce years younger that day than he "ZId a ,ort night previously. '"I can now,"' continued Jarvis, " have a cold btlb" and all tile feeling has come back to my legs. If I keep on going onuthe way I am, 1 hope to be able to resume my work as a boiler maker, and you know I have to be in the very pink of health anld strength to work at that trade. 1 am better to day than I have been for the last five years.: I ascribe all .the change and benefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved my life. I am.in no pain nos: whatever, and feel like a unew u',an, On the mantlepiece there is a 'oes of oplum and morphia pills E'nich the doctor gave ma to deaden teae excruciat ing pain.. But they 1en stay where threy are, forI nq. longer need the-m. Everybody ',aO knows me are amazed at the ciafige in me. They can hardly bliev? their eyes. My being about again has caused quite a sensation out here."
