LIES AID OTHER FACTS (BT BUNGARRA.) "The Lord lovetb. the caeerfol liar." Scripture up to date. Mental Expansion. St. Pafc.'s Day drew from Moorhead, M.JL.A., some notable utterances at the banquet held -in the Mechanics' ! Institute. They are well worthy of record as tending to broaden the mind by bringing the Seventeenth of Ire-; land out of the narrow realm of the purely religious into the wholesome; and widened sphere of the national ; ideal irrespective of bigotry or intoler ance. The yellow pup delights to1 stand up on its hind legs and bark on at least one untrammelled day in the year ; the ghost of Dutch Billy and the skeletons of Boyne cavaliers and mercenaries. alike wish to air their bones round the sea of glass or the lake of sulphur io the hereafter they now inhabit ; the Manchester martyrs and the shades -of Cavendish and Burke see no harm in foregathering to bury the hatchet; heroes of the Ca- talpa and " Ulster - warders -exchange chews off the same plug of tobacco in Heaven or assist each -other at the wood-pile in Gehenna ere the. boss of either circus separates them for an- other year. What Moorhead ?aid was, " We meet this night before the world as Irishmen -first and, perhaps, Catholics afterwards." "Also, it was a significant fact that the course of every liberal and national movement in Ireland had been marked with the slime of the trail of the serpent of religious bigotry." .Strong, ain't it? "The gramaphbne, if you please. This is the church that Jack built, This is the slime that marked the trail that followed the snake that lived in the church that Jack built. This is the hatred all sublime That Moorhead felt for the greasy slime That slid off the back and marked the track That followed the wake Of the ghostly snake That dwelt in the church that Jack built. Query :. Was Jack a native of Tippe- rary or Ulster ? Echo answers "Both." Moorhead finished his stir- ring speech by urging that all dissen- tions should be , sunk and that they must " be prepared to sacrifice the national belief that Heaven was only made for those who cried loudest for King William ac loudest for His Holiness/' ' Long ere this His Holi- ness and Yellow William have- sunk, by force of the local by-laws, รกร diffe- rences in a long- sleeker at the bar of Heaven, for Truth at least must be apparent one way or the other np there. As Byron says in his Vision of Judgment, "God Save the King, It is a large economy In God to save the' like." To which "Bungarra" would,like to add a boulderised version of an old jacobite toast- God bless the King, the toast's beyond a joke ; Ged also bless His Holiness the Pope ; Whether the Pope is right, or Whether the King, God bless us all, is quite another thing !
