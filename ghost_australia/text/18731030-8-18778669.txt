ÏHE ENGLISH HAIL. (tren the London correspondent of On Melbourne Argus, Sept. 6J THE REVIVAL OF PILGRIMAGES. The pilgrim spint is again stirnng in Europe Its contagious enthusiasm has spread to our own little uland, and this week we bave seen a band of Englishmen go forth to worship at foreign shrines It is "a sign of the times" The revival of pilgnm ages has been one of the most remarkable features of French life since the war The excesses of the Commune did undoubtedly create a religious reac tura, and the movement has been fostered from political motives, which would not only represent the ecclesiastical and conservative interests of societj as the same, but the monarchical principle as their proper defence The Pope, m one of his enthusiastic utterances, recently replied to an address from 100 deput es of the A semblj -" I have never doubted that the sun of justice would nee for France The Virgin Mary u establishing a kingdom for herself in France The pilgnmages are a spectacle worthy of angels and men" In Italy, the Government#have found it necessary to prohibit the pilgrimages, and bands of superstitious peaaantrj, fresh from Loretto and th9 time-sanctioned mummeries of other shrines, have found themselves dispersed on reaching Rome, and obliged to return, much to their astonish ment, without the customary certificate of devotion The grand project of a pilgnmage to Palestine has been revived, with the Pope's promise of indulgence Meanwhile, His Holiness bas sanc- tioned a new and astounding sjstem of spmtual pilgrimages The faithful son of the Church who cannot travel may purchase a guide-book prepared for him bv the Società degli Interessi Cattolici, and make the round of all the sanctuanes in his daily devotions, and obtain an indulgence of 300 days It is proposed to devote the first ten dajs of September to the sanctuanes of the East, the next days to the principal European, and the lost ten days to the Italian sanctuanes In Germany, the stem policy of Prince Bismarck is finding other occupation for the Catholic prelates, who will not recognise the new laws There is an ugly look about this religious question in Europe, and the projected visit of King Victor Emanuel to Berlin shows the apprehension of statesmen Side by side with the revival of fanatical passions, political mtngue is incessantly busy, and Ultramontamsm avows a common aim in France, in Spain, in Italy and wherever in Germany it has power to speak There are adverse powers working subtly and unseen that threaten a worlf ahaking collision even while Berlin erects its Col umn of Victory and the Emperor William re-names the conquered fortresses of Metz and Strasburg after his great captains It is at this crisis we are called to witness the re- vival of pilgrimages in England also. Not long ago a party of Roman Catholics visited the shnne of at Thomas A'Becket in our own Canterbury Cathedral, the »linne oncesoiamous, as every reader of Chaucer knows, and certain zealous Protestants at once took alarm, although it afterwards appeared that these visitors had not exceeded the license allowed to ordi- nary tourists. There was no mistake, however, as to what was designed when English Catholics were in- vited to participate in a pilgnmage to the shrine of Sinter Margaret Mary Alacoque, at Para} le Monia!, in France, m company with the Duke of Norfolk, Loid Edward Howard, Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord Walter Kerr, Lady Herbert of Lea, and other of our old nobility It was a little startling to find our English common sense surrendenng before the world to fables of this kind There was a great histonc fact, memorable in the relations of church and state, associated with the tomb of A'Becket, but these shrines of modern pilgnmage are sacred only to the visions of hj stencal girls or the idle tales of more acute deceivers We could well understand how English Catholics might desire to testify their sym- pathy with the movement on the Continent-to swell the wave of religious fervour, or to lend indirect support to the monarchical reaction, as favourable to the Papal power But our national pnde is not flat- tered by the form their demonstration has taken The story of Sister Margaret dates back more than SOO years. She was a nun of the Convent of the Visitation at Foray le Momal, where she is said to bave bad many wonderful visions Her fame has been lately revived, and many accounts of her life have been published Her shnne is identified with the worship of the Sacred Heart, for rea- sons which perhaps are best explained in her own imputed words, at least in words denved from the narrative now imputed to her -" One time, being before the Holy Sacrament, I found myself invested with the Divine presence so powerfully that I for- got myself and the place where I stood, and aban- doned myself to the Divine Spint, delivering my heart over to the force of His love He made me repose for a long time upon His Divine Breast, where He disclosed to me the marvels of His love and the inexplicable secrets of His Sacred Heart He had always kept it hidden from me before, but now He opened it for the first time, and in a man- ner so effective that He left me no room for doubt And this is how it seems to me this interview passed He said to me, ' M} Divine heart is so full of pas- sionate love for men, and for you in particular, that it can no longer contain within itself the flow of it« ardent loving-kindness It is necessary that it should be distributed by your agency, and that it should manifest itself to mankind in oider to ennch them with the precious treasures that I show you, and which contain the sanctifying and saving graces necessary to their salvation I have chosen you for the accomplishment of this design, as bemg m the depth of indigence and ignorance, everytmng will be done by Myself.' After this He asked me for my heart, which I begged Him to take He took it, and put it with- in His adorable own, m which I saw it like an atom consuming m an ardent furnace Presently he took it out again, a burning flame in the shape of a heart, and putting it back in the place whence he had onginally taken it He said, ' There, My well- beloved, is a precious gage of My love, which encloses in your side a little spark of its most vivid flame And to prove that the great gift I have made you is not a freak of imagination, and that it is the foundation of all the rest I have yet to endure from without, it ?hall come to pass that though I have closed up the wound m your side, the pam will rest always with you, and if up to the present time you have only taken the name of Mj slave, I shall hereafter bestow upon you that of the well-beloved disciple of My Sacred Heart ' After a favour so great, and which lasted over such a lengthened penod of time dunng which I did not know whether I was in heaven or upon earth, I lay for several da}s in a state of burn- ing elation, and so far beside myself that I could not utter a word without doing myself violence, and the effort to eat was so grept that I was nearly weaned out. I could not sleep, for this wound, of which the pam is to me so precious, caused me an agony that consumed me and burnt me alive." Her subse- quent life was one of exemplary devotion, and of frequent manifestations. Every Thursday and Fri- day she was made to participate in the mortal sadness of Getbsemane, which " reduced her to a condition of agony harder to support than death itself ? and every midnight she rose and prostrated herself on the earth, " to appease the Divine anger against sinners," and to soften in some measure the hitter anguish of Christ m being abandoned by his Apostles ! The pilgnmage to the shnne of Margaret Alacoque ivas in amusing contrast to the toilsome journeys of other days It partook of the nature of a railway excursion, the estimated cost of which was about £5, and all the arrangements were entrusted to the enterprising tourist Cook. A considerable detach- ment of pilgrims came from the north of England, beaded by the Bishop of Salford. On Monday even- ing the pilgnms from all parts assembled at the Pro. Cathedral, Kensington, where a special service was held, and Archbishop Manning addressed them at great length. The gorgeously-embroiderei and costly banner of the pilgrimage was conspicuous on the altar steps, and it was also noticeable that the congregation wore the emblems of the Sacred Heart, « red cross and heart on a white ground. I Dr. Manning gave first some practical instructions counselling the pilgrims to obedienoe, to mutual for- bearance, to humility, " You have been the subjects," be said, " of no little censure and no little ndicule. Bless God for ft. It is a poor serving of the cross that has not some shame." Then he alluded to the first great pilgrimages to the holy places of P destine, and proceeded to justify the selection now of Paray le-Monial. " The fact with which I begin is the de- votion of the Sacred Heart. The loving veneration for the human heart of Jesus deified into Godhead is at Uns moment a devotion spiead throughout the Universal Church, it is m every province, every diocese-I might almost say in every parish. In .very church and in every sanctuary there is either an altar, or a shrine, or a picture, or a statue ; either a treatise of theology, or a manual of devotion, or a book for children, all containing this devotion of the Sacred Heart. Next after devotion to the Holy Sacrament, which is closely akin to it, and explana- tory of it, comes the devotion of the Sacred Heart, spread east and west throughout the Catholic Church. For two centimes it has been established m the hearts of generation after generation. It pervades the faithful from the oldest to the youngest ; and, I ask, whence did it anse. From Paray-le-Momal." Dr. Manning was careful m dealing with the history of Margaret Mary, but that this world- wide fact should have arisen from the meditation of a poor ?"despised sister of visitation," he ascribed to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost "And we therefore account the place where the devout Bhall go as sacred ; we call the whole world to witness to the fact-we account for >t by a supernatural expla- nation." Margal et Mary saw- Christ " suffused by an intensity of light, she beheld His Sacred Heart, en- veloped, as it were, in flame, girdled with thorns, surmounted with a eros?, and these words came to her, 'Behold the heart that has loved man so much, and has been loved so little ' " Here was the or.gm of the devotion, and Dr Manning likened it to the visions of Paul, and Stephen, and John, and chal- lenged the unbeliever. " Do you Christians believe these things which you read in the New Testamentp If so, why doubt this, that He who has manifested Himself to his servants in the beginning, and has thereby given us a revelation of the order of faith and grace under which we are to the end of the world, has also in divers wavs and sundry manners manifested himself at all times to his servants and friends 9 The man who can coldly deny this, let htm look well to his faith m the New Testament Scnpture" It is not exoedient that I follow the Archbishop through his address, but thus mwh is necessary, in order to understand the ground which intelligent Romanists take. He next spoke of the motives of the pilgrimage, laying especial emphasis on the fact that " they desired to bear witness in the face of a world that was growing cold that they loved Christ, and that they believed neither miracles nor visions to have ceased." Then he enumerated the objects of their prayers, amongst them the Holy Father. The arch- bishop at the commencement had said that the bishops of England, in their provincial council assembled, gave them their solemn benediction, and that he had received from tile Holy Father his com- mand to give " his special benediction on this pil- grimage and a plenary indulgence." Accordingly, Sr. Manning in conclusion gave this benediction of the Pope, while the congregation knelt :-" May the blessing of God the Father Almighty be upon you in your going out and in your coming in ; may He keep you safe in His faith and fear, living and dying and for ever." The start was made from one of the London sta- tions at six o'clock the next morning. Mass was celebrated at a still earlier hour in some of the churches. Monsignor Capel was one of the most conspicuous figures on the platform, busily hurrying from carriage to carriage to see that each compart ment had its priest who might conduct the devo- tions of the travellers A manual of prayers had been prepared, and as soon as the train started their reoital commenced There were about 400 pilgrims, a large proportion of whom were women and priests Every London parish sent one or two of its clerg} or laity In London also dunng the da} s of the pilgrim- age the RomanCatholicchapels were open andspecial servicesheldfollowedbytheconfessionsofthefaithful The mam body of pilgrims crossed the water from Newhaven to Dieppe, but there were others who took the shorter loute from Dover, and went b} different trBinB, so that the total numbers, when thev all met, were calculated at from 700 to 800 H} mns were sung as tbey launched out to sea, but the tur- bulent waves soon broke these bacred harmonie0 A " Pilgnmage H} mn " had been composed for the travellers by Lad} Georgiana Fullerton, the closing words of which point the true moral of these pro- ceedings " O by Ter heart. Thy Mcred heart Jeto«, »ve England, France ai d Borne Arnved at Pans, the pilgrims were distributed among the religious bouées , early the next morning they attended mass at one of the churchea, and then re- sumed their journey It was within an hour of mid- night when they reached their goal, for more than one mishap had delayed their train on its southward Journey A correspondent of the Daily News this morning desenbes by telegraph the scene on their arrival at Paray-le-Monial -"As the English pilgnmä de- scended each received a taper, for which he was afterwards invited to pay 2d steiling The gor- geous banners previousl} prepared in the railway carnages were quickly brought, and the procession was formed As pioneers marched a contingent of pnesta, the leader of the column being 6 ft 6 in high, and as lean as his bishop is fat Behind the foreign pnests was Monsignor Talbot, with the banner of the Sacr«d Heart After him the Duke of Norfolk struggled gallantly with the English banner, assisted by Lords Dormer and Arundel of Wardour The females followed three abreast, Lord Walter Kerr bore the banner of Scotland, and the English pnests formed the rear The procession, flanked b} files of nuns with lighted candles, moved slowl} up, the lane of light resembling a moving fire, and singing ' Magnificat amma mea Dominum ' The chapel having been at length reached, the pilgrims all knelt m the dust before the open doors revealing the glones of the illuminated shnne within the church, to receive the benediction and offer thanksgivings All night long and throughout the morning a chang- ing army of priests were saying masses at the 20 altars It was hard work, and was faithfully executed One pnest fainted at the altar and was carried out, but his place was soon filled. In the darkened corners of the church and the recesses between the pillars, a succession of kneeling figures made confession and got absolution At ten o'clock there was High Mass, followed by a short address from the Bishop of Salford At the afternoon ser- vice, Monsignor Capel preached, surpassing himself in eloquence The second procession to the shrine this afternoon was intended to eclipse last night's, but fell short of m it effect, nmeteenth century pil- grimages not being picturesque in sunlight " This pilgnmage is certainly among the most re- markable developments of our day, and yet its im- portance may be easily exaggerated It is a Roman Catholic demonstration, suggested by the movement on the continent, and it is nothing wonderful that that body should be able to send forth from all England a bond of 800 disciples on a sacred mission Whatever Protestants may think of Margaret Mary, tbey have no reason to take alarm at this manifesta- tion of numbers and zeal There is not a sect in England which does not sometimes make as imposing s demonstration, though after another pattern and with other aims This pilgnmage is but an excresence on the freer life which all the sects appear to seek-one sign among manj that the days of religious stagnation have been succeeded by days of religious expenment, in which all thoughts shall have expression, and usages old and new be all brought to proof and tried m their support. The interest that it has awakened is chiefly due to the fact that it is contemporaneous with a backward movement in the English Church The agitation caused by the famous petition to Convo- cation for the appointment of " duly qualified con- fessors" has not yet subsided. Public meetings Continue to be held in the provincial towns, by way of protest against such innovations. The bishops are at last yielding to the public pressure, and show signs of alarm, lest the establishment should be undermined. The Bishop of London has spoken out, and so also the Bishop ef Gloucester and Bristol The Times represents the outside world, and urges on the episoopal bench, with all its secular, autho ntj. The current, however, is not now to be stayed by ecclesiastical law, the bulk of the bishops thrown into the stream would but jaake the waters babble more loudly. The archbishops are right when they appeal to public opinion and private argument as the strongest weapons against innovating error
