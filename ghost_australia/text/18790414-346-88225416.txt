U.U.U. and East Melbourne was played oa the grouud of the latter on Saturday, in the midst of strong, euld breezes oil the sea and smart showers of rain, which necessitated the players frequently seek ing the shelter of the pavilion. This was mora particularly the case when the Buadigouiaus were in the held, and the natural r««ult was that they had great dillieulty in keeping their feet 011 the black wet slippery ssil. 1'ho bowlers felt the inclemency of the weather moat, notwith standing a liberal supply of sawdust. Butler, Manalick, Spargo, Bruce, and Glen were ail tried against the wind. The first named got one v.ickei for 4 runs and the last one for 5 runs. U. Mackay, who bowled seven consecu tive maiden overs, secured two for 13, and Bes "iek three for 24 runs. The fielding of the B.U.C.C. wa.i very loose. lardy frequently let balk .slip through his lingers at tield-ott, but Jic made two catches oft' Beswick. Terry, v.-ho played a very lino innings, showing excellent judgment in defence and hitting, but lie was caught at. the wickets by- Dobsou when about 30, though tite umpire did not give, him out, and shortly afterwards he should have been caught by Harry at Held on. Moore, a young player, g.iva the bowler.? agood deal of trouble by his stubborn defence, every ball being played iu line free wristy stylo along the ground. The Bendigo men were not at home ou the wet wicket, and did not at all show anything like what the}' are really capable of doing. Luck was against them, as well as tha element;. Beswiek. was the only one who showed any thing like good form, and played x fine innings for -5 not out. He waa well seconded iu his efforts by Fardy, who scored !>. There was only one minute to spare before time was called, when the last :nin M'C'oli, went in, and a draw v.as fully expected, but the batsman waa caught ulf the lirai luli, .tnl the Bcii iigo innings closed for TO.
