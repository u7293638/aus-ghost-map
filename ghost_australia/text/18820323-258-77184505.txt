they remained there till about quarter-past one a.m., on the morn- ing of the 9th instant, when they went to Graham's hotel; James Cullinan was with them when they came out of Brookes' but they met prisoner outside who said, "I want to have a fight with someone, I want to have a slap at Hughes or Cullinan;" said, "It is no good fighting, the best thing you can do is to go home peacefully;" prisoner replied, "By Jesus, I'd go for you then;" said, "Not if I know it, Callaghan, I don't want to fight with you;" prisoner then said, "what did you do with my mate?" said, ""Who is your mate?" he replied, " Tommy;" said, "I did not inter- fere with your mate;" prisoner said, "You have murdered my mate and he is now lying behind a tree;" prisoner then left, singing out for Tommy to pick him up; then left and went round the cutting at Graham's with deceased and James Cullinan; went then to his bed- room at Graham's; Hughes and Cullinan en- tered his bedroom with him at the rear of Graham's hotel, back of an end parlor at the North-east corner; they had no light, but the three of them sat down on his bed and had a chat on business; closed the bedroom door; prisoner shortly came up and said "Come out now you bloody dogs, and take it out of me now;" he was then close to the bedroom door; afterwards he burst open the door and en- tered; nothing was said by any of them in the room; prisoner struck deceased as he sat on the end of his bed; believes the blow was by prisoner's closed fist;

when he was being removed prisoner was at the corner of Graham's hotel; when in his room heard prisoner say, "By Jesus, I'll go for you;" don't know to whom he addressed himself; then went out and saw Hughes and prisoner between the fence on the brink of the cutting in front of Graham's door, and saw them both struggling having a hold of each other; saw them both fall over the cutting; immediately after heard a voice say "There's a man drowning;" then ran to the top of the cutting and saw prisoner swimming in the water in the cutting, away from where he saw Hughes rise in the water; the night was moon- light, but cloudy; then enquired who was in the water, as he was not sure, not having seen Cullinan from the time he left his bedroom; someone answered, "It is John Hughes;" sang out to prisoner, "Callaghan, turn and save him;" he did not turn and save him; he made no reply, but prisoner must have heard him; then ran and got a prop of a clothes line and reached it down to Hughes; when he re- turned with the prop prisoner stood on a ledge of rock, above where Hughes was in the water, on Graham'e side of the cutting; aaid to prisoner, "For God's sake try and save him;" Hughes was then immediately under prisoner in the water; prisoner then immediately threw himself from the ledge on which he stood upon deceased then in the water, and sank him; said, "Callaghan, you murdering scoun- drel, you have drowned John Hughes;" prisoner was then in the water; he made no reply then; while sitting on the bank, waiting to see if deceased would rise to the surface, prisoner got out of the water and came to where he was, and jumped upon him, and said, "I'll drown you too, you bâ€”r;" struggled with him sometime, whilst prisoner kicked him and struck him; prisoner tried to put him over the cutting into the water; did his best, but failed, and then struck his head against the fence two or three times; some of the men about then removed prisoner, and he went to his bedroom; believed some of his ribs were broken; they were sore for several days; when in bed heard prisoner at the rear of the house saying, "By Jesus, I'll be hung anyway, I want hanging, I have drowned one man, and I'll murder his mate;" that was all he beard or saw of prisoner that night; prisoner may have been drinking, but did not see him; should not think he was drunk; would not say he was under the influence of drink; when prisoner first came to his bedroom door he had only a singlet upon him; no boots; was not aware Hughes ever gave prisoner any provocation; he (witness) never did to his knowledge; the Burdekin River was flooded on the morning of the 9th; it was impassable; could not say what depth of water existed in that part of the jcutting where Hughes and prisoner fell over;
