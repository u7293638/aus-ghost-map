) THE PHANT 0 U M I N E E, / (A story of the old, gold digging days.) r " Tell you a ghost story," said my uncle Ned, a hale old f gentleman of 70 years. " Well, I will relate a peculiar j- affair that happened on Tallmans Gully, in 1S59." S - We were all attention, and listened to the very revnark- ( able narrative he related in the following manner r ) " You must know," commenced my uncle, " that I and \ four mates were living in a tent on the banks of the I river — living, I said, I should have called it existing, for ) we were most unfortunate, only finding sufficient gold to \ keep us in the commonest tucker. After our evoryday's f work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were J every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink \ of a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This ( confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did ) not cease until the break of day. One night wo were \ determined to sec who it was ; so we sallied forth in the J bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel A shirt, high boots, and slouched hat, bard at work by an \ old claim which had been deserted Cor many years. I was / chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; ) but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, k transfixed with horror, — for the wearer of the digger's / clothes was no I i ring man, but a skeleton /" ) / " Uncle Ned 1" we all cried, "how fearful." ( " One night, our tout was. visited by a handsome, well- / to-do '.looking man, of about fifty years of age, .who ) enquired .for a digger of whom wo knew nothing about. C He told us that in '51 he and a mate of his deserted from / one of Her Majesty's ships, and started for the Tallmans \ gold fields'/ They worked with pretty good luck for a few / months, whenithe new comer went down to Melbourne to / she about' some letters. Before he went, he said- to his \ mate, 'Bob, whatever you do, never stop working the ( claim for a day until I come back.' Bob promised, and / they parted. — ' I went down to Melbourne,' said the ex- \ digger,- 'and there was arrested as a deserter, and sent on ( board; and now that I have obtained my discharge, I / Rave hastened, up here to find my old chum.' ' You wili \ sec turn1 to-night,' I said; ' but you'll fincLim very much f changed.' " At midnight;, the.;eVerlastihg clink of the ) phantom's'rpiek was heai'd, "and we ail'' iurned out.
