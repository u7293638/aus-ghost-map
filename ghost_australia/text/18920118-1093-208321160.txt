"Sir. Robert Louis Stevenson, the well known author, says he will live and die in his pnro.dfee. ft is a veritable dream land where the novelist lives. His home i3two miles from Apia, on the island of Upolu, and the site of the house was, when he bought it, a virgin forest through which the foot had never trod. The house faces on the sea; about it are the givafc leaves of the eocoanufc palm and bread fruit trees; within it is all that civilisa tion can furnish to minister to creature comfort.

But lie has no desire ever to change his locus, and with his wife and mother be will dream away existence amid the ghosts with which his fancy has peopled his house and its surroundings..
