A Fee-male Detective. The following telegram from that "divarting vagabone," Mr. Meyers, Esq. , published lately in the Empire, among a crowd of electrical gems of similar nature, has created no little perplexity in Sydney among the uninitiated : â€” Telegram from Mr. C. Meyers, Orange, to John Clarkson, Sydney. 19th May, 1S68. Arrived here last night. Want money to continue my journey. Waiting for answer to my letter to Mrs. (sic) Parkes from Grenfell. Send answer to-day. Everybody asks, "What has Mrs. Parkes to do with it?" Mr. Punch answers, "Nothing at all to do with it." It is quite clear to him that Mr. Parkes so thoroughly identified himself with the detective character of the proceedings that he actually presented himself to Meyers in, what perhaps can hardly be called, the disguise of an old woman! No wonder he looked sj'c(k), or that Meyers thought he could play on his (or her) credulity. If the interview had been with "Benedick," our great ghost-seer would doubtless have arrayed himself as the fascinating "Beatrice," in this truly laughable political comedy of "Much Ado about Nothing."
