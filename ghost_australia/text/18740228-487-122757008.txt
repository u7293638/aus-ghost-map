RESULTS OF MARRIAGE. Ik a book bearing tbe singular title of 'Babies and Ladders,' Emmanuel Kink thus discourses as to one of the results of marriage : When men have been married for some time, a lot of small creatures, with rattles and bone rings in their hands, begin to creep about the house, and fall into water-jugs, and burn their hair at the kitchen fire, and drink boiling water out of the kettle on the hob, and swallow brass nails, and put soap into the tea cups. After & little while these become children, in which unhappy state they eat electuary for breakfast, and wooden skewers and potatoes fried in castor oil for dinner, and jam spread over rhubarb powder for tea. They swallow two fourpenny pieces a week, and fall out of a window two or three times each month. They tumble down the kitchen stairs, and lie at the bottom in the dark, until tbe man with the coals stumbles over them. They get their teeth knocked out against window sills and one another's foreheads. They are introduced by their nurses to every ghost that is small enough to come down the chimney. They are put under sofas, or out on the leads, like flower pots, when anyone visits the house. Their skin is scraped off four or five times a day with fine wire gauze and yellow soap. A man once told me th.it the reason the people prefer having children in their houses to dogs or cats or zebras is because you can amuse yourself by making a child unhappy all day long, but a beast is only miserable when ?KSis-Suffering torn cold,hutigcr, or a boriiug.
