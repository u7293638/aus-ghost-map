Although a large number of extra constables had been detailed for duty at the polling booth in anticipation of the enormous crowds who were expected to call the desks in order to record their votes for Mr Bent and Mr Dog bah, the eventful day passed off with absolute decorum, barring a slight skirmish between the mayor and the returning officer, assisted by an inspector of police Without some little incident of that km 1, however, no election returns could properly) be considered later The polling booth was fortunately) open for 11 hours, so that Mr. Bent's supporters were not unduly crowded. tHis) marked the place at the rate of four and a half per hour all through the day, while the friends of Mr. Daglish hurried in at the rate of three and two eh'venthsperhour Under these exciting circumstances the South Melbourne police behaved admirably, and the skill with which they controlled the crowd was remarkable. The principle upon which many of the South Melbourne electors cast their votes may not be generally known, and hit him on the subject may be acceptable. Va b. sap Here it is. A VOICE FROM SOUTH MbLtlOUHNL. "Be just and fear not V etc for Thomas Bent " So ran the simple legend on the wall, And, as I read, methought I heard a voice That whispered in mine ear these cheery words - They talked about brains, an' wisdom, mate, an' honour, as noble aims, Ann 'indeed other unnatural fads as is so many hearty names But I knew it was merely givens my answer was straight an' blunt, " What a member wants ain't honour on' brains, but It's plenty of bloomin' FRONT." There was forty) nine of us thought the same, so we met in a quiet pub To choose the man who should poll our votes, but there was the blessed rub We were conscientious voters, and we weren't going' to guess. But they try one of the job) six was qualified more or less W) Tucker is none too modest, but 'he could t compare we knew, With a few of the others We watched 'him about an' wo scratched All Owen too Some wanted to make It Daglish, but we were not long detained, For 'a 'adn't a bloomin' ghost of a show with the three that still remained 'Arl of the list was done, 'tis true, but now wed along deals) Wed bent an' Mauger au' Champion left, an' which was the two to say). 'Twas a hard, 'hard task, but we took them three and we turned 'cm round about, An' vvohonicred forty nine more beers-an'then we put Mauger hour. At last w ell come to the parting ways, an' a cove rose up to speak " W ever got to vote for the man, ' scz he, " as show 8 the most cast-iron cheek Which shall we choose to claim our votes!" We pondered the subject well, / But which of the two was the real top dog at first it was said to tell Then somewhere a whisper rose at last, and some- where a murmur grew, VV hill each man glanced at is neighbour's face, and his own 'arf gave the clue, As the whisper crew to a mighty roar, an' the air of that pub was rent, When the 'one of the blooming' forty-nine with one accord felled "BENT" That's why the people voted for Bent, an' though 'e as lost 'Is stuff I reckon the reason's plain to see-I knows it was) enough "Vox Populi vox Dei," they say. Ain't them your view is an' thine? But sometimes out of it's wisdom, mate-well, Provi- dence draws the line
