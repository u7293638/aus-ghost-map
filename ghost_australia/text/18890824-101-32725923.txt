'During this period a heavy cloud hang over the Cafó'Nürnberg. Gottlieb came fitfully io his meals, and when he did. qome, ate almost nothing. Each day he grew:'more and more morose ; each night when poor .Aunt Hedwig was not kept awake by her own sorrowful thoughts, her slumbers were broken by hearing her brother pacing heavily the floor of the adjoining room. Zn some sort. he made np for jius loss of sleep at night by sleep- ing of an evening in the little room back of the shop, falling into restless naps (when he should have bean restfully smoking his long pipe), from which he would sometimes start with, a cry of alarm, and wouldd art furtive, horrified glances at , Aunt Hed- wig -and Herr Sohnstein who' were doing nothing of .a horrifying nature, only sitting easily together, more or less 'enfolded in each others arms. It was a little inconsiderate - on the part of the loyers, and very hard on Minna, this ox tcemely open love-making necessarily was by fitful snatches amidst the black desolations of Tompkins Bernara, They f would try to comfort each other, she and Hana, as they stood cheerlessly under the «hill les of the music-stand ; but their .outlook.waB a dreary one.and their effort» in this direction were not crowned with any great success. Sometimes as Minna came home along the west side of the Bcfuajse, tad saw » Spengler's window the ? v. rt*.. wreaths of higTily artiBii.il immortelles with the word " £Uue" up n them ia vivid purple loiters, ehe would fairly .rall to cry'mg over the thong'it that uuMl she should become a fit su'ij ct for such a wrentli there was small chauceB that any real rest would be hers. However, all thi* is aside, froip , Gott- lieb's h<>rrifi<M.I looks ss he waikod from his troubled slumbers-looks which would disappear as he bacarne thoroughly srous -d, bnt only to return »g.iiu after Iii« next uueasy nap; Oao day liö startled Auut Hedwig by asking h;>r if she b Ikf cd ia ghosts. H>"me:nh*riiig hi« s J vere wirdi of condemnation pf lHr caëuttl reference to thc supernatural , be'ngs, it was with some liositntiou that she replied that »lie did. Still in!>re to her SHrprise» Gottlieb turned away from her hurriedly* yet not so hurriedly, hut that she saw » strange, scared look upon his lace, and heard a low and trembling voice fpply, " And so do I." And now the fact may as well bo ad- mitted ,frankly timt a ghost wai the dis- turbing element that was making Gott- lieb's life go wrong-that, as there seethed to be every rea ion to believe, was hurry* ing him towards the gravo j f dr ft middtè aged Garni itt who refuges iib. eaíi wltóíe régulai: sluep forsakes him, and wh¡i acta ally gi vjs up smoking, naturally caáiíot bó exppcted io remain ioug in this world. , was the ghost of his de jd w|to.

Presently sho appeared qi||te as clearly in his wàkiug hours.

' ; Tho Church of tho Rede rapt iou jst Fathers is a very beautiful church, and at all ti mes-save through the watches of] the night and through one mid-day hour-Mts doors stand hospitably open, silently in- viting poor sinners, weary and heavy laden with their sins, to eater into the calm' of its quiet holiness, and there find rest. Tall sleuder pillars uphold ita vaulted-roof in the grainings of which lurk mysterious shadows. Below, a warm, rich light comes through the stained-glass windows, where- on are pictured the blessed St. Alphonsus Maria de Ligurrfi, founder of the Be demptionist Congregation, blessedly instructing the chubby-faee choristers; and tho venerable Clement Hof bauer, " primus in Germany" of fcne Bsdemptioztf ists, all in his black gown, kneeling, pray- ing, no doubt, for the outcast German souls, for the saving of whicli ho worked so hard and so well ; and (a picture-Minna dearly loved) St. Joseph and the sweet Virgin and tho little Christ child fleeing1 together through tiie desert from tho wrath of the Judean King. And arranged around the walls on perches high aloft ure statues of various minor saints and of the Twelve Apostles, of which Minna's fa- vourite was Matthias, becauee tue saint; with his high forehead tending toward baldness, and hm long grey beard and grey hair, and his kiudlV face, an i even the axe in his hand (that was not uulike a baker's peel) made her think always bf her dear father.
