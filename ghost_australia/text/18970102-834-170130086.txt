Short Story. Lassoing a Lover. By. Mrs. M. L. Kaym1. ;. IWithin'a yory snort space of- time— so short that few hnvo uotlced Its dlsaii pcarnncc— there stood a brick i building In the suburbs of the city of Alameilii, which, was a waggoiijslioiiaml a smithy combined. The place, had more than n local reputation, :pii i account of the ex cellence of its work, the smith being especially proficient' in his department, employing' the art of a veterinary alii'-' goon in a rude but 'successful way.' Xor had he. Ills canal In the country 'for . putting a shoe on' n horse, tliuiiiost frac tious animal submitting ; Itself ;:tb hia skilled hand wltiiout -'demonstratioii.. ? Indeed, his' sibilant ' P-s-t; !' : wliistlcd . ? through his teeth in an Indescribable manner, acted like a charm on the most' unruly equine spirit. ' '?'.'.- So Steye' Darner's forge was glowing ' when others were dark and silent, and 1 liis rivals expressed their dislike for him and his successes in many ways. They sneered at him for a half-breed and ' attributed Ills luck to the arts of savagery.. The smith did not care. , There was only one tiling on earth for ; which he did care— that was his beauti ful daughter Pauline, the stately girl who would have graced the most refined home In the State, but who had returned '?? from school with no higher ambition than to servo; Mn her father's kitchen. There w*as little else to the whole abode, save loft; above, but it was as neat and dainty as loving hands could make It. None of the neighbouring houses had such quaint decorations. The wings of bright-plumnged birds crossed on the whJI.n. Bow mid arrows tied with strings of wampum. Moccasins of soft skins, embroidered in rare patterns with niany ? ?? coloured beads, unlike any work done by skilled American hands. »For why V Pauline Darner was the daughter of an -.''-Indian princess, and inherited her right to do such work, for her instincts were thoseof her. mother's picturesque people. r the Tultlcas, whose name means ' art' and who are neither nomads nor idola ters, but a people who are paymasters in all the arts and industries. When the (lark-skinned young wife of Steve Dinner, died, lie went back to civilisation to find himself an alien and his bright-eyed baby squaw, his little woman, an object' of impertinent curi osity. ; 'A marriage with. a squaw Is no mar .-.:- riage at all in- the -eyes of white : law,' said .'the good people .who -.-sustain mis .': 'sious for Christianising the Indians, and ;/y they then: signified their willingness to ('.receive the cliil'd-barbiirian as a ward of ;-;^the-:nationV;;;\;i'-;;:-- '. ???; ''??'.. ??' ' .r\':;But- Steve Damer was loyal to the . V;,v;;hieiupry, of. his dead wife and her people, '.;'.'. and refused to. part .with his Pauline, or i;yfglyie her over -even temporarily to the iy;desplsers of her mother's race. He did, ?^ i'hbweyer, send her to school, where she r'Ci iwas ^treated well, even to the extent of :;^ being admired and petted, for two roas 5-'y;ons/ One was that she was considered ;':: 'a sprig of nobility, however rough and ?:-:..rude tile branch from which she came ; ^i.'-the. other , because phenomenal sums :|5i. we're paid for her expenses, and her ::-';;'father kept himself out of sight.

'??.' -'?Kow she/did uot-go lioiiie, lint straight as an arroV files, slie sought the. lioiue of Harlow Tjlneoln. .... No blush of maiden delicacy staliied her oil vu cheek.' She thought uo r of herself, but' of thu two men she loved, her father and Harlow Ijincoln, who had stolen the sweet possession of her young heart; from her. She knew how much he cherished the chestnut Delight, and that, a fortune awaited him should he win— and— she would save: her father from being a criminal.:-: But Lincoln was away from homo. The, bnclielor menage was closed and no one about but the man who took care of Delight, and the small jockey who on the morrow was to ridehim as he conll dently believed -to. victory. The little, jockey had heard of the In dian princess, but had never seen her, and'he was so pleased with her beauty that lie 'at once took herfor his mascot, and begged a bit of ribbon to wear as his colours. Together they visited the stable and Pauline took a 'look around. 'Does some one watch here all night 5' she asked. . . v'il. do!' said the jockey proudly ; '1 has -.my ; bed 'longside :o' Delight, and ?locks up, and I- has pistols, and; know ?how .to shoot.' .-. . ? . ;. v't-Tlie girl stood by* the : favourite. -who had been watched and' admired; every hour of the day,-' and/was as nerypns as a. woman. ; Pauline touched: the; silky skin that ;shone. in ;.n hundred golden lights in-.the glare of tho.laiitern which the jockey- lighted.; It was beautiful, but she'belpngodtb a peoplo.jthiit.dn not love' the horse, except lis. an article, of diet. But she loved tlie horse's master. Nqt tlnit she admitted it to herself. '?? I, as a relater of 'facts, may shite what 1 know. The native delicacy of her In dian nature -was'.. tempered by the re serve of her white.blood. ?', Not for worlds would she have given Harlow Lincoln a foretaste of that love which could have made his heaven. She went, leaving no message, and much troubled about the course she should pursue. Her father was not at the house, nor did he come later; and at last, she could stand the suspense' ho, longer. She determined to go back to the stable and warn the young man if. he had returned, and iflie were still absent, to caution the little jockey. ' '?':;..': She waited long after coining to this decision, then taking down from -the wall the coil of rawhide that hung there, she hid it under the scrape she wore, and sped away, light of foot but heavy of heart, to the rescue of Delight- and her father. ?- There all was dark and still, except an occasional stamp of the impatient ani mal, or a low whinney, and Pauline called in vain for the boy or any atten dant, and at last finding a window high up in the stable open, she scaled the wall, and groped- her way through the gloom, to a place where she could see the lloor below and Delight in his stall, with the jockey sleeping heavily beside him. The little fellow had been drugged, and would not awaken , for some hours. Pauline was stricken with a horrible fear of the consequences to her father. She was afraid of him, too, when ho had been drinking, and knew he. would not listen to reason. . . , What should she do '! Seating her self on n bale of alfalfa she - tried '.- to think, when she heard a noise at ' a side, entrance to the building; All the' possibilities of the occasion rushed into her mind like a torrent. What if her father did not come, and Harlpw Xin coln did V It .might not be necessary for her to incriminate her father, ??; but' How then could she account for her own presence there ? And the condition1 of. the boy '! And then the door., opened and the outline of a mani appeared^ Ik :lt; was her father! -'? ?'??';*?

Harlow Lincoln could hear that snrt. low voice saying, ' You do not know how to care for precious tilings,' and he real ised as most of us do at some period of our lives that blessings brighten as they take their flight. But lie Is a young man of enterprise, and the tightening of the lasso of love around his affections may yet lead, him to the ranclierio on Big Illvur. which is. not quite at. the end of tlie world.— Mrs., 51.
