PORT ADELAIDE.—The last few days having been very dusty the Portonians have been ip the fnll enjoyment of all the particles that could be scattered about by an unsparing wind unretarded by even the ghost of a watercart. But the discomfort seems to be taken'in good part by the ratepayers, who perhaps feel aa the last year'sjrates have been duly spent in watering, and no street-watering rate yet^declared for the coming year it will be-time enough to grumble when asked to pay one. Meanwhile ihe Corporation are considering the best means of raising water from the Port Stream, and several schemes more or less worthy have been sent in. As tne Corporation get fresh water free at present the onJy benefit hoped for in using salt water is an improvement as a watering agency.
