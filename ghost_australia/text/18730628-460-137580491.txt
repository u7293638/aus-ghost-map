THE FLEMINGTON HOUNDS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AUSTRALASIAN. Â£ir,-Notwithstanding the counter-attrac tions of Croxton-park, there was a good muster of the followers of this club, some 50! members joining the master up.Jthe K^ilor-road from Mr. Woods's at the ap pointed hour. The throw-off was about mid way between the cross-roads and ICeilor, on the left of the road, and over a very pretty country for about three miles. On reaching the river the hounds wheeled to the right, anji - came to a check near the Keilor . Ceknetery. As the pace had been merry and ' the fences numerous, we were glad of 'this ' opportunity of drawing breath. On crossing the road we were soon on the line again, Bud ' from the manner the hounds worked it wajs very evident that the game was afoot. After about five minutes' hard going we ran -inro the deer (who- was saved with great difficulty) near the old Sydney-road. The "blooding the hounds got at Warrnambool i hatl evidently whetted their appetites; and | they were very keen 4)n their game. There i were about a dozen up at the finish of this, ' one of the prettiest this pack has had; ther \- eo&ntry; gone over being all grass and good, although heavygoing. The deer (Mr. Lewis's present) appear to run better every time they-are turned down, this one having gone ' straight from the start Yours, -sc.,' SAM'S GHOST.
