An Old Theatrical's Death. Influenza has been very bad at the Parra- matta and Newington Asylums. On Tuesday night, at George-street Asylum, five of the inmates died. This is about a record. Amongst the number was Darcy Read, who for many years was connected with the stage in these colonies. The wonderful illusion, "Darcy Read's Ghost," ran with considerable success in the colonies some 20 years ago. The funeral, which took place on Wednesday last, was arranged for by Mr. Brough, the well- known actor-manager, on behalf of the pro- fession to which Mr. Darcy Read had belonged.
