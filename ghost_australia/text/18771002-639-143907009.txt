POETRY. UNTIL DEATH.' Ma^t! me 110 vows of constancy, dear friend, To love me, though! die, thy whole life long, And love no other till thy days shall end Nay, it were rash and wrong. If thou canst love another, be it so ; I would not reach out of my quiet grave ?To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go — Love should not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer light than gilds those earthly mourns, Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this lane with thorns. Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, If, after death, my soul linger here ; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thy wert wasting all thy life in woe For my poor sake ; what love thou hast for me, Bestow it ere I go ! Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's graves — a tardy recompense — But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head To shut away the sunshine and the dew ; Let small blossoms grow there, and let grasses wave, And rain-drops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I ; but, trust me, thou canst never find One who will love and. serve thee night and day v,.. With a more single mind. Forget me when I die. The violets Above my rest will blossom just as blue, Nor miss thy tears; e'en Nature's self forgets ; But while I live, be true ! — S. F. News Letter.
