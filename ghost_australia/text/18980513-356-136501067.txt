There was one or two boineiieni'ces in nMr. Cartwright's story which it was impossible to ignore, but more important than everything else, I remembered Dora's words on Tues day. S'"hSle, in what I believed her in fatuation, had declared that Mrs M[an aningtree's actions had been influenced by ',Gartwright's, appearance at The Friars, just: as'she had declared that some awful fate .awaited her. j.lthough terrible., suspicions were gaining strength in my minid, I could not y'et see a way tlhrough the sur rounding miist. I was able. no more to'thilk clearly than to act, whilst in actio~i seemiid to paralyse me. .
