SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB. (FnbRO oUR eroCIAL CORRESPONDENTS.) " ' ELBOURNE, May 2. The annual meeting of the S.A.J.C. was commenced on Saturday, at. Flemo ington, and the day's racing passed off very successfully indeed. The weather was splendid,' and there was a good at tendance, including his Excellency, Sir H. B. and Lady Loch and suite. The racing was excellent, and the Goodwood Handicap, the big race of the day, brought out exactly 20 starters, and of them Topaz was as far as betting indicated merit, con sidered to have the best chance. Iron master, who won last year in best time yet made for the race, had advantage of a year in age and no additional weight, but the horse was hardly well enough to excite any violent fancy for his chance, as the offered odds 100 to 8 plainly hinted. After Topaz, St. Lawrence and Lord Wilton received a fair amount of support, while against anything elsoe liberal odds offered. The light weighted Lantern, who from the first was looked upon as most leniently treated by the handicapper, was barcked to win a fair amount atTatter sall's on the night before the race. Although rather too long in the limbs for a model horse, he yet:looked stout enough to be dangerous with Ost.' 12lb. in a mile race. He had the good fortune to get clear of,the ruck the instant the word to go was given, and he went away with a bound, and was never caught again, winning easily by three lengths. South Australia claimed another placed horse in the second, but whatever chance Topaz had was lost by the delay at the start, which cost him a dozen lengths.
