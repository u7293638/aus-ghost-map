CALIFORNIAN MAIL EXTRACTS. {From the European Mail, July 28.) The freedom of the city was, on July 10, presented to Sir Bartle 1 rere with the usual ceremonies Vi hat ever honours Sir Bartle Frere enjojs have been won bj sheer hard work and by unflinching discharge of the most difficult duties He 13 no young man just returned from thesatisfactoiv discharge of a diffi- cult task For more than forty j ears he has given his best services to the Indian Empire, and in all that time he has never lost sight of the great necessity which exists, and which always has existed, for pub- lic works on au immense scale Hie bane of India is, of couise, the constitue and habitual di ought which dries up the spimgs and impoverishes the watercouises to an extent hardly credible bj the «taj at-home Englishman This want Sir Bartle Frere supplied in a manner simply marvellous throughout the district over which he had command, with results ot which the present dist!ess 111 India can best tell the talc Nor do Sir Birtle Trere's claims to recognition stop at this point What he did during the Indian mutiny all the world knows perfectlj well, but his seivices to the cause of humanity have since that time been on an even largei scale The mission to Z inzibar may not have been the wisest or best con- sidered method of stopping the slave trade on the Eastern Coast of Africa, but under all circumstances it is possible that it was the only one which could be adopted At all events, it has been as successful as could ha Fe been hoped for, and that fact alone is sufficient to account tor the honour-- conventional though it be-winch has been conferred upon the negotiator of a tieaty which it maj be hoped will do much to put an eud to the East African slave trade Dr Thudichum should be a little more cautious in future.

But we confess that we do not remember any case save this one of a mau foigetting even for the moment that he was Prime Minister, although our history is full of in- stances of fallen statesmen forgetting for the moment that they did not hold the office Tlio suggestion has been made that kangaroos might be generally cultivated in parks aud other enc osures in this countiy, and it is probable that they would prove quite as useful as deei A French n tuiahst, M Comely, h is recently published some ro.el information on this subject, which seems to show tint the proposal is,peifectlj feioible in every waj The e\penence of the various zoological so- cieties m Europe show that this marsupial w ill thrive and bieed in our climate, damp being the only condition which 13 fat ii to it It will bear great extremes ot heat and cold without injury.

On being released, they are so eager in search of grass that they do not touch the tree3 As an ornamental adjunct to an English puk, the presence of kan- garoos would prove novel, if notvery valuable The humidity of the climate, we fear, would be against their introduction Ths Hon David A Wells, whose speech, delivered before tile Cobden Club list year, on the lesulta of Protection m the United States, has since been effectively circulated in all the colonies through the medium of the Club, has undertaken to contribute a senes of papers on the same subject to the Melbourne Art/us, which will be republishod with a view to assist the Fiee Trade movement íecently inaugurated in Austiiiha bj' the Legislature of New South Wales, under the direction of Mr Parkes With reference to the United States, Mr. Wells, in a letter addressed to Mr. T. B. Pottei, MP, as Hon Secretary of the Cobden Club, states his belief that after the defeat of the Protectionists interests in the last session of Con- gres«, another bill increasing duties will never again become law. " My piedictions of list year," he adds, " concerning the npid progress of Free Trade, are being more than verified. The next Presidential election will show Free Trade as one of the great political elements, and I think we shall elect a President and a Con- gress that wi'l give Protection its death-stroke." Mr Wells was this year elected by the French In- stitute to fill the place of the late Mr John Stuart Mill in the Department of Moral and Political Science. A few days ago a farmei in Strathbogie-a worthj' elder of the church, too-who had been Very unfor- tunate with his cattle, was determined to counteiact the spell which seemed to have been cast over them, and, for that purpose, gathered together an immense quantity of peats, &c;, and the last animal that died was buried therein, the pile lighted, and the whole consumed Whether the burning had the desired effect or not we have yet to learn. This happened within a short distance of the ghost-haunted castle of Beldornej. In honour of the memory of King William, and the Battle of the Boyne, the Orangemen of Scotland held demonstrations of unwonted magnitude on the anniversary of that day. At Glasgow nearly ten thousand persons assembled, and marched to a field about foui miles from the city, where enthusiastic speeches were delivered, and resolutions passed m favour of the Church of Scotland Patronage Bill and against Popery. Another fete of Orangemen was held at Greenock Park, in which over five thousand persons took part, SheiiffLamond.Dunfermlme has given judgment in an action brought by an arast of that town against the Noith British Railwaj, in which damages were laid on account of the defenders having failed to des pitch to London a case contunmg paintings m time for the Roj al Academy Exhibition, thus " losing for him a probable market, and frustrating his endea- vours to raise his reputation." His Lordship decided that the injury was too remote to sustain an action, and theiefoie a«soilzied the defender«. lUe large and lucrative industry which his sprung up on the Americm coasts in the preservation of lobsters in tina has induced some energetic persons to start a lobster farm near Boston, where an area of about 32 acres has been laid out and protected for the purpose of cultivating the lobster On the sea- ward side it is closed by binks, having hatches or sluices so as to admit of the flow and ebb of the tide Last summer about 40,000 lobsters, of all sizes, were deposited m this ground The maimed and the halt and the lime md probably the blind are accommo- dated with quarters where they can recover their lost claws, and a a tche for the infantine population is provided, where they can increase without the ordinary dangers attendant on lobstenal infancy Food, m the shape of refuse fish ¿.a, is liberally supplied to tins interesting can/ munitj In the winter, the managers evinced the natural deceitfulness of human nature by catching and scalding the lobsters on which so much attention "has been lavished, and a fine harvest rewarded them, 15 000 fine lobsters were sold, and the success of the experiment «eems complete Besides lobsters, it is I intended that the farm shall he turned to account by being made a nursery for fish of various kinds As a matter of fact, many eels and other fishes were caught in the spring The venture seems a very successful one , and, in view of the enormous drain on the natural lobster grounds of America, it is very necesspry that some such steps should be taken, as a supplement to the îegulations proposed to prevent overfishmg, and fishing in the breeding season On July 15 a large quantity of property in Glasgow, the value of which is estimated at between ¿30,000 and £40,000, was destroyed by the bursting of a canal in the extreme north-eastern district oE the city. The Monkland Canal, which is the water high- way between Glasgow and Edinburgh, runs through a large chemical work and ironworks ; but for some time workmen have been engaged making a diversion of the canal, the object being to put the waterway on the south side of these works. The water was locked out of the new portion of the canal, and there was à great pressure of water near to the junction of the original channel and the new portion, which caused the disaster. The Viox says that Karatchew, a Russian sailor, who was sentenced to imprisonment for not shaving his beard, is now in punishment at Schlasselbnrg, and still refuses to shave. The commandant, not having authority to allow him to wear his beard, has written for instructions! The other night two men knocked at a ^ate at Mendon, near Swor is and were admitted by a care tiker, a man named Brien Immediately the men made a savage attick on Buen, one of them dealing him a heavj blow with a hatchet on the side of the heid, which felltd linn to the earth, and tendered lum senseless The assailants then took possession of a double-barrelled gun and decanipBd.

A market or goods tram, from Bristol, when a little past Moulsford Station, was suddenly brought to a stoppage bj two fat beasts falling through the bottom of the truck in which they were being convejed The effect was to throw five trucks off the line, and block the way One of the beasts was cut to pieces, and the other was so seriously injured that it had to be killed im lnedntelj There were other cittle in the truck, and it hnd to be boarded up to prevent them meet- ing with a similar fate Assistance was obtained from Reading to clear the line, but the train was de laj ed some seven hours Dr Harding, of Wadhurst, his successfully ex- tracted a French musket bullet from the liBnd of James Jenner, weighing over three-quarters of an ounce, which was firmly embedded in him at the Battle of Waterloo In spite of the inconvenience arising from the bullet during nearly 60 years, the man has worked umnterruptedlj ns an agricultural labourer in the parish, where he bears an excellent character He is eighty j ears of age The Prince of Orange has li id a narrow escape from such an accident as that which caused the death of the Duke of Orleans in 1847. The prince was driving a tilbury teal Vjverberg, at the Hague, when the horse struck against a stone and fell, the prince being thrown out over the head of the animal Although his Royal Highness received some severe bruises he was up in a moment, and he bad got the horse on its legs agam before the servants had re- covered from the terror occasioned bj the accident Au enormous decrease has taken Jplace during the past six months in the number of emigrants sailing from the Mersey It is calculated thnt the emigrants during this period were less numerous to the extent of 49,357 persons than m the previous 13 months During the quaiter ending June 30 there were 3J,846 emigrants to vanous parts of the worid, which also shows a lar¡,e deciease as com- pared with the same period lastyeir During the month of June 14,6IJ7 emigrants sailed, against 18,603 in June 1873 Two cases of heavy play (a London correspondent states) are now being talked of in West End circles. At one of the best Pall Mall clubs the other evening a foreign Prince, who resides chiefly in England, won ¿£4000 at écarte from a young gentleman whose con- duct is not at all excused by the fact that he will have considerable difficulty in paying the money, if he ever pays itat all. At another club, a little further west, a certain gallant captain, renowned for his astuteness on the turf, was clever enough to lose £2000 to a well-known baronet at hazard, but in this case a cheque was handed over on the spot. It seems from the official statistics that, of the whole surface of England and Walts, less than 4 per cent,, or only 1,433,000 acres out of a total of 37,319,000 acres, is occupied by woods, coppices, and plantations. Treating the three ridings of Yorkshire as separate counties. Sussex is the only cbunty which returns more than 100,000 acres o I wood, nearly 11 per cent, of its area being thus clothed. The woods of Hampshire are next in magnitude, embracing some 87,000 acres, but forming only 8 ppr cent, of that countj''s area. Kent follows with 78,000 acres of woodland, while the adjoining county of Surrey, although returning only some 48,000 acres of wood, shows amiost as high a percentage as its neighbour Sussex, pince very nearly one-tedth of its whole area is thus employed. These four counties, Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, appear to possess a much larger extent of woodland relptively to their size than any other area in England.
