Yet this rare beast smelt hin before he saw himn, whnlting, groaning, ?ttd tumlling t ithll such anl expression of acqulaintance, that, beinllg informeld by thet keepers how hie aeoun, Bull so prevailed that the keepers opened the grate, tlld iBull went in. But no dog could fawnt mlme on his muster thant the lion onl himt, licking his feet sand hands,' nsd tumbling to and fro, to the wonder of all the beholders. Bull wits quite satisiali with Itis reeoguitiot, and mlntaiged to get out of tile grate ; but when thoelioa saws his friend golne, tno beast, by hellow:n g, roairing,scratching, and howling, could ex press more riage and sorrow; tinither wwould hei eat or drink for four iwhole days after wards."
