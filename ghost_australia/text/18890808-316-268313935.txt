A Hardy Norseman C H A P T E R 'XMIXI—continued. Bv EDNA LYALL, Author of " Donovan? " We Two," " /« ilte G Days" " KmgJit- Erraui," . For the n e x t d a y or two Fntliiof realised little. T o the surprise a n d deliglit of all h e slept almost incessantly, waking only to take food, .to m a k e sure that Sigrid w a s with him, a n d to enjoy a delicious sense of ease,and relief. " H e is out of the w o o d now," said D r . M o m s , cheerfully. " Y o u c a m e just in time, Miss Falck. B u t I will give you one piece of advice; if possible, stay in ; England a n d m a k e your h o m e with him.: H e ought not to be so m u c h alone." ' " You think that h e m a y h a v e such an attack again ?" asked Sigrid, wistfully. " No, I don't say that at all. H e has a wonderful constitution, a n d there is n o reason why h e should ever break d o w n again. 'But h e is m o r e likely to get depressed if h e is alone, a n d you will b e uble to. prevent his life from, growing too monotonous." So as she lived through those quiet days in the sick-room, Sigrid r a c k e d h e r beam to t h m k of s o m e w a y of m a k i n g money, a n d searched, a s so m a n y w o m e n fcave done before her, the columns of the newspapers, a n d m a d e fruitless inquiries and wasted both time a n d m o n e y in the attempt. O n e day, Roy, c o m m g m a t his usual hour in the morning to relieve guard, brought her a fat envelope which he had found waiting for her in the halL She opened it eagerly, a n d m a d e a little exclamation of disappointment a n d vexation. "Anything w r o n g ? " h e a s k e d . She began to laugh, t h o u g h h e fancied he saw tears m her eyes. " Oh," she said, " it seems so ridiculous w h e n I h a d been expecting such great things from it Y o u know I have b e e n trying to h e a r of w o r k in London, and there was an'advertisement in the p a p e r which said, that t w o pounds a week might easily b e realised either by m e n or w o m e n without interfering with their present occupations, a n d that all particulars would -be given o n the receipt of eigliteenpence. S o I sent the money, a n d here is a wretched aluminium pencil in. return, a n d I- a m to make this two pounds a w e e k by getting orders for them." The absurdity of the whole thing struck her m o r e forcibly, a n d she laughed again more merrily j R o y l a u g h e d too. " Have you m a d e a n y other attempts ?" he asked. " Oh, yes," said Sigrid," I b e g a n to try in Norway, a n d even attempted • a story: and sent it to one of our best novelists to ask his opinion." " A n d what.did he s a y ? " "Well," she said, smiling, " h e wrote back very kindly, but said that h e could not conscientiously r e c o m m e n d a n y o n e to write stories w h o s e sole idea in takingup r the profession w a s the m a k i n g of money. • -My conscience pricked -me -there - a n d s o I never tried writing again a n d never will. T h e n the other d a y I wrote to another place which advertised, a n d got back a stupid bundle of embroidery patterns. It is m e r e waste of m o n e y answering these things.- T h e y say w o m e n can earn a guinea a time for shaving poodles, but you see X h a v e n o experience in poodles," a n d s h e . l a u g h e d merrily. . • Roy sat musing over the perplexities of ordinary, life. H e r e was h e with m o r e money than h e k n e w w h a t to d o -with, and here was t i e w o m a n b e loved struggling in vain to earn a few shillings. . Y e t tlic mere fact that h e -worshipped, her made him chivalrously careful to avoid laying her under a n y ^obligation. A s far as possible h e would serve her, but m this vital question of m o n e y it s e e m e d that he could only stand aside and-watch her efforts. N o r did h e dare to confess the truth to h e r as yet, far. h e perceived quite plainly that she was absorbed in Fritlnof, a n d could notpossibly for s o m e time to c o m e be' free .even to: consider her own personal life. jClearly.igt present she regarded h i m withithat f r a n k friendliness which h e remewoered well at Balholm, a n d in ! his helpfulness h a d discerned: nothing; that tiecf b e construed as the attentions of a /over. After all h e w a s her brother's s;!e friend in England, a n d it was nat ural enough that h e should d o allthat h e c<ul8 ,do for them, •.; " M y father a n d m o t h e r c o m e h o m e to-night," 1 e said rat length, '* a n d if : you will allov m e I will a s k t h e m if they know o p n y t M n g likely to suit you. , Cecil will b e W T anxious : to m e e t you again. Don'tyou: think you might g o for a drive withier to-morrow afternoon? I would be K e with your brother." 'Oh, I should so like to m e e t her apin," said Sigrid, " w e all liked her so pich last s u m m e r ; - I don't feel that I -.ally k n o w h e r at- all yet,: for . she is not /ery easy to know, but s h e interested-me just because of t h a t " " I don't: t h m k a n y one can k n o w Cecil who : has not lived with her," said Roy, " she is so very reserved." " Y e s ; at first I thought she was- just gentle a n d quiet without very m u c h character, but . one ,day w h e n w e 'were out togetherwe tried to get s o m e b r a n c h e s of willow. T h e y were- so stiff ,to b r e a k that I lazily g a v e up, b u t she held o n to hers with ; a strong .look in her iface which quite startled m e , a n d said, ' I can't b e beaten just b y a branch.'" " That is Cecil all over/' said R o y , smiling; " s h e never would let anything daunt her. M a y I tell her that you will see her to-morrow ? " Sigrid gladly assented; a n d the next day both Mrs;: Boniface- a n d Cecil jdrove to the little house at VauxhalL R o y brought Signd; d o w n to Iheearriage,: a n d with a very^happy satisfied.feeling 'introduced her to his m o t h e r a n d watched the warm meeting with Cecil " I can t think w h a t would h a v e b e c o m e of Fnthiof if illiad not b e e n Tor all your u n d u e said Sigrid.

T h e details differ, the acces somes are strangely different; but the love,, which is t h e great mainspring of life, is precisely the s a m e all the world-over. " W h a t -makes • m e so miserable," said olden Sigrid, " is to feel that his life is, as it were, over, though he is so y o u n g ; it has been spoiled a n d ruined for.him w h e n he is but one-and-twenty." \- . : " But the very fact of his being so y o u n g seems to m e to give hope that brighter things are in store for him," said Mrs. Boniface. " I d o not think : so," said. Signd. " T h a t girl has- taken something from h i m which can never c o m e again ; it does n o t s e e m to m e possible that a m a n can love h k e that twice in a lifetime." Perhaps not just in that way," said Mrs. Boniface. " A n d besides," said Sigrid; " w h a t girl would care to take such love as he m i g h t n o w b e able to give ? I a m sure nothing would induce m e to accept a n y secondary love of that kind." S h e spoke as a perfectly heart-whole girl, frankly a n d unreservedly. A n d what she said w a s true. ;She never could h a v e been satisfied with less than the whole ; it w a s h e r nature to exact m u c h ; she could love very: devotedly, but s h e would, jealously d e m a n d a n equal devotion in return: •.-. Now Cecil w a s of a wholly different type. • Already love h a d taken possession of her, it .had stolen into h e r heart almost unconsciously a n d h a d brought grave shadows into h e r quiet life, shadows cast t by the sorrow of another. H e r notion of t love w a s simply freedom to love a n d serve; to give her this freedom • there m u s t of course b e true love o n the other side, but of its kind or of its degree she would never trouble herself to think. F o r already her love w a s so pure a n d d e e p that it rendered her almost selfless. Sigrid's speech troubled her for a m m u t e o r t w o ; if o n e girl could speak so, w h y not all girls ? W a s s h e p e r h a p s less truly, w o m a n l y that she, thought less of w h a t was owing to herself? , .," It m a y be so," s h e admitted, yet • with a l a t e n t consciousness that so infinite -a' thing as love could n o t b e b o u n d by a n y hard a n d fast rules. " But I cannot help it. . W h e t h e r it is w o m a n l y or not 1 would die to give h i m the least real comfort." " Tell Harris t o s top,-Cecil," said Mrs. Boniface. " W e will get s o m e grapes for Mr. Falck." A n d glad to escape from the carriage for a m m u t e , a n d glad, too, to b e of use even in such a far-ofi way, Cecil went into the fruiterers, returning before long with a beautiful ^basket of grapes a n d flowers.-, C H A P T E R X I X . " S E E w h a t I h a v e brought .you," said Sigrid, re-entenng the sick-room a little later on. Frithiof took the basket a n d looked, with a pleasure- which a f e w weeks a g o would h a v e "been impossible to l n m , a t the lovely flowers a n d fruit. " You lirLvccomc junt ct tUi^ j lime, for h e will insist o n talking- of all the deepest things in h e a v e n a n d earth," said Roy, " a n d this . m a k e s , a g o o d diver-' sion " " T h e y are f r o m Mrs. Boniface. Is it not kind of her? A n d d o you know, Frithiof, she a n d Dr.: Morris h a v e b e e n m a k i n g quite a d e e p plot; they w a n t to transplant us bodily to R o w a n T r e e House, a n d Dr. Morris thinks the m o v e could d o you n o h a r m n o w that you are getting better." H i s face lighted u p with something o f its f o r m e r expression. " H o w I should like never to see: this hateful r o o m again !.'• h e exclaimed.: " Y o u don't k n o w h o w I detest it. T h e old ghosts s e e m to haunt it sull. J here nothing that I can b e a r to look at except; our picture of Bergen, which h a s d o n e m e m o r e than o n e good turn." ; ; ! Sigrid. partly to keep h i m from talking too m u c h , partly because she always liked! to tell people of thatlittle act of kindness; gave R o y the history of the picture, a n d F n t h i o f lay musing: over the curious relative power of kindness a n d cruelty, a n d w a s obliged, though s o m e w h a t reluctantly,to admit to himself that a very slight act of kindness certainly did «xert; a n e n o r m o u s a n d -unthought of influence.

" Surely t h a t c a n only pauperize the people." " I certainly, don't m e a n indiscriminate almsgiving," said Mr. Boniface; " I m e a n only this. Y o u start with your o w n family; d o your duty b y them. Y o u have a constant succession of servants jjassing through , your household ; be. a friend to them.

H o w simply a n d unostentatiously Mr. Boniface lived out his o w n theory Fnthiof : k n e w quite well. H e reflected that all the kindness h e himself h a d received h a d not tended to pauperize him, had:not"in : the least crushed his independence or m i u r e d h i s self-respect O n the contrary, it b a d saved h i m from utter ruin, a n d h a d a w a k e n e d i n h i m a gratitude whicli wouldlast all his life. But this -new cure was, not to d e p e n d only on taxation or on the State, but. o n a great influence working ithin each individual. T h e idea set h i m hinking, alid the sense of his own ignornce weighed u p o n him. O n e m o r n i n g it chanced that, sitting ut in the verandah at the b a c k of the ouse, h e overheard- Lance's, reading-: esson, which was going on in the m o r n - ing room.

" Y o u talk as if- it were a sort of science," said Cecil. : " T h a t is precisely w h a t it seems t o m e ; a n d just as one m a h is - born with a love of botany, another takes, naturally to astronomy, a n d a third has n o , turn for science .whatever,-but is fond o f hunting rand fishing, so -it seems to m e -with religion.

" W e are talking of two different things," said CeciL " It is of the m e r e framework of religion that you are speaking. . -Very likely m a n y , of us • are born without any taste for theology, or sermons, or Church history.

" I m e a n knowing a n d loving God,'! she said, after a moment's pause. - H e r .tone was very, gentle, a n d not in the least didactic: - " I have believed in a G o d a l w a y s — m o r e or less," said Fnthiof, slowly. "'But h o w do you get to k n o w H i m ? " • " I think it is something ,in the s a m e w a y that people get to know, e a c h other," said Cecil.

A n d perhaps that was just as well, for the picture was a sad one a n d would certainly have cast a shadow upon their hearts.
