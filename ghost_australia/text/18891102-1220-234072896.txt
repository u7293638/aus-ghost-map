Poetry . Conscience and Fntnre Judgment. \- XT CHAHIiES W. STOBBS. Tsat al an ft with my oonfcciense. In a p>'at!e whrr« time had ceased, And we talked ot my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I ehould have to answer The question it put to me, \- And to lace tha answer arid question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Game floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Wer3 alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my paBt life WaB an awful thing to face, Alone with-my conscience Bitting In that solemnly silent plaoe. And I thought of a far away warning, "V . Of a sorrow that was to be mine, ; In a land that then was the fntnre, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to be, \- But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a fntnre To thiB land beyond the grave ; Bat no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my pastlife Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew the'far-away warnirig Had a warning of yesterday — And I pray I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry in the future And no one come to save. And so I have learned a lesion ' Which I ought to have known before, And whiob, though I learned in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience, In the plaoe where the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will ceaBe. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone with my oonsoienoe Will be judgment enough for me.
