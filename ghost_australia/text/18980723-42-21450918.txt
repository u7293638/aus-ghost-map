Storm-clouds Brightened. A Sermon by the REV. DR. TALMAGE. "And now men see hot the bright light which is in the clouds."—Job xxxvii. 21. There are a hundred men looking for storm where there is one man looking for sqnshine. My object will be to get you and myself into the delightful habit of making the best of everything. lv Make the very best of your financial misfortune*. During the panic a few years ago many lost money. Some of you lost it In most unaccountable way*. For the question, ■'♦How many thousands v dotlaxaV shall I put aßide this year ?" you substi tuted the question, " How shall I pay my butcher, and baker, and clothier ?" You had the sensation of rowing hard with two oars, and yet going downstream. You did not say much about it because it was not politic'to speak much of financial embarrassment ; but your wife knew. Less variety of wardrobe, more economy at the table, self-denial in art and tapestry. Com pression, retrenchment. Who did not feel the necessity of it ? My friend, did you make the best of this ? Are you aware of how narrow an escape you had ? Suppose you had reached the fortune toward which you were rapidly going. What then ? You would have been aB proud as Lucifer. How few men have succeeded largely in a financial sense and yet maintained their simplicity and religious consecration ! There are glorious excep tions, but the too general rule is that in proportion as a man gets well off for this world he gets poorly off for the next. He loses his sense of dependence on God. He gets a distaste for prayer meetings. With plenty of bank stocks and plenty of Govern ment securities, what does that man know of the prayer, "Give me this day my daily bread" ? How few men largely suc cessful in this world are bringing souls to Christ, or showing self-denial for others, or are eminent for piety ? One of the old covetous souls, when he was sick, and sick unto death, used to have a basin brought In—a baßln filled with gold ; and his only amusement and the only relief he got for his inflamed hands was running them down through the gold and turning It up in the basin. What de stroying power money has for many a man ! Now, you were sailing at thirty knotß the hour toward these vortices of worldliness —what a mercy it waß. that honest defalca tion ! It may be that the same divine hand that crushed your storehouse, your office, your insurance company, lifted you out of destruction. " Oh," you say, " I could get along very well myself, but I am so disappointed that I cannot leave a competence for my chil dren." My brother, the same financial mis fortune that saves your soul may save your children. With the anticipation of large for tune, how much industry would your chil dren have ?—without which habit of indus try there is no safety. The young man would say, " Well, there's no need of my working ; my father will soon step out, and then I'll have just what I want." He is not as much worried about your rheumatism and shortness of breath as you are. The only fortune worth anything that you can give your child is the fortune you put in his head and heart. Where are the burial places of the men who started life with a fortune ? Some of them in the potter's field ; some in the suicide's grave. But few of these men reached 36 years of age. As you sat this morning at your break fast table and looked into the faces of your children, perhaps you said within your self, " Poor things ! How I wish I could start them in life with a competence! How I have been disappointed In all my expectations of what I would do for them !" Upon that scene of pathos I break with a paean of congratulation, that by your finan cial losses your own prospects for heaven, and the prospect for the heaven of your children, are mightily improved. You may have lost a toy, but you have won a palace. " How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !" "It Is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the king dom of heaven." What does that mean ? It means that the grandest blessing God ever bestowed upon you was to take your money away from you. Let me here say, in passing, do not put much stress on the treasures of this world. Tou cannot take them along with you. At any rate, you cannot take them more than two or three miles ; you will have to leave them at the cemetery. 2\. Make the very best of your bereave ments. The tendency is to brood over these separations, and to give much time to the handling of mementoes of the de parted, and to make long visitations to the cemetery, and to say, "Oh, I can never look up again ; my hope 1b gone ; my courage 1b gone ; my religion 1b gone ; my faith in God 1b gone ! Oh, the burden of this loneliness !" The most frequent bereavement Is tbo lost of children. If your departed child had lived as long as you have lived, do .you not suppose that he would have had about the same amount of trouble and trial that you have had ? If you could make a choice for your child between forty years of annoyance, logs, vexation, exasperation, and bereavements, and forty years In hea ven, would you take the responsibility of choosing the former ? Betides that, my friends, you are to look at this matter as a self-idenlal on your part for their benefit. If yo.ur children want to go off In a May Day party—if your children want to go on a flowery and musical excursion—you consent. You might prefer to have them with you, but their Jubilant absence satisfies you. Weil, your departed children have only gone out in a May Day party, amid flowery and musical entertainment, lifted up to the plane of heaven. That ought to quell some of your grief, the thought of thoir gladness. Make the best of all bereavements. The fact that you have so many friends in heaven will make your own departure very cheerful. When you are going on a voyago everything dependß upon where your friends »re —If they are on the wharf that you leave or on the wharf toward which you are going to sail. The more friends you have in heaven the easier it will be to get away from this world. Some of you have so many brothers. Bisters, children, friends in heaven, that I do not know hardly how you are going to crowd through. When the vessel came from foreign lands and brought a prince to our harbour the ships were covered with bunting, and you re member how the men-of-war thundered broadsides ; but there was no joy there com pared with the joy which shall be demon strated when you sail up the broad bay of Statue of Hercules, Victoria Square.

What i» d«ath to a mother whose, children are in heaven ? Why, there is no more grief In it than there is In her going into a nursery amid the romp and laughter of her household. Though all around may be dark, see you not the bright lltft in the clouds—that light the irradiated faces of your glorified kindred ? S. Make the best of your sicknesses. When you see one move off with elastic step and In full physical vigour, sometimes you become impatient with your lame foot When a man descries an object a mile off, and you cannot see it at all, you become impatient of your dim eye. When you hear of a robust man ' making a great achievement you-becomejmpatient with your depressed nervous system or your enfeebled gait I will tell you^jaow you can make the wont of it. Brcfed over it: brood over all tbese Illnesses, and your nerves will become more twitchy, and your dys pepiia more aggravated, and your weakness more appalling. But that la the devil's work. God tells you there Is light in the clouds, and even dawn here ; for all who believe in Jesus are not only " Justi fied from all things." >ut have " peace and joy in the Holy Ghost" Which of the Bible/men most attract your attention—'Moses, Job, David, Paul ? Ton have chosen those who were physically dis ordered ! Moses—l know he was nervous, from the clip he gave the Egyptian. Job —hls_ blood was vitiated and diseased, and his skin distressfully eruptive. David—he had a running sore, which he speaks of when he says, "My sore ran In the night and ceased not." Paul—>e had a lifetime sickness, which the commentator* -liaVa~. been guessing about for years, not knowing exactly what the apostle' meant by " a thorn In the flesh." Ido not khoweeither ; but it was something sharp, something that stuck him. I gather from all this that physical disorder may be the means of grace to the soul. You say you have so many temptations from bodily ailments, and If you were only well, you think, you could be a good Christian. While your tempta tions may be different, they are no more than those of the .man who has an appetite three times a day, and sleeps eight hours every night. From my observation, I judge that in valids have a more rapturous view of the next world than robust people. The best view of the Delectable Mountains is through the lattice of the sickroom. There are trains running every hour between pillow and throne, between hospital and mansion, Oh, I wish some of you people who are compelled to cry "My head, my head !" would try some of the Lord's medicine ! You are going to be well, anyhow, before long. Heaven is an old city, but has never yet reported one case of sioknesa or one bill of mortality. "The inhabitants shall never say, lam sick." " There shall be no more pain." 4\. Make the best of life's finality. Many people have an idea chat death is the submergence of everything pleasant by everything doleful. If my subject could close in the upsetting of such preconceived notions It would close well. Who shall judge of the features of death —whether they are lovely or whether they are repulsive ? You ? You are too far off. If,l want to get a judgment as to what really the features of death are, I will ask those who have been within a month of death, or a week of death, or an hour of death, or a minute of death. They stand so near the features, they can tell. They give unanimous testimony, if they are Christian people, that death, instead of being demoniac, is cherubic. Of all the millions of Christians who have been car ried to the cemetery, gather up their dying experiences, and you will find they nearly all died in joy. How often you have seen a dying man Join in the psalm being sung around his bedside, the middle of the verse opening to let his ransomed spirit free ! —4ong after the lips could not speak, look ing upward. •Some of you talk as though God had ex hausted Himself in building this world, and that all the rich curtains He ever made He hung around this planet, and all the flowers He ever grew He had woven into the carpet of our daisied meadows. No. This world is not the best thing God can do ; this world is not the best thing that God has done. One season I had two springtimes. I went to New Orleans in April, and I marked the difference between going towards New Orleans and then coming back. As I went on down towards New Orleans, the verdure, the foliage, became thicker and more beau tiful. When I came back, the further I came towacd home the less the foliage, and less and less it became until there was hardly any. Now, it all depends upon the direction in which you travel. If a spirit from heaven should come to ward our world, he is travelling from June toward December, from radiance toward darkness, from hanging irtrdens toward ice bergs. And one would «ot be very much surprised if a spirit of God sent forth from heaven toward our world snould be slow to come. But how strange it is that we dread going out toward that world, when going is from December toward June—from the snow of earthly storm to the snow of Edenic blossom—from the arctics of trouble toward the tropics of eternal joy ! We get so at tached to the malarial marsh In which we live that we are afraid to go up and live on the hilltop ! I am amazed at myself and at yourself for this infatuation under which we all rest. I congratulate anybody who has a right to die. " But," says some one, " it pains me so much to think that I must lose the body with which my soul has so long companion ed." You do not lose it. You no more lose your body by death than you lose your watch when you take it to have it repaired, or your jewel when you take it to have tt reset, or the faded picture when you take it to have it touched up, or the photograph of a friend when you have it put in a new locket. You do not lose your body. Paul may not go to Rome to get hit ; George Oookman may not go to the bottom of the Atlantic to get hia ; and we may not go to the Village churchyards and the city cemeteries to get ours ; but we will have our perfect spirit rejoined to our perfect body,'and Jwe-w^lb» the kind of men and women that the resurrection ; morning will make possible. Death allows us To have" V perfect body, free of all aches, united for ever with a perfect soul free from all sin. Those Christians who in this world lost their friends, and lost their property, and lost their health, and lost their life, will find out that God was always kind, and that all things worked together for their good, and that those were the wisest people on earth who made the best of everything, be cause they saw God in all. Oh, friends, if you desire peace here, and paradise here after, look to that bright Light in the clouds —Jesus Christ, in Whose blood those who believe in Him are washed from every stain of guilt ! Out of a small population of about two and a-half millions, there are in Finland 36,000 more women than men. This may. perhaps, in some measure account for the wonderful way tn which the women have pushed themselves to the front, and ceased to look upon matrimony as the only pro fession open to girls.

What Surgeon-Major-Oeneral Hamilton says about explosive bullet* (says the " Hos pital") Is important, aa showing how very greatly their effects exceeded those pro duced by modern projectiles, even when their coststmction is modified, a« in the dum-dum bullet, and we cannot tail at once to see how desirable it was that their use in warfare should be prohibited as it was by the Oeneva Convention. As is well known, the old Snider, which wu a large expanding bullet, was a most deadly mis sile. It had a hollow in front which was filled by a plug of wood or clay, while the base was also hollowed and plugged. On impact it became completely expanded and deformed, causing most terrible in juries to soft parts as well as to bones. The next step was to leave out the plug in front, forming a hollow space there, over which the lead was drawn, so that there was a closed cavity filled with air. On impact this |dr^rW rsJQ^ngrlF'conYVM|MK9M|(l tore the bullet open, much as a small charge of powder would have done. The " smashing" power of this bullet was so great that it was adopted for sporting purposes. "On soft-bodied animals, such as-tigers and panthers, its effects were woiraerful, the biggest tiger often dropping dead to a single shot when well placed." The true explosive bullet, however, against which the Oeneva Convention legislated was a still more terrible projectile, and when fairly struck with it no soft-bodied animal could do fur ther mischief. The bullet was cast in two parts. The base was hollow, and was nearly filled with ordinary powder, then a piece of thin cloth was laid over the top and the apex was fitted in, and the two were closed together in a machine. Through the front portion of the conical bullet so formed there was a hollow, leading from the apex to the cloth over the powder. Into this hollow detonating powder was poured, the hole was closed with wax, and the affair was com plete. On impact the detonating powder went off, but the gunpowder was sufficiently slow In exploding to allow the bullet to penetrate before it broke up. This was a typical form of explosive bullet, and most deadly in it* effects. " I shot a great deal of heavy game with It in India," says Surgeon-Major-General Hamilton, " and never lost an animal I knew I had struck. I have seen a stag 15 hands high hit behind the shoulder collapse on the spot, as if lta legs had turned Into Jelly. On one occa sion I saved my life by killing a charging bear in dense jungle, dropping her within a few feet of me. In this case I observed amoke issuing not only from the wound, but also from the mouth and nostrils, and on opening the chest found the lungs and heart torn to pieces." Let us be thankful for the Oeneva Convention, which prohibited the use of such missiles against man.
