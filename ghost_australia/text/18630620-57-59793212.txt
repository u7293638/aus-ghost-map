THE GROG THAT WE DRINK IN AUSTRALIA A New Patriotic Song (BY RORY "O'MORE, ESQ.) Rich as the blushes of sweet Colleen Bawn, And soft as thw shadow of ghost ; Tender and true as the midnight "Blue," When courting the cook on his.post- Is the rum that we drink in Australia ! Is the brandy that blooms in Australia ! Is the whiskey we prize in Australia! Sweet as a minister hastening away, For the pay that will soon make him smile ; Coy as the " patriots " in Charley's own bowers, Whilst seeking a "billet" the while Is the tipple we taste in Australia ! Is the tooth that we draw in Australia ! Is the nobbler we love in Australia ! And oh, may a duty so hoary and high, Ne'er sadden our heart's with its smart, And oh, may dear Love from n " breeze" in the night, Glide out in the glee of his heart. Joy winks at the moon in Australia We swell with delight in Australia 1 Life resteth on grog in Australia !
