THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOLDFIELDS. (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) No. I. The clouds of depression rarely rest long upon any of the Australasian group A breeze of promise from some unexpected quarter rises to lift the pall of a growing despair and renew the growth of temporarily intercepted prosperity In this instance light shown from the west from that Cinderella, chanted an old time song as the " Land of the Black Swan," the "terra incognita" of drifting leagues of sand, sombre forests of jarrah, and reward claims of fabulous richness The motor of a rush has been set in action, and from Cape York to the chilly beaches of Hokitika all sorts and conditions of men are bound to the new El Dorado And the rush, commencing from a common centre, like a pebble cast into a millpond, will yet extend its circling influence to remoter parts The Western Australian Government, as a cogent if not altogether wine advertisement, have purchased a large mass of the produce from Bayley's Reward claim, and have sent it to England for exhibition Already, despite ominous warnings, some hundreds of emigrants weekly leave the ports of the United Kingdom for the too crowded avenues of Vi itz waters land and the Mashona, where they have but a meagre chance of successful competition with predecessors and coloured rivals A much less time than a few thousand ounces of gold will divert to a large extent this stream from Africa to Australia, and give such an impetus to the Western colony as gold alone can. In the meanwhile many, thrown out of harness by the depression of the day, seize time by the forelock and flock to the scene Though a rush, in its main feature of attracting a crowd from all points of the compass to a common centre, has a close family resemblance to its fellow-rush, the rush of to-day widely varies in its component parts from the rushes of 40 years ago Then youth, energy, ability of brain or muscle, or both, of all countries and degrees, embarked heed. lessly upon a career and in a country of which they had no poor conception, and dug and delved in the most primitive manner with the rudest of appliances until the test or bitter experience had sorted those few for the toil of gold-digging from those whose bodily or mental equipment pointed out sure if less exciting methods of wooing fortune Now, all is different Every colony of the group has its array of miners with its attendant fringe, sometimes too heavy of mining speculators Some 400 of this admixture, with an additional 20 or 30 brave spirits of the fairer sex, are now crowding the ship from which I write as she seems sullenly to roll over the broad sea, and by the shining sand dunes of the coast, bound for Fremantle Of them individually little need be said. They are quiet and grave, of all ages and experiences, showing little excitement, though it is fair to suppose they feel it, and taking the whole thing as if it were a look into the columns of their morning paper to see if anything offered that might suit them. And yet there are a few mining Ulysses who have stuck pegs on every Victorian, New South Wales, or Queensland gold- field from the fifties downwards, not a few familiar with every evolution of change, learned in soap, and up to every move of the market And there are others who can retail legends by the hour of the Moonlight, Melville's, Black Douglasses, Kellys, Gardeners, Le , of the past, and among the younger reciters it is strange to note how the glamour of romance has hidden from their eye the real brutality and baseness of these men's lives. Yes, if it were not too familiar talk in these colonies, quite an "old podrida of digging, bushranging, and novel experiences could be gathered on the deck sufficient to outvie the most startling experience of the most imaginative literary beach- comber of the sensuous Pacific Isles But the en- grossing subject of com orsation is neither Coolgardie nor the difficulty of getting a morning bath, neither the records of the past nor the hopes of the future, but the prospect of a large addition to the passenger list at Port Augusta, where, much to our surprise, the Waroonga is announced to call. The propriety of appeal to the cantata is discussed But wise spirits know the captain to be helpless Times have not recently been so rosy for shipowners that they can afford to lose a lock of the hay so opportunely ready for harvest, and even now the knocking up of a row of runs stalls along the upper deck has occupied the attention of the ship's carpenters So for as I remember, the camel originally made its Australian debut in the shape of two specimens attached to some Victorian place of outdoor entertainment Then six and thirty were imported into the same colony for the Burke and Wills expedition and unconsciously led to its disasters But the camel, except for this special purpose, did not take root in 'Sir John Robertson's cabbage garden It remained for South Australia to utilise it on a large scale Attached to the relief expedition sent by the South Australian Government in search of Burke were four camels which had drifted from Burke s for and found themselves was dering on the northern boundary of South Australia as constituted prior to the addition of its now Northern Territory These four carrots were secured as valuable flotsam and attached to the M'Kinlay expedition The then Governor of South Australia came down and had a ride, destroying his hat by involuntarily bashing it on his head, as Mazeraui the camel, so honoured indulged in particularly high trotting action. But in addition to the curious vi police who crowded down to see the ships of the desert was the now fair Thomas Elder, who with his usual acuteness, saw something beyond a modified wild beasts' show He then an influential man, accompanied the expedition for a considerable distance I think to Lake Hope and was so pleased v the adaptability of the animal to the soft, sandy, poorly watered wastes of the country that he commenced importing and has continued breeding to the present day The camel with its swift noiseless foot tall, steams along like an eerie ghost in the abodes of evening, with its power of burden and endurance on a scanty allowance of water, its preference for the salsolaceous and acacias shrubs of the Interior is matter in the right place and replaces by an efficient agent of communicant on the cumbrous unreliable bullock-dray and horse team It has conquered much of South Australia it has invaded and shows its fitness for Western Queensland and it is so evidently adapted to traverse the long heavy and sands of Western Aus- tralia that only a shortsighted and selfish man would object to the discomfort of its presence on board ship for a few days, knowing as he may know if so disposed, that a well-conducted camel service minimises the danger and discomforts of pioneer life in a region but recently elevated above its salt- water level lot. it must be admitted the camel is an area inly, treacherous brute failed with burning complainings when put to work disfigured with unseemly callosities, gifted with strange powers of distorting its limbs, and at times positively dangerous Then it has a minor disagreeable if poor in condition which it is devoutly to be hoped our coming ii lends are not it is apt to be afflicted with a contagious complaint, intensified in proportion to its size Gloomy looks resent an unsuccessful opposition to their embarkation just made to the captain That courteous official as I premised regretted he had no option His duty was to obey orders His orders were to ship 100 camels at Port Augusta, and unlike Jessie at Lucknow, all we can do is to regret that the came to are coming" with the Af games in waiting upon them and their gruesome attendant memories of the Khyber Pass and Jellalabad PORT AUGUSTA, FEBRUARY 12 Last evening the Waroonga steamed between the yellow shores of the inlet leading to this port and this morning about Sam brought up alongside the wharf where huge stacks of bagged wheat he in process of shipment The sales for the camels are run up, and some of the passengers await their arrival with a dread bom mainly of ignorance The latest canard is that the Afghan drivers decline to let their charges walk into the hold down the battened planks prepared for them and that they insist upon these desert barques being slung in stays aboard Meanwhile the hundred beasts have filed in long strings upon the borders of the wharf and repose in their ungainly position upon the ground They seem a clean wholesome mob in good condition carefully branded chewing the cud or growling in that tone of piteous protestation so characteristic of the brute Their attendant Afghans look a picturesque set of bandits with their baggy breeches, heavy turbans, and martial moustaches Among the " brig, ' or pack camels, with their coarse horsehair saddles are one or two of higher breed, bearing the same relation to the burden earners as the thoroughbred horse to the Clydesdale They carry the riding saddle a gaily ornamented equipage studded with brass and high peaked in trout. I am glad to see them, though not enamoured of their presence as shipmates They mean locomo- tion and carnage under the most distressing conditions of drought, and it may yet prove the fate of more than one who now cavils at their presence to welcome their gaunt outlines on the horizon of the thirsty land as the welcome agents of his release from the most horrible of deaths Tons of sand are being strewn between decks and on the planks of the upper deck as absorptive bedding The process of embarkation commences, and is conducted in this wise The saddles are removed and stacked the camel lies bare of every accoutrement except the nose string by which he is led This nose string is attached to a peg of wood inserted in the cartilage of the nostril, and forms, in addition to voluble objurgation, the controlling agency the helm, BO to speak of the desert ship Those Afghans are steady fellows Two of them mount on the top of two railway trucks laden with hay, and fling down some bales, a third beneath arches his back, upon which the others lift a ball with which he trots absolutely trots, to the receptive hatchway borne loose straw forms a soft carpet under the slings, and amid uncouth distortions and diabolical groans, and futile resistance Mr or Mrs Camel finds itself slung intense us and eweärtwiMJy Iwewd to the show. The first camel lowered was one of huge dimensions, Bird presented a camels an initial pons carnell He stood from the sole of his feet to the summit of his hump, from 3ft to 3ft 6in The lower lip of the main hatch was not more than 6ft from the main deck floor How to make an 8ft 6in camel enter that inferno, the main deck, through a Get. portal, standing, the problem could not be solved The camel would not bend or bow to circumstances but Jack, mercantile or naval, is not proper to put up with defeat, so the poor beast was made to he down, had R canvas or rope breeching placed round his hind quarters and was logged by main force into his destined berth After that the shipment went merrily on the camels got smaller or the hatch higher, or the men more adroit volunteers were in plenty and, Afghans, sailors, and servants working with a heart, the whole fleet were aboard and snuggled down in less than four hours A good deal of the grumbling incidental to this shipment vanished before the ludicrous details of the embarkation Many had never seen a camel before most had but a hazy idea of the creature and it was an object lesson of a very practical character to view leisurely these Asiatic en- largements of the South American lame, with their patient, deceptive appearance, kick like a cow, buck like a well-bred outlaw, and growls like a foreman printer at a loss for copy Practically, we are ready to start, but we have outlived the tide, and a ship of our draught can- not ran the circuitous narrow channel of this shallow sea-air without its assistance Thou when weighed and clear from the ii hart a search has to be made for stowaways, for having had to refuse 30 passengers here, it is highly probable some may seek an unauthorised passage Our next port is Albany, which will afford those who desire it an opportunity to escape the Leuwin, and to run by rail to Perth direct The great question of embark- ing the camels having born fruitlessly protested against the piling of the deck with forage is now exciting animadversion Camels must be fed, so forage must be carried and as forage is naturally carried for the horses and other stock shipped to other rushes, and the danger consequent upon the presence of careless smokers and errant sparks of fire incurred, I do not see how it is to be avoided in this instance Those who go to gold digging must be prepared to face the many rislfB attached If they would travel with a minimum of risk, channels offer to those willing to pay the increased cost. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
