Yesterday. Yesterday is dead And lies at rest. No breathing stirs The white rob'd breast ; The groans and sobbing Are hush'd at last, Thanks be to Heaven ! . Such pains are paBt. Seek not to rouse Its unquiet ghost ; Conjure no phantom Of what is lost ; Come away softly 5 And make no moan. Leaving thy perish d hope Dead and alone.
