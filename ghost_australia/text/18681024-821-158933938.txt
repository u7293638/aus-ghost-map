When the knell of the bell tolls its sorrowful sound I am silent as death, but I sing if it ring; In tlie summer ami autumn I never am found, But appear every year in tlie winter and spring; Near the middle of night T am seen all in white, Yet I never appear in the day; I reside on each island, Though nouc upon dry land Have ever yet known ine to stay ; Yon may find ine in silver and tin, But in neither lead, copper, nor gold ; I exist in good vinegar, whisky, and gin, In the spirits and wines that are kept at the inu, But in none of the trash that is sold. 163\.

Reaumar's, with the freezing point at zero and the boiling point=.8<j~ ; 3. Celsius's, or the centigrade, with the freezing point at zero and the boiling point=10:)% Supposing then that at sunrise Fahrenheit's stands at+lS V, that Reaumar's rises 13J" by noon, and that from noon to sundown the centigrade falls 6% what temperature does each indicate at sunrise, noon, and sunset?— Timon. 172\. A gentleman residing in the country, distant in a westerly direction one mile from the base of a ridge of hills, rising from the plain at an angle of 30% found by repeated observation tliat bis waleli indicated cnriect time by the Adelaide gun, but that it was 10 minutes forward by the tim -table when the sun first made its appearance in the morning above the bills. What is the length of the assent from the foot of the ridge to the sum mit, what is the perpendicular height of the summit above the level of the plain, and what length of tunnel will be required to pierce the ridge from the base and to come out at the surface at an equal horizontal dis tance on the other side of the ridge.-—Framts Duffi ki.t>. Mem.-—It may be necessary to state that in this ingenious problem Mr. Duf field assumes that the sun's apparent motion at rising is at right angles with the horizon, and that no corrections are necessary for refrac tion, horizontal paralla, or the equation of time. 173\. The mariner and his wife—Problem 111 in continuation of No. 154. The mariner sails fur a given port at 9 a.m. (as before), onaN.W. course, at the rate of eight knots per hour, till 2 p.m. He then changes his course 8. by E. and sails until the port bears N.E. by N.

Multiplication op Roman Numeral?. Your correspondents seem to me to ha\e gene too far afield in discussing the questir n - of multiplicationwith Roman numerals, pari ly (I think) because they have disregarded the fact that complex signs in the Roman numerals often express- one simple idea. Tims XXX does not stand for three separate tens,-:, hut for thirty, just as the complex sign-10i stands for ten with us. Bearing in mind that less than three centuries back Roman numerals were still used in England for the common processes- of bookkeeping, 1 think the modes of working would bear greater- analogy to modern methods than thcee-suggested. I should propose to state the- process of multiplying, XXVII by XIX thus,, following with one important difference tkfcphin> of " Anaxagoras^"'— XX VII x IX 3: times 7 = 63 = l x 9-tinses 20=180= vr- l xxx 10 times 7 = 70 = l xx ltMAmes20=200= jc r« x ni The- last two lines would more probably be merged in one, and. ten times 1"l he at; ones written down CCTiXX.
