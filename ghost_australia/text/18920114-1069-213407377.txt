" Supernatural" warnings are some times on trivial subjects ; sometimes, while serious and oven tragic, they seem powerless to avert the danger against which they wnrn. Mr. Stead quotes a storv from the accumulations of tho S.P.R., which " is full of the tragic fas cination which attaches to the struggle of a brave man, repeatedly warned of his coming death, struggling in vain to avert the event which was to prove. fatal, and ultimately perishing within the sight of those to whom ho had l-ovealed tho vision."
