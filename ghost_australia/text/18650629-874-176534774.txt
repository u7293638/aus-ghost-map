Our Public Buildings. ME. EDWARD COIIEN, in the course of tlie debate about the bad foundations of the Kew Lunatic Asylum, said lie was of opinion that " the public buildings of the colony were a credit to it." It is not stated if he illustrated his proposition by quoting examples : but if he bad, he would probably have mentioned St. Francis' Cathedral, St. Patrick's Hall, St. James's Cathedral, the Supreme Court, the Insolvent Court, the Model Schools, the Eastern-hill Water Tank, the Western Market, the Hall of the Royal Society, the Hobson's Bay and the Melbourne Railway Stations, and other exquisite specimens of pure architecture, whose varied beauty distances anything that Athens, Rome, Venice, Milan, Florence, Paris, or London have produced. We can imagine the ghosts of PYTHIUS, VITRUVIUS, MICHAEL ANGELO, Sir CHRISTOPHER WHEN, and Sir CHARLES BARRY gliding through the streets of Melbourne, lost in admiration at the glorious examples that meet their disembodied eyes on every side; and feeling, if ghosts can feel, that it remained for the architects of the great South Land to develop to their utmost extent all the capabilities of the art they so imperfectly practised when in the flesh. Happy COHEN ! To live in an age and in a colony in which the true aesthetics of architecture are so perfectly exemplified.
