TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1883. Tho ciicumstanco that tho Assombly is to bo asked this evening to voto £3,000 to tho gentlemen who have " workod"the Woods bl uko is ovidenco in itself that our lailway sjstcm is still under political management Tho right course, clearly, m tho public interests, is to lca\e tho vexed issue of tho brakes to the now railway board Tho chairman will beaman of experience, whoshould be ablo to grasp tho situation at onee, and Als decision might as readily be aecepted as final as was that of fen JOHN COOM with regard to tho rival piojeets of tho Yarra improvements and tho direct cut With gicat aeumon, howover, Mr WOODS and Ins friends appear to recogniso that it is now or never Considcung that Mi WOODS aud his paitneis have not employed an at tuan noi invested a penny, and that tho apparatus has been expeumented upon, altered, and " devolopcd " at the cost of tho stato, it seems as if tho company ought to pay tho colony something for tho free uso of its workshops Suth pnvileges must be worth a good round bum Instead, the member foi Stawell is to lecoivo a bonus of £3,000 as a commence ment The diamond dull has dono much for tho mining mdustiy, and tho reaper and bindci lias accomplished much for the fanner Wo think neithci botter nor worse of these inventions because they aro of American ougin Our people aie entitled to tho best, wherever it comes from , and so with brakes On the îoilways not only the publie pío porty is at stake, but men's h\ cs also, and consequently the uso of tho best pos siblc apparatus should bo insisted upon 'lo tako an artiele seilously faulty and infenor beeauso some local individual has put it togethei,and to reject another ai líelo winch cannot bo mado hore because it is patented abroad, is as foolish as it would bo to fact asido the numeials because they aro of Arabic descent The only question foi us to consider, if wo aio honest, is whethei theio is a maiked disparity m the two brakes now in uso on tho Vie torian lines, and the reason wo have uiged that tins issue should bo remitted to an impartial and capablo judge is the diiheulty the public have m getting at tho ti uth 'Irickcry is met with at every tuin The public may bo io minded of two incidents which uro sufhcient of themselves to tluow doubt on the bona jida, of tho Woods biako business Its promotcis speak of tho vol diet of tho Thow boaid, and tho testimony of tho Piahran meeting In eithci caso was tho do cisión fairly obtained ?
