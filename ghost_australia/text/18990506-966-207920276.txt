V, "Why, what do you think?' "1 daren't tell you, yer honour, for fear I'll make another mistake. I thowt, sur, donC wj mJiiituuuj | yer honour—it't. «he waccination. In the Proverbs of Job we read, "fool and ;his money soon parted,* and so we can see ow true the teac-hin' is to-day." "But wlwt is to be done, Simon?" Simon shook his head, and then eaid solemnly, "I'm away front my beam's, sur. I thought when I wur done the last time it fchould be tlie last time. It wur in this way, *ur. 1 was in the doctor'is 6ervice as wacciuated me. Says he, when he'd done, tSiinoii, you'll never have smallpox now/ Think not?' say» 1. 'Never,' says he; and when .Susan the 'ousemaid heard, on it, she nnyn, l am ko glad tsimoii.' Theji,' says l, 'Misiin, when i»ople are married they're eouveiied into one flesh. That's Scripter.

So I Bays, 'Say ye* at once, Susan. The doctor says I can't get it, mt there's no soil o' fear.* I wur young and simple then, and thowt doctors uover made a mistake. Well, tur, in two inonths more I were down wi' smallpox, and when I got up again I wur a sight to behold.

And 1 Kays to niy*elt, 'Simon Slowden,' 1 M»y», *thi« yer its the last time you must ever ht taken in;' and now I'm right mad that 1 should a' bin licked in this yer way." 1 could not help laughing at Simon's »lory, in spite of my heavy heart, and so I *»ked liim what the doctor said when he found vaccination a failure. "Sent me off without a character, Mir, he replied grimly. "Said he coujdn't.keep kervaut as would be a livin' advertisement »B *ou~ his pet 'obby wer a failure. And BO 1 allays wiys as 'ow waeeination is uiy ruiu. ItV ruined my blood and weakened my brain. Still," continued Simon, with a *ly*look. "I reckon an 'ow I'll be a match for that 'ere doubly waccinated ghost as frightened me eo." I could get nothing more front him. He had formed tome nation about the apparition which he would not divulge, so we de voted our attention to sport, and, after frightening a good wauy rabbits, we returned to tbe hall. Vbthing of importance happened through the day, except an enquiry which Tom made among; the servants. Each declared that they were entirely ignorant as to the apj»earanee of the ghost, and all were evidently too frightened to doubt the truth of their •tatemen'.. Thus when evening came nothing was known of it. Kaffar did not speak to roe from the time I had seen him in the morning to dinnertime. and evidently avoided me. Voltaire, on the contrary, was unusually bland and smiling, lie was pleasant and agreeable to every one, especially so to me. After dinner we all found our way to the drawing-room, when the usual singing, flirting, and dancing programme was carried out. Suddenly, however, there was compa rative silence. One voice only was heard, and that was the Egyptian's. "Yes." he was saying, "I am what is railed a superstitious man. I believe in dresms, visions, and returned spirits of the dead. But, ah! I do not believe in made- up ghoatc. Oh, you coldblooded English w people, dor/t mistake the impulsive Egyptian; don't accuse him of lack of faith in sSft the unseen. So mueh do I believe in it, that sometimes I long to be with those who have gone. But, bah! the ghost last night wife to deceive, to frighten. Cot up" by s *ome villain for a purpose, and I can guess who he is." n "Tilis it serious," said Tom Temple. "I p have enquired of the servants, wlu all as- »ure me of their ignorance oj the matter, M and I cannot think that any of my guests would assume the j>eri«m of the traditional n ghost- for no other purpose than to frighteu the housekeeper and two or three servants. I'm by no means superstitious, but I do not J see how I can trace it to human origin."' '1 cannot see v^by any <»uest should assume the person of the traditional ghost, hut some men have deep designing minds. They argf like clever draughtplayers; they fee half-a-dozen moves ahead., and so do that wliirh to a novice appears meaningless and absurd." Then J heard another voice, one that caused my heart to heat wildly. It was Oertrude Forres's. "Mr. Kaffar says he can gues* who the person is who has personated, j-his ghost," she said: "I think it fair , to every guest that he should speak out." • "I would not like to say," be said insultingly; "perchance I should wound your tender feelings too deeply." "Mr. Kaffar will remenjber he's speaking to a lady, I'm sure," said Torn Temple. "Pardon me," said Kaffar, excitedly; "I foreot I was in England, where men are the slaves of tlw ladies. With us it is different. We iiiteak, and they obey. I forgot I was not in Egypt. I have done very wrong. 1 implore the lady's pardon." "I see no meaning in your words," said MiKK Forrest, quietly, "therefore I see finihiiu nothing to foreive." forgive.' • "Ah. I live again. A heavy load is gone from my htari. 1 have not merited the t lady's displeasure." » "Ktill, I think i<« right, if you have grounds for suspecting anv one. that we should know." said a voice, "otherwise some ttue mav he wrongly accused." 'T*onot ask me," said Kaffar. "Ask Mr. j B'«ke." Instantly all eyes were turned on me, i.ind. do as I might, 1 could not help an uneoiiifortable flush rising in my face. "I do not know what Mr. Kaffar means," I replied. "I am as ignorant as to the origin <>f ihc ghost as he. perhaps more so." Jnetmttly Kaffar leapt from his chair and eame up to me. his hnnds clenched, his blaik e.vo ^learning, his teeth set together us if in ;i tci-ii'.ic rage, "You are a liar and a villain!" he scream- '•d. "Ah, remember this muming.

"t^iiieiiy, |ile;if=e." 1 replied. "You did come to mi- this mnriiitig with some foolish jargon about mv being conneetfii with hist night's affair; but 1 «as so surprised by the absurdity .md !"<.ol'.-!ui<'i>s of such a thing that I could not answer you before you mn "Ynu bear?" shrieked the Ep-ptian.

"Yes; and you are a liar, a coward, a villain! You are engaged in a fiendish plot: .you are deceiving an innocent lady. Ah, I spurn, you, spit upon vou."' "-Mr. KafFar," said Tom Temple, '"really this cannot be allowed. Yon must remember you are anion?- ladies and gentlemen. I'loase act accordingly."' •'Ladies there are. fronlleinen 1 here are." shrieked the Egyptiau; "but he"—pointing to im?—"is no, gentleman. H«i is at once a viper, a villain, and a coward.

'•There'." he cried, and hen he struck me in the face with -all his strength. Instantly I leapt to my feet. This insult WJS too 1 could scarcely restrain roni striking bim fo the ground. I masered myself, however, and so did not touch him. ^ "I leave this hou.se," he said wildly. '•'Herod, send on my baggage to Cairo. Bi.:i"—iurning to me—*\vou I challenge— you, with your big body and trained arms! But, bah! yon dai Vt light. You are a mooning cn\var.l." : He lushed out of the room as he spoke, and a minv.ie later 1 heard the liall door jammed with vehemence. At that moment 1 becamc possessed of a terrible passion. I seemed to be mad. I longed to avenge the insults that had been offered. 1 lookejj around the room, and all seemed astounded at the behaviour of the •'gy-priaii, save Voltaire, who ivas apologizin profuse terms for his friend, a! I looked at his terrible eyes, my passion became greater, and I feJt I could not govern myself if I stayed in the room. I think some one caijie up io me, and congratulated me on my coolness in dealing with the inan who had insulted me so'; but I "did not listen—J could not. An overmastering impulse laid hold of me to follow the Egypian, aiid I dimly remember going into the hall and out into the silent night. 1 knew the probability was that I shouldbe followed, but I did not know where to go, when I seemed to hear vojc- es all around me uttering the words "Drearwater Pond!" With that I started running with all my might, knowing not where, yet dimly remembering that I bad gone "the road before. Then all memory and consciousness ceased.
