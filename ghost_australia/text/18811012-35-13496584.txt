The Bishop of BALLARAT would accept Mr Suttor's amendment, but he did not like the idea of that bell (Hear, hear j The Bishop of NEWCASTLE seconded the amendment thinking that the two gentlemen proposed by the Bishop of Ballarat would have a most invidious task in their "devours to stop discussion Mr J W Koaiius (Ballarat) objected to having any limitation of discussion in the matters brought before them Air A GonnoN thought it would be advisable to loop to their own practice as op posed to the in church con- gresses in England, as when on a visit there he had found that in those congi cases much less business was, got through than in the Australian synods Sir Giiouor INNES thought there was no necessity for such a proposal, and regretted that the right reverend prelate should again have brought it before them Such restrictions he believed to be unworthy of a deliberative assembly such as that, and as he had voted ii_,utnst it ino years ago, he would vote against it a gun Rev COLIN CAMniFi i vi is in favour of the principle aimed at by the Bishop of B illili it, but thought the suggestion for having a bell was a wise one, and he would support it Rev (J T GAIINSEA thought it would be a dark period in the history of the synod if such a resolution as this were agreed to, and had hoped it would have received similar treatment to that which it had received before the powers of such a body as that might be limited now, but those Hingt grew as time went on and if they limited the free dom of speech they would take use by one of the greatest privileges which they now possessed.

said this synod was not started on my fraternity of love, but upon the legal position that the Bishop of Sydney was Metropolitan of the dioceses of Australia that members could act within their legal position as members of the Church of England, and could, without interfering with the lasts the Church of England, meet under mutual arrangement The resolution was negatived on division by GO to 2 the unions being Rev Canon Ewing and Mr C Campbell INUOUMITi 01 VI Sill I IG! HEGOL Sa TONS Ros canon RINO closed,-' this Synod resolves that in order to secure, as far as possible, uniformity in regulations affecting marriage within the province it is less able that no ecclosiuslieU restrictions be imposed on the celebration of marriages between in members of the Church of England in addition to the oenfotccdbj the marri ure loss 8 of the various colonies " He said that the resolution ss is in perfect accordance with the spirit which seemed to emanate from this BJ nod that time all should be closely united, and that their customs should be common to all and it seemed inconsistent with this state of things that in one diocese, separate I by an imaginary line from another, there should be regulations affecting the marriages of members of the Church of England absolutely disease in the diocese of Grafton and Armidale there was demanded simply a coniphunt.0 with the loss of the colony the Legislature took precautions which seemed sufficient to secure that no improper marriages should take place, and the regulations of the diocese required simply that the law should be respected But the practice was very different among the various dioceses in the colony, and he thought it would conduce to the unity and common action of all who were members of the Church of England in the dioceses of Australia and Insin mia if this resolution were passed Rev Canon SliLvs AN seconded the resolution so that the subject in 0 lit be discussed, hut he should like to bus o seen the resolution amended, so that it should be stated it was desirable that no each institute restrictions other than those absolutely necessary should be imposed I his question was one that should be settled in the interests of the church at large He thought the synod should express s uno opinion upon the question, and consequently seconded the resolution Archdeacon Carter) opposed the resolution, and moved as an amendment, that a select committee be appointed to prepare regulations in such form as may seem most expedient to it, and to submit them to this synod for consideration at this session having due regard to the following principles -1 that every an image shall be celebrated either after public tion of banns or utter license granted for the dispensation from the publication of banns 2 that every marriage should be celebrated in a church, except after the permission of the bishop first had been given and taken i No clci"-vinaii shall be bound to solemnize matrimony between persons either of whom he knows to have been disoiLcd or to be within the degree- expressed in the table set forth by authority in the year lGOo Mr Sm r uri D SMITH opposed the motion on the ground that it tended to degrade m firing from a religious to a civil cont act, and said that he thought no cause had been shown why it should be passed He was ashamed that such a proposition should be made in a synod of the Church of England, and that they should be asked to surrender their right of legislating on the subject to the Parliament of the country. He had great faith in the wisdom of the Bench of Bishops upon a a lesion of this kind and would accordingly move an amendment, requesting the Bench of Bishops to arrive at a determination on the subject for the guidance of the clergy Mr J ROBERTSON said this was no loss matter, for in the diocese of Sydney there were certain regulations in force on the subject, but t certain clergymen, amongst whom was Canon King, held that these regulations were ultra I am no thought therefore, he was the last one to bring forward the question in its present shape Archdeacon L issues opposed the resolution, as he did not think it would lead to any practical good Archdeacon TANK had been requested by the D shop of Adelaide to express his views on the matter If the resolution were agreed to, it would simply amount to this, that in South Australia i they should loss of out of sight the law of the play or book, and, by taking the law of the land as their guide, marry persons to their deceased wives'' sisters It did not matter to him which amendment was carried , but as the subject required that some regulations should be drawn up, he hoped one or other of the amendments would be agreed to Rev Canon H V MiriEL said it was most important for the clergyman to make up their minds as to which practice should be adhered to the difference bets ren the church's idea of marriage and the idea of the State was, that the one proceeded from a spiritual point of view, and the of the i from its secular side, but it should borne in mind that the clergy got their authority from the church from which they received their organization and license He would very much like to see the question, regarding canonical banns, are., referred, if lessee new scenery, to the Bench of Bishops, but if this resolution meant only st lift the mover had said, it -was a disingenuous one, because it touched a very important matter not yet alluded to-it would trench upon the resolution of the Bishop of Perth Certainly they ought not to carry a resolution of this kind, and change the prac- tice for customs of the church in this way The Bishop of PFUTII said his diocese was one in which the evasion of marriage with a deceased wife's sister had been raised, and after a very long debate that question had been referred to the general synod. Although he had a motion on the subject upon the business paper he would be very glad to accept the amendment in either form proposed to this resolution He had never had any doubt in his mind of maintaining in his diocese the sacred character of their loss s, but at the same time it was most important to the well-being of the church in this colony that they should be bound by the common law of the church He would has a much pleasure in accepting either of the amen directs the Dun of MimouiiNfc said the resolution proposed avory harmless thing, but the same time it involved questions of enormous moment, and one of those was who that the Chin eli was to submit to the loss of the colony and do nothing with regard to laws for itself He complained of the question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister being joined with the question contained in the resolution Rev C C. Gr FIN WAY said that he would vote for the amendment proposed by Canon Child Mr T W Robins said that the resolution simply pro posed that the church should give up one of its highest functions, flint or say ing as hat was and what was not incest, and they were asked to say that they would allow si hat the State authorized, and if the State authorized polygamy that they should be asked to gas of the sanction of the Church to it also If they were to carry such a resolution they would be in effect cutting themselves off from the Church of England, which had declared certain marriages legalised by the Parliaments of these countries to be incestuous lheRiRhoDof NEWCASTLE said the motion appeard to him to be the abolition of the whole marriage service. He would prefer Archdeacon Child's amendments rather than that of Mr Shepherd Smith, inasmuch as the question was already at issue in some of the dioceses, and hence it would be mainly able to leave the matter solely in the li india of the Bench of Bl has Rs C F G su six he had the mr lion on the ground that it might clash with the refill unions which sseiocnlorccd in some of the dresses, and would like to refer the matter to the Bench of Bishops, as there would then be a greater likelihood of securing uniformity throughout the whole of Australia Archdeacon Curtis withdrew from his amendment the subsection 2 Mr A BHCI mar the 10th the matter was one event lily for the RIOT S and one that had nothing to do with the but j (Hear, hear ) Archdeacon DAV i M thaT said the intend in of chorister turn out very good but its st up sh is ed the utter mir u ability of any eccles eshcol body adopting such a resolution, which would simply mean surrendering themselves to the various legislatures of the colony. At the same time, the whole fiction of the marriage law was one that might be referred to a select committee Rev H E Coot-Eli supported the proposal for the appointment of a select cor matter in preference to the question being referred to the Bench of Bishops Mr SIILIIIPRP SMITH said he would withdraw his amendment if the question were referred to the committee the amendment moved by Mr. Shepherd Smith was withdrawn Some discussion then took place in regard to the suitable wording of the resolution as it was desired by the need to amend it and Archdeacon Childeconsontmg to withdraw a portion of his amendment, the resolution was agreed to in the following form -" That a select committee be appointed to prepare regulations affecting marriage within the dioceses of Australia and Tasmania, in such form as may seem most expedient to it and submit them to this synods for consideration during this session " The folio sang gentlemen were then appointed as the select committee Bishops of Perth, Ballarat, and North Queensland Archdeacon Farr Canon Druitt, Rose C C Greenway, Canon Handfield, Roy C Curwen Campbell, Archdeacon Child, Messrs A Gordon, Adams, Rogers, and A'Beckett the synod adjourned at a quarter past 11 o'clock until half-past 3 o'clock next day Wednesday) The name of the Rev. J T Doctor was inadvertently omitted from the names of those members of the Synod re- puted as being present at the meeting of the synod on Monday
