poetry Aunt Martha's Spinnliig-Whcel- Witb splaer-webbing tattered ' ? In travesties of laoo, 'Mid treasures years bavo Bbattered— Onca miraoleB of grace— Imploring Time to spare it, With rusty tongue of steel, Behold it in the garret- Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. .. With slow and pensive fingers, I wipe the webs away, While loving Fancy lingora To palnt,an olden day. ?..??.,. When yontb and beauty crowned it What gay songs.U?-d to peal I Now criokets wail around it— Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. I softly, touch the treadle; >' It gives a plaintive squeak; It begs mc not to meddle, In murmurs sad and meek. Alas I the feet that litholy— Onoe twinkled through, the reel, No more shall pat it blithely— Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. How oft its noisy turning : Hath served a lover's need, And kept Ago from discerning What only Youth should heed I 'Iwould drown both vows and kisses That lovers love to steal j A dear old treasure this is— Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. For fear of house adorner In search of bric-a-brac, Far in the garret corner With sighs I put it back; And there, just as I found it, I leave for woe or weal With ghosts to glide around it, Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel.'
