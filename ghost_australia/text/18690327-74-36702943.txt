A meeting of the local Board of Works was held in the Court [louse, Wynyard, on Saturday, the 18th lostant, with all the members present, when it was deqided to:push on the work at the loglie Breakwater, clear away certain roeeks from the channel of the Cam river, and assist the Emu Bay lRnad Trust In repalrlig the bridge over the Emu River. The worksron the Cam road and the Calder road are progressing, thoughl rather slowly. The draining and forming of a portion .of the main line of road from Wynyard to Circular Head Is progressing under the contract of'Mlr. Winm. Concher, but still there is no appearance of any preparation for the building of the new bridge over the Inglis, and thise road cannot be used without the bridge.
