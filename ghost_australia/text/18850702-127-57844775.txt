A SCOTCO H JOKE. \----o- One evening, in the principal goldmining camp in the Transvaa!, nine or ten years ago, a man, partially intoxicated and supposed to be actuated by jealousy, attempted suicide. Hoe first took morphia; but this not provingI strong enough, he tried to hang himself, but was prevented, and handed over to the sheriff, to be kept in custody for the night, and to be tried before the Acting Gold Com missioner (a shrewd and solemn Scot) the next morning. As there was no law to have prevented him from committing suicide if he thought fit, but it being desirable to punish him in some way, it was decided to bring a charge of drunkenness and disorderly conduct against him. To this the prisoner pleaded guilty; whereupon the Acting Gold Commissioner, without the ghost of a smile, delivered the following extraordinary judg inent : "Mr - , I shall fine ye twa punds for your drunkenness ; but I'll just gie you to understand that I ken vera weel what ye attempted to dae, and, had ye succeeded in your attempt, your poonishment would have been vera much more severe thal it is ! \- -The Sedfator.
