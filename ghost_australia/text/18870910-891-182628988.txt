In lingerie, , the rerr latest thing* out, is under linen made .af coloured zephyr., Those who have ^ot seen . *a\ of these garments may imagine that they n ould like; the appearance of them. So did I until I saw, them, but an "inspection quite dis pels this idea. Tho'specimens I saw were of pale pmk, and pale blue zephyr-a finer zephyr than that ."generally used for dresses. ' The chemises weco cut in the usual form, but had no m.tront, they were simply t eathered 'M to.. a band round tlio neck, >.hd £er»2ed with'a deep ruffle of fine 6eri valen '«ei«wnes, which was drawn in at the top with a yzbhon: The lmickerbo2ker?V^re also trimmed ».n the same manner. la corsets I saw five or six new shapes, t^rps of which particularly attracted my notfc.v The, " Phantom" corset Is, as its name implies, only the ghost of . a corset, being- made of lace. The casings are made of sateen, and there, are just sufficient of these to prevent the lace from wrinkling - These corsets are delightfully cool, in fact one hardly knows one has got theni on, so' light are they. They would 5*ciit any one of average proportions, \>ut those blessed (or burdened f) with a super abundance of adipose' tissue had better not. adopt them. For the .latter.. Symington's divided husk corset supplies' a ". long felt want.

Their name' is legion,sol can only give a few this week, and those few not in detail. The. " Tanjore " is; a *dras* of crcam muslin, with narrow cardinal stripes" about .1 ' inch apart,.- prettily draped, and trimmed with: 'coffee lace and flot3 of pink and .cardinal1 ribbons.. The csLoringa,".of delaine, in all pale shades, the skirt alone is made, and prettily trimmed with cream lac* frillings. Sufficient miterials for the bodice gnes with it. This costume is more for evening wear. The ..Duchess" cos tume is a quiet and tasteful-looking dress of dark grey zephyrs, combined with a check of black, grey, and white. The drapings of the skirt are caught' up with flote of black and cardinal ribbons. Omitting the cardinal rib bons' this would make a nice half-mourning dress. Generally I. have found , .that it ;is difficult to'obtain much variety in black and white washing, materials, but thi* year the black and Vhite prints, zephyrs,* &c.;, are especially plentiful, cheap, and 4pretty. At,. Grimes and Petty's I saw; a number of very /pretty navy blue washing twills, in: a variety of striped and other- designs, and also gome of the rainbow, striped twills, all of which \- wash well, and are veix serviceable drosses. : The ever-delightful jerseys are kill in high favour, and seem to become more elaborate every day.. The handsomest I have yet seen are at Reid, M'lntyrc, and Clark's. Some are made blouse shape, with a btlfc,r and would be pretty on, thin figures or growing girls. But for anyone with'a fairly -good figure, few styles iire more bocorning than the close-fitting jersey. It shows a good rigure at its best, and a bad one at its worst. Some of the new orJes are very dressy-looking. A brown jersey had ovals of white stoukingette let in down the fronts, and over the^e was a beautiful design in iridiscent beads. One in dove colour had a tight-fittino: back with a basque, full fronts, confined with a half-bl*'t. A very pretty one of navy blue had a white vest,, covered with crossbars of blue braid. "Others were made vith re vers of striped stoslangette. As regards the cut of the new dresses, there is not much novelty. One may wear dresses mads attsr almost any p ttern worn diiring the pn.it ] 2 months, arid still loot quite in tho pre ;'ashi"'n- ^r»rjy of the new washing drossy* are m:ido with jacket bodic.'.J. and dr ipi.*d skirts, but the rodu>goto rhape fv.-sm-s .if nriything,'iA' ho tlio s^?le most favoured. It hf.s Viz du::hle rn'ommendsitio:: of \eing ensy ;mn. snd'c: hehjg bec:omiRg to rao'it figur«M. Thos1.' who like doing'fancy work 'are, I Vnow, always eitger to first in the field j with 'xtiy new. tcind of work, so to Uioa? iu f^arch of a novelty. I should recommend the ".Leek" embroidery^ which is worked iu the new "Elephant 3Ioss" silk*. Why they are ho railed I am unable to say, nor can I see any connection between leeks "and elephants, nor between yither of these aud rmbroidcry. Such, however, is tho name it goes by. The ehnhant inov* silk ts to; take the place of "an?is-;.ntf, anl as;.it is , much stronger and ha rHnrnrr: in a pj>earance .' than tho^ latter, twill,'I"fancy, f.^ou take its placeioi* mo^t purposes.

I had heard of this Oup. -and with a woman's curiosity (and want of ' patience),) I expressed a wish to see it " as it'was. V The cup part was fixed: on a pad in a mould of pitch, intended to hold it firmly- while it was beiug cliased. This process is most interesting to watch. . The design--anr arabesque -in thU inst'ince-is first of all lightly ^traced on the plain, dull silver, and is then,;«) to speak, I chiselled out with-a tiny, mallet and chisel, I much in the samev manners as a sculp tor uses his tools. The pedestal' and 1 stem of the cup -were being made separate, aiid the dome-shaped cover was also in process of making on a third pitch bed. One could scarcely believe that the apparently clumsy looking piece of silver would; soon*, be trans-' formed into' a. thing- of beauty, and I mean to pay a couple more visits to this cup to1 see how it progresses.
