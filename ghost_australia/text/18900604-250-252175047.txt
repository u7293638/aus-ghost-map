CONFIRMATION SERVICE AT ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. St. John's Church was crowded yesterday afternoon, when the usual confirmation service took place. There were about forty confirmees, and the rites of confirmation were administered by the Bishop of Melbourne, the Rev. Field Flowei's Goe. Prior to going through the ceremony the Bishop delivered a short address to the coniiruiees. He selectedjhis text from the third chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the 7th aud 8th verses " Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, today if ye will hear his voice. Harden not your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness." AH members of the choir knew these words well, but they were sometimes liable to forget the meaning of thew. It was « quotation from the Psalms, and probably written by Darid at the direction of the Holy Ghost, but they must attach the same importance to it as if it came direct from the Holy Ghost. This was the reason they should look upon the Bible as different to other books because, although it was written by different persons, it was at the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He pointed out to them that they should always obey their conscience. Some people on being asked, after they had been confirmed, if they felt any different, said they were just the same as before. He was indeed sorry that such persons should take such a solemn vow. He pointed out that they came there publicly to declare their intention to fulfil by- God's grace the vow that had been made at their baptism. He would explain to them the meaning o£ the laying ou of hands. There were t »o reasons both mentioned in the service. The first was because the Apostles always laid .their hand.-' oii the. heads of their converts, and the second beeause it was a pledge of Gold's readiness to give them His holy spirit. Hie Bishop theu went through the ceremony, at the conclusion of which he delivered another address.
