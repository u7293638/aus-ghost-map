8 tUtitH Iwirtj, ? — \j ?—— UNTIL DEATH. Make me no vowg of constancy, dew ftiend— T love me though I die, thy whole life long, And love bo other till thy days shall ei.d, Nay— it were rash and wrong. If thon canb't love another, be it so ! I would aot teach out of my quiet grave To bind tby heart, if it should choose to go. Love shall not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene Iu clearer light than gilds these earthly moms. Above the jealousies and envies keen. Which sow this life with thorns, Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy cares?, 1-, after death, my soul should linger here ; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness. Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wer*t waiting all tby life la woe For my poor sake ; what love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stoDe when I am dead, The praises which remorseful mourners give To woman's grace— s tardy recompense— - But speak them while I live. Heap net the heavy marble on my bead To shut away the sunshine and the dew ; Jjet small Llossoras grew there, and the graissg ware, And rain drops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more my Than T. but trnst me, thou canst never find One who will love aud serve tb.ee, night and day. With a more single mind. Forget me when T die ; the violets Above say rest will bioesoir just as bine, Nor miss thy tears ; even Nature's self forgets ; But while I iii e be true.
