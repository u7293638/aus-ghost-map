. ; ? A CAUPmRE YARN. . ? ; ](Bjf ifyfitt*; K It -was on the Mulligan -(Qoeensl4.ud|, id the early ^ days, .;^h'^p -thjt^yalli blapks were commonly bloodthirsty; tbat jny friend the- drover, witli. whom I waa camping, -happened -to be working on a iarge: station,, ion oae^of the . boundaries, of wihich there lived ii stookmau and his- mate, the .cook., Now, as the tua was about .4D00,Bquare: miles ln.extect, you ' inay. understand; that a hut . on ; the boundary would be in a richer .isolated position, and I cannot think, that .the cook had a merry time of. it, for the stockman was usually away all day (and sometimes for several days »t a time) beating back the cattle, poisoning wild ,4ogs, &p.;' Meantime bis mate did the house-keepipg, nssisted by a couple of gins,, bagged, I fanoy, from a neighbouring tribe during a . native police raid. ? One day, as .old. Bob was clearing up, the stockman jbeing away on the riiu, one of the gins came into tbe but, and intimated that she had something tb say. ; It was from her . that all the details of the tragedy were afterwards gathered, aud one can imagine how she leant against the door-post, as is the manner of gins, smoking a short black ^p^«^s^^k|^g'iuthe)^istca.Bual and only with a %rowj — something ihad put his back, up .that morning— but she continued unmoved, ' Mine think - it blackfellow come up bimebye, be longing to kill you.' ' My. word,' said old Bob, with a glance at the double-barrel that always hung above bis bunk, 'if tbey come here I'll straighten 'em. up in a way that'll astonish 'em.' ' Mine tbink you pull away now,' went on the gin, meaning ' I'd advise you to bolt.' To do her. justice, she seemB to have been loyal to ' Cookie,' and to have done her best to savo hie life. 'But he was a pig beaded and rash old fellow, ' as plucky a beggar as you'd meet, but a God- forsaken fool,' said the drover, describing him to me. So he loaded his gun with buckshot, and awaited the event, calmly pur suing his daily avocations of baking tough damper and boiling uninviting beef; disdaining to send the gin into, the station for help. Still he had another chance. At daybreak next morning tbe gin rushed into the hut. ' You look out Cookie,' she exclaimed, ' mine see 'em all about; blackfellow come np long a swamp.' Bob seized bis gun and followed her out of the hut. It stood, I should have told you. near the top of a bigh sandhill, overlooking a wide plain on one side,', and, on the other a stretch of swamp, covered by tall feathery reeds. From the hilltop Bob could see over the surrounding country. ..Not a breath of wind any where, not a sign of life — everything lay silent in the grey dawn. But the gin crouobing beside him pointed to the reed-beds. While all else was still the reed tops swayed witb a tremulous motion, as though some large' animal beneath were forcing its way through. ' Yoa make ii light 5' .{do you. see she whispered. ' Look here, Cookie, supposin' miue fetch him up yarra man (horse), you pull away quick ?' ' My oath ! ' said poor plucky old Bob, ' if them black thieveB come up long a hut I'll show 'em something !' ' Baal, you pull away ?' she asked once more. *' Baal I' (No !) said Bob, emphatically.' ' All right, mine dear out;' and then she left him. Bob walked back alone to the hut. He could not' beligve I suppose,. 'that the blacks would be game to attack him in broad daylight now they had seen he was prepared. He was wrong. As he reached the door be must, have heard the long drawn, piercing yell that came from the edge . of tbe swamp as with a rattle . of spearc the blacks bounded from their covert and rushed up the slope.. He waited for , them at the .door of tbe hu^ and as be raieed his .gan they shrank back for an instant, : and huddled toggtheri^^So said the ? ginj 'and' iVwaa .' thought'.' ^afterwards'; that be might have been saved oven then had he fired both bairels at once : into' their midst,' At subh clbse quarters buckshot would, have made a terrible hole 'in their ranks. But, witb a mis:' . tak^h idea of not nselessly._' shedding blood, he fired twice over their headsi thinking to overawe them. ' The next ; moment the- whole pack was bn him, : hacking . with. tomahawks, stabbing ? i with spears, smashing him with nul^ lahs. ? : ; Thenibey dragged the gbastly. mis sl)[apen mass that had been old Bob into' tbo but, and waited for the stock -liiat). .

' Though it was never proved -that the Mulligan blacks were cauuibals, not a bush man was there who would have ' put it beyond them.' And indeed no other theory seemed to account for tbe disappear ance of the body. . Nearly all day tbey hunted for some indication which /might lead them to . old Bob's grave, if he had one; but no ... marks were tb -be found of a body having been carried or dragged,- and do earth was disturbed. And tbough there were some there who Oonia traok ft working ballook If tbat lmllock climbed & tree, to quote a local poet, they had to leave without having got the slightest clue. , . 1 Next day they all returned with the black troopers, and the search began again,- Same. result.' Trooper after trooper tried .to pick up {he tracks failed. Even Bungaree, the smart est hand, and, I may . add, the most bloodthirsty iu the whole force, was, stamped; and, ponding furthel,. measures, tbey lit their fire and had' dinner. All this time a little yellow boy, a sort of body servant of 'the officers, bad been creeping about on , all fours with his face close to the : ground, ae though hunting by smell. No one took -auy. notice of - him, though he was a.sinarb' little tracker in his way, till suddenly he rose and and came over to the fire. 'Mine think it white fellow sit down longa there. Mahmi,' he said to the officer. Of course, the whole crew wore up like a shot and over to the place he pointed opt; but when they found merely a bare patch of ground, with a few leaves and dead bushes on it, tbey began -to think Jittle Talpara.bad been ' having the lone of them,' aud were going to ' take it out of his hide,' a, practical form of repartee, much in uso in the back country. But the j boy wasn't to bo put off. 'My word' lie said, ' mine show you quick 1 fellow.' With his kuife he began to , dig. After he'd made a bit of ia hole, ho took a stick and stuck it into tbe ! ground. It went right down showing there was a bole below. Talpara j scraped away with bis hands, then j suddenly thrust ia his arm, avid ' pulled np by the grizzled hair a head,. — streaked with blood, clogged with dirt, battered out of. all shape. Poor] old Bob !, They none of them spoke for a bit, but I guess they ' iooked wolfish. Then' Bob's mate stooped down and cut a lock of hair.
