'? . . ? ; '*??? -The building of a Cathedral Church. Dearly *;:; Beloved, is one of those works of. Christian faith ?:; that are attractive to men of faith, precisely in ?'??'? proportion to their faith, and which move their «.= minds, not so much to calculations of duty as '?: to emotions of generosity; and love. In this *'?' liffht it is. the light of faith, that I now present ''? ' the completion of Sf. Mary s Cathedral to the xl faithful of Christ throughout this Diocese. The f '-? time is eoine for all to put tbeu- hands to a work ? in which all have an interest, towards which 5! : all have a manifest duty, in which is involved the Catholic honour of- this community through out thewoild. The recent consecration of St. ?', Benedict's Church, in Sydney, led 'many to i inquire concerning the delay of the consecration (i ©t St. Mary's, and, as you may have read,, oc'ca '(,i sipn was given to explain that the Church con ,?? secrates by her inost solemn rites only that *v 'w.hicli is complete, perfeut in its kind; that 7 -which is something like the ideal of an offering devoted to, the peculiar and sole service, of t\ Almighty God., The grandeur* too, of the work -» ire undertake in building a Cathedral, was i; given as a natural- and satisfactory reason why OC it. was not to be expected that St. Mary's could i~i be prepared for consecration so. early as a simple i- district church. Further, at a meeting of clergy ; ' and lait\r in this Cathedral itself, it was unani-/ j ijqonsly procl timed, that.it was the dut}' and -?:; glory °f all the faithful of the diocese,, and, in (i some regards, of the whole Australian Province, {? r tq busy themselves in this perfection of .this first ? [[ Australian Cathedral. .?..,.„.-?.'?; ., .: I To begin the discharge of this dn.ty, or rathe'r, to enter upon the enjoyment. of this privilege, ' \, it; was determined that every', yeau, on ,tho ? ..fourth Sunday in Lent, in all our churches and ;, ' chapels, a call should bo made for offerings''' .?:'? ,' towards the eompletion.of the pa thedral— every -... , .year, until the golden cross on the spire should' ?: ?????;: shineout its welcome to the-yet.distant travellers on the ocean, 'and -v. nobly spacious interior1* should be, amply enriched -with the adornments . - of Oiimtian art, and the .syinb.ols of,...Ca1thc-lic faith.

The magnitude, the splen dour, the grace, the' honour, of a Cathe dral shurch, a mother church, are the inheri tance, the tribute, of all ber children throughout the length and breadth of the land. lam not afraid, as some are, lest in presenting a new object 'for your generosity' at this' particular season, of the year I may dry up the channels in which at Easter time you have hitherto ministered so well to more familiar claims. 1 say that they who have such fears do not know the people of whom they speak. Whoever heard that the opening of a new affection dr'ed, up others, and more than all when that new affection was founded on Catholic faith whence all that are lasting spring? Works of Christian faith follow e'ach other as fire enkin dles fire, ths original flume- is in nothing .dimi nished, but rather increased by- each one that . proseeds froni.it; .-, ', ' ?'. ?. , ? And now, Dearly beloved, if you ask me what it is in detail that I would have you do, I answer that I have no plan in detail to offer you. To all, I say in general, take yoxv Clergy for your guides in your several localities. They have beerun, nobly in this.' work to which they are' by pffica '.and .dignity first bound. I do not feai that they will flag in what they have illus trated.by so good a beginning. — It is for you all to emulate, and to surpass them. Give me 3'oui hearts for the work, and the .rest, will sji'rely foliow, A building is to be completed, which shall express to all beholders the store that the men of Australia set upon a due out. ward; expression of their religion.

Lastly, it is the soul-stirring protest of the Catholic faith, the Catholic heart, -against the narrow,-' merchandising selfishness,^ that, thinks only of local need, of local cohv^ii'ierice, of local gratification in all that is dose.' When men, in after times, shall ask who built this Cathedral dedicated to God in honour of ; His Blessed Mother, Help of Cristians, shall, :h: answer be, '? the Catholics of this or that place'? No surely, but this ' the men, the Catholics of the whole diocese, not only they who live within hea ing of its daily Angelus, and the solemn .sacriug bell, when the dread miracle of the ^Vlass is consummated, but every, man, woman, and child, who professed the Catholic faith, even if they lived in the lonely regions of the Colony, and might seldom or never have been in bodily presence within the structure.' All th. t was wanted was opportunity and a Catholic heart. I bring now this opportunity to you, Dearly B-jloved ; use it as you love Him, for whose honour it is intended— and mav He, God fie Father, the Sou, and the Ploly Ghost, bless you, and dwell in your hearts for ever. ??%:;.-'?
