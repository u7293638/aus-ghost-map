THE WOODSIDE GHOST. The sequel to the Woodside ghost story, which was published in The Advert iser recently, was enacted in the local Police Court on Thursday. A charge was laid by the police against A. Eudd oE unlawfully disguising himself with a piece of white cloth, and he was therefore deemed to bo idle and disorderly. Mr. L. von Doussa prosecuted and Mr. E. D. Beresford appeared to defend. The evidence showed that on the night of May G, while Thomas Meddal, who was de scribed as "a shoemaker and poet," was on his way home he noticed a figure in white emerging from the Wesleyan Ceme tery. As it approached him he heard it say, "ThomasMeddal, I claim you." Ho answered, "Take me, then," and struck it with a stick which he carried. The ghost "closed" with him, and in the scufiie the sheet was dis arranged, and Meddal identified Eudd. The result of the ease was that a fine of 10s. was inflicted, with costs, making Â£4 fis. which the ghost had to pay for his nocturnal rambling. On enquiry at the Children's Hospital on Thursday we were informed that the boy Temple, who was accidentally shot at Kniglitsbridgo on Monday, was a little better.
