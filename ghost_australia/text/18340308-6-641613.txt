THE GHOST. A very Serious Ballad. "I'll be your second."--LISTON. In Middle Row some years ago, There lived one Mr. Brown; And many folks considered him, The stoutest man in town. But Brown and stout will both wear out-- One Friday he died hard, And left a widow'd wife to mourn, At twenty pence a yard. Now widow B. in two short months Thought mourning quite a tax; And wish'd like Mr. Wilberforce, To manumit her blacks. With Mr. Street she soon was Sweet; The thing thus came about: She asked him in at home, and then At church he asked her out! Assurance such as this the man In ashes could not stand; So like a Ph≈ìnix he rose up Against the Hand in Hand. One dreary night the angry sprite Appeared before her view; It came a little after one, But she was after two! "Oh Mrs. B., oh Mrs. B.! Are these your sorrow's deeds, Already getting up a flame, To burn your widow's weeds? "Its not so long since I have left For aye the mortal scen ; My Memory--like Rogers's, Should still be bound in green! "Yet if my face you still retrace I almost have a doubt-- I'm like an old Forget-Me-Not, With all the leaves torn out! "To think that on that finger joint, Another pledge should cling; Oh Bess! upon my very soul, It struck like 'Knock and Ring.' "A ton of marble on my breast Can't hinder my return; Your conduct, ma'am, has set my blood A-boiling in my urn! "Remember, oh! remember, how The marriage rite did run-- If ever we one flesh should be 'Tis now--when I have none! "And you, Sir--once a bosom friend-- Of perjured faith convict, As ghostly toe can give no blow, Consider you are kick'd. "A hollow voice is all I have, But this I tell you plain, Marry come up!--you marry Ma'am, And I'll come up again.'' More he had said, but chanticleer The spritely shade did shock With sudden crow, and off he went, Like fowling-piece at cock! \--Hood's Comic Annual.
