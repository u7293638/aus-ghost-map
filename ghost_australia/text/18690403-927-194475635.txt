A HORRIBLE CHEIBTMAS. AS OU- SEBVANT'S BtOfty. It was a horrible .

And this is what it's all come tu 1 Here we are (my poor lady, with hardly a penny U- call her own), buried alive, for Heaven only knows how lung, in a place like this, built, I should say, afore the Deluge, and never been touched up since. But it's uot for such as me to grumble, if she don't, poor soul. As long aa I can stop with her, I dou't much care even if they can't afford to pay me even so much as a half- penny of, my wages. I'll see as how she haven't much to do for her dear self, as long as I am alive and well to do it for her ; for didn't I hold her in my arms when she wasn't more than an hour old, and have never left her yet ? — for wasn't I her nuss as long as Bhe wanted one, and havn't I been her maid ever since ? And now that I'm maid of all works a'niost, I don't so much care, eo that I am with her. It all seemed bright enough when they was first married, and we went scrambling about them forrin* parts, scarcely hearing a word of a decent . tongue 'from week's end to week's end — everybody a' screeching and screaming a lot of outlandish gibberish at you, ^and never, understanding a mortal word you said to 'em. How sick I was of 'em all, and their cooked-up tnesses and their dirt, and tWr fal-lals.- I could never have borne it if it hadn't been for Jones, who I thought was a bit sweet on me all the time ; but that was a mistake, as I found- out afterwards to my cost He was civil enough then, thoiltgh, mind you. However, we came back home at last, and that, house in Grosvenor- Square was a real beauty. My master 'had it done up splendid-like,' to make it ' a fit cage for his bonnie bird,' as I heerdhim whisper, to my lady, with, a bit more sweet things, when ie was ? a'ahowing ier the boudwor, all silver and satin,' and goodness knows what besides. It wasn't so bad, that wasn't ; and certainly master allers did hta best to please her and make her happy, and would as much have thought of saying a cross word to her as a'going and hanging hisself, though I sometimes wonder he don't go and do that now when he thinks of it all But as I stood in that boudwor, with its flowers and its finery, and the master raying Rooh aweet things to my lady, and she looking so joyful and happy like, I didn't feel quite so sorry about my LoniBlendon. I wonder what has become of that boud wor now 1 I suppose it went like the rest of th* house, .and fliat nil my lady's beauti ful things there^ had thoBe ugly bits o' paper pasted on 'em, with Lot 28, Lot 50, as. they were just beginning to stick about nwben I went in the last thing- to see if I cpuld get a few more odds and ends to gether. I firmly believe they'd have taken all my lady's clothes and jewl'ry if I hadn't got 'em away fiafe and sound as soon as, I see how things was going. I don't think even master guessed the pass things .were a coming to, when I Bent off the best part of her boxes to a consin of mine;- as kept some livery stables near the square; but it's a mercy I did. ? Well, as I was saying, thingswere flour ishing enough at first, until that sweet [little cherub ? was born, as lived ' just long Enough to lay on my lady's breast and die ' there. I thought she'd, t! broke her heart, grieving for it, and the master he cried ike a child for the loss of it, .and to see her cat up. But lor*, it was a mercy it was took. 'What should we a* dope with it afterwards t Afore that little angel oomed they seemed to spend the best half of ^eir. time billing and -cooing like two turtle-doves. Thjey went out a good deal to no end o' parties ; and the master, he seemed to get prouder of his wife every day. I think I can see him now, a' wrapping her up in that bear skin rug, when he drove her out of an afternoon in his mail phaeting. They used to look a precious handsome couple, they did, and I wm beginning to .forget my Lord Blendpn almost entirely. - . ? ' After the poor little thing died, it was a good while afore they were n,uite themselves agin ; but' they :are: that fpnd of e»ch,otb,er, that.aslongas they are together,- nothing seems to hurt them much; and that's' tjhe only thing as makes me a bit content now. ; JuB^howerer, as they were . getting bapk +m. tliAH nlal nHifH Unlilr VtllM- At AV4kn 'am 111 theiW.

The earl, he give her nothing, but her troussore, and a present or so, and the muster didn't care to settle much — City folks never will take a good deal out of the firm (as they call it) if they're rich, and feel themselves safe ; it's only when they're a bit rickety they like to make sure of a good lot, and so give it to their wives. But, bless you, master thought that Caple and Co. was as safe as anything could be. We couldn't stop in Grovenor Square, that was certain, and looking through the Times, my lady saw this bouse advertised to be let furnished, monstrous cheap ; so nothing would do but we must come here. She over-persuaded the master, and he, poor man, didn't know which way to turn, so he gave in to her, and here we came with none of the servants but me ; of course I wasn't a-going to leave 'em. That fellow Jones turned out awful bad, and tried to make out as how master 'ad cheated him out of his wages. The people as we hired the . house of undertook to find some one to cook and * do for us,' they called it Prettily they did ' do for us,' to ba sure. Never shall I forget the night we arrived. We had a rare lot of luggage, I can tell you, for I'd got all my lady's things away from that cousin's of mine, nnd there was no end to it We found ourselves, at eight o'clock on a November night, at one of the poorest, quietest stations you ever did see, with not bo much as a truck or a vehicle of any kind to be had ; and positively I had to undo some of the things there, and get out just what we wanted for the night, and carry it my. own self to the house, until such time next morning as a cart could be found to bring the rest ; and then, in a nasty, drizzling rain, we made our way through the village. In course some of us ought to a' written and told 'emv.what we should want, but my lady had 'never been accustomed to think of such things: I myself scarcely knew the name of the place we was coming to, and the master-=-^- -. Welly-he ? might a' done it ; there's nothing .but what he ought to do, seeing what trouble he's brought us to ; but he was well nigh wor ried to death, for he does mostly think of everything. I'd- give thed«$l nis due» and sometimes Ihatanhe master almost as much as I wish to hate the devil and all his works, as the catechis says, when' I think. how my lady has come down in the world all through him. You'd have thought as how the-earl would have, opened . his . doors to 'em at once, for as long as ever they liked ; but not a bit of it 'f As she made' her, bed, so she most lie on it,' he eaid, when he heard of my lady's misfortunes. 'He'd never liked the match, and he was .rjof going to have the prospects of the other daughters, spoiled because the eldest chase to oppose herself to hiB -wishes.' ; Nasty things those other -gals were, us stuck up as you please, and us different to my lady as light from darkness. If the station was dark, and, dreary, and quiet, what was the house? Just fancy, a large, great,; staring place tf feeing the son, but not a bit near the sea, for there was, a road atween 'em as hnlf the winter was impassable, and afyjrge piece, of «reen afore that, an went down to the shingle ; and wli»fc wit.1i tlia drains, and what' with the damp, it was about, the awfuUest place ty ever you aee'd ; .fo*,jf-.yer nose wasn't nearly took- off with'JtiieMBBttll, your feet went in up toyourfankjkis. ; It Was a regu^ lax quagmire, and nothing. else. ..That wja» the only' way you ^*d o\i:i$$i$g '§-J tjie sea, unless you went miles wand ; so yon may 'think none of as /ta-ub'J$d :the ,sea much.

I thought my poor lamb must a'^giyed' way, for what with the stones and the dark, it was very like walking alive into one's grave. But never a bit of it — there she was, as busy as a bee, only thinkingiof the master. He, poor man, 414 'fwk wnitei and sh6okr and shivered, as .well he might; to thinfc^diAtii!s%iaiTSing; my ladyh^ad come- to. ?? -But' it -was 'no ' use' standing' tiiere)11thiriking.of;that ; 80 I led the w»y into the- dining-room ; there theyhad had the eense-tolight a fire ; and -that was the only bit of cheerrulneas Iaaw; in.the house. Lor* bless me,' what furniture it was li the .

The rooms wern'tso smill, however, and ! not so bad when the fire hirnt up and the ) candles were lighted, and [ had rooted up ' the teapot and tea things, luch as they was, I mostly odds and ends, created and chipped. A pretty piece o' work thvre'd have been in the servants' hall in Q-osvcnor Square if we'd been set, down to Ue like \ When they'd had some tea, aud I'd just made my lady's bed-room a little bit tidy — as tidy as anybody coild make such a place, with not so mud as a jug and basin to match, and chaus as was all rickety, and a bed as growlal every time you turned in it, — we 'didn't trouble much about anything else that nuht ; but the next morning, when we cameto look about us, I did begin to hope tlat the master and my lady would see how it was quite impossible to stay there, and would have gone away anywhere from su;h a tumble down house. , There was plenty of rooms, but we locked up all we didn't want, and made the most of those we did. And my master and my beautiful lady were running here and there, moviugthis and adding that, putting the little nicks that were amongst my lady's things in that lnw-ceilinged, gawgy drawing-room, until real]/ it looked so wonderful tidy, it muut have . been, aston ished at itself. . And so we made the best of things, and made up our minds to stop. There was never a piano, and I know my lady must a' longed sometimes to sing her pretty songs master was so fond o' bearing, but she never made -a trouble of anything, and took to helping him weed the little garden, and . drew ever so many pictures of the country round, for they used to itake such long walks together those two, as happy as you please, though they'd never V thought it possible they could a' lived hele a week, six months ago j and of an evenkig they'd play a game o' cards together} or he'd read while she worked, for there W)i8 plenty on her hands now, and another lit^ cherub on its way. God help it whei it did come ! - But I don't think even thVt trou bled 'em much. ; The country round was pretty ejougb, and the . sea as rough - and boisteuus a could be. Not a soul to speak to saW the rector, who was a gopd:natured,ki\d o' man, with never a chick or a child betrng ing to him, and a ? widower into the W gain. - \ There was four or five other houses A a row with ours, but they was only lived \n in the Summer. No one .who wasn't stsn bad — would ever a' thought o' staying; a, winter there. Howsumnever, . we wern't-so very far from one o' these great fashionable water ing-places, where folks go and try to fancy .they're in London, when they can't be; and my' lady and the master, had plenty ,o' ,friends there, only I don't think they cared to let 'em -know how and where they was. But the master's own sister . she corned there, it Beems, to spend Christmas. iAh, these troubles hadn'thurther much.forshe'd married a milingtary gent, who had plenty -o' money. -Nothing would do but niy mas ter and mistress should spend Ohnstmps with -'em,.and though I believe -they'd far nttor otay wkoro -t,hcj waa^ d»oy V«~ obliged to go. And ao it was arranged. ?.Thefnaster'a^ister hadn't, «xun. for me, she said. : It riled me, I can tell yer. ianoy my poor |ady haying to do every tning ior nerseu - i snonid Uke to have heard. anybody *sk Jier.to go..anyjvhere without me a year ago ; but people change with the -times, and the worll soon Under j BtafadB the difference when you're poor, ,your, relations first, p£ajl., . . :r My, ladyj.»be jeemed-to tiinkehe oou|d .manage ; and^ior' bless yon,the master he ?would tave waited on herlte, a chijd, if she'd let him ; but. she woudu't, not she. And so£hey went, and. Isav '*m off fropi : the etation,( and- came' back - to;. ^hat^greiaA desolate -house,- and cried like a^cbild. Ne^ver,' attice, she waV ati' jnfaat in , my arms, had I parted 'with her afore. ' Our household was small enough, good ness knows. L;That 'womaii »s Jet us iin the 'night we.coine.Bhe cooked and did' what ^he couldfor^em, andi.me wd a gal from the ?eiliage/ we did the rest. 'The gal went w'that, on the ChriBtmat night, me and the woman were le&itogethcr.; I never liked that woman. -She was the wife of a sailor, and yas, put in by ^hepeople as let the house. .There was al ways a kind of mystery aboit her ; I never could make out!whether'sU re&Uy; had a husband or not Sumetiaes, when we was sitting together of an ererijng.ttere'd be a tap, at the back door,, and. she'd go ont for Wf-anrhonror mote, to -talk with a neigh bour who wanted a word with her, she said ; but what that word- might be about I never cared to ask, for the like of her was no. company, for me, and perhaps she knowed it, for she never, tried to make herself agreeable. ' ' _ Lfelthprfible lonely when I went to bed that night. The woman, she slept dn one of the rooma'dowu stairs, near the kitchen, but my room .was near my 'lafly's, and I went in tihere. sJnd(, into the. dressing-room ,that hid ont of it- to see as. Td locked up all the drawBW where the jewels and- the laces'itnd suchlike was. My laid/ wouldn't Jake.mucb_with hei1, but I 'almost wished ahe had, for just ithen they seemed to me safer with her-than' in 'that lone desolate house. She laughed when, I said some thing o' thjsto'her, as I wus.ipassing, and asked me who I thought was to be there, and if they did, who'd be likely to take '«m Bnt, . somehow, on Christmas jiight, I felt mighty fearsome, and went roond to all thedpprs'we had locked to make sure they was right, and ^had the keys. . Such '» Chr)sima8 night I never remem ber. -In the old days at CrnmpEted, we always had a servants' ball to-night, nnd the gentlefolks ae was stopping in the house, and all the childreu,!they led off the canoe, ana mere iwss- snap-uragou ana bu kinds of fun for them, as veil a for us, in the great hall first of alL Then in Qrosvenor Square my lady would insist that her servants had their dance too, and Bhe and the master allers dined with the Honourable Mr. Gotter,her ladyship's uncle ; so we was left all to our wlvea, and fine fan we had. There was no «&do;' good things** the topper then, I can tell you ; and now I'd come to sit I down with that woman to a uiorsul of beef, and such a pudding ! — one of her making. They seemed to think nothing of Christ mas Day, the people in tho^e parts, but uiy lady had remembered me and my loneli ness, and had sent me one of the prettiest neck ribbins you'd ever seen, for a Christ mas-box, that very morning. However, it was no good creeping about the house like a ghost, and fancying you see all kinds of things in every corner, and that everybody had set their minds on robbing the place ; that wouldn't do ; nor would it do to keep a thinking o' what was past and gone, and couldn't be brought back again was it ever so ; so I locked my lady's room, and went to my own bed and tried to sleep. At first I couldn't ; the wind was blowing and the windows rattled, and the furniture cracked, and I kept fan cying as how some one was creeping up the stairs ; but that was all rubbish, and in time I really did forget it, and off to sleep I went. I suppose I'd been asleep about an hour, when I was woke by hearin' some one ureauuu 4uii« ciose to me. jL/ucKiiy, l didn't stir nor move, and as I opened my eyes, what could I see but that woman as 'did for us ' a standing by the bedside in a queer sort of chintz jacket, with a red petticoat ; and such a nicht-nap I It was big eiiougn tor a cradle for a oaDy tliii~ months old, and had frills enough for two bassinets, I should think. (My head runned fast then on bassinets, for I was trimming one for cherub number two, that was coming before many months was over.) There she was, a nasty hussy, as I'd al ways thought her, rummaging in my pockets. She didn't find what she wanted quite at first ; but she did afterwards, or thought she did, It was a large bunch of keys she held in her hand as she booked at me, ' sleeping so quietly,' no doubt she said to herself .when she trod on tiptoes out of the room. I jumped out of bed like lightning, but as quiet as possible; meanin' to folio w her. Luckily I stopped a minnit at the door, for she wasn't alone, and I heard her say, 'I've got 'em — mind you try 'em.carefuL The missus's room's among 'em, and there's lots o' fine things there. I've seen her wear- plenty o' gold and jewels on her arms sometimes, . when I brought the dinner to the door o' nights.' I remembered, . as I heard it, that my lady had worn a little jewel'ry now and then at dinner, just to please the master. Little did I think then how foolish it was. But, thank God, I had the keys of her room and the dressing-room safe under my pillow. I had locked them the last of all, and they wasn't on. the bunch, so I didn't put. 'em in my pocket with the .rest. 1 But what was I to do ! The two were fust outside my 'door, -and if. they heerd so tnuch as a move, they'd be in, and -kill me ierhaps. Those Bailor chaps are npt oyer \- scrupulous ; audit was a sailor I could see through the crack o' the door, as I stopd pterin' through, watehin' .the man and the wWan as they was ezaminin' the bunch; o' keys -by the, light o' a very; dim rushlight, that .flickered so, it almost went out once -or twice. I dared not «o much as go, back to the bed, and get the other, keys from under on ; for. it iwa»- terrible -cold, and my teeth chattered. so, . I .was .nfr&icLthey; must a' heerd 'em, for ^he ifoman hadn't quite closed mydoor.whisn she.iwant out ?At last -the v. made od their minds that :oneof thekeys was my lady's room's, and they ' turned'^rapi the-ipassage xlose to my ?room, where the door ,w-s, I rushed back tojuy bed like aehot, eeiied the keys from :tmder -the ' gillpw, and , a thick woollien ?shawl as was- hanging on a, peg near, apd was again at my post at -the door listnip!, afore- you -could a'jj^id ' Jack Bqbinson,' Itlwasirt very wise-o' -me to hold th^m ;keys in my hands ? for if they'd got at me, ?itJwoiild a' been easy- work to. wrench '^m , away ; but somehow. I trusted to chanceior lock — or whatever we .call soraethink quite different-rand there I stood, my bare feet on the boards, a listening hard. ; I could hear '«m i.ttyin'-'jone 'key after another, though they was .very quiet abqut it; but I could a heerd, a pia drop, niy ears was wound up to that pitch- I almost should get any of my lady's things, I'd show -fight, and eee what could be done. It seemed to me hours — perhaps \ it might a' buen half an hour — afore they began to think they hadn't got the right key. ' I must say as' how they show'd plenty o' perserverauoe, worthy o' a better cause. Just then, I suppose it was, as thjeir light went put It; had only been a bit, at at first; 'they'd been .longer at their job inan iney a rectoueaupon. * I heerd; the man say he'd, go down and find another bit o' candle, while she come into me to have auothei look, and see if there -weren't more keys to be found. My heart! did -give a jump then. Luckily, however, she seemed to think the man wouldn't be, abje to find it, ao Bhe went down . herself, saying she'd be back in a minnit,, antt, 'd come in to me therj. -So the man was left 'alone but ten yards from where I was on the other wide o' the door. I couldn't get my mind clear to think what I ought to do. - I felt as how Fd better go to bed again, and pretend to sleep, but I couldn't quite reconcile myself to leavin' my post Thank God I didn't, for in another second the man grew im patient that the' light didn't come, and went to see what the woman was doing. Now was my time, and I made the most of it, and flew out o' my room like light ning, but quiet too— though,' fool as I was, I left my door open. I don't know whe ther it was that my fingers trembled, but I couldn't cet the key into my lady's door for ever so long, and just as I turned it I . heard, 'em coming up -stairs. It was open, and I was in, bat still I had to get the key out again, and lock it on the inside. I thought as how I should never get that key out again, but I did though, and just as I turned it safe and sound inside, they both rushed at the door, and was pulling of it with all their might My door bein' open had told 'em the truth at once. I could see by what they said to each other that they meant mischief. Here was I in a lone house, with not a livin' soul within call, and nothing bnt a door be tween two reckless wretches aa 'd stand at nothing ; and, worst of all, the dressin'- I routn led out of my lady's ronm, nnd there was another door oponin' out o' that into the passage, so that they hid two doors to get in by, six] I had two doars to defend. The valuables was mostly in the dressin' room, and I made up my mind pretty quick what to do. I mshed in there and dragged the chest of drawers as stood by, right across the doorway, and then set to work as bard as I could, gettiu' all the heavy things I could move into the dressin' room, out of the bed-room. Lor', how strong I was ! Fright is a wonderful streugthener I couldn't a' done a quar ter as much another time. They never seemed to think o' that other door, an all the time I was a draggin' tbe things in, they was a hammering agin my lady'B room with all their might, .and every minnet I thought they'd break it in afore I could get everything I wanted. Just as I'd got iny master's writin'-table nn.fp. nnr? t.iinf. vrna a liaam* Viif «f -Airnif,ipa (it struck me at the last there might be something worth stealing in it,) I saw the bed-room door beginning to give way. Thank God, I could lock the dreBsin'-room door next to my lady'B room now, and had nothing to do but to pile .up tbe heavy things against the two doors — fine as I'd just shut, the other as opened into the pas sage. There .wm. . &A;,-t*Ua. - tad the ixuuB.0, nua tUe drawers, and the cnairo^ urn u\;ikcbi-y uiiugt^ uiufsii.ui em, - uuD'triiejr made good heaps ; and' when it was all done, I began to feel What a terrible time was afore me. AH this had taken a - great while to do, and the mornin' yaa begimn' to break I opened the window and screeched as hard as ever I could, but no one came, and the wind and sea , ftey oxownei the noise I made ; so there -I- sat- wrapped in! my woollen sbawj, with :: the ? two wretches a llMiiimri in ' nwiyy i^wxui. It got ' lighter luckily every minnit There was an ojd clock ,6'n ..tie lauding, .as I'd. made to .go, after a deal o' trouble, and I could hear it. a ticking, and it was com pany like. Still the hammerin' -went -on, «ndl &It; as how they ^ust get jri and murder me afore long. ? But! wept on screamin* 'every' now and then, »iid that, .saved' me/ for tie man as belonged to ?th.e-&rm;(heer;dine as he was going to his work,, and I'inannaged to make him underBfend'the.stEait I was in.

What joint of meat is most appropriate for an empty larder*'— A fillet (fill it). A dilapidated old darkey in Montgomery, while watching the monkeys in a menagerie in that city, spoke thusly : — ' Dem chil dren got too much sense to come outer dat cage ; white folks cut dar tails off, and set 'em to votin' and makin' constitewtions.' ' John, John !' shouted an old gentle man to his sou, ' get np ; the day is break ing.' — ?' Very well,' said John, ' let it break; it owes us nothing.' Interval of twenty minutes. 'John, John ; here the sun is up before you.' — ' Very well,' said John; 'he has farther to go than we have.'
