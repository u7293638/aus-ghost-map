TALE. A Murderous Mes* rrterist. ? ) J ,' . \ .»I ( . r, By Julian* Hawthorne. ^ ,ifew people tire aware of the exkte^ee^ tt' smigll Uopteuy near Slyne Head, ©iv thei«[<»& co£8f of Ireland. ' The cbal-blaejc rockpahd' tl^prepipitpus promontories of that 'desolate regipn reader the ac^nery imposing, and the stormy, whioh are frequent, form a epeotatelo" that is nothing less than magnificent;', !Phe whqLe force of the Atlantic breaks . against those oftful oliffe, and the half-wild inhabi tants-of ttye regions wili tell you that in win- : ter the spray, is sometimes dashed three hun dred feet in air. Fishing is almost th# sole occupation of the natives. The neareBt rail w«y station is ftt. Westport, thirty > miles away, ."W&encfl; the explorer mtast travel dither' on foot or upon the dilapidated 'jaunting oar' that serves as a btage, and ii driven by Pat Mjftguir^,. who is >aleo the proprietor of the inn. But explorers are as few as snowflakes in June, and for several years previous to the da^e of this story, Dr. Griffith Gramery had been the only visitor. 3$ie doctor was not a comely man. He had a hig square head, covered, with grizzled red hair, which stood upright thick eyebrows hanging far down over a pair of small but extraordinarily piercing eyes ; a 'large nose and . mouth, and a broad, short chin. His head wa&sset; low down upon broad shoulders; his fivms were long, but hie body rather small and short. The peasants held him in super* stitiouB aweand respect, believing him to be in league with Satan, probably because hie hadfOnee ortwioe exercised upon them a re markable magnetizing power that he pos sessed.. ? But as ail his dealings with them had been beneficent, they mingled their awe with Affection. A man may be hand-in glove with the Evil One and yet a very good fellow at bottom. Uhis-season Dr. Gramery arrived, as usual, about foe first of October; but he explained to Pat Maguire that a young lady and gen tlemafa, friends of his, would come on the seventh of the month, and would expect Pat to be at Westport railway, station to drive them over. The doctor, it seems, had met Mr. .and Mrs. Roger Mowbray in London during the previous season, and had sung the praises of Slyne Head so eloquently that the young couple-they were in their honeymoon ' -told prom ieed lto come 6ver- and spend » week there. They were as good as their word, and on the evening of the appointed day they drbve up on the jaunting-car, and were cordially welcomed at the inn doOr b^ thedoctorJ The moon, was close to the full, nod the air j soft nhd tbild. After supper the three friends Strolled out on the cliffs, and ttoger Mowbray and his wife both confessed that tiiey had. nevBT seen so grand a sight. The rocks are full of caves, some midway in tho face of in accessible precipioes, some so low down as to be covered at high water. The coast is every where jagged and irregular.

Doctor Gramery must have had a good deal of the actor's talent; he had begun his speech lightly enough, but as he went on his voice became hoarse and incisive ; lite made strange gestures, and there was something territte and ominous in his aspect. Rachel sat gazing at him with parted lips and widen ing eyes- Ashe finished she rose to her feet, arid stretching out her hand to her husband faltered: * Let me go ! ' By a sudden forcible movement the doctor interposed himself beweefn them. 1 Five o'clock!4 he exclaimed, in a stern, commanding tone. Roger stood motionless for a few mom&nts;, while a dazed expression came over his face. The d6ctor now moved to one side; th6 husband and wife ware within a coupUt of paces of each other, and Soger* s eyes rested upon her. But there was a queer vaguelotfk in them, and presently hp said,in a sluggifili tone, ' WherfriisRaSchel'?' | ' Here I am-here !' she exclaimed ;' here in iEront of you1. Whatafts you, Jioger ?

How was it ?' ' Mrs. Mowbray P' responded the doctor, coolly;' why, my dear iellow, she just went out of the cave. Is it possible yon didn't notice herP See!' he added, pointing outward ' there she stands on that rock at the entrance beckoning to us! Gome on, it's getting damp, and we shall be catching our death of cold. We have a long walk before us.' The two men moved together toward the ; mouth of the cave, Roger walking like a man in a dream. Suddenly a piercing shriek fille d the cave. ' Roger ! my. husbana ! my love! Hear me! dome to me !' Then came another shriek. Mowbray and the doctor Were now at the mouth of the cave, and the latter pointed along the beach to the right. ' There she goes!' he said;' let us hurry and catch up with' her. She will stumble among these slippery stones and hurt herself.' < Oh, God !' said a husky voice, strained and unnatural. The chain rattled and strained; there was a groan. "Mowbray had moved out of sight. The doctor turned and looked into the cave with a hideous expression then he, too, vanished. * * * * * * I A. storm had been gathering during the | afternoon and soon after five o'clock it burst over Slyne Head, with frequent crashes of thunder and zigzags of lighting. The rain hissed down in torrents. Six o'clock had passed when Roger Mowbray, his clothes soaked through and a scared, drawn look on his face, walked hastily into the inn and called for Pat Maguire. After the summons had been repeated once or twice, with in creasing emphasis, Mrs Maguire appeared from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. ' What would ye be pleased to want sorr P' said she; ' sure, Misther Maguire stepped out an hour ago; he was after fearin' ye'd be caught in the rain, and 'twas warnin' ye to come home he'd be. Didn't ye meet him at all, at all ?' 'No. Has Mrs. Mowbray-my wife-has she returned F' . Yer wife, is it P Indade, then, she has not, soor ! Ye're the first in this night. ' ' Doctor Gramery-r-has not he got back ? We parted on the beach-he took another path up the cliff. Have you seen nothing of either of them ?' ' Not I, Misther Mowbray-hide nor hair av'em. But there was a bit av a letter the doctor left this mornin', an' he was tfellin' Misther Maguire to give it ye at six o'clock -not sooner. Maybe th4t!llf,explftin things -more betoken 'tis six o'clockpow, an' afther* ? Wait till I fetch it." "I She disappeared iatothe . ^kitchen1 aiil returned % a>mottMjit . *<;l&ttBr; fa her hands.

At that moment there was a hurried step on the threshold, a sound of voices, and the door was thrown open. In swept the storm, with wind and rain; a clap of thunder shook the hoiise, and there stood Fat Maguire, red in the face and breathless. Leaning on his arm, weak and tottering, her clothing drenched and torn, her wot hair hanging about 'her shoulders, her wrist bruised and bloody-^-there Was Rachael Mowbray, rescued at utmost need, with the sea leaping at her very throat, by the worthy Irishman whom chance had brought within hearing of her final outcry.: -There tehe was, no phantom of a bewildered brain, but true flesh an|d blood, alive And safe-and in her husband'a arma! ! Next morning, when the storm, had cleared away, the dead body of Dootor tjrameiy, alias John 3?elbrigg^ was&mndlying; at the foot of Slyne Head, crushed and disfigured. How he came to hiis death, whether by aoci* dont or design, was never known. H# may have lost his way and missed his footing in the storm j or tho horror of the deed he had done may have proved too much even for his ' iron nerves, and he sought oblivion in .suicide. He was buried where hip fell, and the great cli& is his gravestone ; but the peasants avoid the spot, and in the roaring of the waves they sometimes fancy that they catch the fearful outcry of a lost soul. -Cosmopolitan.
