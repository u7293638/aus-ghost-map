MADE CELEBRATED BY CANNON-BALLS. Eyen here in England are buildings — some of them 'within the sonnd of all the marvels of the most modern machinery — that dravr thousands of visitors every year, daring the summer time, almost solely because they have embedded in their iame-houonrcd masonry, cannon-balls, generally relics of Cronrwellian warfare. One of the most honoured posses sions of Bradford, in Yorkshire, is an ancient bag of wool, in tie depths of the bale being two heavy cannon-balls. When Cromwell's troops- beset the town the willy wool dealers piled bales of iJie commodity in 'which they dealt, round the tower of the parish church, and the bag in question was one of those, which warded of the artillery fire. La other parts of Yorkshire alone there are quite five buildings, the main feature of which in calling up old memories, is a candon- ball, stuck deep ly in the stone-work, and, at Rich mond, in that country, are two such shot, that entered at one, and the same apperture. Sear Conway, in North Wales, there is a huge and very old tree, that has embedded in it, a cannon-ball, that was intended for a tower, standing by ; and a much-visited garden at Preston, in Lancashire, derives its sole interest from a number of cannon-balls, and arms of various sorts, that were part of the armament of the Young Preten der, when he penetrated so far with his forces in 1745. Altogether it is astonishing what an interestaveritable cannon-ball gives to an old building ; it is almost as precious a possession as a family ghost.
