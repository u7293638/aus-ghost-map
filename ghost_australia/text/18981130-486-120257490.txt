Then in a moment -the truth. ('flashed upon. me, for In the clear moonlight L saw her plainly. I had drawn up the blind ; and while my bod was in shadow, by (ho window it was almost as light as day. This was no servant! Her long, beautiful hair was , , unbound, rippling in golden waves ;/ below- , her waist.

'Once she mrned her fiiMApifJjyrtfs-'-mp— n beautiful face, but palrijy i drawn with anguish, and the eyes \ ,.\\(e with horror. I fried to -move or speak, but limbs and tongue were paralysed. She mooned pitoously and wrung her hands ; then, to my Jiorror, glided to the window and threw It open with a terrible cry. There, was an answering cry— the walling of a little \- child outside. The woman threw', out j her arms .with a despairing gesture, and i the loose, sleeves fell back, disclosing I their exquisite shapeliness. She would have flung herself from .the window, but was hold back— the horror of It— by a ' . hand; I saw It distinctly, and a ~rf shadowy arm, nothing else. .1 think I '?-$ . realised then something of -what Bel Vt9»j. ahazziir must have felt when ho saw the ^ ?? j fingers that wrote— mone, tckel, up , '^ harsittifc \ ?,.

'There wns another awful cry, and again there came the pitiful wailing from outside, fainter than :beforo, and dying away in the distance. To this day, when 1 rend of -.

' There seemed to lie a struggle, the window wns forcibly closed, the .woman sank on the floor with hands elanped and the beautiful face upturned In agony. Then the. moon' shone- out, and slowly (ho vision faded.' There was a long silence when Ian had finished speaking. Then Janet spoke. ' Who was she ? What was her story, Mr. M'Tver ?' ' Alexander told me the story next day. Margaret Elliot of Bams'lnio. a be.iutiful and high-spirited girl, fell in love with and secretly married her brother's tutor. When the marriage was discovered he was in Edinburgh preparing a home for his wife, and on his return there was a terrible scone, for Mrs. Elliot was another T,ndy Ash ton. She told him that his wife had boon sent to a French convent, and the poor follow, mud with grief, wont abroad in search of her. It was a false hood, of course.' Margaret never left her mother's house alive. Her little child was taken away one night and Margaret in despair tried to throw herself from the window of that very room I slept in.

' They helped the aid gentleman to his foot., and took hirh into Hie room to recover. 'I'm all right, bairns,' ho said,' when ho had been revived with a mouthful of whisky.
