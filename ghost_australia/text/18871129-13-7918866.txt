NEW SOUTH WALES. (FROM Our CoRRESPONDENT.) SYDNEY, Nov. 20. We have not for a long time had any subject that has excited so general an interest as the Premier's proposal to change the name of the colony to " Australia " Other subjects, such as the land question, interest particular persons whose business is involved therein, but this question seems to excite an unusually general discussion The dominant feeling is undoubtedly against the proposed change, and it is a matter for wonder that so large a majority of the Legislative Assembly has followed the Premier's lead This certainly would not have been the case if he had not previously felt his way, and even got Borne members to commit themselves by signing a paper by hat makes the division on the matter still more odd is that the leader of the Opposition, Mr Dibbs supports the Premier, while some strong Ministerial supporters condemn his action altogether. Both the leading journals protest against the assumption involved in the Ministerial pro- posed, but the Licensing Nein support it. Sir John Robertson also is at one with fair Henry Parkes in the matter, the members of the Assembly who have already voted can hardly go back, but it is still very doubtful whether the bill can get through that House It is said that members of the Council have already been approached on the subject, but there has been so loud an outcry against the round robin " system of booking votes beforehand, that the honour able gentlemen will be very foolish indeed if they do not protect themselves against having their independence tampered with In the discussion which took place in the Upper House at the close of last session, there was anything but a general feeling in favour of the term Australia, and at that time the matter was discussed without any knowledge of what the feelings of the other colonies would be of those who are opposed to the change will certainly view with satisfaction the energetic protests, and I have heard commendation expressed of Mr Gillies a proposal of remonstrating first with Sir Henry Parkes, and, failing success, then sending home a joint protest from the other colonies. The debate on the Naval Defence Bill has been satisfactory in two respects In the first place the question has not been discussed on party lines, the leader of the Opposition 117 ing his cordial support to the bill, and even complaining, of the coldness of the Premier, and, second. ), the objections that were made were such as will not bear examination Sir Henry Parkes was very cautious and reserved in submitting the bill, and particularly anxious to take credit to himself for not having committed the colony behind its back. He was also very anxious to explain that he was not inconsistent with his oft expressed declarations against professional soldiers and in favour of either defenders He further denied that the scheme in any way committed us to Imperial federation, or dragged us into any approval of the foreign policy of the mother country. He argued that the state of the world was such as to expose us to foreign attack and as that was so, we were bound to provide ourselves with a coastal defence, and this scheme was cheaper by one half, as well as being more effective than anything we could set upon our own resources Some of the Opposition speakers took the ground that it was the duty of the mother country to protect our coasts and all our goods and ships on the high seas, others maintained that we were choking off an infant navy of our own others that we were subsidising the Imperial navy, and taking the first steps towards becoming responsible for the national debt, and others that we were handing ourselves over, bound hand and foot to Imperialism Public opinion, as far as it can be gathered, is in favour of the bill, because it has long been felt that we need better defence afloat, and there is not at present the ghost of a chance of a federal navy the trades unions are keeping up a very vigorous agitation on the Chinese question, having been moved thereto by a fear lest the visit of the Chinese Commissioners should lead to a fresh Chinese immigration, and the agitation has been further re- enforced by a rumour that the Chinese in Mr Higginson's service in New Caledonia will, on the conclusion of their term be sent across here There is at the present time no increase whatever in the number of Chinese colonists, and the proposed new legislation 13 based on fears and rumours exclusively, but there is a strong desire to take advantage of the excitement not only to keep out new arrivals but to force outthoscuhoarealreadyhere 'the small politicians join eagerly in the howl against John Chinaman bu t Sir Henry Parkes who has also a) s spoken temperately) on the subject, has intimated his willingness to do more than to have adequate protective legislation, and has also pointed out that it is an international question of some delicacy and difficulty The furious agitators forget that the Chinese Government is at liberty to copy our legisla- tion word for word and to apply it exactly to our countrymen who have pushed their way into China. We have in the colony an old law against Sunday trading, and every now and then some good people got it partially put into force The inspector of police was stirred up a little while ago to take notice of the selling of Sunday papers, and the constable whom he instructed to move in the matter dropped upon the sale of the Sunday Times, a journal which has been coming down rather heavily on the Premier. The aegis loved party of course at once jumped to the conclusion that the Premier had done this as a piece of persecution, whereas it turns out that he knew nothing at all about it. But these Sunday press cushions are all an inconsistency. We allow omnibus proprietors and steam- boat proprietors to make money at their usual trade on Sunday, and the Government itself does a stroke of business with its trams and railway B and then we come down on a Chinese gardener for seeing his cabbages, or on a little boy who is selling newspapers. 'The effect of these prosecutions will probably be to cause a repeat of the law.
