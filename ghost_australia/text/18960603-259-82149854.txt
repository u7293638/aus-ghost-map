A Cemetery Ghost. At the Adelaide Police Court on Thursday a man named A. Rudd was charged with unlaw- fully disguising himself with a piece of white cloth, and, therefore, to be deemed idle and disorder!y. On the night of May 6, Thomas Medal was on his way home when he noticed a figure in white emerge from the Wesleyan cemetery. As it approached him he heard it say, " Thomas Medal, I claim you!" He an- swered, " Take me, then," and struck it with a stick which he carried. The ghost closed with him, and in the scuffle the sheet was disar- ranged and Medal identified Rudd, The de- fendant was fined 10s and costs, or Â£4 5s in all. The " Orotara" brings a special CASH purhsse of Drapery, bought for W. K. Hyslop on the spot. His customers know full well what a saving there is of intermediate profits.
