C0BP5E8 ! WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. The reception of a letter from the Secretary of the Cemeteries' Confer ence brought several councillors to their feet on Tuesday sight. When Gr. Tarvec suggested that the letter should be referred to their delegate, %jTm \£uuuik mail gentleman expressea a wish to be guided by the rest of the. councillorBas to his actions at the con ference. Evidently he did not relish the idea that lie might be visited in wrath hereafter by the ghosts of some of his brother councillors, if they found he had voted for a resting place not con genial to their feelings. Bnt why all this concern about a burial ground ? In other sanitary matters great pro gress has been made in recent years, bnt the old and cumbersome method of cemetery burial still continues. Wh«i We 3iew % system of sewerage, which we are now becoming ac quainted with so rapidly, was first mooted, great opposition was mani fested ; but very few householders, who have had their properties connected with the system, would go back to the old atate of savagery which we were so long acquainted with. And if advance has been made in such matters, why not carry out improve ments further, and follow in the watte of some of the moBt advanced scien tific reformers of the day by adopting cremation ? In England, notwith standing John - Bull's conservative propensities, cremation is becoming more fashionable year by year, and the following reference will show how Hub method of dealing with corpses is received, where it has been applied :— At a place called Woking there is a ? crematory. The entire expense of a cremation, injduding the conveyance of the body to Woking, is about £15 ; but of conrse, there is no grave to purchaee or tombstone to erect. Sir Henry Thompson ridicules the idea'' that the cremation of a body is a ghastly sight. r He has witnessed many cremations, and has never seen anything oftheMnd.

Quinri wants to immortalise himself, ahl have his name held in everlaeting reuiembrauce, what better thing could he do than oppose all the proposals'' for burial places which may be brought forward at the Gonlefence, and. go bald-headed for the establishaientj of crematories.
