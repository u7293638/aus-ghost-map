It appeared from the evidence of William Bellamy, Matthew Gregory, Simon Gee, and others, that Turner had embraced the religion of the 'Mormon es, or Latter-day Saints,and after preaching at Handsworth Woodhouse, on Sunday, the 19th of November, he gave out that if any person felt thoroughly convinced of the truth of the religious principles' which' he professed and preached, and would attend early on the following morning, he would baptise them in the River Rother. Ac- cordingly, very early on the following morning, several persons met Turner, their preacher, in a meadow called Fairy "Meadow," adjoining the praying andasiuging,- and belong addressed' by one of their preachers frodn Sheffield, as' to thiatbsolute necessity of" their being born of water aid' of the ,Spirit, or; else they could not e'nter the kingdom of Heaven, several of their disciples at' once' proceeded to strip off all their clothes,, and Tiurer plunged iilto the river, which was deep, and' considerably aswollen by the late rains, followed by one William Bellamy, a collier, whom' he baptised in the name of the Father, Son, andd Holy Ghost?. e gotouP safe `and then one Maithew Gregorywent in, and, the priest, after plunging hiins over head, to use the man's own words, and nearly ? sl?kening" him, he, with great dificulty, half drowned, much starved,: and frightened, scrambled out of the river, and saved his life; but Turner,' on leaving hold of.

Its neighbours, Cephrenes, Philista, and Mycerinaes approach it too nearly in magnitide, and bear too close a family resemblance for purposes of.contrast: It is advisable, if you are bent on mounting to the summit, to disencumber yourself of all but your shirt and a pair of loose trowsers, for the journey upwards must be taken rapidly, and cannot easily be accomplished with warm or tight clothing.
