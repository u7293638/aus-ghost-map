' Or let some simpler blossom twine Upon thy forehead, daughter mine, Blush rose or lily white ; Or let a simple string of pearls Gleam girlishly among thy curls, Upon this festive night. ' But take those waxen blooma away, Ah, darling 1 thoughts'! cannot stay Spring in my wakened heart ; Pass on, my sweetest, out of sight, Take thou thy fiil of young delight, While I sit hero apart.'

Now, wherefore should it wake to-night, That ghost of deadend-gone delight I thought for ever laid? The air is heavy with perfume, Out-breathed from that white mass of bloom My child laid gently down; Ah rue! an old-time sorrow stirs 1 , I see on ourls as bright as hers ' Aateph&notisorbwn.; ,-\ , Across dork memory's time-worn track A viBionorUiatfaoe comes book ThatwonmytoyUhheartV ?? - My wife, the mother of my child, What WaVes of sorrow wide and wild .
