THE FALSE NANA SAHIB. We believe (says the Bombay Gazette, of 14bh December) it has now been deoided that there can be no trial of the prisoner at Caws pore, because there is no positive trustworthy evidence to show that the man is the Nana Sahib, It has boeu fondly hoped by many Englishmen who are loth to let bim escape scot free after all the trouble he has oivon. that be might, at all events, be tried and punished for personation. But evon this satisfaction cannot bo obtained. Personating whom? might be asked. Much as the In dian Criminal Procedure Code is distinguished by ingenuity, we are afraid it provides no power to punish a man for personating a ghost. If tho accusers of tho prisoners an swered, M for personating Nana Sabih." then of course they would have to prove that the Nana Sahib is not deadâ€” rather a aiffiaalt task, we imagine. As for punishing the prisoner for simple lying, that also is impos sible, for if It were once admitted that this could bo done few natives would feel safe of preserving their personal liberty for a day, or even an hour No, we are afraid there is no help for It. The prisoner must be liberated and sent baok to Soindiah with the compli ments of tbe Government of India, and a request that he may try again
