British Autumn Hancetrsres. Sir Evelyn Wood, on September 23, issued an order to the troops lately engaged in the autumn manoeuvres, in which he records, his great satisfaction with the conduct of all con- — corned. Soldiers of all ranks, he says, havo shown unflagging interest in the work, and the cheerful manner in which the great discomfort of the last few days, caused by had weather, was borne by them impressed him most favour ably. He has received from many of the real- • dents living in the neighbourhood of tha manoeuvre ground, and from the civil police^ uniformly satisfactory accounts, of the beha viour of the troops. " It may be taken for granted (writes the * Club Man ' in the European J fail) we are ardent lovers of peace in England at all events. It is well we are. k Of our own small, autumn manoeuvres' wo have no great reason to be proud. Yba will have heard the story about the big' per centage of undergrown youths whom tha regimental surgeons declared to bo too feeble to undergo the fatigues even of a. brief miima campaign, and^of the young soldiers who found a march of 14 miles too much for their strength. It is not pleasant reading. Our military critics are afraid to say in public what they really think. But at last the public is beginning to learn how we have sacrificed the efficiency o£ our active army for the ghost of a reserve. When this fact has been thoroughly mastered, another of our periodical panic3 may bo ex pected.*' "What an army wc could have,'' wrote Lord Randolph Churchill the other day in the 'Jraphic, "if we only had a War Office." Perhaps we shall want a national catastrophe to make us improve that out of existence.
