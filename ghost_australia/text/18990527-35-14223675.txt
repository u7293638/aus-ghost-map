It is one for the limitation of the working hours of the Governor to something under eight hours (Loud laughter ) I can assure you I should be glad if anything like eight hours a day could be established for myself and those who have been living at Government House during the last few days, we should have thought ourselves very lucky indeed if we could have got off with 12 hours Hav- ing said so much as an excuse for not saying more, I call upon Mr Wise to read his lecture upon the " Oxford Union " (Applause Mr WISE, after explaining the constitution of the Oxford Union, said that it was characterised by an intolerance of bores and self-assertiveness which made it an admirable Parliamentary school, and gave it a peculiar resemblance to the House of Commons The man who could keep the car of the Union it would almost certainly command attention at St Stephen's (Applause ) He passed on to glance at phases of thought and nativity brought before its members by the union, and treated that part of his home with much i effect Hoiv occurred, he said, that society had always been in its opinions The House of Lords might give way before the inroads of I'cmocracy, but the temper of the union was unbroken and its courage undismayed It rejected the Reform Bill of 1632 long after that measure had been passed by the Imperial Parliament (Laughter ) And it tion always shown a watchful and determined opposition to attacks upon the British Constitution In 1841 it declared that the power of the United States was of a character calculated to experience a speedy deci) (Loud laughter ) It's members had been general) read) to talk the most upon those subjects of which they know the least It had been rigid and inexorable in political orthodoxy, and had always shown an open mind on non-political subjects It had never been prepared to disbelieve those phenomena commonly called " ghosts " The motion,-" That this House desires to cremated " was carried in 1888 by a majority of three (Loud laughter ). It refused, however, by a small majority to express my opinion " That the time is ripe for the key out of man against the growing ascendency of woman " (Lou 1 laughter ) the union had several times pronounced cheap law to be a national evil Its view is on public affairs had always been extremely gloomy It had declared every Liberal Government hopelessly incompetent (Laughter) It had affirm d that it would rather not have been born in Athens in the year 1901 of (Laughter) Nevertheless it had the candour on June (j, 1881, to vote by a motion ty of three-point this House deplores its past history as recorded in the minutes of public criticism " (Loud laughter ) The records of the union afforded many pleasant indications of the early characteristics of eminent men The supremacy of the union had never been seriously challenged by a rival society It had continue I theroprcEcntalivo of undergraduate Oxford, reflecting with equal accuracy the vices and the virtues of that curious medley And if the standard of its debates had fluctuated from time to time as the better speakers had gone down before successors to them had been formed, it had nevertheless always in accordance with Oxford traditions recog hoped that the canons of good behaviour are founded upon the elementary laws of good sense and good feeling so that a revolt against them is not the way, to independence, but to degeneration the Oxford Union kept its pride of place because it was not an audience to mistake more eccentricity for originality, or to think that a man had gained in self respect by forgetting his manners So might it flourish to the end of time ( Applause ) A vote of thanks was accorded to Mr Wise for his lecture On the motion of Mr S E Lees, seconded by Mr Joseph Finney and supported by Mr J G M'Laren, the heartiest thanks of the meeting and of the union were by acclamation accorded to his Excellency for presiding and also to the Rules ac companying him for their presence at the gathering His Excellency rose to acknowledge the compli- ment, and was loudly cheered He said Ladies and gentlemen -I now of you many thanks for the very kind and cordial way in which you have received this vote of thanks for my presence to- night But the Boiitiinonts to which Mr Wise gave such eloquent expression in speaking of the Oxford Union are in themselves sufficient excuse for my presence to-night I could not help feeling that having so lately come from Oxford it would be wrong to allow a lecture on so interesting a subject to pass by without being present There are many trains of thought which have been opened by Mr Wise And as one who for a time was president of the Oxford Union, I can assure you that throughout the whole of the lecture I was reminded of some incidents which occurred at the time I was connected with the union that are parallels to the circumstances described by Mr Wise Before I sit down, and motoring less particularly to that union, you will perhaps allow me to say that this society does its best to encourage something else than discussions I have had much pleasure in reading the essays which have taken prizes, contributed by those connected with this union I think it is a most excellent sign that there should be such readiness on the part of any union or society to welcome young people who are able to write essays of so much promise There is one remark about the reason for the existence of such societies I should like to say They enable one to formulate his opinions Without training of the kind which these societies afford ode has a tendency to get up and give expects!! to some remark without knowing why he makes it I should be sorry to say that that is the case in Australia But in England a large number of people buy their newspaper the " Daily Mail " or the " Daily Telegraph" and their views are founded entirely upon what they read in those papers Now you cannot get up and talk about something you have read in a morning paper unless you know why that statement vans made, and have some reason for forcing your opinion If only for that reason, I am glad that this society is doing the work which has been indicated for myself I am afraid I do not of len read the newspapers , therefore, that does not appeal to me so much as it ought to do there is nothing more important than that people should have their opinions, and should be able to make clear the reasons why they hold them Applause ) So far as these societies do help you to form your opinions and enable you to give your reasons for holding them, so far they ought to be supported (Cheers ) I believe that will be one of the chief advantages that will result to you in ho take part in the debates of this society therefore, it is a particular pleasure to me to have been here this evening (Cheers; Cheers were given for his Excellency and the proceedings terminated
