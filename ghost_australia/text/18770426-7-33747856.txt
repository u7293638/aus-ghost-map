From a false and ultra-Protestantism and from a system which, though within the nominal pale of Pro- testantism is in spirit anti-Protestant and in real, and sometimes avowed, sympathy with Romanism— The Rationalists of Europe main- tain that they rightly interpret this liberty of private judgment when they exalt reason into into the place of God himself ; and we are pointed to them by those who oppose this liberty, and are warned that if we use it at all we shall soon find ourselves landed among the quagmires of Agnosticism,or,if not quite so far,at least high upon the bleak plateau of a sterile Theism. So that we an compelled to expound and defend what we conceive to be the essential nature of our cherished freedom And as we have hinted, be cause the perpetual war with Rome we havo in these times to face foes that have risen up within an ancient and venerable organisation that once boasted of being the bulwark of Protestantism. the leaders of the Oxford movement enunciated principles utterly antagonistic to the right of each to think for himself in the realm of religious truth, and we have their disciples even in our midst proclaiming and practising, as far as they dare, these principles Surely we have made it manifest that there is no subject on which a clear, straightforward deliverance is more called for in our day than this grand liberty. We claim the freedom of judging each for himself as to religious truth as our birthright. We conceive that we have this liberty as a right necessarily attached to our intellectual and moral nature as intelligent, free, and responsible agents; and we claim its free exercise on every ground of justice and expediency and Scripture warrant. The Scrip tares all through assume this native liberty, and expressly enjoin to legitimate use.

In rts eonee thkrwad U^rtjc.Hwtit^U-d tLegr^t formal principle of the Reformation, while its material principle was justification by faith. The Reformers themselves, however, did not apprehend the full significance and application of the great truths they proclaimed. And, indeed, centuries have been needed to diffuse any adequate knowledge of them among the various^ branches of the Protestant family —centuries that have, alas, witnessed many shameful acts of intolerance for which we blush to-day. Listen to this beautiful and just definition of our birthright from the pen of Mr. R. W. Dale. " God hat revealed himself to our race in many forma. Ituaanreaw revubUion U cen t a ii i| in the life, the death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the great controversies between Protestantism and Romanism turns on the point, whether that revelation is indeed, and of a truth, a revela tion to the human race or not.

May I? I mast. The appeal which God makes is to me—directly to me—and if priests or, bishops, or Synods, or Councils, or Popes are guilty of thrusting themselves between me and my God, I revolt agaiust their blas phemous pretensions. If I stand alone, with all Christendom against me. I will receive ai -first hand the glorious revelation of the in finite love of God." We moat, however, po a little further back than Mr. Dale, and assume merely the possi baitjrof God RMrealuig Himaelf through holy men, who and wrote under His inspira- j turn, aad the actual existence of Scriptures claiming to have been thus produced, and con taining a Revelation of the Divine Will to the human race. Then starting at whatever point of departure in our enquiry, we think best, we all come to the grand question, " What has God revealed," and demand the liberty of searching for a reply each man for himself. When we are convinced as to the subject matter of revelation, that and that only shall we profess, that and that only shall we practice. Thus we are preserved from the error that crept in among some of the early Protestants who severed the right to search from the Truth sought, and opened the way wide for every eccentricity of the intellect, every vagary of the fancy, and every freak of superstition. The subjective right of the individual was so exaggerated as to exclude the paramount claims of the objective truth. Hence statements like these: "Believe that you are saved and you, are saved.." "Be fully persuaded in your own mind, that is enough." This same error is found in modern times, popularly expressed, "Every man can think as he pleases," and systematically defended by those who exalt reason to the position of the final arbiter of all alleged truth. But it might with equal feasibility be maintained that in the region of physical science every man has a right to his own conviction, no matter how opposed to verified experience of facts. Men of science, however, who boldly rejecting all merely human authority, lay it down as the first principle of their study that absolute sub- mission must be given to facts. And, like wise, in the sphere of spiritual truth we do well to deny the right of any man or body of man to restrain us, but we are only consis tently and loyally using our liberty of research when we yield implicit faith and obedience to the Word of God when discovered. It is altogether a different thing to use our right of private judgment in reference to the fallible opinions of men from using it in regard to the Revelation of the Omniscient and Holy God. We cannot conceive of the Most High God issuing a book that he subjected to the criti cism rejection, or acceptance of a short sighted race of men, as if it had emanated from themselves. This were to act altogedier nalike himaelf, and either to descend to the level of lEa creatueea or else to lift up His creatures to His own level. While God gifts as with reason and conscience, and bestows upon na the liberty of searching into His reve lations. He demands that when His w?H in known U shall be received reverently and obeyed devoutly. So that we do not chum in connection with this liberty, the right to reject that which has been discovered as God's Word, or even the right to remain in doubt about that Word through neglecting to use the means of enquiry within own reach. The truth of God once found commands belief. And the possibility of attaining- to a know ledge of that truth stamps all uncer tainty or ignorance of it as sin—"what ever is uot of faith, is sin." Our claims and defence of this liberty is made supremelv that we may lay hold on the very Truth of God itself, and allow that very God's Truth to lay bold on us; or, in other words, that we may entwine lastingly, eternally, our convictions round the pillars of the Divine Throne, and meekly and adoringly submit ourselves to the will of Jehovah. In occupying this position we stand diame trically opposed—First, to the Priestly School. In the first rank of this school is the Roman Catholic Church. ''This singular system," says Gladstone, " receiving the Sacred Scrip tares and nominally attaching a high authority to the witness of tradition, holds both in •abjection to such construction as may be placed upon them from time to time, either by an assemblage of bishops, together with certain high functionaries, which derives its authority from the Pope, or by the Pope himself, when he thinks tit to take upon himself die office." Aud yet Dr. Manning, shortly before he was made a Cardinal, con trived to find a place in tiiis system for die right of private judgment! His theory was that the fullest and only legitimate exercise of individual judgment was to be found in the Romish communion—namely, as to everything that the Pope had not infallibly determined. Hut when it is remembered that die Pope has infallibly determined everything of permanent and spiritual value, we see what ? die fullest and only legitimate exercise" means. The bird uTfiree to roam at huge,—widrin die bare of bis cage. Both the Greek and Anglican Churches contain immense numbers who join wtth the Romish Church in asserting that the laity can only obtain certainty in the sphere of religious truth through the priesthood. In the name of our august Creator, who has made us in His own image, in die name of the Scriptures fie hath put in our hand, and in view of the judgment that each must face, we again solemnly protest against diis audacious attempt to rob us of our birthright, and icrarn the people of the land against all priestcraft, whether of die Papal or the Anglican type. S. Ciutn-k/tf School. Chiefly in die three religious communions already mentioned are die adherents of this school to be found. White accepting die Scriptures as die highest source of Truth, they teach tiiat we must re icoire as an authoratative guide the common contain and die unvarying traditions of the universal Catholic Church. But the weak ness of this school arising from divisions among dwnuwlws as to what is die Catholic Church, and dien a.s to what has been "believeth always, everywhere, and by ail," disables diem ftotn senoumj* threatening the liberty we defend. They speak mystically about a visible Catholic Church, undivided and perpetuated from the Apostles until to-day; but where this Church be^u* and where it ends, who are in it, and who are not, they find die utmost difficulty in determining. Aud how can the general consent of this Church, whatever it may be, and whenever it may, be ascertained. l**?k at the Bohn Conference iu 1874 for the ivplv- The Knglish, Russian, and German clergymen who assembled at Bohn to devise a; ba?M of Catholic and visible uniou endeavored L Christendom. Hut Dr. Dollinger and his con trives were utterly battled to get at the pure j teadtingof the early Church. Each had his Own ' v<*raiou of it, and so thtsy amicably agreed to prorogue t tneir grand scheme either till die . miik'uuiuui or until some of die fatiiers rose from die dead and corrected tiieir manuscripts! Now while thib school is. really feeble through these divisions it endeavors to make up by large pretension and parade which sensible men will very soou dispose of. But let those who arc inclined to joinjita ranks be warned, diat if they seek a visible external authority in nutters religious they will not find one here, but must go further on, after J. H. Newman, to His Holiness the Pope. For ourselves, with the living Word in our hands, and heavenly help promised, wo are content. Then, thirdly, we must also oppose the Creed school in our defence of this great liberty. Now, it may be legitimate, and sometimes expedient, for a Church to make a declaration or confession of belief. But die system of Churches formulating creeds of great subtiltyand prolixity of state ment, and ranging from the most fundamental truth to the minutest detail of doctrine, and tiieu elevating diese into a position of autitofity by enforcing subscription by die office-bearers ia a proceeding entirely opposed to die free ex ercise of die right of private judgment If you wish for evidence witness the long line of noble witnesses for diis liberty, who have been expelled from various Protestant com munions, not because their views were anti- Scriptural or anti-Christian, but primarily be cause' they departed from the authoritative Standard or Creed. They were heretics, ' merely in the sense Cardinal Cajetan, of ancient fame, attached to that word, they were persistent in choosing for themselves tlu> articles of their faith ("pertinax propria electione credendoratn.") It is encouraging to observe, both here and in Britain,a growing im patience with this state of things; and we may hope that the day will come when this afain shall be wiped away from the fair fame of Protestantism. Let all creeds with other systematic treatises on theology, and let the student in 'the pulpit,' as in the pew, enjoy die glorious right and privilege to have free and. unfettered contact widi die iusuiredire cord itself, and die gain to die cause of Trfidi wiO be immense every way. ' I need but add,in a sentence,that our position on this subject is as antagonistic to the Ration- alistic School as to the school first mentioned. The huge assumption that Reason is the final Standard and Test of all alleged truth is main- America. But, as was to be expected, Reason has given so diverse verdicts diat there are to be found among them Unitarians accepting a revelation in the Scriptures, and pure Deists who deny the possibility of a revelation, and, of course, regard the Scriptures as human compilations. We, however, start witii the Supreme authority of whatever God reveals, and only maintain our freedom to look on that with our own eyes, that we may believe it widi our own minds, love it widi oar own hearts, and incorporate it widi our own lives. "The ttibk*, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants," was the famous sentence of Chil lingworth, and it has oar hearty assentas sound Protestants, and as those who exercise their birthright have found die Truth of God, and reverently given up our souls and lives to its power. IL We now proceed to consider diis liberty in rafomnce to' Church organization and life. And it will be seen diat if diere was a fitness in oar dteme to die general condition of religion thought, diere is equal fitness in reference to certain practical questions always reappear ing in our ecclesiastical relations, without and within. Admitting that die position for which we contend is established, is it practicable in connection with association for Christian fel lowship and work f Must we not voluntarily euapend or curtail our liberty of individual judg ment, which is undoubtedly our right, if we are tn have any compacted organization as churches or religious societies? Is there any reason to fear diat due freedom will cause our Churches to resemble "ropes of sand P* Is diis liberty, in short, not a disintegrating and weakening rather than a unifying and etrengtitening agency in Church associations P Bossuet aud die Romish writers, in early Reformation times made a great point of the sectarianism and anarchy of Protestantism. The religious wars and die infinitesmal sects resulting from die Reformation were made to contrast most unfavorably widi die Church of Rome—strong in its unity. "Look," cried they, "at die lawful offspring of your boasted liberty. Am d?ey not really the unseemly spawn of impious licence P" No, we boldly reply, some of diese divisions arose from a •lew religious life findiuir expression in orga nizations and doctrine that naturally differed from each other because of the diversities of influences and circumstances moulding them in various countries; but the divisions over which we shall never cease to grieve resulted hot from the legitimate exercise of an undoubted right of freedom, hut from the defective per ception of that freedom and an unjust, limita tion of its scope. Assemblies, Synods, Coun cils, Churches, have all in turn, under the very banner of the Reformation, played the Pope, and hence the only divisions of which Protes tants need be ashamed. Centuries have been needed to diffuse the light with even moderate brightness, and during the long twilight brethren have mistaken each other for foes, and breaches not yet healed have been made. In proportion, however, as this great liberty is understood and consistently practised, instead of it being a principle of division and anarchy, it will be found to unite in the closest bonds. By the exercise of our liberty we all come under the power of the same truth, a concensus of essential doctrine is attained, and we learn to treat charitably those who differ most from us; and what other or better bonds than these do we need ? And if it is desired to draw the various sections of evangelical Protestantism more closely together, let me commend these bonds for that end. Union is for ever impossible as the basis of an elaborate and dogmatic, or even an eclectic creed, and remains to be sought in the unity of die truth itself, dis covered by a free and enlightened use of die liberty'we contend for. If it is sought thus, we may still hope that Protestantism may yet present a more unurokeu front than at present against Romanism and Infidelity. In the narrower spheres of our individual Churches it is easily shown that, correctly con ceived and logically carried out in die spirit of die truth Itsdf, tiiis liberty provides, powerful bonds of a free, cordial, aud loving union. There Ls,_^rs/, in the very freedom itself tiuf spring of a genuine spirit of comradeship. It is difficult for some to believe in any union without visible foundations and material cords; but, as has been finely said, there are stronger bonds than the outside bonda of grievous and inelastic creeds. As the minister may say to die bride, handing her the written certiiicate of marriage, " But vou have better bonds than dial to hold him by." So have we to hold each other by in thatinward and vital cohesion that stands in loyalty of free conviction and that spirit of comradeship that will not let us part, yielding blind submission to nothing, but each offering a pure allegiance to this ideal that we have no love but of die truth, no fear but of a lie." This was the real chain that bound die souls of Luther and Melancthon to ged?er,as the soulsof David and Jonathan, of old. Then, second, we find in the common truth on which we exercise our right of individual judgment a powerful unifying agency in Church fellowship. Proceeding from that God 'who is Light and Law, we would ex pect that die essential of Revelation would be luminous and orderly in the pages of the Divine word, that all who sought it without prejudice, intelligently and devoutly, would arrive at convictions identical in the heart of diem. And what is die fact? That among us diese truths are firmly believed; tiiat there is one God known to us as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that die Son became incarnate as Jesus Christ, and offered Himself in death tiiat men might receive remission of sin and participation in eternal life; that without re generation there is no salvation. The Holy Ghost convinces die world of sin, of righteous ness, and of judgment to come, and sanctifies believers through die truth, and, finally, that we are, and shall be, judged according to die deeds done in the body, good or bad. Here in this common belief resulting from free con viction, is tiiere not power to bind us together firmly and eternally ? In matters of minor moment in the spiral column of truth we may, as it were, occupy opposite points in die same circle, nut we feel we have a common centre, and we all meet at die summit, on which, in die eye of Christian faith, stand die cross, and the once crucified, but now glorified Redeemer. Would to God that a flame of enthusiasm for those gland centre truths were to spread through our Churches; then should their power to unite heart to heart in Christian bonds be felt. For tiiis is an enthusiasm infinitely superior to sectarian zeal, and a union higher and holier far than arises from agreement in sectarian teaching. *7%£r<%; it may ba said that while this is so far true, will it not be found that this freedom, when exercised in regard to trutiisof perhaps not die tirdt moment, will issue in diversity of opinions that will interfere with hearty fellowship. No doubt diere will be this diveisity, but it is still to be proved that we have in it necessarily any bar to complete Christian communion.* Far from seeing in tiiis any elements of weakness and division among those who distinguish be tween die golden and silvern truths of Revela tion, dtose essential to salvation and those on which men of equal piety may differ, -we see positive elements of strength and richness for our fellowship. Communion wididiose who see eye to eye on every particular is not specially profitable or educative in this world,' whatever it will be hi die world tiiat is to i come. We usually consider tiiat companion ship shallow and poor that exists between tiiose who are die mere echoes of each other. Only a Pope or an intolerant dogmatist would desire to see all around mere reflections of himself. Fellowship is strongest, and deepest, and richest, where there is a common spirit of freedom, common loyalty to truth, agree ment in essentials, together with such di versity of sentiment as each recognises to be the-result of independent research and free conviction. Church communion is really at its best where tiiere is common truth, for com mon avowal, and still such diversity of opinions as leaves room for healthy controversy. But, further, diis very diversity of opinion affords fine scope for die play of die divinest of all die graces—Christian charity. And what stronger bond in all die range of knowledge or sentiment than the bond of Christian love ? Where this charity exists differences of views on many points of doctrine will only call forth its power to unite in a fellowship deeper and purer dian tiiat of identical convictions. Above prophecy, above tongues, above knowledge, die Apostle placed Christian love, and only let our hearts be full of diis supreme grace, and we shall see no occasion to divide diough we may differ, or even to withdraw our countenance from a brother because he happens to hold on some points contrary views to our own. We have in die Evangelical Alliance a fine instance of real fellowship among tiiose who have diverse beliefs in certain respects. And each of ourChurchesshouldbein maturity what die Evangelical Alliance ie only in out line. None of us surely shall be so unmanly as to ignore die manhood of his brother? None of us shall be so inconsistent as to deny to his neighbor that large liberty he claims for himself P None of us shall be so void 'of charity as to let his countenance fall, or loosen die grasp of hie brotherhood towards any, because be is withstood in fair discussion by tiioae. who have die same right to exercise dieir minds and express their convictions as he has? See that our Christian love stands this test, and it will grow stronger, and afford an all ]> m-rrful chain to bind us to all who love the Lord Jesus Christ. Enough has been said to show that liberty of individual judgment is not only not adverse to Christian fellowship, but affords the best grounds in every way for a free, genuine, and lasting union among Christians, for the grand purposes of their high calling. And the history of our Churches confirms this conclusion, for wherever this liberty has been violated, there came strife and divisions, but wherever it was sacredly ob served and practised there has been " the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." Ail that we have said as to the practical re sults of the free, and fair, and Scriptural exercise of this liberty within individual Churches, may with equal truth be said in regard to the re lationship Independent Churches may sustain to each other. That Independent Church which maintains an isolated position from sister Churches is as false to its character and duties as an individual Christian who stands: aloof from his brethren in cold reserve. The very same bonds that bind us together in separate Churches should combine us into something like a union of Churches. And we have constantly to be reminded that loyalty to the Church of which we are members really involves loyalty to all sister Churches. And wlule this "liberty is fully acknowledged and practised there will be no fear that any Church or Churches will interfere with the peculiari ties of doctrine that may be developed within any other Church or Churches. Each Church, as each member of each Church, must be allowed the liberty to evolve its own particular form and detail of doctrine.- Alas ! that'-this has been forgotten in the history of our Churches—aye, even within the hist thirty five years —and grievous divisions nave, re sulted. Since then, thank God, the catholic; spirit of these lines of Pope has spread:-—' " Let not this weak unknowing band ' Presume Thy bolts to throw. And deal damnation round the land On each I judge my foe. ' If_l am right, Thy grace impart, Still in the right to stay ; If I am wrong, Oh ! teach my heart To 6nd tJie better way." ; Within individual Churches it is not until there is an actual departure from Christian faith aud life that there is any warrant! for the Church to exercise discipline, sus pend die unruly member, and in the last ex- \ tremity sorrowfully part company with him if he repents not. And, likewise, fellowship among Churches is impossible where there : has bees a similar apostacy by any of them ; i but this is altogether different from the assumption of authority to disconnect Churches from fellowship with sister Churches, because they have -departed from some traditional standard of orthodoxy. Only let truthful conceptions of our grand liberty prevail, and any overbearing inter ference of the part of any Church towards another will not only be impossible, but there will grow the same strong links of connection between Churches as we have seen naturally spring up among members of individual Churches under the same conditions. Much every way, therefore, has this grand liberty to be prized and defended against all encroachments and attacks. But, further, much every way has this grand liberty to1 be exercised earnestly, consistently, and continu ally. Hitherto we may have spoken of this liberty chiefly as a right, but we defend it as a right supremely because it is the bulwark of a duty. The Reformers, it is said, dwelt more on the duty than on the right of each man to search for and apprehend the truth for himself. In mediaeval times it was enough for a layman to accept what was put into his mouth by his priestly father. But the Re formers taught that every individual ought to find out and appropriate the truth for himself. And really the thought of individual .right in reference to this liberty is secondary, though necessary, to that of the duty of each to ex ercise his liberty. My cleaiug'worda would, therefore, poiut out the obligation resting on us all to live in the incessant exercise of our duty of discovering the truth of God for our selves. We must not merely rest satisfied with the assertion of our right without pro ceeding to die faithful discharge of the d(ity lying within it. The eery best defence of our right tojthis liberty lies in its faithful legiti mate exercise as a duty. It is here we are liable to fail; it is here that, I fear, we to a huge Ex tent do fail. This is the secret of the painful fact that with all our glorious liberty there does not exist among our Churches that desire for correct conceptions of Biblical theology that we ought to see. There is no small Me rest manifested by our young and thoughtful minds in the study of physical science, and that is to be commended, but I would like to see a greater thirst to know something of the Queen of the Sciences, the science of revealed 'trujth. Would to God that some Word of mine may excite this thirst in some minds, and I \till not have spoken in vain. . . . The following brief counsels are offered'to all of us who do thirst for Divine Truth: We ought to be persuaded that the truth of Goi is to be found, and search the Scriptures with this conviction Tjefore our minds. Amid the diversities of creeds that abound an erroneous view of this liberty may lead us to think one belief as good as another. Not so; let us put aside the broken mirrors about us, and lojok with our own eyes for the reality in the Word of God. Then we ought to he likewise fully persuaded that we can find that truth with the help of God. The ultimate ground on which our freedom rests is that each man has the capacity of finding and accepting the rudimentary truths of Revelation. Further, we must resolutely determine to set' aside all pet ideas that we may have inherited, or have resulted from mere habit. What Bacon termed idola must be thrown out Again, we must exercise earnest thought fulness if we expect to find God's trutti. The frivolous chatterer or the man that merely toys with thought may boast jof his right, but what is that worth if he does not thoughtfully discharge his duty?— only a means of condemnation. Then, again, we must have courage to set aside the opinions of the most learned and revered of the dead or living if we are convinced they are opposed to the truth of God. This may be dqne without injury to that respect due to learning and piety. And, more, loyalty to the truth attained is necessary for the highest success |in itssearch. Godisnot so lavish of truth as to flood the mind of the unworthy or the unfaithful. Truth obtained must be professed, practised, and with missionary effort diffused, if more has to be reached. Finally, all our studious search for truth should be prosecuted with a devout dependence on the Holy Spirit of God. But if, after all our research, we still find our selves crying out, with the dying Goethe, "More light, more light," we may rest assured that as they that wait for the morning so shall we be satisfied. The revolving cycles of time shall bring an hour of glorious unfolding when the Divine Sun of Truth shall rise to its zenith, and its light of many and splendid iues shall flood the vast domain, which now lies partly revealed and partly concealed in the revelations of God. Meantime— " Forward ! while the light of ages Flashes far as we can see, Brooding o'er the mystic pages Of the great world's destiny. "From a thousand voices rises The paean of a nobler year, Banning up into the crisis Of the systems that appear. "Forw&rd;! not inactive linger 'Midst the flimsy show of tilings ; Follow truth's unerring finger, Break thro* error's mazy rings. " Creeds may grow and creeds may crumble - Forward! forward! let them lie : What is false to dust shall tumble, What is true shall never die. " Break all servile bonds that bind as. Free, unfettered, walk abroad; ' ' - Soulless forms we cast behind us— ? Forward! in the light of God, The Her. J. Hotham moved a' hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman. He said it was cheering to see a young brother standing up and giving expression to sentiments which lay at the very root of their denomination. It was all very well to talk about the " divine right to do wrong," but the right to act and think freely was divine, whatever use might be made of it. (Applause.) He beli-ved their denomination had' not Always made proper use of it, but the right of private judgment was nevertheless * birth right that they would always cherish. (Ap plause.) The Rev. J. McEwnc seconded the motion, expressing his opinion that at the present time, when their most cherished theological beliefs were being shaken to the roots, it was very needful that the right of private judgment should be upheld. He was glad that Mr. Dick tad defined the limits in which this liberty should be exercised, and hod referred them to the Bible as the source of aU truth. (Applause.) The motion was carried unanimously, and the Chairman having- returned thabks^ the proceedings closed with the singing of the doxology and the pronouncing of- the benediction.
