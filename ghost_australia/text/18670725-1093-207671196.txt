The laying of , the foundation-stone, of the Roman Catholic Church at "Wallaroo Bay took place last .Sunday. A large concourse of persons assembled to ; witness the ceremony, including many from Kadina and Moonta. Mass was said .in , the wooden ,chapel in the morning. Shortly after its conclusion a little before noon, the Very Rev., J. Smyth, the Rev. Mr. Rey nolds, and the Rev. .Mi\ Kennedy issued from the chapel, and, preceded by lads habited in white and bearing holy water and the Bible, .proceeded to the western end of the site of the new edifice, where , a, wooden cross had.heen erected, and offered prayer. They then walked fo the eastern end and, standing before the foundation-stone, recited the Catholic; Litany and other forms of prayer. After this a bottle was placed in a .cavity of-the stone on which the foundation-stone . was, to rest, containing a parchment 'ifi-'-.which. • was written the facts usually inscribed, on ..such documents. .The stone., was., then;■ blessed in accordance < with the rites of. the Catholic Church, and hav ing been deposited in its place by Messrs. Kerrison and Phillips, the Rev. Mr. Smyth, touching it, with a silver trowel, pronounced it laid in. the. name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Tloly. Ghost. After some,, other formali ties had.been..observed, the "Rev. Mr- Smjdh mounted'.a; platform under a canopy, which had beep improvised, .of "canvas and pine -branches, read from the first to the llth-verses, inclusive, of the. 1st chap. .of .Malachi, and taking those portions'' of Scripture/as the basis of; his dis course, he proceeded to deliver a sermon that was characterised by .much eloquence, fervor, and impressivenessi -,Oh the. conclusion of the sermon it was , announced that, contributions would be received^ towards the building fund. Subscriptions; at once were handed in rapidly, ^nd in a short time there was collected upwards of £140. We understand that about . £250 had been previously/contributed to the fund.— Wallaroo Times. ... . r M /.;/ | A' preliminary fiieeting to take into con sideration the .best 'means to be adopted for giving-a welcome'to "the Duke of Edinburgh,' wis held at' the Cornucopia on-Monday evening.
