VICTORIA. SYMPATHY WITH BUSHRANGERS -It would appear that " bush tclographs" and nowsbearors oro not conlinod to New South Wales, it only requires a fow bushrangers to bung out thoso pests of tho interior m numboia quito us grout, ovon in Victoria, if tho following from tho Ovens and Mun at/ Adveitiiei is to bo rohod on -"lho Benalla polico havo returned lo their old quarters, nftei tho fatiguing duties of a five days unsuccessful reconnaissance over an uninhabited and unfrequented country, sonroh of lho notoi lous Power Tho Iroonors, with tho assistance of two black traekcis, pursued tho bushranger, with apparent sutcea«, until thoy nrrivod m tho noighboihood of the Strathbngio ranges In tho almost impenetrable fustnoSBOS of theso ranges tho robbcr'B trucks become faint, and suddonly disappeared alto gothor. Whilo in pursuit tho polico had occa- sion to pass through a pnddook at a pim o called Blanket Flat, whoro thoy poreoivcd somo horses m lho diBtanco On approaching tho animals it was obsorved that a saddlo had boen rccontly removod fiom tho book of ono of thom It wos quickly discovered that tho horso unsworad tho description of that recently taken from Mr McBean. At tho entronco of tho paddock tho tracks of threo horses woro plainly visible, but iurthor on tho foot-marks of only two horses could bo dotectod. On tho boundary ndor of the Sovon Crooks station being questioned us to how tho horse carno into tho paddock, ho firet denied all knowlodgo of its presence, but subse- quently admitted that two mon, ono of whom answered tho description of Power, had passod that way, and had turnod tho horso into tho paddock. Tho ridor's statomont goes a groat way to strengthen the supposition that Power is aided by associates and admirers throughout tho distnot which ho frcquonts. IN the Equity Court yostorday, soys tho Mel- bourne Age of tho 23rd instant, Mr. Justico Molesworth made an ordor ro tho will of Patrick und Msry Dolan. A motion for loavo to ap- peal to tlio Privy Counoil m ro Davis v. tho Queen was arguod, and His Honor reserved his decision. During tho proooodings two womon had been Bitting in tho court, apparently in- terested m tho arguments of tho legal gontlo tnen As soon as tho latter caso bad concludod, ono of thom, fat, not fuir, but forty, advanced up tho court to tho front of his Honor, and, ad drosBing horBolf partly to lum and partly to Mr Blair, stated that sho was a party to a suit entitled Doustorswivel v Jones, which had beon heard threo yoars ago, and was not going to havo it hoard ovor again Sho darod thom to go on with it, for sho wouldn't sit and hour their gabblo. Mr Blair ondoavorod to throw oil on her troubled tvators, by politely tolling hor that it was not in that court hor coso hud boon hoard. " Don't talk to mo, Sir," unBttorod the woman, "I supposo I know tho Couit of Kquity I doro you to go on I won't havo it 1'to writton to the Duko of Dovonslnri, und wo'll soo whothor you shall go on I won't hem it " Hore sho invited her oompanion to retiro, and with great dignity tho olfendud mutions retired to tho ontranco, where this oolomnl Xontippo gave His Honor a putting salute, and disappeared, banging tho door His Honor looked comically grave, whilo tho Court wos convulsed with luughtcr at tho exhibition. Tho poor woman evidently was not right in hor mind, and ought to bo lookod after AT tho Eohuca Police Court, on Friday, 10th ultimo, James Scott, a baker, wus charged with having uttomptod to commit suicido, by taking poison in a glass of grog at tho bar of tlio Harp und Shamrock Hotol "It wos shown," tho Ruerine Herald stotos, " that ho had boon do- tectod in tho uct of putting o poisonous diug ni a glass of spirits ho hud oidored Mr Luhoy, tho landlord of tho hotol, snatched tho bottlo containing tho poison from Ins hand, und im- mediately gavo him m custody J Io was dis charged " IHK Gipps Land Times reports - A lilian ous young scoundrel, numed Henry Matthews, an apprentice from tho Emerald-lull Orphunago, was brought up at tho Salo Pohco Court on tlio 17th instant, ohurgod with indocontly assuttlting an interesting httlo girl only four years of ago, belonging to a rospoctod family long resident m Gipps Land, Tho boy, who is sixtoon yoars of ago, whon taxed with tho oflenco, admittod it, and was soundly thrashod by tho fothor of tho child, and then handed over to tbo custody of tho polico.
