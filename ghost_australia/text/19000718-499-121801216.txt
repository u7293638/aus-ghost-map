Ward was already in splendid condition, having just come from his West-country tour,:lnoldents..ot which wo described In thu last chapter. ? . ? ''?.' ' : '...-*'?. ' .The battlo was fixed 'to come oft at Moul spy Hiirst, on November 11, 182a. Wo'shall not, however, 'take our readera.over the.ott-. trodden ground, but brlolly deucrlbo how tho Black Diamond mot with his first and only reverse, or we shall be devoting too .much ; space to the description of Join Ward's many' contests. ....'. ; Thero woro slight odds on Ward, but a groat- number of tho knowing ones stucK lirmly 'to -Josh Hudson, for ho had fought twenty, times, won, thirteen battles, ' and I lost seven, and they w.oro to some of tho best. mon. 'of the day, via., Bowon, Martin, Tom Spring, Aby Belasco (twice), Turner, arid Shclton: In any case he had had much riioro experience in the ring than Jem Ward,- so llttlb' Wonder ho was fancied by many. That /they wero justified in their lUncy for. Hudson even t3 proved, for al though during the first nine or ten rounds Ward:Scorod heavily, and tho betting was. '- to l.bn tho Diamond, a. change camo o'er the scene in the. eleventh round, and just as Jem seemed to be having it all his own way, by . ?. . . , ; .'? . ? ' ONE OF THOSE MIRACULOUS EFFORTS noticeable In all Hudson's hardest battles, he pulled himself together. Here Is a des cription of the eleventh round: 'Josh came 'to scratch looking as It' ho had taken quite a frosh lease of life. But. Jom's science ami agility were too much for him. Ward kept retreating and pinking. Josh about tho head at pleasure, .and with the greatest ease, as the latter. advanced. . The Black Diamond appeared to be having it all his own way, y/hen his vigor seemed suddenly to leave him, and ho was caught napping; for Josh put in a terrific left-hander under. Jem's left oyo,1 which closed, or appeared to close, ?that .optic Instantly, and almost knocked Ward's head off his shoulders. For tho moment the Diamond was all abroad quits silly and dizzy — and hit at random blow -'for -blow, till Josh floored him.' Tiio shouting for Hudson after this last exploit was awful.' By all accounts there was something wrong with Jem W.-.rd from this moment, and although Josh was fearfully punished, and as weak as 'tho proverbial rat, he man aged to come up for Jour- moro rounds, and gain all tbo best of It. and in the fifteenth Tom Spring aud Aby Belacso, who actcd.as seconds for 'Jem, had to assist him to the scratch, amidst shouts of 'Take him away —ho4!! done— don't hit him, Josh.' It wan all over; Spring threw up the sponge, and Mr.: Gully, who was referee, declared Josh Hudson tho winner. It was a terrible disappointment to Ward's friends and a bitter one for Jem himself. All kinds of reasons were given for the break-down, but Jem Ward many yoar3 afterwards informed a friend in the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum that, although ho looked well, ho was suffering from de bility, and. his strength died gradually away towards tho close ot tho light. No doubt that was the reason,, but not every ..body believed It, as was proved two days after.. tho battle, by a mrat displeasing in cident taking place. . ' ' , Thero was a meeting at Peter Crawley's bonpflt at the Fives Court, on November .13, 1825. During tho evening Josh Hudson, whoso head was bound up, and whoso FACE WAS THE COLOR OF A RAINBOW, put in an appearance, and the M.C, old Paddlngton Jcnes, Informed the company that Josh had something of importance to impart to thorn. Ho ascended the plat form, and delivered hlm3olt of tho follow ing:— 'Gentlemen, I have been informed by JOSH JIUDSOX. ' . : . Mr. Egan that Shelton has mado an asser tion that Ward received £1OT to lose the battle with me. 1 will bet anybody £5U to i:i that ho doea not provo it. -'('Bravo, Josh'!') I will also fig-at Tom Sholt'on for any sum from £25 to £200, when the time ?ho Is 'bound over expires. If Ward Is in the Court let- him come forward and answer the charge brought against him.' Tom Shelton then auccuded the stage and de7 ciarcd that Ben Burn had made tho state ment, and that. he would have no moro to do 'wl'.h it. At this moment Jem Ward -appeared upon the scene; anil said, amidst greait appl-au'so: 'I' publicly assert that no individual -whatever offered mo a slnjlu l'ar :th!ng to lose tho battle.' Josh Hudson 'came forward and shook Jem heartily by the hand, saying: 'It's all a d ? A lie, Jem, and nobody but a ? fool would be lieve It.' T.heu, turning to Uon Burn, ho offered to fight him any ilnic £100 to .CUD. Burn, -.who washi liquor, 'tried to speak, but the audience would not pormlt him, ami' Jem Ward was' unanimously acquitted or the vile charge brought against him. , Although Jem had Io3t much money for his backers. Sir Bclllugimm Graham be lieved In him to such an extent that ho placed a sum of money in Pierce 'Egan's -'haads,.. with 'Instructions that Ward should havo paid to him tha sum ot £2 every week; so, after all, Jem's llrst and only de feat was. attended by one pleasant clrcum jStaucc. ???' '.'.': ? And now lotus take a survey over tho heads of tho heavy weights, ami reckon ?who then before tho public woro entitled to aspiro to the. Championship. To begin witli, thero. was Tom Spring, who had held. ?tho honor for a considerable time, but who, it. was -rumored, was about to give It up, iand; declared that.;ho did not care I' '..'AGAIN TO ENTER THE LISTS. Then tliero worn only tho following to namu 'but of' tho' whole army of pugilist!!: Tom Shelton, Josh Hudson, Peter Crawloy, Tom Gaynor, Jack ' T/ingan, Tom Cannon, Ncfl No-ale, .White-Haired Bob, and Phil Samp-' eon. Jem-Ward, to he sure, was thought ?eligible by some ot his East End frlonds; but what had ho dono to class him amongst thosb whose iiaines we havo just given? ; He had certainly only met third-rate mon, anil/his draw with Abbott and his dofoat by Josh Hudson wero both affairs which told against him.- Still Ills magnificent display of science at the Fives Court, and hl3 fine physiquo convinced the knowing ones that he .was. the coming man. Why, there hadn't been such a scientific boxer since .Jem Bel cher, and this oven Tom Spring was bound ?to admit. So there wero but three who woro 'considered to havo but a^ghost of a chance against the Black Diamond, and they wcro Tom Shelton, Petor Crawloy, and Jack Ijan gan, and neither of these seemed anxious to try conclusions, with Ward. Ail, this period, howovor. Phil Sampson had been bragging and'blusterlhg, declaring H ;what he. could do, although he had only- -M just got over tho .disgraceful business wltn'':i S Josh Hudson, when ho did not appear at the H ring-side, and forfoitcd to 'John Bull.'' S Tho frlonds of Ward heard of ? it, and at ' M onco throw down the gauntlet to Sampson. H And so articles were signed at Tom Bel- V oher's, oh: Saturday; May 23, to tho effect ? H that James Ward, of Bow, and Philip Samp- H soii, of Birmingham, agreed : to fight /for M £100'a-sldo, within flvo and twenty mllC3 :-H of London, on Juno 21, 1S2-1. . iH ' ? T-horo' was not -a great deal of Interest . -? taken In tho match, from the fact that - :H Phil Sampson wa3 looked upon as most un- '? trustworthy, and It is marvellous to find . '-? how Iho Brums stuck to him through. thick ;? and thin, for never was tliero n more un- ' W reliable man to bo found In tho annals of ,B tho Ring. So checkered, indeed, were his ' W pertormancesf that oven tlioso who knew . ? how good he was at his best, retrainad'from .' fl following him. -Sometimes he , fought so . J ?brilliantly that It seemed ns It it wore easy M for him lo become Champion In Spring's ' ;. ? ,? place, but at other times his performances. . ? STAMPED HIM AS ROGUE OR CUR.; ; ' ? ???'? ,'For' instance, hl3 displays with Hall and v' '? .; ;a Abbott .were' enough to condemn any man. : ? He pormltte.1 himiiblf to be beaten in both. ;. :? battles, without making the slightest at- . ;?;? tempt to wia. For nlnoty-nino minutes ho . ? '' !

Hall w'aa polished off in two '.'. M rounds. That was in-and-out Ughtlug'with ' : M a vonacr.-ncc. No wonder, then, Master.;.. '? Phil Sampsun was hot supported to a great' ? 1 extent. Then, again, his last match with. - ? Josh Hudson, which foil through at. tho ,'; -.??? eleventh hour, made people fear that it'' . -? they did sui:porc him he would not .turn up ! j at ail. ?
