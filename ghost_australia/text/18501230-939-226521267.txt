The Senator will anil about the Sth ; the Nelson "tl the 1 0 lit ; the Northumberland on the 12ih. ami ilie Stcbonhcith, and Lyiander on the 25lh January. The fi re ship R idticy arrive 1 here on Sit- urday in ballast, and proceeds at once to load for I, tn.Inn ; we believe her cargo is nearly all ready for her, consequently she will ltave quick despatch, Tt-stimomtr. to Caitain M'Ki'.rme or tub Northumberland.— We under stand that ihe cabin passengers by the U«t voyage of the Northumberland, on Friday, invited Crptain MKerlie anil his Officer-- to a pic nic on the Salt Water ltiver. Tile Immediate object of the sprcal was to tike the opportunity of presenting to Captain M Kerlie a Silver Cup, hearing the following Inscription " Presented to Captain John M'Kerlie, of the ship Northumberland, by hie Cabin Passengers, in token of their esteem for his uniform kindnois and atten tion during their voyage from England to Adelaide and Melbourne, 1850." Although the thermom ler was high, we learn that it did not exceed the kindly feeling displayed towards Captain M'Kerlie by bis Into gu -sts. The Captain had delivered to him soma sincere expressions for his welfare and happiness, and responded to them with that appropiiutu gool tisto which ever influences Cipt. M'Kerlie. We believe the Nuithurri- berland on her return voyuge takes some o our oldest inhabitants, and wo have only to wish them God speed. Tho Riven was lo sail from Lounceston for Meibou.-no on the 20th ins!, and the schooner Cayuga oa the 27th itist.

J A fine three-masted schooner, the Swift, was launched nt Ritherhitho yesterday, All her masts and yards were aloft, and her sails were bent, when she left the stocks, nnd after anchoring for about nn hour, she sailed up to Lumceston, bringing up tho persons who went down in the Shnmroek to sec the I much. The Swift measures ISO tons O M, and 129 N M, dr.uvs eight feet six inches wilt' ii loaded, and will he put in the Victoria Lin le; she will be commanded by Captain Irving — Ibid Dec IS. In our last we noticed the launch of a neat schooner, the Swift, built by Mr R G Gib bons. Since then nn inspection ol the ves t-el, enables us to recommend her to pub- ile survey. She is really a splendid craft and does infinite credit to the builder and owners. No expense hns been spared in fitting or storing, and the Swift wiltrcrtaiuli be highly spoken of by the good folks of Victoria. She was brought up the river immediately on being launched, under very light canvass, nnd her good sailing qualities were manifested by the manner iu which she passed through soma of tho different reaches of the Tamar.— Ibid Dec 21.
