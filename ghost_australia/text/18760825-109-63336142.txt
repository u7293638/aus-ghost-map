A MUSICAL GHOST. T'o Aro, Neir Zealund, ins beeon visited Iately by a musical ghost (says' theWellington Post). The residents in a certain house which need not be, specified gradually became aware that at7 irregular intervals, but especiallyl during the nights, strains of unearthly music, soft mid ghostly in charactor. iprpceeded from the family pianoforte. At first it was taken for granted that of course it must be the work of that evil genius in all servanlt-keeping establishments-the cat. By degrees, howI'evbr, it was impossible to associato those weird strains with the pruncilng tf puss upon the keys, and it was still more difficult to understand how that domestic anitmmal could open the instru mnent, nexecute an unearthly fimtasia, close the lid, and vanish directly any one entered the room, as must have 'been the caise, for immediately thile door opened the music ceased, anid tile piano invariably was found shut.,. At Iint Mr. Paterfamilias resolved to solve tihe mystery, anid remained on guamrdm, keep ing strict silence, and. closely watching the open key-board. 'At'last the usual m" fairy like music" was wafted from the instrument, :althoughl. no mortal or feline performer touched the keys I Horror seized him, and lihe fled ! Clearly time pianoforte wits a medium used by some. uinquiet spirit hIumnthig the 'promises, and tie family resolved at once to quit the unhallowed spot. Daylight, however.'inispired them with boldness to look inside the piano. where some very lively.young mice were found exercising thleirilhinibs Oi the wires.
