THOMAS JARVIS INTERVIEWED.* ,On Thursday afternoon, our representa tive made bis way to the bumble home -of Mr Thomas Jarvis, 45 Crown -lane, vHltimo; He was-disb6vered hursiojr a two year-old baby? and bis face declared tiim to be one' of the 'happiest men in Sydnoy.* He was up atfdi«bout and able to answer the k«ock at the door. Although paie and Desiring istill th*6 ?tnftrks of a critical illnees', and a' period of pain, it was very clear ttiat he was ah invalid on the -rapid road* to convalescence. Imreply to-'.the preliminary questions, he said.: ?' You want to know all about my case ?' -Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. Tbe facts jh ay be of value to those who are stricken as I- was.' *? How long were you suffering ?'' ' Well, twelve months ago I got so bad that I bad -to leave off work, and I have done nothing since then. About five years *go, next Christmas, I 'met with an acci dent ; I was badly, scalded while taking a oatn in rut street, Sydney. Since tlie acci dent I have been in failing hea'tU, and after ,tour years of gradual development ot the malady, I was forced to give up my. billet at tbe Glebe Island.' ' What were the symptoms?' , ; 'Simply indescribable. The pains were ^ometbju? terrible. They were just about dl inuchas,I coald bear. They were for as the world like as ifasaw were cutting njy boaes in two in every part of me. . I bad no control over any bowels or bladder, and was* nuisance to myself and everyone else. I was incessantly shivering and shaking, and could neither eat nor sleep. On the 23rd March last I saw a well-known doctor and he told me , that my case was utterly hopeless. However, he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable Institutions.' .. ??'?-., ? . - ? ' Did you make U6e of. the order.?'!..*, ., 'No; L canie.liome , and went to J}0f ana have been pretty well in bed ever since. Five tveeks.aeo I could not walk across the floor ; in fact, I could not get out of bed. I felt then that it was all over with me. and only a question of days when I wonld {five up the ghost JSIy doctor wa6 attending me, and did all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was under him for five or six weeks. He came to the conclusion that I was suffering from Locotnotor ataxia, or Progressive locomotor atax3% a disease of ; tbe spinal cord, characterised by peculiar. di8turbauces of gait, and difficulty in co ordinating voluntary movements. He told roe that I might last tor ten years, ana that I might never get the use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his legs about with energy to show that medical opinion is not infallible) Well, just as a drown ing man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by the advertisement describing tbe cure effected in the case of another boiler-maker in England, which I read in the ' Australian Workman,' by Dr Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, I read in the advertisement of a case which seemed to fit my own. I determined to give the Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent fora box. The effect was as marvel lous as it wa6 magical. I was able to eat and sleep as though nothiue was the matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest I had for many a day. Jt was incredible. I immediately lelt the bed and was able to move about. I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills during the past /our weeks, and am now taking the fifth box. I can walk about with the aid of, a t tick, jand am gradually, but surely, recover ing my former vigor and vitality. . You see those crutches there ? They are perfectly new, and I have never used them. They were ^nade for me before I got the Pink Pills, but I was too wealc to use them, and now I don't want them. All I want is this stick, and I nope soon to do without it. You see I , am rapidly regaining my strengtu. ,_ ' ' He is 100 per cent better,' said Mrs Jarvis, wbo bad come in. ajid taken ' the baby on her knees. 'The Pink Pills have saved his life, and made another man of him.' A friend,' who called in* 'at '''this 'point, said that Jarvig looked ten years younger that day than he did a fortnight pre viously. '''' ?;'.'' 'T^an now,' continued Jarvis, 'have a cbid'Tiath, and all the feelibg has come haefc^n my lees: If I keep on^goinff tbe Way X -nliy L llUJJc iu uc bu-c iu irauuig wum as a boiler-maker, and you know I have to be in the^very pink of health and strength to worfc^t that irade., I am better to-day thamlhave been at any time during the past five years. I ascribe all the change and i-eDefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved 'jnV'life I am in no pain now, whatever, i*od *feei like a new man. On the mantelpiece th«re is a box ot opram and morphia pills- which the doctor gave me to -deaden the excruciating pain. But they^ctn stay where, they are, ior I ; no longer ueed them.

Farmers' Arms Hotel, was preparing a duckling, pur chased from Mr Smith, a local resi dent, for the table, when she found a quantity of coarse gold (nearly half a pen n}' weight) in the bird's gizzard. The duck was bread and reared on Mrs Smith's farm, on the Hughe's Creek, and there is much speculation as to precise locality whence it ob tained its golden treasure. The Acting Gov^ramnefc Statist, Mr J. J. Feoton, hi»8 cancelled the registration of Mt . Q- T. Jones' house a3 a place of public wor ship.
