THE MELBOURNE REVIEW.* ? The publication of the Melbourne Review for October has been delayed fora fortnight, owing to a circumstance which is not likely to elevate it in public estimation. Mr Lang- ton was requested by the committee to write »n article on the new loan Ho did bo, it appears, and when the article was in type it was decided to omit it, because it touched upon party politics, although, how this was to be avoided, where such a ques- tion had to be treated of, it is very hard to Bee Be tina as it may, the article was excluded, and has since been published as a pamphlet We need scarcely remark that those English periodicals upon which the Melbourne Review professes to be modelled-namely, the Fortnightly, tho Con tempo) ary, and the nineteenth Century-dis CU88 party politics in avery pronounced and earnest fashion, the two last-named publica- tions allowingmenof the most oppositoviews to meet in tourney, and to carry on an ardent rontcBt in their columns Now, unless the Melbourne Renew is to be conducted upon similar principles, the sooner it gives up the ghost the better If its pages are to contain nothing like independent criticism of the tovernment of the day, and if the men who happen to be in power are to exercise some kind of indirect censorship over the contents of the magazine, no writer of ability who poBBesses the BliLutcst «eli respect will con tinue to contribute to it '.Ihfi firet paper in »i"c present number is a memoir of the late Dr Lang, by Mr An¿us Mackay, who, believing that the history of, the perfcrvid Scot whoso biography he writes " is part and parcel of the history of tire Australian colonies, favours us with copious and no doubt accurate details of the leading incidents in the career of that promi nent politician and missionary divine It was a career, remarks Mr Mackay, "distin guished by extraordinary energy, dauntless courage, and indomitable perseverance, com- bined with very high intellectual endow mente, and devoted to the carrying out of good, and wise, and great public objects The question debated by the writer of an essay on the state school teacher is how far the separation of the pedagogue art from the clerical has followed the rule invariably ex- hibited in other specialisations, namely, that of increased efficiency And contending that it has produced this result, the writer cites what was done by the late Mr Geddie Pearse in Daylesford, and asserts that a similar task is being daily attempted in hundreds of Vic- torian schools. In conclusion, we are told that "the work of moral instruction is being as well carried out under our stuctly Bccular system as the work of religious instruction is being carried out m the churches and the bulk of the people are now so well satisfied of this, that unless the clergy and their organs cease their clamour against the good work notoriously being done m large towns and in out of the way bush hamlets, the respect and support accorded from traditional usage to the pastoral office will be withdrawn, and given to the class which is really furthering the Bprcad of cn lightenment " Shakspeare s knowledge of the classics is discussed in a painstaking article by Mi S St John Topp, who ar¿ues that the dramatist was "probably able to speak and write Latin fluently, but that his ' knowledge of Greek waB of the most elementary kind, and that, therefore, Ins acquaintance with the Greek authors waa entirely derived from translations But are there not just as good grounds for assuming that his knowledge of the Latin writers was similarly acquired' Betw een 1550 and 1G10, as Dr Drake has remarked, "all the great lnstonaiiB of Greece and Rome had been, j cither wholly or in part, familiarised in oui language, and we know that Shakspeare borrowed largely from Sir Thomas Norths translation of PlutaicJi in " Conolanus,' " Julius Cesar,' and "Anthony and Cleo patra," and transformed North s prose into blank verse, after the following almost literal method Sir Thomas wntes -"The house of the Martians at Rome was of the number of the Patricians, out of the which have Bprung many noble personages, whereof Aneus Martius was one, King Numa's daughter s son, who w as King of Rome after TullusHostilius 'Hiedramatist in "Corio laniiB 'says - " How younfcly ho bcsrui to servo lils cnuntiy How long, continued and vi huL stock he springs of 'J ho noble hotlso o tho Mnrcmis from vv hence callie That Aneus Jlnrtltis Nimm s dallghtcr'ä son, Who after treat ilostilius here vv as kin^, Ac North, speaking of 200 of the noblest mon of Rome having been condemned to sullei death, adds, ' and among that number Cicero was one' In "Julius Cc3ar Shakespear writes-" By their proscriptions, Cicero being one " In fact, not« lthstanding the ingenious ease made out by Mr Topp, we cannot help thinking that Warton was right when he described North s l'lutai ch as Shakspeare s "storehouse of learned history Mr R Murray Smith has been breaking a butterfly on the wheel by demolishing Mr Mirams flimsy and foolish article on paper money in the pievious number of the Review The present position of affairs, and the causes which have led to it, are tersely Bet forth m the following passage - " The savings of the population do not keep pace with its wants, und this is the actual cause of the depression from vv Inch we aro Bullering M'e have spent too much, and made too little, we have eaten and drunk and clothed ourselves too extiavagantly , our harvest baa been deficient, our wool clip has fallen shoit of oui calculations, our capital has partly through financial, paitly through political causes, been diverted to other colonies M e have spent most of the money which we borrowed fromLnejand, and while we are feeling the pressure of payment of m terest, we are pursuing an unprofitable and wastelul sy stem of lui mee, All these causes are at work to produce the depression which is very apparent, bul which has no more to do with a lack ol currency than with a lack of printers ink and paper As to the proposition to rehev e our financial depression, by plunging the colony more deeply into debt, Mr Smith pionounces it to be a most dangerous delusion, and he adda - " I can conceive no statement more likely to damage our credit than o le vv Inch vv ould lead the British capitalist to suppose that vv caro seeking to cover the cffccts'of financial " travagance and misfortune, rather than m tending to dev e op the resources of the country All thisborrovvingm.ifrightly undci stood, mortgaging the national estate It may-indeed, it will-at cadi successive operation give us temporary relief, just us an individual finds relict by clearing off Ins outstanding debts by a fixed loan, but it is equally true with a nation as with an indi vidual, that, unless tho money he borrows is profitably used, or his means of repa) ing the loan are improved, the process, on each repetition, leaves lum weaker and less pros perous than before, and tonds to, if it does not arrive at, ultimate ruin.

Imagine, further, the temptation to succeeding Governments, the îasue of one batch of notes after another, the belief en gendered in the minds of the people that tbey can 'create wealth by the acknovv ledfcment of indebtedness, without any intention of payment, and we shall conceive a result more fatal to national prosperity than a costly war or a wide spread conflagration Faeilis datcensus Averno-the downward path would be easy until the pressure on productive industry became intolerable Then Victoria would have to retrace her steps, would have to learn bitterly tho elementary truths of financial science-m poverty and pressure- whilst the inconv ertible notes would be dedicated to the same parpoBe which J liornas Moore predicted ior those of the Bank of England m his " The Melbourne Itcvicw for October Melbourne .
