Your Beart and Mine. WA sometimes sigh ava we can't tell why, | And we sometimes laugh at our care. We ave sometimes sad woen the world is i .. «lad, . . . . j And we wael) when the enies are fair. j Thsresau imderflow to ttB joy and woe i That pomes with a touoh divine, j In the pleasure and pain, the sunshine and rain. ! That steats into your hvart and mine, i There are phantom hosts of dead hope's j ghost*, j And the coho of funeral bells ; There's the lasting bli«« of a fadeles kiss i And th* pleasure our dream foretells. j There the hopes entombed and th« joys un- j bloomed ( Their lUieti «nd ivy entwine, And no one knows of the thorn and the rose ; That are hidden in your heart and mice.
