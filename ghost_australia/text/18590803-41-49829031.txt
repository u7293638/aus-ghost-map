TO THE EDITOR OF TUB RBQI8TBB. Sir — The laziness of the citiwus of Adelaide, and of tho population of South Australia in general, in preparing themselves to resist as England takes part in the European war, is a matter of great astonishment to me. They are culpably slow, as they will discover to their1 cost. We should by this time have several regiments of volunteers ready to take anna, when required. South Australians are fond of their some times hard-earned money, and it is quite right they should be ; but, if they do not look sharp, they may before long have only the ghost of it to comfort them. South Australians are continually muting ihdr loyalty their boast. What does it cooaut )f? Nothing but talk. They should not waste ;ime in useless disputations, but be up and Joing. ^ Hoping you will find a corner for the above* I am, Sir, Ao., T. E. N. Adelaide, August 2, 1859. lKDEPBHDBNTOBDEE0PEE0HABITB8»S&rTK; Australia.— At % meeting uf tbe Southern St»T«nt of I hii Order, en Monday evening last, in the Tent-room, Brown- street, the subject of farming a diitiiet in this calony waa brought forward and discussed.
