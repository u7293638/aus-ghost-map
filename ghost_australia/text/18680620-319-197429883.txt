The political ardor of the little man couldn't be kept - long corked up, so he name ?out with a programme ; and proclaimed as the1 triple] items . of his creedv that every Vio iorian citizen should have ''a vote,, a farm, and a rifle.!' In this Mr Mooney wasn't far wrong, all three being good things , if ; well used ; but , when expatriated rebels begin, to ialk .about : ;. rifle3,: the memory^ goes back ^to pikes. and; ; r vitriol, and the suggestion. of Mr ,. Mooney fell very flat on Tictorian ieara^ , Tfie enterprising Mooney went to work and was* J 'clever enough. to build without any money whatever what 'he' called the 'National,' now the 'Excelsior,' Hotel in Bourke-street,' as well as the outer shell -of that which is at .present the Princess Theatre.: So goon as pecuniary difficulties thickened a little around, he, like some other distinguished persons (literary, and :i other) i ? tshook the Victorian, dust from off the .soles of iis brogues, and sought ; fresh fields for his 'abilities. The next that was heard of Thoma3 waatBat he had returned . to. hig i old trade of . taking biscuits, and', hating England— this time in California; Years have rolled by, and iaow Mooney turns up in' a new character..

Mr 'Mooney is also president of the Builders' Insurance Co., whose annual receipts; are shown (on paper); to be 182,000 dollars, whose dividends oru 2 par cent, per month, and whioh adopts the system of making the .bookkeeper swear to the accuracy'©!, the accounts in open meeting of the proprietors. , (The last isn't a bad idea.)
