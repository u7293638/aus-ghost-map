A Ghostly Society. London is to have one more intellectual society â€” the new one to be devoted to the promotion of psy chological research. The members are to recount their dreams and the effect of them retrbspectively or prospectively, what communications in their time they may have received from the other world through supernatural agents, ghostly or otherwise. The con ditions and qualifications of membership are not too exacting ; men with the weakest possible intellect will be freely enrolled and 'no questions asked.' But thejr must believe in ghosts and apparitions, ex tend their mental vision beyond the boundary lines of this contemptible little globe, and thus in their day and generation add to the sum of human knowledge and research in an unexplored region which, up to the present, like the North Pole, resolutely refuses to reveal itself to human ken and become the sub ject of human investigation.
