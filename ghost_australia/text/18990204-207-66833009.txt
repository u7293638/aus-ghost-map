NO EXPLANATION NEEDED. " I'm not saying whether the spirits of the departed reappear il the flesh," declared the venerable visitor. " but I will vouch for this chapter from my exyperience: " Miy father was an independent thinker and a spiritualist. As a boy I was just as unhampered in my reading as he, and laughed at the idea of any one returning from beyond the grave. After trying long and hard to convert me to his views, he lost his temper and said that at t some time I would have an awakening such as ? could never for get. One night I returned home from a hard-cider party andl lipped my boots off at the door so as to reach my room as quietly as possible. Once there I was startled by the presence of a white figure that seemed eight feet tall. In a sepulchral voice and slow, tone I was arraigned for scepticism, charged with untilial obstinacy, and threatened with condign punishment if I not heed the teach ings of my father. " Natural boldness being stimulated by hard cider, I rallied, called the ghost an old foul and a burglar. told it that I wanted to go to bed, and served notice that it must vanish or I would begin breakiog chairs over it. Suddenly there was a mix-up. I seemed enveloped in a suffocating cloud of white. I kicked, bit. struck and wriggled while I seemed to be tossing about in the arms of a windmill. Then there was a rush, an execration, and all was still. I said nothing of the affair forfiar it would furnish my father with more arguments. ile did not leave the room for several days. Then there was a patch over his eye and his nose was peeled. I offer no explanation, but the story is atrue one."
