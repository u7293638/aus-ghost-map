LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) London, August 13. Afraid you’ll find me uncommon dull this week cooped up with one of my periodical penances, consequent on sleeping with all the windows open — Not always dull? So good of you, I do get there sometimes, don’t I? But you see it was not only the windows, but the — no — not a word about the — weather. * * * * I’ve not troubled you about war matters lately. Everything’s been so flabby, and when there is anything lively, you get it by cable. It’s quite exhilarating to hear you are to have a commis- sion of inquiry, that your helmets are made of paper and glue — and that your officers — absolu- tely are jealous and quarrel. * * * * Fancy! Jealous and quarrelling in the Service. Bless me I never heard of such a thing. * * * * When one lies in bed and feels sick to death, the one thing to do is to lock the door on the world and all that in there is — and read. * * * * That’s what I did, Monday and Tuesday — Among other books, I tackled for the second time Steevens’s “To Khartoum with Kitchener,” A glorious pride of race, heart-stirring, chronicle of brave men and brave deeds — I forgot I was ill, and felt real glad to be just alive. * * * * What pluck, what resolution, what perseve- rance, what years of work, what bravery, How the prestige of the Empire was preserved. How Gordon was avenged. Not by hysterical ap- peals to a Supreme Power, but by work. Solid hard work, by pickaxe and spade — by devotion to duty, and the sacrifice of most things that make life pleasant. * * * * How evanescent is this thing called glory. To morrow — no, Sunday — will be the second anni- versary of the Battle of Omdurman. * * * * They say South Africa is the burying ground of great reputations. I believe it. Only two years and General Gatacre, one of the brightest and bravest of that bright brave band is “Recalled.” Of course he made a great mistake. But only think. The pity on’t. In his hour of trial, his years of brilliant service could not save him. * * * * Now, where is Hunter? One never hears of him. And Macdonald, the greatest fighter of them all? They seem to have gone under. * * * * Even Kitchener’s armor must be tarnished, for Mr. Bennet-Burleigh the other day called at- tention to the fact that certain people found fighting the Boers was not exactly the same thing as mowing down, with the finest weapons of precision, thousands of half-naked fanatics. * * * * That’s all very well; but given the fanatics not being mowed down — what price Mr. Bennet Burleigh and the British taxpayer then. I don’t like to see little dogs yapping at a big lion’s heels. * * * * We’ve got a puppy and a mastiff. The puppy runs after the mastiff and barks a little sharp, shrill, aggravating bark. When the mastiff looks round, the puppy turns head over heels and sits up and grins. That’s how I know the pup’s a mongrel. * * * * I told you I was going to be dull. * * * * We’re in the thick of it, “Return of Sir Char- les Warren” “Spion Kop Disaster,” “Sir Charles’s Defence.” * * * * Sir Charles says it was Buller’s fault — Buller, like Brer Rabbit, says “nuffin’ ” and lies low. * * * * Sir Charles Warren contends that his plans were successfully developing, and the Boers al- ready commencing to withdraw their guns and , waggons, when Colonel Thorneycroft was, with- out his knowledge or consent, placed in command on the top of Spion Kop, and the abandonment of that position decided upon. * * * * “A Looker On,” from the Boer side, says: Ar- rived at the summit. General Woodgate commit- l ted the same blunder Sir George Colley made at Majuba Hill nineteen years before. He occupied the geographical instead of the military crest of the hill. It is one of the elementary rules of tactics that where a hill has a top, a short dip, and then a long steep descent, the crest com- manding the long approach is that to be occupied by the defending force. * * * * Why even my feminine intellect is equal to that. * * * * By neglecting this crest on the night of Febru- ary 26, 1881, General Colley allowed Nicolaas Smit with seventy men to advance under its cover and to attack him from its rim on the morning of the 27th. By neglecting an exactly similar crest on the night of January 23, 1900, General Woodgate allowed Sarel Oosthuizen with forty men of the Krugersdorp commando to climb up under its cover and to attack him from its rim on the morning of the 24th. * * * * Leaving out the question whose fault it was, it seems Spion Kop was wholly untenable. The point of a triangle whose sides were held in force by the Boers. * * * * “Did you see last week’s “King?” — “Airey’s Bushmen Crossing the Veldt.” * * * * As to the Chinese business, nobody knows noth- ing about anything. It is all Tungs and Lis (such lies !) — Tung this and Tung that. Everybody gives up trying to understand. Talk about a Chinese puzzle, this takes the gateau: One thing I’m sure you’ll be pleased to get at, and that is the real name of the Chinese Empress — “The Daugh- ter of the Sun.” * * * * Though when one comes to think of it, most daughters are daughters of sons. * * * * Away with such frivolity — the name’s the thing. Here it is: “Tzu-hsi-tuan-yu-kang-i-chao-yu- chuang - cheng - shou-kung-chin-hsien-chung- hsi.” * * * * Not so unnamable after all. Cut off the first consonant ot the first two syllables. Result: “Tusi” — see? “Tusie,” “Toosie,” “Oozy — ou.” * * * * Ah! But I’ve struck another. Sir Edwin Arnold has just received a sort of Siamese — twins? Oh, no — nothing like it — a sort of Siamese Order of the Garter (“Honi soi,” you know), accompanied by his Majesty’s autograph — “Somdetch Phra Para- mindr Maha Chulalongkorn, Phra Chula Chom Klao, King of Siam.” * * * * This is where I think a pretty typewriter might come in and mitigate his Majesty of Siam’s suf- ferings. * * * * The fuss about the Waldersee appointment has caught on in the States — no end of fun. The “New York Times” is actually satirical. Says the General, like the Scriptural geegee, smelleth the battle afar off— too far off; that if he don’t hurry up he’ll lose the procession. * * * * Fancy! He actually set out in “The Second to None’s” old uniform. Sounds like William Schwenk Gilbert, don’t it? Lines to be set in music. * * * * THE FIELD MARSHAL’S LAMENT. My Royal master’s uniform I don with veneration, But still it causes me to wish I had less corporation. My heart is filled with pride since in A king’s old pants I’m sitting, And yet I’m apprehensive, for I feel the back seam splitting. The Royal boot I’m proud to wear. My joy with anguish mixes — My corns remind me “nine’s” my size, While his are more like sixes. Dressed in this regal garb I vow To give the foes a beating; Retire I dare not—these clothes are Too tight for quick retreating. * * * * William Second to None, is writing a book, and must not be disturbed. Irrevent ones say it is to replace the Bible. * * * * Everybody that’s anybody — and vice versa — has gone to the sea, or Germany. I, being nobody, stay at home. Should have gone to Torquay re- gatta though if I’d not opened those windows so wide last week. * * * * H.R.H. is at Homburg, having a nice quiet time. People are so used to him, and he don’t get mob- bed. His Highness goes in for a regular cure and a reduced waist — drinks the waters at 7 a.m., takes a walk, comes back and listens to the music, which commences at 7.30. Band good, but as a friend writes “lugubrious” — “As Once in May” — and innumerable glasses of Elizabetbrummer is not calculated to raise one’s spirits — however ad- vantageous it may be for one’s figure and com- plexion. * * * * Talking about complexions. At Homburg they are varied. Muddled? ’Umph! One night, say spotty — not unlike samples to be met with at Apia, Honolulu, and such like holy, over mission- ed and mixed breed places. But Homburg and all these German Bads are cosmopolitan. Undecided complexions are welcomed and well treated. The only thing requisite is plenty of “Oof.” * * * * H.R.H. is very attentive to the ladies of his immediate circle. (Some spiteful people say he’s attentive to the ladies of other people’s circles. But that’s neither here nor there) — trots them out to the flower stalls and bonbon shops, buys them what pleases them — for what pleases them, pleases him. * * * * Very conservative, too. Occupies his old corner on the terrace at Ritters — dines at 7.30 — (the “smart” crowd dine at 8.30) — is great chums with Lady Sarah Wilson — (goodness knows where the captain is) — and her sister Lady Georgina Curzon. * * * * Fearfully energetic, ladies — they amuse His Highness, and nothing amuses him like being amused. * * * * Entre nous — the Prince loves a little scandal — a Maid of Honor, or the latest serio-comic. It all works in. * * * * I forgot to tell you the single-breasted frock- coat is nowadays de rigeur. You have to give all your double-breasted ones to the pot- plant man. “Single-breasted.” The Prince wore a single- breasted frockcoat at the Queen’s garden party, and he wears one at Homburg. I ought to have told you before. But, there — you know how it is yourself. * * * * The Shah’s had a high old time at Ostend. Been to the races, the fetes, the fireworks. The suite, headed by the Grand Vizier, went down to the shore, pulled off their shoes and stockings, and paddled — absolutely paddled! (see Press Associa- tion). What was the Shah about during their absence? Looking over some Article de Paris, I daresay. * * * * His Shahness is very fond of curios — motors, hansom cabs, pianos, etc. When he arrived in Ostend he was rushed with all sorts of wonders. He sent his compliments, and hoped the gentle- men didn’t think he’d come to Ostend to inspect the inventions of all Europe. * * * * Among the list of the people going north are Captain and Mrs. Clive Behrens. Remember? They were married last year, just before the war broke out. * * * * Mrs. Behrens is Lord Rothschild’s only daugh- ter. When all the young blood of England was clamoring at the War Office gates to be sent to the front, Lord Rothschild gave £5000 to the “C.I.V.” Fund, I fancy; anyway to some war fund, and asked that his new son-in-law should be exchanged and sent somewhere else. His re- quest was granted. Captain Behrens was made adjutant of a volunteer corps and sent to — to Coventry. * * * * Our only Melba is in Dublin this week — great form. Staying at the Lodge with the vice-regals, driving in the vice-regal carriages, included in the vice-regal procession to the Horse Show (no mention of H. C), helping Lady Cadogan with this, that, and the other — the pet of the vice-regal house party. You never heard such a fuss. * * * * They say there’s no result without a cause. No smoke without fire, and all that, and I sup- pose they are right, for the innermost reading of this honor to the Australian prima donna as- soluta — is the prosaic and practical fact — that she sang without fee at the Patriotic Concert got up by Lady Cadogan and Lady Limerick. * * * * At the show (the horse show I mean), Lady Cadogan wore black silk gauze over white silk, black velvet hat with huge ostrich plumes. * * * * The Cornwallis Wests were there (Mr. and Mrs. George still in Paree), Princess Henry of Pless (Mrs. G.’s sister-in-law) was all orchids, orchid-colored dress; ditto hat, trimmed with or- chids, etc; Mrs. Cornwallis West (still lovely) and Miss Cornwallis West wore heliotrope and white chiffon — clouds of it. * * * * Remember? These beautiful Cornwallis West women are of the beautiful Irish family that sent our Royal Susceptibilities off their heads for three generations. The late Prince Consort was in love with the grandma. H. R. H. had a most pronounced penchant for Mrs. Corn- wallis West, and the Duke of York was dread- fully gone on H.I.H. the Princess Henry of Pless. * * * * Of course one don’t talk of these things any more. One only does one’s best to remember them. * * * * Lord and Lady Coventry were there. Lord Coventry is one of the judges, also a personage, and a very worried personage about Ascot-time. He’s Master of the Queen’s Buckhounds, and has the giving out of the tickets for the Royal en- closure. Lord Coventry is not only a good judge of a horse, he is an authority on white-faced cat- tle, and black-faced sheep. I don’t know if that’s anything to do with his decided opposi- tion to the marriage of his daughter with Prince Victor Dhuleep-Singh. * * * * Of course, as we all know, the Prince is more than “ecru.” * * * * What shooting his father the old Prince had down in Hertfordshire. Many’s the brace he sent me. Now they say lots of the birds have “en- teric.” * * * * Isn’t that dreadful. * * * * The patriotic concert at the University Build- ings was a great success. An American friend told me in the picturesque language of the States: “It was a ‘corker,’ you bet. Seats sold at 25dol each.” * * * * Well worked up. At the last moment a whisper went round Phaynix Park, the strawberry beds, and Dublin generally, that that purty Irish girl, Princess Henry of Pless, would oblige with a song. But she didn’t. * * * * There was decorations galore, an’ lashin’s av’ whisk — I mean lots of flags and lances, and “bys from th’ war,” and drums— the band of the Rifle Brigade, and a thousand pounds in the hall. * * * * Look at that, now. * * * * Their Excellencies and the suite and the guests filled the Royal box. The band played “God Save” — and the audience took it standing. Lady Cadogan wore black satin, and a big crown of diamonds. * * * * Melba had a magnificent reception, and sang the glorious scene from “Lucia” like the real God-gifted dickey bird she is. Lady Limerick played “Impromptu” of Chopin. Baskets of flow- ers were laid at the ladies’ feet — such a scene of excitement. Well, you know what Irish hearts are. * * * * When I think of all this— I remember the en- tertainment given at the Alhambra last June, just after I got home. It was — if you recollect — given by the Australian and New Zealand artists in aid of the wives and families of the Australian and New Zealand dead and wounded in the war. * * * * The house was not good, but many boxes were taken, and in one sat Melba. “Why didn’t you get madame to sing?” said I to one of the hon. managers. “It would have made such a differ- ence.” “Yes,” said he — “£500 at least. We did ask her, but she couldn’t see her way— said something about her Covent Garden contract.” * * * * “What a pity,” said I. “Yes,” said he. You say the same. Don’t you? * * * * “The monument erected by the women of Hun- gary to the late Empress Elizabeth, and placed in the Capuchin vault in Vienna, was consecrated on Saturday, Cardinal Claudius Vaszary officiat- ing in person. The monument, which is the work of the Hungarian sculptor George Zala, represents the Virgin Mary standing behind an altar on which is a cross with the inscription, ‘In memo- riam sempiternam,’ and a crown of thorns. In front of the altar is a prie-dieu supported by two angels, the whole group being surrounded by a large bronze wreath of the Empress’s favorite flowers — violets, pinks, wild roses, mallows, chrysanthemums, and daisies. A branch of palm is attached to the wreath, and the bronze ribbons bear the inscription, ‘To the mother of Hungary from the daughters of Hungary.’ ” * * * * Phil May has been to Dutchland. Read what he thinks about the babies: * * * * “Such little innocents Dutch children look! — but in reality they are the most mischievous little rascals in the world. They would wait in swarms outside my hotel in Holland, and follow me to my workshop clamoring for coppers, which they generally managed to get. Some of them would get tipped twice over — they are so much alike in their general ‘get-up’ that it is difficult to distinguish them. I once had a little model posing for me all day, and the next she did not turn up; so my friend went round for the reason, and he was surprised to hear from the indignant mother that I had only given her daughter about twopence. I discovered afterwards that this was the case. But I had given five shillings to an- other little girl who had been standing in my light all day.” * * * * How would you like to be called an “Irrespon- sible Itinerant?” Not at all. Neither should I. But that’s what Dr. Rendal Francks, the con- sulting surgeon to the British troops, calls Mr. Ashmead Bartlett-Coutts, M.P. * * * * Dr. Clark has gone a-yachting in the North Sea. And Northampton is waiting, with some impati- ence, the return of Mr. Labouchere from the Engadine. * * * * Nice goings on with the ’bus ’osses millinery — 95 in the shade. Passenger on box seat. Driver meditatively flicking off fly. “Yes, laidy, ‘Baby’ and ‘Smiler’ is a fine pair of ’osses as you’d see anywheres. But ‘Smiler’ has a jealous mind — an’ t’other day he thought as ‘Baby’s’ ’at was a bit tastier than his’n. So when we left ’em stand- ing, he’d ate hers ’alf erf her ’ed afore we could get back. That’s ‘Smiler’ all over, that is — but he’s a grand ’oss all the same!” * * * * Extract from the annual account book of “The City’s Estate.” * * * * Item — “By illuminating copies of freedom of City to Lord Kitchener and J. Henniker Heaton Esq., M.P., £52 10s.” * * * * There’s an association — what could be nicer? * * * * Oh! that electric railway. You know the man asked me last week. “Did it make you hungry?” Well, a man this week being run in and fined the usual 5s said it wasn’t drink— “He’d been on the electric railway.” * * * * Marie Corelli’s new book, “The Master Chris- tian” is out — came out on Thursday. The first edition is a record — 100,000 copies. The amiable authoress is nothing if not on the war path. This is the dedication: * * * * “To all those Churches who quarrel in the name of Christ.” * * * * The work is understood to be a venomous at- tack on the Church — the Roman Catholic Church * * * * It is full of priests. The poor, dear fathers all have illegitimate sons — sons who want to avenge their mother’s shame, etc. * * * * A good deal of the Transpontine drama in that. * * * * Marie lets herself go. Here is a lurid descrip- tion of “Servant of Christ:” * * * * “Low, beetling brows — a sensual, cruel mouth, with a loosely projecting under-lip— eyes that ap- peared to be furtively watching each other across the thin bridge of nose — a receding chin and a narrow cranium, combined with an expression which was hypocritically humble, yet sly ... a type mercilessly true to the life; the face of a priest ” * * * * Not flattering is it? * * * * She brings the Pope on the scene, and is not complimentary to the Holy Father. “So pale and thin is he that he ‘might have posed as the frail ghost of a dead Faith,’ as he sat on his throne ‘like a shrunken white mummy set in a gilded sarcophagus.’ ” * * * * His Holiness has counsellors, one of whom— Moretti — expresses himself in the following ten- der terms: * * * * “Hate is a grand, a strong quality! It makes nations — it builds up creeds! If men loved one another what should they need of a Church? . . . From hate and envy spring emulation and conquest! — and we of the Church encourage the haters to hate on.” * * * * After uttering this statement, “he stood enrapt, his hand upraised, his eyes flashing.” * * * * Thank goodness, there’s one good priest Car- dinal Felix Boupre. But he dies. I don’t won- der at it. * * * * She’s dreadfully cocksure about everything. This is her opinion of the Church generally. * * * * “The Church instead of being a brotherhood united in the Divine service of Christ, is a mere secular system of avarice and tyranny.” * * * * I fancy she must have been trying a little sac rilege on her own, and got disappointed. * * * * There is an appendix: “Relics of Paganism in Christianity as Approved by English Bishops.” The Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Bristol, Chester, Chichester, Lincoln, Oxford, and St. Albans, are quoted. The practices they are said to approve are the use of incense, the confessional, and hymns to the Vir- gin. * * * * They say dear Mr. Kensit is dreadfully pleased. Anyway, Marie, is going to make money. * * * * Mr. Kensit, I understand, is to run for a seat in Parliament at the general election. He will stand on the “Protestant Platform.” But if that don’t pan out, will try the “Patriotic Plat- form,” irrespective of creed. * * * * Adolphus: “You refuse me now because I am poor, but the day may come when I shall be wealthy.” Miss Capel Court: “Yes, but papa says that speculating on futures is always a risky game.” * * * * Mrs. Soothing: “I am afraid you’re going to buy a drink with that twopence I gave you.” Bill Bumpers: “Ye didn’t size me gauge, lydy. Twopence don’t buy me no drink. It jist gits me ’er taste.” * * * * “Look here, sir!” exclaimed the maiden lady. “I want you to take back that parrot you sold me. I find that it swears very badly.” “Well, madam,” replied the dealer, “It’s a very young bird; it’ll learn to swear more perfect when it’s a bit older.”
