Tho number of visitors registered ut the turnstiles was 80,577, an increase of 7759 upon the figures for 3S05. The grounds and flower beds, it was stated, bad been well kept, but new cages for the accommodation of young lions, pumas, und tigers, und new aviaries were urgently wanted. The past two years having been a period of drought, the pad docks for the buffaloes, deer, and kangaroos were last summer quite denuded of grass, and the excessive heat of tlie sandy soil hud been very prejudicial to the health of the marsupials, and been the cause of many deaths. More paddock rooin was needed, but this cquld not be afforded without taking in more ground, which' would entail great .expense. The report was adopted.
