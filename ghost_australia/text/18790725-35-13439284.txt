Tho young, therefore, aro exposed to tho greatest perils whenever in tho .schools education is not (closely united- with religious U.iehing. Where- fore^ . bintio " primary schools oro established ohielly to give the people a religious education and to lead th,om to piety and Christian morality, they huvo justly attracted to theiiiselvos in a glentor degreo than other educational in- stitutions all the.cere, solicitudo, and vigilance of the Church. Tho design of withdrawing primary schools f i oin thoeontrbl of the Church, and tho exertions made to carry this design into effect aro thoiefore inspired by a spirit of hostility towards her, and by the desire of extinguish- ing among the pcdplo the divine light, of our holy fiiitli. Those who pretend that the Church ought to abdicate or suspend hor control anti her salutary anfión upon tho primary schools, in reality ask her to disobey thô"r commands of her Divine Author, and to _ be falso til the charge sbo has received from God of guiding all men to, salvation ; and in whatever country this perni- cious design of removing the schooh from ecclesiastical authority should bo entertained and carried into execution, and the "young thereby exposed to tho danger of losing their failli, there t'ho Church would bo in duty bound not only te> use her best' efforts, and to employ every means to Eccuro for them tho necessary Christian education and instruction, but moreover ..would fool hersolf obltged to warn all the faithful, npd 1,o- declare that no one can in conspienca frorjiient such schools bb being adverse to the Catholic Church.'"' .' . " Wherever the.quostion of Secularists' schools, has arisen, tho Bishops of the Church havo preached the same doclnne, and'have urged upon the people the same truths with the same warning-}. . How the Bishops of Ireland havo spokou in Synod, and gut of Synod, again and again, is {mown to all of von. The English hierarchy haR more than once considered it its duty to address the Catholio people ol' England to the ¿mho eiïoct. In one of their recent joint pas- toral lofters they siy : ' We have already declared that edu- cation without1 Christianity is impossible ; or, to use a modern phrase, that thoscculirr and re'igious elements of education aro inseparable; that éducation is essentially rolitjious, and therefore that whore religion is excluded there is no educa- tion.' ' Hold fast by tho old traditions and axioms of your fathers. Schtiols without religion may give instruction, but education thoy ennnaf give ; they cannot educate a people. Let it be called national instruction, but, in tho name of Christianity, let it not be called education. Not only is education without religion impossible, but instruction with- out religion is. instruction without morality. A people to whom, morality is not taught cannot be mot al; but Christian"'Inoráis cannot bo taught without roligion ; for what is morality but tho law of duty, whjeh nrises .from our personal relations towards God and our neighbour ? And how is it pos^iblo to teach this'hw of' ditty -without a knowledge of the persons towards whom these relations exist ? But to know this \--unless men are going to reduce a Christian people to the level of DeWs-Christianity must bo taught_ in our schools. Christian morality cannot bo taught .without the knowledgo.of Christ, and that ."gain, by necessity, involves the knowledge of His history, His teaching, his eonn_aud meuts. His ' iucunuitión, His divino personality. And what- is this but dogma? for reh'eion without dogma is not Christianity. Ir whatsoever school, then, religion is not taught, morality is not taught ; and where morality is not'tJug'ht,-'the"lieurt, the' conscience, and the will of children are not educated for the duties and conflicts of life. .-What oan be moro .false, what more fatal to men, to families, and to States, than to call this education :'f Such, then,'being the emphatio teaching of the Catho- lic Church, \ve, the Archbishop and Bishops of this colony, with hil rho weight of ¡our authority, eopdemn the principle of Seçulurist education, und these schools which aro founded oii that principle.^ XVe condemn them, first, because they contravene the first principles of the Christian religion ; and .secondly, ,bei;ituso they are seed-plots of future im- morality, infidelity, and lawlessness, boing calculated to debase "' the standard of human excellence, and to corrupt the political, social, and individual life of future (..itiy.ens. Wherefore we urge our clergy to do oil, in then power, iii tho pulpit and out of it, to instruct tho people in these teachings or tho Christian religion. Thoy should not rest till each, member of their congregation fuHy.realizes the true position of affairs. They should bring before th» minds" of parents the." terrible calamity to their children in exposing them to lej3 of faith and morals, and endeavour to niàko them feel that they could not do a greater service to religion or to the State thuu to upset, by constitutional means, ii system which, whilst it is a crying injustice, to themselves, promises to bo n source of incalculable evil (o the colony. Let them, moreover, wain parents, who through a, spirit of indifference or wqrldliness, are exposing their children to proximate danger of pervision and of min,.that they ure tempting tho anger of the Almighty God ; and thii't they aie jeopardizing the faith, the morality, the eternal happiness of those who are too young to 'help themselves, and who havo iieon confided by Xuturo itself to their guardianship and protection. Let. tV-in oft°n 10 mind tho people that tiley aro gravely responsible if they give encouragement to such schools, for, tv so doing, they are helping to perpetuate a gi eut evil, and aie standing tiV obstacles in tho way of Christian men who aro bent on bringing about a chungo. Let one and all remember .-hat their fathers of old suffered for tho faith, and let them not show theinsolves unworthy of their own ilosb and blood -flesh which was freely wounded, and blood which was freely spilt, rather than betray Christian principle or com- promise Christian faith. " Wo are profoundly conscious thal a latent sense of fair-play exists-in the community at large. -Let all Catholics unite in bviugiug before the minda of their fellow-electors, and their representatives iu l'urliament these two fact?, first, that Catholics havo to pay for schools which .they cannot safely use, aud which they consider au evil to the country ; aud, secondly, that whilst they are thus made'to pay, no ¿iiinl provision has been made for them ; let the country fully coniprehend our griovancus, and a sense.of .common,- even-handed justice will assist us in working out a remedy. WouldSeoulari its hold their peace, if without eirual provision being made for thom, public treasure were lavished on Catholic Grammar Schools, and Catholic Primary schools, whi!»t £7000 were spent on the triining of hoya, exclusive from Catholic institutions'r1 Would they not hold that they wero being treated with extraordinary im'usfico mid unfairness ï And would not the whole world agreo with them 'i " It will'be urged that the State leaves religion to parents and priests, and lays claim to instruct children in seuuhtr matters only. True, the State docs not, and cannot, claim a com- mission to educate. It is the bounden duty of the Stale to pioteet, not to usurp, tho moral duties of its members. All " itian fathers and moilun s ure re.juiied by the natmal flint Divine law to y.\c their childi en ti Christian education. The'State has no power ui commission to usurp the parental rights, mid to compel pa'¿nts to violate their conscience by sencjiiig their childrei' to «chools whore un alien religion or no religion at all it. taught. To do su would be to indulge in the' meet cruel form of religious persecution. The : ¡¿tato, has no 'lights higher or moro sacred than tlio-e of parent^. _vor dops the authority of the Church cross or thwart the natural lights and duties of parents' : ¡te commission is to see that thoso rights are not hivr-ded, and that thpse duties uib performed.

Their failli is viaibly enfeebled, not to allude to I their morality, their manners are rough and irreverent, they hiivo'little bense uf respect and gentleness, they have no ( ntiiaction for prayer or for the Sacraments ; and promise to swell a class which is ulieady far too Inrçc in number.
