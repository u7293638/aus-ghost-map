THE MAORI'S DAUGHTER! A TALE OF THE NEW ZEALAND WAR. BY THE AUTHOR OF 'THE COTTAGE GIRL,' 'GIPSEY QUEEN,' &c;, &c.; (From the Penny Miscellany.) Chapter III. A TERRIBLE CHANGE. After Bessie Marlow's return to England with her brother's orphan son, the aunt and nephew remained in Knightsbridge, in the house of Bessie's stepmother, uutil a sad change was per ceptible in the once prim and vigorous intellect of the sister of the unfortunate settler of Egmont Bay. As soon' as 'the necessity for mental exertion .ceased, as^ soon as the poor boy , ' under her cha'rge.wasrsafe, she sank into a state of utter; prostration, from which -' inothing could, rouse 'her. ,?,,;' '?' ??.'?

But .happily for David there were V' foafiter dispositions among liis kin. He and his aunt were sent for at. once by Lord Templeton, of Bardan .Castle, in Yorkshire, .and there they were re-. 'ceived Avith truest kindness. .-.:' ; ? ? ?? Xord Templeton was the uncle; of David's mother,, whq early lost bothiher Vparentejand was an only child. He' was in.' i.iippearance a little, ill — . dressed, .unaffected person, genial, kind, : and hospitable. His extreme generosity, his' careless ness in managing his affairs, his habit . of trusting everybody, no matter how unworthy, had considerablydamaged his ' property, , which .was so cramped with debt that he expected .to* have to sell all, and shift for a living. But until sheriffs officers were knock ing at his doors, and executions actually in, his house, he would not trouble himself. ? . - \ He was about fifty, had' no wife nor flhild, but lived in Bardan Castle, sur xounded by county visitors. ???'-., In Bardan Castle, Bessie and David .-'. found a liberal home, the presiding : matron, a relative of the peer, took a lively interest in their comfort, and many friends ': of the family manifested their sympathy. '..''.' A fellow voyager from New Zealand :-. became Bessie's devoted personal at tendant. . This was Mrs Lambton; one of tho labourer's wives . of the , Egmont Bay ? settlement, who had escaped like Bessie. from the massacre. ] She had wandered about the country many days before she could find shelter . and safety in the . British camp. -'j. But no attention, and no kindness could for long years remove the settled darkness that had fallen on Bessie's reason, the result of the awful scenes she had passed through. ? It was pitiful to see her constantly wandering in. delirious imaginations, talking to imaginary persons, passing through visionary scenes, sometimes of a most affecting character, and some times very terrible, ; Ensign Howard was often present to her fancy, directing the defence of the farm, and tlmlKngly her voice would rise, and her .gestures become wild, as she echoed his-commarids or those 'of her brother. . . .? : ' Close up that door, and place a mattress against ; it — Put the: ^children in their cot— r.This is no; tim«;io weep, we must ? prayas we fight— Iiid^you hear , footsteps , outside ?— Yes, it.

' At the same time the spirit of re bellion -remained unquencbed as later revolts wore to prove.. ...... ; . However, for about fifteen years all was well. The settlements ithat had nearly been extinguished revived again, and emigration flowed from Old Britain of tfee -north' ito New Britain of 'the south in a. remarkably, rapid stream.1, v ' All over .the South Island flourishing rnlnniflfl wnrp. .^Rfnliliclinfl nnrlor *x. flow constitutional government. . Nelson— .'.Canterbury— Otago — of fered the fairest, conceivable openings for a superior class of English emigrants. 'The natives -were few in these pro vinces, and all -pre-accepted the ? Chris tain faith; they 'helped to build churches and schools— arid they worshipped as well as traded .with our people. ' Here and there at long intervals a Maori village sprang up side by side with English towns— so called — but having little the .aspect of English towns — -and none of their low class miseries.- . Or; now and then the Maories camped near the English, just : like rov ing hands of gipsies, just as harmless, interesting, and useful in. their small trading speculations. , Indeed the Maories of the South re semble gipsies in person and colour, and in genius and general character, perhaps also, in some of their secret barbarous superstitions. ' Ensign Howard, promoted to a cap taincy for valuable services in the field, returned to England eager to rejoin his family, from whom he had been so long .separated, and animated, by a secret hope of finding a wife in her whom' ho hadloved from the first : moment when he saw her in the verandah of her bro ther s farm, and heard her sweet laugh. That gay and' happy laugh rang in his ears still. Alas ! he had heard few other sounds from -her and those she loved bince that hour when he first came over the Egmont Hills, and among Marlowe's rich corn fields, and beheld the lovely scene spread out be low. It was all before his mental vision, smiling in the splendour of a New Zea land summer, when he first heard from his own family, of Bessie's mental alien ation. : How could he wonder at such a re sult of the awfully sudden calamity that had fallen like a lightning stroke upon her New, Zeal and home. , . His strongest feelings were aroused, and'impartin'g to his ; aged mother his attachment for Bessie, he declared he would ' move heaven and earth to re cover her.' . . They had parted most affectionately in New Zealand with the understandings that if they ; were permitted Vto meet again under peaceful circumstances they would spend the rest of their lives to gether. ? ,- Captain Howard regarded this as a i solemn, com pact. , j He visited iLord Templtfton: and. 1 aid the case before him. ? - . 'I have come back to England to claim dear Bessie for my wife. I .find her- under eclipse, but' eclipses' do is.ot ?las-t, andhofs will not. ;, Suffer .mq 'to see.her.' . ; ..''..? -..';' .. :;,', '^'.' '_'? The wreck was andeedi melanchely, bnt. Captain Howard fondly believed not altogether hopeless. ' . ..With slow dragging step, with fcent bead, loose hair, hollow vacant eyes, set tin .livid rings, and a face utterly unlike her former self, pinched and: wan — 'Bes- ?sie; appeared before.him. He was not prepared for so great a shock, and the hardy soldier covered his ?eyes, and actually wept like a child. Lord Templeton had wrapped -a shawl over her head, which ho now removed, ?and she appeared in a loose white gown, that, .as slio stood in a loner straiure si lence, in the centre of the room, might leasily have been .taken for her shroud. , ;' She seldom speaks now,' sa'ili Lord Templeton, ' only sighs and utters low murmurs.'1. , He then softly addressing her, asked her if she remembered Captain Howard. ' The Maories Ikilled him,' she an swered. . ,? .. Could that be Bessie Marlowe's voi ce — so hollow and strange. . 'My dear.,' said Lord Tompleton, ' you have forgotten. He was saved if yoiv.will Tecolleot.'' ? ;. ' Who was saved ??''.. ? 'Ensign Howard.' ? .' Whereis he!?' 'Here; my. dear. Ho has .returned to -England, .and comes to visit you.: Will you not welcome your New Zea land friend ?' She fastened a long gaze .on iher lover^ who was unable to speak a word, so deeply was he affected. ? ' You .are welcome. My brother will show you over his lands. The crops are ? nil in find pnnriif.irwn ' Vin+. wo limrn mnnVi .work to do. I ride every morning miles over the fields with Clement. And che country is very beautiful. Oh, very.' ' There you have had more words from her than we have had from her these six months,' whispered Lord ?Templeton. '? She evidently imagines that you are both meeting in the settle ment.' He placed her in a seat facing Cap tain Howard, then saying aside to him., ' She is perfectly tractable and inoffen sive.' The three were silent for some min utes, while she continued to gaze va cantly on the soldier's bronzed face. Presently she arose, and going close to the captain, traced with her forefinger a remarkable scar on his forehead. Then memory struggled with oblivion — 'Tho Maori's tomahawk did this.'' After a pause, during which her fea tures moved convulsively, she seized the captain's hand, and kissed it. ' Bessie !' he exclaimed, and caught her to his breast, ' Dearest Bessie, I have come to fetch you to my own home. Will you not go with me ?' ' Bye-and-bye ! We will ride in the forenoon, there is a good road for two miles. Clement and his men work hard, I can tell you. We shall have a little town soon.' 'I cannot bear this — I must go.' . Mrs Lambton, her attendant, gently disengaged her hands which clung to Captain Howard. ' Let , me alone !' she wailed. 'Do you not see this is my, brother's ghost ?' ' Take cave of her for heaven's sake!' exclaimed Captain Howard, and he fled 'W'i uillj illVl IVII lllg T ICiUUi 'Where is he gone ?' . 'My dear, , he will return when you are better; come now, you must take this glass of wine, and try ' to bo cheer ful,'! arid, Templeton led her down a few steps to the secluded garden, and per suaded her to take a few hours in the air,' and drew her attention to the flowers. ' . She plucked at half withered rose, and gave it into his hand with a. meaning look. ''...?? . '. . ' ' Whatis this for, my dear ?' 'Give it to your visitor,' she said; ' he will understand it.' . ' To Captain Howard, do you mean?' ?'Yes.:' ' i ; ~\ ;\ - ..;' ; . 'When shall he come, again ?' ,'_'. ';To-movrow.', , \, : ' You will walk with him. here ?' . '' Yes.' Next afternoon she was led to a seat, ?under a largo drooping willow, and there her noblc-he&rtcd; lover met her again. Ho held tho withered roso in his hand. ' Bessio ! my beloved,' ho began, in a broken voice, but she checked him. ' ' Hush ! I want to hoar that bird sinS-' . ' After listening for some time to tho song of a blackbird she started up, re pelling him- — cried out. , ' Duncan, I will not bo troubled so, leave mo this instant !' The -captain's heart sank heavily. Hoped died withiu him. Yet ho resolve.'! faithfully to devote himself to her for the remainder of his life. ' A romantic and sensational resolu tion. ? But there are a few men capable of large sclf-§acrifice, arid elevated affec tion, and he was one of them. His ? hope of happy married life -in his own ancestral homo wns vanished. But he loved Bessie Marlowe, and that love had been strongly cemented by danger and difficulty. That .night when sho bound up his deadly- wound, and supported his sink ing head on her kneos, among the thickets of the ravine, while the glare of the burning farm was . all around them — that dreadful night ho swore, to him self to dovoto his whole future life to her, if she would accept' his love. And now, under the most painful and pathetic circumstances, ho flinched not but fesolred to fulfil that vow. He explained all this to Lord Tem pleton, who regarded him at once with admiration and respect. Everything now was doing that money, medical skill, and the tenderest and wisest affection could do to restore Bessie Marlowe. What tho result might be — the future only could reveal. Chapter. IV. THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSINg CHILI). When Duncan and the missionary parted from Bessie at .London Bridge, she gave both her address, in order that if any tidings should by any possibility reach cither of them of the lost child left behind in New Zealand, they might communicate with her. Tho missionary did call on Miss Mar lowe. repeatedly afterwards, and she was always glad to see him, and tried to con verse with him, until the dark cloud settled on her reason, and she failed to recognise him. He had not returned to England to remain there. Ho camo chiefly to lay certain informanion before societies and ministers of state especially interested in the welfare of New Zealand. The insurrection was then so serious it was feared New Zealand would have to be given up to the natives. Not only the Marlowe family, but many others of the best settlers had been mas sacred, others entirely ruiued in their worldly prospects, and numbers were hastening back to England. The cause of the insurrection might be summed up in disunion between go verning and managing parties. The missionaries were an important power,, generally on the side of the natives ; the settlers, with bright exceptions, were selfish, grasping, and wanting in consideration for the native people. The governing authorities settled,in New Zealand clashed with the authorities sent out from the imperial government, even the general commanding the troops that were entrusted with the difficult task of subduing the natives, could not agroe with the Governor in whom for the time was vested dictatorial power. A house divided against itself cannot stand, and. that was tho case of the New Zealand colony, which was beating it self to pieces against that fatal rock, disunion. While the missionary was going into all these matters with the public personages in England whom they especially concerned, he tried to draw attention to the uncertainty of the fate of Mr Marlowe's youngest child ; but although there was plenty of sym pathy expressed, there appeared to be little hope of anything being done on its behalf when everyone in the disturbed provinces had more than enough to do to preserve their own property and lives. A.fter a few months the missionary prepared again to return to the post of 'danger. He was going on a special mission*, right into tho heart of the rebellion, and his line of duty was marked out for him through tho centre of the Maori dis tricts. He had received all his instructions, and was taking a final walk from West minster to London Bridge, deeply pon dering on the hazardous work ho had taken in hand, wheu ho met Duncan, strolling along, his overgrown frame at tired in a very handsome manner,- and his great rough beard trimmed to iho last new style. The missionary scarcely knew the man, he was so altered by the tailor, tho hairdressoiyand the bootmaker. ' Surely, snrcly,' said he, ' this can not be my old acquaintance, tho whaler of Cook's Straits.' ' Certainly not,' responded Duncan laughing ; ' I told you the grub would turn into a butterfly. Here I am, you see, look at me !' Swaggering he struck his hat over one eye, and throw back his coat to dis play his brilliant white waistcoat and splendid watch and chain. ? ' It's all right, old fellow ; no. more whaling for me.' ' How do you mean to support all this grandeur?' ' Ah, that's a matter beyond you. . Where were you wandering?' ' I am about to wander in tho old . direction again, Duucan.' He jumped backwards. ' No 1 not surely — you don't mean ? that: — I won't believe that — missionary though you are by nature and profession. You can't be such a blessed ' fool as to ' Yes, I am such a fool. Thither I go. Tho vessel is oven now loading in ' tho docks, and in a few more- hours I am off.' ' Well, I'm ? Now, look here, we'll go and have a chop and a drop of grog, . and you shall tell mo nTl about it.' ' You know I never take grog.' ' In a few minutes they were seated in ? a quiet corner of a- coffee room. ' Well to be sure,' began Duncan ; ' going to face again those tattooed de mons ! what can you be thinking of ?' ' Many things. Shall I try to ex plain?' ' ? ? ' No, certainly not. Waiter !' he ? roared ; ' get me a glass of brandy, . there's a good fellow.' ' Duucan, I am glad we have met to day.' ' So am I — I've had a sneaking kind ness for you, old comrade in calamity, ever since that night. You came out strong then, by Jupiter ! ' ' Duncan, if I should happen to see your Maori wife, what shall I say to ? her?' The question was a stinger. Duncan was not prepared for it. His large fat animal face became surly in a moment. He tossed off the brandy, and scowled defiance ; but the missionary understood all that. In Egmont Bay, Duncan had bar gained with Nikoti to give him skins and oil of a certain value in return for wife from the pa — one to wait on Dun crn and be his slave, on tho detestable plan that had become common in the country. The poor creature was industrious, good-tempered, patient, and only too submissive; very usefel to him, and wholly inexpensive. ' One calico garment and a blanket sufficed her in the way of wardrobe, and' the leavings of the master's table for' food, and a kind word or look now and then were wages enough in return' for valuable services, always given un grudgingly, in his comfortless, unfur nished log- house, where he lived in tho most rough and ready and lazy fashion, for Duncan was no whaler or sealer himself, he only employed others, and traded chiefly with the natives, though sometimes he visited other townships to dispose of skins, oils, &c.; Worthy Duncan, under these circum stances, had thought it no harm to offer his hand to Miss Marlowe, for what was a Maori woman that he should consider her feelings or rights; After a few moments angry reflec tion Duncan changed the topic, but the missionary held to his text. ' You will not, then, send a few kind words, or authorise me to hand her a little money from you if I meet with her ?' ,.,.:,.. ' If you speak of her again to mo I shall walk straight out of this room, and not exchange another word with yon.' ?:,..;;. , ? . ' ' You know, Duncan, I never did mind your roaring. I have mentioned her with the best intentions, and I must again ask yon ? ' Duncan flew out of the room as fast as his ?weight would permit. ?., ? ; .

But he told me that I had nothing. He was^ master of every pennyj as well as of me. And when I spoke out my feelings — for I had never been brought up in fear but always in lovey and could speak my mind without any bad feeling at home — he beat me. There was an end of all my happiness in this life; from that day. t- ? . ' The old pensioner died, and Joel's father, and he had more money, and ' bought more barges, and used to convey goods to and fro between the London docks, and vessels coming from foreign parts that anchored in the Thames. ' But though he grew prosperous I did not. He was always the same selfish spirit, and kept me poor. I went home to mother, and he came to see me when he pleased, and staid away as long as he pleased, and gave me what little money he pleased, and if I spoke a word he did not like, he beat me. ' Then came the worst.' She beat her breast unconsciously with her tightly clenched hands as she continued — , ' Wo at home had always kept a good character. Never one belonging to mo had had a disgrace. Judge then, how I felt the fall, when my husband came hiding from the police. ' As far as I could understand the matter, he had been ongaged carrying goods from a Russian barque, that, was anchored some miles down the river, and a valuable case of sable and ermine ?were missing. '' ' Oh, dear ! he was taken and tried — the furs had been sold by- Sharpe— ? the- case was hidden iri his cellar on Tower Hill. So he was transported on the 'evidenced two of his 'men.

Several, times in. the course of -the moving narrative of troubles, ; that are only too common about St/ Luke's,' and' theeastern districts of London, the lady noticed the hollow. cough,.and shortened breathing, and hectic spot on the sunken check,, which clearly foretold coming rest in a better; land 'for the 'unfortunate Mrs' Sharpo.

From some conversation we had together, I think he will be of groat use to me. He bails, I believe, from: ? Greenwich way, and the only thing I don't like about him is that ho carries two names. At present he is James Duncan, but when he was showing me some papers and -plans of this colony, he betrayed a singular confusion on my taking up a letter with an English post mark, addressed in another name— which must have been his own — or why his singular embarrassment. I tihink the' name was Thorpe or Sharpe.' The lady changed colour. 'It never struck me until this moment, that your name is the same as that mentionea there. And of course your husband is — It is very strange, I feel chilled to the heart, You say your husband was in New Zealand ?when ho last wrote to yoi* — would you mind showing mo the letter.' Mrs Sharpe went to an old bureau, and quickly produced it. The coincidence was sufficiently re markable. The two letters were dated from the same district in the south island, and in the same year and month. It was nlmosfc incomprehensible, and hardly to be beleived, but there lay the two letters side by side on the table— with the place clearly written— Takiolo, May, 1844— the day of the month had :been omitted in Mrs. Elliot's letter.
