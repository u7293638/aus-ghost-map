SPORTING. MOTORMAN TRAINING NOTES. [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] FLEsnN-oioN, October 21. This was quite an off morning.

Marvel, Paris, Caidonoss, Souvenir, Tantallon, Correze, The Gift, Jack, Hole, Forty Winks, Stromboli, Piecrust, Corvette, Moonray, Kossuth, and Megaphone among others were exercised gently.

The Tyler appeared big but seemed to stop quite hurriedly at the termination of a round on the sand, which occupied 2min. 40sec. Belgiorno covered a mile on the tan in 1min. 51sec... and looks as hard as nails. Fog was given strong pacing exercise. Wilga appeared very light and is evidently in great heart King Olaf was again restricted to an even time circuit on the sand, while Gatling and Bungebah spurted five furlongs in 1min. 8sec , the former performing very creditably. Yabba was apportioned long strong work. Sir William, Albina, and Radoo exercised serviceably, but Melos did not put in an appearance. CAULFIELD, October 21. A fine morning.
