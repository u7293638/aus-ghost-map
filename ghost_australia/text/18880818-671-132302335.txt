Tinr'TIET;D''''0F'''JIARSTRA3r-| ? ..WAY 31EETLSG. v: W k desire to congratulate the people of lialrnain, and the representatives of Five Dock who attended the Tramway Meet ing in the Town Hall on Monday even ing, on the unanimity which then prevailed, and the thoroughly earnest spirit they evinced. 'A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether' in most cases achieves its object, and we have no doubt a like result will follow in the tramway matter. If rumour is correct, and we have every reason to be lieve so in this instance, the Hunter's Hill clique have not the ghost of a chance from the Government, of diverting the tramline from its natural and approved route. Nevertheless, until we have the '? bird in the hand ' we must not crow too loudiv. It behoves ail who assembled on Monday not to let the matter end with their mere attendance, but each one. in his own circle, should keep it moving, thus maintaining a healthy and active spirit. As already repeatedly shown in these columns, and at the public meeting, this line we advocate is our natural birthright. and no '? mess of pottage ' from the Esau of Hunter's Hill should make us relinquish it. We are glad to learn that the petition proposed and carried at the meeting, ij being largely signed: and we would impress on those in our community wlio have not done so, to delay no longer in adding their names. A thorough con sensus of public opinion will no doubt have its full weight with the Government so tiia; we must not lose this opportunity of recording our sentiments on the matter. 'Thrice is he armed who has his quarrel just' say; the bard, and if justice be the test in our tramway agita tion. there shouid be 110 doubt of the issue- Again we say, let the matter be kept moving, aud not till the first sol of our line is turned must we pause to take breath.
