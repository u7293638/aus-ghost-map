We couldn't think who we could get to marry Alvira, and we went ovt r and Sbtou the cutside ghonbouso tloor, that elaute, aud talked it over.

' 1 atkod him what IndUn rilics was, and be eaid they was beads aud hatchets and things that live Indians buried in mounds with dead : Indiana a long time ago; and did we know of ariy mouuds srouud here P That set me thinking: I did know uf one, and I winked to Bud tokupstill; then 1 laid to tho |»iof< ssor *' Wbat'll you give for an Indian mound P" He laugbtd, kiadof surprised, and said if it was genuine he'd give t good deal.

Theu I whiispored to Bud, aud he whispered to me; end we decided we'd better tell the proFeesor the whole thing, nod make him an offer. 60 we told him it he wasn't married, .ad would mairy oor sister Alrira and mako her a slave, we'd give him the Indian mound and call it equate. He laughed the most I ever aeen anybody Uugh, aud atJced us if we meant it. Then hi* inquired all about our family, and Alvira, aud if she was pretty and evurythiog. I told him yes,eke was; and the Indian mound was * goo<l one, 'cause I'd got some beads out of it 1 could .how him* He then asked us right out where fit was-as if we wore audi fools as to tell 1 Bad my*, ..Ob, no, you don't 1" and winked. i This made the profetsor kind of mad, and lie walked aiound a bit with his hands in JJ' pockets. then he asked I *' Where can I see your sister T* Bud told him we'd fix that, and he must .Wi-nr he'd never tell a word of what we said to ibitu, fur we wouldn't show him the Inrtiati muumi. After he'd done it we asked him to go to the big greenhouse while we was eating sup per that night, and we'd comedown and hirii him where ha could eee Alvira when we bcougt.t her tlirirr. t forgot that that was the night when H*n Francis smokes the greenhouses, and we di l hare au awful time of it* We put the profess- r in a kind uf crib in the fordng-huvse. Art*: viyouc got hi it waa petty ttard togvtout \gain; then, too, it was Toy dusty. The ittofa of boning tohanee atoms is all 't ry well when you're ufted to it, but when yon i-i'i-well, you just can't stand it* that's all. And, tiesidis, (l<c profi- Msnr didn't know wbot wa* burning ; bb ib uyLt the whole boute was on fire. However he got out of that crib 1 can't undine, but jui»t as we'd all got arianged juouud the ouUt cd^e of one o' the furnacu pits, and Alvira wa« going (o tell iLc fir L ghost stury, like we always do night* when they smoke tut-gn enhausi*, and the smoke was no thick you could scarcely set; tbe mb. all to onct some one druppod out of it, hollered " Fire!" and ran. If there was an inch in at) them 10 green* bous* b that the professor didn't run or fall over I'd like to know it. 1 think he upset every singlo thing that wasn't nailed down before be got out Hhob Francis was carrying (he little al.ert iron *tove they burn the stems in from one bolide to ano'b^r, and the professor had to knock it eiidwaye, of course, jubt us pa fell iuto the furuare pit. ' Well, the " burglar" got away, so ! beard *em telHng the neighbour*. I'm sure I couldn't say, 'cauKs Bud and 1 suenked off to be I ul>out thai lime. We didu't see the professor a^ain (or st»me days, and then we found liim ore in- ruing walking along tho cieelc looking for (hat mound. Ha didn't art at first a* if he w»s glad to see ub, and even when Bud tuli him we ha >u*t a ttiing against Lioi be just looked at us io sur prise and said "Well, if you are uot the most imjmdmt chil«:i'( n!" 1 I'ou't think that was very polite! After a while he came around, and a&krd; ui bow our lov« ly filter was, and than we Used it up to hive him call upou pa some evening lo consult him Mbout look* He could come home, on Friday ev< uiug, BO'S Alvira would be at boil e; and I'd fli it a<» that she'd come into tbe r-om. I Ik ard ma calling me tLen, and 2 had to go ii to the house. Afier I'd gone Bud got thii gs mixed, wnd \old lb© prufvs^or to conw Sulurdiy evcuing instead. When Friday night came t got Alvira to tlx up by tellii-g La* I wax most sore I Lraidpa invite one of the Britdon loy« ov«r i kn«w she cou'dn't prove anything hy p«, 'oau»>c l.e forgets awful had, Tho profra&i;'r didn't come that night, and I couldn't imagine why. 'cnu-e Bud bad gone home with Coui-iu Willie, and sever told me. 6nturday night we was all except pa tired out, and went to hud early, 1 never seen such a person an pais-Le'il sit up (ill ttvo in tho morning and read Byron's poems. Our house is pietty big, but what witb having so many hired men, we don't have much *Uepi"<r room. Alvira stayed all tho week in towu, and when she csme home Friday night she had lo sleep ou a sofa iu a little rectos in our pailour. No# | our house aiu't built like the hou&e;* in lowu ; it I don't have a front ball, so when you opeu tho front door you sU p right into the parlour. | After everybody was asleep in tho bouse bui 1 pa, there was a knock at tbe fiont door. IVs a de»r, good man, and we just wouldn't toko I anything in ibn world for him, but li«> the awfuleat p nun to forget \ On tbis occttjon be forgot all about Alvira. Be brought n lump I and act it ou the parlour table, and then oj>cned the door. Of course ife was tits prufenior~wbat otlusr I luck could you ex)>cct P Pa iusitto I on ha coming right in, and wheu be found out who he I | was they began to talk about books. Alvira j ' soon woke up, and ju*t bad to lav there with j the bright light shining iu her face, and thote two men sitting quite near ber. Tbey couldn't' I see anything except ber face and head, as the { I recess was pmtly curtained off, and Ue tofa I | almost entirely biddeu. But ber head w s 1 enough; it looked awful. It's the stjle now to j wear your hair crimped; Alvira curls for ! short hair wilh a i urling iron, but ti e crimp*1 ing ebe die* on big hairpin*, which atick out every way aud made bir head look real fuuny. . By tbis time ma and 1 was up and trjrin? to save ber; we could see her through tbe crsck of tbe dcor, hi r cheeks like flie. fihe was so 1 angry witb pa that I just etpected to fee her fly at him; aud there pa sat, gently stroking his wkbkers and smiling, tbe very personiQci* tion of goodwill to man. Ma stood back in the bitting room, wbcre tbe professor couldn't see her, end made fratitio motions to catcl) Lis eye; and when at last she j succeeded what did tho dear old pa doP In stead of taking tbe hint and txcusing bimsiU he juat stopped abruptly what he was saying, and turning upon m* a beaming smile anted bur what she wanted. j Of course roa Lad to go into tbe parlour then and till pa to bring his c< mpany out into the fitting-room. Tb«re was a smile around the professor's moustache all tbe rest of tbe even* ing, and be looked at me ouce and winked. Pa ' liked him very much, and be eat and talked ti;l II o'clock. He told pa he ought to seud me to the town eohoo), 'cause I was a bright me. ! He camo to our house lots of times a!Ur that, 1 and as soon as Alvira was tLrough ecbool he j married her; but my I jou never could make Alt ira believe Bud and I nude that match; ahe1 thinks tho professor fell iu love with her. Just I imsgiue a man falling in love «itb any girl after * seeing her with a lut of crimping pins cn her ' Inad 1 Alvira ia the most di ludod creatufc 1 We showed tho professor where the Indian motwd was; be never could have gue.*scd. 'Jhey dugthiough one sido of it when they made the celery ccllar, so all he had to do was * to go inside of tho cellar and dig straight out j iu a cert*iu place, and tbrre was the heart of I the mound.
