FINGAL. (From our own Correspondent.) Ten minutes since I had placed in my hands by Mr. John Gatty a nugget of gold weighing within a shade of eight ounces, which was ob tained last Tuesday from a hole 50 feet deep, situate in Major's Gully at Mangana. The nugget presented a beautiful appearance, and none but the most sceptical ran doubt the existence of gold in paying quantities at, or in the neighborhood of Mangana. Christmas day was very fine, and we have all behaved remarkably well. Dec 26th.

FATAL ACCIDBNT' AT Deloraine--We regret to hear that Mr. William Nevill was accidentally killed by a cart turning over on him' while on his way from Deloraine to the 'Don. It is supposed (from the evidence of the witnesses present at the inquest, held 'before' H. Douglas, Esq., on Thursday) that the.cart was turned over by coming in contact with the root of a tree. The accident occurred on Monday, 'the 23rd instant, about 4 p.m, and the deceased was not found' until about seven p.m. When discovered the cart was lying on top of his legs, and he was in a very weakstate. The first thing he in quired for was water, which could not be pro. cured for him until the mla who found him went to the Junction Inn, about three mile. distant. ' Assistance was procured at the' Junction, and he was brought there about 11 o'clock the same night. Strange to any, medi-' cal aid was not sent for, and the poor fellow died on the following day at tw o'clock in the afternoon. -The only wish he expressed before death was that he, would like to go 'to his sisters.-- Communicated.

We are happy to as, that it e only injuries received were a few bruises, a severe chaking, and a groit fright, though Mrs. Sutton's clothes were much torn: bad she been two inches taller it is most probable she would have been' killed on the spot.

The story was told, and as the news spread from month to 'mouth, a similar horror to that ahich had prevailed below seemed to be com muuionted.. The day men refused 'to go down, and -all the colliers thereupon re turned. to their homes. In this way n arly 200 men and. boys have "laid them. elves idle,"' and the ghost psesumably holds posseasion lof the pit. i A collier was acci d.ntly killed in one of the workings a few day-ago .- .
