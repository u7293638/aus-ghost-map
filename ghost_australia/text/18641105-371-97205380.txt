'Who every morning said, *I am : ~ . -©own here the only Gentleman,' : Bltooralopralooralooral ritolooralay. ? ? '; a. ? ' \ : Brim full of this strange hallucination 'He was far above working at his vocation, juoa would sooner pare suffered decapitation Than hare taken hia Hat off in salutation, '????'?* 'S ' ' BItooral&c.; . One day when, as usual, by hunger rackt, His way to the pie shop he hastily trackt, He ran up against — ifs a positive fact^-' Tae ' Consolidated Customs Act,' ' i 4! v .Ritooral&ci; . - Tho' he saw the ?« Act' conung iight.faceto face* He disdained for a moment to alter his pace. And to take off his Hat he hadn't the grace, .But stared at it rudely and made a grimace, .'''.fc1'1'- JJitopral &c.; Now the * Act ' ZS an Act without any doubt, ; And to be treated thus was rather put out, ;. :So it reddened and flustered, and turn'd sharp ' . about, ; . ? ; '\ \ ' r :1 : '. And at Gentleman Jemmy began to shout 6\. Bitooral&c; Tou *eem to forget, Sir, the mutual relation, : Between you and me in official gradation,' ' i To a * Court of Inquiry* you'll get a citation .' To answer for »uch gross insubordination. - . . : ? ...... .» ^tooraiftc' ..Said Jehraiy, with anger now .ready to burst, j ?If Tm cited I think you will come off the worst, But before I salute you may .1 be accurst '~: '' s JJnless, Sir, to me you uncover the first-i' v ' «. ! Bitooral&c; A ( Court ' was appointed by proclamation, ' -Which took all the facts in consideration, And being well-versed in complimentation ^Declared in these terms its adjudication. : ?-?:?? ? 9# - Bitooralv&c; .* We think from the case, which has now been before ' J ' '' ' ? This Worshipful Court the last three weeks or more, . ' 'That the Custom-house Officers, inandout door, Should worship the ACT from 10 daily till 4/ ? 10\. Bitooral &c; Vow Jemmy's behaviour was altered quite: Whenever the ACT appeared in sight, : i In taking bis Hat off, he took such delight, He was always uncovered from morning till night . ; ^itooral Ac. 11\. ? : ?''??: His excess of politeness now drove him wild: He took off his Hat to man, woman, and child, And even the ACT began to feel riled - At seeing this gentleman always un-tiled, 12\. Bitooral&c.; ?3uch a constant saluting his hand did maintain, That unless it was stopped he must die of the pain — He caught it and held it— but alTin rain— ! £t kept lifting and waving the Hat again, ' 13\. - ' ' iRitooralie. But Nature such efforts could never stand, And the body soon vanished from off the land : Yet sometimes e'en now on the Portonian strand, .There flickers the Ghost of a Hat in a hand. Bitooraldc. 14. Now this ghost'of a Hat in. a hand, they say, So haunts the ACT by night and by day, That it's wasting and falling to rapid decay, And under the Marine Board hides away, 1 15. ' Bitooral&c; My tale I've told, both plain and free, ? Of a man who. never polite would be, ; Yet died of excessive civility — ; Now I've done with him and his H. A.T. ' ' ' * '?'''
