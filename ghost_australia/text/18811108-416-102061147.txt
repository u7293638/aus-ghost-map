Delirium being anticipated, he is botii put >iuadori'properi; supervision, ! but poor unfortunate man wan left in darkness I to foam: and rege alone, notwithstanding tbat thu Infirmary possessed several male attendants. A female nurse named REUTEB, it is true, did visit the patient once or twice, administered an injection of morphia, and that was all. Morphia given to a m»u in this condition would have pretty much the same effect as if tlie nurse bad charged liim with gunpowder, and then applied a match. Of all known narcotics, morphia is calculated best to upBet the mental equilibrium, and this is chosen by judicious nurse RJJUTKR as a soporific lor pour BUCKLEY. After this, one is not surprised to Hud that at four iu the morning the u'urse found something wrong, aud she thus describes the finish up of this wre'ehod episode : " About 4 a.m. I released the elicit which held PETER BUCKLEY down, Then his voice went away to a whisper, and at 5 a.m. lib died." For graphic terseness an'! btevity, DIOICENS never beat this. In all probability had he been alongside nurse REUTER when poor BUOKLEY gave up the ghost he would bave altered his; famous death-soene, in " The Old Curiosity Sbop," when poor Jo dies. Quite ,apart from the absence of medical assistance, which should never be found wanting ia a public hospital, wo had here an inhumanity amongst the paid officials which it is difficult to realize, Oue mustuot blame nurse REUTER too much, ISho is only a woman, and it is not within a woman's province to attand on suoh a case as BUCKLEY'S. Whore were all the mule attendants? Two men at loast should have been told oil to watch a case of this kind. The whole facts reveal a state of things whioh is simply deplorable. Where order and care should reign supreme, we find utter carelessness and neglect joined perhaps to something worse. That a doctor should be permanently resident in an institution of this kind is iu the first instance absolutely neces sary. It is equally a matter of importance that the attendants, both mule and female, bhould have a due sense of the responsibility of their office, joined to strict sobriety.. Without this, disorder is bound to arise, and in an institution of'the kind, such a thing becomes almost.criminal. It is earnestly to be hoped that a change for the better will soon occur.
