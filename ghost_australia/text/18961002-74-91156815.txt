Dreams. \---t- Whence came ye, strange fitful forms of the night ? Ye dreams which surround us oft during our sleep. Sweet dreams of rapturous thrilling de light ! Or dark dreams of sorrow whereat we weep ! Are ye the ghosts of past thoughts long since dead ? (Our thoughts, which forsaken, died long ago?) And why do ye hauntingly move round each bed, Frowning at pleasure, and smiling at woe ? Why do ye mock us when helpers we lie ? If we are sad, then with mirth ye are rife. If we are happy, ye moan and ye sigh; Breathing sad tales of sharp sorrow and strife. Why did ye sadden my heart all last night? Was it because, ore I went to my bed, I ate with true relish and keenish delight A supper. which weighed on my chest like hot lead ? I asked whence ye came, and wherefore ye c?ayed ? 'The answer is simple,and can't be de Ilied Ye comio from a supper too heartily made; Ye lingl'--because the digestion is tried! -E.M.E. Campbell Town.
