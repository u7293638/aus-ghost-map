We were sadly perplexed in reading the following notice and Jin advertisement to the same effect, in the Carmarthen Journal: — PoSlPONKMENT OF THE CONFIRMATION. ?

We had always been accustomed to suppose that the rite of confirmation was of the utmost importance, and could not imagine what business there could be of a more pressing nature. Fearing that we might have over-rated its value, though we had been told that it would cure rheumatism and toothache, we consulted the Book of Common Prayer. But on turning to the ' Order of Confirmation,' we found that the confirmed are required to renounce the devil and all his works ; the pomps and vanity of this wicked world ; and the sin -ul lusts of the flesh ior themselves. Surely, we thought, nothing can be of more pressing importance than this ; and yet, the renouncing of the devil is actually postponed ! In proceeding, however, our bewilderment became move intense as we discovered, that the influence of the Holy Ghost is to be increased greatly after confirma tion. We could not imagine what could be more pressing than this, but it seems that there is in reality something so vastly superior to it as to cans-e its bestowal to be postponed for tin indefinite period. — Principality.
