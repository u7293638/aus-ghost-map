j CYANIDING FRUIT-TREES. TO THE EDITOR. Sir,-Replying ,to| f Another v Fruit- grower," who seeks to criticise my letter to you in re cyanlding, toe might haye, taken the trouble to read what I badi written, when, be would have avoided at least two mistakes. I simply stated a few facts, so that it is foolish to describe my letter as -misleading, and nothing to the point to accuse me of Incompetence Ia the matter of advice. I am only a learner, and It Is quite possible that " Fruit- grower" could give me not a little help ; but a caaable teacher would be less as hertivo and more demonstrative. That my trees were not larger begs the question, as it was the scale and not the trees I sought to kill. The dose upplied Is ac- cording to the capacity of the tent used, not as " Fruitgrower" seems to fancy, be- cause the tree requires it. The scale jia^j an equally .healthy appetite and good diges- tion on any sized tree, and it takes a certain strength of gas to induce him to give up the ghost, so the dose is enlarged in proportion to the cubic feet of air with which it has to mix under tents of various sizes. Further, as trees have a good deal in common with humanity, it is only reasonable to suppose that it they are in- duced to grow up healthy, they will be the better able to resist disease at ma- turity. What " Fruitgrower" says about fully-grown trees is merely a repetition of what he lni^ht have read In my letter, that " larger trees take bigger tentB and doses," and of course more labour. I trust " Fruitgrower" will come out of his shell and give us some of his experience, if he has any. So far, the only point I can Gee In his letter is the wisdom which induces i ntm to hide undor a norn de plume. -I am, &c;, ALEX. S. LANGf 7th September.
