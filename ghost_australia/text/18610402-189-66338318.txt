COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. BALLARAT LIVE STOCK MARKET. _ Saturday, 30th March. Messrs HEPBURN & LEONARD report Fat Cattle.-There has been a large supply to hand this week, consisting principally of medium quality, and a strong probability exists of the market remaining overstocked for some time, as there are large drafts at hand. Best bullocks are worth from £6 to £7 15s; best cows, from £5 to £7. We sold since Vast report 136 head, Mr Kirby's, from Mount Gambier, lightweight, fair quality, ata general average of £4; 148 head, Mr Watson's, Mount Gam- bier, middling quality-bullocks, from £4 1.5s to £5 10s; cows, £3 15s to £6. Calves sold at from £1 to £3 ; the demand was trifling. Pat Sheep.-Prime sheep have been much sought after ; best wethers are fast increasing in value ; we have sold a lot of ewes, light weights, at 9s. Lambs.-Transactions are now limited, as the season is almost at an end ; we disposed of 120at8s6d. Store Cattle and Sheep;-We have had a few enquiries this week for store cattle, and dis Cosed of a small lot, very inferior, at £2. For reeding ewes and good wethers the demand keeps up ; we could readily quit 5 to 6000 at satisfactory rates. Horses.-There has been little animation since our last report, the supply being far in excess of the demand, the market being crowded with every description of stock, conse- quently prices fell, and although a few draught horses realized good figures, still we have to report a considerable change for the worse in ' this week's quotations; really good heavy draught colt« are worth from £40 to £00 ; coachers and light harness horses from £10 to £20 ; inferior rough lots, at norn £2 upwards. We sold 10 unbroken colts, adapted for farming or coaching purposes, atan average of £ 5, and a lot of very inferior light, low conditioned horses at £3. We anticipate a much brisker demand next week, as there are no heavy lots on hand. Mr A. P. Bowes reports Contrary to what was anticipated there was a considerable improvement in the horse mar- ket this week. It has been frequently observed and as often noted, that fresh horses are easily sought after, and as one instance out of many, I may state, that almost every one of " the strangers" at this day's sale were bought up at once. There are no end of inquiries for horses of a really good character; let their class be described as saddle, light, or heavy harness. The only thing we have to do is to find them. Will this be a hint or no ? Positively speaking, , fresh stock well broken in is a desideratum at the present time. Of course circumstances at all times alter cases, and we must attend to that fact and report accordingly. It was thought the Easter holidays would interfere with trans- actions, but the result was very different to what was expected. First class draught, £70 to £90 ; second do, £40 to £55 ; whim and puddlers range from £18 to £30 ; superior hacks (scarce) £25 to £35 ; light harness horses, of a good character, the same ; ordinary hacks, £8 to £15. Drays, Spring Carts, Waggons, &c.-A; fair business has been done and more could have been accomplished were they brought forward. Argus Office, Saturday. The share market has been visited by fewer fluctuations than ordinarily falls to a week's share. For banks and insurance companies the rates are well maintained. In the import market trade has been steady and without change of importance. The escorts for the week have brought down 43,305 oz., against 46,797* oz. for the cor- responding week of Last year.

THE MTT,U3. - Melbourne, Saturday, 30th March. -The demand for flour has been some- what easier during the week. Prices, however, have undergone no change, and are steadily sus- tained. Millers'prices are-Fine flour, £18 per ton ; Haxall and Gallego, 45s per barrel ; Dun lop's, 42s per barrel ; oatmeal, £25 per ton ; bran, Is 3d to ls4d per bushel ; wheat, 7s 3d to 7s lOd per bushel. The following is from the Journal of Com- merce : Ale and Porter.-As there are now several parcels of new brew in the Bay, buyers prefer waiting for its landing; few transactions have as yet taken place, but we hear of £9 being asked for small lots. Bottled ale continues in moderate demand at from 9s to 10s according to brand and quantity. Bottled porter is rather firmer within the last few days, and may be quoted, for Byass* in good condition, at 10s 3d to 10s6d. Bacon.-We quote Sinclair's is (Joey's mid- dles in first class condition, at 9Jd to lOd, and bellies lOjd to lid. Boots and Shoes.-There is a very fair de- mand for suitable goods in good condition. Children's goods are still very scarce. Women's maintain their position, and sell readily at paying rates. Several descriptions of men's boots are also in good demand, but still not remunerative to the importer. Building Materials.-Slates are very light in stock, consequently the prices have been ad- vanced £2 to £3 per 1000. Cements cannot be readily sold. Butter.-We cannot rep»rt any improvement io the demand for this article. Since receipt of advices that only 2900 firkins were shipped for December, holders have become rather .tifier in their pretensions, and now demand lOW. It is now perfectly evident that our colonial production will be abundant for the next six months, as the hottest of the summer is now over and the grass is in first-class con- dition. In former years it has generally been quite burnt up at this season, not becoming available for feed till some months later. Canvas^Jkc.-Medium continues very difficult of sale. Three-bushel bags have been forced at auction as Iowas Ils, but generally speaking holders ask 11« Gd. Candles.-We quote Belmont« at Is 4|d, and 1 lb packets Nevas la 4 jd to is 5|<L Cheese.1-The market is very bare of good descriptions, and no other class will now be looked at by the trade. We quote prime Ched- dar, Cheshire, Double GHoster, and Wilts at Is 2d to Is 3d ; and Dunlop's at Is to Is Id. Coals.-The supply of colonial has been very limited, and prices nave advanced another Is per ton. Coffee. -There has not been any advance in price established, and quotations are, Ceylon plantation. Is, and native 10¿dperlb. Cordage and Twine.-Isle of Man Manilla, of larg« IUMJ oontinoM ia fair nqtwit at MJ 10» to £50. Flat rope has been a little more sale- able lately at prices ranging from £40 to £45. Shop twine is heavy in stock, and dull of sale. Sewing twine, prices are a little higher, we quote it Is OJdto Is Id. Fish.-Considerable demand still exists for white herrings, and half barrels are most in- quired for, but are out of the market ; firkins readily bring 10s 8d, and tins 6s 6d- Bed her- rings are as dull as ever, and cannot be quoted more than Is 6d for tins of 2 dozen. Fruit (dried).-We cannot report the slight- est improvement in any description. Transac- tions ot the most limited kind are occasionally effected, but oftener sales are pressed at auction, when only much lower rates are rea- lised. "Gram.-One arrival sold at auction for £12 10s. The consumption is very limited, but holders are steady in their demand of £13 per ton. Hams.-There are now few, if any, really prime in the market, although the demand is better than for some time back. New season's, if prime, would readily command Is Id. It is, however, difficult to move stocks now on hand even at first brands at lid to Is. Hops.-Buyers hold off, and holders are offering freely, with a tendency to press sales, and old hops have lost their nominal value, while 1859* s can be had freely at 2s to 2s 6d. Malt.-Stocks are still very light, and prices well maintained ; the price may still be given as 13s to 13s 6d. Metals.- Stocks of every description are frightfully heavy. Oilmen's Stores.- Coleman's starch, blue, and mustard are scarce. 1 lb jams, in tins, are worth 10s 6d to 11s. Salad oils in pints and A pints are still wanted. 1 lb salmon have slightly declined, and are quoted at 18s 6d. Oils and Paints.-Linseed is still heavy in stock, but prices arc a shade firmer. Castor oil in bulk is quoted 3d to 6d higher, being now worth 6s. Olive oil has been somewhat scarce, and that in drums is now quoted 6s 9d to 7s 3d. Chinese oil has improved during the month about 6d a gallon, but recent arrivals have been heavy, and the upward tendency has received a check. Kerosene is 3d higher, while parafine remains without alteration. There is no cocoanut oil in the market, j White lead is about 2s a cwt lower than at date of oin- last report. Turpentine is without alteration. _ [ Quicksilver.-There has been a spurted piece of speculation in this article, which has been bought up at from 2s ljd to 2s 6d per lb. One house is reported to have purchased to the ex- tent of 1000 flasks at these rates. There are still a few small lots which have not got into the hands of the speculator, and the holding ia nowfor2s9dto3s6d. Rice.-We cannot quote new rice at more than £18, while old is being quitted at rates, varying with age and condition, from £15 to £16 10s. Some prime samples are held for £17. Stocks are not heavy, and considerable quanti- ties of rice have been sent up country during the month, but the expectation of further ar- rivals have proved sufficient to prevent any advance in prices. Salt.-The holding of this article is all but confined to one person, and the price has been advanced about 10s per ton ; small parcels of coarse being only obtainable at £510s. Soft Goods.-The winter demand is now com- mencing, but sales as yet have been incon- siderable, the fine weather having interfered with the sale of winter goods. Many descrip- tions of fancy goods are becoming scarce, and are now saleable at moderate rates of advance. 8-4 greys and similar goods, printed druggets, green baizes, oil baizes, flannels, coburgs, and [ French merinos are all inquired for at better rates. Blankets have been inquired for, but the demand has not yet fairly set in. Clothing, notwithstanding the decrease in shipments compared with those during last year, is dull, and brings unsatisfactory rates. Tea.-Except in scented orange Pekoe, there is no reduction in any of the quotations to note, but the market is the very opposite to firm, and we believe sales of any but first qualities cannot be effected, save at a loss to importers of 15s to 20s per chest. Importers do not press sales. Low qualities remain as nearly as pos- sible perfectly unsaleable. The scarcity of scented orange Pekoe has passed away, and with it the advance obtained on account of short supplies. Timber.-There is an improvement percep- tible in many descriptions, brought about by the determination of holders and light arrivals. Buyers have resisted to the utmost, buying only for actual necessities. At present holders have the best of it, but how long it may continue so, it is difficult to say. Tobacco.-Twist, average brands are held for Is 6d, while sales cannot be effected at anything near that figure. Wines and Spirits.-Martell's is not easily procurable at 11s, pale is still very scarce and is folly worth 12s 6d ; the consumption of it ' has much increased of late. Hennessy's in case is much wanted ; its value is far before any other brand, being easily placed at 35s, while for United Vineyard or Otard not more than 30s can be got. Shipments of old vintage in bulk continue to be made to England, exporters expecting a better result than by holding or selling on the spot. In rum and whisky, a steady trade is doing, without any alteration of prices. The consumption of whole cases of geneva still continues large, and late rates remain unaltered. A sale of about 4000 oases was reported last week, but the price has not transpired. For green cases there is no inquiry. In wines but little is doing. In consequence of the peculiarity of the season there has been scarcely any demand for claret or other light wines. The following is from the Economist : Melbourne Stock and Share List.-Messrs Baillie, Butters & Co. report an active business in the stock and share market, the principal feature in which has been a very large demand for National Bank shares, at advanced rates ; Hobson's Bay Bailway, Victoria Life Insurance Melbourne Gras and Collingwood Gas are also in good demand. In mining shares Tyson's Beef and Catherine Beef have commanded the chief attention. We have effected sales in Colonial Bank's at 6i 11s and 61 10s; National Bank's, in heavy parcels, at 21 19s to 3/; Bank of Victoria, at 35Í 5s ; Collingwood Gas at 10 per cent, premium ; Geelong Gas at 31 7s 6d to 3£ 10s; Melbourne Gas at 7¿ per cent, premium ; Australasian Insurance at 30s ; Melbourne Insurance at 4s ; Victoria Life and General Insurance at 65s to 60s ; Bendigo Water Works at 27s 6d ; Provident Institute at 10s 6d; Hobson's Bay Bailway at 5QI; Mel- bourne and Suburban Railway at 6Í 10s; Catherine Beef Mining Company at 15s, 15s 6d and 16s; Clunes Company, 2°35¿ and 2i0l; Nelson's Beef, 12s 6d; Tyson s Reef, 20s to 21s; Bolinda, 10s ; Grand Junction, 7s 6d ; Long Gully and Back Creek, 4s, 4s 6d, and 5s; Mary- borough Company, 4s; M Ivor, Caledonia, 25s ; Mount Korong, Lane's Beef, 7s ; New Chum, 9s Gd; Sandy Creek, Poverty Beef, 17s 6d ; Victoria Reef, 10s. Wool.-We have to report a well sustained inquiry for both fleece and greasy, and were any lots in fail- condition offering, good prices could be obtained. The market is now bare of sup- plies of this description, the bulk of the lots coming to hand being inferior, and in very small quantities. Scoured and hand- washed wool is in better demand. There is still, how- ever, too much margin between prices offered > and cost of production to admit of any large amount of business being transacted. I Sheepskins are firm at late rates. Hides.-No change worthy of note. We have sold a few small lots of country hides at from 10s. Cd. to 13s. each. Tallow.-We have disposed of several lots, both for shipment and colonial use, at late quotations, which are as follows :-Beef, 38?. to 421, and mixed, 40¿. to 44/ ; mutton, 47'. to 501\. per ton. Stations. - On the 20th instant Messrs. Crouch and Fethers, of Portland, sold the Kangaroo Station, with 10,000 sheep, 700 head of cattle, and 30 horses, to Messrs. M'Bachern Brothers, for 11,000¿-6000Í. cash. No pur- chased land. Messrs. Power, Rutherford and Co. report : Fat Cattle-Number in, 2230 head. The sup- plies this week were much larger than usual so much so that prices fell lower than we have quoted for some time past. The quality of manv of the lots was inferior. Prime and good* second-class maintained their places well, considering the glut. Best bullocks were selling at 61 to 81 15s, very good ; second ii to bl, inferior, li 10s to 31, best cows 51 to 6c 5s, second do 21 to 41. We sold the following mobs -177 head (Mr Winter's), from the Wann-m, medium quality, 3i 7s all round ; 111 head DT cattle (Moeney's), 514s 6d, a prime lot ; 210 head (Simpson's), well bred half fat cattle, 31 8s ; 201 head (Piaka), very good, 5110s, and 17 head DT (Moone/s), at U 11s. Calves-Num- ber in, 116 head. The supply about equal to demand, prices 23s to 45s 6d- Fat sheep Number in, 10,209 head. Trade 8268, coun- try 634, shipping 837, turned out 480-total 10,209 head. Trade was pretty mir, and prime lots went off readily. The large supply was cleared more quickly than is usually the case in such a full market, at satisfactory figures. Best wethers have been selling at 16s to 17s, veryjrood ; second do 10s to 12e^ ewes H to llii We have made satos of 196 Com«* ronV 10s to Ils; 693 Waites, 13s to 14s ; 67 Parker, 10s to 11B; 809 Bell and Armstrong's, ewes Ila, wethers 14s 3d to 15s: 664 Chirnside's, 16s to 17s; 559Gibb's, 8s 6d. Lambs-Num- ber in, 288 head. The small supply caused prices to rise to Ils 7d to 11s lid. Store Cattle -There is a slightly increased demand few small lots of good well bred stores, but at Erices considerably under the figures asked by olders. We have no sales of any consequence to report. All bullocks 3£ to SI 7s 6d, spayed cows 215s to 2115s, cows 21 to 2110s, inferior li 10s to 21. Store Sheep-We have several inquiries for first quality store wethers and good breeding ewes. We could place some 10,000 or 15,000 of this description at good rates, We beg to call the attention of holders on the Murray or T-arMmr to this. Prices Wethers, four-tooth to full mouthed, 10s. to 11s. : dry ewes, 7s. to 8s. : ewes in lamb, good quality, 10s. to 12s. : maiden ewes, 10s. to 11s. We have sold-1700 head mixed, chiefly ewes in lamb, 10s : 6000 wethers, four and six tooth, ils.: and 1050wethersat9s. Deniliquin, March 28.-There have been no transactions in store cattle since our last. One fresh mob-Lester's-has arrived, and is now j near Conargo. A moderate enquiry still exists, but buyers appear to be deterred by (lie state of tiie Melbourne market, which as yet shows no signs of improvement. Some breeding ewes, a superior lot, of Mr. Petershawe's, changed bands : as also another lot of Mr. P. Osborne's, -äie price has not transpired. One lot of fat cattle crossed on the 22nd. 140 head, and two drafts, left Warbreccan to day : one of them sold to Hyde. 2000 fat wethers-Tyson's crossed yesterday.-Chas. Brown and Co. Horse Market.-Owing to the absence of fresh country lots, there has been but little doing in this market during the week. There has been about the average supply of town lots, but the reserved rates have been fixed above buyers' prices, and but few sales have conse- quently been effected. The few good unbroken stock brought in have sold readily at fair rates, and for this description is iu excess of the supply. Flour, Grain, &c-;(Review for month ending 25th March.)-^ince the departure of the last English mail the corn market has maintained a steady position ; and, as far as breadstuffs are concerned, have considerably advanced in prices. Horse-feeding grain remains without altera- tion to note ; malt still advances ; potatoes and other esculents are most abundant, and prices rule low. The weather has been fine, with alternate hot winds, followed by heavy rains, during the past week, which has enabled farmers to proceed with field opera- tions, the early sown wheat having yielded the best return last season. The question of protection to native industry is still being agi- tated in some of the agricultural districts, but does not gain strength ; while the proposition of imposing import duty and wharfage dues on corn, flour, potatoes, &c.;, by the Government i in January last, met with so much opposition I as to cause the immediate withdrawal of the measure. Flour-Imports since the 1st instant consist of about 1300 tons from South Australia, and 100 tons from California. From our ora sua-board and Tasmania sup- plies have been sparing, which have moved off freely as landed, to supply town as well as country orders-the latter still con- tinuing for the better class of imported sorts ; while parcels have been exported to New Zea- land and New South Wales, to which latter co- lony 250 tons of Adelaide, Chilian, and United States barrel have gone. These operations checked the downward tendency noticed last month, and which has boen followed by an ad- vance of fully 30s per ton all round. The Otto, from San Francisco, has just arrived at Sydney with 400 tons flour, and reports the likelihood : of further shipments from California, which to all appearances will come to a better market than might have been anticipated. This arrival does not appear to affect that market, closing quotations being-for Adelaidesorts 18¿tol8¿10s; ftarf s & Magarey's superfine, Val ; Tasmanian, Victorian (town and country) 17110s. Chilian and Californian being cntirelv out of first hands is held for 17/ per ton of "2000 lbs; United States 38s to £40s, while such brands as Haxall, Gallego, and Dunlop's are worth 42s per barreL Wheat-Imports since the 1st instant consist of about 15,000 bushels from South Australia, 2500 bushels from Tasmania, and 6500 from our own seaboard. The wet harvest has had the effect of damaging the color of a portion of tho crops grown in this colony, while in some districts, owing to heavy floods and the want of sufficient labor, quantities have suffered to such an extent as to render it unfit for milling pur- poses ; in some instances complaints are made without cause, however; estimating the loss at a considerable item in quantity produced it will be seen that very large supplies will yet reach miller's hands, and especially so were the mar- ket likely to assume a downward tendency. In Tasmania extensive parcels are said to have been bought on Melbourne account, while the continued demand in the South Australian market for export to this and neighboring colo- nies causes some excitement. Closing quota- tions, 7s. to 8s. per bushel of 60 lbs. Oats Imports fall off but supplies are ample from our own productions : although the color is not equal to the average of former crops, yet they are found good enough for all purposes, and they will go far to supply our consumption for months. There is a slightly better feeling noticeable for sweet and sound parcels of im- ported sorts, but prices can scarcely b3 said to improve, as Government have found parties willing to supply them with large quantities at a price equal to 2s 5d per bushel. Any good parcels of Californian, purchaseable at and under 3s 6d, have found buyers ; some new Calcutta have been sold at 3s, while Colo- nial have receded fully 4d per bushel. Closing quotations are-Scotch and Irish, 2s to 3s ; Dutch and Danish, 3s to 3s 3d ; Californian, 3s 4d to 3s 6d ; Colonial, 3s 9d to 4s per bushel of 40 lbs. Barley-The supplies are light ; the demand increases for Cape for seed, while few transactions result as yet in English malting ; the former may be quoted at 5s 6d to 6s 6d; the hitter at 6s to 7s per bushel of 50 lbs. Maize This grain has run up in price, and the con- sumption has fallen off in consequence. Supplies of foreign grown will probably reach here soon. Closing quotations, 6s fld per bushel of 56 lbs. Gram-A small parcel to hand was quitted at 12210s per ton of 2240 lbs ; but the price, being considered high, limits its consumption also. Bran-Supplies are not in excess of the demand or consumption, yet prices rule low. Quotations cannot be made over Is 3d per bushel of 20 lbs. Oatmeal is in fail request ; but prices rule at such rates as leave no margin for importations. Imported sorts may be quoted at 18Í to 19¿ ; colonial, at 25i per ton of 2240 lbs. Malt - Im- ports are very moderate. Colonial is well worked out, and imported sorts sell at extreme rates ; the closing price for English being 13s 6d to 14s per bushel of 40 lbs. Hay-Hydrau- lic pressed hay will most probably be imported to some extent this season; some par- cels to hand from South Australia have realised '¡I to 71 10s per ton. Potatoes -Supplies are abundant, and prices rule low. Victorian grown, 3s 10s to ii per ton of 2240 lbs, while a parcel from Circular Head (Tasmania) did not realise H. Onions are abundant, and can be obtained at 3110s to U per ton of 2240 lbs. Imports for February, 1861, ascompared with February, 1860 :- j 1861\. 1860. Bushels. Bushels.

Imports are light, and a steady demand works off any flour coming to hand. "Horse feed is unaltered. ; and upon the whole, prices remain the same as at the close of last week. Estimated imports of flour and grain at the Port of Melbourne from 21st March to 27th March, inclusive : Flour.-South Australian, 225 tons ; Tasma- nian, 10 tons ; Victorian (coastwise), 60 tons.
