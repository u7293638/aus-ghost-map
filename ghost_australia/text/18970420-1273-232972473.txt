DUNDAS ELECTORATE. ESPEHANCE, April 18. Mr. ConoIIy's candidature for tbe Dundas district as an independent candidate iB progressing well. A strong committee of leading men has been formid. Mr. Conolly is a firm supporter of a direct Esperance- Norsemau railway, one man one vote, a free breakfast table, and, if necessary, he would replace the revenue thus remitted.by a tax upon incomes over £3,003. He also advocates the establishment of model and experimental farms. Mr. Arthur "Austin, Mayor of Norseman, spoke at Esperance on Saturday. He prac- tically repeated his Norseman address, and made a vehement attack on the Ministry. He was afforded a fair hearin?, but a vote of confidence was not passed, the candidate being thanked for bis address only. Mr. B. A. Hamey has arrived. He speaks to-night. Mr. Harney's candidature is very unpopular. It is considered that he lias been foisted on the constituency by Coolgardie to make room for Mr. Morgans, l he full report of whose -manifesto is now received. Great indignation is expressed at his only .advocating a railway from Coolgardie to Norseman, without reference to Esperance. Mr. Harney is not likely to receive, a favorable hearing, especially seeingthat his policy is identical with that of Mr. Morgans. Mr. Anstin in bis speech, stated that, if elected,Mr. Morgans would be the leader of the goldfields party,-and probably, would be made Minister of Mines. If Mr. Harney does not advocate "i tbe gold fields parly » line from Esperance to Coolgardie, be has - not tbe ghost of. a clianoe, and hei is merely splitting Mr, Con-1 nolly^ votes. ' : 1
