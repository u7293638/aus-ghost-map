.THE FORSAI(EN FARMHOUSE. Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of n dead homec, stnring through Its broken lights on wastedlnuds Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe inshorn, I he poor forsaken farmfllelds lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthfltl herb and floiwer berelt, The garden plot ns honsewife keeps; Through weeds and tangle only lcft T'lh snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilea spray, once blossom.cland, Sways bare before the empty rooms; esilde tho' roofless porch a nod, lPathetic red rose blooms. IIis track, in mould of dust and strouth, On floor andl heatits the squirrel leaves, And in the lireless chimney's mouth Ilis web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Ilesonlds no mlore on husking eves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresher beats his sh:nves. So sad, so drear I It seems almost Some Ihaunnting spirit makes its sign; Thai, dbwn yon sh ldowy lane some ghost' Might drive his spectral Idne. -,J. 0. \tmrITIIcn.
