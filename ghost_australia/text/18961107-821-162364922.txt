CUP DAY. Melbourne, November 3. "An idea] Cup Day, with a magnificent vic tory for the favourite." Thus may be summed up the great Australian sporting event of the year. More beautiful weather has not pre vailed on any forme- day on which the Mel bourne Cup has been run, and never before have the surroundings of the Flemington Course been so agreeable. JSarly morn and throughout the day there was a clear azure sky, and while the sun shone forth in all his splen dour the heat was gently tempered by cool southerly breezes. The atmosphere was thoroughly invigorating, and such as to put every one in good heart and in an appreciative mood as to the beauties of spring. Sta ely Spring' whose robe folds are valleys, Whose breast bouquet is gardens, And whose Muib is a vernal evening. The -fair sex had no misgivings as to what might be safely and appropriately worn on the occasion. Ladies of fashion put on their muslins or most delicate and costly gowns, their most refined and attractive bonnets, and elevated sunshades of brilliant and variegated tints. The weather with which they were to be favoured for dis playing their charms was a certainty from the first. It was typical of the race. Newhaven, the winner of the Derby, who was so much fancied for the more important event, and carried a great proportion of people's money, presented himself on the course in grand form, and from the start to the finish the issue did not admit of a single doubt. He took the lead with a powerful stride, and kept lengths ahead of his field all round the course, finishing up in as grand fashion as has ever been witnessed. The enthusiasm of the on lookers was undoubted, and on ail sides the exclamation was heard, "A worthy successor to old Carbine." The attendance on the course must have been between 80,000 and 100,000, and was certainly better than it has been for four years. "The Grand Stands were packed. On the hill the people swarmed like bees, and the flat was also particularly well patronised. The spectacle was impressive and well worth j witnessing. The course was clothed in its most vernal garb, and was in perfect condi tion, and every concomitant co-operated to ; make theday*# anting thoroughly pleasant. The arrangements tor the confeyaace of all ihMtt ta fte wane, and tbeir aoaommbda tioO^ when there, were excellent, and many fashionable lunching partial in the carriage enoioarure caald hot Sav-a been held under more favourable auspices. The gathering was, of course, a represen tative one, including many visitor* from iiouth Australia and tbe othor aolomes, and ,was under the usual viceregal patronage. Lord and Lady Brassey were accompanied by the Governor of Western Australia, Sir Gerard Smith, Lady Smith, and Mias Smith; by Vis coudtess Hampden, wife of the Governor of New South Wales, and by other vis tors who are staying at Government House. The viceregal party drove up to the Grand Stand accompanied by an escort, of Mounted Rifles. Series of photo graphic impressions were secured by means of an improved Lnmiere cinematographs, and views were also taken of the gathering and races for exhibition at the Empire Theatre, London, and the continental theatres, where this wonderful apparatus will be on exhibition. After thea great event of the day there was not such an immediate rush for the trains as is very often the ease when somedespised outsider has upset the calculations and brought apile of money to the betting ring. In the Grand Stand enclosure there was a general movement j along tiie lawn to the Stewards' Stand to await the result of the weighing-in and to cheer the winning jockey. On the flat the same thing was observed, and the crowd there resembled very touch a disturbed anthill. It has been said'' that chance is a scapegrace, who in all his life never did a proper action." This may apply to many a Melbourne Gup, but not to that of 1896. Newh&vcn; has demonstrated himself to be no child of chance, and the news of his legitimate triumph will be welcomed from one end of Australia to the other. THE RACING. It will be aJong time before tbe laeJbourno Cup of 1896 is forgotten, as Newhaven's vic tory will be noted as the most celebrated ever secured in the big two-mile event of Australia. He not only eclipsed all previous performances by oarrying 7 St. 13 lb. to the front as a three-year-old, but he literally romped home by half a dozen lengths ahead of his held, whom be bad all well beaten a mile from borne; in short, the race can be described ae a procession, with Newhaven first and the rest nowhere. It was a marvellous feat, and stamped the winner as the greatest colt Australia has ever produced, not even ex cepting Carbine. Naturally tbe victory of tbe Nowminster colt was wonderfully popular, the vast crowd which bad assembled at FlemingtOn beginning cheering when the horse was a furlong from home, while the scene was remarkable as the post was reached,- intense enthusiasm being manifested. Hats were thrown into the air, ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and tbe crowd tumbled oyer each other to get a glimpse of the winner on his returning to scale. Newhaven's suooess was of course a severe blow to the Ring, as the colt has been consistently backed from the issue of the weights, and among those who profited by bis success are a number of well-known South Australians. The proceedings opened with the Hurdle Race, for which a favourite was found in Manazona, while Carlsruhe was the next in demand, Manazona. who carried Brewer, shaped very badly, but Carlsruhe ran in front till the last hurdle, where he stumbled badly and lost his place. Merrigal was in company with Mr. Hales's horse here, and though he also pecked the obstacle ho had too much pace for Tertius in the run home, and beat him by throe-quarters of a length. Merrigal, who was recently successful at Randwick, at the A. J.C. Meeting, has proved himself a topsawyer at the game. In spite of all his weight Lieutenant was voted the best of the contestants in the Railway Handicap, though 5 to 1 on the field was on offer up to the rising of tbe barrier. The 8ydnev horse made a bold bid for victory under his big weight, but he just failed to catch another New South Wales representative in Armenia, who was a rank outsider, scarcely any member of the Ring writing his name. Paul Pry again ran prom inently, and made a dead heat for second place with Lieutenant, but Princess of Wales never had a chance. Armerfra is an English-bred horse, having been imported by Mr. S. Hor dern. During the race Cohort, when look ing dangerous at the distance, unseated his rider, who had to be carried in in the ambu lance van, but he was not seriously injured. Backers had not made an auspicious open ing, but Key looked such a good thing for the Kensington Stakes that they did not hesitate to lay odds on her. Fortune, however, onoe more favoured the fielders, as when tho barrier was raised the favourite turned the other way and took no part in the contest. With her out of the road the race proved a good thing for The Elder, who defeated his stable com panion St. Winnoch easily. Both first and second youngsters were bred at Morphettville, and St. Winnoch carried the colours of Mr. T. Barr Smith, who was present to see him run. The Stewards held an enquiry into the per formance of Key, but nothing was done, as the Starter exonerated the rider, saying that it was not his fault, as she slipped round the other wav. Key is the filly in connection with which Hayes has been reported to the V.R.C. Committee for not attempting to get away in a race run at a suburban meeting recently. The scratch ings for the Cup were not nume rous. Lord Granville has been running so badly since his arrival at Flemington that Mr. Porter thought it useless starting him, and for the same reason the owner of Sabre tache withdrew his colt. The only other absenteo was The Officer, Mr. Cook electing to rely upon The Merry Boy, who had the services of Huxley. The saddliDg- paddock was crowded by those anxious to see the candidates undergo their final toilet. New haven had the largest levee, and it was generally admitted that Hickenhotham had J him very well. In the early part of the after noon 5 to 1 was procurable about him, but the public came so strongly for him that at the finish nothing better than 4's was procurable. Mr. W. R. Wilson started his three horses, but Resolute was the only one which attracted attention. Ho was, looking all the better for his Derby gallop, and the stable were confident that they would turn the tab'es upon Ncwhaven, but in spite of this he was easer in the market, being quoted at 12. A candidate who came with a rattle on the course was Devon, and he was a decided second favourite, while Marnsa held his overnight' price. No horse stripped better to the eye than Broken Hill, but he had no credentials to win such a race, while Bloodshot and The Skipper shaped so indifferently on Saturday that they were comparatively neglected. Quite a nnmber of Adelaide people backed Miraelum simply because they were told to do so. None of the touts bad seen him working, but it was stated on what should have been good authority that the horse had donÂ© some good gallops in private, and was sure to be dangerous. It was understood in the morn ing that Gough was to have ridden him, but eventually Thomas was put up. The Chevalier, whose reign as first favourite was short and merry, went eat of favour, but Hopscotch and Dis6gured both had numerous friends. Disfigured first came out into the straight, but merely went slowly, it being left to Charge to show the way down the straight. He was followed by the St, Albans trio, Besoltxte wearing a blue band and Nada a red one, and then in quick succes sion came Dreamland. Pivot, Preston, Devon, and Mewbaven, while the last two were Duhallow and Miradum, the South Australian representative not coming further than the Judge's box. Mr. W&tson; did uot keep them long at the post, and the barrier was lifted to a beautiful start, which took place at the top of the straight. Dreamland was the first to be signalled out from Broken Hill, Preston, Devon, Disfigured, and Nowhaven, and as they came to the course proper the Ballarat I horse was clear of PreBtcrn, Devon, Damien, I The Chevalier, and Newbaven, while Miradum was already last. Canoona shot out at the dm | tance, but at the half-distance a cry announced I that Newhaven was in front, and as be went past the Grand Stand two lengths ahead of his field it was apparent that the same tactics were to be adopted as in tbe Derby, and that he would endeavour to win the race, from end to end. . He carried his field along the river side of the course at such a bat that before the mile-post a number of bis opponents were thus early holding out signals of distress, while it was taking the ottiers all their time to keep within a reasonable distance. At this stage he had an advantage of four lengths, but before the shed was reached he had actually ' doubled that, to the complete astonishment of everybody on tbe course. His nearest atten dants here were Resolute, Trentham, and Dreamland, the last-named having always held good berths, aud they were ail bard at it , endeavouring to get on terms with the leader. I They, however, could not materially decrease the gap, and Dreamland gave the chase up at the home turn. His placo was taken by Blood shot, who, passing Resolute in tbe straight, set sail aftorthefavourite; butit was all tono pur pose, Gardiner coming on as be did in the Derby and winninar on Newhaven amidst intense excitement by half adozen lengths. The Skipper deprived Resolute of third honours, but nothing in the race had a ghost of a chance with New haven, who could easily have put. up a record time had he been pressed. Roka was fifth, with Dam ion, who ran well, next; but, as I anticipated, Broken Hill was never dangerous, never being seen near the van after the first furlong had been traversed. Miraclum, who should have been kept in his box. took his place in the rear very early in the nunt, and there he struggled on, finishing a bad last I saw Gardiner after the race, and he told me that at the poet lie was about tenth from the rails. He got away fairly well, Bloodshot and Canoona being close to him. He was running about fourth or fifth until within half a furlong from the Judge's box, when Newhaven was pulling a bit bard, and as he had not the slightest doubt about the colt's ability to keep in front all the way he let him go and sailed along. He added, " That is all X can tell you, as I never saw anything more of them. I should not have taken the liberty of forcing the running was I not sure that New haven was equal to the task. I really rode a waiting race m front." Gardiner, who is twenty-four years of age, originally started his career in Walter Hickin botbam's stable, after which he was with R. j McKenna and H. Yeond. He then went I to Sydney, and, riding for John Allsopp, j was on Oremorne when ho won the Doncaster | Handicap and All Aged Stakes and on ! Trenchant in the A.J.G. Derby and Gity j Handicap. He only wont back to Hieken j botharn last August, find in the short interval ! has appropriated the A.J.G. Sydney Spring j Stakes, Craven Plate, and V.R.C. Derby, and I now the Melbourne OiJp on Newhaven. It , is likely that Newhaven will be sent to , England after the next March meeting, i The excitement having subsided over the j big race, backers turned their attention to the Nursery Handicap, and flushed by thoir suc j cess over the favourite's victory in the Gup j they brought Keera down to a very short , price. The brother to Destiny made a big : fight under his injavy impost, loading to the j half- distance, then he failed, though ho only 1 just missed gaining a situation. The winner I was supplied in Hypnotist, who beat the out I sider Hymettus by three-quarters of a length, while the unlucky Fleet Admiral was half a length off third. Moore appeared to take things very easily on Hymettus from the distance, it beinsf the general impression that he could have won, and after the race ho was called before thy Stewards, and charged with suspicious running. His explanation was, however, accepted as satisfactory. There was a great rush to get on to Man of Honour in the YaÂ« Yean Stakes, and he was backed down to 3 to 1. The run on Mr. Rcd foarn's representative enabled the followers of the St. Albans stable to secure a healthy price about Merman. The favourite was never in the hunt, and Merman rewarded Mr. Wilson with his first win, which was well received, as he has been out of luck. Merman only just got home, however, otter a great battle with the smart Gmder Ellen, catching he* on tho post in the last stride, and beating her by half a head. HLTBDr.E RACE.

Dreamland, Marusa, and Broken Hill were the first-to break Hie line from _ Preston, Dis figured, and The Chevalier, with Mlraculum last. Coming over the tan Duhaliow, Broken Hill, and Devon were showing conspicuously at the head of Dreamland, but at the course proper Damien and The Chevalier took com mand, with Dreamland and Preston heading Newhaven. Canoona rushed to the front at the distance from Droamland, but at the half-distanco Gardiner brought the favourite through, and settling down at the head of his field he led them three lengths past the Stand from Canoona and Dreamland, who were together just clear of Preston, Trontham, and Resolute, with Devon, Damien, and Charge fallowing in the order , named, tho rear being brought up by Miraolum. Running along the river side of the course Newhaven was .opt fonr lengths from Canoona and Dreamland, after whom came Preston, Resolute, and Devon on terms, with Trontham and The Chevalier dearof the next division, Miraclum still acting as whipper-in along way off. New haven still held his ad van t ago at the milepost, where Resoluteran up to Dreamland, a length separating the pair from Canoona and Devon, who had as their nearest attendants Preston, Tire, Marusa, and Pivot, the last two being Disfigured and Miraolum. The positions of the leaders had not been altered at the bridge, and at tho abattoirs the favourite drew still further away, there being a gap of five lengths between him and Resolute, who had been joined by his stable companion Tron tham, and then followed Droamland, Damien, and Devon, At the sheds Newhaven was eight lengths clear of the field, and tho race was considered all over. Though Dreamland, Resolute, Trontham, and Damien were at the head of those chasing tho runaway. Resolute was the seoond to make the homo turn, while Bloodshot bad taken third place, and he was followed by Damien and Dreamland. The favourite bowled into the straight well clear of everything, and though Bloodshot went after hint from thedistanee^ the effort was absolutely futile, and the Newminster colt won by half a dozen lengths, The Skipper, being two and a half lengths behind Bloodshot, third, with Resolute three-quarters of a length off fourth. Then followed Reka, Damien, Tire, Devon, Dreamland, Nada, Marusa, Rosella, Broken Hill, The Chevalier, and Trentham as named, the last lot being Dis figured, Canoona, Hopscotch, Pivot, and Miraclum.
