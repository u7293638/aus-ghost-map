The evil, siniz? rfface of tho wretch took on a pitying look, as he saw the fairgirl'e extreme terror, and with a re?sacring voice, he said, as he, too, moved a stop or two from her : "I will do ye no harm, fair lady, so do not fear.

But she was doomed to Dsappoin-ment, for during breakfast lord Callonby pro posed an excursion to ttlyby Toweor, a place of some renown, shoot ten miles distant, where they would spend the day picnicking, and exploring the grounds and buildings, and then ret-.n home by moonlght. The proposal met with instant applauos from all parties, for M Loybury Towers h d a tragic interest connected with it, and. among other things, i was said that the tower itself was haunted by the restless ghost of a young and lovely duchess, who was murdered on her wedding night, only threo hours after her marriage. by an nn knowt hand. This of itself was srSieirnt to inspire the least romantic with enthorfasm, while the pro pert of the ride home by moon light brought a deeper tint to the cheek of more than one fair maiden, and a ten der light to the bright eyes whieh drooped cornsiously beneath the glances of anticipation bent upon them by several young gentlemen of high degree, who would doubtle-s act ar ercorts upon the oretrion. B.t ?iadgo had no heart for it; she was eager to solve the mighty mystery in which be was so deeply intereted ; besides, she was wearied out, and needed rest, and did not feel equal to the effort of zmakig herelf agreeable and onfertnin ing, orp rtend to enjoy wiat would only be irkaome and tedious to hebxr. She remembered also her promres to that suffering wretch in the grotto, and her sympathfeo were more with Sht than with any prospect of pleasure for the present Yet she kaew the encursion was pamnned partly in honor to herself, and it would be ungrateful and impolite to refrso to go, or to do anything to mar the enjoymrnt of others. So she con cealed her disappointmene as best she could, and aniented to every arrangement which his lordship saw fit to make. She resolved to spea to her father, howe- err, as soon as seron? tst should be ended, and ask him to azange for her to remain at Callonby, if poesiblo; but he it=oee atoly became engaged in conera. tion with several gentlemen upon arising feom the tablo, wh;ich render-? th-t pl.n imp?ctieablo ; an, , so-:r iece, a bevy of young tldice gathered around, and occcu pied her attention until Lord Caliouby, who had left the room o fort moments before, returneod ad anid : "Coem, lodies and gentlemecn; the carrisage and hoeea will be t thoe door in a very few ninutes, anod thioao of you who prefer to go an horzeback me?t arrange it with each other at once."
