THE MANURE DEPOT. f To the Editor of The Herald. Sir, — I was glad to see your article lately on the subject of the manure dopot in North Melbourne. It is hardly necessary at tb'" time of day to enter into a discussion as to the probability of such a scheme as Mr. Wood ward's being carried out. Tho effrontery of tha proposition Is the more conspicuous as it pro poses to continue a nuisance that tbe Inhabitants of North Melbourne have just got rid of, and "fc from which they have been suffering for many yesrs. One would think that the good sense f / the Government might have saved them from th f Insult of making this proposal a public question, and also from tbe necessity of celling a pnblto meeting to protest against this monstrous propo sition being carried out. . Walking the other day through the Royal Park, I could not help think ing that the whole corner occupied by th. old depot and the Port Phillip Society's sbow-ynrtfo was an eyesore to tbe locality. As tbe depot is now defunct, and as the society seems to be on the point of giving np the ghost, could not th ,y' whole ground be added to the park, and thus ire- " Hove the neighbourhood of n most unsightly spot, and the inhabitants of Hotham from the memory of one of the feulost nuisances that has aver existed fa Mribourne. — Yours faithfully. North Melbourne. W "N-.
