"I will give your Honor a description of that too if you will not be angry." "Iwill not," said the Mavor, " if you do not term me to be a knave." "The greatest knave that I know Is the ooustable who brought me here." "I do not know." said the Mayor, " if he is the greatest knave, but I know he is the greatest fool." " When I count how many spots there are in a pack of cards I find three hundred and sixty five, as many days as there are in a year. When I count the number of cards in a pack I find fifty-two-the num ber of weeks in a year. I find there are twelve picture cards in a pack, representing the number of months in a year; and in counting from ace to king I find thirteen cards, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see my pack of cards is Bible, Almanac and Oommon Prayer' book,
