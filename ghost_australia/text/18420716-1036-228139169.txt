MEDICAL TESTIMONY. i; I have for the last twenty years, paid much attention to the effects produced on the human frame, by. alcoholic drinks, and under almost every variety of climate and circumstance ; aud the result of my experience is this : — I never knew a man in health, benefited by their habitual use, in any quantity, and when taken, i i Avhat is commonly considered moderation, »a y three or four glasses of wine a day, or a pint of ale, they are in my opinion, always \ productive of much injury, and the occasion of premature death to thousands and tens of tliou- I sands of the human race, a It is the invariable effect of every kind of 1 alcoholic drink, to excite the system above, and then to depress it below the natural standard of health ; and I would as soon believe that these states of the system, can be induced daily by these drinks, even in the most moderate de gree, without bringing disorder and disease in their train, as I would believe, that I might hold my finger in the flame of a candle, and escape with impunity. Their effects are poi sonous, as much as are the effects of opium, prussic acid, or corrosive sublimate. Talk of their strength-giving .properties, — they are in truth, poisonous diffusible stimulants, which in the very smallest quantities do but tend to irri tate and disturb the healthy action of every organ .of the body ; and the immoderate use of which, is daily making idiots of the most ta lented, — filling our asylums with madmen — our jails with thieves and vagabonds, and our hospitals with sick ; and entailing on the pos terity of all who use them, disease of both body and mind, even unto the third generation. If our legislators could but see a thousandth part of the miserable ghosts of men, women, and children, which present themselves to medical men, and all through the effects of these vile beverages, instead of taxing necessary articles of life, they would tax, trebly tax, every spe cies of alcoholic drink; nay, they would do more, they would earnestly set about banishing it from our beloved r.nnnt.rv.
