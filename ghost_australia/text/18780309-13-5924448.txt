A LOOK AT CANTON. No. II. Ah Kim's determination to do no walking about Canton was very vexing I specially thought so when he brought up two pairs quite next day, seemingly as a matter of course " Is}Oiirunklo no better? ' I queried "No ! cannot walk ' ' He said this with an immediate reference to Ina gold watch It was evident that the possession of that article had much to do with his general ideas he looked at it, not to know the time, but to *. settle all questions generally The walk with property like that in his possession, indeed I Ah Kim wore his finger nails every four- operas! inch In China that is done to indicate that the possessor of the fingers does no work with his hands, similarly to the small foot indicating that the owner does no walking N. hen Ah Kim exhibited his watch he took care also to show his finger nails to the best advantage Of this hideous deformity he was most unwarrantably proud I doubt if any European could get so elevated in mind on uncut finger nails They were always, too, a nuisance to him, interfering with all the movements of his hands He entered it, however, for fashion's sake, as folks do the modern torture of high boot heels " Very well, then you will ride and I shall Galle can see nothing when shut up in those alarming Send away the one you mean for my use ! This satire on his family did not seem to But his feelings, but I was strong on the subject, and the second palanquin was sent away Being on foot, I was master of the situation for the day, and could stay) where I pleased, and for long or short time - using An Kun in his cup board merely for reference now and then in this style we went to see the great water clock of Canton It is not relied upon now, as formerly, for time telling purposes, but it keeps its count of the minutes and hours as accurately) as ever It differed Avath my time only two minutes Ali Khan had his watch out at once, and held it now altogether exposed Such an exhibition opportunity was not to be lost "With that watch the clock differed nothing It was no doubt keeping correct Canton time Its construction seemed simplicity itself 'three large barrels were set on end-all of them at a height of 3ft call from the other I Torn bamboos inserted in the bung holes, the water from the highest barrel dribbled to the next, and from that to the lower one 'The head of that one was removed In its water floated, uprightly, a graduated metallic scale like to the face of a thermometer, on which the 24 hours were marked As the water increased this indicator marked its progress and the hour next to be reached and colored over 'the upper barrel of the three held the exact quantity of water that would dribble out and into the lower one in 24 hours At the expiration the water would cease to run, and the indicator be covered with water The low cr barrel would then be emptied into the upper one, and business begin again Three patient Chinamen superintend this timekeeper and watch their hours thus dribbling away In former times it was death to any one of them that was found to be sleeping out of his turn A graduated Eand-gUaa would have been a much better article than this water clock, but the hour class was not a Chinaman's idea Of fears the Chinamen makes much It appears to be blown in egg shaped pieces of very large size and very thin quality At none of the places where I saw glass working going on were any flat sheets of it to be seen Out of these large glass bubbles, as they appeared to be, the artisans were cutting pieces of different sizes for purposes, I think, of fan ornamentation and toy mirror making, when the glass should be silver ered The temple of the laughing Buddha is one of the curios of Canton I was however, quite full of this figure, whether with laugh his face or not. I had seen Buddhas all through the East everywhere, and could draw the figure on a wooden wall with a red hot poker with my eyes shut After the grand Buddha figure seen at Kamakura, in Japan, in its 50ft high sublimity, all other Buddhist figures were insipid so told or silver smiths' shops were seen by me anywhere in Canton They exist, no doubt somewhere about the city, in places where no wares are shown to the public eye but kept, as in most Eastern cities, locked up in boxes and drawers, and exhibited only at visitors' request The Jade market was the personal ornament of Canton Business is over there at 100 clock am I reached it at its busiest bare shortly before its closing for the day, and before the beginning of the festival of the Chinese new year, when every one must look far, or as near to it as coloured clothes and ornaments will help Jade is a green vi bite stone of watery appearance, a sort of state malachite or malachite agate The Chinese act great value on this stone, all sorts of ornaments are made of it-comb bul s nuts and earrings A Chinese woman must be very poor indeed who has not made earrings Vi here want has really reached to that low depth imitation glass jade work has to be substituted The wearer is, how ever unhappy with this substitute, which to a Chinese eye is seen at once to be but units lion A foreigners eyes do not so soon detect it Hundreds of shops and stalls were open in this Canton jade market, and trade seemed to be brisk The articles were, however, in European ideas all much too expensive Jade is not by any means so pleasant-looking a stone as the green stone of New Zealand. It looks a commoner thing altogether Yet double the price asked for greenstone in New Zealand is asked in Canton for this jade stuff When Canton was taken by the English in 1809, much of this jade was taken away on foot by the soldiers, but it failed to find favour in any but Chinese eyes, and brought no fortune sold I think for farthings elsewhere In Canton, as throughout India and the East generally, are stalls for the sale of the betel nut chewing preparation It is a compound of nut, green leaf, and a stuff called Gambier with a little lime and tobacco added This abomination, rolled in the green leaf, is Bold in balls at four for a penny, or its equal talent It makes a red mixture when chewed, and gives to all the men and women who use it-about half the people-the appearance of having a bleeding mouth It blackens and destroys the teeth The chewing of this Bluff and the smoking of opium are Bad vices of the Chinese Tobacco chewing, like to anufftakmg is disappearing in Great Britain, but the Chinaman is not open to reform He is by religion a fatalist, and would answer ' elie ann same" to all arguments intended for his good if he did not he would probably ask for the loan of idol as a test of one's interest in his welfare At the further side of the city from the river is to be found the five stoned pagoda It stands on the ramparts, and on the 1 highest ground within Canton It is a stiff walk to reach it, but the view from the summit over city and suburb, repays the toil Looking outwards from the city side is to be BP i a stretch of green country for miles all, ed with graveS I am looking here J' I -cemetery of Canton Ah Kim, with finger and long claw of a nail extended, Points out to me the grave of his father-re wiring to his watch to be quite accurate as M the locality. It cost him this grave, he '? said Â£70 These ancestral tombs are often "visited by deceased H kith and kin Here about they are shaped like three large horse SHOCK laid on a slope In the middle of the second one is the door within which the coffin has been placed A semicircular court Jitd of life or SO across is thus sit in front and below, and also above, and at the rear of the entrance Tasty stone, work in many instances makes these gen, es of a very neat appearance They satisfy one s JUCAS about tombs Chinese civilisation looks well in all matters connected with death and the tomb, respect to parents, and Veneration of ancestry The) are ahead in J loaemntters of all mankind They are fond of weir children, and cling to them until pro perty forced them to sell their clothing The Children are not sold until all else is gone Bill Ah Kim I go to a Cb nese tea house to Imre a midday meal He tells me I shall not like it, but I have taken many meals of that sort more so than of any other It is their time in Canton The tea house 11," to in three stories high, and each floor is open us a rest Durant The staircase and nails are in well carved Booda of dark colour The house 01 recently has been a costly one I am, in the second floor, had to sit at a little table for two in a room in which 30 or 40 are sum hurt) seated A cup and saucer are brought to me '1 ca is thrown into the cup, and hot water poured upon it. The saucer is then placed over it, and the tea left to " draw " A tin) full of confectionery and sweetmeats is next brought, and I am left to choose from a dozen places that are thus set before me One of them proves to he eatable " try all things, and hold fast to that which is good, occurs to me, and I get the plate replenished 'Die teacup I now find to be half full of tea leaves The Chinese eat drink their tea scalding hot, but I have to saucer mine, for the AI weather is too hot to let me hope of its speedy cooling in the cup No milk or sugar is supplied, but I had learnt in Japan to take tea next 1 had that teacup refilled five times Canton investigation is thirst) work with the thermometer at 88 of a moist heat Everybody in the room seemed to be tobacco smoking with pipe or cigar, eating and drink ing at the same time I he repast was a light one, rice cakes and tea Ididuiongaftcrnoous walk upon it, which testified its suitability to the climate In these tea houses, and in the steamboats, pleasure boats, hotels, and elsewhere, fire sticks are always to be found with a smouldering end to them They are made in walking stick lengths of some pithy matter, and look and feel like to Bricks of compressed brown paper A walking stick length, broken up into six pieces, provides for a weeks want of matches All cigars and pipes are lighted at these sticks Kimmel would, of course, add perfume to them, and then incense would seem to burn in all houses As con grove matches are gradually being introduced in China, these fire sticks may go out of use in the Hurt and steel days of Great Britain such sticks, (Munja burning then slow length along, would have been welcome-would have suA ed much knuckle knocking and probable profanity All day has Ah Kim been anxious to take me to the execution ground, which he evident reads us something good in the way of sights I have asked him if anyone is to be decapitated there, and he has said " No till next u eek-then 20-) or stop I have explained to him that the attraction is not great enough, also, that an empty execution ground is only a vacant piece of ground, and to me nothing to look at 1 explain to him also that I am ignorant of the great and good who may have suffered therewith the beastly and the bad, and that there are no associations connected with the execution ground that will people it with ghosts and make it enchanted ground to me He listens and looks at his watch, he tickles his ear with one finger claw, and says " Come and see the heap of skulls and bones, all the hair sticking to some of the skulls jet' After that answer further remarks w cream necessary It closed the matter I dropped sentimentalising, and told Ah Kim to walk on, asking by the way, what was the time it so pleased him to pull out that watch that I walked on to do it and forgot his pulse qum By constantly keeping him pulling out and pocketing the watch I kept him always now at my side In that glow of happiness he forgot his ankle, or rather what he said had called it He explained that he had been saving up for years to buy that watch and the pencilcase It was one of the strange instances in which the possession seemed to give the happiness that generally only attends the pursuit He worshipped his baubles more than his Buddha, for he told me that he never went to worship "Send my wife and the children instead, and give them the money ' After all lie perhaps at tended substantially to what the priests might have said was the principal part of the business We had by this time reached the execution ground, and to ' it was a potter s yard Space is too valuable to be wasted in Canton Busy artisans were here working at their wheels and moulding pitchers, jugs, and basins over the blood stained ground The skulls and bones of which An Kum had spoken were piled against the side wall The sight of the hair attachments was wanting The dogs and rats had no doubt accounted for that " You can take any of the BIVUIIB that you fancy," said Ah Kim, for which sarcasm I retorted by asking again how the time went I wanted to see the headsman block, but was told that the decapitation was done without it, one cut generally sufficing if the kneeling criminal held his neck steady " They always do that for their own Bake,' said Ah Kim "Have you seen executions here lately I asked "No, never come to them now There were 30 executed here a month ORO It seemed a great sacrifice until one looked at the superabundance of humanity that exists in crowded China, and thought of the millions that might be well parted with for the benefit of the others Looked at in the Frenchman's sort of light, this clearing away of the people in batches of 30 seemed almost one of the ways of providence As Chinamen and women advance in years they become shrivelled and hideous beyond other humanity Death must, I thought, be afraid to approach some of the ancient beings that I saw, who had for years been plainly flying the blue peter at the fore " We will go now to the dog and rat market, English people want to see that, said Mr Kum This Street at the select tastes of the "English was not bad, but could not be over looked What time will it take' I asked, forcing that watch to come out again All. Kum could not think of time, I knew with out consulting that oracle " Take a quarter of an hour , I show you some good things by the way The good things consisted of some ornaments made of blue leathers, or the down of some bird of blue plumage Some shirt studs, so covered, were neat curios, looking as if made of blue enamel It was of the delicate filagree work in which the Chinese excel, so also were the inlaying and tracery work on wood that I was next introduced to The plan is worked out by perforations on paper, which is then laid upon the wood, and the paper sprinkled with a white powder well shaken over it. On the removal of the paper the we hite outline of the design 13 seen, and the wood is then handed over to the work- man to be painted in thin but Strongly attacking varnish, over which powdered colours are shaken To decorate a tray in that style takes a workman days, and yet it sells for about a shilling, wholesale price Labour counts for nothing in China. The material seems to be that which is only counted in reckoning coat I resisted all Ah Kim 8 attempts to get me into shabby old buildings, that had been only tolerable at their best, where the grandees of the city lived The ice regal residence, or what was equivalent to it, looked a very few dry affair, not to say some what dirty Like to the Japanese, the Chinese do not excel 111 palaces or temples One must go to India to see what the Eastern world can do in that way A trouble had weighed upon Ali Khan's mind all day since the hour that he had seen me purchase some Chinese books It was the common leathern purse, of English make, out of which I took the necessary cash, that fixed my Chinaman's fancy The BOUR thirsted for that purse It would match the pencil case and the watch, and his happiness would be then trebled. He had a small, mean looking English one that he had thought something of before It had probably cost 6d where made, while mine might have caused four times that amount " I will change purses with you, Ah Kim" There his face lighted up-" if you will let me cut your nails down as short as mine are " Here it darkened "[ama gentleman," he said, " and must look like one " But you look like to a bird of prey, or a madman, with those finger nails They don't become a man who carries an English watch like to yours Besides, I want your nail tops to take away in a lozenge box as curios I could see the mental struggle that was going on until we reached the dog and rat market, but it finished in favour of the finger nails He looked at them several times, and decided to keep them " You can grow a new lot at any time," I suggested in Mephistophelian manner I have not out my finger nails for years They would take years to grow to this length again ' That was so self evident that I could not dispute it. There was no chance of doing so, as we were now with the skinned dogs, and the skinned and split rats Shakspeare's authority for calling rats and mice " quail deer and articles of food Here this miniature venison was in plenty Shops after shops showed they carcases hang- ing up for sale, looking scarcely as nice as chickens and orphans, out about the same size The dogs looked lean, but then all the dogs of the Last look in that way It is very short commons with them all their miserable life long An Eastern dog is so sharp set at all times that he will devour anything One of them left the mark of his teeth on my fingers in Shanghai in his eagerness to snap up a crust of bread The loss of life is but little loss to Buch, and they revenge it by the poor pick- ing that their bones must furnish to those that stand ed them thus in their lifetime The rats are plumber and are classed as burn or a vegetable fed rats, and drain or carrion fed do The latter have a game flavour, I was told, but the former fetch the higher price
