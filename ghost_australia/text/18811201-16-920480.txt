Lutheran Church. The foundation stone of a new Lutheran Church was laid yesterday afternoon by his lordship Bishop Hale. The church is being erected on Wickham terrace, nearly opposite All Saints' Church, and according to the design it will be a very neat and commodious place of worship for our German brethren, who will form the principal members of the congregation. The design of the church has been drawn by Mr. C. Waagepetersen, architect. It is in the early English style, and will be 4lft long by 26ft wide, and the chancel 20ft by 11ft. There is to be a neat vestry 10ft by 8ft, and a belfry over the front elevation facing Wickham terrace. The roof will be shingled, and the atono for tho font has boon presented by Mr Notrler The contractors aro-H V Smith, brick«« ork , D\ton, painting , J Míese, cai pentonng , R Robinson, plastonng, and C Koithnd, plumbing Tbo total cost of the church, without seats, ia to bo £710, and of this sum £430 is already sub- scribed, and an addition of £15 I fa waa placed on tho fouuditiou stone yesterday Thora «« ero a goodly number of spectators present at tho ceromonj, and amongst thom «vo noticed the Vou Aiclideacon Glennie, Reva C G Robinson, C W Houlbrook, and H Ouiuues«, the lion J C Housslor, Re\s E Guflith, O Maiet, J C Petersen, Lborhard, aud others Ths pastoi of tho church, tho Rev CFA T Schiruieistor, aftei a hymn had been sung in German, anl prajor had bcou oflored up by bim, requested ins lordship Bishop Hale to hj tho stone, and at the samo tuno pre- sented him «vith a \ery haudsomo sihei trowel, boanug a suitable inscription, and a miuiatuio niallot of polished tulip wood lu the ca\ity of tho fouuditiou stono thora «vero deposited copies of the local papéis, und also a document of wliieh tho folio«« mg is a copy - acini in Limn iiiv cnuRcn or :\oktii HR1SBVNB Tha found ilion «tono ot this C1 emull Liithornn Clttucli «.na 1ml by tho lll"ht Ilaioronl Sfathai« il ig lull lla'o 1) D , lim! op of Brisbane on tho ihirtioth ii ij of Voiom hoi in tho «cai of our Loi 1 0110 thousand olght billillie 1 nilli eighty 0110, btiuif, tho fort« fifth io ir of tho iclgn of her Most Gi letona "Wijcst« Q leon \ letona timing, thu lostnrnUiof tho Heul C 1 A 1 Sehiriuelater Tho Ural (lamían Lutheran Chitreh ni llilubnno n «looilen buillliij, M is openo 1 on tho tnont} llflh ii i> of December a ti 0110 thousanl uight linn liol mil ki\tj 0110 iluriui, ti a pi>U rata of Iho s uno nbneiiauiel pist ir Tho piitont liiitlecimo- llio H 1 1 U I \ 1 Sohn luoiRtoi Liti«nrl liigsUin Julius Caspui lim loiil 1 ml ««It, HiHliiiiiit uni Jncob Qittlieb Gross Cli m chu «1 lona Thoniiia i\n¿, 01 lloboit Ctipp, anti Philipp Ilol/loigoi Architeet Un ml ian A\ ung peterson Contrietors II0111« Smith bnoklnjor 'olui MI »0 enrpentor Hichniil liol meoii plistorer Clunie« Kurt limit, plumber Ubi \ton pniutoi God Si«/ Till.
