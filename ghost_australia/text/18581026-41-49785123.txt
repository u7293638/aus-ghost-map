Cave, J.P., on Satur- day, the 23rd instant, on the body of George Hoffmann, aged 61, a farmer residing in the neighbourhood. It appears that for some time past the deceased had been subject to religious melancholy, believing he had sinned against the Holy Ghost. On Friday morning he sent a letter to his son-in-law, the pastor at Blum- berg, asking questions touching his salvation, and in a postcript said—"You reed not look for me, for if you do you will not find me." This naturally caused the son-in-law to go to his house immediately. He had that morning taken cattle into the bush as usual to meet the children, who herded them, but had not returned when the pastor arrived. A search was set on foot, but no traces of him could be found that day. On the following morning, however, he was discovered with a rope round his neck and the other end attached to the branch of a tree. He must have been fully bent on self- destruction, as not only were his feet touching the ground, but the body was in a leaning or rather a sitting posture. The Jury returned a verdict that the deceased hanged him- self during a fit of temporary insanity. Fatal Accidext. — A correspondent writes: On Friday evening last, as the steamer Moolgewanke was proceeding down the Murray at the North-West Bend, it was discovered that a boy of the name of Frank Bolton, belonging to the vessel, was missing. As he had been seen about an hour previous. Capt. Webb gave orders for the steamer to be put about, and on going back to Levi's Station, it was found that the people belonging to the station had seen a boy in the river and were than dragging for him. but up to the time of the Moolgewanke's leaving; again they had been unsuc- cessful. SUPREME Court.— Monday being the first day of term, Sir Charles Cooper and Mr. Justice Boothby took their seats on the bench, but as there was no business brought before them the Court was ad- journed till the following morning, at 10 o'clock.
