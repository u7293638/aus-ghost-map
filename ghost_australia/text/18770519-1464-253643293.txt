A Pebble at Peebles. I went to a lecture, ('Twas purely conjecture Which led me to think I instructed should be!) Delivered by Peeble, A Yankee most feeble — Who, as to his subject, was quite "up a tree!" He talked about ghosts And the heavenly hosts, And told us most wonderful things — if but true; And said that the gutter Which flowed past Calcutta, The Ganges is called — which is certainly new! He shouted and ranted, He prayed and he canted; He told us of Bradlaugh — that direful cad; And why he left McElhone Out in the cold alone — Must have made Jackey feel terrible mad! He shewed us some pictures — (Most horrible mixtures!) But never a word did he say to explain. A hymn he read too, By a pious Hindoo; And showed us his portrait by help of a cane! He told us that he, When one time on the sea, Electro-biologized captain and mate — That he made them do aught, Speak his speech, think his thought, And a great many more things, too num'rous to state. He told us of spirits, Their faults and their merits; He told us of things he had seen, heard, and read, And ere he did leave us, Said wives ne'er deceive us! I shut my left eye and went straight home to bed!
