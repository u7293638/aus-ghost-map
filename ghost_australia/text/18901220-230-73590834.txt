An old-fashioned fishing schooner, manned by two men, a captain and a mate, was crawling along driven by a light breeze. The mate, who' was stationed on the bow of the vessel, suddenly espied a tide-rip ahead, and thinking it was evidence of a sunken reef, hastened towards the stern of the vessel. "Captain, there is a reef dead ahead," reported the mate. "Humph 7'" replied the captain, without changing the course of the vessel. The mate went forward, and watched the tide-rip uneasily for some time. Finally, he again went aft. "'Captain," said he, "we are getting dangerously close to that reef." "Mr. Mate," growled the captain, savagely, " you can take care of your end of the vessel and I will take care of mine." The mate said nothing now, but going forward he seized the anchor and threw it overboard. "Captain," said the mate, as he again went aft, "I have to report that my end of the vessel is at anchor." " I can plait my back hair with my big toes, and then go to sleep with my head on my heel," exclaimed a young lady whose ambition had been fired by the account which her sweetheart had given her of the evolutions of some indiarubber contortionists whom he had recently seen. Horror seized upon the young man when he thought of his future wife performing such antics, instead of cooking his chop or nursing the baby, but he repressed his feelings for a moment, and instantly betted her a dozen pairs of kids that she could do nothing of the kind. The wager: was accepted, and as, of course, modesty forbade that'the youth should person ally witness the attempt, two reliable feminines were called in to act as referees. The trio retired to an inner chamber, and the young man patiently awaited the report of the commis sioners. Screams of laughter proceeded from the sanctuary, and the fortunate witnesses of the genuflexions seemed to be enjoying themselves amazingly. Presently the door was hastily un locked and opened, while the referees came rushing forth, screaming, "Run for a doctor- er, let it be an old one I -run !" " What's the matter ?" cried the excited lover, and to his amaze ment he heard that his girl had won the bet, but that she could not untie herself again. The doctor came, and carefully unplaiting the fair limbs, restored the amateur contortionist to her original comeliness, She is now a wiser but a sadder woman, for her sweetheart then and there -broke off the engagement, declaring that the female who could thus tie herself in a knot was not the one with whom he wished to tie the knot inatrimonial. Jane (coming up the stairs) to missus-" I should feel extremely, ob liged, miirm[ if you wvould do nme a little favour." MIissus-" Well, Jane, what is it?" "I hardly know what to say, marm." "Well, of course, I can't comply until I know." "Well, marm, my young man is at the back door, and I thought, perhaps, you would be so very kind as to speak with him for a few minutes while I run upstairs and make myself presentable." A story is told of a shrewish Scotch woman who tried to wean her husband from the dram-shop by employing her brother to act the part of a ghost and frighten John on his way home. " Who are you ? " asked the farmer, as the apparition rose before him from behind a bush. "I am Auld Nick," was the reply. " Are ye really? " exclaimed the old reprobate, with much satisfaction instead of terror.

Girl-" I love little children." Housekeeper-" It will be necessary for you to bake bread, wash, annd gel the meals. I attend to the pastry and chamber work myself." Girl-"'I will also make the pastry and do the rest, if you will allow me." Housekeeper-" I cannot give you more than three afternoon's off." Girl-" Two will be sufficient, per haps more than I, will want, as my plan is 0to give strict attention to my house hold duties, and thus get the work done up -promptly every day, so as to have plenty of opportunities to rest between times." Housekeeper-" I am delighted--" \- Stranger (suddenly entering)-"Sorry to interrupt you, madam, but you are conversing with one of my patients, who has just :escaped from the Hopelessly Incurable Lunatic Asylum."

A museum keeper recently wanted a dwarf. He got one; that is, he get what he called a dwarf. As a matter of' fact the new freak was as big or nearly as big as an under sized man.

A man was brought before a Justice of the Peace charged with the offence of kissing a young lady " by force and violence and against her will." The young lady, who was very handsome,: gave her testimony in a modest and straightforward manner, after which his Honour gave the following decision : "'The Court, in this case, sympathises with the defendant, and will therefore discharge him without fine, imprison ment, or reprimand, because the Court, while this case has been in progress, has been obliged to hold on to both arms of his chair in order to keep from kissing the complainant himself." Mr. Justice Hawkins was once taken to be a member of the prize-ring.. He was waiting to take his ticket at a railway~ station in Paris, at which there' were a number, of English roughs re turning from the races, one of whom was very rude to him.
