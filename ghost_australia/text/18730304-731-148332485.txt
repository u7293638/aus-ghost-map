1 11 11 CALLED TO THE BAR. No. 10. ** THEY toiled pot, neither did they spin,' Barring the tpinning of some good old dia ' bolical Vandemonian yarns that would make ywar flesh creep and your hair stand upon end \- to listen to. It did not Want much capital to . sinter into the profession. Horse-flesh was to be tad for -the 11 lifting,' this with powder and Ind; and now and then a touch of the cold steel, formed their stock-in-trade. Their High Priest and Commander-in-Chief, was Melville, the redoubtable ' Captain' Melville. Some of yonr readers who knew Victoria at that day taay possibly remember that name. He was in eveiy' sense of the word, a remarkable man. A 8ootchman by birth, and by profession, a barrister, he ended his career in the Melbourne hulks. During '68 and part of '64 he' stuck up' , more travellers than any two men in Victoria. \- - His' name'sras a bugbear to the overlander and homeward bound gold-digger. There was uothing'irhatever of the ruffian in the cut of the outward man. He had rather a mild and, so to eptak, clerical appearance, lightly bnilt, but wiry' and deep chested, and as supple as a panther. 1 : The illnstrions novelist G. P. N. James Esq , is wrong in describing all his leading characters, brigands, moss troopers, and ' Men at Atms,' as 'stalwart' heroes. That isto say, heiswroogaccording to my experience. For tbe: greatest ecampe, dare devils, and cut threats) that I have ever met with— and I have teen a few — were, nineteen out of twenty, . ? wmtrU'tBeDi ' I -should like to communicate with Mr. Darwin on this singular fact, se that in the next edition of his last work, he might tfcfeorisejapcn it I have long believed that small wiry men are better calculated to 6tapd Jatigue and rough times than men of a heavier build, The great explorer, McDougall Stuart, ?.£ k«ew---|t» moth Australia, long before bis namebecame famous. Be v«ka a very small man ; to the best - of my belief he never weighed ten stone. He wasVot only very . . light, but frail in appearance, with a- sickly ?«estof countenance. And yefc Stnart as tonished the world by his fetes of endurance On his trip through' tbe continent to the Gulf «f Carpentaria, be was in the saddle for one hundred and four (104) hours without a drop ol 'Water. 'Where would one of G. P. Nc ?James* 'stalwart' heroes have been, were he placed in a similar position ? But to return to Melville, he was one of the most popular robbers that' ever lived.. Shep herds aod hntkeepers anda host of bushmen _ would have cheerfnlly given Melville their last bitof floor, and their lait blanket, and would nave gloried in-so doing.

This' good feeling towards great criminals, is a curious phase 6f the intellect. The heavier |he ctim^vtpvided there be no bodily violence oroutrageouscruelty, the more sympathy, not immixral^th j^miralionfor thc criminal. If a pobr devil robs a hen roost, or gives his aggravating vixen of a' wife a black eye, the World says 'give him beans,' and ' the Court 1 awardsit.' 1 : Pnt let a daring desperate rake hell rb&iUup; the Eecprt, rob the Bank, or bail up tb e Go vernor, and he is at once exalted into r . « henv.Mnd tis name becomes a household ^Wien tbe ** Wild :8cotchman' was' tried in .
