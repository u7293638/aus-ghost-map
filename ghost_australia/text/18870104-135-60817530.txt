A GHOST AT lOORWELL. .: \- An amusing little yarn has just reached us in connection with the editor of a paper published not a hini dred miles from .3orwell, wbich tends to shciv that that individual has "got 'em again." It'is said that during the festive days of the Christmas holidays our "inkslinger," like many another good man at that time, "went wrong," and under vinous and spirituous in fluence, became imbued with the idea that he had a family ghost that would not be laid, or in other words, that his house was. haunted-and his recital of the behaviour of the grim and ghastly visitant to his domicile, told in the graphic style characteristic of oneof his own leaders, filled his hearers with a horror so great that they naturally preferred to spend their evenings in Christmas jollities rather than venture within the boundaries . which were disturbed by " footfalls from another world." Then, though gloomy fore= bodings filled our hero's soul, he deter mined with the aid of his wife, and a few other articles of a fortifying na ture, to be brave and "dare to do all that may become a nmu." Armed therefore with a formidable gun, which served to remind those who saw it, of those terrible weapons which writers of Indian novels make responsible for the, death of many a redskin, he ought his haunted home once mores .Disrob ing, it is said, in momentary fear of the appearance of the ghost, which it is shrewdly suspected was one of the "blue devils" tribe, he sought his couch. But before lying down he placed his rifle be tween himself and the " partner of his joys," andl' swore by my something or other" that he would shoot any ghost which appeared. It is not known whether the gull exploded or whether tlhre was an cxptosion of another kind, or whether the ghost was scared by the preparations made to receive him, but the affair when it got noised abroad afforded material for a consider a'le amount of merriment.
