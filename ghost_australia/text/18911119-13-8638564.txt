THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1894. so The Assembly has now arrived at the clauses which contain the policy of the Railway Management Bill, and is debating them with a minimum of spirit The true policy, as we would maintain, has been laid down by Mr D VEry and by Mr WRIXON, and by no less an oracle than Mr JOHN WOODS, and though the 13 house may depart from it, that will be a matter of present regret and of future misfortune Policy, says Mr WRIXON, IS for the Pat Lament, speaking through Ministry. to dictate, the business management is for the commissioners to conduct either the present men 01 more competent officers That this is the correct view we have the experience of New South Wales to witness, the commissioners there having achieved a brilliant and recognised success, which could undoubtedly be repeated here The commissioners and thou various Ministers have worked in unison in New South Wales, and there is no reason why they should not here They appeal, indeed, to have done so up to a certain date, because it is not on record that the commissioners and the late Government over quart oiled The Railway Minister of the day and Mr SrEioHT appear to have been substantially of one mind, for Mr GILLIES once more assured the House yesterday that he took the responsibility of the commissioners' action, and, oddly enough, the chairman is blamed alike for not defying his first Minister, and for not taking orders as to details from his present political head Doubtless there has been an ambiguity in the position, which should now be cleared up Certain broad principles, as we would maintain, ought to be embodied in the act, and in particular the essential and swing principle that the com- missioners are expected to look to it as a matter of the last moment that the lines shall pay, and are required to state to Parliament all or any causes that operate against paying results being obtained, whether these causes are short hours, 01 extravagant wages, 01 political lines, 01 non commercial fi eights This principle asserted, it would be for the commissioners to do all in their power to give it intelligent effect, and we should imagine that any common sense commissioners would devote themselves not only With loyalty but with positive pleasure to the task once it were formally delegated to them If any of their number failed in enthusiasm or ability, the course would be clear He should be replaced The colony is not wedded to Mr SPI IGIIT nor to any particular man as commissioner, any more than it is to Mr SniErs or Mr LAURENS or Mr Tdtl-NWirn; as Minister, but it requires First an intelligent system, and most efficient administration The Opposition, through its leaders, offered Ministers then said yesterday in on dering it as clear as possible that in the future Ministers shall be entitled to state the policy to which the commissioner s are required to con Win, and they intimated their intention of opposing all efforts to to introduce Mimstotial management To this no solution we trust they will adhere, and with sufficient vigour as to justify the Legislative Council in remitting to the country, amongst other issues, this one as to whether the old scandals are or are not to be brought back to the tail ways In introducing the bill, Mr Sim IS made the remark that administration and not legislation is required, and how he MRS undoubtedly correct And Ma 12 at LU was well justified in pressing his point that Ministers have failed in the administration of the existing measure The hon member insists that it was and is well within the power of the Government to have formally and specifically to quired the commissioners to take all reasonable steps in their power to make the railways pay, and Mr HutriRndds that as the prior policy of Parliament had been to make the rapid opening up of the country the first consideration and receipts the second, the minute should have been as formal and as explicit as possible Mr Smnis promptly replied that such an order was given, and that the commissioners have refused to obey it Moreover, he says that this fact is in the correspond- once There seems to be some misunderstanding here The commissioners do not seem to consider that they e^erieeeivcd a formal and final man date They point out to Mr SKILLS that many of his suggestions are those of the amateur, and would defeat the Ministers own cmU,, but they add (29th April, 1891) - If it is necessary that sufficient profit must he obtained from the railways to meet accruing interest on the railways opened for traffic as well as those in course of construction the proposal should be submitted in distinct terms ' If in framing the estimates for next year the Government should desire that the fall I ways should be made to pay, we would be glad to consider in what way additional revenue could be realised at the least cost to the future prosperity of the railway property as a whole It does not appear from the correspondence that any order or suggestion "in distinct terms" was given after this date, although Ministers argue as if such an order was duly delivered Thus it is possible that the strained situation between Ministers and the commissioners is partly owing to a misunder standing Of one thing we are sure, name!., that if it can be shown that the change of Government policy has been explicitly communicated to the commissioners, and they have refused their co-operation not one member in either House will give them his aid and sympathy in such a situation, however, the proper course is not to bring back political management, but is to dismiss the disloyal commissioners and obtain more of a different stamp It needs to be pointed out that here once more the chairman of the commissioners and the Minister are in direct personal conflict The Minister says that the chairman has received orders to reverse the old policy and to make the first consideration the making of full profits out of the lines, and also he states that the commissioner refuses to obey But in his report to Parliament (made in September) the commissioner indicates that he has not been instructed as he asked on the 29th April, for in this communication he says - If greater revenue is required and it is laid down as a principle that the railways must pay it would be our duty on receipt of an intimation to that effect to consider how Una could be done having regard to the many and Mined interests in on ed The chairman reports that he is ready to obey orders if Ministers will assume the responsibility of distinctly instruct- ing him, and the Minister assure the House that the orders have been given, and that the commission is guilty of a gross act of disobedience in refusing to comply The discrepancy is greatly to be regretted For out part, considering the condition of the public treasury, we must insist that all other points pale in importance to that of making the railways permanently profitable It is the very corner stone of Victorian finance that the railways should be no drag upon the revenue If Ministerial control meant that the lines would bow 01 Iced on strict commercial principles, the case for a return to the politicians and their ways would be very strong, but to argue that political management and paying results are one and the same thing is to insult the corporate intelligence of the community At the von. first stress we should find the politicians yielding to demands to carry wheat and coal at a loss in order to develop the districts, and to raise wages and shorten hours in order to placate the Trades hall The old favouritism of individuals would return We should, as before, have drunkards among the employes ser comed because they are relatives of members, and salaries raised because of the intercession of political supporters and a few such acts serve to demoralise a service Mr Binns is above those things, but the successor of Mr SHIELS twice removed may be an unscrupulous partisan or a professional agitator, and such a man will create the true political system Water does not find the lowest level more surely than does political influence A careful examination of the work already accomplished by the British in Egypt and the work which still remains to be done will be forced upon the public shortly, now that the question of prolonging or terminating the occupation threatens to become a matter of party controversy We have now access to the full text of Mr G uraroN-'a recent speech at Newcastle, and whether or no he would be prepared to act upon his words, the latter, it must be confessed, wore plain enough I shall indeed " rejoice,' he said, " if before the day comes for the present Administration " to give up the ghost, it be possible " for Lord SALISBURY to make an effort " to relieve us from that burdensome " and embarrassing occupation of " Eye') which, rely upon it, must be a " cause of weakness and a source of " embarrassment, whichwoowo entirely " to engagements contracted by a " former Tory Government, and the " escape from which I greatly fear the " present Tory Government will hand " over to its successors to deal with" the jubilation caused in France by this utterance has been turned to spleen by the emphatic declaration of Lord SuisituiiY at the Guildhall last week, that England will not evacuate the country until it is able of itself to repress all disorder As Lord SALISBURY, however, will not always hold power, it becomes necessary to pay some heed to what, if words mean anything, must now be considered as the avowed policy of his political opponents The Liberal leaders contention, that the Egyptian occupation which he initiated was an inheritance from his predecessors, is an argument so palpably far fetched as to be reflective Our interests would have rendered it impossible for us to look idly on at anarchy in Egypt, it Lord Bl- \GONSMLID had never purchased a single Suez Canal shale But there is not the slightest necessity at this late date to split straws about such a question The main point is that after the suppression of the Arab rebellion, and the abolition of what was known as the dual control, the British occupation of the country, temporarily at least, became absolutely unavoidable The Conservatives recognised the property of Mr GLUDSIONES action in this respect, and continued the work begun, and before the question of evacuation is even discussed the good sense of the English people will demand that there shall be security for the results of the work already done and the sacrifices made What had to be accomplished - and it was a task of enormous magnitude was pithily expressed by Lord DUFFERIN in 1883 We had to effect a complete transformation in the material, moral, and political condition of the country, and out of the then existing chaos to " erect an Egypt " peaceful, prosperous, and contented, " able to pay its debts capable of main " taming order along the Canal, and " offering no excuse in the troubled " condition of its affairs for interference " from outside At that time the general situation of the country, independently of the appalling disorder of its finances, was almost as bad as it could be The fellaheen groaned under the debts which an numbered their lands and under the come, or system of forced labour upon public works; brigandage was rife throughout the country, the prisons at Cairo and Alexandria, as Mr CLIFFORD LLOYD found, were crowded with prisoners unconvicted and even untried the canal and irrigation system which Colonel SCOTt MONCRIEFF subsequently took in hand with admirable results was falling into utter uselessness and Sir BENSON MAXWELL, at the time of his appointment as Procureur general of the native tribunals had extraordinary revelations to make as to the administration of justice in the old fashioned Cadi courts in these, texts from the Koran were the chief legal authorities invoked, and the real inspiration of the tribunal was drawn from the money bags of one or both parties Besides the remedying of all these abuses, England set herself not only to immediately suppress the slave traffic, but to gradually bring about the abolition of domestic slavery, to raise an urban police force, and to organise an Egyptian army where none fit to be so called existed In every direction notable results have been accomplished, in many directions the British officials have been completely successful Difficult as the operation was the Egyptian Government has been taught to do without the substantial amount formerly raised by payments for exemption from the corpse, the state railways are working well under a mixed board consisting of one representative each appointed by England, France, and Egypt, the commission it was necessary to appoint to cope with brigandage has finished its work and ceased to exist, the number of slaves owned by private families has done eased until the system may almost be considered dead, harbour improvements have been carried out at Alexandria, tramways constructed at Cairo, and railways extended throughout the country, the finances have been so far restored that two years ago it could be asserted that the credit of Egypt, judging by the most recent operations, was better than that of Russia, Austria, or Italy In the administration of justice alone reforms have been slower, despite the organisation of some now and fairly competent tribunals The Egyptian Government has persisted in the per nicious practice of regarding judges as executive officers, and until quite recently the murders, the chief local authorities, resorted to torture as one of their most common methods of preparing cases for trial It has to be remembered that at every step in these reforms the English have been hampered, and their hands more or less tied by the jealousy and obstructiveness of the French The debt conversion scheme, which was elaborated at great pains, and the value of which was recognised by all the other great powers, was thwarted by France, and Great Britain consented to gratify the amount of care of that country by subsequently adopting an alternative scheme formulated by her. It was the pressure brought to bear upon the SULT AN by France and Russia combined which prevented him, after much vacillation, from ratifying the convention drawn up by Sir DRUMMOND WOLFF in 1887 Under this Egyptian territory would have been neutralised under the guarantee of the great powers, who would all have retained the right of transporting troops through the Canal England would havejDxor cised the right of appointing the majority of officers to the Egyptian army, and a date for evacuation might then have been fixed, subject to England s privilege of so occupying the country if necessity arose privilege our sacrifices had well earned By intriguing against those proposals Franco rejected terms which she has no fair justification for expecting will be again offered to her Every year it has become increasingly apparent that to abandon the work to which we have set our hands will probably result in the whole is seriously constructed edifice mumbling to pieces What the Eg. plan army is even when stiffened by the presence of British officers, bitter experience has taught us in the past, and the seemingly ineradicable feebleness of Egyptian officials renders the maintenance of the internal reforms by them unaided almost an impossibility It is at this moment that Mr GLVDSIOM, relying upon the popular ignorance of the Egyptian question, has chosen to make what is tantamount to a promise of withdrawal, and that Lord S VXISBURY has considered it his duty to reply with a forcible contradiction The issue, which is one of vital Tinpot tance, now lies with the British public Mr STUJCUTON IS entitled to public thanks for calling attention to a grave fault in connection with the compiling of the electoral rolls, and a fault which can happily be remedied without legislation This is the careless manner in which electors give their addresses All legis trains are not careless, but many are One registrar will evidently make an honest error t to induce the elector to give Huoli an address us a poHtnian could deliver a letter at, but others are more " liberal in their practice In one case scores of names are followed by an address of "Hoddle street and as Hoddle street is three miles in length, the seal oh for the individual is practically impossible No one can make so much as a guess as to whether John Jones, of Hoddle street, is an identity or a sham, 01 whether he is the Hinno John I ones who appeals in another district 01 not No one can hope even to forward him political literature which may affect the imagination 01 sway his reason, but he remains to the end a man of mystery with an electoral t light in his pocket It is in the power of every man to give an identifiable address, and the contention is that no time should be placed on the roll unless he so describes his place of residence that his tomatoes may be tested if occasion arises Each and every elector should in fact he a reality, and not a shadow in the Hospital elections a number of sub- seniors will be found with the one address, "care of Dr so and so, and the idea is at once suggested of dummy votes The present case is not quite so glaring, but nevertheless it is somewhat suspicious that on the eve of general election, which is to deal with exciting issues, there should be a rush of electors who for all the information that appears on the rolls may live in space Mr M'LEAN intimates that he disapproved of the laxity, and we shall hope that his orders to the " officers of his depart " ment to use a classic phrase ill so explicit, that the man who wishes to go upon the roll must not be allowed to hide his habitation When the Metropolitan Board of Works was asked on Tuesday to consult Mr MANBEROII as to the advisiiblonoüaof altering his plans for the sewerage of Melbourne, it was given an opportunity to do a business to act Unfortunately, however, its reputation did not warrant the belief that it would be eager to obtain credit for business capacity, and so it was not surprising that it refused to follow the course suggested Jh MutSFiiuii is not to be asked to offer an opinion on the proposal to have one sewage farm instead of two, and to have small sewers instead of large ones The board failed to see the importance of the question from the standpoint of public interest, but appeared to regard the issues a personal matter, as if Mr M IN SERIOUS standing as an engineer depended upon the breath of the Metropolitan Board of Works Mr MANSIon was placed in position of comp native nntnetmisni to Mr Invi virts engineer in chief of the board, who has altered his pi ins To refer to Mr MANSI-UMI would, it was said, show want of confidence in Mr Tuvv VITES, and so work is to be proceeded with on a " tinkered " scheme, with which Mr. MANSEROH'S name will be associated, but for which neither he nor Mr THWAITES will be roillyiesponsiblo Mr liiwArrFs will be the executive officer, it is true, but not being, the, author of the scheme how can he be held answerable in case of failure ? And what blame will rest upon Mr MANSon after his plans have been departed from? The ratepayers, of course, care little for one or the other is individuals vi h it does concern them, however, is that the drainage system should be a good one, and they have the right to demand that the board should take steps to ensure that the best possible scheme shall be adopted It does not follow that Mr MAisbLitan, if appealed to, would differ from Mr THaMES, but if he did he would give reasons upon which the board would be better able to decide bets on them than it can be with out further information in either event the board would be in a comp relatively strong position ; it would adopt a scheme which it had taken pains to see was reasonably calculated to meet all re (movements Having done so much it would have discharged its obliga- tions to the community But rather than show " want of confidence " in Mr in wALES, it profess to proceed in the dark _ The Legislative Council on meeting j ester eli. found itself again face to face with the One Man One Vote Bill, which was re- committed principally for the purpose of discussing an amendment by Mr Cuthbert, presiding, that the measure should not come into operation until June 1892 so as to let the new House be elected under the existing system Mr Service was willing to accept this proposal, but in several quarters for members considered it would be a dictation to the Lower House, an 1 limiting the actions) against him Mr Cuthbert, after a lengthy discussion obtained leave to withdraw his amendment Mr D Ham was successful in an attempt to extend the second vote to holders of miners rights and business licenses with an inchoate right to purchase and progress was soon afterwards reported The House then immediately plunged into a debate upon the quest tutu get on notice of by Mr Service respecting Lord Carrington H Bristol speech and this discussion was continued with the utmost animation until the adjournment the Council will meet again on Tuesday, and will be asked to sit on Thursday of next week in his remarks in the Legislative Council yesterday evening upon the telegraphic summary of Lord Carrington s recent speech Mr Service had obviously the sympathy of the great majority of members, and the determined hostility of Mr "cal only, the latter gentleman interjecting constantly remarks as to the unfairness of attacking an absent man and the unreliability of statements by cable lins opposition seemed to render Mr Services remarks as to the reflections cost upon the administration of Lord Knutsford all the warmer If, he said, the report were correct Lord Carrington a statements were erroneous and it would be dishonest unjust unworthy and mean of the representatives of the colony not to stand up and deny them there was every reason to believe the telegram was correct, and at any rate, we could not wait for con laudation by mail before giving a public denial He asl cd hon members to contrast the administration of Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford with that of Mr Gladstone, who was now being supported by Lord Carrington, and to whose interference we on ed the loss of the northern part of New Guinea and the adjacent islands After Mr Service s glowing defence of Lord Knutsford in the Legislative Council yesterday evening, Mr Cuthbert and Sir Frederick Sargood to whom be appealed, jointly followed man equally commendatory strain, euch hon. gentleman giving his individual experience of the pleasant relations main- tained with the present Secretary for the Colonies Sir 1 Frederick Sargood went further and contrasted their relations with those which existed during the regime of one of Lord Knutsford's predecessors Certain do so itches received at that time the Minister of Defence avowed that he absolutely dared not make public, on account of the indignation they would have excited and Mr Service echoed this statement with Hear, hear Then came the turn of Mr Zeal, who spoke with almost pas senate vehemence He condemned the action of Mr Service as a mere political party move, and again urged the unreliability of newspaper telegrams The Council ought he maintained, to take a neutral position If Lord Carrington had done wrong punishment would follow a right and proper way Mr Melville took sides with Mr Zeal, and had something to say upon the subject of coaches but the weight of opinion was the other was, and at halfpast 10 o'clock the discussion died a natural death Both aides in the Legislative Assembly are agreed on one point, and that is that the session should close before Christmas To that end the sessional orders were yesterday amended so as to provide that the House shoal Tait an hour and a half earlier on Mitineada}- and Thursdays, and to allow new business to be called on up to half-past 11 instead of half past 12 o'clock on Tues titles This arrangement was not come to however, without long discussion, and while Ministers were eager for business members irritated them by talkin. onUlna question Mr Deakin and Mr Zox and Pin oured to induce the 1 reader to name the bills to be proceeded with but Mr Munro would not at that time pronounce the doom of the innocents 1 medical business in then proceeded with and the Railway Management Hill was further considered in u must see private means ern business being, set aside for the evening, A long dies cuss m took place on clause 21 providing that in the event of difference of opinion between the chairman and the two other cctiimiasioners the Minister of Railways should decide between them Under the existing law the chairmans will is paramount when the commissioners disagree 1 mainly the clause was agreed to 1. 44 to 18 The next clause providing for the taking of minutes of the meetings of the commissioners was passed on the understanding that it should be amended Intel on so as to apply only to formal meetings The crux of the bill clause 21 discuss the new powers of the Minister was then considered and Mr Gillies was speak ing upon it when pro Press was reported at 11 o'clock The House then adjourned The debate in the legislative Assembly last Rev entry as to whether or not the Minister of Railways should determine on differences between the chairman and the other commissioners of Kaliwi, B revealed two things the first was that a comparatively small section of the House is prepared to discuss the clauses and the second that the Ministerial majority is always ready to vote as ordered without deferring to arguments. After the matter had been debated for some time members swarmed into the Chamber and voted as their leaders required-w look was for the dance Mr Deakin early in the debate took the ground that the clause would be a direct encouragement to the commissioners to differ and Mr Bent agreed with him later on the ex Premier defended the original provision making the chairman 8 view absolute in case of division of opinion and resisted DIP clause because it was calculated to give the Minister a voice in the management of the department which was never contemplated Sir Bryan 0 Bohlen and Mr M Lean on the other hand took the view that the provision would change the two junior commissioners from dummies into useful managers and said that the Minister would not decide without hearing both sides Other members of the Opposition fought persistently against the clause notably Mr Harper Mr Staughton Mr Madden and Air Fox but without avail the Government simply waited for the end and the clause was agreed to by 44 votes to 18 One point in the railway policy of the Cabinet as embodied in the bill before the Assembly last evening, was that an officer should attend all meetings of the Com missioners take notes of the discussion, and report to the Minister The clause had no sooner been read than Mr Wrixon and Mr îsinimo pointed out that the commis- aiontra as would at least be entrusted to report the inmates themselves and Mr Shiels quickly promised to make an amen heat in that direction at a later stage Other members spoke of the in dignity about to be cast upon the commissioners but it was left to Mr Gillies to smash the clause He pictured the commissioners have met private chat on a matter upon which action was contemplated I when lo I the door opens and in walks the secretary who remarks Gentlemen I am authorised by Iota to be present at all your meetings and I am about to take notes of what you say so as to report to the Minister Mr Shiela did not fight for the clause after that On the con- tract he declared that it had from the first been intended to apply only to formal meetings and it would be restricted to such meetings when the fit phraseology of an amendment was prepared Mr Gillies was s stilled His unfinished break on clause 24 showed him to be in good form, for he was alternate 1} jocular and grave in his criticism which entertained even Ministers Mr Shiels alone was uneasy especially when told that he had not tried to work amicably with the commissioners that he had conceived the bill in passion and that neither be nor any other Minister could expect to command such intimate knowledge of railway management as to be able to interfere with the commissioner to the advantage of the community. Mr Gillies is to resume his speech on the clause this afternoon. The references in the Legislative Assembly last evening to Lord Carrington a speech at Bristol were fuller than was originally intended Mr G D Carter while admitting that Lord Carrington was a true friend of the colonies asked the Premier and the ex- Premier if in their opinion Lord Knutsford a I administration of the Colonial Office had given rise to such sentiments as were said by Lord Carring, ton to exist in reference to that administration Mr Munro replied that he knew nothing to justify Lord Carrington B remarks In past times we had had cause of complaint against the Colonial Office but whether we were better or worse off under the 1 ones he was not in a position to judge. At any rate the colonies voluntarily under took to contribute towards the auxiliary squadron and therefore the remark by Lord Carrington as to there being taxation with out representative did not apply Mr Gillies speaking from longer experience referred to Lord Carrington a friendliness to the colonies and also to the circumstance that he was one of the most popular Governor of New South Wales No doubt he was speaking from a political standpoint at Bristol but while the colonies had nothing to do with his political opinions he (Mr Gillies) must say that the Imperial Government and Lord Knutsford especially had given no justifica- tion for any complaint whatever Every bill passed by the Victorian Legislature had been recommended to Her Majesty for assent including the notable Divorce Bill which was strongly oppose 1 by prominent men in England As to the aqua iron the Imperial Government had done more for the colonies than it contracted to do Sir Bryan O'Loghlen briefly asked the House to any pend judgment on Lord Carrington a speech until the full report was received 1 ele graphic Bummanea are invariably cure liable said the hon. gentleman though the opinions of Mr Munro fond Mr Gillies only were asked by Mr 6 0 Carter on Lord Carrington s utterances there was at reasons other member who had an opinion to offer Mr Munro and Mr Gillies are leaders and so is Mr Maloney He leads himself And being a leader he claimed the right to Buy something VII he could say however was that the Colonial Office is an incubus and ought to be wiped out A good many others think as I do Mr Zox broke in with the remark Yea they live in lunatic asylums and the House laughed so heartily that Mr Maloney could not proceed He was also stopped by Mr G D Carter reminding the Speaker that he had only asked the opinions of the Treasury and leader of the Opposition ' When I want the opinion of Mr Maloney I will ask for it said the member for Melbourne One other member came to grief on the question Mr WilliamS ventured to suggest that it was a Conservative Government in England which treated Queensland with conti met in regard to the annexation of New Guinea but was crushed with corrections from all sales all of which were to the effect that it was a Gladstone Government of which Lord Derby was Secretary of State for the Colonies the cabman is no longer a factor in politics In Assembly elections he was paramount for y ears and any notably voted against the candidate who employed him Now he can do nothing but vote When the electoral law affecting the Legislative Council was amended 1 some time ago the employment of cabs at elections was made clear and when the Chief Justice consolidate I the statues last year he inadvertently gave the provision apply to all 1 urliumintur} elections Both Houses agreed to the consolidation without reading and members of the Assembly have since discovered that they cannot hire cabs to put the matter beyond doubt Mr Shiels yesterday expounded the law" on the question and the only member who asked him to bring in a bill to reinstate the cabman was Mr Laurens 1 The absence of the name of Mr M'Culloch M L C from the division lists of the Legislative Council this week is accounted for by the fact that he is confined to his room at M oodlauds by an attack of influenza Mr Beaumont Fetherston and Lord Henry Thynne who have been guests at Government-house for some time hired ft-the former for Government house Adelaide whilst Lord Henry is visiting some stations in the licyhbourhoo 1 of Bull is to A conference was held lost cv snug between the Premier the Minister of Railways and several members of the Legislative Assembly with reference to clause 48 of the Railways Act Amendment Bill which is now under the consideration of the Assembly the cities mentioned 1 limits the rate of compensation or retinue, allowance which may be claimed by any railway employee to nine months salary out Mr F Smith has taken charge of an amendment which has emanated from railway. (,m_to;/es providing that there shall be no such limitation V.B a result of the conference the Premier intimated that he would strongly object to the amendment on the ground that it would I give an undue preference to railway employees compared with other members of the Public Service but he expressed his willingness to have clause 38 excluded from the bill A meeting of railway em louis will probably be held to day to consider the matter.
