V.li.C. AUTUMN MEETING. The Autumn Meeting of the V.R.C. termi< natea to-day. The Newmarket Handicap, which ia one of the principal races of the meeting, will ba run for, together with five other races, tha entire programme being especially attractive ia consequenco of the number of entriea for each event, and the reputation of the horses eugaged. The Newmarket Handicap has a largo number of competitors. 'Che tiual payments were made yesterday, 4-1 horaes being left in, the only oue» on which the necessary 15 sovereinga were not forthcoming being Quicksilver and Billingsgate. It is, however, thought that only 35 of the 44 will face the starter. This will be an exceedingly large field, the largest that h»3 ever started for this race. Notwithstanding the ex treme difficulty to pick a winner, where so many horses of nearly equal merits are engaged, tha public have selected about a dozen to support at various odds. The favorites are the Ghost, Hesperian and Lirpent, while Aureola, Sweet William, Tyropean, Surrey, are each supported at from 14 to 1Q to 1. The two first named were rather heavily backed yeaterday at 8 to 1, Tho other races on the programme are the Nursery Handicap, Town Plate, Steeplechas», All-aged Stakes, and Three and Four Year-Old Handicap. Our tipster "Novice" writes:—It is a very difficult matter to attempt to selest from Each a field of horsos as are likely to start for the Newmarket Handicap, three who are to fill tha three first positions. The difficulty is increased by the short distance, and the dependence which has to be placed on the start. However I must place them thus:—Surrey 1st, Lohengrin 2nd, The Ghoat 3rd, with Verdure, Weatbury and Gunild 33 emergencies.
