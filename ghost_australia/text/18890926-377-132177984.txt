MRS. BAEYERTZ' MISSION. The services in connection with the mission in this town oe,Mrs. Baeyertz, the converted Jewees, continpue to be well attended, and to excite a good dral of genuine interest. At the mid.day prayer-meeting, on T1seday,thers was again a large .nmber of persons present, the prooeedings being conducted in much the same way as on the previous day. The bar. monium accompaniments were kindly played by Miss H. Soott, and Mrs. Baeyerti delivered a short, etirring, and practical.addrsee upon incidents recorded in the Old Testament-to which, naturally enough, she has a great at tachment-her remarks being listened to with close attention. On Tuesday evening, the large bell of the School of Arts-platform included-was filled by an audience comprising members of every denomination in town, incliding even a small contingent of the much.neglected and too often despised aborigieals. Seated with Mre. Barey ertz were several of the local clergymen and many prominent citizens. After the singing of a hymn from snkey'es favomurite compilestioo, a most comprehensive and beautiful prayer by the Rev. J. Gardiner, and the reading of a portion of Scripture, a collectibn in aid of the missiones ponses was taken up, and further devotional exercises followed. Then Mrs. oaeseyrt com menoed her address, founding her remarks upon two inenldentereoorded in the Nsew Testament the yoong ralet who put to Jeens the all-im portant qiseetloon' " What moast I?do to inherit eternal life?" and the story of blind BEryimmaus,. the way.asid'e'tieggar, who besodghtthe'Son of David to give him the inestimable gift of sight. ter remarks rwer delivered wibth' a oeoy,' ease,? ?'and graces5 and withal with a 'whole. hearted earnestaes, that secured firr her the eloset attention of the large audience p~reset. Deferring to her conversion from Judaiem to Christianity, she said that there eanemn orisils in her lifle, s there would come;, 'at sometime: or other, in the lives of everyone present, if it had ubt already come. Her hubead, after Ewe years of married life, was taken from her very snddenly, by accident, and it was aeoene which took place when the dying man's soul was foet about to pass from time into eternity that con vined her of the reality of Chriitianty, and proved the turning.point in her eareer. She knelt down beside thebed of her dead husband, and took a solemn oath that ahe wosid never reust until she bad fonod Christ. 'Timeaspa~a on i she was till unsaved; theoutlooklbeoame gloomy; and.bhe felt that shaem?eld not foee the black and lonely fntre.. An invitation came, by letter, urging her to .retorn ?t her home, when she wonld be forgiven.for having resholnoed bur religion, money would be asttled pon her, honu 'osrould be' given her to live ia,.and everything possible would be done to make her happy. She was a?oatto reply in the affirmative; but her hand was stayed; she dropped thepsn; anddeterminedthat, whaterbr the oonsequencees might be,.ashe would not go baok, but would go on until she had found Christ. On day she was reading the story of the orocifzion, w.eo, suddenly,, the truthb.s flashed Into her soul, "H Be'i God E e is od; snd IHe died on the Greos.u She jumped up from the table, and wept for joy; she had at last become ecqgonited with theSar?viour.
