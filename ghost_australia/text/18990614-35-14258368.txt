MR. BARTON AT WAVERLEY. AN INTERJECTOR REMOVED. THE BILL ADOPTED. Mr Edmund Barton, M L A, delivered an address on federation at the hall of the Grand Hotel, Waverley last evening. There was a large attendance, and the chair it is occupied by Dr Mathieson The members of the audience had, with one exception, assembled for the purpose of listening to an ex- position of the Commonwealth Bill by Mr Barton The man who had not come with that object, prov- ing troubles are by nature frequent interjections, was twice removed from the building Mr BARTON, who was received with applause, paid that the attendance that night can quite sufficient to pi give that there was a large proportion of the residents of that district anxious to hear a fur exposition of the bill Now, he was confident that is w South Wales next Tuesday would carry the bill and he was certain that Queensland would come into the federal ion (Applause) From the reception he and Mr Deakin got in Queensland he was certain that the cause of federation in that colony was not in such a condition as to cause any alarm to its friends He never saw before so profound an rout IIB mia produced in Queensland by a speech delivered by Mr Deakin The inclusion of Queensland in the federation would be a great access of strength to the Common- wealth, and would tend to the prosperity of Queensland They had not only the Premier and the Colonial area Birrer of Queensland in favour of federation, but they also find the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the labour party equally favourable to federation Fourteen out of twenty one members of the labour party, of Queensland d were in favour of the hill so that he was quite justified in telling the people of New South Wales that if they adopted the hill on Tuesday next so would Queensland come in in due time (Ap[ 1 line ) Opponents had, when they thought there was some doubt as to whether Queensland would come in, endeavoured to make the inclusion of Queensland a condition of the establishment of federation , but now that they saw that Queensland was coming in they abandoned that position and said that the people of this coldly must not accept such a federation if Queensland came in, because it would mean great expense (Anpl fuse ) In a constitution they had merely a machine for self-government That was the keynote of the bill. The object of a federal constitution was to place an instrument in the halls of the people by which they might make their own laws As to the country that had been made relative to the ' saving of expense, it did not seem to shake people who talked that way that a federal constitution was only a piece of machinery for the purpose of enabling the federal government to be carried out The coast but on placed in their hands the means by which they might run to their laws for the Commonwealth but the people were left free to carry out the government of their states in their own way It might hon proper thing that every colony should retrench It might be a proper thing for this colony to be content with 60 or SO members of its Assembly instead of 12) Supposing that was so it was never the brief news of the federation to decide about the internal affairs if any colony (Hear, hear.) It was the business of the Commons' 11th to decide upon federal machinery As to the rest, for the colonies decide for themselves to what extent they would retrench In a federation there must be intercolonial freetrade and a uniform tariff Isow, be did not admit that the cost of federation would be 22, Oil per head He did not think that the people of this colony were ROiug to believe any more in ghost stones (A voice " How much will federation cost ? ') w ell he would tell that gentleman now at the he ginning that neither he nor himself (Mr Dirt) could tell how much it would 1 cost If the restitution provided for government by the people then it rested with the people themselves to determine how much it would cost ( Appin use ) inequalities must exist at the beginning, but they must diminish every year on account of the uniform tariff Why should the people follow the beacons of the ne wreckers who wished 1 them to reject union and to maintain those disislTous tailless (Applause) Opponents of the bill were not sincere in saying that Um question of the tariff was an objection to the bill, because it must be an objection to any Australian union, even if either of the proposals opponents of the bill had advocated was adopted Union itself must begin with inequality, because the death of inequality was a slow process It would not be possible to forecast the results of the tariff They must have sufficient faith in the sanity and reasonableness of the people who were about to enter into the federation and their ability for self-government, and 'he must koo v that those people would make year title of financial nb Btiulcj because they knew that the material advan tugs were nllO"Â»elhor beyond any charge that might possibly full upon them There would be no 22s 6d They need not trouble their heads about that (A voice WhaT I Well, if that gentleman wanted the reason he could have it It was because the people of Australia were not going to become insane liumeili-ilelj they federated (Applau e ) The man must be a fool who thought that the people would recommend directly they got federation He could say this There is no necessity under this bill for any crushing load of taxation A voice How do you know ' Mr Barton I know it because I understand the hill, and you do not (Applause) I they could not have to uniform tariff without having in existence those inequalities which were the results of disunion, and which would continue until the uniform tariff gradually 1 died them that was the only thing to kill them, because no Act of Parliament would ever do at the levee of the Commonwealth might be raised entirely by customs and excise, or there could be a revenue caused partly by that process and partly by direct taxation. The tariff, or the policy of taxation, would be just what the people made it It was an audacious misrepresentation to say that the hill required any huge lanIT, because high tariff or low lands would he simply in the direction of the people themselves (Applause ) No policy could be forced on by the Senate, because the prevailing party would be the prevalent party throughout Australia The strength if the constitution lay in party government, and he hoped that they would not surrender that strength for some German or Swiss muslin return (Applause ). The Senate could not originate a taxation hill, so it could not force the taxation of Australia. The Braddon blot could not be accounted for as needs bunting an extremely Ililli tnnfT, because that would be a matter for the people themselves to decide Ihn Braddon clause was an excrescence, but he did not think that they ought to inject the union of Australia because of that excrescence (Applause) the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth had to be paid back to the States month by month 1 but got rid of the misrepresentation concerning a " scrambling for the surplus " Now they could not have any tariff which would hear equally upon every member of the community The proportion of the tar lil a man would pay would depend upon what he ate and drank and smoked, and w that he consumed of datable article? It was absolutely impossible to say that men would not play through (the customs in accordance with what they consumed Srino men would have to pay 4s a year, wl the others would only have to pay )? And that was the reason why men who would have to pay 40s were trying to get in opposition to the bill the votes of the men who would have to pay only us it was not true that the bill provided Hut the needs of necessitous States should be provided for by the Coinuionwe 11th The question after all WURM whether any reasonable cost they cool I foresee was not altogether outweighed by the advantages of federation (Applause ) The approach the quantity under fe less tion must redound more to the advantage of New South Wales than to that of any other colony (Loud and cause ) A show of hands was taken and was found to be almost unanimously infavour of the bill, there being only five dissentients A vote of thanks was accorded to Mr Barton for his address a
