THE QUICKEST WAY HOME. (BY THE EXPATRIATED T'OTBEBSIDEBB.) Written for the Sunday Times. CORNSTALK (Norseman) sings : " Lend me a moke with a tenderieh month, Give me fine weather, bnt no torrid drouth, Show me the back track that leads to New South And m sight Sydney Heads in the morninV GUMSUCKER (bicyclist) sings : " Wheel me an eagle with circular wings. ni flit through the scrub where the lonely wire sings, Indian Ocean at dawn, at noon Alice Springs And Melbourne's paved streets era the morniu'." BAKANA BOT (pedestrian) sings : Olympia's my laurel ! Peel, rub me and start, I'll smoke you a bee-line to break your stout heart. O'er plains, rivers, hills, till the day dawn clouds part And Moreton Bay gleams in the mornin'. TOGETHER : Ler her go! The day is here-the horizon's expanding Pass the bullet on the wing-leave the lightning standing! Shove her through the spinifex, dodge the willy-willy ; Snatch the mirage as yez scoot and plant it in your billy ! Shake her up! Its nip and tuck where the gold lies spoilin' ; Splash and dip and out again where the erik's a-boilin'. Faster shroagh the timber land Ghost, the earth's a-quiver ! Lift her up the bloomin' rise and dive across the river. Hell ! The meteor's beaten off ! By the Holy Token Here's the flamin' city lights ere the dawn has broken !
