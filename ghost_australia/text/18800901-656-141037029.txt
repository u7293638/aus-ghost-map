HEART'S-EASE. Theri if a lower I sought for years, H-.art's-eaae and rest from care, For :wj heart was crushed by pain and tears, JLv- '.lie world was lone and bare. Far j, i the madding erowd I went, 1 f -'i;ht the flower alone, - Be : my heart with woe was bent, Arid ?till njv soul made moan. I t the fight, I longed todii, I ? -Red mid shot and shell, U . . kt* a whitp BMiEt passed me by, ? ; others dj««g fall. i[)i«t! the lonely sea, upon a toreign shore, M . 'i ghost ot sorrow followed me . F.-r oyer, ever more. One day I met a little child, Sweet as a bud of May, She bore a reath of flowerets'wild, I followed in her way. She came onto a dim green place, Knelt by a grate in prayer, . Tli'ea passed, with tears upon her face, And left the flowerets there. 0, not in rain ! 0, not in rain ! My quest by sea and shore. Rest, rest, theu troubled ghost of pain, V ex thou my soul no more ! I knelt upon the blessed sod, I wept an earnest prayer, I found the flower, the peaee of God, Hea-t'a-eaee and rest from care.
