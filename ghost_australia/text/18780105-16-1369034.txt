Notes from Wide Bay. [from our own correspondent December 26. The pipes for conveying the water from Tinana into Maryborough have been landed from the ship Sarah, which arrived in Wide Bay lost Saturday, with a batch of immigrants. The ship, drawing only fifteen feet of water on an even keel, was towed up to the wharf in town, where she now lies. The immigrants were readily absorbed domestic servants (females) at from 10s. to 12s. a week. Mr. Travis, an old resident of Maryborough, now doing the grand tour of Europe, has made arrangements with M'Ilwraith's new line of vessels to bring out regular consignments' direct to Maryborough. A new. era dawning for us ? Gympie races came off on Boxing Day and the day after. The Handicaps secured a goodly number of nominations, ten and nine respectively ; but the handicapping was a botch, and much of the interest in the racing was destroyed. Your Gympie correspondent will, however, furnish you with further particulars as to acceptances and result in due course. The Maryborough Handicaps have also filled well.

Cattle are no longer dying, but they still stalk like ghosts of their former selves about their camps, and the young stock, the calves of the Benson the few that survive have suffered irrecoverably,-I.fear. a.-, Sheep in small flocks,: on the selections, have done well without exception, and this should turn the attention of selectors to the raising of this kind of stock, which pays well. They can be kept without shepherding nearly the whole year, trained to feed themselves, and to come home every evening. as regularly as sunset. Of course during the lambing season they want watching, for they are apt to lose or, desert their lambs; otherwise they cost nothing; their wool brings in a yearly income small perhaps, if the flock be small, but all, or nearly all profit; while they also keep down the butcher's bill? no slight consideration with meat at 30s. to 33s. a hundred People, in Sydney or Melbourne, where a bullock costs very nearly twice as much as our local butchers have to pay for a beast (at their own doors, too, so to speak) and where meat is not much more than half the price it is in Wide Bay, will wonder at our equanimity, which amounts to pusillanimity, under the greedy despotism of bur butchers, who if they cannot be classed amongst the legally fraudulent, fairly come under the head of extortioners!

The sugar season is over at a number of the mills, " Men may come and men may go," but Yengarie goes on for ever as a matter of course, and a few of the plantations where a vacuum pan is used will crush on to the end of January and into February, or until autumnal or late summer rains set in. The weather continues favorable to the planter who has cane yet to be crushed, but the farmer and the grazier could do with more rain.
