,HAMlPTOB1 COURT GHOSTS. BETWEEN 9 and 10 o'clock buo night recently two frail. figures in w-ite raiment suddoenly Ippenrd in tho public highway, opposite the principal entrance gates loading to Hampton Court Palace, and darted off at almost lightning speed along theo road in the direction of Hnmpton Greeon. They were observed by a couple of Todding ton dealers, driving in tho same direction, and so positive were they that the figurea had dropped from the walls surrounding the palace, and wero in some way connected with the family of ghosts now inhabiting the Court, that they immediatoely gave chase, shouting loudly for help as they drove furiously after the fugitive spectres. Their cries induced others to join in the hunt,: and wild shouts of 'The; ghosts ! tho ghosts !' rang out in tho clear night air as the pack, some driv ing and some on foot, took up the run ning. Upon this occasion the ' ghosts' did not escape into thiu air, as is their wont, but allowed their pursuers, who wore aided by the light of the mooni, to catch sight of them from time to time as they proceeded at racing speed along the highway through the vil geo fHampton, and thence towards Fiuwell railway station, whero they suddenly stoppod dead and. turned upon the excited and breponloss crowd now at their heels, tmen it was dis covered for t ...l.'t time that the two myste j-- n gures in scant white rai ero but a couple of innocent ..hs connected with a local pnnck of rnbtweeto e out for an ovening's u tIslorth.
