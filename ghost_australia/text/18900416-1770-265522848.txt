in Ocean Tragedy. By W. CLAUK-RUSSELL. Chapter xvm: IS SHE THE "SEAIK!" IT was not to prove a gale, though it would have been hard to guess What lay behind that dirty jumble of white and livid terraces which hud been stealthily crefyiiig nil the timmincT zenith wards. The dmiili scattered to tiie rush of the tiiid, tile Eun with a brightened disk leapt froin one flying vaporous edge to tnodier, dazzling out the snows of the dissolving seas till the eye reeled from the glare of the brilliant foam and the sharp and lovely sparkle of the pure dark blue between. Indeed, before long the wind steadied down into a noble Bailing breeze with a piebald sky of warm and cheerful iveatlier steadily swinging into the southeast, as though the whole heaven revolved from one quarter to another like a panorama on a cylinder. Wilfrid looked his wishes, but said nothing. He hung apart in a fasliioii that was ihe same as telling me to keep ofij nor had he anything to say to Miss Jennings. Finn easily interpreting his master's face, piled cloths on the yacht till it seemed as though another nig would blow the whole lofty white fabric of canvas, tapering spar, and rigging clean over the bows. We fled along in thunder, and to every curtsy of the vessel's head the water recoiled in a roar of spume as far as the jibboom end, to speed aft as fast, you would have thought, as the eye could follow it, the swell washing to the counter as if to help her. *\Yc held on in this way for some time, when suddenly Wilfrid, who had come to a Eland at the weather rail and was looking ahead, bawled with the note of a shriek in iiis \oicc, " Look 1" and out sprang his lung arm pointing directly on a line with our bowsprit. " Ay, there she is, sure enough!" cried I. as I caught sight, to a floating lift of the deck at that moment, of the pearlish gleam of canvas of a milky brilliance slanting past the soft whiteness of a head of sea against the marble look of the sky there, where the sun-touched clouds were going down to the ocean edge in a crowd with a vein of violet here and there amongst them. I glanced at Wilfrid, not knowing what sort of mood this first glimpse of the yacht would put into him, but there was no alteration of face. His countenance had set into an iron hard expression ; methought resolution could never show more grimly stubborn. Miss Jennings came to the side to look. " There is little to be seen as yet," said I to licr, "but wc shall be heaving her hull up vciy soon. She is taking it quietly." Finn stood near; I took his glass from him and levelled it. " Why, 'tis merely ambling with her, captain," said I; "gaff topsails down and no hint of squaresail that I can make out. The cloud we are making astern should puzzle her. D'ye think Captain Fidler will recognise this vesEel? " " Why, yes, sir; bound to it," he answered ; "we aren't like the Shark, you know ; our figure-head alone is as good as naming us. Then our sheer of tow 'ud tarve like a sign-post to Fidler. Back this by our square rig and he'd have to ha' fallen dark to mistake," meaning by dark, blind. "Is the Shark to be as easily recognised !" asked Miss Jennings, who stood close by me, occasionally laying her hand ujmn my arm to steady herself and putting the other to her lips to speak, for the breeze rang with a scream in it at times over the rail in a manner to sweep the wonls out of her mouth as though her Syllables were the smoke of a cigarette, rinn shook his long head ' ^y me close aboard, miss," said he, • and IH tell you the Shark from another «™t; hut there's nothen distinct about her as there is with us. She's black without gilt lite a great many others, of a slaving pattern, long, low, without spring loir-ids or aft, with apple sides like others But," said he after a pause, during *hicU he had taken a look through his telescope at the glistening fragment hovering like a butterfly over the bow, "though l don t want to say too much, sir, I'd be fUhjg to lay down a good bit of money «n the chance of yonder chap proving the Mark. Time, place, all sarcumstances point her out." ''True," said I; "but there are many ^moonej-s afloat" Ay, sir; but such a coincidence as - " .> r ou r honour," said he pointing, Bits to far on the verge of what's likely "t it to sarve as part of a man's reckonings." "I agree with Captain Finn," said Miss ^ura ; "besides, 1 feel here that it is the vessel we are pursuing." She laid her upon her bosom and turned to cross deck where her chair was. J fisted her to her seat with a peep Comer of but .1 m y eye" afc Wilfrid, i. mere was no encouragement In his ; so, posting myself forward of the «mpaii,uii for the shelter of it, I lighted * ™ d Puffed away in silence tifi the tS° n Wafr ^ »•«• i <* did not come • I returned on deck after uogering nearly an hour below, partly t ® - Wlsh P«t some hearTinto "JEBJennings, who was pitifully dejected a ll '"' 0 ,?'- *** because I ^[spellin the open air and guessed ^t for some time yet there would be ^woHp? ? f a e Sooner showing io ? ,UBin * »a irith aariTfi tari*^ clasped on his breast S S ^ withaiace «rim, ™ e «»wling conization of edketedin the deter- ,n ^thTs&t; £ 5 C!U \ be imagined. of the schooner xhead / had gathered all his faculties and wandering fancies and imaginations into a bunch, so to speak, and his mind as you saw it in his eyes, in the set of his lips, in the resolved and contained posture of his body, was as steady as that of the sanest man aboard us. It was without wonder, however, that I perceived we had risen the yacht to the line of her rail, wheal noticed that she still kept under short canvas whilst the Bride was bursting through the surges to the impulse now even of the lower studdingsaiL 1 took Finn's glass .from him and made out a very handsome schooner, loftily sparred with an immense head to her irtainmnl^ the boom of which hung far. over her quarter, whilst die swang in gracefnl floating leapings from hollow to ridge with the round of her stern lifting black and flashing off each melting brow that tinderran her. Wc had, indeed, come up with her hand over hand, but then it would be almost the worst point of Failing for a fore-and-aft vessel, whilst wc were carrying in our square rig alone pretty nearly the same surface of canvas that she had abroad. She was too far off as yet, even with the aid of the glass, to distinguish her people. "What do you think, Finn, note?" said I, turning to him. He stood close beside me with his long face working with anxiety, and straining his sight till I thought he would shoot his eyes out of their sockets. "If she ain't the Shark," said he, "she's the Flying Dutchman. I had but one doubt. Yonder craft's boats are white, and my notion, but X couldn't swear to him, was that the Shark's "boata were blue. I've been forrards amongst the men, a few of whom are acquainted with Lord Winterton's yacht, and one of 'em says her boats was blue, whilst th'others are willing to bet their lives that they are white." * . Hut thocut <}f }>er as^lie bIiowb yonder proves her the Shark, you think ? " " I do, sir," he answered emphatically. " Well," said I, fetching a deep breath, " after this hang me if I don't bum my book and agree with your mate, old Jacob Crimp, to believe in ghosts." I levelled the glass again and uttered an exclamation as I got the lenses to bear upon her. "By thunder, Finn! yes, they look to have the scent of us now. See! there goes her gaff topsail 1" Wilfrid caught my words. '' What are they doing ?" he roared, bursting out in a mad way from his rapt iron-like silence, "making sail, d'ye say?" and he came running up to iis with an odd thrusting forward of his head as though straining to determine what was scarce more than a blur to his short sight. He snatched the glass from my hand. " Yes," he shouted, "and there goes her squaresail. By every saint, Finn, there's an end of my doubts," and he closed the glass with a ringing of the tubes as he telescoped them that would have made you think the thing was in pieces in his hands.- " Shall I signal her to heave to, your honour ? " exclaimed Finn, speaking with a doubtful eye as if measuring the distance. "Ay, at once," cried Wilfrid, "but"— he cast a look at the gaff end—" shell not see your colours there," pointing vehemently. " I'll run 'em up at the fore. Sir Wilfrid ; they'll blow out plain there with the t'gallant halliards let go." " Do as you will, only you must make her know my meaning," cried my cousin, and he went with an impetuous stride right aft and resumed his former sentinel posture. Miss Jennings came timidly up to me. " She is the Shark, then ? " she said in a low voice. "All who know her are agreed, Finn says, saving here and there a doubt about the colour of her boats," 1 answered. She had a sailor's eye for sea effects, and instantly noticed that the schooner ahead had broadened her show of canvas. " Do they suspect who we are ?" she exclaimed, talking as though she were musing. " No doubt the Bride is recognised, and they will run away if they can. She. looked at Wilfrid. " I do not like to speak to him," she exclaimed. 'He's killing Hope-Kennedy over and over again," said I; "his wife is before him, too, and he is haranguing her. Bless us, what a wonderful tiling human imagination is 1" Dp went the signal flags forward in a string of balls, a man tugged, the bunting broke and streamed out in its variety of lustrous colours, every flag stiff as a sheet of horn handpainted, with the light of the sky past it showing through. I caught myself breathing short and hard whilst waiting for what was to follow this summons to the running craft. We bad been crushing through it after her with the speed of a steamer, and, supposing her indeed to be the Shark, had literally verified Wilfrid's boast that the Bride could sail two feet to her one. But now that she had broadened her wings thfere was a threat of considerable tediousness in the chase. 'Bo you suppose they have made out what yacht we are? " I askedFinn. "Likely as not, sir. I shall thinkso for sartin if they don't shorten sail on reading that bunting up there. Antranger 'ud - be drilling enough to speak jis. Why not! 15b understandable that Fidler ftmiiM have kept his rags Email in the, faco of the muck that was crawling in flu nor'rad this morning.

He put the- glass to his eye as he spoke. "Billot" he exclaimed in an instant, "they're hoisting a colour. There it goes—there it blows. Oh my precious eyes! . What is it? what is it?" he rumbled, talking to himpolf and working into the glass as: though he would drive an eye clean through it. "Why, Mr. Monson," he bawled, " I'm Field Marshal the Duke o' Wellington, sir, if she han't hoisted Dutch colours." I snatched the glass from his hand, and Bure enough made out the Batavian horizontal tri-colour streaming from the peaksignal halliards like a fragment of rainbow against the lustrous curve of the mainsail. " Wilfrid," I shouted, addressing him as he .stood right aft, Miss Laura and I and the dapper being grouped a little forward of the main rigging,' * they've hoisted Dutch • colours. She's a Hollander, not the Shark! " and I fetched something like a breath of relief, for it was a condition of suspense that you wanted to see and end to one fashion or another as quickly as possible. He approached us slowly, took the glass from my hand in silence and after a steady inspection turned to Finn. "She's the Shark," he stud, with a fierce snap in his manner that- was like letting fly a pistol at the skipper. " Your honour tliinlm so ? " •'Don't you?" "Them Dutch colours, Sir Wilfrid " " A device, a trick! What could confirm one's suspicion more than yonder display of a foreign ensign? She's the Shark, I tell you, and that colour's a stratagem. What do you say, Charles?" " I'm blest if I know what to think," said L "If she's the Shark, why has she taken it so leisurely, only just now setting her squaresail and gaff topsail though we have been in sight for a long time, crowding down upon her under a press that should awhile since have excited their sus- picions? No need for them to hoist Dutch colours. If Fidler thinks he is chased, why don't he haul his wind instead dead before it, as if he didn't know on which side to carry his main boom 1" "She's tie Shark!" thundered Wilfrid, " the flag she is flying is a lie. Finn," he cried in a voice so savagely imperious, so confoundedly menacing, that I saw Miss Laura shrink, whilst the -poor skipper gave a hop as though he had touched something red- hot;." are we overhauling that vessel!" "Yes, Sir Wilfrid." "How-long will it take us to come within gunshot of her ? " Finn scratched the back of his head. " Mr. Monson, sir," said he, addressing me, " that gun ''nil throw about threequartera of nmile, I allow." " Call it a mile," said I. My cousin, with his nostrils distended to the widest, his respiration hysteric, his whole body on the move, and with that raised look in his face I have formerly described, stared at Finn as though he would slay him with - Vis gazel The skipper scratched the back of his head again. \- Wdl,'^ybur-'honour, "if yon schooner holds as she is and this here breeze don't take ofii we ought to be within gunshot," here he produced a silver watch of the size and shape of an apple, "in three hours 1 time, mnlring it about half-past five." " How Ear is she distant now ? " " Betwixt three and four mile, Sir Wilfrid." "Get your gun ready." .. "A blank shot, your honour I" " A blank devil and be damned to yon. Load with ball. Who's your gunner ?" "We shall have to manage amongst us, Sir Wilfrid," turning a face of alarm upon me. I was about to remonstrate, but there was an expression in the eye that my cousin. bent on me at that instant that caused me to take Miss Jennings' hand as an invitation to her to cross the deck and walk. "Charles," said he, "you told me that you knew something about gunnery. Will you handle that weapon yonder forme?" "Wilf, it is madness," said L What! plump a shot into a craft that may not be the vessel you want! or, which in my opinion is just as bad, fire at with a chance of sinking a yacht with a lady aboard— that lady your wife—the woman whom you have embarked on this extraordinary adventure to rescue?" My blood rose with my words. I dared not trust myself to reason with him, crossed the deck with Miss Laura, and when we faced round I spied Wilfrid marching forwards with Finn, and presently he was by the side of the gun gesticulating vehemently to a body of seamen who had collected round the piece. Our signals were kept flying at the fore, whilst with the naked eye one could behold the minute spot of colour steadfast at the schooner's peak. Onwards she held her course, swarming steadily forward in long gliding curtsyings over each frothing surge that chased her, a most shapely and beautiful figure with a long flash of her low blade wet side coming off the line of foam like a lift of dull sunshine, whilst on high soared the stretches of her sails with something of the airiness of a dragon-fly's wing in the milk-white softness of their spaces against the cloudy distance beyond. The time passed, Wilfrid remained forward. He stood upon one of the anchors swaying with folded arms to the movement of the yacht, stiff as a handspike, his face fixedly directed at the schooner ahead. The sailors hung about, chewing hard, spitting much, saying things to one another past the haiiy backs of their hands ; here and there a whiskered face looking stupid with a sort of dull wonder that was like an inane smile; but the - fact is, from CutbQl down to the youngest hand all the seamen were puzzled, excited and uneasy. The state of my cousin's mind showed plainly to the least penetrating of those nautical «yes.'.-"Bo man amongst them could imagine' what wild .directions would be delivered, and though I made, no doubt the gun would be let fly when the order to fire was given, X was pretty sure that should It come to a command to board the schooner by. force themen would decline. SometimesFinn was forward, fluttering near Wilfrid, • sometimes aft, restlessly inspecting the compass or going feverishly to the «3e and looking over, when again and again I would hear him say in a voice as harsh as the 'sound of a carpenter's Jane: "Gloiy, gloijr! blow^ my sweet JM> I' mmifAsflv. nnnnnapiniw blow 1" manifestly unconscious that lie spoke aloud, but evidently obtaining some case of mind from the ejaculation- \- • •>• - The son wait floating down westwards, the breeze shifteda pointer two towards him and then slackened, though it continued -to How » ine sailing wmdirith a r^rular sea thatjhad long before lost the \- * " iiBh$in3 worrying liml put into. _ iBt rf:ti^,daiJiWi.;njBlowJy 'wiriaA SbeenJgaimhgT^^nSt&SdjaEo; minute after jminute I liad "been eipectiiig to see her putber: helm down, flatten "her sheets, and . go -staggering away into the reddening waters weltering and washing to the sky under the descending sub, on what she might know to be some best point of sailing. She kept her squaresail spread and the Dutch flag hoisted, and swung stubbornly ahead of us, making nothing of our signals, which still continued to. fly. Through Finn's glass I could'distinguish the figures of a few seamen 1 forward and a couple of, men pacing the weather-side of the quarterdeck. Now and again a head would show at the xafl as though watching us, but the suggestion I seemed to find in the' general posture and air aboard the vessel was that of in? difference, as though, in facb, we had long ago exhausted curiosity,. and had been quitted as a spectacle for inboard jobs and the routine of such life was led there. Is she the Shark!" I said to Finn. "If she isn't," said he, "my eyes ain't mates, sir. It is but a question of the colour of the quarter-boats." "I see no name on the counter." . "No, sir, the Sliarkhas no name painted on her." "She's steered bya wheel," said 3. "So is the Shark, sir." "What do the men forward who know the Shark think now?" I asked. "Two of 'em say that it ain't her; the rest that it is. But ne'er a man aboard has that knowledge t>f her that 'ud give him conscience enough to take an oath upon it. Glory, glory, there she walks! By the piper that played afore Moses in the woods, your honour, 'twill be the fairest sunrise that ever I see that lights up the end of this dammed mess, begging your pardon, Mr. Monson, and yours, miss, I'm sure. Fact is, I feel all of a work inside me, like a brig's boom in a calm." "I am unable to hold the glass steady," said Miss Laura. "Mr. Monson, I see no signs of a lady on board. Do you, Captain Finn?" "Not so much as the twinkle of a hinch of petticoat, miss; but if her ladyship's there, of course she'd keep below." " You know Captain Fidler," said I. " Very well, sir." "There are two figures walking that quarter-deck. Is one of them he ? " " It's too fur off, sir. I've been looking and looking, but it's too fur off, I say, sir. Mind!" he suddenly roared, "they're a-going to fire," and he rolled hurriedly forwards. A moment or two after, crash ! went the gun. The blast broke in a dead shock upon the ear, and the smoke blew away over the lee-bow as red with the tincturing of the sun as a veil of vapour at the edge of the crimson moon. Miss Jennings shrieked. A long yearning gush of sea catching the Bride fair on the quarter swung her for a breath or two so as to hide the schooner, then to her next yaw with Wilfrid still on the anchor bending forward in impetuous headlong pose and two or three sailors handling the gun and a crowd of men in the head staring their hardest, the chase swept into view afresh. . "Ha!" I shouted, " she's heaving to." " Oh, Mr.,'Mphson! " cried ifiss Jennings, clasping lifer hands. Instantly Finn fell to • thundering, out orders. " In stun'sails ! clew up the t'ganisail I down squaresl ; down gaff topsl !" Twenty such directions volleyed from him; m a trice the decks of the Bride were as busy as an anthill; canvas rattled like musketry as it was hauled down; the strains of Cutbill's whistle shrilled high above the voices of the men, and a true ocean meaning came rolling into the commotion and clamour bom the yeasty seething over the side, the singing of the wind past the ear, and the frisky motions of the yacht as she brought tiie sea on her bow healing, to Finns yell to the man at the helm, to range to windward of the schooner that was now fast coming round with her squaresail descending, her main tack hoisting and her topsail withering with her head to the west. Distance is mightily deceptive at sea: How far off the schooner was when they let drive at her from our forecastle I could not say. She was probably out of range; at all events, she showed no damage as she came rounding to, away down upon the throbbing blue which had softened much within the hour, with a bronze gleaiu of sheathing, as she heeled over ere her canvas broke Bhivering in the eye of the wind, that wonderfully heightened the beauty of the long, low, black, most shapely hull, and the bland and elegant fabric of bright spar and radiant cloths shining white yet through the faint claret tinge in the atmosphere. Wilfrid came slowly aft, constantly looking at her as he walked. Under reduced canvas we swept down leisurely, sliding lightly upon the run of the surge that was now on the beam. I examined her carefully through the glass whilst Miss Laura stood by my side asking questions. " Is she the Shark!" " She may be. But such of her crew as I make out don't look to me to. be Can you distinguish any women on board?" ' " Nothing approaching a woman. They mean to board us. They have a fine boat of a whaling pattern hanging to leeward, and there are sailors preparing to lower her. They are not Englishmen, I swear. I see a large fat man delivering orders apparently with sluggish gesticulations, which strike me as distinctly Dutch. How about her figure-head?" 1 continued, and I brought the glass to bear on the bows of the schooner. " Ha!" I cried, and looked round. _ Wilfrid was watching the schooner right aft, where he had stood during the.greater part of the chase, his arms folded as before, the same iron-hard expression on his countenance. I called to him. "What is the. figure-head of the Shark!" He started, and answered, "I don't know. Ask Finn," and so saying walked towards us. The skipper was giving some instructions to Crimp on the other side of the deck. " Captain Finn," I called, "Sir." " What's the Shark's figure-head? " "A gold ball in a cup shaped like a lily, your honour." "Then, WHfrid," I cried, shoving the glass into Ids hands, "your pursuit imist cany you further afield yet, for that craft's figure-head is s white effigy, apparently a woman's head." His manner to the sudden, desperate singing of the disappointment in hnn fell in a breath into the old form of the craziness of Ilia moodB of excitement. He looked through the glass, and then roared out— ««Finn." The skipper came bundling over to lis. *< ^Qiat vessel is not the iSnarft." -"I've been afeared not, sir, I've been afearednot/' said Finn.. "lake as.two; gs end.on; but now sbeVdrawedout •fcam't only the Sgnre^iead.^ She han't j Wilfrid dadied the telescope down on to thedeck. " A fool's -chase 1" he exclaimed, scarcely intelligible for the way he spoke with his teeth set.: " Heavenly God, what a disappointment t But it should have been Monday, it should have been Monday," and his gaze went into a scowling, wandering way from us to the schooner. ' "I suppose you know," said I to Finn, " that they're standing by to lower a boat when we shall have come to a stand ? " . " Ay, sir, I know it," exclaimed'Finn, who had .picked up his telescope and was feeling over it in a nervous, broken-down -manner as though he feared it was injured, but durst-not look to make sore while i Wilfrid stood nigh. "I shall heave to.to looard for their convenience," and with that he walked aft to the wheeL Wilfrid looked crushed with^m^hing absolutely lifeless in the dull leaden blank of his eyes. It was perhaps fortunate for us, if not for him, that this sudden prodigious blow of disappointment should have completed the sense of physical and mental exhaustion which inevitably attended the war of emotions that had been going on all day in his weak mind, otherwise heaven alone knows what miserable and painful display might have followed this failure of his expectations. I was much affected by his manner, and endeavoured to console him, but he motioned me to silence with a gesture of the hand, and seated himself on the skylight, where he remained with his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the deck, apparently lieedim; nothing that passed around him. "Hell rally after a little," said I to Miss Laura, who furtively watched him Kith eyes sad with the shadow of tears. " It ought to have been the Shark, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed in a low voice. "My cowardly heart all day has been praying otherwise ; and now I would give ten years of my life feat my sister were there—for his sake, for mine, and for yours too, that this wretched voyage of expectation and mistakesand supeistitions —oh, and I do not knov what else," she added with a little toss oi her arms like a wringing of her hands, " might come to an end." The sailors forward were eyeing the vessel steadily as we approached her. By this time all hands were aware of the blunder that had been made, and one seemed to see a kind of suspense in the posture of the fellows, with a half grin in it, too, as though 'twas an.incident to be as much laughed at as wondered at. The breeze continued to slacken, the seas were momentarily losing weight as they rolled, the gushing of the western crimson floated in the air like a delicate red smoke, with a heap of flame-coloured clouds resting broodingly upon the southern confines and the new moon over the sun, a wonder for the bright sharpness of its curve in such a hectic as she stood in. We ran down, and hove to within easy hailing distance to leeward of the schooner, but it was plain that Mynheer had no notion of •alVing to us from over his rail. Hiw fine large boat hung manned at the davits as we rounded to, with a gang of fellows at either Jail, and no ..sooner, was our' way arrested than down slowly nnlt the sixoared fabric. The oars sparkled in the red light-, mid away she came for us. " Charles," called my cousin from the skylight. I went to him. "I'm too ill to be worried," said he ; " represent me, dear boy, will you ? Get us out of this mess as best you can, and as quickly." He spoke faintly, and slightly staggered after he had risen. Miss Jennings, seeing this, took his arm, and together they went below. I stood at the gangway along with friend Finn. Twas a ludicrous position to be in, and what excuses to make I knew not, unless it was to come to my explaining the full motive and meaning of our expedition—a sort of candour I did not like the idea of. In the stem-sheets of the approaching boat was the large fat man lhad previously taken notice of in the schooner s quarter-deck. His face was as round as the moon, with a smudge of bristly yellow moustache under a bottleshaped nose ; his person was the completed pudding of a figure that can be imagined, as though, forsooth, a huge suit of clothes had been filled out with suet. He wore a blue cap with a shovel-shaped peak, and a piece of gold lace on it going from one brass button to the other. " That's not Fidler," said I to Finn. " Fidler 1" he ejaculated, staring with all his might at the boat, " there's twenty Fidlers in that man, your honour. Why, Fidler's a mere rib, lean enough to shelter friirmglf under the lee of a ropey am." The boat came fizzing alongside handsomely, and the fat man, watching his opportunity, planted himself upon the steps and rose like a wliale to our deck, upon which he stepped. In a very phlegmatic, leisurely way he stood staring around him for a little out of a pair of small, greenish, expressionless eyes, and with -a countenance that discovered no signs of any sort of emotion; then in the deepest voice I ever heard in a man, a tone that literally vibrated upon the ear like the low note of a church organ, he said in Dutch, "Who speaks my language ? " ' I knew a few sentences in German, enough, to enable me to understand his question, but by no means enough to converse with, even if the man spoke that tongue, so I said bluntly in English, "No one, sir." He wheezed a bit, looking stolidly at me, and exclaimed, "You are Caption ? " I motioned to Finn. " Yy you vire ot me ? " he demanded, turning his fat, emotionless face upon the skipper. Finn touched.his cap. " Heartilysony, sir : 'twas all a blunder happening throu^r our mistaking you for another craft. 11 very willing to 'pologise and do whatever's right." The Dutchman listened apathetically, then Blowly bringing his fist of the shape, if not the hue, of a leg of beef to his 'rast spread of breast, he exclaimed in a voice even deeper than his former utterance, " Vot I ask is, vy you vire ot me ? " Finn substantially repeated his former apology. The Dutchman gazed at him dully, with an expression of glassiness coming into his eyes. " "Vot schip dis ? " Finn answered with alacrity, " The schooner-yacht, Bride, sir." "Zhevihgt vorrherr nation ? " sending a lethaigic glance at our masthead as if in search of a pennant. "No, sir," cried Finn, "we're " Deris no var,".exclaimed the Dutchman, nhalring his head, " between mine coundry and yours." . " Ho no, sir," exclaimed Finn. " Den I ask," said the Dutchman in a voice like a trombone, " vy you vire ot me?" This promised no end. A hastily whispered to Finn, "Leave him-to me. Turn to quietly .and trim sail and get way upon the vesseL Hell take »o. other ..hint,' 1 fear.'"' Finnsneaked offi. * "Eardonme, Eir," Said I, "youll have heard from the captain that our firing at you was a .blunder into which we were led by mistaking your ship. We'desire to tender you our -humble apology, which I trust you will see your way to accept without delay as we are very desirous of proceeding on our voyage." He looked at me with a motionless head and a face as vacant of human intelligence as a cloud, with its fat, its paleness, its Alp upon v Alp of chin, then ponderously ana slowly putting his hand into hiB breast bepulled out agreat pocket-book and said, "ivbt dis sdiips name ? " "The Bridesmaid," said I. He wrote down the word, wheezing laboriously. " Your-captain name ? " "Fidler," I answered. Tijis he entered. . NfcMrt? " Colonel Hope-Kennedy." " Ow you shpell ? " I dictated, and he put down the letters as I delivered them. "Vhcro you vrom ? " Limerick," I answered. Ow you sphell'" He got the word, and tiien said, " Yere you boun' ?" "To the Solomon Group," I answered. This I had to spell for him too. He wrote with such imperturbability, with such a ponderosity of phlegmatic manner in his posture, with such whale-like asthmatic wheezings broken only by the trembling notes of his deep, deep voice, that again and again I was nearly exploding with laughter, and indeed, had I caught anybody's eye but his I must certainly have whipped out with the merriment that was almost suffocating me. He slowly returned the note-book to his pocket and exclaimed "Goot. You hoar more of dis," and with that walked to the gangway. "Pray forgive .me," said I, following him and speaking very courteously, "will you kindly tell me the name of your ship?" He regarded me with a land of scowl as he hung an instant in the gangway—the only expression approaching intelligence that entered liis face, and said, " Malvina." "And pray where areyou bound to, sir?" " Curacoa." " Are you the owner, sir ?" "Captain," he responded with an emphatic nod, and so saying he put his foot on the ladder and entered his boat. Five minutes later wo were breaking the seas afresh, making a more southerly course than was needful by two points, that we might give as wide a berth as soon as possible to the Dutch schooner, that, at the time I went below to the summons of the dinner-bell, was sliding away westsouth-west a league distant under every cloth that she had to hoist. CHAPTER XIX. A MYSTERIOUS VOICE. THIS was an incident to give one a deal to think and taJb about. Certainly little imaginable coi'^o be stranger than that we,. being in T&ase; of a fore-and-aft schooner, yacht, should fall in with a vessel so resembling the object of our pursuit as to deceive the sight of men who professed to know the Shark welL I should have been glad to ask the Dutchman about his craft, yet it was a matter of no moment whatever. The tiling had happened, it was passing strange, and there was an end. Likely enough she was an English vessel purchased for some opulent trader in the is aud of Curacoa, and on her way to that possession in charge of the porpoise who had honoured us with a visit. The incident signified only as a disappointment. All dinner time I had been fretting over it, for since sunrise I had been tliinHng of the vessel ahead as the Shark ; counted, in a sort of unreasoning, mechanical, silent way, upon capturing Lady Monson out of her, which, of course, would mean a shift of helm for us and home again. Wilfrid bore the blow better than I had dared to expect. He made a good dinner, for which ne had the excuse of having fasted since breakfast, and broke into a noisy roar of laughter out of the air of gloomy resentment with which he had arrived from his cabin on my describing tlie Dutchman, and repeating liis questions and my answers. In short, his weak mind came to It is' rescue. ' With the schooner had vanished an inspiration of thought that had served his intellect as an anchor to ride by. His imagination was now fluent again, loose, draining here and there like water on the decks of a rolling ship ; and though he spoke with vehement bitterness of his disappointment, and with indignation and rage even of Finn's ignorance in pursuing a stranger throughout the day, he dwelt very briefly at a time on the subject. Indeed, his talk was just an aimless stridefrom one thingtoanother. If he recurred to the Dutch schooner, it was as if by mere chance; and, though the subject would blacken bis mood, in a very short while he had passed on to other matters with a cleared face. Miss Laura afterwards said to me that the strain of the day had been too great for him, and that when the tension was relaxed the strings of the instrument of his mind dropped into slack fibres, out of which his reason could fiddle but very little music. Well, I could have wished it thus for everybody's sake. Better as it was than that he should have shrunk away scowling and hugging a dark mantle of madness to him, and exaggerated the abominably uncomfortable behaviour I had witnessed in him all day. He arrived on deck after dinner to smoke a cigar, and whilst I sat with Miss Jennings—for it was a quiet night after the stormy blowing of the day, with tropic tenderness of temperature in the sweet gushing of the soutiierly wind, the curl of moon gone, and the large stars trembling through the film of their own radiance like dewdrops in gossamer—I could hear my cousin chatting briskly near the wheel with Finn with intonations of voice that curiously proclaimed the variableness of his moods to the ear, sometimes speaking with heat, sometimes in a note of sullen expostulation, sometimes surprising the attention with a loud ha, ha! that came floating back again to the deck hi echoes out of the silent canvas, whilst Finn's deep sea-note rumbled a runningcommentary as the baronet talked. "What do you think of this.chase now ? " said I to Miss Laura. " I wish it were over," she answered. "I want to see my sister rescued from the wretch she has run away with, Mr. Monson, but this sort of approaching her recovery "is dreadful." " It is worse than dreadful," said I; "it is tedious with the threat of a neat little tragical complication by-and-bye—any day. indeed—if Wilfrid doesn't stow that« in his hold :or. heave it overboard, i Dutchman might very well have answered our shot had he mounted a piece or two or driven alongside and plied Us, as they used to say, -with small arms. Now one isn't here for that sort of thing,. Miss Jennings." - "No- Is there np way oi losing the cannon?" I laughed. " If Wilfrid will reserve his fire until lie is sure of the Shark instead of blazing away at the first craft that resembles Iit tie weapon' might - yet prove 7 TSSS^* something to usefully serve his turn ; for I doubt if anything will hinder the Colonel from cracking on when he catches sight of us, short of iron messages from the forecast! e there. But we shall not meet with I the Shark this side the Cape, if there." " I fear it will prove a long voyage," said she, with the sparkle of the starlight in her eyes. " You will be glad to return ? " " Not without my sister." "But shall you be willing, Miss Jennings, supposingustoarriveat Cape Town without falling in with the Shark, to persevere in this very singular and unpromising sea quest ?" ' "I' will remain with Wilfrid certainly," she answered quietly. "My duty is to help-him in this search, and where he goes I shall go." " But he will be acting cruelly to carry you on from the Cape unless able to certainly tell where to find the fugitives, fixing the date too for that matter." "I see you will leave us at the Cape, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed with an accent that could only come from the movement of the lips in a smile. " Not unless I prevail upon you to accompany me home," said I. She shook her head lightly, but made no answer. Perhaps it was her silence that rendered me sensible of the unpremeditated significance of my speech. "Well," said I lighting a second cigar, " whilst you feel it your duty to stick to my cousin I shall feel it mine to stick to you. Not likely I should leave you alone with him. No." At that instant the harsh, surly voice of old Jacob Crimp hailed the skipper, who still stood aft talking with Wilfrid. All was in darkness forward; it was hard upon two bells ; the canvas rose as elusive to the eye in its wanness as a dim light in windy gloom far out to sea, and the shadow of it plunged a dye as opaque as blindness into the obscurity from the mainmast to the forecastle rail, where the stars were sliding up and down like a dance of fire-flies to the quiet lift and fall of the close-hauled yacht upon the invisible folds brimming to her port bow. ' Capt'n," sung out Crimp's melodious voice—plaintive as the notes of a knife upon a revolving grindstone—from the heart of the murkiness somewhere near the galley. " Hallo !" answered Finn. " Can I speak a word with ye ? " "Who is it wants me ? " "The mate." " Tell him to come aft," Wilfrid bawled out* " If there's anything wrong I must know it. Step aft, Crimp, step aft, d'ye hear ?" he cried. Old Jacob's stunted figure came out of the darkness and walked along to where Finn stood. " What is the matter, I wonder ? " said Miss Laura. I cocked my ear, for there is something in a hail of this sort atsea ona dark night to put an alertness into one's instincts and nerves. Besides, there was no sounder snorcr on board than old Jacob, and his merely coming up on deck during his watch below, though he should have stood mute as a ghost, was something to raise a little uneasy sense of expectation. His voice rumbled, but I could not hear what he said. Wilfrid shouted " What d'ye say ?" with an expression of astonishment and incredulity. Finn laughed in a sneering way, whilst old Jacob again rumbled out with some sentence. Then my cousin bawled out " Charles, Charles, come here will you?" " What the deuce is the matter now ! " said I, and Miss Laura followed me as I went over to the group. " Here's a nice pickle we're in, Charles," cried Wilfrid. " What think you ? Crimp swears the yacht's haunted." " So she be," said Crimp. " Pity your mother didn't sell vinegar, Jacob, that you might have stayed at home to bottle it off," exclaimed Finn. " Haunted That may do for the marines, but you won't get the sailors to believe it." "That's just what they do then," remarked Crimp. " All tie. watch below have heard it and can't sleep in consequence." " Heard what ? " I asked. " Tlie woice," answered Jacob, " the same as you and me heard 'totlier night." "Have you heard a voice, Charles?" exclaimed Wilfrid, suddenly fetching a deep breath. " A mere fancy," said I. " Ye didn't like it anyhow," said Crimp gruffly as though speaking aside. "For God's sake tell me about this voice, Charles," cried Wilfrid, agitated all on a sudden and restless as a dog-vane, with the twitching of his figure and the shifting of Ins weight from one leg to another. I related the incident, making light of it, and tried to persuade him that the mere circumstance of my having said nothing about it proved that I regarded it as a deceit of the hearing. " Did you know of this, Laura ? " said Wilfrid. " As a joke only," she answered. "A joke," cried ho, breathing deep again. " The voice sounded off the sea, hey? and two of you heard it ? What did it say ? " and I could sec him by the starlight looking towards the starboard quarter in the direction whence the syllables had floated to us. "What did it say ?" he repeated. " Why, that this here yachtwas cussed," rattled out Jacob defiantly, " and dum me if I don't think she be now that the bloom' ing corpse belonging to the wreck is a- jawing aud .i-threatening of all hauds down in the forepeak." " What is this man talking about ? " I exclaimed, believing that he must either be drunk or cracked. " He's come aft to tell us, Mr. Monson," answered Finn, " that he and others of the watch below have been disturbed by a woice in the hold saying that there's a ghost aboard, and that the only way to get rid of him is to sail straight away home and end this woyage which, saving the lady's presence, it calls biarsted nonsense." I observed old Jacob's head vigorously nodding. " You're heard the voice too, Charles?" said Wilfrid, flitting -in short, agitated strides to and fro beside us. " Mr. Monson heard it twice," growled Jacob, " off the wreck as well as off the quarter." " Speak when you're spoken to," cried Finn. " Why, spit me, Mr. Monson, if it ain't old Jacob's grandmother as has signed on instead of Crimp himself." "Look here," said Cnmp, "let them what disbelieves step forrards and listen themselves." " Charles, inquire into this matter with Finn, -will you ?" exclaimed Wilfrid. "I—I—" he stopped and passed his hand through Mian Jennings' arm, immediately afterwards saying with a short, nervous laugh, " die sound of a supernatural, woul d cost me a ni^it's iwit^'i „ = »<TnmB.«lonir.l^n,*!WX Come along.JFm n » Coma Blong,<toup- ! jighost,os our VY TOD VIBE OT MB?" friend here says, he must promptly be laid by the heels and despatched to the Red Sea." " What did'ee nut to go and tell Sir Wilfrid about chat iroice yon aqd Jtfr. Monsom heard 'tother night ? " grtup&cd; Finn, as ire moved forwards into the darkncss towards the forehatch. "Cause it£ true," answered Crimp in his sullenest manner. " 'Sides it's time to end this here gallivanting ramble, seems to me, if we're going to be talked to and cursed by sperrits." Finn made no answer. We arrived at the forehatch and descended. The Bride's forecastle was a large one for a vessel of her size. On either hand abaft was a small cabin partially bulkheaded off from -the sailors' deeping-room, respectively occupied by Jacob Crimp and Cntbill. Whether die mate ate with the captain, whose berth was just forward of the one that had been occupied by Muffin, with access by means of a sliding door to a _ small living room through which he could pass into the forecastle, I cannot say. It was a rough scene to light upon after the elegance, glitter, and richdyes of the fittings of our Quarters aft, but the more picturesque for that quality as I found it now, atleast on fiewirigthe homely and coarse interior by the fight of a email oil lamp of the shape of a block-tin coffee-pot with a greasy fort of flame coming oat of the spout, and fcumingdaddy into a corkscrew of smoke that wound hot and illflavoured to the upper deck. There were bunks for the seamen and two or three hammocks dung right forward ; suits of oilskins hung by nails against the stannous, and swnng to the motion of the vessel like the bodies of suicides swayed by the wind. Die deck was encumbered by sea-chests cleated or otherwise secured. Here and there glimmering through the twilight in a bunk I took notice of a little framed picture, a pipe' rack, with other odds and ends, trifling home memorials, and the artless conveniences with which poor Jack equips himself. There were seamen lying in their beds, a vision of leathery noses forking up out of a hedge of whisker, with bright wide-awake eyes that made one think of glow-worms in a bird's nest ; other equally hairy-faced figures in drawers and with naked feet, huge bare aims dark with moss and prickings in ink, sat with their legs over the edge of their bunks. It was with difficulty that I controlled my gravity when on casting a hurried glance round the forecastle on entering it my gaze lighted on the visage of Muffin, whose yellowness in the dull lamplight showed with the spectral hue of ashes. His bunk was well forward ; his bare legs hung from the edge like a couple of broomsticks ; his hands were clasped ; his head slightly on one side; his posture one of alarm, amid which, however, there still lurked a native quality of valet-like sleekness wito a suggestion of a respectful apology for feeling nervous. Sweet as the Bride was, no doubt, as a pleasure vessel compared with other craft of those times, the odour of *liis interior, improved as it was by the flaring snuff of the lamp, not to mention a decidedly warm night, was by no means of the most delicious. Added to this was the 'ift and fall of the yacht'B bows which one felt here so strongly, that, coming fresh from the tender hearings of the afterdeck, you would have imagined a lively head sea had sprung up on a sudden. That Muffin should have stood it astonished me. Sleeping as he did, right in the " eyes," he .got the very full of the motion. Besides, such an atmosphere as this must needs prove the severer as a hardship after the luminous and flower-sweetened^air of the cabin. Finn took a leisurely survey of the occupants of the bunks. "Well, lads!" said he, "what's the meaning of this here talk about a woice I Mr. Crimp's just come aft to tell me there's somewhat a-speaking under foot here." " That's right, sir," remarked Cntbill, who stood bolt upright like a sentry in the entrance to his Utile berth. " I beg your lon, Mr. tMonson, sir, but it's nigh Cd the same sort o' speech as us from the wreck." "'Tis the same!" said a deep voice from one of the bunks. "Bats !" quoth Finn, contemptuously. " If ever yet met with the rat as could damn a man's eyes in English," grunted Crimp. " Nor in any other lingo, Mr. Crimp, said a singular looking seaman, whose face I had before taken notice of as resembling the skin of an over-ripe lemon. He lay on the small of liis back blinking at us, and his countenance in that light, that was rendered confusing by the sliding of shadows to the swing of the yacht, made one think of a melon half buried in & blanket. "Well, but see here, my lads," exclaimed Finn, in a voice of expostulation, " what did this hero woice say f That's what I want to know. What did it say, men?" " I told 'ee," growled Crimp. But old Jacob's interpretation did not tally with that of the others. The sailors were generally agreed that the voice had exclaimed in effect that the yacht was cursed, and that their business was to make haste and sail her home ; but some had apparently heard more than others, •whilst a few again manifestly embellished, •with a notion, perhaps, of making the most of it; but there could be no question whatever that human syllables^ very plainly articulated, had sounded from out of43lB3iold ; all hands were agreed as to that, and proof conclusive as to the sincerity of the men might have been found in the looks of them, one and all. "Silence, now!" cried Finn, "let's listen." Wo all strained our ears. Nothing broke the silence but the sulky wash of the sea outside, seething dully, the halfstifled respirations of the sailors, who found it difficult to control their hurricane lungs, and the familiar creaking noises breaking out in various parts of the fabric to her swayings. Impressed as 1 was by the agreement amongst the men—and l had come besides to this forecastle with the memory very fresh in me pi the mysterious voices I had before lieard—I could scarcely hold my face as I stood listening, with my eye glancing from one hairy countenance to another. The variety of the Jacks' postures, the knowing cock of a. head here and there, the unwinking stare, the strained "barkening attitude, the illustration of superstitious emotions . by expressions -which were rendered grotesque by the swing of die lamp, the half-suffocated looks of some of the fellows who were trying to draw their breaths softly, formed a picture to appeal irresistibly to one's sense of the ridiculous. Three minutes passed ; it might have been hours, so long the time seemed. \- -" Seems ifB done jawing; whatever it is," said Finn. 'Tell 'ee it's ^ats, lads," eaid Finn. "4s the cuss wes meant for this 'ere craft," exclaimed the deep voice. that had bifore spoken, "perhaps if her owner was to come below, the eperrit, if so be it's that, 'ud tarnto and talkiout again." " Tell 'ee, its rats!" cried Finn, scornfully. - " Bats 1" exclaimed Crimp, with great irritation, "if that's all, why don't Sir Wilfrid lay foiraid and listen forhisself 1" "Won't he come!"said oiieof themen. "Come! no," rattledouttgrimp, and why? 'Cause he knows it's tile truth." " Well," exclaimed Cutbfll," speaking with all proper respect, 6j>ems to me that what's meat for thedawg ought to be meat for the man in the likes of such a liumble- come-tumble out of the maintop into the ma£J3iofil soft o* jot as this."

On raf^liing sight of me as I emerged out of the blind shadow on the forward part of the yacht, he cried out eagerly, "Well, what have you heard? Is it a voice, Chaxies I" " There is nothing to hear," I answered. " Finn disrespectfully calls it rats." " What else, your honour J " exclaimed Finn", " the squeaking of rats ain't unlike a sort o' language. Put the noise they make along with the straining of bulk- heads and the like of such sounds, and might be farmed a supernatural woice." Wijfrid burst into one of his great laughs, but immediately after said in a grave andjiollow tone, "Butypn,Charles, have before heard something preternatural in the shape of a haU off yonder quarter, and from the dead man yon found on the wreck." " Fancy, mere fancy,"I said. "Gracious mercy ! am I making this voyage to carry home with me a belief in ghoro I But I wish you'd go into the forecastle with Finn, Wilfrid, and listen for yourself. Make your mind easy: there's nothing to be heard. A visit from you will pacify the men. They hold that you admit the troth of what they allege by declining to satisfy yourself by listening. Their temper is not of the sweetest. Hey should be soothed, I think, when it is to be so easily done." He hung in the wind and said in a hesitating wav, "What do you think, Finn f" " Well, Sir Wilfrid, since, as Mr. Moneon says, there's nothen to hear and nothen therefore to cause ye any agitation, I dorn't doubt that a wisit from you would please the sailors and calm down their minds. I'm bound to say they're oneasv,—yes, I'm bound to say that." " Come, then," cried my cousin, and he strided impetuously into the darkness, followed by the skipper. I gave Miss Laura my arm and we started on a little walk. The awning was furled and the dew everywhere sparkled like hoar frost. The quiet night wind sighed in the rigging, and the yacht, a point or two off her course, and every sheet fiat aft, softly broke through the black quiet waters with dull pufi of phosphor at times sneaking by like the eyes of secret shapes risen close to the surface to survey us. The sheen of the binnacle light touched a portion of the figure of die fellow at the wheel, and threw him and a Begment of the circle whose spokes he held, out upon the clear, fine, spangled dusk in phantasmal yellow outlines, dim as the impression left on the retina by an object when the eyelid is dosed upon it. My fair companion and I talked of the incidents of the day. One thing was following another rapidly, I said. Twas like a magic—lantern show; scarcely had one picture faded out when something fresh was brightening in its room. " What manner of sound could it be," she asked, "that the sailors have interpreted into cursings and dreadful warnings!" " It was no fancy on my part anyway," said I, "let me put what face I will on it to Wilfrid. If what the men profess to hear be half as distinct as what I heard, there must be some kind of sorcery at work, I'll swear." (To be continued.)
