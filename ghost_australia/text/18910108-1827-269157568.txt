HEARTS-EASE. There is a flower I sought for vears, Heart s-ease and rest from care. For inv heart was crushed bv pain -and tears. And the world was lone and hare. Par from the madding crowd I went, I sought the flower alone. But still mv heart- with'woe was bent, And still my soul made moan. I sought the fight. I longed to die, I charged mid shot and shell. Death like a white mist passed ma by, "W here others dvmg fell. -l-^aTled-Tipowftielo^cW- sra.". - - I trod -a-foreign s"horc. 1 But-the ghost of sorrow followed mo For ever, ever more.
