But the fiwift reeollecticJn that her maid was busy there quickly decided her to the eonto- ary. Lucy knew she had gone to Lady Beaiichamp's boudoir. Lucy would naturally connect her agitation with that visit, and might, perhaps, leap at soine undesirable conclusion regarding Sir Eobert's wife. J*or Sir' EoBert's -saie; Sir Robert's wife must be protected. Lucy must not even indirectly be furnished with material for dish'o&outing; suspicions. Those thoughts inetinctiYely tearing their way through her brsifi, she tarned her flying feet in the opposite direction, making for a close stairray at the extreme length of the nail.

When she presently arose and hurried to the dining-Toom it was with a new and fixed resolve —& resolve wholly born of thiit scene, and one destined to trankport her stepmother's soul with malevolent joy. ' I will do it !' she said. \- And no Suspicion riaing warningly iu her mind of the deadly, cold-blooded scheme already matured against her in Lady Beanch&nip;'sinhra, she took the very path best calculated to proniote my laay^* monstrous ends. CHAtTEB VI. HTVTTINQ trim. TtOOHL. Nina found Sir Eobert and Lady Seauchamp in the dining-room, and, aa my lady had so gra ciously promised, amiably waiting ,her tardy ap pearance. There was no noticeable constraint. To the uninformed observer the family sky w&s; serene and cloudless. Sir Kobort wore his usual aspect, the wily ministrations of his beautiful young: wife, and the innocent gaiety of her lovely child, with his own niorbid pride of character, having each con duced to that desirable end. The luncheon passed ever without noteworthy event. But just as Lady Beauchanap -was putting aside her napkin, Nina electrified her, and frightened poor old Sir old Robert into pale dis may. * Papa/ she cried, an unconscious ring of de termination in h$r sweet young voice, ? papa, I Want you to let me go abroad.' For an instant the*e was a dead silence. Sir Eobert stared helplessly at the speaker. Lady Eeauelianip's eyes, just turned |-olitely at- ' tentive upon the girl's face, dashed to ier own plate,, and blazed thero with an astonishment, in credulity, and fiendish joy that no words would have enabled her adequately express. -'Playing into my own. hand!* she thought, breathlessly. Sir Robert broke in -upon her thought. ?fQo-abroad ! * he echoed. He spoke those two astounded words, and then turned his helpless gaze from Nina to Lady Beauehamp. At the instant that he did bo, my lady looked tip and met the glance. There was no mistaking the grave, cold, dis approval it conveyed. Sir fiobert read it, and turned quickly, and with a n&w; &ir; of decision, to Nina again. The girl's heart sank. Her eyes had followed his own and read her step-mother's face as' accu rately as he had scad it. - ? . ' He will refuse,* she thought, dejectedly, * and what then?'. But before Sir Eobert could utter the denial Lady Beauehamp hastily spoke. ' I think,' she said, addressing tin; baronet, and smilingly rising, ' 1 think it would be well to give Vina an audenco, deaf— that is, a short one, for I am going to pfitSii&de; you to drive with me to Doctor Jeffries'* this afternoon. I am not teeliugtiuite so -well — * 'I'll send for Jeffries*' broke in Sir Eobert, starting to his feet, and forgetting all about JMina end her astounding request. r. Lady Jje&uch;&inp; langhed, and, taking Isa by the hand, moved .with soft, sinuous grace to Sir Robert's side. 'My dear love,' she protested, merrily, 'you forget how 1 hate n stuffy doctor cowing to the house, and that I always go to Jeffries.' Then, before Sir Kolwjjrt could answer, she hastily re turned to the point from which thoy had wan dered. 'I was about to remark/ ;sUe said, the same disapproval gently .manifested in her eyea andtone— * I was about to remark :&a;* you and Nina had better discuss her proposition.

'Pardon me,' she said, a little haughtily, in answer to Lady Beauohamp's sugrfeestion, ' I will not#o into the library, papa.' 1 have no cause to argue.
