THE TOE OF OPIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO. The police estimate that in S&n; Francisco, with its population of about 300,000, there are not leas 3,000 habitual opium smokers. From a rather extended study of the class, in and out of Chinatown, I should say that this estimate is not exaggerated. There are certain -corners in the city which are the favourite haunts of the opium smokers. Here on any pleasant afternoon one may see the victims of the vice in all its stages. Most of them are young men, decently dressed, but giving unmistakable signs of their vicious life by their pallid faces, ghastly look, and ema ciated forms. Their skin is like that of con • victs long shut out from sun and air; their cheek-bones protrude above deep hollows, while the Bkin is drawn about the mouth in a way which is disagreeably suggestive of a grin* niug skeleton. All smoke cigarettes and all drink, for that the big vice crushes out the little one is a paradox whioh cannot be proved by experience. Most of these young men have been brought to this condition inside of three years. The living skeletons among them, "who are bo weak and nerveless that they brae© them- ! selves for support against a cellar railing or the side of a house, have been smoking for years. In oight or 10 yeatB, at the outside, •they will give up tho ghost, dying a death by inches, like tho consumptive, ever deluded by false hopes of recovery, and suffering the tor ments of the damnedforthe violation of nature a laws.
