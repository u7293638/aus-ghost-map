'Good man, Phelim!' cried the ring as the old inan finished, and, crossing his !hands atop his staff, waited for the applause. 'Good' man.. Phelim!' 'Bully boy?' 'Well, sung, me son!' 'Another!' skirled the ring; 'give us another! Give -us Connie Roe.' Phelim raised his staff. 'Silencer he called. ' 'Silenee! Don't be telliri' me what I'm to give ye.

Big^wi* years was she— peace to. her soul] — wi' years o' poyerty, an' care, an' woe. tight lie her bones.! All through the weary years she passed as one whose tongue dropped wisdom, whose life was pure, 'whose hand was ever stretched to give, when glviri' meant the etjntin' of herself. Her end was peace. Kind willin' hands were by to soothe her passin' an' send her eof Oy on -ber way. Peace to her soul!' The old man bowed his head for a moment in the silence of the market-place; then quicker, less doleful, the chant went on— 'An' now her neighbors come wi' willin' feet to eit an' smoke, an' sing sad songs, to wail, an' howl, an' glorify the dead wi' hide ous mockery of the awe of death. I see them now.' There in the mud-walled room —its rafters bright wi' smoke, the floor of clay, the single window small. an' dark, the gloom an' smoke blindin' as sleep — there on chairs, on etbols, on sods of turf, sit men an' women, old and young, ^iow speakin' tender o' the dead, now laughin' wild an' free, now hushed an' still as from ould hags, wi' faces wrung wi' grief, their withered arms stretch ed out to heaven, goes op the fearful ehrjekin* wail— a wail .like spirits cryin' through the night, a wail that thrills wi' dread one's very flesh an' makes the blood run cold. 'And in the middle o' the room is set a wooden bier. ; A^ plain and rude It is— the portion of the poor. .
