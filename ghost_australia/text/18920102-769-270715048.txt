A GRAVEYARD ADVENTURE, j “Then, boys, T suppose T have to go V’ I addressed the party with a cheerful tone of affected indifference, in hopes that some one among the number, more fond j of midnight adventures than I, would volunteer to act as my substitute. «Yes,’1 replied onu of the students, smiling, “ the die has cast your lot.” Having secured in me a tool to serve their purpose, they wished me success in my adventure ; and, bidding me good night, I soon found myself alone in the dissecting-room. As I sought for the implements requisite for suoh an adven ture as I was about to engage in, I in wardly wished that I had never begun the study of medicine ; and bitter were the invectives I cast against the fate that had selected me as the unfortunate one. Securing the necessary articles, I laid them on the table until such time as I was ready to sally forth. It wanted two hours to midnight; and to pass away the time, which I knew would hang heavily on my hands, I se lected from the book-case one of Fenni tnore Cooper’s works, “ Oak Openings.” Seating myself, I began its perusal, hop ing that it would prove sufficiently attrac tive to engross my attention. In vain did I try it. My mind was worked up to such a state of nervous excitement by the thoughts of coming events which did tiot “cast their shadows before,” that every line I read contained, in my imagination, such horrid deeds of murderers, stalking ghosts, and gravediggers, that in disgust I hurled it from me. In its flight it came in contact with a skeleton which stood beside the door, and with a dull thump knocked it over, scattering the bones hither and thither over the floor. W ith dilated eyes I gazed upon the wreck ; but being too timid to touch the sacred bones of the departed dead at that hour of the night, and especially when there was no one in hailiug distance, I decided to let the august particle of said deceased try a night’s lodging on the bare boards. “ Surely,” thought I, as I consulted the spirits within my pocket companion, in order to revivo my own spirits, “ he won't feel any worse than I do.” Imagine my feelings as I sat there, with “no one to love,” or cheer me up with conversation. Nothing but grim old skeletons surrounding me on all sides. The “ Oak Openings ” had knocked over the candle and blown the light out; but I was not “ left to pine away in total darkness.” The mellow, silvery beams of the moon, which was then high in the heavens, came peering gently through the windows into the room. The evening wa3 clear and cool; and the passing winds, swaying to and fro the branches of an old elm which stood beside the house, caused them occasionally to grate against the window blinds, and me to startle with fear, while I would conjure up wandering spirits without, sighing their mournful dirges, perhaps craving admittance to re monstrate against my projected desecra tion of the graves of their companions. I staggered to the window and gazed forth, hoping to find something without that would divert my attention. But for the lowing of distant herds, and a discordant quartette gratuitously gotten up by sun dry sympathetic and decidedly unpathetic specimens of the feline species, who were perched on a fence directly beneath my window, all nature seemed at rest. I was torturing my mind into a pitch of frenzy by my gloomy meditations, when I heard with joy the old town clock ring out the hour of midnight. Hastily throwing on my overcoat, I buttoned it tightly about my throat, making the collar hide my face as much as possible. Concealing about my person the articles I needea, I slouched my hat carelessly over my eyes, and silently descending the stairs, I was soon out in the street. It was a glorious night. The minutest objects were visible at quite a distance ; and had not the moon, which was sailing majestically through the silver- tinted clouds directly above me, convinced me to the contrary, I would surely have laboured under the impression that it was broad daylight. The gentle zephyrs cares singly touched my cheeks as they danced murmuringly along ; and, indeed, it was just such a night as gallant swains would select for a promenade wherein they un disturbed might whisper into their idols’ willing ears the oft-told story of their love. But it was anything but such a night as I would nave selected for the per petration of the outrage for the accom plishment of which I had been delegated. An hour elapsed before I came in sight of Cypress Cemetery. As I approached its boundaries the cold white marble monuments came in view ; and the unac countable courage which I had displayed on my way from the dissecting-room and through the silent streets thither suddenly flagged. I commenced trembling with fear, and while my heart palpitated vio lently, and almost audibly, cold shivers ran through me, and beads of icy perspi ration gathered on my brow. This was the first time I had ever visited a graveyard in the silent, solemn hours of midnight ;and I turned to flee from the spot as I thought of the atrocious crime I was about to commit. But thoughts of the scornful contempt with which my companions would receive me if I proved myself, in their estimation, a coward un equal to the task, nerved me ; and 1 de termined to securo the corpso at all hazards. Vaulting the cemetery fence with no light heart or willing bound, I crouched beneath the shades of the cypress foliage to secure my movements from any casual observer, should any be lurking about, as was oftentimes the case. As I stealthily crept along, thinking how miserable I would feel should any one dis turb the gravo of my own dead mother, for whom I was then in mourning, I wa3 startled by a voice whispering to me in slow, measured accents—“ Do unto others as you would bo done by.” I turned to face tho speaker; but no one was there beside myself j and attri buting the language used to some of the many freaks of my imagination, I con tinued my way in silence. The monotonous quiet that prevailed throughout the cemetery was suddenly disturbed by the crowing of cocks in an adjacent farm. Thinking that the com ing day was dawning, I turned to see if the moon had gone down, when, tripping, I stumbled prostrate over a grave. I felt the ground trembling beneath mo ; I was sinking—sinking ! I tried to rise ; I could not, and I cried aloud for help. Oh, tho untold misery of that moment! A tremendous roar, as if in liis indig nation Jupiter had cast a thousand thunderbolts at once from tho heavens, and amid flames and chaos I was sent flying through the air. I fell again sense less, and when I awoke it was only to confront a grim phantom which stood directly bofore me. « Arise 1" it commanded ; and sotno in visible aid brought me to my feet, for I was too weak and terrified to assist myself. With lire flashing from his eyeless sockets, and teeth clenched, it hissed its addresses to me— • _ ■
