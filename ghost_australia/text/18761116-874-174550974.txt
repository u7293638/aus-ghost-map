ONE TOUCH OF NATURE- Joys of life, how fleeting. CLOSE by the open window hung A portrait set in gold and pearls— The likeness of a maiden young, With laughing lips and glossy curls, That clustered o'er her forehead white, And cast a deep-toned shade above Two dark blue eyes, where shone the light Of innocence and mirth, and love. And one gazed on the counterfeit, Admiring rooted to the spot— It had recalled some old time sweet, That once had been, but now was not. And who was he ? One well might guess He in the world held no high place— A hapless outcast by his dress— A wretched sinner by his face ! The portrait seemed to smile on him, As on some old friend loved and dear— And lo ! the wanderer's sight grew dim With sad and unaccustomed tear. Oh ! bitter tears are those that fall From sinful men of many crimes, When memory lifts oblivion's pall, And shows the ghost of other times. Did it recall a mother's face That he shall see on earth no more ? Or one that in his heart held place In those too happy days of yore ? His trembling hands forth he did stretch Unto the portrait, and he took it, Then said : "At least a pound 'twill fetch ; And as I've eyed it, now I'll hook it!"
