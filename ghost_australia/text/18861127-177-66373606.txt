Observer," in hie letter to BB |ast week, hy implication! made out *bat the management of the local hospital was orien jip set-era condemnation ; and while we freely admit that a public institution and its managetterit should be closely watched, in ¡order tljat the public should be protected, I "we think it ooiy fair to (be other side to give «fait itatetnfent.of fatu-at any rate, as far -jftjn san' discover. Very well, then ; we have ascertained from the inmate himself the man with ¿he fractured thigh-how his thigh was broken, how ho was brought into the Windsor Hospital, and by whom. What treatment he received, and has received since ; and generally all about him. 'Dennis -Wolfe is a farmerlat "RïebnïSno'"Bottoms; 68 years of age, and .has been 49 years in the district. He isj strong Jkejirjy,,-obi man£-^ "tfSrU 'as nails-just tKe aort of man to get over anything, pennis was, on the 10th instant? tethering a horse, which broke away from, him, anAip the scbA* Dennis had hts left thigh frÄlurea, ««ici bit left thumb. He was broughtyn\ou]Jv*indsor by Mr. Powell, and takín to" ibé^iospílaJ. On the road to WinasojÇ wà'^îy mention, they met a doctor,jwhojàskjgWèinjured man what was the míüeri ßffl lipon being told, asked whether^twas Oleeging, and upon reoeiving an nnsWer, 6aid« ^ Çet along to the hospital : they'll #!kencare *i Jou there!" Dennis wai takfen tp jbe hospital, and has, so far as we can learn from him, been well taken care of ever since; Dr. Hosier was certainly 110! »n Wiqdsor.-but as the patient , was- not in a "sinking state, but a strong hale .old man, the Superintendent did, under the circumstances, what any Burgeon would-be applied the necessary bandages and 'made ncf'attempt whatever to reduce the fracture, as the Hrai was so much swollen. Wolfie states thai he was not in the hospital more1 than' à quar ter of an hour before he was-- made Comfort, ablp and pretty /ree from pain. <\- Dr/Hoziei returned by the 7 o'clock trulni und'wönt tc the hospital before going kwte i «a* Wolfie, and apprnved^of what Mr. Howley lhac done-" You couldn't haye done -better,' said the doctor.

' While on the matter of sending foroutsid medical assistance, we may, in the interest of Immunity, truth, and fairless, relate ho' one dark, stormy, rainy Cnight, a poi fellow who bad been frightlolly injured b an explosion of a blast,-up Colo way, wi brought into Richmond to a medical mai The poor fellow was in a >a'd'~ plight ; bol hands and arms injured and scorchei nearly blind, and severely injured in othi portions of his bo3y-we't to the skin, col( and miserable. There waa-;no .relief; t good Samaritan was at hand. Cart hi away to'Wiudsorl and the advice jvas.acu upon. Dr. Hoaier was caUed np,-after, mi nij/ht to atfend one of the Jnost dismal ai heart-rending objects atan tó«íd¿loíjíf'-!upo Washed him, cleaned him, and annointed li wounds, and sent bim to .the hospital Macquarie-street-Where he now is und Mr. Holley's care. And as he lies on 1 bed, strapped and bandaged up, with t poor face blistered and teared, his ey nearly closed, he looks more like a raumn than a man. John Houghley. tells us't tale we have juBt written-with this adc tion, that he had to pay £1 for his n.idni¡ ride in the cart-in tuet and cold-from Ric mond to Windsor. And yet these a Christian times, when men talk of ** Christi Charity," Our corespondent, *. Observer" refers a matter that occurred eighteen months ag Au old woman was admitted into t hospital, discharged, and sent back to 1 home to die-and no reason assigned.' Well, we have made enquiry-it' will seen that in this matter we are anxious to »balls right between the public and t management of our local hospita'-and have discovered the reason. The old Ia was a Mrs. Yates;, who was brought to ! hospital, very much against her wish, at t instance of a well-to-do relative. She v not admitted, but was taken into 1 Superintendent's private room, and w cared (or until the Committee had be advised of the matter. That hody, knowi the circumstances Ol the case, considei that the old lady was not a fit subject to admitted ; inasmuch as it was »(ini her wish ; and her friends were in position to provide medical attendai and nursing oimide. She was, the lore, sent home in the cab which brou; her. Under these circumstances, heartily agree with the action of the Co mittee. People of means have no right foist their sick or aged relations upo charily for the miserable pittance nf shillings a week. Th refort-, we think, correspondent has made out a very had t in titi» instance, because thc old lady have mentioned had friends within* hours distance. As to the general management of hospital and asylum, we shall, at all tit be only too ready to afford space to anyb TT- ~ ' ^ -TT !.-*.'^r*r: , tqiçrhMtii th> committee nf* «pose i»)>«í» wrong,Vti&'iß Institutions «auqot br too closely watched, «nd lb« Pre*s would be failing in its duty were it not to make public anything thaï bore even (be ghost of aus* pieion; but at the «amo time, it has a double -,( duty to perform,^'and .should protect, where necessary, those who sue liable, at all times, . to be suspected, '.
