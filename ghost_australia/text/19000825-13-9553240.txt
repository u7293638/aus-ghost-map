PARIS EXHIBITION FAILURES. Has anybody any idea of the money that has been sunk in private enterprise for the exhibition? Certified capital suns to just on £2,500,000, and this does not include a dozen or more instances of private enter- prise. The rolling platform got its money on the assumption that 40 per cent. of the visitors would use it. Their shares are far from par to-day. Grand Roue shares are to be had for a song; the Hippodrome is not a financial success; Columbia is closed; the exhibition of "Paris in 1400" has yielded up the ghost, and in various directions 51 bankruptcies have been declared. Never in the world's history of exhibitions has there been such a magnificent show; but for some reason or another it will not boom.— "Referee."
