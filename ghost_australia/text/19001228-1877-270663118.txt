QsisHngs exchanged, -Bernard STaubrayed the young lawyer-1« his studio in the ulned-Tower ; a proeeeding of good ausury, for Valctit'ft lever knew that none bU"ths rtist's mod intimate friends were actmittaS' here. 1 Manrioe was -not a native of Bern; : e was born and brought up ia Fans, and -opon the advice of friends had selected the Swiss criy as a promising field for the exercise of his profession.- He had had . -aunphill ..fight, and it was. only after somo years of-^struggle that he had'succeeded In . planting- his " foot firmly- on: the»ladder.- Through the -friendly offices of Dr. Weber, whose good favour he had won; a complicated case bristBng with difficulties had been placed in hts hands, failure was predicted oy«.U the legal Inminaries of Berni and Maurice n, felt that failure meant more to hitn than:the mere - losing of the . case. He had seen Valerie , and loved her; but Dr. Weber alone was in the., secret of his attachment - to Bernard Maubray's daughter. - "Yon will not bein.a position to present yourself as her lover," said the kind doctor to the ambidousyoung man, "until you have made a name. foe yoursdf. Now prove the mettle you are made-of. Here is a case 'which ninety-nine lawyers .out of a hundred would lose.

Talented, ambitious, and full of enthusiasm, he fell himself now .justified, in-proffering his suit: for Valerie's hand, and it was for this purpose ho had written to Bernard -Maubray fotL an .interview on her birthday. Introduced to the .family by Dr. Weber- he soon became a .favourite-.in - Crow's- Nest, and ^he. progress of. the love affair, waa watched ;by; Bernard Maubray OTtb. silent \- approval. Bntprepared aahe was foritsnatural' development it .was.not without, a-pang. that -he.contemplated surrendermg his daughter tc another man's care. The last few-months-oi close association with "her -had proved to him that «he waB worthy. of the: best he 'had: to bestow. He. was one of. those men, to, -whom the bestowal of -love brings the sweetest - pleasures, and in common, with 'all' nobU natures he found it a greater blessing to give than to receive. The sorrows of bis past life were chastened ; he ,did not,, he could not, forget, -but the violence of his grief hadpassed away. To this happier irame or mind Vnlerifi had largely; contributed; Considerate, .and thoughtful to an unusual degree ina. young girl, she had so ministered to him as to revive all that was best-in; his- nature, and at the same time .to implant in his heart a boundless love for her.: JTher-e; "was in this a possible danger—a danger that, nnder .certain not impossible conditions, it might lead to violent- :extremes. .. Had this been pointed-out to. him-he would have listened with iilti-edulous ears, bnt it was none the less true that he had become morbidly nervous for.her. safety.; ThegTOwth of this feeling commenced upon the receipt of ,tho letter. which 4ad been addressed' to her by an anonymous correspondent. He wonld wake up in the middle of the night-with the thought.in his mind, - >'.' Is Valerie safe ?"; and he rwould steal from 'his room to listen at her door,;-and:to walk - softly through the house and often-into the grounds in .search of some: hidden enemy.. Tender and strong-minded as he was, there came into play a quality, of intensify whieli caused' -.him -to insensibly magnify: «very- incident; or circumstance: in relation: to. her. Given knowledge or. suspicion that her happiness was in:peril, and that anenemy was resJly watchinghisoppor*: tunity to, do her an ill-turn, .-he: would.have sa: brooded-upon it that it: was likely the eveu balance of his brain: would-be disturbed and' his' usually clear judgment clouded.- Thic partiality, and,disposition-..to morbid- 1 inclining sprang entirely:from- his personal^,ffections ; in all other matters he was impartial; unbiassed. • On'two occasions a singular occurrence ha£ puzzled .him. - • On: the first occasion he iwas ffltting: ng late, -when' all.in the house-had retired to rest. Fancying lie heard a sound without, he went into the grounds to ascertain the cause. 'He sa* nothing, and heard nothing more to warrant the fancy, bnt be brpoded upon it, and he diS not. gjo to bed-tUl - past midmglit;- The next day, as he was passing into the public road through the front gate, he saw upon the ground a small gold-pencil, of which he recol* -lected having made free use before he-went t(b his bedroom. Of this he was convinced, asd he could -not: understand how it could hav« found its way to the .spot npon- which.-hib: •found-it.. .-• -.- '.- ' • . •'-.'"''- \- On the- second occasion the introductory ' circumstances were of a similar nature. Agaift he was 'sittingnp late when the members of hia household were in their beds. Again hi' fancied he heard a sound outside the house. He stole; to Valerie's door and heari her soft breathing. She slept with hoe door unlocked, and with a night-light burning. Softly opening the door, he saw thaA she.was slumbering peacefully. Again bs went out, and could discover no cause for thi .fancy. It wafe raining, and. there was mu4 on the paths. - He recollected, or thought be . recollected, that upon his return to the .honsfe he had exchanged his muddy shoes for a pais of slippers; Again he retired to rest after midnight. The next morning , he noticed thj^i the slippers he had worn,, and which now on the bedroom floor, were covered with mud, He asked himself how- the mud could hav4 : got upon tliem, and he searched his memory' -whether he -had worn them before he went into the grounds. After a-period of reflection -'he decidedthat his memory -must be at faulty, and .that. they, must have' been on -his feet when he walked through -.the-grounds. He made no mention-of these incidents, and, no further alarm occurring, he ceased to troabls himself about them. - Closeted now •: with Maurice, the young. man explained the purport of his visit, and in- modest .and well-chosen -words solicited .Maubray's .consent to his suit witk Valerie. ' "-Certain worldly questions must bo askei ,-aBsl a»®»ered"before I cen give you a reply,'* s&id; Efsnbray. " There is a material side.te: this: matter.
