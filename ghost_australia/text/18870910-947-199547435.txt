CHAPTER I. i; A white country road, winding up and; down and round, the bare, lonely_ hills, led J I ! into the yalley.* Ito'a'ine to an 'abrb^t' end '** at; the ; ford of the stream which, rising; in the distant hills beyond, flowed through the valley. ,: ... : , - ^'A 'few '? yards above the) ford was a wooden foot-bridge. Its planks were; rotten and worm-eaten, and the stones in the ford, slippery with green weed as they ?were, offered almost a; safer-footidg;if At the other side of the f o'rdi the road was taken up again^i only now it was rough . and yrass-g'rowri/scattered with the ruins ?of the grey stone ^walls' which'bordered it, and which, froriVthe neglect of years, had fallen ap'artTintq 'great gaps. The »-oad led up 1 to a, 'stone .archway, closed by great. iron gate's j 'all.rusty and stiff on their hinges. From the archway, the valley ? '' ''sloped' down gently, green and soft with ':?'? ^turf,! to the old cotton-mill 'Which'1 stood, a''(I with its burden of loneliness, and stillness, '''''upon the'b'arik of the rushing - stream. The cotton-mill faced up the valley1, jits back to the fprdj the loud-voicedwater.on A'T.tB right liana.' ; ?':-- -s '?'-''' ' '''??' ' j .,-??? iOnvthe;opppsite bank stood the deserted homes- of' th:e ?-'mill-hands; wlio had once \-- laboured among the darting shuttles, and '* whirring wheels of the now Bilent mill.' All spattered now— only their houses with rotting wood and blistered paint, re mained/flookingiacross the stream at the = iriill rthrough thoUong hot summer days, and their fragrant dewy nights ; through, the biting ^blasts .and grey desolation 61 winter months, with their long hours of darkness ;'when» the wind swept round the. bare, bleak hills at the eutrance of the ?valley,'- -arid 'rushed up it to- torture the trees of the woods beyond with their icy burden of sleet and snow. . i id ? - Between these woods and the ,.-nilj, some . -half-way up: the valley, stobdiiliVlhouse 1 once . inhabited by the owners of the de serted factory. It, too, was cloned. It was an unusually hot afternoon for, ' - September; - The valley— which was. beau '™ tiful with scarlet berried ash, and soft turf.and rushing water — was flooded, with sunshine. But while, it sparkled in the , ,v watorB, aud darkened into quivering leaf shadows beneath the trees, it became only 'a painful mocking glare, as it struck the 'grey walls of the mill. For it showed up every trace and stain of time and weather. A man who had been standing looking . . up at the mill,8oemed to notice this weird . 1 change in the sun's influenoe. -, 1 'When the sun shines into a sepul 1 ohre, it ' only shows the dead things within,' he Baid. He-spoke aloud, all unconsciously. „.!.. But the sound of his own voice roused him, and he glanced hastily round with the: sudden shame' of a reserved: man who 'had unwittingly given expression to some deep feeling, ?' Major Brandon's brother officers and ' acquaintances would have been consider ably surprised ait hearing such a speech , break from the polished man of the worl d, (who never seemed to i believe -? much in I anything,, ipr jcare^muph .for anything, ior % indeed' feel much about anything. '' j , 'A '- '''But therelwas rid 'brietoear tofcear. He and the mill with its' houses had the valley all to themselves. The only sounds that broke its' stillness were the voices of the water rushing .between its banks, the whirr of an insect's .wing through the sunlit air, the distant sighing of the , wind, as it stirred; the leaves in the woods at the upper end of the, valley. He laughed slightly, with a sense- of re lief at the loneliness. ., : ' Life is certainly too short to goiso far down as the bones,' he thought as he turned, away, and Btrolled down (to the stream to look' at the houses km' the op posite bank. „. , r ,,.. ,, ,y ', .

Then came the Bound of hurrying1 feet across the'' polished oak of the hall, a fumbling at the chains and look of the' door, and a heavy .breathing as if the person opening'had run^ with haste some distance; Major Brandon, remembering that his housekeeper was asthmatic arid rheumatic, and not so young as she had been, was ashamed of \ his impatience. His face softened till it became again that of the calmest and most popular man in his regiment. It , wouldjlbe a:pleasant surprise for the good old soul to see him standing ,so unexpectedly outside. The door was opened only far enough for the old woraan.to put herhead out. : The effect, upon her- of, her master's apparition was ludicrous in its complete consternation; ' . ; ? : ?,:'?'? 'Mr. Routh! Lor? V: Who'd have thought it ! ' she ejaculated, her impulse; 'evidently ja' very decided one; to slam' the ddor#|iWlface.'

' ; ; ':.:; ' 'c^ej'ix^Scyi,' midior ni.aftter laugh ing at her ridiculous surprise ; ' aren't you glad to see me ? ' . She ;broke into voluble greetings; but while her face, really expressed genuine delight, it was evident that her first alarm still lingered. 'Bless your dear, handsome faoe, Mr. Routh ! Of course I'm glad !' with a nervous glance behii.il her into the dusky depth of 'the great square hall, for the painted windows that lighted it were thiok with dust. ' But you did give me such a turn! It is just four, years since you were here last. And you have al ways written before ! But it does one's heart good to see you !' Then her affec tionate outburst was checked by a sudden recollection. ' Of all the unlucky days !' she thought. They had moved down the hall, and were facing one of the doors opening on it. The sound of a turning handle was heard. The old lady, with an exclamation of terror, flung herself in front of her master, as he was innocently going to wards the door. The Jhasty movement brought her just in front of his long legs. He clutched at her to save her as they tripped over each other, and at the same seoond, as they stood locked in each other's arms, the door opened. 'Mrs.- Herbert, when are you going to get that kettle to boil ?' , The old lady slipped from her maater's relaxed arms, . and sank gasping end fan ning1' her face into , a chair behind her, while the Major himself, totally un conscious that she had even gone, stood transfixed, staring at the doorway. ,,t y ., , ? .. , CHAPTER II.-. ...-. :.,. ? IJA'teainatj the; background o£, a|room of' .noble! proportions stood a girl.' Jj3he had a large knife in one hand, and ateapot in the other. Her. feet, as they had come down the long room, had left footprints in the dust, whioh lay thiok on the floor, and a cobweb she had brushed off from somewhere was still clinging to her shoulder. Major Brandon caught sight of cobweb and footsteps, and followed the latter, still helplessly and mechanically, up che -room till they ceased before a little table set out with' teacups in front of the wide marble fireplace. Then his eyes came back to the girl in the doorway, who met them, now that the first Blight shook of surprise at seeing him so ardently em braoing the old housekeeper was over, with the calmest indifference. , , 'I'm dying for tea,'.. she said, with a slightly impatient flourish with her tea pot. Before Mrs. Herbert, muttering some incoherent explanation as Bhe rose stiffly, could take it from her hand, Major Bran don -possessed himself of it, the unde niable beauty of the young lady-in the doorway completely restoring hia presence of mind. ' { '' Go and make the tea, Nancy, aud ibe sure the kettle boils,' he said gravely; handing it to his housekeeper. ?'? j ' Then raising his hat he turned: away. ...

Mrs. Miller at the eight of her regained, with con siderable effort, some self -control, and she went; more steadily -forward to moet the housekeeper. .-J-- i-.ii';..,V(--iiv: I 'I don't think we will stay for tea after all, Mrs. Herbert. I feel dread fully ashamed, as it is for having yielded to my daughter's freak. What Major Brandon will think of our impertinenoe I don't know. At any rate, we will go away at once.' ' Oh, please don't, ma'am !' exclaimed the housekeeper in dismayed remon strance. ' He isn't angry one bit, and he'll think it is all my fault if you go. I am sure the house would be better for a .good many more such freaks. Only I should like to have dusted up a bit be fore you came. Oh, do please stay,' as Mrs. Miller still continued drawing on her gloves to leave; 'he'll think it so queer. ' Mrs. Miller started as if some thought had stiuck her. Then she hastily pulled off her gloves again. . ' You are quite right,' she Baid. ' We will |have tea. It is the only apology we can make now— to accept his kindness.' She was speaking in her usual tone, quiet, ladylike, with a touoh of 'querulous dis content habitual to it. Her daughter, still bewildered by that strange emotion,, had a dim idea that her mother was try ing to efface the remembrance of it. For ' a ; moment she did riot move. 'Do as you are told, Joanna,' said her mothor sharply, 'and come and pour out the tea.' ? ? ?-? ? ? Joanna did as she was told, and sat down astonished. The next second, however, she jumped up again, only remembering the man who had been made their host in spite, of him-' ?self; ? ? ?' ?' . .-':''i'v|j- 'I should choke at the first mouthful if T hadn't made our pence. I shall apologise, as it was only 1 to blame.' - The mother -looked-up into heir bright eager face, and again that faint- tremor as of nervous fear stirred her. Then with a half-caught breath, she told her to go, but not to be long. Joanna certainly did not feel that it was at all probable that she would be long. The idea of facing Major Brandon was enough. As she left the drawing room she caught sight of Major Brandon standing inside the door of the great dining room opposite. ;; He. came slowly forward, as she hurried across to him, wondering how on earth Bhe was to com mence her .agology, the very apology seeming to deepen the impertinence 'of forcing herself into ,hiB, house j after his express: commands that no one should be admitted. His first question changed her1 perplaxed shame into the deepest peni tence. ,,.,..., -.,:.; 'A: '.{ Can I do anything . for you ?. ..I.hope Mrs.He'rbert has given you all you 'need,' he said courteously^ though there' wks Ah amused consoiousrie's'a'of her ' distress ;in the smile which accompanied the polite - question.

Will you come and have tea with us 1' Then came' ;the dis mayed repentance, . as she remembered, suddenly her mother's strange trouble at the mention of his name. But, as usual, the repentance came too, late. '; :- ' 'I shall be only too glad !'' he Baid, eagerly. There was nothing to do but carry her brilliant thought through its lamentable failure. She led the way, with a Btrong sensation of their position being ? reversed — she,' the hostess, arid he, the intrusive stranger— and a still more strong convic tion that he waa enjoying the, situa tion.' . ' ' . ., ? ' ?' ?': He's making the greatest fun of me,' thought poor Joanna. ' And what will mother say?' ,-,-,, . - . -. .-.- ' She glanced desperately .towards: the,, teatable as they paBsed into the drawing-' room. Hermother was sitting therejrand to the girl's intense; relief showed no signs of discomposure at 1 seeing . them ; . enter ' itogetber; she ever( greeted 1 them with a smile as theyoamf up ,- arid when ' Major Brandon waB introduced to her it was evident that, personally, he was a total stranger to her, for she looked at him with a faint curiosity in her eyes, as if wondering what manner of man he was. He, too, apparently was as innocent of any acquaintance with her ; and as they sat down by the little tea table, they drifted into the conversation of polite commonplaces habitual to perfect stran gers. Joanna poured out the tea utterly mys tified, for it almost seemed as if her mother's words had meant something more than this. But Bhe was still too penetrated with a sense of their unbidden presence, and an anxiety to make as favourable an impres sion with their tea party as . they could, to speculate very muoh on the mystery if there were one. She soon began to yield to the influences of the moment instead, whioh promised to be really pleasant. Major Brandon showed such sublime unconsoiousness of drinking out of his own best teacups, and eating off his own costly inlaid table, which Mrs. Herbert had unsbrouded from its careful packing cloths for Joanna's benefit, that her heart was filled with admiration and gratitude. She managed, too, as he talked to her mother to take a better look at him. All the interest she had before felt for this unknown hero of so melancholy a past, was deepened tenfold by this personal acquaintance with him . Not a common fact by any means, as even Joanna in her short life knew ;? no, she was certainly not disappointed as she had half expected to be. This stalwart x^ major of Dragoons was all that her imagi nation, guided by. soraps of gossip and broken threads of stories heard at the farmhouse in the valley, had' painted. He had once led a forlorn hope ; he 'had saved, at the peril of his own, three*'men from a dreadful death. Yes, she could quite believe it. ' Six feet three in his socks, I'm,' sure, and as strong as a giant, and such a pleasant voice. Nearly forty, I should say. ' Bather good features, . chin per haps a little too long- — isn't that a sign of weakness? I think I've read so some where. His eyes are just a 'little too small; but perhapa it is that sleepy, half-shut look whieh gives him, the ap pearance of beiug conceited.' ' 'Might I ask you what i;you- are thinking of so gravely ?'?' '' i ' The question was so unexpected,' and he] turned so. suddenly from her mother, (hat. she. had:. no time to withdraw;.1 her thoughtful eyeB absorbed as they were in her interesting speculations.
