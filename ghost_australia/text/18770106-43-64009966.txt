DICKENS FROM THE SPHERES. At the Alfred-hall assembly-room on Wed- gi nesdav December 20, Mr Martell, lecturer on m spiritism delivered a discourse, purporting I to be directly communicated by the spirit of a Charles' Dickens to the lecturer. The attend- w ance was very small, but in spite of this. shortly afteri8 o'clock Mr Martell mounted the platform; He said that some months ago the spirit of CharlesDickens had appeared to him, and proniised to deliver through him a tl series of lectures or. critiques upon his own works. This promise had been recently ful filled, and the lecthre he would read was, and must be taken as, the words of Dickens, who .,would be represented by him. The .'spirit" asking for a gracious hearing stated .that in life he had looked upon the return b of disembodied spirits to earth as very impro- b bable though not imDossible. Experience had taught him differently-that the heavy Cl gates that opened to receive the soul did not shut.closely behind it, and Ahat some souls were allowed to-resume werke for-the benefit of mankind which might hare egaged their attention dunngmortal life. That the U spirit nature was not immediately changed after death was shown by tLhefat, that he o held many of his wayward fame stll, tl, though sometimes reproved by" ?i wiser friends.

The lecturer, or slirlt, hy extracts from the tale 6f "Scroe ge and Marley, showed how sympathy with others, and practical expressions of this syml:athy, brought their own reward in hali piness and humuan love. The tone of tl:e lecture Was very much in the style of Dickens' writing-so like, in fact, that several times we noticed short sentences aiid Siaragrali.hs from his norids apd sketc':es. At' its conclusion Mfr. Martell announced that DLicsens had. promised' to ccmmuica.-te, to him in a few wethks a tecture'olithe "rFoibles of ilickuwick," which woulld afterwards be It - .1y t,
