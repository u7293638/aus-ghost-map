MR. J. DEWRURST AS " HAMLET." Last evening, at the Royal Princess Theatre, to a pood house, Shakespeare's sublime tragedy "Hamlet" was produced. It is nearly three months pinco Mr Di- whurst's former representa tion of the Prince of Denmark, and his acting last evening was of the samo high order as then. In the scene with his mother at the grave of Ophelia, and in the last,his unquestionable talonta were most vividly dispiaj'ed, and the applause which followed each of these successive efforts were loud and long. As the ghost, Mr H. K. Walton's acting was good, but his representation of Laertes was a better one. Mr «T. G. Joyce was very successful as Polonius, indeed he and Mr Walt«»n supported Mr Dewhurat most worthily. Miss Emma Bronton was v- ry good as Ophelia, and for her acting in the difficult yet boautiful mad scene was deservedly applauded. The character of ICir.g Claudius was moat feebly sustained, but then there is often murder in the acting as well as in the plot, Mr IT. Daniels played the part of the First Crave-digger very successfully. This evening Mr Djwhiirst will appear as •'Richelieu," and as thin is generally considered his cleverest representation, there should bo a large attendance.
