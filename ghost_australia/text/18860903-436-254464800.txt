BURNING DIAMONDS. In the year 1094 it was discovered, by actual experiment, at Florence that a diamond would bnrn. Cosmo III. had one fixed in the focus of a turning glass, and after some exposure to the rays of the sun, it cracked, coruscated, and finally disappeared like a ghost, leaving no trace behind. Another potentate, the Emperor Francis I., tried a number of valuable diamonds in the beat of a melting furnace, and may have felt some gratification in finding that they had disappeared. This was in 1750, and about 20 years later a magnificent diamond was burned in France. A jeweller named Le Blanc denied the possibility of burning diamonds, and snspected some unfair play on the part of Macquer, the chemist who conducted the operation. He had often, he asserted, exposed diamonds to great heat, with the sole result of increasing their brilliancy. Then another jeweller, Halliard by name, who 6eems to have had a suspicion of the scientific truth, put three diamonds into an earthen-bowl pipe packed in powdered charcoal, and exposed them without injury to intense heat. Lavosier, who was present, proved in 177(5 that by shutting out the air the diamond was preserved in a furnace, but that the admission of oxygen, with which the carbon combines, allows the diamond to burn like a piece of coal.
