Your committee deem it incumbent on them to take this opportunity-of convoying the thanks of the club to ibo ground oompany for tho liberality which-bas induced thorn to dispense with tho regular ground fees, as far os regards its members.

Waddy, with an average of 20; Messrs, E. leeton and O. Anderson coming next, with the reepeolivo averages of 18 and 12, and 0 over, for eleven matches eaoh. The bat awarded to the h-ghost scorer in tbo third eleven bas been obtained by Mr, Harrie. Mr. E. Gordon may, however, be placed RS proxirae accessit. In bowling the only averages ablo to bocompil.d from, tho scoring books are those of tho first : eleven, from which' it appears that Mr.- N. Thompson, the1 club professional, averaged SV and 12 bvor,:for fourteen innings; G. H. Gordon, 2 and' G over, for ton innings; and Aldis, tho. high average of 6 and 1'over, for the tb reo innings in which he bowled. Whilst referring tb'tho averages, your committco think it expediont to point ont to the members' of the olub, ncting SB eoorors, and to the captains of the rb spective elovens, tbe absolute necessity-of . exercising more supervision and care in respect ta the Club Soaring Books.' ' Tbo.grcute'Bi dilficnlty bas been experienced in calculating tho averagib for the'past-season; in co'riot quenco of tho .'caruless'and slovenly manner in whii.-h BOma of tho scores'havo been kept; and it ia exceedingly probable ' that,'unless'odditionnl attention is exhibited next-season in-keeping the:different scores, no-person wilt be found willing to undertake the arduous'dutyof compilibg4he club avor«gea therefrom. 1 .
