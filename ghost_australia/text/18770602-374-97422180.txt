We extract the following .from the Courier of the l?th instant :-^The first iskue of tiie Government jyaUyHansard made itaappearance on the 16th, and ,was on sale at onepenhy per copy at tlie Ctoverninent Printing Office. The demand was, «e;: xiti&erstand;, rather limited, . and did not nfet^it^le; ajiy addition'to' the jpublishing staff of the o^fic^ nor cause1 aiiy interruption to the tr^ci&i;'WilUain-street" The ^nejp publication; f<|ncded' the: subjfect of 'a lively debate, in .the. ii^gislafeve Assembly, juid membere generally, seei&Vatfier; disappointed at fihding that it does j their expectations all.at once, : either'as ah. accurate exponent of what they nieSn' ,fe>: sayj or' as a circulating medium of ! political Opinion' between them and their oon-. stituents. .This is jnuch.more the fault of hon. niemlte^lii^of me;Witosar£ stkj£ and is the cO^Sjt^n^e' bf greai expectations based on extreme ignorance of the ' difficulties attending the' production of such' apublicatioiL. This dis appointment we from the first predicted, because. we knew intimately the effort which it requires on the;part' of skilled men familiar with Parlin, meritaijy practice, and the questions defeated .in ofir £e£i^ture, to produce dally greatly /grim-, msriaedireportsof the proceedings oTthe previous' day. Kjiowing aUthLjjtoo, We deprecate the severe and sweeping dondemnation of this first effort ih which some hoiL members Indulged yesterday. They entirely want of knowledge or from : want of^muderation, to mate 4*ie auo waiice for the great diiadvant^es uhdfer which the report was produced.;Itnas many inaccuracies, and shows signs of bong dotieundeir great preaaure ns to time ; but-this, as pDiided out, is in a great measure because the ' zeal' of the reporters influenced them to try to do tckj Tuuch. Besides, it should be remembered, that some of theuoi never reported Parliamentary debate before, and that to others the forms of tlife' House J the members themselves, and the subje&s; debated, - we"rd entirely new.
