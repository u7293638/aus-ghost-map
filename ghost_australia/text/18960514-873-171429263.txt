EDITORIAL MILL. Though the mills of God grind slowly, Yet they grind exceeding small. J.C.: " Lost and Found" nicely written, but how many readers do you think would understand what it's all about :-.... FORRESTE : Illustrated yarn about the Chinese wedding which made the spectators'' trousers buttons fly off, regretfully declined ... PSYCHE : It reached W.P.B. all the same. What's its esoteric meaning ? ...., C.J.: " Bob O'Jones " takes too long to get to point. Sorry office couldn't raise that florin. E.C. (South- Yarra): Thanks. Using some BEN BEE (Sydney): Many thanks. Crisp newsy pars of general interest always welcome. ... BER- NARD E. (Sydney): Why don't you write? B. O'D.: Glad to hear from you at any time... ...DELCOMYN: Same to you GEO .R.: The FREE LANCE cannot believe that so many corpses are made as picturesquely as the yarns sent in describe. In future, no corpse yarn will be considered, unless accompanied by the corpse, not necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith... GHOUL : A serious ghost! No you don't. Any festive, humorous cuss of a ghost can be sent along. G.R.M.(S, Melb.): Thanks; election pars acceptable... R.S.: You send this : " A distinguished old one-legged colonel Was persuaded to publish a jolunel. But soon in disgust, He gave up—he was ' bust'— ' For,' said he,' the expense is infolonel.' '' Now this paper is not run by Jerumky Jernme. SHADOW: "Beom" will do now ....COMET: Your "Svengali" as drawn would not reproduce.... S.E.R.: What you propose is already done by " Miss Grundy." Anyhow, a writer who confesses to "have had no practical experience," could hardly undertake the job. W. A..: Sketches crude, may work up one. L.C. (Bourke, N.S.W.): Making enquiries. Result next issue S.M. : No, the FREE LANCE is not going to stand for South Melbourne. I.M.: When this paper said Fax is not a Jew—he is a gentleman, it meant Gentileman. The other was an unhappy misprint. ...D.M.B.: Many thanks. Next issue... NATAL : This paper is Scotch itself, and means t spell the Krugersdorp bushranger's name JAMIESON... P. (Adelaide) "Pastor" too long for interest. Cut and come again... G.P.C. (Sydney) : Don't be alarmed, T. and M. are not likely to linger in this Gold-forsaken country..
