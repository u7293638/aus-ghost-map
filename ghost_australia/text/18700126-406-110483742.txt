LONG AGO. When sieve I sit alone, Thinking of the past and gone When the clock with drowsy finger, Marks howlong the minute^ linger And the embers, dimly burning, Tell of life to dust returning, Then my lonely chair around, With a quiet, mournful sound, With a murmur soft and low. Come the ghosts of long ago. One by one I count them o'er, Voices, that are heard no more, Tjeare that Joying clirekB have wet, Works whose music lingers yet, Holy faces pale and £»ir, (Shadowy locks of waring hair, Happy sighs and whispers dear, Songsforgotten many a year, Lips of dewy fragrance, eyes Brighter bluer than the skies, Odours breathed from Paradise And the gentle shadows glide Softly murmuring at my side, Till the long, unfriendly day All forgotten fades away. Thus when I am all alone, Dreaming <fer the Past and Gone, All around me, sad and^low, pome the gbpdts of long ago.
