A LITTLE LAD. Outside tiro golden morning sun Is tingoing nil with glory; Tho birds, for spilngtlnio has begun, \- Aro trilling their sweet story. -Thcro'R ft hint of summer gifts to bo ; Tho tender grass is springing; / And thro' my wuidow wide I seo -A little lad a-swinging. What cares ho for the winds so wild That howl in wintry weather, Whito now tho breeze that fans his brow Is llko a downy foalhor ? Willi grnBsoy enrpots spread below, And birds around him singing, What cares he for tho wiutcr's snow, That happy lad u-swinging. Ho dreads no future sighs and tears Light-hearted, careless boy ! There como no ghosts of haunting fears To mar his childish joy. Outstretched bo ore his trusting gazo piad gifts the years are bringing ; \- -.v.,., For life presents its highest phase To that small lad a-swinging. He'd not exchange that low swingboard For thrones of golden splendor ; Nor for tho wealth that misers hoard, Tliojjift of sunshine tondcr. Tho dewdrops gleaming in tho grans More joy than gems aro bringing ; lie lets the world, unenvied, pass, Wise little lad a-swinging. Who knowa what future days may see Of gladness or of sorrow ? And who would pierce Iho mystery That veils the dim to morrow? When he reviows In after years The scenes to memory springing, I'crlmpH he'll sec thro' falling tears The littlo lad a-swinglng. ,
