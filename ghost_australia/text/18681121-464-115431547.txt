AMERICA. — ,ji ? T HE I.UI.8H LEGION MONUMENT. grand festival at jones' wood— poem by 11ile3 o'reilly— addsbss by eiciiaed o'goumaw. esq (From the- ' New York World,' July 30.) Yesterday this association held' a grand festival at Jones' 'Wood, for the- purpose of raising funds, to be devoted to the erection ?of a monument in the Central Park, to com memorate the heroism and patriotism of the Irish soldiers who fell in the late war for the preservation of .the nation. About 5000 per sons were present. Among the distin i gu-ished guests we observed Mayor Hoffman, who, muck to the regret of all, .was compelled to leave early, in the afternoon to ? visit his sick father air. Sing Sing, and who was thus prevented from delivering his intended ad dress, Richard O'Gorman, General Charles G. Halpine (Miles O'Reilly), General Shaler, Judge Qu'inn, Colonel John Coonan, Colonel ' Hagari, Major Dunbar, &c.; A plot of ground, costing 7,500 dols., situ ate in Calvary Cemetery, has already been purchased foi the erection of this monument, but as the city officials have expressed their willingness to grant a site in the Central Park for the pro posed column, the property in the cemetery will besold, and the proceeds added to the building fund. During the greater part of the forenoon the visitors amused themselves with dancing and wandering through the grounds. At five o'clock the long roll beat as a summons to attend the exercises of the day, and shortly n.ftfirwn.vds t.lie -larffe hall was rlmiKf-lv thronged. Several national airs haying been creditably performed by the band, the Presi dent of the association, Colonel Coonan, 69th Regiment,'N.Y.S.N.G., introduced General Halpine, who; amid great applause, recited ?the following beautiful poem ; — ..,-.,- ; ;.:.-.' ~(;;{l*i?b3j?o;ktjkbi-a.y. ? .;?

'Milks O'Reilly. At the conclusion of the poem, the gallant General was loudly called on for a speech. He responded as follows::— * - Ladies and Eellow -Citizens-— I came here tliis afternoon, utterly' unprepared to spfeak, for the reason that your friend and miiiej Mayor Hoffman, was '?to;have: presided --at this meeting and addressed' you. * Unfortunately however, in consequence of the illness of his father, he. has besen compelled, much to his regret, to leave. I, therefore, not being able to speak, and having, said all I wish in my usual form, that of verse, have the great pleasure of introducing to you one of the most gifted of ' our (race; and 'to whom I, when a boy, looked* up .as one of; the stars of our hopei I have now the honour, instead of. inflicting, upon you a very .bad speech my- self, to introduce my, dearpfriend, and the friend of the Irish people— Richard O'Gor man. (Applause)! '?.?','' ???'?''? 'ADpRlSSS OF MR. '0 GOEMAN. 1 'M.iv O'Gorman was received with enthu siastic applause, which having partiallysub sided, he said;— Ladies and gentlemen— I do not v.ery often appear in the. character of a spoil-sport ; but I am afraid I am assuming that role to-night. When, half an hour ago, I saw the flash of those small, glancing feet, moving so gracefully in the dance, I could not help thinking that the music of the ad mirable poem you have just heard read, not to :? speak, i of the mere prose which I am capable of expressing to you, will hardly compensate the be.autiful girls and the gallant boys I see around me for the loss of a good dance that this delay has cost^ them. But, 'ladies and gentlemen, I : am in the hands of your committee. They command me to speak,. and I have ito speak, and all I can-, promise you isthat I shall make what I have to: say as ..short as . possible. Ladies and gentlemen, the object which has brought you here to-day is a laudable one— one appeal ing to the dearest instincts of all our hearts. Citizens, you all remember well, the time when the fate of the United States stood ? trembling ?? in. the balance ; when civil war, long threatened, broke in thunder upon the land. :-'?. There was a great meeting called to gether in Union square, in April, 1861. On ; that morning the late gallant and lamented General Corcoran (loud cheers), then Colonel of the '69th Regiment, did me the honour to consult with me, and, by his instructions, I appeared at that meeting, and, amidst the cheers of the audience, I announced that the 69th Regiment was under arms and ready to march-, to the front. (Cheers.) I spoke then, and shall not forget the thrill- of pride Ifelt, for I knew I was speaking the voice 'of the Irish people in the.North. I then said tnat the Irish element went into the war not to aid a party, not to oppose a section, but to fulfil the ' oath which they swore when they became citizens— to defend the Consti tution of the United States. (Great cheer ing.) I then said that the war was. a great war, a civil war, that I trusted it would be ; conducted with chivalry, and in such a man ner .that the men who were fighting the battles would never forget that they were fighting those who were their brothers, and who were to be their friends- again. (Ap plause.) Citizens, I said this on behalf of my race in. America. Tell mo, ye gentlemen 'who fought the battle out — tell me, ye citi zens who looked on, did the _ Irish element keep my promise1? (Cries of of yes, ..yes, and cheers.) I say it did. You know r:\idt happened. The 69th marched to tlio front. You know its story at the battle of Bull Run. You know its commander was captured, and with what dignity and chivalry he bore' his long cap tivity. The 69th Regiment grew into the j Irish Legion, and, with the same principles, ; the Irish Legion went to the front and. fought the long battle out. It left New ; York three thousand strong. During the Avar it recruited upwards of three thousand men. During the war, history will tell how the officers and in en bore themselves in Suffolk, at Coal Harbour, at Spottsylvania Court-house — how, through the red surges of battle, the Irish Legion bore the green flag and the flag of the United States toge ther, proudly and bravely into the thickest of the foe. (Entimskstic applause.) When this Legion returned, it numbered but four hundred men, and the rest sleep in their graves away in every battle-field into which they Avere ordered to go during the war. Citizens, we still cling to some of the habits of the dear old land. We respect, even in the grave, the habitation of the lives. that were dear to us. Their graves are unhonoured and forgotten. These gentlemen and you mean to build them here in the city of New York an enduring monument that will per petuate their memory, and; do honour to their heroism. .(Loud .'.ml con 'dun ed cheers.) It' is right .that avo shuuid do it. It is right that tlie tie li-twooirlmhmen. and the. United States should -be kept closer together. Of all live ' races' that have been called into this luition to strengthen it, there is not one, I am proud -to1 say, to which, the United States is moVe indebted than to the' race frpni, wliiich ,1 .sprang. It has brought them tlie strong arm, tie great phy ^§ieaTi3tfength, which lies at tEe~Basii. ,o£ tlie fj 'vitality of every nation.. 'It has brought '?; them quick wits. It ? has brought theni/ ah \- ' intelligence that, never tires. And, citizens, ? i: even among tlie least capable of the. Irish, it f- ;'has; brought them a joy 5us humour, a.temper, ?;j!and a readiness to ^njoy life, which I trust '-??'bui^feHovv-Anierican / citizens will as quickly , '?-'\ as/ possible; aipquirbrfrpin; the Irish element ' '%mbng them. ;i 'ditizens^'iaxie. we .not poets— ^ some 'of us ; at . least 1= .. ?] Think .- of, a. . soldier,' , ?'?'%brn .arid exh aus;tled.;;py the ; war, Svho' , has ? ?

Build it, as high as the' fond aspi ? rations we. entertain for the future of this. ; land of our children and our. love. And, ? citizens, in days to come, some Irishman here, 1 of Irish blood, passing bythis.edifi.ee testify- , ?ing to Irish loyalty, 'gallantry, 'and. devotion, V will feel his heart moved by a great love to America, from the remembrance that so; ; ;much of Ireland's best blood was .shed 'in its :; defence. Aye; and 'while we love the land of ? our children, oh, my countrymen, is there ' /any of us who forgets the dear land of our ; fathers (hear, hear, /and cheers). Aye, there 'is majesty in the love which Irishmen bear ?'to' Ireland. There is a strength and vigour ' in that love,' which every power '.that .the enemy could devise has not been able to trample out or destroy.- Ireland bore the 'steady, persistent, lying calumnies of English ?literature ; she has borne famine and pestil ence, and yet she never gave up anything that she ever loved (loud applause). She has : been true to the religion she loved. Aye, ; truly, the other races— the aristocratic races of the /earth— have ridden in the coaches of history. But give me the men who, in defi ? ance of all enemies, can be true to their love and cannot forget their hate (cheers). .Yes, citizens, I told you that Ireland ; brought into the United States strung arms, but it has brought its own element, which is more valuable. Ithas: brought into the. United ?States a permanent jealousy of British, in fluence, which is a, necessity in', our/ time. Do not- mistake ' in e.// 1: would .like/to /see America oir friendly' terms' with' all' her sister nations ? but I' warn you, 'fellow- citizens, that the insidious efforts of English politicians in American politics are, to be. ?wa'tclied anddreacledfrom day to day ; that the ?Irish!, element in the United' States are thegreat detectives to watch it' and prevent it.- ;('A'pp!ause.)'
