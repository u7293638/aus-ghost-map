BRINGING DOWN AN APPA- RITION. THE Daily News correspondent writes as follows :â€”" A miracle-monger in the annexed province of Alsace has come to grief, and nearly lost his life in a singular manner. The Jesuits, furious at their expulsion from Germany, resort to all sorts of devices to persuade the igno- rant that their enemies are threatened j with the wrath of heaven. For some | days past, shortly after sunset, a phan- | torn, bearing a white flag appeared in ; the village of Chantenois, near Stras- 1 bourg, The rumour ran that tbe ; ghostly visitor was the Virgin Mary, j who had come to rouse the people to i fight for the Jesuits. So great was the ; excitement that a detachment of dragoons was dispatched from Strasbourg to occupy Chantenois. The Virgin, nevertheless, appeared at the usual time, but a matter-of-fact German sentry challenged the apparition, and receiving no answer, after three * sommations,' fired upon it. He brought down his game, and instead of a ghost it proved to be a very fat cure. The ecclesiastic, roaring lustily from a painful wound, was put into a cart and carried off to Strasbourg Hospital. Three other priests, suspected to be his accomplices, were subsequently arrested."
