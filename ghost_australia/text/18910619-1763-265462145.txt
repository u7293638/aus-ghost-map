GORDON. Thursday. (FBOM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The Kangaroo contractors had a splendid washup last Friday, obtaining 89 oz 8 dwt of gold from 74 tons of quartz for 3 week's work. This yield will give the contractors and the oompany brilliant returns.. The company is gradually improving its prospecta, as will.be seen by the following : When the contractors commenced operations for the first three weeks - tbey got lOoz; second three weeks, 20oz; third three weeks, 50oz; and the last orushing as stated. It will be seen if the mine continues to improve, or in;-; fact yield anything like the last crushing for any length of time, it will be a grand thing not; only for the contractors but for the district generally. The North Kangaroo have also come into notice during the week, and-sold up to 9d on the strength of the Kangaroo Extended Company's yield, and also on the prospects of. the mine itself. Tbe Lexton Freehold Company is being floated, and mining operations will it is expected, soon start. The Parker's United is dull at present, but may strike something good any day. A very interesting game of football was played ' ou : the Gordon cricket ground ou Saturday last, between the local team ftnd a team from the Holy Ghost College, Ballarat, whioh resulted In an easy victory for the visitors, securing 4 goals to Gordon's 1\. The Gordon boys were out of practiae, and that helps to account for their defeat. But it is doubtful whatever way they practised that they would have any show against the Holy Ghost olnb, as it is rumored they are the best club that ever played in Gordon. The Gordon junior olnb will play the Ramblers on Saturday next. Also the Gordon district club will play Ballan on Wednesday next. At the Gordon Police Court on Wednesday last there was only two debt cases to be disposed of, and then the court adjourned till next Wednesday week.
