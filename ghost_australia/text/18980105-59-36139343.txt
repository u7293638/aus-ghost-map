SELECTED POETRY. rHE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW YEAR. No pause, no rest, no visual line Between tbe years that come and go ? For some too fast, for some too slow ? Time never stops to sleep or dine, But on and on with steady flight He beeps, untired, by day, by night, And boys and ^irls, ere yet aware. Fine threads of silver in the hair. Their love of quiet growing stronger ; And haply, by these tokens know Whai kind friends told them long ago. Thai they are boys and girls no lunger. Still on, as silent as a ghost ? Seems but a score of days all told, Or but a month or two at most, Since our last New Year's song we trolled, And lu ! that New Year now is Old, ' O:d year, good-bye ! old year, good-bye ?' For what it brought, for what it takes. We love it, and for loved one's sakes ; Prize we its hours of bappinness, Not for its sacred sorrows less, Accept our thanks, Old Year ? fur thtse And for all precious memories Of love, of grief, ot toil of pain. Whose ministry was not in vain. â™¦ ?
