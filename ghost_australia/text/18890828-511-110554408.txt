Wild Margaret. ? * ? CHAPTER XXIV. : Maruaket went to fior beautiful ? suite --t rooms tliat ni^lit with a ;?' Vusitinp heart iiJti] a mind sorely troubled. Ptiuce ' Rivjnii had proposed to her. ; It had come an unexpectedly that V. -it overwhelmed her. There are a '?1 great many princes in Italy, they ;. are commoner there tiian with us, ':?'? but stili (i prince is a prince, and j' . tliis one was amongst the best and i'- highest of his order. Margaret ; had not dreamed that he would y. have condescended to bestow more ?;..'? than a passing and friendly thought t - upon the unknown English woman % who dwelt in bis house as the gover 1 ness aud companion to his sister. X '.?'? And now, quite suddenly, with ;,- preparation, he had asked her to be ;V his wife. It seemed incredible; but it was ? . only too true ; and what was she , to do? ? ? ,V It would have been bad enough = if she had heen an ordinary English woman, and her insignificance and S poverty the only drawbrks ; but her position was not so' good as that even. Tlicre wns.a blot upon fcer escutcheon winch made it im possible for her to be the wife ot any honegt man; however humble he might be, least of all the wife of so great a man as Prince Rivani. She bad so completely buried all thought -of love iu the tomb of .the. i% past, that it had never occurred to her that a man might fall in Jove .i with her, and now, as she stood be ,! fore the glass and looked dreamily \- and sadly at her face, she was bound : to admit, and that without vanity, \- that she was beautiful ; but how $ beautiful, how supremely lorely she I herself did not guess, * But now what was she to do ? Improbable and unlikely as it seemed, Prince Eivani had fallen in love with her and asked her. to be his wife, and, as it was simply im possible that she should marry him, there was only one course open for her : 6he must leave the villa and Florence, and at once. She sighed deeply as the convic tion was forced upon her. She had been, after a fashion, almost happy ; she had been at peace at any rate with these great people, who had lavished their kinduess upon her aud won her gratitude and love. And now she must go. Must leave the kind old lady who, with all her slateliness, had ever been tender to the unknown English girl ; leave Florence who loved her with all the warmth ..of her young, unscathed heart. She sighed again, and opening the window looked out at the night, or rather . morning, for midnight had prosed some hours since, and as ? she did so the faint, perfume of a cigar floated up to her, and she saw the tall figure of the prince walking . to and fro on the terrace beneath. He, too, was sleepless, and think ing of her. She closed ,the window ;.-.. quietly and was beginning to uu iv dress, when there come a knock at hr .:.the door and the Princess Florence ft entered. *? §^';^ -For, the first time' Margaret was ^ J not glad to see hor, but Florence :^^ /jaiisaBpectingly ran in and put her jjj*%vjBrpi round the white shai-ely: neck/ ^IvJiji :^ ®^' f°rg'v**ie, 'Ji'ettTi she mor fe^J^iured withtheiuipul8iveenthusiasm ^^;'of durage.. i3}pt»IiDould?not go.to, |||p.sleep until Ijtsomeiii you i. an A told' ^IpST©!! how glad I am.' ^^,||.fs'6|ad V said Margaret, flushing, ^^^md^ssing the long tresses of silky K^l&fi;£%iuat they hid her face. .

' Then it really is true that you doiit know tbnt you have caused such a sensation ?' she exclaimed. 4 Wliy, dear, it vas a furore, it was a ' Yeni, vidi, vici,' as your ancient emperor said. Do you know that directly you left the salon everybody fell to talking about you, though they had done that while you were there under pretence of talking about your picture. They all 'talked about you as if you were something that had dropped out of the skies, and we Rivanis were lucky to own the particular spot of earth upon which your divinityship descended.' Margaret lauched softly. The girl's enthsiostn amused her, and yet it was honest enough. ' You may laugh, but let me tell you, that your name will be ringing all through Italy before the week is out.' 1 1 sincerely trust hot,' said Mar garet. ' Oh, but it will,' retorted the princess; ' Signor Alferp is going to send your picture to be exhibited, and he will express, the admiration he feels' for it ail through Roue ; and Rofaie — which is the*rt centre of the world — will sptfaefft thrpll^h EuropeJ and you wilt'j)e famous. And thbn people will ask what the artist ty like, and the countess and all those whose hearts you -won to night will tell what a lovely and charming girl you are, and you will have the world at your feet.' ' You talk nonsense \ery eloquent ly, princess/ said Margaret gent ly. ' It is nonsense ? That is good. I will tell Ferdinand.' ' Ferdinand — the prince,' Baid Margaret. ' Yes,' laughed Florence. ' For ? if it is nonsense, it is bis nonsense, for I heard him say it after you left the reom ; and she said it almost gravely, as if he were sad rather than otherwise. Now, why should he be s-id ?' she went on, looking up. at Margaret's face thoughtfully. ' Isn't it rather too late for guess ing ridies, dear ?' suggetsed Mar garet. 'Late. Who could sleep after such a night ?' exclaimed the prin cress, with the sublime contempt for respose belonging to her age. 1 Why should he be sad, dear ? I kDO-v he admires you, for when the countless asked him if he thought you jbretty — Pretty ! ? What imper tinence, — he smiled and said, ? No,' and he meant that he thought you more] than pretty, — lovely 1 ' Do you think it is quite fair to construe his thoughts V Baid Mar garet. ' Oh, everything is fair in love and war ? ' she stopped suddenly and looked up at Margaret, and her face flushed eargerly. 'Oh. Do you know, a ..thought has struck me. Only think, if Ferdinand should— — ' ehestbpped, and clasped Mar Karet round her waist. 'Why, I believe 'he does already. Oh,' dear.

' A philosopher who was also a wit once declared that a thing was worse than wicked, it was absurd,' she said ; 'and that is also my answer, and now go to bed, dear, or. you will appear *at the breakfast table and frighten all . your friends for they will^tliink they see the ghost of the Princess Florence,' , v The girl saw that her nncrutioius speech had struck some discord in hfe)Me)jMriend'8 hearfe;and, ^isBijtf -hjtav jwnitently, stole from the w6nti^0^:V ?''.?
