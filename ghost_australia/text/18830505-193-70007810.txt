WHAT MIGHT HAVE-BEEN EXPECTED. * n rY s. F5lKiC 5'I'cAIfTY. O.E Wild March night, not many years ago, two young men walked rapidly through the main street of a crude Western settlement. There was little attempt at Raving, asthe place seemed to be scooped out df the solid rock which hemmed it in. The width of the street was a serious drawback to its distinction. The houses on either side, -slanting down from the hills behind them, dilapidated, de tached, and with little or no attempt at archi tecture, became more insignificant by the long distances which separated them and their grim surroundings. An icy wind, that grew more and more violent at night-fall, congealed all inclination for conversation but the younger of these pilgrims muttered through -his chattering teeth, "God-forsaken, beastly hole, Max I" " Not altogether," replied his companion. "Look yonder, Tom I" The wind, increasing in velocity, droye be fore it the murky clouds that had rested upon the jagged hill-tops, and all at once could be seen a hundred martial, maritime, and gro tesque phapes clearly defined upon the sky Myriads of stars began to glow with wonder ful brilliancy, but the younger traveller gazed longingly upon the minor. lights of the rail road depot that shone hopefully in the dis tance. The wide portico of a country store loomed in sight; cheerful arrays of patent medicines with their gaudy placards adorned the windows; the battered and broken-nosed figure of an Indian -maiden insured the pre sence of tobacco to the way-worn traveller and Tom began to soften with these signs of approaching civilization. "We'll soon shake the dust'of this wretched place from our feet, Max,"--he said.- I', had a nasty presentiment- hlagnlovere -ralt day that something would happen here;' but there's the blessed old flaming eye of the en gine at last." It all happened in a quarter of a minute, even as Tom rpoke. A waggon came rapidly down the steep cross- street, the driver vainly endeavoring, as he saw an old woman on the crossing, to arrest the speed of his vehicle; his beast was intelligent enough to aid him in this endeavor, but the grade was steep, and the old woman stumbled. Max sprang for ward just in time to lift her to her feet. As he rose to his own the shaft of the wagon gave him a rough poke upon the leg, which made himwince for a moment, but he earried his light burden to the--corner, where she struggled down out of his arms, saying, in the weak, tremulous quaver of age, "Thank ye, thank ye, young man," and hobbled away upon her stick in the gloom. The man in the waggon called out: !'All right, boss ? Nobody hurt, I reckon ?" "All right-nobodyhart," echoed Max, and the waggon went rattling on. The old woman had already disappeared; the engine was belching forth flame and steam only a few rods away. In less than five minutes Tom was filling the brackets over their heads in the car with their travelling traps, and singing softly. " I got broke at playing poker, Three of a klind." This was Tom's favorite pecan of joy. He sever got beyond the one line and the refrain, but these seemed to suffice him. Hebroke of shortly, however, upon looking at his com panion. Max was deathly pale, a white quiver about his mouth had a premonition of ghastly faintness about it. "Hallo, old fellow," cried Tom, "you were. hurt, after all ; take a swig of this,". He poured some liquor down' the throat of Max from a'little brown flask, which quickly brought him' round, but Tom. emained anxious. ., Where's the trouble, Max ?." he said. "'Only a blow on the leg," said Max. ?I shouldn.'t wonder if there was a.-black and blue spot there as big as your hand;: but. that's all. I'm tired and,hungry;.let's, eat something." They fell to upona little: supper.which Tom brought-from the recesses of his travel ling bag. 'The trait- started; on, .Max re gained his fine florid complexion. Presently he lot his head rest upon his. beard, and closed his eyes in a light andeasy slumber, Tom drew a breath of relief. The train in creased in speed. As it went spinning east .a.rdthe .very cockles of poor Tom's heart warmed' at-tse'housht ort, home He pulled up the collar of his overcoat, exten?a??hi. feet upon the luxurious upholstery of the seat ahead, folded his hat into a pillow, and was soon mingling his humble snore with the con tinuous rattle and'occasional shriek of the railway train. With the morning. came an amelioration of the cold, but it brought with it fog and mud. The nine miles' ride at the close of the second' day, over an uneven country in' a lumbering stage-coach, .wrung sometimes from Max an exclamation that was nearly akin to a groan; his leg had been a little stiffll when he got off the train. Tom thought it was the awkward position in which he had slept. He began now to be of the opinion that a touch of rheumatism mightbe at the bottom of .the trouble. " We'll give it a rub with some of Aunt Em's liniment whenwe get home," said Tom, with ,a soft inflection upon the last word. Tom ,wouldn't have believed it possible he could have been .so ridiculously glad to get back to stupid old Barnesville; he had been so grateful to get away, from it, at that titie, he had made up his mind that in the, whole. -range of the States he could not tumble upon a duller, more perversely..stagnant and. ex asperating spot than the village of which his father was so proud. It nettled him beyond endurance after he got back from college to see his father stand with' his back' to the *dining-room grate, his hands folded beneatlh his coat tails, and hold forth by. the hour upon thepetty themes discussed in the City Council, of which he was an influential mem :ber. A sword hung conspicuously over the mantel-piece, which seemed to Tom to crown 'the absurdity of the scene. The little atten tionTom had'given to the sangainary'ancients during his collegiate course increased his con tempt for' the reginient of home guards. at Barnesville, of which his father was the colo nel, and-the approach of Washington's birth day quickened Tom's decision to join his friend Max Beling in that venture out in the mining districts. "Why, you'd better stay till after the twen ty-second," said Aunt Em, who. was busy with silken flags'and rosettes at a side table. " Merry'scoming home from school onpurpose, you know." " Yes," said the colonel, "I thought it judicious to send for America-in-a-fact, I believe she is to personate; the Goddess of Liberty; she is tall forher.age, you know." Yes, Tom knew she was taller at fourteen than most girls at twenty. He wAs exceed inglyfond and proudiof his sister, but he went nevertheless. Tom left Barnesville without a single regret and vowed in his heart that many a year should go by before he should again see the white -houses and green blinds, and little front gar. dens, aneb'ueas'psnlu , ndslender saplings of elms and ash-trees and maples that at stated distances marked so many miles of his father's domain. This young lad of twenty, in the innocence and. arrogance of youth, thought of many a lively joust and tournament that awaited him yonder, which made the present placid surroundings insipid beyond degree. Five years had gone by, and he was coming back again, with a lively respect for the flesh pots of Egypt. He had spent all the money left him- by his dead mother, a considerable sum loaned him by his father, not to mention some little savings of Aunt Em's. He had spent all this money, and was coming back for more. Yet .ho had not been given to riotous living. Heaven knew the simple fare upon which he had served, the rough raiment he had worn. The money had all gone in unfortunate ven tures in the mining districts. His friend Max had risked and lost even more than Tom. Fortune was a fickle jade, and had led them a sad dance, but at last she had warmed to their favour, and now the tide ha;L tur ned..' All this new investment wanted was a littlemre capital and theirfortunesweremade. His father had a clear head' for business;-it would be an easy matter to assure him that the venture Was a safe one, and at last the future would be secured. Tom thought this all over as they jogged along in the stage coach, and as the familiar old landmarks be gan to appear he put down his coat collar, brushed'.his hat with his sleeve, pulled his pantaloons down over his boots, and began to feel that he svas Thomas Jefferson Barnes, the only son of Colonel Barnes of Barnesville. His dark, thin, eager face grew more and more jubilant as the fine fertile lands of the old homestead were passed. Acre after acre of orchard and meadow and woodland were pointed out as the property of Colonel Barnes, and presently the jaded horses began to pull up the hill to the big, square, newly painted mansion that crowned its summit. A crim son flame from the setting sun burned in each window-pane, a- brand-new flag floated from a new flagstaff, and a second portico and observatory had been added to the already fine and bedizened building. A few hourhlater the elder of our pilgrims found himself arrayed in the one extra suit that he had worn upon state occasions for an incredible period of time-a sack coat and pantaloons of blue flannel, and a high mili 1Ix smacked of tae martial.. His skin was bronzed by exposure; even his hair had been toned by the elements to a dozen different shades of reddish-brown. His shoulders were square, and his big shapely head had a trick of inclining forward upon his beard, which somewhat detracted from his extraordinary height, but gave him, the colonel thought, a Napoleonic air of deliberation and distinction. The colonel was positive that Max had seen some sort of service; the stiffnessein his leg was immediately accounted'for by the fretting of n. old wound. Tom humored this fancy, buf'begged his father not to mention it in the presenice of his friend, as he was particularly sensitive upon this point. "Modest attributes that very commonly belong to heroic natures," acquiesced the colonel. He was standing in his old attitude before the drawing-rbom grate, his feet far apert, his hands beneath the tails of his coat. Max was tormented by an idea that the colo nel closely resembled a hoary sheep that had been a pensicner upon the mining camp for many years-the poculiar triangular shape of his head, which was Fointed at the bottom, long and narrow, clean shaven and bald; the expressioe of the face, bland, tjmid, depeoa ting, yet persistent; even the blatant tonesof his voice, which went beyond Max, and reached a small, daintily creased, neat, and. dapper gentleman, who hadhbeen introduced as Mr. Fry, a prominent lawyer.in a neighboring city, and a candjda'te for the Legislature. 4ax found his feet sinking iqto a fine velvet carpet, and above' his head the ceiling was frescoed in what he supposed was the prevail ing style of the day. Chandelierse of crystal shed rivers of light upon striking pictures in gorgeous frames, upon the satin, hrocatelle, and ebony of the furniture; and even. as ?ex's eyes rested upon one of the'heavily lie laced and upholsterpd windows that lined the apartment, it -resolved itself into the-. door, through which-glided a tall slender girl,. with bare .shoulders, and magnificent black eyes that rendered the rest of her face pale by con trast. Her ears and neck, arms and fingers, Max thought, were disfigured by chains and rings, and when he took her ont\to dinner, his stiff leg became awkwardly entangled in-her long train. The weather-beaten red in his cheeks deepened, and he did not know how much he was disconcerted until Miss America begged of him not to begin tohate her for.tho accident. Max bowed with scant and stiff courtesy, and wondered how this young woman with the ridiculous name of America could be the little sister that Tom so adored. She talked too much, and as if she had known Max for years (which she had, in truth, through her 'brother's letters); she was overdrested and too handsome, and too consaious of a loveli ness that Max never could admire; she' was able to stare a fellow out of countenance, and it was very difficult to take up the thread of conventional chitchat when one had been buried in the heart of a canon for five years, which any sensible girl would know, and,not stare, and not chatter. -- • " Of the Goddess of Liberty style," Max said, scornfully, to himself. He was puzzled to keep up: with the routine of the meal, which was not only in courses, but served with too many. silver and cut- glass accom paniments for the simple convenience of Max Beling. The-variety of forks alone became a study to him. - If America could only have known the cause of his vexation and abstrac tion, it might have saved her a deal of future trgjble; she would have begun by pitying him, perhaps despising him; but Tom had led her to form an exalted conception of his friend's character, which her own extrava gant imagination had completed. When poor Max -was puzzling over the peculiar shape of one of his extra forks, America thought he was deepin some abstruse problem in metaphysics or mining machinery; in the meanwhile the furtive and disturbed glances she bestowed upon him were interpreted into pity and ridicule by Max, and -so these two really, sympathetic and congenial natures misjudged each other. Nevertheless, each dreamed of the other all' nightanaturalsequence to their discomfort in each other's society. To Max it took the shape of nightmare. He dreamed that he was stretched upon the rack for refusing to disclose a state secret, and that the beautiful America, attired in a dicolleti costume of alternate stripes of red, white, and blue bunting, presided at the instrumentof torture. He awoke to find that his leg was becoming the theatre of some posi tive suffering. It was sore to the touch just below the knee, and the red spot which had formed there was increasing in size. In spite of every effort to the contrary he was compelled to relinquish his desire to walk over the estate after breakfast, and to accept the ignominious alternative of a drive in America's pony-phae ton. - He felt bigger than the pony and heavier than the phaeton, and what witn a vague un easiness about his leg, and the presence of the lady executioner in his dream, he was in no humour to enjoy the drive. He was' relieved, however, to find that America did not begin to chatter, and that she wore a quiet sensible sort of suit buttoned up to the throat, with hat of some neutral color to match. Her hair was brushed back and caught in a simple knot in her neck, so that, as she drove, Max could readily admire the exquisite proportions of her head. The morning was fine and breezy; the pony, seemingly undisturbed by his extra load trotted cheeringly along, shaking his shaggy mane, and making a merry rattle with his hoofs on the excellently conditioned road. The village was left speedily behind and they soon entered a woodland path where in the nude branches of the trees premature and amatory songsters were already prospecting for nests) The moss about the old gnarled roots looked fresh and green andin a sheltered nookMax pointed out to America the first vio lets of the season. She threw him the reins, and, as she came back to lMax and gave the frail blossoms to his keeping, he began to thaw with the rest of nature, and to talk in a way that was new to America, but delightful. At first she thought hewas trying to suit himself to subjects that she could understand, his dis course was so simple and natural; but she soon gave up conjecturing, and yielding her self to the enjoyment of the hour, became as natural and as simple as himself. In this way they grew to understand each other before many miles had been trotted over,- and Max now fully at his ease and with a strange sense of happiness hitherto unknown to him, even went so far as to tell her of his dream of the night before. "I assure you, Miss Barnes," he said, " you really did give an extra screw to the torture with your own hands. I can feel it in this miserable joint of mine yet." She looked upon Max with an expression of such sweet compassion that he hastened- to. add; " I'm glad of the extra wrench that disabled me, for otherwise I should have been trudging over bald and boggy fields with -your father and Tom, instead of exploring this exquisite bit of woodland with you." " "It is strange, but I also dreamed of you," said America, gravely. " Oh, did you, indeed ? Well, be as frank as I was, and tell me of your dream." " It was too ridiculous," said'America ; and Max saw the color creep into her clear pale cheek. To his confusion, be felt his own be ginning to tingle. " Could it have been more ridiculous than mine ?" he said gently. "In another way," she replied. "I dreamed that yourescued me fromsomethinghorrible." Here she blushed deeper, and paused. "A dragon ?" said Max, with ill-concealed curiosity. And she replied that it was not a dragon; andbat J24,g1I,`s oia uPrss otiy~, . ~ri iappear up the broad staircase. Tom wras coming down. Max saw that he was pale and disturbed. * I must have a ta'k with you," said Tom : "let's take a turn about the grounds." Then, noticing that Max limped painfully, ",The devil " he e aimed ; "that's an other confounded ance that must be seen to at once." '? - t 'k Mai's arm, and helped him up Cth e guest- chamber he had sleptin before. Tom shut and barrd the door, and coming close to his friend, who had thrown himself with an air of exhaustion into an arm-.chair, he said, in a toneof suppressed wrath and disappointment " There's no hope here, Max-nothing but a hodge-podge of ruin and desolation. My father is next door to a begger." \- Max boreathis news with resignation. He had been thinking while limping up the stairs that all that spoiled America was the natural meretricious consequence of being rich. "I spoke to my father," continued Tom, "right after breakfast, decermining to have the thing settled at onee, and he confessed to me that it is merely hanging on by a thread so far as he is concerned-that everything is mortgaged to the huh, and the depreciation in realestate has made most af the mortgages fairlycoverthe property. Itis only the pecnliar and lucky relatson that tha little sharper of t Fry holds to the family that saves everything from going to the hammer. Fry holds all the nmortgages, and is lenient about the interest, as ell he may be. He's got some money himself, and has the handling of a (uantity more through a rich old grandmother out West. When he marries Merry, this whole property will come into his hands." "When he what?" sqi4 Max, suddenly leaping ogt of qpsol pf letl?argy that he~q crept over his. .. "Whesi hbe marries America, my sister," said. Tom. '"Fortunately for my father he has a daughter beautiful and wise enough to keep the wolf at bay .It's a lucky thing for Merry she's not the kind of girl to hobnob with poverty.

IBhatedher .by gas-light in her, low dress,-with all those gewgaws about her. " . Tom saw that his sister's face was red and pale by turns. " "Perhaps you'd better go out of the room, Merry," he said. " God only knows what fancies beset his brain." Merry thought she know; she fancied she could tell of a certain Venetian vase that held the - very violets Max raved about. The violets in the Venetian vase were dead; others had taken their-plaee; March ripened into April, and April was fast verging to May, and still poor Max was a prisoner in that fine luxurious upper chamber in the colonel's house at Barnesville. His leg had all this time been under treatment, and the. doctor thought it possible by a series of probings and applications to effect a temporary cure. " The core of the disease will probably remain for a longer period," said the physician," but the physique of the patient will bringhim round when he can get air and exercise." " Max's fine physique, however, began to be rather against him than in his favor. The doctor leaned to the opinion that' he would prefer a more sanguine temperament. In the meanwhile the most of. Miss America's time was spent'in the vicinity of the sick-chamber. A wonderful aptitude as a nurse had developed itself in this versatile young woman, and she had even shown a rare ability in concocting broths and dainties to tempt a jaded appetite. As usual, she devoted herself to this new hobby with enthusiasm. " She gives her whole heart to everything she undertakes," said the colonel,. apolo getically, to a visitor who had'called several times and found. it impossible to see the daughter of the house; "but this mania will spend itself like all the rest, and then she won't want to hear of a sick person for a twelvemonth." The colonel's auditor smiled complacently, and began to talk of other things. Although there was something amounting to a betrothal between himself and the lady in question, his mind also was preoccupied and absorbed. An unlooked-for complication had arisen in his own affairs. His grandmother had altered her will, and left more than two-thirds of her proparty in a way that might occasion Mr. Fry considerable trouble. He was compelled to go out and see the old lady, and had called to bid Merry a brief farewell. Under these circumstances.the young woman consented to come down. She left the hot hand of Max and his eager, devouring eyes, for 'the cool, clammy palm and the foxy gaze of her pro mised husband. Merry found, as they stood together, that she really was a half head taller than Mr. Fr', as Max had once laugh ingly told her. She looked down upon the dapper little man with grave courtesy, and left her hand in his own, but he saw that her manner was constrained and her attention wandering. S"I won't keep you from your studies, America," he said; "I'm in somewhat of a hurry myself ; I must catch the noon train." Then he went on to tell her that his interests" with his grandmother were seriously threat ened, and his presence was necessary out there for a ahort period; that he would write, and he hoped she would find time to reply. America promisedsho would write, and began for the first time since their engagement to find it absolutely repugnant to her to have his thin lips touch her own. He was ordinarily a dbld, unimpassioned wooer, and was not a whit warmer now than usual; but custom required that he should kiss her good-bye. America yielded to the brief caress, but it was only when he was well out on the portico, with his hat on, and barely time to catch the train, that her manner warmed to.the occa sion or the impatient crimson abated in her cheeks. On her way back to Max's chamber she 'stopped in her own, and laved her face, her lips, and washed well her hands. She met the doctor in the corridor, and behind him was evidently another' professional gentleman. .They both walked gravely. and silently down- the stairs to the lower hall, where the colonel was pacing to and fro, his hands beneath his coat tails. "Ahem I " coughed the colonel, sympathet ically. " What is the ultimatum ?" "Just as I said," replied the family physi cin : an amputation is necessary to save the patient's life; but he objects-strenunously and violently refuses." Merry ran up the'stairs without waiting to hear more, and found her brother Tom sitting hv. tiphrei drEoairisi;rtO'5n al'idMax, with a warning inflection in hisavoice, and lolding out his hand to the young girl with hi, .... cheery smile. "You needn't try to conceal anything from t me," she said. "I know all about it; I am studying medicine and surgery, and mean to be a physician. Now that the worst has come, we can meet it bravely. You'll get well and strong, and be yourself again, Max; and, after all, an old soldier surely don't mind the loss of a leg." Then Tom, seeing a look of distress in Max's face, told Merry for the first time of the 1 rescue of the old woman. "If she had been young, or even pretty," groaned Tom; "but she was a veritable witch-there was something uncanny in her whole appearance, and no doubt she held an infectious cursoe about her. Her old bones might,.better have been ground to powder than to have brought all this about, for she i hadn't long to live in any case; but Max was I always reckless." ' "You'd have done the same thing," said MIax, "if I had not anticipated yost." ' "Iwish 5 had," cried Tor--"Il wish to heaven it was I that had to choose between my leg and my life; the leg would go mighty quick r' "Your leg is of less consequence to you, per. haps, and your life more," said Max. "The one would be useless to me without the other, and both are of little account. You know, Tom, that I haven't a relative or friend oat. side of youriself." ' Here Toin saw that his sister had reached t the door, and was beckoning him out of the room5 ' I "'onou.ust get upon ahorse," she said, when the door was cloued upon the sick.chamber, ·t " and go downto the city, and bring those doc tors back with you before night. The opeisa- J tion most be erforsued atonce; and tell them k b 3 to get more doctors if necessary-to'spare no' expense. 'I've-I've got money of mamma's Syou know, Tom," she stammered, gently g " that dear mamma left me for my own." Tom nodded.. That money of their dead mother'swas bound togo in some way.. csii ' "But Maxhas not consented," said Tom. "It dosen't matter," said Merry; "It must be done. He'll know nothing about it till all 1 is over. Do you go after the doctors, and I'll 1 see to the rest." E It seemed to Toni that the remaining hours of that day went bylike a queer, awful dream. . Herememberedbringing the doctors stealthily iin, and becoming conscious of a faint odor -sickening, sweet; overpowering-that filled the.room immediately afterward, of holding his sister tight' in his arms in the adjoining chamber while something terrible was going on inside there, and during an agonizing ten sion of his nerves, liter on" hearing a terrible cry burst from the lips of poor Max. ' ".Gracious .God I" he groaned, "whose I work was'thik?" ' : " Mine 1" said Merry. "Did you thirik I would let you die ?.' It would have taken a stronger man than I Max to have turned'away from that beautiful, earnest, pallid face now caressingly close 5to his own. Tom looked on in speechless and rant dismay, remembering his father's perilous plight. Max remained dazed and bewildered, but after that first outcry made no complaint. The operationwas eminently successful. The doctors rubbed their hands over' it, and enlooe gized the system, the patient, each other, everythingand everybody concerned. A speedy convalescence and radical riddance of the whole disorder was prophesied. But days went by-weeks-a montn and more and still Max lay underthe silken canopy, his face as waxen and weak.veined as that of a sick'ink fanthis eyes unnaturally bright and hollow, his hands feverish, and his'whole aspect fit to strike terror to the hearts that remained steadfastly but desphiringly fond. . "Life is sweet, Tom," Max said one day. "I never thought it could hold so much happi ness; but you see, I can't, I must not live-it would be too cowardly; there's no other way out 'of it but to die. Would you see your in comparable sister tied for life to a pauper and a cripple-the wife of a one-legged flag-man at a railway crossing, or accompanyinghis efforts with a hurdy-gurdy upon a tambourine ? Then remember the desperate condition of your father. My good Tom, it is 'a hopeless case." It was along speech for poor 'Max. Great beads started out on his forehead, and his voice had sunk to a whisper before he was half tllrough with it. But it told the whole story. " We might take Merry's money into con sideration," said Tom; then paused, remember ing the insufficient quantity there was to take. Tom plunged his hands deeper into his liair, and wished there was a bank somewhere -ad jacent and he.was an A 1 tip-top burglar wiih an elastic conscience. He felt positive that only a few' thousand dollars would develop the mine to such an extent that another leg would be a superfluity to Maix. One magnificent morning in June, Nature was at her happiest, at her best.' The long windows of Max's chamber were opened to the full; the branches of the 'sycamores tem pered the rays of .the,sun and subdued the frolic of the breeze. A celestial silence reigned in the garden below, where the tulips blazed, the pinks,exhaled spicy odors, stiff parterres of blossoms were made wanton by bees and butterflies, and pale phantoms of statueswere robed and relieved by a prodigality of reflected color and shade ; the birds sang, the bees hum med, all in an under-tone of dreamy delight. But the pale lips of Max broke into an old rhyme that somewhat marred.the voluptuous ease of the moment: Oh, to think my name is crossed From duty's mester-roll- That I may slumber through the clarion call, . . And live the joy of an embodied soul, Free as a liberated ghost I Oh, to feel a life of deed Was emptied out to'fee ' That firo of pain that burned so brief a while That fire from which I come as the dead come s Forth from the irreparable tomb !" .Two human beings in the next room looked'" at each other in speechless dismay. Tom shook his head, and let it fall, with a gesture of despair, upon his hand again; and Merry, to control her nerves picked up a paper that had lain upon the table since the previous day. A sealed letter, addressed by thesame hand; had remained there even longer. - They were both from the Western town where Mr.' Fry was still sojourning. His grandmother had died in the interim, whinh palliative calam ity threatened further complications and a ion geor delay. 'Merry opened the paper and read - it with her eyes alone; the nerve that connect ed the organ of vision with her brain was dor mant and'paralyzed. ' The advertisements, being in largery print, she read first. Presently her eyes fell upon the following; "If the tall, brown-whiskered gentleman who, on the evening -of the 18th of March, nearthe depot at -- rescued an old lady' from being run over, and immediately after ward, with his companion, took,the train east, ward, will communicate with H. K. Fry, so licitor, he will hear. of something greatly to his advantage." ,. _Merry read 'this 'overseveral times, some times repeating the words half aloud to get their meaning, her eyes gradually gaining in telligence and expression. Then she turned to the neglected letter and broke the seal. Her hands trembled, and her lips parted eager ly. She drifted over the letter till she reached the following passage : "And this, dear Ameri. ca, is the story the absurd old lady told: that while crossing the street she stumbled, and a' waggon rattling down the hill would have in S'J" ' .... l.her had it not been far this tall deliverer, who seized her in his arms and carried her to the corner; that he was himself this mythical knight," added Mr. Fry, "my . grandmother has left one-half her money sld her share in the rhine. The money alone wi? amountto sixty thousand'dollars. But I doubt if he can be found very soon, and in the mean while I am the executor and administrator of the estate." Mcrry's eyes lid dilated to a'n enormous extent; a crimsoon flame burned in her cheek. The letter and newspaper she clutched in her hand, and striding over to Tom, touched him upon the shoulder. Tom looked up and was startled to find this magnificent face glaring down upon him. Merry thrust the paper into his hand, and pointed to the solicitor's advertisement. Tom read, and the paper be gan to rattle in his fingers. Then Merry pushed the open letter upon the paper, and pointed to the interesting paragraph. Tom read, and his face grew pale as ashes. He shortly a'reose to 'his feet, to the ends of his toes, and lifting the letter above his head, went pirouetting around the room, singaing in an effective undertone this touching refrain. "I got broke at pliytiUg poker, Thr of a khid i" This powerful tonic had to be administered to Max in small doses; but we must refer the reader for the sequel to this story to an issue of the Barnesville Chronicle some months later on.
