ItICll ES TAKEI WINGS. TT is not only individuals who have suddenly increased prosperity, and have suddenly gone down into nothingness; there are cities of which the samhie can be said. Such a one is Pithole City;'Pa.. Within one month of the first house this city had a telegraph office, and an hotel costing the owners Â£80,000 In one month there was a daily paper established, and in the next a theatre; and in another month another theatre, and then an academy of music. In six months there were seventy four hotels and boarding houses; in the seventh month the city had reached its highest prosperity. It then had about 15,000 inhabitants, elaborate waterworks, a city hall, and an extensive government. Then occurred the completion of .a labor-saving enterprise-the so called Miller Farm Pipe Line-by which the petroleum was sent off independent of the laboring population. At Once 4000 persons were thrown out of employment, while tu o thousand horses became useless; this was the death blow to Pitholo city. At once the hotels, theatres, and the telegraph office were closed and the daily paper gave up its ghost, whilst almost every one packed up his trunk and moved out. Only nine families remnineled out of a population of 16,000 souls, while the railroad from s'nole and Oleopolis runs only oae.,.?a~a day, con sisting of a locomo i?' te - single car, which isi usual ~ ?othrwi the Company is obliged to turualnuing, otherwise the charter for the ei would be lost. They still hope against hope for that unfortunate city, which, in only seven months, was born, got sick, and died. Undoubtedly this is a ease unparrelleled in history, modern or ancient; neither Eaypt nor Greece can give example of such rapid changes. "-Betoen Times.
