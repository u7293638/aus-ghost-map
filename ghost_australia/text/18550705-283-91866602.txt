A TEMl'Em'ANcE SPrEECs.-We know not where or when we have met with anything in prose more striking than the burst of eloquence which we are about to copy. One Paul Den. ton, of Texas, a Miethodist preacher, it ap. pears had advertised a barbacue, with better liquors than are generally furnished. When the people wert assembled, a desperado in the crowd cried out, "Mr. Paul Denton your reverence has lied. You promised us not only a good barbacue, but better liquor.-. Where's the liquor ?" " THusRE !" answered the missionary, in tones of thunder and pointing his finger at the matchless double spring gushing up in too strong columns, with a sound like a shout of joy from the bosom of the earth. "There," he repeated, "there is the liquor which God, the Eternal brews for all his children. Not in the sim. mering still over smoky fires, choked with poisonous gases, surrounded with the stench of sickening odours and corruptions,. doth your Father in Heaven prepare the precious essence of life-the pure cold water; but in the green glade and grassy dell where the red deer wanders, and the child loves to play, there God brews . it; and down, low down in the deepest valleys, where the fountain murmurs and . the "ivrious rills sing, and high upon the mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun, where the storm cloud broods and the thunder storms crash, and away far out on the wild, wide sea, where the hurricane howls music and the big wave rolls the chorus, sweeping the march of God-there he brews it, that beverage of life, health giving water. And everywhere it is a thing of life and beauty-gleaming in the dew-drop; singing in the summer rain; shining m the ice gem, till the trees all: seem. to turn to living jewels, spreading a golden veil over the settin sun, or a white gauze around the midnight moon; sporting in the cataract; dancinginthe hail shower; sleeping in the glacier;. foldingits bright snow, curtains. softly about the wintry world, and weaving the many colored sky, that seraph's' zone of the syren, whose warp is the raindrops' ,of earth, whose woof is the sun- beam of heaven, all checked over with celestial flowers, by the mystic hand of refraction. Still always it is beautiful-that blessed life-water !' No poison bubbles on its brink; its .foam brings not madness and murder; no blood stains its liquid glass ; pale widows and starying orphans weep not burning tsars in its depths; no. drunkard's shrinking ghost, from the grave, curses it in worlds, of eternal despair Speak out my friends, would you exchange i for the demon's drink, alcohol ?" A shout like the roar of a tempest,. answered, "1NO !',
