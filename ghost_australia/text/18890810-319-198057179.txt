i original poetry. 1 FAITH AND DTSPAIH. m Is a forest dark and drear 5 Ivflero tho msht wind, disconsolate, I Mlitth among tho oak , loaves som B in eerie prophecy of fate. B The deed boughs groan and croak with pain 9 When their dry bones aside aro swayed 9 Their sore leaves sing tho old refrain fl Of Hf a was to and youth decayed. i There range tho ghosts of wasted (lays, I ' 'MM croak of ravens, wail of winds , B still on thoy wend their tortured ways, 3 Nor case tho torment of their minds. 3 Hare Is ft garden, calm and bright, B Where all the winds of heaven meet 3 Id zephyrs soft as morning light, 3 And brooks in merry laughter greet. 3 Clear are the waters of tho streams, 3 And cool the shades of leafy bowers, 3 The birds sing out their waking dreams, 3 The air Is weot with scent of flowers. 3 There rest tbo souls of rich and poor, 3 'l'he King, tho Peasant, and the Pope ; 3 Wi lo open always stands tho door, Tho only nanorts â€” Faith and Hope.
