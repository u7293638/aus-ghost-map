'You are growing old,' they tell us Every year; ' You are more alone,' they tell us c Every year ; ' You can win no new affection, You have only recollection, Deeper sorrow and dejection, . Every year.' ' There come new careB an i sorrows Every year ; Darker days and darker sorrows Every year. The ghost of dead loves haunt us, The ghosts of changed friends taunt ub, And disappointments daunt us Every year. Too true ! Life's shores are shifting Every year ; And we are seaward drifting Every year; Old places, changing, fret us, The living more forget us, There are fewer to regret us Every year. But the truer life draws nigher Every year ; And its Morning Star climbs higher Every year. Earth's hold on us grows slighter, And the heavy burthen lighter, And the Dawn Immortal brighter, Every year. — N,Y. Christian Advocate.
