THE HISTORY OF THE EASTERN QUESTION. BY CAUCASIAN. Comparatively fewpersonspossesseitherthe leisure or the inclination to enter upon the laborious task of disentangling the knotted and revelled skein of what is popularly known in the Eastern question, The mi aerials (or so doing are not always accessible. They have to be sought for in the works of travellers and historians, in Parliamentary blue books, in the reports of consular agents, and occasionally is much more recondite document?. For example, if he wish to understand the designs of Russia in the Black Sea, we must go back to the reign of Peter the Great, ascertain what was the foreign policy which be chalked out for his successors to pursue, and then watch the persistent execution of that policy by Baccessive Czar and Czarina, and the spread of the Muscovite dominion, like a blotch of oil, over the map of Europe and Asia. Again, it is impossible to comprehend the origin and growth of the corruption and misrule of the governing classes in Turkey, without referring to the inheritance, by the House of Ottoman, of some portion of the moral degradation of the Byzantine and Greeks, whom it displaced. For, although the founder of the Turkish Empire combined in his own person the most splendid qualities of both Washington and Wellington, while the administration of his Son O khan was a model of wisdom and justice, and his code of laws was so admirable as to entitle him to be regarded, says Mr. Finlay, as the greatest legislator of modern times," yet it cannot be denied that the noble race which conquered the degene- rate inhabitants of Byzantium, eventually succumbed to some, at least, of the vices of their predecessors ; just as the hardy Gotha, who overran Italy, afterwards yielded to the allurements of! its gardens, palaces, and wines, were enervated by its climate, and perished by the hands of mercenaries. But there was no sound element in the Gothic masters of Italy. Their position was analogous to that of the slave owners in the Southern States of America before the civil war. Between the lord of the soil and the slave there was only that social stratum expressively designated white trash " In Turkey, on the other hand, all the best qualities of the race are to be found in a gradation of classes, from the landowner to the peasant. And in order to know the Turk as he truly is, we must inquire what is his religion, because with him Islam is not so much a doctrine as a life. His belief is a principle of action, which shapes and vitalises his daily conduct, reconciling him to the inequalities of fortune, and imbuing his mind with a philosophy closely akin to that of the old storer. By no modern writer has Mohammed again been investigated in each a fair and impartial spirit as by Mr. R Bosworth Smith, assistant master in Harrow School, and late fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In the lectures which he delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain three years ago and which have been collected and published, he has approached the question of Islam, not as so many other writers have done to vilify and misrepresent it, but, as he says, " pro- foundly impressed with the dignity and importance of the subject and resolved to use a relative and an historical judgment in all things " He has swept away a mass of errors, prejudices, misrepresentations, and delusions, and presented to us Mobarn mechanism as it really is nothing ex tensive nor aught set down in malice.' What is the Moslem creed' God is great and there is nothing else great. What is the Moslem life ' ' Islam,' that is, man must resign his mu in God's and and his highest happiness in so doing What is the practical effect of this Mr. Smith answers the question thus - There is in the lives of average Mohammedans, from whatever causes, less of self- indulgence, less of the mad race for wealth, less of servility than is to be found in the lives of average Christians Truly we may think that these things ought not to be, and if Christians generally were as ready to confess Christ, and to be proud of being his servants as Mohammedans are of being followers of Mohammed, one chief obstacle to the spread of Christianity would be removed " To promote the study of science for the purpose of communicating its results to others, Mohammed regarded as an imperative duty, and he inculcated tolera- tion with the utmost strenuousness. '513, pute not," he said to his followers, against those who have received the Scriptures that is, Jews and Christians except with gentle, ness, but say unto them, We believe in the revelation which hath been sent down to us and also in that which hath been sent down to you, and our God and your God is one."' What sort of a national character was moulded by Islam ' And what is the true nature of the typical Turk ' Mr. Bosworth Smith's answer to these interrogations is as follows " The genuine Othmanh has many noble, social, and national characteristics He is, or was till the example and the pro deplore the Western money makers in 11 nene *d him, eminently a man of his word. His word was his bond, and a bond which was a first rate security, He is still sober, temperate, dignified, and courageous Terribly cold as he is when his passions are aroused, he is at other times gentle, hospitable, and humane. Nowhere in Christendom, with the one exception perhaps of Norway, are beasts of burden treated with such unvarying kindness and consideration as they are in Turkey, no J no- where probably, in spite of all the depressing influences of polygamy and the degradation of women generally, does the mother retain more hold on her children, or do children regard their mothers with each constant and indissoluble veneration. It was not a Mussulman, bat a Christian missionary, and he a zealous and successful one, who in rebuking Roma younger missionaries at Stamboul who were speaking contemptuously of the Turk, remarked, ' You will see practised here the virtues we tam 66 to Christendom."' This people, occupying some of the fairest portions of three continent?, and having for their capital a city built upon one of the loveliest and most commanding sites in the world, have been for nearly two centuries objects of envy and detestation to the mines of Russia. There was a time when the Czar paid an annual tribute or 40,000 ducats to the Khan of the Crimea, who was himself a vassal of the Sultan ; but this ceased in 1720, and passing over the numerous wars waged against Turkey by Russia and the progressive encroachments of the latter power upon the territory of the former, we will merely notice the commencement of the claim, of Russia to the protectorate of the Christian subjects of the Sultan. By the seventh article of the Treaty of Kutchuk. Kainwdji, concluded in July, 1771, Turkey bound herself to protect the Christian religion, and gave to Russian ambassadors authority to make " representations" on the subject to the Sublime Porte, From that day to this the authority thus given has been made the pretext for incessant interferences with the internal affairs of Turkey by Russia and always with the avowed object of redressing Christian grievances, and with the uniform result of stealing Turkish territory. To sup. nose a parallel state of things we must imagine the King of France as having Stimulated by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, for the right of making representations to the English Government as to its mode of trait log its Roman Catholic subjects in Ireland, and then, by means of the Irish priesthood, who were chiefly educated at St. Omer, fomenting rebellions in that country and the Government as putting them down with the same ruthless hand as that with which it repressed the rising of 'OS. Thereupon France would begin to bully England, and finding that ineffectual, would make war upon her, and compel her to recognise the semi independence of Ireland, each province of which would become a principality, paying an annual tribute to England Than, watching a favourable opportunity, France would induce Scotland to follow suit, so that her position would resemble that of Egypt in relation to Turkey Then she would obtain possession of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Wight, and the county of Corn nail, and then she would direct all her efforts to excite disaffection among the English Catholics, and would represent to the other powers of Europe that England was a sick man, while M. Thiers would march up and down Trance inflaming people's minds by recounting the atrocities of Wexford and Drogheda and by indignantly demanding that these masterful descendants of the old Scandinavian pirates and vikings should be driven out of Britain, ' bag and baggage " In one point, however, the parallel breaks down. The fault of the Turkish Government towards its Christian subjects has been an excess of toleration-a superb indifference to their tenets and their ecclesiastical' government They have enjoyed for genera" tions past complete autonomy. One of the leading Bulgarians, willing to the Pall Mall Gazette on the 19th of February, 1868, says " The condition imposed upon Christiana by the Ottoman conquest was this their religious chiefs thereby became charged, not only with the spiritual administration of their respective flocks, but also with a large share of their temporal affairs as well, such as public education, moral censorship civil suite, contracts wills, and the like Turkey, in fact, in By thus be called, up to a certain point, a federal son of theocracies under the sceptre of the Sultan " Now, this system worked admirably, so long as the choice of their patriarch and of their councils lay with the body of the people The clergy were identified, by sympathy and interests, with their flocks They were popular, and they deserved to be. They were at once the spiritual instructors, the magistrates, the teachers, the legal advisers, and the friendly counsellors of the laity. But such a state of things was altogether oDnox tons to the Czar as the Pope of the Eastern Church. Be, therefore, employed his india ence with the extra Hellenic or Romans Greeks, who act in Turkey as chief deposit terms of orthodoxy and Bjnntiniam, to de- nationalise the church in Bulgaria, just as the Ultramontane?, in the time of Bossnet, endeavoured to subvert the liberties of the Gallican Church. The Porte was easily persuaded that the Bulgarians, being Greek by religion, should therefore be under the direct authority of the Greek patriarch of Constantinople e, and thus the Greeks, by obtaining the ecclesiastical which included so much of the civilians diction of Bulgaria, made a virtual conquest of that country What follows may be best told in the words of M Ivanoff, the Bulgarian previously referred to. He says - Russia let matters alone for a very good reason. Russia just lent Bulgaria to the Greeks until the fall of the empire might enable her to reckon in turn with her associates She expected that it would be the Turkish Government whom the Bar panama would hold responsible for Greek op pressions She let the Greeks sow the seed of misery in the hope that some day the Turks might reap the harvest of revolt '' That was written nine years ago, it must be remembered and M Ivanovitz thus sets forth the grievances of his compatriots \- ' We do not desire anything beyond that amount of temporal autonomy which is necessarily involved in such religious autonomy on the Porte accords to each community. Deliverance from the Greeks direct communication with the central Government, the right of electing our national clergy by our own people the use of our own language in the church services and its cultivation in schools constitute the whole amount of the Bulgarian demand. As for the rest, we are content to rely on the interest which the Porte itself finds in the gradual introduction of reforms. Fidelity to the Government seems to us only the net return for its preservation and guardianship of our nationality, for the B ilganana fully comprehend that the wreck of the empire would simply throw them headlong into the gulf of Rassism." This fully confirms the statements made by the late Lord Strangford, in a remarkably able series of articles and letters published in the Pall Mall Gazette in 1867 and 1868, of which Mr. Grant Ball recently observed, that their careful perusal was indispensable to any one wishing to master the Eastern question. As far back as 1863 Lord Strangford bad strenuously insisted upon the fact that it was antipathy to the Greek spiritual administration which had called the Bulgarians sense of nationality into existence, and which is as the very breath of his life, 1 He insists on having bishops and clergy of his own race and speech , he will not tolerate an alien priesthood, who are too often both the originators and the instruments of oppression and tyranny, he seeks to obtain the established nee of his language as an instrument of prayer and education, and rather than be deprived of this, he will go over to the Church of Borne." Again, in 1887, the same writer, after praising the Bulgarians as "the most numerous and the most worthy Christian race in Tur- key," declares, from personal knowledge of the country and the people, that "their immediate want, in so far as they have any, is not to turn the Turks, but the Greeks out of their country." And, again, at the end of life, we find Lord Strangford writing, ' Ever since the Turkish conquest the Romaic Greeks- that is to say, the Brzjn. lines-dispossessed of empire, have been exercising a shadowy sort of Imperium in imagine within the Turkish empire over all other Christian races of the same faith. ' And in a letter addressed to the Globe newspaper about the same time, the "special com- missioner" of the "National BjzantlneCom- mission," speaking on behalf of 5 OOO.OOOof industrious and peaceful Christians in Turkey declared that all they wanted from the Sultan was an emancipation from the state of quasi serfdom in which they were kept by the Greeks. "This, air," concluded the writer of the letter, is the object desired by the Sultan a subjects of all religious creeds, for religious tolerance obtains in Turkey to an extent that might well serve as a model to more pretentious Governments, and the Christian, so far from being oppressed, as the cry goes, is far more favoured than the real Turk of the Moslem faith." 7ft bat is the secret of the Bulgarians I antipathy to the Greek priests ' In the first place they are foreigners, in the second, they are under the control of foreign bishops, who purchase their sees of a foreign patriarch, and in the third, they are more often than other wise a mass of ignorance and depravity. Englishmen who have not travelled in Russia or in European Turkey can scarcely credit the moral and intellectual debasement of the village pope. Let us present a few portraits of him, signed by authors of credit Mr Charles Macfarlane thus describes Papas Lollo, who afterwards became a famous brigand and cut-throat. He was born and brought up in a Greek village between Heracles and Adrianople. In time, he became the leading priest of the district. For many years his life did not differ from that of the generality of the Greek clergy. He rigidly kept the in- terminable constantly recurring feasts of his church he got devoutly drunk at the feasts of the Virgin and all other high festivals. He abused the Roman Church and the Armenian and he extracted piastres or pans from the ignorant and superstitious peasantry, wher- ever and whenever he could He was great against ghosts and evil spirits, and infernal vampires. No demon could withstand his exorcisms He was every inch a village papas, and was respected conform- ably " Mr Wallace, who derives his information from a semi official report, states that the Greek clergy in Russia are obj acts of derision and reproach among even the poorest peasantry. Numbers of them are drunkards, thieves, extortioners, turbulent brawlers, cheats and gamblers Sir Rowland Blennen hassett, in a recent number of the Fortnightly jVet here described the lives of the Greek clergy in Bulgaria OF scandalous in the extreme. He says "They permit polygamy fo the rich lady , they furnish the harem with Christian (girls, and they are known to be guilty of still darker crimes ' Mr Barkley, C E , who spent five years in B algona, quotes the following conversation which he had with an old Moldave one Sunday morning at Inji Keni " You have no resident priest, perhaps ' "Oh, yes, Effendi, we have an excellent worthy creature I such a good man, Effendi, that every one from far and near comes to buy wax candles and charms from him, and each week be makes a lot of money which enables him to get so drunk on Saturday night that he is like a dead man all Sunday He is now lying among the nettles at the back of the drinking shop there, and will not be able to move till night " " Does he often do this I asked. "Well, Effendi, I can't exactly say how often, but this is the fifth Sunday he has spent among the nettles I Can it be wondered at that the Bulgarians should detest their foreign pastors, and should there be any difficulty in accepting the statement made by Colonel James Baker that "a great part of the persecution to which the Bulgarians have been subjected has emanated, not from the Mohammedan rulers, but from the Greek Christians' ' But is there one Englishman in 10 000 who has ever heard of the real cause of disaffection in the Danubian principalities' That disaffection however, has been studiously fomented by Russian agents at Bucharest where a secret committee has been sitting for the last 10 years entrusted with the special mission of stirring up insurrections on the other side of the Danube, aided and abetted by the Prince of Servia, the stipend diary of the Czar. Writing in June 1867, the late Lord Strangford said -' That Servia has, for some time past, been striving with all her might and main to lay the train for a genuine insurrection in Bulgaria, one to be fri m RA prisoner like a fusee without timed in an explosion in- a close, view the Bligbteatreanlt whatever-that the Greeks of the kingdom have been using their utmost efforts to create insurrections in the Turkish frontier, driving the peaceably peasantry into revolt even with fire and sword, without producing a movement of any kind beyond the immediate range of their hateful operations each of these hard facts makes no impression on us for we cannot bring ourselves to face the Christian cry which would infallibly be raised against as the moment we attempted to expose, denounce, or coerce brigandage which has been handsomely subsidised from without' under the specious pretext of liberating or relieving Christians " A conspiracy did explode in that year, but fortunately Midhat Pasha was then Governor General of Bulgaria and he strung up 20 of the firebrands from Roumania!, and that extinguished the first flicker of rebellion But the outbreak of May, 1876, was better timed by Russia. It was a fortnight before the deposition of Abdul Az z when Constantinople was passing through a supreme crisis, and there were no regular troops in the disturbed district The Rev Dr Hamlin, head of the American mission in Turkey, Colonel Lloyd Lindsay, Hobart Pasha Mr. Forster, and Mr Butler Johnstone MP, all concur in asserting that the insurrection was the work of Russian agents. The local authorities telegraphed to Constantinople for troops, and for leave to defend themselves until these arrived. This was granted, and the authorities immediately armed the Mussulman population, and emptied the very gaols "It was the scum of the village? and especially of the large towns," writes Mr Butler Johnstone, ' far more than soldier, regular or irregular, Circassians or Basbi Barouks, who committed the atrocities which have filled the world with horror, and brought this fearful weight of odium on the Ottoman people and Government But it was a magnificent piece of business for Russia It enabled the Czar to stand forward as the leader of a new crusade, the knight errant of outraged womanhood and the avenger of unspeakable crimes England was thrown into a paroxysm of indignation which paralysed the foreign policy of the Government and gave Mr Gladstone an open ortunity of weakening his political opponents and of espousing the cause of the Greek Church as antagonistic to its Latin rival and the strong and Turkish feeling thus engendered in the minds of the British people was the best guarantee to Russia of their neutrality if not of their sympathy Time then if we examine link by link the chain of causes leading to the present war we shall find them to be these - 1 The traditional policy of Russia the belief of its rulers in the manifest destiny of the empire to absorb two continents and the loss of territory which it has exhibited for the last four centuries 0 The enormous value of Constantinople to a power like Russia which seated there would thus become an. Napoleon Bald 1 be mistress of the world 3 The fatal concession extorted from Turkey by the treaty of Kutchok Karnardji which allowed Russia to interfere with the Porte in the management of its Christian subjects The good natured and tolerant indifference of the Government at Stamboul in regard to the ecclesiastical administration of the affairs of the Slavonic Christians which resulted in the substitution of the Greek patriarch at Constantinople and of the form used for the bishops and priests formerly elected by the suffrages of their flocks The subordination of the synod at Stamboul to the synod at St Petersburg end of the Greek Patriarch to the Czar as the head of the church and the vicegerent of God and the immense leverage which Una gave him in working for the disintegration of the Turkish empire 6 The adroit misrepresentation by Russia of the disaffection of the Bulgarians and other Christiana to their Greek oppressors as a revolt against larkiehmisgovcrnmont and the equally adroit employment of that du affection for political purposes and as a means of holding the Moslem rule up to obloquy and execration 7 The kindling by Russia of an insurrection in Bulgaria at such a time and under such circumstances as rendered a frenzied and ferocious suppression of it inevitable, and the making use of this deplorable event as an argument in favour of crushing Turkey and of thrusting her violently out of Europe _ _ The Tower Hamlets Radical Association having addressed a letter to Mr Gladstone expressive of their thanks for his Birmmg. ham speech and their hope that he would assume the position of leader of the Radical party the right hon gentleman (the Qhhi ROle) has sent the following reply -"Dear Sir-As the Radicals of the Tower Hamlets have done me the honour to notice a speech of mine which was delivered at the hospitable board of the mayor of Burning barn and to express a hope that I may become the leader of the Radical party in the House of Commons I am desirous that they should not give me credit for more than I deserve To the best of my recollection I took occasion, from something that had been said by a preceding speaker to say in substance these three things only concern- ing Radicals -1 That in my early days the term designated persons whose temper was soured against our public authorities and institutions, and who unhappily at that time had too great reason for Buck a sourness 2 That long afterwards there came a time of political or difference, when I had known the name used as a disparaging description of any man who was in real earnest about some material political opi lines 3 That as I was addressing a Birmingham audience I assumed it to be largely composed of men who might willingly pro fees the name of Radicals but that I had not for many years been present at a public dinner when the entire company sang God Save the Queen so heartily and well Permit me to add that I am neither in the present nor the future a leader of any party or section, and that I fully recognise the right of Liberals (whom following Mr Mill, I describe as a great political Church to form themselves in subdivisions but that for myself I look upon the Liberal party at large as now, more than ever, the party from which the country is to expect reasonably good government, and while I have to morbid fear of any of its sections, all my desires therefore, have been and are to urge its union and promote its interests as a whole I am, dear BUT, CC W.
