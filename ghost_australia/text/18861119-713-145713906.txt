" what-a' ,'dreadful1 mistake you liavo made ! 'Do Mot oome. Too lato,' was the message I sent. Do you not remember that there :are 'no full-stops in telegraphy? I was married an hour ago to Lord Shorthorn. ICome in, and let me introduce you to my husband." And this was Dick Irton's little mistake. There are no full-stops in telegraphy, but when, ten minutes later, . Dick saw Lord and Lady Shorthorn drive ofE amidst showers of rice and slip\x=req-\ pel's, he knew that he had had a moral; full-stop which he would remember all his life.
