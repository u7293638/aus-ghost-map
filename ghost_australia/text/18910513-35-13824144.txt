E O Walker, H C Wollor, H C Whooltr Iho President thon delivered Iho following eddie« - My Bietbren of the Clorgy and Laity,-When tho Council of Antioch in the tourth century, prohibited tho translation of bishops from the dioceses for which they had been consecrated the prohibition was intended to act as a safeguard against certain evils local and limited to those primitive rough times which aro dis lantly removed from our happier modern experiences Mtbough a hiBliop's mlgntion from his original diocese has long ceased to run the risk of Brou«inn dislurl anco in his cathedral i ity as tho Canon of ISicea aeeenbed yet his translation can bo justified only by a prospect of larger usefulness and fullor opportunities for utilising his spiritual rasourcos Tbo inconvenience caused to a diocoso by plunging it into the eiroa of nn orlscopal election can bo compen- sated only by ¿onie substantial advantage to the Church Ihose who nto acquointcd with tho North Queensland diocese can understand tho reasons which influenced nie to ontortaiu j our proposal that I would oBBocioto myself with you in tina diocese I would most gladly have stayed in the north to spend there tho remainder of my w orkfu^ years among people whoso warm-hearted »vmpatlv and co-operation cheerod mo through Id years of religious pionoenng Tho wrench was severe, parting from a diocese whero our brotherly harmonv vins never onco disturbed by one jarring noto of diBcord God helped us to love and respect ono another and to discern some fosfuros of our one Lord among varieties of character and colourings of creel In His infinito loi e our Lord compensated us for our dm tanco irora Southern advantages by shedding upon na tbo unspeakable blessing ol peace But in spite ot tho synodi cal urgani/atiou th it nord ern diocoso continues still in ltsmiBsionary stage Its enormous area 22 tinioslurger than this Is ewcastlo diocese and its northernmost port in tho Gulf as distaut from lownsvillo as Townsville is distant from Sv dney, requires its Bishop to bo a mea below nii'dle aga lu the prime and vigour of life Ho must bear tropical climato well Ho must bo iblo to spend nino months of the year in long journeys Ho mu«t poseoss adaptability of habit to make him elf and ( thcrs at home undor all circumstances His lngsnuitv must deviso means to extend church ministrations whero people ure far opatt and fnuds aro small In short it corresponds to the condition of this diocese 40 yeal s ago when your boroic Bishop "tyrrell-may his noble spirit Ino in his successors-rodo across these parts and st imped with the undying memory of his devotion the undivided dioceso of that early time But oven ho enjoyed this cool refreshing climtteof £»ow South Wales Ho viorkod for the Church before a secular spirit had sci/od tho Government and left religion tho single uusubsidiscd agency in the btate for the lniprov ement of tho people Similarity of circum- stances, like a touch of nature, givcB mo linship with your iii st Bishop lach of my pr dcce«60rn enriched this diocoso with appropriate contributions of eervico as Lishon Tyirolt croatol this dioceso, organised and dovolopod it through

"N o pray that his hoalih may soon return and restoro to the Church in their former brightness thooo Intellectual gifts which made the sermon» and wrltin"sof Bishop Pearson judicious defences of the faith If proof wore Bought of tho »kill and strength which built up this diócesi and inspired its clergy and members with oorporato vitality, that proof must bo apparent in tho fact that daring four
