The Bishop's Ghost. A tale of the late Bishop Wilberforce. So many tales of him have been current, but I do not believe that this has ever before gone abroad. In early days he had a close friend, a school chum, a college companion ; but about the time young Wilberforce took orders these two had a bitter and hopeless falling out. They never got over tho disunion, and fell utterly apart. The chum became an extensive landowner, and was master of a charming house in the south of England. Time past on, and he grew elderly. He thought of making II√çB will. Being a great man, not only his solicitor but the solicitor's son arrived on the scene for the event. All three gentlemen were in the library-a long room, with many windows running down almost to the ground. Suddenly the young man present saw a gentleman go by the first of tbeBe windows. The elder lawyer raised his head as tho figure went by the second opening. Last of all the master of the house looked up. "Why, that is Wilberforce," he exclaimed. " How many years it is since we fell out, and I dared him ever again to seek me out." So saying, he ran to the halldoor to welcome his guest, towards whom no bitter feeling now re- mained in his mind. Strange to say, the Bishop was not at the door, nor could he be found within the grounds. At the moment of his appearance he had fallen from his horse in this neighbourhood and had been iustantfy killed.
