I'TEE " TAL". OFT-LO7ET,, -fYSTERY', AND cMAIAE. By the author of " The Lcavenworth Caee." BOOK IV.---XROM 4. TO Z. A CHAPTER XXXIX., * .-. TROit A. TO Z. " A ,aked humau huart," --Youao. houo mof. y Lall you in thiithe fin?ll hour of our separation, but- never again, dear one, never 'again.., Whezi I said.to you, just twenty foiur hours ago, that my sin was .buried and my future wai clear, I spake as men speak who forgot the justice of God and 'dream only of His mercy. Aut hour's time convinced me that an evil deed once perpretrated by a main is never buried so that its ghost will not rise. Do as we will, repent as we may, the shadowy phantom of a stained and unrighteous youth is never laid; nor is a man justified in. believing iti so "till death has closed his eyes, and fame written its epitaph upon. his tomb. " Paula, I am at this hour wandering in search of the being' who holds the secret of my life," and who will to morrow blazon it before all the world. lI is with no hope I, seek him. God has not brought me to this pass, to reldase me at last from shame and .disgrace.' Suffeoing, and the loss of anlmy sad heart cherished, wait at my; gates. Only one boon remains, and that is your sympathy, and the conso-. lation of your regard. These though bi'towed as friends bestow them, are very precious to mio;,I. cannoti seec then go, and that they may not, I tell you.the full story of my life. My youth was happy, --m3, eaiy youth, I, mean. Bertram's father was dear brother to me, and sy: mothore..a watchful guardian and~atender friesd. At fifteen I ontered a bank, the "small bank'in"Grotewell, whih ydou oulht to remember. From the lowest posi tion in it, I graduallj,'worked'my way up till I occupied the cashier's place; and was just congratulating: myself uon my prospe.ts .whed One Dela - field returned ronm boardin-.shool, a young.lady. " Paula, there is a fascination, which some men who have known (nothing deeper and higher 'oall'love. I, who in those days ahad cherished..butofew thoughts beyond the ordinary reach of a narrow and ':somewhat seafish busines~s mind, imafgied that the well-spring of'all'romancehad bubbled .up within me, when my.eyes first. fell upon this' ,regal. blonde :with her sleepy, inscrutable eyes and b'ewildei ing smile. Ulysses, within sound oi the siren's voco, was niothing to it. H7e had been warned of his danger, and had only his own curiosity to com bat, while I was not' even laware of my peril, and floated' within reach" of this woman's power, without,. making an efort to escape. .shewasso subtle 'in herz influence, Paula'; so careless' in 'the very exercise of her 'sovereignty.

Like a star seen above the glare of anonfiagra'rin, the pure sipirit thatiniformted your glanc flashed on "my biuring soul, and for a moment I kuow-tlhrt in you budded the kind of woman-nature which it befitted a man to seek ; that in the hands of such an one as youn would nmake, shoiuld he . triust his honour and bequealth ihis.happiness.

He was the squire of tlie'towr, and as such entitled to respect, but he was.also something more, as' you will presently discover. His answer to my plea was: ' '"Well, how much money. have'you to show ?' ' '1Now I had none. My salary as eashior of a small country bank was not large, and my brother's prolonged. sickness and subsequent death, to gether with my own somewhat luxurious habits, had utterly exhausted, it. I told him so, but added that I had,'somewhere up among the hills, an old.maiden aunt who had promised me mive thousand dollars at her death; and that as she was very ill at that time;-hopelessly so, her neighbours thought,-in a few weeks I should doubtless be able to satisfy him with the sight of d sum sufficient to start us sn housekeeping, if no more. ' He nodded at this, but gave me no distinct reply. ' Let us wait,' .said he; ": . But youth'is not inclined to wait. I considered my cause as good as won, ,a'd$began to make all my prepara tions accordingly. With a feverish impatience, which is .no sign of true love, I watchod the days go by, and waited, for, if I,.did not anticipate, 'the death which I fondly imagined would make all clear.
