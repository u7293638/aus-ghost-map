REVIEW Among the works just issued by Messrs George Robertson and Co , Melbourne, is one which bears the stamp of high poetic in spiration on every page, namely, “Poems of Henry Kendall ” To anyone with a taste for poetry, the gi eat merit of Kend ill’s lyuos must be obvious at a glance, piesent mg as they' do a lofty older of thought clothed in unmbcis at all times faultlessly musical Although an Australian himself, aud although his poetry years ago met with waim lecoguition in the Bntish Isles, and still wanner in the Un'ted Stites, Kendall is now only beginning to receive in Aus tiaha that hoin ige to which his genius on titles him Many of the ablest men m other conn tnes led the way in doing him honoi, and Austialu is now honoring herself by following in then wake From a piefatoiy note to Kendalls woiks bv Mi P J Holdswoith, we learn that the poet, Hemy Clateuce Kendall, was born in the Ulladalla distuct, New South Wales, on 18th April, 1841, aud that his school educ ition was of the elementaiy soit then and theie obtainable His f ithcr w is a thoi ghtfnl and well lead man, and his mothci was gifted w ith much intellectual pow ei lu his school boy and ly s Kendall w as au omuivoious leaner, and his taste foi poetiy v..is stiongly marked He adopted the law vs a piofcssion, but find mg it uncongenial to his poetic feelings, he abandoned it, and shoitly afterwaids euteied the Public Sen ice, lust in the Survey Office, and subsequently m the Colounl Seciet.uy’s Department He was aiovv a mamed man, having wedded a duightei of the lite Di Ruttci, of Sydney, a I idy desenbed ns in every vv iy fitted to make lus home happy Becoming dissatisfied with his piospects, how evei, he lesigned, and as he had about this time won a poetical puzo offered by a Victo inn journal, he thought that he might hi and hteiaiy' employ ment in the southern metio polls This stop, uudei the circumstmce", was utteily disastrous, and in Melbourne he passed through vicissitudes which wieoked Ins finely stiuug organisation, drink—that mciciless enemy of Bums, and Maugin, ami Poe, and Goidon, ami many othei sons of song—embittciing the close of his life Eventually he went back to Sydney, and some time afterwaids Sn Hemy Paikesap pointed him Inspector of Forests, but bis w isted frame was then unfit to cope with the duties of Ins new situation, ami aftei fuithei snffoungs he passed away from euthly troubles on the Ist August, 1882, in the 42ud yen of Ins age His biogr.aphei mentions that ho w as bailed in the Wav ei ley Cemeteiy by a meie h vuilful of mourners, 20 being the full total New South Wales, however, has made some amends by the cue she has shown for the widow and oi phans of the poet, and by the tribute v Inch she has leceutly paid to his memory We could have wished that Mt Holdswoith had, in Ins able aud sy mpa.- thctic memon of the poet, giv en us a little of the history of lus pioductions, as that w oil'd m some degicc have furnished a key to lus inner life Howevei, we may easily fancy the ft clings of Kenuall while in lus lonely bonis, from time to time, producing those beautiful cications winch he well knew would bung Inin a wide and solid fame, compaied with which the unveiling of Ins memoital tablet by Lord Cairmgcou, and Mi Dvlley s eloquent oiation oi> tie ooca sion, uc but a tailing euncst Kendall could see thatinmdei tognn a hvehhooi foi himself aud family he would lequne to bid idieu to the Muses, and buiy those talents which, as Milton felt of Ins own, “’tweio death to hide ” \es, Kendall saw tli it the march of life was an utihtaiiin quickstep, but fancy the while kept wl ispei mg to him the wolds of Cimplicit, u lus ‘ Ode to the Memoiy of Burns O deem not midst tins woridh strife An idle art the 1 oct hrm„’ Let high phdosophv contioi, And Mgc- elm t ic sfream of Inc Tis he ref ies its foun am qi m.,, — The nobler passions of the soul Mi Holdswoith, in speaking of Kendall’s poetic abilities, says tint “ Austialia has produced no svveetei smgei,” and so fai as Australian poetiy has come uudei out notice we readily cndoisc tint estimate, though of com sc the issue must be left to the lapse of time In such matteis the woild is the best cutic, individual taste, howevei sound, being but limited in its nnge In dealing w ith the flora aud f mu i of Ins nativ e laud Kendall is chiefly seen it Ins best He has an exquisite vppi eei ition of the be mties of uituic, and he dwells with a loving entlm si ism on cveiy feiture of the kmdscipe Uu some othei subjects, however, such as nn piessive .Scuptuial incidents, scenes in anthology, and even on a few homely topics, ho has shown immense povvei In tie volume befoie us, winch coot mis 304 pages, tlieie aie about SO pioductions, the subjects of vl!
