I have now to introduce to my readers fhtee individuals whose characters were" so powerfully marked, 'and whose actions were so intermixed and Closely linked that for long 1 have put eft alluding to them, not at all sure of -my- ability jo. 'grapplp with the . various detafl%aad hpoyey^to the reader leyep ; and daaigerrcrimes.' "In 'the sketch entitled: ^iThe-^dry-3of!aB^lllet', " allusion is made to a-daring'tcnminal who Became one of the most determinedhunters of thieves that ever trode these streets—" that man was Hugh Mclndoe. I donft -mean that he turned detective or policemain c —farfromit-—I mfehnhunfer of thieved ip' the most fierce and remorseless sense that1 it is possible to convey by words. The" story of the man lB euggestive ; there is a; deep interest not only about his sharp con version, but aboift the whole of the exciting string of events that followed. I therefore 'would crave fbe,' readel^s <3Mest\ attention while I try"to relate" them in their proper sequence." Near the head of Leitt Wynd there stood a t block T)f • houses -called " The Happy liand," afterwards notorious overall Scotland through tumbling down about the ( ears of the inmates and crushing and kill-' ingseveral in its ruins; and in this land, shortly after the scattering of Macluskey's gang, there gathered a nest of thieves who for Boldness and activity would have passed for a gang hajiwe only" been able to spot out any one as the head. That there was a leader—-active, talented, and daring in the extreme—we: had not a^ shadow df a doubt. Bobberies were committed which no common thief could have planned, and which could only have been carried out by the most systematic allotment of tasks to the various members, while counterfeit . coin came floating about under our . very hoses, so.cleverly passed that not a trace of the "smashers" but the bits of plated pewter-laid before us was ever discover able. Shop-lifting, too, of the swiftest and cleanest was reported-every other day; and a few of these cases in a vague way directed our ©yes to the nest of. thieves in the " Sappy Land," and at the same time sent us spying and questioning at some of the captured members as to the name and identity of their leader. Here, however, we were astonished to learn that the thieves themselves were nearly as ignorant as the police. They had a leader, who planned the work in all its details, and also got them out of scrapes when,such a thing was possible; hut he' was only known to a select1 few—never 1 consorted or, lived with , them-^always came in disguise and departed in thersame —sometimes in women's clothes, but more generally disguised as an old man, with i a stooping gait, aethmatic coughj and "heavy, hoarse voice—assumed, no doubt, Eke the'' clothes and "wig. No one knew ,who he, was—what was his name—occupation, or even probable age—there were even doubts ■ as to whether he was not a woman; but a3 every thief in the gang was under a terrible oath"not to pry into things that did not concern them, and as it was to their interest'to keep the said oath, the identity of 'the -Unhnqwu,-up to the; time iof whnjh ,1 write7 remained jsecima and uim ,challenged.. \- Thieves, being bften deplorably ignorant, are noti without'superstition, and this, with .the -mystery surrovmding the man,r the suddenness with - which 'he sometimes dropped upon them, and the swif tness with. whicn he spotted out a delinquent, led them to dub him The Buf&an;, which, I may explain,^ in thieves' Latin simply" means The Devil. Here was a pretty .romance to, unravel; and, indeed, however much our curiosity was quickened, for long I was not sure hut therascals were merely pulling the long, how for our especial benefit; and I knqw not how long the mystery might have remained unsolved had not our curiosity spread to themselves. To explain this • I must now come to Hugh Mclndoe and bis connection with the gang. ; " 1 Hugh Mclndoe had been bred £ black smith^—that is, he had neatly -finished his apprenticeship to -the trade,, whop he giot in tow with a girl on the streets called Kate Jackson, and they r Vveht' straight downwards, till he landed.in- the. profession.' The two agreed well together,-.1 -am- bpund. to confess, and stuck; to each other through thick andr thin with a devotion and affection I. have seldom seen surpassed*, but^after all> they were" only thieves, and, Kate, las the wife of.a.thief, was not greatly better than, she-'hed been when;on the streeta.; She was faithful to him, that was all; . j 7 " Youate a great fooi, Mclndoe/?

"If youarejafraid to speak, !I am not." ,. /. " Then do you mean to withdraw and work on your own hook ?" cautiously asked. one of the thieves.. i . , " No, I don't want that either, though I'll go that length rather than be swindled. But I am determined to know whom jl work for, and what share he considers, nie worth; and I will, too—I swear it now 1" i "You are drunk, Hugh, or you wouldn't let your prating cheat wag so freely. Do you foyget them that has tried that game already,-. and; only:[burnt their fingers? How many has he hunted down for a mere cross word?; Take care! your turn may come." ; " Let Lira try it, , I'm soft" and quiet; but I'm a devil when I'm roused," returned. Mclndoe. " Let any one injure me or mirie -without causa, and I'll show.them a thief's vengeance. I only want justice, which yalu. pitiful- sneaks are afraid to ask. Bah, I'm ashamed ;of you 1" ■ ; _ . " Well, we can send word torhim^arid. hear what he says; hut stow yourwhids-p-. think what you like, hut keep it to your self.

He was seen no more about the Happy:Land, and became even more hidden in his. communications with the gangs It is true that all the concessions demanded hy Mclndoe were freely granted,. hut if the rash thief believed on that account that all was. still light between them he -wasfrightfully mistaken!.

We led Mm through; every one of the empty Tooine, and then a look came into his eyes so'fiendish,^'so'remorseless' and vengeful, that I hope nev^r to see the like oh a human countenance again: ; ' " Betrayed—sold—fooled—by' the . Ruf fian!" he hissed out through his tedth. " And this is only the first stroke. I am to he hunted down. Well, let him; it will he the worst job he ever tried: - Take me away—lbck me up—give me half a stretch —a year—a fiver—ten—twenty if you like ;*ril live through it all—live to make him'feel it." ' " " And who's The Ruffian, pray ?" I asked, as carelessly as possibly. • • ' : " I don't know—nobody does; but I will someday. Iam patient—oh, so patient! And poor Kate ; if he lays a finger, on her he may order his coffin." . "Doeshe write Without a pen—after this fashion?" I asked, holding but the anonymous note of the forenoon before his eyes.

The white snowflakes fell faster and faster,-but they . only seemed to. lie softly and kindly, giving her the shelter and covering that all .this earth had refused. .But it. was cold, cold, —and fear for her treasure made, her tear ; up her shawl into strips to wrap round the child's, limbs.- Then she cuddled herself closely round it>; crouching to. keep the, vvind from him, and "huddling closer to the' • rpck to keep out the drift,1 and the dim moon looked down pityingly on the lonely pair,-and the drift hurried in tester and' faster to complete, its work, and then, udder the soft white 'mantle poor Kate ■ ' tell adeep-for ever. •/ She was fouud-' thus next' day. by one of the keeper's frozen stiff as a stone.

Poor Kate ! no stone marked her' grave, and -the * only. notie'e taken of her death was a brief news paper paragraph under the heading, " Woman found dead in the Queen's Park." J — '■' ! A few months after Mclndoe was "Set at -liberty. He was in the highest spirits, and.. on bidding the governor of the prison fare well, and thanking him for-all his kindness and good advice, assured him that he had resolved that that should he his last con viction for theft, and that he and his wife would henceforth lead a new itnd a better life. • : At the head; of the North Bridge he" stumbled against one of the gang, Who no. sooner recognised him than lie tried to slip away -without a -word. - But Mclndoe was not to be eluded. He collared the thief, and dragged him bodily into the nearest publichousey and there put the one vital/ question— ; « Where's Kate ?" ; \- The man paled, shuffled, and shrank; butmade no reply. " Where's Kate, and Tommy, and how are "they all, and how have they fought through it ?"• repeated Mclndoe, with grow-' ingalarm. "Speak, man." . • i "Have; ye not heard anything?" asked. the man, without looking him in the face. . " How could I ? I'm not five minutes out," was the hurried rejoinder. "Tell me, man—she's not ill, is she?" . " N6/ she's' not ill," dubiously returned the: thief; " but I'd rather not say anything about her. Good day," and he tried to rush out of the shop, but was nearly strangled in the attempt. - ' " Tell me what's up at once," cried •Mclndoe, in desperation. "Do it, or-I'll throttle you." : " Well, I'in afraid you'll be cut up about it," slowly answered the thief, in tones that were like a funeral knell to all Mclndoe's hopes; "and I'd rather take half a Stretch in quod than have to tell yet it. Both Kate and wee Tommy's dead." ' ".Dead—ideaa—dead?" 1 : The three words came.out indncredulous gaspS, and Mclndoe was staggering back' .white as a ghostras he: utteredthOm.' ; o Yes; .she:;:tdofc:ther feveri and wasn't over: strong when The Ruffian-made us turn her .'out.: Then she . tried the; honest, dodge, s&yinghhat; you meant to he square when you came out; and it might. have .worked, oiily The Ruffian—. • : " Ay, The Ruffian-r-rtell me'about him," gasped Mclndoe; in a half-stupified tone. m "-Well,. be bad her hunted down ; told every one what .she was, made; them, 'ask for her character, and so on; and then,, poor lass; she ■ prigged something and was got lying dead in the Queen's Park" ; . And. this- L;you, you fiends—whom 111 never injured ;hy word or deed—helped to do?" cried Mclndoe, waking up as.fyom a dream.

Whan hext We heard of him he had started to wCrkat his trade at .a ismiddy in the Horse' Wynd,and appeared to have changed frofla a violent ana reckless thief into a quiet, inoffensive working' man. That was the outside—but inside what was it ?—slum-' bering fire — vengeance nursed —■ hate: cherished as a sole passion and incentive tp hard labor. He worked like a.slave, early and late, and lived like a miser, and thus began to layby money. How was it to be spent? .This question I will try to an swer as these sketches proceed.
