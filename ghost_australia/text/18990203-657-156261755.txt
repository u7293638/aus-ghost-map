Criclcet. - SCONE v. ABERDEEN. . HILL MAKES 143. When Ihe uufayouralilo wcatlior pre vented the match arranged hot ween Scone and Aberdeen being played last Saturday, lovers of tho game here were determined that that should not, if they could help it, deprive us of tho opportunity of seeing the now gener ally acknowledged premier batsmen of the colonies give au exhibition of his prowess. Consequently, it wns ar ranged for the match to -come off here yesterday afternoon, which it did, in presence of a goodly number of inteiOoted spectators. Of course, against a combination like that of tho visitors, the Sconeites, who had not their full strength, never expected to have a ghost of a show, but still tho match scrvad the purpose for which it was arranged. Wright, winning the toss from Moore, took the wickets. Greeu, after making nine— ('Nine, dear Clementine, he's beaten .your score at Aberdeen,' remarked a wit among the fair sox, by way of taunt) — suc- cumbed to Butler Hill joined Wright, and after taking a few overs cautiously, the batsmen gave tho howlers and fieldsmen a lively time :of it. ''When the score was 100 Wright was caught out on the leg by Windsor. Power joined Hill, who was cordially ap plauded on completing his century. After this, and with the score boyond the second century, Hill started skying to give the fieldsmen a chance, a.id got two out of tiia ground for 5 each. He' waB dropped a couple of times, but not getting properly under one, he was taken by Daley. The batsman appeared to place and do as ha pleased with the bowl ng. Ho is remarkably active, and quick on his tent, turning and getting a ball to fino log in a moment.- He a pears to bo best 011 the leg, though thero can bo no mis take about his hitting and driving powers. Though'- not so found .and consistent, there are, perhaps, ' several 'more ? attractive and artietic ' batsmen.
