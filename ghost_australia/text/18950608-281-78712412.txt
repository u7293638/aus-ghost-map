il| A Ghost. It is a pity to disappoint readers, but those who expect to find under the Leading just given anything about the ghost which has been drawing crowded houses" on the Abbey OrOvU road for a week will bo disap pointed. What wo desire to writo of is the literary ghost —that being who iV s work for pay to which another mn pats his name, and for which tint other man gets tho credit. Such ?s gaost was the " littery gept," as Tlcckeray would call him, who some t T.P ago sued Mr Henniker Heatou, "'I P,in a British lav,- court. Such a p s * \ was the kind of private secre- L.-y whom, Dickens tells ns, .in \ cj-ilas Rickleby, Mr Gregsbury, 'LP , wanted. And such a ghost has __ t .nade his appearance in Sydney, in the service of tho protectionist p„rtv. At a public ineeitng in one of l' l metropolitan suburbs, not long -go, three gentlemen read speeches in c, -jojitioii to the policy of the Keid -linstry. Some enquiring and in genious reporter managed to get hold of the manuscript of the speeches and resolutions, and discovered that they wcie all in tho same handwriting, and tl at the paper waa all embossed with one and the same stamp. Row, the ! glio t who did this must have been a very clever fellow. Let us hope that h 3 nrty was uot ghost-like aud uusub bntial.
