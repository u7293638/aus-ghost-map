The aborigines here, have long been a puzzle, not only lo. the professed missionary,but to those-philanthropioJndividuals who endeavor to assist in. this, good work. Each successive report issued by the Board} appointed to guard the interests of' the. natives. only goes. to. confirm the Cut, that neither, in arresting .(he Mortality which is sweeping off the original inhabitants of the colony, or in improving their bablte, cip any progress be noted'' Some^physical alleviation may have been a^rd^ ili'em, lot their mot^l | improvement is ml farofE: as ev.er,. apdi they bave np.more idea now, of 'adopting, any set-' tied forms of industry, than they had on the first day when.

He has madfe. vpyages with tlie' sliipj and ibeen" on boaifl, eiebpt on one'or two "ocMsions, for a considerable period. "Yet the Bo;ird report his conduct as unsatisfactory, and that he is deficient in the qualities which heiopg to a sailor.' In case of punishment being necessary, he exhibits "only stolid indifference." .Howe ver-eevere-ihe -punish caent • may -be, be exhibits no feeling. This characteristic, it ia • remarked, would not be a mark of inferiority if joined to otlier qui|litiesj jbut he lacks the, amour propre, that personal ^pride,- and desire lo b<j though J, well of, without vrhicb isental pcog^ess is Impossible, f ' The Board, in concluding their Teport, state that the natives " can bear severe toil when that becomes necessary ta their pleasures, and in their native wilds, where they have remained' ! qncontaininated; they possess the qualities and a&ections;, which lead to the exercise of humanity and forbearance, bpt once attempt to bound them within the restraints of civilization and all their.weaknesses appear. They are feareless, uncertain,'rmder some circumstances wanting in tine courage, and they have no self-respect" Thus, it will be seen, that the chances of civilization arc all bat liopeless, and the " die-! like of work" way be considered as the principal cause of-the failures at all attempts at civilisation, whether by missionaries or philanthropists. Although, however, the task of civilisation may be discouraging, it is still the duty of colonists to mitigate, (LSinucb as possible, those sufferings, which, to' ia oertain extent, are brought about by ourselves The Board has been much impeded in its efforts to give relief, by itp want of means, and we impress on those, T^hose " hands arc. always ready," ibs,t before ire-can epare money to 'distant- missionary enterprise, we should look to the poor aboriginal, who is often starving almost at tmr very doors:' ' • * v By advertisement we see that to-njon-ow a. great Jiahdicap billiard inatch comes off at the Lounge; as neady all the best Maldon players are expected to compete,'an exciting game may be expected. A curious ease of tenacity of life waa yesterday ^brought under wjt^jiotice. A young Wy beiugin the habit t)f attending the poultry yard of her parents, found two hens who had maternal notions, and that their b$nt should be allowed didnot suit the wishes of their owners, so the young lady in perfect innocence caught the two unfortunate would-be .mothers, and placed them under a box ; ten days afterwards the box was accidentally shifted, and die fowls found still alive ! They were, aamajr be ima-. gined, in a very exhausted condition, bnt'.by great care they were brought round, and are now getting on " as well as can be expected.™ . The London correspondent oi BeWs Life in Yictori/r, speaking ^if- th'e <3bainpion Bowing Match, says—"The expected treat for which so many jowipg men bad been so long looking forward, in the contest between Everson and Chambers, proved a very hollow thing at last, Everson not. making anything like sp food a figlit of it as'raany of-a6had anticipated,*iu fact he never had a ghost of a chance with Chanjbers, -who did what he liked with him. It now remains to be seen if Dick Green, of Sydney, can, lower the .Newcastle «oan.'s colors, - as the psjf are matohed to. pull on .16th June.
