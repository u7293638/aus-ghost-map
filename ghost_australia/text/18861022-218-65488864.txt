An EnghliMsla hoMt Story Lady Hloby is again said to be haunting Bisbam Abbey, and is causing no little sensation." She was the 'wife of the English ambassador to the Court of France in 1566. The Abbey is the most historic relicious house in Berkshire, and in one of the apartments is a peculiar painting representing the lady with a very white face and hands, dressed in the coif, weeds, and wimple then allowed to a baronet's lady. In this identical dress, it is most strongly averred, she has been frequently seen in one of the bedrooms of the Abbey with a self-supporting basin miving before her, in whichl she is perpetually trying to wash her hands, but the most remarkable part of the story is that the so-called apparition always appears in the negative, viz., the black part white and the white part black. The story, as now told by the domestics and villagers, is that she beat her son Willimin to death because he could not write without making blots, and a singular part of the tale is that a short time ago, in altering the shutters of the dining-room, a great number of children's copy-books of the time of Queen Elizabeth were discovered pushed between the joists of tihe floor, some of which answered exactly to the tale as if the child'could not'write a single line without makiing a blot. Neither the domestics at the Abbey" nor tihe adjacent villagers will hear one word against the narrative.--Loiatdo Lettfr in the Philadelphic Teleyraph.
