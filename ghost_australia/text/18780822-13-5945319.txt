MR. THOMAS SHAW AND MR. DWYER, M.L.A. TO THE EDITOR OF THE Alta US. Sir -The defence of Mr Longmore by Jeremiah Dwyer is one of those affecting in stances of friendship which are so rare in this degenerate ve world Still the ugly fact remains unaccounted for, that Mr Longmore gave an allotment of land to a man who already po3 sessed land, and denied it to one who had a large family and no land The uglier fact remains that this man who got the selection was a canvasser for Mr Dwyer in his late election With that breadth of mental culture which so distinguishes Mr Dwyer, he would make it appear that the chairman of the local board gave the land to 1 stilborn How in the world Mr Dwyer can prove this, or even say it, I cannot understand The board was composed of three members, two of whom were officials Now, for Mr Dwyer to say that the chairman gave the selection to any one is simply a falsification of fact; he could not do so Then for the hon member to say that I know anything about the reasons of the board giving the selection to 1 holborn is one of those grossly unfounded insinuations so common, to the "liberal mind If Mr Munro was entitled to the land by prior selection, why hold a land board and induce 100 people to pay their £1 and waste their time' Mr Dwyer makes much capital out of the fact that only one could get it True, O King But not a vestige of injustice would have been felt and the fair decisions of the land board been carried out The gross injustice-the crying wrong-is the inducing people to pay money when it is pie determined to give the land to a p artisan, and not to the one who wins it b) ballot or in all) other we ny a land board mm decide 1 his case simply proves that justice does not reign in our Lands department that the in licence of an unscrupulous member is supports right By Mr D»»)ers own letter we are informed how much he works for his friends Munro tells hogsheads ises Munro to appeal In the utmost simplicity Dwyer tells us no other applicant appealed Exactly so the other applicants had not been canvassers for the honourable member Although it seems that Mr Woods is somewhat insensible to the influences of Jeremiah. Ah- Long more listens to him and grants ins requests The subject itself is small, but it opens up to view the acts of these men, who go on the rampage about what other men do From the addresses, frequent long and strong of Mr Longmore and his colleagues in office, the people are led to think that righteousness, justice, and truth only dwell with then, while here we have clearly exposed gross wrong, favouritism, and injustice The squatter, the squatter's son, and to my mind, the most cruel of all, the working men who have ever worked for a squatter or a large landed proprietor, are placed under a ban by this present Minister of Lands 'The, poor fellows, whose misfortune it is to have worked when they only could get work, are not to have land of an) privilege this vin dictive unjust steward can prevent Would you believe it, Sir' I have been told that all) applicant for the land granted to Munro who said he was working for a large landed proprietor had not a ghost of a chance given him His name was immediately erased, and this in a country) hitherto famed for British law and justice You do not wish, I am sure, to give space for personalities but you will allow me to state that I shall not oppose Mr Dy)er at the next election I trust better men will, and be successful You will let me thank Mr Dwyer for once descending from his high ] position to explain matters I feel honoured that he has noticed me I was not aware till he indirect!) told us that he was a man of mental culture I had for once believed Mr Berry, was he assured us that the professor was the only man of learning among his party As hat a pity that mental culture should descend so low as in the one case to be employed in past) pickings and in the other as a park) hack -I am one , THOMAS SHAW.
