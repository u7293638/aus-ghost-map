CItINESE IN CALIFORNIA.-CIHINA TOWN. (Hepworth1, Dixon's " Whle Conelst.") A sEVENTlw part of the polulation-I- Uc ventieth part of the surface-of Salt Frain cisco, is Asiatic. All Orientals pack closer than Europeans. A man may see big crowds in many cities: l.uss and Tartars at Nislni-Novgorodtl, Copts :od1 Armenians in Jerusalem, Arabs and Algerines in Cairo but in neither liussia, Syria, or Egypt can he see such crowds as we firol packled in the siatic quart of ar n Francisco. 'le terms sflaic'lunrtbrmaLy suggest a s ratosa-po o o lih city, iallcd oFl' from the remnaining partliko Ohinc Town in MIoscow; but the Asiatie quarter in San Francisco is an open colony, like Mayfair in London, like the Second District in New York. The Chinese livo squatted in the very heart of San Francisco. Lock Sin's tea-house in Jackson- street may be regarded as the heart of this new Asiatic empire in America ; for in Jackson street, grouped around Lock Sin's balcony, lie the Chinese baulnks rd stores, the Chli noses stalls anld markets, the Chinese thea tres mind gamning-hells; while off this thoroughfare, to the right iand left, extend the blind alleys and nmseles ss passages iln which reside thcChinese rogues iand thieves with their unfaililg complenment of femiale slaves. Here, bright with paper laiterns, glare the two great tea-houses, kept by Lock Sin and Hiing Kee, in which you silp green tea ndl watch tl danqng irls perform their ites. ere, l jc \'in reiiand black flags, ? must thl'gonei~,P nd cymbals, tndsT o UNChoy, the royal theatre, ian whichl a grald itorical play, a chroni dle of the 31ing Dynasty, lhas been going on for three weeks past, and is to rumsn on briskly for about ninue weeks yet to come. Iin front of us, hardly less rich in red and yellow paint, hardly less noisy with shawmn nud tom.tonm, rises Sing 'Ping .luein, the new theatre, in which lighter pieces are perforsmed, not lasting more than thirty or forty niights, Hereabout lie the tan collara and thieves' ming cribs, in which sallow w etches and sir hdeot artners of the t sex lint ?h1a ess pleasure of g bott dollar on ii dominio. About'these cellars ie the opium dens, to which the ganmesters come in their frenzy, and snatele the still more fearful joy of stakiing their health ansd immhood oln ia fumne of poppy-juice. ]iound that corner stands the greait joss-house, ai large room, hung with sC'eei!s oand banneirs, dizzling in red and gold, ii which an idol squats ; not a Mo[ongolian god with flat anud slhaen fiaco, iand tturned-up Tartar eyebrows, but a Teu totic master, with straighlt nose, fair nious tache, and pointed beard. Before this foreign idol tea-cups hiss iand fuzees bun night and day. China Town is running over San PFrau cisco, slreading to ueast and west, to northl and south. Thei Asiaitics have seized a good part of Dupont-street and Kearney-stroeet, swarmed into Pine-stroeet, invaded Stock tonand P'acific streets, iandl got their feet in California-street. Soue of tihe houses in the streets aire owned by Mongols. WheTn Asiatics get insido ai door they drive the Europeans out. A European cannot staud the fumeo and steoch, the dirt and din. Tlhus shop by shop, and street by street, they crawl along, ai swarm of lesai asIn unnlon things, so oddly maixeod that white msnt shthlih frost themn in tasr and wratlhiisi I rom sicoml)pany of lep.h No alite i' oliices to siel, undler thoi lmo-s itl yellow man; no white woman likes to a~sS through Jack street, A rookery tand ai cesspool drive off decent folk. Let us drop into some of ,those hlouses, no fear of lopers in our theairts, and see these Asiatics in their homes, Not far from Lock Sin's tea-hlouse stands a big ediflico, first used as the Globe Hotel; Ia house four stories high above the ground, six windows to the front, and boasting of roomts enough for fift, guests. Including vaults nud attics .there maiy be sixty rooms in all; Sur rounded by the Chinese roolkery this CGlobs Hotel, no longer fit for decent visitors, is let to Lee Si Tut, a richr Chi neso, who re-lots his apartments to Chinese residents of the better class-to slopmet, waiters, and agents. Leo 8I Tut takes care to have no tenant of bad repute. A thief, a rag-picler, a night.prowler cannot hire a bed in his hotel. No painted women psss his doors, Tan aud other lawless games aire forbidden, No wrangling or Itghting is allowed within the house; So faEns order can bd made by rules, order is satid to rqleign among Lee Si Tut's tonants; and tthe Globe Hotel in Jackson-street msay bp. rogi'cded as the royal Ilan and autnmmr.palase of the :Chineso elmpiro in Asserl, e. 1'sss in, Oh, Loo'Si Tut l A selonineg .od]o: gretls your ntostrils oc hIis stops, A ruook olesla out of every door, asd dirt lies heaped on every landting stags, The dust 'of yenrs inerusts hIis wuindow paneso, Com rpirodel'wlri thits Globe Hotel, under Leo Bi ! t, a ''ubl'rldsh or a Spanish prison 'is s . deseit tiida, Theo banistors'idrip ; the pa5. saiges sweat.

Iaquiry shows me that this story of sub-letting and dividing the rooms is strictly true. Hi Wyolt lets his shelf to Li 11o; Ki Wyok using his shelf for the other twelve hours. In some rooms three sets of lodgers occupy the shelves every 24 hours- eight hours apiece. Yet thoseo who ledge in this hotel live in a light and roomy palace by the side of thoo seli who livo in the ltbyrinth of courts and styes, yairds anld entries, lying roundl Bartlett'alley, lHere sonme of the white settlers ii San Francisco throw up their hives. ThIe ground is undraiised.

Worse still, if in the "lowest depth" there can be found a " deeper still," is the thieves' (1uar0ter ; is district runnisg in and ou0t of more respectable quarsters with a rare diniftbreneo as to social tforms. In the thieves' quarter it is well to have a guide and escort, for the Chinese criminal has curious ways, and your ramblo in his pur lieus should be made at night. All round llartlett-alloy lie the thieves' yards and cribs; foul attics, falling balco nies, underground kennels; with a few spikes of joss- wood burning at achb door. Hugs rot on thie ground anl garliago poisosis the air. Slush squirts at you from iunder every plank, and where tlhe plnlis ifil you, the earthll appears to be nothing but a running sore.
