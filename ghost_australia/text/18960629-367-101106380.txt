MY NIGHT. Tax day draws to Its dote, The ihadows deeper grow, Flont in the dark'aing wet, Fades e'oe the seanet glow. Up from the dim sae-line Bi.. mistl, like baltte.-smoe, Ano low, and snd, the wind, Flowelo thro' pine and ak. Deeper the dutknes fatis, Slowly o'erwhelmlDg all; Tell the last ray of light Dies 'oeith tUe cirelidg pall. Into my heart creep doubt, lorrow, regret, anod er; Bise up and people the night, shadowe fansteste, dre~. Fear tbt nightb, now falleo, Nicer may lilt agaio; That my .?Pl for aver, Will live in gloom and paia. Ghost of the puat front me, &Meeries; I long tboght dead I Bring to me, notidden, Thaobht* eame?os, slumdeal, d?lrd. Upwards mine eyes I lift, To see if ray of moon Or starlight's tains glesmlang OGlint yet thro' lnght's deep noon. Only drkness thiek'ning I And chill mists from the se; Cloer and closer drawing. Kiad eaven pity me.
