CYCLING NOTES. [By I Geab.] Bankers' road race, postponed last Saturday on account of bad weather, will come off to-morrow. The starting point will be tho Causeway Bridge, and the riders will proceed to the Caunington Hotel and baok to Perth. .Ex pected that liianv of tho bankers will go into liquidation on reaching tho hotel. L«.uly cyclists in a quandary. Several of them had promised to join the Perth Club in its run to morrow, but have written suggest ing that the joint run should bo postponed until the following Satur day. It is shrewdly suspected that tho captain of the Perth Club has something1 to do with the altera tion. As he will be taking part in tho 'bankers' race' to-morrow, he would not bo able to join his own club, and— well, of course, tho inference in plain. At any rate, it's ' a guinea to a gooseberry' that tho aforesaid mentioned ladies will be followers of tho Bankers' Road. Race. I note that several cyclists do not think it sufficient honor to bo chosen to represent their club ; thoy want trophies and all sorts of things. Shades of all the crack riders on the good old ' bone shaker' days ! How your ghosts must rise up and revolt at these so-called sportsmen, ' Honor and glory' is nothing with these folks, trophies and cash are all they want. Gainsay it, as one will, sport is more genuine when cou ducted under tho principle of the Olympian Games than under tho prosent style, when a rider cries out in 'protest when he is asked to take part in a test race for nothing for the pur poso of selecting the three best men to represent his club in a champion ship race. Cyclists aro beginning to train vigorously for tho several, forth coming meetings in October, and tho track now presents a very ani mated appearance each evening. \ ' Bunning's attempt to break the record on Thursday night was a fiasco, on account of the pacing machines being out of order. , It seems strange that Bunuing had not seen about the condition of the machines prior to the event. ?
