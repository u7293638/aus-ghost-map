I'OBT A11TDUB CONVICT*, ' To the. Editor of the Advertiser. SIR.—My attention has been called to this, in consequence of the motion now before the house for returns of names, and numbers, and characters of the men, who have been liberated from that penal station for some time pa6t, my object is not otic uf morbid inquisitiveness, or prying curiosity— hut one of real practical utility, some honorable members may enjov as a rich treat, the gloating over records of crime and degradation, they may possibly prefer a perusal of the Newgate calender, to any monil essays, or formal homilies, or, with the whining cant of hypocritical mock morality, sound the alarm note of danger to aflright hysterical ladies and inexperienced and unsuspecting old gentlemen, with the ghosts of bushranger, at.d despemdoca of every conceivable shade and description, (but a truee to badinage), at the present time we are locking in every direction for the means of constructing roads, "tramways are suggested, lines surveyed and elaborately reported upon," and the Government is modestly asked for the sum of £5(1,000 for the purpose of carrying into effect these undertakings now, I would respectfully suggest the propriety pf taking the advantage offered, hy availing our- selves of thcJahor of these men, and I am prepared to show, that this can be done, without the slightest danger to the people, and moreover with benefit to ihc coiany f 6/id at the same time, with the greatest amount of good to the men themselves—amongst the 500 men now under sentence at that puna! pfation, is it for a moment to be supposed, tliat the majority are so entirely denuded of nil moral fa-ling ond 6elf respect," as to be placed beyond the pale of sympathy and christian condolence, no" God forbid that such should be the case," There arc many men among the ber who might he entrusted amongst us under ** proper surveillance," to labor iu road making, or any other employment which may contribute to the public good, or assist in relieving the u loekcd up land owners" hy opening up roads in •arious parts of the colony ; it is monstrous to think of the available lahor which we thus refuse to uvail ourselves of, by keeping many hundreds of such men living in a stale of romiwrative idleness, maimainid at a very great expense, and liarrassed with the compulsory observance of rigorous rules aud regulations of convict discipline, and whose state would if jt were not that the Civil Commandant is both a gentleman and a philanthropist be unfortunately worse Many, very many of there Hum h«ve lived amoncst us", have worshipped with us. have knelt beside us, when supplicating for that forgiveness of trespasses which we forgive others, these men- would be driven to desperation only that their apparently helpless nnd hopeless condition is in a measure alleviated hy the kindliness and consideration of the Civil Commandant. The wives and children of these men arc living amongst us, they form a por/Jinnent portion of our working population, 1 would not wish to l>e finpiwscj the apologist of rrimc. or even of criminals of any kind or degree. But 7 do think, and fee] convinced, that it would be far better, that the real character of the great majority of these men should lie thoroughly known and understood by the settlers at large, so that there may be no mis?nr.ci:ption on the subject, or mUumleratanding in the mattor, I have often been struck with astonishinunt at the reproachful. angry, and malicious tone in which published letters, anil leading articles have been point til to these men, each alike regardless uf truth and candour, nnd each reflecting indiscriminately up>in the vhnh? numW, without any exccp'i'inal distinctimu, nnd holding up to reprobation the whole population of (hat j>cnal establishment, ns being totally unfitted for indulgence of any kind; and na dangerous to be trusted in our midst, in fact, every coneeivahle term of odium j hac l>ecn heaped u]>on them, and applied to llipm, without any even, the Vast, dilTervnrc or classiflcflfjon, <i manifi-st p-fatin/r and fcorehing injustice which cannot lie commented on in terms of sufficiently fctnmg rcprelienainn, the simple fact is, that when sfriffvd fit thin iruthlesg declamation, there arc three-fifths of the men who are undergoing sentences of various periods, who Mould hoar comparison with vast numbers, who now work nnd live in our towns and cities without exciting Ihc alarm, or even drawing down any sufip'cioft. I should therefore without the slightest hesitation ^'co^lmcnd that the M'lection bejudiciously made, and that all who may he considered eligible by conduct and character, should bo at once drafted upon the htnd, and employed under proper eupervisiun, in road making, to assist in opening up the land, and in supplying that great want of tlie settlers in the interior of the colony, in repairing and improving the roads already in UfrP, many of which are almost impassable quagmires, and a perfect burlesque u|ton road making. I have from some time past thought seriously upon the matter, and have no hesitation in affirming, that such a course wonld possess a three-fold advantage. In the fir*t instance to the men themselves it would lie a priceless boon, in varying the dull monotonous joniine of life, lielng spent in compulsory labor of inutility, it would likewise give additional value to the lands in the immediate h•entity of these improvements, and wlmt is above and beyond all is this, it would almost immediately confer inestimable benefit upon our struggling set tiers, who are literally shut out of a market, for want of proper and convenient roads. Yours truly, J.U
