THE HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE DEBATE. Mr Glynn has made a slashing though somewhat illogical attack on Household Sufferage and the Commissioner of Pablic Works replied in his smart dashing style to the eloquent Irishman. The new member for Mount Barker fired off his maiden speech this week. He is a good speaker, kindly spirited, but very pronounced, though very illogical, a weakness in form that will banish under criticism because he has plenty of ability. The Hon. J. H. Gordon has thus far made by far the cleverest and moft diplomatic speech in either House a liberal of liberals he styles himself, and then proceeds to correct the impulsiveness of the Liberal Party, as a parent would treat his child. Mr Gordon's statements will catch on immensely in the country. There is not a ghost of chance for the Premier to carry Household Suffrage, and the Country Party which holds the key to the position, ought to negotiate with the council for a reduction of the Franchise and if the latter continues obdurate, then let them in a manly way put the question to their constituents. Such a compromise my political friends assure me is possible, and it is better for the Liberal Party to accept a substantial slice of reform than to run their heads against a stone wall and simply get concussion of the brain.
