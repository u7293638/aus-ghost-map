Ilnullv able to contain himself for excitement, Walter blurted out the obvious question, but Zohrab shook his head said ' I do not know their names," he said "I have told you all that was reported to me The two ladies victo saved from the floating wreckage by some of our fishermen, and by my orders were lodged in the g laden ning They want for nothing, and the apartments me the best in the Prince " "Well, at any rate, you may describe them, or, better still, take me to see them at once,' cried Walter, seizing his cap Hut Jiolnnb made no movement, beyond nervously drumming the edge of the bill hall table with his fingers ' I cannot describe them, I have not seen them," he replied haltingly Not seen two ladies brought to your house after being shipwrecked ten days ago'" eNclnimed Walter, in astonishment ' No, I promised Hussein before he went to England that I would see no bumpers during his absence, was the last ordinary reply 'Believe me, Iii Ljnilen, on this occasion I was sorely tempted to break my promise cause, and I have done everything possible to insure the comfort of the Indies," added Zohrab, Raising his eyes in piteous appeal to Wallet's face "You and your precious Hussein are beyond me," baal W alter angrily And then, as a sudden thought occurred to him, he put the question, "But why were not the ladies sent to Bombay when vom yacht the railway, went to fetch Hussein If the vessel could take the rumour of their safety she could have taken the ladies themselves " Zohrab made an appealing gesture with his hands "I wish to goodness I hadn't told you that I had an English education and English blood in my louis," he almost w used, "then you wouldn't have thought all of mc It would have been accounted for by my being a beastly rigged,' as I daresay you are thinking me just the same. The fact is, I couldn't let these ladies, or any other Europeans for the matter of that go away from Jogote till Hussein had been con- suited " "But my good man," ened Walter, sinking all idea of sultanate and sovereignty in connection with this trembling, hesitating giant, "Hussein doesn't rule the uni I case, and if he did, held soon find himself in hot water if he tried to detain British subjects against then will Where is the garden wing of yours, anyhow' Hussein 01 no Hussein, I must see these ladies at once "You had fiends possibly relatives on the wrecked ship, and think that the ladies may be the) '" ' The girl I hoped to some day make my wife was on board with her mother Now, if there's really a drop of white blood in you, take me to them and end my suspense " said Walter roughly "You don't look like a cruel chap," he added more gently, seeing how the other was agitated for Scheib had buried his face in his hands, and was shaking all over as with an ague " This is intolerable' You shall have your wish if I can answer douse Hit mine," he said, removing his hands, and looking at Walter with frightened, hunted eyes "You shall have John wish, if it costs me every thing that I possess, but it is not such a simple matter as you deem it" I 'Hussein again'' cold Walter scorn I firmly Yes Hussein again," replied Zohrab glancing with apprehension at the doom iv I pledge you my word to continue so that you shall see the levelled passengers, but you must really bear with me while I finish the explanation which Hussein inter tempted before It will show you in what debentures I am placed, and perhaps, by scenting for mc your sympathy, will enable me to gun join purpose more readily than if you treated me as an enemy " "Go on, then," asked Walter, or we shall have the snaky devil back again ' ' There is the chance, but I don't think he will return jet,' replied shrub with the ghost of a smile "1 lime played a little pink on him, you see That was a bogus message which took him off just now, and it will entail a visit to the steamer at the place where you landed This statement, no less than the manner in which it was made, convinced Wallet of his host's genuine desire to confide in him, and thinking that he should best help the rescued passenger, to my nothing of himself, by being posted in the mysteries of Jogoic, he swung himself on to the edge of the billiard table, and bade the other proceed Haís encouraged Zohrab relapsed into the schoolboy stinginess, which came quaintly from the lips of one of his majestic appeal ance "I don't mind confessing that I'm in -a mortal funk of Hussein Ah," he began the fellow excuses some queer sort of influence over me, which I feel rather than understand, and he and his have been so useful to nil family and to myself that I don't know that I should care to break with him, even if I could His grand father served my grandfather, his father was to my father pretty much what he is to me, and he himself well, I'm a help less kind of creature, Mr Linden, in money matters, and he looks after my business of fairs for me a jolly sight better than I could in self " "You are puzzled in finding a place like this in a supposed desolate island in the Maldives Well, my grandfather he was an Englishman, you will remember, who married a native-was a bit of a punch in his way, I expect At any rate, he amassed enormous wealth, which he had good I reasons for not going home to spend so he settled in Tagore and built himself this palace, calling himself Sultan and taking a -tianomincuiin ii am But what about the real Sultan of the group, who bus on the principal island, and is a t ulm tan of the British Golem mine si ed Walls My grandfather was a into old file and got round that (shingle) in. a very simple way) stud Zohrab This island, as you doubtless sun when you in mci], is in Du middle of a lagoon, surrounded by a car cular reef It was easy enough to produce a few theatrical claims on that outer of, which ltd the inhabitants of the other is lands and atolls to believe this out to be haunted the fiction has been kept up ever since it is one of Hussein s duties now - with the result that none of the Making witness would set foot on the plans for any In the any ordinary man could offer them Suite in occupation no 1 appears have been here eights, and the island shares the reputation of the other for poverty and wretchedness and there is nothing to tempt Hit trades The passage, loo, in the outer reef is in) hard to find and naughty, though 1 have no doubt it would soon be found in any ] European captain find an object m visiting here Unfor tunnel) that is not the case ' ' Then personally yon don't care about this solitary existence' said Walter in some Biirpiibt 11 loathe and detest it," Zohrab replied bitter!) ' Where is the fun in being shut up here, actually a prisoner, in splendid isolation, when my every Instinct is of life in European cities and for association with my fellow men?
