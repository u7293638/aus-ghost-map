LONDON BOHEMIA. There is not now, I fanoy, any Bohemia in London — none snch as I remember in the days when Warrington's friend Titinarsh was itill at work, and when en one .occasion it chanced to see him steal into Fleet-street tavern, go as quietly as if it were Johnson's ghost to the old fashioned box wherein the Dootor is said to have dined and talked many an afternoon, and sit there musing on Piozzis and Bozzys and things over a little blaok bottle of port. (A penny for his thoughts in that deep spell of rumination would have been a good bargain, I weened.) 1 ; . Bohemia, in whioh this tavern then stood, was a fair land if a strange, and ne snch Aleatia as was imagined by the neighbour ing country of Clapham. M . Besides, it was no land of sojourn, i They who were drawn thither made the tour, came forth, threw off the loose asp of travel, and donned the smooth and shining tile of civilisation and order. Yonng men who afterwards became placed artists, or high speotaoled soribss and scholars, or grave judges and counsellors of ths Queen, resorted thither a while, to spend half the. night in — what? Nothing worse than a jovial clamour of wit and olaBh of word— a laughing jail-delivery of thought and spirit and sentiment whioh otherwise . would never have got out, belike. .'But there was the bottle?' Yes, there was the bottle — no denying it ; and pipes and punchbowls : bnt no more harm " was done by them, I believe, than at the respeo- taoie club ot our great moralist and lexico grapher. — Frederick Greenwood.
