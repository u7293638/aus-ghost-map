An Electric Pig. In front of a butcher's shop in St. Paul, a half pig, nicely prepared aud of appetising appearance, was hanging on a hook a few days ago. A dog came running up the street, and happening to see the little pig, went up to it, and longingly sniffed round it. Hardly had he put his nose on the pig when ho uttered a cry of pain and ran howling away. A sccond cur soon appeared and fared no better j he 'ran away howling as if a ghost had laid its hand on him. Gradually, as a third and fourth dog had shared the same fate, a crowd gathered, aud everyone looked with distrust at the porker. One of the shop men who wanted to find out the causc of the trouble, at last went up to the pig, touched it, and also ilew back as if a tarantula had stung him ; he had re ceived an electric shock. An investi gation proved that an electric light wire had come in contact with the hook on which the meat hung, and thus the pig was completely filled with electricity. â€” ? Exchange.
