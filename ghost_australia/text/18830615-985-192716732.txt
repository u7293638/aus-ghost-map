Mow a Man Acts when Me Upsets j an Inkstand, I A man may be as cool as an icicle under extraordinary circumstances of danger or excitement; he may preserve an .even mind when a ghost comes into his room j at midnight; he may assume command and act nobly and well when tbe ahip is sinking : but let that man, let any man, upset his inkstand, and he springs to his feet, makes a desperate grasp for the ink stand, and knoclrn it half way across the table, claws after his papers, and swoops them through the sable puddle to save them, tears his white sQk handkerchief from his pocket and mops up the ink ; with it, and after he has smeared the ' table, his hands, and his lavender trou sers with ink, as far as it could be made to go, discovers that early in the engage ment he knocked the inkstand clear off the table, and it has been draining its life-ink away all that time in the cen tre of the only light figure in the pat tern of-the carpet. Then he wonders why a man always makes a fool of himself when he upsets a bottle of ink. He doesn't know why. Nobody knows why. j But every time it is so. If you don'tI believe it. try it. â€”The Burlington Hawk
