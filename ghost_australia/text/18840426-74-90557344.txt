' A shipment of draught stock arrived at Melboirne onApril 16 (says the Argus) by the steamship Essex, froni London. The number shipped on beard was 10, but this was reduced by three shortly after leaving England. The cause was attributable, it _is said, to the very .stormy weather which 'prevailed. "The horses, it is supposed, Scaught cold, and inflammation ensued and carried thein 'ff. The shipment'comprises four entires and three mares. They have been brought out by Mr. Power, a well known importer.. The horses comprise Brown Boxer, a brown Lincoli. entire, rising 5 years, and his number in the stud book is 2,404; Montrose,' a, bay Clydesdale entire, rising 5 years,'No. 2,293 in the stud book; Lord Lorne, a brown ;Clydesdale, rising 3 years; pedigree intheo'th voluine; and Brown Champion, a brown Lincoln, rising 2 years.

All the highest priced lots in four " sales rep?orted' 'are "by inmported ",Ducehes'' kibulls, as Colonel 'Gunter's Duke of-Treguiter 8th 'and Earl Bbetivo's Dtske of TUnderley' 5th. But so lthiat the siret b-of 'thefavourite' strain, the' Aus. tralia'n "ulik2 e the 'English buyer-seems indiffeient'teo the pedigree of the' dams.

In; the ,Wonwondah district, Victoria, some of. the farmers are '(says a con temporary) : using .. a. new.; implement for'.preparing the' soil, which is likely to, supearsde therplough. It is, patented, as, "Gillenan's ..Cultivator," 'and it will pulverise the ground: more thoroughly than the plough, and turn ove' six acres per da ay..'' The.Nw Zealand farmers are exporting cheeso:sto England.. Mr. John Bruce, says the Akaroa Mail, sent home some cheese per. s. Doric -last October. It arrived 'in England in excellent condition,. and reia-. lised 6d.per lb. As the expenses, in con sequence of :its going as general cargo, were only 14d or.2d per lb., Mr. 'Bruce will net more than 4d per lb:: This is certainly worthy of- public attention.. As most of our' readers know, the calm belt in ,the tropics between the trade winds is only some. 800 miles, and, this being the case. the steamers are only a short time in that' warm locality which is so detrimental ,to cheese. The question is therefore opened. whether cheese cannot be sent home, now that steam communication is established, in perfect safety; and, if so, of course the expense of sending per cool chamber is very materially diminished.
