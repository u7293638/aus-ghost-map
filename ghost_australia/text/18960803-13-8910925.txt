Professor Ren , souls recent addresses on Anglo Catholic ism Canon Potter took as his text I Acts I, E' S, cJnlil the day in which He was received up after that He had given commandment unto the apostles xv bom He had chosen to whom He also showed himself ohv c after His Ashton b) mine) proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the Kingdom of God He said the Kingdom of God, as even student of the New Testament knows, I means the Church of Jesus Christ and every student of the New Testament 1 news I also that Christ gave His apostles commission to found His church on cult, and to provide for its government and extension And we learn in a) text that also during the progress of the great forty tia s to give them commandment, by the Holy Ghost and instructed them concerning the M or 16 which He had given them to do And so throughout all the ages, we have to look back to apostolic institutions and apostolic [doctrine is we find them in the records of the apostolic tune And we have to keep them intact, not only as a sacred possession, but as the basis of all our efforts for the extension and development and reform of the church the power of reform from within is a distinctive mark of the Church of Jesus Christ She does not sink under the false growths which by their usual increase desire) other organised command tics She works them out of her constitution and sh to cs them off And why Because of the gift of the spirit which Christ gave to dwell with His church for ever That spirit took the words and the history and the character and the works of the A! intel and enshrined them in those at perishable documents which we call the New Testament and of which the church is the deepest and the witness And there the) form the ideal which she li is to strive > after and the model which she has to work to and then when too port on cou option I falls upon her, as the) often line when the indwelling sun it calls his bid to the contemplation of bet ideal and model Mic discovers what she had in part forgot ten and so she desires he would, not alter J rub the original design, not living a new foundation, as she would have to do if his ideal were short of the 'ugliest, of it but model were faulty not adding a stone to it, out king a stone from it not altering a single meal of archill ive, of will or I window, only removing the accumulated rubbish that had shut out the light or obscured the fair proportions of the building that is the test of time reforms tion The student of elim cb Pastor j 1 news that the process of formation is nearly as old as the church itself and is going on still And lie distinguishes line li on false reform by this test the false reformer is also r)s living to ] till down the original framework of part of it the true reformer while he labours to clear away) ill accumulated rubbish, seriously presents the origin of framework and for evidence of what the original fi network is he goes and to the words and works of Christ, and the words and works of His apostles, who likened His commission and examined and instructions for the building and main tenance and extension of His church be von see when the profess ii of theology m Ormond College tells us that in the Kcfoi mation of the sixteenth century Hine was a rediscovery of Christ I am with him there In so far is that it information was true reform union it was a n discovery of Christ-not the best by any means 1 ship pose that St Paul himself was about the earliest reformer When the church suffered xx line Bishop Moor house calls The C claim lapse, when it began to be col i opted by Jewish of adition St Paul re discovered Christ and reformed the church And when the Holy ] schist begin to be corrupted by attempts itofestivities St Pull rediscovered Christ preached the true nature and origin of the Holy) S manient, mil reformed the church St Ath chasms found grapnels and bishops dun ing the etc) only of Christ s Divinity, and he too, is discovered Christ as One with the Father and in the beginning with God and so he too informed the church The great poet of the middle ages Drake also do discovered Christ for he declined mile is mee of main temporal and spiritual 1 tentacles that Christ s 1 modern, us China himself declared was not of this world So he too was a true reformer And in the sixteenth century so many con options had accumulate 1 both of doe time out of practice among clergy and people from the highest to the lowest that there was a loud cry for a refund of the church than ever before a cry that had been growing for centuries louder and louder and now reached its height And in the nest he lit of ] tinting and the translation of the Bible into (the modem Jangttiecs helped on the work of reform be in ii ing possible I would exhibition of Clu ist s life and slim refer and so making a rediscovery of Christ more general So far I am wild Dr Rentoul Rut nden be lumps together with de o ills the prm epics of the Reformation as if they need it new consistent w both of t neil coherent system I part company with him. During the gale itieligiuiiH revolution of tliesixteentii century then were all sorts of movements of anning to be Reforms and covering the most c tunic differences in doctrine and in morris Ide Ormond professor surely does t wish us to commit intellectual and spiritual suicide by sw allowing all this mcdill of contra diction post positions in the lump we must rest (him in compiling them with the original framework of Christ and His apostles We must refer the name of life in to am mon ment which sets aside am (led meet institution of this When we find some of utters deliver its setting Inside the sm minutes of C hi ist s own appointment can live all -right one a true reformer' When we find another care less setting aside an apostolic practice, must we not say that in so for its he does that he is no time reformer Above all, if we find a teacher suing us Luther Bud, "A baptised Christians cannot lose situation In sins how great soever unless he will not believe for no sins can damn a man exceptions unbelief" Surely we know that he is the true reformer If a man t talks like that he does t know even with dilution means, he has forgotten the Gospel ' J'boil shall call! His name Jesus for it is He that shall save His people from their sins' (S Muir, J 21) 'To talk of a loan having sin and salvation of the h nee lune is a bins pierrots absurdities is central as to the vote of Jesus, exception report as shall in his suave polish" is Lui came 11 It is contrary to the words of St Peter in every nation he that faith Cold and worldly Righteousness is acceptable to Him" ( Acts x 1.) It is contrary to the words of St Paul, "the needs of sin is death" (Romans, vi 2..) And sure enough such that long bore the only fruit it could be Hallam's 11 s Hut "Mining and Ixiiinpcrdolhnr with the whole 1 bible of Anabaptist fanatics was the beginning brood of Luther s early doors ino" And he goes on to su, "Even if he sold these Hide it is certain that he had no test months to no) reform of manners in Ide countries flint embraced it " Hallam goes on to say that this is confined In some dim anguished Latin inn arrives, and he refers especially to one of ivbomliesns I heard ness he bears to the dishonest men dissolute manners which had accompanied heart to decision of Liitliernnisin is not to be lightly regarded considering the lespidnlnhti of (de viz tor and his now 11 cooperation with the first reform ' Now all these doctrines of Luther to he included in the panels of the Rcfmmitton from which one of the Church of England are Hard to June departed If so the case must be we have never departed from them,beeniise thank God neither he Id them And I must add, in answer to Dr Rentoul That I am well assured that he doesn't hold then (sober I know, of course that it would not be fun to hold a whole continent respon aside for the wild savings of one of its members even if he be such an intellectual giant as Luther certainly not but Hnlhin treats the doctrine of moral) as n pi is late opinion of bullion, but as part of the Lutheran religion Resides Dr Fenton] is fell too learned n theologian not to know very well That Lutherans and Jerningham, Cnlv mind and Annminns were in direct (other on vital dod lines of Christianity S" then fill 11 he till s of the pi maples of the Reformation and the revolt from them, de certainly needs to explain himself What 111 temples does he mean, and what a former home He speaks of Luther, single, and Cnlv 111 as if they were sworn allies, all working in harmony for the same holy pi pass but what was the fact "> Let us ask Dr Renton] s own chosen witness, Hallam Hilliam say that " it is more than insinuated 111 numerous messages of Luther's writings that the imaginary as well its the 11 whole church of Rome, and the Annhnptists, were shut out by their tenets five events will petition Zinnglmns, Calimists.nnd Lutherans freely denounced one another Let me quote Hallam again He is speaking of the to miles of lost ground by the Roman party, and he says -"We ought to reckon among the principal causes of this change those perpetual disputes, those indecency able animosities Hint bigots 1, above till, mid person ruling spirit which vict c Indited in the Itutkera-cuiid Culu.s 1c church.-. And yet in the face of all this life doctor actually says that "in that great only re formation day all the Protestant churches of the continent and the British Isles were very near a large Christian unity" 1 Surely this is to the last degree " prehistoric Sure]), also, it is absolutely meaningless to talk of most against the principles of people who lived in a state of perpetual dispute" and iiiceoncdablc animosity and who were moved against one another by a bigoted and persecuting spirit Why, you might as well try and make a bond of union out of the principles of the Kilkenny) cats It is not possible for me to suppose that Dr. Rentoul is ignorant of all this, not yet that he thinks is ignorant of it, nor yet, further that even if the does, he would stoop to take advantage of such is norance I can only suppose that all this about Zuinglc, Luther, and Clun, and their unit) is merely a flight of rhetoric, m inch is not intended to contribute any to his argument And let us charitably) suppose that he means to speak of the pain armies of the English Reform mahon only, and of a supposed revolt from those very) well, then, taking him in that sense, let us look at his charge the last point of it can cents The ministry of the church, and the doctor confines himself mainly to this point in his first lecture this is what he says \- ' Anglo Catholics argue that diocesan bishops, as descendants of the apostles, are necessary to the valid ministry of s sets merits, or existence of God's church " Here he misunderstands facts a little, so that we must make two 01 three alterations before we can accept what he says as a correct statement of the Anglican position. The cost reasons, however, are not serious, and w ill not essentially alter his probable meaning We must lent out the world "316 cases " Missionary bishops are quite sufficient for a valid ministry His apostles themselves, except in a few cases, and for a short period, do not seem to have occupied what we can call a choses in position Also, we must come out She Motel existence We all admit that every good in in belongs to the soul if not to the body of the church, and we all believe in the existence" of the soul even if it at present lack The in strumentality of the body Again, to ensure exactness, for God's Church " we must put Christ s Church because there was a Church of God with a valid ministry before the Church of Christ came into existence I accept Dr Renton! a statement of our position, then, in tins form " Anglo Catholics argue that bishops as successors of the apostles are necessary to the v xbd minister) and Sacraments of Christ's Church " Dr Rentoul teaches, however, Hut the English reformers never held any such notion And he quotes different pu vite opinions to prove that they dicbl t Well, then, if they didn't how comes it that they put it in the preface to the Ot dinal ' To put it there they surely did Here me the words of the preface exactly quoted, I am sorry to say) incorrectly by) the doctor - ' It is evident unto all men diligently residing the Holy Scripture and ancient authors that from the apostles time there have been these orders of ministers in Christ s church Stalin) s priests and the cons And therefore to the intent that these orders may be continued and river at) iMccmcd and used in the Church of I England no man will be accounted or taken to 11 ii i ful Inshore 1 nest or di seen or suffered hue nip ii I, of the said functions except little effect as I re mained and admitted thereunto according to the form elicit after following, or 1 stir 1 in formerly episcopal contention or order -lion Whether pi iv ate opinions any reformer held, Mine you have the explosion of the cost porte mind of the Church of England through the whole progress of its reform lion 'There have been bishops priests, and deacons in Christ Church from the days of the apostles And no one in the Church of England shall be permitted to execute any of these functions unless he be done consent ttion five bishops of oldina lion from a bishop Hut Dr Fenton] says In the English Reformers nliiiiLtt.il that the Press) learns churches of Gummy and Scotland, and Switzerland were fine upon the churches in In didn't they put Hill belief into their authority five documents Did the Church of England ever mile or admit 1 bishop without episcopal order lion' And, as for guests Dr Rentoul! makes a great deal of the tie that it here and there i Pmit m noble, even in 1 Ii-mIjcIIih time, in five unlawfully Hurst into the priest s office a man not hills has returned He might just as well Inn added the fact But Clonmel filled nearly all the above races of the church with Congregationalists or he might is well hue figures flinn til it the fact which he begins to give you that I Presbyter in Parliament cut off in the bishop Land's bond Christ Ins printed His church to stilled poseidon sometimes and perhaps He may or must it again, and it must be admitted that chin eli pure events were persecutors is well is Pitsbv j Gunn paid hument s But it is a sober li and I to make the spoiling of our goods by others j an argument against this the Church of England is not responsible fell nts Mut 1 w ci e forced upon her against her will He Rentoul says Hut John Knox was offered a bishopric AA evil, Knox was i how fully told lined prest life July and if he had in expects a bishop! he would have been lives of bills consent used , As for the Canons of Canterbury thence p i tor does not give us the charge to verify the quotation He says it is expie sb deal (in ed in Hiern Hut the C him in if Scot I find, as much is the Churches of J natural and Ireland was an integral part of the true Catholic Chin eli of Our ist I and be glad of the doctor not tell us where in the Colony of Cmtct but this is to be found Can it be that mg of the thirtieth onion' If so he has Church misunderstood it the thirtieth canon says that ' so far is it from the purpose of the (murder of Hugh and to horses and reject the chin dies of Italy, 1 ance Sjnm (Germany 01 and such like churches in all Hunts which they held and pi leased that as the Apology of the C.
