I GOVERNMENT STOREKEEPER'S DEPARTMENT. I Te ITis TZtiitaf mf Th TTevrnJA Sir, â€” As you aro no doubt desirous of hear ing both sides of ihe question, permit mo as ono of tho morcantilo publio to say that amoneit mon of husincis tho Govcrnm-nt atore department is looked upon as " a farce," end Mr M'Oulloch deserves tlio greatest ' praioo for putting an end to it. Whatever " Justico" may say to tho contrary, the stores department ia a hoavy cxponso to tho country, without any equivalent being got in return. Tho storekeeper is evory day imposed upon 1 from his ignoranco uf goods and materials, ond , tho h'ghost price ia paid for the worst article, i The conduct of tho dopartmont is, moreover, 1 characterised by great superciliousness, and I for ono think Mr M'Culloch deserves tho | thanks of the publio for taking measuros to i abolish this dopartmont, and in seeking to apply to tlio regulation and management of the : stores required by the Government tbo samo principles that aro found to provail in well j regulated morcautilo establishments. I am, ! Sir, your obedient servant, MERCHANT. Melbourne, lot Juno, 18G4.
