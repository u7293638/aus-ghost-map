THE LATEST AMERICAN (Pall Mall Gazette.) WONDER. The city of St. Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been thrown into a state of great excitement, and not without just cause. It seems from the account given in the New York Herald that an elderly lady lately died in a house on Broadway, in that place. On the 20th ult., the day after the funeral, a lady who happened to"be visiting one of the tenants of the same house accidentally turned her eyes upwards, and distinctly saw the figure of the deceased lady at the attic window. In great consternation she communicated the circumstance to the other occupants of the building, and in a short time the entire neighbourhood was made acquainted with the interesting fact, and with their own eyes witnessed the phenomenon. Various means were tried to expunge the photograph of the ghost from the glass, but all in vain ; and at last, owing to the crowds that assembled, it was found necessary to remove the sash. Dr. William D. Lamb, an eminent physician, subsequently obtained permission to remove the sash to his office in Essex Street, where it has been examined by" intelligent and scientific men," 6ome of whom are of opinion that the departed must have been photographed upon the window pane by the action of lightning when sitting in the room before her death. It is a most uncomfortable story, and it is to be hoped that the intelligent and scientific men will not leave the window , sash alone until they have thoroughly sifted the mystery.
