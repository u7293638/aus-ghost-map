Intercolonial Mining News in Brief. (Compiled from Our Exchanges.) NEW SOUTH WALES. Tin and Copper.—Tin is quoted at 15s. 6d. per unit, copper £62 per ton. Barrier Ranges.—The ore exports from Broken Hill for the week ended 10th March were: Proprietary mine, 605 tons bullion, value £29,078; British, 812 tons ore, value £4288; North, 24 tons, £128; Central, 169 tons, £1491; Australian Broken Hill consols, 1 ton, £560; Pinnacle consols, 18 tons, £117; and Pinnacle Tribute, 26 tons, £260. Follow ing are the smelting reports for the week ended 18th March: Broken Hill Proprietary mine, ore treated 8185 tons, yielding 599 tons of bullion, containing 140,3940z. of silver; Block 14, ore 765 tons, bullion 210 tons, silver 13,6480z.; British Blocks, ore 689 tons, bullion 158 tons, silver 14,8060z. The Lewis Ponds Mines.—The manager re ports : During the past week 208 tons of ore raised, and 104£ tons of ore were smelted, pro ducing 2768J0a. silver, 17Joz. gold, and 5 tons lead. And of the new Lewis Ponds G. and S. M. Oompany tho manager reports: For the week 143 tons 2owt. lqr. ore and 58 tons 17cwt. lqr. roasted matte smelted, producing 7 tons 3cwt. 2qr. bullion, containing 14370z. silver and 520z. Bdwt. gold. Also 24 tons matte, contain ing 1090oz. Bilver and 7oz. lOdwt. gold. Star of the East Gold Mine. —The crushings for the fortnight were 1405 tons of stone — namely, 762 tons from Guiding Star Lode, yielding 4670z. lGdwt. 12gr.; G43 tons from Star Lode for 5240z. 17dwt., and have obtained from copper plate scaling 730z. 19dwt. 6gr. Total bar gold, IOOGoz. 12dwt 18_r. I Albury.—A report from Dart River states th at Conroy, Polmear, and Co. have obtained Io4os. of gold from 35 tons of stone. This was got out by three men in two months; fully one-third of the total quantity of stone was merely mullock. Hiflgrove.—Baker's Creek obtained 19205. from 190 tons. Manager expects to strike rich reef any moment. Carcoar.—The prospectors at Wide Gully cut a vein about 2ft. from the surface, and about Bin. thick, carrying good gold. A prospect was tried without crushing, proving that payable stone having a grand appearance i3 being opened out. f.t is hard to state whether the find is extensive or not. It is on private pro perty. At the Burragga copper mine there are now five smelting furnaces in full swing. Victobi-. Ballarat.—The output for the week was not quite so good as that of the previous week, in spite of the excellent retorting of 10660z. from Star of the East, but the aggregate is good enough to warrant the presumption that the quarter's returns will equal those of the Decem ber quarter. The Plateau mines are all with out any material change, and the fine yield from Star of the East and the excellent promise of the mine in all the stopes have given a rise to the stook without inducing sales for some days, so well are the shares held. In Ballarat East the producing mines maintain their re turns. Sulieman Pasha and the mines to the south are in moderately good fettle. The Buninyong Estate crushing was a failure, only 470z. from 800 tons, but there is plenty of stone for further testing, The Egerton mines are as usual, only that Blaok Horse has to get some oountry out of the way before cutting into the lode at the lower level. The Clones mines are without material change. Alluvial mines are also as usual, save that Smeaton Reaerve has given up the ghost; the bank is in posses sion, and the pump lifts are being drawn. There is plenty of wash, as there is in Hepburn Estate, but it did not pay. Principal yields : Berry Consols, 4170z.; Earl of Beaconsfield, 180oz.; Lord Harry, 620z.; Midas, 105oz.; Madame Berry, 6990z.; Saxon Consols, 5205. Fortnight: Britannia United, 819oz.; Llan beris, 870z.; Star of the East, 10660z.; Sulie man Pasha, 178os. Dividends: Black Horse United, Ss. Sandhurst.--Matters in the share market do not show muoh briskness, but there is a little more disposition for business, and there is ample reason for it. The gold returns on Saturday reached 540005., whioh is the largest return for any week for very many months, excepting Christmas week, when there is a special oleaning-up. Apart from this there is a still more important reason. The official gold returns, as issued by the local sub- treasurer, show that this year's returns are considerably in advance of those for any similar period since 1885\. The position is shown by the following list of yields for the first two months of each year since:— It will be noticed that the returns for last month show an increase of over GOOOoz., whether compared with the previous month or with the corresponding month last year. The March month is also in a fair way to show a substantial increase. As regards the week's news the most satisfactory item is the excellent yield from the 2025ft. level in the New Chum Railway, where 267 tons gave no less than 3660z. 19dwt. gold. A Is. dividend will be de clared on Saturday next, the amount being £1844 10s. Another very satisfactory feature is the magnificent return of 800oz. from the Johnson's Gold Mines. The Rose of Denmark yield shows a marked improvement. The Specimen Hill and United Hustler's and Redan had good yields and each a 6d. dividend. The United Devon Tributors have again a very good yield. The Fortuna Hustler's see good gold at 320ft. in tho north level. Prinoipal yields: Catherine United, 2460z; Confidence, 690z.; Eureka, 140oz.; Frederick the Great, 560z.; Great Extended Hustler's 2930z.; Gar den Gully United, 660z.; Great Northern, lOfioz.; Johnson's Gold Mines, 800oz.; Lazarus, 2760z.; Lazarus No. 1,1630z.; New Chum Con solidated, 2280z.; New Chum Railway, 860oz.; New Chum United, 1520z.; North Johnson's, 117oz.; private mines, 3500z.; Rose of Den mark, 191oz.; Shenandoah, 1430z.; South Devonshire, 88oz.; South New Moon, 760z.; Shamrock 186oz.; Specimen Hill, 2610z.; St. Mungo, 630z.; United Devonshire, 2990z.; United Hustler's and Redan, 2070z. Dividends: Specimen Hill, Cd., £1000; United Hustler's and Redan, 6d.; £1072 19s. od.; total, £2072 19s. 6d. Maryborough.—Principal yields for the week: Napier Freehold, 2850z.; New Kong Meng, 168oz.; Chalk's Freehold, 107oz. For the fort night : Duke, 1740z.; Working Miners, Home bush, 2250z. SotTTH AtJSTBALTA. International Mining Exhibition.—A deputa tion cf mining men have asked the Com missioner for Crown Lands to appoint Mr. Rose warn, Inspector of Mines, ae representa tive of South Australia at the forthcoming In ternational Mincialogical Exhibition at the Crystal Palace. Mr. Burgoyne said the Go vernment recognised the necessity of South Australia being represented, and most pro bably Mr. Rosewarn would bo appointed. Alico Springs.—ln the .Central Australian Goldfields, the Wheal Fortune has struck the lode in the tunnel 90ft. from the surface. It carries good gold. A good alluvial patch has been struck in Kangaroo Gully, at Paddy's Hole. The Round Hill crushing is not com pleted. Rain is still wanted on the field, but good water is in the vicinity. The Junction Reef shaft is down 40ft., and the lode is hold ing. Western Australia. The latest news from Southern Cross states that a plentiful supply of condensed water is obtainable at 7d. per gallon. No rain had fallen up to 25th February. Tho Government are taking steps for the conservation of water at Southern Crons. The Government geologist Month. 1686\. 1887. lsvmtio^is tt,6-)'-)£46 1888\. 1889. 11,7X5! O.OM 18,687, !!>»() 1890.

With regard to the former he points out a number of defects in the crushing plant, but speaks in extremely favourable language of the quality ot the stone. He says that if the shareholders are prepared to go to farther expense the mine will be a success. The Central was not crushing when he was there, and was wait ing for fre9h water, but every preparation was being made to have everything in readiness. Respecting the prospects of the alluvial finds, he expects that some rich deposits will be found when the regulations with regard to leases are so altered as to admit of prospecting on them. The latest telegram from Roebourne states that 1200oz. alluvial has been taken from the new find at Nullagine in seven weeks. There are about 500 men on the field and everything is doing fairly well. Provisions are very scarce. The latest from Milligan reports excellent finds of alluvial. One man got 150oz. from a cartload of washdirt obtained at a depth Of 27ft. Tasmania. Tin.—The export of tin for the month of February last from Lannceston was 237 tons Iscwt, valued at £21,530, as against 381 tons lOcwt., valued at £35,881, in February, 1889. Gold.—Last month 83360z. lOdwt. of gold, valued at £12,601, was exported from Laun oeston, as against 36000z. 15dwt., valued at «13,600, in February, 1889. Silver.—A shareholder in the Talune Pro ipeoting Association, residing at the west coast, and who has just returned from a visit to Mount Dundas, writes:—"One of the most important discoveries yet made on Mount Dundas, and one which goes to prove the value of the new locality as a silver-bearing one, was made by the prospectors of the Talune Prospecting Association, a Zeehan and Remine oompany. The find is galena, a formation of about 4ft. wide, carrying three seams of ore, each about lOin. wide on surface. It has been cut in three places, about three chains apart. Assays as follows: Large grain (No. 1), 38oz. Bilver, 70 per cent lead; No. 2, 370z. 6dwt. silver, 69 per cent lead. Small grain, 490z. 16dwt. lgr. Bilver, 70 per cent lead. The com pany have obtained two 80-acre blocks on line of lode." New Zealand. A cablegram from Auckland on Wednesday week states that in consequenoe of favourable reports received from Preservation Inlet num bers of miners are proceeding there ; 4cwt. of sand yielded 80gr. of gold. Mr. Barr, who is acting on behalf of a Sydney syndicate, has in spected, in oompany with Professor Blaok, of Dunedin, the Pegasus tinfield at Stewart Island. It is understood the report iB of a favourable character. The •• Pollock" process of gold extraction, a new system of chlorination under, hydraulic pressure, is likely to be soon tried practically in Australia. It has been tested with great success on samples from Queensland, the Transvaal, India, Chili, Dakota, New Zealand, Bpain, Turkey, Brazil, and Guiana; the highest success (100 per cent) being in Queensland and North America; the lowest (78 per cent) being in Colombia ore, from South America. Char ters Towers ore yielded 100 per cent, while the highly refractory mixtures of metal from the Mariner's reef at Eilkivan, and from Ravens wood, gave 85 per cent and 90 per oent respec tively, of their full assay, under this process.
