CHURCH OF ENGLAND CON . VENTION. The annual convention of members of the Church of England was comroenoed on Tuesday afternoon at St. Matthew's schoolroom, Prahran. The Yen, Archdeacon Langley presided, and there was a very large congregation. The object of the convention is for the deepening of apiribuui me, Â»nu tno suojcct to tie ueaic wica during the convention is Pentecostal Life, or Life in the power of tho Spirit. The Bishop of Melbourne delivered the open ing address, in which he dealt with the spiritual life before and after Pentecost. He considered it was not too muoh to say that the written Word of God was a dead letter unless the spirit of God was given to see the true meaning of it. Many people read it as if -it were any common book, through failing to lift up their hearts for the spirit of God to help them. In speaking of mission work, tho Bishop said that people were too apt to devote all their prayers to one mau whom they thought had a special mission, and he could not help thinking that it was discouraging to the parochial minister, nad ho would ask them to pray more for God's spirit in tho minister of the parish. With regard to this the Bishop related an aneedote of an old clergyman who roceived a letter from a young clerical brother, who said that his peoplo were cold and heartless, and ho wanted te effect a religious revival amongst theui. Woll, you know what would be said in 1895. "Bring so aud so. You must bring him, and it will be all right" But the answsrof tho aged clergyman was "Brother, revive thyself." In conclusion, he said that the object of tho con vention was to instil in them the feeling that in their troubles and difficulties and sorrows the Holy Ghost was with them. Addresses and bible'readings'dea!ing with the same subject were given during tho afternoon and evening by the Revs. S. C. Kont, H. Collier aud W. T. C. Starrs, M.A.
