WEDDING RINGS. Of all the ornaments with which vanity, [?] and affection have decorated the human form, few (says the Edinburgh Scotsman) have more curious bUaaf lrirrtor^ thsnthefi-ger-tiiig. From tha ?*___rt times the ring has been a CsTorite omameoi, and its popularity most be in a large meat-are das to Its oon ventence. The uses of the finger-ring have been many and diverse. Originally purely for ornament, tt became a signet for kings snd a war rant for their messengers; to civil officers It pas an emblem of office, and to ecdea-_?Ucs an indispensable portion of tha epfa_ _—! costume. It waa once warn byphyaidan- to prevent contagion, and by patients to c-~' disease ; the timorous won ft ss a dv_ ~* against evil spirits, sad tha ambitious el__ gto it as a talis man, gtvincthe wearer over bia enemies. Bet as a love-_ten, snd a symbol of marriage, the nse of the ring Is so general, and of so long standing, w to dwarf Into Insignificance ite empk-ym'—ft in all other direction— At what period it came into play as a recognised factor In the marriage cere mony it Is impossible to say. Tha He-rears used U In veiy e__y ages, and probably borrowed the eastern from the Egyptians, among whom the wedding ring was known. In the Boat, where the popular estimate of a woo—— is low, the use of the wedding ring hss not been common, though occa sionally the favorite wife of an Oriental monarch would receive from her master a ring as a mark of his favor. The co_cl__on, therefore, Is safe that, with increase of respect far the Instltation of marriage, came also incressed respect for snd nse of the ring ss a token of the alliance. Dozing a part of the middle agea tbb respect showed itself in a . peculiar way, cuatom demanding that the wedding ring shookl cost as modi as the bridegroom could afford to pay; and there are records in Germany and France, daring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, of many largo investmontoi made In this direction by grooms eager to c_tcQisto their brides snd be in fashion. The revolsfcn aude the ring what we have now, a plain gold drd et, though by a compromise the ring may be aa oostly ss fancy dictates or meana penait. The materials of which wedding rings have been composed are as diverse as the nations which have oasd the ring. The British Mnsenm has rings of bone and of hsrd wood, found lathe Swiss lakes. On oae of the bone rings is tcaosd a heart, giving an tjioaiiwi reason to believe that the ring was a pledge of affection, If nota nodding ring.

Four rings could not keep Maty Stuart faithful to Dsroley; and tits anaols of Eeropean .-.-..-rim, i_.'miiil iw_yln_aafi—. ?fi^.CTf t bath as to the rings and to tiie result. The Greek Church uses two rings, one of gold, tbe other of sflver; while in aoooe dis tricts of Spain and Portugal three rings are placed, one at a time, on the fingers ot the bride, as tiie words "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" ore pro-oooced. Fashion haa slso determined not only the style of the wedding- ring, bat the finger on which it is to be worn, and so capriciously hss custom varied that tiie symbol of matrimony has travelled from the thumb to the fourth finger, where it now reposes. In the time of Elizabeth it was customary, both in England and on the Continent, for ladies to wear rings on tiie thumb, and several of her rings now shown in the British Museum, from their size moat have been thumb rings. An English work on etiquette, published in 1732, soys It is for the bride to choose on which finger tiie wedding ring shall be placed. It further states that some prefer the thumb, since tt Is the strongest and moat important member cf tiie hand; others, the index finger, because at its base lies the mount of Jupiter, indicating the noble aspirations; others, the middle finger, because it is tiie longest of the four; and others, again, the fourth finger, because a " vein proceeds from it to the heart." The "British Apollo," how ever, decides the proper place for the ring to be the foarth finger, not becaaae it Is nearer the heart than the others, bat be cause on it the ring is less liable to Injury. The aame authority prefers tiie left hand to the right The right hand is the emblem of authority, the left of submis eiuo, and the position of the ring on the left hand of the bride Indicates her subjec tion to her husband. A curious excep tion to the rule placing the ring on the left band is, however, aeen in tiie atage of the Greek Church, which puts tiie ring on the right band. As tiie symbol of matrimony,.it is not strange that many of the auperatltioua fandes which have arisen in connection with the wedding should cluster abaut the ring. Dreaming on a bit of wedding cake b common among young ladies, bot they should be informed that, for the -dreaming to be properly done, the piece of cake thus brought into service should be passed through the wedding ring. The Russiaa peaasntey not only invest the cake with wonderful qualities by touch ing it with the ring used In the cere mony, bot deem that water In which the rings have been dipped has certain curious beneficial properties. In parts of Ireland there la a current belief that a ring of gold must be used, aad jewellers hi the country towns not infre quentiy hire gold rings to peasants, to be returned after tiie ceremony. Blessing the ring gives it no small share of sanctity, and old missals contain ex plidt directions ss to the *--m???r In which this ceremony must be carried out. In the church service as performed ln the villages of England the ring is frequently placed in the missal, the practice being, no doubt, a relic of tiie blessing once thought indispensable. TheGermanpeasant women continue to wear the wedding ring of the first husband, even after a second marri age, and a recent book of German^ travels mentions a peasant wearing at one time the wedding rings of four " late lamen ted-" An instance is known of a woman of German birth, who, after the death of her husband in a western state, had the misfortune to lose her ring. She at once bought another, had it blessed, and wore it Instead of the. former, deeming it un lucky to be without a wedding ring. Among the same dass of people stealing a wedding ring Is thought to bring evil on the thief, while breaking the emblem of marriage Is a Bure sign of speedy death to one or both, of the contracting parties. 5\. ia anticipated that the _iisety now being St—fcr&l; by the Ba?sian troops will hasten the _eten__atiou as to whether there will bs peaoe or war.

What a pleasant relief, tha-fore, moat it have been at a recent gather ingof Mr. Leake's constituents at Radcliffa, in England, to listen to tiie following rhyming epistle from Sir Wilfrid Lawsoa:— My dear Mr. Leake, I would cheerfully apeak, Whoe'er I ooald doeo for yoa; Bat so many demands Still come to my hands That really—now, what can I do?
