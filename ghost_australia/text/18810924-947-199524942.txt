\- -,j-p(Jlea^& 8k^teaeao; . N ; AloanproIwithe dbAdT/ A good many yean ago, the regiment to which I then belonged was quartered at Aldorahott. After a long absence from England, spent on a patching rock in the middle of the Red Sea, bleak and dreary. Aldorshott seemed a very ' paradiao. ; It was delightfully near London too : leave was easily, to be obtained ; and a great part of my spare time, and more than, all my spaye money, was spent by mo in the ? metropolis— spent, I am ashamed to con ;fes3,'in:riofcous living and much disorder. Still,; had it only; been, that, I should, possibly, like many of my brother-officers, at the cost of much subsequent, pain, and weariness, . and pinching, have passed through ' my , cycle of dissipation, and settled, .down at last .; but, in addition to my youthful aberrations, I had a fatal predilection for games of skill and chance. ? 'X-Vaa the best whist-player in the 'regi ment, and could hold my own with .the: crack .players of the clubs,;, and had I; stuck to whist, which, in my belief, never! ruined any man who had a; head upon his; shoulders,. I could have made a decent iri-' come out of my skill ;, but my moderate winnings at/whist were swallowed up, and miich more lost besides, at unlimited' loo, '? blind hookey, hazard, and other kindred; games. To crown all, I took to backing; horses, and lost at that,, 1 need hardly' say. A long run of evil luck beset me ; I had lost all my available funds, had mortgaged my commission to the utmost penny I could raise upon it, and found myself, at the end of the Epsom week, fevered and parched in . body, in soul wretched and despairing. I had come to the end ; of 'my .tether ; I was regularly dono up; life had nothing but evil in store for me. On the following week, I should be. posted as a defaulter on; the turf ; I should leave the army in disgrace :'. and bucU tidings would kill my old widowed mother. ....,,? ... . . j; It was Sunday night; I had; been in London, trying to raise money, .but . use lessly ; the Jews closed their fiats to me. I only wanted a hundred pounds to pay my Derby losses, ; this achieved, T. could sell out, and retire without ppendisgraoe; but I oouldn't raise it; ?

It was popularly known' amongst.' us .as 'the ?': Cold-meat Train. . Its passengers were dead 'bodies for the Woking Cemetery. . The railway company, ever solicitous to accommodate the .'public and turn . an -honest penny, had, ? for the convenience of the camp;; affixed to this train one first-class carriage. After leaving the dead'bodies at Woking, the carriage was run on to Farnborough, whence' you could walk to the; camp, if youhad not been prudent enough to order a flv to meet vou. ??''? ? : The hotel servant who ushered me to the cab got a handsome gratuity for his pains. It was my leave-taking of the world of pleasure, and I was too insolvent to be careful about little matters. The cab sped' me quickly to the station ; but the clock at the hotel had; been Blow ; as we- passed under the railway arch, a premonitory shriek from the engine over head warned me that the train was on the point of starting. I stopped the cab at the bridge, and ran quickly up a narrow flight of steps which led directly on to the end of the platform— known only to the initiated ; the train was moving on, but I had just time, despite warning shouts of guard and porters, to open the door of the last carriage and j ump in. The other compartments of the carriage I noticed were lighted, but this one was dark ; that didn't aftect me, I didn't want to read. I took out a box of wax matches, and proceeded to light a cigar. As the glow of the match lit up the interior of the carriage, I saw in the corner a long dark object, quite black, and yet with some little metallic gleam about it : it was a coffin, reared up at the farther side of the carriage, a board being placed behind it, against which it leaned. As^ I looked- - steadfastly 'at tho coffin,; it Appeared- sud- I : ideiily to ; glow witK 'j a j faint;', radiance. I v:Eyery hail and every plate Upon . it be gan to gleam with' strange', mysterious ighii. ; Bah' ! it was the moon, i We, had '?jastleft the clouds of London behind us, and the great round moon, rising out of river- mists, cast her glorious beams right :athwart us. But I turned away from .her in disgust. What was the beauty of the night to me— a ruined, spendthrift — the scorn and laughing-stock of the world! The blaqk coffin on the other side was a more congenial companion to me. I lit another matchy and read the inscription on the plate :. 'William Heathcote, died 25th May, 18— ', aged 25 years.' , ; i '- The hair on my head , rose in a mass,;; 'my heart coaaed to beat. ,My ownname, : my own age, and the very .. date ,,of thei day that was now just, born. ! ? : ?' - ? It.chimed in too, , did this inscription, ; so mysteriously with. that impulse X had; felt the whole day— a turning to selfdes truotion, aa a means of escape- from all the degradations of life. ; I would accept; the omen. I carried with me, a practice I had acquired- in the East, a small American revolver, which, fitted into my waistcoat pocket. ,, It would kill at twenty pacesi and would give me my mittimus easily enough. , I'drew it o'nt, and plaoed it. '? 'againat my forehead ; then Jit .struck* me that,,,, the ;,,J)all, after pas-, sijjig through my head, might pass ajso through the partition dividing: the cpmpartment, and strike some one in the 'next carriage. 1; turned, therefore, my; back to the window, and again placed the muzzle of the pistol to.-. : my , forehead. Again I withdrew it. There was no hurry.' The train did not atop till it 'reached Woking. I could not possibly; be disturbed.- I., wanted ,, a signal-: the, : whistle of the engine, aa the driver; sighted the red lamps of Woking, should be the signal for my departure from the world. ? .. , .. ...,-.', . .,..;,.,... ,.: ?:; ,..?.-;, ;.?;? ; ,. ..'Yes,'.
