THE SUMMER EXHIBITIONS. GROSVENOR AND NEW GALLERIES. (FROM A LONDON CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, MAY 24. We all Iook for Mr Briton Rivière at both the Grosvenor and the Academy, and we are disappointed this year His best work bas been given to Burlington bouse, but his "Prometheus," at the Grosvenor, is a re markable picture, though rather in the con- ception than in the carrying out It strikes one as being on too small a scale for the Bub ject, which shows us the tortured litan hang- ing over the edge of a precipitous rock rising sheer from the sea The dark water, the muss of cliffs, the moonlit light-we do not see the moon, but the gleam is gbastlv mid cold-the suspended figure, eo much more helpless and wretched looking than the ordi miry representations of Prometheus writhing under the pressure ot his realistic chains, and the heavy, black looming figure of the " vulture " (which ia uti eagle, I think), replete and asleep, are very impressive, but not quite tragic, as the picture ought to be. _ he colour- ing is that of all Mr. Briton Rivieres moonlit scenes , he sees moonlight in its weird aspect, and I think be Bees it nright It is curious to contrast his mind and method willi those of Mr Boughton, who nlso gives us a moonlit picture 'i be latter shows us a plump, well fed, happ), rustic maiden, who stands in an easy altitude-I think there is an air of expectation in it-under the harvest moon Serene, and as nearl) warm as it may be to be truthful, ia the moonlight that softl) pervades this bit of peace ful poetry I shall have to speak of Mr Swan when I ask your readers to accompany me to the Rojal Academy, bat I must pause here, too, to comment on his picture called " The Fallen Monarch." I do not like the subject, the lion is a noble beast, and the comparison of bim, dead, with a living dog, to his disadvantage, is so familiar and painful that one never likes to baie him represented in a position that emphasises it Mr Swan pleases the artist better than he pleases the visitors to the gallery, theformerappreciatethe correct draw tug and fine colour of the poor dead lion, with bis leet tied aud bis head stuck stillly over the edge ot tne rocky ledge on which he has been deposited after his despatch by the Bpear of a Zulu, but the latter do not cara for the stiff creature, with its mere resem- blance toa " carcase,' being taken to market, it is somehow humiliating to their sense of the dignity of the king of beasts borne of the critics discern in Mr Beadle a great military painter of the future, such as Edouard Détaille is in I rancc His picture, called "'Hie Queen s Guard, ' is a very good one , he shows us a squadron of Life Guards, in their crimson cloaks, against a back ground of snow. One does not care much for the cflect, but it is skilfully produced, and the horses and uniforms are admirably painted. I have now to refer to the portraits gene rally, and to those by Mr Shannon in par ticular. Sir John Millais's portrait of Mr Wertheimer is a bold, strong work, very like the original, very realistic in its uncompro raising rendering of the details of a florid kind of costume devoid ot the least retine ment, and a good specimen of the artist's rapid workmanship Mr Togadail seems to think that be who paints fierce pictures should himself be fierce, for he baa made lue portrait of Mr. Frederick Villiers, with whose admirable illustrations of war and kindred topics your readers are as familiar as ourselves, to bristle with mill ' tarism. Miss Ethel Mortlock is improving in colour and substance lier portruit oí Ad mimi Inglefield is satisfactory I have seen much better work of Mr i'ettie s than he ex- hibits this year , his portrait of Mr Rider Haggard is preposterous i he likeness is correct, and perhaps we ought not to blame the artist lor giving us the successful author, in a fine fren_y ot contemplation, with a pair of china bice eyes uplifted und fixed in a manner which munt have been rather tning to their owner while silting for this portrait 1 he placing of an impossible landscape by -I r Reid, one ni which the artist seems to have sought lor the most noient contrasts within the range ot colour, next to Sir John Millais s portrait of Mr Wertheimer, and the hanging of Mr R Barrett Browning's portrait of his father m a corner and above the line-in fact "Bkymg" it-are the only two con- spicuous blunders m the hanging I like the portrait ot Mr. Browning ver) much, although it is perhaps too large And a little too heavy. The expression of tho illustrious poet's face is perfectly given-the frank kindliness, the genial simplicity, and the reserve of wisdom aud strength in it atnke the observer just as the) do when he is study ing the living man I bave frequently heard it said of Mr. Browning by persons seeing lum for the first time, " He is very common place for a poet," It would be well for the world if, indeed, such a countenance were "commonplace," and for poets if affectation were no longer the badge of all their tribe. A large picture by Mr Jacomb Hood, which occupies a conspicuous place, is also, I am told, a portrait, although the fair subject docs not reveal her name 'I he picture is named " Pauline in the Lady of L)ona, ' and shows us the deluded bnJe ascending the stairs, with a parting word and wave ot the hand to the mendacious Molnotte Hie picture is too glaring , it ia one of those which will improve under the mellowing influence of time 'X he composition is excel lent, lind the texture of the golden yellow ureas, anti the gauz) e.rey »carl thnt Hunts about it is exquisitely rendered Hie bupp), prosperous looking lady who wears these adornments is anything but a sentimental Pauline, Among the smaller portraits are two pencil drawings by the Mar cbioness of Granby, ntl amateur who is beginning to be talked of One is a likeness of Miss Dallas Yorke, the other is a likeness ot Mr. Balfour Hie) are "pro mising"-a safe, if a vague, admission-but they are too smooth and keepsake-y Mr Stuart Wortley is evidently the fashion, but his portraits ure either prettily feeble, and what Irish and Devonshire folk call "footey," or they are distinctly vulgar—mere exposi- tions of fine clothes I come » ith pleasure to the works of Mr Shannon, who is also an exhibitor at the New Gallery, and, I lear, is falling into the mistake which Mr iioll made of undertaking too much under the tempting pressure of his Budden success Of the three portraits the Mar chioness of Granby, Mrs Towers, and Miss Jean Graham I like the lutter best, although it is a slighter work thun either ot the others Mr. Shannons characteristics are grace, delicacy, and taste, as the handmaids ol re semblance, in which he excels i he Mar chioness of Grunby is very tall, far too elender, und has a back \\\ Inch must make ber the delight of her dressmakers, but which is also a snare, for the ntcessit) of exhibiting ita perfection without turning it upon the spectator lins obliged the painter to place the lady in a painfully uti IT and angular attitude, with her head turned abruptly our, and to tho edge of her Bhoultler, and her arms, sadly deficient in roundness, held m straight lines down to the undeinnblv »harp elbows Her lace ib long and thin, the features are fine, and the hair ¡B profUBo and beautiful, the expression is of the aisthetic or woebegone kind Hie general effect of the picture is rather interest ing than pleasing, but tho execution is intiBterl) , the painting ot tho white satin dress, the lace, and other accessories is worthy of the great da)s ot old, be- cause, though perfectly rendered, these things uro ohtruBiio or overpowering to tho personality of tho portrait Mrs Towers is a very different subject, her llbure is full and commanding, her fac- ts oxpressive of health and animation, her attitude is rather soli assertive-to say the least it is grandly secure , wealth and pro- sperity breathe I rom the cain iib |but )et it ia not wcnlth and prosperity expressed as Sir John Millais expresses thom, with a loud boastfuluess, but just asan atmosphere. The lady's dluphnnous dress is groy, her dainty Bhoos are grey, a boa of rich " blue " (gre« ) lox fur rests upon bershoulders, the tones nre dehghtfull) modulated, the picture is a charm- ing one It is not, however, so entirely plea- sant to look -cou as Mr. Shannon'« portrait of . the sweet and lovely Misa Jean Graham. As | a work of art this is not faultless ) the flgrue wants weight from the waist down, the limbs are not moulded underneath the soft graceful grey draperies One doubts whether the young lady could stand if the pillar »Kamst which she lenna were snddenly with- drawn, but the head and face, the form, bo far as it ia really painted , the «pression, full of sweetness without one touch of affec- tation, of sell possession without self con- sciousness, form a combination rarely seen either in life or in portraiture. To my mind this is Mr. Shannon's loveliest work. At the rival gallery, the "New," there is no picture which can vie with Mr Sargent's extravagant "Lady Marbeth," in unlikeness to everything that ib done by other artists, and it is not desirable that there should be. Mr. Sargent's picture ia a tour de foi ce of drawing and colour on an almost colossal scale , his reproduction of the anachronistic, indeed impossible, robes which cumber Miss Ellen lorry in her eccentric performance of Lady Macbeth, is marvellous The artist has made tier gorgeously, but hideously, ugly ; the widespread mouth, corpse like complexion, blood-red lips, and pearl braided twists of coarsely red hair, are all as un- attractive as possible, it is only the attitude, with the crown raised high in the curved hands above the tortured face, that has charm and dignity m it, It bas pathos, too, but Mr. Sargent has been too judicious to give it a touch of tragedy, to have done so would have spoiled his picture, for Miss Ellen Terry cannot reach to tragedy. Mr Burne Jones is not represented, but we Und a very curious anti interesting picture by his ardent imitator, Mr. Strudwick, tv ho is gifted with a more devotional mind " The llamparts of God's House" is somewhat of a purzle, but it is well worth putting together, I bo line is the imagery, and so beautuul are I the details. The lover who has scaled the ramparts of that celestial dwelling is, I think, he who sees the Blessed Daraozel as she leans " on tho gold bar of Heaven," in that long waiting for him, and she is receiving him with the unimngin able and awful joy of that reunion , but ere they moy even feel that they are together for ever and for ever, she has to lead lum to the feet of the Queen of Heaven. The concep tion is wonderfully quaint, thi> drawing strange to a degree, the gorgeously attired, golden and silver winged angels, the hand maids of the Virgin, and her attendant knights, aro heures which it would take hours to study, and the colouring is of an astonishing and intricate beauty. The pic ture-also a poem-is one of those which ib appreciated and enjoyed immensely, or liked not at all, according to the taste and temperament of the beholder. In his peculiar style Mr. Strudwick is now un- rivalled I wish I could convey to your readers any of the pleasure, almost amount- ing to excitement, with which one contem- plóles Mr, Kennedy's superb "Neptune." This work occupies the place of honour in the north room. It contrasts bo finely with the too numerous, tame and commonplace portraits and the conventional subjects, so wearisome even when well painted, that it affects one strongly with its wild power, its grandeur of conception, and the irresistible rush of the sea, which is its chief " note " The canvas is very large, and it is full of the sea, a vast mountainous wave, which mingles with the breezy sky, and breaks into a sheet of racing, I dancing, opaline foam, bears on its glittering J green uollow the forras of Neptune, Amphi tnte, and their son, sitting on two sea monsters, which rush and tear through the ! tremendous mass of waters with force and animation ijuite amazingly portrayed The composition of the picture is as simple as it ib bold, and to the highest degree poetical Neptune is not the grim and bearded potentate Burrounded by a shoal of gambolling marine courtiers with whom we are familiar, but the young sea god 01 Keats, and the whole con- ception is that ot youth, love, the boundless ecstasy ot power, Ireedom, enjoyment, the state ot the " immortal gods " The sea monster on which Neptune is astride lilts its huge head and seems to snort and shriek with delight as he plunges through the waves i he uprenred figure of Neptune, young, Blender, with a keen face and long black hair, which streams in the breeza as he toases aloft his trident sceptre and the foam flakes fly past him, is superb, and the grouping of the ligures ia moBt poetical The plunging coursers of the deep are Bide by side, the careless happy boy Bits ve îtb fearless ease just behind the head ot that ridden by Amphitnte, and the left arm of Neptune is stretched out, the hand passing under the loosened locks of the Sea GoddeBS, and caught in her upturned right hand Her lower limbs are just washed by the seething wuveB, her head is Blightly thrown bael, upon the locked bauds behind it, and ¡n her proud beautiful face, lifted to the salted breeze, there is a fearless exultation, and | an abounding fulncBs of lite, of which the painter may be proud without stint, Mr l'oynter's "Music, Heavenly Maid," ib a " learned " work, but not in the least like St, Cecilia, as one imagines the beautiful and holy interpreter ot the music of the spheres Mr Alma Tademn ia well represented, although we look lu vain tor Miriety ot subjects in his work Ot course we have a Human scene and l'ugan women T lie room is beautiful, us usual, the lloor is nell marble mosaic, tltrciugh the open bronze work window-shutters we see the lnvan able combination of blue skj and blue sea in which Mr Alma Tiulemu delights mid excels 'Die occupants of this charming room are two handsome Koraati girls ot the usual type, m the customary gracefully idle attitudes, who are reading from a roll The finish aud composition of tho picture leave nothing to be desired , but I think the world begins to be iiweury ot these themes Among the public, as well as among the critics, I und u growing longing for something new-so-and so's "manner," such-an one's "style," the model faces well known to us nil-these things ure too much with us on the walls of all the galleries. Mr Alma Tadema's por- traits of Mrs, Frank Millet and Señor Diuz do Soria aro very Une A marked featiue of the New Gallery exhibi- tion ib us examples of Mr, Wntts'a unrivalled ort. Of these it has eight, most ot them old Irienda, all the more precious for that, aud Borne oí them undeniably eccentric. Among the hitter is "A Togolf Corsica," which shows iib nothing at all, there ia simply a sheet of mist, but just beyond it ia " Hie Sea Ghost," and in that the very Burne fog (lor even a fog has features in a great artist's work, if we do but look for them) is dispersing, to reveal n elup in full sail ThiB is nu exquisite picture To Bit opposite taltarni let the mist move off ii Itally, and the ship grow more and more distinct na its gliding motion makes itself felt, is a delightful experience. Close to this beautiful picture is one which has an exceptional interest, it ib rt 1 he Wounded Heron," the first picture exhibited by Mr. Watts at the Hoyal Academy just 62 yeara ago The heron, with its ex- tended wing, is in the foreground The hawk lina probably beenrccalled by its master, who ia riding away over the hill into tho miBty dis tance The soft, perfect nniah of the bird's plumnge, the pitiful expression of ita help- less Bullering, ure bcuutie«) of art which one joyfully recognises, but one wonders that Mr Watts should have chosen such a painful subject even then This picture, which had been missing for several years, has only re- cently been recovered. "Good Luck to Your fishing," also a work of old date, is a gem Over the deep blue summer sea utnid the golden sunlight, a lovely, healthy, chubby cupid is poised on his many tinted wings, which uphold lum iii the light pierced air. 1 do not care so much for "'The Wife of Plutus, ' though it is a masterly work. Mr Watts is best in the elegant, the heroic, or the pathetic , the gorgeousness of wealth, its sensualism and its selfishness, all per fectly conveyed by the figure of the magni- ficent woman who lies upon crimson pillows, are things too mean for his touch. I believe the "Fata Morgana,' a work which I had already seen, is considered to be the finest of Mr. Watts's paintings in this exhibition I heard it praised in no measured terms at tho press view, and I hardly venture to suy that, to me, it seeems scarcely ideal enough loi the allegory of that ever desired object which " tempts and yet flies." A splendid warrior. most martial of form and magnificent of address, strives to clasp the beautiful, elusive form of a fair maiden, who leads him a wild and trultlesa chase The nobility and purity of the picture are striking, but, to my mind, it does not tell its atory as the artist's other allegorical works tell theirs There ara Borne beautiful landscapes, but I must not linger over them. Among these works "Gay Morning," by Mr Alfred East, and "The Wet West Wind," by Mr Adrian Stokes, are the most remarkable The first is a quiet picture of exquisite things, a few slender trees in the early summer, and the early morning, a meadow still in Its pale green time, a delicious, sk) reiltcting alream. a vision of pence, calm, beauty, the sunny side of nature, which one would fain carry away and live with The second is by far the finest picture the artist-who has long ceased to be "promising, and now holds a secure place among the leading land scape painters ot our time -has exe- cuted It shows us a bold hills de under a wet wind swept, blustery sky, all towzled and tossed, but with lo« ely gleams in it We feel the weather in this picture, the storm blown rain comes up the cleft in the hillBtde, and the wet wind rattles the wool ot the sheep huddling under a Bcarp amid the Bcant herbage for the shetler that is not to be had 'Hie details, the variety of the animals, the towzled wool, the timid sheep, who are overcome by their distressful state, the bolder ones who raise their heads and sniff the wind, the vegetation, the whole feeling and expression are truly admirable and delightful to observe, especially when one has Hatched the progress of the artist for long)ears ^^^^^^^^^^^
