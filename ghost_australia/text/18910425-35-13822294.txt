The book purports to give some ghost stories told by a party of convicts after supper, but although there are not wanting touches of this clever writer's humour in the book, the sketches themselves are feeble. From Cassell and Company we have received a copy of a new edition of The Journal of Marie Bash himself," by Mathilde Blind boroo interest attaches just now to the book owing to the charges recently made that liberties were taken by the French editor with the original diary, the sign of its subject altered, and some of its contents over-coloured. that report has since been denied, however, and the matter now rests in that unsatisfactory stage. " Wormwood, a Drama of Paris," by Marie Corelli (Bentley, London), is a strongly coloured story of a phase of Parisian life which will probably strike the reader as exaggerated and unnatural, although there are not wanting evidences of power on the part of the writer, who has written other more interesting and less preposterous stories.
