LITERATURE. AUSTRALIAN SONGS AND POEMS.* Poetry, according to Carlyle, is the attempt which man makes to render his existence harmonious, the utmost he can do for that end; it springs therefore from his own feelings, opinions, activity, and takes its character from these. In fact it may be called the music of his whole manner of being. Impressed with the force of the philosopher’s deﬁnition, we have seldom taken up a book of verse without entertaining a hope of ﬁnding something pure and beautiful within. But it is not often that we meet with a collection of poems containing verses so pleasantly fulﬁlling friendly desire, and yet on the whole so ill able to bear the brunt of criticism, as the book before us. It is beautifully printed, neatly bound, but badly edited; and altogether, it is one of those productions that a cynical reviewer delights to pounce upon. A man, in short, with a spice of ill‐nature in him, would be apt to praise the printer, sympathise with the publisher, and condemn the poet; but believing that all criticism should be considerate, we have no intention of proceeding to that length. Nevertheless, for Mr. Wilson’s sake, and in justice to the poetic sensibility which he really does possess, we are bound to point out his shortcomings, both in sentiments and syntax. To begin, then, we open these 𝐴𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛 𝑃𝑜𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑠 at random, and ﬁnd ourselves at the concluding stanza of a lyric, headed “Arakoon”:— “One by one the sunny sparkles 𝑏𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑢𝑝 𝑜𝑓 ℎ𝑜𝑝𝑒, Flash upon its ruddy surface like the light on yonder slope! Darting with a 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑣𝑖𝑔𝑜𝑢𝑟 into 𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑒’𝑠 𝑣𝑎𝑠𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒; Where the dross of vice lies festering, where the gems of beauty shine. For since man ﬁrst drank of sorrow, pleasure shares the world with pain; Breezes mingle with the tempest, sunshine follows after rain: Even tears of weeping darkness form the gems that grace the leaf; 𝐴𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑤 𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑟𝑜𝑤 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑓. This unique verse is one of six stanzas evidently intended to be descriptive of a mountain in New South Wales; and we may fairly assume that the words in italics are part of “the moral tagged to the tale.” But we put it to Mr. Wilson, is there any meaning in them? How can the “cup of hope” contain a “vast treasure mine,” in which “the dross of vice lies festering,” &c.; And what about the “fearless vigour” of “sunny sparkles?” As to the description of “Arakoon,” the mountain referred to, we can do no better than quote three or four lines of it:— “But thy peak with seer‐like warning ever points to realms above, Teaching with a voiceless fervour 𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒: Sitting in thy matchless sorrow with a tearless look of grief, 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ 𝑡ℎ𝑦 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑠, and spurning all the world beneath.” Fancy a grand old mountain being apostrophised in this manner! But Mr. Wilson is even more unhappy when he attempts to paint a sea picture. Here is one, by no means the worst of the series:— “Softly 𝑚𝑜𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑑 the 𝑠𝑜𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 waters, ’Neath Australia’s rock‐bound shore, 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑙𝑦 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝑎 𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒‐𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑔, Sleeping nature sailing o’er! Then amid the wave‐worn caverns, 𝑆𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 with a 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑛 𝑟𝑜𝑎𝑟.” Our author is one who clearly prefers sound to sense. He has an exquisite ear (a point greatly in his favour), but not the faintest idea of form and colour. In illustration of his weakness in the latter respects, take the ﬁrst, third, and sixth lines of the above. Is there any analogy between “moaning, sobbing waters” and a gentle “love‐song”? Can “sighing” be consistently compared to a “solemn roar”? We venture to think not. As Mr. Wilson classes the last quotation amongst his “earlier eﬀorts,” it is only fair to him to give a sample from his more mature productions. Here is the ﬁrst couplet of the ﬁrst poem in the book:— “Like the 𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑐𝑒 of a wandering tide that returns to its own loved shore, The 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑠 of memory ﬂood my heart with a dream of the days of yore.” Now, there is nothing in point of resemblance between a “low sweet 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑐𝑒” and 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑠. It is certainly the function of the poet to idealise truth; but, at the same time, truth must be the sole object idealised. A singer with the right stuﬀ in him is never better tested than when he is called upon to paint inanimate nature. Then, reproducing superb combinations of rock, wood, and water, he brings back to us our own partially obliterated impressions of things, clothed in what De Quincey calls “superlative majesty.” But when a man like Mr. Wilson fails to recall these, we must be excused for doubting the divinity of his 𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠. We have already hinted as to the shortcomings in our author’s syntax, and we feel bound to establish our position. We put the following in as evidence:— “Like ﬂuttering birds from their leaf‐hidden nests The pale 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑡ℎ to scatter.” The above is from a lyric headed “Terrara.” Here is an example from “Bondi:”— “Softly 𝑚𝑜𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑡ℎ Bondi’s 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 in their jagged storm‐wrought caves, Cowering from the ardent sunbeams blazoned on the tinctured waves.” But we will not pursue our objections to Mr. Wilson’s work any further. Indeed, if there were no evidence in it that he is a young and promising writer, we should have been inclined to pass it by without notice. As it is, we have written in the hope that he will proﬁt by our criticism. A young author requires as much pruning as a fruit‐tree; and few men are worth anything who cannot stand it. Mr. Wilson’s verse is occasionally singularly vigorous, often pathetic, and always musical. The poems headed respectively, “Old Memories,” and “Lost in are, of their kind, equal to anything yet produced in Australia.

Sydney: Gibbs, Shallard, and Co. Pp. 202. 1870 human skeleton in the bush, we are glad to quote the subjoined aﬀecting stanzas:— “What time the sun its mocking radiance shed; Perhaps he died, those stony ridges climbing. Now a bright creek is tumbling o’er its bed, In heedless ears its music idly chiming! Too late it came, as sweet things often come; As tears that on dead faces fall and glisten— As when long lagging tones of kindness hum Their words to those who never more may listen. How many who have loved and looked in vain O’er wintry ﬁelds, and when the bees were humming, Will watch, and wait, and look, and long again, To hear the old familiar footsteps coming. How many ghost‐like omens, one by one, Will toll their death‐knells for the absent brother; And tears for this, perhaps her only son, Will wet the lashes of his widowed mother.” The third verse of the above is really beautiful. If Mr. Wilson had written more in the same manner, we would have been spared our task of animadversion.
