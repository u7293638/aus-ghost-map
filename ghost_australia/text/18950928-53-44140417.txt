EXTRAORDINARY SCESE TS A. - -f LONDON CaUKCHTABD. . ;. Searching for a Ghost. : AK extraordinary scene was witnessed during the early hours of Wednesday morning in the churchyard of the parish church of St. john, at Hackney, when fully 1000 men and women turned out from their houses in the . . ' neighborhood to hunt for a supposed ghost (an English paper of August 25 says). For sometime people passing through the church- yard late at night have been startled by the appearance of "a ghost." "Women have * fainted with fright, and tho'local newspapers have published accounts of the strange affair. Between 10 and ll o'clock on Tuesday night k :?>. a mixed crowd began to assemble at the rear Of the church, where "the ghost" waa 1 supposed to be, and where in the usual way scarcely anyone passes after about ll o'clock. A long wait until mid nighf, and then, as no ghost appeared, the crowd went in search of it. Armed with lanterns and candles, and carrying sticks and stones,'the crowd climbed the railings ' from the pathways and took possession of ? , the borial ground. Graves and tombstones ' -. were clambered over, and restored mounds were trampled down. A portion of the crowd looked upon the whole affair as a joke, and consequently every few minutes the cry was raised of "There it goes!" and imme- diately the whole crowd rushed in the direc- tion indicated. Others amused themselves by making the night hideous with imitations, of unearthy cries, and although the* police were requisitioned to clear thc place it was not until the verge of daylight that the last few stragglers went away. The damage to ; the graves was very great, and efforts will - 1 be made to pr√©sent any further demonstra- tion. Many complaints were made by those present of having their pockets picked.
