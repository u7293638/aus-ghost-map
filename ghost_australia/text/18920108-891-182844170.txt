Bequiem jEternam. The Old Teae. The ghosts of dead seasons are with us to-night, Of the years that hare fled j And vc hare grown weary and faint in "the.fight. Now the old year has aped. Weary at last of reaping the thorns we have sown, Vzx the harvest is tears; Anfl sow in the waning year xnen>'ry has flown Over bright sunlit years. Far backward when fair resolutions were made, In the dim distant time; Lost in a limitless sea, by evil outweighed, Of another year* rime. Ah me! the dear Inst years thst never come bach, Toe desires that are dead; They gather around like the fierce stormy wrack Of the clouds overhead. The {rood that we pledged to do, aims that were ; set, , "Were forgotten so soon; I And the skein of our live s is uneven as 5 et Like a song out cf tune. Ever our hands stretch up through darkness to light, We may reach it at last; The new year m ay dawn for us blessed and bright, H. E. P. M'Bokali?.
