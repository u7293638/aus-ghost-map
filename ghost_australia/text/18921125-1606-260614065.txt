"HOW SHALL WE DECIDE THIS QUESTION ?" Now, which is the worseâ€”-to have no appetite for your dinner, or to have no dinner for your appetite-/ There aro lots of peoplo on thu one side or tho other of this question. When "good digestion waits ou appetite and health on both." that is the ideal attitude of a person towards his meals. Hut most of us a k e not blessed iu that way ; wo either have too much food without an appetite, or a vigorous appotito without enough to satisfy it. Different folk will answer this question differently, yet the common sense of it is that, within reasonable limits, it is better to have au appetite without a dinner, because, short of the starvation line, a hungry man >s a healthy man ; whereas a man who ought to eat and doesiA feel like eating, stands in need of "alterations and repairs." To illastrato. Wo reccuily received a communication in which the wiiter hays, " 1 was afraid to eat." D ! d he fancy his food was poisoned, or did his nature rebel against the nourishment he lived on? If the latter, why ? Let him clear the mystery himself. He says, " In ti c year 1881) I changed my work fntiu railway porter to sign:ihnan. I had been signalman twelve months, and then all at once, so to speak, 1 did not feel myself. My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to them. One thing was like auother, and none was good. My tongue was coated and furred, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round it. My bieath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and shoulders, which were always right before I had eaten anything. Then I was greatly troubled with wind. It would gather so it felt like a ball in my throat, qnd act as if it would choke me." We cannot wonder that under these circumstances our friend failed to do justice to his meals. He adds that there was what he calls a " pricking sensation" at his heart, as though it were touched with some sharp instrument. Then, again, at times he was attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the sweat,rolled .off him. "I dreaded," he says, the thought of eating, and many a scanty meal have I made, for I was afraid to eat." "After a time I got into a low, weak, nervous condition, and felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this caused me to lose a good deal of sleep." What he means by the fear of " something going to happen " is, of course, the fear of some calamity, such as the loss of his position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to him. This was due, as he intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain enfeebled by lack of nourishment. The night of this form of illness is always full of ghosts and goblins, the creatures of a restless and ungoverned imagination. w With gieat ditTcul y," he says, " I stuck to my work' for I had a wife and family de pending on me. So I struggled on, but what 1 Buffered for over two years is past my powers of description. I am sure no one has suffered so much as I have done." In the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is one's own, and is always harder to bear than is one's notion of his neighbors pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while going through tho same wretched experience,' only we dont happen to come in touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medicartreatment had left him where it found him he chanced to :read in a book of a case exactly like his own having 'been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup. " My wife," ho says, " got me a bottle at Mr. Langstaff's, in Woodlesford, and after using its contents the ailment left me and has never returned since that fortunate day. I should like tho whole world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway Company for eleven years. (Signed) GEORGE HUNT, " Carr Bottom Road, Apperley Bridge, near Leeds."
