The Sin of Omission. Itlsn't tho thing yon <lo, doar, It'B tin thing you lenvo undone, Which gives you a bit of luarttclio ' At the sotting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, Tho lettir you did not write, Tho flower you might have sent, dear, Aroyour haunting ghosts to-night. Tho stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, ' Tho bit of heartsome counsel You were hurrie d too much to sny. The loving touch of tho band, dear, Tho gentle find winsome tono That joa had 110 tini3 nor thought for, With troubles enough of yoiu'.own, These littlo aot3 of kindness, , So easily out of mind, {These chances to be angels, Which even mortals find-> . They come in night and silence, JSncli olnll, reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging . And a blight has dropped on faith. For life ia all too short, dear, And sorrow.is all too great To suffor our slow compassion That tarries until too late; And it's not tho thing you do, dear, It's tho thing you loavo'undone, Which gives you tho bitter heartache, At tho editing of the sun. -MARGARET E, SANGSTER,
