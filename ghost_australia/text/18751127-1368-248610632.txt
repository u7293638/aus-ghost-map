MB. PARKES. The following extract is from a private letter which appeared in the Bat-hurst ^jwjfejj^You ||r,ou|in ypupf lativi his fiiS$£ ^filrl^es 'fetft re'5 Bitmedy nTTull vigour his usual out of office work of abusing and misrepresenting the, men in power through an obscure papeR—Fom8rly,~wlreii"liB Was deprived of* ip iad^; ono turn the Ghost, i ^ d M M S ^ ^ V ^ ^ ^ J ^ his accommodation.

Ouo week he has it that most of-the members of the Government intend to take peiinMiont (billets^ and ihat they are io be succeeded, by members of tho GovernmBht/- Next he lias it that the Government are* preparing for a breakup at Christmas, the wish beiug. doubtless. father to the thought. Tho itUocbs on Ministers and their friends ju the Stockwhip are snurl-Uoiis enough in al consq.iencq ; . .but bad as tliey are, they are hot as veuemous and insulting as used to appear about Sutherland and Samuel in the Lictor when tbey were members of a previous Robertson Ministry. Sutherlaitd-.and Samuel have boon colleagues of Pa'rkes since die Gho't and Lictor days, a-:d I am informed that they, have reason to regret, it. Mr. Parkes is again "very hungry for office, and the rumour runs that lie intends to trip-up the Government whenever he has a chance, in the hope of getting back to place and pay, but his prospects are' not blight at present. If M : nistera act only with caution and judgment they will defeat his purposes and keep him at bay as long as the present Parliament lasts. Parkes' little political garnn has been played out. His " high falutm" and lofty pretensions do not accord with his conduct when iu office, and this is the general opinion. In office he gave himself airs, aud out of office Jw hiwj not forgotten thniu. I intend writing you again."
