THE DAY OF THE LORD NEAR. The subject at the Forester's Hall last Sunday night wae, ' The nearness of the Day of the I/3rd,' or the end of proba tionary time, Joel 2 : 1 being the text upon which the speaker, Mr. Colcord, based his remarks. It was stated that we are living in interesting, thrilling and perilous times. Tiie great changes that are taking (-l;ice in social and political affairs, the genera! distress, the state of uncertainty, unrest, and loss of confidence in government i.nd existing institutions, all these are sure signs of the times. Many are lookia^ for some great change some great uphevul or cimimotion to take place soon. Their litarts begin to 'fail them for fear and lor looking after those things which are coining on the earth.' Just before II is ascension Christ told His disciples, ie response to tbeir questiorj, as to whethnr He would, at that time, restore the Kingdom to Israel, it was not for them to know ' the times and seasons which tlie Father had put in his own power,' Acts 1:7. But after giving tbe signs of His second coming, He said, ' When ye sea these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.' Luke 21 :31. After tlio sigriB appeared, Christ's disciples weie to Icnow faomethiDir which thev could not know before. The signs show the nearness of the event. They were, first; the daiken ing of tho sun and moon, which occurred May 19, 1780. These signs wore to occur ' in those days after that tribulation ' spoken of in Matt. 24 : 21, 22, 29 and Mark 13 : 24, 25. These days of tribula tion refer to the 1260 years of papal persecution duritg the daik ages, Daniel 7 : 25, fiev. 12 : C and 13 : 5. Ttiese represent 12G0 literal years, a day in prophesy standing ior a year. Numb. 14:34; Ezek. 4:6. Th-3 'seventy weeks ' of Dan. 9 : 24 — 27 from tho year day principle beyon&Vquestion.; 69 weeks B^fJrtOffi»lIl^^4f\\!^r9Amffiri!)f1lwl8tte reach to 'Me.-siah, the Prince.' The com mandment was issued in B.C. 457. See Ezra 7. 69 weeks equal 483 days. But 483 literal years, from B.C. 457, did exactly reach to the revelation of Christ as Messiah, which means ' the anointed one.' Christ was anointed with the Holy Ghost at his baptism, A.D, 27. See Mark 1. The 1260 years began in 538 when the papacy gained its supremacy, and ended in 1798 when the French army, under Napoleon, took the Pope prisoner. Tho tribulation or persecution ceased with the order for the abolition of the Jeimit6 in 1773. The eun and moon were to be darkened in those days, but after that tribulation. The supernatural darkening of these heavenly bodies in 1780 exactly meets the specification. Since 1792 we have been iu ' the time of the end.1' Daniel 1:33—35. The stars fell in 1833. From the parable of the fig tree putting iortli its leaves, thus showing that summer was nigh. Christ said we were, from these signs, to know that his coming was near. ' even at the door.' Matt. 24 : 32, 33. Eternity is juet before us. How many will prepare for it ? Where are the faithful servants to raise their voices and sound the alarm, warning men to repent, set their houses io order, and prepare to meet their Lord in peace ?
