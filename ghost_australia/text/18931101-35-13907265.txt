I FUGITIVE NOTES. " The Franco-Russian entente cordiale will secure the peace of Europe " Thus the President of the French Republic to the Czar of All the Russias It is an illustration of what a different aspect a thing may present to different people There are so many things, and Home of them so curious, that are all combining to secure the peace of Europe, that it is hard to think how that peace can over be disturbed while the present generation lasts There, for instance, are some BO. en or eight millions of fighting men on the one side arrayed with sword in hand by the Triple Alliance, and everybody knows that the Triple Alliance is a League of Peace On the other hand, there are some six or seven millions of fighting men in the same attitude in France and Russia, and the union of their horn is now, we learn, secures the peace of Europe Wherever case the trouble come from with H or 15 millions of framed soldiers ready in their camps with Melmito bombs, and smokeless powder, and machine unable march against any disturber of the public peace s Thou organ, we find that Rimini has just been adding a hundred and fifty thousand men to her huge military force , while, as we know, France and Germany have, from year to year, been going one better on each other in piling up their forces, and all this for scouring the peace of Europe England, not to be behindhand, in building a few of the biggest fighting ships that ever floated, is rendering her quota to the forces that are gathering to secure the peace of Europe and though wear our partiality are cou. meed Unit this is merely for defensive purposes, to the eye of France and Russia it appears in the same aspect as that in which we from our propossessions look on the fraternisation of French and Russian fleets Where is the truth to be found amid all this protestation ? Is there truth in it at all, or is it all truth ? Are the rulers of all these armaments trying to throw dust in the eyes of the world ? May they not be every one, and one ran much on the other, intending peace i Just as likely We can't Soho, eat of Russia Germany can't believe it of France Hardly any nation believes that any other But if the ghost of war that is acid ing the nations could be exercised if some Ithunel's spear could touch the nations so that they could see the truth in each other's hearts probably at this moment they would all lay down their arms . . a a "Why do the men not go to church is the practical question that has been troubling the Congregational Union at its annual conference in Victoria. The fact is admitted that they do not, in proportion to their numbers It is not to be supposed that it is true only of the particular Church that has made it the subject of anxious inquiry In all churches it seems to be the same, and a glance into my congregation on a Sunday reveals the surprising paucity of bare heads compared with the flowers and feathers that catch the eye The oddity of some of the reasons given showed the carefulness with which the subject had been investigated One and formed the idea that the reason men star ed from church was because they were not made sufficiently comfortable Another believed that the absence of men from public work - ship was owing to the necessity for their dressing themselves on Sunday morning according to the usage which expects everybody to appear in his go-to chapel best These causes might have force if they were not as applicable to the women, to whom the discomforts of the new and the necessity for putting themselves in Sunday after a do not appear to present any particular barrier to their going to church But others who went a little more below the surface attributed the absence of men to the formal character of the proceedings and to the failure of the treatment of the subjects discounted on to enlist the interest of the male and There is no reflection on religion or on the vastness of the interests it involves in admitting that there is force in this The minds of most men who are out in the whirl of business assume a very practical cost They are doing with things tangible and with immediate issues, "ind theorising about things that do not touch them or affect their immediate interests is alien to the habits of their minds Moro is it so when the theorising is of a character that does not grasp their intellect, whetted by the sharp encounters of every-day life Women's minds are probably more de- votional to begin with, and an outing to elim cb is a more stirring thing in the monotony of their lives than it it is to their brothers and husbands and may be when women take to platform work and to the evolution of social and political life with the franchise in their hands, the pretty flowers and feathers will disappear too from the pews, unless there is more practical stimulant in the sermon or it is brought closer in touch with the practical issues of Mo Now that the question of electric cables in to the front, attention might profitably be given to some way of giving them a little more security in time of war Nobody now attaches any value to possible pledges of protection to cable services when nations are at war If there were 50 nuclei standing they would be burst on the firing of the first gun, and one of the first things done by a belligerent, if it is to his interest, will be to fish up a cable from the deep, and either cut it or use it to Ina purposes by transmitting also new a In these circumstances should there not be some scores, observed in the laying of a cable ' Of course, near the point of contact with land, the situation of a cable could be easily Uuecd But such points would not be difficult to defend so long as Britain is mistress of the seas But in the trackless wastes of ocean migrant cruisers will often evade observation, and granted that the exact location of the cable is known, it will be fished for and covered maybe, even though it may allege li from point to point of British territory In such circumstances the laying or a Pacific cable, if it is to have practical immunity from danger in troublous times, should have it circuitous or irregular hours, and wherever it is in mid-ocean should be preserved among the secrets of the State The process necessary would be a simple one, for the collide the cable-la] lug late times steers might be known only to the scientists and saihtig-mabter on board and such a safeguard would be much more likely to secure the great desideratum of safety to the cable in time of war than any conventions or international understandings for the behaviour of belligerents The statement that an Italian doctor of high repute, after prolonged inquiry, has proved that tobacco smoke is death in microbes, will be glad news for smokers in these days it is so usual for science to frighten one with the presence of death in food and drink, and in the seemingly indifferent habits of our lives, that it is a novelty to find it speaking otherwise In the blood that circulates in our veins we have been led to believe that death floats, so that life is a continued miracle in the face of a thousand agencies plotting its destruction But of all the discoveries that have been raised to scare us, the most charming ne the insidious and deadly microbes, and if in the fumes of the fragrant w end there is the antidote to the bacillus among others-of cholera and typhoid fever, the pipe has scored heavily against those WHO airily denounce the- pernicious use of tobacco" If the theory of the Irihtui doctor is uphold, instead of the smoker being stuffed into it dingy smoking-room, he ought to be distributed over the whole place. Bai old tolerated in the past, he should now be counted as one in whose presence there is safety, and, instead of spending a sort of apologetic life, he should use to the greatness of his position, and feel that he is a benefactor of his race Instead of meekly submitting to the taunt that he is telling his time away in more selfish indulgence, and developing habits of laziness, he should feel conscious, while he thinks, that he is actively engaged in the work of a great sum tary reform, and that every volume of smoke ho ejects from his lips and sends curling upward in the air is a broadside of death to the microbes But there is another side to the case for there are microbes and microbes and the scientists who tell us that microbes are the origin of disease tell us also that there me microbes that are indispensable to all the processes of life And what if the not acco smoke is death to these r It is all very well for it to war against the germs of death, but if it wars against the germs of health and stop the process, of life, then (place the Italian doctor the cure may be us had as the disease The Exhibition at Chicago, which has just been closed, is likely in more ways than one to realise the intentions of its projectors by whipping creation" It was the biggest thing in exhibitions the world had over seen, and it promises to prove the greatest loss Three millions sterling have been sunk beyond to covery in the enterprise itself but that is probably not a tithe of what the cost has been to the speculators who risked investments HE the Queen City of the Lakes on the expectation of the AJXIU bition proving the biggest draw on earth. Had it not been for the forethought of the fire insurance companies who, in view of contingencies, had withdrawn their policies on buildings, the close of the scene would probably have been celebrated by one of the biggest bon breathe world had over seen There is something touching in the high sense of duty shown in this by the insurance companies, who say it is in the interests of morality they act, for that it would have been improper to put temptation to arson in the way of hotelkeepers, who had made provision for ten times the number of people that had sought accommodation This significant fact may be taken as indicating that the work of exhibition in has probably culminated at Chicago Nearly 50 years have closed since the enterprise was first launched It was to have brought the nations face to face and watched them in one Wms were to have disappeared, and trade and commerce and brotherly love were to have ruled the world This prospect at least has been belied, for never in the history of the world have the elements of our looked so portentous That exhibitions have developed industry and trade may be true, but whatever the benefits in that direction may' have been, the world appears to have grown sated with the work of exhibitions The work may go tapering off for a year or two, but it is not improbable that the great American Exposition and its results will practically close the era A.
