An English Tit for an American Tat. One day while Bret Hart and Augus tus Sala were walking arm in arm down Bond- street in London Sala suddenly saidâ€” " What on earth makes yon walk so close to the shop windows old fellow 1" "To avoid being run into," replied Harte, grimly. " The fact is, your coun trymen wear so many glasses screwed into their eyes that they can't see where they're going to save 'em." " Ah 1" replied the English journalist, serenely. Later in the day they chanced to be passing the Langham Hotel, whereupon Sala suddenly seized Harte by the arm and hurried him to the opposite side of the street. " What the deuce does this mean ? Did | you see a ghost or your tailor 1" I " Well, no," said Sala innocently, as he i removed his hat, and inspected it anxi ously, " but the fact is, as we both wore silk bats, it wouldn't do for us to stay on that side. There are so many of your countrymen at the Langham, and they are all spitting ont of the windows con tinually."
