"Pah, the female beast I To think that she oould win my love from tbe sweetest, gentlest, most lovely maiden that everllved 1" "Take care, Richard I Your whispering souuds like the growling of a osged lion I" This was true, and had not the attention of tho guards, behind whom tbo Englishmen stood, and whom they nearly touched, been absorbed by the exciting aceue before them, somo would have turned their eyes susplci. ously aud threateningly upon Master lled wind. " The termagant 1 The soold I The shrew 1 The she-cat i" continued the latter ia the same growling tone, despite -the warning of his cousin, and with his eyes all aflame with hste and scorn. "I cannot rid myself of the" suspicion that I have had seething in my soul ? for fif teen 'years, Arthur." "I pray you soften your tone, Diehard," pleaded Master Maxton. " The terrible suspicion that she had inubh to do with tho capture and death of Countess Mona del Torroda by the hands of the aocursed Bilbao," continued Master Redwind, every hair of his flaming-red beard aeemiug to bristle xai quiver with restrained raze. " She hated all tbo Torredas, and especially Countess Mona, who lovod mc." _ "Kinsman," said Mister Maxton, grasping his cousin's arm sharply, " remember our cause, and tho oath we aro under not to imperil aught that may conduce to its suoceas. We have fearful proof before us thie Inatant that tub womau—fiend in woman's shape, If you like—has great p..wer in Barcelona.

I will look ou in ' sl'enoe," replied Mister Redwind, who then beoame silent. _ " It is a most magnificent speotacle," said Juan Galloz to himself. "It is almost equal ?<? . wo aro t0 ?"" done to-day on Volta's ooffla-shaped platform." Galloz continued to maintain bis position alter the scourging was over. When Balbao alighted from the litter, __so z r tarodat blm ? lih sr "* t oario * it y ln ,". Ho ' . H ? ro '" tho owner of the litter," he said to himself. "The rlob. and noble ilorontine, Siguor Carretta da Medioi, of whom I have heard so much from my gossips recently This is my first sight of him IHo Is a feeble old badger. I see." Galloz would.have lost his footing on the end of the portmanteau from sudden terror, nsa he reoognlsed in tho pretended octogena rian the powerful and formidable Balbao. Master Redwind had never before seen the Umons renegade chief of the Moors, and of course did not recognise that, the pretended Florentine wa* other than he assumed to he. Master Maxton, indeed, had once and but once ever seen Balbao. But twenty years had passed .lace he and Balbao met for the of ?nd only time on the blood-stained deok Tt.li. * . b * ,trtt y' , d Neapolita, aud then ?oilbao waa olad in Moorish armour and rSt-i""- f"! 1 tDeir meeting waa that of two neroeiy fighting men, each arriving to slay the other.- /': Master Msxton, of course, did: not even suspect that the apparently decrepit old man aoseending from, the litter Was the man who had robbed him" of all that once; made life -ear to him."-;./'-.'? Master Redwind was able to see the pale and terrified faoe of the beautiful maiden in the Utter. ?, Balbao qnltted it, and during-. . thatconversation whioh we have related as pa.ai og between Bjlbao .and Counto.a Inez; ana again the wonderful, similitude of that ??ly face to the faoe of Countess Mona, a. memory, had engraved the latter oountecanoe lorever upon tho, heart of the Eagllshmau, struck hi. brain as violently as it had when „i mf' „ not " 1 the likeness in the attic room of The Sweet Rspose.

But what can I do P Nothing, Tho maiden is Balbao's daughter." Yet when it was plain upon the vindiotivo features ol Countess Inez that she thought of commanding and ioroiug Lady Mazeenta to quit tho shelter of the litter and walk between tho-fllos ot the guards and in tho sight of the rabble to the roar entranao of the Soorda palace, Master Kedwind was-so stirred to auger and indignation and tor effort to befriend Iho poor maiden, that he said,-sternly and loudly: " All honour should bo shown to the . intended bride of Count Soorda." When Countess Inez gave her command Ibat the bold speaker ihonld be led forward, aud as sho askod her bannor-boarer for the scourge, hor eye waa upon tho ugly faoe of Jnan Galloz, the most conspicuous object in the direction- whence the bold words had' been hurled rathar than Bpoken. ..'The Countess, recovering from tho.mo mentary belief that she had just heard.tho voice of a man whom she had' never ceased to lovo with all the intense joalonsy of her tlgress-liko heart, and greatly vexed' with herself for having even for au instant fancied I.that it was possible the man was there, suddenly conoeived tbo idea that the insolent speaker was Juan Galloz. Jnan Galloz chanced to bo looking at Master-Bodwiud as the countess gave the order spoken of. Amazement . t?t. the' supreme audacity of tho Eaglitrhma'u held tbe innkeeper spell-bound for a time, and daring that brief but very important. time the oonntess gave hsr order, and with her severe and rorsngoful gaze upon his faob. -. ?:' Had Galloz known that she was. gazing at him as she spoke, or inspebted that ho-was stlspeated, lie would probably have sprung from the portmanteau instantly aud hidden himself amid the mats of rabblo near him.

Galloz, furious as a mad bull—tho vi?ago of which animal his own. greatly resembled— and not'daring to give vent to his rage and the truth, rolled his eyes wildly about him, met the exultant gaze, of Dama Boveda— rejoicing in; anticipation of seeing Galloz, "Well basted," as thei dame expressed it to hersolfr— fixed his gaze npon tho gronndi and shook his ball- like head.

V '"Do not dare deny that yon. uttered .those insolent words—more insolent 1 in Itono than in phraso—for -I know, that you. are the culprit," said the oonnteis, sternly. '-..-* You know a lie I" thought Galloz, still, speechless, and adding to himself;" I will neither deny or admit the aecasalion. 1 ' . But as he lilted his eyes and glanced around' . at the many faoes about him, he thought: '. "The shame I The public shame 1 To'be flogged, like a hound, and. by a woman 1 I will esoape the shame If I can." ; " Noble lady," he said aloud ; '."

Do yon presume to bo a thinker for:, my . brother I : : . Down' upon your., knees I.

Galloz drew his sleeve aoross the smarting welt, that told instantly where and how severely the slrokp had hurt, and involun tarily his right hand grasped the hilt ? of his sword. -.' In an in?tant the spears of twenty guards made a terriblo neeklaoo aronnd his throat with their keen and glitreriug points. But a word, a nod from. the Heroe countess was needed to send these twenty points- olashlng through his nook, breast, and baok. ' But that would be death, instant death to Juan Galloz ; and then her delight in soonrg ing him wonld be lost to tho countoss. " Disarm and bind bim and put him upon his knees," bommanded the oonntess. , . " May not the litter move on with .Lsdy . .Mszeenta ere your highness chastises this man I*' asked Balbao. ?. " I would suggest, at least, noble-lady, that the Utter be oarrled within the promises.now rented.by mc." . " The litter or the'maiden; shall remain . where it ia,. signsr," replied the-ooaotees, haughtily.; " Lot her quit .the. Utter,- if you repent *>f having given h-uIU -protection. .1 do. not kias the feet of what my brother worships." - " '? "Nay, great lady. The litter is at the service of her who will ere night be First Lidy In Baroelons," said Balbao respectfully bat pointedly. . " She is not yet, and may never be, First Xjidy in Barcelona," retorted the countess, with a dangerous sparkle of demon thought in her eyt*. " I am' Firat Lidy in Barcelona, Slgnor Carrctta, and you will do well to bear tho fact iv constant remembranoe. Tour tone ifl it-solent. Your age protects you. Be careful." -" By Allah," aaid Balbao to himself,. " I verily believe the tigress would dare lay her scourge upon mc; 'My age protects mc I Good I . II she only auspuoted now that I am not ten years older than herself I*'. On hi. knees, and with his hands crossed and bound, at the wrists behind his baok, Juan Galloz, not daring ta speak the truth, set his -teeth hard tot-etb,er and'mado.his; muscles' rigid to receive his scourging. * .

At the same time It is neoersary \o say that Galloa did. not reeelve a blow more than his constitutional rasoslity and Jong "'ub pnnished -villainy deserved. Beiuing up her well-trained palfrey near tbe kneeling wreloh, and leaning well over him, tbe oeuntess stormed down a per/eot tempest of strokes upon him. The countess had the strength ol a strong man, and Juan Gallon had not the fortitude that had enabled Dama Boveda tv receive hor punishment without a wbiuper. He howled! He roared!

He had a strong belief that he received aomewhere iv tho neighbourhood ot five milllona—though probably not more than a hundred strokes were struck- when Count Soorda called out : " Countess I Sister] Inez 1 Stop I Cease that work I For shame 1 Stop 1" ???-. But ths count was not near enough to seise hia sister's arm aa'he thus shouted; and when did an angry woman ever hold her striking arm or raiUng tongue the instant lawful or unlawful authority oommanded her obedlenoe. On the contrary, the countess dealt her strokes all the faster and fiercer after the count shouted at her, till he dashed forward and.severed, the detoending soourge'near. her hand with a furious sweep uf his keen-edged sword; so that we are pleased in being able to say that the guilty and howling.innkeeper received about a hundred and twenty blows j —whioh were by no means a whipping fora baby.";..;??-::-.;-.-.:;; ..'.'-;.,-;,-.;;.W.-,:: .- As a .final, blow the.oeuntess- hurled the heavy butt of tbe scourge .at the. head of Galloz, and &s; she was very expert iv hurllug all' kinds of missiles. at_ her ; servants, the weighty mass^'aVha'rd"os'stohe, struck tho brutal rsscol squarely between his ugly eyes, and tumbled him over upon.hi. back.
