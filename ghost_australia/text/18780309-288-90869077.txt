THE MYSTEEIES OF CKIME; OB, The Experiences of ait Edimwbgkh Detective. — No. LXXVI. [Published by special arrangement with the Author.] A DARK OMEN. I said I had to give two ghost stories running, because omens and ghosts may be roughly classed together as of an equally supernatural character, and because there really was a sort of shadowy wraith in the following case in addition to the omen itself. I need not reiterate my .own utter disbelief in either. When I was a child I had a mortal terror of ' bogles ' and spectral *' dumbie doc tors,' and repeatedly fancied that I saw them arid met them ; but when I grew up, and learned to fairly scout the idea, lo and behold every one of the shadowy ap pearances left me in disgust. I saw gho3ts no more. The simple fact is capable 6i very wide application. Thousands in this world, never advance a step beyond this ghost seeing and ghost-believing childhojd. Chil dren they live, and children they die. Yet, on such we cannot heap the faintest blame or recrimination — their belief is sinipla and sincere j and is likely to injure themselves alone. But there is another and infinitely more pernicious phase of the question, de serving ' of universal abhorrence and con demnation — the deliberate invention of such stories to pander to this weakness. I reiterate, the person or writer who sits down to concoct such weird nonsense and relate it as fact — however thrilling, fasci nating, or masterly such relation may lie — leaves a dark blot 'behind him, fraught with incalculable mischief t« whole generations yet to come ; for while hundreds may have the strength of mind and good sense to say, ' Pooh ! a piece of unmitigated nonsense from beginning to end,' thousands would only say, ' How wonderful — mystical— im- pressive ! — just such' a thing as I have often heard of and always believed,' and thus the darkness and ignorance is clung to and per petuated. I speak thus decidedly before beginning to the story in case the end and aim of the whole should be misunderstood. Some after reading the case may exclaim in trmmph', ' Why, the omen was fulfilled after all in a way.' And so it was, in a way, but not in the way. Out about a mile and a half from Edin burgh there yet stands, in the centre of a fine park studded with stately trees, a gentleman's country seat, which I shall call Bower House. The place, I believe, is very ancient, and is so curiously con structed — against all known rule and cus tom; — that long before* the present century, it was dubbed 'Abbot's Folly,' which expressive title it gets to this day. The owner at the time of which I write was Benjamin Abbot, Esq., a gentleman of about 40 years of age, a bachelor, a kind of biblio maniac, an antiquarian of great* research, and altogether a strange and eccentric mixture of superstition and deep learning. The house itself I need not trouble to de scribe : but one wing or detached tower, in habited almost constantly by the owner him self, demands close attention. If the reader can imagine a massive round tower with one half of it split off from the roof downwards, and the flat side backed with a -wall nearly as thick as a house, he will have a pretty correct idea of this old wing. The whole tower, flat side and round, was covered from top to bottom with a massive growth ot ivy, so thick and strong that three men could have swung from some of the branches without the slightest danger of tearing \- them from the old walL The front, or round, side of til© Wwer, 4kQW-i& 9119 iWftA ??ip!ii-*' aiia~:no4;iiibre.

A,bbb,t .sat akme um 'flfe one 'ii^biifebletapartment in -the; curibiis wing, . poring .rov-er. one of/his^ ; treasipes in the sfra£-e of an old parchment-! covered volume with such f rayed J leaves: that an Ordinary onlooker would have ' tiioughtitonly fitf or the fireor dnst-bin. The ?; robm itself wasra vast roomy hall, the great: height of, which was only faintly relieved by the :r sweeping tapestries, great curtains, and sathiHcpvered panelling, now dingy ; with age aid neglect. It would be difficult to say what theroom was meant for. Mr. Abbot, indeed, seemed to have selected it as his Ireasure-cliamber on account of its strength and inaccessible position, and then to have conveyed himself and his peculiar studies permanently to the spot. Thus the place was. at once his bedchamber, his library, his study, has dining-room, and his plate-chest or strong-room. Into the back; wall— thick enough to have scooped bed rooms in — were built three iron safes^ con taining not only the family plate, but many valuable antiquities in silver and gold as well. The remainder of the wall, right up to the window on either side, was occupied with shelves crammed to repletion with old books and pictures, and fronted with whole piles of volumes three or four deep, and covered with dust of years' accumula tion. The effect of the whole was that of a dirty old auction, room or broker's shop ; and in the very midst of all this apparent confusion and real dust sat Mr. Abbot, gloatingly surveying one of his dearest treasures. . Just about this time — that is, when most well-conditioned clocks were striking twelve —Mr. Abbot started and listened while the clock overhead. slowly pealed out the hour. Why he listened particularly on this occa sion I cannot tell; but listen he did, and count, too, till the whole twelve strokes were given, and then he was petrified — fixed to his chair in a cold sweat of terror by hearing the bell of the clock steadily continue its strokes- till over twelve peals ? had been given — making twenty-four in all '?'? — when, with a last discordant clang it ceased, leaving a deadly stillness behind, and one man at least in a state of terror and dismay bordering on oblivion. An ordinary : listener would most probably have laughed at such a trifling circumstance, and, per haps, have passed it off with some such remark as ' I think the clock's daft,' or ' That clock needs cleaning;' but with Mr. . Abbot it was different. According to a tradition attached to the house, the clock striking wrong — and more especially the . exact and fatal number of twenty-four — was a dark omen, foretelling that in three days the youngest man in the house should die. With a deadly shudder the owner now remembered that, he himself was at = that moment the youngest man in the house^ — the butler, coachman, and footman, ; the only men-servants he would employ, being all old retainers and above his own age. 'My days are numbered,' he faintly whispered to himself. '' I am to die — at such a. time, too, when my collection, the labor of half a lifetime,. is approaching com pletion ? I am to die with the task uncom pleted — the house and laud will pass away to strangers, and all iny treasures ruthlessly swept away and hawked piecemeal to the highest bidder !;' and, groaning aloud, he dropped the book on the floor and. covered his face with his hands. It must have been a. curious and sugges tive spectacle to see a man of such wealth and learning cringipg thus, at the striking of a clock ; but, perhaps, it is so with most of us when the dread summons breaks in upon us. There is always some work un finished — some pet ambition unoratified — some fond project cast to the winds when just on the eve of fruition. ' 'But I may have been mistaken in the number,' said ' Mr. Abbot to himself, after a pause to think, and much in the manner that drowning men catch at straws. 'I am too young to die yet — only 40, still un married, and the last of the Abbots. The tradition always spoke of a wraith, or shadowy appearance, tod, on the second day ; I have to sae that before considering myself doomed.' On the whole,. I believe, up to this time Mi*. Abbot, though startled aud terrified, was not utterly given up to despair. The strange circumstance only, acted, as a warn ing to him — a quiekener to a long-deferred action, which he new solemnly promised to himself he would delay no longer. ' I' will 'break off my secluded habits, go more into society, get married,- if possible, and, perhaps, leave my books aud antiqui ties to a son who will appreciate and pro tect them,' was his next thought ; and, having thus settled the thing in his mind, he tossed through the entire night iu bed, trving to reason himself out of the belief in' a mere foolish tradition, and' vowing every Mnd of atonement for the past if he should only be spared to enjoy dear life. The morning came, and then, in the great blaze of day, the dark oaten, with even his own frantic vows, were forgotten, or re membered only as a hazy nightmare. No shadowy form appeared before him to con firm the omen, and with a sigh of relief he saw the sun down, and renewed his studies with a whetted appetite, as if he had just been vouchsafed a fresh lease of life. While this solitary man was thus bend ing over his books in that deserted and spacious apartment, with only a solitary lamp lighting up his pale face and imme diate surroundings with its glow, while the background hung round him in mystical waves of grey shadow — two men were getting off the highway outside the park by the very simple process of climbing the wall. Both were powerful and resolute looking ruffians, one having a slightly Jewish cast of countenance, and the other being an unmistakeably yellow-skinned quadroon, with fierce, restless eyes, and rather handsome features. The night, as I showed in the last sketch, was remarkably clear for November ; and even in the uncer tain moonlight among the trees I believe, had I seen them, I would have recognised the two men at a glance as the RiiSian and his new follower, Jem Congo.

'It would never do to] take the story of the three safes full of] metal upon mere hearsay.; We -must see \ them — study their position— know what tools they are likely to require— find out whether the room has more doors than one — and try to discover if the place boasts of an alarm bell.-' r 'V . \ 'Ay, or whether the. old Tjloke keeps firearms handy about him, that he could pop off at a cove at., a moment's notice,' suggestively added Congo. ''Twould be i pleasant, wouldn't it, to earry ; off a pound or so of lead in vpur stomach, instead of a gigful of plate f' ' ' Bah. You always look at the wrong side of things,' growled the Ruffian. ,' We ; shan't carry off the lead unless we deserve ' it for our bungling.' ' I don't know,' gloomily responded Congo; 'it ain't likely he'll give in without a struggle, and he's not likely to be asleep. Do you think he'll sit calmly by while 1 empty his safes ?' 'He'll sit calm enough if I'm there,' savagely growled the Ruffian.. 'If he doesn't he puts little value on his life, that's all. I begin to believe that this continued run of ill-luck that is haunting me. will never cease till I put a knife in somebody. Don't laugh like a fool, for I uiight make a mistake and put it in you!' ''Poh! you're in a bad temper, or you'd remember that I never feared a living man,' coolly answered Congo. ' Try your knife on.McIndoe — he's more deserving1 of it.'. ;:.-? 'Curses on it, I believe you speak- the truth,' hoarsely returned the Jew.. 'Sleep- ing or waking,, that man is ever before me: — always pushing me, too, down into what seems not only ruin and defeat, but a yawning grave. Every day forces on me the belief that he is at the bottom of ? all our failures. I tell you if this goes on any longer I will kill him— openly, straightfor ward—though I should dance on nothing ten minutes after. It's coming to it— I feel it's coming to it — it must be he or I J' - '-S — s — sh! hold your prating chat or the owls will wake,' whispered Congo, looking nervously around. ' What's the good of shouting about it ? As for me, I am done with such risky games — afteT Penlrank escaping such a well-laid scheme, I wouldn't tiy it, unless I was tired of life.' 'I shall not ask you,' sharply returned the Ruffian ; ' I wouldn't have him killed hy any hand but my own though it were to put a fortune at iny feet.' Congo whistled softly and unconcernedly to himself, and allowed his eye to travel up the ivy-covered wall in a business-like survey. ; . 'Well, how's it to be done7?'' he asked, after takuipr every point of vantage. ' We needn't both go up, either j shall it be you or I?' 'I am no climber,' said thaRuffian, with commendable modesty and caution. ' You had better make the first ascent ; and if your report is unsatisfactory I may go up after you.' . 'How, then? — by the- ivy? — the branches are thick enough, and my head ain't easy turned.' ' _ 'I have thought of that,' quietly re turned the Ruffian. 'No, the ivy is too close, and the window, you must remember, ' has neither shutters nor blind inside. The man might look up at any' moment, see your face, give the alarm, and effectually spoil our game for to-morrow night. At present you only need to see intothe room. Now, the window is an uncommonly large one, and diiectlyin aline withthistreeJ Get up by the tree, then — see what you can, and to-morrow night we can both go up by the ivy ; or you can go up and fix the rope for me, after giving him one for his nob if he bowls.' Congo was a man of action, not words, and without a single objection he' spat on his hands, and was about to. climb up the tree with the speed and agility of a monkey, when a sudden warning ' Hist !' from the Ruffian made him pause and look up at the window, which he now saw gave out a dimmer glow of light. 'Quick! up with you— he is going to douse the glym and get to bed— ijt's your only chance to see the inside,' cried the Ruffian, and in a moment Congo was speed ing upwards from branch to branch till, he was far up and directly opposite the winr dow, with the clear nioori shining at his back, and sending the shadow of both him and the branch to which he clung cleaxly and distinctly into the room. Just as- he reached his elevated perch the light was extinguished, and he saw a white form — which he took for that of Mr. Abbot in his Bight-dress— flit away out of sight towards the antique bedstead, which he could just discern and no more, at the end of the room. A curse of disappointment rose from the throat of the thief as he saw almost his only chance of a good look into the place thus lost ; and then, just as he was about to clamber down and report matters, he no ticed for the first time the clearness of the moonlight, and the fact that it was illumi nating to a considerable extent the back of the room he wished to examine. He swung himself forward, clinging to the brancUby one leg 'and arm alone, and, ^ peering forward to make the most of thediufelight, and then for the first time saw distinctly against the wall inside a grotesque reflee-. tion of himself hangingi as it were, in mid air. He noticed that much and bo more. He had no tune to note the peculiar effect of the shadow thrown by the fur cap on his head, with the flaps transformed into diabolical ears or horns, and the whole figure inftgni- . fied and elongated, for just as he made the discovery » piercing' yell or scream from' within tho room in the direction of the bed burst u?on ijs eajSj mi wu\ him, flying thanth^witr^h^^^^y^^l^; corned hea^jiispish^ ~, fernal owliinej, ^d -Jti^n, with^^scream- of C ierrorJUraii .enongh' to; have |3iised^&e; dea2 |£dm %^|^y^^r|y^g^p^ up ^ (aims -and djro^ped 6epse|ess 9a-tai» ^t^rases1 ion' you f what did » ypn';^w^e ;tundbliflg down again ^f or ??v hoarsely, eried .^J^uF?5a»$s$rj|k: many aiscared,vbackf ward glance he followed Jus companion ki£# ^^¥^?,9^*be Straps.

However chary the Ruffian might be about risking, his own skin, his ill-directed intelligence always came out far to the front with his associates, and in the presents, instance the soundness of his surmise was soon apparent^. No, alarm was given, no bell was rung, no dancing, lights flitted to and fro. or flashed .from the., dark windows, not a sound was heard in house or park calculated to alarm the thieves or send them flying, over the wall and across the country. The! fiale.. moon shone on, the white clouds flitted- lazily across, the sky, and, after waiting and watching for. nearly half-an-hour, the Ruftlaii gave the order for the homeward journey, and the place was vacated. What Jjthe two thought, or said when they reached the 'JEbunted House' and missed a valuable bundle of .their tools, from the kitchen, -Ijcannot tell, for, when Congo came to unburden his mind to me, I was too anxious .about matters more im portant to enquire; but I sincerely, trust that the two, ill-tempered as they probably were, quarrelled, and. fought over it till they were tired. I)og-in-a-manger life is not the rarest thing in the world with pro fessional criminals. Meanwhile Mr. Abbot slowly recovered his senses, and gradually recalled.the dread-? ful circumstances preceding his fall. ,? Ths, thought was not reassuring; in a word, the. poor gentleman now considered his fate sealed. Looking fearfully up from the carpet on which he had found himself stretched he, could still see the broad squares of moonlight on the wall — the clear-cut shadow of. the leafless tree down to .£ho slenderest twig — but the dreadful wraith ox shadowy form was gone. He had 'managed to crawl into bed somehow, but when he was called in the .morning, he . was so .de jected and ill-looking ifrat the butler took upon himself to send for oner of Mr. Abbot's own friends, who happened to be a medical . man. This gentleman very speedily ascer tained that his friend's trouble lay hot in his body -but inthis mind ; and, after, draw ing out 'of him;; with difficulty a minute7 account of the whole affair, and trying iii vain to Jaugh him out of his notion, he at; hist induced him 'to take a seat, in his carriage and drive-in to see nie. When they were, shown in,- I recognisiBd the medical man alt a glasce as'one who had coasulted' me before in xaqre cases Ihan biie.j * but it . was the bloodless' and unhappy countenance of his cohiijanlonj Mri Abbot'lninaeliy that' chiefly attracted my notice and excited my sympathyi. Almost theur ; fir§f words, coming as they did &6' soon after, niy last night'* work, made mestart tip ia; surprise. ; ' -A strange ghostly omen V I jeehoed, In ' ?wonderment.

The 'evening passed Tery ^easantlyandfiwiftlyiand thea'about half an hour before midnight we tob;k our \vay through long, cool passages ^arid curious crooked stairs to the haunted' wing : occu pied by Mr. Abbot and his chief treasures. I examined the great apartment and its contents curiously and toinutfely, though the idea of being intruded upon by thieves, I honestly, confess, never once crossed my mind-^-even when the three safes were thrown open to our view, showing shelf upon snelf covered witn costly arncies that wouid have made a burglar's teeth water with envy. Outside, the calm beauty of the scene was something1 to be remembered. Close to the park^was the little village churchyard, throwing a long spiky shadow athwart the graveyard and the smooth field beyond. Further down the Elope was a broad bum, flashing like liquid silver in the moonlight ; and beyond that, behind a long mass of shadow cast by one of the fleeting clouds, twinkled the yellow lights of the city in clusters of thousands. -In; gazing upon the 'scene and pointing out- its beauties, a holy calm or hush fell upon } us instinctively, and the strange object of our meeting 'had* almost faded from Our memories, when the cloek above began to toll out 'the hour. We listened breathlessly, biit- 1 only managed to count seventeen strokes/and was again advising Mr* Abbot to consult a clock maker, when the doctor -suggested1 ? that now was the time, if any, to try the effect and, at once acting upon the -hint; we ex tinguished the lamp and sat. down in the dark, close to the bedrto watch mid wait. ; ' But it was a mere waste of time. We saw. the great 'square ''of light thrown by tire nioon athwart the wall — we even could follow every tracing of the sliadow of the tree outside — but no spectral shadow appeared. This went on for nearly half, an hour, neither of us uttering a so and above our breath, when I started aud looked to the window. 'What's outside ?' I sharply whispered. Mr. Abbot stared at the question, and at last stammered — . :..-'. . in ouiing, vv nas ao you meau r 'I mean is there no 'stair or anything leading np.ouiside, for ,1 .certainly hear a soundl&e;/spme#ung ascending.

They did hear something now-^-a rus tling and taigging among ther thick ivy below the. windowWa ^und which might haye been mistaken for owls or night hawks, had it.aiot been accompanied bv a scraping sound, as of a man with thick boots, gradually rising towards, us outside the walL An hysterical quivering at this moment seized Mr. Abbot,, and to prevent him from falling we had to support him bodily in our arms, and while bending for- . ward to -io this, my eye fell on the moonlit wall, and caught for the first time the dark -shadow of a human head and shoulders. Instantly looking, towards the window, and grappling both .my, companions like a vice to prevent them giving, an alarm, I saw sip wly . rising into view, a fur-capped head and shoulders — a veritable living .man1— uncommonly like a. burglar or cracks man in appearance, and grasping firmly in his teeth a pistol, which I had not the slightest doubt was both loaded and cocked. The man was evidently neither a coward, nor light-headed; for he now hung nearly forty ieet from the ground by one hand, arid' the uncertain footing among the ivy -stems, while with the other he metho dically proceeded to prize up the window, after carefully' peering in to ascertain that the coast was clear. The window rose about three 'inches, -then his hand caine through', .and - grasped the inside of the sill— then the'- other :hand followed— and then with a sudden jerk, he threw up the window, and. was about to. scramble into the room, %nei), as by one impulse, we all three sprang forward into the moonlight towards him. ' *. .. .'.'. ...
