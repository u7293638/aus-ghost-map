Parker's Gully. Vii had had a long run of bad luck No one who saw us when we first plied pick and shovel on Marengo would have recognised in the three sullen faces, upon we hush the light of our evening camp fire shone, any resemblance to the cheerful trio who were then filled with hopeful visions of the future News had lately come of a great rush to a new field called " Reedy Flat The large finds, the big nugget turned up by the wheel of the first invading dray, the price of provisions, and the best means of reaching the now "Tom Fiddler's ground, ' wore the only subjects of conversation Day after day, diggers humping their swags played on dum, giving us cheery good-bye, md the invariable answer to any question as to their destination was, "Off to 'the Reedy'" We had at first been very sanguine about our chum and although we all truce wished to join in the general exodus, none cared to be the first to pi opuse it So we grubbed on for a few days after the stampede had ended, more and more dissatisfied with our prospects and with e each other Long Jake, as the eldest of my mates was of rabbits by culled, was an old and experienced diD get, but he did not case to propose a move is he had been the prime cause of our presence here and my other make, a y oting H How of about my own age, we na prob did prevented from doing so by the modesty which hindered me At last, however, things would continue in tins while longer, and when one evening after a li min days work than travel, the road is of which had been even smaller than they wor e gener idly, we lit our pipes and show our p Tomkins of tea to our sides a proper time for our usual eli it, there seemed to be an instructive landed at miling among us that something would at list be proposed The silence was far longer than Hau and I had ample time to travel over in my mind some acute or so of nigiiiioiiH ways of introducing the subject him great difficulty was to chu of the boat And thus we Bit smoking and thinking, until J iko slowly raised him self on his elbow, and looking for light into the ino, said with a peculiar imbin maul di awl-" D'ye know, unites 1 die out last night we were off to " the limit ' 1 at a time not a word followed, but he tin near his eyes slowly from one to the other, and bestowed upon each in ink iliiiostaiipiiinltinlly solemn, and then to(Wed quietly into Ihuduk spies beyond us and the light of our camp fire 1 Hiding that we did not reply, he brought his eyes to bear upon us in a more, and fitted, " And I was just it thinking how BLI urge it would be if even we tin so we are to find out of his there. This was followed by another solemn wink, and bursting into a roar of laughter who threw disguise to the winds I knew very well that you wanted to go,' luke observed, when one imminent had subsided, "but I wasn t going to propose it You young chaps always do one of two horses You either think an old digger Ina a sort of niRpn ation winds in this him know where gold in, as natural as a blackfellow knows where water is to be kind, or else, we is it's vv or SO, you think he knows nothing', 'cause his had his t, chock full of Helene Now, I by heavy air hence will do wonders, but then you know it haven t done much yet Oiology'B all very well, but it's only a baby yet , wait till it can talk a bit planes Whichever way you think, mutes, I dint want you to think less of me, as you would have done, and quite a state is, too, if Id him but on this now Utah and it tin is out it still But now we understand each other, and if we do get a backhanded, why time's no hand to anyone" In less than an horn we had not only ages cut to go to " the Reedy, ' but to fit n t next day. A digger s picking does not take much time His blankets and the fire is then he would make convincing swing, which, slipped over his hand and resting on one shoulder, is easily emin 1, although it may not add to the diligence of his appearance I never put mine on at first with out feeling IIB if I were about to gun through it, as Hiatus do through horse collars at village fans in the old city, but the sensible m soon none oil, and I carry mine now with as little consciousness as in the old times an umbrella would have occasioned The sun was just up as we turned up hickson the man of our past six months' 1 abor We had but little to show for the amount of toil expended, but the diggers motto is my mably better luck next time," and as we found few pleasant subjects Supplied by the past, we chatted g uly about the future It is man climie how soon, and to how great an extent, one chums off in a fine bush life the reticence engendered by life in Ingecjm munities We talked of ourselves, our hopes, and our intentions with a mute egotism which made conversation delightful Old Juke had little to say He had arrived at that period of life when the major portion of its hopes belong to the past, but he hastened to na evidently pleased to see us so hopeful , of and in a Btukmg in with a cusp anecdote, a description of some of his own experience, or a piece of criticism which revealed a world of natural shuwdncBs under its apparent simplicity That was a glorioT journey The days, though flames, were relieved by seats which, if not sparkling, at least appeared HO in the sombre bush in 1 by anecdotes many of them exceedingly venerable, but greeted with as hearty laughter as when last related to appreciative listeners and then the lights, when the swags were unrolled beneath spreading branches, the tea made, md the pipes lit, what Stones we heard of the old colonial days Jake came out nobly then He had been to all the important diggings, and had something to tell of each something which, told in his quaint inimitable style, made a shout with laughter till the quiet bush seemed astonished, or brought tears to our cyLB which we need not have been so anxious to once it, for they were no dishonor to our young manhood And thin, better than all, to be in the cool sweet night air, and watch the stars through the branches overhead , or the moon riding high over the distant hills, till the acetic f tiled and our eyes closed in a dreamless plumber as ever we slept on our mother's bosom But the pleasantest journeys end, and generally sooner than those which are made off a catalogue of disagreeable. and on the sixth morning we stood on the top of the fruit hill, and looked down on the tents which speckled the wide surface of Reedy Flat The township, as the scattered collection of tents and bark humpies was as usual called, pro sented the common appearance of a new gold- field in the erection of their dwelling places, the miners had merely consulted their own sweet fancy , there was no regularity, regarding idea, and the man who attempted to take his walks abroad on a moonless night, if he escaped falling into one of the holes, would be absolutely certain to be cast his hand over tent pegs or ropes All were busy, but there seemed to be little of the nation we had expected, and the few whom we accosted informed us that they were " only making tucker It was rather hard after do our hopefulness, but there we were, and we had to make the best of it. We spent the rest of the day in looking about the pkgs, prospecting a little here and there, and before night Jake had found a place which he thought likely, and had pegged off three men's ground It turned out worse than we expected, but we worked on patiently for some weeks, hoping each morning before night to strike s mouthing rich, and find ing ourselves at night very moody and dissatisfied Jako took it very coolly, and never seemed much distressed, even when, after a hard day's work, the spoils were ml, but it told on us, the younger and more inexperienced, and we grew tired of each other's society, and restless for change No chatting and story-telling now Each drank his tea in silence, smoked a dismal pipe or two, and tumbled into his blankets, not to sleep, but to think. what my own thoughts were, how gloomily despairing I do not care to refill Sometimes I strolled away from the camp, and after walking a few miles returned, certain at least of sound sleep, instead of as early turning from side to side, grumbling at the tardy flight of the hours One moonlight night I wandered further than use vi, and for the first time reached a place of which I had often heard the diggers Speak It was a deep gorge between two long low hills, and was known on the Reedy as Parkers Gull) Iliad bent d it spoken of as a pretty place, and had no idea how marvellously beautiful it was till I saw it for my self The hills on either side were compar ativ el) low, but appealed far higher, then sides from the bottom of the gully using almost like walls In one place the gully narrowed to about a hundred yards, and the hills rose steeply on each side I reached this spot just as the moon was over in the light seemed to ripple like a broad shallow stream down the hill sides, breaking into cascades upon masses of look scattered here and there, and Bilv sing the trees in the gully below It was a glimpse of fairy land 'I here was a n go in loss of rock, fallen from the lull, lying not far from me, and scrambling on to this I sat there till the moth had almost disappeared, and the mingled shade and brightness were cr caping up the eastern slope I resolved that I would come over night while the moon rose at a convenient time, and by the end of the week was so familiar with the load thither that I was in the habit of reaching my chosen spot in the dal kness, and was waiting patiently for what I learned in my own in mind "the) grand transformation scene ' Itvv IS great loss to see the flood of light strike the crown of the hill and some say keeping down and I have often felt the poetic frenzy Bli out; upon me, but, alas the power of expression was wanting On my fourth or fifth visit I felt an uneasy consciousness that there was some one not far from me, and at last my supposition seemed to become an indubitable fact, for hearing some slight noise I rose and peering into the darkness I distinctly saw a human figure My view of her was in my hand in a. moment, but before I could speak the figure had vanished I was standing in the full li slit of the moon's that every in- action could be seen by the person in the strike, if person they o were Of this I began to have doubts, for after a long search I could find no trace Upon dated the matter deeply on my way home He less I knew it could not we all be, for the girl) was named after a in a wretched man who had shot himself there during the attack of delirium of emus, and since then they were said to have avoided it even by day the supposition that it was the shade of the defunct V u kel crossed my mind, but was dismissed at once At the same time I must confess that I looked behind me neither anxiously once or twice before I was out of the gully, but that, of course, was merely to nil while the scenery I could come to no conclusion about the matter, and resolved that I was mad go again on the next night, taking take with me He was a perfect master of ill bush at it as I could to neck like a li ittve, so if anyone had close up the my stay it was he I took an opportunity of speaking to him next day, and my communication made him very thoughtful He said nothing for some hours, but it was evident that he was looking at the matter from every possible standpoint. At last he c one to me and said Pte pretty well fixed the matter in my own mind 1 d in t think you are mistaken, though, mind you, you may begin when a mistake to walking three or four miles every night to see the moon rise in a particular pi ice, he is apt to get a bit queer But, if you is not mistaken, the only WA) out of it I can see is that some of the fellows have of wild a pitch of good ground over there and work it by moonlight to prevent it being known I don t see why we should at have a share in anything good that's going to night we 11 try and back cm I was feverishly) anxious f of the night to come, in now there was not only a mystery to be cleared up but a possible, > id fortune to be realised lad took the matter nine quietly this I, not even when we st i ted boil a) of 1 no bills of excitement It was a pitch dark night, and as the mo m would not rise till nearly ten inch ck, we had and time to reach the place under cover of the darkness When worried, Jnl o curled himself up beside the i )ck, and said with a subdued chuckle "ion we got iHJit of genius for we catching fire tUu more, milk, HU keep a bright look out and call me in in hour or His ' A presentiment that something we are about to li appear made me restless and lincoln for table I shifted continually from one position to moth is, in the vain hope of finding au i 18) one At last the moon begin to use but had no eyes to-night for the beauties of nature and I quickly aw like my companion He was on the alert man instant, and leaving me on one side of the rock he Bri To round to the other to watch these the signal agreed upon in the event of either Racing anything was a shot howl resembling that of a natural is 'the liuiucntH passed very BIJVVI) I strained my eyes looking into the deal but so that all the objects around us seemed wrapped in a line A dozen turn H 1 w es about to give the signal, and in w only just in time that what I had supposed to be a moving, figure was only a tree to unite or in ck I had almost given up watch in do so in, what I Biwhouio thing gliding among thieves and under? way ed, about fifty yards of mine I watched it for a moment or two lost 1 IIIILTII hive, gambroon deceived, and then g in the sign of BO H July that it could not be heard be) md a few p ie s In an met at Jake was beside me I p noted in silence to the Bp )t where I had been the figure, and as I did SO it in pencil again where there were a few y in ds of clear ground I am led to speak to June, but already he was a fine ym<1B away, stealthily creeping towards the place I knew that my services would be useless to an old bushman, and I sat down t J went for his return to nil at 11 quarter of an hour he came back, but I could see he had been dishes named "Home, in its, su The and we st enters at once " Well, now, I do it so as it could be been it sent, a mile of his clothes i remarked he as we trod I) June "I heard tell of them coming in old f ironed 1 aches and armor and all that, but of never he and of one in a II times jumper and mole skin pants In fact, I did see how they can have clothes at all call-up there s ghosts of coats and spirits of his coaches " You must have got pretty el so to see how he was dressed, said I h plug to draw him out "Well, I did, too tints a fact, H ml lake, " but where he vanished to be not Bay I e w him one moment and next he was gone During the next afternoon heavy banks of clouds began to gather, and before night the run was streaming down in torrents It cleared son after sunset, but our work was not a pleasant one Every hollow was a puddle, many of them nearly a foot deep, with a perverse f to BCLtned to lead us into all there were alone, the track By the time we reached the gully we were wet and muddy to the knees, and a chill wind, which came in routing blasts between the hills, did not a Id to our comfort The moon, as we knew, would not ask for more than an hour, and it was with no pleasant feelings that I contemplated waiting during the interval, shivering in my wet clothes while the bowling glints which swept through the gorge seemed to chill the marrow in my bones I have no doubt that the sentiments of my companion closely resembled my own, but neither expressed Hiern, partly because talking was undesirable, but far more I suspect because we were too ill humored to say a civil word to anybody At last the rock was reached and we huddled under it for shelter We had been there but a few moments when J eke give a slight start and warned me almost inaudibly to be silent. "There's more than one of them, he whispered, and at the same moment I heard a continuous step not far off Jnku begged me to remain in silence where I was, and left me He sum returned, and telling me there were three or four persons near, bade me follow him with caution It was a wild night, or doubtless my inexperience would have betrayed us to the other party, but they gave no sign of observ- ing our presence Agun Jake bade me wait, and crept away He w w not long gone, but the agonies I suffered during his absence were almost unendurable I trstonehmbwoscrampedandthen another In trying to overcome the sensation by a shot t me meat, I inv anably broke a twig or rolled a few stones together Then I felt as if I would cheerfully give all I possessed to indulge in a slight cough, and just as I was coming to the conclusion that unless a man might sneeze life was not worth having, Jako appeared and told me to follow him quickly. AS we went along the gully I fancied that I heard a subdued chuckle from him repeated several times and when we were some distance from the last halting place he burst into a laugh. " What is it, Jafcol" I asked, "have you found out about it 1" But the only reply I received was, " Tell you all about it at home," with another hearty laugh. The walk back was not more pleasant than the walk there, and we welcomed its end, as wet and weary we entered our hut. " Now, mate," said Jake, " first thing, dry clothes, then a pot of tea, and then the yarn." When at last we seated ourselves, Jake took a long pull at his tea, and thus related his adven- \ tures :-" When I left you first to-night, I followed close on the heels of those fellows and kept up with them till they sat down under the tree where they were when you followed with me. I intended to wait with you till the moon was up, and then follow them, but it struck me that as I was so near I might as well hear what they were saying. So I crept away, as you know, and got within earshot. First thing I heard was the voice of young Smith (he's in next claim, you know), and he says, ' There's no mistake, he's been here for the last four nights, but he's got away somehow 'that my being able to truck him out. Night before last he saw me and cocked his revolver, but I got behind a tree, and he passed quite close. Last night Long Jake was with him, and got rather near, but I swarmed up a tree and he went right under me.' I began to see what was in the wind, and in another minute all was clear enough. The fact is, Charley, your nightly walks awoke Smith's suspicion that you were doing some quiet digging that paid pretty well, and Smith wanted share of it. Smith's presence in the gully suggested the very same thing of him to me. So you see the end of the whole matter is just this, one lot of us has been watching the other, and we're both sold. I never felt so humiliated in my life. Our friends of the west claim continued their watch, it I afterwards heard!, for several nights after that on which our part in the affair ended, but I never again went to see the moon rise over Parker's Gully.
