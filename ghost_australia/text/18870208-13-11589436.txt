BLUNDERING AT THE IC PRINCE'S BRIDGE STATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir--For downright double-barrelled, contrary cussedness, I don't think the arrangements at Prince's bridge station on Saturday afternoon could be beaten. The patent mechanical indicator (which emphasises its information with the counterfeit presentment of a human finger) is supposed to be an apparatus that cannot lie; but had the ghost of George Washington and his tomahawk been around on Saturday, I am sure the mendacious instrument would have suffered considerable damage. Pointing directly to the Dandenong train, it said, "Next train for Frankston, stopping at all stations except Richmond;" whereas the tram referred to started from the opposite end of the platform, and didn't stop, and was never intended to stop, till it got to Caulfield. Reckoning those who remained in the Dandenong train intending to go to Mor- dialloc and Frankston, and those in the Frankston train who intended to alight at one of the suburban stations (there were several in the same carriage with me), it is difficult to estimate the number of passengers who lost their time and their tempers through this absurd conglomeration of inaccuracies.-- I am, &c.;, T.P.L. Feb. 7.
