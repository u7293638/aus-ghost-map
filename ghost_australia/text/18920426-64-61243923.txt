Thus they spoke, throwing words like asBegaÍB, und Nada heard them all, and knew their meaning,' but'she never ceased from smiling. Only Zinita said uothiug, but stood looking at fiada from beneath' her bent brows, while by qhe hand she held the little daughter of Umslopogaas, her child, and with the other played with the beads about her neck. Presently, we passed her, and Nada, knowing well who. this, must be, turned her eye's full upon the angry eyes of Zinita, and held them there awhile. >' No'w,'; what there was in the glauce of Nada I cannot, say, but I know that Zinita, who feared' few things, found something to fear in it. At the least, it was _ she who turned her head away, and the' Lily passed on smiling,''and greeted Umslopogaas with a little nod. ' ' Hail, Nada !' said the Slaughterer. Then he turned to his headmen and spoke : ' This is she whom we went to the caves of the ' Halakazi to seek for Dingaan. O» ! the story is known now ; one told it up at the kraal Umgugundhlovu who shall tell it no more.

Yet three men stepped forward, and of these two were captains, and men whom the Slaughterer loved. With all the people, he looked on them astonished. ?
