WÜGNÄTIÄÄ THE STRIKE. (To the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.) SIR,-Your issue of 23rd October contains a letter signed C. P. Bayly, in reply to Mr. W. E. Abbott, re abore matter in which among other things he speaks of the " tyrannical way the squatters have acted towards selectors being suffl .?cient to make a man's blood run cold," I shall leave Mr. Abbott to deal with Mr. Bayly in the matter of the strike (such things don't trouble me now), and refer only to the passage quoted above. Early in the seventies when in a material form I had a selection on Premier Station, Liverpool Plains, the manager of which was named 0. P. Bayly, and who left no stone unturned to hurt me. It is well known to old hands on the Plains that he had two men (C. W. and J. H.) watching me for six months-the one all day, the other all night in order to catch any of my stock that might be found trespassing. Nor did daylight ever find Mr. B-in bed while this persecution lasted. The records of the Coolah and Tambar Springs Pounds will prove the success that attended his efforts to cruBh me. Can yon, sir, tell me if the C. P. Bayly whose actions I have been reviewing is identical with the C. P. Bayly, who now writes so strongly against the tyranny practised by squatters (or the agents) against selectors ? If he is, and I take the liberty of calling on him some dark night, soon, I may, perhaps, not only make his " blood run cold," but chilly beads of MaranirfiKnn ntand out on his brow and the freezing «tatlows of " dark despair" encompass him. -I am, J *lr' DEWSON'S GHOST.
