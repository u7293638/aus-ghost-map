'h" children attending the new school The day being fine, the children (after being regaled with cake, fruit, lollies, Sic, iSLc ) enjoyed themselves in all kinds of sports, in which they were joined by their pastor and Father Woolfrey, who gave prizes for running, jumping, race, which caused a friendly rivalry between the several competitors. Several hymns having been sung, the children reached home about 5 o'clock, no accident of any kind having occurred to mar the day's sports. Communicated, THE WEATHER-On Newcastle correspondent says that on AY Wednesday morning the wind veered round 1 to the b D , accompanied by steady rain , as the day were on the wind increased to gale, with heavy downpours of rain at midnight the weather moderated, the wind veering back to the westward and blowing in strong gusts Very dull lacking this morning, with every appearance of more rain STATE OF THE COIN TRI -Our Wandering Reporter ina inveterate dated Barraba, May 18th, says -"The country is in so miserable a state that I have been three days getting thus far Since leaving the Rocky River my unfortunate! horse has not had a bit to eat beyond the few mouthfuls he has been able to gather on the road About all the stations and stopping- places every thing is perfectly bare, and no hay or corn to be had so that to keep life in my poor animal I have been obliged to camp for two or i three hours a day whenever I came to any place on the ranges where there was any-not feed, for that there is not but the slightest suspicion of there being the ghost of a blade of dried up grass This is the first place I have reached where hay is obtainable, and I am stopping to-day to get my horse a tucker, as I am told there are the same prospects of starvation for him at Bingera the whole country is an immense waste , cattle so poor that they can hardly crawl, | and looking as bad as if they had gone through a very severe winter Should any bad weather set in you will hear of deaths by thousands I am told also that plouro-pnoumo Dix has again made its appearance in many places, both in this the Liverpool Plains and the New England districts All the nv ere and creeks are dry for a great portion of their length, and what little water there is every here and there is not drinkable, hemp almost putrid from the large amount of decomposed vegetable matter it holds in solution from the thick veil that covers it Children, and even grown people, are suffering from dysentery, owing to the use of the water." CAITTIU or A. LIVE CnocomrP.-Yaamba seems to be a favourite spot for these gentry, who have probably been driven up the river by steam traffic, if we are to judge by the number captured and seen there. The present scaly monster got entangled in the act of a fisherman named Tait, who, upon hauling in a regular swag as he thought of the finny tribe, discovered to his surprise he had got hold of an ugly customer, who was wrapped round and round in the net. As it was dark when he discovered the nature of his game, he wisely left him bagged until the next morning, when he drew him ashore and secured him head and tall with lashings, and towed him to town, where he is to be exhibited The animal measures ten feet in length, and is a splendid specimen of his kind. Norther n Argus, May GRASS AND WATER -The Korthei n Argus (Rockhamp- ton paper) learns from eye witnesses that the country to the West boy and Clermont is comparatively denuded of feed, and that many of the squatters are preparing to temporarily abandon their homesteads in anticipation of the continuance of the drought Water has almost entirely (with the exception of a few favoured places, Orion Downs to wit, and Some Others YO could mention) disappeared from the fate of the land, and several large mobs of sheep are now travelling to save their lives" The visitation which has afflicted the squatter this lost two years is unusual, and unless the Government reconsider their decree about the extension of leases is likely to disgust the followers of pastoral pursuits who should be fostered if only on account of the large revenue they contribute to the national exchequer Unless long and secure leases are granted to holders of country liable to drawbacks of climate, occupants will not be disposed to enforce their leaseholds by either sinking wells or fencing DFSTiatniiF TinE AT ROCKY IMISON -the northern Ax gus states that, shortly before 2 o'clock on Saturday morning. May 12th, the inhabitants were suddenly startled from their beds by the loud pealing of the fire-bell The streets were soon filled with crowds running to the scene of the ronflaajration, which first broke out in the stables and washhouse at the Criterion Hotel, belonging to Mr Nobbs The buildings being all of wood, the flames spread with terrible rapidity, canopied over with a dense column of smoke, which rose and eddied in fantastic wreaths over the burning mass. The fire engine was a long time before it reached Quay street, and then, from the confusion that rev ailed and the want of combined effort, was for a long time Unless The out-buildings soon went down Fortunately, by the efforts of the employees of the Argus, and some others, who arrived early, the billiard- table and boat beneath the verandah were saved The flames crept from the stable to the billiard-room which had a zinc roof, through which the blaze shot in blue and copper-coloured but s, throwing out an intense heat. The roof soon fell in, and not a pail of water had yet been thrown The verandahs connecting the billiard-room with the main building were torn down, and this helped to save it In the meantime, the flames were carried by the wind which blew freshly from the east to the promises of Leigh and Co , produce merchants, in Little Quay-street, and though a little energy in the beginning and a few buckets of water might have saved them, they were soon totally burnt to the ground. The hose was brought to play at last, and the fire being confined, was soon put out A quantity of kerosene and gunpowder stored in their cellars continued to explode, but without doing any injury. About half-past 3 o'clock all danger was over We understand that Mr Nobbs was not insured either in stock or furniture The loss will fall heavily on the Messrs Leigh and Co , as they also were not insured. No serious accident happened, though there were several narrow escapes, Captain Chatfield, of the Boomerang, with his usual cool- ness and promptitude in danger, lent valuable assistance with his crew, and a few more like him, if sooner at the scene of the fire, would have put life into the crowd and saved much valuable property.
