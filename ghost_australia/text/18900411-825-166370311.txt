It was dusty over at Keswick, and occasionally wet before the rain came, and therefore the gastric juice of the soldiers was called upon to chemically transform a mud paste composed of Napier Johnstone and earth. Not that there was any excess. Oh, no! nothing of that about the Militia; but the migrating ground was pene trating and had to be washed down.
