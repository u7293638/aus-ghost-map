A Ghost Story. The Melbourne Herald says : â€” A peculiar case of supposed ghostly visitation has just been cleared up at Stawell. Mrs. Williams, residing in Ligar-street, has for some weeks been very much alarmed by peculiar noises and voices proceeding apparently from various parts of tho house both during night and day. At night also th9 furniture has beon dis placed. On Friday night, January 3, the voice became very offensive in its. remarks, and some neighbours were sent for, who in turn ' sent for the police. When Constable Fitzmaurice arrived, a voice, seemingly from the chimney, asked him what he wanted. The chimney was searched, but no clue to the mystery was obtained, and the voice next came from under the floor. The boards were pulled up ; but nothing was found. The place was kept under surveillance on Saturday, and at night a large crowd, composed of business men and others, assembled at the place, without, however, being able to elucidate the mystery. Sunday also was uneventful, though the sounds were still heard, and the town was in quite a state of excitement. The other night, however,' th'e mystery wis cleared up. Mrs. .Williams has a grand-daughter living with her, a child between 11 and 12 years, and this precocious juvenile has confessed that she is a ventriloquist, and was the cause of the trouble, and so ends the -mystery of the Stawell ghost.
