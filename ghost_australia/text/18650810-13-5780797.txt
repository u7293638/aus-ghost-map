JPRABRAtf BOROUGH ELECTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. I Sirs-I would not ask you to notice what is purely a local matter, were it not that I believe your doing so may have the effect of preventing one of the few well-managed boroughs from taking a step in the downward course which will tend to place it on a level with the lowest. At the election which comes off to-day the three retiring councillors for Prahran offer themselves for re-election Of these, I believe Mr. Crews is safe to be returned ; but an opposition is got up for the seat of one of the other two, Messrs. Stodart and White, which, if not checked by the action of the more respectable portion of the burgesses, will be successful. Messrs Stodart and White are gentlemen-that is one offence and they believe in paying good servants liberally-that is another. Hence the opposition. The person opposed to them is one of whom it would have been worked, previous to the last week, If not even now, by five ratepayers out of six, " And who is Hutchings The party who have put him forward feel confident of success. In this confidence they presume greatly on the Fatty they know to be opposed to them abstaining from voting at their saying, as is too frequently done, " Oh, I shall not take the trouble to vote ; Hutching! hasn't the ghost of a chance." Now, Sir, this is just the point I wish you to enlighten such burgesses upon, Uukss they will take the trouble to exercise the franchise, I know Hutchings has a chance. Let me urge upon them, than, to put themselves to some little inconvenience, even to record their votes to-day. Those electors whom I wish to put on their guard are such as are most likely to see your journal, and therefore it is that I seek through your columns to show them the disgrace they will suffer to come upon the borough if they remain inactive In the struggle to-day. Aug. 9. Yours, c, PRAHRAN.
