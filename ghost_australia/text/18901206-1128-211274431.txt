A MEDIUM EXPOSED, (SAX FBAXCISCO CHEOOTCI.E.) New York, 1st June. â€” Before the wondering eyes of twenty-five witnesses, and aided by the glare from two electric lights, a heartless char latan, who for years has traded and grown rich on the most sacred secrets of the household, was exposed fully and completely on Saturday after- noon in the city of Brooklyn.

In the systematic preparation and the novelty of the conspirators' plans the exposure stands withent parallel in the history of similar events in any part of the world. Two storage bat teries carried in liip pockets by two reporters and connected with incandescent lamps of ten- candle power each, concealed in inner vest pockets, furnished the light that was flashed in the face of the bogus ghost and revealed the cowering medium as the personator.
