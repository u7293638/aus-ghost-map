SEQUEL TO A GHOST STORY. As a venerable minister tells this story it would be ungracious and superfluous to adduce further evidence of its truthful ness. " I went to a new. pariah that year,'' he relates. " In looking about for a house I came upoua very'haudsome resU dencethat was charmingly, situated. But everything indicated that the place had lone; been without a tenant, and I made inquiry. The house was haunted, accord ing to neighborhood jradition, and no one would, rent it.- I saw the landlord, and he was glad to let the place on easy terms. It would bo worth muoh to him if I would exorcise the ghost; placed there by popular superstition. We moved in aud I admit that we hnd a very creepy experience-one that my wife could not long have endured. When everything had settled down to the quiet of the night we would frequently hear the most distressing moans and the sound as of some one walking heavily in the attio. T made several visits to that gloomy part of the house, but could find nothing to account for the uncanny noise. The next night that we were aiiturbed I went up there with a determination to fathom the mystery. And I did it. The moans were produced by the soughing of the wind through the district telegraph wires that wer* numerous on one side of the roof. The ' heavy walking' was accounted for by a loose slate, flapped by the same winds that did tht moaning. Next morning I had the wires removed and the roof repaired." " And that was all T " " Not quite. The landlord at once advanced my rent one hundred per cent."
