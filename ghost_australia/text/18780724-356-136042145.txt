Tho Ghost. Mn. RlAFraonn's entertain sent at the Protes tant Hall, was fairly r.tended last night, and, as usual was very successful, the audience express ing their approval in unmistakable terms. The performance,apsrt from the marvellous illusions exhibited. is a very creditable one, and as the spirits are obedient, the enter tainment as a whole, is one of the most enjoyable we have seen. To.night and to-morrow night are the last upon which the Ghost will appear in Newcastle, and we would advise all who have not seen it, not to miss going. We notice that Mr. Rainford intends giving a matinee on Thursday for the accommodation of schools and families.
