SIR HENRY AND THE REMISSION OP INTEREST TO THE FREE SELECTORS. (Vide Cartoon .) The mighty knight of Faulconbridge, Like Proteus known to fame, Kaleidoscopic in his shapes, And never long the same ; Now, spiritist, beholds a ghost, And < TrAftsnn " wildlv /vries Now in the hands of Pharisees, A Proctor's rights denies. And now a principle's at stake He's silent as the grave, And as we know that he's no fool, Why ! he must be a knave ; He waits to see how puss will jump Ere he begins to act : If any doubt the truth of it, Then Punch will prove the fact. Some Free Selectors, led by knaves Who scheme and agitate, Holding their contracts, paper waste, Wish to repudiate. Faith may be cast unto the winds By those who free select, However others kept their words, In toto they object. All honest men , refuse to break Their faith with state or man ; But every where arch demagogues The flames of faction fan. " We'll pay no rent " the Irish cry, Selectors follow suit : " We'll pay no interest " they say, Yet Henry Parkes is mute. And why is Henry's voice not heard ? He doesn't spare his speech, And milk and watery homilies In Coffee Pub.'s can preach ; He doesn't hesitate to prate About his public acts, And, poet-like, asserting oft, Fiction for stubborn facts. In angry tones he spoke of late To jovial, genial Jack, Whose presence in our Senate House Long be it, ere we lack. ' ' Why did Tom Garrett speak so plain In Camden t'other day, He surely might have put the case In some ambiguous way." Stroking his well-known silvery beard, And with a hearty laugh ; Clovelly's knight began the lord Of Faulconbridge to chaff : " Tom's manly speech has ta'en the wind Sly Hal, from out your sail, Your want of candour now you may, As oft before, bewail."
