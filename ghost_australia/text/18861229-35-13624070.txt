BROKEN BAY. The Newcastle Steamship Company's steamer Coonanbara made another holiday excursion to the Hawkesbury River yesterday. As can easily be understood, the number of excursionists was not so great as that of Boxing Day, but a considerable number availed themselves of the opportunity to visit the picturesque river, and seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the day's outing. The Coonanbara proceeded up the river, as she did on the previous day, to the Hawkesbury railway bridge, where her passengers were allowed a ramble on shore.
