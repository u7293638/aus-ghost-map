OUR SUNBEAM BOOKSHELF. ? New Year's Eve and holiday time one does &>t feel inoim:-d for steading reading. Even short stories have to be veir good if they are to hold our attention. One feels more inclined to dip here and there in some I well-known volume welcoming favourite thoughts and expressions like old friends that we are glad to meet again, as some one said to me' in a fetter 1 received lately. And I think that the thoughts tbat we can take awav from their surroundings and dwell on singly are most welcome. A line "from this poet, a veEse from that, and so on.

Dear Magpie—Do you mind me having another chat with you? I wanted to tell you about the books I have read since last 1 wrote. I have not been able to read much, as my studies took up such a lot of my time. The first book I read was "Little Fishers and their Nets," by "Pansy." It by •he S e A " * ; ^ c d ' ^ r ^ K , that -Jiottih Xe-ct wa- " Vm old--V=»ion^d Girl."

I suppose we have all a rather warm corner in our hearts for reckless, heedless, happy-go-lucky oharactsrs, but anything underhand is simply despi-j cable. One great danger in reading is that tlie interest of the story, or tbe cleverness of the writing, may blind us to the good c-ld distinctions between right and wrong.

Such a long while since I wrote, but I've not quile forgotten the "Bookshelf;" have been .watching its progress with interest. I've not picked out my favourite author yet. Don't care for th* few - read lately, perhips you will recommend some. Will give names of those read lately. "St. Yedas," by Annie S. Swan, which 1 thought was very interesting; "lnielic-e," by A. J. Wilson; very interesting; "Lorna Doon," by H. D. Blackrnore; "ishmael Pcngilly," "As Outcast," nnd "Tiie Birthright," by Joseph Hocking; '-One in Charity," Silas H. Hocking; "Johnny Ludlow** (third seric- sj; "A Life's S^-ret," "The S.iadow of Aslilydtat'* and "Lord Oakbum's Daughters," by Airs Henry Woods. I think "Lord Oakburn's Daughters" the best I've read of hers. * 'Vendetta" and "Thclina," by Marie Corelli. Have vou ever read "Tjielma?" 1 think it s lovjv, only c-nds rather abruptly. "Little Lord Fauntleroy," by Mrs. F. li. Burnett (ne was a Utile love); "Beulaii," A. J. W'iison; "What's Bred in the Bene," Grant Allen; "The Pine Needles," IVcthercll; "A Bid for Fortune," Guy Bjothby; "Aldersyde,"- a border story of seventy years ago, Annie K. Swan; "iiorcthy," 1L E. L.; "Looking Backward," "Miss Luaington's Sister," and "Dr. fieid^nJioiTs Process," tdward Bellamy's works, "Doreen," by Edna Lyall, and just going to start "Donovan,*' by her. See if it's as nice as "Boreal." "Little Women," Louisa M. Alcctt. Joe was the best character in the book—so natural and lively. Think I've told you all ior this time. Am gomg to try and write an essay when I decide which author liked best, and the why. Now, wishing you and tha "Bookshelf' greater , success, hope you will tell me the names of some nice br.oks think suitable, compliments of the season, yours sincerely, Maude Conlon. Age ; 16 V art and 10 months. j iKo, 1 had not quite forgotten vou — 1 remembered your writing. I will try to think of some books for you. x must go through a course of Mane Oorelli, reading carefully, beiore answering your question— so far I must confess that she does not appeal to me. I 6hall be glad to see your essay, though, you know rr ; the competition is over. Now for the books You can hardlv go wrong mth tdna LyaiL loa JiJ "he "Uonovan. Lo you ,ike Scotch books? ii so, there _are_ Beside the Bonnie Briar Bu^i" and "In the Days ^ Auld Barrie's Lang Syne, by Ian Maclareji, also and Tj"" 5 ' "Auld Licbt "A Window Idylls." If in you Thrums, do do not n lite that style, we must be strictly English. Have you read any of Mrs. Gaskell's books? "Wives and Daughters," and. "North and South" are both delightful. Of William Black's it is hard to choose— say "JJiiseis, aad "In Far Lochaber" lusTr^d ^d J etfoyed is "The^^iyTf the Crcslfo " bflonan Dovfe. TtS all the more interesting because the scene is laid in the Soudan — up near Omdurman. Will that do for the present? I should like you to read something besides fiction, though — travel, biography, history, or essays. I am ju-st reading ilrs. Oiipnant's "Literary History of England." I have only glanced at it, but if it is as good as it looks, so far, you will hear more about it. A book of hers that you would like is "Historical Sketches of the Reign of George the Second." Muriel Carter, Jessie and C. Lillie Smith, Trisie Bennett, and •Winnie Dungleson have sent me cards— they give my desk a delightfully Christmassey look—thank you one and all. T.
