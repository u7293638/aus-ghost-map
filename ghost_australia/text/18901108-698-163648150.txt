Sailing Notes. Double Bay regatta afforded some good racing last Saturday. There was a moderate south-easter, 'that took tiff considerably during, the afternoon, and there ?was consequently very little windward work. Iolanthe sailed like a witch, and had an easy win. Astrea won her maiden race after an exciting match with Norna till on the home. turn from fchark Island a luffing match took them under Point Piper, and Norna lost the wind. Abtrea just got through, and beat Jenny Wren, which \- had given the point a wide berth, by 25 seconds. Irex had an easy win in the race tor open ana nflit-aecKea boats, 19ft. to 26ft. JEolus look the ' limited ' race, and Our Way the race for local boats. Our Own won the 16-footers' race. The 14-foot race turmed out curiously. All the boats except Thomas Punch and Shadow, neither oF which finished, were informed by the starter that they would be disqualified for having crossed the wrong line. The matter is to be considered by the committee. We give detail* of the racing elsewhere. Much inconvenience is caused it races are not started to advertised time, more especially in flying starts. At Double Bay the starter was late, and the race far all yachts was not started till a quarter of an hour late, and even then it appears the seven minutes elapsed between the first and second signals. Nothing is so irritating to ytc'itemen as want of punctuality and exactness in these matters. A race for all hired boat?, under the auspices of the Port Jackson Sailing Club, for club prizes, was sailed on Saturday afternoon over the usual Manly course. The entries and handicaps were : —Mantura 24ft., Craigielee 24ft., and Kegina 24ft, scratch; Lottie, 24ft., 30 seconds; Atalanta, 22ft., 3 minutes ; Esmeraldn, 22ft., 4 minutes; Idoihea, 24ft., 4 minutes; Violet, 22ft., Scylla 24ft., Isadore 24ft., The Ghost 24ft., and Gazelle 24ft., 6 minutes each; Our Tom, 24ft, 6 minutes; Maseilia, 24ft., 7 minutes; Imogene 22ft, and lvoraa 22 ft, 10 minutes. With a S.E. breeze and an ebb tide, the boats were sent off to a very good start at 3.15 p.m. Mantura was first away, followed by Resrina; then, came Scylla, Isadore, and Craigieiee, followed by Violet, Massilia. Gazelle, Idothea, Lottie, Atalanta, Iverna, The Ghost, and Our Tom in the order named. After passing Bradley'*, Craigielee, Idothea, and Mantura drew away from the fleet, dlegina, Lottie, and Esmeralda bring some distance astern forming another bunch. Off Quarantine Idothea took up the lead and Mantura ran into second place. The buoy at Manly was rounded as follows : —Idothea, 4h. llm. 36s. ; Mantura, 4h. llm. 37s. ; Craigielee, 4h. llm. 45s. ; Lottie, 4h. 13m. 15e.; Regina, 4h. 14m. 10s. ; Esmeralda, 4k. 14m. 25s. ; Isadore, 4h.

Craigielee cut both Mantura and Idothea out rounding. The wind coming more easterly favoured, Atalanta, Mau tura, atd Lottie. Mantura led round tbe island, with Lottie second, Atalanta third. They finished as follows : — Manlura, 6h. 1 7m. 38s; Lottie, 5h. 20m. 26s.; Ata lanta, oh. 25m. 25s. ; Regina, 5h. 28m. 48s. ; Idothea, 5h. 29in. 40s.; Esmeralda, 5h. 31m.; Our Tom, 5h. 34m. 32s.; Irerna, 5h. 34m. 45s.; The Ghost, 5h. 35m. 25s.; Violet, oh. 36m. 3s.; Scylla, 5h. 37m. 25s. ; Isadore, 5b. 37m. 45s. ; and Maesilia, 5h. 39m. 20s. Thus Mantura, well handled throughout bv Mr. Chris. W ebb, wins tbe first prize ; while Lottie, Atalanta, and Idothes take second, third, and fourth respectively. Tbe steamer Admiral, well filled with visitors, followed the race in charge of the hon. secretary (Mr. A. J. Speers), 'while Messrs. G. HeUings and F. Wright carried out the duties of starter ? and timekeeper respectively. The annual meeting of the Sydney Amateur Canvas Dingy Club was held on Wednesday evening, the 29th ultimo, at Punch's Albion Hotel, Market-street. Mr. G. Scow presided, and there was a good attendance of members. . . The annual report was read and adopted, and the hon. treasurer's statement showed a balance on the right side. The following were elected office-bearer* for the current year : — Commodore, Mr. H. Harding ; vice-commodore, Mr. S. Hellings ; hon. secretary, Mr. E.G. S. Foster; and hon. treasurer, Mr. C. P. M'Conville. The committee will be composed ef one member from the crew of each boat. Tbe club intend holding their first race, a general handicap for all boats, on November 22. The yachting season that has just closed in England has been one of special interest in the racing among the big boats. Thistle heads the list with 22 prizes— 14 first and eight others — out of 41 starts. Iverna conies next with 19 prizes— 12 first and seven others— out of 36 starts. Yarana has 17 prizes— 10 first and seven others— out of 40 starts; and Valkyrie has 13 prizes— three first and 10 ethers— out of 34 starts. Tho Field says :— ' Thistle and Iverna com peted together in 34 matches. Out of these en counters Thistle came in ahead of Iverna 17 times, and the latter headed 'a hie tie a like number of tines, and so far their record is equal. Thistle took 14 prizes from Iverna, 11 first and 3 second ; whilst Iveraa took 13 prizes from Thistle, made mp of 11 first and 2 second. Thistle started in 41 matches, in seven of which Iyerna did not compete. Iverna started in 36 watches, in two of which Thistle did not compete. Tbking the number of starts into consider ation, Iverna's record is a trifle better than Thistle's, but the difference is very smalL Thistle had all the best of it in the early part of the reason, but after Iverna had had her centreboard and case taken out and the slot filled up with lead, she im proved wonderfully, and showed a splendid record.' There has been some excellent racing in the 44 rating class. Deerhound, last year's crack, still holds the pride of place, having 19 prizes— 11 first and eight others, out of 34 starts. Creole comes next with 15 prizes— 11 first and four other out of 24 starts ; and Castanet has 13 prizes— seven first and six others, out of 29 starts. The last two are new boats. Creole proved herself the best to windward in a jib- headed topsail breeze, Castanet in a jackyard topsail breeze, and Deerhoi.nl was best on a reach.
