ENGLISH EXTRACTS. AUSTRALASIAN ISLANDS. (From the Colonial Magazine for December.) New Caledonia-The great land of New Holland, now known as Australia is divided from the large, but comparatively lesser country of New Guinea by the dangerous passage called Torres Straits, which is the route during the periods between the months of May and October of shipping bound from the Colony of New South Wales to the various ports of India, China, and Islands in the Indian Ocean On the eastern side of this route are situated a vast number of interesting islands which from the increasing number of British settlements and European population on the four several coasts of Australia, Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand, will render them, at no distant period, of paramount importance The countrj situated farthest South is called New Caledonia to the north east of which are the valuable groups of the New Hebrides and the Tierra del Espiritu Santo or Land of the Holy Ghost. Farther north lies the Charlotte Archipelago to the northwest, the islands of the Louisiades. New Britain and New Ireland lie yet farther north to the eastward of New Guinea winch together with the numerous surrounding islands are separated from Australia by Torres Stioits the difficulties of whose passages for the ingress and egress of shipping are supposed to increase annuillv, from the continual accession of reefs forming by the unceasing submarine opeiations of the coral polypi, which consist of layers of cellular coral, that serve 03 tenements for the animals, and are built one above the other, until the emb mknicnt is formed even with the surf ice of the ocean, when the insects expire on being exposed bj Ion tides to the mr Hie sconie, vegetable debris, and materials of floating wreel, arc arrested in their piogress bv this marine barrici, to which is daily added fresh mutter 1 he innumerable flocl s of birds nbounding in these latitudes eotivej the ripe seeds of va nous plants indigenous to the surrounding isles and the m un lands of Australia and New Guinea, which, deposited ni their flecos are ejected on the incipient is'nnd and in time are thron u on the rising shore additional muk weeds mid soil giving a nourishing vigour to nul the growth of the trees thus planted by its chirping visitors lhcsc coral banks, (termed shoals, while uncx posed in the ocean ) are found from one quarter of a mile to nearly three bundled miles in continuous length with n breadth remarkably narrow and disproportion ite Hie layers are formed with astonishing meet), rising perpen cheularlj from the lovi-st depths of the ocean to ils surface, m such a manner that a ship of the largest bin then might lie (but foi duugcr ol contact) touching the reef with bei bows and jet have seventy fathom at the stein lins species of coral is most to be apprehended hy the manner, notwithstanding us bnltlcness «hen newly formed, ns its slimp surface crushes any substance propelled forciblj against it New Caledonia one of the lurgcst of the Australasian Islands, was discovered bj Captain Cook in 1774 Its position is north west half west nnd south cast half south, abóíttSGO miles in length, nnd nn average breadth of from twentj ftietothirtj miles extending from 20 ° 10'to 22° 30'south lat and 161° 19 to 161° i2 east longitude, the reefs by which the islands and us lesser mountnnous dependences nre bounded extend from 17° 51' to 23° "i south lat nndluO0 17'lol0j° G east long A tham of mountains stretches throush the extreme length of the island, cm n oneil on either side by ranges of lesser mountain hei0hts, whose sterility arc unrelieved by the central chain, which is in general entirel) denuded scaiccly admitting even of stunted vegetation New Caledonia is entirely encircled with coral i îecfs, formed bj the bus) pol)pi winch serve lo piotcct the main land from the mounta nous | seas, that gather in tempestuous vvcalhei, and dnsji with astounding fone against the manuc embankment, letting the foaming surf I to a great height lhese reefs, extend thirty miles distant fiom the south point of the island, and on the northern extrcnutj ihej end in a circular foi m no less than sixtj miles from the land Within the reefs the ennlosod sea is al ivaj s tianquil, it is studded with islands of high perpendicular elevation, evidentlj a continua tion of the mounfui rnn0cs of the larger islands whose bases be under water lrom the general denuded nppcr ram c of those eley ated heights it lins been supposed that a diminution of ñiattci is continual!) taking place Some of the islands between the mam and the outer reefs are somewhat large The Isle of Pines is the most fruitful in its produce, and possesses a soil superior to that of the main; it derived its name from the noble pine-trees, fitted for the purpose of the shipwright, that abound in the island, from which Captain Cook procured se- veral for his ship the Resolution. This island is about thirty miles in circumference, those named Bolabia, Maulin, Reconnisance, Surprise, and Huon, all lying to the northward, are of lesser size. On the island of Poudioa was in- terred the remains of Captain Kermadec, who commanded the Esperance, with which, with the Recherche, under the orders of Admiral D'Entrecasteaux, were despatched by the French provisional government in search of La Perouse. The northern portion of the island is called Balade by the aborigines : the western coast is the most to be apprehended by the mariner, as the winds prevailing from that quaiter, often blow with irresistible violente, rendering it a lee.shore, and as such, it vicinity should be avoided. The islands from N. N. 15. to K. N. E. are very numerous, exclusive of large detached masses of rock, barely above water. The mountains towards the southard are of least elevation to the northward; hills, of lesser height than the mountain chain, rise in form of an amphitheatre, entirely destitute of useful vegetation. Torrents rushing with formidable foi ce, cuti y away every intei vening burrier, that serve tq obstruct the progress of the destructive clement; and lesser pascadas, ¡101,1c of lyhjeh fall from n towering height, sorvo to irrigate the lands below, which bordering the si n shore to the eastward, are flit and extensive; the mountains also present deep gorges and lavincs hollowed by the devastating toi rents.

The former navigators state them to be a pleasing, affable race of people, unlike the inhabitants of the South Seas generally, who are so much addicted to thieving and infidelity in their domestic compacts, that the females, though given to coquetry, are nevertheless impregnable among the New Caledonians, anil that the conduct of the people generallj is unobtrusive, retired, and well b-haved The character given bj the French gentleman is totally different the men are stated to have watched every opportunity to put then predatory habits into practice, and in making a bargain with the Europeans they would frequently run away, taking with them the articles presented for barter, with such velocity as rendered pursuit fruitless The stature of the males is from five feet four inches to six feet, but very few persons attain a larger growth , their complexion is that of deep brown, or chocolate colour and many of them approach to black The features are somewhat harsh, the nose flattened, the cheek bone protuberant, the eyes sunk under a pro jecting forehead, and the lips thick The hair is bushy and frizzled of a jet black , the beard is stiong Hie method of pulling np the latter bj the loots is sometimes resoitcd to, others leave tins pntnerchnl sjmbol to luxuriate from the upper bp dominant Hie hair on the head is worn diflerentlj, it being cqunllj faslu onnblc to have it tied up in a bunch on the crow u, Combs composed of sticks i educed to the si/e of knitting needles tastilj made fast together, arc placed in the side of the head as an orna- ment , they are generally about ten inches long lins method of «coring similar combs was for merly a usage common among the South Sea islanders, but has since become repudiated m favour of European ornaments I lie dress of the men consists of a piece of stitt m itting, formed fiom split reeds, which partly covers the bark of the head and is fastened bj a cord round the neck, the back and sides of the wearer being covered by it, but the bod) in fiontis left exposed A large lenf is also mode use of, which forms n primitive article of dress similar to the matting, it is fastened at the waist When the chiefs (who are called Arikis) are able to procure from the whale ships paper, or a substance Ihnt answeis the purpose, they make a kind of bonnet, circular in form lil e n drum, open nt either end These articles of dress are seldom made use of, the men preferring to perform their allotted tasks m peifcct nudity The dress of the females consists solely of ajupe or apron manufactured from the filaments of the plantain stems winch is worn round the waist, and scarcely reaches eight imlics bcjontl the hip It has the appearance of a mnnbci of small black roi tis, fastened to gelber and scantily serves the purpose of that concealment nhich nature has dictated to the most civilized of our species.
