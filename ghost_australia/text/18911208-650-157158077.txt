PERSONS ! 'I resigned because I would not allow myself to bo dictated to by a set of Persons called the labor party,' shrieked Parkes at Kiamn, as he mopped the perspiration of vexation of spirit from his furrowed brow, and posed before an old woman, three tourists, a blind man, a policeman, and a dog as the injured party from over the way, the one all enduring and uncombed genin3 of New South Wales. The Mokanna of the colony whom Lady Windeyer, of petti coat government fame, described as the Moses of Australia — Moses kept his people forty jears in a wilderness — appeared in the town whence he evolved: tho vanishing ghost trick and, though not intending it., gave a big support to the Dibbs Government by abusing the labor party in a way no labor party are likely to forget. ' Persons ! ' cried Mrs. Gamp and her friend Betsy, wlios once referred to in that abrupt style. ' Persons ! ' — Parkes has .offended the labor party beyond recall. Ho praised them when at North Shore a few months ago, sneered at them when be resigned office, and now, at Kiama, calls them ' Persons,' with an accent on the left nostril. The labor party won't forget Parkes for that, depend upon it.
