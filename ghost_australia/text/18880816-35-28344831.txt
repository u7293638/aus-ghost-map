one hist night-neither tho play of Hamlot nor his mother should give room for misunderstanding on this subject Looked nt from this pomt of view, Mr Warner's Hamlet was an almost unexceptionable suecess, though, if there was a blemish on his rendition last night, it was, por hups, a suspicion of an appeal to the gallery m the "mad" scraps of dialoguo, and a deliberation and want of spontaneitv about tho first lines of his dolivory of the well-known speoihes with which the drama abounds After the first line or two, however one could not fail to bo struck with Mr "Warner's purity of enunciation, and tho delicate fineness of tho olocutionary (ouebes with which he lightened up these speeches "lo be, or not tobo" and tho follow ing lines were an instance of this, as tho passago beginning " O what a rogue and peasant slave am 1," in the second scone of tho second net, ufter Ilniniot is left alone hy Kasoncranf/ and Guildenstern, was n fine ox amplo of impassioned invectivo
