' . ? . ;. j WILLIAM ANDERSON, alias Arthur Floyd, the , convict, who escaped from the Rocks road gang, at Nelson (N.Z.), on Friday laet, and was captured on Saturday, was sentenced to .ftnurteen days' bread and water and nine months 'in addition' to bis present. . sentence. Alfred Eilis, who attempted to scape at the same time but. was: shot down by the warder, was seritenc¬©a to twerity-fourhoure' close confinement and two months' addition to his sentence. A FINE ap&ainen; of protectionist reasoning' (says the Melbourne 'Argus') is brought to light by Mr. George Eastgate, ini the following letter: 'Of all the ludicrous blunders which, protectionists are constantly making, surely 'that Into which Mr. Samuel Mauger helplessly floundered ait Bairnsdale on 'Wed- nesday last is the. most laughably absurd and en tertaining. In order 'that I may to. the utmost de-' gree be just and fair towards Mr. Manger, I will take my quotation entirely from the pages of the protectionist journal. In its report on Friday last ot Mr. Manger's remarks I find these words: 'He said, rtmling with the results of the protective policy upon the skilled industries in Melbourne, that, whilst carpentens and. others had been in distress, the back bone and support of the community had been the protected trades, such as the bootmakers. As to the cry that -the fanners were obliged to pay en hanced prices, which went into the. pockets of -the bloated manufacturers, he pointed out that hoots were never, cheaper tian to-day. Internal competi tion had ^o brought 'down prices that labor was being sweated, and f Ithef farmer could get what he wanted too .cheaply. He could actually get boots cheaper than the duty itself.' The boot trade is, it will be 'observed, one of the prosperous 'backbone trades of Melt¬ªurne,~a conspicuous 'trophy of protection,' but, unfortunaitely, it is in a wretched condition, on ac count of extremely low prices and miserable 'sweat ing* wages!' . A ' GHOST scare,' which ha^ occasioned con siderable amusement in Ballaigit (Via), occurred the other night among a number. of the cabmen plying for hire between the city :and the new- cemetery. It. was approaching midnight, and the Jehus had drawn their vehicles up in line at the cemetery gates preparatory to setting out on their last return trip to Bailarat.- The night was dark and squally, .and one of the drivers, gazing. Jsstlesaly into the ceme .tery, was startled to see,- as he believed, a moving figure carrying a lighted lantern; which flashed 'lik'e a beacon on the esa coast' Addre^Ing Ms mates in tihe rank, he cried 'ouit-r-' As I live, boys,, see - the ghost ovier lyonder. Let us all- eeoo.t home as' feat as we can.' Several jumped into their vehicles on seeing the apparition, and; drove oS poet haste towards the city. * . Two 'brave, fellows,' however, , remained to 'lay out' the ghesk Entering the ceme tery grounds they. .wended .their way along one of the winding paths in the graveyard, when the glare of the light 'widened 'out,' and they came to a.-- stand still to hold e consultation, and a was decided to 'report the ghost' -to the sexton, Mr: Eattray, who .resides within the cemetery enclosure. Roused from his slumbens,- he ridiculed the fears of the cabmen, one of whom‚Äî a nervous Hibernian‚Äî assured Mr. Ratixay that a ghost wais 'walking around,' and described its get-up and dimensions vividly. The sexton invited the cabby to, 'come and see.' 'No fear,' was the reply, 'we'll not go up towards thaf thing with the lantern.' On reaching the gates th^ sextou, sure enough, \eaw a kind 'of illumination away back some 500 -yards' in the cemetery, and, striking a direct line towards It* he waiked up to find that the supposed 'ghost' was merely a newly erected headstone of poldehed marble, on -which were reflected tie rays of a street lamp, fully a quarter of a mile from the cemetery. fence.
