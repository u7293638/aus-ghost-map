Rumour has it— but then' Dame Rumour is proverbially' an ,? unreliable jade— that some of the torpedoes laid in the channels leading to the anchorage in Hobson's Bay during the late ' war acare' are ' missing,' and ,that at least three of these death deal ing appliances are still snugly ensconced in their resting place ' somewhere about Port Phillip-Bay .--- The question asked in the Assembly by Mr. Gaunson no doubt had some connection with the report, and the reply vouchsafed by the Chief Secretary is ?hardly of a kind calculated to allay anxiety. The honourable gentleman point blank refused to answer his querist. Now as the n*rayed warlike appliances are of the kind ? known as 'contact mines,' that explode on being touched' by any passing ship, it will seriously detract from the pleasures of the marine excur sions indulged iri from time to time by honourable members ' of the ' Legislature, when these gentlemen reflect- that at any ^moment they -may be -hurled into mid-air; by one of the contrivances meant exclusively for our Russian friends: Until the assurance is given that our legislators are not to be sent on an involuntary trip ' skywards dur ing one of their marine jousts, there should be no more trials pf the sea-going qualities !6f the Cerberus or Nelson. Although' some of our law-makers might with ad vantage to the colony bespared, we could ill afford to;] lose all our Lords and Com mons' at 'one :feil swoop.' Unless bur ' senior' military officer, Colonel Sargood, sees tb it, he may develop into a Guy Fawkes of the maritime order, and achieve a success where his; prototype failed. '. The Eev. Mr. Dowie's 'experiences' promise ! to be of a varied' character. A' :8hort time since he was 'abased' by being compelled to languish for a: month within the precincts of the Melbourne Gaol, in default of paying a fine inflicted upon him for infringing the Unlawful Processions Act. ' Now he ' has very1 riearly been frexalted'' in a fashion more rapid than pleasant. A charge' of some explosive Bub 'stance^whether guripowder or dynamite is not yet known-^was placed under the reverend gentleman's '? meeting-house in ? Johnson-street, Fitzroy, and fired just aftier : the pastor and his adherents had retired ?from' the building. In'lis wildest moments of religious fervour) Mr.1 Dbwie can surely never have contemplated such a rapid ascent to 'the realms above' as that from which he so' narrowly escaped. '? ? ?? '
