A BENDIGO GHOST. MELBOURNE, Sunday, September 4. During the past ten days a "ghost" has been promenading the outskirts of Bendigo, much to the terror of the women folk, but the efforts to capture the perpetrator of the scare have been unsuccessful. One evening the contents of a shotgun were discharged at the jokist, apparently without doing any damage, and a couple of evenings later a plucky young woman threw a stone at him, and the "ghost" retaliated by brutally striking her in the face with his fist. About 2 0'clock yesterday morning a tramway employe saw a figure in white staring at him from behind a fence. The employe was armed with a revolver, but was too frightened to use it.
