It is a storey-and-a-half oottage, with a large expanse of roof, which, covered with porous, utpaint«d shingles, seems to repel tbe sunshine that now strikes full upon it. The apper and lower blinds on the main building, at well as those on the extensions, are tigitly closed. The sun appears to beat in rain at the case ments of this silent hoise, which has a curiously sullen and delant air, as if it had desperately and successfully barricaded itself against the approach of morning; vet if one were standing in the roam (bat leads from the bed-chamfer on tbe ground floor-the room with the Utticed window one would soe a ray of ligkt thrust through a ohink.of the shutters, aid pointing like a human finger at an object wkioh lies by the hearth.

The theory of enioido hid obtained momen tary oredence early ia tho morning, and one or two fitiii along to it wilb (he tenacity that characterises persons wbo entertain few ideas. To acoept this theory it was necessary to believe (hat Mr, Shackford had ingeniously hidden *ha weapon After striking himself dead with a single blow. No, it was not ituoide. So far from intend iog to take bis own life, Mr- Shaokford, it appeared, bad made rather earefal preparations to live that day. The breakfast table bad been laid over night, the Mali left xeady for kindling in the Franklin atoye, and a keule, filled witb water to be heated lor bU tea or coflae, stood on tbe be*rtb. Two faoti bad eherply demonstrated them selves-first, that Mr, Shaokford bad been mqrdered j and, second, that tbe spar to tbe erims bad been tbe possession of a sum of money which tbe deceased was supposed to keep ia a strong-box in bis bedroom, Tbe padloek bad been wrenehed open, and tbe lesa valnablo eontente of tbe ebeat, ehiefly papers, seattered over tbe earpet, A memo raadam among tbe papers seeme! to specify tbe respective soma in notes and gold tbat bad been deposited in tbe box, A document of some kind bad been torn into minute pieces, and thrown into the waste basket. On elose lorn tiny a word or two here and there revealed tbe fact tbat tbe document was of a legal obaraoter. The fragments were pat into an envelope, and given in charge of Mr, Shackford's lawyer, wbo placed seals on tbat and on tbe drawers of an escritoire wbicb stood in tbe comer, and contained other manosoripis, Tho instrument with wbioh tho fatal blow had been dealt-for the autopsy ahowed that there had been bat ono blow-w*e not only loot discoverable, hat the fashion of it ie&nA; cosjeotxae, Tho sb*pe of tfie wound did not indicate tha uw o! any implement known to the jorora, several of whom v«» skilled m^ckmiata. Tka wound wa« m inoh and three-quarters ia length, and very deep at the oitremitiea; ia the middle it scarcely penetrated to the cranium. So peculiar a cut could not have been produced with the claw part at a hammer, bcoauso tha claw i« always curved, Mid the iaeuion straight. A list cl«w, snch aa is used ia opening packing c^sca, waBeuggtBteJ. A collection of tho several siioa manufactured waa procured, but nona coirfljponded with tha wound; they were either too wide or too natron. Moreover, the out was aa thin as the blade of a 0.160 knife. "That was never done l>y any toJ ia these parte," declared Stevens, tho for ot the finishing shop at Sloouw'e.
