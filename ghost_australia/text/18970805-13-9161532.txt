THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1897. The further the federal debate pro- ceeds in the Assembly the more reason there is to doubt the good faith of many of the nominal friends of the Australian cause. Yesterday witnessed a surpris- ing volte-face on the part of Mr. Isaacs. Clause 55 is the very heart of the bill. It sets forth the now famous "Sydney " compromise" as to the money power of the two Houses, arrived at in 1891, and reaffirmed in 1897. Both in Ade- laide and in Sydney it was carried by narrow majorities, the small states fighting with determination against the restrictions it imposes on the Senate. For no other existing Council of the states is limited in its action as the proposed Senate will be. It looked as though the compromise would be defeated at Adelaide, but at the last moment one or two delegates were in- duced to see that the larger states could not concede both equality in re- presentation and in money power. But to ask the smaller states to go one inch further is absolutely futile. The danger is that the delegates who gave way will be swayed by the attacks which are being made upon them in their own colonies for their conciliatory action. The small states want the full rights conceded to the small states in America. In Germany, and in Switz- erland. They do not obtain them. And there undoubtedly was an under- standing in the Convention that the smaller states should be pressed about clause 55 no further, but that it should be allowed to stand; and yet yesterday Mr. Isaacs was a party to the striking out of all the subsections providing that each money bill shall be sent up by itself, and that tacks—or the joining of several measures together—shall be illegal as well as unconstitutional. In- stead of defending these propositions— to which he consented at Adelaide—he abandoned them. What renders the situation more ex- traordinary is that the House had no notice of this intention. The Govern- ment has circulated its amendments. It proposed to alter the verbiage of clause 55, but it left "the bargain," as Sir George Turner described it, loyally alone. Why then the breach of faith? Mr. Isaacs feebly says that the use of the word "laws" instead of "proposed " laws" or "bills" in the subsection is objectionable. This is indeed a trans- parent quibble, for Mr. Isaacs could make the change of phrase if he so desires without a soul objecting. He says Sir John Forrest hurried the Con- vention. The fact is that Sir John Forrest and the West Australian dele- gates left before the subsections were carried. Mr. Isaacs treats as a calumny the comment that he adhered to the Convention bargain until he was warned by Corner members that there would be a final break from him unless he gave them his support. Per- haps so. The true reason may be further ahead. In consenting to vital alterations, Mr. Isaacs is preparing the way for joining the wreckers later on. He is well aware that alternatives in the "Sydney compromise" have not the ghost of a chance in the Convention, and when they are rejected there he will be able to say that, as the Victorian overtures have been set aside, he washes his hands of the business— though these overtures were not made in good faith. At the last moment Mr. E. D. Williams and Mr. D. Syme will have Mr. Isaacs in cordial co-operation with their precious committee. Unless we do the hon. members an injustice, that is the port for which he is steer- ing—as the Turkish admiral entrusted with a squadron sold it and sailed it into the enemy's port. How else account for solemnly making a bargain at Adelaide, for voting for it there, and repudiating some of its most important provisions on the floor of the House? Once the "Sydney compromise" was broken into, the labour members made short work of it, and, so far as the Victorian Assembly is concerned, scarce a vestige of the compact remains —though everything depends on adher- ing to its terms. All through the evening the wreckers' game was made clear. It is to make the Assembly's bills as unlike the Con- vention measure as possible, and ulti- mately to declare that the sacrifices asked for are too great to be made. The patriotic Australian would seek to minimise differences; the Assembly is being induced and inflamed to accen- tuate them. Mr. McLean—a worthy colleague of Mr. Isaacs in the business —was eloquent about "no compromise." And all his oratory meant "Keep on " the border duties. Perish Aus- " tralia." A 'vert of official rank is a somewhat rare phenomenon in either Protestant or Roman Catholic churches. A gentleman who is old enough, and educated enough, and sufficiently endowed with active convictions, to have attained rank and position as a teacher in any given church, has usually made the choice of his creed for life. His convictions ought, indeed, to have some fixity. So the spectacle of an Anglican canon i enouncing the church of lils jouth and eailv mlnistit and exchanging the Thiitv nine Vrtleles for tho Catechism of the Council of Trent and being received into the paiei uni embrace of the Roman GitlioIIc Church is somewhat un usinl Aichblshop Cnir no doubt con tempiites bis new conveit with com placent exultation He is not meiclv a brand plucked fiom the burning ho Is the sjmbol of a contioveisial tilumph over riotestantism in geiienl Bishop Goe we may lu sun ic"aids Canon Gilgson who Ins lust cbmgcd lils ecck slastloal co it with a suit of i-loomv pitt He is a foolish «¡hoop who lins left the fold a dislov ii soldlei who Ins foisnl en his ilag But Vichblsliop Cm need not be gunlgpil lils tiluiiipli If say a leading uiembpi of the Society of Tesus picsented himself next week it Iiisliopscomt announcing lu stentorian tones his deslio to renounce the ti roi s of Rome and to bore celved luto the aVnghein fold' would not Bishop Goe tecehe linn with a geueious waimtli not unqu llifled bj a tlnsteued bcnso of coutrovirslal tiluuipli?
