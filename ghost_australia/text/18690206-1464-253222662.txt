The Great Man-Goose. It would appear that Mr. Parkes, after a hard struggle, having been compelled to " give up the ghost " and "cut spirits," has gone in for a new sensational element altogether, and true to his sinuous policy and serpentine proclivities, it has assumed the pleasing form of snakes. Yes, the Parkesian Villa includes amongs its Lares and Penates a few of these interesting reptiles, if a hair-standing- on- end report lately published in one of the dailies is to be relied on, and nightly do they do battle on the domestic Brussels with the "Wonder ful Mon -goose â€” own brother to the one that went to England, and the only other one to be seen alive !" It must be a pleasing and edifying sight to see the great man tearing himself away from Polemical life, and devoting himself to the instruction of his olive branches in practical natural history. Visitors need be under no apprehension of personal danger, Mr. Parkes having learned from Professors Mac, Benedict, and Meyers a perfect antidote against the attacks of reptiles. Faithful to the memory of his "first love," it is said that our ex-Colonial Secretary insists that the interesting little snake- killer shall be known on his establishment by no other name than the Man Ghost !
