Mr. Sheridan's Reply to Protectionist. TO THE EDITOR. SIRâ€”.1 am rapidly becoming in need of " protection." Is " Protectionist" the ghost of Robinson Crusoe, or of a Chinese Mandarin?"

It is clear therefore "logically" that either I am not " rabid " or not a " Free-trader," Which is it? I am, &c.;, JOHN B. SHERIDAN.
