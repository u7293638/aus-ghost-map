SITTING Di THE FIRE. [AN OLD MAN'S sPvE EL] GLESOMUl children were we not? Sitting by the fire, Euddy in its glow, Sixty summers back Sixty years ago! Laughing voices filled the room; Oh ! the songs we sungl When the evenings Imrried by-. When our hearts were young. Pleasant faces watched the flame Eyes illum'd with mirth And we told some merry tales, Sitting round tihe hearth I Sitting by the ire, Ruddy in its glow, Sixty summers baok Sixty years ago ! Beauty stooped to bless us once ! Sitting by die fi, Happy in its glow, Forty summers back Forty years ago! Words of love were interohng'd, Maiden hearts we stole; And the light aaection throws, Slepton every soul! Oh! the toumr went tying past Hours of pr~oeless worth; But we took no note of Time, Sitting ountd the heartk ! Sitting by the fire, Haepy in its glow, Forty summers baok Forty years ago ! Oh! the nights--the nights we spent Sittning by the ire, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back Twenty years ago! If the days were days of toil, Wherefore should we mourn, There were shadows near the -hine ?Fowers with the thorn! And we still can recollect Evenings spent in mirth Fragments of a broken life- Sitting round the hearth 1 Sitting by the 'e, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back Twenty years ago g Barren age, and wither'd world 1 Oh! the dying leaves, Like a drizzling rain, Falling round the roof Pattering on the pane ! Frosty Age, and cold, cold World.! Ghosts of other Days, Trooping past the faded fire, Flit before the gaze! Now the wind goes soughing wild, O'er the whistling Earth~ And we front afeeble lame, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by tle fre, Watching, in its glow, Ghosts of other Days Trooping to andfro!
