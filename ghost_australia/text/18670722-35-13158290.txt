I MR. PICK, THE GOLD MINER. LETTER II. From the Sydney Mail, July 29 Old Niiooet (continued). I hat was a close shave, says the chap, about ten minutes after I he got him on the bank, and he to come round so as to be able to talk , ' I i most give it up one time " " Well, says I, "it child t look payable first going off It's a cooker with the horse " Bad luck to him ' says he " Of all the de- restful animals as ever I come across that there be ist is the most deceitfulness to think as he should go and turn over just in the middle of the worst part of it, and me that knows the river so well, too ' "Poor brute, says I, he did his best, but he had at the strength in him. He was too poor "Poor sombre ' that's just another piece of his deceitfulness Look here mate If you were to feed that there horse upon corn and eaten hay every day for a month, till there was only a straw between him and lasting, he would t get fat It was in his nature ' "Did you ever try it >' says I "Not so green, mate,' says he, "but it aint no good "It's just his gammon He wants to do the injured animal and make the people think as lies ill used He is gone, under ain't sorry that In well falls of him, for he never did nobody credit as ever find him It's only the saving as I care about losing There was a pair of blankets in that swag that cost me two notes only six weeks ago, besides my togs ' Never mind, says 1, will go with you in the morning and look after them He may be pulled up somewhere ' ' It ain't unlikely, says he, "and so I'm going now, I am I am a going to leave that there swag to be picked up by nobody else but me, I can tell you The bill ; that I'd put down to the fire had been boilings good bit, so I got the chap to stop till we had a pot often and bits of bread and meat, and then he seemed to have picked up as strong as ever see him and me, we went down the river, to try if we could find out any thing about the horse Thinking it might be handy I coiled up my windlass rope and hung it over his shoulder We went down about two mile below where I d dragged the chap out By this time it was very dark m amongst the trees on the river bank, though it was a clear starlight night over bend Vi wherever there was a strong ripple or a surge of the current, there we searched as well as we could in the darkness and distance for the carcase of the horse, because of course we never thought to see him again alive as we were fumbling along through the dark trees on a place where the river banks were lower, and the flood had come up and spread over the bit of a line that was formed there what should we hear but a little bit of a low whinney, but such a ghost of a one that if we had it been nil attention we should never have heard it "There, says the chip, "Blow me if there is at that there prccioiiB varmint I el know his voice in a hundred ' Sure enough, when we came to look closely, we could see him there, pulled up among a heap of drift wood, ns had settled between two trees that grew pretty close together I could see by the way he d fixed himself that he was standing , though he looked precious shaky and as if he wouldn't be able to hold out much larger " How on earth are we get him s ' says the chap " It might be done, ' says I, for, as I see he was standing, I knew he must be out of the real bed of the river, though the current was setting strong along between where he was and where we were "He might be got out with some risk ' says I " I've had risk enough for one innings, ' says he, " so I steamed down here till the river goes down I m sure of my swag ' "And you'll leave your poor devil of a horse to drown afore your eyes, says I, in such a voice as let him know we at my private opinion of him was " Look here, mate, says he, " iv e had one ducking to night, and it was just by a squeak that I got out of it, and I can t a going to try another, below ' ' But the poor dumb thing there, that has called on unforseen will perish, says ' Let him, says he, " Its him or me for it but if you are so precious spooney over the brute, go you under it on Get my swag ashore first that's all I ask you, and then if you get the horse after, you may have been there "so human creature ever yet asked me for help that I don t try my best to give it, says I so give me the horse and toxins and help me from the shore, and I'll try it " All right mate, says he " put in a drive ' "With that I sets down and begins unstr arding the rope The strands were pretty strong, as they had about nine arms in each of em there were four strands, and when 1 d knotted these together, I had a rope four times as long as before, and quite strong enough for what I wanted "When I done this, 1 old with six jumper trousers, and boots, and there I was in i my singlet and draw ers quite enough toggery in case of a difficulty, though I didn't expect any, and I took off my other things, more to keep em dry than any- I thing else when I tells the cove to keep hold of one end of the rope, and I takes the other myself, and then in I goes When I was in the water did seem to come down most precious wicked, and I didn't like it half so well as I thought I should I hide t gone more than twenty steps before I found out what had brought the current there, for I makes one step and then down I goes wallop, out of depth There was a channel worn by some old flood, and now the water was coming as savage through that as ltwisinthe main stream I had all my work to do to fight in a way across, especially as I was took unawares, and got the worst of the first round Lucky for me, it wasn't very wide and, after a sharp tussle, I got to standing ground again, though the water was up to my armpits pretty hills I goes along very cautious, and it was just as much as I could do to get to where the old horse stood, the driftwood was packed up so about the trees If I don t back my shins and poke my ribs in amongst it all, it is a caution for of course, I could see what was under the water The first thing I do 1 was to get off the swag but carry it I could t It was soaked with water, and so precious heavy, that it would have swamped me, so I tied the rope to it and floated it, and when I got to where the current was running, I sung out to the chap to haul it ashore "When that was right, he throws me back the end of the rope, and then the worst part of the work begun Hack I goes to the horse Poor devil, he whinnied after me when I went away with the swag, as if he was asking me not to leave him in that he, and he whinnied when I came back, as if he was thanking me for sticking to him " I'll do all I can for you old man, says I, patting him on the neck , " keep your pecker up, and well fight through it Peter Pick um. t the man to desert a living thing, if it was only a cat, at such a time as this I give you my word that that beast understood what I said, for I'm hanged if he did t freshen up Perhaps it might be that he had the weight of the Bwig off him but whether or no, he knew that I meant saving him, and nothing else It was no easy job getting him out of that driftwood, and I had close upon an hour's work dragging out some limbs, breaking off others, and the river roaring and rushing all the time However, I managed it at last, and then I received the end of my rope through the rings of the bit, and begun to lead the horse out by the way I come He staggered and stumbled amongst the dead timber, and from weakness and regular done-up ness, but I stuck to him and held him up, and encouraged her with a word ever j now and then And poor beast he did his best, and there really seemed to be a hopeful I nee of way about him, as if he d have end if he could, that he was all right, now I'd took him in tow When I come to the edge of the deep water, I gives the word to the chap on dry land to haul a way, and haul he does md off me and the horse goes, striking out as hard is we could the poor devil was nigh done, but he hit out as game as a pebble, for I held on to him and kept his head up stream, and as I was on the upper side of him, that kept something off him, but if it hadn't been for the rope, we must have gone But what with my holding him and the chap pulling, we got over the pinch It was only some eight or ten yards, but it so baked me that I had to stand and blow, when I got standing room He staggered through the water and on to the grass and then down he went regularly done up I did all I could for him I cut some tussocky grass and rubbed him well, to warm him a bit, and made some water warm, and put a handful of salt in it, and Riveithim, and that seemed to do him good And then I cut off some slices of damper and gave him, and that seemed to do him more good still I must tell you that the cove stuck to his bargain, and went off with his swag, after wringing the water out of it, to the public at Muckerawa "When I found that the horse tucked in the damper, I knew he was right, and as I was regular used up, I turned in between the blankets and was fast asleep before you could say ' good night The first thing 1 does when I wakes in the morning into look after the horse There he was all right, standing up and feeding, not a hundred yards away and the moment I gets up he comes walking up to me-he d have cantered I know, if he 'd had the go in him and he puts his nose into my hand. If you believe me, the rain pumped up into my eyes when he did it. It was the only way the poor brute had of thanking me for saving him, but he meant it and I knew it, and he wanted me to know it "Well," says I, and I pat him on the neck, " you and me have come together in a queer way , but now we are together w I'll stick to each other, and we are on a part again easy " And he rubbed his nose again my arm, as if that was his way of signing the agreement for himself till he got round all right, and we haven't parted company since, and we don't mean too either Nobody but ourselves knows what we think of each other, but just let me say this, only you do a good turn for and one from a man downwards, and you'll see that the more good you do to him, the more you'll like him Them that you do good to won't always be thankful, leastways as far as men are concerned There the dumb brutes go a-head of 'em by long chalks Do any living creature but a man a good turn and we'll never forget it That's how I got Nugget, by saving his life Since then he s saved mine and so we are quits on that score, and perhaps some day I may tell you how it happened I christened him Nugget, because of a queer thing that happened four or five days after The river had gone down, and me and Nugget crossed and got into Burrandong I was going to set in to work there, and pitched my tent whilst I went to look for mates to set in with "When I comes back to the tent in the evening, I sees old Nugget though he wasn't called Nugget then-just at the foot of the range, too far away, as I thought , so after him I goes to bring him back, so as he should make another start "When I comes up to him I finds him pawing the ground and sniffing as if he really meant something I lays hold of him but he still kept pawing, and as I looks down what should I see but a glitter that I knew of old he I outs with my knife, and I picks out from the crevices of the slate rock which was stuck upon edge and cropped out everywhere, a nugget of pure gold that weighed ten ounces four penny-) weights Next morning I drops into work on the foot of that ridge, all alone, just cropping up in ; between the slate and before a month was over I'd got close upon wet) ounces And that show I came to call him Nutmeg FETISH PICK.
