? THEATRE ROYAI—On Wednesday evening Balfe's " Rose of Castile" was again performed to a fairly numerous audience, and with, the same success as on the previous evening. The company went through their parts remarkably well, and acquitted themselves of their respective characters to tbe entire satisfaction of the audience. A great feature in the performance is that the members of the company are well up in their parts, and hence the piece passed off without the slightest hitch. To-night the " Rose of Castile" is to be replaced by Flotow's opera " Martha." PROFESSOR PEPPER'S ENTERTAINMENT.—There was another large attendance at Garner's Theatre on Wednesday evening, when Professor Pepper repeated his amusing optical entertainment. The_ entertainment has apparently lost none of its interest for the public, and the illusions were cleverly executed. The representations of ancient and modern statuary, as well as the eccentricities of the "ghosts," met with the same hearty reception. There will be an entire change of programme on Saturday night. ADELAIDE RACING CLUB.—A general meeting of the members of this Club will be held at the Globe Hotel this afternoon. ADELAIDE AMATEUR ROWING CLUB.—A vocal and instrumental concert in aid of the funds of this Rowing Club will be given in the Town Hall this evening. Mr. G. Oughton will act as musical director. ODDFELLOWS' DINNER.—The annual dinner • connection with the Victoria Lodge, I.O.O.F., M.U., will be held at the Oddfellows' Hall this evening.
