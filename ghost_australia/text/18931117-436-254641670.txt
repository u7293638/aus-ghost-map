MRS. PHILLIPS. Mrs. Phillips, the wife of one of Glasson's victims, and who was nearly done to death by the murderer, has (says a Sydney correspon- dent of the Dubbo Dispatch) arrived in Sydney. She hovered for days and weeks between life and death, and at one time it was thought the awful wound she received would prove too much for her. The careful nursing and the attention bestowed on her by her Carcoar friends pulled her through, and now she is able to move about. A friend who has seen her since her arrival in Sydney says she looks very pale—more like a ghost than a human being. Her face is pale and bloodless, and her eyes sunken and lack lustre. It is not to be won- dered at, poor woman. She has had an awful experience, and how she got through it good- ness only knows. It is thought here that the City Bank will give her an annuity. Some say the corporation will not be nice and put her down for £300 per annum. It is to be hoped so, for certainly though poor Phillips was unable to defend himself, he did all he could to prevent the bank being robbed, and he lost his life in the defence of the corpora- tion property.
