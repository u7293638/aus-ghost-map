FOLLOWING THE RISEN CHRIST. Br C. H. SPURGEON. "If ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God 1 Set your affection on IhniRMibove not on things on the earth -Colossians iii 12 Let us consider what it means by our spiritual using with Christ " If ye then be risen with Christ Though the words look like a supposition, they are not meant to be so The apostle casts no doubt and raises no question but merely puts it thus for arguments sake It might just as well be read Sincere nie risen in Christ The 'if is used logically, not theologies 11) , b w ii of argument not by way of doubt All who believe in Gin ist are risen w Ith Christ We were dead in trespasses and sins, but having believed in Christ we have been quickened by the Holy Ghost, and we are dead no longer There we lay in the tomb ready to be come corrupt, j on some of us w ch. cow rupt the main Ks of the w 01 on of -m were upon our character a nil the foul stench of actual sin arose in on us More or less according to the length of time in which we abode in that death and according to the circumstances with which we were surrounded death wrought In us corruption We lay in our death quite unable to raise ourselves therefrom, ours were eyes that could not see, and cars that could not hear , a heart that could not love, in a withered hand that could not be stretched out to give the touch of faith We were even as they that go down into the pit, as those that have been long-dead, only, in this we were in a worse plight than those actually dead, for we were responsible for all our opinions and in abilities which were arguing as if we had power, for the loss of moral powers not the loss of moral responsibility , we were, therefore, in a state of spiritual death of the most fearful kind But the Holy) Spirit visited us and made us alive. We remember the first sensation of life some of us how it seemed to tingle in our soul s veins with pains sharp and bitter, just as drowning persons when life is coming back to them -suffer great pain, so did we Conviction was wrought in us and confession of sin, a dread of judgment to come and sons of presentcondeuinaltou But these were tokens other and that life gruluuU) deepened and opened up until the eve was opened-wo could see Christ the land ceased to be withered and we stretched it out and touched His garments hem the feet began to move in the way of obedience and the he is felt the sweet slow of love within Then the eyes not content with seeing fell to weeping and after wards when the tears were wiped away, the) Mashed and spat 1 led with delight Oh my brethren bclte\crsin Jesus you are not spiritual!) dead any longer, on Christ you have believed and that grand act proves that you are no more dead You tiny e been quickened by and accord into the working of His mighty power which He wrought in Christ when He raised Una from the dead and set Him at His own right hand in the heavens Now beloved you are new creatures, the produce of a second birth begotten again in Jesus Christ unto newness of life Christ is your life such a life us you never knew before worN ould have known apart from Him If ye then be risen with Christ yo w sick in the windows of lit- while the world abideth In death. And now beloved we are at this time wholly raised from the de If in a spiritual sense ' Christ been; raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him and therefore he that hath received Christ's life in him shall never die Hath He not bald He that believeth in Me, though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die Y This life which He hath given us shall be in us a well of water springing up unto ever last English He has Himself said 'I give unto My sheep ctern ii lite and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of his) hand large oil thou deadly love of sin we li IN e done with thee 1 Farewell dead world corrupt world we have done with thee I Christ his given us eternal life We forsake for ever the dreary abodes of death and seek the heavenly) places Our Jesus lives and because He lives we shall live also Werne urged by the apostle to use the life which we have received and so let us exercise the new life in suitable pursuits If ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above Let your actions be agreeable to your new life Let us quit the vault of a mere) outward religion and letusworshipGod spirit and in truth I et us also quit the v vault of ern nal en j o) menus wherein men seek to satisfy themselves with provision for the flesh Let us not lives) the sight of the o>c nor by the hearing of the ear Let us not live for the amassing of wealth or the gaining of fame for these ought to be as dead things to the man who is risen in Christ. And, then, let us hasten to forget every evil even as our Lord hastened to leave the tomb How little a time after all did He sojourn among the dead He must needs lie in the heart of the earth three days but He made them as short as possible so that it Isdittlcult to make out the three days at all They were there for there were fragments ofeachpeiiod but surely never were three days so short Yes Jesus made them to cut them short in right eousness and being loosed from the pains of death He lose early it the very break of day) At the first instant that it was possible for Him to get away from the sepulchre consistently with the Scriptures, He left the napkin and the grave clothes and stood in the garden waiting to salute His disciples So let it be with us there should be no lingering no loitering no hankering after the world no clinging to inanities no unking provision for the flesh Up in the morning early Odewahn are spiritual!) quickened 1 to pin the morning early), from your ease, your camel pleasure, your love of wealth and self, and away out from the dark vault into a congenial sphere ' Seek those things which are above Let our minds ascend to heaven in Christ, even while our bodies are here we are to be drawn up w aid with Christ-attracted to Him so that we can say, " He hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Our text saith, ' seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God what is this but rising to hear cul) pursuits Jesus has gone up, let us go up with Him As to these bodies we cannot as yet ascend, for they are not fit to inherit the kingdom of God , yet let our thoughts and hearts mount up and build a happy test on high Let not a stray thought alone ascend, like one lone bird which sings and mounts to the sk) but let our whole being arise as when birds Uv in a cloud Seek to be preparing for the heaven which Christ is preparing for you "V you are soon to dwell above robe yourselves for the great festival your treasure is above let your hearts be with it All that you are to possess in eternity is above where Christ U use then and enjoy it Let hope anticipate the logs which are reserved and so let us begin our heaven here below If j e then be risen with Christ live according to your risen nature for your life is hid with Christ in God What u an agent to- draw us towards heaven should this fact be-that Christ sitteth at God's right hand ! Where should the wages thoughts be when her husband is away but with the absent and beloved one Í Let Jesus be us a treat to idstone drawing our meditations and affections towards Himself He is sitting, for His work is done as it is written lies man when He had offered one sacrifice for sins for evil sundowner the right hand of God Let us rise and test with Him He is sitting on a throne Observe His males y delight in Hit, power and trust in His dominion He is sitting at the right hand of God in the place of honour an of your this is a proof that we are beloved and fis oured of bed for our Representative has the choicest place at Cod a right hand Let your hearts ascend and enjoy that love and favour with Him Take wing my thoughts and fly away to Jesus My soul has thou not often said Woe is me that Ideal m Meshcch md tabernacle in the tents of Kedar oh that I had wings like a dove that I might flee away and be at rest Now then my soul bete are wings for thee Jesus draws thee up I ward Thou are- a light to be where Jesus is, for their art married to Him there fore let thy thoughts abide with Him rest in Him, delight in Him, rejoice in Hun, and jelagain rejoice The sacred ladder is before us, let us climb it until by faith we sit in the Heaven has with Him inasmuch as we are a sea with Christ, let the new life delight itself in suitable jests This brings in the second verse ' Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth' "Set -v our affection these words do not quite express the meaning although they are as near it as any one clause could well come We might render it thus ' Have a relish for things above, 01, "Study industriously things above, 01, Set your mind on things above not on things on thee Birth That which is proper enough for a dead man is- quite unsuitable for a risen one What are these thine;»nbove which we should set our affections upon ?
