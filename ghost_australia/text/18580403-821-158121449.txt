"BEFGMI TOCB A1MANACS. Ib&cun;^ rather popular some years* ago, a gentleman used to pay this filial tribute to the talent of his departed parent:- I *'0,feyther had a jolly knack j Of cooking up an Almanac." | The tinea occurred to Mr. Punch as he was consulting | a hatch of Almanacs the other day, and he expressed a wish that the accomplished almanac-maker, com memorated in the BOD# were alive and up to work. For everybody makes almanacs now, and, with very few ex ceptions, they arc all stupid affairs. The meteor which appeared to announce the publication of Mr. Poach'* own, and about which so many letters were written by astounded sky-gazers, was a very appropriate tribute to the single work of the kind this can be pronounced per* feet, But though perfection is not to be expected else where than at 85, Fleet-street, why seed a thousand calendar-makers do their work so badly? What is the use of sticking against certain dates, that Home Tooke died-that Barbarossa was bom-that partridge shooting begins-ihat the battle of Ravenna was fought-that pickles were invented-that Cicero was murdered-that Garrick appeared-that the Gracious was crossed-that the Monument was finished -and so forth ? Two-thirds of the dates which are nsually commemorated nobody carcs about, cxcept those who will not be satisfied with such a barren record. Next, the jumble of things makes these memoranda more absurd, for the person who cares about Barbarossa does not care cither for Garrick or pickles, and the Gar rick fancier is not likely to be much interested in the battle of Ravenna. As for the sporting entries, they are simply idiotic. What sportsman needs to be told when he may blaze at grouse, and when at pheasant? And who else wants to know anything about the matter? Instead of a ridiculous mixture of uselcssness and incongruities, why not have class almanacs ? Let every body have his rccord of mattes appertaining to bis own sphere. Don't tell the burglar when Martin Luther was born; don't tell the lawyer about Howard, the philanthropist- and don't remind an honest ir>ftn nnrf woman of the execution of the Mannings. But let us have almanacs prepared in this fashion, and then folks can please themselves. Here are specimen weeks 'he Totnro LADY'S atmatthp. Tu. 14. St. Valentiue. W. 15. Polka invented, Th. 10.

MT FLORA. A FASHIONABLE pa stop AT., Tell me, geutics, have you seen My Flora pass this way ? Thai you may know the miss 1 mean, Her briefly I'll portray. No bonnet on her head, But on her neck &he; wears: An oyster shell 'tis said In size with it compares. Its shape no eye can brook. Its use is doubtful too; It but imparts a barefaced look, Aud bangs much cheek to view,, Her dross may please the swell For its swoln exuberance; She looks a monster belie In such Big Ben expanse. Those air-tubes filled with gas Miirht lift her to the moon; The 6mall boys mark it as they pass. And screech out; 4,Ah bal-loon 1" A parasol she bears j For ornament, not use; For comfort gloves she wears Too tightj and sleeves too loose* Behind her hangs a hood Just level with her chin, An Indian squaw might find it^good To put a baby in. Of her hair she Bhows the roots, Sham flowers the rest concaal; And she's cripplcd by her boots With the military heel: Streets off you hear them stglk Whene'er she ventures out j And she seems to waddle more walk, Her hoops so sway about. Her figure may be good, But that noeye can ttfll; A mere lay-figure would Stiowoff her dress as well. She may have ancles neat, But they're concealed by skirt^ Which chiefly serves to hide her feet, .And ather up the dirt. Then, gentles, have you seen My FJora this way co.ue ? She cannot have unnoticed been, She takes up too much room! THE LAST MOMENTS OF LEADENHALL*STREET. Old Oiiental Man-rve just been looking at the clock of the East Iudia Company.

A patriotic Austrian (a rare species In Austria, where there is 60 very little to be patriotic about) was bragging to the editor of Murray's handbook about his country. It took the lead in civilization-it was the grandest, the purest the freest, the best fathetland. " In tact* Sir," he exclaimed, "I,tell yon that Austria is before all the world." " Yes, much in the same way that Chaos was," was the happy reply. now WIT RUNS IN THE STREETS. Impudent little boy (to a very lat old gentleman, who is trying to get along as fa6t as he can, but with very in different success)-" 1 say, old tellow, you would get on a jolly sight quicker if you would lie down on the pave ment* and let me roll you along." LEVELLING FOB LQTBRS. From Sadies to the station at Kisses is 500 sighs, from Kisses to Pop-the- Question is 1,500 sighs, and from thence to the terminus of Pa'e-Consent u 2,600 siehs, making a grand total of4,600 eixhs To arrrive at Pa's Consent, however, the engine of love has to ascend a steep incline, the gradients of which are enormous-two in three-censing a vast number of eighs to be heavily drawn in reaching it. Some sentimental surveyors have therefore proposed to fecilatate the communication between Pop-the-Question and the terminus of Pa's-Con sent (which may easily be done if they can raise suf ficient capital)^, or failing that, to form a loop'line to Ma's. Being personally interested in the undertaking, we wish it success with all our heart. The estimated saving is not far short of 1,000 sighs. ME, PUNCH'S HTTJIAOTTY. One Hockley Wood, an attorney, seems to have been utterly Qabbergasted at a major or a minor proposition set before him last week by Lord Mayor Carden. Hockley had been acting for some people who were making an unjust charge of felony; and the case having proved rotten, tbe Mayor observed that it was ".mon strous that any solicitors ehoul t undertake each a cue." This speech presented a new idea to Mr. Wood, who in his utter bewilderment remarked that "any solicitor most undertake any case that 18 brongbt to him, so long as he is on tbe rolls." The Mayor begged not only to contradict Wood, bat to add that BO respectable solicitor wonld have undertaken such a case as that. And he discharged the prisoner, the audience " cheering loudly." We think Sir Robert was a little hard on Wood. Per haps it was really tbe first time he had ever heard that any work that is paid for is regarded by society as too dirty for an attorney. His legal education was incom plete. We do not think that ignorance should be treated so harshly. Nov that Mr. Wood has .had a hint, he will apply a new test to cases in which he may be re tained, and " bless the userol light" held to him by the Mayor. We have compassion for everything, even an attorney, and would gladly help Hocklcy Wood out or what a faeetioos archaeologist wonld call Hockley Hole. ADVICE.
