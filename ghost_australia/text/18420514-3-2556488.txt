The Drama, Actors- and Critics. "ALL THE WORLD'S A STASE," No. III. It was our intention when we concluded our last number, to have given further proof of the many noble and intellectual characters which the stage has been the means of bringing into public notice, and who have been more than any other, aspirants for literary fame, the means of advancing the literary (glory of Britain, which can now take the highest stand in the European world. Perhaps our foreign friends may think this a boat but we feel conscious of the fact, and neither care for their sa ' are nor their sneer. In our last we commented upon the great-we may say the tremendous taken', of the sweet Bird of Avon, and the morality which almost in every line of his immortal works appears to come In the opinion, or rather bigotry, of his fanatic opposers. Now we must have a few words to say as to his morality or rather as to the morality of his writings though if we believe his biographers, he stands one of the most moral and unassuming men that has ever existed. We cannot help stating an anecdote of (his illustrious person, which is well authenticated. When Sir Thomas Lucy made a complaint to Queen Elizabeth against Shakes pears, accusing him of stealing his deer, and having written a satirical ballad against him, the virgin Queen made every enquiry on the subject, and being con need as to the falsity of the charge against the young poet, had for some time would not lists n to the repeated importunities of the Knight, until put out of patience by his indefatigable nervousness on the subject. She gave him the following decided and characteristic answer: "Sir Thomas Lucy, my sword could make a thousand Sir Thomas Lucy's-but GOD himself could only make a William Shakspeare I say no more on the subject." This compliment coming from such a person as. Queen Elizabeth, is perhaps the greatest ever bestowed on any of the unfortunate race of poets who, however after ages may applaud them, and boast of them as being the honour of their native land - unless they are more than usually fortunate, generally die in a state of destitution. We cannot avoid giving the following remarks taken from the life of Sbakpseure, annexed to the latest edition of his works : - Some writers have asserted, that Shakspear escaped with impunity shoot his first offence; but that, repeaT u audaciously he was prosECUted by Sir Thomas, whom he wrongly lampuoneil-that to escape a prison he fUd to London where, as might be expected from a man of will and humour in similar circumstance, he threw himself among the Slav ears, and made his fist appearance on the stage in ave!

In the works of TO write that Britain has ever produced (we make no exception whatever) is there so many moral precepts uttered in such sublime, nay gorgeous language, than in those of this immortal man. We remember when a boy, previously to our having been endowed with a large share of that most useful commodity, called common, or rather worldly sense, being surprised at hearing from the mouth of one of our most eminent Scottish divines, iii the pulpit of a Glasgow Kirk, the following words. To quote the words of the first author of any time. " Had I but served my God as I have served my king, he would not now have left me, weary and old with, service, to the rude waves which must for ever crush me, &c.; &c.;" (Vide Shakspeare's Tragedy of Henry the Eighth.) We in the first place thought such, an allusion wonderful, as it proceeded from the pulpit, but on making enquiries on the subject, the hook ("Shakspeare's Works) was put in our hand, and we found them correct. Many times since then, we have thought of, and sneered at the liberality of those who quote the words of an actor, in furtherance of their own tenets, and yet blackguard him for giving vent to those beautiful passages which they thunder from their own pulpits, even in the houses devoted to religions Such conduct is shameful and does more harm to the sacred cause of religion than all the attacks which has assailed it, from the pen of the stiff soil or the defeat. Were plain substantial common sense to rule the minds of men, we would live in a happier world, being" completely purified from that unnatural enjoy dice which attaches itself at the present moment to every rational and reasonable amusement.
