MONKEYS AND LIGHT. It Is a strange fact that In night-time an unknown sound will soaro monkeys almost out of their wits. The creaking of a wheel barrow, a whisper, tho rustling of a window ourtam, is enough to throw them into a fit of horrified screams and contortions; capuchin - monkeys rush wildly through their cage, mac aques try to force . their prison-doors, tho littlo marmosets huddle together liko tho prinoes in the Tower, all about a matter they would disdain to notice in daytimo. The old males of tho anthropoid apes aro about as hard to scaro as any living creature, but after dark tbo veriest trifle will inspire them with an almost supernatural fear ; and it may be a mere fanoy, 'out I -cannot get rid of tho notion that this night-horror of our hirsute relatives must bo tho origin of the Rpcotre- dread of savage nations, and indirectly, per haps, of mcdimval demonism arid modern spiritualism, — ghost-mongcry," as ' tho sceptioal'Gcrmans call it. f Monkeys aro. not very sharp-scented, and havo to rely on their eyes, and in night.tlrao, therefore, aro almost at tho mercy of their enemies, jaguars, pan thers, and leopards, 1 whoso owhoyes enablo .them to hunt by moonlight, and in tho virgin woods of the tropics tho constant dread of mistaking tho approach of a murdorer for tho rustling of tho fitful night-wind would bo enough to make d Berserker nervous.

Thoy can at most give them a direction. - Tho stories of the ChiifnorftB and Gorgons may reproduce themselves in the' brain ; of superstition,) bat they wcro thero before. Thoy nro transcrjpts, types ; tho arohotypes are in us, and eternal. May it not be that thoso archotypes aro ' tho prowling ferae of! tho tropical forests?— Ex> chaJujc, . v.. ' :
