Tried to Steal Dynamite. ' I met a thief one day,' said Andy Rohan at the St. Louis convention of Chiefs of Police, ' whom I had not seen for a long time. I asked him what had become of his partner ? ' Oh, the last I saw of him was an arm,' re- plied the thief. ' What do you mean ?' I asked. ' Well, it was just this way. Three of us went down to a little town in Ohio to work a hardware store. The old man who owned it was the banker for all the people in the vil- lage, and we expected to make a good haul. But, alas, we met with a sad disappointment. We broke into the store and found a ghost all right.' ' A ghost means a safe in thieves' parlance,' explained Rohan. ' We found a ghost,' continued the thief, ' and the boys went to work to blow it open with powder. Luckily for me, I was piping off on the outside while my two pals did the inside work. They lighted the fuse and stepped away about five feet behind a partition. The explosion that occurred blew the whole build- ing down, and all that was ever found of my old pal was an arm." ' What was the trouble ?' ' Well, the old fellow who owned the store was very stingy. He sold dynamite, and in order to escape high insurance rates put it in his safe My poor pal ! It's too bad !'
