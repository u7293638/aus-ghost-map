HAMLET. Last evening Shakespeare's great tragedy, ' Hamlet,' was staged. The hall was well filled, and the audience was a most appreci ative one. Mr. Bentley gave an admirable rendering of the character of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. His acting throughout might be described as faultless, and his genius is moreapparent in this great impersonation than in most of the others lie represents. His best efforts were probably the expressions of awe [ and affection at the appearance of the ghost, and bis recitation of ' To be, or not to be,' and other soliloquies. Mr. Lachlan M'Gowan was well placed as Polonius. Miss Lilia Wilde as Ophelia and Miss Gladvs Leioh ah the Queen of Denmark sustained tbeir parts creditably. Mr. Albert Lucas displayed de cided histrionic ability in his representation of Laertes. Mr.. H. Douglas as Eing Claudius, Mr. E. Cris as Hrratio, Messrs. H. Stoneham flnd Harold Hnzell as Rosencrantz and Guilderstera, Mr. F. Esmelton as The Ghost, and ihe other minor charaoters com- I pleted the caste.
