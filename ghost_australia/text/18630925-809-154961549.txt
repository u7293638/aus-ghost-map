THE MAYOlt'S FANCY DUESS BALL. On Thursday, tho 27th ult., a grand fancy dress ball, given by tho Mayor of this city, took place in tho Exhibition Building. Thero wero about two thousand persons present, including his Excellency Sir Henry Barkly — then Governor of tho colony — and Lady Barkly. Those who had been favored with invitations, testified their appreciation of tho compliment, by tho costly and varied styles in which thoy appeared. Cavaliers of. bygono days were resuscitated, and gallant Leicesters onco moro paid court to Elizabethan damea. There wero merry monarchs enough to havo flirtod with all the girls in Christendom, and sufficient friars to have con fessed and absolved thum afterwards. There were far moro Hamlets than Professor Pepper could possibly havo satisfied with ghosts, and enough Ophelias for them all. Thero wero plenty of brigands to havo infested an Italian monntain, looking dosperato enough to commit any number of murders or abductions, or to rob any quan tity of timid travellers. Enough Swiss pea sants, ono would have thought, to cultivate all tho hills in Switzerland, and shep hordesses to nttond to their (locks ; whilst vivandieres wero so numorous and so pretty that, to have admitted them into her Mujesty's forces, would most seriously have endangered tho discipline. Thoro wore black men and white mon, and moil neither whito nor black, but half and half, tho lino of demarcation being carefully drawn down tho nose. All appeared thoroughly to enjoy themselves, and ovory thing seemed to have boon done to securo tho comfort and happiness of tho guests. The building was most handsomely decoratod with por traits, flags, evergreens, and Chinoso lanterns. A return ball is projected for the 29th instant, and from tho influential position of tho gentlemen who form tho committee, it will, it is expectod, bo omi nently successful.
