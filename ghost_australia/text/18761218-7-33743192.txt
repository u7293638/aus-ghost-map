The Advertiser MONDAY, DECEMBER 18. DR. PATERSON'S report upon the Hospitals for the Insane for the year 1875 has been issued. It is not long, but it is consise and full of valuable information, and is supple- mented bj statistics reUti|]g tit&d; U^H? 9 under his charge, which r range ovar i \ period of Jtw yean. It qpeos-mthaftv t Eomewhftt JiacouTag^—tdOAely, that-tl s number Of pataente Admitted letke Airylan s on Nortfi-ienaiee 4md P&rkend;« 'daring >tie twelve inobtlis under .review shows'? bsq b and unusual increase—from. 351 on fte 3L t December, 18?4, to 401 oa 31st Decenibe > f 1875\. The increaao is pot aoooontoi^ r except on the general pHneiple that, M year 1875 %as onu«ually sfcMy, persons predisposed to brain disease were a#ectod. by itaSufltiences in ai? amnuir^egi«^ or tts Dr. Paterson expresses it, ffrmmfy bai4g a ds^ne «f 4? iwain, its produotioii la liable to be thflatoeed %f the wm&esv;^fl* which determine diseases to ottiac parts if the body." But although the nnmUer if patients h*B mcreasefl in sin naasial 4*^ee,. the ratio of the case^ '($' Improvement i^l cure has not fallen off.. As stateiliii lie tables annexed to ipe jeport, die peroaqte^e by recovery and uvprovqsnent is 1 y ! recovery alone 43-2, whilst Ite .atfox }n I Engls-nd during 1874 was S44L Ib. Pateraon cays that -18 of tte ««Nrdi« chaige^ were only one month under txott ment. There were 27 over one month and under three mosdifi, and tea over three and under six. Of the 72 diacfastrg^a 66 were under traatmeot foe period* from one to bine months, whS^ in the period varied from nine month* to ibxee yeafi. , Theie are no noovenak otsrthreayean. It is also noticeable that (fee recovery isjto is larger in rn^^^^M^ Ami ti^ femalas.^ 3Sips, in 1875 there were and 67 iemates •dmitted--total ISi, and the number of m coveries 39 malM aad 27 fOKudea-Hotal f6. During the same period 6 males had} Un proved and 1 femalo. For tin tea yeirs SO6 patients wore admitted^ and«{ those j 319 males recovered and 18ft females, and { during tie same time 97 paiiaots improved, or 47 males and 50 femaiet. The total of Madnus?k>Da, recoverisa, and Teadaua«loAs n for the ten years was 939. The vscovafei were 671, and the readmissions 138. l?he average of recoveries on admissions was 50 3 per cent^, and of rolapaen or dischargee 2fcl j peroent. The death rate cafcnlated on flic averfge number of patienta resident #a« 8-5 par cent, whilst in Bngispd it was 10-4, and (he rate of mortality is greater amonkst i males than amongst females. The canfeea of deathnqsire no special note. One. comparison which Dr. Pater«oa tnakes is most interesting. Ha says:— Taking 100,000 for the bans of the calcu lation, table 8 shows the ratio of lunatics, idiots, and persons of anaound mind to {he j populaflDn Jon January 1, 1866, to Ist JumaryVlMfc. Sa<Sat« for erery 100,000 | of. the population England has 966 | jnaanapenaos; Sonth Aostmlia, 195. Aj j , regards aocumnUted lunacy, thecompariaoa - is-de^edly kcit?r favor.

If the differefice ,in the death^ate is, considered, it would probably lie found tibat the -?te of accuqiu lation in the two countries is about eqqtt." The cost in Ifrqdanfl—avenge—per patient was 9s. llfd. per week, and in boroagh asylums lls. Bd. In Sooth Anstraliathe actual cost to the State is lls. llfd. Dr. Paterson mahes a strong plea for g&b; beitor made of lodging and treating imbecile-"chadran than the 'means at his comjnand^cnnUiim^ttais l andwe anut say t^t it is at least lamentable Oat some thing fau not been attempted before wr -to ftnptwve'-their -oontittsn. Hie says:— «Hisouido to be ngntjesd that Hum is no nepatatu proviamt for 4he treatment of tins class of patients. Tha imbsdls adolescents in the Aaylnm anunmt to jwjaityjptir^tgtlt would be erroneous to suppose Jhat t&s; r^presento. ihe numben ?«•¥ t^f^timmhm <&«&? -Wj fits of 4 ew&tie-; instHftaJm a*n? deterred from eending their children to the Asylum by the feeling that nothing is possible then in the way of edacatiA*. ¥be«- toaafoaa prefer to keep their afflicted ones at lame jjthwwjh'nftif ; at* ■; the source of infinite trouble and annety to themselves, mi often a pernicious -example to the other; young members of the family. Hie only poamMe way d! <UaJay wish tkjftn fe.*!* , Asylum, is to place them with adults ia the; vMo*s-Wards. The utmost that can be daimed for tiut arrangement it that ifc ensures the physical wants' being attended: to, but it has the obvious dbjeettaft of bringing them into contact wldt'saunds andf scenes from which this young should bo carefully guarded. At the same time* it is difficulty to suggest a remedy; .In the present stage of the cotoay'd growth it Is impoanbb to maintain ■] separate training eataWiAnwut like tfas admirable instatatio?a at Earlswood aad Larbertj aad separate ware's weald entaft] large additional expeaditare wraoat any counterbalancing advantages. Perhaps the «oni4 *c beat met hj *«4«M coofbinins; f(b? th| seppnrt^W a I centrally situated imritntiop, each colony guaranteeing all expenses connected with ! its own contingent of patients.* ; I With this last aaggeation we ccsaot agree. One great reason why parents whs are afflicted with imbecile children senf ' tbem to the Adelaide Hospitals for <he laf sane is that they can always fee readily aeV * cembte; and tbu fact, apart from tfafc character of the Institution and the knowi cake of ita officea, h&a; a *nmg uaftettw" over Aem in inducing them to part wiop thosefor wham they are most anxious, i . central xaafxtsbm) in/asothor eultay wool I possess for them Done of the special adrai - tages which the' Adelaide Asylums offe , whikt it woold increase GA aaiiet' without any e&rrespondiny; sens* «f sea - rity that the chiUren would be w« 1 treated. Then*re other objections whk i we need, not disease here; and without« - tering upon them ire may say that we at ?. no greater, difficnl^ in making a separate, asylum for idk>6c cfa3dT)en- than there has been in moving an orphan school or sv fe^coad /isy\uk for tJfe Inm at Tl*«d^. No doubt there would Wai nrst some in crease 6T expense ; Llwrt in ar humane cause enchaeAis that ought jot to be. a matter of tfaxajDudunt^onsM^eratis&a; We are .happy to find that in our asylsa s the practice of putting patients in tocmik d is rarely resorted to.

Tne usual- dimculues^re found of course in finding patients agitable em ployment ; but hair teadog, ahhoagh |t nay answer in some cases* aeemg. to f? ataxc% to poaaeea, eLemeats of intenk sufficient to engage the fitful .juad \- Bpaemodic interest of a paraoa «f woaotutd mind.
