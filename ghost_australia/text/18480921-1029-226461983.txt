JDortrp â€” wa MY MOTHER'S CRAVE. My mother's grave, my mother's grave ! Oh 1 dreamless is her slumber there, And drowsily the banners wave O'er ber who was so chaste and fair: Yea ! love is dead, and memory faded 1 But when the itew is on the brake, dnd silence sleeps on earth and sea, And mourners weep, and ghosts awake, Oh! then she coraeth back to me, In her cold beauty darkly shaded ! I cannot guess her face and form ; But what to me is form or lace ? I do not ask the weary worm To give me back each buried grace Of glisteniug eyes, or trailing tresses, I only feel that she is here, And that we meet, and that we part, And that I drink within my ear, And that I clasp aromid my heart; Her sweet still voiee,and soft caresses ! Not in the waking thought by day, Not in the sightless dream by night, Do the mild tones and glances play Of her who was my cradle's light ? But in some twilight of calm weather, She glides by fancy dimly wrought A glittering cloud, a darkling beam, With all the quiet of a thought, Aud all the passion ot a dream, Linked in a golden spell together!
