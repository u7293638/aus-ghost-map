INFANT BAPTISM. Infant baptism has fallen into grievous neglect among the ^Presbyterians of the United States. In the whole Presbyterian ') Church the infant baptisms for a year average about three and half infants to each minister. Moreover, as to adult baptisms, the official record is that they total up about half as many as those of infants. Talmage has the largest membership in the denomination, numbering 2471, yet among all this army there were only forty-nine infants baptised in the Tabernacle, To such an extent has the theory of sensible conversion taken possession of the denominations that infant baptism is practically abolished. But the neglect is most note worthy in the Presbyterians, for they nominally adhere to standards which say that by the right use of this ordinance the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in His appointed time ; and, again, that it is a great sin to neglect his ordin ance.â€” Church Bells, 27th May, 1882. ?
