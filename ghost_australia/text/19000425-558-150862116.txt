THE BOER WOMAN. It is natural and proper that a woman should admire and love the country of her adoption (writes Joseph Hatton in an English paper). At the same time that is no reason whj' she should hate another people. I wonder what we have done some time or other to Olive Schreiner ? In the mouth of one of her sweetest, characters she makes Napoleon the First a great hero, chiefly, it would seem, because he was beaten and imprisoned by the English. Whatever we did she would hate us. Though she loves Germany, and typifies all that is lov able in the fatherland in her South African story, she forgets that Ger many had any hand in the overthrow of Napoleon. At least her mouthpiece does. Germany does not; and there are Germans who do not forget how England, with her help, saved Europe. Now, until it was necessary for Great Britain to stand firm against Boer arrogance and tyranny, Olive Schreiner could not have loved, much 1< respected, the Boers among whom she had lived. Here is a picture of the Boer woman who was mistress of the African farm which she has made immortal:â€”"In the farmhouse, on her groat wooden bedstead, Tant Sannie, the Boer woman, rolled heavily in her sleep. She had gone to bed, as she always did, in her clothes, and she dreamed bad dreams. Not of tho ghosts and devils that so haunted her waking thoughts, but only of the sheeps' trotters she had eaten for sup per that night. She dreamed that one stuck in her throat, and she rolled her huge form from side to side, and snorted horribly. . . . Seen by daylight the Boer woman was even less lovely than when, in bed, she rolled and dreamed. She sat on a chair in the great front room; with her feet on a wooden stove, and wiped her flat face with the corner of her apron and drank coffee, and in Cape Dutch swore that the beloved weather was damned."
