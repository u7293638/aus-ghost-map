MR. M'BAIN WANTS QUIET CLERGYMEN. YOUR only plan is buy a spade, And if of ghosts thou'rt not afraid, Go forth and make a midnight raid Upon a parson's grave, M'Bain. The only way thou hast the least Cliauce of a really quiet priest, Parson, or presbyter to feast Thine eyes upon, is dig, M'Bain. Divines, as far as I have read, Long each to punch some other's head ; They're never quiet till they're dead, So go and buy that spade, M'Bain. But tell me, Mac, had'st thou thy way, And parsons would not light, then, pray, How would the daily papers pay? 1 think that (ixes you, M'Bain !
