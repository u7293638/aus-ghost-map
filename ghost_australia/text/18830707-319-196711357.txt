VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF GLUcf BRACELET MEETING. Btowarcls: Messrs. IV. Pearson, D. S. Wal. Iaco, J. L. l'urves, Hurtlo I'ishor and M. 0'Shan:i83y. Handicappor : Mr. E. T. Barnard. Starter : Mr. George Watson. Judgo : Mr. G. Vowlos. Sseretary : Mr. N. It. D. Bond. Tho mooting of tho Victoria Amateur Turf Club on Saturday was ono of tho most onjoyahls ovor celebrated on tho Onulficld hoath, and in ovory vospeet must bo pronounced an unqualified success, tho fivo races on tho programmo boing productivo of interesting contests, in which ua. -usually largo fields took part. In this respect indeed Saturday's meeting is distinguished as hav ing brought together the largest number of horses (in tho race for tho Ladies' Trophy) that bars over started in Australia, no less than 42 facing tho veteran starter, Mr. G. Watson. It is worthy of special remark that this is within thrco of tho largest field oror known in the world, when 45 horses started for the Steward Cup at Goodwood in 1861, For a young club like tho V.A.T.C. to havo achioved such a triumph is proof pf the energetic spirit displayed by tho management, aud Mr. lloud has reason to foci proud indeed of having inaugurated tho Ladies' Raco, which, within tho short spneo of ono year, has produced a field of such phenome nal" dimensions that it will in years to come bo quoted amongst Turf Curiositcs in this and tho old country. Proceedings commenced with tho Selling Raco, for which Halifax was so much fancied that ho started a warm 2 to 1 favorite. An interesting raeo, howovor, resulted in tho victory ot Castaway (who was also in fair domand), with Nymph a good second, and tbo favorite third. . The withdrawal of Brenda and Pride from tho Hurdio Raco left an cxcollcnt field of 10 starters, tho South Australian maroTriplot being most fancied. Mr. J. 0. Inglis, who steered his own horso, Buzza, rodo a capital raco, scoring a popular and roll dosorved victory. The amateur, bowover, mado ono slight mistake, taking tho last turn very wide, of which King, on Triplot, took inBtant advantage, but Buzza, being ad mirably ridden home, sutlnstcd the mare, aud dofeated her by about a length, with Miller third, Tho Victoria Gold Cup was won by Black Jackot, who performed so creditably at Flomington on tho Qucon's Birthday. On this occasion tho sturdy little horse was ilovorly handled by Mr. Godfrey Watson, the youngest of tho eolebrated hunting family, who is u veritable chip of, tho old block, and rode with tho judgment of a veteran. Abdaliah finished socond, under a severe application of steel— which tho poor old follow might havo been spared in tho straight, where his chauco was manifestly hopeless— and Yerlo third. Mr. T. Watson rode Baronot in this race without a saddle, to moct tho weight, butcamcdown at the opposite side of tho course. Tho sight at tho start for tho Ladies' Trophy was one which will long be rcmomborod bythoso wbo witnessed it. Notwithstanding tiio presonco of 42 itorses, Mr. Watson quickly had them going, and although tho start was certainly a straggler, it ia probablo that no advantage would have been gained by delay. Liko a troop of cavalry, the twoscorc and two swopt round tho oastcra turn, and along tho side by tho sod wall it was jmpossiblo to distinguish any but those directly in tho van, until nonring the homo turn, whero Transferred was scon to hold tho load, and tbo Caulfield colt having been well supported by tho public his victory was loudly proclaimed. Tho anticipation was quite justified until, noar the distanco post, where Liddiugton disputed tho lead, but Tho Gbost shot suadonly clear of his field, and Batty riding him home in most deter mined fashion won with heaps in hand by thrco lengths from Liddiugton and Transferred, who woro second and third respectively. Tho time, 1 min. 21 J sec., is remarkably slow, and a score of horses in tho race could, doubtless, under othor circumstances, beat it easily; but it must bo remembered that with 42 horses on a six furlong course witli turns it is a caso of close quarters, and not likely to produco any time-smashing re cord. Another good field contested tho Opon Steeplechase, 13 horses starling, amongst thorn Blackthorn, whoso owner ha»l on the pre vious Wednesday announced in public print that feeling dissatisfied with tho handicap, ho in tended to sell tho horso, and warned tho puhlio that ho would not bo a starter. Vaultor's most dangerous opponents woro considered to bo Black Jacket and Harper-Thompson, aud as Loth woro withdrawn Mr. Bailoy'a big cbostnut was esteemed so nearly a certainly that 6 to 4 :was taken about his chauco. Scobio hung back for tlireo parts of tbo distanco, but a quarter of a milo from borne bad a run at Goncral Jackson, who itad led nearly all tho way, and as Vaultor's white blaze showed clearly in front his backers felt confident — only for a moment, howovor, fortho General, who comes from a stable wboro few mis- takes are mado, rc3pondcdga1Inntly,andM'Gowon, who as a crosscountry ridor has no superior in tho cbiony, had tho favorite beaten at tho distance, and Won by a clear length with a vory palpable "bit in hand." This raco Concluded a most onjoyablo day, and as tho racing (although consisting of fivs cvonts) was all ovor at a quarter past lour, town was reached at an nnustmlly early hour. . Tho railway arrangements were excollont, special trains running to tho courso. from ton minutes to twelve until a quarter . past ono, ampio accommodation hoing providodi but tho racing publio would bo glad to loarn of Botae alteration in tho railway gates of exit, which, as they now exist, aro most abominable affairs, causing a block ovon wbon tho crowd is small. Throughout tho dp.y tho woathor was delightful, and a particularly pleasant fea ture of tho mooting was tho largo numbor of ladteB who graced tho enclosure.
