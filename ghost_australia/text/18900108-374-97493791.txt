Dr. W^ presided at.the function, . and, after the ftj^t-allcmtibn;of Leo XlIL on tbe feiordano Brnno incident had been a-ead by one of the ' clfrgy, his Eminence 1 delivered a short discourse on ■ the ^temporal power of the < Pope. The.; Cardinal fipoke with an Timifitially clear viocej-and was eagerly listened to by the crowded congregation. The first ■ con dition of the temporal po wer ^proceeded thepielate) is ^ v AB80LTTTE INDEPENDENCE FOR THE VICAR OF .' ' ' CHRIST. . That~lie -should >:be-subjected tono power under heaven, save God only; that he should have ^absolute indepen dence ; thut he should never be, as he •has never heen; .^subjected' to any national sovereignty. -He is, and he landt|£ %£tra-nat%nal iM' cadn'o^Hi^' ^ol^^ted to any Erorn i-li(s fourth century-t jto tbe ' ^ejcercised^te - '<in| J*overeignty^that protected and guarded tbe. civilisfed Rbine, when it was forsaken and' abandoned by the visitation -of God. I«i the year 800, and.froro that do<ra to 1800—f^bat is,, one long period of 1,000 years—the vicar of our Lord has exefcis&T; "T '' A^TfiUE^ FBOPER, ANDCOMPLETE SOVE ■ -''*£■ . 'f oyer1 the city'6iE "Rome. At tbe be ginning bfthiscentury, at iJeaistispme thinglike a decade before the century actually opened, began that anti christian revolution which from that hour tojsjjiasrbeeiiBin perpetual obn-' flictl..mtn tbe church, until it crowne3 its sacrilege on September 20, 1870, when, by force and bloodshed, it «rttei^"ahd^U8ii»-ped th6 soverei^tydf] the Vicar of- Christ in the Holy Gity; Secondly, the . temporal powerinvests* theSoIyFather "also with tlivsu pre the' duty of guiding the whole Christian fwofld in tho way1 of God's trrtth arid ' law. From the . reasons which justified thisr declaration ■ his Eminence drew the conclusion that what we call the temporal power "is this: It is the' spiritual power of the Pope in ita ap plieation to material things. It . was tbe merest accident that tbe Providence. of God should have given to the "Vicars of our Lord on earth. A CITT WHEBEIN TO DWELL ASD A TEBBITORY. " V as it came to pass, immediately sur rounding it. "I may sum up the matter in these words: God created the Church and the Church created the Christian world. -The Church' is the creation of divine and supernatural power; the Christian world is the creation of the power of the Church under the guidance of Divine Provi dence. A wise intra had put it thus: •The history of civilization is the his tory of Christianity, and the history of Christianity "is tbe history of the Christian. Church, and the history of Christian Church is the history of the supreme pontiffs, the heads who have ^ruled it andgnided it—the greatest legislators and rulers that the world < has ever seen," Lastly, the .-supreme POWER OF THE PAPACY IS THE KEYSTONE of the arch. What the keystone is to the arch that supreme authority is to the 'Christian world. The Christian world was created by the unity of faifcfc and :the unity of law and unity of authority. And faith and law and unity are embodied in that one person who is the head of all, the source of missionary power, to preach the truth, and Lo expound the law, and to exer cise authority. How, then, are we to estimate the character of that act of September 20, 1870, which was cele brated on September 20 last by rejoic ing -and festival in tbe city of Rome 1 It was a robbery accomplished by ! violence, by arms, and by bloodshed; it was a usurpation, because it deposed as fa,r as man can depose—and man must fail ultimately, and utterly to de pose—the Vicar of our Lord.. In the STEALING OF THE CITY OF BOMB Was committed the tnivst complex and complete and universal sacrilege that the world has ever witnessed. Rome never was tbe capital of Italy. It was never the capital of one nation. It has ever been the capital of Christendom, of the whole universal Church of God." Tbe world "at this moment is,under the dominion of material force. There are from; 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 armed men .gazing in jealousy and fear at eauh/ other's faces. People talk of dis armament. Disarmament is a mere rhetorical .fign re. There was never, from-the begir.ning of the world, such a coljection of' unimaginable powers of mutual destruction. Science has come in to enable rnen to form MODES OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION TTN- 1 _ EQUALLED in their murderous power from the be ginning of tbe world. We must not look for disaroiament. No ; the mines are dug'and tbe trains are laid in the east and west, and in the north and in ti»e sou tli, a pel God alone knows when, i that outburst' of mutual destruction 1 shall take place. Unless it l»e averted | by the : band, of God, no man, no i European concert, no diplomacy. can avert it. " I know, not," concluded his eminent*?, " what icay befall the 'stoDfls and bricks of Rpm«; ; but one thing I'j do know, the Government of Jesus • Glinst shallnot be transferred to any people, for the Holy-Ghost, speaking of His Kingdom, said it shall haveno end !"
