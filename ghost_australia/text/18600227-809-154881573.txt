ORIGINAL POETRY . "TRISTRAN D'ACUNHA.' 'Twas but a rugged wave beat rock, Upheaved from ocean's bed by shock, Of fterce volcanic fire and throe, With cloud-capped peaks of virgin snow. And from its rocky barren hills, Towards ocean flowed a thousand rills, Yet sign of life none could discern By lofty cliff or trickling burn, Save some few restless sea birds, drove By tempest fierce, or power of love. Around each jutting crag to soar, Amid the angry surf's loud roar; With plumage glancing ghastly white In caves as dark as blackened night. Calm was the sea, at rest each gale, And idly flapping hung each sail, As gazing o'er that desolate strand We joyed again to view firm land. Bright shone the sun, and tinged the snow, With evening's rosy maiden glow, While waves in ripplets kissed the beach, And murmured softly o'er each reach. Night fell, in silence like the tomb, And wrapped the scene in mirky gloom, While ghosts of shipwrecked men uprose And plaintive poured forth all their woes. Along that sad and elf-lit shore Dead women lifeless children bore, While fearful beings, not of earth, Their hellish revels held with mirth, And called the winds to test again, The terrors of the raging main. We rocked, we rolled, we swiftly sped From that sad island of the dead. And marked the lightning's lurid glare, The sea-bird dazzle in his lair; While on the shrouds of our stout barque Things shone like meteors in the dark. We hastened on before the gale With creaking masts and straining sail, Till far beyond that hateful shore The winds our ship in pity bore. W. O. H.
