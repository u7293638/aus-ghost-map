THE ORIGIN OF HAMLET. Mr. Arthur Lyttelton, in a paper en tilled 'A Guess at the Origin of Hamlet,' maintains that the play, as it originally OxisteJ, before Shakspearo took it. in hand, was ' Hamlet,' the character of the Prince of Denmark being the' addition which Shakspeare made to the original drama : — ' My theory of the construction of Hamlet is this — Shakspeare, taking up, like any other playwright and manager of the time, a play that had eviduntly strue'e the popular fancy, found it n very barren siory of revenge, with a murder, a ghost, a good deal of bloodshed, and some sirik iug lines and phrases. There was appar ently nothing much to be made out nf this. But the poet's imagination, and his interest in cnaiMcter, seized on the one point in which there lay a possibility. He took the merely external causc3of delay, as the okl piece represented thein, and transformed theni into internal subjecLive motives, arising out of tho nature of the man him- s.'lf.'
