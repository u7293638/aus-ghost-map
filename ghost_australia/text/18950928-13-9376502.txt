SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1803. 'the Dean case is phenomenal in its power of compelling attention there is a great crime, a great mystery, the sombre shadow of a judicial scandal, and lastly a development that of professional disclosures which has no parallel on the records Not even in the novels relating to curio have the public had so many sensations thrown into the one else And this last phase fans controversy into a fierce flame than over 'the lawyers can fairly claim that no other people could have added so materially as they have triumphantly close to the sensational perplexities of the position they have left the familiar devices of the melodrama far behind them They have passed since that ('position which has been argued for centuries, Where does confidence said, and we here do guilty knowledge and conspiracy again 1 And on both occasions the public is eager to take a part in that consideration 1 has the m terest of one of the most successful plays of the day, " The Village Priest," turns upon this point and huge audiences store always enchained by the situation, and the interest of one of the most successful novels of the day, He Dihm of Dum Mmthind, turns on a cognate point it into the position taken by Sir In a VN Salomons an be at tacked, it can also be \ vigorously dull tided It must be supposed, of course, that it belief that home serious itiiiiniiiiiication was made to him is honestly entertained by Sir lui ian Swomons A man who is the strong kudu of a strong bat must be an | bonum able and n t uses of th j man Low will deliberately accuse such a man of family favouring a week! rather its value it, is wholly fine, Mould sent more deputations than one 'the giant plunder may be under a hallucination, for we are all liable to be the victims and tools of our perverted sense % but it will be conceded that he must have the confident belief that he has heard the statement that Dr. an made to his advisor a confession of his guilt Believing that to be the case, was he entitled to keep the knowledge to himself . the class that he was so entitled because the startling tribunal tion came to him professionally, is not even allowed, it is to be noted, in the case of the priesthood 'the most illustrious instance is that of GutNiii and his brother Jesuits who were accused of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, they having, it is said, Received statements in the confessional, and though Home has canonised or is colonising some of these "Jesuit mantis, yet the fact remains that England condemned them It may be shrewdly imagined that no Government and no community would over press a charge of complicity against a priesthood, more particularly as overwhelming evidence can never be obtainable, but of course the solicitor or the citizen occupies much lower ground he, at all events, must conform to the law that there is no sanctuary for curio Ci uno cannot be hidden away in an office 01 many record under the seal of confidence 01 otherwise And so it is in every department of life, great and small rolling" is a question of conscience and of degree Practical men must readily see the force of the dictum of the Duke of Wellington' when, on the occasion of the break up of a Mnustij through the publication of the strict letter of an Irish agitator, he declared. that whether a document is secret or confidential depends not upon the writing of those words in a connor but upon the contents themselves What position would Sir Julian Salomons occupy if, believing honestly that he was told the story of the confession, and also honestly believing in the story itself, he kept the terrible secret in his bosom I He would be a consenting party to the casting of a deplorable stigma upon a woman whom he would regard as innocent He would be a party also to a man whom he would believe to be dangerous and treacherous moving about i03|)ected in society he would be suppressing material evidence in the judicial imbroglio No really honourable man could consent to play such a part once the consequences began to unfold themselves. The question suggests itself, indeed, whether, it be Julian Salomons had preserved silence, his position would not be identical in important particulars with that of Jil Ciivmrs PiuiLiis, the defender of Courthouse i whose name is now passed from generation to generation "damned to everlasting fame " Mr I'niLLiis had within his knowledge the confession of Courvoisier that he murdered his master, Lord William Russell, and yet he was content that the jury should believe that Couivoisint was the victim of " an unjust and depraved con " spiracy the part of policemen ' anxious to divide a large reward "over the coffin of an innocent man " to-day no one defends Ciivkhs Phillips Could anyone have ov cused Sir Julian Salomons if he had stood by and soon, as he believed, the innocent aspersed? the reference of the case to the Chief Justice of New South Wales was an excess of caution to the knowledge of the the 9th the whole truth about the North Shore case comes in any way to any man, that man is bound to disclose it in order that the offenders may be ostracised, and that an odious reproach may be removed from the guiltless Sir June Salomons may be the victim of a hallucination But even if it be others to, \< alleged confession does not necessarily imply the guilt of Dr \n IhosohcitorMi vein R,wlioissitd to have told the story, may have dreamed dreams, even as Sir Juli \n Salomons is accused by his critics of doing The question whether the story of a confession by Dr yn was told to Sir Julian Salomons is one question. The question whether such a confession was actually made by Diva is another 'The situation is strangely complicated But the keen public interest in these extraordinary proceedings will ensure a scotching investigation, and until it is conflicted the man Di was not to be judged Points in Di \n's> favour occur at once 'they must stand over What we have remarked upon is the rule that it is the duty of every citizen who believes he has obtained material evidence of guilt to his close his knowledge for what it is worth Concealment in such cases is conspiracy Whatever impression in the way of sentiment the spirit of their native bush may make on the minds of Australians, as a matter of fact it is not to be denied that public taste runs on the lines laid down by Marcus Clark rather than on those of Hiss Jinnincb OvimiciiAiL In all those of our public gardens in which decoration has been attempted and carried out successfully the original designers have not striven to perpetuate exclusively the cult of the wattle blossom and the eucalyptus they evidently de tor mined that notwithstanding the beauty of both those indigenous plants the pinery Australian sport required for picturesque effect to be much diluted with imported vegetation in the for m of oaks, elms, willows, and the like Lho national taste for "woud " melancholy was allowed to show itself only in the selection of the plaster casts which adorn some of our public resorts At the present moment the annual spring cleaning which these clothes. mo undergoing seems to add to their gloom J each successive coil of while paint destroys the chu m of some concern and causes a Diana great anxiety about his do tolerating figure while Apollo in the Ingstall goldens looks " thunder and the chains of J icbu- as the whitewashed s blush ship s lum uncio moniously over the head of 1 noel soil. his last remaining digest It is perhaps ' a violation of the strictly Australian j spirit to admit these pool, sembly | representatives of a foisted on belief, in shorn of all the glory and fallen upon evil days Ihopri sp by wonder what they are doing hue those for let it ghosts of the Guidon Act dealing still, at the dressing table tennis and within hearing of the shooting suburban, trains Our gardens ii i pretty, but. they are not ihiviiietüiislittillv Australian, tant mine It is not so long since many of them were in the pit | cultivation of dust heap phase The order of evolution of a local pleasure ground is - corporation tip, their waste of mud with dandelions nnel gum saplings, then nursery for aspiring vegetation and youthful humans, then fenced off ground du Nord to some kind of sport, with a wooden pavilion and sixpence to pay at the gate We do not really use our public gardens We walk hastily through them to and from the city, and we occasionally do a little love making, mostly of a superstitious nature, in them, and they are extremely useful after dark as places to be robbed in, but we do not sit in them, Ino in them in fact, as the Continentals live in the "Bois and " Gar dens and "Pianos ns Londoners live in Hyde park and Battersea Park and the score or more of delightful resorts which have come lately taken away from the world's metropolis the reproach of being the less and flowerless All London is out of doors whenever the weather gives it the chance There are tons of thousands of followers in the footsteps of "Worldly Tom and Bob and Billy," and ' On the Sufolmth day they walk (Such is their gay and thoughtless writer) In the parks and tenements, where the. milk from three to six and even Inter London park life in summer is becoming more and more a feature Hyde park, of course, is something exceptional, and stands by itself there is nothing like it in the world the stream of wealth and fashion that pours along King road from Hyde park (Joined, past that deplorable Achilles, every afternoon in the season, is most lively dazzling It is, and has been for decades, the happy hunting ground of the society novelist, the popular essayist, and the fashion reporter And only a few yards from this, the finest show " on earth" as it might truly be called, stump orators are spouting every possible note of angel and revolt against those very people, their near neighbours, sounding every tone in the gamut of sedition from a mild and theoretical albinism to the wigs upon the green of Uimeisul Anarchy And the extraordinary thing is that nobody seems one penny the worse A sauntering "bobby' or two keeps an apparently careless eye on the little crowds Shot Long season culminates on the afternoon air, the policeman passes with a smile, The audience drop off and on to the next man, who is exciting " Ostler " Joe " 01 praying for everyone's salvation in imperfect English Hyde pink is the safety valve Everybody si j s what he pleases, steam is let off, and no harm done.
