QUEENSLAND. (From the * Queensland Tim es/ A CUBIOSITT, Mr Robert Boston, of D ry Creek, has forwarded to the museum in Sydoey the skin of a most curious species of flying squirrel, which a cat had brought to bis house. The animal did not weigh half an ounce when dead and its body was less than the size of an ordinary mouse considerably; but the most extraordinary portion of this species is the tail, which is completely a feather. Mr Easton, who has been for many years accuse tomed to the bush of Australia, and ib a small naturalist in his way, states that it is quite a discovery.—/ Richmond Examiner* (Grafton) Feb. 20. WILD BULLS. In this district there are scattered a large number of these, and it is most dangerous to chase them, though parties occasionally try the sport of destroying them . A short time since a young man narrowly escaped being gored by a wounded animal. The horse he was riding was seriously hurt by the horn entering his flank.—Ibid. CROPS. Tbo late showery weather has tended to the improvement of maize and tooacco. A large quantity of the latter is now being prepared for the markets, and the quality is reported generally as excellent.—Ibid SHIPBUILDING IN BBI8BANB. On Thursday forenoon a fine schooner yacht was launched from the building-yard of Mr E . Monk, at South Briibane,for the Hon G . Harris. Tho vessel in question is an old friend, known as the Ham!et*e Ghost, and she has undergone such a metamorphosis that no one acquainted with her original form would recognise her as the same craft. Her history has’uot been an uneventful one. The original “ Ghost/* as she is familiarly called wrb built on a coral reef off our north«eait coast by the castaw ay crew of a whaling schooner belonging to Sydney, named the Prince of Denmark. The reef bad been occupied by the m aster of this whaler, Captain Sennet, as a depot for stores, Ac., end it was in approaching it that that vessel was wrecked The crew reached the depot In safety by means of the boats s aod to escape from this dreiry and desolate spot, they built a boat of the remains of the schooner and some boa , planks r ____ ________ which Captain r __________________ Bennett had in ______ store, In her Captain B ennett and hie crew, after suffering considerable hardships, succeeded In reaching this port* ftabeeqnentlj she was pedtMwlby bar pnml ewwtoi ttQOk H e laid out a considerable sum upon her to fit her for the lightering trade, and had her altered from a schooner to a ketch. As a lighter she was not a profitable vessel, owing to her small capacity for cargo,and ultimately •hew aalaid up. More recently she was placed in the hands of Mr Monk, to convert her into a pleasure yacht, and the result m ay be aeen in the Bmart little schooner now moored off his yard a t the south aide. Mr Monk has also on hand a resist of a very different class; we allude to the lightship building for the Queensland Government, and intended to be etationed a t Keppel Bay. Within a hundred yards of this vessel Mr W . Pettigrew has the keel of a steam er laid. This vessel will be about thirty tons burthern, with a light draught, and is intended to tow rafts of timber for tho supply of his extensive sawmills.—' Courier.’
