SCIENCE ConiIUSPONDEM 0- THE AUSTRALASIAN 'The Royal Society's conversazione was a marvellous and brilliant success Perhaps the most startling announcement was that the stones of our Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain like the temple of Carnac were really ouentated On June 21 (and summer s day) observations and photographs were to he jointly made at Stonehenge and Carnac in Eg) pt of the shadows cast by the pillars in relation to the lines of the principal axes As the motion of the sun is known it is thought it may be possible to argue backwards from HIL data of the mild summer shadows cast by the stones and pillars of these ancient t( moles to their proper use thus from the sun's motion in the ecliptic we shall probably learn how many thousands of years it is since Stonehenge and Camac were built Professor Crookes has been able to volatilised campanile gold silver and other metals by the electric current this is accomplished without any accumulation of heat and a vapour of gold Vc hcttlcsiisu til in transparent film on glass In turns invited light the fire is best kiddy sa the film grows denser greenish and light yellow then golden when the film is thick enough to prevent light passing through Professor Crookes exhibited this important and in genious discovery at the Royal ton ve> retaining M Callmidreau has brought a new theory of shooting stars before the notice of the Paris Academy of Silences According to Mr Denning s observations the radiant point of the Perseids moves towards the east during the period of notice) a fact indicated In Leverrier as probable in 1871 This is in conformity with the equation of condition, which shows that if the latitude of a radiant point varies slightly the longitude in creases the reign of the Prince of Peace has not yet commenced or else the peace makers are those who make a country desolate, and then call in peace there is a grim truth in the logic that the best way to preserve peace is to be prepared for war Nevertheless it is melancholy to think of the scientific genius which is collected into warlike pursUits and preparations Here for instance, is another new explosive invented It has been termed parasite and its rench et) motor.) signifies its terrible power to efface men and women on the face of the earth Its explosive power is stated to be seven times that of dynamite, and it is serviceable alike for cannon and cartridge It will cause a bomb shell practically to demolish a fine of 500 men It ought therefore, to be very popular in military circles as it would give a chance of promotion The thing: itself is neither rich nor rare Tlicwondorshou thcclevil it got there says the poet alluding to the 11) an amber All potato grow ers are acquainted with the fact that occasionally one of their tubers is found perforated by the creeping under ground stem of some plant In the last number of the Gardeners' Chronicle there is figured in potato perforated thus b) couch grass that is common enough, but not so the true in terpretation, which by the rest of it I suspect to be that of the wise editor Dr Masters -
