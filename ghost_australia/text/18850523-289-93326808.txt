9 rarriL death. Slake me no rows of constancy, dear friend, To love me though I die thy whole Iif e long, And love no other till thy days shall end ; Ifav. it were rash and wrong. If Siou canst love another, be it so ; I would reach out of my quiet grave To bind thy heart if it should wish to go— Love shall not be a slave. Mv placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer fight tiian gilds these earthly morns — Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this life with thorns. Thon wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, If after death my soul should linger here ; Hen's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou weft -waiting all thy life in woe For my poor sake. What love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give * To woman's grace— a tardy recompense ; But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head, To'Sbut away the sunshine and the den* ; Iiet small blooms grow there, and the grasses wave, And raindrops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I ; but, trust me, thou canst never find One who will lore and serve thee, night and day, With a more single mind. Forget me when I die. The violets Above my rest will blossom just as blue, Her miss thv tears. Ev*n Nature's self forgets ; But while I live be true. Aral (Bohemian Club).
