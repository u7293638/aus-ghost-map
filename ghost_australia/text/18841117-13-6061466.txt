ABOVE THE SPEAKER. 15s TIMOTHEUS. Timotheus placed on high." With the Railway Bill disposed of Ministers and members appear to be longing for the end of the session No other big measure is to be introduced Speculation is confined to the question when the thing is to take place Hit little measures that remain could be put through in a fortnight so far as the Lower House is concerned and if the pace could be got out of the Council the prorogation might be the first week in December One of the Signs' merits of this Ministry is that it does not believe in keeping Parliament together an unnecessary day where as the preceding Government used to invite the Legislature to eat and to sit on and to discuss matters with the result that the only thing that Government did was to do for itself. It brought the Houses together when they ought to have been in recess and thus provoked disaster The sheep has been known to show fight If the present Assem lily were to meet after Christmas it is just ashlar as not that it would turn on Ministers whereas prospective early, rising com manda gratitude The Council may not respond to the invitation to sit on Fridays but the effort to induce the senators to meet on that day may induce considerable expedition on the others and may thus secure the desired early in December end Of course much depends upon how the measure of the session is taken by the Council whether the scheme is to be embrace 1 as a magnificent whoV ns i nil thing to be criticised in detail The probabilities seem to be in favour of a solid majority for the proposals And the good spirits of the Assembly may be infectious On Thursday when the early recess idea was first mooted members there were five horses whose heads are turned towards the stable Lv cry bit of business that the Government were prepared to advance a stage was advanced accordingly Vi li it with leaving the chair and taking it again the peal er had a fair amount of go minister c erase and the life of the sergeant at arms was an incessant struggle with the mace as the evidences of going into committee and re constituting the House required that gorgeous but top-heavy symbol to be hidden or produced Mr Kerferd the most industrious of Attorney s Genen] produced bills from his bag as rapidly as the conjuror distributes articles from his magic portfolio and with a like air of pride V at one may shrewdly suspect that even his store came to an end at last and that one reason why the generously gave up to a private member was a list of matter There are the nights and the weeks that give a season a leeor 1 to look back upon the Assembly lingered lovingly on the measure of the session so as to give it the last touch required to complete its symmetry The Swan-hill line was put in, as was expected at the last moment-the died ney interest (represented by Mr Gillies) notwithstanding If the Government had been hearty in their opposition the railway could have been kept out but Ministers gave their railway colleague their votes rather than their influence Melbourne men and there are many Melbourne Ministers favour till new border lines and it was not easy for the Government to be pronounced when the cause was taken up by the general favourite Mr Thompson Moore Previous defeats have been sustained by the defection of Ballarat at the critical moment when it was ascertained that Swan Hill would be connected with the Sandhurst and not the northwestern by steam but this time Colonel Smith and his colleagues stuck firmly to their bargain that if the one town could not get the line the other should and hence the % factory At one time such a union would not have been dreamed of but to day no coalitions are and possible That major who was telegraphing all about the country to Ballarat men to remember Ballarat interests and to keep Sand burst out at any rate is a fossil There was no need to bother about his alleGed in limitation Everybody treated with contempt an individual so far behind the age as not to know that altruism is the order of the day now much the House has improved in manners is shown by the circumstance that its very big really a Bill w is passed almost with out a personal unpleasantness, there would have been not a solitary charge of individual interest in particular lines but for Mr Mason His statement that the Cranbourne line goes through property owned by Mr Gibb pro voked not Mr Gibb but the indignant Mr Ives, to reply that there only two pro per ties for the opposition Pal enham line to touch and that the one belongs to the member of the Council and the other to the member of the Assembly who are moving, in the matter If party spent had been about there would have been an uproar and a war dance 1 we sessions back and a statement that the assent of the relative of a Minister had sold a hundred loads of gravel to a stranger who had used the same on a Government contract led to a sensation and a select committee to day members would rather swallow a camel than strain at a great The House, as Mr Bent has it rose to the occasion Isotn member but frowned upon Mr Mason and those who spoke lectured him severely As for Mr Gibb he was simply grand When not quickly as if anxious for a prompt retort but after a decent interval he slowly reared his colossal but peaceful form on high everyone felt that he could crush his opponent in a twinkling. But power not put forth held in reserve obtains the most respect and when she roemberforMormngton intimated that he was not going to reply to the personality, but to address himself to the merits of the case the applause was all round the House voted with Mr Gibb nearly in a body, and thus Mr Mason, first ignored and then ignobly discomforted received a double crushes the comic artist seeking to pourtray the scene would be irresistably tempted to work on the lines of Landseer s Dignity and Impudence What a history the Mining on Private Property Bill has, commencing from before the auspicious hour when the junior member of the House was ushered into a world which has cruelly made him a politician This time the House-or rather one group of members did not rise to the occasion. A little nobility of sentiment would have come in well But instead of expressing gratitude that at last terms had been arranged, a number of representatives voted for the bill be cause they would not trust the Upper House with it the measure would not be safe in the hands of the landowners And the bill itself had been sent down -and not for the first time either-from the Council to the Assembly The allusion to landowners might also have been spared inasmuch as the Council represents ratepayers and the fact is that the election of Mr Cuthbert by the rate payers of a mining district did at the last just settle this particular question The Assembly very well know that the group of growers had met the gentleman in question on this very issue, and had been severely defeated. Something must be allowed however for the feelings of the men who for years when they could not otherwise raise a cheer have said some Ann,, with success about mining on private property A good thing in every respect is it that the quarrel is put out of the was, for if the new generation is entitled to anything it is to puzzles of its own A hat of those who commenced the fray and who had a real grievance inasmuch as the individual miner of those days could not make arrangements which a company. can easily carry through' The most of them Their six words are rust their bones are dust Their souls are with the saints we trust. And Una no matter what side they fought upon But if as Milton has it some of the disembodied spirits spend their time on a hillside arguing matters which even they don't understand, it is tolerably safe to assume that certain of our old friends are in that crowd there or thereabouts The number of possible leaders in the House is a very tunal I one. Conspicuous amongst the few is the second member for Castlemaine The demonstrations made on his return prove so much w Inch side the traveller will co-operate with nobody knows and perhaps no one less than Mr. Patterson himself. He may occupy a prominent place in the present Gov- eminent he may head the final movement against it All this is in the future but political change may be in the near and not the distant future It may be much nearer than most people suppose.
