Union 'Co.'s Liners— Fast Passage of the Marahoa. — The Union Co.'s steamship Mararoa, on her passago from Sydney to Wollington, has shown that there are few vessels of hor size nfloat to approach her in tho matter of Hpced. Her run across from Wel lington on October 4, when sho initiated tho company's express servico between Lyttelton, Wellington and Sydnoy, was porfornicd in 3 days 18 hours, a speed of between 14# and ID knots being attained. The fine steamship sailed from the Margaret- street pier at 6 p.m. on Wednesday last, and on Snuday afternoon Isho was fnst at tho Wellington wharf, tho run of 1210 nautical milos having been accomplished in three days and 20 hours, and'judging from the experience on tho Australian coast for tho past few days, she is almost cortain to havo experienced somo dirty woathor. The Mararoa is to leave Wellington again on Friday next for Sydnoy, and is duo hero on Tuesday afternoon. Re garding the movements of other boats of tlio fleet engaged in tho Sydney-Now ' Zealand trado, tho Ardlo arrived at Wollington from Nowcastlo on Monday morning ; tho Pultaki is to leave New Zonlnnd for Sydney on Saturday next ; tho 'l'aiori is to i leave Sydney for Wellington and southern New Zealand ports on Monday. New Steak Service to Cai>e Hawke. — " Communication to Capo Hawke, 198 miles north of Sydney, is by steamer from Sydnoy or Nowcastlo occasionally," is how tho guido boolcs explain the means of reaching this inte resting and valuable portion of tho coast lino of Now South WnleB from tho metropolis. This, howovor, is a matter that will spoedily bo remedied by Messrs. Glicst and Jowott, of Loftus-street, who have purchased the steamer Byron, a light draught vessel of 200 tons, which was specially built about 12 months ago for the coastal trade. The steamer will, ns a rule, leave Sydney each Monday, dischargo and ship freight at Capo Hawke, and after a visit to the Manning will call at Capo Hawko on hor way back to Port Jack son. As the district of Cape Hawko is noted for its agrioultural nnd timber resources in the ordinary trado, and its fishing and shooting round Lalco Wnllis for excursion purposes, tho venture of Messrs. Ghest and Jowett should prove highly successful. The run from Sydney to Capo Hawko is only about 18 to 20 hours, nnd this, when compared with tho alternative of proceeding from Sydnoy to Newcastle, Newcastle to Hexham by Rtcamer and train, and from Hexham to Bulahdolan by coaoh, must make the trip of the Byron appear a per fect haven of rOBt. Tho Byron will bo under tho command of Captain Joseph Cnrrio. The Romanoff, from New York.— The ship Romanoff arrived in harbor at 6.30 this morning from New York after a lengthy passago of 115 days.

Hor place was immediately taken by tho four-masted barque General Gordon on the berth for tho January sales, under the lauspices of Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Co. Sho was launched this morning, and tho cargo steam tramp for Strathesk was floated in for cleaning and painting preparatory to an attempt to scoop in several thousand bales of wool from the regular traders. The Pout Albert in Horson's Bay. — The Anglo- Australasian Co.'s now steamship Port Albert, n fast and useful 4000-ton liner, of which Messrs.

Fu.nk-ing the Yellow Flag.— When the North German Lloyd steamship Lubeck arrived at the Samoan capital the local health officer proceeded to board hor, but Captain Alentz, evidently thinking from tho sight of the yellow flag flying from the stern of Dr. Funk's "State barge" that the cholera had reached Samoa, or else that there was somo contagious complaint on Bhore, kept the steamer away, and to tho dismay of the Apianites seemed as if she intondod to steam back to Sydney without holdingany communi cation with Apia. Through the desperate efforts, however, of his boat's crow, tlio doctor was able to get alongside and explain matters, and was soon enabled to grant pratiquo to the North German Lloyd liner.
