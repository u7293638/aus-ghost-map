It would be an undoubted misfortune, however, to stop, suddenly, the esist iug- street traiSa afpaGgemsnte, monstcoaa and stupid though' thoj are.

The other way ont of the diffioolty wsoid be to adopt the only system of tramway* thai baa prayed suitable and profitable, and, as -juickly a» the ch&nse; ooold be made, swbatitnte lig-ht, elegant oara, drawn by hoceoe, for tiw ooatly, fearful, and iiwopftbie oas-arane which maka the tramways of Sydtwy a gofitoe at amazement t^ ail -who have aeen bnaUieaa of the kind in the great oMee ef Borope and Amerioa.
