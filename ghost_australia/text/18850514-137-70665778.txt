Sn,--Your township is going ahead; the signs of progress on all sides are numerous enough to satisfy any ordinary mortal who may want to pitch his tent in and rise with, a rising place. But there is one science, which in more civilised lands holds first place, that hero seems to be ignored; I refer to Hygiene. In this respect one has to go back, not hundaeds, bat thousands of years, to the heathen hasilets of India, or the very backest slums of London's East End, to find a parallel to your Victoria Street, down the side drains of which flow streams of bacteria-producing liquid, the scourings of pots and pans, washtubs and the rest. It was Ruskin, I think, who was pleased to remark that in his opinion a good sower was avery beauti ful thing ! Sir, can you not manage to Eiuskiniso the sanitary guardians of our township P To aid you sn this beneficent end, 1 have only to ask that I be per mitted to pose before the hearts and pockets of the placo'as the ghost of DIPIITPIERIA.
