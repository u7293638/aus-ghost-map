WOLLOMBI. The Rev. Mr Nowland, of Newcastle, delivered a lecture here on last Monday evening, in the Wesleyan Chapel. Mr. Brooks, P. M. acted as chairman, and in troduced the lecturer to the meeting. The subject was concerning ghosts. The lecturer strongly condemned the wicked practice of getting up such stories, some for their object of perhaps committing theft, others with a view of frightening young people which he condemned in the strongest terms, as being likely to injure, if not entirely ruin, the health of some people, he alluded particularly to those of nervous and delicate constitutions. While on the other hand the rev lecturer said be himself believed in some instances such things as ghosts might appear, and cited the circumstance of a Mr. Fisher, who was murdered about thirty five or forty years ago in this colony, near Penrith (that affair is donbtless within the recollection of most of the old colonists) besides quoting many passages of Scripture in support of his opinion The rev. lecturer spoke for about two hours whereupon taking his seat, the Rev. Mr. Lane, of Singleton, ad dressed the meeting telling them that he had a short lecture to deliver in the way of money matters for the purpose of paying off the debt incurred in the erection of the chapel. At this stage of the proceedings there were a few got rather fidgetty and went out - perhaps they fancied they had seen a ghost. However, the rev. gen tleman succeeded in obtaining as much money as paid off the debt, namely about Â£14. There were no ghosts about that part of it. The meeting broke up at about ten o clock, after returning a vote of thanks to the lec- turer, Mr Lane, and the chairman. October 27th, 1860
