Wt finv By Jack Trueman. . I ran away to sea when I was four teen years old, and I've been a sailor ever since, and shall be until I die. I love the sea, and I hope they'll set me 5 afloat on it at last, instead of piling sods over inc. ashore; but none the less I did a wicked, lubberly trick when I ran away from home. My mother was a widow. She lived in a little house, built where you could hear the sea sobbing at night, as if it was trying to tell her what had become of my father, who went out in his ship when I was a baby, and nothing was ever heard of either again. Only if the Polly Trueman had been above water, she'd have come to port,'and nothing could have kept her from it. "Well, I always hankered after the sea/' bit mother always said, "No. I've lost enough by the cruel water," said she. " My Eben is gone, and I can't give up my boy Ben." ' That was when old Captain Stokes offered me a birth, and I begged to take it.' But yon see, she held out, and sent me to a lawyer's office instead arid there'I drudged, sick and tired of it all, and spending all my leisure time on the wharf, looking at the ships; And I got to know some sailors,*and . told them how I wanted to'go,'but mother wouldn't let me; and at! long and at last one of'em says : ? ' " Ben Trueman, women 'are^always .set iigin the sea. Run away: . She'll forgive you when you take her home your first wages." . ' . -;m So, one day, what did I do but. ship "with' a captain that wanted men'and boys. I left my old straw'hat by the -water-side, and some other 'of my ; clothes too ; and before I started; I;told 'mother I was going aswimmiiig. -Well; . God forgive a boy ; he's no more heayt .than a bear. .' v. : Still, when I turned into my ham mock I used to think of mother,! I'd ^ii}; . her-as I left her, in lier ;black 1 dress; with the little pin made out'of*1'silver ; for all the world like the image'1 of : a schooner, rigging and allj-i' ie'"col "lar, sitting mending a shirt bf mnc ml singing softly to herself>: h^v;; a».. black as jet, her chceks as>rc I th sunny side of'a'-pear, ari'dHhe ou.nL&h.; . catching her as she rocked backward and forward. I^prayed the; prayer she taught, me and I-kepi-out of-mischief for her sake.'; i - The voyage over, I' jumped-upon 'shore,. crazy to see-her, .! ready , to cry with joy at the hope 'of-iti; !A11 my wages were in my pocket-a.year s . wages-and I'd picked up a green parrot anda'lot of shells for her. I ran up? the street swinging the cage, with the shells under my arm in a bag, and I burst into our house yelling, like a pilot in a fog ; " Mother, mother, I'm home again !" And a strange woman turned about, on the hearth, where she stood cooking .something, and savs she: ." Have you gone crazy, young l!man?" ' " T " I'm : Ben Trueman, says . i. " Where's mother V ? i " You an't Widdy Trueman s son i says she.: . "? Yes, vesj" says I. '?i , -?'" Lord forgive you then !" says the -. women. I suppose you ran away to sea. She thought you was drowned. yl saw her when I bought this house, :"a; brokein-hearted critter. Says _ she, ' I've got to go, or die. The sea is_too close here-1 hear it all night. I ve ?got^Eben, and I've got Bon ; I ve got "Eben, and I've got Ben, over and over \- again.' She went away a year ago "'If she's dead or crazy, you've killed '. her. What do folks care for their boys for ? they never get no thanks. -<c Where is she V' I asks. i: -Says she, " I don't, know. Dead I '? reckon. She' looked like a decline. ?' 'And nobody could tell . me where to find her. ?.'And.1I> advertised, and I travelled, and'I asked everyone 1 met if they -knew^AVido.w^Tmeman-;-.. but she seemed- to go,' out of, the world.. . I began to think she was dead. , When I-sailed to.sea i againy it>was like ?a1',murdcrei,,.» " I had no.'rest Jnori peace. Justjas'they'sayithe pictured the dead; man: comes/before i their eyes, my mother came before-mine; rocking in and out.of the sunlight in her. sewing chair, with her black hair shining, and the little silver scheoner shining- white against her dark dress. ? It seems- as.-if I should never have any. peace, After; every ; voyage 1 'went 'ashore ???: and searched, but never found her. I would have drowned myself, only . that I had noproof she was dead; and I felt I must search on until I knew. Lsavedall my, money for her, if ever I found, her ; but I did'nt hope to do that, 'somehow,! But I did my duty; At lasfc^-ffromj second mate and first mate ? I got^ be captain. No one in the world cared1 about me. I loved women, but I never, courted one, for fear it should keep me from searching - from. mother. And I was twenty-eight years old, and felt a1 great deal older, wlien, coining to port one dayj I-went ashore/-as. !?a1>>aailor is always glad to ao, and- walking-up one of the.main streets I,saw> down one of the bye-streets, a. sign hanging .out,< with" Fair" on it-fair for the aid of, the Sailors' Home.'or something of that sort. > And seeing it"wns ? .ior'sailors; it seemed my duty to lend a hand; so £ set sail towards it, and there was a picture-.] ast the prettiest, craft you ever saw, all full-rigged, with more hair than I ever saw grow.on women's heads -afore;" behind - the ?' tables:".-::] -)olls::'and china, and cakes and creanv,and flowers .and ? kick-shaws. n And.i onersmiles-at me; aiul anothei^offers-me<tlnslor my, lady, and ,t.hat. for, my.,lady ; and one says,n " Buy, .aipresent.s fori your., little girl,isir;"is And11I-'<.makcs:a« bow, and §ays I "-I 'haven't' any, miss,' all the the. same, thank?,you.^-If-iyou'll' tell .me where the.i captain-s 'joffice .is, >ifll settle up ; and I'll treat' all iiands-to sweets, if they. ll acccptait." j: . ,'Twasn't ::the>.way,to;do,f. 1 suppose,' ;for they ^only- laughed..- .:I)ut pretty 'soon a cler'gyman took.me in tow; and showed 'me how .to.steer; . and finally, nve-'dropped.'anchor at.what they/called 'a " grab bag;'!
