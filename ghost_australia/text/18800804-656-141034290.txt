tWtti. BETWEEN JOT. AND SORROW. ? ?? Between joy and sorrow, As 'twixb day and morrow, I lay for a space ; And I heard, bo lying, My old Grief sigbing, From her far-off place. I said, ' Thou art over; And whero dreams hover Tliou hovereat now ; In the land of thy dwelling What waters are welling, And blossoms what hough ? Old tears are its rivers. The 'wind that there quivers Is breath of old sighs ; Wrock-Btrewn aro the shares there, AndjBunset endures there Through infinite skies. Bat all thero is quiet ; There no wave makes riot On the waif-cumbered coasts, Whero thou movest banished, But not quite vanished— A ghost among ghosts.' — Philip Bourke Marston in the Atheiweuni.' ?
