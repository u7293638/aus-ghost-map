[?] ' Ghosts are common here,' writes an Isle of Man correspondent, ' but perhaps the most persistent, till now, has been that ofv.Malew Parish Church. The ghost itself was, needless to say, never seeo, but people passing at night along the main road were frequently startled by seeing a light move along inside the church from the door to the chancel. It was popularly supposed that this v?aa a light carried by a spectre, for it was known that no living per son was in the building. The mystery has at last besn solved by the Vicar. He carefully watched the light, and found out that it emanated from a distant lighthouse fitted with a revolving light. Its raya touched tbe church windows one by one as the light revolved, producing a very realistic im pression of a person walking up the aisle inside carrying a light.
