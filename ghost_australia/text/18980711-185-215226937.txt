DESECRATION AT THE NEW CEME TERY. TO THE EDITOR. Yours &c.; The Ghost of KING BILLY. SIR, —An act apparently of vandalism has been perpetraled at the grave of the last of the aborigines, over which a substantial monu ment in granite has been recently erected by public subscription coating £2O. The sur rounding of the enclosure is formed of a few typical native spears. Thesa have been ruthlessly bent with a heavy hammer thereby destroying the whole appearanoe of the monu ment. I trust the perpetrators of this outrage will be discovered and made anoxamole of.
