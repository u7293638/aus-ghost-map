EVENING SERVICE. At the evening service the sermon was preached by the Rev Archdeacon Al'Citl- lagli, who took for his text Aets 11-24: "For he was a good man, full of the Holy Ghost and of faith, and much people was added . unto the Lord." 'These words, spoken of St. Barnabas, described the character and work of the first Bishop of Melbourne. In no department of labor did success depend upon character as in the ministry. If a man wanted to employ a lawyer the last thing to happen would be to ask what was the lawyer s character, and it was the same more or loss in respect to other of the seeu- 'lar professions. But in a clergyman, charac ter was essential to success. The late Bishop Perry was not wanting in this re spect, as the success of his work proved. There were those who thought that Dr. Perry was narrow in his views. But this the preacher ascribed to such differences of opinion as always did,' and always would, exist, even amongst men professing the same general belief. Epis copacy was like a limited monarchy: Within certain limits it allowed a large amount of individual freedom, anil the Church of Eng land, while priding itself upon its organi sation, also prided itself upon the enliglit- . ened liberalism vouchsafed to its devotees. During the past 00 years the church in this colony had made great strides, the two dioeescs now including 180 clergvmen, 50 paid and about 300 honorary renders. On the day that the late Dr. Perry was buried in Essex, England, lie (Archdeacon M'Cul- lagii) was present, he being the only re presentative of Australia there, with the ex ception of the deceased prelate's widow. The ceremony recalled to his mind all the good work done by him in Victoria, work worthy of a great man, and forming the base of all the good results that had followed, and the splendid efforts of successors. A tea and public meeting, presided over by the Governor, takes place in the Town Hall this afternoon and evening.
