The League clubs commenced their third round last Saturday, and by being able to meet at Williamstowu. fhe above teams had much tbe best of the deal, for the ground'is de- lightfully .situated within a stone's throw of the shore of the bay, so that any breeze that might have been knocking about the players got the benefit of. The hnmo ton 111 troro fnrtnnnln tn win the toss, for tbe wicket was in ai condition, and the turf generally fast. Their compilation of 203 for the loss of eight wickets was then a perform ance that might have been expected, though every credit must be awarded them for their display of baiting. Houston keeps up his form splen didly. his contribution so far being 5S not out. He hit a 0— alt run out— aud never gave a ghost of a chance. Watson's 31 wore well pur together, although bis opponents were good enough to let him off a couple of times. He came to grief by being run out when attempting a second run. J. Put- erson throwing the wiek<t down. Sutcliffe and Henderson, with 25 each, gave sterling exhibitions. They opened the innings, and 40 was on the board before a separation was effected. Sutcliffe was very Mcverly caught by M'Dermott. Henderson was 90 minutes making his runs. It was a patient but useful innings. C. Grubb's 37 include a grand sixer off Pntersou— his second run-getting stroke. The leather soared high over the boundary into Morris-street— a lovely hit.
