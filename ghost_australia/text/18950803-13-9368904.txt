THE PASSING SHOW. The interesting question of whether it is lawful to shoot a suspected burglar at night has once more been raised by a recent case. He have already had one ruling on the point by no less an authority than Dr Youl, who has probably " sandwiched' more bodies burglars included, than any man in years, and who directed a jury to find a householder guilty of murder because he in continently ' pulled a gun on ft in bright intended For ii coroner to thus deprive himself of an interesting corpse argues a line self-denial but then Dr Youl probably noticed that he could full back upon the corpse of the householder, which would be cleaner and generally much more convenient, while when the burglar was caught there would be a safe "bringing in addition The leg of rule seems to be first find out whether the burglar intends to assault you then threaten him with legal proceeding but in any case allow him to get in the first smack In this weeks see the householder didn t shoot, which was a pity, because as the stranger was a divorce directs it would have been interesting to en whether the man with the revolt would have been incontinently hanged, or whether he would have received a congratulatory letter from the Acting Governor young persons in the suburbs who are sent out till late hours to post letters or fetch in the Sunday beer have been wrought up into a state of unhealthy excitement lately by the ghost, and although many attempts have been made to capture this very interesting specimen, it invariably emits a hollow groan as soon as the police arrive upon the scene, and immediately disappears In spite of the Banking' and accurate descriptions which have been furnished, the detectives have up till now failed to make any arrest, though for an officer of the skill and experience of a 1 Mannum) or a Ward it might seem a simple task to identity an individual with phosphorescent eyeballs and mottoes written in lue all over his stomach the police, however, have been specially instructed to use every effort to effect a capture, and personal feeling is likely to be an even stronger incentive than a mere official memo It is upon that large and growing class of young, persons who enjoy the mysterious figure known as an "evening on that the incubus of a ghost naturally presses most keenly) allere an evening out' is or ninan!) spent it would be hazardous to conjecture the one place where it is never spent is at home, and yet this is precisely the tinted spot where the fear of the spectral visitant has impelled the young person to remain Some people are inclined to con stir the ghost is a mere trick of the imagination Others prefer to call it a figure of speech, and they point significantly) to the fact that his appearance is contemporary with the announcement at last by the treasurer of a satisfactory Budget 0 j s) chical researchers, lend your ears a moment pra) And attend MacAlpine heavy, to my artless little if are At out a result c bogey that has lately come to stay, (or it beats Professors Laurie and it puzzles Dr S} me VCs it sends your teeth a snake, And it sets your knees a wobbler', or it but a mere fake But a bona-fide Goblin we speak of it with bated breath, I e gaze with further of For bear the spectre laid for years may vanish all too Talon, has long indeed since last the mystic form Beiisun with cheers stride, the glimpses of the Its here it's here at last It i needs no further nothing , but take care to hold it fast, It's a most elusive goblin Mr mee cases It!

In South Australia the broad minded patriot- atei'iilsqpliiisy-indignant that Asiatics should be allowed, to paddle for pearlshell in the pellucid waters of Port Darwin. " Don't grant them pearlshelling licenses," demanded Mr. Griffiths the other day, but to this the labour members de- murred, not because it would injure the blacks, but because it would benefit the white employers. Much us the Adelaide labour member dislikes the black employs, he detests the white employer far worse. A happy solu- tion seems to have been finally hit upon by suggesting that only the holders of electors' rights shall in future be allowed to act as divers. The unhappy Asiatic will be required to procure the valuable document and secrete it in his loin-cloth, familiarise himself with the mysteries of the ballot, and possibly provide himself with a ready-made set of opinions upon the education question and female franchise. Then only will he be permitted to make his descent into the vasty deep, as satisfactorily civilised as the respectable ladies and gentlemen who daily go down in the diving-bell at the Polytechnic at 15. per head, accompanied by a brass buttoned page to play propriety and hav e them from getting their feet wet. Undoubtedly., the intelligent islander from Funafuti or Tatakoto or the Kingsmill's who chanced to visit just now . this people, celebrated for their chivalrous respect for women, would conclude that the Box must for some unexplained reason be under a temporary cloud, he would dip into our fiction, and murmur a guttural equivalent for the word Shocking He would drop in at our theatres, and emerge with a deep indigo blush upon his Swarthy features. Take for an example the maltreatment lately accorded to the sex at our leading playhouse alone. We have had within a few weeks : A rebellious heroine who goes to Cairo, soils her plumage badly, and comes back to tuck herself under the equally besmirched wing of her husband. A heroine who submits herself and child to be out for at cards-ace low and no joker in the pack. ' Various heroines who desire to "redress the burden of maternity," and assert' the right of woman to " reek with infamy " if she chooses. A heroine who decides to cut the bonds of her past iniquities with the bare bodkin of the suicide. A heroine who is so-so herself, but whose mother was a shade " off." A heroine who has herself been no better than she should be, but whose mother was a great deal worse. The magnanimity of the gentle sex was surely never better demonstrated than by the patience with which she endured this systematic vilification. She does not rugs and tear up the dress-circle cushions in protest ; the only missiles she hurls upon the stage are bouquets of approbation. And as her male escort, assisting with her cloak, murmurs confusedly :-" Yes a very fine indeed j but don't you think she was just a little eh ?" the lady critic answer boldly, "Not at all. It served him very well right at any rate." f_ >
