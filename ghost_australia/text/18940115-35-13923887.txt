The weather indications on Saturday were not very encouraging to the Canterbury Park when a go meat with regard to the success of the January to union. for the forenoon was oppressively sultry, but about 4 p m a heavy shower set in last ng fully an hour The downpour had the effect of clearing the atmosphere and with the exception of another slight shower, the afternoon was fine the attendance was up to the average the means of conveyance by rail and road being well patronised and the customary reckless style of driving between Ashfield and the trysting-place was repressed by the Transit officers, who were stationed at intervals along the road Though sound, the track was H. trifle heavy owing to the rainfall but the only mishap occurred in the Hurdle Race First Lord coming down over the obstacle in front of the stand but though Mr laughlin got knocked about by coming in contact with one of the horses he was not seriously injured The starting apparatus was brought into operation for the first time with horses but the results were not altogether satisfactory The apparatus was filed at the six furlongs post where the starts for the Flying Handicap, Park Stakes and Selling Race SA were effected For the firstnamed event the horses went away in a line and the despatch for the Selling event was equally good but in the Park Stakes a couple of horses remained at the post and the others departed in a string, consequently opinions differed considerably as to the utility of the barrier system The starts for the Hurdle Race Canterbury Handicap and Welter Handicap were effected by Mr J Hegerty who sent off the horses on good terms The general arrangements were conducted successfully under the supervision of Mr M L DIMS The Hurdle Race with which proceedings commenced brought out a field of eight and Marque was most in demand while First Lord was next fancied First Lord fell over the hurdle opposite the stand when half the journey had been negotiated and Zingara who occupied a prominent position throughout, scored an easy victory The starting apparatus was brought into operation for the first time in connection with the Flying Handicap, and at the request of several owners a couple of teal despatches were given before the horses were sent on their mission On the second trial Dutch Hoe broke away, and galloped once round before he was pulled up The start was a good one and the favourite, who was the first to break the line, won from end to end, while Nina who was also well supported made a bold bid for the prize at the finish The Park Stakes brought out a baker's dozen, and favouritism was divided be tween Dolce and the Driller The starting apparatus was again brought into requisition, but the despatch was by no means a good one for Claverhouse and Clive were left at the post and the favourite was the last to get going Althea and Topsy almost on terms set the pace until well in the straight where Princess Olga who occupied a prominent position all the way came through and won a good race Confidence, Rosstellan Gerard, and M L A were the most prominent of the absentees for the leading event the Canterbury Handicap, and All Sorts was made favourite while Sedan The BOBS Tailor and Bendigo were consistently supported at the quoted prices Solon and Assayer cut out the greater part of the work but Bendigo came at the right end and defeated the favourite The BOBS Tailor who was pulling hard as they passed the stand dropped back last in the next furlong and cantered home An exciting finish was witnessed for the Selling Race in which seven took part, with Creeper and Frank most in demand, but both had their colours lowered by Reversion Despite his inglorious display in the Park takes, The Driller was entrusted with most investments for the Welter Handicap for which the son of Marvellous started a warm favourite, and, holding a good position from the fall of the flag he justified the faith reposed him by coming away when called upon, and won in a canter The programme was run through in the following order - HilODLr It RACE a handicap of 60 Sovs 2 miles -Air M Griffin s cb in Zingara by Sweetmeat Grace aged Ost dab (F Segas), 1, Mr H Baxter's tag bearing, a veto, mt LIV. lib (O'Dwyer), 2; Mr. J.
