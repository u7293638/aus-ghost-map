Prior I aticr delivered nn eloquent sermon upon bSfoccasion of tbeir assembling. The Very Lft. gentlemen took for his text the words rrai the 14th chapter of St. John's Gospel— 1 These things have I spoken to you abiding lira you, but the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, thorn tlie Father will send in my name, he riljj tench you nil things, and bring all bjlgs to your miud, whatsoever I hare raid j'jskrou." lie said that the work which tin Divine Lord came into the world )jCTiccom>)ish was tho establishment of iiMchurcii upon earth. For tins end he oRectcd around him certain poor men— tbe jratlcs. Those men were taken from tho umblcst rank of life, unlettered, rude nnd mrnnt men, having no doubt natural good QfUilies of heart, but still lmrd to tcacli , bard i.acnL with, very difficult to instruct, and hftc minds bad grown up in ignorance, iraof the ordinary duties of tlicir precarious oqc of livelihood. These Apostles were right by Jesus Christ for three years ; for iree years they listened to His Divine ss&is; of wisdom, nnd saw His glorious itlqns and tho miracles Ho performed upon ljWho came to Him in suffering and nfiiic- bag But even nftcr those long years in the ihool of the Heavenly blaster, they were lUjignornnt nnd did not understand the fbgs of God. When Christ spoke to them His Kingdom they understood it as the jriral kingdom and thought lie spoke of the staration of the glorious nation of the Jews. bai lie spoke to them of his being the Son rtqe living God, tlicy bad no doubt some ayijndefimtc nnd impartial knowlcdgo of batlthat great dogma, that great truth was. toyjknew not of the lloly tjpirit that was copic, they understood not the great mis- iaiphich Jesus Christ cntno into this world accomplish, which wns to lay down his e7lor the salvation of men. When that nf& loving Saviour spoke to them of his ; but they marvelled that hu should allow ; mjgjlf to fall into the hnnda of his enemies. 1 rora t'ic mouth f Cbri6t himself a \ ngibnrp correction of tho Apostles, upbraid : £$|em with their ignorance as not under- uSflng the things of . God . When in Christ's a ftmthcy worked miracles ; they, in their brocity, boasted of their power, they had " tjt learnt that it was not in performing . rages or. in doing mighty things, but In . xftmg for Jesus Christ they were to glory , H|| cross. Not only were the Apostles v WGro cowardly, they & nfo nt the same table with the Son of ' d,3t|icy had heard His words of gcutlc . idq and kindly, solicitude for nil, they lBitysn nun going aooumnu na« nenru min ' raqqnciDg benediction nnd pnrdon to the ' nejj|nnd tho .outcast ; auu yet in the s iqent of His trial all thoso three years of ppttioQship .with Christ— nay, even the J otilis adorable body and blood was gotftn nt thc voico of a servant, nnd the A PCMof the Apostles denied bis Lord ; i betrayed Him with a kiss, and all fled f « fear when the terrors of Calvary a ilybpon the bend of Jesus Christ. When tlsfc.work was accomplished there was but tc t of His Apostles and llis Virgin Mothcrnt f toe cross. Even after His rcsur- ' Uojthey doubted and ono of them said nless I see the print of the nails, and n\ , my finger into the place where the . j so'tfrn, I shall not believe."
