PUGILISM. BENNY MARKS v JACK CULLEN. PERTH, July 8. A privately-arranged fight for a purse of 50 sovs came off this morning in the vicinity of Perth, between Benny Marks and Jack Cullen, for tte light-weight championship of AVestralia. Marks had the advantage of weight, Cullen being the taller, and it was thought that the local man would just about pull it off, the betting being slightly in his favor. Cullen comes with a good reputation from the East. The fight, was to be to a finish. The opening rounds were remarkable for the caution displayed by both men. but it was evident that Cullen was the smarter of the two. The fritnds of the Westralian pinned their hopes on tiie well-known staminn of their man. In the fourth round things got lively, Cullen doing all the leading, Marks getting home with apparently smali effect. Fouls were claimed 011 both sides, but the fight went on. In the seventh round, had the decision rested on points and the number of rouuds been limited, Marks w. uld not have had the ghost of a show. It was evident that Mai lis' only chance was getting home heavily on the point, which he had done frequently in the past against other opponents of superior scientific attainments, and the odds appreciably extended. The eighth round, however, settled the matter. After the first minute's fighting, which was of a very fierce character, Cullen landed repeatedly on the jaw and neck, Marks fighting gamely but hopelessly, and he seemed but a chopping-block in the hands of Cullen, who, though he did not succeed in delivering the knock-out blow, was unquestionably the superior. Marks being hopelessly beaten, his seconds threw up the sponge. About twenty gentlemen were present and a substantial collection was taken up for the loser.
