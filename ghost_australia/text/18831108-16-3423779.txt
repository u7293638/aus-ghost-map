THE SOCIAL GHARACTEMM'ICS OF THE UNITED ST AT EH. -.- 12, (Do Archibald Forbes in the S. M. Herald.) the A VERY interesting phase of American "society" is its keen sympathy with things an artistic. Oscar Wilde went to America with a sham and self constituted mission, to infuse into its benighted people the principles of what he and the paltry iii agree work school of which he is an accident pinto about as "fine a t ' He found to his discomfiture e that cultured Amci means knew a great deal more about the principles of art than he could tell them j and that they had skin ned in a school the canons of which inculcated a higher ideal than could be attained by what business soever in sun flower and lily decor ition, spite of what he called the gaudy, leonine beauty' of the first vegetable, and the " tender grace " of the latter The people went to hear him as a divertissement, and "eyed" him ruthlessly Hie u tastes can be of America has been some what arduous and chequered People in a new country lines to begin at the beginning of things Go out to a bush shanty in the remote region beyond Inverell, or into the shepherds " humpy in Quel island, and you will find the logs or the Bank pasted over with illustrations cut from the graph and the Illustrated London News This is simply the evidence of the artistic instinct struggling to make the little artistic best of very adverse conditions The Ama leans began on bad copies of good pictures, and on spurious rubbish with which then ignorance was defrauded It was by dint of hard bought experience Unit they ripened into fastidious connoisseur Let me give an instance I know an old gentleman who lives in a beautiful house in the picturesque uplands which overhung the Rhineland like city of Cincinnati Many years ago he made his for tune in dry goods, sold out, and determined for the rest of his life to devote himself to art. Well, he didn't know anything about art, but he could learn, could the So he went to Europe and opened his purse Of course he got "stuck" with copious rubbish But he went to school on the rubbish, so to speak Next campaign it needed a higher style of rubbish to take him in and in the course of a long sedulous career of art investment He has ripened into a connoisseur of admirable taste and faultless atutantHs The wildest gotta up of bogus art of business will not now adventure the hopeless enterprise of throwing dust into the eyes of the day goods man His beautiful house, itself an art treasure because of the vin led beauty with which its interior is inlaid with native American woods, is an art museum of genuine taste and high intimate value But if he takes a liking to you, the old gentleman will reveal to you the steps of the ladder by which he has attained to connoissc«rship the milestones in the arduous costly journey Here is a room in the basement crammed with the veriest snipes lures simm 1 to use in vast, simm illina, sham old masters, sham tapestry y, seem to city thing Then, there is another room wherein most things are frauds, but li ss arrogantly ostrich pious frauds Yet another room of comparative genuineness, but of comparative humility also, representing a new di put mine into the realm of a rustic truth, but penetration only to the outlying fi Bulla s of that ultra li on this new birth the yet adits ml J'arnaimnn was severe indeed, but Uu upland path, if steep, was straight and well defined , but that path is illustrated in old Probasco's mansion by not a few chambers that are the cupboards wherein mc hidden the skeletons of his struggle with art Of Cincinnati society the two favourite avocations are music and pottery Probably the biggest thing of the kind in the world is Cincinnati s musical festival A vast building specially coast! until d, is devoted exclusively to the celebration of thundered fortnight of song Italian operas are given Colonel Mapleson takes thither the Company of " Her Majesty s savants," with whom he is the nu pressure of the New York opera season Patti has sung at the fabulous tales of about ten guineas a note, in the last two festivals There are concerts in the afternoon, the evenings belong to opera 'The Omi lunatics have themselves in the musical stream , it is no casual- dip-one concert of one opera it is de rigueur to hold seats for the whole festival These seats are sold by auction, and there is an almost crazy competition for more eligible ones The ceramic art study is less ardent, but probably more thorough The ladies make vases from the chastest classic models, as they (give the i cm to their own fancy in making others with no other model than their own ideal These vases, as well as plaques, cups and saucers, they paint with patient aspiration after the beautiful, the quaint, and the fanciful I call to mind some porcelain painting which the ice girls showed me in their workroom in a pretty mansion in the Clifton suburb On a set of vases of identical shape, severe, yet grateful, were depicted both mt plumaged birds flitting through a tracery of wild How ris, or pen bed on a spray in the heart of a maze of feathery foliage Each bird was of a different species, each floral er leafy setting was distinct The colouring was exquisite as was the picturesque delicacy of flower and leaf So far as my judgment goes, the palm for true artistic genius as well as for intuitive taste in composition, and for vivid accuracy in the charming accomplishment of flow of painting, belongs against the world to a lady of your own home, although it is Victoria, not New South Wales, which possesses her , but the work of those Cincinnati girls could at least have borne to be shown along side of hers The potter ladies of Cincinnati maintain among them an oven, wherein their handiwork is baked with due pains and skill But, indeed, pottery, flower painting, and music apart, Cincinnati is a noted art centre Some of your readers may remember the wonderful cartoons done for the long defunct Tomahawk by Matt Morgan That clever artist found it advisable to bid adieu to the shores of Britain, and he is now permanently settled in Cincinnati, engaged in designing for a firm of art publisher s, at a salary of 2000 a year At the risk e wearying the kind leader, I would fain have a little sketch of yet another " society " Before the war there were stately days and merry days in those fine roomy old mansions whose ornate fronts, showing over the low trees that stud the esplanade pleasure ground, still confront the cool Atlantic breezes that blow athwart the fairw incisor Charleston Harbour. Those were the days of belles and balls in the beautiful capital of South Carolina, of income pay able Madeira served at the tables of planters whose ancestry went back to our own cavaliers The earliest and the bitterest of all the seceding States was South Carolina Her capital was blockaded for years been raided once and again, rushed uptotheverj hill The old families, whose wealth lay in cotton and slaves, were broken utterly 'socially, but the men of them did live to know the pinch of poverty and Dr ""Tyrie title to the gallant blood Mt' * ' \ in their veins from the old way lad of the? died for the ,, n,PTT that they could do But, ah B ,L% the ladies whose tough had biwc*lnIT sparkle had been most wins the SCg ground itself into their soie,CTdena hunger, and squalor, and v gives to utterable.
