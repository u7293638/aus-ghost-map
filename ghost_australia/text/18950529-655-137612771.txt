Cricket. BALTUNALD V. COUNTRY. Tim (inn! Pennant match — n» far nn nettling tlin winnpr — wns pliivedjon Kriday Insl, and wns decidod in fuvor of tho to'vr, club. The weather was I dull und cloudy, nnd the attendance I not nearly so Inriie as it would have 1 been if Min public picnic had not been I held pii the saine day. Tho Bnlrannld i enptuin won tho toss and elected to go | to tho wicltois first, and with Gayfer ns i a partner fucedjiho howling of \V. and A. MncpheiMoii. Soon after cominein-j ing Harhen got a nasty knock on tho thumb, cndVnB'very nearly cauaht'out. i Guvfer played very nicely until ho? got a wi-ingur from Norman Brown, and retired with 14, to his credit. Black more was next, andgulso jmade 14 liy nice play. Meldrum baited very freely until his scoie had also reached 14, when one of W. Mncplierson's struck his liat high up and fell into the hands of N. Biown nt the wickets. Dr. Kelly ?andj IluyoR both' fell gto j n couple of lightning deliveries from Allan Mac pherson without breaking their ' duck,' the latter going out first ball. Donnelly wns next man in, and strange to say he also scored 14 before being howled by SV. Mncpherson. During ull this time Harhen had been jilayiiig splendidly and laying on the wood with great ef fect. He never gave tlie ghost of a show throughout his innings, nnd re tired eventually by a beautiful ball from Walter Mncpherson. ILnhen's score places him at the top of the list of batting averages in the three clubs, nnd thero-iH.no doubt that he has won the distinction by sterling cricket. Curry made 5, and Mozar knocked up ten in his usual fast manner, and the innings closed for 184. ?-?:?. .ThnTinnnfvv uoni.i'n W and C. K. Armstrong to the bowling of Meldrum nnd Bluckmore. Both bats men, played carefully till Armstrong retired l.b.w; — a very unsatisfactory way of getting, out — but one of tho tips and downs of the game. ' Edwards enmo in next, and though lie is not an artistic bat he ^managed: to place his hat ho tween tho ball and the wicket in a truly, wonderful: manner. Soon after ilie hopes of the Country team Went down to zero by seeing their enptnin plav one clean into the bunds of Gayfer at point. W. Miicphersoti is without doubt the most reliable li.it in tho Country team, and larelv retires with an 0 to his niune. ' The score then stood at. 2—12 — 22. Edwards mnn nged lo keep up his wicket until he had made a dozen, and then Meldrnui commenced nn attack on iho wickets almost equal to his peiformauce of last week. Edwards 12, I'aecke 0,' -N. Biown 0, W. Datgiu 0, A. Mncpherson 6, and P. Kennedy 0, all retired clean bowled by him, arid he succeeded dur ing tho innings }n obtaining 7 wickets' at a cost of 18 rutis.
