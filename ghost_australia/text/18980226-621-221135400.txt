THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE- Against tbe wooded hills it stands Ghost of a dead home, staring through Its broken light on wasted lands Where old time harvest grow. Unploughed, unsowed,-lbÂ£ scythe unshorp The pobf forsaken farm'fieldsl lie, ' Once rich and rite with" golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft. The garden plot no housewife keeps;-' Through weeds and tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom-clad, Sways bare before tbe empty rooms. Beside the, roofless porch a sad. Pathetic red rose blooms. His track'in mound and dust of drouth. Ou floor and hearth the squirrel leaves- And in tbe fireiess chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leaning -barn about to fall Resounds no more on husking eves; No cattle low in yard or stall No thresher beats his sheaves. , So sad so drear! It seems almost Some haunting presence makes its signs, That down yon shadowy lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine! Declined with thanks: "My Hut."
