DEATH OF MR. WALTER CURRY. On Friday news reached Cootamundra that Mr. Walter Curry, of Temora road, had been killed by being thrown from his horse; but it transpired that his death was the result of heart and brain affec- tions. It appears that he was out on horseback trying to round up a bull, and as if the latter jumped a fence and Mr. Curry's horse propped a good deal and that he had been exerting himself to an unusual extent. It would seem as if Mr. Curry had suddenly felt an affection of the heart, accelerated by his exertion, and that he either fell or rolled off his horse, as only a couple of scratches were visible about his face. The funeral took place on Sunday afternoon, and the cortege was over a mile long, the people representing all classes and the whole neighbouring district. The deceased, who was within a month of 71 years of age, was well known in Tumut, having been a constant visitor to the annual show for years. He was invariably called upon to act as a judge, and he never would accept a penny in payment of his expenses. He was a large-hearted man, and had the happy knack of making friends and retaining their affection. An interesting fact in connection with the deceased is that it was at his hotel on the South Coast that the late Sir Henry (then Mr.) Parkes made his famous Kiama ghost speech.
