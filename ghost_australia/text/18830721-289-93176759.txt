That men have infatuations about women past comprehension is an axiom as indis putable in life as that a line is the shortest distance between tvro points in mathematics. 'What does he see in her?' demand his friends angrily, and with justice. She may be vulgar, and even of dubious beauty, but no matter, she has fascinated that man, it nuv hp. fnr Aaxa or it mav be for ever, but though of mature age he will be blind as a newly-born puppy to her demerits. What does he see in her? Good .Lord! he could cot answer that question in the least. He would tell you that she was lovely, deny that she was vulgar, and assert noon oath that her English was faultless. Useless to reason ?with these infatuated ones. Safer far to emulate that astute philosopher who, upon condoled with, about his brother's mesalliance, quietly retorted, 'What is tbere to hoyl about? Charlie would never have been happy with a lady.' Mr. Cudemore was quite off his balance about Nid Foxborougb.. He had fair grounds for his infatuation. The girl was very pretty and had been thoroughly educated ; there were none of the ' vulgarisms mentioned above in her, but she had never given him the slightest encouragement, nor had he indeed ever been afforded much opportunity of pushing his suit; but for all that Mr. Cudemore was most resolute in his determi nation to marry her. He was working hard to s;et tile Sy rings, mainly into his own hands, and had already, as he knew, assumed a con trol there, to which he was by no means entitled. What distressed him at present was not Kid's indifference to his suit — that he was prepared for; but her mother's indif ference to the loss of the management of the oyrmga. isir. tjuaemore naa already a Dan cloned all hope cf carrying his point as a mere wooer, but he did think pressure about the Syrjnga might do wonders for him. To his dismay Mrs. iToxborough seemed toieare little whether site stayed or left. He had trusted much upon this leverage in tbe gaoie he con ceived James Foxborougt's death, had opened out to him. Another thing wiiicb. had goae awry with tbe money-lender was this. He was, of course, aware that Herbert Moranfc ?was his successful rival. He had held 'aoina buis of Siorant's, and Mr. Cuderiiare'd ex perience of young men 'told him that the first bill, like tbe first woodcock was but the pre cursor of the Sight. He had looked forward . at no little distance of time to having the young man most thoroughly under his thumb, but to his great astonishment Herbert Moraat had promptly taken up his bilh as soon as they, become due, andshownno wish. to contract fresh obligations ! consequent indeed on his love for Kid and desire to set to work to make a home for her ; but Mr. Ctidemore did not know all this, or I am afraid that maledic tions would have fallen from beneath his well- waked moustache, thick and thorough. He could not be said to having a rosy time of it altogether this jackal that preyed on the necessities of his brethren. Your pro fessional affairs may run favorably enough, but most oxen have some aini utterly outside that, and the mark that pavticulariyattraated Mr. Cudemore's attention at this moment seemed considerably beyond his attainment. Still he was of that pertinacious tempera mement that sometimes achieves the fulfil ment of its desires by its dogged perseve* ranee. One tbinjr, quietly as he had passed it by, had struck Mr. Cudemore during his inter view with Mrs. Foxborough — to wit, her statement that the police no longer thought her husband guilty of the Bunbury murder. It was considerably to bis interest, he tt ought, that Foxborough should be held guilty of that crime, aud he resolved to call vpon Mr. Sturton and endeavor to ascertain from him what Scotland Yard had thought of tbe information he had brought them. The great Bond-street maestro was at home, or, to speak more correctly, at his place of business. As for home, he resided in .a charming house, standing in excessively pretty grounds cut in West Kensington, where were plenty of servants, saddle and carriage horses, a French cook, a Scotch gardener and conservatories. His sons were at the universities, and though far more Con servative in their professions than their father, with much leas real reverence for a lord. As Coleridge had a contemptuous be lief in ghosts, such as he might hold in cab bages, because he bad seen so many of them, so had these young men discovered that hereditary rank was simply the result of suc cessful spoliation and corruption in the days gone by, and its descendants by no means gifted above the sons of men. Mr. Sturton was at bis place of business, and Mr. Cude more was at once ushered into the sartorial potentate's private sanctum— a simply fur nished room at the back of the shop, where Mr. Sturton, seated at his writing-table, was quietly engaged in answering the heavy batch cf letters which each morning brought him. 'Ah! Cudemore,' he said, in bis usual languid manner ; ' pray sit down ; excuse me for two minutes while I just finish this, aud then I shall be ready to talk to you.' A few minutes, and then Sturton threw down his pen, and pulling his chair round, said quietSy — ' Now, then, what is it 2' He and Mr. Cndemore were not wont to indulge in ceremonious calling upon each other. ' What did ihey say to you at Scotland Yard the other day ?' enquired the money lender, without further preamble. ' You needn't feel the least uncomfortable about any going there anyway, for your name has never been mentioned, while mine they promised to keep dark unless absolutely com pelled to bring it forward, which they did not in the least anticipate. I saw Sergeant Usher, the detective officer in charge of the case, and he said my information might turn out of great value to them, but would pro bably never1 lead to their requiring any evi dence from me, and that certainly at present they would infinitely prefer my keeping jniy mouth closed on the subject. ' I am told the police begin to think that Foxborough did not commit the crime. Is that true ? What does Sergeant Usher tbink about it ?' 'I am sure I don't know,' replied Mr. Sturton, ' and from what I saw of Sergeant Usher I should say he's very unlikely to let any mortal soul know his opinion on the sub ject till he's got some one on his trial for the murder. I should think he would talk affably and apparently openly with you for a week, and at the end of it you wouldn't have dis covered what he thought about anything. I see a good bit of human nature, you know; you can't help measuring men's minds a little while you are measuring their bodies— that is, if you are an artist. There are customers who never know exactly what they want, and whom you may persuade, to do anything. Others who equally don't know what they want, but suspect you if you attempt to assist the wobbling ideas that do duty with them for a mind ; there's the customer you can't please do what you will, angular in body as in opinion ; there's the man who hates trying on, hates ordering clothes at all, and pays ready-money; there's the man who delights in both filet, but abhors the latter part of the ceremony. Hasn't* Carlyle written a Tiook about it ; and, good Lord ! if he only had ma to prompt him. Ours is one of the great arts, and the day will come irhen it will be ac knowledged as such. You've R A.'s, and I don't see why there shouldn't be R T.'d ; and as the age gets more advanced and the general fusion of things begiui, there's no tioubt — there's no doubt whatever,' and here the great democratic tailor stopped abruptly, his tongue having a little overrun his defined opinions upon the . coming upheaval. A thing which, happens nctebly to many of our legislators, and aa eounts for the consequent abrupt termina tion of some of their bursts of eloquence with \vbic*h tfcey are wont to electrify their con stituents. Mr. Cudemore was of a narrow-minded but practical turn of mind. He stwed with un disguised astonishment while his friend delivered 'hisnself of the above rhapsody, but would, 'bad bis thoughts been put into JSrglijrb, have expressed himself somehow in this ?wise. All men bave their faults, I know. It's the vreak point in their organisation, wbich, earned to estess, mea called madness. Oaly I know Sturton to be a thorough liasiness, practical maD, I . should wonder why his fi lends didn't shut kim up, that is to say, if he ever let's out in this way to them. I ! hum, if I could, should charge him another ten per cent, for it. 'Then this Sergeant Usher didn't really tell jeu. be considered Foxborongh had nothing to do with the crime? ' remark-id Mr. Cudt niore at length, 'Certainly uot— what put that into your head ? ' .' Tbe papers, I believe,' rejoined the mcriey-knder careleeslj ; 'and then I mis iiEdtrktcod ycu about yout iaterview at Scot land Yard.' 'I told jou. clearly,' rejoiced Sturton, 'that TJsber, like a colorless photograph, ex pressed Dotting. Voluble, very, on occa sions ; tLat is, it struck me if I didn't talk ; but mute as a mouse when I'd anything to say. I know nothing about the opinion of Scotland Yard whatever.' ' Ab ! well, I felt a little curious to know ?what they thought of your confession,' re joined Mr. Cudemore rising, ' and also whether tbe making o£ it bad bro-Jgtt you peace of mind.:- ?* The sooner you understand 1 mean in variably to take my own way the better,' rejoined Sturtcn sharply, and with a quicx ness that tbe money-lender had never given him credit for. It is very easy to transfer such buEiness as I have with you to another of the fraternity.' ' And suppose I chose to bruit abroad our former relations afterwards,' rejoined Cude more, suddenly. ' ' I should deliberately and as assuredly ruin you. Fool that you are ! Can't gou see that small capitalists like you are at the mercy of the~ bigger men who employ them,' retorted Mr. Sturton calmly. All the leading men in my profession are reported to lend money to their customers whether they do or not. You can't do me much harm, but. my dear Cude more, I shall assuredly break you, I pull strings that your limited mind has no con ception of. *' I don't want to quarrel,' replied the money-lender. 'Unless with an object it's always a mistake, but when you run counter to my views I like to know the why of it. We'll change the subject. Hov about young H.Trtv«n4- 7j lio of ill rtn Tfti-it* linnlra '? Vio hna taken up all his paper ?:- ' Uo, that's the man who stands in your way with Miss Foxborough, isn't he ? He has squared up and left us, and when they do that of their own accord it usually means that they have taken to the business of life in some fashion. Flying kites and West End tailors don't quite accord with such utilitarian views.' The conversation was again verging a little too deep for the money-lender, and it may be doubted whether Mr. Sturton really comprehended what he meant by his last ob servation. A tendency to inflated language is one of the characteristics of all platform oratory of the present day. Air. Cudemore thought thers was no more to be said, and no more to be learned, so he gravely aud im- . pressively wished tbe Bond-street magnate good-bye. Somewhat staggered Mr. Cade more got out of tbe house, having found this man of so much tougher calibre than he had deemed him so utterly unmaileabie and determinate about having his own way. Still he did recognise Sturton's grim formula that when the brazen pots and the earthen quarrel it is bad for the latter, and felt tbat to suc cumb with grace to his principal's dictum was all tbat was left to him. He had been slow to perceive this, but was quite awake now to the fact that this languid man had a re osfc peremptory will of his owe, and was hardly to be turned from it. Musing over this, to him .by . no means pleasing discovery, he arrived at bis house in SpriDg Gardens, and proceeded, without going into his office, to ascend the stairs to his own private apartments. As he turned the angle of the staircase, he caught sight of his junior clerk— office bpy, perhaps, would more' fittingly describe bira — coming, as it ap peared to him, cat of his, Cudemore's, bed room. ' Wh&fc; the deuce are you doing ap here ?' enquired the moneylender, angrily, as the pair met. 'I came up to see if you were in, sir. There's a gent of the name of Sraithson want ing to see you terrible bad.' 'Where's his card?' enquired Mr. Cude more. 'Ee hadn't got one,' rejoined Tim, for such was the soubriquet by which this com posite of clerk and office boy was known in the establishment; doubtful even whether his master knew his legitimate patronymic. 'Show him up then at once,' rejoined Cudemore. ' He's left,, sir ; said he would call again in an hour, when he heard you were out.' ' How the devil did he hear I was out, you young cheat-the- gallows, when you have just made the discovery V * 'I told him I thought you were,' replied Tim, flippantly, 'and he wouldn't wait till I ran up to see ? ' 'took here, rny young friend, it strikes me yourre ljing on a pretty extensive scale. You knew I was oat to 'begin with.' 'Certainly, sir, but I was not quite sure you had not come in.' 'Clients who come to see me generally leave or produce cards,' said the money lender. ' Well, this one would'nt,' rejoined Tim, doggedly. 'And what business, sir, had you to sup: pose you would find me in my bedroom?' 'Idid'at I. went to look for you in youro sitting-room, and not finding you there ran upstairs on the off chance, the door being open I peeped in ; you were not there and I thought it best to shut it behind me.' ' I could have taken my oath, almost, you were coming out of the room when I caught sight of you.' ''Well, it may be I'd my neck and perhaps a foot over the threshold. I'm very sorry if I've done wrong, Mr. Cudemore, but this' gentleman was so urgent, and I really didn't know whether you were in or out.' ' 'That'll do,' replied the money-lender, curtly, 'but remember, if ever I find you above the first floor again you go, and with no recommendation for further employment from me.' Tim said nothing in return, but disap peared promptly to his legitimate sphere. 'Now what was that cursed young liar prowling about my bedroom for,' mused Mr. Cudemore, as he entered his sitting-room and lit a cigar. Chatter X.XTX.— Mobakt Meets Miss Hyde. When Phil went over to Dyke next day he was most warmly greeted by Mrs. Fossdyke*. ' Sincere congratulations,' she murmured. ' You can't think how happy you have made me ; that you two should come together has been the wish of my heart this year past.' 'Ah! I suppose Bessie has told you all,' said Phil, emphatically. 'All;' replied Mrs, Fossdjke, 'and I know what a wreteti I was to tease her about her past, but it waa not * altogether my fault, although at my age I've no business to attempt to shift the blame to other|people's shoulders.' *' Nobody ever doubted who the real culprit was, Mrs. Fossdyke ; but where is Bessie?' ' She will be down in a few minutes, but I asked just to have you to myself for a little. I'veknowcyou so long, Phil, and you've always been such a favorite of mine that I wanted to 'make my congratulations in earnest. She will make you a good wife, even though there be a stain in her pedigree.' ' I am very glad to hear you Bay that, Mrs. Fossdjke, for even assuming her stepfather is tbe guilty monster wbich he is alleged to be, and which every fresh discovery seems to make more doubtful, it would be too cruel to visit his crimes on the head of this girl who never even saw him.' 'I quite agree with you. I love her very dearly, and though, of course, I can't repress a little shiver as yet when I reflect upon her connection with that— that man,' faltered Mrs. Fossdyke, 'still, Philip, I hope you don't think I could be unjust to Bessie.' 'You were so not very long back,' thought Philip, but he gave no utterance to the reflec tion and merely bent bis handsome head. 'And now,' continued Mrs. Fossdyke, 'I want to see the other one, this Mr. Morant who is engaged to Bessie's unknown sister.' ' Certainly ; I was going to ask permission to bring him out here, as 1 want him to know Bessie ; but if I have leave to introduce him to you also, I shall be only too delighted.' 'Yes! I wast to know him. Is he nice? is he good-looking?' 'Good-looking! Well, we men never c*n quite tell what your eex will call ao, or I'd say decidedly not ; but he is a gentleman, and a * real good fellow, Mrs. Fossdyke. Ho'a been an idler so far, but he's got a wife to work for now, and, please ;God, I'll make a man of him * here. I'm bound to nay that, so far, he faces his work like a bulldog.' 'With that incentive to work and you as his tutor, Phil, I tbink he'll do,' said Mrs. Fosadj ke, laughing softly. ''But bring him out to see me, and III judge of his appearance for myself.' ' Certainly -' and as he spoke Miss Hyde entered the room, and greeted her^fanc^ with a bright smile, to which he responded by warmly embracing her. ' Bessie, I've juat obtained Mrs. Fossdyke's permission— nay, I say more, her command — to bring out your future brother-in-law for jour personal inpection.' ' You know I am as anxious to hear about my sister, and. make his acquaintance as Mrs. Fossdyke.' ' Yes, and 111 ensure ypur hearing about your sister,' returned Philip, laughing ; ' no intimate friend of Herbert's will miss that at present, 1 fancy.' ' . ' He will find me an interested listener, at all events. When will you bring him ?r- 'To-morrow, if that will euit you, Mrs. Fcssdyke, Lord, what friends you and he will be, Bessie! A woman who will be a sympathetic recipient of a lover's outpour ings about the object wins his devotion. He will at once pronounce lier a very paragon.' 'And pray, Philip, who is the confidant of your 'cutpo-orings V ' said Miss Hyde, laugh icg. ' I presume from what you say such a confidant is a necessity.' ' Oh, yes, my dear,' rejoiced Philip gaily, 'there are times when I feel it a necessity to dilate on your attractions, and then I'll own at first it came hard. Herbert has no idea of fair play. He expects me to listen for hours to prose poems about your sister, but I regret to state he manifests as yet but a cursory interest in hearing about you. Of course I also had to find somebody to rave to ; but I hadn't far to peek. I know an oid friend who says, Bessie, if he . could only take off twenty years you would have had to decide whether he or I was the best man, and he'll alwajs listen while I chant your praises.' 'Ah! that's dear old Dr. Ingleby,' said the girl, as she slipped her arm through her lovers. I hardly dare think yet, Phil, that we are going to be married, but if ever we are he will have had as much to say to it as the clergyman.' ''tiver we are, child!' What nonsense you are talking. You know, dear Mrs. Fobs dyke, that out of respect to your poor hus band's memory neither of us would wish it at present, but after a due interval I know we stall have your best wishes and permission.' 'My very best wishes and hearty con gratulations,' replied the widow. ' ' Now run away, the pair of you. I know you must have a lot to say to each other, unless things have changed a deal from the days when I was young.' ' Certainly,' replied PhiL 'I have got to teach Bessie woman's duties as a wife.' 'Oh, Phil, Phil,' said Mrs. Fossdyke, laughing. ' I know you both better. Only make her love you, and she'll want no teach ing on that point; but till you slip the ring on her finger it's woman's prerogative that 'her word should be law, and Bessie, my dear, don't be false to your sex and forego the privilege,' 'Come along, Bessie, come for a stroll and as' you are strong, be merciful. I bow meekly to Mrs. Fossdyke's decision, but don't command more chariots than a mere malster can afford you.' ' Don't chaff your wife that is to be, Phil,' said Bessie, with alow, rippliag laugh. 'You know very well till she came co Dyke cabs and omnibuses constituted her ideas of chariots. Ko, dearest, I can promise two things— to love you truly and develop no lavish ideas on the subject of expenditure.' ' A wise woman in her generation is Airs. Fcssdyke,' replied Phil, 'and if you'll only do the first I quite agree with her. I need trouble about nothing else/' A slight pressure of his arm acknowledged the speech, and then Bessie said ' Mind, Sir. Morant brings out Nydia's photograph to morrow. I am so anxious and curious to see it.' 'Of course,' replied Philip, 'but here -we are again at the gate. Still, Bessie, sajing good-bye to you now is not what it was.' 'I trust not,' she rejoined, softly. 'You . will understand how different it seems to me when I say ' Kiss me, Phil,' and, mind, I must see you to-morrow.' There was no mutiny on Philip Soames's part against his ladylove's first behest, and as he swung into Baumborough at a four-mile an hour gait there was perhaps no happier young fellow in the United Kingdom. Dash. into his own sanctum, he found Herbert Morant staring solemnly at the glowing coals. Lifting his head, that gentleman glanced at him for a moment, and then exclaimed — ' Ko, don't please ; I can't stand it. There's wedding bells in every line of your face. All very well for you, who see marriage within measurable distance, but for one to whom it seems a mere possibility of the future— Ah !' sighed Herbert in conclusion. 'Don't be a fool, and don't stare into the fire till oppressed with the doldrums,' re joined Soames, sharply. 'Your marriage bells are within very reasonable reach, if you only stick to the collar as you have doucfelnce you came here.' ' You really ftifalr I shall make a brewer-?' asked Herbert. \- 'There's no doubt whatever about it, and marry Nydia, and settle down at Batun* borough, and become a vestry-man, a town councillor, and half a dozen other things of which you at present comprehend nothing. In the meantime I'm pledged to-morrow to take you out to Dyke to introduce you to Mrs. Fossdyke and Nydia's half- sister.' 'You are awfully kind, Phil, but won't it— won't it be jast a little awkward ?' 'Not at all, that is all smoothed away. Both ladies are dying to see you. Bessie wants to hear all about her unknown sister, and if you give her about a tenth of the con fidence you bestow upon me there won't be much left for her to learn. ' 'Don't talk bosh, Phil; I've never said much to you ab%ut her.' 'Good Lcrd!' exclaimed Soames, 'am I like this ? Are we fonder when we babble of our love ? ; my dear Herbert, you discourse of little else.' ' Come, look here, old fellow,' exclaimed Herbert, suddenly rising and lightings cigar. 'I may chip in about -Kid when I get the chance, but you are usually haranguing to such an extent about the angejic qualities of Miss Hyde I never' get a fair opportunity to tell you about Kid.' 'Well, my boy,' rejoined Phil, laughing, ' you're not going to get it now. That cigar should about settle, your appetite for dinner. I'm off to dress.' 'Good heavens, it's not dressing time, is t ?' said Morant,. 'turning abruptly to the clock on the mantelpiece. 'By Jove, you arc right,' and as he spoke he hurled his fresh- lit cigar into the fireplace. ''Off we go, old man ; white tie and soap and water time! ' That he unduly discoursed about Misi Foxborcugh was a fact that Mr. Morant could not possibly be convinced of. To use a horribly common-place simile he was in the position of a man who snores ; unconscious of misdemeanor, he is not to be persuaded that he has ever been guilty of it ; but he looked forward immensely, to being introduced to Bessie. Although unaware that he gave rein to it, he did know that to talk about Kid to any one afforded him considerable pleasure, and, of course, from Phil's account was quite cer tain that Bessie was prepared te give ear to all he might say about her newly-found sister. Herbert Morant was duly paraded at Dyke next day, and cordially received by both ladies. 'Ko, Philip,' said Mrs. Fossiyke, in an undertone, as Bessie carried the new-comer off into the window to talk to ; ' there can be no mistake about it, your friend is not a good looking man. Ho woman will ever think so.' 'I never thought so myself,' rejoined Soames; but what has that to say to it 2 He is a real good fellow, and I don't think per sonal attractions, after all, have so very much . weight in love affairs. There are so many of us, both sides would never get married if we entirely depended on that. I know in old dayB how I have fought for a dance with the . belle of the ball, won it at last, and never pleaded for another. I suppose women are something like us; prone to be smitten in the first place by an attractive exterior, but an angel who can only valse and simper speedily disenchants most men who have any thing in them, and a plainer young lady, who can not only dance but talk a bit, gives her handsome rivals the go-bye in the long run.' ' You've won a wife, Philip, who can do both,' replied Mrs. Fossdyke, quietly. 'I know it,' he said, smiling1, 'but I am exceptionally gifted amongst the sons of men.' ' I most sincerely trust and believe you are. Nothing can bring my poor, dear husband back to me, and for Bessie's sake and yours, I wish the whole of this investigation could be swamped. I feel no desire for vengeance, and I should like the whole tragedy to be for gotten by the public.' . ' - ' Spoken like your own true-hearted self,' rejoined Soames; and then he thought how marvellously her great grief had transformed Mrs. Fossdyke. The rather petulant talka tive-woman he had originally known was transformed into a patient, considerate lady, taking a kindly interest in all those surround ing her. 'I am afraid, dear Mrs. Fossdyke, the authorities, in the interest of justice, will not quite allow that. .That the police are quite at fault this minute I firmly believe. You know, and. always shall, as much as I can learn. What they may think exactly I can't say, but so far, I fancy, they really are utterly nonplussed. ^ 'And it would be best they were left ao, for many reasons,' replied Mrs. Fossdyke, 'but this is beyond either your control or mine ; but, Philip, should there be anything to know you-wiil let me hear it, will you not?' ???--?*?? .: .. ? .„ ..-_-.;, ...
