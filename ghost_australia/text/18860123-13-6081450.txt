SATURDAY, JANUARY 23, 1888. Only Mr. S. L. PATTERSON could have delivered the singular and striking address to which the electors of Castlemaine were treated yesterday evening. That township is certainly specially favoured in the political sense. Carlton, with nearly double the number of electors, has to be content with such light as Mr. JOHN GARDINER can throw upon the subjects of the day, but Castlemaine is first illuminated by the setting rays of Mr. SERVICE, and is then shone upon by Mr. PATTERSON, who is moving up in the firma- ment. With these advantages the electors in question may possibly readily understand an address which, taken as a whole, will puzzle others. The interest that has attached to the speech rose mainly from the fact that there has been a strong effort to run the member for Castlemaine as against Mr. DEAKIN for the leadership of the Radical party. His EXCELLENCY has been gravely informed that he can set aside the advice of his retiring Ministers, and can overlook Mr. GILLIES and go to Mr. PATTERSON at once. Mr. DEAKIN, the party has been told, is credulous, while Mr. PATTERSON is estate. The one, it has been put about, is pliable, while the other has power. There will be some difficulty in continuing these tactics now. True, Mr. PATTERSON commenced by reminding his hearers how he fought the radical battles in times past, but, as he says himself, there is no value in these Rip Van Winkle stories, and the hits of his speech-and there his very hard hitting in it-are all at the expense of the radicalism of to-day. I Tide hon. member paid a visit to England some time back. He disappeared for a while from Victorian politics, and, according to his own statement he seems to have experienced the change believed in by the aboriginal, who goes down black man and comes up white fellow. The point to be decided is whether both sides will claim, or whether neither will recognise him. Mr. PATTERSON IS now a severe critic of the moribund Ministry. Of course, there is nothing in his assertion that Mr SrR^ icF stole his clothes, and proposed the abolition of patronage after the way had been shown in the Railway department Mr SERVICE and the constitutionalists, The Argus being foremost in the attack, were arguing against patronage and for a public service board when Mr PAU H SON, in his unregenerate days, was accused of depopulating Castlemaine by providing Post-office billets for every local applicant Apart from this the radical section of the coalition Government is the sole object of Mr PATTERSON'S delicate attentions "that the Government were devoid of " honest pluck was," he says) " several " times clearly demonstrated In one " case a notable offender was caught on " the floor of that House morn whence justice is supposed to emanate, and " we had to witness the sorry spectacle " of one section of the Ministry strain " in to shield, and indeed to excuse, " very reprehensible and very fishy " transactions and the other too weak to assert itself" Mr BERRY. and his friends were unwilling to punish the 1st innDSOV after his conviction and Mt PATERSON third 3 their conduct simply discreditable The hon. gentleman is quite right, but the Richardson Pearson section of the party, who were so very anxious that Mr. DEAKIN should not be chosen leader, can hardly be supposed to relish this exemplification of " astuteness and " power " The Radical party avowedly forced on the " grandmotherly " legisla- tion ofthepastsession Mr PATTEKIOVI comment is "I have seen what Icon " sides more unwary rantable meddle " someness against legitimate liberty " than during all my previous ever " perience Everybody wants to in " interfere with other peoples business When per SIM every e, industry), and '' thrift are no longer regarded as a " meet a man, and Parliament openly " flaunts its contempt for such qualities, " it does not promise well for the future " Very good time, but a very severe also, on the people who have been asking Mr PAIII-RSOV to lead them His remarks on the Mongolian question are well calculated to make the radical hair stand on end with horror. He recognises that the Chinese must be kept out of the colony, but he insists that those few who are inside the lines should not be persecuted, on the principle that though the rat is objectionable it is cruel and demoralising to torture the rat there were members, he says, "who went into ecstasies over " the idea of stamping the furniture " made by Chinamen, and judging by a their wild delight at the idea seemed " quite prepared in addition to apply " the thumbscrew to the hands that " made it One member threatened to move that cabbages cultivated by " Chinamen should be thrown into the "Yarra at its most pestiferous (Point, "and then sold to those/ who would date to buy them for "tunately, it was not pressed, a " it had, it would have been carried "N be were these members I Yv by, fM von politicians who have been told him. their one chance of success is to choose a chief who will best atone for their own mental deficiencies 'The weakness of the party its lack of bl am power is shown by the giving of such advice Had it been adopted, the Radical party must have been split in twain from top to bottom As it is, there is the initial difficulty that Mr. 1'mtnsoN refines to mar eli an inch with men whom he photographs as silly and mischievous nonentities the picture painted with power-is not ours, DUE The speaker holds aloof from the new Government, and the framers of the new Government will do well to dig his reasons Coalitions, li" says, saw" two leaders do not coalesce IT parties are apt to watch and to partly each other. What is needed is a Government with a strong individuality, stand- ing upon its merits against all comers. Such a Ministry, he argues, could be picked by some one leader from the best men of both sides, and it would fuse and form a whole. If Mr. GILLIES had been unfettered, this course might have been taken, and as it is, we can only hope that the members for Rodney and for West Bourke will recognise the principle, and will strive to form, not a two- party but a really national Government. If Mr. pATTERSon were in the Cabinet, he would materially help to effect the object. As it is, Mr. GILLIES and Mr. DEAKIN have the comforting reflection that their critic has rendered his opposition as harmless as possible. At the head of the disaffected radicals, he would have been a thorn in the side at once. But luckily, in place of blessing Messrs. JOHN WOODS, PEARSON, W. C. SMITH, RICHARDSON, and the other grumblers, he has buffeted them with severity. Instead of leading this host, he seems rather to present a point for disunited constitutionalists to rally upon, and the course of events must determine the chances of hostility to the new Government from that quarter. According to the librarians, the historical romance has gone out of fashion ferr WALTER SCOTT IS not in demand, nor BULWER LYTTON, nor the elder DcsrAS The story can be belies, ed so far is Victoria is concerned, inasmuch as there is a very good reason for it The public if it wants historical romances, can usually find all the action it requires road into the current politics of the day One day after another there is a constant simmer of expectation as there ought to be at the end of each chap terms to what next in particular the Education Act is currently dealt with from the standpoint of romance The favourite mode of treatment is to describe the constitutionalists as plotting against their own measure They passed it in she years back as against the radical leaders of the period, and the. have been cast for the part of the unnatural parent ever since One does not remember a general election in which the assertion was not made that the con stitutionahats were plotting against the state school system, and the tale is in full vigour this time Indeed, one young gentleman has gone so far as to assure Ina electoral audience that he has a firm conviction that Mr. DUNCAN GILLIES is to let ing the public in getting himself abused for standing to the measure, and that in his heart the member for Rodney is a denominationalism, or at least anadvo cate for a Roman Catholic grant there was one cage, politician, it will be remembered, whoaccusedPAL-itEitSTONofbeing a Jesuit, while another asserted that he was in the pay of Russia This sort of thing, however, is familiar as a Christmas ghost story the new departure is with regard to the Tasmanian treaty If that matter is dropped, we are told, it will be another " Conservative defeat" A "Conson tiveplot,"one paper has called the treaty The context shows that the reference is to the Constitutional party, so here we have the romance of history again in a mere matter of fact narrative, Mr BERG, and Mr IiANORiDar, two staunch radicals, appear as negotiating the treaty, and as an sw embie for every word it contains No other persons, according to this Mew, are entitled to praise or blame, but as the radicals want to get rid of the obligation, why they resort to fiction To make up for stealing the Education Act from the Constitutional party they palm the responsibility, for alleged defects in the Tasmania treaty upon it Romance is capital in its way, no doubt Better read Kemi worth and the fortunes of Niqel and Harold than no history at all, but it is just as well to understand m per using the current educational and treaty nant uses that they are pure fiction TheBenevolcntAsjlum Committee made a statement in their recent annual report which has been heard before), but none the less requires consideration 'line is that subscriptions to the institution do not increase, though the population and the wealth of the city do, and consequently the burden more and more fills uponthestate riiosubscnbersaroono small class who support all the charities, and the mk of the community stands aloof 1 lie committee fear that the citizens generally do not realise that though there is plenty in the land, there is want also old age, decrepitude, and suffering-and they make an urgent appeal for help from new sources Various explanations were suggested to account for the public apathy, but the real one, we venture to s t}, was not touched It is that the system of maintenance now in existence, though necessary, is anomalous the four fifths of the money comes from the State, the average taxpayer is apt to suppose, that his contribution has been obtained through the Government, and that he is not called upon to give to the collector also It is a misfortune that the idea has got abroad If it is continued, there will be no help for it but to Older the striking of a charity late, and we would willingly defer that evil day as long as possible Hence citizens may be asked to read the report, and to remember that it is better, is more graceful, and is more con- bonnet with Christi unity, to give voluntarily than to force on local taxation One wonders whether it would be any good for the leading charities to amalgamate, and employ collectors to invite subscriptions fora common charity fund This might press the responsibility more definitely upon the public than is now done At all events, we seem to be nearing a crisis with our charities, and it is well that the community should understand so much the state grant is not at all likely to be increased indeed it ought not to be, and the citizens generally, if they decline to pay in contributions must pay in rates The Bone volent Asylum Committee is intent upon moving the institution into the country, and its resolution is to be applauded, inasmuch as the present edifice is unfit and unsafe, and so qua es many thousands of pounds to be spent upon it, and the site itself is one neatly unsuitable The managers should not be in a hurry to sell, flower or, as the land, if leased, would be nil increasing in dowment Corporations can lease to the few, though Governments cannot to the many It is gratifying to hear, after all that has been said about } leading to the Par relate claims, that there are some men left with sense enough of the responsibility of government, to oppose the methods by which they are made Lord SALIMIURI, according to our correspondent, has been promised the support of sixty Liberals in any measure that he nifty deem necessary for the suppression of boycotting Probably they were moved to this resolution in part by the appearance of a boy dist deputation, which waited upon the leaders of both parties It would be an egregious mistake to suppose that the results of the elections indicate the unanimous opinion of the Irish constituencies Mr PARNELL certainly carried them before him, but there is a strong minority that still from an of useful to the British Crown Unfortunately, they did not pull their full strength, many of them, especially in the south and west, abstaining ft 6in voting through fear of the league , and a false idea was disseminated as to the relative strength of parties But the Irish Loyalist Society has done its best to counteract the wrong impression by sending a deputation to state their case to the foremost statesmen on either side, and to urge that parliamentary government should be refused to Ireland, on the ground that, it would lead to the dismemberment of the Empire Lord SAI insanity received the members and promised while not committing himself to any definite State ment of his intentions, that Ministers would never prove untrue to their loyal supporters Mr GLADSTONE' on the other hand, refused to see them, and waits for the proposals of the Government, like a reed shaken by the wind The incident illustrates the difference between the two men the one who is willing to defend the subjects and servant of England the other who has an scrupulously sacrificed them to please her implacable enemies New catholics, the deputation must have had weight with many Liberals By recalling attention to the existence of a local organisation it would encourage them to resist rash and time serving legislation if intended mainly to catch the votes of the disaffected and seditious In periods of violence the extreme section generally has its own way, because the rest of the community draws back from the conflict Thus the French Revolution was conducted by a strong who outraged at every step the wishes of their follow citizens the same tendency was very noticeable in Ireland where but little effort was made to "stem the tide of mtiomhsm until the present protest What has most to be feared is the timidity of the Loyalists and the sanity and recklessness of Mr Gunsiovc, who does not seem to consider himself bound by the pledges be made to the electors By asserting its principles family, even at this late hour when the elections are completed, the deputation will strengthen the hands of the Government in its endeavour to combat the prevailing law lessness No further steps towards the constitution of the new Government are to be taken during the next few days Mr Gillies will speak at Pelinna before definite arrangements are made with the members we who are spoken of as probable Ministers. 'The hon. gentleman addresses the electors of 1 Rodney on Thursday next Mr T B Patterson addressed a crowded meeting of his constituents at Castlemaine last night, and delivered a vigorous speech, which was largely an impeachment of the Coalition Government IhoretiringMmistrj, he said had neither police nor pluck and it would not be difficult to prove that cunning and cowardice were characteristic of some of their deliberations. Beginning well, the Coalition Government had ended badly Their machinations were a deliberately at tempted deception upon the electors and but for the vigilance of the Argus everyone would have been caught asleep The only prominent feature that could be called a policy in the programme of the Government was true about trophy law of political patronage find in that movement it was acknowledged that he (Mr Patterson) had led the way There had been more unwarrantable meddlesomeness against legitimate liberty in the last session than he had seen during the whole of his prevIOUS experience Parliament had found plenty of time to discuss the Byronic question of barmaids but precionslittleforthe consideration of the position of the struggling farmers on the parched plains, the Government had found time to engage in a lengthy debate and deny justice to the Mai Ion miners but had no time to legislate against the use of noxious fumes that were poisoning the digger in his daily avocation The Government had plenty of money to buy Murray Ross's so called nor was;, but what a fuss was made when a few pounds were wanted to extend a water race on a goldfield Parliament could preach for week son the ad vantages of federation, but had not a word to say about repealing the tax upon stock crossing the Murray, not a moment to spare on the Tasmanian treaty respecting which they distinctly broke faith with an intercolonial compact. The expense of Government had been immensely increased during the last three years, the coalition had been too strong for mischief and too weak to do right, and he was not in favour of another such combination Referring to the existing situation, Mr Patterson said that there was indeed no reason for a coalition at the present time. Parties in 1883 were united in their strength Now in 1886 it was sought to unite them in their weakness He indignantly denied the right of the retiring leaders to choose their successors An excellent progressive party could be formed by the country with one leader, not to? o leaders and it might be designated the party of progress as opposed to the Rip Van Winkle party the broad principle of responsible got ern ment could only be carried on by the will of the people finding proper expression in the councils of the country touching briefly upon other questions, Mr Patterson supported a comprehensive scheme of irrigation, and the maintenance of the Education Act. He denounced the system of distributing the prospecting vote as a paltry method of bribery, and characterise A the figures quoted by Mr Service on the decentralisation question as misleading Mr Patterson had an excellent reception and at the conclusion of his address a vote of confidence in the candidate was carried unanimously We publish this morning the first portion of an interesting description, by our special reporter, of the state of things brought about by the recent bush fires in the Heytesbury forest The devastation seems to have been much more widespread and complete than was at first supposed, while the narrative of the sufferings and losses of the residents in the forests SHOWS how urgent is the need for prompt and suitable relief A public meeting, convened by his worship the major was held in the Council Chamber, Melbourne, yesterday, to consider what steps should be taken to afford practical relief to the sufferers by the recent bush fires in the Heytesbury and Cape Otway forests Only a small number of gentlemen attended, but the enthusiastic manner in which they advocated the claims of the distressed settlers, showed how thoroughly they sympathised with the object of the meeting. The first resolution moved by Mr Gilles, gave expression to that sense of BJ apathy, and was carried unanimously A committee, consisting of a number of leading citizens, with his worship the major as chairman and treasurer, was then appointed to receive con- tributions for the relief of the sufferers. During the course of the discussion it was stated that the flames had in some places risen to the height of 100ft above the ground, and that in one case a woman had to take shelter with her children beneath the green stalks of the plants on a potato field to save herself from being roasted alive At a subsequent meeting of the committee, it was decided to convene a public meeting in the Town hall for the purpose of placing the condition of the settlers more prominently before thecitiiensof Melbourne Bishop Moorhouse and other public men will be invited to speak Contributions to the relief fund will be received every day from 9 to 5 o'clock, by the town clerk, at his office, for a hall buildings Mr W F. Walker, M.L.A., who is offering himself for re-election as the represents tire of the district of Boroondara in the Leg slates c Assembly, addressed a meeting of his friends and supporters at the Manchester Unity Hall, Hawthorn, last evening He expressed himself as favourably disposed to the formation of a new Ministry on similar lines to the present Government, and Sinn it would be a matter for regret if a party Government or a Ministry composed of gentlemen selected irrespective of parties should come into power at present He announced that he would defer speaking upon political matters generally until Mr Gillies had unfolded his programme, but he stated that he would strongly oppose any interference with the principles of the Railway Management and Public Service Act A committee was formed to assist in securing Mr walter 8 election The Licensing Act passed during the last session of Parliament will come into opera tion on 1 February 1, and the arrangements for it- proper administration are now in progress the Chief Commissioner of Police recently communicated with the various superintend dent, asking for reports as to the way in which the iB.p*ctio_o! the licensing districts could be provided for, and it is now proposed to appoint 19 police officers as inspectors of public houses. The net prescribes that no inspector of public houses shall be of less rank than a sub inspector of police, and it will be necessary to appoint four additional officers as sub inspectors of police to meet the case. the Metropolitan, Gipps Land, North Western, and Wimmera police districts will each require one of the new Bub inspectors, who will be appointed at the meeting of the t Executive Council on 1 area lay next Orders will also be passed on the same occasion setting forth the licensing districts which will have to be inspected by the various officers.

Most of the members of the New South Wales Commission will probably leave for Sydney by the afternoon train The Acting Premier has received a communication from the New South Wales Government, formally intimating that the agent general of that colony has been instructed to join with Mr Murray Smith and the other colonial representatives in London in urging the Imperial authorities to reduce the duty on Australian wines containing less than 30 degrees of proof spirit. The other colonies had previously agreed to co-operate with Victoria in the matter The Minister of Lands has recently received a number of applications from persons desirous of obtaining sites on the south bank of the Yarra, suitable for storing timber and other material. He has now decided to call for tenders for the right to occupy, under annual licence, BIX sites, each containing about 38., to the westward of the land held by Messrs. Gibbs and Mountain, and close to the mer. The licenses will be renewable for seven years, but if the land should be required for public purposes, it will be resumed after six, months' notice to the licensees, who will have no claim upon the Government for any compensation for improvements, or any loss resulting from the resumption of the land A conference took place on Thursday between the Minister of Lands and the Major and town clerk of Melbourne with reference to one or two matters upon which the City Council and the Lands department have recently been in communication. The council desired that the triangular reserve opposite the city Model School, and between Spring and Evelyn streets, should be vested in them for road making purposes, their object being to erect the Burke and Wills monument at the southern apex of the reserve, to with on the road in continuation of Lonsdale street eastward, and to maintain the rest of the reserve as a plantation Mr. Tucker agreed to the proposal to widen the road way, but declined to hand over the whole reserve to the City Council, he approved of the erection of the Burke and Wills Monument on the site proposed, and would make a permanent reservation of the whole block for tree planting purposes, on condition that the City Council would under take to maintain the fencing and keep the plantation in order This proposition was assented to by the Major on behalf of the City Council. The action of the Minister in calling upon the City Council to pay rent for the land near the gasworks at present occupied by them as a site for the storage of vehicles used in connexion with the cleansing of the city was referred to by the Town Clerk, who urged that, in consideration of the purpose for which the land was used, the corporation should be exempted from the payment of rental. Mr Tucker, however, pointed out that the land was worth about £10,000, and that while high rentals were being obtained from adjoining blocks, he could not allow the corporation to escape their responsibility to pay a fair amount for the privilege they had en- joyed free of cost for so long It was proposed by the 1 amis department about three 3 years ago to sell a large area of land formerly included in the old Model i arm, and immediately to the north and west of the loyal park The Melbourne City Court eil protested against the alienation of the property, claiming that it was practically a part of the loyal park. The sale was deferred, and the council recently asked the Minister of Lands to set apart the whole area, including about 100 acres, as a public park, and vest it in the City Council and the Board of Land and Works in the same way as the other city parks and gardens Mr Tucker, who was always averse to the alienation of the property, which he regarded as of. the highest value for recreation purposes has now determined to permanently reserve it, so as to prevent its sale without the authority of Parliament he area will then be devoted to the purposes of a separate public park, under the control of trustees who will be selected so that the interests of those persons principally concerned may be properly represented The Minister of Lands has decided to reduce the application fees which have to be paid by persons desiring to take up land under the act of 1884 At present a lee of £1 is charged for the registration of each application, and some persons have paid as much as £7 or £8 in fees without securing any land. It is now proposed to pass a new regulation under which persons who have paid an application fee, and have not succeeded in obtaining the land they desired, will only be called upon to pay a nominal amount for the registration of an. further applications made within the next two years In the) den riment Ga elie of last night appears the list of rents to be paid for grazing licences issued under the authority of sections 3 and all of the Land Act of 1891 A notice in last night's Government Gazette states that Judge ( Thornley has been appointed to take the courts lately held by Judge Casey and Judge Worthington those hitherto held by Judge Quinlan Die Gover nor with the advice of the Executive Connell, has approved of the following rates being, charged on telegrams, viz for the first 10 words 1s., and for every additional word lil, lodged at any telegraph office 111 A addressed to any of the undermentioned telegraph office in New South Av area near the Victorian border, the Government of New South Wales having agreed to a similar arrangement in regard to order rations in Victoria -New South Wales border stations-All ury Corowa, auston Houlong Mulwalu,'Moania,'locum wal and Wentworth -the -Ellerman Shire Council recently directed the attention of the Minister of Agriculture to the partial failure of the onion crop in the district for the last few years, and asked that names might be made with a view of ascertaining the cause of the dell ciency-. Samples of the soil in which onions had been grown with poor results were furnished to the department, and forwarded to Mr W. Johnson, of St Kilda, for analysis. A report has now been received from Mr Johnson, who states that the soils were wretchedly poor in phosphates and BUU phur, which are essential to the successful growth of onions. Of lime and other constituents there are sufficient quantities, and he recommends the liberal use of bone dust and gypsum for manuring the soda in which it is proposed to grow onions A copy of the report has been sent to the Bellarine shire Council. The chief inspector of stock recently forwarded to the Minister of Agriculture a report received from Mr. W. Kyle, inspector of stock, directing attention to the present unsatisfactory method of loading and unload- ing stock trams. Mr. Kyle asserts that the plan now adopted of loading the trucks by forcing the stock through the opening in the stores involves a waste of time to the Railway department, a considerable monetary loss to the owner of the stock, and cruelty to the animals One of the results of the animals entering the trucks through the side is that they stand transversely in the vehicles, and man) are thrown down and trodden on in the confusion of loading or while shunt- ing is being performed. In order to avoid undue crushing and injury to the animals, Mr. Kyle suggests that the method of loading the trucks through openings in the ends should be tried He thinks that by adopting this plan the sheep will be so disposed in the trucks that they will be better able to stand the shocks attendant upon the shunting of the trucks, and will be carried without accident The chief inspector regards the suggestion as important, and on his recommendation the report has been forwarded for the consideration of the Railway Commissioners. the damage done to the state nursery during the recent thunderstorm at Mount Macedon was greater than the first report received from the superintendent indicated. A further statement of the effects of the storm received by the Minister of Agriculture yesterday shows that; up wards of 600 young trees were washed away and lost that a vast amount of soil was carried into the reservoir and that the whole of the lower portions of the nursery were smothered with debris after the flood waters subsided the superintendent and his subordinates are hard at work repairing as far as possible the damage done New bridges to replace those destroyed will be erected shortly The Minister of Mines has decided that periodical reports upon the fulfilment of the labour covenants of mining leases shall be furnished by the inspectors of the department who will be required to personally inspect the mines.
