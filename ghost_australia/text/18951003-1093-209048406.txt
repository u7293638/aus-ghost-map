A GHOST AT HINDMARSH. A report is current at Hindmarsh (writes our local reporter) that a ghost has frightened a number of people there. It is alleged that "the ghost" has a coffin lid on his breast, and that by certain movements he terrorises night watchers. It has been common talk that a well-known medico was frightened, and that he gave the ghost a thrashing with a horse whip, but this on enquiry proved to be untrue. It is singular that although several persons are said to have seen the ghost, when these have been interviewed it happens to be some one else who has been visited by the appari tion.
