SELECT POFETRY. FOR THOSE WHO FAIL. 'All honour to him who shall win the prize.' The world has cried for a thousand years : But to him~ who tries, and who falls, and dies, I give great honour, and glory. and tears. Give glory, and honour, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime; Their ghosts are many in the vanll of years. They were born with Time in the advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater, many anl mlny a tile, Some pale-faced fellow who dlies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the main with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains front wine ; lBut the man who fails andl yet lights on, Lo, lie is the the twin-born brothser of mine. Joaogt'sx iMi,r,::.
