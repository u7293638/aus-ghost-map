The little party had not got on muoh further ere they were overtaken by George Grant, Bradshaw, and two other convict constables, all looking resolved to dare and do. George at once whispered to JBeaiy that there had not been the least «ign of treachery or double dealiDg on their parts. ??' ' This was highly satisfactory, and Bessy began to. entertain strong hopes of their succeeding in their enterprise, though in all probability, not without bloodshed, » thought which distressed her greatly. But 'she did riot flinch from the- pros-, peot of beholding, or if dire necessity re quired it, from even taking part in a bloody struggle, knowing well as the did that if they failed in their enterpriie 'Luoj Sebrlght would be hanged for the murder of Captain Ashton, which mnrder she regarded as having been almost a righteous act'nn'der the circumstanoes, though much she feared that, its remem brance', would torture Lucy's heart and conscience up to the day of her death, ? no matter how far distant that might be. i Whilst she was thus bitterly reflecting, jthe'-iittle party, of truly desperate men and women were rapidly approaching. the j shore, so that presently they had to move 1 with extreme caution lest they, should be jsfeen'J.by', the watch on board the .
