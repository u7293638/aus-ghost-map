Mrs. Lee took no tent, but read a pieoe of poetry entitled "lHimself." She bgan by resferring to Christ as a helper. He would be quite willing to do for us all we would let Him do, and to be all we would let dim be. He was a Saviour; and the preoher told thae story of her conversion through the agenoy of " Mil ton's Paradise Lost" and a littles B b!e. She had then made it all right with ahe Sariour for eternity, hobut had not done so Ir the present life. There came a time, however, when she learned that she needed a guide, someone who knew where all the obstacles and dificulties were; and Sens was suaoh a Gnide, for He had teen that way before. And not only did she want a guide, but she wanted a keeper, for ahe was always getting into trouble. So she took Chriet for her Keeper. There was something else that Jesos would be willing to be, and thet was onutained in the passage H e forgiveth all thine iuiquities, and healeth alldiseases." The speaker related how she had been an it valid for eight lers-net a day puassed with out her suffering pain. She had been to many doctors, and at last went.to one of the beet doctors in Melbourne, who said that he wrcud try to oura her, but be could huld out oery little hope of belog able to do no. The sum of money he mentioned as rsqeirad only to try was beyond her means, and she just went away and prayed to God either to heal her or tal e her home to Himelf. From that day bshe had been completely oared. Jesus wa also willig to be our Banker; audio this cooonnection Mrs. Lee referred to the great waste of money that went on in our midst.

Doring last year Â£60,000 was spent on totalisators, and gamil ing was both oovetiog and stealhng. Whet she sew the distress which prevailed she had prayed to God to send money; tou He had sentthe money and we had misueed st. He had sent the golden grain and we had turned it into a curse. She spoke of the waste which weot on tobsooo, 17ea. 61, pipes, and dirty little cigarettes. In conolusion, abshe urged those prenant to give all to God and get all from Him.
