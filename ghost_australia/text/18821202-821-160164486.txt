AUSTRALIAN CRICKETERS IN AMERICA. [From the Kew York Clipper.] Australians v. N. Y. Eighteen. Hie team sailed from Liveroool in the Guion ; steamer Alaska 30, accompanied by Midwinter, tlie -Gloucestei shire professioial, and after a pleasant Toyage arrived hero October 8, when they were wel • corned by a delegation from the various cricket ■clubs of this city and vicinity. After playing in this city and in Philadelphia they leave ban Fran cisco in the Pacific line mail steamer City of New York on October 21, and are due in Sydney on November 10. The game at Hoboken commenced on October 9, but this is not the first appearance of 'the Australian cricketers in the metropolis. October 1,1878, they played against an eighteen of the St. -George, Staten Island, and Manhattan Clubs, and the visitors fonnd some difficulty in defeating the ■eighteen in a two- innings game with s wickets to . fall, and in this game Murdoch, Spofforth, Boyle, -Garrett, A. Bannennan, Blackbam, and Horan of the present team played. The' feature of the contest was the remarkable exhibition of fielding and bowling by the Eighteen, which excelled that of any team of New York against an in ternational eleven. In the bowling Brewster bore ■cfif the palm, be taking 7 of the Australian wickets for 24 rims. This is, therefore, the second appear ance of the Australians in Now York, and the game which began on the 9th on the St. George Grounds was a two days' match against an eighteen picked from the St. George, Staten Island, Manhattan, Newark, and one or two other clnbs. On both this and their former visit the Australians were favoured with the finest weather they could have had, bnt in 1878 they had ahatsman's wicket, while in this game they played on a bowler's wicket, the majority of batsmen on both sides having bnt little chance to -score. The selection of the Eighteen was a poor ■one. and, though it was known a month beforehand that the match would take place, not once was the Eighteen given any field-practice worthy of notice. Though the services of Brewster, too, were at com rrand, they yerenot taken advantage of, and instead of having fine fielders the selection was made on the the basis of batting strength, and the result was a lamcntablefailnre. Itisnotwerth while to give much space to this match, for it was—with the exception of some of the bowling—the poorest exhibition seen in any of our* international contests In this vicinity, anditwas in striking and most inferior contrast to the play .of the eighteen of. 1878 against the Aus tralians. The New Yorkers won the toss and went to the bat to the bow) tag of Spofforth and Boyle; and of the whole Eighteen but twolmade even the ghost of a stand against these bowlers. These two were I,sue and Lambkin, the former being in for half an hour for 3 runs, and the latter for nearly the same time for S. Mart was badly missed by Bonnor after scoring 8, and Boyle gave Captain White a life. In fact, several liveB were given, the visitors not fielding up to the'mark. Alter anhonr and a halFs play the last of the Eighteen was disposed oi, the innings closing with the score of 27 runs, two of which were extras, Mart's 5 being the highest. Spofforth took 10 wickets for 12 runs, and Boyle 7 for IS. At S p.m., after lunch, the Australians went in to the bowling of Lane and Mart, and. to the surprise of the crowd, the fourth wicket went down for 82, Bannerman and Bonnor scoring dnck-eggs, and Massie and Horan less than double figures, Lane took 2 of the wickets, and Mart and Cleverly the other two. Then It was that Murdoch and Gflfen got in and made the only stand of the day's play, and but for two failures to accept chances for catchers off Murdoch's hat, after he had scored |U runs only, the Australians would have been retired for less than 70 runs. Asitwas, their ninth wicket had fallen for 110 only when stumps were drawn for the day. The game was concluded October 10, in favour of the Australians, with seven wickets to spare. The result would have been a one-Innings defeat for the New York Eighteen bad not Captain Murdoch at tempted to prolong the game in order to swell the gate-money receipts. As it was, as soon as the time drew -near for drawing the stumps, Spofforth and Boyle were put on to bowl and quickly disposed of the Eighteen, and the meagre number necessary to win was {soon obtained, nlthongh at the cost of three wickets; The score NEW YORK EIGHTEEN. \- First Innings.
