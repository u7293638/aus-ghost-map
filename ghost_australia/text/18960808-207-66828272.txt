Depew on Superstition. "I am not superstitious," said Chaun cey At. Depow the other day. "I no not believe in witches, spirits, elves, vam pires, ghouls, or ghosts. Nor do I be leve in an evil genius, the evil eye, a bottomless pit, or a devil with horns and a cloven foot. I would not pass a night in a church or graveyard with a corpse, because that would be an uno pleasant and unprofitable way to spend a night. I would wear nothing in the nature of a talisman or mascot and never carried a lucky coin. As to sit ting down witl thirteen at a table, that is one thing I would not do. But I re spect the superstition, not because I am superstitious, but because I do not want to feel uncomfortable. A good dinner consists in something more than things to eat'and drink. Its pleasure depends more on the subtler elements of good company, minds at ease and attuned to harmony with the spirit of the occasion. If your dinner is to be made uncomfort able by a mournful or unpleasant feature of this kind you might better stop at a restaurant and swallow a dozen oysters. You could at least then have a pleasant chat with the man behind the counter while be opena your oysters,"
