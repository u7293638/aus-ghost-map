Tno Christian basilicas took rank above the other churches, and like the courts of justice whose Bites they occupied, were alv, syi, open. T be Roman basilicas havo undergone many changes in modern times, but they still retain their old task as metropolitan churches T bo first of these, and «funding on tho ancient basilica dedicated to the patron saint of Borne, is tbo groat Cathedral of St Peter It bos nono of the peculiar features of its predecessor, tut retains, nevertheless, the name of a basilica , and its doors therefore stand always open It is asentid bj tradition that St Anacletus, Bald to have been oidaintd Bishop of Roma by St Peter himself, built an oratory, in the year 00 ef our era, on the site of the pre- sent structure, to luntk the spot »litro tho remains of tho iipoetlo were deposited aftir hie crucifixion on tbe bill of San I ulio in Montorio, and wbero so mai y ni lho early Chris- tians had suflircd martyrdom lu 306 Constantino the Great built a basilica ou tho site of this oratory, and pil triiiis bigan to resort to it in great numbers lhe facade of this basilica is represented in a fresco painting in the subterranean chapel of the Church of Santa Marm in 1'trtico und also in one of Raphael's fresoocB in tho Stance of the Vatican. As this basilica decayed in process of unie, mun) Popes and many architects undertook to ropair ar ii rebuild it, and at length, after many chaoses and iiiitBliudis, Michael Angelo being empowered to undi rtake the rebuilding of lho edifice, with full power to pull down sr modify tbo work of his predecessors, tbo yient arlie!, then in his seventy second year, strengthened, irilurgtd, aid carried on the building, partly in accordance with the designs of his predecessors, partly after his own Tbo great domo was built cutir ely by him, after his own plan, ond is, ne ho declared it ahould be, '. « Pantheon in the air" Ihm dotuo of the vast tupola was completed just before lho death of it» great designer, at tho age of eighty-nine. Giuoomo della l'orta was employed to finish the ornamentation of this dome, aud was so anxious to slmro with Tope Sixtus V the honoHr of its entire oom jleticn, that he employed six hundred workmen upsn it, retrying on tho work without one moment's intermission, by night or by day. It is impossible to compute the amount of money that has been expended on the completion (f tho modern church, during the pontificate of Sixtus V the sum of 100,000 gold crowns was devoted annually to tie construction of the great domo alone The plan of the church was repeatedly changed. Raphaol had drawn out his di sign for the great church on the plan of the Latin cross, Michael Angelo changed its firm to that of tho Greek cross, Maderno, by whom the churoh WSB finally completed, returned to the plan of the Latin cross, and built the facade, which, what- ever its richness, is open to the reproaoh of entirely concealing, not only the two smaller lateral domes, built by Vignola, but the great one which constitutes its most splendid and dietincuisblng feature. fono idea of tbo grandeur of the scale on which this un- equalled church hub been built may be formed from the fact that it has required three centuries and a half, and the re siurces and ingenuity of forty-three Popes te oomplete it Bed the crigmal designs of its first architeot Bramante, been persevered in, the buildings would have covered eight hnglish acres , eu. it is, they covor 240,000 square feet By the elote of the seventeenth century, above eloven millions of pounds sterling bad been oxpendod on their construction , Julius If. and Leo X baling resorted to the eulo of in- dulgences to obtuin funds for this purpose-thUB creating the leaction that led to tho Reformation To icoch the great basilica from tho Foreign quarter, i nu drive through dirtv and nanow streets, and oross the liber by the old Pons ¿.has, now called the Bridge of bt.

His successor, In oidor lo increase this security, built the oovered gallery which now unites that old fortress with the Vatican, tunning along the line of the old Leonine wall, bince that perlrd, every successive Pope has mado it a point of honour to enlarge and beautify this palace, and to increase its numerous collections It sounds rather odd te hear of so xealous and able a Pope as Julius II, planning, among other additions, a vost amphithéâtre in , the midst of the Papal residences for bullfighte and publio ' games, but it is certain that he did miks this plan, though he did not live to carry out au intention whioh, for lhe honour of his successors, none of them appear to have adopted, though each has added seme new and splendid feature to the pile lhe present Pope has enclosed with glass Baphael'B famous frescoes in the corridoT of the great Court of ¡sun Dania^o, and is completing the deuiration of theeo corridors He bos removed the unrivalled gallery of pictures to the roof of tho palace, where they are ex- hibited with all those advantages of light which could not be commanded on a lower story, the who e ot thi¡> vast pile being built round courts, has built the magnificent Royal ttaircase, by which the repreeentative of ' the Carpenters Son ' citera his private apartments-sumptuous as the stairs by which they ate reached-only royal guests being allowed to mount these stairs except by special permission, and is now decorating with frescoes the apartments for- merly containing the collection of paintings, and which will henceforth serve as reception-rooms for ladies admitted to tbo heiiour of the Papal presence. 1 hu Vatican m fact is rather on agglomeration of buildings than a regular edifice, end is imposing rather from its size than any architectural beauty. It occupies a space 1150 feet long, by 767 in breadth, and contains eight grand staircases, two hundred {maller ones, twenty courts (all built round to a height of many stories), and Jour thousand four hundred and twenty two looms, of which an immense number ure enormously large. lhe unrivalled museums of ancient and modern art, the growth of many centuries, and the result of enormous out- lay, are opened to the publio on certain days of the week. lo describe, in detail, the contents of galleries so numerous that tho enumeration of their names would almost fill a letter, is simply impossible lhere are the galleries of Etruscan, Greek, and Boman Boulpturo and antiquities, of inscriptions, of butts, oi bas-reliefs, of sarcophagi, of Egyptian antiquities, Le., the füllest, tho most numerous, and the most valuable extent lhe various collections are opened, at the stated hoars, by a body of the Papal guard, m the whimsical costume described in my last, who march through them with sonorous and rapid tread , the visi- tors who havo collected at tho various outer doers of admission entering in their wake. These gusids, among whom yon rarely find au Italian take up their posts at various points ot the gal tenue, htlberd in hand, and keep watch over visitors and trcasuras during the hours of admission lhe greater portion of the galleries of tho Vutiomare da void of ernamtnt, merely long, vaulted rooms, f Jil of the glorous relics of ancient art, some few of them, however, having been built for other purposes, aro richly adorned with marbles, mouldings, and columns in the usual Italian style The Faun of Praxiteles, tho Torso, Apollo, Anti nous of the Belvidere, the Young Augustus, the Toocoon, the Amaron, the Discobulus, Mellagcr, Demosthenes, Mer- cury, Minerva Redica, and a host of others with whose names all are familiar, are but the most magnificent among crowds of rivals scarcely less superb , works in which ma- terial, conception, and execution combine to excite the wonder and admiration of later days . Among the most curious of these collections is " The ball of animals," containing such a surprising; and varied gathering of beasts, birds, and fishes, and reptiles, all re- covered from the excavations, as to have received the very appropriate definition of a " menagerie m marble " Few things ia ancient art bung moro vividly before the mind the great fact that the human race, of all climes and of all times, forms but one identical family, than does this curious collection of crea- tures so familiar, in attitudes so perfectly natural and truth- ful, and looking as though they might have been taken from the fields, the woods, the rivers, and turned into stone fin VlOnr R*n tro Anvrtn av,r,liamta,-'a u.n^ lo give rome idra of the length of these interminable galleries, it may suffice tossy that the Etruscan antiquities alone (one of tbe least numerous of them), fill thirteen large rooms. As to conveying any adequate idea of tha beauty, grandeur, grace, majesty, intensity, vivacity of the masterpieces of the ancient sculptors-the admirable charm and delicacy of ancient pottery, gems, and other objects of use, the subtle perception of harmonious relation, whether in linee, coieurB, forms, or the juxtaposition of different subetancee—no description, however ela- borate, ceuld do justice to such a theme. The old Greek gods seem to offer the highest ideal of the possible perfection of the human type ; and inasmuch as we may well hesitate to believe that even a Praxiteles could imagine an ideal more perfect than that of his Maker, we may measure the shamefulness of our neglect, in regard to the possibilities of humanity, by a comparison between these glorious men and women of marble, and the stunted, ill-formed, wiry, obese, dyspeptic, gouty, rheumatic, hysterical, and crabbed products of social habits, into which sedentary indoor occupations, tight and heavy clothing, sloth, overwork, starvation, gluttony, tobacco, ignorance, prejudice, and inattention to natural law, ewer so largely. Tho collections in question are on the ground-floor; tie famoUs loggie and chambers, painted in fresco, principally painted by Raphael and his pupils, are up stairs; the picture gallery, the finest in the world, despite its small ness, is cow in the roof of tbe buildings round the great Court of San Damaso. The famous frescoes are emily im- paired by damp and neglect On the well-known prin- cipio of "shutting the Btable-door when the steed is Fielen," the attention of the Papal authorities is now 1 eipg given to the preservation of these great work«. Tbe loggie- mere open corridors, outside the buildbags of Ibis court-on whose walls Raphael bestowed the creations of his genius, have been left exposed to the wear and tear cf the atmosphere, and the carelessness of rervarts snd passers, until the reign of the present Pope, who has enclosed these extcrisr galleries with glass. They constitute a portico in three storeys high, one sbsve the either ; the two lower being supported by pilasters, the upper one by columns. It is on the wall of the middle one that Raphael's designs from Scripture history were painted, partly by himself, partly by Giulio Romano, Pierino del VDBB, Fellegrico da Modena, Francesco Penni, and Baffaelle del Colle. It is divided into thirteen arcades, sustained by pilasters, covered with ornaments in stucco and arabesques, painted by Giovanni da TJdine, from designe by his master (Raphael), who is said to have taken tbe idea of tbeee charming fancies from the paintings beneath the baths of Titus, which had then just boen dis. covered. Figures, flowers, animals, mythologio subjects, and geometrical shapes are combiued in these exquisite 1 creations with marvellous elegance and the most bewitching grace of fancy, though seriously injured by the troops of Challes V., and by tho restorations of Sebastiano del Piorobo, Ihey are still extremely beautiful. Each covered vault of the thirteen arcades contains four subjects taken from some particular epoch of Scriptures history. The entire teiiee, therefore, numbers fifty-four ; of which, tho first arcsdes represent histories from the Old Testament, while tho four paintings of tbe last are taken frota the New, 1 be long exposuro of these bountiful compositions to tho weather bee almost reduced them to the squalid paleness of the ancient grotesques; but those who saw this gallery just after its completion, when the lustre of the gilding, the snowy whiteness of tbe stuccoes, the brilliance of the paint- ings, and the freshness and polish of the marbles, niado every inch of surface resplendent with bsauty, speak of it as " striking tbe beholders with amazement, as at a vision of Paradise. ' Vasari, in alluding te it remarks, " it is im- possible either to execute, or to imagine, a more beautiful work." Adjoining the '. Loggia of Raphael," are the four " Chambers," called aleo by nis name, painted in tho same way from his designs, and completing the plan-a sort of oycle of biblical and ecclesiastical history-of which the Loggie contains the first portion. Ite two other loggie are painted in similar style; but though containing many beautiful composition.!, are not to be compared with that of Raphael. A part of the uppermost, out of which opens the gallery of paintings, has been covered with landscapes and maps, ainted on tbo walls ; some of the latter, done under Pius V., giving curious proof of the imperfection of geographi- cal knowledge in his day. The renowned gallery, containing only the very cream of the masterpieces of the greatest painters, contains five halls, literally built in the roof, lighted on one side only, painted of dark olive-green, er hnng with dark crimson, to whose « »Ile the paintings are hung, on swivels so as to be brought easily out at angles from the walls, varying accordinz to the ihasges In the light. As yet, «sly forty-two paintings have been found worthy of a place in this unrivalled cabinet. Amongst them are " The Transfiguration," last and greatest of Raphael's works, and considered to be ita finest oil painting in the world ; his " Madonna da Foligno," scarcely lees splendid; his -'Coronation of the Virgin," and thrco small but exquisite works illustrating his early manner ; Domenichino's masterpiece, " The Communion of St. Jerome." which, among the world's paintings, ranks next to Raphael's Transfiguration : betides these Titian Leonardo de Vinci, Ferngino, Murillo, Audrea Manteguo, Fra Anglieo, GozEoli, F. Francia, Crivelli, Garafalo, Gueroino, II »loretto, Piuturicchio, Sacaoferrato, M. A. Caravoggio, 1 Guido, Andrea Bacchi, Paulderouete, Beato, Baroooio, Alumino, Nicolas Ponsein.'Melonso de Forte, and Giulio Re- mano are the only painters admitted to the honours of these exclusive walls The latter artist, moreover, might justly ccmplain of being represented in this collection of marvels, by me of the poorest of the works attributed to him, evi- dently painted mainly by his pupils, and giving anything but a fair idea of hie magnificent powers One never hears a word in this gallery The effect of the paintings-most of tbcm of immediate size, and in superb frames- is almost like that of living personages. Their splendour of colouring, dignity of attitude and expression, tbe vivid tendering of the scenes and emotions they pour tray, impress the beholder with a feeling of reality, a sense s f life and earnestness, and power, that seem to oiuse the least imaginative to move "with bated breath" in the ireecnce of these grand ereationn of human gcniuB N» "guide" persecutes you with the usual gabble of his clasB as you move slowly through the gallery , the few copyist« who are at work, perched on high stools painfully endeavouring to make their oopy what a copy can bardly be, ait absorbed and as silent as though in a church, and tbe dignified official, wh« answered your ring at the door of the gallery, let you in, and looked you in (to make sure of your feo) with BO grave an air of digni- fied propriety, and who will receive your offering and bow you out again with the same air of tranquil grandeur, re- mains at his peet in the ante-room, and troubles not your meditations Not a eound from that noisy onter world that IMS so many storeys below you, penetrates these solid and lofty walls If you steal to the side of the gallery, climb softly on to a stool, and take a quiet peep out through the bread low windows, you will get glorious glimpses of the city and its beautiful environs, and will see the flocks of Roman pigeons and swallows careering in the clear and perfumed air that environs you Bat, for all tho noise you hear, beyond the coo of a pigeon, or the scream of a swallow, yon might fancy yourself transported to como world of shadows. lime passes quickly in such a place as this marvellous gallery, with it« softened lieht, its tilecco, its shadowy inlaid floors, and the noble company of buróes, martyrs, earate, angels, and cherub! looking down upon you from the sheets of glorified canvass on >tB walla, and before you have begun to think of going away the deep boom of the great dock pulses through quiet, the gallery ia invaded by servants, wh«pioc6od forth- with to closo up the shutters, and you find that the moment has arrived for locking you out of the gallery The library of the Vatican is extremely rich to M 8 S. rare works and editions, paintings, gems, statues, vases, and art treasures and curiosities of all nges The ante- room boa a series of portraits , the Chamber of Seribei stalls of niagsifloant întarsia-work, and tables for study and writing , tbe Great Ball, 220 feet long, is magnificently ornamented, sad centaine cplendid tables, vases, &o; , gifts of ImgB and princes-the bookB being abut np in presses in the ihewallB, the galleries opening from this are 1200 feet long, full of books, Illuminated miesala, manuscripts, papyri, and objects of art. The Raphael tapestries are in another suite of rooms, great pieces, much faded, ef which the great artist furnished the designs. the gallery of maps, neely COO feet long, the manufactory of mosaics, and various other portions of this interminable building, all demand, and richly repay, a visit. In the latter are made, among otber things, all the pictures required for St Peter's, ihe number of enamels of different tinta employed in them is 10,000, a large picture often takes ten or a doz°n years to execute , even the rough portraits of the Popes now being Executed for tbe basilica of St Paul Without the Walls destined for a lofty position, in which delicate work would be invisible-will take a year's work apiece The mag- nificent landscapes, table-tops, and pictures produced here, are generally presented by the Popes to their crowned friends and favourites Tbe portions of the Tope's apartments you are admitted to visit by ticket, are as splendid and ornate as other royal dwellings , the guard-room is an immenso and highly ornate hall, filled with the motley liveries described in my lost 1 he pontifical almonry ia also worth a visit, and con- tains the tren armour of the Constable de Bourbon, whose cruel end stupid pillage of Rome has inflicted far more harm on ber buildings and her art treasures than was ever caused by the so callsd "barbarians " Among other curious things in the gardens of the Vatican are two great peacocks, and the colossal fir cone, of bronte, found in the mausoleum of Adrian, when that building wa« converted into the fortress of St Angelo, and supposed to havo etosd on its eummit.

In spite of which prohibitory decrees, I was not a little amused, en looking out of a window, to espy, in a little detached inner garden, apparently belonging to the house of some of the upper ser- vants, a flannel petticoat, and other articles of the toilet essentially feminine, boldly drying on lines stretched across from side to side of the little high walled, sunny, and per- fumed enclosure, full of vines, roses, orange, cypress, jessamine, and lentiscos. Borne, Wednesday, August 26. It teems tolerably certain that the Bourbonlans have been buoying themselves up with the belief that the Neapolitans, diststiefled at being no longer in possession of a Court, were really going to make some sort of "demonstration" that was to open the way for their return It appears hardly credible, to those who happen to have even a very slight acquaintance with the southern ex capital and its pecple, that people ofaverage common eenie can hold au idea to veiy wide of the mark, and one cannot but marvel that the people in the train of Bombalino con so far mis- judge their countrymen, however natural it may Beem tbut their manier should fall into such an error Bom with the ftuallefit modicum of nina, this wretched detcendant of a cerrupt and obstinate race has been reduced to something little tetter than ldircy by the influences to which he has been tutjected from his cradle His intellectual training bas censiEtcd simply in the inculcation of the narrowest and mott bigoted tenets by the priests who have been his sole preceptors, wbile, if one tenth of the horrors imputed to the Queen Dowager be true, the corruption of her half idiotic stepson has been the object ol her ty steinalte effort. It is constantly assorted here, and generally believed, that Bomba's second wife, in the hope of securing the tucccesion for her own son, the Count di Tram, has systematically directed the ignoble temptations cn which she counted for the utter destruction, moral and pbytical, of the ugly, weak, and drivelling youth who stood between her own vety different son and the Crown, That tbe has succeeded m her diabolical selfishness is admitted cn all bands, but great satisfaction is expressed by her enemies-and they are "everybody"-that her horrible machinations aro not, in any case, likely to ensure the criminal end she has laboured to accomplish by the most criminal end disgusting means Por even were the Bour- bon 8 recalled to Naples, the Count di Irani bids fair to re mam as childlcsB as his elder brother, and his mother's atrocities would thus, it is hoped, receive their appropriate punishment, even if, par imposable, the Neapolitans should ever take it into their heads to recall the rulers in whose over- throw thev to heartily rejoice The dowager IB a violent, haughty, vulgar woman, loud and brutal in speech, and lunonely jealous of her stepson's wife She constantly used her Influence against the unhappy Princess sacrificed to family compacts, wbote beauty, spirit, and liberal ideas were so many eyesores io the old ex-Royal virago. To lOBinttin her old supremacy over the weak mind of the drivelling TrsnceECO, she has Bet herself incessantly to the agreeable work of snubbing, insulting, circumventing, and ncuojiEg tho unhappy young Queen in every possible way, eettmg to the whole of their rotmuo the example of impeni- tence towards her, and doing her utmost to induce them all to behave to her with the eame rudeness of which she herself was constantly guilty, lhe fair Sofia, a fine, clever, high «pulled creaiuu, naturally resented the Dowager's ill-treatment, and, unless report sadly belies both ladies, scenes of actual personal violence not unfrequently termi- nated tbe angry recriminations that were of daily occurrenoa at the Quirinal Disgusted with the hideous, ignoble, and stupid mócete r to whom the has been chained, too clear- sighted to hope for any return of her husband's party to lower, harassed and insulted by his step-mother, and bnding herself in a position too miserable and repugnant to be endured sbe left him with the full intention to take the veil rather than return But tho scandal of her retirement was mere than the Legitimists could quietly endure-such, n protest against tbe ex-King would be, It was felt, a tre- mendous blow to their hopes, and a proportionate gain to Victor Emmanuel. And, moreover, the young Queen with her great beauty, her dignity, and goodheartedness, was ccseldered BB being decidedly the best card m their hand, and one which they could by no means dispense with when " the right moment" should come lhis moment thoae i tupid people itally appear, as far as I can learn, to have thought close at band, and consequently every argument, entreaty, end promise was brought to bear on her to return to Rome, to as to be ready to confirm by the tight of her charming faco the ieturn-tide ol loyalty 11 d rejoicing with which the Bourbons were to be re- ceived back Into NapleB by their rebellious subjects. We all remember how much persuasion was brought to I ear on the luckless young creature in the nunnery near Aupsburg, how the old king, her great-uncle, went day after day to tbo nunnery, exhorting and entreating her to len eux co her resolution, and return to Rome " I cannot po back' 1 bave been too unhappy!" was her constant reply But at length, the exiles being so sanguine of their att touching triumphant return, persuaded the Pope himself to interfere, and also promised that the Queen-Dowager should absent herself if the young Queen would return to Rome, so as lo bo ready for the rejoicing journey to Naples. The Pope accordingly wrote to the latter an autograph letter, to urgent that, joined to the promise that she should be freed from contact with the Queen- Dowager, she at length came back But the expected "demonstration," as a matter e f course, esme to nothing, and poor 8ofia, with ber sweet fair face, her lovely blue eyes and her golden hair, se ibednvesout in the morning and evening m her open baroucbo, looks the picture of quiet weariness and despair, fhe has a most engaging face and air, extremely pretty, eien beautiful, it is still her îock ci honesty, and of frankness, her graoe and dignity of bearing, the air of thorough breed- ing, visible in every movement, and the expression of good ness in her face, that makes her so general a favourite. Tho contrast between herself and her hang-dog, vulgar, imbecile husband is painful to see, and whenever, on any fata or pubiio »cession, they appear in public, this contrast is oom* mented on very freely by the crowd. The young ex-Queen is generally seen, out of-doors, with her younger elster, married to the Count di Trani, a very charmine, and pleasing-looking young woman, pretty, dres- sing well, and, apparently, on very affectionate terms with her unfortunate sister They are said to be greatly attached to each other, and almost inseparable now that the odious Dowager has been induoed to take herself off Tbe pereonal habito of the ox-King and of his family are said to be slovenly and dirty beyond the possibility of de- scription to "ears polite." When the Prince of Prussia called on him, during MB recent stay in Rome, and did not seo him, the delay on Bombalino's part, which put tho Crown Prince out of patience (so that be left his card and went away) arose simply from the foot that his ex-Majesty was dining m his usual state of undress and unwoshedness, and could not poesibly bo made ready to receive a royal visitor in any time that such a visitor could be made to wait. The Pope, it will be remembered, installed the fugi- tives in the Quirinal-the summer palace, with charming gardins, in which their Holiness« pass a few weeks every Bummer, and where the Sacred College always meeta to) elect a new Pope, who is then proclaimed to the Romans from ose of ita balconies. Bnt snoh were the reports re- ceived from time to time by the intendants of the papal household of the disorder and dirt with which this beautiful residence was being filled of the dsfts that slept on th* satin conchos, and on the embroidered bed covers, of the patches of grease, end tbo wine-stains, rife on chairs, curtains, and carpeta, lrom one end of the palace to the other, of damage to tht inlaid floors and tables, to statues and mouldings, nay, even to walls and ceilings, that the ex-King's entourage was at length advised to take possession of the Farnese Palace, the private properly of their master. So the Neapolitan« quitted tbe Vatican, leaving; it in such an unspeakable state of filth and damage that, as the Papal JSxohequar cannot just now afford the large outlay that will be required to put the palace in order, it is closed up from all visitors A gentleman in the employment of the Pope, whose duty took him to the Quirinal on the departure of these people, assured a friend of mine in the diplomatic world from whom I havo the statement, that, without having seen the rooms for himself, he could not have be- lieved that any human beings oonld have been so filthy. " If you can imagine the appearance of a palace after being tenanted by lunatic*, or by animals, yon* may form some idea of tbe filth and disorder of thoae splendid suites of rooms , where floors, walls, and furniture, from one end to the other, were in a state more like that of stables or pig »ties, than I can venture to express to you in words " But enough of a subject so odious. Revenons a nos mow Uni j and let us take a glanos at a few of the other palaces and tne villas, in some cases even more splendid than those if the pro ad " Roman Princes," privileged to keep the erand canopy called a ialdacchmo m their ante chamber, and to sport a blue parasol on state occasions, Ihe great palace« of Rome are less imposing, in an architectural point of view, than those of most other Italian cities. 1 heir great extent, and the rich weather-staining of the blocks of travertine of which they are built, give them an ah- of harmonious grandeur that grows on the gazer's fancy, and their great doorways and interior courts, often surrounded with cloisters, and containing orange trees, fountains, and statues, abound in shine and shadow, und happy effects of perspective, that remain pleasantly ia the memory. But their great charm is in their noble oolleo tiorjB of ancient statuary, and the paintings of the great masters of eli the Christian ages. Ihe galleries contain- ing these picture« are more or less ornate ac- cording to the wealth and pude of the various families who possess thom, but, even in the most ornate, the works of art are their true glory. Many of these collections have been centuries in forming, absorbing a large portion of the revenues of their creators. As they are opened for the most part with great liberality, the field thus provided for the art-student is well nigh inexhaustible The owners of these palaces have generally also a villa, just beyond the gates of the city, ia which collections, equally rich, have been formed Í or instance, the Albam, Borghete, Dorio, Painhli, Ludovisi, and other pnncely lamilies, who possess the finest palaces and galleries in Reme, possets villas as splendid and galleries as nob. in tho beautliul outskirts of the Eternal City. In some cases the villaB surpass the palaces in the splendour of their orna- mentation, and boast of halls and suites of magnificent apartments, rich in the rarest marbles, pillars of admirable sue and beauty-spoils of some old Roman building-glid- ing, fieecocB, mouldings, and mosaica The Villa Borgneee, for instance, is a truly regal dwelling, containing, more- over, many of the finest statues in existence, and offering, fiom its loity windows, views of wonderful loveliness oaer the Coinpagna, and the Sabine, Alban, and Tusculan hills. Tho Villa Albam is also extremely rich in woiks of art, and its grounds and gardens, with their long alleys of clipped laurel and privet, their flower-beds forming intricate geometrioal figures, their breezy terraces, dark groves of the grand Roman pine and cypresses, their fountains, grottoes, sta- tuary, and great urns full of brilliant goramums, are be. witchingly lovely under the pure Italian sky The Villa Famfili-Doria is another magnificent country residence, and, for a vender, used as such by its princely owner ; many of the others being kept up, apparently, for tho sole beheof ef the statues, busts, urns, and glorious old oolumns to whose safe and careful lodging they seem to be dedicated. Several of the great families, and others of less fame, being aident " Ituhani," though they do not dare to make much show of their political sympathies, for fear ol "conse- quences," Ita e quietly abroad, thus avoiding actual oantaot of the regime they detest, while abstaining from any overt acts that might give pretext for the confiscation of their estates The servants left in charge of thoae deserted but most lovely retidenccs, neem generally to understand tho absence of their masters , as they Bhow you over the place, your English accent being accepted a» probible evidence of the direction of your sympathies, they will toko an oppor- tunity of furtively asking you " bow tmngs are going ?" and "how locg it will be before the King oom on to Rome ' " " W hat a gloiious Hung it will be when he oomea ' And bow eplendid cur villas and gardens will look when we illu- minate for hie coming ' Ah, my lord and the family won t etay away from this lonely villa when <Aof time oomea ' ' said to me a handsome, black eyed young servant, her faoa lighting up with eager smiles as ehe whispered how glad they would all be to see the "blacks ' go away, and " the King" arrive Some of thcso noble villas boast a casino, or miniature lilla in another part of their grounds, and these casim some- times contain the gem of the art and treasures oollected by thetr owners 1 he two great freecoesof Aurora, perhaps the finest m Rome, are on ceilings of halls in Casini Boa tiglioei nnd Ludovisi The first, by Guido, is the original oi the drawing, with which every one who ever looks at en- gravings osa been familiar from his boyhood, in which the radiant goddess is scattering flowers before the Chariot of Pbcubus, drawn by seven piebald horses , seven exquisitely lovely female figures, typifying the Hours, hovering round the charlot in a sort of dance As it is excessively difhoult and fatiguing to examine this marvellously lovely ceiling, an ingenious arrangement of minore has been contrived, so that y ou can seo the glorious fresco brought before yon as though it were hanging opposite you like on ordinary picture as you tit at your ease in front of the lowest mirror. Ire beauty oi the faces and figures, the grace of the atti- tudes, the ethenal lightness of all the actors in the scene, which teem to float m the golden air with no need of wings to keep them up, the admirable grouping, the harmonious richness, of the colouring, all conspire to render this mar- vellous fresco (bright and perteot as when it was first painted) one of the most magnificent ch'fi d oeuvre extant. 1 be Casino contains several other splendid paintings, but to the finest portion of the Bospigliosi collection the publia, is not admitted The other Aurora, by Gnercmo, on one of the callings of the Casino of the Villa Ludoviei, is only less beautiful than that just described. The central group is but a portion of this great composition, for subsidiary groups, representing Evening, Sleep, Daybreak, and Waking, occupy the lunettes, and are interwoven with the action ol' the centre, in which Aurora, occupying the place of Fhccbus, holds the reins of the fiery steeds that paw the scattering clouds on which her chariot io advancing Flowers drop through the air about the head of the goddess, while Night, a dark and Bbadowy figure, is hasting away out of the path of her radiant pur- suer This great work has, unfortunately, suffered maali from damp and mildew, some portions of it are already sadly discoloured, and bits of the painted surface are peeling off The famous frescoes, by Raphael and his pupils, in tho tur cetina Palace-(not larger than a canna, though called by the moro impeeing name)-are also greatly in- jured by neglect, damp, and unskilful attempts at restora- tion Some of the most famous of the figures are so muan, changed by the unequal fading of the colours and the con lequcat loss of harmony between their component portions as to be no longer pleasing, fortunately, the most beautiful of these compositions, representing Galatea in her shell drawn by dolphins, surrounded by tritons and nymphs, with cnpids sporting in the air, and painted almost en- tirely by Raphael, is in excellent preservation Imagine the effect of these fine Bomen rooms, when walls and ceil- ings were first decorated by the hands of the greatest aniel», every bit of cornice, wainscot, arch, window frame, fire-place, and doorway being covered with the richest ornamentation, arabesques, and reliefs, Etucoo ornemente, marbles, and gliding , with carved and gilded doors, and floors of inlaid porphyries and marbles, forming a noble design as fine, in its way, as the rest of the ornamentation lhere is something BO large, noble, and grandiose about this style of room-decoration that these old walls, even after the fading and neglect of oentu ries have dimmed their lustre and diminished their beauty, are still extremely fine and pleasing After wandering through them, even through the paled and dilapidated Farnesina, one finds all ordinary wall papers, no matter how brilliant and tasteful, exceedingly unsatisfactory Very charming effects are often produced by the aid of fresco-painting, in these old dwellings, even without the transcendant genius of a Guido, Raphael, or a Guerdino. You will often find the smaller rooms of these palaces painted to imitate an arbour, or a bower, with lat- tice work, covered with vines and flowers, running up fat» the ceiling, with birds, butteifites, and perhaps a lizard er two, interspersed amsngthe grapes and flowers, orperhapsi you have landscapes covering the walls, the coding giving the sky, with valions light olouds and birds Suehorna nu station would neither be difficult nor very expensive, and WOUld cnnatifntn .> oro«! ,mnr~.m«i,l nri nar nalial wall-paptrs.
