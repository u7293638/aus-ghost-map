THE DEATH OF MR. CHARLES SOUTER, J.P. A RETROSPECTION. [By Herbert Whitley]. The announcement of the death of Mr. Charles Souter brings back the thoughtâ€”Bless me, what a staunch shadow he was! How his spirit fought! How the energy and will of his mental temperament thrust back the weakness and feebleness of his bodily frame! He was altogether too frail to war with the grosser and more evil natures of those who formed his environment, and, I may add, too up- right and generous hearted to cope with the scoundrelism that left him and his fortune a wreck. I confess he was one of my favourites. I am always impressed with earnestness. Peace to him, then; but haply little peace to those to whom he has gone; for surely if a man's mental temperament may be regarded as a reflex of his soul, then no peace will be sacred from stub- born argument and same prejudices into which the spirit of Charles Souter thrusts itself. I reverently drop a wattle blossom on his grave, and, in conclusion, would add the lines of one of the stanzas of that strangely un- fortunate man, Edgar Allen Poe, as representing my tribute to the worth of one whom I respected in life, and whose memory I revere, cherish and honor in death. "No dirge will I upraise, But waft his spirit on its flight with a peon of old days. Let no bell toll, lest his pure soul, amid its hallowed mirth, Should catch the note as it doth float up from the dammed earth." "To friends above, from friends below, the indignant ghost is ruin. From earth into a high estate, far up within the heaven. From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven."
