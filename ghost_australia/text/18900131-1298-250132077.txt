" l Daylight broke when we were close up to the Black Bange, safe enough, a little off the line but nothing to signify. Then we hit off the trackthat led over the Gap and down into a little flat on & creek thatran e same way as oars did. t Jim had managed for father and Warrigal tp meet as somewhere near here with f<esh horses. There^was an old shepherd'a^hdi that stood by itself almost eoveredjwitii mush-mallows ^nd,nettles.. - Afc Wecame down the steep track a dog came np snuffing and searching aboutjthe grass and stones as if he'd lost something: It was Crib. "Now we're getting home, Jim," says Starlight. " Its quite a treat to see the old scamp again. Well, old man," he uays to the dog,."tow's all-getting on at the Hollow?" The dog came right up to Rainbow and rubbed against bis fetlock, and jumped' np two -or three times to see if be coaldtouch his rider. ' He was almost going to bark, he seemed that glad to see-him and us. .. '.--•'• Dad was sitting on a log by the hut smoking, just the same as he was before:he left us last time. He was holding two 7 fresh horses, and we werenot sorry to see'them.'' Horses are horses, and there wasn't much left in our two.. We must have ridden a goc4 eighty miles that night, Mid it was as bad as .a hundred by daylight. . . Father came a step towards usaswe jumped oft. . By Ceoige, I was that stiff with the long ride and the cold that I nearly fell down. He'd got a bit of a fire, so we j lit oiir pipes and had a comfortable smoke. " Well, Dick, you're back agin, 1 see," he says, pretty pleasant for him. : " Glad to: see you, Captain, once more..
