The Faust Family. THIS clever troupe opened in the Theatre Boyal last night, to a very fair audience. The programme was well introduced by " The Ghost in the Woods," which created a great deal of laughter and applause. The singing and dancing by Master Victor and Little Daisey was also very good. The cornet soloist Herr Von Der Mehden fairly brought down the house, and in response to a hearty encore rendered " The last rose of summer " in a style which merits the high eulogiums which we have read of his talent. "Th√® French clowns" were particularly good in their acrobatic feats, keep- ing up the music on their violins in a clever manner. The White Marble Statuary also was a beautiful exhibition and was enthusiastically applauded. "The musical glasses" was a very novel and appreciable treat, and the Grand Risley perform- ances were such as have .never been seen here before, the skill and ability displayed being excep- tionally good. Martyn Hagan's specialities added to the success of the evening in a marked manner. A good programme concluded with the sketch ' The terrible infants " which like the others was well appreciated by the audience. The City Of Grafton.-The City on her return to Sydney will be laid np for an extensive overhaul, which will take one month to complete. A steamer will he chartered to take her place in the Clarence trade for that period.
