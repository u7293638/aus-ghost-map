Maodonald Meandering. Maodonald, the only Maodonald, he r.f Canada, is fighting up hill ; and so has to resort to all tbe little ways supposed to be fair in love and war. Jnst as ho wants to go to tho oountry for a general eleotion, he makos some wonderful dieooveries about treasonable oonduot on the part of one of bis oolloaguos, and of another person.

It was ucdor nearly similar oiroumstanoes tbat Parkes found a ghost ; it was believed to bo a Fenian ghost, and there fore a moat unpatriotic ghost But us tho ghost nover did appear, nothing mora oamo of it.
