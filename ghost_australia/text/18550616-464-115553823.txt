MR. DENEIHY AND THE "FREE- MAN'S JOURNAL." In a communication signed Z, published in the Freeman's Journal of the 3rd of March, criticising an article in the GOULBURN HERALD, and making certain allusions to a Mr. O'Dinny, it appears that Mr. Deneihy, Solicitor, of Goulburn, considers himself to be both libelled, and vilified in that commu- nication. Now, as we condemn the practice of libelling, or villifyirrg any individual, and as we consider the conductor of a Public Journal bound to make reparation for any injury done to person, property, or character through the columns of a Journal, even if the injury complained of originated through oversight, or inadvertence, we therefore beg to assure Mr. Deneihy, of Goulburn, that we never intended to libel him, or villify his character in any way whatever. For in truth, we never heard or knew of anything calculated to lower him in the eyes of his fellow colonists, and we regret that he felt in any way annoyed or injured by the publica- tion of the communication signed Z. above alluded to. Mr. Deneihy having entered an action for libel against the Proprietor of this Journal, that gentleman thought it better to let a jury decide in the case, as he knew nothing what- ever of the article complained of, and as he did not think that Mr. Deneihy had suffered any injury from the publication of the same. However, as Mr. Deneihy does not seem dis- posed to go on with his action, we now think it but fair to give the above explana- tion, and to make reparation for any imagi- nary injury, that Mr. Deneihy might suppose that lie sustained. Erratum.â€”In our Answers to Corres- pondents a mistake has occurred. In the answer to "The Stone," instead of the words, "St. Elizabeth, inspired by the Holy Ghost," read "the Angel, sent by God."
