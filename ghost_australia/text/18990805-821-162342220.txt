I hastened to assure my host that I had no-desire tojn-y into affairs which might-lie of a delicate or private nature; but that., if he 'chbfce to confide in me, die could rely on my discretion. "I'm quite sure of that," lie replied; "but there is nothing about my 'vacant chaif' that the whole world 'might not hear.

Away I went, Straight cmt. to the 'never-never' country, and took to the road again. But things had changed* since my last droving days, and not for the better. Work was scarce, and wages low; and it was .some time-before I got a .start again. At. last; I gbt a mob of .cattTfe' to, bring to Musvrelibrook, and I , thought toy; hiek' had turned. So it had— ^th^aVyebgcance. 1/ got through fairly well/and^ having delivered ray cattle, Vent oii to Sydney. There, without a moment's warniDg, i met iat«. "One night I tunned in about 11, feeling as well as ever I did in my life. At 4 next morning I woke in agony, and unable to move as much as a finger without exquisite pain. Rheumatic fever, the doctor said, brought on by many wettings on the road, following much hard living. The next six months :I spent in bed, first in. lodgings, thea private hospital; lastly, when funds r#n short, public-hospital, I never think oftfiart time without a shudder. Every lit ; tie pain or ache in my joints brings back jf that six months of torture. When J left 'hospital I was a cripple, couldn't walk—or hobble—twenty yards without siting dowh, -and when I eat down eotiMn't get hp with out assistance. I don't wonder at some | people committing suicide. I know if I had ^remained maeh longer in tbe gtatpm which I was then I'd have found a quick aiM pehort way of release. However,-let that ."pass. . "It, was at this time just when I thought I was forgotten both by God*ahd man, that I met my salvation here. I think she fittpk -pity, op me first Oh account Of my KeT$essnes#,rbut, as for , me, I loved her . front the.,instant my eyes fell- on her. Fropi ithhit,foment I began to mend. I fhad"'sbrnethfn^_to live tpr, to Work" for. 'ifGP* I rfiarmged to scrape, enough'moficy together to carry me round to Western.; Australia, then in middle of. it's 'boom.' In Melbourne I got* wet while' pwalking up to'the Post-office, and inside a ; week was down with pleurisy. For two months I. backed and filled within sight of »the gat leading -to the hereafter. Twice the 'old man' raised his scythe to strike, twice he lowered it again. Skgwly and pain fully I regained sufficient strength to crawl from my bed in the hospital ward; then, in midwinter, too, I was thrust forth penni less, with one lung, and as weak as a child, to starve in the streets. To you, who have never known w/snt, these words Convey no .meaning. You don't understand what it is to be faint forhfek of a crust of bread, to be absolutely without the few coppers necessary to procure a shelter for the night, l,or a cup of coffee at a stall to stay the hor rible gnawing, sinking pangs of-Jiunger. Of course I could have got money by writing to Helen, but I shrank Tram doing that. h-At last, however, I collapsed in the-street, 'and on being carried into a chemist's-shop .was asked if I had any friends with whom *1 wished to communicate. I took that as an intimation that all was up lor me in this ; world, and gave the man her address. In four days she was by my side, and finally r nursed me back to something like mv old 'self." - ! ivnar. was to oe none now: ineaoctors a ssured me that another winter in Md : bourne would finish me, and 1 had, no money, ' no strength to carry me elsewhere. Here ' Helen tame in again, and forced me to ac cept a few pojimasf wherewith to travel to , a. warmer climate. Arrived there I set to 1-work to look for some employment such as was fitted for one in.my weak state of health, and "was.-Fortunate enough to find it almost immediately. The pay was net ; much to boast of—though it was quite ^enough for the work, done—but I managed to exist c,n it for a time. There came a time of which I am ashamed to speak. To my eternal rbarnie £ did a great wrong to my benefactor. fiar ;thi»^I?.feave paid . the .penalty in one way, but T can never forgive myself—no, not if I lived to be- 100. And how do yofj think thegtfcatman revenged himself on ma? Why, hegave me more ■ work to do, saved me, practically.' from starvation or worse, and then put the seal on my gratitude for all~time by enabling me to get the start from which all my present , prosperity has grown. "It was in 'thf.f*",way. My health had been pretty well established, but, try how I would, J could get no remunerative em ployment. The future lbbked blacker than ever, my Helen further a^vay. Year after year passed; I grew more and more desimti dent. 'Hie struggle for a bare living was wearing me down, and turning me grey be fore my time. Then came the release. •'From «•" chance acquaintance I heard of the richness of a certain mining field, ; where a good "living was to be got almost as a certainty,, with the probability : of a big 'rise.' If I ceuld only get there! How was it to be managed, £15 ';at least was required; I couldn't raise [ 15s. Then a thought struck me. Ah, that was a happy thought! Off T went to spy benefactor—the man,L had wronged—and *a«k«f'fifth' to'advance me thebitoney, tell ing him what I wanted it for. yHe. ««r hesitated. He must have known jthe feel "ing in my heart towards him—that-1 would #die or starve rather than wrong him again. He gave £15, and wiihto a week I was im the diggings. " "Ttii? is soon .fold. My luck., was ^phenomenal, and ere a ytar had passe«fc. I Lwae able to pell out at'terms wfrieh made [me independent for life. Then I came for my other self here, and I -think"there has i been no happier eoople m tEe wide world i than the one yon see before you &>w.
