SUNDAY SKETCHES. W Br A Stuandeb. DR. CAMERON LEES. The Scots Church has provided Melbourne I with manyngreenble sensations, but none perhaps of so entirely satisfactory a character as the service of yesterday morning Dr Cameron Lees had arrived It was announced that he would preach T Therefore, though the morning was raw and wintry and uncongenial as Melbourne ever I nowB, though the clouds hung so low that the summit of the tower of Government house was hidden and pine trees looked ghostly a couple of chains away, the people gathered and filled the church before the hour of eleven and waited expectant, while many for whom no room could be found looked in at the doors, and went sadly away The interior was cold and grey The morning was so very grey that the means of lighting seemed quite insufficient All the beautifully carved white stone of the pulpit and chancel appeared dingy as the sadly besmirched e tenor The colours in the stained windows were muddy, and when the preacher entered the pulpit it was impossible from half way down the aisle to say what manner of man he was. Only a "". and somewhat stately figure was visible But there was no difficulty whatever about the voice Rich, sonorous with a nasal m chnation, giving distinctness without often giveness, it filled the church, and reached every ear The hymn given out was appropriate to any occasion - the 'Sanctum of all the Christian churches the Holy 1 Holy ! Holy I which in period of un- questionable inspiration Bishop Heber give to the world. The choir sang it very last, so fast that the in- merciful was Ire quently ended and the congregation were a couple of words (I do not know how many bars) behm 1 As is usual play cr followed the hymn, and in the prayer the power of the new minister was clearly felt and his manner fully understood impressive, earnest, devo tional, orderly, his petitions moved in as reasonable and almost as free a style as the orders of the Anglican Tray or book but of cation, confession, supplication for remission third saving very brief is very full It was followed by the chanting two ' prose ps teams chosen from the beginning of that finale of jubilant think sir in wherewith the poet King closed his book The choir sung them, the congregation joining feebly Then the Scripture n adun,s-thefirst from the book of Isaac, the second from the ïïlBtRevelu tions- the surprises another hymn, further prayer, and the sermon The second prayer was somewhat remarkable for its close resemblance to the Anglican Litany It be bought blessings for all orders of magnitude from the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and all her dependencies downwards, for all who travel and all who Buller, cape early for those who are sick and vi he may now be in our minds (a slight pause following this petition singularly happy and devo- tion limits effect) It was c_tc_ipore,of course, but singularly illustrative of the necessary similarity of nil orderly and cultured express series of prayer, whether the result of one man is trained and consistent effort, or of the commission of many devotional minds. there was no attentiveness and solemnity very rarely witnessed in Presbyterian churches during these prayers, and when the text of the sermon was announced in expectancy of life which betokened not desire only, but ju lgment And just then it was interesting to look across the whole con- gregation, and to look at the preacher and to briefly consider all the sun had pierced the mist by that time, the painted windows were all aglow, the grey and almost bald head of the preacher was conspicuously illuminated the keen but kindly eyes could be seen, the well cut features, the beardmore mixed with grey than portraits had led us to expect And the congregation ' V linger gathering of really earnest Scotchmen, strong Presby for me, had never been assembled in the church or the city before there were the tall grey headed, red faced, prosperous men who stand universally, it unrtMsonably, by the things wherein they were bred, the thin lippe I, narrow eyed, bushy eyebrows ancients who would debate with St Peter us to the proper method of au noiinciugndeceased Macpherson, the tall and stately men, with a look at the Black Douglas about them, the smooth shaven Imlliobodies and the thousand nondescripts found amongst Scotchmen as all other nationalities And, as has been stated, they were all very eager It had been hoped and expected by many present that the sermon would be preached on some portion of the 1st chapter of Revs buttons, which had been read during the service, wherein the original and parent conception of all the celestial cities seemed to offer a fine and appropriate theme for such a preacher as we find anticipated in Dr Cameron Lees. Ivor were three hopes or expectations misleading , but what could or would be done with the portion chosen was doubtless a momentary public in many minds "the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal ' It seemed to belong to 1 used as much as to St John the Divine But information and satisfaction came very quickly The inspiration of St John was traced through several subsequent authors . the expansions and definitions of the glories and 6 natives of the celestial city were brought out in vivid and poetic fashion by quotations from St. Augustine and Bernard of CluL,_y,and then, said the preacher, I have chosen a description which seemed to me to admit of practical application He would direct our attention to the beauty of proportion it was easy to divide the subject length, and breadth and height; firstly, secondly, and lastly, plainly as could be desired And in the du 1310 there was much hope, for the celestial city was the symbol of the church, and the preacher must needs say how long and broad and high the church should be He did so say with a clearness and fulness and emphasis that left nothing to be desire! 1 so little he would describe as the zeal the energy of the church-the active vigour which sent its sound out into all lands and its word unto the ends of the earth It was the neuve working spirit without which any church must die There could not be too much length but length without breadth is no unlovely thing The breadth must be as the length and breadth he would de Berri e as charity Dr Cameron Lees had only one standard for his ideal church and really he seemed to think far more of the idea! church to be than of the until uni church which had been-ho woul 1 claim brotherhood With all who named the name of Jesus, and sought to increase I could £3 in the world 1 he was conscious that this had not been the way in times past it had not been the way with their national church. The fervour the c ii of Scotchmen had almost passed into a proverb but in their church they had had too many prosecutions and persecutions and castings out of my nogues, strong language calling of names ex-communist tions Was the rev and very eloquent doctor really thinking of the old country as he spoke ' Ills ivor III seemed to describe exactly the view taken in some quarters not of the past A)0 j ears of Scottish history but of the past four or Two of the history of the Melbourne Scots Church by ct it is not probable that the preacher had any local differences In man 1, he quoted a pathetic and familiar instance to illustrate the folly and the loss caused, by divisions in churches It was that of poor Joe in Join All Alone Alloy - ' Gen linen don't often come here, but if they do they till mostly sol no other ones 1 rayed wrong ' He defined his now is position as to be idle by quoting the noble words of Dr. -«orninii M 1 got who would be broad as the charity of Almighty God an 1 narrow as the everlasting righteousness dividing as a sharp Bivorl between the right and the we ron; Only the Intitudlnnrliimsmot the life and the church without Christ was to be deprecate 1 And the height-Mas there any hope there for those who had been waiting for a word of condemnation of heretics and back spiders Not the faintest atom that, colour The height of the celestial! city is Its spirituality Length of energy, zeal activity, breadth of charity of brotherly love are of no at all without spirituality The man who speaks with power is he who appears to have Christ for ever at his elbow, he who is in communion with the realities of the higher world Christianity makes the great missionary, and one of the great mistakes of missionary work has been the espousing of the calling by men who lacked the true spiritual vocation St Paul, Xavier, Livingstone were the spiritual missionaries They cared not for estates, or houses, or church properties, they did not seek to become premiers of fertile islands, or come firming to Government about trespass on their grounds Dr Cameron Lees did not say all that, he halted with naming the spiritual missionaries, many more than the three mentioned (and more than one of them Roman Catholics), then briefly recapitulated or summarised his previous definitions and explanations His church, or rather his ideal, would be zealous and vital as the best energy of man could make it, broad as the love of God on which it was founded, high as man could aspire to wards absolute communion with the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost The sermon proper closed then, and a nobler and more thoroughly Christian deliverance has never been heard since the Scots Church pulpit was completed There was a lapse of interest though an increase of attention, perhaps when the preacher descended to a few words of purely local and personal interest He would no knowledge the honour done to him by the elders of the church and the presbytery in offering him the pulpit of the Scots Church He had heard that they had recently gone through troublous times Of them he did not propose to speak then or at any other time he would hope for better days. He might say that there was in Scotland a great interest in the Scots Church, and that he line i if find a special personal interest, the Rev Peter Menzies having been one of his oldest friends He should occupy the pulpit but four months, and during that time he should be glad to perform all a pastor's duties, and in future, on Sunday mornings, he should be glad to meet the young people of the church in a Bible class after Sermon Then an other, very well sung and very operatic 111 style, collection and Benediction, kind criticism
