THE JULY PERIODICALS No. II. Mr. Gladstone continues, in the Contemporary, his speculations as to the place of Homer in history, and adduces a number of ingenious arguments to show that the hardy character of the Greek people was formed in the continuing stress of danger and difficulty, and that their early life was chiefly spent " in the use of the strong hand against the foreigner." Dr. Carpenter's fantastic theory of unconscious celebration " is cleverly picked to pieces by Mr. R. H. Hutton, who observes that "to ask us to believe that one and the same person can have, at one and the same moment, nervous arrangements for recalling accurately by the mediation of his muscles, yet without any act of memory, how a thing really happened, while he is making by an act of recollection an erroneous statement on the same subject through his consciousness and his voice, is, I think, to ask us to believe a much more improbable explanation in order to avoid a less improbable one." In fact, to assume that the brain can exercise any functions in- dependently of the animating mind is equivalent to assuming that a fantasia could be performed upon the pianoforte without the intervention of human fingers. It is something more than what Mr. Hutton calls "a startling hypothesis," it is an egregious absurdity to suppose that you ever attain to a distinct conclusion without any conscious consideration of the conditions, that you ever 'celebrate' a sum without mathematical process, or that you ever attest arti- culately a fact which at that very moment you have quite forgotten." Mr. Brassey contributes a very interesting paper on co- operative production, from which we learn that the number of societies established on this principle in England and Wales is 746, with 300.5S7 members, that their share capital is £2,784,000, that £10,17G,000 was dis [ bursed and £11,379,000 was received for goods in 1872 ; while the disposable net profit amounted to £807,748. An analysis of the phases of thought which Strauss passed through during his lifetime, by Mr. Appleton, is faithfully executed; and the unpopularity of the German theologian is thus explained : "He has been the 'evil conscience,' 'true candid friend,' of a time of transition. He has spoken when men would willingly have kept silence. He has divided what successive schools have laboured to unite. He has ripped up every compromise ; he has probed remorselessly every wound and has exhibited all the nakedness and deformity of the Christian spirit during a period of decay." Mr. A. T. Innes, in an article on Ultramontanism and the Free Kirk of Scotland, in reply to Archbishop Manning, sets forth what he believes to be the via media between the former and Ctcsarism. This is the theory of a free church in a free state which was reduced to logical form by Puri- tanism in England and Scotland ; which he describes as a massive and noble theory, disfigured though it then was by the intoler- ance of the age, and of the law, and of the men who believed it." Mr. Innes, however, overlooks the fact that this beautiful theory was perfectly compatible with the practice of an ecclesiastical tyranny which was quite as oppressive as the worst of political tyrannies and this intolerant spirit is just as active as ever, though not so potent as formerly. In an essay on Petrarch, Mr. A H. Simpson endeavours to show that he was something more than a match- famous sonnetteer, and that he was a high Bouled patriot and a devoted apostle and martyr of literature. Discoursing of church parties, Dr. Littledale argues that only one of the four sections into which the Church of England is split up possesses any true vitality, and this is that which makes a " religious use of painting, sculpture, music, flowers, incense, rich v vestments, and all the rest of what is popularly called ritualism ' ' Father Dalgairns furnishes a metaphysical disquisition on the personality of God, full of adjectives beginning with capital letters, and of myStical theology clothed in incomprehen- sible language Mr Froude appears inclined to adopt the philosophy of Despair, for in an article on party politics, in Fraser, he takes a very desponding view of the end towards which England seems to be moving She is gliding into a democracy, and under democracies, ' he observes "noble avenues to distinction are closed Equality is too jealous to allow differences of rank and power Differences of wealth remain The pursuit of wealth becomes then the predominant passion, de grades the national character, raises to eminence the least worthy of elevation, j corrupts those who obtain it by luxury, stimulates a false and unworthy am bition in those who aspire to it and having inverted society, lifts to the top the vulgar and the commonplace, and things the worth and intellect into the dust heap" A lively account of Fiji, by a recent resident, will not be highly relished by some of the residents in Levuka, and least of all by Mr Burt and his old colleagues of the Europeans generally, the writer says that they "have committed atrocities equalling in enormity anything which can be adduced against the cannibals ' He likewise assures the readers of Fraser that white men in the South Pacific Ocean open) bay to strangers in such regions that killing niggers is quite as good sport as shooting partridges in England '" The Rev G D Haughton applies himself to the dis- section of Strauss's views with respect to religion, poetry, and music, with the object of showing that the genesis of neither is to be traced to the gradual unfolding and expansion of physical powers, and that a symphony by Beethoven, or a drama by Shakspeare, is an emanation from the highest sphere of the human mind, " that which gives a finer) and seraphic insight into things, and fixes its conceptions on forms more durable than the mountains or the rocks all which is very pretty, but slightly vague and unreliable An interesting account is given in a paper entitled " Puddlers and Iron Smelters,' of the way in which an illiterate shepherd be) taught the founders of the famous Baptist Mills, in Bristol how to cast iron, and how the method continued to be practised for upwards of a hundred years at Colebrooke dale M Camille Bamre contributes a sketch of the masons of La Crosse consisting of about 40 000 artisans who are continually passing to and from the French capital, but who are entirely and Partisan in aspirations and appearance They leave their native department in the spring, travel on foot to Paris, where they constitute one great and mutually helpful family, work hard, live frugally, un- make their way back again in the autumn At home they become landowners, but are wedded to traditional and unprogressive systems of agriculture A dull paper on liberal Protestantism, and a clever satire on popular taste in art and literature, entitled "A Professor Extraordinary," and a proposi- tion for the redistribution of seats in Ireland, div cases) the contents of Fraser, if they do nothing more Besides its two serial stones and a review of one of the publishers' new books-Major Brackenbury s " Narrative of the Ashanti War"-Blachcoodcontains only two articles and a poem One of the former is entitled "Family Jewels," a title as misleading as Miss Edgeworth's essay on Irish bulls, or Ruskin's treatise on sheep-folds These jewels are not the precious stones which are handed do we as heirlooms from generation to general tion in patrician houses, but certain scenes, characters, and similes, which have now become the common property of poets. There are traced from Greece to Italy, and from Italy to England, and an affiliation established between Homer, Virgil, Dante, Ariosto, Tasso, j I Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton An admirable article), headed Two Cities-Two Books," deals descriptively with Florence and Venice, I and critically with the Romola of " George Eliot' and the Consuelo of " George Sand.'' Both those Italian cities are brilliantly pictured, and as -specimens of word painting, the descriptions are not unworthy of Ruskin or of Gautier How vivid is the following photograph of the Church of San Giovanni innocence "Standing at the door on a sunny summer morning long "ago, what thoughts gleamed across one s mmd The vast great walls rising up dimly in that two light coolness which is so grateful in a warm country-the vast roof tipenng jet further up, with one cold, pale star of light in the centre, a few figures dwarfed by its great ness, standing hite ghosts about the pavement below one or two kneeling in the deep stillness while outside all was light and sound in the Piazza and through the opposite doors a white span of sunny pavement appeared dazzling and blazing" Brighter in colour, and equally true in drawing is the picture of the Sea Cybele, as seen from the gondola which conveys you from the railway station to Daniells - ' Vv hen, out of a maze of narrow water James you shoot into the breadth and give nous moonlight of the Grand Canal, and see the lagoon go widening out, a plain of dazzling silver, into the distance and great churches and palaces standing up pale against the light, our Lady of Salvation and St George, the greater guarding the widen- ing channel, what words can the wondering stranger use to describe the novel, beautiful scene ' On this side, half in gloom, of gloom can be amidst all these reflections, more minute and varied of artificial light, lie the palace and the cathedral, which are the centre of all, the great Campanile, the winged lion on his column, the gay moving crowds, and bright windows, and pleasant groups in the brightest of public squares." The Comte de Paris, who it will be remembered served as aide de camp to General MacLean, contributes to the_?e«i<e_e«_)íiíx Monday some fragments of a forthcoming history of the civil war in America, the appearance of which is anticipated with some degree of interest in France, as it is supposed that the heir of Louis Philippe will avail himself of the opportunity of indulging in some indirect reflections in it on the current history of his own country. Of course the count is an ardent partisan of the north, and looks upon slavery as the only cause of the war Russian literature appears to be engaging increased attention in France, and M Rambaud undertakes to familiarise the readers of the Revue with the poems and songs which celebrate the heroic exploits of Prince Vladimir, who married a daughter of our Saxon Harold, and who appears to have been a sovereign as much in advance of the age as was Alfred the Great Mr Aldrich s story of Prudence Palfrey ' has received the honour of being translated into French and looks very well in its Gallic garb, although such names as Twomblj and Todhunter must be rather trying to Parisian months An analysis, by M Bo sister, of Mommsen's erudite and ponderous work upon the antiquities of the Oriental provinces of the Roman Empire will serve to give the general reader a very fair idea of what appears to be a monument of laborious research among the in- scriptions which throw a light on the past history of the outlying dependencies of that power The reviewer deduces from the work a moral which he probably intended to apply to an empire and to events of much more recent date " In causing its peoples to lose the habit of liberty by the seduction of material wellbeing," he observes, ' Rome not less broke down their moral energy, and left them powerless to resist the barbarians M Reville has undertaken to epitomise the history of the Dutch war in Atchin , though one is rather surprised to find the reverend theologian in this particular "galley" He states that the result of the double campaign has been to place the whole of the island of Sumatra under the dominion of the Netherlands, and he seems to anticipate that Borneo is bound to fall into the hands of the same power, to be followed by the annexation of all the smaller islands surrounding Java. " If," he observes, " the altered circumstances of the times no longer permit of Holland playing in Europe the important rule which it sustained in the 16th and 17th centuries, it may find some compensation in the honourable post which it occupies as the advance guard of cessation in the rot At the price of great sacrifices it has succeeded in suppressing one of the principal hotbeds of barbarism which are still existing in the modern world The commerce of the entire globe will profit by its victor), and small nations have a double merit when they accomplish great deeds Captain Aube dis- cusses the future of the French navy in an article designed to show that this must be reconstituted after the example of the English navy which, he says " is equal in effect by e power to that of all the nations which may one day coalesce against her." What Trance needs at the present juncture, he considers, is a Richelieu with a hand of iron, and a Colbert with a soul of marble, at the same time he is afraid that if either of these should be forthcoming-of which there is no sign his powerful wall would be broken to pieces by coming in contact with that of the ignorant majority, the true sovereign Some curious particulars are given with respect to some of the inmates of the Bastille in an article founded on its archives, the first in stalment of which has just been published in six volumes These records extend from 1659 to 1789, and as the compiler has only got down to 1931, the work promises to be a pretty voluminous one The account given of the crimes committed by a female prisoner named La Version, and of the abortions procured by) a nurse, named Lepers, who burnt 2 OOO of the workers in order to compose magical powders out of their ashes, almost transcends belief
