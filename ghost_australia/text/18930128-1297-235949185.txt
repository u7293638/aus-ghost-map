Jler maUer, Hawthorno, was washed overboard mul drownctl. The chief oflicor, Air. Percy, who has navigated the vessel to Quoenstown nin"eo tho loss of the captain, says the cyclone was the worst he hud ever encountered, it burst on tho ship on August 12, 17 days alter sailing from San Francisco. The wind was blowing from tho uorlh-wost, and immediately afterwards the sea ran mountains high fmm the south-west. The vessel broached toon the starboard tack, uud was thrown completely over nn her beam end. Volumes of water rushed down below. The cabin and forecastle bueamo Hooded and wore gutted. A heavy sea dashed against the port- lifeboat and wrecked it, while tho force of the wind tore the sails to atoms. One wave caught tlio ca'.tain and carried him overboard. Fortunately tlm cyclone spent it-self and the ship was gut upright, subsequently, when olf the Jlom, nuother eyeiaue struck llmm, but they escaped damage, getting only the steering gear strained.

It was in 47deg. 30min. south and 4deg. west that tbo vessel succeeded in clearing these berg. During the threo days she was amongst the ice it was a liiost trying nnd anxious time for nil on board, but thanks to tho good seamanship of GaptainJaiuo the vessel wo brought through in safety.
