FRIDAY, APRIL 26, 1895. Few addresses with more force and more matter have been delivered to the Chamber of Commerce than that of the retiring president. The great issues of the day are dealt with in turn, and Mr. HUGH R. REID can be eloquent as well as practical. The burning questions of the hour are so numerous that in deal- ing with such an address the reviewer is embarrassed by his riches. The opening statement of the retiring president is a reproach, and it is one that can be emphatically endorsed. The chamber is not supported as it ought to be. The example before the com- mercial community is, as Mr. REID says, that set by the labour party, which knows how necessary it is that it should organise, and that it should return members to deal with the busi- ness matters that are more and more coming before the Legislature. The "acute distress" which exists in the community has challenged the atten- tion of successive presidents for some years past, and we can only hope that Mr. REID'S successor will be happy in being able to avoid the topic. Mr. REID has to face it. Some years back we pointed out in The Argus how the inflation of the revenue and the consequent profligate expenditure in the Govern- ment departments was as much due to our unfortunate tariff as to our exces- sive borrowing, and as much due to our excessive borrowing as to our high and widespread tariff. The short history of the unhappy episode is that our gigantic loans all came to us in goods, and these goods paid heavy toll to the Treasurer. Mr. REID gives the follow- ing table of the excess of imports for the five years ending 31st December, 1890:— Excess of Imports. Victoria ... ... ... £45,880, 000 New South Wales ... £6,691,000 Tasmania .. ... ... £1,410,000 Western Australia ... £720,000 Queensland, South Australia, and New Zealand were the other way about. Now, this £45,000,000 was subject to an average charge of 3s in the £1 at the Customs, or, in other words, our revenue was swollen to the extent of about £7,000 000 over and above receipts from legitimate sources. Hence the inflation of the revenue and the increase of the outlay of the state, though now that that the gigantic expendi- ture has to be cut down the loan- mongers and the High Tariff men are ready to abusively attribute the ex- travagance to any and every one but themselves. No policy could be more disastrous and more demoralising to a community than the one persisted in here for many years of flooding the country with commodities by means of loans, and of endeavouring to keep back commodities by means of a heavy tariff. 1 lie fall in priées nnd the causo of that staitling phenomenon are duly noticed Mi Kim ' cannot tim k that 1 a bimetallic ttuudaid is tho mlalliblo " cine foi uiipiolitnblo puces It is ad " nutted that tho moduction of gold svas " gioatoi lost )eai than lins over boon " know, n since oflicud records woro kept, " that Soutli Afncn, which in 188G raised " gold to tho \aluo of -670,000 only, in " ci cased thooutputlastycai toupwardsof "2 000,00007, wortltabout£7,000,000," while tho Unilod States and the Aus tralian colonies both mcietsed tlton out put His "own opinion is that the " lowoungofpiicGsistonlargeo\tcntduo "to the lmmonso improvements which " have taken place in the modes of pro " duction and in tho exchanges of com " meice " L\ ery now discovory in prac tical scienco, Mi lil ID thinks, has enoimously cheapened tho cost of production, and tho miprovod stoam communication of the day has re duiod by tluce fourths tho chareo for tatnspoiting pioduço, Tho lotirmg president concludes this poition of Ins remarks with tho following adiuia tion -"Instead of usolessly bewailing "the 'hard times,' let it bo ours to " apply the remedy that lies within our " reach , let the commeicial and foi m " mg inteiests combine (and togothor "they foi m a citar majoiity of the " olootors) and sweep away every " obstacle that tho hand of man has " wickedly placed m thu way of m " creasing the pioductiveness of the " soil Evoiy tax, ovory chai go that " prevents tho pastoralist, the larmer, "the winogrowoi, and tho rmnci " fiom sending tho products of then " varied industries into tho numorous " markets of the ivoild must bo io " moved " ho may it be " Iligh fj eights, high interest, and " high tariffs " aro given " without " hesitation " by Ali IÎEID as the greotest obstacles to tho progress of the colony They all hang together Tho high tariff moans pooi returns from tho land, and poor security implies heavy intoicst 'I ho samo cause restricts trado both wa) % and a restricted ocean trade means heavy charges As the i ule works backwards, a low tariff carrios with it low intorest and low freights Where aro freights and interest lower than in Great Butain ?

Mr John Buckley began his career in mercantile life in the service of the Bank of Victoria, and took a position in the office of Messrs Dalgety and Co in 1857, becoming a partner two years later. In 1861 he left Australia and went to England, where he passed through the law course and was admitted to practice as a barrister. Not satisfied, however, with the career of a counsel, he betook himself to journalism, and in the capacity of a special correspondent travelled not only through the continent of Europe, but also to Mexico and even to Cash- mere where he had an interview with the Khan. After an adventurous life, in which he visited nearly every quarter of the globe, he returned to Victoria in 1880 and re- entered commercial life, becoming general manager of the British and Australasian Trust and Loan Company, a position which he held to the last. The funeral took place yesterday, and was attended by many who had learned to esteem the deceased gentle- man, not only for his business ability, but also for his genial disposition and kindly qualities.
