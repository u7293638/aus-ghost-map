"Mountain Dew.'' WE have received a copy of "Mountain Echoes," by J. G., M.L.A. The anonymity is too thin; we readily recognise the style of our "Own Jack." "Twingy Ringy, mount of beauty, How I envy you your duty, Watching o'er her peaceful slumbers, Like Gardiner o'er his spring cucumbers." This can leave no doubt in our mind that Our Jack has been taking a holiday, and the mountain dew has inspired him. Welcome and Substantial Shade, No matter how nervous an actor may be, he likes to see a "ghost walk" once a week.
