' Twilight Song. ? Dewoy' twilight I silent hour I . Welcome to our oottago bower I Soo, along the lonely meadow, Ghost-like, falls the lenglihen'd shadow, ? While the sun, with level shine, ', : Turns the stream to rosy wine } And from yonder busy town ' Homeward hies tho la/,v down, Hark I along the dewy ground ( Steals the sheep-bells rlroM'sy sound i While tho ploughman, late returning, Sees his cheerful fagot burning, And, his dame, with kindly smile, ; - Moots him by tho rustio stile j While beneath tho hawthorn mute tSWolls the peasant's merry flute; Lass, from market homeward speed j Traveller, itrgo thy lagging steed Fly tho dark wood's lurking clangor } Churl, receive tho 'nlghtod strangerâ€” Ho with merry song and jest Will repay thy niggard feast, And tho eye of Heaven above . Smile upon the deed of love. Hour of beauty I hour of peace I , Hour when oaro and labour ooaso j When around hor hush'fi dominion Nature spreads her brooding pinion, Whilo a thousand angel oyos Wako to watch us from the shies, Till tho reason centres thoro, And tho hoart is moved to prayer, GlflUAIiD GlMMN.
