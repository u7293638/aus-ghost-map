POETRY. THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the thing yon do, dear. If e the thing yon leave undone Which givesyon a bit of heartache At the Betting of the eon; The tender word forgotten. The letter yon did not write, The flower yon might hare sent, dear, Axe your hanntmg ghosts to-night. The atone yon might hare lifted Out of the brother's way. The bit of hearthstone counsel Ton were hurried too much to say; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That yon had no time or thought for, With troubles enough ol your own. The little acts of kindness So easily out of mind. These chances to be angels Which even mortals find— They come in night and silence, Bach child reproachful wraith. When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith, For life la all too short, dear. And sorrow is all too groat, To suffer on slow compassion That tarries until too lato. And It's not the thing yon do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun. MABQARBT ■. BAHOSTBE.
