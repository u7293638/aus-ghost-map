I THE NOVEMBER MAGAZINES. j No. IL Two aerial works of fiction, the one by Mr Henry James jun , the American novelist and the other by Mrs Oliphant, and a car on a ghost story from Ceylon, by Mrs E H Edwards, make up considerably more than half the contents of the current number of Macmillan Of the two other papers that which should excite most attention is from the pen of Professor Seeley and is entitled I political Somnambulism In it head duces many good reasons for asserting or assuming that nations are liable to an in firmity resembling that to which the sleep wall or is subject and that at such times they may be seen rushing along blindly, with out the power of seeing the objects with which they may come into dangerous collision Democratic states he says are especially exposed to this enormity and the end of such a condition is greatest where a democracy is Gourgaud Bantume asir England The franchise has been widely extended without its recipients having been prepared by education to make a judicious use of it and be points out that the suffrage itself is no education whatever but that conferred on those who are entirely untutored it can do nothing but develope and (give substance to error and misconception The masses have not the le sure to Almroth necessary information or a just way of thinking g and flattered as they are sure to be by those who hope to mount over the r shoulders into power the very last thing the people are likely to learn is to distrust their own instincts and to suspect the em. ty rhetoric of the plan Bible demagogue According-, to 1 Professor Seeley it is impossible even to conceive the great mass of the working classes educated to the point of having a sound judgment on questions of national policy and the great danger of the future lies he thinks in the sanguine extravagance of opinion natural to a class which has" no intellectual experience It is the function of science to correct such errors and he is of opinion that this illicit be done in the universities were to set themselves to draw from history and to popularise information about the experiments that have been tried in politics and the degree of success that has attended them with a view to prove to the great body of the people and politics are i dill cult an anxious art an art in which disaster is the normal result of declamation party violence and romantic history Is it not a fact however that for nations as for individuals experience is the only schoolmaster' Yi as there a P Frisian Communist ii 18 who was ignorant of the events of 1789 JP and of the disasters they entailed on Prince and did it restrain him or her from acting like a maniac' in the International Review Professor G L Andrews returns to the subject of the alleged outrage on YA Whittaker the coloured cadet at \A est Point and after carefully investigating all the circumstances of the case and analysing the evidence arrives at the conclusion that Whittakers account of the affair was false and that he perjured hu itself under the influence of a peculiar morbid condition of mind The recent action of the French Government towards the Jesuits is reviewed by M E de Pressensc who looks upon the conflict as having been rendered inevitable and who asserts that it was undoubtedly brought on by the imprudence of the Ultramontane party At the same time he thinks the contest might have been carried on more usefully in other ways than by the application of ancient laws against religious congregations Of the effi each of the decrees of the 20th of March 1890 M de Pressensc entertains very grave doubts The Jesuits will return he says under other names and will disguise their ideas just as skilfully as they will disguise themselves and moreover it is of no use striking at the Society of Jesus while it virtually controls the Roman Catholic Church At present in its warfare against the Jesuits the state seems to symbolise irreligion if not atheism and adds this writer 'if it does not wish to be conquered by its dangerous rivals, it is very necessary to avoid giving an irreligious cha racter to the secular instruction of its estab- lishments. Respect for religious creeds is its first duty If it does not teach them itself it should in all cases facilitate the instruction of them by opening wide the door to all ministers of worship conformablely to the wish of parents If the state in opposition to the church professed a kind of civil irre ligion it would not only fail in its mission which is to be the protector of all liberty but it would raise a dangerous reaction against itself Let it not be forgotten that a people will always end by preferring any religion whatever to an absolute want of creeds An atheistic Government would answer marvel lously well for the purpose of the Jesuits and the Capuchins Mr T C Felton com municatcB an interesting account of the Muses 1 residing gen-or Pattern Perform ance which took place last summer at Munich when about twenty of the best actors and actresses in Germany and Austria were got together by Herr Possart the present manager of the Royal Theatre in the Bavarian capital and played four of Shakspeare three of Goethe's two of ScLillcra and three of Less is dramas and two or three others Most of them seem to have been magnificently mounted but those which were purely German met with the greatest since Pa It seems however that measured by these performances the supply of German tragic actors of the highest order is at a low ebb With the exception of Seebach who is now past her prime v rites Mr L e ton and rarely comes before the public there is no artist to compare with Janauschek a woman of great genius who is said by those who know her to be BE variously accomplished off the stage as she is famous on the boards A strong case is made out by Mr C S Baker man article on the State and the railroads in favour of taking the railroads of the United States out of private hands and vesting their administration in a board of commissioners as otherwise the time will come when there will exist within the state a creature of the State mightier than the State itself As it is the power wielded by some of the magnates who control the main arteries of traffic is enormous while the land grants they have received cover areas of territory as large as some European kingdoms It seems there are no less than 80 000 miles of railway in operation in the United States representing a capital clad ing stock that has been watered of no less than 5 000 millions of dollars An needs tical paper upon Boston lawyers in the old days will be found to possess very little in terest for other than American readers A curious chapter on the financial history of the United States is written by Mr R P Porter in the article entitled ' State Debts and Repudiation The former amount at the present time to £50,000 000 sterling in round numbers but as large a sun as £32 000 000 sterling has been declared invalid and repudiated by the Southern States Ken tucky having been the only one which has kept faith with the public creditor They were over run with carpet-baggers from the north who established a reign of corruption and profligate expenditure raised loans and pocketed the proceeds and left the exasperated inhabitants the choice of two alternatives either to impose ruinously heavy taxes to meet engagements thus shamefully contracted on their behalf or to disavow the obligation They adopted the latter course under the influence of feelings of strong resentment and writes Mr Porter " the south is to day suffering and will for generations to come suffer for the folly of those who were lured from duty and honesty by party passion and false theories Mr Herbert Spencer contributes to the Fortnightly Review the introductory portion of a philosophical work upon political inst nations as viewed in the light of the doctrine of evolution The following passage may be quoted as containing what appears to as to be the key-note of his assay, "We must recognise truth that the struggle for existence between societies has been instrumental to their evolution Neither the consolidation and recomendation of small social groups into large ones, nor the organisation of such compound and doubly compound groups, nor the concomitant developments of all those aids to a wider and higher life which civilisation has brought would have been possible without a terrible and international conflicts Social co- operation is initiated by joint offence and defence, and from the co-operation thus in lasted all kinds of co operations have arisen inconceivable as have been the horrors caused by this universal antagonism, which beginning with the chronic hostilities of small bordes tens of thousands of years ago, has ended in the occasional vast battles of immense nations, we must nevertheless admit that without them the world would still have been inhabited only by men of feeble types, sheltering in caves and living on wild food If J[> Stillman a estimate of the character of the modern Hellenes, as set forth man article entitled "Greece and the Greeks be correct, the) are a much maligned people He contends that they are actually in advance of the Greeks of old he asserts that they have 'high sexual morality), the closest of farm!) ties,

people, excellent business faculties, civic orderliness in a high degree, and intense conservation au fond the) are "the best people in the Levant, with the worst Government in Christendom, because their political institutions are also gether unsuitable to them What has taken place there is exactly like what would happen here, if we had only one representative body and a Black Wednesday with every change of Ministry, for as Mr, Stillman tells us, "the single Chamber elected by universal suffrage is divided into as man) cliques as there happen to be men capable of forming partisans by their talents or personal influence Each of these chiefs, little or great, aspires to be a Munster pos sibly a Prime Munster-and the whole struggle in Parliament is to form combinations which shall resist spontaneous disintegration A chief in the Opposition, victorious to do) not finding his ambition satisfied in the new Ministry, goes into the new Opposition the changes are kaleidoscopic As to the civil service, it is a caricature of that of the United States, and the evils resulting from it are these corruption, extravagance and inefficiency A horde of place holders with a brief and precarious tenure of their appointments make all the stolen hay the) can while the sun shines "Except the Turkish says Mr Stillman of doubt if there is in Europe a custom house service so corrupt as the Creek when I say that the American is in very much the same condition, I shall not be accused of partiality or prejudice As to the one horse legislature of the country, it is composed of little better than local delegates, who are very much under the thumb of the wire pullers in the various constituencies, and unfortu- nately it is not only with the ignorant that the wildest and most irrational notions of politics obtain, but more or less with the whole people For this really desperate state of things Mr Stillman, who is ardently philbelleniBt asserts there is but one remedy -decentralisation, a radical change of the constitution to one on the Swiss plan, with the fullest administrative liberty to the com- mine and the removal, as far as possible of the central administration and the civil service from the vicissitudes of an ignorant universal suffrage or unreasonable changes It is an American, let us add who writes that Any contribution of well authenticated facts to the discussion of the Irish land question is especially acceptable just now, and Mr M 0 Brien's narrative of certain experiments in connexion with peasant nrornotorshii, throwing out of the sales to tenants under the Church and Land acts, is sure to be read with interest by those who believe that judicious legislation and not the coward) assasainatioiiadnnredb) Mr Longmore 13 the true remedy for the genuine grievances of Ireland The number of small pro- prietors created by the measures just referred to appears to be about 5 000 Each lessee or tenant of the glebe land was entitled to a preemptive right of purchase at a fixed price based upon 21 years rental, one fourth of the money being paid down, and the balance allowed to remain at interest at 4 per cent The result seems to have been generally satisfactory the only drawback to the success of the experiment having been the costs of conveyance and encumbrance, which averaged nearly 11 per cent upon the purchase money) One man who bought the site of his cabin an J forte built by himself for he was actually charged £12 10s 10d for legal expenses and the worst of it is that a general impression prevails among those who have suffered thus at the hands of the lawyers that the laws if not designed, are actually such as to prevent poor men becoming and remaining owners of land in a paper on the future of Switzerland by Mr 1 Cuu here Owen, the writer adduces some plausible reasons for concluding that " in the event of renewed complications between France and Germany, hostilities will probably be commenced, on the French side at least, be) a march into Switzerland German on her side, can scarcely be expected to await passively the arrival of the enemy at her very frontiers, and will probably likewise march into Switzerland to meet the invading forces The rival armies would in that case find themselves in a rich and fertile country with numerous lines of railway, excellent roads, no fortifications of any kind and requiring at least a fortnights time before the troops could be got under arms " Unfortunately also for Switzerland, hostile tariffs are closing her in on every side so that the outlook is really serious Manu factories will have to be closed, whole in dustries will be ruined, and the industrial classes will be forced either to emigrate or to turn to agriculture, which is not very rema nerative in Switzerland. If to evert thC38 disasters, Zollverein should be concluded with France, a military convention would follow and then the question arises, Could 1 France effectively guarantee the independence of Switzerland' Mr Orb) Shipley applies himself to an examination of the claims of the Church of England to the possess on and exercise of any divine authority Many of its members he alleges, are inquiring whether this great nation does possess any supernatural power, and if so, when, where, and by whom was it given, what are its proofs, and how is it formulated, and the result of these in quotes in his own case has been that no logical and satisfying answer can be found for them Hence he has quitted the Anglican communion Mr T It Stailiam relates a story of annexation in South Africa which helps to throw a certain amount of light upon the causes of the present war in that portion of the empire The career of the three " representatives of the book soldier, the fighting tactician and the intrepid military rowdy," namely, Jomim, Moreau, and Vandamme, is traced by Mr C F Cromie Although he makes out the first of these to have been notwith standing his great genius, an irritable prig, he exhibits the Emperor Napoleon in a still more contemptible light, as meanly jealous of the man who rose from the position 05 junior bank clerk to that of the first military strategist of his age, and prettily vindictive towards him Napoleon's jealousy of Moreau likewise amounted to positive hatred and the writer causes us to feel the justice of Byron's apostrophe to the magnificent butcher :— " With might unquestion'd power to save — Thine only gift hath been the grave To those that worshipp'd thee ; Nor till they fall, could mortals guess Ambition's less than littleness !
