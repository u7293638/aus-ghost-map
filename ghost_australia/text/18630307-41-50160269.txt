?WILLIAMSTCATK. [From our own Correspondent.! wuiiamstown. March 4. xne iong-iaik-ea-oi return nne matcn tietween the Lyndoch and Williamstown Companies came Dli' yesterday on our own ground. Fourteen men were entertained in the early part of the day that it would prove rainy ; hut this fortunately was not the case, though it remained cluudy all day, which nras certainly desirable, as it prevented the glare of the sun on the rifle sights. After sunset we had a Bhower or two. Both companies were on the ground about half-past !» o'clock, when the firing commenced; and at the conclusion of the 20U yards range the Williamstown Company took the lead by six points. At the 4(KJ the Williamstown men went greatly ahead, the score at this range lieing 35 points higher than the Lyndoch's. At BOO the Williamstown Rifles lost two; but at the 800 they again won by 27, being at the conclusion of the match victors by (-3 points. The targets and regu lations were in accordance with those at Wimble don. This is this young company's tirst contest, the winning of which, both in the first match and the return, has put them in high epirits. The ground presented an exceedingly gay and animated ap pearance ; not only our fair friends in the vicinity, nut many from u considerable distance had come with their families to enjoy a holiday on our beau tiful range, and to animate the heart* of the volun teers with their presence. Many little picnic parties might lie seen in various spots along the banks of the creek and under the tall and noble gum-trees. A sweepstakes match was afterwards got up, and entered for by about 30 volunteers and visitors, and the proceeds were divided into four prUes, which were won by Corporal Bennett, Dr. Nott, and Privates Button and M.
