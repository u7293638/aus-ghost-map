THE RECTOR, AND THE GHOST. Ghosts have appeared— or rather been beard — at Durweston, a Dorset village near Blandford. The spirits are of the. rapping and scratching des cription, and nearly drove the widow West and her three daughters to dis traction. . The rector and schoolmaster were called in, and agreed to watch through a night. Mrs West had pro vided a slate and pencil, and requested the spirit or spirits to write on the slate if there was anything to com municate. The slate was placed on the bedroom window inside the room. The woman and her daughters went to bed, leaving the door open. The rector and his companion remained at the top of the stairc tse with a light, awaiting events. They heard scribbling on the slate, and then four taps with the pencil. They rushed in and found Mrs West and the children in bed, and not a sign that they had moved,- but on the slate were the words " Mony," " Garden," with a nought above aud below. The. rector, it is said, is pre pared to . swear that no one in the iiouse wrote the . wiords. So far no body has dug in the " garden " for the " mony." The spirit, or spirits, must have left school before 1871.
