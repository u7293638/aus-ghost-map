" For Sake of the Family," &c.;, Ac. Night was falling fast over burn and brae as the twsi girls nestled close together in the cwrriod. that was rapidly nearing Home wood. Although having only parted in slmmier, when. bioIthI said good-bye to school, they hlad a thousand things to ask and tell. being bosom friends. " Oh, Elsie, is this your home ? , How beautiful! " uttered ,loyna O'Neil, cranirng her head out to admire the scene, as they turned in at a lodge. To the left the Wlhitewater brawled hoarsely in its rocky bed; lwhile on the right tie oak wood rose steeply in a gloridius sweleep, of ru-set foliage. Ahead, I lie old house loomed massire on the river baik, two hlighl windows glowing with lights, four Lu reot frowning. - ale.srjs-s uarttstl a r} ni woindoweo," siid Elaie Stirling.

No tine allowed here if You c me bly late train. I'11 keep you coml piny. No thanks! I must! " loyua ulnderstood Ilher friend's warning better as a little later both tripped quietly down thegreat stairs, still in thleir travelling dresses, having only had time for a cat's toilet, asn Mloyna slaid. One footman stood watclhing the clock, withl a Iland half raised. TiLe lutIler stoold withI onie hand already on tile knoh of thle library door, and his anxious eye fixsed on the footman, for he could not see the clock where he cstood. Inside the library Mr. Stirling was pacing on a regular trick lIp andi dorwntllat long room, one hand holding his watchll, the other under his coat tail. For an instant his gaze left the eighty guinea timlekeeper to note who entered, and lie gruIntLed: " llllumph-just saved your life; llisa (lNeil. One minute inure and you would be late. Elsie, where tile dickens is your Aunt Angelina ? i If shie keeps me waiting Hlis redl fare grew crimson, as he stood still glowering at tile watch; then, iii answer to a tlimid murmur fromi the wife, the steam of Ithis simmelnlrilng wrath was let off in a violent nonrt. " lWhat do you say ?-wait ? Wait for Lady lMacTaggart! Because it is tier first visi. since her ilhusband lied! By George! it will be tile last if shle's not here in one miniute and a quarter!" llThe three ladies watched his face, on 1which the veins were swelling ominously loyna felt brenthlea, hler heart qui thumrped There! wih a glare the hoe was thro nopen. " Dino er is aerved nouned," the butle Then fromn the oak galleryat the top of the stairs piped a shriiyl weak voice: " I'm coaing!-just comingi Only the steps are so slippelry'." AInd a feebly elegant figure appeared, holding with ostentatiou;n frighllt by the balustrade as shite descended. `Mean timle Moyna thought her host lookeid like a human hlippopotamus about to IIhave in apop leetic fit, as, advancing to the door, he wailed. Misguided Lady MlacTaggart! S She im- I pered in Mr. Stirling's face; spread out a 1 fashionably made green gown, and dropped a low curtsey. 'Pray forgive me (in an affected voice). l I wrished to rwear my new watered silk for thie I first time in your honour. And it was quite I a tansk to understand its fastenings.-' Without a word, Mr. Stirling thrust hist elbow at her. The alarmed.lady claspedit with deprecatory finger- tips, and all filed lmute into the dining-temple. Silently each I began the soup. The host was last. Sud- I denly a roar burst from him. Cold! Stone- cold!" There followed a volley of spluttering sounds, unintelligible t from wiiath, like a shower of stones flung up by a volcano before eruption. Notl a word came in answer. Old Stitling shot one em bracing glance at the four bent female faces. Thenll his fury overwhelmed him, and seizing his plate of soup, he poured the con tents into Lady i1aeTaggart's lap. " Take that for your watored silk!" Consternation l! After the first shriek and otart,tlhe unhappy guest burst into tears, and mopped each eye in turn with a six-inch square of lace.- The butler with unmoved face began wiping tihe damaged dress, while the lady snuftfled in woebegone accents that; his efforts were of no use. It was ruined! She could never wear it again. " Oi, Francis, and it was her best, new, lovely dress!'" bleated Mer. Stirling. shocked It the outrage to her sister-iii-law, Her small stork of courage lean all exhausted in that murmur, leaving her quite pale . Mr. Stirling was nou calmed, and sat forc ing a smile of pity for the fonlishqeso of woniankind. He answered jovially, to hide some secret shame! , - * " lovely gwo il Ithat ynou idea of a 707 .I* call it frightful. Eh, Elsie, What do you say?" All eyes tirned on Elaib The girl answered bluntly, in a tone which her parent might flatter himself was a (vastly improved) cripy of his own, in its bri'ht frankness. "Then give her another,fatlher, as good or better Auni; Angelina, I never did think that green quile becoming. It ougilt to have been toned down with lace," -Old Stiriing looked hard at his daugtlier, to detect any signs of insubordination. But \- her blue eyes were inmocent in expression as :hose of a baby. With real relief he saltched at tho ougestion . - S"Allqright!l Sol will~and do you help your nut to choose it. 'There, your lamlyship, yo clain't eayyoil don't get the best of that I~argain; you get a new gosen for yoilr Clyt one. But you've spoilt my dinner, my lade. -. and as aman can only eat a given omimbir of dinners in his life, that can never he r,-. placed." -Lady ilacTaggart rae at leadt that si, would become the possessor of two eool gowns, for Elsie's hint as to hilling tie damage with lace Hounced over the watered silk hiad not bhen thrown awa;sy. So shi sieetly smiled with the forgvinig air ofn experienced martyr; and the Imlconent s-as closed. \- Only during the rest of that evuniimg toyna O'Neil became almost hysterical is her mirth at any trifling jest; so that MIr. Stirling told her with grim approval that " mhe was a msrrj soul and no mistake." But Elaie's eye wadi apprehensive, and she took off her friend to bed early, on the plea that after a long-journey 1Moyna must be over tired. And so the latter was. - "l. could not sleep, Iknow, far .nu hour yet. Don't go away, dear-stay ann chat with inc just for a little whlile." So Elsie stayed, lightening her consciruce by partly undress ing while itoyna did the same; the friends unloosing respectively black and golden tresses. Then they both laughed, and oli tted and huggedrl their knees over the woodl fIre with innocent delight in its warmth, like a pair of kittens. As they talked, suddenly eleven struck-in the gallery outside. It was prefaced by a prolonged wheeze, as if the old grand fatiter clock was nearing the end of his funse lions. aloyina shirered. rattle! This is a very picturesque old room, Elsic; but I wish it was nearer to yours.' And tlie speaker glanced faint-heartedly round the tapestry-hung chamber, one corner of which wideneditinto'a round turret, pierced with loopholes, that gave an uncanny air to the dark recess, although it was prosaically used, nowadays, as a washing-closeat.. " 1 am only at the other end of the gallery. Ttrisis my wingso naturally I wanted you to be in it; There iareonly two rooms between uls: one is my sitting-room, and the other is bigger and more lonely-looking than this. You would not have cared for it." C'lheerful though the reply was, some in flection in the last sentence caught Moyna's quick ear; and sihe faced sharply round.' E Elise! Is this wing haunted ? Ah, you won't answer, but one can see it is, by. your face." " Oh, if it comes to that, there.is.hardly a corner of Htomewood that is not said to be. haunted," returned -its heiress with spirit. " Only this I can assure-,you, I, have. dever once seen a ghost myself. Ei (IleF t ' ively) when I was quite a small ild flithli nursery.

How many hours had passed she knew not when itoyna roused from that heavy and drowsy alumber. Starting, she became aware that a noise must have startled `'er ear-tre click of the opening door. Surely the housemaid was coming to wake her. That was a streak of daylight-No! No! With a sudden chilling of the blood. I Moyna became aware that it was still the dead of night, for the room was plupged in I darkness but for a thin streak of light that seemed to come from far, far away. And What was that? Within the protected beam of the faint light, which seemed to be that of another world, a white spirit-form was gliding towards her.

Yet-with all praikie be 'it 'said-in. spite of that awful terror which almost always seizes the living when face to face with a being of the in kknown land, the thought darted through the girl's. brain that her promise must be kept.
