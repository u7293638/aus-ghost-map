INI-IAN TEAS. Melbowne Age , March 29tb, 1881. XWELVBt months have just olapsed since ? public atention was directed by the Age to a mooting held at tho Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta, on the 9th of February, 18S0, to con sider the advisability of forming a syndicate with a viow of opening up a trado.in Indian teas with Australia. From time to timo wo have chronicled, with considerable satinfactiou, tho gradual but certain growth of this trade, because wo Baw in it the elements out of which a largo interchange of products beneficial to both countries would grow. It has been a matter of comment, not only in this colony, but uIbo in India, that the protectionist, and not tho freotrade, Press gave ita early and cordial sup port to this new movement. But. the reaBono may be readily foundN in the disregard by the former of what tho latter lpok upon aa too ORcred to meddle with — viz , vested interests. For years the Australia n tea drinker has boon forced to tako China tea and China tea only, whilst the conaervanso of the trade in the hnuds-of the few has hardly Rddcd appreciably to tho interests of tho cbnaumore. Competition there bas been certainly, but not of tho claee most desirable. It was-* the competition, not of who- should import tho beat tc-o-, but who should offer the cheapest. The in troduction of a new competitor, outside the importers from China, » baa, it- will be seen from-the figure© wo give, beon followed by a desire &mong6t; consumers to havo their real money's worth. The ordinary mixture of what is known as tico shilling and halfa-crown tea too often consists of the blending of low quality China teas from SW. to 1*. 2d. pcr lb. in lond\ fortified by the ad^Utbn of a small- sprinkling of heavy flavoured Assam to oive it''sotour and-strength. However profitable this system was to tho sel lers, the consumer was hardly the gaiuer, and tho former most certainly had uo reasons- for attempting to overcome any prejudice which the boupewife might entertain against trying something new. Indeed, we*fiud in England this same cause has militated against tho ex tensive use of Indian teas in the United King dom. 44 Tbe efforts that hove been- made for the laot fouT or five years to introduce Indian tea to the British public in 3 pure and'unmixed abate are only now beginning to toar fruit.' In many towns and centres- of population, Indian tea can now be had in an unmixed state, and- this has tended, wo are told, to in crease consumption largely. 44 It is- 'hard,' adds the journal we quoto from, 44 to under stand how it could be otherwise, as, if a hundred peoplo drink pure Indian- tea for & month, .ninety of them will keep to it, if they can prooure it ; hence, large increa&e; hi con } sumption has resulted from the introduction of Indian tea in such a form that tho consumer : -could obtain it genuine.' If. however, we possess, in common with our English relatives, a prejudice against changing ; suddenly our Jideas on ;the matter of what we . shall eat or drink, having once made up our minde-th&t; tbe new is better. than the old, we ? do not wait long to act upon our experience. ' This is emphatically shown by tbe rapid in crease in tbe demaud for Indian teas. Prior to The Age directing attention to this- staple early last year, tbe importation and' consumption of .Indian- leaf was almost nominal) but the figureB we now give illustrate to what enteot, within the last eight months, tho demand has in creased*. With a view of preventing exception being.taken to our data, wo show in the follow ing table when the sales havo been effected. Those by pnblio auotion are as follows Date* Deecrip- Ghosts.

To. the foregoing we add private sales covering 20-ohests, 1,492 half-cheats, and 100 boxes of Indian and 91 half- cheats of Ceylon, bringing up tho gross total of the sales for the eight months to 995 chests). 3,256 half-chests, 472 qyarfcwr-ehests, and 322:jboxes- or representing u net weight of 474,57iLlbs. of Indian tea, a result which justifies us-saying that the intro duction of Indian teaa .into Victoria has been successfully achieved.' Compared with the cheage whioh has takeu plaeo in England, we quote tho following :r . Ix 1860 tbe consumption of tea per head of population was, in. tho United Kingdom 2,622 and 038 lb, for China and Indian respectively, and both increased till tbe year 1875, whon the figures stood at 3,728 and *712 lb. respectively. As regards Indiau tea, the- increase has continued tip ' to .date, while -tho deliveries of China tea have practically remained stationary since that time. The consumption of Indian tea por annum, per bond of population, has boen as follows since 1875: — 1875,. ?7121b.; lS7fc -80S lb.; 1877, -836 lb.; 1878, 1-087; lb. ; 1879, 1*037 lb.; 1889, ;. 1-269 lb; During tho last four mouths of . 1880 the deliveries were at the rate of 4,000,000 lb. per month, which was equal to an annual consumption of 1'391-lb. per, head, or S4;per cent, over the consumption , of 1875. ? It is rather a- singular fact that the free-. \- traders of Sydney have decided not to oncou*. rage businestv in teas with India. Having, established satisfactory relatione. with China, which yisld the importers a good profit, it is evidently not thought; advisable to. offer a ohange-fco- the consumer. . It is a matter of little moment apparently to them that the teamen ofithe north have boon yearly, drop ping the qpality of their teas so as to-be able to offer tham at & price which forbids competition ;. that they indulge to an enormous extent in adultorations; and that the percentago of duat and broken loaf has risen saason aftan-seasoii. Foo Chow,. Canton, and Amoy are tho cheapest markets,, and, following implicitly thu.creed of the latter* day freetrader,, the Sydney, trader bujak there. It is just possible, however, — indoedi the late experiences of tho toa. markets both in England and Yictoria rather encourage tbo expectation — that tbo tea drinkers of both countries aro going to take a loaf out of John Chinaman's own b ok* Tho latter declines the adulterated oottou goods of froetrade Man chester, and is giving a proferencQ-to.the purer cloths of Amerioa, anddt would but bo natural that, in like manner Euglani and Victoria should also show a preference for tho unadul terated teas of India as ag iush the manufac tures of the -( heathen Ohiueo.'
