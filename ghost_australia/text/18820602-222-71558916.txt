MONKEYS AND -LIGHT. It is a strange fact that in night-time an unknown sound will scare monkeya almost ouit of their wits. The creaking of a wheel barrow,a whisper, the rustling of a window curtain, is enough to throw them into i fit of horrified screams and contortions; capuchin monkeys rush wildly through their cage, mac. aques try to force their: prison-doors, the little marmosets- huddle together like the princes in the Tower, all about a matter they would disdain to notice in daytime. Tihe old males of the anthropoid apes are about as hard to scare as any living -creature, but after dark the vyriest trifle will inspire them with an almost supernatural fear; and it may be a mere fancy, but I cannot get rid of the notion that this night-horror of our hirsute relatives must be the origin of the spectre dread of savage nations, and indirectly, per haps, of medieval demonism and modern spiritualism, --."ghost-mongery," as the sceptical Germanscall it. Monkeys are not very sharp-scented, and have to rely on their eyes, and in night-time, therefore, are almost at the mercy of their enemies, jaguars, pan thers, ind leopards, whose owl-eyes enable them to hunt by moonlight, and in the virgin woods of the tropics the constant dread of mistaking the approach of a murderer for the rustling of the fitful night-wind would be enough to make a Berscrker nervous. " It is not books or pictures," says Charles Lamb, " nor the stories of foolish servants, which crerite these terrors in children. They can at most give them a direction. The stories of the Chimieras and Gorgons may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition, but they were there before. They are transcrjpts, types: the arctih-types are in us, and eternal. May it sot be that those archetypes are the prowling ferac of the tropical forests?-Ex. ehahge.
