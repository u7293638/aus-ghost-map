NO CONNEXION WITH THE GHOST OVER THE WAY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-This supernatural appearance in one of your contemporaries (what a word !) of a letter in which my good name is filched has induced me to once more break loose from Hades. It needs no ghost to tell you that this false and it, is that the original GHOST OF TOM CRINGLE. A OAUioATDRE has been published at Matamoras, which represents Uncle Sam lying flat on his back with Canada underneath nine, and his head in his Russian purchase, taking an iced drink, his legs cramped up by a rickety fence named Jlcxico. Uncle Sam meditatively says he will have to stretch out his legs directly. The picture tickles the Texans amazingly.
