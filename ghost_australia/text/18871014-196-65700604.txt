THE GOLDEN: HOPE.* A BOMANCE OF THE DEEP. I dreamt a dream that w.e not all a dream.' Br W. rCLAR RussenL. CarPrrTa XX.-A Fol'eLr Drscossorx. They had no sooner left the cabin than a head witha arimn pale face on it and disor* dared hair and reddish eyelashes popped out of a separe bhonk on the port side, and after taking a quick glance around, was followed by the body and legs of Johnny, the * bo,.' This youth was about seventeen years old, stupid, but willing, and he was useful as one of the ships company, because bthough he hardly knew how to make a long splice, he could help to roll no a sail, and was a very good servant for the cabin, besidee being see. viceshle as a sort of cook's mate. He had ' ll night in' becauose he was kept at work all day, hat feeling tired after breakfast and guesning he would not he missed for a quarter of an hour or so, he had sneaked into the spare cabin buak, that was in reality a hole uo toe side, such as you see in smsacks, with the intention of merely resting his limbs, hbut had fallen faet adlep He wa awakened by the entrance of Mr. Forteenue and the two men; when, eealislng his slena. tion, and the rop.'oending that might follow his detection, he lay breathless, lie. tenine to all that was said. When the mate left the cabin and Hiram entered his herth. Johnny tumbled out of his hunk and went to see after the cabin dinner. The cook was a man named Micky Anson, i a fat ignorant person irritatit lihe mostseaa cooks. His temper aboard the Golden Hope had not been improved by the smallness of the galley, the want of elbowroom, and the wild and lively motion of the schooner during the had weather, when on one occasion he had been washed outne of the caboose hr a sea, and when he had been eevrra times scalded by capsized sanc-pane. Whether, but for the cook's temper, Johnny would ever have repeated a word of what he had heard in the cabin, cannot be imagined; but on being angrily assailed hr Anson for lainane' and neglecting to do his 'bit' and the liko the lad said,' Micky s'elp me as I stand, I'd hsbeen here if it wara't for a uhost story. I heerd it inthecahin.

"It sailore in those daysre were livelier and heartier and better. seamen than they are in these, it must be owned that they were also more Ignorant. Nut ignorant in the sense of *laming,' as they termed it. for am many could read and write then as can read and write now, but in respect to sea reuperetitioni. In-our age the prosaic mechanical spirit of the engine room has entered the seafaring calling, and in the furnaces of the steamyrs most of the marine spectree and beliefs have been borned up never to appear again, Butt in the age of the Golden aope, Friday waoe still an unlucky day; a master would risk his epara to pick up a cat that had fallen over board; the Fian, as a native of Ruelsian Fin land was termod, was a igtlClian in'the eyes of many eailors; and though the Flying Dutchman was mentioned on the whole with incredulity, scores of enporltitiones much more absurd and much less poetical prevailed in ships' forecastles and 'tween decks where Jack swung his hammock. The cook having obtained from. Johnny a most perverted ver. eion of the narrative Mr. Forteecue had related to the 'captain and Stone, very natu. rally procured its conveyrance forward in a manner that was formerly observable in sea. cooks-as thus: It being the captain's watch on deck, and consequently William Breeches's watch below, for. William was in the mate's watch, Breeches came to the galley for a light for his plhoy. Williiinm,'eays the cook, 'what wasinvnour head, mate, when you signed articles for this here woyage?' Breeohes s rveys him leisurely, ' and answers, 'Seventy bob a month. Micky.' AA.' .sys the cook, ' that's right enough but what wan the destination given ye?' 'Why.' said Breechee leaning in the door way, and taking a look at wbhat the watch on deck were doine, 'a hisland in the Indij, Ocean, warn't it? I've signed on for a rmood many worages in me time. hat somehow I've never caught myself taking notice of where we're hound till we gets there.' ' What d'ye say,' exclaims the cook, ' of the parson haying this here schooner to fetch a ghost tff the Island we're bound to?' 'Git oat,' said Breeches. 'Well,' says the cook, 'it's Johnny's yarn; and here he relates how the lad came to overhear the conversation in the cabin, exaggerating the youth's version of course. and embellishabing it with several original touches. 'If it's true it's blazing queer,' says Breeches. 'Alth' says the cooic 'and the more rou think of it, the likelier it is. What does a parson want to sail to a hisland in the Indian Ocean for, that's cot no name, eh? Jost ask yourself that, William. It ain't for trafflok. ing; there's no bartorin' Thames ballast. anyway;s no fear of It being for slaving and the likes of that.

' It was the custom of the watches to get euppor together, and shortly before four bello (6 o'.lock) the men having finished the meal were on the forecastle; for the evening was beautiful, the wind warm, and the an de. erending in sueach spolendour that von wold have thought younrself in parallels higher than the ihetiands to have seen the brirht hII ames vn 'hi',c ont of the har.y crimson vortex and the linte of ribbod clouds robed in gold and orange and pink and scarlet, with toe sky a most delicate dim green between them, and the sea coming with a bright coppergiare upon it not of the went, and sweeping with the heavens into dark blue into the east. There neter was a more peaceful pticture than Lhe schnnner made at that hour. Steeped in the flowing western glaryt the fll honunom of her caneos were tineed with orange, while in the concavites which faced the east, whence the wind was blowing as though the levered breath of the African desert were mingled in the freshness and sweetness it gathered frlm the ocean initsa light-in those conoavities the shadows lay like the blue dusk of evelinug, time furnishing an exquisite contrast to an are no situated as to embrace both the con,. vexities and hollows of the attie. There was nothing in eight the wide waters round. IM Forteecoe and Hiram were drinking tea on deck, Stone was below. In the bows were the crew, sitting on the windlass end or loaning against the weather rail, the cookand ohnny in the midst of tnoem, apparently yarning or as Itram would sometimes fancy, arguing, when he cast his glance forward, but speaking low, with askant looks aft. It wrn the first dogwatch, and they had the second yet to go through before they settled down to night duty or repose. The whole length of the achnoner was between Weeks and his man; haut if this were not enough so to nobdue the voices of the crew as to render their words in audibls aft, there w. the swinging of canere aloft as the Golders. [ope rolled, toe ounds of water disturbed and moving over the aide, small straining sId chaffing noisee, and hesides, Captain litram conversed with. Mr Fortescse, though no reference was mude hetweeno them to what had passed in the habin. It was otherwise on the forecastle, where the account that had been given to the cook' by Johntn was being gravely discussed. ' Mates.' said Breeache, feeling itn his trousers pocket. for a pipe, ' wat seems to ime the queerest part of this job is that if that there Johny's yrarn is true, it's plain that the capt'n and the mate didn't know any more nor us what was the motive of this worags.' That's what strikes me as the roummiest nart, too,' said Tim Dock, a easuy looklig. somewhat merryfaaed seaman of tbhirty. * The parson evidentlr got to windward of the old man afors sailing, and now we're a fort night out, and, the ctruths told, the skipper don't know what to do.' 'If he wants adwitia' I'm game for one,' remarked the cook. 'Who says he danno what to do?' asked ftMartin Goldsmith. 'He don't look much disturbel. I allow his face cotldn't he much longer than it is, but if there's any hinward ospeaizl in a man re'rs not gning to see him smilinig and appearing lietsy like Hiram there. as If he'd got the young woman he's a Osurtiug oo his knee.'

'Johnny,' said Breeches In a severe voice, d're mean to asw that the parson told the skipper and Bill that there was a habort on an lelai'd in the Indian Ocean, and that we was honsd out to fetch it?

This the old sailor stood gazing at for some moments with the sort of reverenlce in his face tnat the gratndeourns and bemttles of nature excite in plain and simple minds, after which his eye was taken by the crow talkine together on the forecastle.
