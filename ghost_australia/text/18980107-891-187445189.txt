The Fair Ijittle Maiden. " There is ono at the door, Wolfe .O'DriscoU, ' At the door, who is bidding1 you'come!" Who is ho that wakes me m the darkness, Calling when all the world's dumb V* " Six horses has he to his carriage, Six horses blacker than the night, And their twelve red eves in the shadows . Twelve lamps he carries for his light; " And his coach is a coffin black and mouldy, A huge black coffin open wide He asks for vour soul, Wolfe O'DriscoU, . Who is calling at the door outside.'-' " Who let hinttliro* the gates of my gardens, ; Where stronger bolts have never been?" _ " 'Twas the father of the fair little maiden • You drove to her grave so green." " And who let him pass thro' the courtyard, By loosening the bar and the chain ?" 4t Ob, who but the brother of the maiden,' Who lies in the cold and the rain!" 4! Then who drew the holts at the porta), And into my house bade him go?" " She, the mother of the poor young maiden Who lies in her youth so low." " Who stands, that he dare not enter The door of my chamber, betwecu?"' " Oh, the ghost of the fair little maiden, •' • Who lies iu the churchyard green." —CtQfEXT SlIOETEE.
