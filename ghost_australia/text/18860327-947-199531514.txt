; ECHOES OF MELBOURNE .'. \- [By The Ghost. J ?;', , ' The electoral battle' is over, and 'both sides cau now reckon their losses aud their - gains. Thero is little doubt that so far as mere numbers go the Coalitionists have the . advantage of the Oppositionists. , But' the ?now Assembly will present to the onlooker a different appearance to: that observable during the late Service cuin-Borry reign.

The Protection League vanished some time ago, the Burke and Wills monument ha3 been removed from Collins-street, where it lias stood for some twenty years, and now the far-famed 'saddling paddock' attached . to the Theatre Royal has boon 'improved - out of existenco' by the newlyeonstituted Licensing Court. . Henceforth Phryno, . Lais,Aspasia, and all the gay and painted ladies for whom the place has' been - specially' sot;; apart as a happy, hunting ground, will'be scattered fit the various, bars of the theatre, rendering ; all equally disreputable by their presence.
