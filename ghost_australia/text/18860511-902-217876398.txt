Laying a GhOst. A New Haven despatch to a New Y'ork paper says In the Roman Catholic Cemetery in Bir mingham early on the mornipg of the 18th ultimo, four middle-aged women and two men, the latter armed wi'h spades and picks, entered by tlie side gate and halted in front of a newly made grave. The men set to woib, while the women wept, and opened a grave nnd hauled a coffin up; The lid was taken off and the remaius of a beautiful young girl were revealed. She was the daughter of one of the women, and the mother shrieked loudly when she snw the corpse. The men stood aside and the, four women bent over the coffin, and deft fingers went rapidly through the dead girls hair ana shroud, and all the pins that could be found on the remains were removed. Then a needle and thread were produced, and the shroud and hair sewn back into their places. . The lid was then screwed back on the coffin, and the remains were again lowered into the grave, which was at once filled up, It was learned that the women were of a very superstitions nature, and that they believsd tliat if a corpse is buried with the shroud pinned up instend of sewed, the soul will be crnfined to the grave for eternity, and the person? guilty of the mistake will be haunted until death by the ghost of, the victim. A, mistake was made in this case und .one of- the women claims that she lias seen the ghost for two or three nights successively, arid she could - stand it no longer ; so 8he got the other women together, and' between them they hired the men to disenter the body. .The ghost has not been) seen since.
