The Class - Meeting. ' He would not be far wrong, -in our judgment, who would assert that more good has come to Methodism by means of the class-meeting thau from any other source. Out of class-meetings have come mighty revivals, which, like devouring fire, swept everything before XT ? T ? J.1- _ _1 _? ?

Here they told their experiences in sympathising ears and received comfort from the holy fellowship which made membership in the Church of God a heavenly privilege. Here timid souls were trained to pray in public, to speak stirring words of exhortation, and.it was no wonder that the Holy Ghost came down in glory and in power, and that tremendous revivals ensued. Why not revive the class-meeting ? The prayer-meeting has been made to do service'for this blessed institution of Methodism, but it can never do the work of the class-meeting. It is too public. There are too many in it. The class is a little company working to build each other up in holy living. It means love, personal sympathy, personal influence and association, and more or less intimate confidence. The public prayer-meeting can not build up, for these reasons, as the class meeting can and does. At this time there is great need for increase of spirituality, and we are strongly of the opinion that the best way to build up a people spiritually is to form them in classes under the care of a level headed, spiritual leader, one who knows God and has had much experience in the ways of the spirit. Such a one will be a shepherd of the sheep, and out of 1 all will grow a spiritual holy Church. â€” 1 he Methodist Advocate Journal.
