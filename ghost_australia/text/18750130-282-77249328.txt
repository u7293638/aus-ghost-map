So off we ........................ to beat the ........ south wind. As we rattle along ...................... special train, ...........:— Dash along, crash along, sixty miles an hour: Right thro' old England flee, For I am bound to see my love, Far away in the North countrie. Like a train of ghosts the telegraph posts to ........... trooping by. While one by one the mil.......... run, and off behind un fly: Like foaming wine it ... my blood to see your light- ning speed:— Wheel along, sound along, sixty miles an hour! Right thro' old England flee! For I am bound to see my love, Far away in the North countrie. My blessing on old George Stephenson! let his ........ for ever last; For he was the man that formed the plan to make you run so fast. His arm was strong, his head was long, he knew not guile nor fear; When i think of him it makes me proud that I'm an engineer! Tear along, flare along, sixty miles an hour! Right thro' Old England flee! For I am bound to see my love, Far away in the North countrie. Now Thames and Trent are far behind and evening's shades are come, Before say eyes the brown hills rise that guard my true love's home! even now she stands, my own dear lass, beside the cottage door, And she listens for the whistle shrill, and the blast pipe's rattling roar. Roll along, bawl along, sixty miles an hour! Right thro' Olde England flee! For I am bound to see my love. At home in the North countrie.
