CITY OE ADELAIDE. The Sheriff as Returning Officer of the Legislative Council, presided in persou at the central booth on the Corporation Acre; Mr. Lazar, Mayor of Adelaide, acting as his deputy for the division.

The other deputies were as follow: - Hindmarsh-square, Mr. J. F. Bouc&ut; Whitmore-square, Mr. N. Snmmers; Light square, Mr. Hiram Mildred; and North Adelaide^ Mr. \V. A. Hughes. We visited each from time to time during the day, with a view to watching the progress of the ballot, but everything went on so quietly and regu larlythaUberewasreollynothingtonoticeorremark upon. Even at the central booth there was but the ghost of a crowd, varying from 40 OT 60 people to 80 or 100; and it the other voting-places there were seldom more than 10 or 20 persons collected. The arrangements were most excellent, no one having I een detained for an unnecessary moment. It is true jhat only 1,795 electors exercised tho right of voting or the Assembly, but all who watched the proceedings must have seen that twice or three times that number might have done so without the slightest difficulty. At the close of the balloting the Returning Officer con sulted the scrutineers as to the propriety of examining tho voting-papers at once or deferring the scrutiny till the following morning. Some difference of opinion existing between those gentlemen, he put it to a show of hands, and the result was a resolution, carried by 4 against 3, to proceed with the examination the same evening, and 6 o'clock was appointed for the purpose. We subjoin the names of the scrutineers, as called over by Mr. Lazar: -Messrs. Dick (Coglin), Carlin (Burford), Portwiue (Bomersham), Berry or Wilkinson (Pearce), Glandficbl (Finniss, Hanson, and Neales), Wardle (Dutlon),' and English (Torrens). No scrutineer was appointed by Mr. Parkin. Precisely at noon on Tuesday, Mr. J. Lazar, Mayor ot Adelaide, attended as Returning Officer, upon the plat form at the Corporation Acre, and declared the result of the poll as follows: Toirens 1,208 Hanson 1,179 Dutton 1,143 Franiss 1,103 Neales 959 Burford 620 Coglin 413 Parldn ... 326 Pearce 310 Homcrsham 272 He therefore declared Messrs.
