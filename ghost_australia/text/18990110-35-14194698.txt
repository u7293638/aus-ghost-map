FATALISM AND PROTESTANTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, After confessing our faith in the Apostles' Creed in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the one eternal God, who is not only unity, but social life, love, we add two articles which tell of the fellow- ship founded by that our faith-" I believe the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints That one true Church " as truly lies in the sphere of faith, the " things not seen," as do the rather, Son, and Holy Ghost All its members are " born of God," are " joined to the Lord," Jesus, and enjoy fellowship one with another," and by the graces of their Christian life " the fruit of the spirit," are " epistles of Christ known and read of all men" who are influenced by them and led to faith in the Son of God See St, John xvii, 6, 20-24 Now, fair, whereas the Apostles' Creed in accordance with the New Testament expects us, as a spiritual consequence of our faith in Father, Son. and Holy Ghost, to believe the one true Church, that is that there is a Holy Catholic Church, the mystical body of Christ, u hichis " the blessed company of all faithful people," the Papacy requires it, adherents to believe that it is itself " the one true Church, from which the members of all non-Papal churches are shut out Hence Pope Pius spoke thus plainly " I alone, despite lay unworthiness, am the Vicar of Jesus Christ . . . I am the way, the truth, and the Life , they who are with me and with the Church, they who are not with me are out of the Church, they are out of the way the way, the truth, and the life." Thus, according to Papahsm, it is faith in Rome's claim to be the one Church, and not faith in Christ's claim to be the one Saviour, which and as to the Church, which is "embody." the Lord Jesus says " I am the way, the truth, and the life , no man cometh unto the Father but by Mo " But the Pope takes the words out of His mouth and says " I am the way, the truth, and the life," " they who are not with me are out of the Church of the way, the truth, and the life " Protestant out Catholics believe that Christ is the way to the Church, but Roman Catholics believe that the Pope and his Church are the way to Christ The late Cardinal Newman wrote The essence of the one Catholic and Apostolic Church is that there is on earth a representative of of our absent Lord, or something divinolyintorposod between the soul and God " " The question is Has Christ or has he not left a representative behind him ' There is no medium between a vice Christ and Anti- Christ " Yes, that is the point We, Protestant Catholics, say with lortuUian that the Holy Spirit is Chnst'ifVicar, and the Church of Eng) and says in Homely X , part III "The Bishop of Rome ought rather to be called the anti- Christ than Christ's Vicar 01 Peter's suc cessor " According to Protestant Catholics the one true Church " is an objective reality, though not as yet manifested in its collective or corporate capacity in what St. Paul calls " the revealing of the sons of God" (Romans MU, 11) Protestantism asserts a visibility of the body of Christ co-extensive with its actual members only, known by their " fruits," the exhibition of the distinctive graces of Christian life, which may exist altogether independent of the variety of forms of government adopt a by a circular visible Churches, in which "the pure word of God is preached and the sacraments are duly ministered in ill tmugsthat of necessity are requisite to the same " (Acts xix ), and in which, unlike the body of Christ," which truly is holy, " the evil be over mingled with the good " A moderate uniformity of church government, as one way of manifesting to the world the unity of " the one true Church, may be very desirable, and all such absence of it as springs from selfishness, self- assertion, and disregard of the moral authority of the truth of God and the will of God is the result of sin but false doctrine, heresy, and schism are not peculiar to one age or to any one visible Church representative of " the one of no Church They existed in the davsoftho Apostles themselves, and true and desirable uniform jtymustspnng from true unity of men who " hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the Lord of peace, and in righteousness of life " there can be no unity in the Slave region The world would be infinitely poorer, and the Church of Christ would be much further off from any such unity as God, according to the New Testament, desires for it, if the Cardinal could have his way, and the conscience and intellect of the world could to-morrow be brought into absolute subjection to the mfdUiblo old man who poses as the ruler of the world When the Cardinal points to the "number of sects, and Bays, "There is the consequence of the absence of authoritative teaching," our answer is that of old First, A e assert that all the great Protestant visible Churches, in their published confessions, are agreed on all the essential truths of the Christian faith, as contained in Scripture, and as embodied in the Catholic creeds I hey coincide as to the headship of Christ over His body, the Church they are agreed as to the standard of faith and practice-the canonical scriptures' of the Old and New Testaments They agree in their views of the guilt and natural depravity of man, of justification by faith in Christ, and of sanctification by the in- dwelling Smart On all vital questions they are one so that in this respect they may be truly said to represent the Church of Christ to the world as " the great institution of unanimity to far as the divisions of Protestantism are useless and trivial, they simply i indicate the faults of human nature, which is not, by reason of Bin and imperfection of moral and mental limitation, infallibly guided though in possession of an infallible Guide, the Spirit of God leading into all the truth as contained in God s word written Secondly, the unjustifiable and sinful divisions among Protestant, are not due to the absence of authoritative teaching in the sense in which the Cardinal lies the expression, because men can now or be made to think in a certain way by a purely external authority A Christian is one who is " God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus " ne is " taught of God " by his Word and Spirit He is morally and mentally free The inward discipline through which he passes is doubtless full of difficulty and danger, but it is the necessary condition of his being a Christian Whereas, it was truly said by the late Mr Gladstone with reference to Rome that no one can become her convert without renouncing his moral and mental freedom, and placing his civil loyalty at the mercy of another " Your correspondent forgets that we Protestant Catholics hold that "the faith " was once for all delivered to the saints " The first sentence which he quotes in proof of the need of his authoritative teaching occurs in St John xx 21, and has nothing to do with " autliontativeitcachiug " christ there teaches those whom He addresses for their comfort that He has the same power as the author The compenaDn is not between two parties sent, but between two parties sending As Augustine says - " We have learnt that the Son is equal to the Father Hero no shows II mself mediator He me and I >on" Moreover, the words were not spoken to the Apostles alone, but to " the eleven " and them that are with them, as a comparison of the parallel passage in St Luke xxiv fish, proves so that, to use the words of Bishop Westcott in his commentary on the passage, " the commission must be regarded as the commission of the Christian society and not 13 that of the Christian ministry " " Go, teach all nations," from St Matt xxviii 19, is properly, " Go, make disciples of all the nations " It, too, was spoken to " the club on disciples Judas was the chair There were twelve of them to represent the twclvo-tnbcdMosiauio-pcopIoof God It was, therefore, spoken to them is representative of the Church, or to the Church in the persons of its representatives And if any power of " author liberty of teaching" be here supposed to be given to the Apostle it yet remains to be proved that Cardinal Moran or the Pope are inspired Apostles, and have any right to appropriate language used of the inspired Apostles to themselves The same observations would apply to the third s stone which is quoted from St Luke x 21", it it implied an inspired authority to teach, which it does not It u 03 said of the severity , bent to and two before' Christ's face into every city whither He Himself would come " (St Luke, x 1) And the seventy" have never been sup posed to have booinnspiied services of devotion Thorup position of the Papacy is that the inspired Apostolate is continued in the Church in the person of the Pope Whereas non-Party Cumbana believe that the Apostles are now present in the Church only in and by their inspired writing It is this authority i five teaching " of which Cardinal Moran makes his boast He condemns the Church of England because it does not pretend to it The li o Churches of Rome and England are, in this matter, in direct antagonism The one, usurping the position of the Saviour, supplies other head of the Church in the person of the Pope, and supersedes the authority of the written word as the rule of faith, the other exalts Christ as the only Head and Saviour of the Church-the one holy Catholic Church, which is His holly and claims for itseJ simply the office of " a witness and keeper of Holy Writ " as the supreme authority in all matters that pertain to the salvation of men (Are xx (coins were- VI ) ft by, then, blame the Anglican Bishops for not doing at the Lambeth Conference what the Church whose servants they are novel

may stand erect us a genuine Anglican and reject the teaching of " the ancient creeds if it were true would point to a lack of discipline But when Cardinal Moran refer to the case of Bishop Colenso be

Trinity and the doctrine of the lucerne lion " I was not aware But if such were the case, and if still greater abuses in the practical working of the Church existed than even those to which the Cardinal has referred, no proof would thereby be afforded that any heretic was " a genuine Anglican Vic OPEN thoughts Of WW If -this 01995 <¡««»M of the Romish historians, Baronius, under the year 012

How exceeding foul was it when sordid and abandoned women ruled at Rome, and false Pontiffs, their lovers, were intruded into the chair of St. Peter " Another eminent writer. Archbishop of Gencbrard of Aix (1537), says, speaking of the ninth and tenth centuries ' This ago has been unfortunate, in so far that during nearly 150 years about 50 Popes have fallen away from the virtues of their predecessors, being apos- takes rather than apostolical " Were these " genuine " " Vico-Christs ?"

Liguon, canonised this century, his works especially recommended by ask, HOT does it happen that there are so many priests in the world and so few holy priests i " Or, take again, the " Dialogues of Catherine of Siena," published in translation in 1866 by the Roman Catholic publishers, Kegan Paul and; Co In the "Peroration," page 235, the following remarks are made " My Church has also become a cuttle shod, for they live in their dishonour like brute beasts They have made my Church into a stable, and he there in the filth of their impurity, for they keep the devils in the Church as a bridegroom his spouse in his own house " Are these " genuine " Papists ? And it is, Sir, the representative of the system with which they are connected who, in your columns, quotes oft-refuted slanders about Cranmer and Luther, and gives " the Protestant Bishop of Bathurst " so much " proof of kindly feeling " But the Romanist Archbishop of Sydney may pref co to have some more modern illustrations of the sweetness and light, the unity and party, and all that is worthy of acceptance by the people of this country under the benign rule of the " Vice-Chief " They can be found in abundance in Purcell's LIIB of Manning " " Pope Pius IV made many attempts to reform the monastic orders in Italy, but they were always frustrated by the obstinate resistance of the great religious houses, especially the Dominicans At the time of the suppression of the religious orders by the revolutionary Government of Italy Pius IX is said to have declared that though he was bound to condemn the suppression of the monasteries in his heart he could not but rejoice, as it was a blessing in disguise On requiring in 1837 of Cardinal Manning whether this reported declaration of Pius by more truohisEminencerrphod thatwhethorsuchanexpres ston of opinion had been actually delivered or not, it truly represented the views of the Pope The Cardinal added that the success of the revolution in Italy was in no small degree due to the laxity of morals in the clergy, secular, and regulars, and to defective education and training in the schools " (Vol I, p dSG, note ) " I (Manning) asked him (Milanese, one of the members of the Circolo Eoniunol why anti-Catholic countries were in advance and Catholic countries in the roar of civilisation He admitted the fact " (Vol III JSS ) Ornguia " All that Rome implies in work and worship " and since evil must needs exist in high places or low, Catholic or non-Catholic, all that Rome in times of turmoil implies as source and centre of ambition and intrigue . ' It is well' as Manning in a letter to his friend at the Vatican, Monsignor Talbot, wrote, that the Protestant world does not know how our work is hindered by domestic strife " (Vol H, p SO) "Domestic strife" at the centre of unity ' No at the " source and centre of ambi- tion and intrigue "I Babylon, not Jerusalem ' Our I fathers of 300 years ago were right ' Again " The removal of Dr Ernngtou by the supreme act of the Pope was a stretch of Papal authority not easily f forgotten on either side It was, in truth, a hat Pope Pius IX called in, ' a coup d'etat of the Lord God (Vol. II , p. 95 ) Again " Thank God the Protestants do not know that half our time and strength is wasted in contests suitor domestics under " (Vol II, p 100 ) Once again, in relation to the last article of Rome's new faith, which "the Lord God " in the Vatican has imposed on his subjects-as Intel) as July 18, 1876 The International Committee met often, and we met weekly to watch and to counteract When they went to Pius we went also It was a running fight" (Vol II,, p. 44 ) It is amidst such scenes of " ambition and intrigue " that the " Vice-Christ," the Lord God " of the Papacy, brings forth the " authority five teaching " of his now re\ orations from the chest of his own breast ' " And what does Cardinal Moran give us UB scriptural warrant for those assumptions of his master, the Pope ? St Luke in, d2, which proves the tenderness of our Lord who, knowing that Simon would thrice deny " Him, while the others would not fall so deeply, but only forsake Him, in morey gave Simon, who would be in special danger, a special assurance, ' ' I pro) ed for thee that thy faith fail not, and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren " The passage, instead of marking out Peter, or rather Simon, for the Apostle does not here appear as a rock-man, strong in Christ, the Rock of Ages, but as weak in himself, weaker than the others" as the pillar of the Church's strength," directs attention to the special danger in which he was in over and above the others of losing his faith in the Lord, and then graciously seeks to save him from it As to the additional expression, " establish thy brethren," the same duty is laid upon all the members of the Church by St Paul, see 1 Ihoss , v , 12-14 The Scriptures do not say there was to be "one fold "-see St John, x , 10 (R-V) And if they did the character of the one fold would correspond to the character of the " one shepherd," the Lord Christ Himself, and would not be a worldly institution, the " centre of ambition and intrigue " thou the Lord said to Peter, " Feed my sheep " But it is equally said of the Presbytery of Asia that " the Holy Ghost made " them " bishops to feed the Church of God which he purchased with his own blood " (Acts, xx 28 The Lord Jesus, so far from marking out Peter as " the pillar of the Church's strength and the centre of its unity," caused Peter to be " grieved because he said unto him the third time, Loveat thou Me " He dealt lovingly with the fallen one, and readmitted him, alter thrice reminding him of his fall, to the place among the Lord's under shepherds which he had forfeited And when he asked about John, the Lord answered, " What is that to thee 9 Follow their MB Would God the Pope would take HUB advice Then, again, Peter is the bedrock of St Matt xvi 18, which, according to St. Augustine signified, "Notice, O Peter, Bill I buds upon (her , but thee, O Pete, will I build upon Me So far as Peter was a Petrova rock man -he was so only because of his faith in tboPetru, the true bed rock, Christ Himself " Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ " (I Cor, m, 11) This is the bedrock on which rests " the foundation of the Apostles and prophets " (Eph n, 20) For, in the Lord Jeho via," and in Him alone, " is an everlasting lock " or " rock of ages " (Is an , 4, R V ) Cardinal Moran says " It is the every-day boast of the Anglican Church that it rejects St Peter's claims and that it was no part with him " I am sorry to say that I can only characterise that statement as absolutely false Lake St Peter's words in his First Epistle, chap v, 1-4, where, as a presbytery, priest, or elder, he exhorts his follow presbyter is to feed the flock of God, not lording it over the charge allotted to them, and compare his teaching with the " coup d'etat of the Lord God," and may we not ask what part the " vice-Christ " has with St Peter ?
