TWO DAYS ABOUT MELBOURNE. III As it is admitted that the old de mortuis, &c;_ is amendable, I trust we may be per- mitted to include dead people's gravestone inscriptions in the category of the improve- able. Such awful rubbish as one meets in graveyards, whether in the old cemetery or the new, is so much waste mate- rial where good material might be made of infinite use. Let me quote two inscriptions which I remember from the old country time I quote from faith, as well known and very ludicrous but waste material. It is as follows, on the architect of the church -- Here lies the body of John Trollop Who caused these stones to roll up Please God to take his soul up And his body shall fill the hole up. The other I met with in the graveyard of Wantge, in Berkshire, or Henley, in Oxfordshire, I forget which, and it seems to me an excellent specimen of stone sermons, for it breathes, if I understand Christianity the very spirit of its best faith and hope'. It is as follows: - As a wayward child my Heavenly father corrected me As a chastened penitent he took me to his bosom. Now for a specimen from the Melbourne Cemetery. It is one selected by a widowed mother, and placed over her husband and child and contains the secret of all the meaning of tombs, stones, flowers, careful silence and all the other signs of love and sorrow which ever and still ever hang out in our graveyards: Oh if it were not for the hope That we one day should re-unite With those lamented ones whose love Made earth a region of delight, In that eternal summer land Where farewell tears no longer flow, How ceaseless our regrets for flowers, O'er which no second spring might glow. Now compare that with another which is as preposterous in its ludicrous doggerel as the preceding one is simple and cheering in its true poetry. The doggerel is on the grave stone of "Henery (sic) M*** who died deeply lamented, aged 36. He was a kind and affectionate husband, a fond and indulgent parent, and was well respected by all his friends." I trust all this is true, and indeed we may accept it on the nil nisi prin- ciple of the amendable maxim aforesaid; but if it be true what a pity that some one of all the poor dead man's friends, who res- pected him so well, did not interfere to save his memory from being made the talking horse of such wretched rubbish as the following: "Long time in pain and sickness lay suffered much I could not stay The lord at last my sufferings eased And took me to his resting place A wife I had that was true and kind By my bed side could always find Both early late both night and day With all her kindness I could not stay Three children dear she had by me Which once was all my joy Two girls that's fair I loved so dear Likewise a charming boy Requiescat in pace By his brother W. M." It may be all very well for " his brother W. M." to say requiescat in pace after that, it the deceased is at all in the habit of niling thc glimpses of the moon in that entry such an inscription would rob him fia; and make the poor ghost hurry back s ti iiUce whence he came without waiting ta Bat tilt morning air. That is, unless a paräaüty for stupid verses was a family «abatí. Talk ol' the infinite long-suffering _¡inaór.to "follow your copy," no matter »M. "tr it may bc!

But I suppose both totik-giri! hut sweet revenges, either ustiiursoliloquisings, or in ingenious na tr aeaus of which stupidity has i» ¡t tin; piquant spice of absolute ^..EWw iwuseose. One of the tomb K*3 ind un it the following:-"Sacred to I3: neaiory of a wife," There was no Ej'- ¡"ir other addition, f suppose the 'n - *is a poet, or rcmancist, or philoso j^f-«amixture of all.
