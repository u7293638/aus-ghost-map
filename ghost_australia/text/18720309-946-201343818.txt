'^'''^T-'BELIGipUSr''''''' ? ? ''?'.. CHURCH OF ENGLAND. DIOCESAN SYNOD. (Abridged from the Mercury.) Wo continue he report of the Bishop 8 address nt the opening of Synod on Satur day last. Irish Church.— To turn to the Church in her work elsowhore. Since we last met, wo have watched with intense sym pathy the progress of the Irish Church in her critical process ot sen-organisation. Her course has been fully worthy of her earlier history, directed as it has been, under the Providence of God, by wise and learned counsels. Her solemn ' declara tion,' drawn up at her great convention, runs in the name oi ' the Archbiphops and Bishops of this, the ancient and Apostolic Church of Ireland, together with the representatives of the clergy and laity.' The principal things declared on tliis very point are so essential, so vital and so instructive to ourselves, isolated as we. are at this end of the world ; in dauger, if we arc rash, of being drawn ' from our moorings by any wind of doc-, trine,' without power of appeal at home, without as yot a' general provincial Synod in Australia, that I will venture to recite them to this Synod. 1\. ' The Church of Ireland doth, as heretofore, accept and unfeignedly believe all the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as given by inspira tion of God, and containing all' things necessary ioi suivuuou , uuu uuiu uuu tinue to profess the faith of Christ as pro fessed by the primitive church.' 2. 'The Church of Ireland will continue to minister the doctrine, and sacraments, and the diciplino of Christ as the Lord hath commanded ; and will maintain inviolate the three orders of Bishops Priests or Presbyters, and DeacoDS in the sacred ministry.' 3. ' The Church of Ireland, as a Eeformed- and Protestant Church, doth hereby reaffirm its constant witness against all those innovations in doctrine and worship, whereby the primitive faith hath been from time to time overlaid and defaced, and which at the Eeformation this Church disown and reject.' 4. 'The Church of Ireland doth receive and ap prove' the Book of Common Prayer and' the Thirty- nine Articles ; and ' will con tinue to use the same, subject to such '? alterations only as may be made therein from time to time by the lawful authority of the Church.' 5. 'The Church of Ireland will muintain communion with the sister Church of England, and with all other Christian Churches agreeing in the principles of this Declaration; and will1 set forward as far as in it lieth quietness, pea'ce, -and lore, among all Christian people.' 6. ' The Church of Ireland, deriving its authority from Christ, , who s tlio Head over all things to the Church,, doth declare that a General Synod of the, Church of Ireland, consisting -of the Archbishops and Bishops, and of repre sentatives of the clergy' and laity, shall have chief legislative power therein, and such administrative power as may be necessary for the Church, and .consistent with its Episcopal constitution.' ': The first statute accordingly relates to the experience of the Irish Church, directed at, this crisis not by the crude or, contra: dictory opinions of uneducated or unstable men, but by the counsels of experienced lawyers and learned divines, cannot but be of the deepest interest to ourselves. Our own .' Constitution Act' proceeds from a pardonable, but now transparent fallacy. It is scarcely doubtful whether -our very designation be not a misnomer, as' members of the Church of England and Ireland in Tasmania.' It is true that English churchmen, finding them selves'in a colony, may be English church men still. ' They may employ an English ordained Presbyter or any. number of Presbyters to minister to them, but when ever the appointment of a Bishop oc curred, though ho receives his right of mission from the Archbishop of Canter bury, that body of English churchmen becomes a separate diocese. It is not a part of the Province of Canterbury ? any more than that of York or of Dublin. It. may own allegiance to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and bind itself to accept all the ordinances and judgments of the Church of England and all interpretations given by English Courts to its ordinances andjudgments,butit can do so only by virtue of voluntary agreement. These orr dinances and judgments cannot be enjoined by English ecclesiastical law. Had such mistakes, on the part of English Crown lawyers, been avoided, the Church in Aus tralia would doubtless, frorh the first, have followed a very different course frbni that which it has. ? A Provincial Synod would have been constituted, framing its own statutes for the control of each diocese, as it sprang into existence, and thus the his tory of the Australian Church would have followed more closely, in its process of .construction, the primitive precedent. It will require great wisdom :and patience now to disentangle the threads, and per haps the chief difficulty will arise from jealousy of interfering with that diocesan independence which has been prema turely established. On this point, the Bishop of Newcastle reminds his Synod of the following passage from Hooker, who says : — ' Such number of churches (or dioceses) being though free within themselves, yet small — common confer ence beforehand might Lave eased them of much after trouble. But further con sultation afterwards, though never so necessary, they could not easily now ad mit, without some fear of derogation from their credit, and, therefore, that which once they had done, they become for ever after resolute to maintain.' I think that many of our statutes might be modified after the model of the Irish Church wjith advantage. I do not doubt that that Church lias benefited greatly by our own colonial experience, and we shall do well to take advantage in turn from its matured counsels. Wo may, for\ example, leam much, from their statutes upon the mode of electing their Bishops for vacant diocoses, and ?. their Presbyters for vacant curo3, as woll as for tho constitution of our Ecclesiastical Court, in aU which particulars experience has shown some radical defects. -. It will bo wall, I take tho occasion to say, that the Synod should indicate more precisely the method which should bo taken for the election of representative inembors of a General Provincial Synod, which probably will be summoned by the Metropolitan within a few months. Tho samo modo of election might also govern the' appoint ment to any vacancy, whonever it occurs, among the members of the Cathedral Chapter. ' The Church of Ireland, separated from her union with the Church of England by, the Legislative Act of Disestablishment, has been wise enough and catholic enough to see her right position. She does not call herself, she does not consider herself. ' the Church of England in Ireland,' but remembering her antiquity and inde pendence, she claims for herself a separate existence, side by side, as a sister. The Australian Church, springing from the Church of England, and deriving her mission more directly from her, stands in the relation of a daughter, and, like a daughter grown up to adult estate, as soon as her appointments aro complete, she must also claim for herself an inde pendent existence. The terms of her com munion with the Mother Church need not, by any means, imply a bondage to all her ordinances and canons, but in common with the Irish, the, Scotch, and the American Episcopal Churches, the terms must ex press a simple agreement to abide by those foundation truths of Apostolic doc trines and Apostolic, orders, which we have received from Apostolic times. Organic. unity with the Mother Church may bo more fully secured iu two ways, which must soon engage tho attention of a General Australian Council. One course will be to require all future Bishops to take a double oath of obedience* an oath to the Archbishop of Canterbury as well as to the Metropolitan. The other course will be to require each Bishop to take the single oath of obedience to the Metropoli tan, while the Metropolitan on his part maybe required to take the oath of obe dience to the Archbishop of Canterbury. My. own views were expressed in a reply to the Bishop of London, now tlie Arch bishop of Canterbury, and were expressed, in the December -No. of the C/iurehJVews. The wise course for a Colonial Church is to follow closely tho rule of the Mother Church until the fuller organisation of a General Provincial Council shall have had power given to it to control the un due independence of each diocese,' and to secure ? organic uuity throughout the whole Australian Church! 'Without such check, imposed, from the earliest age, a solitary 'i diocese would bo in danger of becoming npthing more than a sect, con veniently perhaps free from the conflict of opinions, but liable '..to stagnation in action ; some, inward lake without, indeed a'ripplej but without breadth, or depth, or life. ';'; ' ''?'; ' : '' i . ; ; . ? '; .': ?'. . : Modern Controversy. — Until, therefore, a General Provincial Synod : shall. ; have had time to propound its canons. for the future discipline ofthe Australian Church let us exercise all Christian forbearance, allowing, to each other the same liberty in; disputed points.-which we claim for our selves. Uniformity is possible among lifeless pebbles, but we, as living stones, must look for unity, not uniformity. I am not aware that any change in the mode of conducting divine service has occurred for years past, calculated to offend the congregation of worshippers. Certainly no expression of dissatisfaction or per sonal grievance, on the part of any con gregation, or even any member of a con grogation, has formally, or informally, reached me, and I earnertly hope, how ever, that a ready obedience to the law will, as, far as possible, be paid, wherever the law has been clearly and indisputably laid down. Some men object to the court of final appeal in England, upon the ground of its secular character, . as an in: trusion into the province of the Church, and it may be a question how far its judgments have legal effect here. I do not share the objection to its constitution, inasmuch as its duty is limited to the in terpretation and not the promulgation of ecclesiastical law, although in common with most people, I am glad to know that the constitution of the Judicial Committee of Appeal will soon be greatly amended. The decision ia the case, ' Shepperd v. Purchas,' has pronounced certain novel ties illegal, and whether or. not .such judgment can be enforced upon' tile daughter churches, I am prepared to use all my influence in repressing any effort to introduce them, were there any disposition to do so. On the other hand, when the prohibition extends to customs, which the good sense of English ch»rch mon has never restricted, then the maxim Mos pro' lege will be accepted, and a large hearted charity will at length pre-vcail. The second report of the itoyat Com missioners proposes that any three com. municant parishioners might , appeal against the introduction of novelties in divine service to the Bishop, without, the expense and other evils of a suit, the Bishop would be the natural judge how far such customs were innocent,. a»isue tudines. laudabilei, and how far depar ture from them were expedient. A Bishop of all men should plead for the greatest possible exercise of\ liborty, but hois bound by his office. and by public opinion to restrain suoh liberty .within the limits of the law or the customs of the church. If in our own diocese there havo been so few grounds of complaint;, it should not be forgotten that such infrequency may be due to . tho personal influence and private admonition of the Bishop, by which hojean exercise a far more whole some effect than through the machinery ofalaw; court. The .one disavows, the other provokes opposition.. ' Let us not forget that harmony is quite inconsistent with variety of , sentiment. , Great prin- ( ciples indeed, such as those for which our forefathers laid down their lives, must be protected by those in authority, but in' all details, other motives must have room to play. Established custom, di rersity of taste and sentiment, prejudices of education, will over appeal from the law of Ecclesiastical Courts to the iiigher law of Christian kindness. If any of us, my brethren, ever find a difficulty in tolerating the opinions of other men who we know are as zealous and are influenced by the same love of Christ ns we are, let us bear in mind the Apostolic maxim, ' overcome ? evil with good.' Some divergencies must be ex pected ia every Cburch and age, ?when- ever there is seen increasing activity and zeal among the clergy, and so far they arc, as well as the hot discussions tbat accompany them, healthy signs. But I doubt whether any benefit comes from re ligious controversy at Synodal meetings. Pew have the necessary patience, or logi cal power, to convince their fellow-men, and whatever fails to do this, can but do harm by exciting passion in our own breasts or the breasts of others. If duty calls upon us to state our opinions, let us honestly state them, and leave them to the force of truth and the Spirit's power. As it was in the days of the, prophets and of the Baptist, God will bring gifted men to (she front, whenever He sees the neces sities of His Church shall need them. In making these remarks in the in terests of toleration, I need not repeat to pou that with the ultra-ritualistic move ments at ' home, I have myself no sub stantial sympathy whatever. I'll belie my life-long convictions, if I had. Had, indeed, that movement confined itself to making more prominent tho duty of Holy Communion, or upholding the dignity ,of the office by which ordained men, chosen :-f God as representatives of the people, present their, sacrifices of praises and thanksgiving, or ' the offering up to Christ of the Gentiles,' so far my sym pathy would have gone with it There are functions_ attached to our miuistry and asserted in the Church's office for the ordering of priests, too much lost sight of by some ; but I see no trace of teaching in the Word of God, none in the writings of the early Fathers, none in the formularies of our own Eeformed Church, which invests our ministry with any strictly sacerdotal functions- whatso ever,, as though : the sacrifices we offer were more than memorials of the one Great Sacrifice, ' once for ever, offered,'' although it was seen by St. John* ' as of a lamb newly slain.'' But, though differ ing substantially from this extreme school of churchmen, it would be uncharitable to deny that they have also a favourable side, which gives to theni their jjreal power. We hare promoted the .ordW, and decency of public worship in epnnec-. tion with tlie aesthetic revival of the age and the best instincts of men and NonT conformists have , acknowledged, their obligation. They are men to whose ex ample humanity is indebted for their self forgetting labours, and. for the Christian eourage with -which they have enrolled sisterhoods of charity, and sent, them to face deadly disease, and to minister com fort and solace. to the sick nnd ijyingi. Forthi&Ihonburthera.ond; if any of them have fallen into error or delusions, dero gating from the unchangeable priesthood of Christ, practically, though not pro fessedly, disputing that Scripture, 'tncre' is one mediator between God and man.' Let us trust not 'to judicial courts, nor bitter controversy but to earnest prayer and cal'm discussion; to the power of truth ; to the wise old maxim, that 'what- ever is not of God will come to nought.' Quarrels are apt to run apace, but a loving reconciliation is slow to-follow. A child's hand1 may kindle a flame, but a giant's cannot quench it. As true churchmen,, let us, after the example- of our martyred reformers, go back to those primitive days when sound- ? evangelical truth walked side by side with sound catholic principles. From Clement of Eome, mentioned' by St. Paul, to- St. Augustine, how clearly the- evangelic trumpet sounds forth the doctrine of the blessed Trinity, the atone ment, the life of faith, and tlie work of the Holy Spirit I From Ignatius to Ter tullian, how equally distinct the witness for the Apostolic institution of Episcopacy .and the perpetual obligation ofthe Sacra ments as channels of grace !, Let us not by any action show, or- appear to show, that we are faithless guardians of these truths. _ 'The- secret,' writes a German rationalist, ' of the early progress of Christianity was- the admirable organisa tion of the- primitive Chusrch.'1 But in those days the /.Church tolerated . the widest diversity of thought and! action. 'The Christians of St. Paul,' as Dean Stanley has written, ' knew little- of the Christians- of St. John. There were within the same discipline those who kept holy-days and those wio- did not. There were brethren who participated at the heuthea festivals and brethren who raad'e a conscience of refusing. . And yet they walked by the same- outer- rule, and bowed to the- same discipline.' I believe that no other Church oa earth approaches so nearly to this standard as our own, and that therein lies its. strength. Anathemas and excommunications were then reserved for moral fault3. ' If there be,' adds the same writer, 'a communion in the midst of us now which has had the power of uniting . within its pale more dissimilar elements than any other communion in the world ; if its institutions and its forms of worship be such as, of necessity to afford a refuge to those who shrink from rushing into cither ofthe two ex tremes, between which Christendom is at present divided, then such a communion, however- far -unlike in this or other res pects it may be to the Church ofthe 5th or 15lh century, is at least in this respect not wholly unlike to the Church of the Apostolic age.' ? 1 need not again remind you that there ever haVei.feeen and ever will be, two great 8cnook$tain. the Church, and so long a neither outsteps its proper bounds, they may servo as usoful checks to each other, 'j^hore is much ground of congratulation th^t at home, in spite of great oxcosses, vvlnV-h had distinguished some Churches before ^ they wore condemned as unlawful, and in spite of defiant language expressed subsequently by a few excited men, there seems no disposition to push an advantage to an extrei'n^yi no threat of fresh prose cution so Ion;,1' as the novelties specially objected to wei 'c discontinued. Indeed, the enforcement' of uniformity in detail has ever proved to' be simply impossible. If it was so even in the days of Laud, it is still more so now. In examining tlie state of the Church at home, we should . ever bear in mind that i'n seasons, when mutual forbearance has be'en disturbed, it is important to take into account the difficult position of a Bishop:- If he is required, against his judgment,- to enforce a literal compliance with the rubrics iu one direction, he must, for consis tency's sake, do so in another, and his difficulties are greatly intjrea'sed when, in times of excitement, he appea's, but often in vai-n, to reason and goocf feeling. So long as \yp all preach Christ and Him crucified, and from the cross eyolre the doctrines of human deprava tion, the atonement, justification by faiths in His merits, the sanctifying influences of the- Holy Spirit, and each fundamental' evangelic truth ; so long as we abide by Apostolic order and discipline, we- may well afford to exercise toleration iu mat ters of subordinate importance. ' ? And suffer mo to add that a greater - evil still awaits us. A disputing clergy forfeits the confidence and. respect of the cduca ted laity. We have only to read our high-class periodicals to learn their views. They see outsidc_ gigantic evils making rapid headway ; inside, the stan dard-bearers disputing, about what ? As to the best mode of resisting selfish greed, ' immorality, intemperance, and infidelity among the people? The correction of sloth, indifference, or inconsistency among the ministers of religion ? No,, but as to the meaning of a difficult passage, or the posture of a priest. It is a pity that we lay ourselves open to the reflection that tho principles of toleration should be bet- ter understood by the laity than by our selves, and that their growth has always been more slow in religious than in secu lar matters. That we may know our right position, let us- look out broadly into- the world, and see- how changed are the tac tics of tho enemy, how subtle and deadly the engines of attack. I ask you, are we ' the commissioned officers of Christ,' arming ourselves with suitable weapons- for the onslaught ? We say that- we take our stand upon the all- sufficiency of the Holy Scripture. But men : are now asking us what is Holy Scripture, and when' was it compiled??' ' You tell us,' they say, ' that St.Mark and 'St. Barnabus- were both apostles, nephew and uncle in* the flesh ; that both have left authentic. works behind them,, why is one canonical and the other not ?.' Again, these enquirers- ask, ' Why was the Epistle to the Hebrews admitted into the Holy Volume when its very author ship is so much disputed?' And if, ' from such questions) we take refuge-to the authority of the Apostolic Church anel. the promise of a world- wide presence of. Christ to guide us unto all truth, then we are asked, where- are the limits of that promise, and where is- the definition of in spiration to be found ? These are ques tions which a few years- ago,, it were fia politic to suggest, as tending to excite doubts in minds unprepared to admit them. But they are questions which the restlessness of the age will not allow us to- escape. We have- seen them during the past year openly agitated here, amongst ourselves. And supposing these questions, often put by honest enquirers, to have been, as we think, sufficiently answered, look out again and tell me whether we are satisfied to see the ad vances of modern infidelity clad in still more hostile armour, unprepared to meet it? Among the more educated classes, we may watch the growth of that specious form of infidelity called ' positivism,' which is the refuge of some minds-driven from the distraction of speculative truths, the disputations of theology, un til it accepts no creed , beyond the known laws and phenomena of science. ' Secu larism,' of which we hear so much is but another and popular form of ' positivism.' It tells us that man's business is with the sœculium, i.e., the life here below.. That at least is certain ; all' else is uncertain. We are told that the Christian views of Pro vidence, personal responsibility, much more the distinctive doctrines of Revela tion, are antiquated and obstructive to tho progress of society. Addresses are largely advertised in England and elsewhere, and published by men, who weekHy lecture to- crowds whom we fail to attract to our churches. I quote from Dr. Hessey's appeal to the Christian, Knowledge Society a specimen extract from the chief apostle of popular secu larism. ' Nature acts with fearful uni formity, stern as fate, absolute as tyranny, merciless as death ; too vast to promise, too inexorable to propitiate ; it has no ear for prayer, no heart for sympathy, no arm to save. These are hopeless doctrines, as they themselves confess, but they arc propagated with a terrible earnestness, and I ask is this the time for the camp- of Christ's faithful ones to be distracted by party feuds and antiquated animosities ? Let us rather learn to ' judge ourselves, that we be not judged of the Lord' for the loss of His sheep, unwarned, let our watchward still be ' ejae fratres, pergamus simul,' and live not only on terms of love among ourselves, but of respect for those who enrol themselves; under other denom inations, as brethren in Christ, whose co operation we may yet need against the common foe. Let us try to see how this can be done, and that too without abetting the sin of schism, or sacrificing our loyalty to our own Church. Turning our eye inwards, do we not see that every age has its' own; peculiar ten- ?dency-P) Can '*v6 not! discern itlio! aign'of our own times ? Can wo dispassionately say that the tendency, on the whole, is towaiKds sacerdotal ' despotism, which points to Ronio and infallability ? Is it not 'rather towards Geneva and spiritual ?anarchy, trampling down all fences which ?separate the historic Church of England from innumerable sections, many' repre- senting great though one-sided truths, others denying the atonement of our blessed Lord, and rejecting tho Sacra ments ? For one I have never faltered in my allegiance to that aiiostolie and re formed Church, within which I was born and baptised. I believe in her apostolic orders, in her heavenly mission, and her high destiny, but while I can do nothing that even seems to imply that I regard our divisions as harmless, I have learnt.to honor all true and conscientious men, by , whatever name they are known. For any real and organic union I would sacra fico all that is not fundamental. I would abandon all symbols of later date that tend to keep Christian men apart, and wo'uld.. cling to those earlier ones of the undivided Church, which, happily are witnesses to historic facts rather, than scholastic sub tloties. I mean the Apostles' .and the Nicene Creed. German Catholicism— To stop' short of 'tlie'- true principles of corporate union, 'arid ; to - substitute, express ions of kindly .regard ', or' occasional pnssages of brotherly iellowhhip,' would be largely to compromise ourselves in relation to the great movement of liberal' Catholicism in Germany. I hail' \vitli ' sivtisV faction the adoption, on 'the' part of that nai' tionn.1 movement, of the very fundamental . principle that. underlies the 'English arid' the. Irish and every other -branch of thcf'.Anglb^! Saxon Church. As a' witness against the ltp man doctrine of development, it is asserted in the second article of the,programme drawn' up at Munich, ' a dogma, to bo valid; ;must. bem accordance; with-Holy Writ and, the old traditions of the Church, such as !they. ? have i been conveyed to us inrthe writings , of .the recognised Fathers and the decrees '.of., the - Church. (i.e., of the, undivided Church);','-. ? In' the! third article of thersame programme we read — ' If these reforms are carried out, and i the roadjof, science, and progressive Christian' culture is steadily pursued, we expect that' the tirne .will eorao when -,. an ^understanding will be effected with the various Protestant Churches as well ; as'-,.with; ..thei Episcopal Churches of England and America.' All this points ton possibhrand glorious.'.fiiture in which the far.sprcad English Church may,' in'the Providence of God, have yet to. sus tain a past, a future, , which ? -'.would b'e' ren- . dered much less uncertnin.r'aud- much. more. glorious, if we had not to lament': our-iiiter-. ual divisions and. outward schisms. -As mem bers of a Reformed Church, we cannot but feel a deep interest in; this Alt-catholic move-, ment.

In conclusion, allow me to express the hope that no words uttered in the warmth of debate, calculated to irritate or to wound, will be allowed to bring discredit upon our; Church or .our Synodical institution. For. 16 centuries after Christ no questions were brought before the Synods for the purposes o£ eager debate.or for divisions into majorities ? and minorities. Tho object was to obtain publieoonsent, and to deliver authoritative utterance to measures already discussed and approved. The temper and the necessities of the age bave changed all this, .and' the fifth s ueuiury ueuunoc necessarily tarnish an exact model to the 19tta. But if subjects must, be discussed which excite controversy, let us at least sliovr ourselves worthy of the work which the age has given to us, the object of which should be. the increase of mutual forbearance during ; the succeeding year, mutual nespeet, and more active and loving co-operatiai!. Men who live detaehed from their fellow-meo, and have learnt to Jove the (truth which they have received through certain formulas, -aue naturally apt to identify .the truth itself with their mode of stating it. The object of Synodical meetings should tend to counteract this narrowness of. our own private views and intolerance of other „ inerf'fl. Let us bear in mind- that we live in .an age of shaken and unsettled opinions. The discoveries of science and a speculative restlessness are the cause, which it is the office of the Church to control and direct, not impugn or slight. If the Church, great as she has been in the ages past, and great as she is still, shall ever lose her opportu-' nity, and therefore her power, it will arise from her, own disunion and disorganisation, which will give an advantage to the forces of schism and uubelief, which no other power could furnish. Let us bear in mind the strict and solemn tribunal before which we all soon must stand. In the light' which beams from that awful tribunal, how- trivial will appear our transitory controversies upon profoundeat mysteries, how pnerile our ques tions .of ephemeral ceremonies ! How all im portant our faithfulness in bringing sinners to repentance and wandering prodigals , to their fathew ; and our brdtherjy ^kindness one towards another 1 If we expect to. live in Heaven and to attain to higher ' and ' yet higher degrees of love there, let us avoid all bitterness and .wrath, and for . this : end, let us pray for the gift of the Holy : Spirit.
