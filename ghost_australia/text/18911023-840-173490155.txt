Ghosts on the Track. " Talking abont ghosts on railroad traoks," eaid tho englnoer, aa he mopped his brow with a pieoe of dry wasto, " I believe in them." " Why bo i" " Well, I killed a man onoe— that is, my engine killed him— and I can't get rid of him." " Hannts yon, doos he ?" " Not exactly. Bat I oan't got him out of my memory. It happened on the Old Bruns- wiok and Western Railroad. I had taken a yonng man— a tramp— on the engine with me. He was a northern man who had been south for his health, and had got broke in Florida. He was going home to die, he said, and asked me to give him a lift. I was sorry for him, and granted his request with pleasure. " The fellow had oonBumptlon, and the jolt ing of the engine resulted ia a hemorrhage. I wasn't noticing tho man, whan I heard a shriek, and then— out of tho oab he tnmhlod, and then nnder the engine I I heard the wheels pass ovor him and grind his bonoa to powder 1 " After that, whenever we wonld reaoh that spot, I seemed to hear a Bhrlok, and thon the grinding of the wheels on human bones. I couldn't dispel the illusion to save my life. On one ooousion the fireman swore that he saw the man piokingnp his boneB along tho traok; bat, of oourse, there wbb nothing ia that. But for six years afterwards, as long aa I remained on the road, I imagined I could hoar the Bhriek, and feel tho engine jump when we got to that plaoe. I suppose it was all imagination, bnt I oonldn't help it aU the same." — Atalanta Comiitulion.
