THE DECLARATION OF WAR. -* TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-When has the leader of the Opposition gained by his tactics in the first engagement after his note of a general blockade of Parliamentary business was sounded i Not " the Premier's crown," nor the ghost of a chance of " wearing it," but about as much glory as was won by thatrolobralodmonaroh who, "withallhisinon, marched up the hill, and then marched down again a battle of squirt, in which nobody was killed, and nobody hurt The valour and patriotic ardour of the commander of the Opposition and his combined forces were conspicuously exhibited by beating a hasty retreat after their repulse, rather than face the enemy find take their defeat like men such a crushing discomfiture as that experienced by the Opposition last night proves that the sensible und conscientious members of the Assembly are anxious to proceed with the urgent business at the country, and that they are not to he coerced or deterred by the Opposition threats which are being constantly hurled at them Mr Dibbs claims credit for assisting the Government to pass one or two of its late measures surely no credit is due to him or his party for assisting to do the work which they have by their constituents been elected to perform, and is therefore their duty.
