PORTFOLIO. TP.IxIT S.YnDAy.-There is and will ever he th' threefold aspect of the Almizhty God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The belief in God the Father mizht have degenerated into Pantheism and the abstraction of philosophy but for Christ the Son, wh., came not only to tell ns that God was onr Father (a man mizht have to!d os that). bat to prcclaim the perfect brother hood of man, the self-.acrificinz love of God, and to inspire na with the love and devo tion of children. This He did when he came on earth. But even this mitht have passed into history, and have been lost in the mists that gather rooud the distant past, but for the promise of the Spirit, that ever present, ever-vnidinz Spirit Who can understand the Spirit of Gol or search out His way=! Assuredly not he who looks on them with downward eye and regards them as a law, as a tendency, as non-existing except in phrase. To under stand these we must cultivate the humble the reverent spirit, the eve that is directed tothe realities of thins, not to their par sing forms. Does anyone think that the truths of this day do not cooncern him, are not practicale There is r.othing,that so concerns him, nothing that is sooner trans latable into immediate action. To believe in God the Father is an onf.iling source of patience, content, and diginity. Who is he that shall harm usn To believe in Gold the Son is to be a soldier in the one great army of Christ, p!edgdl to a life of charity and toil, for othes--it is to have an ideal before our eyes that draws our eyes from all lower aims; and to believe in God the Holy Ghost is to know that God's power is with as, and in as, and that we need never de spair. May we then all our life long join in the hymn of praise, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which wast, and art, and art to come !-Rer. J. Al. Wilson, JlMt. A.
