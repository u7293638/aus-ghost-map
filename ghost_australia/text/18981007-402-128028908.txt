FIRE AND SNAKES. An incident of the recent forest fires in the Pine creek region is related by Sam Campbell, who works in the woods near Blackwell's. Sam was one of the crew of men sent out to " back fire " (fight fire with fire), and he declares that their experience was most thrilling. While selling fire to a thicket that crowned a rocky ridge, he and his crew were startled to find themselves suddenly in the midst of a lot of rattlesnakes. The forest fire was advancing on the side of the hill at a rapid rate. Its whistl- ing, whirring sound as it devoured the hemlock tops was terrific, and the men were bent on building a line of fire to start toward it, hoping that when the two lines met the fury of the flames would be subdued tor lack of material on which to feed. It was while thus employed that they encountered the snakes. The ground seemed to be literally alive with rattlers, the reptiles crawling in the direction of a rocky bluff not more than one hundred yards distant. The men were all equipped with high-topped leather boots and paid little heed to the snakes, stepping on them as though they were but harmless old 6sicks. Campbell says that the rattling made by the reptiles could be heard above the roar of the distant flames. The " backfire " made by the men caught dozens of crawlers and they were burned to death. Camp- bell said he watched several of the rattlers " give up the ghost." When the flames ad- vanced so close that the snakes saw further es- cape was impossible they would coil up in a heap, darting their heads angrily at the tongues of flame, then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them, a moment later to be devoured.
