AN EXAMPLE FOR MODERN STATESMEN. Sir Charles Lilley, Chief Justice of Queensland, in a letter opposing Imperial Federation and alluding to the Imperial Federation League of England, writes : â€” "Instead of directing their ability, energy, and knowledge of affairs to the work of humanity and statesmanship, which lies before them and at their doors, these gentlemen have started in pur suit of so-called imperial federation, a phantom, with less of substance behind it than Pepper's famous ghost. Let these men reflect upon a pre cedent furnished by one of the greatest rulers of men, the ruler of the Christian world in his day. It is written of him that when he (Gregory the Great) was told one day that a solitary unknown beggar had been found dead from starvation in the streets of Rome, he excom municated himself for having allowed such a thing to happen in a city under his rule. For days he abstained from Communion, shut ting himself up in his silent cell, to make atone ment by tears and penance for his sin of omission towards that poor starveling. But this Christian prince did not believe in 'the survival of the fittest,' or the ' unrestricted play of competi tion,' or in any of the fine- spun theories and phrases of the gospel of selfishness as rules of human life, used so often to soothe men's consciences for allowing their fellow-men, women, and children to suffer and even to perish of hunger. He was not afraid of pauperizing the people, as we are. Are they not in vast numbers already pauperized almost beyond redemption ? To your work in your own country then, and leave us to avert, if it may be, the evils of starvation here. Leave us to try to keep away the hunger-fiend from the children of our fair land and to rear a strong, brave, and powerful nation having an ample range of duty in this new sphere of action, where we may keep the peace and follow industry and the arts, and perfect freedom and the noblest works of our race."
