PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The annual meeting of the Presbytery of South Australia was held in the class- room of Flinders-street Church, on Tuesday, May 1; the Rev. P. Maclaren, Moderator, presiding. There were present Messrs. Gordon, Lyall, W. Davidson, J. Henderson, MacBean, J. Davidson, Mitchell, J. F. Henderson, and Angus, minis- ters; with Messrs. Murray, Lyon, Macfarlane, McCoull, Anderson, Gooding, and Matthew, Elders. The meeting was opened by the usual devotional exercises, after which the minutes of last meetings •were read and sustained. Commissions in favor of Messrs. J. F. McCoull and P. Miller as Representative Elders bom the congregations of Chalmers Church and Mount Pleasant respectively were read and sustained. An apology for absence was received from Mr. Law. KODEBATOB'S ASDBBBS. Fathers and Brethren—Even were it usual to commence such an address as this by indis criminate and defiant laudation of ourselves or out system, it would be, I think, doe tofaithfnl ness end truth to depart from the custom at Che present time. Happily there is no such custom among us, our common wish being that our sphere of labor should be soberly considered; our action therein eerionsly, and as in the sight of God, reviewed ; and oar apparatus and equip ment brought under our notice, that any requi site amendments may be made. We claim to be a constituent portion of the Church of Christ on earth. We exist for the purpose of extending and developing on earth the rule of flic King of the kingdom of heaven. That that kingdom may come, Chat ourselves and others may be brought into, and kept in its righteous* ness, pesoe, and joy in the Holy -Ghost, and thus His will be done on earth as it is in heaven, is the sole purpose and justification of our onion as a Church. It is not lawful for us to forget this, it is not safe; we shall die, as we deserve to die, if we aim at any meaner ends. Our sphere of labor is one of the noblest and most promising on the face of the earth. Upon us, in our measure, depends the future of what will surely become at no distant date a great nation. It is still in its childhood, but with such wisdom on the whole, and with such gcod fortune has its growth been fostered, that. scarcely any province of this empire, or of any other, can equal it. Our soil yields abundantly all precious things, our climate is excellent, our laws are just and fair, and our social tone is high; this country needs but God's blessing upon Christ's Gospel to give it unexampled felicity. To be instrumental in conveying to South Australia this crowning gift of God is our high and honorable calling. The consideration of our past action, as a church, in this vocation, is not flattering. Influential men, Presbyterians by ancestry and education, of a race distin guished for enterprise and energy, are to be found everywhere in the province. It argues either strange apathy on their part, or on ours, that our congregations are so few in number and so slowly increasing. We see, with sell rebuke, that other denominations are increasing the number of their congregations much more quickly than we are doing. We do not grudge them their success; God speed them more and more in the work which they and we have in common; but the comparison of our activity with theirs ought to stir us to a generous emu lation. How comes it that the Presbyterian Church is so nearly standing still, while the population is rapidly increasing, and other denomination? increasing in proportion. We cannot imapm that the hindrance is in our form of church government. Theoretically, that is perfect. Almortall the improvements made by other denominations of bite years have been approximations to our system; and such imitation is the most effective praise. The vexy latest outcry for ecclesiastical change, one from a very unexpected quarter, the English Ritualists, is for something like early Presby- terianism; John Knox might have written the programme of it. What can be more clearly reasonable than our fundamental principle, as laid down in the Second Book of Discipline V This, namely (chap, ii), " The whole policy of the Church consisteth in three things, viz.—in doctrine, discipline, and distribution. With doctrine is annexed the ad ministration of the sacraments" (both being Divine instruction—the one visible, the other audible), "and, according to the parts of this division, ariseth a threefold sort of officers in the Church, viz., of ministers or preachers, elders or governors, and deacons or distributors; and all these may be called by a general word— Ministers of the Church." Upon this basis, at different times, have been built structures' con siderably differing; at one time superinten dents, with functions resembling the episcopal, were admitted; and at a later period the dea con's office was disused, elders or managers per fonnujg the duties of it; but the' principle stands unchallenged forever. One office which was of great benefit to the early Reformed Church of Scotland we have unfortunately (i-rrpped—that of the Header. The place he tiled was taken after the second Reformation, and especially after the Westminster Assembly, by the Probationer. The place of the proba tioner was thus legalised by the Directory far Public Worship. " Such as intend the Ministry may occasionally both read the word and exer cise their gifts in preaching in the congregation, if allowed by the Presbytery thereunto." I trust it is not going beyond my commission when I humbly suggest that the ancient and honorable office of reader, or local preacher, might be with advantage revived among us, as eminently suited to our thinly-populated dis tricts. It seems to be a tiling we need, the absence of which has hindered us in our mis sion. Were God to grant, in answer to our prayer, a goodly number of zealous and devout readers, much unused talent would be use fully employed, and much good might be done. The able periodical of the Episcopal Church here has shown recently the value of the lay readers in their communion, and all can see the immense service local preachers render to the Wesleyans, Congregationalists, and Baptists. The danger to which the Standard points, of congregations resting satisfied with lay readers, when a little effort would secure the costlier but preferable services of a settled minister, we should not much fear. Our peopleare not so readily satisfied. Our doubt is whether their judgments would not be too severe; whether they would cot actually discourage the efforts of men whose fifts and goodwill would pass muster elsewhere, though not adequately filling the place of folly educated pastors. Certainly, however, we must do something towards the supply of ordinances in places where a settled ministry cannot yet be maintained. It has been suggested that our " cast-iron rigidity" has been our bane. There may be some truth in this, but the fault is not in our system, which is sufficiently elastic, but in ourselves. Oar people are not fond of change. This conservatism has its advantages. Any one who desires to ascertain the doctrines or aims of the Keformation will by common suffrage most readily find them among us. Of this conservatism we are not ashamed; we do not invite, though we can put up with change. she use of instrumental music in the service of God is an example of this. Our churches were the hist to admit it; and they resisted it till they could resist no longer. We neither apolo gise for their conservatism in resisting, nor for their common senfe in yielding; each was right enough in its place. Sunday schools were in like manner resisted for a time; and hymns also. We do not blush at the remembrance of either conflict; there was much to be said on both sides, and the consequences of the changes have not been all gain. The patrons of Sunday schools may be astonished to hear that their introduction has not been pure gain ; but when we remember that fireside instruction has almost died out, we could almost wish parents would make conscience of teaching their own children instead of sending them to the Sunday schools. As it is, parental instruction being now unlikely, we are not only content j but thank ful for Sunday-schools. For change for mere chaEging's sake we have no liking. For the outcry for liberty of opinion we have as little. We are glad that a potent voice like Mr. Glad- stone's has been recently put forth in behalf of deference to authority, especially the authority of wise and devout men of past days, whose judgments have stood many a severe criticism, and survived all. We cay that men have not liberty to think about religion, bnt it is their AvU) to think; as having to answer to God for their opinions. God alone is lord of the oon- Ecience; but He is lord of the conscience oE . man. An honest man may come to think other* wise than be has been taught, but be ought not to lift his face with the swagger of indolent and insolent mutiny, so common with the ignorant and unstable, crying that he is /recto think, but will Eerionsly and earnestly .protest that he is bound to think as he does. We desire freedom to hear what God saith, and to do what He bids; and we have tiiat freedom to the full, as citizens and as Christians. As Christian teachers we nave that liberty too, but not without limits. It must not be forgotten that the freedom of the pnfeil. unrestrained, would mean the oppres sion of the people; and wa no more wish the people to be bound to listen to alltiie way ward speculations of a minister than we wish the preacher to be subjected to die dictation of a crotchety people. Both are most happy when a firm and equitable law and an intelligible and acceptable form of doctrine bind both for their common benefit. We ate never again likely to be crushed by too much law or tormented by a theological inquisition. We are far more likely to sicken and slay ourselves by wantonness of lawless licence. The statistics of ?ie Ohurch,as compared with past years, show progress, but not what with our system we might have looked for. Our changes bare not bean many. One important charge has had to resign its mini?ter, that he might do his Master service in the University. We might regret the change for the sake of the congregation, but they and we must acquiesce in his choice of a sphere of such wide influence and of such vast impor tance to the colony. We trust that God is* giving the people a minister such as they maj reasonably expect, and that Win M?muiF?g m make Hie new minister successful. Another of our ministers, who supplied two charges, bss relinquished one of them to devote his atten tion to the other. Two of our congregations are at present enjoying the efficient services of esteemed brethren from £he OongregKtJonaliste. A fine field has been entered, and anew congre gation formed in this city, and by God's kind providence supplied with a minister acceptable and experienced. The grand obstacle to our progress is the difficulty of obtaining ministers. The Churches at home, from which we have been wont to draw out supplies, have themselves the same difficulty, and are no longer able to help us as we could wish. We are certainly not yet able to provide ministers i for onrselves by the establishment of a theolo ! gical hall. We may therefore heartily thank God for the establishment of Union College, which holds out the only hope of supplying out wants. On its efficiency and prosperity much depends, and it chums urgently the prayers of us all, and such prompt and liberal aid as our people can give. Contrary to all • our anticipa tions, the current session has opened with a larger attendance of students than it has had since the establishment of the University. Mr. Angas's generous offer of £1,000 conditional on a like sum being contributed by the united de nominations we earnestly hope will be met in a kindred ppirit by our congregations and our wealthier members. Having put forth onr own strength, we shall tl'en be able to appeal to Him who has engaged to send a bountiful bless ing upon our efforts. In conclusion, we can praise God for cur' brotherly love. Amidst all regrets for our fhortcomings, surely we have in this a token for good. Henceforth, as hitherto, may our Presbytery be as a city at unity within itself. It is my privilege to nominate as my successor the Rev. Robert Mitchell, for whom I crave your loving respect. The Moderator's proposal having received the support of the Presbytery, Mr. Mitchell took the chair, and delivered an address expressive of the honor which had been conferred upon him, and his confidence in the sympathy and support of his brethren. A cordial vote of thanks to the retiring Moderator for his valuable address was carried on the motion of Mr. W. DAVIDSON, seconded by Mr. MACBEAN. GENERAL BUSINESS. Mr. Lyall tendered his resignation of the office of Clerk, but was induced to withdraw it on the urgent representation of several members of Presbytery. Mr. W. Davidson reported on his visit to Koolunga, Yacka, and other places in the Northern Areas in February last. He had preached to good congregations, and had been gratified by the interest in the cause manifested by the people. Mr. Mitchell was appointed to visit the dis trict during the present quarter. Mr. Lyall reported that the Rev. A. Scales had commenced his duties at Belalie and James- town on the first Sunday of March. NORTH ADELAIDE CHURCH. Mr. Henderson reported that he had taken steps in conjunction with Mr. Jarvie for the formation of the church at North Adelaide. After preaching a sermon he had delivered an address upon the principles of the Church, had then taken the names of 17 persons desirous of being united, and by solemn prayer formed them into a Church under the Presbytery, and given them suitable exhortations. On the fol lowing Sabbath the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was observed, when 28 m??""^ were seated at the Lord's Table. Mr. Henderson also reported receipt of letter from Mr. Jarvie, which he laid upon the table, with reference to the church at Korth Adelaide, and to his intended visit to Melbourne, seeking to have the pulpit supplied. Mr. MACLAREN proposed—"That this letter, be held in retentis, and that Messrs. J. Davidson, J. Henderson, and McCoull be appointed a Com mittee to act as they may think necessary in the meantime." The motion was seconded by Mr. Gordon and carried. MR. DAVIDSON, OF WALLAROO. The resignation of Mr. W. Davidson, of Wallaroo, which had been received at a former meeting of Presbytery, was now taken into con-' sideration. The Commissioners appointed by the congre gation of Wallaroo, Messrs. YOUNG and DUNCAN, then addressed the {Court, declaring the attach ment of the people to Mr. Davidson and their earnest desire that he should continue among, them. Mr. Davidson thereupon declared that he submitted the matter to the Presbytery for their advice. Various members of Presbytery expressed their regard for Mr. Davidson, and their hope that he would still continue his labors at Wal- laroo, after which Mr. Davidson consented to act according to their wishes. MOUNT BARKER SESSION. Mr. Macbean reported that in accordance with the appointment of Presbytery, he had preached to the Mount Barker Church, the pastorate of which was vacant. He at the same time coun selled the people to unite heartily together and sustain tiie cause there. Mr. LYON made a statement with respect to the present position of matters, and sought the continued sympathy and assistance of the Presbytery. Mr. J. Hen- derson was appointed moderator of the session of Mount Barker, and it was agreed by Pres bytery to supply the pulpit once a month, naif of the expense connected with the same to be borne by the Home Mission Fund. Mr. Hender- son to arrange for the supplies. FINANCt?i. The Treasurer's accounts duly audited were presented, showing for the Presbytery Fund— Beceipts, £57 15s. lOd.; expenditure, £61145. 9d.; leaving a balance due to the Treasurer of For the Home Mission Fund—Beceipts, £118 13s. 5d.; disbursements, £33 18s. Bd.; leaving a balance in hand of £32 14s. 9d. Professor Davidson reported that the Aged and Infirm Minister's Fund had now reached £906, and with the interest added would amount to about £950. ST. ANDREW'S SOCIETY. Professor Davidson laid upon the table rules, &c;,of the St. Andrew's Society of South Aus- tralia, and urged its claims upon the considera tion of the brethren.
