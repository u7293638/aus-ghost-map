THE UPPFR YARRA ELECTION. â€¢ To the Ratepayers and Councillors of the Upper Yarra Shire. THE GHOST'S TIP. " Keep on the way you are doing, and the place that knows them now will shortly know them no more for ever." The election has proved true to the ''Tip." "I would take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds." Now that the election is over aud the president appointed, one that knows the ropes and the spirit exorcised, let nothing occur that will cause it again to visit the " glimpses of the moon, making we fools of nature," but settle down to business. Too much praise cannot be given to the ratepayers for the example they have at the expense of their personal feelings, and for the buoy they have moored on the sand bank of partiality showing the safe channel to take. Let no sordid motives blunt the needle of the compass, and keep a steady hand on the wheel, looking at pro bono publico flying at the main, so as to make the haven of tlie golden rule and popularity, "do unto others as you would they should do unto you.'" Bury the hatchet, rearing no cairn to mark the spot, and around the Council table smoke the calumet of peace, displaying the spirit of peace and forbear and all will be well, and if I may be pardoned for presuming to throw out a few hints as to the course to pursue, a good many of the roads have been hurriedly and perhaps crudely made through a desire to do as much as possible with the means at command, and now as there is a breathing time as far as working on the roads is concerned. The Couucil, not a Work's Committee, but the Council as a whole should inspect these roads and ascertain, for now is the time in wet weather what will be required to be done to put them in a fair state for traffic, and after arriving at the cost of such work let the balance go to open up roads likely to be of the most benefit to the whole district; the parts of the main road still undone to receive first attention. I am, &c.;, JOHN EWART. Launching Place, 19th August.
