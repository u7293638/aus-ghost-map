WHEN SENTRIES DOZE. The hour of 4 a.m. has something mysterious about it. Cocks crow, people on the brink of death give up the ghost, everyone who is asleep sleeps sounder, and even the watchful sentry can't always keep his eyes open. At this hour people are in their weakest state, and, if life is just on the flicker, it is not- surprising that it goes out. Many a man's life has been saved by a spoonful of brandy and ammonia administered just when the clock strikes four. The period ,of deepest sleep varies from three o'clock to five. An hour or two after going to bed you sleep very soundly ; then your slumber grows gradually lighter, and it is easy enough to waken you at one or two o'clock. But when four o'clock comes you are in such a state of somnolence that you would take no notice of the end of the world. Military men are well aware of this curious fact, and they often make sudden assaults on camps Or cities- between three and five, for they kpow that at' that time the most wideawake sentry is liable to doze. Strangely, at the corresponding time in the afternoon . most people feel a bit done up. Whether it is due to the electrical condition of the atmos phere, or to the position of the sun, no one knows. But it is a fact that the nervous system, brain, and lungs are most vigorous from about ten or eleven o'clock (night and morning) to twelve or one, and at their lowest ebb between three and five.
