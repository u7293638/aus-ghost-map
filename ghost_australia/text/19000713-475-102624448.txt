SHORT STORlf The Marbles Tripped the Lady. 'Hullo! What do I seep Two boys groping in the mud— playing marbles? in the roadP Not my boys, surely P Not ^fter the lecture I read them yesterday upon the danger — to pedestrians — of street marble playing P And yet! — No! . . .] Tea ! I feel positive they are a couple of ?»y scholars.

'Inclina tion bids me walk the other way, Beeing nothing; but duty says 'Catch the de linquents red-handed.' Dear, dear! Such .a simple-minded game as marbles is! But I have warned the boys against it. I have written it down a capital offence, a public danger, and ? ' Mr. Baplingham sighed deeply. It was a pastime in which he himself— half a century back — had excelled mightily. It was a pastime — hush ! never let the Vol untary School boys get wibd of it — in which Mr. Baplingham, aged sixty, stern, , unbending schoolmaster, still indulged, in the privacy of his study. 'Such a fascinating game!' repeated Mr. Baplingham, as he strode away to the execution of his duty. 'And fifty Veam aim T woji f.li* vwianf nnlnnf Still* —he straightened his scholarly back and stiffened his drooping shoulders — 'since I have ordered the. game to be numbered with the crimes X must collar the 'Criminals/ It was at an exciting moment that Mr. Baplingham strode to the execution of his duty. Dan Shawley had won so per sistently that Harry Tuft was fingering his last marble. With the greatest care — and a moderate amount of luck — the loser realised that he might yet regain the cherished store of marbles that jingled in Dan's pocket, and in the boy's face was mirrored all the concentrated judgment he was bringing into play over this final BhO Knuckles to ground, marble pofred fin is er and thumb, little Tuft gazed anxiously Mid nervously at the two 'marbles that, ?- ij inp at an easy angle and distance from inch other, might well be worn in one shot. Mr. Raplingham's eyes took in the -ituation at a glance as he came up, un noticed. Sis Jips parted as if to speak, tut after remaining in that attitude for a .minute they automatically closed again. '*i''O interest in the game had seized him. Ilia eyes were devouring the situation .fci-eedily. ? Suddenly he spoke. ' Lower !' he said, in a voice of tense excitement. 'Knuckles lower, boy. Ton will Dover hit it if yen cock your fingers Tip like that.' The schoolmaster's voice struck the as tonished boys like a swish from a birch. With one accord they sprang to their feet. Put the movement did not detract from Air. Raplingham's interest in the game.

In the privacy of his study where, with the Marbles confiscated during lessons, the schoolmaster was wont to talk and laugh to himself while he played with an imaginary opponent, there was never any Mr. Baplingham stood upright^ con scious of the indignity of the proceeding. Then he became aware of an approaching vehicle (the Battleys' victoria) and hot blood suffused his cheeks. If the Battleys {Major Battley, the Chief Constable, was a manager of the Voluntary School)' had jseen him on one knee playing marbles in the road with— -H He walked rapidly onward, conscious that the Battleys' victoria had pulled up in the vicinity of his degradation.

'I shall be obliged to leave the school and; in some far-away town, to seek a livelihood at the \- .age of sixty.'* H. Major Battley was choleric with rags as, next day he hurried into the schoolroom. . 'I've said' it before, sir, bat -without effect I. now repeat it, and look to you, Mr. Baplingham, to put the order into execution. Marble playing in the public thoroughfare must cease at onoei' ex ^claimed the Chief Constable. ?1 will see to it, 5foi}(Sr Bittley,' softly sponded the schoolmaster. v '-.,..?

'Old Raplingham daren't give us away,* . chuckled Tuft 'Shut up)' naidDitn. ?Old Bap's shlvoring in bis shoes. Doesn't he look miserable. I say, Dan, « ? ' * Shut up 1' And Dan gave his friend an «ffeotfv oke in the ribs. *Jtf j limply disgraceful,' continued the major, 'that a lady cannot step from her carriage in the public road without trip ping over marbleB left about by a set of yonng scally wags.' ' I trust the lady was not injured,' said Mr. Raplingham, who would have given a month's salary to know whether his par ticipation in the game of marbles was sus pected by the major. ? ?Nothing beyond bruises,' testily re plied the Chief Constable, 'but ladies don't like tumbling about in the road, and this is the third complaint I've received from ladies who have slipped and fallen over these young monkeys' playthings. This time the victim was one of my own family- The lady was getting out of the carriage to pick a bunch of berries-at the roadBide ! she gathered a bunch of bruises instead.' He glared across .at the shivering |boy, and added : ' I'd give the young rips who left the marbless on the footpath a cool licking if I could lay hands on them. But thejittle cowards ran away when they saw the mis chief they had done, and they haven't the courage to own up now.' The schoolmaster released a broath of glad relief. The boys hod run away; therefore it was probable that his own share in the game was unsuspected. He glanced at Dan Shawley. Would he con fess P ' I'll birch the first boy the police catch marble playing in the public highway !' out of school. . Mr. Baplingham watched him, and the ghost of b smile illumined bis thin lips and sparkled faintly through his glasses— the smile of danger averted. He was so absorbed that hetfid not see Dan Shawley slip out through a back classroom, from which he hastened down a back thorough fare thet slid gently down into the High Street . Then he stopped and gazed anxiously in all directions. But the major was not in sight. 'He can't have got out of sight if he came this way,* commented Dan, 'yet he isn't in sight anyway; therefore he didn't come this road; therefore he went across the fields, which is the only other way.' Euclid had not been dunned into Dan Shawley's head for nothing. He turned on his his heal and retracing his steps, dashed past the school and gained the fields. Half a mile distant the majer was quietly pursuing his way towards the Battleys' residence, the smoke from a cigar leaving the trail of a miniature ex press train. Dan hopped across the stile and started in pursuit. The country was flat as a pancake and well-nigh naked of vegetation. In the distance clustered a few weather-beaten, passed the ricks ; the major followed the winding footpath ; Dan Shawley struck a bee-line across the sodden fields, hoping to intercept the major near the cluster. Thus it came about that Dan saw the man concealed behind the largest of the hayricks, while the major remained ignor ant of the fellow's presence. More than that, Dan saw that thy fellow in hiding held a rifle, and, more suggestive still, was taking an occasional sight at the Chief Constable's approaching figure, using a corner of the rick that sheltered him from view as a gun rest. Dan's heart began to bump at the dis covery. The man's motive was obviously to shoot Major Battley as soon as that gallant officer should present a good enough target. Dan's mouth opened to omit a yell of warning ; but it snapped to again without emitting the yell. Then it was that Dan, who could run, began to do it ; and as he ran, his eyes, wild-looking and feverish, twitched to and fro in the lines of sight that respectively covered the chief constable and hiB wait ing assailant. Twice within the next two minutes Major Battley stood still, obviously hesitating between continuing his present route and returning to the town, and on each occasion the man behind the hay rick took carefnl aim, while Dan Shawley's throat filled with a ready shout of warning. But the major continued his way, and Dan gained distance at each moment of indecision. The ground was soft after the autumn floods; but for that the man, intent upon his victim, must have heard the flying steps. Yet he didn't ; and to Dan it was just a question whether the major would pass the hayrick— and get shot — before he himself could get within touch of the shooter. The first of the cluster of .hayricks shut the major from the boy's eyes. Dan shovelled on the coal of determination until his voice broke in each resounding sobs that only the intensely absorbing nature of the deed he was about to commit could have prevented them from reaching the desperado's ears. - , But the latter was peering intentlyV round the rick, and hiB ears were only for the major's firm footsteps on the gravel footway. Suddenly, between the ricks, the major caught a glimpse of tue flying schoolboy, and muv veiling, stood still. That -was tne desperado's --jip Tf.uuit/. Twenty yards or so separated (he auooter and the man to be shot. The desperado ran his eye along the sightless barrel. ?Now, my gallant major !' he muttered, * I've eot yer 1 Xjast rear tod trot me six months' hard for poacbin'— with violence. That was your day; this is — -*?-'.: ' The man with, the^gun. felt something at his ankleB, and with thoughts of a stray dog, kicked backward with a vigorous foot. Then he tried to turn round and attack his adversary from the front ; but Dan Shawley dragged the second ankle so vigorously from under the maa'e boij that the latter fell face forward to the ground with the helpless thwack of a man taken unawares. ' Crack !' cried the rifle, for the fellow's hand bad been rendy on tbe trigger. III. ' If you please, sir, it was me who was playing marbles in the road when Mrs. Mrs. Battly fell over yesterday afternoon.' Major Battley, who had followed Dan at the first glance of his fleeting figure through the hayricks, and come up to him in time to see the boy's plucky assault upon the poacher (who, self-shot through the arm, never attempted to rise) stared at the diminutive lad for a whole minute before he broke into a loud peal of laughter. ' Whafs that got to do with this villain who was evidently waiting to shoot me as I passed P' he asked. 'You're a queer little chap.* 'I saw you in school this morning, sir.' 'And I. remember that I saw you. If you were the boy I was asking for, why didn't you speak up and .admit your guiltr 'Because—' Dan's eyes sought the ground, then wandered up the hayrick and down again. ' Because I didn't want to— then, sir.' ' But why not P* persisted the major, possessing himself of the gun and esti mating his prisoner's wound with the cool ness of a man who had seen some rough service. ' Why not P' ' I — I'd rather not tell you, sir.' 1 A secretF 'If it is, nobody asked m« to keep it,' asserted Dan.' ' Then you won't tell me.' ' I'd rather not, sir.' . ' But eee how curious you leave me !' 'I'd take it as a favour, sir, if you wouldn't ask me/ added Dan. 'Well,' said the major, 'you stand con victed of having thrown a lady on her face through your carelessness in rolling marbles about tbe public thoroughfares, but on my honour I can't scold you foi it, seeing what you've just done for me.' And the major allowed the matter to drop, but later on, when the poacher had been secured in the town hospital, and the major was turning over the events of the day, he received a note frem Mr. Baplingham, confessing his share in the game of marbles that had ended so awk wardly for Mrs. Battley. And the Chief Constable understood. 'Plucky little kid,' he exclaimed; 'he wouldn't give hie schoolmaster away. I must eee that youngster again. He saved my life. If the incident had happened in front of the enemy he would have got the V.C. He ought to be a soldier/ To Mr. Baplingham the major wrote : 'Thanks for your explanation. Let the incident drop. I saw nothing — I shall say nothing. I suffer from a boyish weak ness myself — top-spinning on the quiet.'
