How many times she asked henself that question she could not have told. Her heart seeniedready-toburst with grief for the terrible titi&ery; threatening so many happy homes. Alas for fathers and mothers whom the morrow might behold bowed down with sorrow? Alas for husbands and wives! ,Shg was crossing the bed pf one of the m^ny abandoned channels- .of the impebupps fountain stream/ a5rocky , pathway strewn with the spoils of bygone freshets, ^here^even then water was rippling past, token of the torrent's surplus force. She faltered, smitten by a new and awful thought: What if Tom—Tom, her husband,who-was not to come home for two days more, Tom who had started one in an altpgether different directiou—should, have cut short Jiis excursion, or,' with Jiis party, driven home by the contitraed rains,, somehow wandered to one of the tipper stations and entered the train there % Where was her vaunted physical strength now? What^was she after allf-'trot a "Weak, - wretched jwoman, withittrembling limbs,, every ^inuscle clogged5^ ^yMfchis great iorror' that had taken possession of her, a fierce pain gripping at her heart, some thing rising in her throat which suffocated ;her,.her eyes, blinded with; babyish -tears % Thank Heaven ! her brain kept clear and true to its purpose urging on the lagging body. -On, on -OEerlittle hillocks, acrosslevel stretches of sand, down new ravines, she ran. Once she cat her foot cruelly upon a sharp 8fcone,and remembered,forthe first time, that she had on her slippers. r, Wi£h - all the rest i of -her senses, Rafted, her hearing appeared to have become preternaturally sharp. She seemed. clatter of the approaching train twelve miles away. The throb, throb, throb of the engine kept pace with her beating heart. She even seemed to see the engineer as he laid his hand on tbe escape-valre, ready to give the iron, monster voice as it neared. the little mountain town ; then the wild shriek of the escaping steam, the clangour of the bell, the puff, pnff, as the tram slackened speed the clatter of the brakes, the jangle of the couplings. Would she never reach the little red-station bouse, now plainly in sight at the- end of the sinooth gravelled road ? She was passing the post office, when the people idly gazed at her. What matter! . If only there were a horse and trap in sight, to help her on her way! On the station platform more loun gers, Jim among them, rolling a quid of tobacco in his cheek, and talk ing about the state of tbe weather and the prospects of the growing crops. They all looked upon her as a mad woman as she ran past them. The station master was in his office talking with a gentleman who had come down frcm the mountains, and was waiting to take the train for the city. • It has rained all the week/ he was. saying. ' You think it rains here in tbe valley, but, great guns, you should be up inthesaountains in a rain storm.. Sheets gnd. sheets of it, blizzards of. $leet am} tiaitj' and the wind blowing a bjimcane. We broke up camp ^esterfay, : 'I took astraight line down jfiere. The rest crossed'the hills to the station above. They'll be down by the louro'clock train.' Yoice and speaker were familiar to the woman who stood in the doorway, both hands pressed to her panting, 'breast. The words came only too distinctly to her quickened senses. Then her premonitions were true, and Tom—-rTorn .was in the fated train. Again,her body reeled, but. her steady brain saved tier. . 'Stop the train! The bridge is gone!' she cried. --'j Both men looked up, startled at tbe ; words. With the prompt movement of a. man trained to ..obey, orders, the station-master leaped to his instrument; slower to comprehend, the gentleman he was -conversing j?rth« came ^orward ; the Hook of ainazemeht on bis face, as he viewed tbe singular'apparition in tbe-'doorWay, giving place to- amused indulgence as he recogpised~-the~ speaker. What an eccentric, impetu ous girl Kate Mitchell always was, and what a/.flife1 fishe :ini|st; ^ead Tom! Middleton, thought he. 4 This is quite an unexpected pleasure, Mrs. Middleton,' he isaidvi smiling. She wav gesture. There was "a brief silence. The operator listened, . inteatly. -wlth,-. liisJ. head resting on his hand. Kate Middleton remained etauding^m the doorway* ber hands^claspedpher /face blanched! vitji drea<y and aljl her po^l absorbed?.ih4istahin£.

The operator arose from his chair. •Just, in time; The 'train was starting °ouib of the station^ but they stopped ber>' *~ edjinui .back?witji a/ single K«i#e ^SliddleUiu clu tdhned at " the 1 doorway. For the first time in tier life her head^ gave_ a way. ^Sji^wasJ again on the'Stfa^ng^eamor^knia -fctiPj limb was cracking, breaking,- going down. She felt the water on her face, and opened her eyes, to find herself in I a chair, Jack Spencer supporting her j bead, and the station-master poiiring ice-cold water over her.. . t • "'She'll beright ma minute,' said Jack, cheerfully. - 'Now, Mrs. Middle ton, with yourpertnission I'll see.you home.' "/ ^'-i She borrowed a hatand cloak from the station-master's wife. Jim brought up, the hpraesr JacjR Spebcer handed iier*"into' ths! carriage with'; grave courtesy, and they drove home. She had little to say on the drive homeward, although jack Spencer was attentive and talkative, and tried as hard as a ntan could to show his appreciation of her Brave deed..' She did not even in vite him to come in when she reached her own door. 'Neither honor nor| praise awaited Kate in her own home. Bridget scolded her and put her to bed, and declared' that she "wud surely catch her death a-cold, and she desarved It well." ; 'She had,her reward^ however. Late that night, when the children were asleep and Bridget had relaxed guard, Kate escaped from bed, and, donning a shawl, lajd herself down upon the lounge before .the fire to enjoy scanning the daily paper. She started up as she heard ;a step ontside the door; another moment and Tom. was before her, looking very solemn, like a newly materialised ghost. 'Tom '-she cried, sharply, and then she seemed to cower before him ; but the horror of the afternoon < Tom, her hnsl>and, might^have been one of that grisly &rong;:ftf ^mangled, crashed, dead, and dying phantoms of the vision still torturing her brain. ' Oh ! you ought not; you should never do such a thing,' she said. After all she had nerves, and they had been solely tried that day. ' W hat do you mean ?' gravely de manded Tom. This was, indeed, a peculiar greeting. ;. • . ' Kate,' said he, seating himself on the sofa and drawing her down beside him, 'you will speak differently when yon know how near I was to not coming home at all; I have travelled twelve miles on borceb.ack over, a rough mountain, road to get heriT'to-nigbl. We were just starting out of Prescita when we were notified that the bridge three miles below there—six miles above -here, Kate—had been carried away.' ' How did you find out V Kate was herself again. There was a little twinkle in her eye but her lip trembled. ' As to that,' replied Tom, * reports are somewhat vague. But all accounts agree it was a woman. And she did wonderful things. The bridge keeper's wife, I believe. Floated down the stream on a trfee, somebody said, started, all dripping, for the station, and got there in a very short time. "Sot fk minute to spare. If it hadn't been for her !■—oh, it was a marvellous feat everybody says so.' * But how very—unwomanlike !' paid Kate, in a shocked voice, stooping to pick up something from the floor. ' Unwomanlike !'. cried Tom. 'I tell you Kate, ihat was something worth while. Very different from your lawn-tennis practice. Whpa i woman puts her strength to such a use!—and such a strain as it must have been, by .Jove' Why, Kate, I doubt if yon could do so much as to walk to town and back. But when a woman saves two or three hundred lives at one stroke—My goodness, Kate! what have you beeD doing to your foot V For Mrs. Middleton had , uncpn sciously pushed the wounded foot into sight, and the load of bandages, piled upon it, was enough to strike terror to the beholder. - * I—I took a little 'walk to-day. But don't let an talk about that, Tom. I'm sorry I seemed qiieer and cold when you came in. I wasn't feeling well, and you looked so strangely. It made ine shiver.' It was useless to try to put Tom off in this way. He was already on his; knees beside her cutting her threads and , undoing cloths, in spite of her protests, until lie disclosed a little foot purple with bruises, ! and with an ugly gaping cut on one side. ,'lTo wonder you are not yourself to-night. A little walk ! I should say so. Kate, wha-t have you been up J;o now V * T had on my slippers,'confessed the culprit ' and there wasn't time to ;chang|<them. Let it.alone, Tom ; it'll : be all aiglit "to-morrow.' ' A little walk V persisted Tom. ' My, gracious.
