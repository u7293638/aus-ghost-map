Humorous Column. ] Took the Little Man's Fart. A sailor whose ship had been paid off at Sydney took the tram for Waterloo. Before he entered the tram he armed himself with a bottle of rum, so that when he arrived at his destination he was very mixed. ' Waterloo V shouted the conductor. * All right, never mind about the ' water,' let's have some more ram,' replied Jack. At last they 'emptied' Jack oat of the carriage. Slouching along towards Botany, he saw two men busily engaged in sawing a block ot wood with a cross cut aaw in a wood and coal yard. One man was very tall and the other very Bhort. After looking at them for some time through half-closed eyes Jack entered the yard, and, without any warning, knocked the tall man down. * What's that for ?" shouted the injured man. 'Look yere,' said Jack, ' I've seed yon a-trying to take that saw away from the little 'un for ever so long. Just you let him have it, will yer ? If yer don't, I'll blind yer with science. Remember, Fm thB bloke wot fought the ghost in the tin hut and came out withont a scratch-d'ye see, long 'un.'
