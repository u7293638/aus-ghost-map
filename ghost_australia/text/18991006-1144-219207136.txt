The sheep stealing case at Laura on Monday lsfc, created a deal of interest. For years past the proprietors of Wirrab- ara Station have missed sheep, but all their, efforts to catch the thief have been fruitless. From the fact that thirty-five sheep were missed during three months from one paddock it is. supposed that dur ing the past twenty years thousands have been stolen. A ghost story is to hand from the Clyde in the shape of a narrative published by the Glasgow Weekly-. Mail, which has a steam yacht for its locale. A month or two ago, we read, the yacht in question was anchored in Rothesay Bay, when one of the hands was drowned at that cold eerie hour known as the V. turn o'; the tide." The skipper, and another man joined the yacht next day. Just a night or . so after they joined the vessel they were startled, by hearing seven distinct knocks in, the forecastle.

The noise respmbled a poker being hit on a grate and. thp. sound; of bare feet hurrying along the deck, overhead.
