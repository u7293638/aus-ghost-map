He was known to her only as Amosiah—Ziab he was m.pst frequently oalled. His brain bad been " cracked," so bis neighbors said, by reading blood-curdling literotme. He hod porsisteutly annoyed Kate during her daily rambles, and sbehad always repelled him witb unoonoealed dis gust. A thousand appalling thoughts oocarred to the poor girl. That she was in the power of. a madman sbo fully realisod. Wbatt was ho going lo do with her ? Would bo really burn her as he intimated? Oh, if she bad not troubled bcreslf about the phantom Ship 1 Surely tbo old Palatine did psrtend ovil, and tbat to others beside tho Block Islanders.' Whore were Phil Dayton and his friends ?

Great drops of perspiration wars standing on Kate's forehead. She rolled ber head from side to oide in agony. Tba rubbing of the handkerchief against the bench loosened it, and before Zian was aware of wluit hie viotini was doin?, Rhe gave one loud, terrific soream and then another. The maniac sprang toward her. ??- ?? I oould knock yon on the head and keep you alill," he eaid "as he lightened the hand kerchief witb cruel foroe, " but I don't want to stun you. I Wont yoa to feel Ihe fire. It will purify your bouM and make you fit to join mc tomorrow. S?ou will bo burnt to a cinder before they mies you, nnd beforo day downs I shall be dead too." Kate tried again to loosen the handkerchief, but aioh bad does bis work well, ond sho could scream no mere. The manioo lit a matoh, and, to Kate's in describable terror, applied it to tba -paper, whioh soon began to ignite the wood. In another instant her clothing would catch: Sho gave up all hope of life, and tried to frame in her hear! the prayer which ber poor, bound lips wero wholly unable to utter. Bui help was near. At this very moment a terrible pounding resounded on the door, and almost immediately the rotten old tim bers gave way. Ziah sprang forward like a wild heart, bnt three n>hlenc psiro of arms caught him and held him fast, whila I'hilip Dayton kicked away the firo nod cut the.lords that so cruelly bound poor Kale. Then Bhs fainted, and Philip bore her tenderly out of the burning hut, while his friends bound the madman and led him to a plaoo of safety. All that night Koto lay prostrated, but when her rollioking brotnor lien oame down on the boat from Newport next day xho was well enough to listen to his oulogisros on Phil's bravery, not without a tell-tale blush, however.
