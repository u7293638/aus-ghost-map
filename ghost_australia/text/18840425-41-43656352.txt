THE EXPOSURE AT VIENNA TO THE EDITOR. Sir — Referring to the letters by 'C. Reimers' and 'Alpha' on this subject will you allow me to say a few words. Ghosts, fatririts. arid miracles have oulv been seen bv children, by simpletons, and superstitionists, or by knaves. As often as such supersensible macness has been sifted to the bottom it sank into nothingness— Vienna, &c.; All that has been fabled about the existence of a superior world, or world of spirits, or the presence of departed spirits, is an absurdity, and never did a dead man return. The1 transcendental in any bhape or form is abso lutely inconceivable to the human mind, and every attempt to understand it has always led to inextricable confusion. Matter and mjnd (or. spirit) depend one upon the other with such necessity that the one cannot be without the other. Matter is the bearer of all mcnfal power— of all human and earthly greatness. What about a life which is not bound to matter?— a. spirit (or .mint] ) without brains— a life without chance and issue— a personality without body? Who can imagine such? Man cannot think beyond himself, arid therefore are all his imaginations about the suiieroatnral nothing but preposterous fancies and vague phantoms; i think I do cot wrong spiritualists if 1 maintain that all their deductions are nothing but the unsound vebsuriijgs of an unsound mind. ; I am, Sir, &c;, A GERMAN.
