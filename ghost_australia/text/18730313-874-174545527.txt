Theatre Royal. ' ME. FAIRCLOUGH'S Hamlet is A puzzle. You don't exactly like it, and yet you cannot dislike it. It's one of the completest mixtures of very good and radically bad we have ever seen. Iu some few points he equals and even excels Mr. MONTGOMERY, but the general run of bis performance is so labored aud he works so bard that it becomes unpleasant to watch him. Then again he has to fight against personal appearance. He does not give one the idea of Hamlet. He looks too resolute, and his fii m cut mouth does not give one the faintest- idea that he would be swayed by thoughts beyond the reaches of his soul. To us his acting aud facial expressions give the idea of a man who would after hearing the ghost, at once seek the King, and cut his throat, even iu a church. There is not the faintest tinge of irresolution about Mr. FAIRCLOUGH'S impersonation of Hamlet, and consequently, on the whole he has failed to give us the character of the melancholy Prince. That Mr. FAIRCLOUGB JS a good actor nobody will deny, and we predict that be will iu some other linfe shine with all the brilliancy of a star. Mrs. STEELE'S Queen, aud Mr. HARWOOD'S Ghost —aud few people imagine how difficult a part Mr. HAUWOOD plays—were admirable.
