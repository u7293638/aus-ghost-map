"BOY rOLITIC[AN" AT LAHBTON. "Joe" Lesina addressed a large crowd from Mrs. Ralph'e balcony last night in Lambton. He dilated at length on the Single-tax, Federation, and Freetrade, and received a patient hearing for a considerable time. When the questions were called for, he received a perfect deluge, enough to satisfy any glutton, and, after answering a considerable number, the heat became too oppressive, and the meeting broke up in con fusion. The candidate, on retiring, invited his questioners to wait, and he would come down and answer them. He remarked during his speech that he knew hle hadn't a ghost of a show of being returned for the county.
