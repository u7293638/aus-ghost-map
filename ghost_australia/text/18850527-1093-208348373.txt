UNTIL DEATH. Slake me no vows of constancy, dear friend, To love me thousa I die thy whole life long, And love no other till thy days shall end ; Kay, it. were rash and wrong-. If thou "anst love another, he it eo ; I would reach out of my quiet grave To hind thy heart if it should wish to go— Low shall not be a tlave. Sfy placid ghost, I trust, will walk terene Iii*clearer light thin gilds these earthly moras— Above the jealousies and envies keen W hich sow tiiis life with thorns Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy cavess, If after death my soul should linger here ; Ken's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence warm and near. Ii would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wen. waiting all thy life in woe For my poor sake. What love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To woman's grace—a tardy recompense ; But speak them while 1 live.' Heap not the heavy marble 011 my head. To shut- away the sunshine and the dew ; Let small blooms grow there, and the grasses wave, And raindrops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I; but, trust ine, thou canst neverfind One who will iove and serve thee, night and day, With a more single mind. Forget me when I die. The violets Above my rest will -blossom just as blue, Kor miss thy tears. Ev'n Nature's self forgets ; But while I live be true. Atha (Bohemian Club).
