W. A. EXHIBITION COMMISSION. . -.-« THE closing meeting of the Western Australian Commission, appointed in con- nection with the Indian and Colonial Ex- hibition was held on Friday week in the Law and Parliamentary Library, His Honour the Chief Justice presiding. There were also present the Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lauds, Mr. S.H. Parker, Mr. Marmion, Mr. Gugeri, Mr. Clayton Mason and the Hon. Secretary (Mr. Nicolay). The Hon. Secretary in- formed the Commission that] the ex- ? penses in the colony in connection with the W.A. Court had been about £1,500.' He did not know what the expenses in - London had been. He had nothing to report as he had received no communi- cations from the Executive Commissioner in London. An amusing discussion fol- lowed on the question whether they, us a Commission, existed. The «Chief Justice said that they were appointed to act until the Exhibition closed, and as it was now closed they were simply ghosts ; they had no legal existence. They bad never received any official intimation of the opening or closing of the 'Exhibition, nor, indeed, any communication with re- gard to it while it was iii progress. Finally, it Was decided that a letter shonld be sent to Hb Excellency the Governor to the effect that the Commis- sion having been appointed to act until the closing of the Exhibition, and haying received no official information as to the opening or closing of the Exhibition, the members were not in a position to make any report upon the results of their labours, and of those ot the representat- ives «>f the colony in London. Votes of thanks were then passed to the chairman, to the chairmen of the sub- committees, to the district-committees, and to Mr. Thomson for his services before leaving for London, and to the Bev. Mr. Nicolay for his services as secretary since the de- parture of Mr. Thomson, and for the invaluable services he had given in the scientific department. Tho Commission then dissolved.
