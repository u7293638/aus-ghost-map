The fall is no doubt owing to the fact that tho reef has inado larger and poorer in quality.

A wonk tone has been tho marl; of tho week, uml on many days only the ghost of business was visible, but with all this there has boon nothing like panic. Go the contrary, there has been a steady feel- j ing in all the better stocks, both alluvial and quartz, and tho general drift uf tho market has J only been seen in small casings here and there, i The most serious drop was from 87s. fid. to 82s. j in Band Albion nlwut the middle of tho week, but | the stock subsequently recovered to 85s., 84s. 6d. j This drop was caused by the reduced averhgo of j tho previous week no doubt, but as a 3s. dividend is announced, in accordance with my report a week or two ago of its probability, and a season of larger profits is thus inaugurated, the stock will naturally bo studied, so long at least as no mine changes coino to lessen confidence in tho future. The No. 7 shaft ia now down 760 feet, and will be most likely deepened to over 900 feet, wliilst it is proposed to put in a drivo cast from the south drivo in No. 10 level, No. 10 shaft, so as to intersect the vertical line of descent iu No. 7 shaft, the drive going under the cross course in the country there. The opening of tho No. 11 level iu No. 10 shaft will bo another new departure of interest, aud if the lode shawms well there the company's pros pects will be immensely improved, and not only that, but a new confidence will be given in all the ventures on thu line. Tho half year's work just, done is certainly highly encouraging, for, as the chairman put it at the meeting last week, it shows a profit of 58 per ceut. on tho receipts lor that term, the new dividend of 3s. making a total of 23s. per share since last June. But even this shows that present market rales aro at two years' purchase, and cannot bear much inflation, apart from fresh incentives from the mine itself. The week's output is good, 405J oz. for 430 tons, besides 17 oz. 13 dwt. from the tributers, tho company's own retorting showing tho excellent average of within 1 .dwt. and a fraction of au ounce to tho ton. It is a wonder that with so good a yield, so good a report for the past half year and with the lode opening out larger in tho No. 10 level north, the stock has not better inquiry. The chive in question is rising in bottom, as if a now shoot of stone is coming in. The No. 11 chamber is ready for commencing tho west crosscut to intersect tho lode there. In the No. 10 drive south, 29, feot extension has been done for the week, and the lode continues good and carries good gold. A contract has been lot for the erection of tho pumping engine at the No. 9 shaft, .in the Band and Barton south drive, No. 7 level, through thp crosscour.se, tho lode is 2 feet wide, and is making wider in the uorth drive, with a good stream of water from the face. No. 6 level south is bored through winze to the rise from No. 7, and faces will be opened there at once, Tho lode in No. 1 level is much broken up. The Koki- noor has sunk 6 feet for the week, and is now down 890 feet. In Ballarat East there is noth ing fresh of much interest, but most of the producing mines are in us good fettle as usual, and the Llanberris has had one or two belter hauls of gold lately from tbe Indicator strike. Buninyong Estate has 175 oz. from 310 tons, which ia a fairly satisfactory avcrago, but the Stock has uo ousinosK nor declared buyers, though holders havo eased to 25s. The shaft; is down 34 feet below tbe 550 feet level, Ftoping as usual. Buninyong United is cutting chamber at tho 233 feet level, and driving east will be gono on with there. Ou the Gordon line Parker's United had a jump from 4s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. at the beginning of Ibo week, owing lo a better report from tho mine, and the stock had daily business, but full back to 5g. by Friday, rallying again to 5s. 3d., and easing at the close to 4s. 3d., 4s. 6d. The mino li full of stone, but none of tbo tests at tho battery have been very satisfactory for some time past, and until a difforeut tale is told on that convincing ground the stock is unlikely to advance much in public confidence. The Egerton and Black Horse prospects remain as they wore, and neither stock can with much propriety bo said to be marketable just now. In alluvial stocks Loue Hand- has been the strongest of the busy market ones, for it has had almost daily business and sold from £7 9s. to £7 16s. to £7 14s. Lord HaiTy and Lough- liu having but little uotice, and only just keep ing their place at the oponing of tho week. Tho Berry group has been on the whole steady, but No. i is the only one that had much business. Madame Berry bad none, nor any declared buy- ors. holders caring from £20 to£19 10s., without leading to exchanges. There was a little bitch at the No. 2 shaft during the Week, but it was soon all right again, aud the operations there, as also in the wash faces, arc goingon satisfacto rily so far. Tho Loue Hand output keeps well up, like that m the Madame Berry, and it wilt not be materially affected by tho fact that in a month's time or so the gutter works at No. 1 will be done, the more as by that time it is pro bable the company will have got new gutter ground in tho north side of tho roiue. In the prospecting drivo there the wash is 4 feet be low the drive bottom, tho drivo in fact running over a coarse bonldory wash showing a littlo gold, and \h npnureutly running along tho edge of tho gutter. A crosscut cast is to be put hi to test the countrv, the ex pectation being that tho deep ground is close at hand, that it is a large watercourse, aud that it is, as traversing a belt of lodes, rich in golden debris. The Lord Harry water trouble is not over. The water is draining from one side, but keeping strong on another, though tho pumps havo managed so far to keep it down at 8 strokes per minute. But this has strained tbe'maehiuery to tbe'utwost, a flue of one boiler is burnt out iu tho Ardent tight, and tho company lias notified the contribut ing com panies that the subsidy must be increased from £70 to £120 a week, or all operations at tho mine will bo stopped. A reply is required by the fith prox. This is of course quite enough to keep Lord Harry stock weak, tho only wonder indeed being that it has kept 60 firm as it has. Lougblin have not the expected deep ground in nand yet, but neither tho parent nor the pup has suffered much iu tho market. Bony No. 1 is sinkiug well, and is down 524 feet, but in very hard country and with rather heavy water. Hepburn stocks have been very little inquired for, and Consols hare ea«od to sales at 20s. The Hepburn Eatuto shaft is still in rock, tho shaft and plunger chamber having been sunk 5 feet for tho week : total depth, 143 feet; water light. The xcavaHons for the ungino house will probably bo ready for the concrete by the end of the week. The Snicaton Company report no gold this week. The No. 4 riso is up, and the chamber is being constructed, so that it is expected that wash will bo struck again in a few days. The Australasian lino is without material change, the output at tho parent mine keeping up luirly well, though the stock has eased from sales at 77s. to sales tmd sellers 74s. Daviess Junction are a little in jured for again, and Extended Nofth is pro gressing well. North aro weak ; sellers 25s. and no bnsiuess. Bell's Freehold had a nico show of gold at tho Corner during tho week — an excellent heavy sample — but the stock has no mention. Bute, at Clunos, in not improving its yield, aud has had mention on one duy only, when sales wore made at 13s. >d. Dowling Forest No. 1 has extended tho north reef drive 50 feet for tho week to tho north-east, in easy country. A bore put np went through at 26 feet, with a good stream of water, showing that the wash is bearing north. Another boro will ho put up during this week. The Golden Belt is not puddling yot. The main level has been extended 25 feet, aud a jump up of 24 feet, from which a prospecting drivo will be started forthwith. The No. 3 Diamond Drill bore is down 48 foot in hard, jointy rock. Golden Belt Ex tended has struck and crossed tho old main drive again with tho crosscut, and a low feet havo been driven beyond into dipping ground with & thickening wash. The main level has boon extended 50 feet beyond the rise, and will be extended 50 feet more before rising again. The North Drive has been extended 77 feet for the week. Dividends reported this week: — Lone Hand 10s.; Band and Albion, 3s.; Aus tralasian, 4s.; fiargeant, Cd.; Reform, 6d-; Home Paddock, 6d. Total £12,392 5s. The market remains unchanged, and only a few stocks were dealt in to-day. A considerable advance was experienced iu Davies's Freehold, but still no shares were disposed of. Buyers offered 20s. 6d., while sellers asked 23s. Hep burn Consols hod business at 21s. and 20s, and Hepburn Estate at 13s. 6d. and 13s. 9d. Lord Harry were quitted at 57s. 6d. and 58s.

Tito outlook liero during tho past week has been of an encouraging kind, our stocks becom ing more permanent, and havo from day to day risen into favor. This applies moro especially j to tho Queen's Birthday line, prospects along ; which have very materially improved both north and south of tbo pioneer claim. Tho prices ruling for Qnccn's Birthday for some time past havo been low, a parcel having beon quitted at 21s. These. havo, however, gono up to 2Gs., and are firmly bold for 30m. This price, again will be improved in the event of the reef being found at the lower levol at which they have started, and aro now making good progreKP. Another week will in all probability provo this. In the meantime' the battery iB kept going an near full time as possible, the plates of which had tho nmnlgam taken from them this morning, aud again yield ing- tho handsome return of 610 oz. The Egyptian, as predicted last week, has greatly increased its yield, tho result of thu cleaning up on Friday giving 227 02, 8. dwt. of retorted gold. As a consequer.ee of this tho shares are again in great demand, and havo risen from 12m. and 14k. lo 16s. 6d. and 17s. The No. 1 South has gradually and surely risen in favor evon day during the week, having started at 6s. and Cs. 6d.: can find buyers to-day at 103., 10s. 6d. and Us.. This result is owing to the greatly improved stone found going south, the appearance of which is like another saddle for mation, the reef widening out to 15 inches, and dipping slightly both north and south. The Extended South is inflking goon progress with its uroericuts, having driven each ul>out 50 feet in rather hard country, requiring blnating, which is, however, compensated for in not requiring timber. Tho yield from tbo Aroona has again been somowhat disappoint ing, tho gold brought in thin morning for the I fortnight weighing 84 oz. 7 dwt., as against 97 oz. for the previous one. 15-head of stamps have also beon ufc work, nnd a better yield was expected. The stock consequently declined, from 4b. to 5s., being the maximum prices ob taining. Iu addition to tho quartz crushed, next week a washing from the alluvia! gutter j will bo obtained! that will materially help tho j yield. The Young Aroona. having sunk ! its shaft 160 feet, has this week opened ! out at 156, the couutry being of a favor- j able kind for driving. Tho stocks of O'Connor's Freehold are rising, in sympathy with its neighbor, the Egyptian, having varied from 7s. to 89. lOd. The mining done during tho week has, however, been almost nil, and many de lays have been caused in the erection of ma chinery by potty accidents and otherwise. At the North Queou's Birthday, tho winding plant, consisting of 12-hors0 power horizontal en gine, with boiler nnd winding gear, is almost completed, and expect to bo ready1' for work iu a fortnight's time, when the present 100 foet shaft will bo carried dowil to 100 or 110 feet. The prospects hero aro considered fair, and as soon as actual mining operations will bo' resumed itn stocks will riso in value, being now quoted nominally only at Is. 6d. Tho Tunnel claims are very busy — the Belltopper Hill in rising and driving along .tho reef, which shows 2 feet of stone, carrying gold. Contractors aro also busy preparing for erection of battery, a portion of which during tho present week hiR beeu brought on to the ground. The Belltopper Ctown Tunnel aro actively employed starting the drives named last week as having been decided to commence. Tho Premier, in addition to other troubles, havo this week mot with a largo influx of water, which has had the effect of breaking thu sinking coutract, aud of using other and more energetic means to combat with 700 or 800 gallons of water per hour. Tho Qneon Victoria hag met with a body of stone, but as yot without gold, but are driving away iu hopes of soon coming on tho shoot expected to be met with. Tho Humboldt Company will decide at its half-yearly mooting, ou Friday next, what steps will have to bo taken in connection with the recent destruction of Ibelr plant by fire. Tim loss sustained by the company will not bo so great in money as in time, as it must now be souio months boforo tbo works can be ro- buiucd at the point left off before the accidental cn'<;urrencc. Ino starting of tho new ma chinery of tho Energetic has resulted fairly well. Five hcud6 only could bo kept going, owing to tho non arrival of some special plate. Aftor 4 days1 crushing 48 oz. of ntualgnm was taken off tho plates, which is considered for (he time very good. Tho 10 heads will be, however, put to work at once, and at tho end of tho fortnight a good yield may be expected. Work below is carried on, and tho stone is said to bo looking very well. An improvement Has taken nlace on the M'Oluro lino of reef, the Central M'Cluro espefeialty looking well. A rim has therefore been made on the stocks during the weuk, muging from 2s. 6cl. to 4s. 6d. The No. 2 shaft having been sunk 90 feet, a drive was put iu froin near tbe eastern leg of tho reef, which shows gold freely. Tho work of erecting the 10-horso bat tery progresses sbmowhat slowly, and will uot bo completed for another month" Upwards of 300 ton": of stone await the same, now raised and lying on the surface Tho Federal aiao lias partaken of the general ran of luck : have struck stone in the bottom level that looks better than anything previously seen in the mine, aud on an average upwards of 1 foot thick. A riso in the stock has takon place, and ia likely to bo further increased, buyers at present being found ut from 2s. 6d. to 3s. Ellis's Free hold for the week brings in 53 oz. 17 dwt. of gold, making for the fortnight 123 02. 15 dwt. This is much abort) tho arorago of late, and as tho prospects aaa whole are reported as slightly bettor, it hi hoped this valuable miue has seen its worst yields. Arrangements for amalgamat ing the two claims, (lie Coliban and tho New Rising Sun, have again partially fallen through, tbo snaroholders of the former company not forming a quorum at tho ppeciat general meet ing called to consider the question. This will nmv, however, be effected in another way. Up wards <( 14,000 shares iu the company, having been forfeited for non-payment of calls, were sold to-day. realising 7s. Od. per 1000. Tbe holder of thoso will therefore now solve the difficulty, and as oon as possible amalgamate, forming one company, with a large extent of ground, containing auriferous quartz to almost any extent. Tho Frinco of Wah s are getting some goyJ looking wash from the face, and are busy erecting a puddling machine to put it through, rihould the gutter continue to show as at present, a largo extent of ground will bo opened up by an alluvial gutter that can bo traced for many miles in extent. Tho following show our return of gold for the week at a glance Queen's Birthday, 64O oz amalgam ; Egyptian, 227 | oz, 8dwr. goIiL: Aroona, 84 or. 7 dwt. gold; Ellis's Freo- ; I10M. 53 oz. 17 dwi. gold; Energetic, 48 oz. amalgam. 1 Next fortnight the No. 1 South Queen will be added to this list. CLUNKS. An improvement is reported from the Port Phillip and also from the Bute and Dowues. Tho former had a crushing from the western lode between Nos. 11 and 13 levels which is estimated to yield over 7 dwt. to tho ton. This average will pay well, as the lode is very wide and easy to work. A crushing taken from tho eastern reef at No. 2 level gave a return of 9 dwt. to tho ton. These aro tbe best crushing obtained during the week. Another lot taken from tho Old Man lode, Yankee ground. No. 8 level, wont 6 dwt. to tho ton. Seveirtv-iive tons from the western reef at No. 4 level yielded nearly 4 dwt. to the ton. The first crushing from the Cluncs Central Company was put through this week, and is expected to average nearly 4 dwt. to the ton. This return will give the 'tributors wages, but will not leave much margin for the shareholder. The Bute and Downes appears to bo again getting on a better run of ground, tho gold being of a zxiucn rougher description. The leading drives going out east give much better prospects, and there aro indications of the yields Improving. Thurs day washings gave a return of 18 oz. 19 dwt., Friday, 1G oz. 15 dwt., to-day (Saturday) 16 oz. 14 dwu, making a total for the week of 86 oz. 5 'dwt. Shares, whioh were sold during Fri day at 13s. Id., advanced in the evening to 14s. 6d.. several sales being effected at that figure. Sellers are now«ridng.l6s; The YankeO'cUiin has four- levels going, two of which are produc ing payable quartz. At the No. U level the drive is in 30 feet, carrying a. 3 I tut lode ; stone poor. At No 10 )orel,22 feet lias been driven; lode pinched email and U poor. At No. 8 level, tho Old Man lode is 5 feet wide. The .drive Is in 48 feet. Stotte averaged between 7 and 8 dwt. to tho ton. Ten foeb has been driven 011 tbe we&tern; lodo r.t No. 4 level, which is 21 feet wido. It ; has a payable appearance. Tho South Claries obtained 98 oz. 14 dwt.. for the first week of tho 'fortnight. This is somewhat less than previous returns. Nothing worthy of note has occurred in the underground workings. There is littjo or no improvement to report in tho north drive at tho 1205 feet level at the New North Ciuiics mine. Tbe lode is fully 12 feet wiilo, aud a littlo gold is seen in about 2 feet of the western side of the lode. A crushing put through this week is barely payable. There is a chance of it making better as it becomes opened up. Good working country is being driven through at tbo 1305 feot level, where six' men are able to drive from 16 to 18 feet a week. Stopes remain without change. The New Lothrir obtained 40 oz. 8 dwt. from tribnters' crUshings. Bat tery will be started again on Tuesday next. CASTLEMA1NE. At tho Forest Creek Wattle Gully Company, Chewton, tbo stopes aro reported 16 bo tho same in appearance. The contractors havo driven 10 feet in tho south level at 650 feet, but there is not tnuch change. They have boeu crushing from two stopes only during the fort night. and from 606 tons of stone they obtained a yiold of 142 oz. 7 dwt. of bar gold. At the United Ajax Company there is nothing now lo report ; they continue to havo encouraging 'prospects of gold in tho 300 feet level nnd in the slopes below : tho lenders going away east mostly showing gold. At tho 400 foot level they are uot past the sandstone bar yet, but tho quartz is widening and ban a good appearance; they expect to clean up from their crushing about Wednesday. Tho Town Reef Company ,are continuing tho drivo towards Cardwoll's workings, nnd stacking tlio stone for crushing, which will shortly be commenced. The Moon light Flat Steam Puddling Company had 6 oz. 3 dwt. of gold for the week. Tho Garfield Com pany, Chewton, cleaned up for tho fortnight from 500 tons of stone, and had 73 oz. 14 dwt, of gold. The Grand Trunk Company, Guidlford, have coma upon some better washdirt ; at their cleaning up last week from seven days puddling they obtained 21 oz. 1 dwt. of gold.
