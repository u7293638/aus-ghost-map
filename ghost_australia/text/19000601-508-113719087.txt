'GHOST' AT ST. PETERS, A correspondent writes: The quiet municipal district of St. Peters contains an old unoccupied house surrounded by trees and a broken-down fence. The place has been untenanted for a long time, and has about it an air of desolation. Some youthful but practical joker, finding such a fa vorable scene of operations, conceived the idea of frightening timid people by personating a ghost, and which in many cases was very successful. The mode of procedure is to saunter forth to the nearest road upon dark nights, end wait for su perstitious victims. When they approach near where he is concealed, the alleged ghost springs out before them, generally giving them severe flights. Attempts have been made to catch the culprit, but so far they, have all been unsuccess ful. The ghost, or practical joker, is rigged up in a large sheet and a quantity of phosphorus, which covering he has snatched from him by a confederate as he flits away, leaving the per plexed onlookers to suppose he had vanished.
