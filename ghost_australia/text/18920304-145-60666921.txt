No one knows better thian the individual who fabricet ed iIi puiblished tllatstatemenut that it is absolutely nttrue, and if he will subl stitute for the initials "JLL." in the quota tion my full and real namlle lie shall learn that hle cannlot publishll such falso assertions with impunitly, and le shall confess to his cost that tle tunme I nm known by in thls district is nt ani nn a imedl olne, and that lmy real appnllation is not " Moses - ." As the quotation reads it is not netionable. It is very cleverly written, so cleverly written in fact, that anyone might easily concludei that literary matter was being suppliel to thel Eixprss by " Illeetor," no!ld tt the editolmhip of that journal nhad beei.'taken up till the general election by one who aspires to relresent Eivelyn, antil who low discovers that he will not have "a ghost of ia show."
