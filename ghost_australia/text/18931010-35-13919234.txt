THE PRODUCE MARKETS. Monday. I Trade in Sussex-street. Although a shade hotter than at the close of last week, business in Suato by- street taken as a whole, was again dull. What improvements in prices did take place were not generally accepted. and transactions were fewer than they might have been in consequence. Maize, potatoes, and onions, all ruled firmer. Shortness of supplies, concentration of stocks, aim n rise in Melbourne were the reasons of these respective advances ; otherwise but few changes occurred, and therefore were unimportant. Till: rciücnuiNfl market. As we anticipated, if the Burrawong brought a small shipment or maize in advance would be the result. Her cargo ord; amounted to 1130 bugs, and the support by the other incoming boats from the Northern coast were scarcely worth mentioning. This being so, at soon as the market opened the price was fixed at 2s 8d for prime grain. Later on, however a certain amount of doubttulnots as to the probability of the advance being maintained was noticeable in the market, and Kohl era and buyers alike were unsettled in consequence. This feeling was apparent throughout the day, and the result was that not infrequently holders were temple J to take less money and get clear, while others rtbomtely stood out for full value. There \\((m no movement of importance in the oats market, late prices still ruling current, with only moderate sales. The closing; quotations were Maize. Small supply, market firmer, but unsettled.

[Advt J Tu of Land and Market Messrs J McNairn and Co., in their fortnightly report, dated Glasgow, 1st September, write -" During the past fortnight a large trade has been done in all kinds of provisions both in dairy produce and hog products Butter, as above, is in very active demand, and promises to be so during the ensuing autumn and winter Prim overland advices you will no tree that the quality in Denmark is meantime very indifferent, and also that the quant its is short, on account of the drought there The coal strike, which is very severe in England, is threatening to affect Scotland, but we hope too Scotch miners will agree to arbitration, and thus avoid the terrible consequences which almost usually come along with a strike Butter has been in active demand at a small advance, and we expect aside further advance in to-day's Copenhagen market This is caused by short supplies and indifferent quality We therefore would point out the necessity of forwarding colonial as early as possible, because it will reach a good market and realise high prices We expect to see higher races than lost j year, on account of the scarcity Canadian and State's cheese have been quiet, but lost all I vices report that the make in the Stated is rapidly running short, and so it is in Canada, but Canada up to the end of July had a make of 25 per cent more than last year, so that even with the short supplies in the States, Canada will counterbalance it In our last we were just receiving the last shipment of New Zealand cheese by the Arawa, the quality of which, we are pleased tone, was highly satisfactory. and we realised for these a smart sale at 54s Scotch ent case have been rather quieter during the last 14 days he ger supplies coming forward now that the harvest is getting over, and with still larger supplies expected, prices we think will recede Regarding colonial for the no v season, we expect the first shipment should realise 50s to 55s, and there is no doubt they will have an acre of it much, as tin have now established themselves and the retailers cannot do without them
