The worthy de;iizeus of Hdlly Dene and vicinity' were just coming iway from eyeniiig seryjee wjien Ben entel-- ed the hostelry with the. first .important news—fche:finding.of a.liy.e. babj on the roadside. . "Such another tiling never hap.penedin.my time afore," cried Mrs. well, with ojien eyes, in the tone one wonld use who considered finding, three-year-old babies beneath he.dges, rather common in England at. .Christr mas time, and her opinion had. just been uttered when J alia. Ann ;cried "that she would die" if she didnt go 'over.and see. it at once. To -[ireveiit ]jrej)iat.tu'.e dissolution of such a charming English girl, Ben recommended her to run over at once, and so she did, and we have been.told: although this happened a long time ago, that that baby had what our American cousins call "a high .old time" for an hour or so ; what between the proud self-elected mother, Polly and her mother, Julia Ann and sundry other neighbours, with the feminine members of their family ,tho whole of whom would bo too numerous to set down here. At length the young waif, having been fed with the most ravishing of sop food, and toasted by the tire, until his body became deep brick coloured, was swai tiled ill flannel nightclofhes, and put with loving hands into the little cot which hud belonged to the defunct Frankie. After that the visitors stepped upstairs cm tiptoe, and looked on the placid face of the sleeping cherub, ai.d v,-ondcred who the poor mother was that con id have the heart to leave so beautiful a bnv. by which it will be readily understood that they had all come to the conclusion that, the poor tramps seen after sunset were the diabolical individuals who had left it to die out in 1he storm. After this a lull, and then another grenf surprise. Binglehy was standing in his shop door contemplating another voyage to the haven o\erthe way, when all at or.ee he beernifi conscious of the fact that a horsi m in ivasriding at a breakneck pace ( 0 ,vn the hill in front of him. That consciousness changed to surprise when .lie saw the cftyalier make direct for his- own door, and 'when he recognised a gi-'ooinrfi-oni tlie'-JztalKlVe was astonished at having been suiprised, for he then, remembered th collision that Gollop had so 'skilfully avoided at the park gate? " I've got to wait for this," said the groom, handing a slip of paper to Bingleby. " The squire is ill then.' said the apothecary. " Yes,' replied the man, "the 3 y onng squire.' "The young squire! Why bless my soul and 1 ody man. I saw him riding like the devil not much more than-an hour ago." "Thou art a liar 1' implied- h-is courteous countryman.
