THE PIPE AND THE POET. When you haven't got a notion in your head, And your sense of 'riginaiity is dead, When your intellect is slow, And you feel, because you know, That the feet of all your lines will be like lead— Take some paper and a pencil in your hand, Ton can sit, or you can lie, or you can stand; If you have sufficient hair, You can frantically tear, Just you do so—not too hard, you understand ! Next you light a pipe, or else a cigarette ; If there's not the ghost of an idea yet You watch the blue smoke rings, And you think of lots of things; And very soon you'll find yon cease to fret. Soon you think you'll try and write a little sonnet Upon—anything you like—a lady's bonnet; Then you heave a little sigh And softly wbispei, *1 Must find a title first to put upon it.' Then you bother very much about the rhyme, And at last you think it certainly a crime To perpetrate a sonnet Upon any lady's bonnet; And you grumble then about the loss of time.
