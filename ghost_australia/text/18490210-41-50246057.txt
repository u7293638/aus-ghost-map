TRANSUBSTANTIATION. Gentlemen, — In the controversies of the day, you may remark that the Catholic only stands out in bold relief, while his opponents have no definite form but may be each of them 'Turk, Jew, or Atheist, ' Anything but a Papist,' The Catholic never commences a controversy, never inquires what is his opponent's creed but contents himself with defending his own; but if he can defend his creed successfully, he turns the defence into attack, for the reverse of right is always wrong, but his opponent may write him down and yet be no nearer the establishment of his own system, for the reverse of wrong may be wrong too. Tho Catholic, however, never wishing to aim one blow beside the mark, is often at a loss where to strike these undefined beings, as I am at this moment with your correspondent 'Theophilus.' I take it that he is a Unitarian, if he be, of course I cannot reason with him on Transubstantiation, till I have first proved against him the Divinity of Christ. If he be not a Unitarian, he owes it to Christianity to correct his own hasty, care less assumptions, for the second person of the Blessed Trinity, as Christ, is not eternal, a parte aute, did not create the world, was not everywhere, and wants many of the attributes claimed by ' Theophilus' for the Host, as consequences of actual Transubstantiation, according to the universally received maxim, that ' what proves too much proves nothing,' all ' Theophilus's' arguments come to the ground. But even God as God is not eternal as to the manner in which he reveals himself, otherwise the Eternal Father would be eternally in thunder and lightning on Mount Sinai, and the Holy Ghost eternally in the form of cloven tongues of fire. Yet when the Divinity and humanity become united in the person of Christ, 'Theophilus' would hold Christ eternally to every form it was his Divine will to assume, an infant at Bethlehem, a sufferer on Calvary, &c;, and if " Theophilus' sees, as he cannot but see, the absurdity of these premises, he will not try to circumscribe Al- mighty power and wisdom by the narrow circle of human comprehension, but admit that the same God who con cealed his Divinity under the form of an infant, can conceal both his Divinity and humanity under the sacra mental elements, and if God can do so, we have every reason to conclude the action from the possibility, when we have the word of eternal truth that it is so. But " Theophilus' says all this is the work of the priest, but 'Theophilus' knows well that the Almighty, since the creation of man, never conferred a general benefit on the human race unless through human agency. Noah, Abraham, Moses, the Prophets, were human beings ; still more, when the Redeemer came on earth, he did not come in the Majesty of his Godhead, but as a human being; he did not commit the preaching of his gospel to angels but to human beings ; all that we know of revelation we know through human beings, nay, even our very being— don't blush— was left unconditional on the human will. So you see in what con dition :" Theophilus' would place us, by carping at every thing or anything with which Divine Providence blesses us, because not immediately from Heaven. Diogenes,
