The Advertiser SATURDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1880. PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8. In the Legislative Council— The Northern Territory Routs Reduction Bill was read a third time and passed. The Northern Territory Sugar Cultivation Bill wasp?Stda second time and partly taken through comtnittes, its farther consideration being fixed for Tuesday* The Gladstone Park lands BUI was read a second time and taken through committee. The third reading was fixed far Tuesday. The Supply Bill was read a second time and taken through committee, the third reading being fixed for Tuesday. At 530 the Council adjourned till Tuesday. i TvS grants in aid to corporations and dis trict councils were again the subject of djecuseion in the Assembly on Thursday. Wheu the Estimates were under considera tion Mr. Mortlock moved to reduce the amount proposed for these grants by 25 per cen^., so as to make a beginning in a reform which involves at the same time retrench ment, and an approach to a mace equitable system of taxation than exists at present Ii does eeem monstrous that whan Opposi tionists and Ministerial supporters alike urge the necessity for taking steps to keep tip expenditure within the revenue, yet this vote, unnecessary and bad in principle, should be passed in undiminished amount year after year. It is generally agreed that the subsidy should not be stopped, all at once, as the various municipal bodies have based all their official arrangements and all their i elculations of works to be undertaken, upon the supposition that this aid will ba con tinued, but the frequent discussions |n and ut of Parliament must have, familiarised them wilt the idea that the-day; ifl;vWy likely to arrive Wore" long when & will lie discontinued. Mr. Mordocsfa proposal was reasonable and moderate, as it allowedfour yeatf for the completion of the change, and pthati is abundant time in which the coundls can make arrangements, either for seduction of expenditure or an increase of local taxation^ A ftep has teen aide; in the rig-htidif?Ction-by th# abolifcoa of 4he subsidies Jn^idjof prfvatoeu&jcripiaonv; Xhjsi reform was brought about by some particularly glaring cases in which the subsidies had been employed amply for the benefit of private persons, but it was neces sarily liable at all times to abuse, and it was well tQ stop it even-on ike ground l?t economy, and because lit was ieitthit toe timejhad arrived for4e«sei*^gKb.?sb grants with) a view to their total-abolition. . The local bodies are making a desperate fight against this movement, and Mr. Brafj, as their champion, has on the notice paper a motion to the effect that the dednc tion |of so much for the support of police nowimade from the grant to each district or corporation should no longer be made. Of course this would practically be to in cresie considerably the amount of the subsidy now paid, and there is small chance of such a proposition being agreed toby the Lower House. It has often been noticed that the very members of the Opposition who; most pertinaciously urge upon the Government the doty of retrenchment tbenjselves do their utmost to increase the expenditure. They preach economy in the gross and promote lavish outlay in detail. These subsidies, as we must continue to point out, are vicious in principle, because the money is 'takes from the proceeds of taxes drawn mainly from unpropeitied persons, and are spent for the beoefit of holders of property. When Mr. AtorUock urged this view! of the matter he was met by Mr. Smifli with the reply that the money was expended in w«rks that gave employment to laboring men. This is a curiosity in the way of argument. In the first place the laborer so employed is not thereby placed under any obligation; he gives a quid pro quo for bis wages, unless he is to be considered as c pauper, or the road and footpath jobs on which he is engaged as mere relief works. Supposing, how ever, he does gain an advantage from this employment, how does that benefit the other working men who are taxed to pay for it ? It would be very difficult to make Jones and Robinson believe that they would be benefitted by paying Brown to work in Smiih's garden; and yet this is precisely what some perton3 endeavor to persuade working men with reference to isbar^m plcyed in local improyeabants aHi njud'for out of the general revenue. ■ Bat the wockiqg-mtm argument ipHvm of the «übsi<iles is based upon {Be eapp^-^ lion that if they are stopped -less m<rt?r \riU: be expended in public works ; ∋ we have no right to assume that such. a result mould n«eeeaarilw foUosr-joca a change iir -tbo "present eastern. - If the roads and bribes «f a district can be kept in repair wiffi much less than the present annual expenditure, in fact without the money now received from the Govern ment, economy will have been effected without any counterbalancing eril; but if the money should be really needed it can beovtainedbjadditional localtaxation. This extra taxstkm would- intact "be a property tax. Like the present rates it would be lerod in proportion to the value of the property, whereas the revenue out of which the subsidies come is taken from penonajregaxdlees of their means, the rich man contributing little more Una the poor man, and in many oumn less. It is of course urged that the public work* on which these moneys are expended an for the good of all clams. Ibis may in a gensral way be granted, but holders of property gain the greatest and most direct advantage; and it ia a mere truism to observe that taxation should be propor tioned to the means of the taxpayer to bear the (burden, whereas the general revenue from which lite subsidies are drawn is not raised on this principle. Some of the members of the Assembly are in a perfect mist with regard to this matter. They support die subsidies, bat will abolish them as soon as a property tax it passed. On the score of justice there is greater reason for riisrawtanning the grants in aid now, as the objection to such an expenditure from the general revenue wiii be lees when property really contri butes something towards it than when it contributes nothing, or next to nothing. How can the district councils and corpora uoiib benefit by a property tax if that is to be the reason for depriving them of grants in aid:-' Aay socksax wjUjprotaUy he a tniall one, «nd there* will s&U; be msapje grounds of •bjection tn these subsidies, but the fact of a tax being imposed on pro perty is certainly a very extraordinary reason to assign for discontinuing expendi ture that improves property. The Gladstone Ministry is likely to have little rest from its labors during the receas, and it is very doubtful whether Parliament itself will be permitted to enjoy for a lengthened period s much wished for re* pose. Our telegrams tell us that rumors begin to circulate that a winter session is in contemplation, and whether this be so or not they indicate a state of things sufficient to cause anxiety a&d; even alarm. There hare been meetings held throughout Ire" kind and in those towns of England and Scotland to which Irishmen most do gravitate, in which very violent lan guage has been used, and which have in bloodshed, sometimes in death. The strange idiosyncrasy of Irish character which seems to associate religion with rioting has been as prominent as ever this August in the Lady Day demonstra tions of Catholics and Orangemen; and Land Leaguers have, Sunday after Sunday, been engaged in urging crowds of ignorant and' excitable peasants to open defiance of law and order. Hardly had the horror caused by the New Boss oatnage, ia which a father and his two sons were fired at and one of them fatally wounded, begun to abate, when another of these brutal crimes for which neither reason nor excuse can ba found has been added to the dark role of Irish agrarian murders. Lord Mountmorre3 was not much known to the outside world, but among his own circle and even by iris own tenantry he was regarded as a 2airly good type of a considerate and indulgent landlord. What may have been the im 3meCatelyj*xciting cause of enmity in bis "case we cannot tell, and possibly may never know, for judging from past experience, and especially from the parallel case of Lord Leitrim's assassination two years ago, even die offer of £1,000 reward is not likely to induce an ucformer to risk certain death by denouncing the muxderez. Eut Jtont? like ithese affofci a Bad illustration of the pnhapgy poiidition of morality and .{*ecl4ess9pin?BSMU into which.« section of the people of Ireland have fallen despite all efforts to assist them; and as our tele grams of Monday last say that several other murders since that of Lord Mountmorres have been reported we may expect to hear of other isolated outbreaks, though pro bafelyvtae-.fea? of afty organised general .rising are premature and-exaggerated. ; The reason-assigned for this renewal and intensification of agitation is the rejection of the Disturbance Bill by the Bouse of Lords. In the abstract this Bill did seriously interfere with the rights of pro perty, and contained principles and clauses on-which English *nd Scottish landowners might well look askance if it were intended permanently and universally to adopt them. Nevertheless, it was exceptional legisla tion to meet exceptional circumstances; it was tentative legislation meant only to last for a limited period; and it was surrounded by safeguards which very considerably diminished its dangers. The members of the Upper House were folly within their rights in rejecting the mea sure, bat they would have avoided much confusion and possible bloodshed if they had passed it. Though the Earl of Derby's speech was denounced by Lord Salisbury as that of "one who was unable to over come the mental peculiarity which pre vented him from taking a decisive step," and has been characterised by the Conser vative press as a mere " cautious exposition of middle-measures," it nevertheless de served far more attention than it received from the House of Lords. The noble Earl avowed that he was do enthusiastic ad mirer of the Bill, but, statesmanlike* he accepted it lest a worse thing might befalL He argued that it was an exceptional measure, and should therefore be applied over as limited an area and far as short a period as possible; but as as emergency existed, as the House of Commons had passed the Bill and the people of Ireland expected it, he for one -was not prepared to take the consequences which might result from its rejection. These consequences have already began to appear in discontent, seditions language, and overt acts of cruelty and violence. Inflammatory speeches have been made at public meetings by men in good position, and eveirJjy members of Parliament; and when brought to Ixxjfe for their effusions in theJllouse v of Commons they. hase . -Avowedrdefe?ded, and in more parliament itftylangnage; repeated them. , A fair specimen of this blood and murder oratory is given ia the speech of the mem- ~rer for Tipperary at Kildare. Mr. Dillon attended a meeting by the Land League for the purpose of denouncing v feudal liMv^lnHv"" and oppression, nniting the tenant fexmex? and the tillers of the coil in a legitimate combination against in timidation, rack-renting and land-grabtnag, and, above all, of reviving and diffusing a spirit of nationality." "The son of Joe Dillon of '48" made an impassioned harangue, marvellous for its open advocacy of violence even from the lips of a red-hot Home Baler. He warned his hearers sot to put their trust either in the English House of Commons or in the recently-appointed Royal Commission on Irish land, on which wen "Irish landlords whom timJTii&t;?' farmer* threw out of {fair aeate'-beowisci they were the enemies of the people.*; He advocated an organiration <rf lumaa old, sad joung, so perfect and well amed that "no farm iroar which «ny man had been evicted should be touched-, or naedfor human purpceea until its rights fnl owner was put back on the soiL" The honorable duty which he assigned to the Irish members of Parliament was to "keep the House in play o —to " paralyse" it— while 300,000 men were orgamaing, drill ing, and preparing themselves to match, rifle in hand, to land meetings. He would have his hearers to take measures to en sure that those who entered on the farms of evicted persons should be " made uncom fortable," and that the landlord's cattle, if they were put on the land, should "not prosper,*' No wonder that Mr. Forster, who is responsible for the preservation of law and order, should denounce the speech on the earliest opportunity as "im prudent, wicked, and cowardly"—the last ahaft being pointed, by the remark afterwards made, Oat white Mr. Dillon excited others to break the Jaw and zisk isprimimienV banishment, perhaps ewcu tion, he took very good care so to balance his phrases that he himself should be com paratively safe from the consequences of prosecution. It is most striking and ominous that when Jklr. Dillon's extra-parliamentary ut terancee were brought before the House the | indignation of the Home-Rulers was out poured, not on the maker of the speech, but on the denouncer of it. A f eebh) sugges tion that possibly the orator had not been reported correctly was indeed hazarded, and a mild attempt to explain away the incitement to " rough" cattle was made; j but when Mr. Dillon admitted that he had advised the Irish people to resist the law, and avowed that he would con tinue to do so "so long as the present Government and the present Chief Secre tary retained their away," he was extolled by his brothers of the Home Rule brigade for his patriotism and courage, and poor Mr. Forater's .language was condemned a "venomous and violent." Mr. Dillon maintained that the Chief Secretary had himself declared that the law was harsh and unjust, and in face of that declaration he was bound in honor either to refuse to carry out the law or to resign hie seat on tEe Treasury Bench; while Mr. Arthur O'Connor, who acted us seconder and botUe holder,-went so far as to assert "that the evicting landlord who cast out the tenant who was unable to pay was to bis mixui a& a footpad who took a purse under threat of murder, and it wa<j no more immoral to resist the one than the other." When language 'like this is heard in the halls of legislator <j is it strange that the impressionable and populace should translate it as encouraging and justifying them in resistant even unto blood;" or can it be said tjaat the strong words of Mr. Forster arq more than ade quate for the occasion ?

This optical illusion Is one with-which-the name of Professor Pepper, who invented it, Jias become so tJKHoaghty asso ciated, that iat production by him ahould attract all who desire to see it represented in the'-beet possible manner. The " ghosts " are notnew to Adelaide, but tiie Profeooz waathe first to call t^hfm op, and ell other ">*giciann in tiiis line of mysterious business must be oonsidered inferior in coraparison. We'had-the' pleasure ot wit nessing a rehearsal of the entertainment in Garner's Theatre on Triday'aftemoob, and can apeak in the highest terms of it. Professor Pepper .has secured 'for the originals of his ghosts several hdies and gentlemen -who have excellent voices, and the mysterious portion of tbe entertainment wffl therefore be pleasantly varied toy ajngisg. while the oomis element is abo freely mtroduced. The pretty clasaioal legend of "Pygmalion axd Oalatea."receive* a capital representation, and various, aeene* m& mortals, wtaiths, and cherub* are also to be put on tiie stage. The apparatus is the same as that' which the Piofeasor made use of when he gave ' the entertainment at tiie London Polytechnic. On Friday evening MrrSketchlej gave a dramatic reading at Gamer* Theatre, oons-st ing of eritctioa* from the play of " Henry tiae fourth.'" The scemes chosen were those in which theiedoubtable fat taright, Sh> John Fdsteff, is introdjneed. Me. Sketohley prefaced his mad ing .with a few remarks en the character .of Falctaff; which he said was, in hi* opinion, an ideal creation of the poet, and not as many supposed a mere cariostnre of a oontempo 'rary. He pointed out tha extremely diverse characteristics of the fat knight as deputed bj maintaining that although a so', and a braggart he was noverthele? represented as a gentUman,and that hi* supposed oowardios was really the result of want of energy Arising from his habit of body rather than frem want of pluck. Mr. Sketchier"*, voice is admirably suited to tbe impersonation'of the knight, and it may be said that if he ever essays tiu rbarartw on the stage he will not require much aid from art in p??iring up for it. Hi* reading .ef the part was in many nspaets .excellent and he/nanaged to make one or twj good points, but on the whole it was somewhat monotonous. The reader's failing in this re epeet is, however, no doubt to be accounted for by the fact that he was evidently still suf fering from tiie bronchial 5"" that has on previous oociaious marred tibe effect of bbi en* ; tertemmenta. After tile dramatic reading; ■ Mr. Bketehley treated his audience to the inimit ably funny history of the manner in which Mrs. .Brown-spent* happy day at Boaberville Gar dens. The repeated laughter and applause of the audience showed hojr keenly they appre ciated, the. humor of the narration of Mr*. Brown-mistaking the boat at London Bridge, and hcrdasparate leap from one steamer to . another, of how she got to tiie gardens and broke tbe weighing ■"?M"« in a vain effort to ascertain her ponderosity, had her portrait takes by a lad and the oonafquenoes thereof, and how finally she got Jost in the maze and rescued from her perilous position, anu returned home utterly fatigued, determined nevarfagain to try to spend a happy day along with Brown. The Victorian Football Club has now been formed for seven or eight year*. Oaring the first few years of It* existence it was tiie custom to hold annual dinner*, but Utterly, owing to various causes, these reunions have been discontinued. Thii year, however, it was decided to have a dinner at the end of the foot ball tvacoD. Tbe dinner was held aceordinjy atOhristaeli Scotch Thistle Hotel, North Ade laide, on Friday evening, October 8, when about sixty members and others sat down to a spread ■tost tastefully prepared by Mrs. Christie. In the absence ef the patron, Mr. C. Peacock, MJ, and the president, Mr. J. L. Parsons, Mf.,aieehair was taken by Mr. W. N. Pratt, and the vice- chair by Mr. G. W. Downs. After the usual loyal toasts had been drunk, Mr. J. CresweU proposed "The Victorian Football Club." He said tbe style of play of tiie dob was the best Chat could be ceeu in any club in the association. They ought to be proud of their captain, Mr. G. Downs, who was acknow ledged to be the best captain of any football dnbfn Adelaide. They had been beaten a few rinw during the aeason, but that was mainly owing to ilMuek, and they had just reason to be proud of the fact chat they had beaten the Norwoods, a dub which had previously held tae premier position iv the association. Mr.F. A. fciveaab, the secretary of the dub, responded. He read the "w1 report, and gave a resume of the «n?^i?f which had been played by the Victorians during the teaaon. The club analysia was a* follow*:—In association matches ten games had been played, of which five had been won by the club, three drawn, and two loot. Altogether fifteen matches had been played, of which eight had been won, five drawn, aud two lost. The goal kickers were A. Slight, who kicked five; J. Sharp, three; A. Brinsley, three; end J. Wilson, B. Brown, J. Minnie, A. Miller, W. Eiley, and W. Davis one each. The chairman ■aid he had a moat pleasing duty to perform, which was the presentation of a gold locket to Mr, A. Blight, the most suesessful goal-kicker of the reason. Mr. Bidde at the beginning of the season had promised to give a present to the man who kicked moat goals, aud Mr. Slight was at tiie top of the li*t with five goals. Mr. Slight returned thanks in a few suitable words. The health of Mr. BicUe was then propesed by the i*i?irm*" J and responds! to. Mr. G. Downs, the captain of tbe club, pro posed—"The Patron, President, and Vice- Presidents,'' and said that all would agree that their honorary officers were men who took a great interest in tiie game. Although they had not all been present at •vszy match each ef them had attended at least one match during the season. The toast was drunk with cheats.-'' The chairman end PooiiciOorDofma responded. Mr. Bidde gave—Tbe Captain, Vice-Captain, and Officers." .He said no doubt Mr. Downs was as good a captain'as they could get in Ade laide, but still he thought that when Mr. Downs had been absent- Mr. O. Warren had acted almost if not as well as captain as Mr. Downs. Theeeeretary (Mr. Fiveash) had done his work properly, and be had never beard any one speak ' disparagingly of him. The captain of tiie club; in responding, referred to the fact that the Vic torians had been tiie first dub to bring a Mel bourne team over, and the first to visit Victoria and play there. Mr. B. Whitfield proposed v The South Australian Football Association and the kindred clubs," and said it gave him -much pleasure to see so many supporters of the game present, and especially to see tiie secretary of theassoeiataou. There was no doubt that the association had done a great deal of good in furthering'tbe interests of the game, and in settling the disputes that were sure to arise. Mr. J. CresweU, the secretary of tbe association, responded. The toasts of "The ladies,""Tbe chairman, 9' and " The host and hostess, 9* fol lowed.
