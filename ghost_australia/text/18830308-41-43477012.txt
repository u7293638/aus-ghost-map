TpE REIGN OF TERROR IN IRELAND. TO- THE EDITOR. Sir — Your learned correspond* nt, John Green Ark,' in your issue of the 1st. inst. is to be complimented:— ' Vires movenies omne nefas animo.' — Hor. For the information of the ignorant Irish this means^ — When men are moved they can do anything that is wicked.' I accept the dictum of the heathen poet. Ireland in the days ot Charles the First illustrates too plainly the assertion of the poet, and wicked things were done in those days. As to the murder of 200,000 Protestants in 1641, who is his authority? Lingard, Hallam, and Taylor are against him. They are no mean authorities. Mr. Maxwell, afterwards Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, gave evidence of Protestants walking on the water and brandishing their swords, and raising their hands to heaven (see Hallam). These documents are still preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin (see Warner, a Protestant clergyman). The massacre of Protestants in 1641 is a pure fiction (see Taylor, Moore, The Four Masters, Lingard, Milner). Sir John Temple, who gave currency to the popular opinion, gained his information from the revelations of Protestant ghosts from the records of thirty-two folio volumes now in Trinity College, Dublin — a literary curiosity. I was simple enough to believe that John Bull would give Ireland fair play. No auch thing. In Ireland, just now, there is neither law nor justice. My eyes have been opened by recent events, and hence, I give my cordial adhesion to the ' Irish National Land [League.' Happilv, Protestants and Catholics are united, and Home Rule or Repeal of the Union must come. What Constitution can withstand the will of the people? If lam not guilty of heresy, I will conclude with a very popular proverb, Vox Populi vox Dei. ...... lam, Sir, &c;, : J. T. EEDLLY. ; Byf om-place, March 4, 1883.
