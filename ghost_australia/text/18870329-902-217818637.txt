Sensational Ghost Story. "Lady Cowper tells one of the most ab surd ghost stories ever put on record. Sir Coplestone Bampfylde (M.P. for Devonshire) coming to town, met with a Scotch pedlar, who offered him twenty-four ells of brown bolland so cheap that be bought it, tied it up in paper, and carefully put it himself into his portman- teau. As Sir Coplestone was crossing a great plain with his man and a neighbouring gentle man, a sudden light shone round them, the horses were frightened, the baronet and his friend thrown, and the groom run away with for two miles. When the gentlemen got up they saw something white at a little distance, which proved to be the ' twenty-four ells of fine I10I- and , stretched out as ror whitening 011 the ground. When the groom returned they looked at the portmanteau and found it fast aud the paper and string whole ; but wheu they came to open it ' the hnlland was gone, to their great amazement ; ' though on the whole it would have been more amazing had the hollaud re mained in the parcel, seeing that at the same time it was stetclied on the ground. Lady Cow- per adds Sir Coplestone is a drunken coun try gentleman, and if he did not invent this (which I am afraid be did), yet it may be a drunken fume. And it seems to me lie did not mightily believe it himself ; for he says he has made the liolland into shirts, mid expects that some murdered" body will came and demand them of him one day or another.'
