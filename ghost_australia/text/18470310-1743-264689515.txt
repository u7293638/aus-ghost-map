FRANCE AND ENGLAND* BY C. M. Wfe make no bobst of Waterloo; Its Dame excites no pride in us; We have no hatred of (he French, No scorn of Yanfcee or of RUM T-liu Glory that our fathers gained In bloody warfare years agone, Ami wiitcli Uiey talked of o'er their cops Gives us no joy to think-upon. I« triilli we rather love the French, And think our fathers did (hero wrong, And sometimes blush when, in the streets, Quite out of dale, an ancient song- Ghost of a prejudice—come back, And tells us how, in days gone out,- The best of Englishmen was he' Who put a dozen French to rout. We have no foolish thoughts like these Of France or any other land, Andjraloiisies so poor and mean We're somewhat slow to understand. W»M rather with our friends, (he French; - . • Encourage kiodliuess of thought, Than gaiu a score of WalerlooB, Or any battle ever fought. And in this year of "forty-six," We rising menic life's young prime, Are men who think the Frenoh have dons The world good service in Iheir time. And for their sakea, and for our own. And freedom's sake o'er all (he earth, - We'd rather let old fends expire, And cling to something better worth. To be at strife, however jnst, Has no attractions to our mind ; And as for nations fond of war, We think tliem pests of human kind, Still, if there must be rivalry, Between as-sad the French-, why then Ijet earth behold us while we try Which of tbe two ate better men. We'll try Ibc rivalry of Arts, Of Scicnce, Learning, Freedom, Fame, Wc'IIJtry who first shall light the world Willi Charity's diviuest flame— Wbo best shall elevate the pour, And teach the wealthy to be true— We want no rivalry of arms, We want not to boast of Waterloo.
