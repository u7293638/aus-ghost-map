Ilia speech' occupied five houri an I a half in delivery, Rud ua« not bo much occupud with the- facts of tlie case as with a vaiiety of (acts in tbo life of the prisoner, tending to show ,-that he had long 'been of. unsound- mind.' This view was supported by -reference to the interpretations laid down in the vvorks of medical men as to what it ivus thit constituted hisiuiily'. ? A number of wit-r nesses vvvero then examined, vvhi had known the' prisoner at different periods through his life. . They all dt'posedJo. circumstances which went to shew -that he was weak, silly, nnd ii responsible, and they all declared their belief (hat he wra« insane. The Court ndjourned at a late hour. On the . resumption .of .the trial on liia following morning, llhh. July, the Co tut - house, as upon every' forrnur 'dayT^ivai densely crowded. 'The deineanuur of tha prisoner remained unaltered. ' He still preserved the msst peifect coolness and se)f-coniinand.. He was dreusedin a nevt suit of -black, and appeared either encon cerned at hisnwfu) position or unconsuioui of it. Several witnesses were examined 16 Ihe Bame efleul as those who had' given their testimony ou the day before. Mr. Thorn ton, a schoolmaster, who had. known the prisoner since 1852, deposed to .the fact that his conveistition had always been wild and incoherent,' that he could- not speak rationally' fur thorc limn a minute or two,, that he was afraid of ghosts . and goblins, that lie. employed a wizard ..to charm his landlord's steward, so that he might leave him in possession of his. farm, &c.;,al;York ; Mr. : Kitchen, 1. one ofaha ?ii[-erinlent)ei)!s at the Retreat ; and Dr. Smith, the proprietor' of a lunatic asylum, were examined and mentioned. Bevaral strange and eccentric things. — Dr. Caleb Williams, the medical attendant of tho Retreat testified to their belief that tho prisoner wns of unsound mind— a conclu sion to which they weie led by thu facts elicited at the tiinl, aud by peisonal ex amination of the prisoner. This evidence closed the cuse : for the defence, upon which Mr. Overend repliud nt great length, contending that thu de fence,' of insanity was merely an ?? after thought ; that the prisoner had ; always been vicious and cruel, vvhioh ? was ' no proof in itself of insanity ; and that if a criminal who had committed so - cold blooded a muider were allowed to osoapa on such grounds, no licnrtli in the kingdom would be safe from poison.
