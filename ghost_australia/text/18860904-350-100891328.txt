Luddenham. NOTES BY THE SPARROW. We are having glorious times here. Rain every week, and grass and crops grow- ing splendidly. The town is making great progress, buildings are going up, and orchards and vineyards are being planted all oyer the neighbourhood. I have been informed that a concert is to be given here shortly. Particulars, no doubt, will be advertised in your paper. Luddenham has a ghost! Now, Mr. Editor, I don't believe in ghosts, but when one is woke up in the solemn hours of the night by the ringing of the Public School bell, it would lead you to imagine that a spirit had returned from the other world. Miss Chapman says that she looked through her window and saw a tall man ringing the bell, and a large white dog standing by his side. I would advise the ghost, next time he comes to ring the bell, to leave the dog at home, as it is well-known.
