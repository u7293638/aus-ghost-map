[ALL RoU7Io ITRRRViDv.] THE MYSTERY OF ILFORD CRANCE. Ilford Grange lies in on n nlroddn valley in the heart of England, a lovely rretrent. where the call of the bird has not belen silenced by the shriek of the steal whistln, and where the sky is not clouded, nor the air fouled with smoke. A mile from the old Grange stands a lone alehouse, whose asignboard,'Tliao lobin Ilood, speake of tio old forest days.

Paying no heed to the oathe and threate of dire vengeance uttered by the bullying lout below, I at once hurried after the poor little creaurroe, who,glidingswiftly before moe, kept turning round to son if I were following on. Up a second flight of stairs, panning along o corridor that I rememberedl well in the daiys of old, my little pilot then began ascend. nlg a third steep flight that I know led to a sueit of roome seldom or over used in my childhood's dayn, and that bore the repute. tion of being haunted. Pasoling through two apartments that opened one into tile other, tie little fellow camne to A pliuso, and placlig his trembling little hand upon the door of a third ichambor, ihe exclaimed, in a heaitoting and tremhling voice, " Luura'H herel" " Laura's there, is ahe?"l I replied, smiling at the troubled expresiaon that rented upon the ipeor boy's featureu; for though locked, I was well assured that I could snon hurnt the door upon if nocessary; and crlling to mind that Laura was thie namu of Imy pretty playmlte and cousin in the long ago, I determined, without any scruple, to force an entrance Iin. to the roomu. lForthwith, and without any further tondo, 1 gave a hound with my â€¢shoulder against the olbtaclo before me; that, as I expected, tore the lock away, and landed eme sprawling upon tile floor of the chamber buynnd. Stlrting to my foot, I was now astounded at beholding a yriong and lovely girl, a beautlful blonde, lying upon a cooch, bounld hland and foot, whilst piled up to the oillinK, as if ready for removal, I obervred ar chetel of draweor, tables, clhairs, card-tables, nld wouh. slands, oil packed one upon the other, caun. nlg the chaoibur to resemble the sale rouom of an nuctioneer. My first proceeding was, of course, to roe lease from her bonds the weeping girl, who, in wild alarm, seizing me by the arm, ex. claimed: " Wlhat have you done with that llnfamnous wonman and her son?" " Shown them both ttme thot I mo0n to be Inator hero " " But the dog--they will set the horriblo irute upon you I" " Thlv did that saluo tlhing, IImy dear girl, and I served ])ide as I used to do the will Inarne but tiil me, Laura, what Is the Ineaon. lng of that strange array of fIrnituro 7" " I will tell you nil-everythi ng, But say, are you nolt iny cousin Mlles, that poor uncln ans oxpeating 1" " nam hel yea, Laura.
