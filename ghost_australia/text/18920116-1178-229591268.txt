BOOKS TO READ., DISMAL STORIES- | Literary merit alone, we presume, would|;| justify the inclusion in Macmillan'a Colonial Library of two suoh works as '? Cecilia de ;r'| Noel," by Lance Falconer, nnd " Blanche, 'jjj Lady Falaise," by J. H. Shortbouse. That' ;i| tbey possess literary merit is unquestion-. n able, but it is equally unquestionable that they are dismal tales. The first is, wo pre- same, a sort of physiological sketch, and it f may, perhaps, involve some subtle idea £ as to tho overwhelming power of sympathy | with Buffering. If so it would bo far -t better expressed. Here wo have a number | of peoplo holding various crudo ideas as to the condition of things generally, and sud- J donly confronted in turn by a ghost in an old 9 country house which cffoctually disperses all j? their preconceived opinions. At last Cecilia . do Noiil, depicted aB a most amiable woman,- . j also meets this ghost, and boing convinced that the perturbed spirit is only seeking'/ rest, sho assures it of her lllimitablo love, i enfolds it in her arms, and it obtains rest ) accordingly. There may be, as we havei said, somo reference to tho power of lovo' hero, bat it iB vory occult and far-fetched. t "Blancho, LadyFalaiBe," is a still more tin- happy story, bocau»o it is unhealthy. 1 Blancho loves a man who jilts her and mar- f ries soniobody olso. Sho marries Lord Falaise who, knowing all, loves her de- J vototlly, but although she performs her ' wifoly duties alio still hankers after thai j original sweetheart — for ho is nothing more —and when ho turns out a rascal and is l hung she accuses hersolf of being the canse of his miserable eud, and after an attempt at self-destruction is killed by a flash of - lightning in tho Alps, Snch a plot as this is scarcely worthy of tho " penny dreadfuls," and it is to be regretted that Mr. ShorthoUso i took tha trouble of putting it into form.
