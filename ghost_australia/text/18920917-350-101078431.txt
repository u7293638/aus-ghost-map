Cable Horror Padded cholera horor "cabled from Hamburg "to a Sydney evening paper: The shrieks and groans of the dying and the stifling atmosphere of the crowded hospitals are friglitful. The bodies of men, women, and children are piled in heaps awaiting burial " The Bulletin (remembering that dying cholera victims die in collapse, and don't shriek at all stops to add a few details which the evening horror-monger has omitted. The yell of the dead are fearful to listen to. An unknown miscreant has poisoned all the physic. Troops of wild dogs have rushed the hospitals to devour the dead bodies, and are only kept at bay by having jars of sulphuric acid shot at them out of heavy siege guns. A prominent doctor has gone mad, and is playing the fiddle on top of a pile of corpses, and singing fragments of opera in a high cracked voice ; and a deranged physician is travelling naked through the streets with a burning torch shrieking, " Yet 40 days and Hamburg shall be destroyed !" Several insolvent land-banks are staving off their depositors by tying deceased cholera patients to the counter. Pieces of a defunct politician are alleged to have been discovered in a sausage-shop, and the proprietor droped down dead just as the mob rushed his establishment. Eight insurance offices have closed up owing to their losses, and the managers have all hanged themselves in a restaurant, The city is on fire in 167 places, and a mad bull with an infant impaled on its horns pervades the princi- pal thoroughfare. The ghosts of the dead go through the streets at night, each, one with his tombstone under his arm, and carry off the people they meet, none of whom are ever heard of again. Forty dead bodies have been found in the city water-supply, and a cranky patient is sitting on top of the cathedral spire. Further details are expected.
