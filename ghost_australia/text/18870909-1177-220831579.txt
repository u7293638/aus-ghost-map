Three Men Killed. Martin Johnson and Saul Soronson, while sleeping in a hut at Jeetho, Gipps- land, were killed during the recent bois- terous weather through a tree falling on the hut. Two other men were badly in- jured, one or whom is in a crtitcal state. Another man in the same neighourhoud (Edward Kennedy) was killed while work- ing in a garden through the limb of a tree falling on him. As a farmer from Tarlo was coming home from Goulburn a week or so ago with a supply of groceries, &c.;, he thought he heard a strange noise among the things, and being a sober man, and certain about the articles he had bought, he concluded in his frightened state of mind that there must be a ghost in his cart. After mus- tering courage enough he very cautiously com- menced to search, and to his surprise, instead of a ghost he found a hen and her egg, A fact.
