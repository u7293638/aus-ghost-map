ANOTHER ABSURDITY. The advantages of rapid postal communication is very wisely reckoned amongst one of the greatest blessings of civilized life, and the only wonder is, considering the ten thousand evil agencies which legislators are apparently always setting at work to counteract those advantages, that we derive so much benefit from existing arrangements as we really do. It would appear, at first sight, that from the moment as unfortu nate letter enters one post-office, till the moment it comes out of another, its existence is one terrible struggle to escape the awful doom of a " dead letter," and that every man in the ser vice, from the first of postmaster-generals to the last of sub- sorters, have entered into some dia bolical league to cut short its worldly career, and consign it to that ignominious fate. This com plaint is not only true of the mother-country, where, we believe, they first hit upon the novel and excellent plan of sending sixteen thousand miles to tell a man there was a letter for him which he could have in the course of a year or two if he forwarded sixpence for it, hut is equally applicable to our colonial system. In proof of this, a case productive of much incon venience was brought under our notice yester day. A gentleman residing in A delaide received a communication from the Postmaster-General of Victoria, informing him that a letter from England is lying for him at the Post-office, Mel bourne, which letter will be forwarded to him on his returning an enclosed form wilk the neces sary request. The unsuspecting-'lost-letter owner fills up the official form, and despatches it as required, when lo ! by the next mail, instead of receiving the unhappy postal-tortured missive so long expected, there arrives the identical printed form he ^has recently sent away, with another equally imposing printed form, inform ing him that, as the return notice to the Post master-General of Melbourne had mot been pre paid, it had been opened and returned. At this stage of the proceedings our informant, believing himself haunted by the ghosts of all the dead letters ever murdered by official neglect, gave up the delusive hope of ever obtaining his own billet in despair, and left us to point out the ab surdity of the public being expected to pay in money, as well as convenience, for the blunders of the authorities.
