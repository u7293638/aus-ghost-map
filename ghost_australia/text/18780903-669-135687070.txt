The Ghost at Ghost ESridsc, (To the Editor of the ' Illinvnrra Morcnry.'! ? Sir,â€” In your issue of to-day T notico a letter signed ' Geo. Osborno,' in which lie labours in vain to impress the Public that lio is concerned for their safety. This time he has not seen a gorilla nor a ghost, but a flimsy bridgo. Xcra Sir, any man having tho least regard for truth could not sit down and doliberatoly write such a tissue of incorrectness as his letter contains Tim temporary bridge is strong and safe. Any man examining it as I have done will nover again believe anything Mr. Osborne may write. Tlio young men work honestly and fair, and in time they will make a mark in the world as creditable to them selves as Geo. Osborne has done. DAVID PAINE. Dapto, August 27, 1878.
