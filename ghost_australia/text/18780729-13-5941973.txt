MONDAY, JULY M, 1878. Vacillation was no\er moi o pitifully displayed than it is now by Mirasteis m dealing with the oxpoit duty on wattle balk Time after time it has been pio mised that so soon as the bo.rd of m quiry reported and Piiliamont met, tlio tax m question should be îe mitted The Commissioner of Cus toms actually introduced a bill to íepeal the impost, but suddenly its piogiess waa stiyed Deputations of tanners havo w aited upon the Go ?\einment, meetings m the tanning wteiest have been held, and wo aio ominously informed that the Cabinet is again considering the subject A few months ago Mmisteis insisted upon the duty Then they admitted its failure, and now thoy aro waveling between the tv o decisions Now the tanner obtains the advantage, and now tho stnppei iSuch indecision is as painful to con template m Ministers of the Ciown as it is injuiious to the mterests which aie left m suspense, and it is conclusive evi dence that the Government have neither a knowledge of the subject noi yet ha^ e they any fixed economic pimciples to guide them in then dealings with it If they would but adopt the eleineutaiy i ulo that the state should nevei stave to ira po-v ensh any section of its constituents, they would not continue foi an hoar the eflbit to reduce the earnings of the balk strippers If they had evei realised the simple pioposition that an mci ease in the value of any national product is a cleai and direct addition to the national wealth, they would at once condemn as baibarous an impost tho object of which is to keep the value of a commodity below its natural level, to shut out the foreign buyer, and to pi event money coming into the colony Wi, objectaltogethoi also, and so, wo hope, will Parliament and the public, to the bark strippers, who proved their case befoie the boaid in tho countrj, being defeated after the mquuy is closed by back stair influence in the town "V\hat honest statements can the tanneis lune to whispei in the eais of Minutéis which thoy could not give openly to the boaid.

Tho evidence throughout is of a similai strain, and it is impossible to read it without slianng m tho conclu sion stated m the report, that present prices, the result of competition, aro leading to the conservation of tho tree, and that if w o stop the export of the bark, and give the local tanner the mono poly, the wattle will bo unprofitable, and will be tieated once moro as a nuisance, while, if we do not mtorfero, it will bo looked aftei as a valuablo source of income In the ono case « o make it the mteiest of eveiy selectoi to destioy the wattles on bis own giound and those about him, foi the tree is as piohfic as a weed and requires to bo stamped out as much as the thistle, unless its presence is to bo tolerated, and m the other tase wo make it tho inteiest of the laudownei to piotect the tiee "Which policy is likely in the long run to do the taiméis tho most good it is needless to say The trade is under a delusion, and is asking the state to do it an ultimate wiong We are justified m taking a more than geneial interest m this subject, foi it seems that it was through the medium of The Air/us that the export trade was established It is m evidence that stite ments published m oui columns led to inquines fiom England , shipments w eie made, and a ti ade established which his been growing m cr smce, and has done good all lound We lead in tlio îeport that the " industry has assumed " laige piopoitions, ' is "afloidmg em " ployment to a numerous class, the " majority of whom aie men with " families," the earnings aie " fauly ie " muneiatne," and "whole families are " comfortably supported " Hauy selec tois, it is also obsened, "augmentthen " income by lesoituig to balk shipping " -by tins means maintaining success " fully the stiuggle to pay off the accu " mulation of lent upon theu holdings " In the woids of one of then numbei " ' Without the help affoided by the " ' balk giowmg on Crown lands adja " ' cent, it would have boen difficult to " 'have found means to clcai and fence " ' then holdings, so as to comply w ith " ' the conditions of the Land Act under "'which then licences weic isaued'" And it is predicted in the îeport that the îesult of maintaining the prices will bo " the establishment of a great export "trado on a peinranent basis, besides "assuring the futuie of our own leathei "tiade" And whj, it maj be asked, should pnces be aibitianly i educed?

m oidor to conect tho eccentricities of a partisan Bench, and rescue the tribunal with which thej aie connected from the degradation of being used as a weapon of political wnifaie, certainly reieals a condition of things which may well create something lil o a feeling of dismay m the minds of all sober ci.i_.ens That tho justices whoso conduct has boon called in question hy the Government organ

entirely to tho re- monstrances of tho mon thoy aro ruining in tho Echuca district. Accordingly, they aro about " to roliovo tho tomporary " depression in tho timbor trado by \- asking tiie sawmill proprietors to tondor vijor the supply of 200,000 redgum sleepers at an early dato, fio* it appears that there is somothing emi- nently characteristic of Borryism in tins _otcnnination, for the simplo fact that it is unsound in principle, and cannot fail to be utterly inoffectivo in opera- tion. It is unsound in principio for many reasons. It is anothor attempt to avert unpopularity and buy party sup- port at the -oxponso of the stato, by pro Tiding artificial employment. We havo been authoritatively informed that rod tmni sleopers are not largely used in the construction of our railways, becauso it is far moro economical to uso tho timber of tho country through which the lines pass, whenever it is auitablo. Why should tho country bo put to an extra out- lay for redgum sleopors when all tho nuUownors ask for is freedom of trade ? Again, what difference does it mako to na whether tho redgum trees aro unneces- sarily converted into sleepers for uso in Victoria, orwhothor thoy aro out into tho sizcB most in demand and exported? Tho waste-if waste it can be called-is as great in one caso as in the other. What tho Cabinet ought to havo decided was-is an export duty necessary on any valid ground, or can ovory legitimato purpose bo served by judi- cious regulations and extensivo plant- ing? Thon again, no half-measures can possibly remedy tho evils of which a deputation recently com- plained. It would bo impossible to cut only sleepers sucli as aro used on our railways at a profit, unless at an oxtra vagant price. A log can only bo cut up economically when every portion can bo utilised, and, as wo know, tho markets for tho smaller sizes which aro obtained from tho " waste " aro outside tho colony -viz., in South Australia, where sleepers of small dimensions aro re- quired, and in Riverina, whero groat quantities of quartering, &c;, are con- sumed for building purposes. It is evident that an order for Victorian sleepers will lead to a very great sacrifico of valuablo material without affording much employment. The steamboats on which the trade of Echuca greatly de- pends will still remain idle, owing to the absence of their wonted cargoes, and in their absenco tho Darling business will tend more than over towards Adelaide. If ever there was a Government under tho sun of which it might bo said that it lived only to "moddlo and muddle," surely it is that presided over by Mr. ÜEKIIY. _________________________ There was a probability of the Budget statement being made this week, but under present arrangements a postponement seoms inevitable. The discussion of the Ministerial Iieform Bill will bo commenced on Tuesday. It is usual, when the introducer of a bill has spoken on the first reading, for him to move the second reading pro forma, but aa Mr. Berry was answered by Mr. Service and has been criticised by the press, he will take the opportunity of making a reply, and of further advocating the measure. Ho will be fol- lowed at an early period by the Attorney General, and the wholo of tho week will be steadily devoted to the discussion. No oppor- tunity for the Budget will therefore occur, hut there is a reasonable presumption of the financial statement being mado the following week, The Legislative Council will have Sir Charles Sladen's Bill before it this week, so that both Chambers will be grappling with the burning question of the day. The Chief Secretary, on his return to town on Saturday, found tho resignation of the lion. II. Cuthbert of his office as PoBtmaster Gcncral awaiting him. The subject will bo dealt with at a meeting of the Cabinet to-day, when tho Minister of Public Works will be gazetted to the office without salary, in order that no inconvenience may arise in the . transaction of public business until the vacancy is properly filled. The polling for Dundas takes place to-day. Mr. Laidlaw's friends are very confident about his return, but Mr. Sergeant has made an active cam ass, mid as ho has to a great . extent abandoned Berryism, and might be adopted by either side, he is by no means out of tiie running. The new nile ranges at Williamstown were i formally opened on Saturday by Lady Bowen, v ho fired the first shot. The weather waa I bitterly cold, with a strong wind, and this , prevented the attendance of visitors being t cry largo. Subsequently the Vice-regal party and a number of guests were entertained at luncheon by the council of tho V.R.A., 'Colonel Anderson, C.M.G., tho president of ' the association, occupying the chair. Among lho guests were several members of the "Ministry. Prior to tho luncheon an address . of welcome was presented to the Governor by the major and councillors of Williams ? town, to which Sir George Bowen returned =a suitable reply. After the ranges had been opened, about 220 competitors fired in the -opening match, the winner o£ the first prize proving to be Sergeant Limerock, S.K.A. "'Everj thing passed off very satisfactorily -owing to the excellent arrangements made '.by Captain Blannin, tho bon. seerotary of the 'V.R.A. Tho Minister of Lands, after his visit to the proposed new general cemetery at Franks rton on Saturday (of which some particulars ?are given elsewhere), intended to havo pro- ceeded the same day to Phillip Island, in .order to inspect Cape Woolamai, and deter .rninc for himself whether tho recent sale of '320 acres to Mr. Cleeland should be con- firmed. The trip had to bo abandoned on v-ccount of the stormy weather. Should , the Minister decido, as ho possibly may î-do, to let the sale Btand good, he [-ought certainly to reserve a four-ohain road .between the allotments, so as to provide ! the public with abundant means of nccess , to the front of the Cape.

A three-chain road s round the allotments and a narrow way be rtweon them only look well on a ikt sheet of I Paper. I iTÍ!° Lan^8 Commission will sit to-morrow | « 10 o'clock in the old Trcasury-buildings. It 4 is understood that tho first matter to be dealt | with is the chargo made by Mr. M'Lean, i Uown lands bailiff at Echuca, against Mr. . isyron Moore and Mr. A. C. Allan. M'Lean stated that because he had been the mema «exposinga BjBtem of dummyiain, ho had ( Wen harassed by being moved about from «?strict to district without adequato reason. l'ortie treatment Messrs. Moore and Allan were, he said, responsible. The whole matter «ill be inquired into by the commission. On Saturday morning a meeting of state school teachers was held at the Tomperance Hall for the purpose of considering " matters of importance affecting the profession." Over 230 persons, amongst whom were several ladies, were present. Mr. P. Whyte presided. The meeting was a private one, but we under stand that the recent schedule issued by the Minister of Education. dealing with teachers' salaries, was the chief subject of discussion. This schedule was very freely condemned, and a determination was evinced to use every legitimate means to induce the Minister to suspend its operation pending further con sideration. Itwas agreed that the constant changes by regulations to which th teachers had been subjected had shown the necessity for union on a broader basis than hitherto attempted, and it was resolved that a union to embrace all state school teachers be esta blished with the following objects, namely-(1) To maintain the social status of the profession, (2) to endeavour to carry out such measures as will benefit the profession, as a whole, (3) to afford mutual assistance and protection. Over 200 teachers subscribed their names as members of the union. Any teacher not having signed may do so at the Temperance hall on Saturday next, between 11 and 12, when tho secretary will be present. The following gentlemen were elected a commit- tee (with power to choose their own officers) to carry out the union and memorialise the Minister, viz -Mr P Whyte, Central Schools, Major E. Parnell, Latrobe street west, Mr James Smith, Emerald Hill, Major S Trythall, Collingwood, Messrs Ross Cox, Sandridge; W. Willmott, Carlton; T Ford, St Vincent place, Emerald Hill; C Ulbrick, Williamstown; L N Shepherd, Fitzroy; J Crotty, Emerald hill (School 1,253); S Row, Emerald hill (School 222); J Glad- stones, Kew; C Wilson; T J Connor, South Yarra. Messrs Whyte, Will mott, and Connor wero chosen chairman, treasurer, and secretary respectively. From our Geelong correspondent we learn that a number of school teachers met in the class room of the Mechanics Institute on Saturday afternoon, to consider the recent reductions in salaries made by the Education department. It was decided to send a deputa- tion to the Minister of Education, with the view of having the case of the teachers re- considered, as many of them believed that they had been harshly treated.

yard m which it had been built to the 50-ton crane, in order to its being placed in position on boord the Bteam dredge that was launched the same day But the whurf sido road was so soft that the moving of tho boiler was a matter of some difficulty Plates of iron wero placed under the wheels of the truck to facilitate the Btart, and l8 strong dray horses attached to it when with much Bhout ing and cracking of whips the horses went off at a trot, pulling splendidly But the ground was so heavy that they could not complete their job at ono effort, and there was a halt before they got half way, and then a long delay while the truck wheels wero being raised out of the mud by means of screw jacks In the end tho job was accom pliahed without accident, but as similar transports will often have c5, bo effected it will become necessary to laj down a lino of rails to connect tho foundries and ship yards in the neighbourhood with the ciane Less than half a mile of railway would do for the present, and the rails could be ex tended as the business of tho port increased, and new engine Bhops, _c , established them selves on the south bank of the river, w Inch is certain to bo the head quarters of the Melbourno marino boiler and engine making and repairing trades in the future Un a railway, half a dozen horses could ensilj have done tho work that l8 found difiicultj m performing on Saturdaj Or a small locomotive might bo maintained for such jobs once tlio rails wero 'aid The rails would offor no impediment to ordinary traffic-tliej would be levol with tho roadway and dray wheels would pass over and nevei feel them Iho matter is deserving of the eorly attention of the trust Charity Bernions wero preached in most of the Roman Catholic churches in the citj and suburbs jesterday

and after the 1st prox the morn- ing tram from Sandhurst to Echuca will start at a quarter past 4, instead of a quarter to 5 a.m as at preBcnt In connexion with this change, the Denili- quin and Moama

the proposal of tlio Government to invite tenders for tho Bupply of 200,000 railway sleepers, the Riva me Ila all sees onlj an evaBionof the promised removal of the red gum duty It sayB -"We should havo no objection to urge against the Government calling for tenders for sleepers, if this were done in the ordinary course, and under the usual circumstances, but if ia mtendedsimply as an act of benev olence, after the example of the useless works îecentlj undertaken in the neighbourhood of Melbourne to stop tho clamour of tlie unemployed, we submit that it will not meet the difficulties that have arisen, and that it is not a1 all what the in- habitants of Echuca have been asking for 'Ihey aro quito content that such restnc tiona should bo imposed as will pre vent tho reckless destruction of timber, but, subject to these restrictions, they ask that tho trade should bo free, and that the Bawmill owners should not be confined to one market If the Victorian Railway de- partment reallj need 200,000 sleepers, it is quite right that tenders should be in- vited for them, but we mnj point out that to retain the export duty is hardly likely to conduce lo their being obtained on the most advantageous terms If the Echuca millowners aie to enter into the competí tion most of the timber must be procured from the other side of tlie river, and it is not reasonable to suppose that the Govern- ment of New South Wales will permit that timber to be taken without lundranco for the benefit of a colony which guards its own so jealously that it will permit none lo leav e it 'lins ia one aspect of tlie case But it is onlj au incidental one What w e desire to urge is, that Mr Berrj should not go back from the promises which ho and Mr Lalor made to the deputation on Tues daj Let the millowners be restrained from using the forests wostefully, but allow them the n¿ht of choosing their own markets If thoy aro to under- stand that they aro to be restricted to sup plj ing the Gov eminent of Victoria, and must compete amongst themselv es for this pm liege, and that ev cn this concession is a mere tem- porary expedient not granted from a sense of justice, but with the object of providing work for those who need it, we aro sadly afraid that the congratulations wo indalged in a day or two ago will prove to have been premature, and that the restoration of our most important local industry is no nearer accomplishment than before the deputation went to town " The Echuca Advertise) mentions thatbn Thursday last the mayor of Echuca sent a telegram to the Chief Secretary at the re quest of the unemployed sawmill mon, earnestly begging lum to at once order the collector of customs at Echuca to let all red- gum timber pass free of duty, so that they might obtain employment As the river season is partly over, and alvvajs short, it was very important to these men not to loso time Tlio Chief Secretary on tho following day replied as follows -" Duty can onlj bo repealed bj an Act of Par hament Cabinet has determined to call for tenders immediately for 200,000 sleepers 'lins will give relief pending legislation _ ho maj or replied that this telegram had just been communicated to tho workmen, who, "while they exprcas thanks for your consideration, express themselves confidently that, w ere j ou to suspend collection of duties, Pailiament would readily endorse your action, and it would have the effect of giving many men at the mills and in the barges and Btcamboats immediate employment, and they again respectiv elj urge their request on your favourable and mi mediate consideration to suspend the collection of duties ' Adv ices by the schooner Isabella, which re- cently arm edatPortM'Kay from theSolomon IslandB, brings the report of the murder of a

be tho first out- rage of tho kind committed by tho in habitants of the island Tor j ears past Captam Eeiguson, of Sydney, has alvvajs had a man stationed at thia island, and he has traded peaceably with tho nativ es, and lived, it was supposed, in perfect security Latterly, Captain Swart7 stationed a man named Townsend and a boy on tho weather side of the island, but there was no native village near the plato, and it is therefore unlikely that the victim is connected with Captain Swart? s enterprise A Mr Wright, connected with a New Zealand firm who are engaged largely in tho trade, was also stationed on the îslnnd Tho only other resident of the place was Mr John Stevens, of Sydney, who has for j ears been a resident of tina placoi trading for Captain Torguaon and Mesara' Cowlishaw
