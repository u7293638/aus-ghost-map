The Confessions of a Mor mon High Priest. Hawktnt, an ex-hlgh priest of the Mormon per suasion, and 'formerly a member of titie Danite band, has arrived in London' : for the ex press purpose of exposing what he forcibly, if somewhat inelegantly, calls ' the Jffioimon fraud.' Ex-high priest Hawkini is, an Italian by birth, but a typical Yankee in appearance, Until 18S0 lie followed -fie business of a trunk-maker - in Utah; but, getting disgusted with Mormonism as a social institution, 'he in that year 'made preparations to escape. His office in the Church was one or considerable importance. There are probably ' more grades in the Mbr 'mon priesthood than in that of any other Church on earth. First of all come the deacons, who '? attend to chapel duties,' whatever they may niean. Then come^the teachers, who, be sides discharging the; office of -city missionary, look after the collection of the tithes. To these succeed ? the priests, who preach and '- ' ad ?ininister,' but eannotlay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. That power, however, resides in the. elders, who ' preach, teach, and administer the sacrament«;'' in the '?'-seventies,' who are sent on foreign missions ; and in the high priests, whose duties are somewhat' vague, but who 'take the lead ' at any lneetingat which they happen to be present. Above all these, who may be classed together as the smaller fry of the Mormon 'system, stand the bishops, one of whom — tried some time ago for his share in what is known as the Mor risite massacre — is now preaching the Gospel in England* 'the 12 apostles,' the two counsellors, and the president, the latter of whom- has re icently been ' sealed' to his 18th wife, a bloom ing Massachusetts: widow, who, on going home and finding another Mrs. Taylor on the doorstep, incontinently, smote that lady on the head with a l broom. According to the account which he -very I obligingly ? gives of himself, ex- High Priest | Hawkini escaped from Utah at great peril of bis life. He had to run the gauntlet of his former colleagues of -the -Danite band. Nor was 5ie un aware of the risks that he would have to encounter. On Ms first reception as a Mormon, ait the end of a marriage ceremony which lasted for more than nine hours, he was compelled to swear that he ' would revenge the blood of Joseph and Hiram. Smith on tlie nations of the earth,' under, the penalty of having his throat cut from ear to ear ; tliat he would do whatsoever he was ? commanded by the Church, under the penalty of being disembowelled -. and that he would, bring up his children 'to hate those who are against us,' under the penalty of having his legs cut oiff at his knees. This remarkably heavy swearing was by no means a mere formal mat ter, to be gone through once and forgotten. The Danite band has a very severe sense of the binding nature of an oath, and very sudden and awful methods of dealing with those who are foresworn. Ex-High Priest -Hawkini asserts that when he attempted to leave Utah three separate attempts were made on the lives of himself and his wife. Even in England they . a-r-e, warned against the plots of their enemies. 'I am obliged, for the sake of your lives, to tell you that the Danites are on your track,' says a letter from Utah. ' Be careful where you eat arid drink. The .day I write a man was: shot for leaving the. Church. ' Bis body was found in Big Gulch. He was going . to Glasgow to expose Mormonism, and had prepared a manuscript for the purpose.' This summary manner of dealing with 'apostacy. seems to be frightfully' common^ in' spite of 'the' 'presence of the United States soldiery; Those who betray any slackening in tfae - faith are immediately '^handed over to the buffetings of Satan,1' ''and then,' says High Priest Hawking manfully repres sing a slight shudder, ' it's a case withthem.' The Danite band, which is charged to administer the Satanic buffetings, approaches the dimen sions of a 'small army. There was a band of 27 Danites in the Eleventh Ward in 1SS0, and there are 21 wards in, the city of Salt Lake, ? which the Mormons unblushingly speak of as Zion. The members ? are ? armed. - with . .bowie-knives, - brass knuckles, revolvers and clubs loaded with lead. . WHen. they have any serious business in hand, they are called together, generally at midnight, J and marched to the City Hall, where a prayer is -offered up that the Xibrd, will deliver' into their' hands ?' those who would destroy His-Zion in the latter days,', and thus,, with a prayer, and a blessing, they are despatched on their mur derous work. Among the doctrines of Mormonism there':. axe 'some' 'that, wiffi great' 'wisdom,' it's' apostles do not venture .-to ? make . public in England. The most fearful of these is that which declares' in favour of. ' blood atone ment,' The work of seeing that such atone ,ment ' is 'made is .usually; i entrusted to the. i;I-anite band, but- occasionally the commission of* ^Siirder. is enjoined on private members pi .the /?linrhiTi. TKcTPt -is an illustration, in 1875 a mar ried woman had.cpnfessed .to an offencefor which the blood atonement was the, decreed penalty, ,and her' husband was ordered to becomfe her exeT.

Last year,' he .adds, *r 125 English girls arrived at Salt Lake City,, and only in ten .cases did their parents know what had become of them.' Thus, under coyer of a frightful religion, there is prac-, tised in London arid throughout England a sys tem of deception, that is only comparable in its results to those Belgian abductions which so recently moved the horror and the indignation of ijie English people. The method of ' sealing' in the Mormon Church seems devised to specially impress the minds of girls who inayfhus be lured away. The ceremony of the 'endowment,' as it is called, which usually lasts from seven o'clock in the morning to about four in the afternoon, is,. if ex-High Priest Hawkini may 'bebelievedi blas phemous almost beyond the powe* of imagination. The bride and bridegroom are bathed and anointed, and afterwards 'endowed' with white garments, an apron of fig-leaves, and a 'new name.' Led through one room after another; they listen, awe-stricken, whilst ''Elohim' re-, peats passages of Scripture to the Archangel Michael in the darkness. In turn they are intro duced to Adam and Eve, to Satan (who squirms about on. the floor in token of Ms defeat), and to the' Apostle Peter, who snips pieces from the wedding raiment with a pair of scissors ! The ceremony is completed by^taMng oaths, to which reference has already been made. .
