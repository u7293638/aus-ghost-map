Charity to all Christians. On Pentecost Sunday in St. Mary's Cathedral the Cardinal took his text from the Gospel of the day, and the main portion of his sermon had reference to the coming of the Holy Ghost, and the special gifts imparted to the Apostles and perpetuated in the Church. One of the most distinguished statesmen or Jiingland in our day had given ex pression to the sentiment that ' to serve Christ and Christianity was the most heroic deed that man could accomplish in our day.' He would wish that these words wero emblazoned in every Christian household throughout this fair land. It might seem strange that he should say they must love those who were not of the fold. He did not wish his words to be misunderstood. They saw around them those who misrep resented Catholic teaching and calumni ated the Catholic Church, and it was no wonder that those educated in the midst of this prejudice should believe those calumnies and wage war against the Church. He, however, should not say that they waged war against the Church ; he should rather say that they waged war against a phantom falsely set up in the name of the Church. They should therefore not blame those who were attacking this phantom, believing it to be Catholic truth and teaching. They were really our brothers in arms, one with us in spirit, and with us were fighting the battle of truth and of faith in fighting this plantom ; and in doing so they were really serving the cause of truth and the Church. The peoplo of th-}' Catholic communion should love them, and should pray that God would send them the grace to see the beauty of Catholic truth, and that he would gather them into tho fold of the one true Shepherd. They should all pray to God to keep alive in their hearts the fire of Divine charity.
