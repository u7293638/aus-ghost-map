THE CONSCIENCE AND FUTURE JUDG MENT. I sat alone with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, Aud we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased, And I felt I should have to answer The question it put to me, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Come floatiner before mv sight. And things that I thought were dead things, Were alive with a terrible might, And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face — Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly-silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the Judgment day to be, But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future . To this land beyond the grave ; And no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday — And I pray that I may not forget it, In this land beyond the grave ; That I may not cry in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a iesson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learnt it dreaming, I hope to forget no more. Se I sit alone with my conscience In the place where the years increase, And I try to remember the future, In the land where time will cease ; And I know of the future Judgment, How dreadful soe'er ir be. That to sit alone with my conscience WUl be judgment enough for me /
