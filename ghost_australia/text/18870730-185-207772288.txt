CATHOLIC AROSTOLIC CHURCH. After a brief summary of the previous two lectures, showing the original constitution of the church under the Apostles in the first age, and her subsequent declension, the lecturer proceeded to describe the nature of the gifts of prophecy and speaking witii tongues as these existed in the early Church. lie then went on to show that the spiritual move ments in the Church at the beginning of this century had taken tlio form of seeking from the Lord Jesus Christ, the outpouring of the latter rain of spiritual grace upon the Christian Church; that tiiis had resulted about tlie year IS3O, in the restoration both in England and Scotland, of the gifts of healing, prophecy, andspeakiug with tongues; and that this had led on to the restoration of the Apostolic olkce, and with it the com plete fourfold ministry of the Christian Church, consisting of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, and Pastors; and to the organ ization of churches under angels or bishops of like character and staudiug as the Seven Churches iu Asia. That after the separation of the Apostles in July, 1535, they had been commanded by word or prophecy, to prepare a testimony and deliver it to all the heads of Church and State in Christendom, that this testimony of what the Lord was doing in Hi* Church, had been prepared; and as far as possible delivered to every Emperor, King, ruling Prince, and Bishop. The lecturer thon stated that iu the light of prophecy, Christendom was divided iuto 12 opinions or tribes; to each of of which an Apostle was appointed; aud that the Apostles were bidden to search the tribes of the Christian Church for the truth of Cod contained in each portion of the Church. The lecturer then proceeded to show that this had resulted in the cleuriug and estab lishment of the ancient doctrines of the Church, and in the formation of au order of Chinch worship, full of spiritual beauty, yet pure from superstition, and evidently identical with that which was ottered in the early Church; and that tiie Apostles had found iu all lands those who could receive their ministry, aud that the same spiritual gifts with which this work had commenced were manifested unceasingly in all parts of the world where there were companies of be lievers gathered under tiie Apostles, who had received the gift of the Holy Ghost through the laying on of their hands. The lecturer remarked that this work was not sectarian, but that the Apostles had been restored to the whole Church, and not only to those who had received them; and that the gathering of special congregations was rather a necessity forced upon them by the general nou-aeceptance of tiiuir ministry by those iu authority than any essential feature of their work; and that their work was to testify to all Christian men on behalf of the Lord Jesus Christ, who has been kept out of His kingdom by the divisions of His Church, the usurpations of mem, aud tiie general lack of desire for His second coming. The lec ture concluded with a notiucation that the last lecture of the course on the subject of the “Sealing,” will he delivered next Fri day.
