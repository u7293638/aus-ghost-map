Ijocfs -£etncr. ECHOES. Ofttimcs wheu even's scarlet flag Floats from the crest of distaut wood?. And over moorland waste and crag A weary, voicen.c3s sorrow brood?, i Aronnd tne hover to aud fro The ghosts oF songs heard long ago. And often, midst the rush of wheels, Of parsing and repaseing feet, When half a hcadioug city reels Triumphant down the iioontidc strc:fc. Above the tumult of the throngs I hear again the same old songs. Rest and Unrest — 'tis strange that j'e. Who lie apart as pole from pole, Should sway with one strong sovereignty The secret issues of the soul ; Strange that ye both should hold the fceys Of prisoned tender memories. Tt- «?-?« fin irlinn flip, laiirlfipa tie's rim Is red and slumberous round the west, The spirit too grows still and dim, And tarns in half unconscious quest To those forgotten lullabies That whilom closed the infant's eyes. And maybe, when the city mart Roars with its fullest, loudest ti3e, The spirit loses helm and chart. And on an instant, terrifiefl, Has fled across the space of year* To notes that banish childhood's fears. We know not — but 'tis sweet to know Dead hours sti'l haunt the living day. And sweet to hope that, when the slow Sure message beckons us away, The past may send some tuneful breath To echo round the bed of death. — Chambers' s Journal,
