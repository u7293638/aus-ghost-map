Bat ah I they plagued me with a will And skill for irritating, TJntil I sawon yonder hill Some eattle ruminating* Andwith them there those vagrants / :v ' . — 1 The cause ofSabbath breaking— A whistling snort and then away O'er groundto hoof-strokes qaaking. The mob dash'd off at racing speed, Heads up and tails out streamings But Teaser jd$t devoured space O'er bsulders hotly gleaming. Fast jotting rocks, through blind ;Andmulgasall went crashing. Till soon that pair of quadrupeds With stockwhip I was lashing, Then swiftly swerving here and there Together then I got them, And keeeping up their headlong bat From out the mbb I shot them. But presently on sylvan track I had them fairly steady, While thinking ho w when I got back I should be more than ready For damper, beef, and boiled black *tea, "• ' ; Fit pabulum for emu, Which then right well agreed with me, Whe'd relish e'en a seamew. Thirst next thing occupied my mind, And quite resolved ondrinking, I turned towards a creek to find The beverage—when, slinking, Bed dingo met my startled sight - As trotting close behind us, He really seemed delighted quite As^company tofind us. From burning thirst his eyes were red, His tongue far down was hanging > Said 1,1 I'll knock you on the head ! . No sheep, henceforth, a gang in Shall you, my friend, for bloodshed stick . , And^ barring, say, a buster, My heels upon your hide I'll kick, Yourtail shall be a duster. Old Teaser needed not the spur Or whip-thong on him falling, Too bent was he to catch that cur, And soon was overhauling The Squatters Joe, that now lay out To make the gum creek, winding Beneath it'sbroken bank, no doubt A hole intent on finding. He gAin'd the creek, but close behind on his footfiteps follow'd, No cover he had time to find In bank, or great gpm hollowM. So out again on open plain Heboundedwitha rattle, I, thinking nbt bo tighten rein Or glance round for my Cattle, But went as fast as Teaser could, And evidently faster Than all poor * wilka's members would Th^n carry off their master. \- Hurrah 1 hurrah ! we've got him • BOW •' ' As sure as eggs are eggs, sir.' He doubled back it seems somehow, 'Twixt Teaser'a very legs, sir. *Native name for dingo. Now both again, at tip top speech | For very life are racing, And Teaser,withthe greater greed, The dingo is outpacing, But headlong over ugly bank Of great creek, all are diving, We ranging on the varment's flank. When 'mongst the stones arriving. Hand over hand we're gaining ground, My stock whip I gm s winging The wild dog's well mark'd ribs to pound . - \- With thong strokes loudly ringing. A few strides more, old horse, and . then •' • ■ ■ V We'll give him his quietus ; But ah ! into a bankside dense He bolts to fairly beat us. Vexation ! Only think of it! When he was fairly beaten, J ust gathered fruit, of which a bit A nigger could-have eaten, I And might yet eat if only I - From out that hole could poke him, At any rate I could but try, Or failing that, to smoke him. From Teaser's tack I blunder'd down, My bridle reins neglecting, ' Thus acting like a simple clown Who grief might be expecting. I saw that dog, no need of scent, * This heavy stone will do him !' He bolted out, and off he went And I could not pursue him. _ Except afoot, for on the plain My horse was slowly walking, I felt that I might call in vain, So started off horse stalking; He led me here, he lled me there, At times I thought I'd caught him, So sidled up, and spoke him fair, Then hissed out what I thought him. But all io vain, for trailing rein ; His forelegs would not tangle; And soon I saw with rage and pain, For him I heed not angle. v~ Yet still pursued him up and down O'er hills and plains, too stony, Till l, just e'er the; sun went down Near knocked up 'ShanksV pony! For by that time the heat and flies Had made me sad and weary; While perspiration filled my eyes \- • Till smarting much and bleary; My feet were sore, my thorax dry, Habiliments all soaking ; Nine miles from home, and, by-the-by, New boots ! and future joking I To empty sheep hut standing nigh . > I bent my way to forage, And in the tank unto my eye Appeared some thin, warifrfttrridge. But how was I to get it out, As nauseaus draught to try it, There was no twine-hntig tin about, My boot would not reach nigh it 3 f To shepherd's spouse that tank seemed small, . To me far too capacious; No tap appeared in rusty wall, A circumstance vexations. But then the orifice on top Was round and fairly roomy, I found my head it would not stop, So muttered 1 It will do me.1 One arip, of coai^ iQclading wriat, * .
