Bonded Memel timber is shipped in England for Canada, unshipped there ? resliippcd ? and imported again into England, for the sake only of siving the dirTerence^between the duties on timber from America and that from the Baltic. Jf this difference of duty were .really intended for the benefit: of the ship- owners; the consumer would be benefitted if, instead of the voyage from the Baltic and the double voyago to and from Canada, the1 duties were equalised, provided all English1 ships importing timberjrom the Baltic touched on their w/zy at Nowfoundlana. The practice to which mercanti/eCkigenuily hat resorted to escape the pressure -of pl*ect/ve legis lation is onu of the severest saUtes l^coufd^bu de vised on the system, the details otFwhich in this case seem to be asabsurdas- tin f-mciple.— Cork Paper,
