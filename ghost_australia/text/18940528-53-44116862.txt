Since his eon S > damnation he has been visited by his ^mother, an elderly woman, who resides 'in Victoria. She has signed the v petition begging for his reprieve Annie M. Carroll, his broken-hearted 1 ' mother.0 She bears a number of testimonials as to character, one of which is signed by the Rev. Mr. . - Heathershaw, Primitive Methodist minister of Carlton., His letter states that Williams was brought ap : aa a Wesleyan boy and waa a raga* lar attendant ac Sunday Behool. It ~ - -declares that he is the only one of the \- , family who is not highly respectable, v and bia misdeeds are attributed to bad companionship. The Rev. Mr. Isaac, Baptist minister of West Melbourne, *. also testifies to the thorough respect \- ability of Mrs. Carroll and other mem- bers of her family. He adds that \- -Williams was always "the black sheep* of the flock." The petition to be presented by Mrs. Carroll states that during her son's boy / hood his moral and v religious training \- waa faithfully attended to, and while \- nuder direct control he was well ï behaved. He worked as a black c smith in Melbourne until he yielded " to the evil influence unhappily acquired -"- bom bia associates, after which he fell into bad courses. It adds that he has '.J.* wü* and two children of tender years. One clause in the petition says that, although Montgomery is an utter ; stranger to her, the unhappy mother r ' pleads for merciful consideration in his \:[ case also. Mention is likewise made or the fact that the jury recommended \- ..Williams to mercy. The document ~ waa handed to the Premier this morning. The whole of the dozen jurors who \- tried the condemned men. have now ~ signed the public petition, which con ' tains over 20,000 signatures. ( Since the arrival of his mother \- Williams has completely broken down. The interview between mother and son ia stated to have been touching. The son. pleaded with bis mother to use aU the exertions in her power to A save his neck. Montgomery, who is a courageous . man and has proved himself to be -, remarkably loyal to bis confederates in ¿ j^erime-characteristics which have " attracted the attention of the Premier \- -says : " If the Government thinks it ia doing a good thing by hanging me V: they are welcome. I meant no morder. -'.HI did I would have used every barrel in my revolver, and no one ; would have been left to tell the tale. ' Whatever the result, I will fall like a man. The coward who ran from us . ..waa the man who pat as ap to the "vjob. He knew Sydney. He is not worth living, but still I will not split on hun. He was a treacherous wretch, .and did not warn os even against oar near approach to the police station.''
