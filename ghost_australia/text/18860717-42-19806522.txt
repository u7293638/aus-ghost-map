Religious Mission Services. CHURCH OF ENGLAND. THE Church of England Mission, which had been preached during the previous week by the Revs. Charles Bodington and George E. Mason, came to an end last Sunday evening at St. John's Pro-OÂ»thedral, where, at the end of the service, the large congregation, consisting of nearly 600 persons, solemnly renewed their baptismal vowa, answering to the questions usually put in the christening service. The Bishop, who was present, addressed a few parting words of thanks, and expressed, on behalf of himself and people, his deep thankfulness to the reverend roissioners for their exercise of the sifts of the Holy Ghost with which God had so abundantly blessed them. He thanked them for their many true and earnest words, so thoroughly in accord with the mind of the Church, so truly evangelical, and so stirring to all who had heard them, which words might, he prayed, take deep root in all their hearts, and spring up and bring forth fruit in good living, to the honour and glory of God. The missioners left Brisbane for England by the Dake of West minster on Tuesday last. The Rev. Nathaniel Dawes, M.A., was in ducted by Bishop Webber to the rectory of St. Andrew's, South Brisbane, on Sunday morn ing. The sermon in the morning was preached by the Bishop, and that in the evening by the new rector. Mr. Dawes is considered, by those who heard him on Sunday, to be an extempore preacher of considerable power.
