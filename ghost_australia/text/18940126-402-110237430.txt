THE PEOPLE OF CURVES AND ZIGZAGS. The Egyptians, and after them the Greeks, idealised the straight line. The Chinese have idealised the curve and zigzag, notably in their national emblem, the dragon. Every straight passage in the cities and towns of China has a board at the mouth, on which is painted a powerful charm consisting of eight diagrams surrounding the circle intersected with curved lines, which stands for the primordial egg of the universe. Under this is written the words, ' Barest thou withstand the stone from the Tai moun- tain ?' Their field paths, as the benighted foreigner knows, are formed of curves as in- tricate as those of the old fretwork puzzles. Every continuous straight line is a sort of lower world lightning conductor, inviting in no innocuous manner the dreaded influences of the 'hell under the earth.' Demons move in straight lines. And so according to the accepted notions do corpses that have been resuscitated by the breath of some domestic animal. These, actuated by the lower soul, the p'eh (the spirit of the beast, Eccles. iii. 21)—the higher (hwun) being dissipated—are apt to rise and give chase to their former friends. Such an unpleasant occurrence may be pre- vented by keeping the chickens, cats, dogs, and pigs away from where the newly de- deceased man lies—a precaution observed in most Chinese homes, or, should it happen, the pursuer has to be dodged. In the late summer festival, too, when the gates of Hades are open, haunting ghosts are disposed of by being led along mazes of streets, preferably in the small hours, guided by the sounds of gongs and cymbals, and the light of burning cash paper or of lotus-like lamps. Or they are sent away by water, guided by the same lamps floated on the sur- face of the river, preferably at places where its curves bewilder them.
