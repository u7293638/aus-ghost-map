THE MIECHANICS' INS'I'I'TUTE. To tie Edilor of tke TelegrapA; Sir,-Can you inform me whether the buiTding nea: flie Town Hall, Prralirn, on which is written "Mechanics' Institute," is really at the present time a literary institu tion, or only the ghost of a departed one of by-gone ldays? Would not a liternry institution modelled, or remodelled somewhat after the MIelbourne Athenmum (formerly the Mechanics' Institute) exert an excellent influence on both young and old, whom it should invite and be inviting to ? Would it not form a fitting complement to our ex cellent town library, which,. excellent though it isin its way; cannot extend its usefulness in so many ways as the Melbourne Athenaeum is doing, and oie iti Prahran might, by means of a circulating library, evening classes, lectures, and socially in structive meetings? Hoping that the attention of others may be directed.to this subject till some good is done, I am, Yours, &c.;, DIOGENES.
