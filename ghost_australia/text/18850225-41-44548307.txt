', During the last .three or lour ] months over forty of its members have gond' to Melbourne and Sydney, where tha'btuld- ' ing trade is brisk, many of theae men having been assisted to leave by-tthe: Society. : - Yery few members,;hardly a dozen, in Adelaide and the? Port are^ unemployed, th& great bulk of the dfiengaged'carpenterB and joiners being those who have not cast in their lot with the Society. 'There .are said, to be over fifty carpenters' unemployed; aP laTgs-Inumber of their comrades, .having already left for other colonies. The Society came to an agree ment.with the masters some time ago that mxmontha^riotice should be given by either - aida,'bef ore 'either wages or rules should be altered, but ins spite ' of this understanding the- masters' are- stated' to have reduced wagfiB * very considerably, the rate having dropped about 10 per. cent, during the last six months. .As an instance of the present depression, it'inay be stated that the leading builders in town bad only about fifteen car penters - ?and-.' four- ior five masons at work; 'while ; in1 -fairly good times ther i employ '. between forty and fifty carpenters, i not ? . to '. ;Bpeak pf the other operatives -who are engaged by them. Some carpenters have even been working at the Port for theXkfcrerriment as labourers at 6s.. a day- rather* than remain idle. In the Mount Lofty 'alnd Aldgate district there ia enly. one-contract on hand where last year a couple/of hundred men were employed. In ♦he face ;of this distress the. workmen con tend ithat. rent. has. increased rather than decreased, and holi that a rise in the amount fiaid by, them is not justifiable when their present depressed condition ia considered. The masona and bricklayers are in no better condition than the -carpenters and joiners. Depression -fcoe^ithe : one .class; necessarily means distresslf or the other.: The former class of . operatives have also their trade Society* the only. : difference being that the; Masona' and . jBricklayera1 Society ia a local organization, :iBtarted about five 5 ears ago,:whUe the: Amalgamated Carpenters and Joiners' Society ensta in1 aE. parts of the British. Empire. At the Iaat audit taken in August the Masona' and Bricklayers' Society had 346 men- on the rolls— 80 at Port Ade laide, 40 at Port. Augusta, and the remainder in the dry. - Trade naabeenrao bad at Port Augusta— only five men .being in permanent employment there— that, ths branch there has cpracticallyi: .yielded np the ghost. About three months ago bo many complaints -were received at: head-quarters of non -emDloyment that i it was resolved to set apart £100; for the purpose of assisting the dis . engaged members* to get away to adjacent colonies. About forty have already taken advantage.of this vote; three or four leaving for Melbourne by every- boat, and applica tions for assistance 'are now more numerous than ever. This meeting also came' to an agreement with the: Masters' Association that the wages should be 10s. a day to average workmen, but although the principal- masters still pay this rate, it is -alleged that the smaller employers nave broken through tha role. It is stated that the Society has lost a hundred members during the last six months through the scarcity of employment. A score went; to Western Australia under: private contract, and -the ? balance have sought work in Melbourne: or elsewhere. Eifty bona-fide masona and bricklayers are stated to be idle ill town and with no prospect of employment foe Borne time to come. At Port Adelaide trade is equally bad, and a proportionate - number of ; men are 'there vainly seekingf or ' something to do. Plasterers and stonecutters ? are L in an . even. I worse position than - their fellow- workmen, the whole number now. . employed - being ? estimated - at less - than: twenty ? I instead of between ; T 100 ' and 150, the . normal number when times are good.; -These) operatives are: said to be leaving the colony in a wholesale manner, ? principally for Melbourne, where wages ate good, and stonecutters particularly are in request. ? 'AnnthOT^ class sof^ operatives who- are suffering very' severely are the engineers^ As an instance of this fact it majr be stated that Messrs. Norwood, Downs, and Ca, a. leading firm in the city, cannot ? even find full employment for thirty-seven men and boys at the -present -time, while twelve months ago they had' constant -work for nearly lOOiin-iexcess of that -number. - Boiler-makers ;:find fairly^ constant ^- em- ; .ployment i considering the general dnl -nesa s: of : - the \ tamesi = but f; s this -t: state- ? ment I does aibt7 -applyt -^to* i-';printers;-' who are in a. bad: way.

THE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIET?. ,'Ye3,' said Mr. Thompson, the_ Manager 'of the Adelaide Co-orjerative Society, ' we have tangible proof of the depression in the decrease in the number of our . customers. Some ; 2,000 people, mostly tradespeople, do business with ua^ and I should imagine that we have lost between Angnst and January :laat 150 TTorkmea who were formerly con nected with the stores, The distress, I regret :tb' see, seems to have shaken the confidence iof these 'people in the colony, and many of those who have severed their connection with the stores have done_ so because they were leaving South Australia to seek employ ,ment elsewhere. The men so far have hoped on fighting against the bad time3, but they seem now to be determined to make an effort on their own behalf in the other colonies. I quite agree that so far as I have been able to ascertain the distress is greater now than it ? has been for years past.' THE I5S0LVE5CY COTJET.

The return from December 1 to February 24 of thi3.year is as follows: — ?Labourers 6, mechanics 4, tradesmen 14, farmers 12, and miscellaneous 16, or a total of 125 insolvencies from December I to February 24.
