SATURDAY, MARCH 23, 1893. Several ecclesiastical assemblies of late have gravely discussed the question of what to do with ministers who are idle, or incapable, or dull to a degree beyond what is permissible even in a sound divine. And this is a question of much more than purely ecclesiastical interest. A careless barrister ruins his few clients, and then briefs visit him no longer. An ignorant doctor kills one or two patients, and then ceases to be con- sulted or have the opportunity of killing anybody else. But a miracu- lously prosy divine may inflict weekly purgatory upon a much-enduring congregation year after year, and there is no redress except that of a general migration of exas- pointed hearers to other churches. A persistently tedious or foolish preacher inflicts a much larger amount of suffering on his kind than does an equally incapable member of any other profession. Religion, moreover, con- sidered merely as a secular force, is the very salt of society. It acts as a perpetual antiseptic against innumerable social diseases, and any general diminu- tion of its influence would be felt in- stantly in that most sensitive of spots —the taxpayer's pocket. Clergymen are not civil officers, but religion has civil functions of great value ; and even secular society is keenly interested in the maintenance of tis efficiency. The recent Wesleyan Conferences in both Sydney and Hobart discussod with gi cat cnuicstncss tho question of how to doal with mcompotciit ministers, and tlioio is no íeason to supposa that this denomination alono is afflicted with pronchois whoso sonnons aio hard to otiduro All tho chinches, liko Beau lînuMMir, havo their "failures" A black coat is no lnfulliblo sign of cither poifoct wisdom or shining vutuo It is trno that tho general stnndard of zeal, clminttor, and intolligonco amongst tho cloigy of all tho chinchas was nover liiuhor than to day , was poihaps nover bofoio so high IIIIDIMIH Parson 'hullibor is a t)po na o\tmct as tho dodo Du hi \s may havo boon instilled two gonoiiitions ago in his portraits of Stiggms and Chndband, but to day such pictures would bo folt to transgress ovon tho hcoiibo of caiicaluio Nootbot class' in tho lost two centuries Ima risen faster or higher in social respect than the clorgy M YOAULAY declares that m the comedy of the seventeenth century no single mstanco can bo found of a clorgy man who wins a wife above tho rank of a cook DEAN SWIFT, as late as the days of GLOKGE II, wroto that m a great household the chaplain was the last resource of a lady s maid who had lost hor character and had no hopes of capturing the steward No ono can over forgot MAOAULAY'S pictuio of the average parson m tho reign of CnARLis II His chief merit was that in a well to-do family ho saved the expense of a gardoneror a groom "Sometimesthe " reverend man gathered the apucots, " and sometimes he cuined the coach " horses Ho cast up tho farrier's bills " Ho walked ten miles with a messige " or a paicel " As for the clergyman w ith a benéfico, his state was yet moro deplorable The thatch of his par sonago and the fubnc of his singlo cassock wero rent by equally numerous holes Often it was by moio toil on his glebe, " by feeding swino and by lund " ing dung carts," that ho could obtain daily bread and pi event the bnilifis from taking his concoidanco and his inkstand in execution This pictnro may help us to understand how much higher is tho social position and influence of a cleigy man to day than at any previous time in English history And tho ox planation, m part, is that ministers themsolves, as a class, ha\ o rison, too, in scholarship and character and foi ce Ihe boors in cassocks whom 1 ti LDII and Svin satirised, or the slothful and unspuitual clergy who so aftiontod Wi sti \ 's zeal in the last century, aro impossible to day And yet all the churches aro afflicted with divines who beal the same i ela- tion to the church that tho blight docs to the cabbngo 01 bnrnacles to a ship'* bottom 'Ihoy aro buidons undei which congregations groan Thoy aro dull and idle Thoy do not read They cannot pieach They aro bankrupt of moral influence Their discourses lie an affliction too great for human forti tude to endure Thoir tediousnoss in tho pulpit has made tho very wold " sermon " to bo m nil men's cara the moro synonjm of dullness GOLD SMirn's \ iliaco pastor "allured to "blighter woilds and led the wa}," but the pulpit failures over whom the wiser minds in all tho churches sigh " allure " nobody, and they chiofly aficct thoso who liston to thom with a vchoment desire to escapo their com pan} What are the churches to do with suth men?

The Weslo}an Conference at Ilobait, as the result of tho disci 3sion referred to, determined to " locato "-to Jem e, that is, without pastoral charge, though not, the benevolont miud must hope, without some provision-ministers who aro pro\ed to be inefhcicnl 'lins paiticular denomination makes an unwutton contract with its ministers, ensuring them tho enjojment of both parsonaua and pulpit while they do tho work of the elim eli oflcctively But it plainly finds the burden of carrying meflicient ministers a task beyond its strength, and, on giounds of 8implo honest}, if ono branch in this contract between chuich and minister fails the other ought not to bo enforced In other churches when a too tedious divmo has onco obtained a charge ho may keep it, tormenting human cars with his oratorical perform anees till his congregation disappears, or a general uprising of the exasperated flock takes place against a shepherd so distressful There íeally need bo no pulpit " failures " The themes of religion aro so loft}, its realm is so wide, it touches human life and happiness so closely and at so many points, that any minister intellectually honest and diligent, oven did ho po=sess no shining gifts, nuclit }ot preach so that all sonsiblo men could listen with profit Success as a matter of fact is easier in tho clerical profession than in almost any other A clergyman has but to show a reasonable human interest in his flock, to keep his intellect fresh and his eyes open, to preach not his doubts but his faith, and to discharge with wiso diligence tho ordinary duties of the pastorato, and ho will gather round himself friendships and comforts which men in other professions may well envy But tho law of the survival of tho fittest must rulo oven in tho sacred realm of tho church Tho unfit must perish, that the gonornl standard of life may bo on tho ascending scalo And tho church that administers its cleigy on this principio with tho greatest fidelity is certainly tho church to which the futuro belongs Tho tenth voluraoof tho Proceedings of tho London Society foi Psychical Research may bo expected to seno as a tenth nail m tho coffin of our con temporaiy pseudo scientific form of superstition Not that tho roscaichois mean it to bo so On tho contrary, tho object of tho society in issuing this saddening production is to show with what on lrrcproachablencss of

instanco boon subjoetcd to somo abnoimal distillb anco A perusal of the now \olumo of ProuodmgB will probably lead to tho conviction that tho cnuso of such dis- turbance in tho " researching " mind IB only too nppnront, and that it lies in a '' I 'J' ' constitutional predisposition to believe moro or less in spooks, an instinctive tendency to w oleóme tho marvellous In tho ignorant and uneducated mind this predisposition would lead hopelessly to tho silly ecstasies of nocturnal table rapping under tho pastorate of ¡Sludge, but culture devolopes an intellectual conscience, and that conscience clamours for some sort of logical satisfaction oro it feels justified in yielding to the fascinations of what looks so terribly like egiegious superstition Tor this reason mon liko Professor LoDOt feol constrained to collect evidence of ghost and phantom, telepathy, thought ti ans ferenco, aud tho rest, and to satisfy themselves that they are sifting that ovidonce with the mercilessnessof thelaw courts and the impartiality of a Roman father The published documents of tho society show how zealous the re searchers have boon to counteiact their own natural bias towards credulity Unfortunately, the same publications show how unsuccessful their honest efforts have been Naturam expelías fin ca, but its inevitable re intrusion is palpable to that more sceptical world which insists on taking into account the illusions of the human senses, tho fallibility of even the unbiassed memory, the general leaning to marvel niongei ing, and even tho failures of human veiacity In tho case of Professor LODGE and his Icetmes, it is possible to entertain discomforting suspicions even of his geneial roasomng processes 'lhere is a certain Jira Pinn, who goes into trances In lier tranced state, oí un conscious self, she is euphoniously known ns " Phmuit," and tho said "Phinuit" caines on conversations with deceased persona, with whom, as the mero untrancod PiPi.it, she can establish no communication Mr LODI I begins by behoving in the leality of these spiritual dialogues, and than proceeds to theorise concerning the way of then coming to pass True scionco might prefer to commence by making suro of the fact Wo may, however, lot that question pass, though it is not inconsiderable Moro interest nig is the exhibition of pervcisc argu ment whereby Mr LODQL somehow manages to satisfy himsolf Ile draws a paiallel of the most ingenious obaui dity between the state of mind in which a poetic gonius is mspiied with his best poetry, and that in which a medium becomes susceptible to spiritual ira pressions from without In order, sa)s he, to achieve íemaikablo re suits in any department of Intel lectual activity, ' tho mind must bo " to somo extent unawaio of passing " occuironcos " Which saving ia plati tudinously true, if it means thatgieat thoughts, exptessions, inventions, or foimul e can only como of concentiatcd application, of a mind which is, as BACON has it, " intending " itself An oblivion of steam whistles, cr) mg childion, and piano practising, is cor tandy lather conducivo than other wiso to tho steady thinking which is progressing towards some remark ablo creation If Mr LoDor means that absoiption in a particular line of thought, with consequent foigotfillness of exteriors for tho timo boinc, is tho best attitude for the discovory of a groat idea, ho tells us a tiuth which is pro foundly obvious But ho apparently means nothing of the kind, foi fear of spoiling his paiallel Bathei, ho algues, " when a poet, a musician, " or a mathematician feels lum " self inspired, his senses aro, I " suppose, dulled or half asleep," and it is a " rather hazy and nbsoibed " condition which is associated with the " quality of mind called genius " Bul liant results, ho makes bold to assert, aio achioved only by a mind which is not oxactlv " on tho spot " According to this doctrine inspiration might as well bo sought at onco (oven " m "spnation" for mathematics) in vvmo, opium, mesmerism, or laughing gas 'lim lunatic and the drunkard should assuredly produco bottei re suits than they ilo in music and rigid dynamics Perhaps Mi LODOI would hardly go so far as this Yet ho goes quito far enough for Ina own ciodit when ho confounds that abstiacted state of mind which comos of tho highest con contiation of its powers with the flaccid scatterbrain condition which is brought about by " drugs, hypnosis, or "cr)stalga/mg" In the former case the mind is all fixed productively on one spot, in tho latter it is utterly incapable of being on any spot at all, m tho former caso tho mind is at ita most luminous, while it is only in the latter that it possesses tho " hazy " quality which IS confessedly so necessaiv for spookic impressions It is strange that mon of scienco should overlook tho natural explanation, that m its helpless betranced condition tho visions and visitatious of tho mind aro probably only thoso of droams, muddled mixtures of rominisconcos and approhonsions, while its uttorances aro mero prompt ings from blurred pictures made on tho mental retina by past experiences and moro or loss recont fancies On tho strength of a few ghost and spook stones of the usual typo, and supplied from tho usual sources, a com mittco of tho society has determined that thoro is "a connexion between " deaths and visitations not duo to " chance " A non researcher will hardly know winch to admiro tho moro, the egrogious triviality of tho stones, oi the suporb naivett. of tho committee 'I hat sundry good and honest peoplo bohovo themsolvos to havo hoard, seen, 01 folt a spiritual visitant is easy to undoistand But what is not so easy to comprehond is how an oxpoiioncod committoo should havo taken it for

Admitting that thoy wote solicitous to got at tho exact truth, did thoy oxorciso tho skill and scepticism of an avoingo bainstar m oxtracting it?

From that mind they can never be argued away. And yet they never existed. The witness is truth. ful, but his ovidence is untrue. Of this fact, a philosophical and scientific com mitteo should have boon aware, inas much as the phenomenon has occurred evor since history was written, and boforo it. Perhaps, nlso, the fact that the phenomenon decreases with th0 jn. crease of mental cultivation might have" its value for any but a researcher vrho is searching for his own precon ceptions.
