OUR MELBOURNE LETTER. _^~-« SATURDAY, JULY 22. TUF brief recess formed for the Musical selections r for Hy do away to a check, and on Tuesday next the Ministry had to flee till Parliament and put be fore the House and the country the grounds of their claim to occupy and to set in the Treasury Benches The bill lent members of the (Cabinet, particul th the Chief Secret try, have been most i sidings in in entering the business and informing themselves of the pen tion of then several deep ancient, and prep using' skeleton bills for the di nightmen, is who are getting their me usures ready for ornament The new Ministry have been in ted, as most of their predecessors have been Sinclhuiit is at this moment in a highly flourishing condition owing to the rich returns which the principal gold mines of the district have been yielding, and Sandhurst is therefore able men willing to do the hospitable on any suit able occasion I don't know how many Ministries have been thus entertained at that auriferous borough, or rather, how few, if any, have escaped its fond attentions At all events it would have savoured of unwonted cold ness if the dining men of Sandhurst had failed to invite Mr Duffy and his colleagues and so these gentlemen were duly banqueted there on Thursday evening last. The Ministers can have no cause of complaint in the matter of their reception on the contrary, they must have been agreeably surprised at the amount of enthusiasm displayed on their behalf, not only at Sandhurst but also on the way thither The dinner was very well attended, and in every respect a success The speech of the evening was of course that of the Premier, Mr Duffy, mci was an able and extremely telling one, full of point and classical embellishment, though, face the "Australian policy," somewhat vague He took up the same political topics us in his speech at Kyneton, and still claim ed for his Cabinet the character of a Ministry of " action,' having, as he asserted in the short month of their existence as a Ministry, already redeemed the promises, with which they had started, so far as depended upon mere admiring nation, and he pledged himself and his colle agrees not to pause while a for student of them remained unfulfilled, if Parliament would, assist them The extension of settlement and the creation of new industries were the princip d points dwelt upon The style of Mr Duffy's address may be gathered from the following extract, which reads, it may be said, more like the utter meet of a poet than a politician, but is immensely taking, especially with an audience who have just dined After answering some criticisms of Mr Michie's, he proceeds thus - Public life would be to me the most humiliating of Slovenes, if it was not redeemed by the hope of d ii U' some worthy and memorable work. I am in my pre in position, mainly, because I have a policy to carry out for which I am willing to strive and labour, to spend and be spent I have named it an Australian poluy-othoragno it other times, but under nut title it means the method and agencies by which this country may be made great and prosperous We have had rub it sometimes set over the who did not even know that a national policy is nee of my seriatim, as necessary indeed as a chart to sail be on the open sea What do j a aim and hope to make the country in the far future is the answer to this (guests ought to furnish the key of our national pride v and having determined the cardinal punt, We. ought not to commit to fluctuations and vari- ations, to doing to day what we may under to- morrow but keep our eyes steadily on the goal vi of have chosen, and all impediments, even ' Alps and App nine-., will sink before you ' 1 vi will say for the Government that they know what the are going Here is a land richly endowed by nature, a fertile soil teamed with gold, with a vigorous and intelligent population, with a oju-lituliun a-, free as half inn disin,endow ed with all the vitally order 1 lately that Milton 1 Aid If we cannot make a profit 01.8 and happy country, the fault is ours We have detained, some of us, of this latest growth of love (To went,? into a noble and perfect State's furor Athens and a freer Keno 'and if that be but a dream, what but our incapa- city forbids us at least to rival here, under this genial sky the more virtuous homesteads of Switzerland and Belgium, when every house hold is the seat of prospers i industry and he free citizen is bondsman to no lord saving the Lord on high." There was one incident connected with the occasion which the Airth i regards as extremely damaging to Mr Duffy, n finely, an allusion to his after before coming to Australia The gen clean the proposed the toast, referred to the prejudice existing against Mr Duffy in the public man, and the inevitable " Dr. Fell, was of come trotted out, but the speaker made spoke gets allusions to the earlier career of Mr Dtifly. andidnntted some escapades of his own youthful days which he should not like to be judged notaly an exhibition which he made of himself on Shallock dust, from whence he harangued the people in not very peaceable language These actions, as may be supposed, were not palatable to M Daily, and the terms on which he spoke on the subject are taken by the Argus to be a reaction of all his old " rebel to the back bone and spinal marrow" proclivities How far this deed ion is to granted your readers may judge from he resume veins of Mr Duffy, which, is leased by the Aiqut, were as follows " M friend Mr McIntyre has been gold enough to defendent political career in this colony, and to excuse inv j ohm queer in the Id e sultry 1 say very respectfully that do not think HIJ political career in this colony or my political career in the other country need either defence or exct> AS respects the old country, I content myself with sang that reasonable men will conclude, I believe, that a an who is faithful to his native country is not likely (be unfaithful to his adopted one. And as to this country gentlemen, I will challenge any friend who has still not doubts on his mind or any enemy to specify any public losurein this country which ought to be supported that hanot had my support. I simply think it due to myself, as an individual, but as the banner-bearer of a party, is due to the position I hold as Chief Secretary and head of Government, not to permit to pass without this Flight servation tho well-intentioned and courteous language (It somewhat wounding To me) employed by my friend i M'Intee." There as nothing special about any of the other leeches, which partook of the same character as other after-dinner utterances on similarccasions. The barques of Normanby experienced an exceeding rough reception here as far as the weather was concerned, for the ship Lincolnshire, in which his Excellency and the Marchioness, with his son, Lord Hervey Phipps, had come out, wíuáetained in the South Channel, some thirty nts down the bay, from Sunday morning until Tuesday afternoon by a continuous northerly gale The position of the ship was at one time noble from danger, for she parted from i one of financiers and dragged the other for a distance five miles, until she was close to a sand-bank, but the weather having moderated, they towcheraway to Melbourne. His Excellency and family are guests of Viscount Canterbury, at Toorak, 21 are quietly taking a look at Melbourne a the neighbourhood. He is to pay a visit of inaction to our new Town Hall on Monday, accompanied by our own Governor and suite, an they will take luncheon with the Mayor-a considerable number of leading citizens having be invited to meet the distinguished visitors. The He John Hart, the Treasurer and Pre line of Sth Australia, has been over here making arrangements for the dispatch of vessels to the Northern territory, for the purpose of prosecuting the gland telegraph. The Aldinga steamer, which sailed from here on Tuesday, will on her return trip bring the Government party, who are to heed to the north, to resume the work which has been taken out of the hands of the contracts They will be transferred to the Omeo steam which has been chartered for the purpose, and take a quantity of horses, drays, and stock, addition to those which Mr. Ross is procuring Sydney and Newcastle, to be forwarded by Antipodes from the latter port, and by one possibly two other vessels to be chartered one-half of the South Australian Government, he spirit and energy displayed by the SouthAustralian people inspire great confidence lies to the completion of the work almost as soon as was promised. The controversy on the stem of the rival lines to connect with the Indo-ropeaii lines, by way of Batavia, still goes on 'ween Queensland and South Australia ; anger. Cracknell's (of Queensland) answer to tinctures of Mr. Todd, the Superintendent of Tiraphs in South Australia, has 1 reached us, and been the subject of comment in our p speak Mr Fraser, of Batavia, has returned from his trip to Adelaide, where he has been interviewing the South Australian Government on the subject of the proposed site Mr service between Batavia and these colonies The result of his visit has not yet he liked out. He IS to have a meeting with the committee of our Chamber of Commerce 011 Monday afternoon M i Duffy's pet idea of importing vine and olive di caves, lie, prisoners, eVc, from Southern Europe, has been put into a tangible form in the shape of a Royal Commission, which has past been issued, nominating fourteen gentlemen, many of whom have manifested an interest in similar projects, to inquire and report upon the subject 'Their instructions are to ascertain how far it may be practicable to introduce into this colony the pursuits common amongst the farming communities of the continent of Europe, to "specify which of such industries are most suitable to our soil, climate, and circumstances, and to report as to how far the labour of persons in our industrial and reformatory institutions may be advantageously used for the purpose They are also to report on the preservation of our State forests, and the introduction of foreign trees suited to our soil and climate The eager craving which the people of every district in the colony manifest for railway communication with the metropolis has been cold bited in the proceedings of Town Councils and antagonistic " leagues ," but the Gippslanders, who had no prospect of getting a Government line constructed until the north east and south west of the colony had been first served, have exhibited their earnestness in a way which does them credit, and if they don't command success, they will at least deserve it They have set to work to raise £700 000 for the construction of 100 miles of railway, the cost being estimated by competent engineers, and they ask the Government to give a guarantee of interest to enable them to secure the required capital. The preparing denunciations of the abominations connected with the Unnatvading religious impostures in which the Pt eos has very properly indulged, has brought down upon one of our Melbourne journals, the Daily Teleqraph, the ire of the men and women concerned in them, and an action for libel has been commenced against the paper by one of the men and his wife. As two w witnesses who had lived in the service of these parties were about to leave the colony their etidtneehas been taken de bene cine, but it will not be made public at present. It is said to contain most extraordinary statements, and if the cases brought into Court we may look for still more sensational disclosures The movement which was commenced a week or two ago for celebrating the centenary of Sir Walter Scott's birthday has for the present failed, ft -.. as originated by the St. Andrew's Society ; but though entitled to some credit for having originated it, they made the mistake of endeavouring to make it subservient to the objects of their own little society. The passion for dancing on the smallest legitimate provocation which possesses our population was not sufficient to over- come the prejudice created against the " Waverley Ball, by the retirement from the list of its promoters of the most influential of the number, and the strictures of the Press on the proposed application of any money which might be made out of it. The general feeling is-and it is shared by the cultivated English and Irish as well as the Scotch that whatever may be the character of the festivities the net result should be applied to the founding of a Scott Scholarship at the Melbourne university. As the St. Andrew's Society men have at last discovered that their persistence in the course adopted by them was likely to be destructive of the entire object, they are retiring from that position, and it will now probably be taken up zealously by others and carried out. The check given to the movement will' not be entirely overcome, and moreover there is a very sufficient reason just now for abjuring expensive amusements. It is expected, however, to be moderately successful. Whether it is a sign of advancing age, or to whatsoever cause it may be ascribed, there is the undoubted fact that, as a people, we are getting as familiar with ghost stories as we were in the old country. Some tale of supernatural vision is continually appearing in the Press, especially the provincial Press, and we have had two or three stories of a very sensational character lately. Oddly enough, if the European starts a tale of this kind, the "Heathen Chinee" immediately surpasses him with a vision of his own twice as sensational; and fitting as exactly into the habits and notions of the Celestials as the English story does into those of the European races.
