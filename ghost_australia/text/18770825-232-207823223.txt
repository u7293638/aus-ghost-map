BAPTISM, AND JOHN WESLEY. to the ed Iron of the codbiee. Em,— Yonr correspondent, Joseph Mitchell, ap pears tdbe so anxious that others "should keep the commandments," tout I presume it is from ignorance of what John Wesley's leal teachings were, as to the mode of baptism, that he bears false witness against John Wesley, in trying to lead your readers to believe that Wesley held that baptism by immersion was the only mode of baptism For his information, and also for the benefit of others, I give yon Weebyte views on the mode, as rxpresaed inbls works (vol, 10, page 181 — " Baptism is performed by washing, dipping, or sprinkling Ihe person, in the nams of the Father, Eon, and Holy Ghost. I say by ' washing, dipping, or sprinkling,' because it is not determined in Scripture in which of these ways it shall be done— neither by any express precept, nor by any each example as cleariv proves it: nor by the foroe or meanine of the word baptise.' " — Yours, das., a vbuiix.
