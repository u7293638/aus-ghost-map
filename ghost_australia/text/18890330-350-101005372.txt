Ironbark, Sandhurst, in the colony of Victoria, Australia, do solemnly and sincerely declare that on the 25th June, 1877, my son Alfred, six years os age, was accidentally hurt with an axe on the knee, I at once took all paius to secure medical assistance. However, in spite of all efforts, on the 27th August, 1877, the opinion was given by Dr. Macgillivray that an amputation of the injured limb liad_ become imperative, in order to save life. At this juncture I called on Messrs Sander and Sons, procuring some of their Extract of the Eucalypti Globulus, and by the application of the same I had the satisfaction of seeing my son within a fortnight out of all danger, and to-day lie has recovered. I may just add that it was. when the crisis had been reached that the Extract referred to was first applied. And make this solemn declaration, etc.,-Franz Raabe. Declared at Sandhurst, in the colony of Victoria, Australia, this seventeenth day of October, one thou sand eight hundred and seventy-seven before me, Moritz. Cohn, J.P.-(Advt.) !
