Judging from the stress recently laid on the " peooanoy " of blue paper, • apd the mature deliberation which this "pee r cancy" seems to have necessitated, we should say that some of the legal fraternity would take very kindly to the thistle-fabrio, as from natural habit; and. would recognise at once that, in their case at least, this material comes very appropri ' ateJy under the " Provision! of the Judicature 1 Act" Such of them especially as may be in the, hkbit of eating their own words, would undoubt : c lly swallow these with much greater relish n hen served up on a preparation of their here ■ d|tary loflder.

"Exkprw," we used to read in out copy books, "is better than ,precept." We believe H is, 4 fortiori, example in high places ia ever bo much Stronger than precept in lower ones. This baa a lair chance of being tested just now in the Yellow piague question j while>the Press is busy. Ttrith statistics of the rix societies, tod the de. qtraction of the washerwomen of the future by tjhe sliaoned-eyed, meek-faoad Celestials ; while scarcity of rice, and abundsttoe of quarantine' is making, Cooktown verify its name moat un- I leasanfcjy» and, .whilst the Galley of Lome bids 1 lir for misery and discontent to rival its ghastly lawesaWof old^-loj we find one spot where the Celestial can fpld the hands of contentment On the stomach of repletion, and view the at tempts ntede to repnlse his brethren with the calm, critical eye of a philosopher watching a novice trying to square the oirole or oroes the port* atinorum on stilts. As of old, Mordecai the Jew, sit in the gate of Ahasuerus, so sits Cbing Poo ia the gate of Caaar ; and he, too, has his Haman, or to speak more correctly, his Hamen, anxious to effect his downfall. Mr. Timotheus p'Rafferty, si scion of. a npble Tuscan house, brave as the eagle ol his native cliff, peaceful as jhe. snowy peak of Slieve Bawn, eyes Ching Poo askance as an intruder into what he considers his T. O'&'s. fcrtAright in the land of his adop tion. Are not all his family and their cousins, the O'Rourkes (an ancient Milesian house who emigrated to Italy, a.0.0.—427), already provided With Government "billets?" has not O'Sullivan promised Timotheus the very next one that occurs, no matter what its duties or what his qualifications for it, and is he to be thrust out by a " haythin and Turk," like his countryman Cor nelius in the story. Under these circumstances of righteous grievance, we may write down T. OR. as Haman No. 1 to our Chinese Mor decai. But direr and more influential foes re main behind. We believe that one hon. member <of the Lower House, justly famed for his reti cence and conciliatory demeanor, was taken, very ill on the day of the levee, when suddenly and without due warning confronted with this Celes tial janitor. Another truculent personage, hold ing an office of great importance (to nunself) under the Crown, was seized with a violent jtremor at the same time, and rushed into the garden,,.exclaiming that he had seen a ghpst; and when assured by sympathising friends that the only ghost he had seen "was the one that walks so : punctually at the corner of George<Btreet and Queen-street every month, to which perhaps he was hardly used yet, he made use of a strong ex pression, and uttered threats against that peace ful Celestial that we hope he will not be able to fulfil We fear that Ching Foo, like his proto type who sat in the gate of the king, will have his troubles. Still he can congratulate himself that he is not at Cooktown, and that his quaran tine is over. We advise him to follow the ex ample of other public men, who, having got into office on free-trade principles, immediately become conservative (of their office). Do thou likewise, oh Ching Foo. Take the prof erred half-orown of the Kangaroo Point swell, and do nothing for it. Thuß thou wilt get many half crowns, for one fool of that kind makes many ; buy a newspaper then, or if too dear a member of Parliament, for thyself, and legislate against the Yellow plague—no good too many Chinaman —become a Christian (with due parade), and thou shalt be the fashion, and perhaps find an Esther among the daughters of the land. But beware meanwhile of those, three Hamen, especially the last. It Menu to be next door to very Uk*l? *&** one of these fine days we will h»ve the Prince of Wales in oar midst—or somewhere thereabouts. Supposing he doet come, then, what are we to do with him ? Now is the time te think it over and prepare our programme*. Our seal for the honor of our own colony has led us to oogitato over, this, and omogitate, and now,, like the echidna, to regurgitate. We hate arrived at the st4g« of seeing plainly that we wOL be con tributing somewhat. to the favorable develop ment of this dispensation if we can even show how the question is to be looked «t We have advanced to the further conclusion that it must bel looted in the face. On doing so, we see one feftuw of the. oase that ought to be constantly kept in mind. The Prince of Wales travels for the enlargement of his experience. It fol \oyn (as per Euclid, and science generally) that his visit to us will be a failure if we fail to en large his,experience. Practical application (as ptr theology, and tub-thumping in particular). Brethren, let .us enlarge his experience. It was tins consideration which led ub to dismiss, the idea that naturally rose firtt in our mind in con nection with him; the idea, namely, of giving him a little pigeon-shooting at the Hamilton.' We regret to state that this would' not enlarge hi experience. Tor the same reason we have dismissed marsupials and emus, inasmuch as other and older colonies will probably have rendered him familiar with such cusses before he reaches "these shores." Our object, remember, is to enlarge his experience. Mr. John Daryan, top, rose before our mind, with all his associations of princely hospitality and varied entertainment; but somehow we are inclined to bet that John will be out next $me a Prince comes. In the imbecility that followed the failure of three successive suggestions, we fell back ideally on the Musical Union, and remembering, thai our object is to enlarge the Prince's experience, we did think for a moment tnat we cquld manage it for him, But the fact is, we want to enlarge his experience without hurting hjm very much. There is a Freethought Association somewhere about: perhaps,,if we took him to that—but no ; now we think of it, he is a boas Free Mason, and it is a well-known fact tiatall Free Masons are infidels ipao facto, ex 0 lido, per te, and da capo ; so that free thought vfould be nothing new to him. Banquets, ad dresses, volunteers, fireworks, polo, foundation sxmea, concerts—what are all these in the life of a Prince, but just so many usedunnes»es! We daresay we could give him a fair idea of a new sensation if he would let us start him andSig tyy c automaton pipe-soraper from the Enoggera Reservoir at the same moment, and Bee who drould get, to Brisbane first. We feel sure that, 1 ke Mark Twain's friend, he would pronounce it ' perfectly hydraulic" But it is very doubtful i! he would submit to this ; very doubtful in . deed ; though it would do him good, and would lie quite as dignified as pig-sticking. " What shall we say, then ?" sb St. Paul somewhere asks. You see we want to enlarges his experience. And We don't want to hurt him. Let us—no ; that wouldn't do. Well,' suppose1 we—buf «hen we Watit—to enlarge—Dash it all, let's quarantine iinvi . ; : ■ ■ ;■ - i JoH]f Chinaman has done for himself at last. .As long as he remained on the, goidfields, he had " friends who would take his part Even if he' , did evade the payment of license fees, he did , some good by preventing the settlement of the mob of European radicals who would have oecu* pied the ground if he had not slipped into their places; and if he did a little mischief pip, other by demoralising- owr youth and breeding ]>estilenoe amongst as, still it takes so much to ' urge John Bull into a&idti;, that he, might liave gone on aa. usual for years if he could inly have lei dignitaries alone. We require i bishop to be burnt before we interfere to make railway traveling safe; but when that does occur, we regulate the business property. Well, John has burnt his bishop, that is to- say, he has an aot which will make immediate legisla tion on the Chinese question indispensable. The Governor was holding * levee at Government ' House the other day, and had issued ' cards to some of the leading swells, en titling them to what is known as the private entre*e. One of- our leading politicians forgot to bring his card with him, but was going In, feel pg confident that he was too well known to everyone in Brisbane to have any difficulty, whdn he was peremptorily stopped by the Celestial who now does duly as porter at Go vernment House. He endeavored to explain that) he was entitled to go into the drawing-room, but all his remonstrances were met, it is said, with a stolid " No savey—only welly good white fell6w close up like it Chinaman go there;" and he was edged off towards the receptacle for less distin gu&ihed; visitors. His prayers for the misguided ■ Celestial were both loud and deep, and luckily 'they were heard—by the aMe^de-camp, who reecued and passed him in. His ideas, however, on the 'subject of ohetfp Chinese labor have been very much modified by the experience he has had of it He formerly looked upon John as a man and a brother, and thought it unworthy of Britons to fear his competition in the labor market; but since his Excellency's porter refuted to reciprocate and to treat him as a man and a brother, he is quite prepared to put a poll tax on him. This wfll be dis* cussed when Parliament meets, but it is not certain that anything will come of it, because other people may also have' changed their minds on the subject of Chinese labor. The hall porter at Government House used to get £100 per annum voted by Parliament, but a Chinaman could be got for £10, which would save £90 per annum to the colony, and an equal reduction may no doubt be made in the cost of all branches of the : Public Service, from the police upwards, by importing our employe* from Hongkong. The economists ought to go in strong for this. In the meantime if John at Government House is a wise man he wfll wait until he knows a little more of the barbarians amongst whom he has been cast before he inter feres with them at receptions. He has made one mistake already, and had one escape; for if the aide-de-camp had not overheard the pious ejacu lations of his opponent, and appeared on the scene just in time, his sacred pig-tail might have Buffered some indignity at the hands of the irate barbarian. ThMb ate so nuuy^bfttruetiaaß to the free interabui|^bf'«omoMijitiei In this artificially, divided continent, that1 it is always * pleasure to hear of perfeeV'aad thriettweel reciprocity. A settler on on« side of the Mun»y is debarred from exchanging.' prtidu'ets with his neighbor aero** the water without tjie intervention of a Customs' offioial. Fortunately, in this enligot ened portion of Australia, and aorow the watery highway that leads us to the Bay, via Lytton, there are no such ridiculous restrictions. Not only are what we may term the lay residents at Kangaroo Point free to'engage in unrestricted traffic with those at Bowen-terrace, but the highest Customs' officials also venture to embark in the business. As there are no arbitrary regu lations to evade, or vigilant guardians of boun dary laws to etude, it appears strange that the traffio should be carried on under the cover of night. But so it is. Perhaps a fear of the trade being spoiled by too much compe tition induces the present merchants to keep the matter dark, and the sable plume of night is borrowed for this purpose. At present we have the most undoubted autho rity for believing that three firms only are engaged in this nocturnal traffic, the one resident at Bowen-terrace, with the other two' as correspondents at Kangaroo Point. At the first blush it must appear strange to the unini tiated in trade secrets that the interchange should be in the same line of goods, but it seems that both districts, are. producers of this particular staple. We can dnly suppose that Kangaroo Point produces an article of different color, size, or density to.the Bowen-terrace product, and that " difficulty of attainment," which political economists tell ub rules the value of articles of luxury, gives the relish to the residents in each neighborhood for the trinsaqueous goods of the other. ' We are riot even sure if "goods " ia the proper trade term. Cats being the merchandise referred to, it is. a, moot point whether "ills" may not be the phrase employed by the trade. At all events we have discovered these *ninrd» are being deported by bagsful from either side, at the witching hour of night, which leads us to suppose that the tortoishell soprano is in request' in the one locality, whereas the black contralto is more fancied to the other. Or is it that each district, supposing itself exclusively favored with the good gifts of heaven, has generously deter mined to share its splendid superfluities with its neighbor across the water f fat great Edmund Kean, in a remark since made famous, one© expreued his uUcr contempt for the pupporters of the boxes and galleries so long as the pit rose at him, and without the con soling alternative we cannot but entertain simi lar feelings for those of the galleries of our national theatre in George- street, which, being only of wood, it has been discovered fiave given way. Many,orators, singers, and actors have successfully, time, after time, brought down the house metaphorically, but it was reserved for the fervent and Ciceronian eloquence of Queensland legislators to outdo them ail by performing the feat ia a real and practical way. We are afraid there will jet be. trouble in those halls of dazalinp and headache, giving light, and that the Ministry will find the public down on them in such ah irresistibly crushing maim* that they will be only too glad to go out, if they can only manage to do it The Opposition will probably be better ott, as they.usually are when a Government is floored, inasmuch as they will probably haveibh* attentions!of the fair sex exclusively devoted, to. them, and many an honorable gentle man may discover some lovely form of 160 lbs. or'thereabouts reolining on his manly bosom in a fashion not at all approved of: by his better-half, who, having powWy pome to hear the pearls of wisdom fall from the lips- of her beloved Josiah, finds feerself clasping with frantic energy the Pfostrate and inanimate form of the representa tive of Scatterwoqj, Jpowns, The assurance that iron rods are. to. be, inserted does not relieve our feeUngs, ffr the iron has entered into our soul, and, we have an opinion that the rods, iron or otherwise, ought, to be visited upon the backs of th9se,,who had the/building and supervision of the erection of our Legislative Chambers.

If so, the man who found it out, and thus foiled the dastardly villain, is as worthy of as much credit as the individual who discovered, the gunpowder in the cellars of Parliament House, and saved the lives of the Most High and Mighty Prince and all bis Peers.

No more .pan we look up to (or down upon) the intellectually classical head of a Foote, or dreamily conjecture whether, if Morehead had less tongue, the business of the country would be the better expedited. Nor can we look with admiring complaisance upon Thorn, as we used to do, when in full bloom he Bat at the head of the Treasury bench. No; our thoughts will constantly revert to those unhappy supports, and we shall be picking out the softest cushion, or member, upon whom to alight in the event of our going down with a run. And are we to infer that, because the support* of the gallery have only been of wood, the pijlats of the State must necessarily be of the same ligneous character, ana that they too are likely to ta way.
