; MONDAY. ' Unfortunately the glorious weather of the past week did not continue till Sunday. Monday broke .very wet, and heavy rain fell all day, making the streets almost impassable -with mud. And as there was no abatement of the downpour at the hour of opening the > doors of the Exhibition Building, one might reasonably! have prophesied a poor attend ance. But,', despite the inclement weather, the capacity of .the .building, was severely taxed to contain the multitude that assembled. There could not. have been less than 8000 'p'drsons - 'present. i - Flags of' various nations were displayed from the pillars and galleriesj- and i several . .-handsoqiej ; banners j. of j various .. i lodges " received1 especial; ':prominence.

After "..The Song for hie," by Mrs. G. InneB, arid Lovely Taunton Vale," by ladies and the choir,' The Rev. Dr; Kelynack, delivered the fol lowing address : — The Rov. Dr. Kelynack made some observations on the significance of the gathering, and the plea- 1 sure it afforded him to be present, It had 'hap- poned with the cause they - represented as with: many - .another good ! cause, that it had been exposed- to tho calumny and opposition of its enemies. Some have fastened on the inconsistencies of certain of its members and have laboured to coBt upon tho Order tho odium arising out of the conduct of suoh as dis honoured its principles while bearing its name. Others hnvo misrepresented its design. , They .have denounced, it as a disturber of the peace, an invader of tho rights of others, while thoy have corivenieritly kept in the background, tho truth, that' its existence is demanded rind vindicated by another system which is fatal' to' mental' indepen dence, moral freedom, and religious liberty. But; sir, accusations are not proof.'1 It is an easy thing to hurl slanders at an institution, and to pour out anathemas upon a cause ; but suoh things, must- pass by as. the idle wind until -they are confirmed,, by; the evidence of facts. I am not. here to defend , ..all that is said and all that is done in tho naraoof: , Orange, ism. But I am here to say that when we i separate .all that .is accidental in it from all that. , is essential ; . .when-' wq ' discriminate the riots , of , .individuals from the spirit. of the system ' whbii, ;in short, w'q resolve 'it into its primitive elements' -.witli an open' Bible for its basis, the fear of God' for its regulative'fbrco," the 'spirit 'of "the"' widest' J religious' freedprri'fdr its inspiratioii. and devotion.1 . t,i:,,'luPen' arid country for its watchword— thon, X- thafr'thus1 interpreted 'rind thus expressed,1 'Orangeism11 deserves/1: the "attention11 and . should' ' qqmrriandi thmrespect of rill i right, thin king.1; men;:: (Applause.),.

Sbmo'A'filrm that the qualifications of an Orangeman aro tori stringent and ought'to be relaxed aa: as to admit of a wider sphere of agencies; But I say.no,' a thousand times-, no. If you lower the standard. !of Orangeism, eliminate froni it its sublime teachings of Chris tianity, deprive it of its affirmative Protestantism, and reduce it to a mere negation of popery, and like Sampson when shorn of his strength through - his corrupt alliance with Delilah, it will be resolved into an element of weakness, and become the sport and derision of its foes. Bejealous of the honour and purity of the institution. Live out its principles, and your homes participating in their beneficent effects will be rendered all the brighter and the happier. Live out its prin ciples, you heads of families ! and you will be the better qualified to discharge the duties of a husband and a parent, and your sons emulating your bright example, will devote themselves to the carrying forward of the work of the Institution and haste to speed its triumphs ; and from them as from us will be evoked the inspiration of worthy deeds, and thus the succession will run on. Live forth, the principles of the institution, and society en riched by their ennobling benefactions will yield the institution its homage, and multitudes, catoh- ing the contagion of their influences will rally round and enlist in our sacred cause. Live out, live out, the glorious principle of christian charity to our Boman Catholic fellow-colonists. In all your intercourse with them regard them as creatures of the same God, children of the same first parents, men designed for the same high destiny ; to which we aspire, and who claim our compassion to the extent to whioh they deprive themselves of the blessings and advantages which we enjoy. And if we do this, we shall more successfully, than by insult, disarm them of the prejudices they entertain towards the institution, and prepare the way for the. fulfilment of the prayer, which in our lodge meetings we regularly offer up in their behalf, viz., that tbey may be brought into the knowledge of the truth of that holy religion whioh is able to make them wise unto salvation. I rejoice that the institution has done itself the honour to elect as my successor, one so well qualified for the position as Bro. Murray has proved him self to be. In respeot to the institution I would say,— . In spite of rock, and tempest's roar, In spite of false lights on the shore; Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea, Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee. Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, Are all with thee, are all with thee. The testimonial consisted of a service of plate : a set of four dish covere, a set of four complete entree dishes and covers, a revolv ing soup tureen and chop dish combined, two revolving sauce tureens, two waiters, and a biscuit box, pickle frame, and six-bottle cruet stand. The dish covers, entree dishes, and sauce tureens are "en suite," and are elaborately engraved by hand in Japanese style ; birds, butterflies, and bamboo foliage being artistically combined to produce a very pleasing effect. The soup and Bauce tureens nave the covers constructed on an improved principle, whereby the necessity of lifting them off is avoided, as they easily revolve underneath. The soup tureen is also adapted for chops or fish, being provided with two movable dishes. The waiters are exceedingly handsome, the design being hand-engraved, and representing a bunch of roses and several well known Australian ferns, the latter being specially sent to England for the designs. The artist has faithfully and artistically reproduced the delicate fronds of the different fernB, and the grouping is perfect. The biscuit box, cruet stand, and pickle frame contain some of the best specimens of cut crystal glass we have seen, while the design of the silver portion is very chaste. The whole was pro cured through Messrs. F. Lassetter and Co., and we must say that great judgment has been shown in the selection of as handsome a table service of silver as conld be possibly obtained in the colony. The address was in portfolio form, and was beautifully illumi nated by Messrs. John Sands and Co. The border of the cover was: elegantly orna mented »with filagree work, in the centre of which was a gold five-pointed design, bearing a suitable inscription. At the Bound of three bugles the procession was formed, beaded by the following brethren in the capacity of Marshalls, each bearing aloft a drawn sword: — Bros Walker, Foeket, Lutton, Alexander, Stephen, and Giles. Preceded by the Coldstream Band, the brethren in full re galia ; then marched three times round the building, inside, halting at each circuit to give three rounds of Kentish fire. During the procession the band played alternately, " The Protestant Boys," and " The Boyne Water," and at the conclusion three deafening cheers were given for the Queen. The procession having been. dispersed, the brethren returned to their anntn and th» second part of the programme -was begun by Brother Jessep reading the following tele grams and apologies : — Grafton. No. 1 District Lodge sends fraternal greet ings.. Demonstration here a grand success. Orange. : Accept fraternal greetings from British Lion Lodge. < Successful- meeting here. Bathurst. Officers and members of 36 send you greet ings.' ' ... . _|. Tamworth. We send our greetings. Meeting here great success.. ' . Singleton. Successful meeting here. We greet you. Albury. Fraternal greeting from 79. Meeting crowded; Brisbane. Fraternal brethren of N. S. Wales from monster meeting here. ... Apologies were received from his Grace the Duke of Manchester, Hon. F. A. Wright, G. Merriman, M.P., A. R. .Fremlin, M.P., W. Lamrock, J.P., Rev. J. P. Dickson. ' The announcement to the audience of the fraternal greetings elicited enthusiastic ap plause. Mr. Win. Henson, D.G.M., then spoke as follows: — He would like them all to understand they had the open Bible here, and there was no chain to it. How muoh did we owe to the men who lived 300 years ago for securing to us the open Bible? Wherever they found Orangemen meeting to gether, they found the open Bible. They were not afraid to put it anywhere, even in the public schools, because they knew wherever it was found it contained the truth and the whole truth. Their love for the Bible made them honour the Queen ; but there were those who did not honour her. There was a manifestation of that the other day at Hobart. He then referred to the confederacy which existed between James II. and Louis XIV. of France, for the purpose of crushing out the Reformation. They tried to crush it out, but they signally failod. When William III. was invited to fill the throne of England, his banner bore the memborable words, "The Protestant religion and the liberties of England." He (Mr. Henson) could only pity those who claimed to be Protestants, and were not found commemorating such a glorious scene as that which took place when William the Third entered upon his reign as King of England. Although tho battles of his reign were not to bo compared with some great battleB of English history, yet they were to be remem bered, because they for evor decided that the Reformation could not be Btamped out. We were asked why we commemorate these events, and we were told we should not raise feelings of bitterness in the miudB of others by those commemorations. But why should we forget the noble deeds of those men of old, who had faced death in all its terrible forms beoause they would not bow down to idols. The children of Israel did not forget the achieve ments of Moses in delivering them from Egyptian bondage. And we ought not to be ranked among those who think so little of the heroes of tho past. It was not in a spirit of malice or hatred that they commemorated these events ; but they could not be so base as to forget their heroes of old. We were not to judge of the Papacy by what wo see of it to-day. We hid only to think of St. Bar tholomew's day to know what the Papacy is. We had only to remember what had been done iu the reign of Queen Mary, and we would know what liberty existed when Popery was predominant. And therefore we should never be so craven-hearted as to refrain from holding these commemorations, even if they did give offence to some people. (Applause.) The Rev. J. P. Dickson was to have addressed the audience, bnt was prevented from attending through personal illnesB. The remainder of the programme consisted of musical items. Mr. J. T. Gordon, in " The Armourer," and Miss Eva Thompson, R.A.M., in " What shall I say, then ?" were very effective, and secured unmistakeable approba tion on the part of the audience ; but the sentiment of the Bong, " The men who have lived long ago," appealed more to the sym pathies of the audience, and consequently the applause when Mr. A. Edward sung it was very enthusiastic. In this song the choir and the audience joined in the chorus, and the composer of the music of the song, Mr. P. D. M'Cortnick, on being introduced to the audience by the chairman, was loudly cheered. The choir then sang the "Anvil Chorus" and "The Village Choristers," and the proceedings were brought to a conclusion by the audience singing the National Anthem and giving three cheera for the Queen. Mr. P. D. M'Cormick officiated as conduc tor, Mr. George Godfrey as organist, and Mr- A. Massey as pianist, and each did his part well. The German Band accompanied the choir. A word of praise is deserved by the choir for their hearty co-operation, and not a little of the success of the celebration is due to them. As times they were a trifle weak, but this was doubtless owing to insufficient rehearsals. There is good material among them, which only requires practice to make still better. RUM LESSON. — Not the Prohibitionists, but liquordom itself has forced the formation of a Prohibition party, just as in times past the slave power forced the formation of an anti-slave party which found itself under the stress of affairs committed to more radioal measures than it intended, and obliged to take the ground of the mnch despised and bitterly opposed Abolition party. It is a marvel that intelligent men do not profit by the lessons and experience bo recently written upon the country's history. It UBed to be argued that slavery was a non-partisan question. So it was as long as it remained a mere question, but as time developed its true inwardness and bearing upon the fundamental principles of the Re7 public, it was driven from the cloudy and uncertain domain of question into a clear-cut political issue necessitating an opposing politi cal party to meet it on .equal terms. It was imperative that slavery should be destroyed, therefore its supporters were " mad," and in this state of madneBS or craziness, they them selves inaugurated the conditions of itB des truction. These new historical conditions are being repeated in our conflict with the rum power, and not only the end but the means to the other end will also be repeated. Names only are changed. It needs not the spirit of a prophet to forsee this. Then let us hope that tit. John and all other good men will soon comprehend the emergency and prosecute prohibitioh work in the only feasible and reasonable manner, viz : by and through the prohibition party. — Tap Root. THROUGH FOUR GENERATIONS.— A recent telegram from Erie says : — In tho Potter's field of Erie county was bririedryester- d ay the last of a race of mad people, whose nherited insanity has been a scourge' for nearly half a century. Che cause which brought this horrible affliction upon four generations was a fearful crime committed by Dr. Fisk in the presence of his married daugh ter, 50 years ago. Tne dreadful sight bereft the lady of her reason, and her child came into the world with a diseased brain that manifested itself most fearfully in after life. An unbroken line of maniacs followed, de monstrating the truth of the Scriptural pre diction relating to the sins of fathers being visited upon children unto the third and fourth generations. This has been literally fulfilled in the Fiek family. Four years ago another child was born in the family, greatly disappointing thoBe who had hoped that the woman buried yesterday was the last of her race. For years before the child was born the mother had been an inmate in the, county madhouse ; but one day in June she effected her escape, and while wandering through the countiy was met by a gang of tramps, who, taking advantage of her mental condition, kept her with them for several days. She was found a week later in an almost dying condition, and her child was born the follow ing March. Two years later it died, to the great relief of the authorities, who permitted Dr. Lovett to have it for the first experiment of his perpetual em balming discovery. That child is now; the mummy Stephen Fisk, alluded to bo fre quently in the medical and snientific jour nals, and which has been visited by scientists from all parts of the world. The crime com mitted by Dr. Fish, and which gave origin to four generations of lunatics, was murder. He was physician of some prominence, and his victim, John Fenno, was a person of vio lent temper. Fenno called on the doctor and requested permission to stay all night, which was granted. He was missed next day, and a week later his disfigured corpse Was dragged out of a swamp at the back of the Fisk homestead. Blood stains were found upon the floor, and Dr. Fisk, being arrested, con fessed to killing Fenno, claiming that it waB done in self- defence. High words having arisen and culminating in blows, the doctor took down his gun and blew out Fenno's brains, crushing the skull afterward with the weapon. His son's wife, being present when the deed was committed, lost her reason from the shock a few hours after its commission. CONSECRATED ACCOMPLISHMENTS. A great many girls, and, I am glad to notice, an increasing number of boys, are being taught, music. It is a severe study and exacts an immense devotion, and a very large amount of time, from those who would he proficient performers on any instrument. And still there are comparatively few of the multitudes who practice with fidelity who are able to. gratify ; a room full of people at a moment's notice; They need' their notes, or the style of music they prefer is not popular, or some convenient excuse is made with ease. There is a thought connected with this subject which I wish young ladies would con sider. It sometimes happens that in a prayer- meeting, or a devotional service, the praise is feeble and faint,, because there is no one at hand who can play or sing well enough to lead. In' ttie . absence of the organist or pianist, 'the pastor calls for a volunteer, hut among , twenty girls.; iwlio have received a musical education, there is often not one who is sufficiently, mistress of the art to read simple psalm tunes; and play them at sight. Consecrate this accomplishment, and if you have a sweet, silvery voice, consecrate that. Do not lend its tones only to silly love-songs, so idiotic that you would be ashamed to recite the words in a, parlour, although you sing them without a blush ; but regard the voice as God's gift, for which you are respon sible to Him. Sing the sweet home ballads, the soft strains of comfort which cheer the sick and sorrowful.' V The songs of native land which inspire to patriotism and corn-age, and, above all, sing. glorious Iiymns' of ; praise as. she did, who said':., .„ . . , ; Take my hps and let, them sing, , .

At the last large meeting held in I< ebruary, by the Victoria (Philosophical) Institute, 7, Adelplii Terrace, London, a paper was read by the Rev.' R. Q- Collins, M. A.', on Buddhism in relation to Christianity. 'Referring to the parallels between the persons and characters of Buddha and . Jesus Christ, he said :— Take, as a prominent instance, the birth stories. I need mot . here give details, which are to be found in any modem work on Buddhism. The supposed miraculous conception; the bringing down of Buddha from the Tusita heaven; the Devas acknowledging his supre macy; the presentation 'in; the Temple, when' thp imagos' of Inilra and other gods threw themselves ' at his feet ; the temptation by Mara— which' legends are embellished by the modern writer I have already, quoted, under such phases as " Conceived by the Holy Ghost,"' Born of the Virgin Maya," " Song of the heavenly, host," " Presentation in the Temple and temptation in the wilderness" — none of these is found in the early Pali texts. The simple story of ancient Buddhism is that an ascetic, whose family name was Gautama, preached a new doctrine of human suffering, and a new way of deliverance from it. There , is no thought in the early Buddhism', of ' which we read in the Pali texts, of deliverance at the hands of a god ; but the man Gautama Buddha starids alone in his striving after the true emancipation from sorrow and ignorance. The accounts of his descending front heaven, and being conceived in the world of men, when a preternatural light shone over the worlds, the blind received sight, the dumb, sang, the lame danced, the sick were cured, together with all such embellishments, are certainly added by later hands ; and if here we recognise some rather remarkable like nesses in thought or expression to things familiar to us in our Bibles we need not be astonished, when we reflect how great must have been the influence, as I have before hinted, of the Christian story in India in the early centuries of the Christian era, and, perhaps, long subsequently. This is a point which has been much overlooked ; hut it is abundantly evident from, among other proofs, the story of the god Krishna, which is a manifest parody of the history of Christ. The Bhagavat- Gita, a theosophical poem put into the mouth of Krishna, is something unique among the productions of the East, containing many gems of what we should call Christian truth wrested from their proper setting, to adorn this creation of the Brah- man poet, and indicating as plainly their origin as do the stories of his life in the Maha-Bharata ; so that it has not unreason- ably been concluded that the story , of Khrishna was inserted in the Maha-Bharata to furnish a divine sanction to the Bhagavat- Gita. If, then, as there is the strongest reason to ' believe, tho Christian story, somewhere / between the first and tenth centuries of the : Christian era, forced itself into the great;: Hindu epic, and was at the foundation of.the most remarkable poem that ever saw the: light in India, can we be surprised if we find . similarly borrowed and imitated wonders in the later Buddhist stories also ? Several Home and Colonial applications to join the Institute as guinea subscribers were received, and its object being to investigate all philo- sophical and scientific questions, especially any said to militate against the truth of the Bible,— a discussion ensued in which Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, Professor Leitner, from Lahore, Mr. Coles, an earnest student of the question daring 25 years' residence in Ceylon, Professor Rhys Davids, and others took part, all agreeing in and confirming the statements nf Mv riftllina' nnnov. T)r_ TioitnAi n large number of photographs of early Indian: „ ; and Tartar sculptures, showing the first in- , traduction of the Christian story into those 1 mtfnuments between the second and tenth centuries, and he pointed out the value of such additional confirmation of Mr. Collins' statements. A small-pox epidemic in Madras has been carrying off from 300 to 500 victims a week. Some of the Christian churches . ' have suffered very severely. A.cannon has been invented which throws dynamite bombs by means of com pressed air ! Let us hope that these in- " strumeuts of wholesale murder may be ' the means of hastening the end of war. Drunkenness is diminishing both in the army and navy, thanks to a greatly quick ened interest in the welfare of the men on the part of the officers.
