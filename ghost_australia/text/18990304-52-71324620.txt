Sailing. ;. Tho aquatic fraternity had a real good after- noon's sailing on Saturday, : when a stiff north-. % : easter made - things on the water pretty, lively. The - principalevent was: that for the' Gascoigne Cup, which was . in reality a re-sail. - The face, ?was "sailed' a fortnight ago, when the Thelma . came" in > first, - but the contest was declaredL,''no race,'! because the rounding mark at Long Reef was not in Its position when the smaller craft ?were in the vicinity of that portion of the course. The race on Saturday proved a win for Mr. Cox's HerreBhoff, -with Actaea second, followed home by Iduna, Fairlie, and Archina in the order named. The Thelma did not start, a circumstance which robbed the race of considerable interest. The "small raters" sailed a handicap race for special prizes presented by Commodore Hordern under the Sydney Amateur "Club rules. The race was open to all boats belonging to any recognised clutf rating 20ft and under. The race was a very in- teresting one, and resulted in a victory for Laurel with.Marcia second, two Auckland craft. Waimea, was third. The winner was well handled by Mr. Hunt, and the Mercia was in the hands of Fred Doran. The Johnstone Bay Sailing Club sailed three races on-Saturday-one for the 18-footers, 10-footers, and 8-footers, for prizes aggregating £17. The principal event, that for the 18-footers, was won by Australian, which has thus added another win to her numerous victories. Thalia was second. In the 10ft class. Aloha, under suitable rig for the rather stiff north-easter, gained first place from Venita and Tam-o'-Shan ter ; while in the 8-footers contest, which was the "blue ribbon" event of the "midgets," Zephyr scored an easy victory. The champion 8-footer, which is 8ft broad as well, was again faultlessly handled by Miss Irene Pritchard, who may well be congratulated on her prowess. The . second . skiff , race this season under the auspices of the ' Sydney Canoe Club was successfully carried .out on'Saturday. The race was an open sweepstake for skiffs not exceeding 18ft :in length and 6ft . beam.' ' Venice .was- first. Moonee second, and ' "Why Not third.
