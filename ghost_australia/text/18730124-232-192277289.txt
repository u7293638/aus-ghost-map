DISSENTERS v. CHURCHMEN. I had placed in my hands the other day a venerable manuscript copy of some unpublished verses, addressed in anno Domini. 1740, by Thomas Manns, a Dissenting minister, to a " clergyman." of the Established Church. They had a plain way of speaking in those days. The parson had beat talking slightingly of the Dissent ing preacher, and thus the latter retorts: — The judgment, ar, which you did pass, Was without mercy, and, alass, It was as- strange as new, \- That Unordafoed men who Teach, ' Or such as Do at Meetings preach, : Are all a Damned crew. After some warm protests against this sweeping condemnation, Mr Mmrna thus discotmeth of clerical millinery and -toe -Dissenting - ministers scorn thoeof: — No Gound nor Cassock do they wear When they do pnblickly appear \- - To serve toe Lord of Hbstsfi When they are praying with their flock, . . . \- They donttput on a Lfonen frock, . . To make them look like ghosts. Bnt.'J the late Mr Mhnns.. reserves his bitterest, sarcasm for his parting shot. He concludes his verses tons (he is still describing his Dissenting brethren:— To Heaven they send most fervent cries, And pray for all their enemies, His peace they still pursue. Out of ye truth they wont be shamed, arwl if such Men as ttwxaa are Damned, What wffl become of You? Thai question has heat answered one way «r the other about a century ago.—" -35gles," in toe AvstrMeman.
