THE ALLEGED ILLEGITIMACY OF THE l ROYAL FAMILY. From the Times.) The '«.T.A1M8 OP "MIINCISH OLIVE. "RIVES V. TUB ÀTTORNIT-GT.NXttAc,. I the Divorce Court on June 1, before the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, the Lord Chief Baron, and the Judge Ordinary, and a special jury Dr J W Smith and Mr D M Thomas for the petitioner, with the Attorney-General, were the Solicitor-General, the Queen's Advocate, Mr Han- non, and Mr R Bourke In this suit, which was a petition under the Legitimacy Declaration Act, the petitioner, Lavinia Jannetta Horton ItyvcB, of 24, Georgina-street, Camden- town, prayed that her mother, Olive Wilmot Serres, may be declared to he the legitimate daughter of Henry Frederick Duke of Cumberland and of Olive Wilmot, his wife. The learned counsel (Dr Smith) opened the case at considerable length, but the facts lie within a narrow compass, and will be best stated by being thrown into the form of a narrative The Rev Dr James Vv arnot, the petitioner's great- grandfather, -was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, of which he subsequently became a Fellow Early in his career but at what particular date does not appear he contracted a private but legal marriage, according to a certificate under his own hand, with the Princess of Poland, daughter of Stanislaus, last king of that country The issue of such marriage was one child, a daughter, Olive As she grew up she attracted much attention, in consequence of her beauty and accomplishments, and at the age of nineteen a formal offer of marriage was made to her by his Royal Highness Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, the brother of King George the Third The offer was accepted, and the marriage took place on the 4th March, 1867, at the house of Lord Archer, in Grosv Timor-street The ceremony was private, it was performed by the Rev Dr Wilmot, the bride's father, and it was witnessed by the Earl of Chatham ('hen Vii Pitt), the Earl of Warwick, and Lord Archer It is alleged that the duke s brother, lung George the Third, was also present His royal high- ness grew tired of this union in the course of a few years, and on the 2nd October, 1771, his first wife, the Princess Olive, being then alive, he contracted a second and bigamous marriage with Lady Ann Horton, daughter of Simon, first Earl of Northampton, and widow of Christopher Horton, Esq , oí Cotton Hall, in the county of Derby On the 3rd April, 1772, th e Inn cees Olive was delivered at Warwick of a female child, who was also called Olive, and some few years afterwards that unhappy lady died in France, it is said of a broken heart King George was so indignant at the conduct of his brother that he refused w the last to receive him or Lady Horton at Court, but, knowing the consequences to which his bigamous meetings exposed him, his Majesty did all in his power to screen him from the consequences of his guilt He directed that the infant Olive should be baptised, and represented as the child of Robert Wilmot, Dr James Wilmot's brother, but he at the same time took every precaution that, while he shielded the Duke of Cumberland from the legal consequences of his crime, he should in no way impugn the reputation of the lawful Duchess Olive or the legitimacy of her infant daughter With this view, his Majesty from time to time put the royal sign manual to several certificates, all in acknowledgment of the legitimacy of his " niece Olive," and likewise made temporary pecuniary provision for her support, as appears by the following document - " This is to declare that Lord Chatham binds himself to pay to the Duke of Cumberland s infant daughter the earl) sum of £500 during the said Olive s life, until a more suitable provision is made for her acting by the command of his Majesty In witness and confirmation of the same his lordship states his signature, this first day of May, 1773 "Witness- (Signed) Robert Wilmot " Gbouob R '' J Wilmot " Chatham " Apparently on the same date not only was there a new acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the infant, but a further provision was made for its support, as was shown by the following document - ''Georgelt-Wo declare the birth of Olive, the infant of the Duke of Sunderland, by Olive, his Duchess, to be legitimate, who is condemned to pray ney by the act of bigamy committed by her royal father (Signed) Warwick " J Wilmot. " Chatham "J Dunning." " New Palace, May 1, 177 " George II -Whereas we command that £5000 be applied for the benefit of Olive, the infant of our brother. (Signed) " Warwick" saving thus borne testimony to the legitimacy of the child, and made provision for its maintenance, I the King further determined to confer upon her distinction that had never previously been borne by any but members of the royal family He accordingly, in the following grant, ennobled the princess when only a little more than one year of age - George R -We hereby are pleased to create One of Cumberland Duchess of Lancaster, and to grant our royal authority for Olive, our said niece, to bear and use the title and areas of Lancaster, should she be in existence at the period of our royal demise " Given at our Palace of St James's, May 21, 1773 (Signed) " Chatham. " J DENING " Seven years afterwards, and notwithstanding the decease of its unfortunate mother, who died in France in 1774, the King still returned his affectionate interest for the infant, and his anxiety to repair as far as possible the injustice which was being done to her are in consequence attached his sign manual to the following document " George R -We are hereby pleased to recommend Olive, our niece, to our faithful Lords and Commons for protection and support, should she be in existence at the period of our royal demise, such being Olive Wilmot, the supposed daughter of Robert Wilmot, of Vi Warwick (Signed) "J Dunning " Robert Wilmot " 7th January, 1780." On an earlier date, also, June 2, 1771, his Majesty made provision for her in the following document, which many years later, in 1822, on effort was made to establish as a will. It ran thus " St James's " George R -In cases of our royal demise, we give and bequeath to Ohv e, our brother of Cumberland's daughter, the sum of £15,000, commanding our heir and successor to pay the same, privately, to our said niece, for her use, as a recompense for the misfortunes she may have known through her father. Witness "J Dtomn« " Chatham " Waiiw ick. June 2, 1774 " These and the other documents connected with the romance were deposited with Lord Warwick, whom the learned counsel stated he should be able to show was also a member of the royal family, and cousin of the Princess Olive He held them as trustee on the understanding that they should not be made public until after George the Third's death He, however, became seriously ill in 1815, and then feeling that his death, which took place in the course of the following year, was approaching, he delivered up the papers to the Princess Olive, then Mrs Serres, in the presence of his Royal Highness the late Duke of Kent The Princess Olive then for the first time became aware of her real parentage and position She had been reared in the family of Mr Robert Wilmot, but her taste for drawing was such that she was brought up to London in 1791, with the view of affording her an opportunity of cultivating the talent Here she became acquainted with Mr John Thomas Serres, a painter of marine subjects, and was married to him on the 1st September, 1902 Of this marriage four cb dren were the result The two eldest died young ; the third, the petitioner, was born on the 16th March, 1707 , the fourth, a daughter, born in 1862, she survives Domestic differences arose between the father and mother, and in 1863 a formal separation took place under the provisions of a deed It is alleged that on the delivery up of the papers by Lord Warwick, the Duke of Kent ever afterwards recognised Mrs Serres as his cousin, and that he actually allowed her £400 a year while he lived These are the facts of the case so far as they bear on the marriage of the Duke of Cumberland with Olive Wilmot Efforts have in vain been made for nearly half a century to obtain a recognition of it, but until the passing of the Legion may Declaration Act no legal proceeding could be instituted to establish it The Act was passed in 1858 in 1859 Mrs Ryves (who conducted her own case presented a petition and obtained a decree declaring the validity of the marriage of Mr. John Thomas Serres with Olive Wilmot, and she now seeks by the present proceedings, to establish the legitimacy of her mother, who, in the suit of 1859, was simply treated as Olive Wilmot, and set as the Princess Olive The documents relied on in support of the marriage of the Duke of Cumberland and the daughter of Dr. Wilmot are very numerous, and they contain what purport to be 16 signatures of Lord Chatham, 12 of Mr Dunning (afterwards Lord Ashburton), one of Lord Archer, 12 of George 111 , 18 of the Duke of Kent, 32 of the Earl at Warwick, 13 of Dr Wilmot, 1 of the Duke of Cumberland, and 1 of his, wife And reliance is also placed on a portrait of the Princess Olive, which it is said hears a striking likeness to the royal family in order to account for the pains which King George III was at to shield the Duke of Cumberland from the penal consequences of his crime of bigamy, it is alleged that his Majesty himself was also guilt) of bigamy), and that this fact was within the knowledge of his brother and the Rev Dr Wilmot, who, on the 17th April, 1769, performed the ceremony of marriage between his Majesty and Hannah Lightfoot lins marriage was celebrated twice On the first occasion the lady was erroneously described as Hannah Wheeler and hence the necessity for second solemnisation The first was performed at Kew, the second at Peckham in respect of his marriage, there are the following certificates - .,,.-, " This is to solemnly certify that I married George, Prince of Wales, to Princess Hannah, his first consort, April 17, 1859, and that two princes and a princess were the issue of such marriage "J Wiimgt " London, April 2, 176 " This is to certify to all it may concern, that I law- fully married George, Prince of Wales, to Hannah Lightfoot, April 17, 1859, and that two sons and a daughter are the issue of such marriage "J Wilmot " Chatham.

The petitioners' attorney also produced a portrait of " the Princess One, but the Court ruled that it was inadmissible Dr Smith said it would prove by the striking likeness Mrs Serres s connection with the royal family. (A laugh ) It was at any rate moral evidence -the Lord Chief Baron As far as I can see the case of the learned gentleman has not much morality in it Dr Smith hoped that his Lordship would abstain from expressing such an opinion, at all events for the present When the Court retired for a short time to luncheon, the picture was exhibited to the spectators, and the reporters state that " its striking Likeness to George IV was the subject of general remark " The Attorney-General on his return insisted on the portrait being instantly covered up The whole of the day was occupied in procuring documentary evidence in support of the petitioners case At the close of the Court, the further hearing of the case was adjourned to June 6th, during the whole of which day Mr Netherchft, the expert, was under examination with reference to the genuineness of signatures the minute particulars of his evidence could not be made intelligible in a report without fee simple of the various documents , but its general and distinct purport was that the disputed documents were genuine, judging by comparison with admittedly genuine documents He stated, in answer to a question from the Lord Chief Justice, that the moral probability or improbability of such men as George III and Dunning putting their names to such documents did not enter into his consideration in forming his judgment On June 7 the evidence as to the handwriting of the documents produced by the petitioners was continued, and Mr Netherchft was again put into the box, when he made some rather important admissions After he had deposed to the genuineness of the signature J. Dunning," he was shown some papers written by Lord Ashburton, including his will, and he at once retracted his opinion, stating that he did not think that the documents before the Court could have been written by the same person as had written the Attorney-General's specimens A paper was put in, whereby Mr and Mrs Robert Wilmot acknowledged to have taken the infant child of the Duke of Cumberland, their niece, into their joint protection Comparing this with Mr and Mrs W llmot's signature to the register of their marriage, he thought it genuine , but on cross examination he admitted that there were only small similarities and great differences As the case progressed, the signature of Lord Chatham was admitted by Mr Nether- gift to be a forgery At the conclusion of this witness's evidence on the afternoon of the 7th, Mrs Bj-\C6, the "Princess Olive," was examined The reporters describe her as a very lad like person, possessing features which very strongly mumble the portraits of the last generation of the royal family, and add that she demeans herself with the most remarkable ease and self- possession She gave her evidence a er j clearly and firmly, she repeated with emphasis the oath administered to her to tell " nothing but the truth," and in the course of her examination, when a seat was offered her, she said she was not tired, and she could stand for ever to prof ct the honour of her family) She was first examined as to her marriage with Mr Ryves, which she said she had cause to remember It took place in November, 1822, at St. George the Martyr, Southwark, and she obtained a decree of divorce from him in 1841 She then proved the birth of her son, the other petitioner, at Vauxhall, in March, 1856 In 1859 she presented a petition for a decree declaring the validity of the marriage of her father and mother, and her own legi- timacy not, she said, from any motive of fraud, but to establish those facts, The petition came on for hearing in 1861, the trial lasted four days, and a decree was pronounced in her favour The Attorney-General was represented at the hearing by Mr Welsby and Mr. Roche, and did not oppose it. The proceedings in this suit were put in evidence Mrs Ryves then gave evidence as to her early history She said -"I was born in 1797, and I remember coming to London from Liverpool with my father and mother when I was only two and a half years old We lived in Harley Street, at the British School of Artists, which my father founded I lived with my father and mother until their separation in 1903, and after that I lived with my mother I left school at the age of 13 " The petitioner's counsel then proposed to ex imme her respect- ing some declarations made by Hannah Lightfoot, the alleged wife of George III and on the Court object- ing that they had no evidence that Hannah Lightfoot was the wife of George III , two documents profess- ing to be certificates of the niarrnDe were put in, one signed " George P , the other " George Guelph The Court, however, declared unanimously their opinion that these were forgeries, and declined to permit them to be used The petitioner then went on to narrate, with exceeding particularity, how the Earl of "W Marwick made known to her the secret of her birth, how her mother supplied the Earl with means to go to Warwick Castle to hunt up the necessary documents, he being at the time so Door that he could not find the money himself, being often indeed, as Mr Ryves said, unable to buy a sheet of note paper, and how the Earl satisfied the Duke of Kent at the royalty of the petitioner's family " The Duke of Kent," said Mrs Kj-ves, " took each of the papers in his hand and examined them, and he expressed himself perfectly satisfied that the signatures of George III were in his fathers writing He acknowledged my mother as his cousin He said that she was Princess Olive of Cumberland, the only legitimate issue of the duke s marriage, and that for the future, Lord Warwick being in such a state of health that he might die at any moment, he would take on himself the sole protection and guardianship of my mother and me " From the petitioner's further evidence it seemed that the Earl of Warwick was under continual obligations to her mother in pecu- many matters On the filing of the Court on the 8th, Mrs Ryves I was recalled and her examination resumed She re- I peated in substance her previous evidence, and stated, I in addition, "that the Duke of Sussex, as well as the Duke of Kent, acknowledged the signature of their father to the documents now produced She also mentioned that she and her mother had frequently received money from the Duke of Kent, and that it was always given by cheque on Coutts's bank She Ti as then cross examined at great length by the Attor- ney General It appeared from her evidence that her mother, Mrs Serres, was an astrological, a ghost seer, and a literary lady of no small preen sions She had issued a manifesto to the people of Poland stating that she had providentially discovered her descent from the royal family of that country, and calling upon them to invite her to the throne in this paper she stated that her legitimacy as the Duchess of Cumberland had been established by a legal and wool in England It appeared further that Mrs Serre-s had published a book, in which she claimed the authorship of " Junius for Dr "ft Wilmot It was stated that when a girl she had taken the manuscript out of Dr Wilmot s library to scribble in, and then, fearing his anger had secreted the volume, and it had remained in her possession forgotten until it was accidentally discovered by Mrs. Ryves The cross examination of the petitioner, which was not finished when the court rose, was resumed on the morning of the 6th June by the Attorney-General The memorial of Mrs Serves to King George IV in which she claimed to be acknowledged Princess Olive of Cumberland, was read It differed in many important respects from the account already given, but the witness said the errors it contained were the errors of Mr Nugent Bell, the " genealogical counsel ' whom her mother had employed She stated that the Duke of Kent believed that Mrs Serres it as really legitimate from 1815 to 1818, and that somebody having then told him that the marriage of the Duke of Cumberland was nullified by the Royal Marriages Act, he persuaded her that she was illegitimate till November, 1899, when she was informed by a clergyman that the Act had not been passed till five years after. In the memorial the word " offspring was (spelt "offspring, and that error Mrs Rj-\es attributed to Mr Bell, but a birthday ode to the Prince of Wales, which Mrs Serres had written with her own hand in 1812, was found to contain the following lines - Hail valued nour, offspring of Heaven's smile, The great and mighty succour of this isle This eccentric orthography was found in several other autograph papers of Mrs Serres The Attorney-General called for the engines of several documents printed in Mrs Ryves pamphlet relating to the birth and identification of her mother, and other matters, but they were not produced The learned counsel read some private and confidential communications addressed by Mr Bell to Henry Happens, Esq, Under Secretary of State in one of them Mr Bell stated that he had seen certain papers in Mrs Serrées possession which he believed to be genuine, and that unless her Majesty declared her to be the Princess of Cumberland, within a few hours the papers would be given to the public and a revolution might be brought about In another Mr Bell said he had seen several certificates, the first signed by Dr "W llmot, stating that his late Majesty George III was married at Kew to Hannah Light- foot in 1750 , the second, signed by J Dunning" and " Chatham, ' stating that his late Majesty was married to Queen Charlotte, after the death of Queen Hannah, in January, 1865, by Dr Moore, and the third, signed by his late majesty, declaring William Henry to be his first legitimate son The witness had heard some rumours about the subject of the second certificate, but she had never seen such a paper She had heard that Dr Moore was a friend of Dr Vv Wilmot Dr Frazer, a physician, was then examined, and he stated that when a young man, shortly after he entered the medical profession, he attended upon the late Princess Olive, as she was then called He attended her from February, 1882 to February, 1854 He was introduced by Mr Macaulay, a literary gentleman He visited her frequently, and talked a great deal with her upon a variety of subjects, including politics and her own affairs, and he never had the least reason to suppose that she was a person of unsound mind Since that period witness had had considerable experience with regard to insane patients Mr A W South said he had been acquainted with the late Princess Olive, and had frequently conversed with her relative to the claims she put forward on the subject of her birth He believed her to have been as sound in mind as he was himself A document was then read by the learned counsel, purporting to be the last will and testament of the Earl of Warwick, dated the 22nd June, 1842, in which it was stated that, from the injuries his lord- ship had received at the hands of his eldest son, he was induced to bequeath to Olive, Princess of Cumberland, all his real and personal estate upon con during which he was sure she would observe the Attorney-General said there was also a letter written by Lord Warwick, purporting to give reasons for making this will, and in which it was stated that the letters of " Junius ' were written by Dr Wilmot -Mrs Ryves believed that she could still propound the will - At the close of Mr. Ryyes's evidence, the will anda Post office frank of Lord Warwick, and the will of the Duke of Kent, were put in as specimens for compari- son of handwriting, and this concluded the case for the petitioner The further hearing was then post pond till June 13, when it was resumed, and the case for the defence entered upon The Attorney-General detailed the circumstances connected with the case which he would have to lay before the jury He alleged that the petitioner's mother was the daughter of Robert Wilmot, and in proof of that he quoted the bond entered into on her marriage, in which she was stated to be the daughter of that gentleman, and also to Dr Wilmot's well, in which she was left a legacy as his niece, and the daughter of his brother Robert Wilmot He could not help bearing in his mind, and of representing it to the jury that this body, the petitioner's mother, was of disordered mind In proof of that he read the singular letters which she addressed to the Prince of Wales, and which he referred to in the cross examination of the petitioner These letters ron from 1909 to 1913, and they con- tained statements of the most extraordinary character, showing that her mind was full from beginning to end of insane delusions In one of them she offered to lend the Prince of Wales £20,000 provided he would grant her a personal interview even for two hours his interview she sought in many letters In others she lamented her poverty, and asked for assistance Several of these indicated that she was a great dabbler in astrology But the most conclusive part of the case was this Between the death of the Earl of Warwick, in May, 1846, and the death of George III , 111 1820, the stories she gave of her case were inconsistent with each other, and totally inconsistent with the story which she told in 1821 The first story she published was that she was the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Cumberland by Mrs Payne, wife of Captain Payne, who had gone abroad and never returned, who was a sister of Dr Wilmot's and in several of her letters at the time she stated Dr Wilmot to be her uncle That Has in May, 1817 The second story was that she was a natural daughter of the Duke of Cumberland by a sister of Dr Wilmot's, a lady of large fortune, whom the duke had seduced under the promise of marriage Again, in July, 1916, she wrote to the Prince Regent to the effect that she was told by the Earl of Warwick that she was the daughter of the Duke of Cumberland, who gave him £2000 to be paid to her, but which he had spent, and was in consequence ashamed to go to the Prince of Wales and unfold the circumstances of her birth She, however, regretted that with the death of the Earl of Warwick, in 1816, all evidence of her birth and parentage had been lost And yet the petitioner now came into the witness box and gave a minute detail of the visits of the Duke of Kent and the Earl of Warwick to her mother in 1815 , the production of the papers which disclosed all the circumstances of her title, while in the letter to the Prince Regent her mother distinctly stated that with the death of the Earl of Warwick she was afraid all trace of her parentage was lost But then in 1821, when the Duke of Kent and George III were dead, she told a different story, and alleged that from documents found in a sealed packet, opened in 1849, she found that she was the daughter of the Duke of Cumberland and his duchess, Olive Wilmot, a daughter of Dr Wilmot There were a great many sealed packets in this case, but certainly this was the most extraordinary one There were several of the documents said to be produced in 1815 which stated that it was Dr Wilmot s daughter who married the Duke of Cumberland, and if there was truth in the production of these at that time, she had no occasion to wait for the opening of the sealed packet in 1819 to inform her of it. If there had been a sealed packet there was no question, from the letters of the petitioner's mother to the Prince Regent, that it was opened long before 1819 at all events, the documents produced now could not have been the same as those in existence then, for in those documents there is no word of Mrs Payne, and the statement was plain and distinct that it was Dr Wilmot's own daughter that he married to the Duke of Cumberland, while the Earl of Warwick, in a letter to the Princess, spoke of that Olive Wilson as her " angelic mother "It was not likely he would have so spoken of Mrs Payne, a married woman, and it was almost incredible that Dr Wilmot would have named his sister, a married woman, to the Duke of Cumberland As to what is said about the Royal Marriage Act, It was out of the question to suppose that the Royal Marriage Act rendered the marriage null Then it was said this lady was bound to keep certain matters secret until after the death of George III , but she had a singular way of keeping that secret, for years before the king s death she was perpetually dunning the Prince of Wales with statements of her case The learned gentlemen referred to certain statements made by the princess in her life of Dr Wilmot, published in 1843, and a vindication of his claim to the title of " Junius," published in 1817, in order to show that she paid considerable attention to the comparison of handwriting as evinced in her statements relative to the manuscript of " Junius in Mr. Woodfull s possession, and her assertion that no one could compare that manuscript with Dr Wilmot's handwriting without being satisfied that they were both traced by the same hand He next alluded to the letter written by Mr Bell, the legal adviser of the princess, to the Secretary of State, in 1821, in furtherance of her claim These he characterised as begging letters, and that of the most gross character There was, in fact, a whole family of such documents, but none of them were now forthcoming On these documents there were fourteen names which appeared on the papers now relied on, and twelve which did not to appear The peti- tioner had now put in evidence seventy-two documents Besides these 10 more had been produced from the Treasury in the memorial of 1821 there were 11 more, the originals of which were not now produced, while in the pamphlet published by the petitioner there were 28 more, of which the originals were not produced, altogether the documents mentioned as bearing on the case were over 160, while out of the whole only 82 were produced And what sort of documents were they 5 Why, they were such that no expert in the world would give evidence of the handwriting from them Wuk two exceptions they were all written on little scraps and strips of paper, and all without the water marks of date i he learned gentleman was proceeding with his address when the foreman said he was commissioned by his fellow jurors to express their opinion that there would not be the slightest necessity to call evidence to rebut the case of the petitioner, for in their unanimous view the documents relied upon by her were Spurious The Chief Justice In that case you only share the opinion of my learned brethren and myself We have long felt that every one of these papers is a palpable forgery, nor is there one part of the petitioner's case which agrees with the rest Dr Smith then addressed the jury at some length on the part of the petitioner, after which the Chief Justice summed up, and the jury delivered their verdict, which, stripped of technicalities, was this -that no such marriage as that alleged between the Duke of Cumberland and Olive Wilmot had ever taken place, and that the so called Princess Olive was not their legitimate daughter -The Attorney-General then asked that the documents might be impounded, and intimated that if the case had gone on he should have been able to prove that Dr Wilmot was at Oxford at the time of the pretended marriage in London, and that Lord Warwick, before his accession to the title, never signed himself " Brooke, ' but " Greville " The documents were then ordered by the Court to be impounded, and the case concluded ?."?
