RANDOM PAPERS. BY QUIVIS. A MASONIC SERVICE. There is a vulgar but nevertheless a very pithy saying " You can't have your pudding and eat it," and its application generally means that we have to pay for everything we get in this world of "compensations." Thus it is that by our ill-advised cultivation of science and correct thinking, we are robbing the world, and life, and man of much of that mystery which made, say, the Early Middle Ages so picturesque and interesting. What charming dreamlands—gardens of Hesperides, isles of Atlantis—could be imagined west of the pillars of Hercules ! Life was a tragi-comedy, with the balefires of hell below and the radiance of heaven above ever colouring the scene. Man was an intellectual babe to whom all nature was a secret and a muscle—who was haunted by real ghosts and saw in the dark a personal devil, and was rescued and comforted by shining ones clothed in celestial raiment. Can our boasted science restore us these ? Does not the tooth water, so to speak, when one stumbles upon such refreshing con- fessions as these which Sir Thomas Browne makes in his Religio Medici :—" For my part I have ever believed, and do now know, that there are witches. . . . I hold that the devil doth really possess some men. . . . I love to lose myself in a mystery , to pursue my reason to an O allitudo ! " . . . I can answer all the objections of Satan and my rebellious reason with that odd resolution I learned off Tertulian—Certum est quia im posstbile est ' If a physician now-a-days were to express himself thus he would be justly looked after by his friends Even the theolo gians are trjmg to accommodate miracles to the fin de siècle way of thinking , and it is only dreamers like Walt Whitman, whom the cultivated jibe at, that can be found to utter such words as these :— " To me every hour of the light and tho dark is a miracle , Every inch of space is a miracle. Every spear of grass—the frames limbs, organs Of men and women and all that concerns them All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles." Everything has been found out—every lllu sion dispelled-with the usual grim dis covery that " there was nothing in it ' The result has been that the region for belief, for miracles, for mystery has been made so dim and so narrow that the man who is not a born poet and dreamer can pass fiom the cradle to the grave in a region of perennial commonplace Now, as man was made to wonder, it is not a matter of surprise that he hungers after mystery and delights to wrap himself up in it, us with a mantle. Even petty mysteries in terest him—such as how Jones, the chroni cally bankrupt, can enteitam so royallj, how that dull fellow, Brown, manages to write such brilliant leading articles If he cannot import the real thing into hIns own life, he is content wlth a sham mysterj, and becomes an Antediluvian Búffalo, a Druid, or an Oddfellow It must not be supposed that I Imv p be como an elderly person without being served attunes with the desrie to be as mystenous as cnrcuinstances would pernint By nature I um peeuharly susceptible to the murvellous, and I am not ashamed to confess that my flesh creeps at a will told ghost story, and that I could not sleep in a house reputid to be "haunted I have heard men call the signs and watchwords and initiatory ceremomes of the orders I have named "tomfoolery ' 'To them a Druid in gala attire is a ridiculous person, masquerading in a sham beard and n nightgown, but to me he is a venerable being "Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful " To them the order, and all orders-except the "Rechabites' and "Good Templars - are but excuses for meeting in suburban taverns to drink beer and talk politics To me, such a body as the Freemasons, for instance, is a brotherhood whose rites, oaths, penal ties,beliefs and cult are quite awful, hi reason of their impenetrable mystery and secrecy Detractors of the mystic craft have hinted that like other orders it exists principal^ to afford additional facilities for conviviahty and comic songs, and that Bobus the foolish before initiation is not less foolish after it These insinuations I find, are always made by the ignorant and the prejudiced , and besides, the utter foolishness of Bobus may be onlv ' his artfulness to conceal the blessed effects of the rite from the eyes of the pro fane I have so circumscribed my reading and thoughts and experiences in some direc tions that I have left for myself some strong holds of darkness and miracle into which my spirit may retire from the attacks of doubt and scepticism And Freemasonry is one of them I have not hitherto joined the brotherhood because it is possible that after initiation I might find life bereft of another mystery, and that of the one I had lost the hollow verdict " nothing in it mi(,hthave to be uttered Better is it for me therefore, perhaps, that the brotherhood in ni) mind stretches indistinct and vast from the Masonr) of the Antediluvian Enoch to Solomons Temple nnd from thence to the Freemasons'- hall in Collins street mid that the ideas it calls up include n picttucsque jumble of Carbonari and liosicrucians,
