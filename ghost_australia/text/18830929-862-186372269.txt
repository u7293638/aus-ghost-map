Day Lilies. Laughter so Soon is' over, Bummer Bo Boon is done, What has a lily of- fragrance After its day in the snn ? Dewy and fair in the morning, Perfumed and pale at noon; Dewy and dead at sunset— A ghost by the light of the moon. What have you to remember ? What have I to forget ? daughter, jests and trifling—lilies With dewdrops wet, One for every morning—a lily Counte for a day; Days and summer and lilies, How quickly.p&ssed; away. Whioh of us was in earnest ? Whioh of us was in jest 1 When the lilies breathing fragranoe Died slowly on any breast, Because they pleased your fanoy— . Because my mood was new Do you believe that lilies May leave the scent of roe ? There's nothing to remember, There's nothing to forget, But laughter, jests and trifling, In all the summer's coming All lilies under the skies, Will bring baok to you low laughter And the blue of a woman'B eyes. I neither hurt nor healed you, You'll be no more false nor trno To me and my summer fancies, Than—I shall be to you, But to the end the lilies Will be of your past a part, And you'll think yon see them lying A bloom on a woman's heart. Throughout pf all our summer This ia what I have won. I may chance to be remembered When lilies stand in the sun, You will forget the woman— I Bhall forget the man— But the iragrance of the lilies, Forget it if you oan. But I have my little triumph— A woman's—light and vain; And would it have paid me, think you, To have wrested it from pain? Grant you each word I utter Is a trifle light as air; Yet out of my little triumph There grows a little prayer. Give other women roses, All bloom to tbemis free; I—I have earned the lilies; Leave them to me—to me. Those who jest in the morning, Should jest at set of sun; When will end this jesting ? When will the day be done ? But I have my little triumph— A woman's—light and vain; It would have paid but poorly To have wrested it from pain, And to the end the lilies Will be of the paat a part; Once—onoe an August lily
