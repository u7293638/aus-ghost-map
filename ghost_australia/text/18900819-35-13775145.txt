THE SYDNEY AMATEUR COMEDY' COMPANY. The members of the above company gave a dramatic and musical entertainment last evening at the Standard Theatre. There was a good house, and the performance passed off, on the whole, successfully. The first item on the programme was Mr. Rifle Norwood's pretty comedietta, " Hook and Eye," played by Messrs. Alfred Spears, Charles Kitchen, and Harry Lawrence, and Miss Belle Kelly. Mr. Arthur Gordon then amused the audience by some harmless and clever imitations of well-known actors. He was particularly successful in his imitation of the late Alfred. Marshall us Quite, and in a burlesque of the nursery story of " Mother Hubbard." Mr. Gordon's imitations were followed by several songs. Then came the third scene from l( Hamlet," by Mr. Nelson C. Dwyer as the Prince of Denmark, Mrs. Dwv or as the Queen, and Mr. Alfred Speers as the Ghost. The Shakesperian effort was a little above the heads of the amateurs. The entertainment concluded with Mr. Charles Eawcott's Gaiety farce, " Bubbles."
