forest, are shy of company, and the Affiliated are not sufficiently progressed in their notions of things to distinguish well between an enemy and animals We therefore dismiss all idea of a Kusso Afghan invasion of India as absurd, or if not absolutely absurd, the event will at least take place in about as much time as well intervene between the present ei 1 and the era in which the destroying Angel will descend upon earth to visit on our descendants the sins of Adam and Eve' The absurdity of the system by which things are carried on in India becomes at times painfully apparent We have lately had a specimen of the way in which it works, as far is the army is concerned There is a European regiment to be raised, in in fantry regiment Europe 111 soldiers are alw is difficult to manage, not more so perhaps in India than in other parts of the world, but still a good deal of experience and tact is necessary to manage them properly Li raising a new corps it is obvious that this experience and tact become doubly necessary Experience it is impossible to get because the officers for the new European 10g ment must in a great measure be drafted from the Native Infantry Regiments An officer who has been accustomed to native soldiers will of course find a great difference in his work when he comes to manage Europeans, but still the great principles upon which it is carried on are the same in the European as in the Native Infantry Among the officers, however, drafted into the third European Regiment is one Captain Phillips, who is promoted from second in command of the 18th Irregular Cavalry, to the command of a company in the 3rd Regt ment of Europeans There are other cases of a similar kind, but we merely notice this as being an extreme one Now here is an officer who has been for years employed in a manner the most diametrically opposed to that in which his services will henceforth be repaired, suddenly called on to sacrifice pay and allowances and serve in a new, and we can well believe, uncongenial sphere in congenial, that is, as far as his tastes and habits are concerned. Such a thing is likely enough to happen any clay, in an army constituted as the Indian army is. An officer accustomed to deal with native soldiers alone, employed for years in the mounted branch of the army, is suddenly summoned to assist in organising a regiment of Europeans, and that an infantry regiment. The same is the case with Lieutenant Ross, who loses an adju- tancy by the transfer. This is not a whit more absurd than the practice of sending military officers employed in the civil department to join their regiments on a campaign, but it is all part and parcel of a system as bad as it can possibly be, the system of Staff appointments. In no other army in the whole world would such a spectacle be seen. Hut in the Indian Army and in India, people are so much accustomed to see extraordinary anomalies that they have become indifferent to them. When staff officers join their regiments on a campaign, there is a chance for them, for they can soon learn their duty from their brother officers ; but in the 3rd European regiment they will not have this advantage, as the other officers, accustomed to deal with native soldiers, will have to find out their own duty before they can teach others The staff officers ordered to quit their appointments and join the 3rd European regiment, no doubt think themselves hardly used 3 but it is a case in which private feelings must be sacrificed to the exigencies of the State ; they must blame the system which subjects them to such an unwelcome change at the same time they must thank it for having let them receive staff salaries so long. The State is the real sufferer, and always will be a sufferer, as long as they prtisricè is allowed to continue, of denuding regiments of the line of their main strength, and keeping up a complement of European officers, a great part of whom are paper men. If officers are to serve the State as paymasters, commissariat officers, civil magistrates, etc, what avails it to keep their names written down in the rolls of regiments they never see. When once the furlough regulations were altered, if they are ever so altered as to allow staff officers to visit England. and still keep their appointments, we shall see that officers once put on the staff will always remain on it and the absurdity of blocking up the army and rendering regiments of the line inefficient for want of European officers, will then become doubly apparent, and it is to be hoped that Government will then see the necessity of removing staff officers from the line, and allowing their places to be filled with men who must be content to remain with their regiments and the regimental duty. From authority which can hardly be doubted, we learn that Lord Frederick Fitz Clarence is to succeed Sir William Gomm, as Commander-in-Chief in India, when the latter officer goes home. Also that, for the future, no General officer who has not served at least six years of his time in India is to be named to command at either of the three presidencies. Further- more, we learn that when Lord Frederick goes to Bengal, Major General O'Neil, who came out to. this country with the 78th Highlanders, and is now commanding a division of the Madras Presidency is to succeed to the command of the Bombay army.
