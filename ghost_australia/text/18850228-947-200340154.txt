' ECHOES OF MELBOURNE (By The Ghost.) ,' The week just passed has been,' so far as; Victoria, is ' concerned j singularly barren, of incident^ and ' were it riot that the'sub marine . cable 'from' time to time affords subject for comment, journalists of; all! shades of opinion ' would have been; fairly 'gravelled for ' lack ' of matter.'' The news of the capture' of .Ehartoniri by the rebel Arabs, after a .defence,1 by the gallant Gordon that ' Svill ensure' his admis'sioninto' the valahalfa; British' heroes,', has .caused throughout '' the colony a sentiment of deep regret, ? and has served in : no small degree , to .in- . tensify the feeling of animosity to the' .GladstoneMinistry, which their invertebrate policy' in regard to' the' annexailiphbiisi-, ness first called into existence'.'
