A VISIT FROM THE DEAD. Sergeant Larner has been called upon to act as adviser to the Chinese at Golden Point. A few days ago Ah Coon, who some years ago acted as Chinese interpreter at Ballarat, waited on the sergeant to ask his advice upon a very serious matter. Ah Coon stated that one night he was asleep in his hut at Golden Point, when he was aroused by a tapping at the door. He got out of bed, and looking out saw, vanishing in tre darkness, a misty row of figures, with Chinese countenances and clothe in long flowing white robes Ah Coon wondered, but see- ing nothiug more, returned to his slumbers lu a few moments the knocking commenced again, and this time when oh Coon went to the door, ho savs the figures were more distinct, and he saw that the procession was headed b} the shade of an old Chinaman with a long white board. Again the procession of ghosts vanished, again Ah Coon returned troubled to bed, and again the knocking waa resumed This time Ah Coon pondered before he opened the door He was sure hi3 visitors were from the other world, and he mentallv re\ lewed his past life, to try and remember if ho had ever made any promises to the dead and left them unfulfilled He suddenly recollected that when tho ce meten authorities had, on account of the danger, objected to the burning of paper over the Chinese gran, es in the cemetery, he had promised to have a small fireplace and chimney erected there for the purpose of carrying out the Chinese custom of burn- ing a certain kind of paper at different times over the graves of the departed. The promise he had not earned out, an 1 he was sure that this accounted for the visit of the ghosts Having arrived at this conclu°iou, Ah Coon went to the door, and found the ghosts drawn up in a semicircle before him He addressed the venerable leader in Chinese, promising to have the chimney erected, and apologising for bringing them out in such weather Ah Coon has built the chimney and fireplace, and has since slept undisturbed The same Chinaman also informed the sergeant of another ghostly adventure some years before This time Ah Coon was awakened b} some- thing pulling his shoulder, and when he opened his eyes he saw a large cat with a white breast standing beside him He knew, from the cat's behaviour that it was not of this earth, but it did not appear to understand Chinese, when be addressed it m that language, and th° animal also appeared quite as ignorant of English Ah Coon then remembered that m China, the land of his birth, it was generally understood that ghosts cou! d not hold pens or pencils As this cat could not or would not speak, Ah Coon wanted it to write its requests or complaints, but there was a difficult} about holding the pen. Chinese mgenuit}, however, soon overcame all difficulties Ah Coon got on iron tea- tray, and having smeared it over with oil, sprinkled it with fine ashes The white-breasted cat understood at once With one of ita paws it wrote in Chinese characters on the tea tray that it was the spirit of a Chinaman, whose bod} was at that moment lying buried in a drive at Long Gull}, near Creswick It asked Ah Coon to have the body removed from the claim and decent!} buried, and begged that if such a thing as an inquest waabeld, the body might not be mutilated The cat then melted awa} into the air, and Ah Coon slept The next morning he states that he rode to Long Gully, found the body as described, and had it buried after an inquest at which there was no post- mortem examination held Ah Coon wanted the ser- geant to advise him as to what he should do m the event of another visit of the same kind, but Lamer informed "him that the thing was " out of his line " Bendtgo Advertiser
