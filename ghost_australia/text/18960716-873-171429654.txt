PROSE ABOUT PKO.'S. Sardou's first attempt at a p'lay was pronounced bj the father a miserable.failure. Butlater in life the eldei Sarduu recanted liis haish opinion, and used regularly to go to Paris from Cannes to be present at liis son's first nights. When " Patrie" was produced the old man said : •• It is all due to himself, for if he had listened to me he would now be a fourth-rate doctor or tooth extractor in the provinces." # # # # One of 'Gus Harris's last theatrical specs before his death, was a musicial play called " The Little Genius," which he got from Vienna, and on which be spent £2.' 00 for the London production.

Princess's management and the AOE concerning the remarkable varieties of just and unjust criticism appearing in the latter journal during the Potter-Bellew season.

Aon critic, whose notice of"Tosca" was about as unjust and undeserved a piece of criticism as has ever defaced a newspaper, complained of the absurdity of decorating Scarpia's corpse with candles and a crucifix, and pitched into Mra. Potter for imitating the great 8arah. The besiness was not Sarah's.
