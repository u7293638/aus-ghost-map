Isensahn" ("The Iron Tooth"), a drama writ ten by t)ie Emperor William II., In conjunc tion with Captuln Lauf, at the Royal Tlfca- -tre, was a notable event, socially and artis- tically. All the tickets had been sold nine days before, and tlie house was packed. . The. Emperor William appeared during the second act, and sat almost unobserved and quite' alone in the royal orchestra box, screen ed by the drapery from observation. After the first act there was complete silence. After the second and third there was rather vigorous applauBe, but from the par quet, where the erltlcB and literary people sat, and from the second and third galleries, there came a plercln :' storm of hisses.

The acting was ex cellent throughout, especially that of Herr Matkowskl (is Frederick of Hohenzollern and of Frautdn Poppe. '- eg
