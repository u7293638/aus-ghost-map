Sagacity op a Cat. Cats are undoubtedly the least remarkable for intellectual prowess of any race of animals of creation, but a grimalkin belonging to one of those aristocratic-looking mansions which add so much to the picturesque beauty of the Lake district, is now regularly performing feats equal to any ever performed by a four-footed creature. At tbe bouse alluded to (which we must omit to name), the inmates had been regularly aroused every morning by a loud knocking at tbe door, as if some one was in a hurry to gain admittance, and still, on going to the door, nothing could be found ; and time was when it would have been believed that the " De'il had business on his hand," yet, though the days of ghosts and goblins are gone, fears were actually entertained that some supernatural agency wsr at work, and, as tbe rapping, was quite regular, it was agreed to watch the door; and ac cordingly, one night early, when the full winter's moon was shining clearly, a person was secreted near the door, but had not waited long before a favourite cat deliberately climbed j up the knocker, and gave rap, rap, with first-rate human in- I genuity, and, on the door being opened, leaped down and wal&ed; in. Thus was the mystery cleared up The cat had before gone in unnoticed. Puss now performs this feat as regularly as clock-work every evening. Should any natu ralist doubt the veracity of this tale, he shall be instructed, on giving a hint, where he may see pussy perform her inge- j nious trick. -Westmoreland Gazette.
