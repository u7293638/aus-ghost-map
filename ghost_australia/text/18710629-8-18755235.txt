"WHAT A GHOST STOET DID." This (which is a good illustration of the danger of telling ghost stories to persons whose natures are unfitted to bear much excitement or hear tales of horror) is the title of a paper in Belgravia for February The story teller is a Major Gordon, and tho listeners are a family of friends, one of them being a young lady, Charlotte Masterman called " Charley ' familiarly by her family Major Gordon and his party are in a drawing room by moon light- there being no candles-and under the influence of the hour and the surrounding assooi ations he tells his sensation ghost story, bat with horrible results which he little dreamt of - The room we were in bad a large bow-wm dow at one end Close to this window, but rather in shadow, so that only the outline of his figure was visible, sat Major Gordon, near him, on a low chair, was Margaret Masterton , and Charley was on the floor at her feet, with her bands clasped on her sister s knee and her eyes gazing out into the moonlight, apparently fascinated by the weird shadows The rest of tho party were scattered in other parts of the darkened room It is at least ten years ago (began Major Gordon), that I was taking a walking tour through the northern pare of Sutherlandshire It is a curious part of the country for Buch an ex pedition , I can hardly say why I chose it perhaps from its being almost the only spot m my native land I knew literally nothing of I had been shooting woodcock with some fellows in the Hebrides, and a very jolly party we made When our sport was over, we all went east, to getber At Stonr I left them, starting on my own hook, in spite of mnoh chaff at my cbosing such a country, and suah a time-the end of November-for a tour I suppose none of you have been in Suthcrlandsbire, it is just about the wildest and most desdate place you can imagine, the wild grand scenery that impresses ono with admiration, mingled with a sense of one s own insignificance As I walked day after day through immense tracts of moorland, hardly ever meeting a human orea ture, a feeling of loneliness and utter desolation -a sort of hopelesenesa of ever again arriving at civilisation-came over me, and I resolved, that as it was my first, so it should be my last visit to Satberlandshire I must tell you there were hardly any inns I generally slept at farmhouses. The people \- were hospitable, though primitive, and my wel- come was generally cordial. I went on in this way for a week, when, feeling I had had quite enongh of it, I started one morning from my sleeping quarters, intending to walk some twenty miles to a town on the coast, whence a ooaoh went monthly to Inverness. I missed my way * for, as night began to close, I found my road stopped by a small river, with no means of crossing it. I followed tho banks for perhapB three miles. At last I saw a light ; on nearer approach I found it oatne from a eonsiderabl; sized house. Though now inhabited by a farmer, it had evidently seen better days; there were remains of handsome gatea ; part of tho original bouse hod been pulled down, part converted into farm buildings. One wing re- mained perfect, and towards a door in the centre of this I directed m; steps. After mach knooking, the door was opened by a servant girl, who stared when I asked if I cernid have a bed for the night ; and saving she would ask " the master," shut the door When the master came-a rather stupid tiiougb. plea- sant-looking man-lie seemed doubtful, was afraid they bad no room for stranger", but would see , I might come in and bave a rest and a bit of supper, if I pleased Nothing loth, I followed him into a comfortable kitchen, where his wifo was busy preparing the meal, and in a few minutes we sat down to enjoy it myself, the farmer, his wife, the girl who bal come to the door, and an oil woman, deaf, and seemingly hilf witted- the farmer's mother, as I fouud afterwards After supper I asked about my bed There arose a difficulty The wife ban), " There was was no room ' I suggested, " The kitchen would do " She said, " The mother slept there " 1 asked, " Was there another house near ? ' Sho said, ' Not for six miles ' At last the farmer whispered something to his wife She exclaimed, " For heaven's sake don't put tbo gentleman there ' ' I asked, " Where 1 ' And the man explained There were two rooms the; bad neycr used, there were queer noises in them-he believed they were haunted, but perhaps one of them might be better than the big barn, the only alterna tive ? I said, " Certainly I would face the ghosts " And, in spite of the earnest entreaties of tho wife, so it aas settled I went with the farmer to inspeot the rooms, and chose tbo smaller of the two There was no furniture in either, but the farming meta brought in three benobes, we placed them side by side, 6pread some blankots on them, and my bed was ready A glorious fire was made up, and, in spite of ghosts, I congratulated myself on my quarters On returning to the kitchen for my knapsack, the moment I appeared, the old woman ran towards me-I had no idea any- thing so bent and crooked had such pace in her -and Singing herself on her knees before me, prayed me, " For God's sake, do not sleep in that accursed room ! ' This rather startled me, but I thought her out of her mind, so tried to sooth her, assuring her nothing waa likely to happen, I was sure th ro was nothing m the rooms, and wondered they did not use them She only grew more earnest, sobbing and rooking herself baokwarda and forwards, crying, " I should be dead before morning ' She knew I should i It was just the same before ' ' Her words Beemed strange, but she looked a poor demented creature, so finding my sooth ing quite ineffectual, I out the matter short by taking m; bag and leaving the kitchen I wished the farmer good night outside my door, and waB alone The hot kitchen, after the long oold walk, had made me drowsy Before many minutes I was in bed and asleep How long I slept, I know not Something, I can bardly tell what, awoke me The fire had burnt low, still there was sufficient light to, see there was no one in the room save myself, but there was an icy chill crept over me, a con sciousness of not being alone possessed me I sat up and stared around There was nothing Still the feeling grew stronger Suddenly I heard a groan-anothor, deepor, louder, nearer -and a hand, oold like a corpse's, was laid on my shoulder I started round, every parti√≥le of blood froze in my veins, for I saw At this moment Major Gordon uttered a loud piercing shriek It was a trick. The whole story had been nonsense ' He only did it to frighten us but-the effeot was terrible His shriek was hardly done, when, almost joined to it, we heard a most fiarful cry, a long agonising scream You can never realise what it was like 1 shall never forget it It seemed really like a spirit being torn out of its body Another, louder still, but stopping suddenly noi as it were ended, but broken off in the middle-and Charley Mastcrton's head fell heavily on her sister's knee Everyone started np Major Gordon said, " Who Bcreamcd f You're none of you frightened, are you? Margaret laid her hand on Charley's head, saying, " My darling, what is the matter ? Didn't you know that it was only Alan's nonBense ? I knew hiB voice directly '" Then, as she grew frightened at the silence, " 0, Charley ! what is it 1 Do speak ' ' Bnt there was no anewor George sprang aoross the room " Sbe has fainted Bring a light Some one get a candle, or anything " Ho lifted berlin, lights were brought and she was laid on the sofa, but still she neither moved nor spoke George kept repeating, " She has only fainted, sbe has only fainted," But I saw how his whole frame shook, and his face became deadly pale, and a dreadful fear came over me that she would never speak again Alas, alas, it was so ' Charley Masterton was dead, had died of sheer fright ' She lay there with an awful terror fixed on her face We all stood ronnd for some seconds, too awe-stricken to do anything
