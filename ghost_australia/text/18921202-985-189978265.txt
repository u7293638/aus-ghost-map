Gladstone as a Soy. How He Thrashed a Schoolmate. A ghost tune ago Mr. Gladstone opened a workman's institute '; at Saltney, near Chester. After the ceremony was completed, Mr. Gladstone and several others who had been instrumental in the good work were invited to partake of tea. One of the company made the remark to Mr. Gladstone that he had been recently speaking to a gentleman who knew him at the time when he was a boy at school. "What is his name ? enquired the Premier. " Mr\x=req-\ ,of Liverpool," was the reply. "Indeed," ejaculated Mr. Gladstone, " and did he tell yon anything particular concerning our school days?" "yes, sir; he said that you and he onc^r fought, and vou thrashed him." " Ah1- I thought he would remember that; and did he tell you what it was we fought about ?" eagerly enquired the veteran, with apparent warmth. "No, sir; he did not," was the reply. "Then I will tell you," said the Grand Old Man, rising up with as much determination as if to enter 4& a debate. "He induced rue to steal some strawberries from a field, and when Z hid done so, he wanted to take all the best of them. Now, when I had run'all the risk off detection, I was determined not to let hir» have them; so we fought for them, and I thrashed him, and I stock to the strawberries. And when you see your friend again, will you kindly remember me to him, and tell *""» that I do not know whether.! could repeat the operation to day, as I huve not seen him for many years, and do not know what condition he is in; but I will mention this fact to you, that that field of strawberries was where Bold-street, Liverpool, now stands."
