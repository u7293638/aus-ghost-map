A Martyr of the Epidemic. Returning f«-m a joyous 'bout,' Where he had drunk the Old Year out, Joe Giggitus raided a jovial thout, And to a lamp-post staggered ; ' Dear friend,' quoth he, ?? of former years, Forgive my hiccup and my tears. I know my conduct strange appears, And 1 look wild and haggard. ' But trust me, darling, 'pon my wcid I'm set eo faithless as absurd ! I vow by all above you That while I tremble in the knees, And yioJently cough end sneeze, 'lis jon alone I long to please ! I patsicnately love you !' ' Leave eff acuddling of that pOFt! . You're like a mad or drunken ghost,' ' A 'bebby' cried, with frenzy. Said Jce, 'Yon should your manners mend ; I'm inly talking to a irimd. Oh, feel my puke ! You may depend I've caught ihe Infiucnzy.'— Judy.
