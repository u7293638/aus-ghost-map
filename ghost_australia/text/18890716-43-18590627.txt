THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing yon leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten. The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent. Hear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The atone yon might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That yon had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts ot kindness. So easily out of mind, These chance* to be an^ela Which eiea mortals find— They come in night an i silence. Bach chill, reproachful wraith. When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, ' Asi aorrow is all too gnat, To suffer our alow compassion That tarries natil too late. And it's not the thine you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone. Which gives you tha bitter heartache. At tb« setting of tbs sun.
