Tee Cement Industry. The newly-born cement manufacture of New South Walex has given up the ghoi-. Goodlet and Smith who have been strug gling 'uIook for some time say that the abolition of the duty has compelled them to give it beet. There 'may be some advantage iu these dislocations of industry which demanded legislation' to bring them about, but I confess it difficult lo detect them with the naked «ye. However, a hot discussion lias sprung up over the anheB of the cement indnstry. Mr D. O'Rielly, M.P., has rushed hotly into the breach to declare that the industry is no loss inasmuch «b the men wore only paid CJd an hour, and had to work in an unhealthy dust-laden ntmosphero. To him retorts Mr Goodlet that Ihe wages he paid «ere200per cent higher than the wages paid by German oement makers. That the same fact can be stated in such different terms is a curiously fine illus tration of tho class of rhetoric- which is tmployel in political controversy. The cement industry has collapsed not Bolely from the removal of theduty but from the phenomenal decline whioh has taken place in freights in the first cobt A the imported artiole.
