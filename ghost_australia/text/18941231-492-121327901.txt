A Village Ghost Story. A weird story is reported from a quiet little village on the slopes of the Mendips. Among the inhabitants rumours had been circulated (says the Daily Telegraph) that a ghostly apparition was to be seen after nightfall in the footway leading to the rural graveyard, and so gruesome were the tales told concern- ing the spectre that the path in question became deserted. At length the village patriarch started the theory that his grand- father had informed him, when a boy, that it had taken "thirteen persons and a woman" to "lay the spirit' of an old squire for 150 years in the Red Sea, that the time was ex- pired, and that he had returned again. Matters had reached this crisis when a local roysterer, after his daily pere- grination, and having dined not wisely but too well, so far forgot himself as to endeavour to reach his home by the dreaded path. The following is the account he gave of his experience that night : â€” 'I were a coom just to the churchyard, when from under the gert chestnut tree thur coomed the most horrible site I ever seed. 'Twur a tall figgur, and his face and hands were a shining just like a box of damp matches, and patches on him seemed to be all o' a-flame. It frightened I mainlee; me hair was as stiff as brissels, and I should have bolted, only my legs wouldn't run. I wur sober enuff now, and he coomed towards I, and not a sound did hur make, and when hur weer coomed quite close, he spoke in a terrible tone the words, ' Show me to my grave !' At that I found me feet, and hands too, and I went for'n, and I found he was a main solid speerit ; and didn't he holler for mercy, to be sure !' The victor of this midnight encounter is now the hero of the district around, and he carries in his pocket a rubber tennis-shoe as a trophy of his victory. The ghost has been confined to his house with a severe attack of influenza.
