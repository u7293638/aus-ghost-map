GODFREY, LORD CLEVEDON BY ROY TELLET Utboc of "The Oatcute," " A Draught of • and Prelate." &o.; CHAPTER XXIV. It was difficult to cross - examine Lady Olevedon'i mud. She was a good enough creature in the main, but like many lady m»id«, fall of affectations and morbid aeniibQities. A woman might bare managed her, bat she was altogether too skilful for the damsy treatment of a man. Lord Clevedon waa gravely courteous, as he always was to women, however low in the social soale, but he had no lightnets of touoh. He even managed to do what of all thinffs-iiehad been most anxious to avoid—he made Miss Gooeger fancy •bat-he suspected her of haying stolen the tnjniature. Then there was a scene enaoted on the debateable land between indignation and hysterica. Goodger clutched wildly at the air, as if for support, and, finding none, aaok limp into a chair. This in itself spoke volumes. 'Inj'ordinary oironmstanoee she would ttotWtf^'iat down in Lord Clevedon's ICC.

Then, tontitig!tolus mo>ther, he added— "There is no doubt 'a detective oame here, who was sec^t by Mrs. Beauohamp. I had an interview with the man my sell. He came'disguised as a waiter." ' "I never lieard.of such insolenoe," said the Po#iw^^|^g.mth indigna^on. "And moChce." " He' shouW have been bone-whipped," i^1di!.iastbv.' " I don't know what the world is cbming ko I And did he make op this •lioiy?" Lord <3levedon Imitated with his answer. Lafl^r Levarty looked at him with aa air of , assimous satisfaction. In his heart of hearts, .be did not believe that the detective bad made np this story—on the contraiy, he believed it tobe literally into. But he was not obliged to aay so. On the contrary, he was. bound, so long as it was possible, to defend his wife's fpatstioB. , "That was what be told me, mother," he said, " and no doubt,' be told Mrs. Beauchamp feheaame thing." "Thenf this atfOMOcis aaousation rects upon the word of a wretch like that? I suppose he wanted to extort money?" ' "No doubt this was one of hie objects," J said Lord Clevedon. " And, therefore, he tramped up this story ? Abominable 1" I "At any rate, he foond the miniature, "said Lady Levarty, "and where oould it have been? It must have been some where. Why should he •ay that it #aa in one Of Innooenoe • drawers ifit#e«e*olW>?' Again laord Clevedon paused before he replied. A sodden thought had struck him into silenoe. Mrs. Beauchamp's note was in his hand. He glanced at it again to make certain of its wording. No; there was no reference to a drawer in it. She spoke only of Lady Clevedonbedroom. Then how did his oousin know that the miniature had been found'in a drawer? Certainly he had not let out the fact. " Mrs. Beauohamp does not say that it was found in a drawer," be remarked quietly. " Doesn't she?" answered hisoousin, reddening slightly. "Ob, I took thst for granted when she said it was found in the bedroom. Where fflss could it be? A drawer would be the natural elaoe to keep it in." "Hardly/'said Lord Clevedon, 'if oonoeal ment was intended." "Of" course . not," said his mother impatiently. "It it clear that the whole thing is a fabrication—a monstrous fabrication. If that woman dares to sa; anything of the tort in public you must biftng aa action against ber foriibelf Godfrey." Lord Clevedon shrngged his shoulder*. Knowing what he did he knew that he should never take such a step. His conscience would not-{iermU4t,t JMiths* >was- there any ohanoe that, in the circumstances, such an action would be soooetsful. And all the while his mind was busy with oaaof rDr. Kaamnir's questions—" Has Lady Clevedon any enemy?" He had confidently answered "No," bat now he was no longer quite so confident. How had it come to pass hisoocsin kne* so much about the finding of the miniature? Those that hide can find. Was it possible that she had had a hand in the business ? No ; she was his cousin—she oould not stoop to treachery and baseness. And yet, now he came to think of it, be had more than once fanned that die was not really so well disposed towards Innooenee as she had endeavoured to appear. Perhaps she was jealous of Innooence; and a jealouft woman, so he had read, is oapable of anything. Certainly there was a time when he bad fancied that his cousin was in love with him. If so she might now bate him for having married another, and hate still more the woman be had married. Yes; Dr. Kenmuir mighb be right after all. But he coold not at once believe tt; he would keep his eyes open and be on the waboh. Was it noil more probable that his cousin had been watohing his wife ? " I do not think an action for libel would be of much use, mother," he said at length. " Is there anything else you can advise ?" But the Dowager was readier at the moment with vituperation than advice. " There never was a more abominable old creature," she said, referring, of course, to Mrs. lieauahamp. " No doubt, she is of good family; but then that's the very reason why she ought to behave differently. The very idea of breathing such a thing in connection with our family. And she is eighty, if eheis a day—almost dropping into her grave, in fact, with falsehoods like this upon her lips. And a religious woman, too! But that I believe is only when she feels ill." The Dowager laughed bitterly, but no one joined in the laugh. A moment later the door was opened noiselessly, and, to the utter astonishment of everybody, the butler announced— Mrs. Beauohamp.
