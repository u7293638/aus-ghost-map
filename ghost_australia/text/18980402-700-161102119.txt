Fraqk Bidgery tested with tuberculin a bull' that exhibited no' external syinptoms of tuber culosis. The animal, according to the local, paper, was healthy enough to give a fot of troulile and tear up things in general before the test could be administered. And yet' there was. a big rise in temperature, and when the bull was killed the lungs were masses of diseased matter. A medical man : who saw the post- mortem declarer! that it was a marvel that the animal lived. Ohly a few small pieces of lung had jJbeen left healthy enough to do respiratory duty. There is no., likelihocd of Parliament be ing dissolved for three' or four months. Bur. before the dissolution and general election electors will be called upon to vote for or against th6 Federal Constitution Bill. The f referendum on this great question will probably take place: during the last week of June, or somjsthing Hkfi three months hence.
