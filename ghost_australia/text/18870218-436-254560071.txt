SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB RACES. An Interesting day's racing took place at Caul- Held on Saturday, under the auspices of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club. The heat was very oppressive, and the attendance, which numbered about 6000, was below the average. Ariel beat a field of 12 in the Selling Bace, and was followed home by Liddington and The Ghost for places. The Oakleigh Handicap was won by Surprise, with Master John second, and Chicago third. The winner is not engaged in the Newmarket Handicap. The Hurdle Bace provided an interesting finish between Louis, Spartan, and Encore, the first-named winning by a nose from Spartan. Albert Loddon beat the favorite Bedouin in the Criterion Stakes, though the verdict might have been reversed bad the rider of the latter not made so much of his horse from the start. Goodwood beat 11 others in the Steeplechase, and Britisher won the concluding event of the dayâ€”the Hawksburn Handicap, with King of the West and Lesbia filling the other places. A serious accident happened during the running of the Steeplechase. Twelve horses were started at the end of the straight, and, as the distance to the first obstacle is very short, there is almost a certainty of some of the horses falling in a large field. Moonlight, Framlingham, Huntsman, and Salesman came down together. Mr. Cox,.who rode the last-named, was seriously injured, and M'Gowan, the rider of Framlingham, was struck on the face by one ef the falling horses, and one of his eyes was almost cut out. He waB removed to the casualty room, where Mr. Fitzgerald attended him, and thence to the Melbourne Hospital, the authorities of which stated that there was no hope of saving tbe injured eye. The committee of the Victoria Amateur Turf Clnb have now decided that the steeplechases shall start in the straight, and that the three fences opposite the grand stand shall only be jumped during the second time round.
