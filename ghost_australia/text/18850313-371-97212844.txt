T&e; Origin of Wigs. The patron saint of all wig-makers is St. Lonis of Franco, who, says a recent German writer, through the ingenuity of his mother, Queen Bianca, of Oastille, wore the first wig that ever graced the head of mortal man or woman. The story goes that when King Louis retained from a crusade to the Holy Land his mother was shocked at seeing that the hardships of the ; jonmey, together with the hot climate of Palestine, had robbed her son of all his hair. But besides being a devoted mother, Queen Bianco was an ingenious woman, who soon found a way out of her difficulty. Each knight at court, the color of whose hair had even the slightest resemblance to her eon's, was bereft of one lock, which, deftly joined, became an ornamantal covering for her son's bald head. The honor of being made the patron saint of wig makers ought, therefore, by rights to have been conferred on the mother instead of her son ; bnt there is some consolation in the fact that after a lapse of six centuries Queen Bianca's ghost arises, pointing out that, in spite of all saying6 to the contrary, not only in {He nineteenth century women may may be inventors, but that even at the dawn of the Middle Ages a woman founded an industry by which thousands at present earn their daily bread. â€” PaU Mall Gazette.
