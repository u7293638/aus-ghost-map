THE CYCC.ORAMA AND PALACE OF WONDERS. This attractive exhibition is now quite entitled to ite new name, as not only is it the Cvclorama, but a place of novelties. Not content with the grandeur of the marvellous production of the Battle of Waterloo the management is most liberal to its patrons. As an additional attraction tbe "Napoleonic illusion" is worth seeing alone, but this is not all. Hints have been thrown out that something more startling was in hand, and from what is saidtheeecond novelty of "Hydatapikilumina," or the "Laughing Fountains of Enchanted Waters," is to be one of the most startling novelties produced here. The production is said to be enchanting, and on almost as large a scale as that ot a similar kind at the Inventions Exhibition in London. Each jet thrown from the fountains is between 30 and 40 ft. high; the jets assume innumerable designs, and produce Â» combination of colours that is perfectly dazzling. The management deserves every encouragement in its extended enterprise, and certainly no visitor can complain of want of entertainment at the Cycloraraa. The "Ghost of Napoleon" will aleo be produced, and the enterprising Company having the sole right of tbeEe productions should reap an ample reward. " The Enchanted Fountain" will be produced at the Cyclorama for the first time next week.
