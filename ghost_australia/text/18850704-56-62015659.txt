Calm was the night in that still autumn weather And calmer still and colder were the twain Who, parting then, might yet have kept to gether If pride had not been stronger even than pain. There were no bitter tears, no sighs of Borrow, No sad reproaches uttered at the end ; And should they meet, years hence or on the morrow, 'Twill be with courteous ease, as friend meets friend. Ohl mocking word3 for those who once loved madly, Henceforth to be mere friends, not less, not more ; Deep in each heart a death-knell sounding sadly For love, deemed deathless, in glad days of yore. Not more than friends ; the voices mast not falter. Lest broken tones betray a vain regret ; And on the lips the forced smile must not falter, . To show how, 'neath that mask, grief's lines are set. Let them take heed, lest any word be spoken To rouse some ghost from oat the buried past; Though the dear ties that bound them once are broken, A strange spell lingers yet and holds them fast. Not Ies3 than friends; but ah I the friendship offered ? . Seems of such little worth, now. love is . done; ?Tia hard to take the hand thug coldly proffered And feel the tender, thrilling touch has gone. Gone with the day, when just one word was needed Those heavy clouds of pride and doubt to lift; But all in vain love's dying voice bad pleaded; Now far apart each lonely life must drift. And she will never know at their next meeting How hard he fought an outward calm to gain; Nor will he see beneath the friendly greeting, How her true heart still yearns to him through pain. — Bdgravia.
