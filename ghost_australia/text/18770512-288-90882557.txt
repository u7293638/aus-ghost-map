TIE MYSTEEIES O^ CRIME ; OB, THE EXPEEtBITGEB OF AW EDIlfBIiraGH Detective. — No. X.LVL [Published by special arrangement .with the ? ? Author.] i;: ; : ? A MAN- COQUETTE. The above is a queer title, 'and may make some of my readers- open ;their eyes. We are all familiar with the word 'flirt,1' but it generally conveys the idea of a young and-pretty girl who cfvii sport with the feel ings of the opposite sex in the most heartless manner till she herself gets bitten, and then surrers more tnan sne ever lnnictea on man. Coquette means the same thing. Somer how we never think of applying the words to men. Now xlon't jump out of your seat- for I am going to say something thatinay surprise you. The result of my experience is that male copuettes or flirts are quite as plentiful as female^-if not more. so. Many a poor girl, God help her ! can echo the truth of my words. Many a life has been clouded — many a grave has been filled— many a happy home darkened by these heartless, unpunishable monsters, ^^he. sin dors not seem so great — only to smile on a girl, treat her to much flattery arid a few kind attentions, get her id love -you, and then throw her off, have a .good laugh at her, and try the same with another — that is all. Yet it is a sin that blights — a sin that leaves a long train of darkness and suffering, in its wake. I don't know very well how to hold the scales in the following case — indeed, it will be seen that there was sin on both, sides, and on both sides^ directly or indirectly, was that sin heavily punished. I am no hand at moralising, but I think the story will point its own lesson. ' I was out at a small station in a village about amile and a half from the outskirts of Edinburgh, . looking over the books in search of an important piece of evidence, when my business^was suddenly, put a stop to by the entrance of a young man in a state of great excitement. .' ' ? ' 'Where's Fairlie ?' he demanded, nam ing the Superintendent. 'Ben the house, I believe, at his tea,' I answered, laying down 'my pen and shoving -back my seat, 'Anything serious the' matter?' ' Serious?' he echoed,as Fairlie made his his 'appearance, munching at his disturbed meal — ' I should think there is. Andrew Chisholm's got his twa een burned oot o* his held ; he'll never see inair in this world-— so the doctor says. We took him there first, an' 'he's there now— -sufferM* inaist awfif.' ; ' Hoot, toot/' coolly returned the police ; man, drawing on ;his boots; 'it- canna be sae bad as a' that, now.' 'Ay/ but it is; an' you're tae come 1 quick,' was the excited rejoinder. 'Ye'll do guess, now, j^Wsdune it a' ?' . ' Dune it ?' cried the policeman, looking : up in horror, with one boot on. ' Was it ; no an accident^' i 'No ; Jeanie Comrie did it a'. She got ? him tae meet her doon by the Cross Road, ' and then threw some burning' stuff oot o' ; a bottle in his een.

Jeanie bared her -great, strong arm before the little family council, and then held up Jessie's tiny hand, and bravely asked which was cut xaut hy Providence for service* Of course, there could be btft one answer} to tiliat; and love and devcfcion fcarrietl theday. Jeanie took a place in Edinburgh — no in ducements in money could persaade her to go further— and trudged out regularly every Sunday t© sie her little birdie, and let her nestle in her arms and tell her ail her pleasures and 'trcsibles. . But one Sunday Jessie had something to tell which she couldnt get out, let her try as she might, and as bo endearments on the part©? Jeanie 'were any more -successful in drawing it out, after much blusiring and shrinking, she had to be content -with Jessie's promise to let ler ** know all »ext Sunday.' The next Sunday came, and with it Jes sie's genfiy^breathed heart confession ; but Jeanie's face became like stone when she mentioned -the same .of Andrew Chiskolin. Jeanie had never been in love herself, bat she knew £hat'SH&n; and his reputation, and the mischief ;iie- had already done in his thoughtless way ,-and when she thought of the same, agony coming to her darling birdie she was chilled to the heart. ' ' You do net say anything,' said Jessie, timidly looking .up through the 'dim twi light, as they sat together after church iiours. ' You are not— not angry ?' ' Angry f Kb !' answered Jearae, forcing a smile and giving her a kiss. ' But I hope Jie will make you happy.' ' Happy ! i^em happy !' -unsuspiciously returned : Jessie, in 'an impulsive burst. ?' And 'he is -so good and hanfisome, and loves ale so naueh— and his eyes Pwlien they look down into mine I just think I'm in leaven!' Jeanie sighed, -and the tears crept into her eyes, and she -strained Jessie closer to her breast, as -if that would have saved the ethereal yeung girl from the evil she -saw looming in the future ;. but Jessie was so full of her«wn«weet joy that she saw and felt nothing of her. foster-sister's alarm. ' But about an Iiour after, when Jeanie turned down frena. the ; house t© take her solitary walk into Edinburgh, she met the man she so much dreaded coming towards the house, and, though loathing him in her lieart and guessing his errand, .for the first tame she felt inclined to address him and do all in her power t® earn his good will. ' 'What are you' doing here ?'. she asked him, rather bluntly, and watching his hand some face Jkeenly through . the darkness, after a few trivial questions , and. answers. ' I wish I could ask him what he means to do!' she added to herself. ' But, though it might save her a world of after, paip, Jessie would never forgive me.' 'Oh, nothing,' was the careless and smiling reply. 'I naif engaged to take your Jessie out for a walk, that's, all.' 'From my soul I believe you,' thought Jeanie, with her hands clenching instinc tively under her shawl. '*- A walk— that's all. My wee birdie's heart broken— that's all.' Then, as calmly as she Gould force iierself to speak, she added — ' Are you as great a flirt among the girls as ever ?' :, , ' A flirt — oh, thaf s ail nonsense that the $ people talk,' he smilingly replied, evidently I taking the implication 'as a compliment I ** It's all stuff — none of the lassies will look I at me.' f Jeanie read the shallow artifice, and the \- --shallow, vain man that put it fortk-tfarougb. arid through ; and then said, in a quiet still ?way that startled him— ' I nad a reason for asking.' 'Ha, na, ha ! You had, indeed ?' de lightedly Tejoined the maawjoquette ; ?*'? and what was the reason ?' - 'Because I don't want you to flirt With our Jessie,' was the steady, unmoved reply. *? flow ? — what do you' mean ? Do you want me not to go near her?' he asked, drawing on a doleful look. ' j$b, not at all?' she answered trying to look frank and smile 5 ' you may go near ter as often as you like, and take her walks too,, if my father allows it fr but don't JKrt ?with jher. Don't trifle with her feelings. . let every word youisay to her be true and sacred, as if you uttered it before the bar' «f God.' ..;.?- V; ; ' Haj ha, ha 1 Lord^but you would make a capital p3?eaeher,Jeame,' cried the empty . headed fo&z; ~i' I nev«r thought you1 had so . jnuch of th^ stuff in yaui' She turned away with & sickening pang.

Can it be believed? Does it not seem incredible that a man should lay himself out to such a silly, heartless end ? It may be believed, for I speak the truth, not of one alone, but of hundreds. Jeanie could not rest at her work, but by Tuesday had so wrought herself up in alarm that she rose an hour earlier and wrote a long letter of warning out to Jessie. Jessie read it in wonder. She could not understand how her dear foster-sister could be so prejudiced, pitied her not a little, and, moth-like, continued to flutter round the flame that was to consume her. For two three weeks Jeanie noticed her happiness steadily on the increase, and had almost begun to hope that she had judged the man harshly, when there came a sudden blank. The haggard look on Jessie's face struck a sudden alarm to Jeanie's heart the moment she reached the house one Sunday forenoon; and there was no church for her that day. Her father went, but, the two girls being left alone, it was not long till Jessie was sobbing hysterically on the strong loving breast of her foster-sister. ' He has not come near me for more than a week — and — and I heard that he was goiog with another girl I' sobbed the poor slirink ing Jessie. ' Oh, Jeanie, if I should lose him. now it would Mil me !' Jeanie could have said, woman-like, ' I told you so — I knew it from the first,' but she didn't. No ; she kissed the tears away, and resolutely tried to push back those in her own eyes as she whispered — 'Hush! dearie — you are perhaps too good and pure for Mm. But do not dis tress yourself — you shall soon know what he means to do, for I shall go to him and demand to know.' 'Jeanie, Jeanie!' cried the timid suf ferer, starting up before her like a white ghost ; ' oh, you would not! Never, never ! I would not have it for worlds. Promise me now — do, like a dear girl — never to allude to it in any way to him.' 'Well, well — I promise,' said Jeauie, more to drive away the terrible scared look from the face before her than from, any idea of what the words meant. ' If he loves me he will come again,' rea soned Jessie,' in a half-hopeful strain, ' for we never quarrelled. The only thing that may have offended him was when he asked mein a light way if I would like to be his wife. The words so took my breath away that I couldn't speak for some time ; but at last I stammered out, 'Yes, in a year or two.' Then he laughed outright, and said I was a great fool, with a lot of other play ful words like that, and he never came back again. I think I haven't been quite modest enough in my answer — eh ?' ' Modest enough ?' echoed Jeanie, draw ing her closer. 'Oh, the monster! the heartless brute, that could treat you thus ; ; he doesn't deserve the name of Ja man.' ' Oh, but he does,' gently interposed Jessie. ' You don't know how kind and good he seemed to mer But I don't cai'e what he is — though lie is the worst in the . whole world — I love him, and that makes all the difference.' ' It does indeed,' sighed Jeanie, bitterly, and then an awkward silence fell on the pair, as if there was like to be- a kind of es trangement between them. But it was only for a while— they knew each other's hearts too well, and loved each other too deeply and devotedly, to allow a mere difference of opinion to separate them, and, having now uuburthened her griefs, Jessie appeared to brighten hopefully as ; the sday advanced. That same night Jeanie, in turning in towards Edinburgh from the village, learned Chisholm's intentions without the asking, i for she met the pretty-faced villan with ; another girl hanging on his arm, and he, as conscious of guilt, did not dare to meet her,ifeut slunk suddenly off the pathway, right across the muddy roadway, and got past her thus with averted eyes. 'Ah! so! I knew we would under stand each other by-and-bye,' she muttered v standing still and looking after him. ' My wee birdie is to droop and droop— perhaps die — and you are to go on, and on, and on, and no -one is to say nay ? We'll see, we'll i-iSee! Vva. strong — very strong at times— and' I may spoil your beauty arid fine eyes .vsome day, if the fit only comes on. Wait !' . Jeanie -said nothing to Jessie about the en counter — she would not have augumented her grief by one feather's weighty but jjessie1 had -quite enough evidence of the 3riri&shovted; under her own notice to make : ilier cry her eyes red arid inflamed every ' oiight longhand make her sink and pine away still she was -a mere walking shadow^ An J ?unaccountable dimness in her eyesight, which came on shortly after a slight Chill In ihe morning, at last alarmed her adopted father, -and he took her to the resident medical man, who at once pronounced the trouble to be cataract of the eye in a mild form, and dismissed them with a ^lotion o£ some kind, and a few common-place words about keeping, cheerful andavoiding cold. : But the eyes got dimmer arid dimmer and upon Jeanie's arrival on the following Sunday .-she peremptorily insisted1 on Jessie being taken in to an Edinburgh Professor liextday. This Was done, and the great man's decision was that the cataract would' have to be removed by an operation which ! afr present 4he patient was imi^y Tobust j And so they returned konie, wTthlHumvy' 1 load on then.' hearts, but with Jessie cer || tainly the most cheerful of the three, and [I even trying a smile as she said she would I make haste to got strong as soon as passible, j so that the thing might be done and she I would see their dear faces again. IJ-.it J Jeanie, when she looked down on the white, ? emaciated face, only turned away and I covered her eves with the covnor of Ik.h II aliawl, and then cried in a quiet way a3 if I ahe would never have stopped. II Days and weeks passed away, but Jessie j got weaker aud weaker, till at last she was j hawlly ever out of bed, and Jeanie had to I get away whole days at a time from her j place in Edinburgh to keep the house in I order for her father, and soothe Jessie with her presence. The doctor came regularly, and, without hesitation, pronounced the disease consumption ! Consumption ? ' Well, I daresay, medically speaking, he iras right; but I would give it another Rime. Strangely enough, during all this time of sickness, Jessie had never once pro nounced Chisholni's name, nor in any way alluded to him. But one Sunday, when the father was at church, Jeanie heard herself called hurredly. Jessie, whom abb had fancied asleep., had started up in bed, with her stony eyes turned eagerly towards tho fireplace, ' Hist ! Jeanie dear, are you there ?' she eagerly whispered. 'Here, dearie — here,' was the quick answer. 'That's his step! and his voice!' cried the trembling sick £irl. ' Run to the win dow — quick — and tell me how he looks, or if he is coming here !' Jeanie obeyed; and there, sure enough, she saw Chisholm walking leisurely and laughingly past the house, with a girl lean ing on his arm. Jeanie stared at him with a face of marble ; but she could find no voice to say anything to Jessie. ' He is going away— I hear him going away,' sadly whispered the blind ghi. ' Jeanie, dear, tell me, did he look towards the house ?' A burst of sobs *nd a wild clinging in Jeanie's strong arms was the only answer. ' Ah, you're afraid to answer — afraid to hurt me,' sighed Jessie, running her soft fingers tenderly over Jeanie's loved features. 'But, Jeanie — now, don't shrink and shudder — there was another step with his — it was a woman's, and it went with his — was she — was she like a sweetheart ?' ' Don't ask me, Jessie — don't, if you love me I' burst in Jeannie at last. 'Ah, I knew she was a sweetheart,' sighed Jessie. ' I hope she will make him a good wife — I hope she will be kind to him, and neveivgive him a cross -word. He deserves a good wife, though everybody does speak against him. I wasn't good enough, or strong enough, or pretty enough — didn't deserve to be his wife. Poor fellow, it's as well he gave nie up, for how he would have suffered to see me sinking thus ! Don't cry, Jeanie, for you must have guessed the truth long ago — I am never to see you again. There now, don't — don't, or your eyes will turn . just like mine. No, Jeanie, I will never see you again, for my strength will never come back, and the operation will never be made.' She was not done speaking, though it was more than she had said for weeks, but a ghastly spasm crossed her face as she got the last w®rd out, and drew a scream of alarm from the strong girl who had her in her arms. Jeanie flew for the medicine, but before she got back to the bedside the blood was oozing from between the lips of the doomed girl, and her hands working convulsively in the air. Jeanie raised her in her arms — wiped everything from the lips — prayed aloud, as she had never prayed before — and then bent her ear to catch, what tlie moving lips were saying. 'Tell him — tell him — I'm gone to heaven !' were Jessie's last words, andhalf an-hour after uttering them she was calm and smiling, but her heart was stilled for ever. Jeanie allowed herself no rest. She carried the dear form in her own arms into the room — dressed it as tenderly and lovingly as ever mother did child — drew a white counterpane over it — put down the blinds — and then went back to the kitchen, took up her Bible, and tried to read or pray — anything to keep out thought. Her father's step took her quick to the door. He noticed nothing, but said anxiously — ' Jessie — is she any better ?' fi Come in, father,' said Jeannie, tenderly, but with a strange calmness — ' come in, for I am all you have now. Jessie is dead.' Jeanie waited till after the funeral, and then went back to her place in Edinburgh f or a few days before leaving it to come home, finally. She had sworn over Jessie's grave that this should be Chisholm's last victim, but, after thinking of the means, she had still enough of good training in her to naake . it a hard struggle to actually come to the deed. At last, just as she was leaving the town, in a half-maddened state, she got the vitriol. Sending for Chishobn, then de terminedly blinding him, were easy after that, and thus ended her story. But mine is not done yet, for perhaps the most curious part of it all is to come yet. Jeanie -was duly tried^ but, being defended by an able lawyer, who knew well how to make the most of the points I have brought out, she got off with eighteen months' im-, prisonment. * _ ; But here comes the. strange thing. When she had been about a year in prison, she was attacked by precisely the same symp toms as Jessie, and for nearly three months was.in hospital, .almost totally blind. It was during this period of temporary darkness as she afterwards confessed to me, that she first recalled my words, ' I hope you may live-to repent it,' andbythe time she again saw the light she was thoroughly subdued, and the first, use she made of her eyesight . was to write a long letter— beautiful and touching in the extreme— to Chisholm, imploring his forgiveness, and offering to do anything in her power to alleviate his affliction. Now, it so happened that though Chisholm had recovered the use of one eye, : hia sight was so far injured as ±0 forbid the - prosecution of Ms ordinary calling, and as soon as Jeanie was released lie thankfully ', accepted her offer to take the post of gate keeper in a factory at the outskirts of Edin burghj.iii which her own fattier now held a position.of ..trust. In .this position of affairs it '. came about that Ohiskolm and Jeanie. often met, and always as friends. !lt. is said that pity_ is closely akin to love; but whether this., is true or not, Jeanie's sympa thy so jfar. merged into a, warmer feeling that when at last the changed man -Featured/ to-ask her hand.in marriage in the presence of lier'father -she did- notref use, b'rtt actually went down on her knees and said that her whole life; ws©uld be devoted to making him happy* . :,._,- ; ; j '??; ' And so stheywere married; and. so X-.' r wish-nay story- could end; but, if I am to , be truthful,, it eannot. Two years after her ; jnariiage the .dimness in Jeanie's eyes' re- turned ; and, tkis time, instead of going to a properly quailed medical man, she was inaucea to consult a quaet oculist, wlio professed to cure cataract without cutting. The consequence was that 'her sight was ^erjsanently injured, an& while the sight of .her husband's one^eye seemed to get clearer, she. gradually receded into darkness, and finally 'became totally ;hlind. Her hus band's devotion, patience, and. cheerfulness ; at last seemed to reconcile her to her fate ; , and now t&at; ten years of married life have passed over their heads, [and a blythesome family is springing up around them, con-, sideling the distressing circumstances, I daresay , there is not a more agreeable or happy couple in Edinburgh. ; ?-? ?; -' ? =»* — ?
