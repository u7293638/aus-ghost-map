A REAL GHOST. A correspondent forwards the following extraordinary story to the London Daily Telegraph. The inhabitants oÂ£ the fenny dis drict between Peterborough and Wisbech have been thrown into a state of great excitement of late by the report that an old farmhouse near Thorney was haunted, and that the residents, a farmer named Wilson and his -wife, had been obliged to leave their abode. It appears that the inmates of the house were first made aware of the presence of the mysterious visitors by hearing several knocks at the door of the house, and this continued for some time, until matters got to be so .unbearable and the ivife became so upset that, had she continued in the house, serious consequences might have re sulted. The "ghost" invariably commenced operations by a series of very gentle taps on windows and door, the force of the knocks gradually increasing until they finished up with a terrific crash which shook the house. The fame of the " haunted house soon spread, and thousands of persons, have visited the place, including several spiritualists, one or two taking up their abode in the house for the night, but being obliged to leave it before morning dawned. A school in spector, who had been" examining some chil dren, paid a visit to the farm out of curiosity, and the knocks were heard as he held the door open. This gentleman became so deeply im pressed that he wrote to the neighboring clergyman that he. was convinced it was a spiritual manifestation. Another gentleman from Wisbech, said to have the strongest nerves in the Eastern counties, was obliged to take his departure from the house after hear ing the kocks, and many people from long dis tances, bent on investigation, have been un successful in their endeavors to lay the ghost.
