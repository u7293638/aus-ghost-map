ODD VOWS The annals of cbirolr; abound in records ot? vows more or less romantic or absurd. Fotf instance! Queen. Joan of Naples, at a grand feast at her castle of Garta, honoured tbri Knight Galeasso of "Mantua by opening the bait with hioS, When the dance was finished-thd grateful knigbt kneeled down.before his roya|. partner, and to fitly express bis acknowledge moot of -the honour he hod received, be took 4 solemn vow to wander through the world, visit* ug cvf^y country where feats of arms wpm performed, and pot rest tin til he had trahdueol two v^iant knights, and presented them ail prisoners at his Queen's footstool,to he disposed of.at her royal pleasure.. The doughty warrior* after a year spent in wandering all over ISuropt^ returned and brought his two prisouera to the Queen. She-took the gift very gracefully! and, the admiring^ historian, tells us, declined - her right to impose rigorous conditions ou hep captives,and gave tbem libiriy without ransom. . Whether they properly punished Sir Gale&zzo; for - his. interference' with their personal rights we arenot told, -v Some regard a vow as a.reslrainiog bond of a very elastic character, especially .whoa it inter feres with their desires,. Benedick, when ho found bis vow of^celibioy; top - great a<strain upon Him in the presenoe of hisBe»trioe'« . charms,disposes of it fearlessly andfinally with' • the plea; " When 1 said 1 would die a bachelon 1 did not think I should-?livie till' X 'were married." : ."7> V Often we have the letter of die irowevaded : with some special reasoning,' aodthe spirit thent broken with impunity. For instance, a modon* Bip Van -Winkle vowed that he would oarer drink another drop of liquor aslongat he bad hair on his bead. A few hours later he was meh coming out of a bather's shop with a shaven poll.; - ■" vtlaoisslt in lovn often make strange vows. • - We all remember the case of poor Miss Harris ham, in Dickens's story, wbOwn* so overcome by her lover's failure to appear at the wedding -' that shebrdered everything in Rehouse tobe - unchanged as it had been pleoedon thafchap lentiay. : Years went by,- and tbe"w«dding toast remalnedseton the teble, bhd rich cakes mouldered and;swere" ^eaten j^themioe, whSlp" the fToovhalraemetited ladyflittedln and bht of the deserted rooms of ttahqutelikBa ghost, - always- wearing the s^ite d^s tmd vril which she had pnton^te welcome the fkitblesalover whobevercamo. - " • Jk similar case to this was that of a lady 0®_" higfannkin ISoglaod. who, beio^ jilted by;! h'er lover, wont to bed knd riiwedsbewoulA ceverget op again, and 'kept her w6«1 for 25 years,;/A less excusable case than this was tbatpf a man who, finding^ that bis wife was ;.' disposed bo demand too much harfjworkfrdm; him, took to hia hied and eUyed there, " For 22 years this wor^ilew.fellow stayedbetween tbe sheets,while his wife waited ou bitn an d fed' himjriihpmsMtntderohioDu:v Vows of petpbtnsV^tenoe' ate numerous, the . only troublo briDf^hatHihase who need this vpwmust dopirtteWit OawJine, tn li^,vbwedtbat B^wotUdhevOTapeakappther wprituany. human ^b^^, brt»auw ^e bad a -' gpaoel, With fcer^iovBt * ' ^OT~i^7ean^itq& the day oF her doath,she was :nsT«knbwn to ^ utteraWord;; '•£ ; LSonmyeftrsagD three waters livedtogCther.
