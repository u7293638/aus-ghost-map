CARDINAL MORAN AND THE BISHOP OF GOULBURN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.. Sir In a former le* cr I distinctly pointed out trio misstatements made by Dr. Chalmers in his recent attacks on the Catholic Church. In his letter published in the Studley Morrilla Uri aid on yesterday he refers hides d to my accusation, but makes no attempt at defence, and we may therefore presume that he allow a judgment to no by default Ho plunges, however, into a number of other statements which, he says, " may serve to open people's eyes to thopiofuno absurdities " of Catholic teaching These statements, however, which he his forth are not Catholic teaching but are the mere effusions of his own poetical an invention. It was a Scotchman, I believe, who said of some Angbc m friend that he never opened his mouth but he put his foot in it Some similar sid and perverse fate appears to have befallen my good friend of Goulburn. He returns to the question of the orthodoxy of Kconan's Catechism, and thus writes-" in order that in this case there may be no pi offence of mutilated cTtiicts, I will give as full the question and I answer to which I referred He then cites as for j leaves the question and answer -to Question: Must not Catlrolres believe the Pope him self to be infallible ? Answer This is a Protestant invention It is no article of the Catholic faith, As Now, I regret to be again obliged to accuse Dr Chalmers of inaccuracy Irr Uro question in the catechism as cited by him one small particles H omitted, which, however, is of no small importance. The question as put in the catechism is, " Must not Catholics believe the Pope in himself to be infall - lible " The technical words, " the Pope m himself infallible," refer to the personal infallibility of the Pope, which is among Protestants fable, and is quite contrary to the teaching of the Church According to the Catholic doctrine tim Pope is infallible only when he spoils ci cathedral that is, when in the discharge of the office of pastor and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of the Supreme milestone) authority, he defines a doctrine concerning forth of morals to be held by the Mary eral Church It is in this case alone that Catholics believe the successor of St. Peter to inherit the infallibility with which the Redeemer endowed First Church vv him He said to the Apostles, " Go ye, and teach all nations , teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world" I beg to remind Dr Chalmers that I am not minimising in any way the teaching of the Church, but men very stating what the belief of the Church is Cardinal Manning states that, by the Vatican decrees regarding infallibility, II all the arts of the Pontiff as a private person, or in pi iv to doctor, or as a local bishop, or as a sovereign of a State, are excluded In all those acts the Pen till may be subject to error , in one, and only one capacity, he is exempt from el for that is, as teacher of the U boat Church " Cardin vi Uergeniotlier also wrrtcsthat the mf fallibility of the Pope, " which is his only as leader, pleases him indeed from falsifying the doctrines of the Church as to faith and morals, but is no necessity that he will always rightly apply these local men, and novel personally commit an offence against them " Dr. Chalmers omits other passages of lYceiian's Catechism which allow no doubt as to the visitor's mc ning, as for instance when at page lithe told-, us that Christ appointed St. Peter and his success 1rs as Mrs chicrvicarn to govern His Church, and when again we read in the following page -"Question Does Chief anywhere oITi r up a special pi Tyer for Peter's faith without including in this prn cribe i out of the Apostles ' Answer Yes Luke was , 32, Chaff says to Peter But I have play ed for thee that thy faith fail not, and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren " Dr. Chalmers takes me to task in that I was content with cape lining Chiron Oakley's wot do, and made no reference to rather a series cited from Father Faber and A Lapido But as the passages thus cited by Dr Chalmers were practically the same, having explained one I gave the key to the explanation of all The war ors thus referred to merely teach the Catholic doctrine that in the my story of the Incarnation our divine Lord assumed our human nature in the chair to womb of the Blessed Vu gui Fins is the doctrine which Dr Chalmers himself is supposed to profess in the Athanasian Creed As regards latest labor, to whom Dr Chalmers now particularly refers, he indignantly rejected the tent of the presence of the Blessed Virgin in the Eucharist, but he writes that the most precious Blood, the price of our redemption, which is there lectured was assumed from the entire blood of the Blessed Virgin and he takes occasion from this to ii tufa trato how beautifully the dogma of the Immaculate Conception harmonises with the mystery of the Incarnation In the paragraph immedi italy preceding the words given by Dr Chalmers Fithu labor thus stated -"The Precious Blood \ na assumed directly to our Blessed Lord's divine Person from His Immaculate Mother Mary's blood WOJ the main road out of which the Holy Ghost, the third person of the most Holy Trinity, the artifices of the sacred Humanity, fashioned the Blood of Jesus Here we see how? needful to the joy and gladness of our devotion to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception "Wind could boat to think that the matter of the precious Blood hade cr been closely connected with the name of sin, that it had once been part of the devil's kingdom, that what was to supply the free price of our redemption was once ousJavcd to God's darkest, foulest enemy g Is it not indeed an endless daily jubilee to us that the Church has laid upon us as an article of our faith that sweet truth which the in- stincts of our devotion had so long made a real part of our belief " The teaching; of the illustrious Jesuit commentator, A Lapide, is nothing more than a repetition of the same doctrine As regards Rev Dr Littledale, it was stated in an obituary note co in an English journal that he held a benefice in England Whether this be correct- or not is a matter of no interest What is of am portance IA the fact that he is quite discredited as a control results A pamphlet which he entitled] 11 "Why Itituaksts do not become Roman Catholics '? was convicted of such uni- lath fulness and in fairness by Mt O by Simply that the English Church Union, mular whose auspices it was published, was compelled to withdraw it from circulation Di. Cb lemon remarks of I Littledale s " Plain Reasons " that it remains undefined " Dr Glinlnieis must suppose his readers to be very ignorant of Catholic literature when he ventures on such a statement Many years ago ltwasrofutcd by Father Ryder at the Oratory in a very cheap, clear, and concise work entitled " C ithohc Controversy A Reply to D Litt led al ozs Plain Beacons ," and since then every argument in it has been a hundred times un- masked by Father Jones, S J and other Catholic writers What is deserving of remark, not a few Anthem clergymen have opposed the inaccuracies and errors of the pro tedious work which Dr Chalmers eulogises For inst mee Rev Dr Lee, vicar of All Saints', Lambeth, tabulates the gross mistakes of the "Plain Reasons " as follows -" Regarding historical facts, 51 regarding dogma heal fact?, is, regarding m accurate quotations from an item on history and canon law, 23 reg tiding historical and theological quotations half made, often with remarkable √ç missions, 20 loaning quotations from the Fathers which are found to bear an entirely dif- forces meaning from that which Dr. Littledale put upon them, 21, pc " Rev Dr Lee's description of his method of controversy would seem almost a picture of some of Dr Chalmers's letters " When he has been opposed and refused, he never confessed and age of uses, but waits Idaho thinks that the reputation is forgotten, and then brings up the discredited, statement as flesh is over " Such is the controversialist who, according to Dr Chalmers's pretentions colony, has never been refuted Dr Chalmers has helped more than once on II supposed misstatement of mine regarding some Protestant nuns at Goulburn I stated that in an excellent community of such nuns, introduced there several j cars are, about half the number became Catholic-! I believe my statement to be quite correct The priest is still living who received three of them into the Catholic Church, and the Bishop is still living who administered the sacrament of confirmation to two of them after being received into the Church to say that they were not real nuns is a mere subterfuge Everyone recognises that it is only in the Catholic Church true nuns are to be found However, those excellent Indies lived to gether, visited the sick, and were popularly known as Protestant nuns I consider, therefore, that I was fully not at d in the statement which I made Asregaidbtho "Wesleyan missionaries in the islands of the Pacific, to whom Dr Chalmers also refers, they are quite able to take care of themselves. Anj st lemons which I made relating to them I be leave to be conform able to truth, but I decline to act cept Ins patronage in their leg ird Perhaps how - over, it is his desire as a result of the synodal deter invitations to expound the motherly mouths of the Anglican Church over them For my part if such be the cape, I wash all joy to the happy family The Anglican Church, half a century ago, was described by Lord Mac today as a bundle of coupons systems without number a hundred sects battling within one Church " Fjmbrncuig now the various branches of Nonconformists, the number of her sects will be ten thousand, and at no distant day her proud! boast shall be more than realised that she includes within her undefined pale, pnttieausof every religious tenet, therefor opinion, however opposite and contradictory, winch Protestantism has lit mu tune or by any agency introduced into the wet Iel " Dr. Chalmers ends his letter with what he evidently intends to present at a Fren ch quotation, but what in reality is sheer French balderdash It might well pass muster at some of the synodal meetings , but before he won turns again to cite French in the public press I would recommend him to consult some friend acquainted with the idiom of the language Asaparhug word of advice to Dr Chalmers, I would say, "Do not write my further controversial letters for some time " ty is manifest that the more he plunges, the deeper he sinks in the mire. 49 Stuck in the mud would perhaps, be a some what awkward epitaph for " William Goulburn " I have endeavoured to stretch out a helping hand to him but, as he appears to resent my friends aid, it only remains for me, Mr Editor, with j our kind permission, to leave him there I am sec t PATRICK'S CARDINAL MORAN.
