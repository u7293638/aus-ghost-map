THE STORY-TELLER. MT MES. tflTZ ALLEN." Br MABIE VIRGINIA. HARDING. (itetû York Herald.) \- Alaine and I had just come out from the banker's. In my seat in tho opea fiacre that we had kept waiting I had raised my parasol and was listening to my daughter as she gave the nest order to the cocher. Then I saw'three ladies pass walking rapidly. Closing my para "BoYÏ'was on the carriage step'at once. Hy daughter, amazed, stared, nt joe, the cocker, m^ix reins well in hand, turned around.in his seat. For a moment I stood there undecided. ..y.Wha^isitP Alaine was frightened. . "JDo you see those three ladies ? I am anre that's an old friend of mine. How . tall her 'girls have grown I" "Well, why don't you speak to her then f Hurry, or they will be gone Î" I stood-irresolute ; then sank back in my placé. "She wouldn't know me; it would only be a trouble." *. Who ts she P" Alaine asked. '**Ä Mrs. Fit/. Allen. No one you " What stunning complexions those S'rlshad ! They were very striking, but ey were dressed in bad taste," con- tinued tho little maid by my side. Our horse succeeded at last in freeing himself, after 'knocking us against various , .carriages and calling down a torrent of thé '' sweet French language - grown strangely harsh and cutting in John's -monta.' Shaking externally and intern- ally we made our way np the Bue Scribe ana homeward, and when, an hour later, we reached our apartment, I had for Sotten having eeeu a friend of my child ats in Mrs. Fitz Allen. But now at .;, Will I readily recall her as she passed j|fijb'her tall daughters on that sunlit ennimer morning in gay Paris, passing iwi Wey, noisy Rue Scribe.

' goolang back, I almost feel as if some- thing was not right about my own ma- chinery, "the"'wneel of "imagination ran so smQp^hlyi (^f^lr, and with such easy mastery over all o{;aer forces. AU must .. b§ equal tqmafce a perfect whole. I: am eeejnngithis.edncatipn tor Alaine; she is rather young as yet for me to see any re- sult, bnt I ¿eel that it will be a great success. She will be of the world world- ly and one of ita shining Kght6.fJThe training required in this century, when, completed; reaches to this pinnacle. On 'thè tôâd the pupils cannot walk slowly ; the hasty wind has no time for loiterers ; they must do as they do, strive on. Alaine's nature perfected will be proof against all things to which her mother has been prey-blessed child ! My par- ents, had they wished to see me perfec- ted, mast have been sadly thwarted, not |n one respect only but iu two. My im- agination, my heart, are phenomenally «sfetiwe. The. latter must have had no i^tmore than the covering of a wafer, for K'4t ibas been ruthlessly plundered, even * «ito the present date, and this' last touch /-^waS brOkdeir, deeper than tbe others \-- 'the impression lives with rne. ii'^'Brforè the winter overtook ns I ex ^gorlgd ia promise from Alain's French f^amltb go to (^rniáfiy with us. But it *Hv^i' the,end oft.a hard winter before I . ^ould. induce Jose actually to leave her Adorable charming Paris for the laud of jrttUuvtl «onnde and bleak winds? How- ever, .between : ns-Alaine, myself, and b.tnk uotis - we succeeded. Before starting I received a note in reply to one sent to a secluded and highly recom- mended pension steting that the honoured ladies would find accomodation and were expected on the 4th. We had al- way«! heard and were convinced that the h ist Gorman was not the Saxon German, aud/speat some time iu debating to what city we should go. If we went to Han .'.over, where Alaine would gain'the -purest accent. I should surely die of the cold. ^?ho North Sea ou the map looked blue 1 enough..; But even in my room over the ',jftrej,the .thpught of it sent the winds Í¡cross me. So as I had no idea of leav ng my onty* child an orphan I gave up the accent. Let it suffice to say we took ? ; «IE ou£ i68"*6006 MI Berlin, aud reinaiuod .'«ont^ spriug. We £ j6»nud thp pension; choice in every way, . dMpacially as its accommodations permit t.âedtnp more than two families to consti 4nteii» dwellers: vj When we first arrived a lady-and her ' '.iofy 'who were' tn leave the following .%e*k, «were - id ' the apartinont. José cared to show her pleasure at this, and it was to our comfort decidedly that whee ehe felt in the mood she managed the pension, tho poor frau looked on helpless, She was thoroughly fearful of JoBé. "The boarder, a Mrs. Dunlop, was more social. While at supper one eveniog I was sur- prised to hear from her that the lady whom our fran had expected at ber de- parture was a Mrs. Fit« Allen. " Fitz Allen !" I exclaimed amazed. " Do yon know a Mw. Fitz Allen ?" " I know a lady of that name, but slightly," Mrs. Dunlop laid down her cup. " She was here for a week last ¡ month, and left then tb return how. The j rooms I have are for her." . , MES. FITZ ATAEN DESCRIBED, " Do describe her for me ; it ts possible she is some one I knöw." 'Then aad there I told of seeing my old* friend in Paris, and together we wondered if -this1 Mrs. Fitz Allan "wäre .the same. I had1 talked with high enthusiasm, and Mrs.' Dunlop had a deeptinge of colour iu her cheeks. She was interested. ; "It would be strange if this really was your friend; und-irthrak it must be- for name is uncommon." ;.. " Describe her," Î repeated. < " Yes, describe her," put in Alaine. " WelL Jshè was tall ; rather large.'* : " What colour of hairP" I interrupted. "Hair-hair?" Mrs. Dunlop thought; "black, and eyes, blue." j ' ui ! "'Tisn't the same," said, Alaine posi- tively, continuing her enppqr. ' "Our Mrs. Fitz Allen was short." . .»J. "Not at all," I cried sharply. i'Mrs. Dunlop might call her tali," lily friend, in truth, was short, hut at that moment1 the right impetus was given and tho im- aginative wheel Bet roiling. " And her. eyes blue and her hair black." I wout on enthusiastically. " The road was down hill. Wasn't she distingué ? As a girl she was a great beauty, hut she failed, terribly. X heard she had a great deal of trouble." Mrs. Dunlop's expression had yariod at each word. She was now both em- barrassed and restless. We waited some time for her to speak. j " Yes, I think it's true about her having had trouble," she began.. 4'She, she looks peculiar." Her hesitancy made nie curious, but I kept quiet,-and she had to go*on. " She may have been pretty once; yes/ I think fine looking * bnt/' faMy desperate, " she's etriking--but not jtf%e way yon think.*' C -*TilL-" " You conscientious old sönt-ho w % pity yon î*' % said to myself., i ' ¡ Alaine looked up ai. nar,'.' » " Don't mind telling us if she is a little off. Mamma won't care, it has been so long since she saw her." With a bright f ace Jurs. Dunlop glanced towards me. I looked-encouragingly. ,.* " WeU, ehe . was : decidedly what yon call 'off.' She was crazy, I believe. A lady whom she called her companion was always by her side." "Did she ever speak of having twp daughters P" ' " ab, but one day at dinner there was a young lady with her she mentioned as her daughter. She was fine looking.*' "Washer hair, gold f". "No j black, like Mrs. Fitz AllenV* ; "lt. can't be the same then, for my friend had two. daughters, and one with yellow hair." . We left the room together and sepa- rated at the door. MES.

For hours I had been rèstiiig,-j after an unusually severe attack of neu-J ralgia, endeavouring to cairn my shattered, nerves.

" Mrs. Carmen, I have spoken to Mrs,.; Fitz Allen of you, and Baid that it is p is- j sible that yon were old friends. . She] begs she may see you." "In a moment--ina moment.

Jose* had withdrawn, and from < the next room through the -closed door I heard Alaine reading aloud" faintly. Since the new arrivals I had not seen my child. She was always strictly bidden to keep away while my sufferings lasted, as my temper was usually ailing CB well, so I knew nothing of her impression of Mrs. Fitz Allen. Deciding it would.-do no harm to hear what she thought, Í said loudly, " Al-" At that instant'.there came a knock on my door. - ¿ni j " Herein !"

" If it will help you. certainly I will listen." ~aclasping, her hands she stretched out to me, .then instantly drew it back, aud as the ¿ace fell from hor wrist I could remark on its whiteness and, strength. She told her story. "We lived iu New York city. Our family was myself, Tristrie, and our two daughters. We were deep in fashion's clutches." She dropped her eyes to her hands. "There is nothing, my*J-dear friend, new under tin» sun. I will not linger. Laurens Mautel-myself-was a young follow used to money." "Was your wife's name Tristrie?" I asked; humouring her. THERESA'S DISAPPEARANCE. .i'Hy wife's namo was Tristrie." Steadily she gazed straight at me. "Was Tristrie," she repeated tenderly. Then, like a child heated in play, she threw back her head and raised, her hand to brush away the hair from:1; her fore- head, when I was startled to see the other hand riso and clasp the lifted one;, then both fell into hor lap, the fingers once more clasped.
