' ' * * * Some bank clerks— judging by their conduct at, and opposition to, -the recent meeting of clerical. workers for improved conditions of labour — are a type of larrikin, dressed in the garb of respectability, more dangerous to human happiness and freedom1 than the larrikin of the- 'Burglar Bill' stamp. ?

What a poor, vulgar, hypocritical thing it is, to be sure j Even our churches are oveishadoweoV by the temples of Mammon, and the ' ministers of Christ bow down in the* house of Rimmon. Metal crosses sur^; mount our churches, but the Religion:' of the Cross — ^crucifixion of the dead: past, of the old animal, sensual,' selfish . man ; death to racial pride arid class- jealousy, nationalism, and mammonismjl and into the life of Christ, ' the nevy: man,' the free divine Spirit — is to how?, many still, as of old, ' foolishness.' — ' Rev.

It goes without saying that The Tocsin, being a mere Labour paper, was de nounced for its immorality in alluding to the subject, by several of those tepid hangers-on of Labour who seem to be ill at ease when they are not fouling Labour's, nest. Why don't these people denounce Governor Beauchamp, the dailies, the jvyhole country press, and the clergy Tor doing exactly as The Tocsin did a year ago ?
