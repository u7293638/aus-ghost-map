TALES AND SKETCHES. «a A LEGEND OF BOHEMIA. Bv MONA CAIRD, Author of "The Wings of Azrael," "IB Marriage a Failure?" "Whom Nature Leadetb," to., Ac. [ALL UI0HT8 RESERVED.] lu the middle ages, Bohemia was a wild land of mountains aud forests, where no ono dared to \ enture out of his house or beyond the walls of Ins tonn without carrying arms In the heart of this romantic country, nestled the quiet old town of Eger, the scone of WnllciutcIH'B rclwllion and of Ins treacherous mut dei J lie Egerland is non a «ide stretch of fertilo plain encircled by a hue of blue mountains, a little retired vtorld where even to this day, the custom« of ancestors dating far back into history, continuo to regulate the liv es of the simple inhabitants The lioUBes of the peasant farmers arc all built ou oue immemorial pattern ; their inmates wear the same style of garment« unvarying even to a button, they sleep in gaily punted four post bedsteads, carefully cuttaincd round, and quaff vast potations of beer out of big tin or earthenware flagons. The Egerlaudcrs stand apart from their neighbours as absolutely as if miles of sea girded their little territory instead of a circlet of hills Once inside this line of enchantment, the trav eller buds himself half constrained to take life on nu due val terms, so potent is the old world atmosphere, so strange the charm of the quaint superstitions and child like worship of the people Worn out with the worry and toil of conducting a large business, I found myself, one sunny September, in the heart of this ?[uaint little land, and I blessed, in an illogical ashion,-pardonable in my exhausted state, -the railway which bad enabled me to takes dip into an age when steam-engines were still undreamt of. For seven happy weeks, I was a Bohemian at heart, a devout Catholic, a worshipper of lean saints. Many a day as I caine to a little lonely shrine, by the side of some path across the fields, I his ve gone down on my knees, and worshipped-I knew not what-the sweet virgin in her blue robe edged with gold, holding tile haloed infant in her arms. I came to love that mild-faced lady, and to wish that I could carry her home with me to pray to when the foreign mails came inland-but alas ! my delicate goddess grew pale at that thought, and I remembered that she belonged to the land of Yesterday, and would fade and die if she were transported to the glaring world that Fate had chosen for my dwcUing plaoe. I had one favourite shrine which stood at the foot of a hill crowned by a large church, whose strange Byzantine-looking cupola of zinc or capper painted red, could be seen for miles aeross the plain. My shrine was presided over by a bright blue virgin, whose cerulean eyes had been tinted with the same paint that stained her robe, slightly diluted. On the shrine giateful pilgrims had hung np numerous quaint tbauk-ofierings, for having been preserved from illness or accident At the feet of my Lady of Azure, when I approached on one lovely afternoon, knelt a malden, with head bent in prayer. I had the impulse to go up and kneel beside her. It is impossible to describe the sense of happiness that I felt a« I joined in worship with this beautiful Bohemian girl. It seemed to me that then, if never before or after, my prayer must be granted. My fellow-worshipper was the daughter of one of the wealthy peasant proprietors of the Egerland ; her handsome cloth dress, with its heavy clasps of antique silver-heirlooms centuries old-and the strange head-gear of black stuff revealed her station. She was large of frame, with regular feature«, black eyes, and a fine carriage of the head. How I blessed the perseverance with which I had devoted myself to the Slavonic languages ! It was not difficult to draw the giri into conversation. She was frank and trustful, if a little «hy. This child of the Middle Ages fascinated me as much as did her wild, spell- bound little country. It seemed to me that an old dream of raine was realised and that I had been permitted to step out of my own noisy century, and to meet and speak with the generations of the past. Our shrine, my beautiful companion told me, had been raised on this spot five centuries ago by an ancestor of her own, Baron Zwaptolik, one of the great Bohemian nobles, in thanks- giving for the rescue of his only daughter from the murderous assault of a robber chieftain, whose powerful band was at that time infesting the district. The girl was sitting, rosary in hand, at the foot of the shrine, I had stretched myself by the hedge side, in luxurious case The sun wss hot, the breeze soothing, I sank into a strange lethargic state, as if my body were asleep, while my imagination became abnormally vivid My companion was relating to me the story that had been handed down among the owners of the soil from the troubled times of the thirteenth and fourteenth centenes, but such was not precisely my impression I seemed to be transported back wards across the great plain of time, and gently landed in the midst of a lomance of the Muidlo Ages The scene had scarcely changed , it was still the beautiful Egerland Eger lay at the end of a four mile avenue of stately poplars with ita castle and gabled houses in the distance the church stood abovo me on the hill top, but there was now only a rough track up to the village, and the whole country teemed like a vast forest-it was in fact a part of the great Htrcyuian fotest with a few farms and scattered hamlets, and here and there a church By some magic of place and time, I had become a spectator, though not an actor in the drama. This power of knowing all, without the ability to act made mc feel at times as if I were suffering from a terrible nightmare I do not think that I was able to raise my head or to open my eyes, I seemed to be under a spell Bimilar lo that which the wicked Count in the story held over the beautiful daughter of old Baron Zu nptolik, w hose vast castle used to stand, stn rounded by dense forests, scared} a mile from the shriue Drahomira, dark of hair and swift of foot, with her brilliant brown eyes and rich coin plcxion, was one of the w eaithicst heiresses in the kingdom, and her hand had bien eagerly sought by the BOOB of the neighbouring nobles, not only for her beauty, hut for her richea Among these aspirant« was one who had long loved lier with faithful devotion ni spite of the cold and scornful treatment which either coqiiettry or uv crsion appeared to inspire in her Tlio only consolai ion of the young Count Via hilav was the fuit that Draliomiru behaved to hu nthei suitors lu exactly the sumo manner Sho had no wish to leave the home whcic she was idolised by her indulgent old father who since her mother a death had lavished all Ins affections upon their only child " If I married, it would be all gain foi un lord and all loss for me," she usod to say with her brilliant smile, " I pray you, good knight, pay your court to some unhappy maiden, who, in becoming your wife, may reach something better thuu her present Btalc, since she cannot achieve a worse 1" Vladislav would watch the self willed lady moving among the brilliant company, gracious and smiling, yet ever ready to bold at a distance the most persistent of aspirants This firmness of character made her subsc qucnt conduct appear all the more incomprehensible tonic,an astounded spectator panting to nitci fere and to set crooked things »tittiLjit Tho first hint of tins change of demeanour occurred about the time of a very strange event which created a stir throughout nil Bohemia One of the daughters of a great seigneur had, ou the veiy eve of her wedding, disuppcai ed from her homo, and though search had been made far and wide, tia trace of her could be found The expectant bridegroom had also v amshed I heard the people talking about this incident all aiound me, and ni) blood was chilled w ith a presage of coming evil " A jealous and disappointed suitor must lutte carried bei off," said one. "An enemy of the bridegroom has taken them both awaj, and it keeping them prisoners," another suggested, and so on ran the surmises Drahorñlra, usually so bold and fearless, was white to the tips, and «he started if anyone «poke suddenly to her "Beloved and gracious lady,' said Vladislav, "Fear nothing No evil shall befall you whilst I am by your side Had I but the right to be always your protector what unspeaksblo joy would be,mine," At these words, to everybody's dismay, Drahonitra sw ooned When at last she opened hor eyes, she turned them instinctively toward« the gieat window, and a look of terror carne into them which Btartled everyono I followed her gaze, and saw-yes I am certain that I «aw for less than a second the face of a man with dark lum and eyes, staruig straight into the room Hie next iiiBtsnt the face had gone and only the surging forest was to be seen from the deep set window How I longed to be able to relate what I hod witnessed but I was tongue tied, moving among these knights, and dames, like a ghost, helpless and tiouotioed Drahoinira waa as full of life as usual during tliat ev ening To me hor gaiety peemed wild and fev erisli, but then I knew «Mat no one else knew in that company Vladislav looked gloomy The Baron's daughter avoided him, and he thought that she made herself need lesslv agreeable to a jacknspes in a crimson doublet, who followed her everywhere. To Vladislav s secret joy, the knight had already druuk deep of the wine that was provided for all coiners, in the great hall l\ hilo his rival was thus puttiug ' au enemy into his mouth," Vladislav remained sober and watchful The tipsy knight came s» aggcring into the mi 1st of the ladies, snatched Drahoinira round the waist with a noisy laugh, and proposed a moonlight ramble in the forest Several strong hands were laid ou bis arm and he was led buck to the banqueting hall, where he continued to toast his mistress in the flowing bowl till he rolled off Ins seat, still trolling out Beranades and drinking songs from the safe lev el of the floor Vladislav rejoiced to seo several other knights depart discoinfitted that evening when the hours of revelry at length drew to an end, and tho few gneste who lived near rode away m companies large enough to resist the bands of marauders that haunted these outlying part« of the great Hercymau forest. The rest who were sufficiently sober went off to their rooms in the castle. Vladislav was too perturbed to sleep He Bat looking out upon the moonlit scene thinking of Drahnmira \v hat had caused her sudden terror * Would she ever return his devotion T Holy Virgin ! Had h s thought« fashioned a semblance of her out of the mist« and the dim moonlight' He saw her crossing the open space before the castle, and with her a man in a dark cloak Count Vladislav «wore a great oath, and then lie made off in pnrsuit. He could see the two figures, thoupli not their fores, as they stood together in the forest, but he was careful to conceal himself that he might tint fiivo the manan opportunity to escape He must know which of Drahoinira s suitors had been able to persuade her to this breach of decorum Could it be he of the red doublet » Mad with rage and jealously Vladislav's feelings were not soothed when he saw the man throw ins arms round the girl, and break into a thousand protestations Yet Vladislav dared not approach, Drahomira would neier forgive him if he played tho spy 1 She broke away from her companion ; the lover became contrite, kneeling at her feet. Then hu pleading was recommenced, under which Drahormra seemed to be giving way, though struggling against the man's influence as if in terror She tried several times to escape, but he thrice succeeded in recalling her ' He appeared to have extracted some promise ana then she left him at a ron Vladislav intercepted her as she fled back towards the castle. "Have you been keeping tryst with the Devil, fair lady!' Drahormra gave a scream and sank hack against a tree " I think I have ' she answered wildly " What do you mean T Who is this fellow 1 ' Vladislav demanded In great excitement. " Don't ask nu, I dare not tell you-I must obey him-Vladislav «ave me " Before the astonished lover could reply the girl had fled past him, and he saw her no more that night. Her words thrilled him with hope and fear On the following day the castle was «st in a ferment by the news that another great heiress had disappeared from her home. The event filled everyone, from the Baron to the stable boy, with the utmost consternation Drahomira avoided all attempts on the part of her lover to speak to her about the incident of the previous night, she appeared to have entirely forgotten it and her wild appeal for help Vladislav determined to watch her closely, andinterfereboldly 8houldany more interviews take place in the forest. But he watched in vain, a week passed without anything remarkable happening The advent of ayouug horseman, the son of a Polish noble, and his immediate admission to the castle as guest, had m it nothing noteworthy, for it was the custom for travellers to receive hospitality from the great houses as they passed through this wild and robber ham ted const y Drahomira had often been called upon to welcome euch transient guest«, hut I shall never forget the look on her face when her father presented to her the new opiner Her eyes were full ot terror as *sjtie returned his low solute. Alas ' I alone, impotent ghost, know the cause of that terror She recognised the face that had gazed at her that night through the window 1 Tile Polish Couut mode a long stay, and his attentions to Drahomira were remarked by all, as well as her subdued and norvous manner w henever he was present, "It is lUBuffiraolc that she should be won under our very HOBBS hy a stranger ! said the rivals This fascinating person loft the castle for a few days, on a viait to Egcr During his absence another of tho mysterious elopments occurred The Castle wat m a pillie. 1 This is very strange 1 exclaimed the Count on lusreturn, "m tnifcountry wewould not suffer our daughters to be carried off with out bringing the offenders to a knowledge of out swoid edges We shall be hearing of the diBoppearauoe of our fair hostess next ! Drahomira turned deathly white Large com ponies of armed mon now went forth daily from the castle in scorch of the unknown criminals The Polish Count took the lead BWearing that he would not rest until he had achieved success Old Baron Zwnntolik cvi dently thought him a fine fellow I watchod the three person» in whom my futcrest was concentrated with fevcush anxiety Diabo nura seemed to be in a sort of stupor Her cyos follow ed ev cry i îov cment of the Count, while Vladislav sought in vain to indnce her to trust lum with her secict Whenever be addressed her, tho eyes of the watchful Pole w ould fall upon her and she became confused and silent At the end ot several days the stranger, with profuse thanks for bis hospital reception, announced Ins iutentiou to bring bis visit to a close. I bl cat lied more freely. On the eve of his departure Vladislav, looking out of his window once more, saw to his horror the figure of Drahoinira disappearing into the shadows of the forest. He rushed out, but the night was dark and his footsteps upon a crackling branch warned those whom he sought to plunge out of sight Among the shadows of that forest I alone wit- nessed the strango scene that was taking place Count Kasimir had taken the girl to a lonely spot, and bo was standing before her holding her hand and looking fixedly into her eyes. Her gaza was straight and fascinated. "I have won your love, Drahomira," ho Bald, not ns a question but as an assertion. She bowed hor head. "Ami you will be my bride." Again the bead was bowed. An expression, like that of some wild beast, carno Into the man's face "Our wedding must be soon I" he said, "and secret. On this day a week hence, beloved, you will dock yourself in your Holiest and loveliest array, as beseems a bride of so great u house, and a msid of such surpassing fair- ness-" "Oh I why did I listen to youl" tho girl moaned. The man gave a grin " My beautiful one cannot evade the fond toils of love. On this day, a week hence at an hour after sundown, she will come to her adorer, w ho will await her at the ohurch of the holy Saint Sebastian, and there the good priest will call the blessing of God upon our union " Drahoinira made the feign of the cross and the Pole shrunk back with an evil fiown AB ou the previous occasion, she left lum m great hoste It was in tutu that Vladislav tried to pierce the injstcrj Her Ups were resolutely sealed On the following morning Count Kasimir departed, aud Vladislav bl oat lied again But Drahomira'a mood did not chauge The week burned post and the day arrived which the unknown bridegroom had appointed for the wedding I believed that I moaned made some sort of cry, When I saw Drahoinira begin to attire herself in her richest robes twining diamonds m her hair, and peat Is round her slim throat Her gow n, vv Inch her mother had woin at her wedding was embroidered with gems, and had formed part of the lady's splendid douer Over tins magnificence Drahomira threw a large cloak, and stealing down stairs she fled f-oin her home, hurrying up by the bare steep pathway, towards the church on the hill top The light had almost died w lien she arrived, and tho bride could seo hy the gleam tlnough the windows that candles weie burning on the altar ¡she also notice that, according to the clock on tlie tower, she had come neatly twenty minutes too soon Hod the Holy Virgin taken pity upon her and made the hands to loiter ? Drahomira stole into the church, and saw to ber surprise, two hguris standing before the altar One of these was loutit Kusiimr, und tho other a beautiful girl attired in bridal array, adorned like the daughter of Z*aptolik herself, with costly gems. A thrill of horror ran through her ' Was this another bride of heruiystcnouB bridegroom ' He glanced round, us if expecting some one. Drahomira stoop ing loir, ran swiftly forward and hld herself behind the altar. It was her only chance of escaping detection She thought that he must hear the violent beating of ber heart, as she lay cionching in the shadow within a few feet of him Presently-it could not have beru two minutes after she had found shelter-a side door opened stealthily, aud then the sound of footsteps came ulong the aisle. " Here is the priest who will make us for ever one," whispered the bridegroom. Scarcely had he uttered the words when an awful shriek rung through the church, for suddculy three or four ruffians rushed upon the miserable girl aud struck ber down on the very steps of the altar, in spite of her wild appeal for help to the Virgin and all the blessed sainte, Another stifled shriek echoed it from behind the altar, while the wild work of murder went on under the directions and with the help of Count Kasimir, whose cold- blooded savagery exoeUed even that of his accomplices. Horrible was the scene that followed. Thebeautiful bride lay dead on the floor of the desecrated church, and her robber-bridegroom was gloating over the rich booty. Her jewels were torn from her, aud then the hand of assassins dragged away the body and flung it into a large hole which they had dug in the forest for the reception of their numerous victims. Nearly fainting with terror, Drahomira found herself left alone in the silent church, the candles still burning on the altar, awaiting her own nuptial ceremony. At all hazardt «ne must escape before the return of the robbers and their terrible chief. This then was the secret of the strange dis- appearance that had scared all Bohemia ! Terror-stricken as she waa, Drahomira's heart best high with revengeful passion : if will and courage could avail, this wicked hand should not see the light of morning ! Bracing herself for a great effort she set off on her homeward journey. She glanced st the clock and saw that in five minâtes, the hour of her appointed wedding would have struck. In that time, therefore, her murderer-bridegroom would be there. Drahomira set off at a run. The path ran down the hillside, and unluckily it could be seen from a distance. When about half of the way had been traversed, feeling a horrible sense of paralysed powers, she ven- tured to glance back, and a cry of horror escaped lier, for there was her terrible enemy rushing down the hill after her ! His accursed influence was asserting itself. She clasped her crucifix ; the spell seemed to relax ; then she gathered together all her remaining strength and fled down the bill, stumbling, recovering herself, springing over hollows, darting round corners ; yet, in spite of her wild efforts, the mon was gaining upon her. Horrible and seemingly everlasting were the next five minutes of agony Every breath appeared to tear her to pieces , her heart was ready to burst Oh, that it might indeed burst before she fell into this ruffian's bondi ! Why was there no precipice that she might have thrown herself over it' Wild farewell thoughts flew threw her brain of hei father and of tlie faithful Vladislav, whose love elie had disdained through the fatal influence of this murderous devil who pursued her He had paralysed the emotions of her heart as well as the décimons of her w ilL From what evil witch had he purchased the hateful philtre ' Still the race went an, still the man sloaly gamed upon the exhausted girl At the foot of the lull, which was about a quarter of a mile from the castle stood a hazel bush, and bete lhahomira suddenly sank uponhei knees and offered a passionate prayer to the Virgin Her pursuer gave a shout of triumph, and at the sanio instant, as he strode down the hill, the Madonna, mild and pitying, appeared in a vision to her kneeling worshipper " Holy Mother, have mercy i" The murderer was now almost at the foot of the hill If the Virgin had a mind to mercy, it be hoved her to be swift ' The man, sure of his victim, slackened his pace, and came up at a walk He luil his hand on the rapier that he carried in his belt, looking round cautiously Holv Mother of God, must I die un Bhriven«" " Not so," replied a voice that sounded to her cars like heavenly music It was the voice of Yltdislav ' In an instant tile tcrufied gul had darted to his sido and found that not only hei lover, but her father and a goodlv Company of armed men had come to seek her Theil eudilenly she sw eyed, and the air grew black around her "No, I ¡nil not fuiut,' she said, groping for suppoi t, ' ' there is foul and hideous murder to be av cnged ' A fe w more gasping words from hei lOUBed the little troop to fury Vladislav had already started in pursuit of the fugitive chief, the rest followed: at a wild gallop liai on Zw aptohk and Vladislav, both look ing like men distraught, contended for the honour of killing the murderer " We must tiap the whole hand, ' said the Baron, "and spear them like rata "Or heretics sue,L,ujted one of the caval eade Ihc murderer, whose one hope of salvation lay in the aid of his comrades, bad fled like the wind up the hill, thus disclosing their licudquarteiu to his pursuers He was just in lime to giv o v, arning to the robber band, when the liai on and his followers fell upon them with shouts and ferocious curses, and although tho assassin» mudo a desperate re siBtancc and rent home several of their antagonists sevcialy w ounded, the w hole troop wusoverw helmed and executed without mercy The i agc of the old Huron, us be fought the v illains who had planned such a fate for his daughter, was terrible to witness Vladislav and the chief tain hail a fiel cc hand to hand combat, hi which at luBt the rubber was slain and Vlndislov wounded \\\ hen cvtiy man of the brutal band had been put to the sword seal eli was made for the body of the murdered bride and her numerous fellow victiniB These were all found in the trench w hlch the robbers had dug, and with them tho treasures for which the crimes had been committed All Bohemia rung with the tidings For many months Drahomira lay prostrate after the shock of that night's experience, and her state caused great anxiety. Vladislav came and went incessantly The old Baron had given a willing consent to bis marriage with his daughter should she herself Bo favourable to his wishes. "Oh I Vladislav, had I only listened to you sooner, and to the voice of my heart, all this might never have happened I Then she un folded to him all that had passed, describing her first meeting with the pretended Count in the forest, his flatteries and respectful gal lantry, her admiration of him and desire to {lenctrute the mystery that Burrounded him, us request for another meeting and her fatal consent After that began his power over her, which at last grew BO strong that she became helpless In bia hands, and was farced to obey him, ask what he might. Wheu she saw bun appear as a guest at the castle, she felt terrified, and tried in vain to throw off the spell of his power " And to think that I was hore nil the timo, and could not eave you ! Vladislav exclaimed, de spairingly " Oh ' my darling, I feared to offend you, or I should have dared more when I BOW tiloso strange meetings But I could not bear that you should regard me as an enemy, or a spy Will you let mc stand at your side and shield vou from danger all your life' My love has been laid at your feet for many a day ' ' Drahomiru'bbeautiful eves filled with tears "If you have not lost patience with me, Vladislav ?
