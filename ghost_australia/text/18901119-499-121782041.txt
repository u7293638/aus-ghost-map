Strange to say, Maudo never saw him as he passed by; : ; As Bolf and Nat. walked towards The Outlaw's quarters, thoy saw Eushton going rapidly across to Lobelia. . ?'-?. 'He's up to no good, I'll follow him,' said Nat, and he ran off, with Eolf close at his heels. ; ' , . ; ? 'Stand bock,' said 'Bushton to the crowd. Nat was close on his heels. ? 'Now then, you, brute,' he said to the beautiful mare that had fought so well for him; 'you shan't cause me any moro trouble,' and in his mad rage he drow out his pooket pistol and levelled it at her head, the wistful eyes looking in his demon darkened face. No pity there. Aciack,' and tho mare started violently. Too late Nat Smiley had bit his arm up just in time, and the bullet spedharmlessly away. Eushton turned round with a great oath, and saw his deadly enemy facing him. Thus they met, the seducer and tho betrayed husband. 'You grovelling wretch,' Baid Nat. ''Would you shoot that maro? She's worth a hundred such men as you.' j ' So she is !' cheered the crowd, and thoir angry demeanor boded ill for Busliton. ' 'It's no business of yours,' he hissed. ?'I can do what I like with her. She's mine,' and he raised his pistol again. \ Nat snatched it out of his hand, and said, ' Drop that game. I'll keep this for you. I may want it somo day,' he added, significantly. ? ; Eushton's faco blanched. Could Nat know all. Impossible. The thought, how over, quietened him down. ' Listen to mo, Eushton,' said Eolf. . 'I hear you've been hard hit. I'll give you a monkey, and let off my bets, for the mare. : . 'Your bets,' said Eushton in surprise. I ';Yes. Don't you recollect you gave mo The Outlaw iri ?' Eushton did recollect, and he scowled Trapped again, he thought. 'It's. a bargain,'': he said. , 'Take the. brute.' .;?-'.'?: '?'.;; Lobelia had indeed changedhands for the better,, and again the. crowd cheered. So it happened that the two- gallant steeds that had -raced so well were stable, mates for the future', and no man' felt prouder than Hilton, as ho saw The Outlaw and Lobelia, accompanied by Testator, safply home to their quarters. The Outlaw had borne out Hilton's good opinion of him, and the farmer trainer felt justly proud. Hilton said he had backed ' our horso ' when the money bad been given him in Tattersall's, but by our horse he had meant The Outlaw, and he had had a good win accordingly. What about Blossom Squirm? He had lost heavjly on tho mare, and was con^ sequently in a bad humor. He, however, consoled himself with the thought he had to. meet Nat Smiley, and speculated how much he ? could draw on the ' lucky digger' for the information he had to impart., ... -.; ;,; ? -'. 'Arter all I reckon I'll not make such abad ? deal,' said Blossom, reflectively. 'What's the use o' growling over spilt rum. It's Eushton's money I had. Cuss him, I might a knowed he'd never have th* luck to win. I'll be even with. him. He'll bave to bleed again. If he's got nothing left, he'll darned soon have to find it, or s'help mo I'll (bring Mrs. 'Smiley to lifo again,' and Blossom chuckled at the thought of resurrecting Mrs. Smiley. j At Her Majesty's that night Maudo (Bradley met with. a great reception, and some enthusiast yelled out when the bar barian chief appeared to claim the Queen of Love, 'that's The Outlaw,' and tho roar of Hpplause that . followed this sally, was deafening. Maudo could not forbear smiling. . Showers of bouquets greeted her. It was a night of triumph for her. And as Nat Smiley looked at her in all her beauty he could not help saying, with a sigh, 'it was the bug did it.' '. '.'';':'? ' ??;' (to be continued.) ?
