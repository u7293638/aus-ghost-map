A GHOST.—A certain neighbourhood nut far from Tainworth, was the other evening thrown into a state of commotion and excitement, by the following story, and all " perfectly true." A mouth ago, a poor woman buried he^husbandj who died in the hospital. Inconsolable at her loss, the poor wife obtained a few small splinter bones that came from her husband's leg, and put them in a match bos as precious relics. Alas! in three short weeks the widow felt her loneliness to be more than she could bear, and at once made up her mind to have a second husband, with whom to spend the long winter evenings. It may be that conscience was pricking a little; but, be that as it may, after returning home she beard an unusual sound upon the mantelpiece. Feeling startled she placed her ear close to the match-box, and there were the bones rattling one against the other at an awful rate. Shrieking, and running to tbe door, ehe there beheld the ghost of her departed husbnnd, wbo gave her one upbraiding look, a tremendous box on the ear, and then vanished. ME.
