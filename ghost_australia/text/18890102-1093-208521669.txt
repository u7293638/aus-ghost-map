SELECTED POETRY. FOR THE NEW YEAR. n?REDEBIC E. WEATHRRT.Y.1 I buried the old year sighing, I laid it away with tears; With the pitiful faded blossoms Of the unforgotten years; And I turned to my lonely fireside, For I thought what the New would be, With only the ghosts of gladness To walk through the world with me. I woke when the bells were ringing, Brightly the morning smiled, And there! in the sunny doorway There stood a gold-haired child. And she sang, as afar she pointed. And her eyes to heaven were ca3t, "Be ever the roads so weary, They lead to peace at last!"
