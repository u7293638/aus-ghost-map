It w«8 long put twelve, but the crowd showed no appearance of dimin ishing, and (he iron ? f (.be calico mea sure bad entcrtd iulo his soul. He stood at tlie end of a long coun ter, measured off rrmuauts mid tick cttd them, only locking up to scowl deeply, t hough ' unconsciously, when the sound of, 'Sign, please!' broke ip upon his occupation, or a cnstohiar claimed his attention. Onoe a woman, pretty and poor looking, but very .heat, took the chair before him. There were two' children with her, little rosy things, with clean Taxes and 'patched frocks. They ex amined the calico with deepest interest and fell its quality and asked its pries witb such earnestness tbat a ghost uf a carved line crept round a mouth that bad long since forgotten how to sate fit cut off the length required and wrMBed it up with alirost an angry lighlin his eyes. What ? bright com fortable wife she mutt be. What a mother. . She passed on to tba print oounter with her little one* and the precioni handbag holding the old purse and its hardly-earned contents. Other customers came and he served them in a wooden kind of manner, or else said hard, UDpleaeant thing* that made them hasten away a* soon as possible. Id the lunch hour most of those off work in the shop assembled together in a large store room and lunched in merry style, laughing awl joking with each other till the gong sounded. There was one- packing care well away from all the others tb»t no one dreamed of taking, for It was here in solitary state this one man .ate his lunch, his long legs hanging down the side of the jcase, his bead against a background of green boxes labelled 'Babies' pelisses,' and 'Ladies' coloured skirts.' w ...'

Here tie lit his pipe and walked op Mid down, up and down till it went oat. Then he turned on hi* heel and went back to the shop and the calico. That muoh bis curious fellow assist ants had found oat about his move ments, but nothing else. He came in the morning punctually, be l»ft at night punctually— when be oonlA, — he walked round Lady Macqaarie's Chair at one o'clock. Ue had bread and cheese for his luocb, and his name was John Smith. More than this none of them had been able to find out, though' he bad been among them over five years. He never spoke to anyone unless it was absolutely necessary, and his face al wayB wore the came hard, unreadable expression. A girl at the lace counter who read ' Bluebells ' regularly inclined to believe that he was a duke or a baronet, or at least a colonel, who bad ' done something ' and breu shipped off from England for ' colonial experience.' So someone, read in history, had called him the Han with the Iron Mask ; and the title had been adopted by all. ' Sign please 1 ' He complied for the fiftieth time that day, scrawling a rapid hieroglyphic on the proffered bill, and then bo saw that the clock hand wa? poiuting to six at last. He caught a tram to the far off suburb where lie lived. His home was a little terrace' house in a street off a street A garden the size of a pocket handkerchief was in tin front, and as he waited for the door to be opened, he' noticed bow the rank weeds .were choking the violet* and pannes, just as those of a stronger growth bad choked all the hopes out of bis life. Thnra was no answer to bis- impa tient knocking, so ha to k a step op the dirty verandah, pushed op the front window, and got through. The little sitting, room had a soft carpet, ? picture or. twor*nd some books, but the dBat and dirt lay thick over everything. An old drw* body reposed oni1 chair, aiuittiJred hat ou the centre table, while various gar ments belonging .to children weie scattered about. He went down tlie liny hall. Th- next room- was 'worse— dirty platea; broken haudled cups, and a jug nit h the spont missing . stood on »' table innocent of a cloth of arijjr kind.
