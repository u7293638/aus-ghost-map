mover n spiritua lis m. To the Editor of the Herald, ' bib, — in retorenco to tno article in tuo Berald, lieadod " A Scotchman Among tbe Ghosts," I desire to acquaint you that, if suoh a subject be not uninitible for your oolumus, thero aro many " Aleuiuix.s in and around Melbourne who would readily lurnisli you with accounts of their experience in spiritual manifestations, which happening iu our very midst, would bo for moro interest ing than thoso questionable statements extracted from tho Homo papers. The colonial publio so far as I am aware, aro not rory favourably impressed with tho truthfulness of spiritualism. However, as numorouB oirolos." aro conducting experiments iu this vioiuity with clairvoyant, olairaudient, and writing mediums, who will not long remain r< tioent when an opportunity shall ba afforded them to divulgo tho results, it is to bo hoped that tho publio will shortly bo enabled to exercise their wonder-loving facul ties in test'ng tho cxtont to which spiritualism is worthy of credence, and in deciding whutbor it hs3 any just claims to respect. I ohscrvo that a treatise on this subjoct, from tho pen of Mrs De Morgan, wifo of tho dia:ingniahod professor of mathomatios, issued from tho English press in December laBt, entitled " From Matter to Spirit" (Post 8vo. p.p. 434, 8s 6 i), with a preface by tho professor himself. This bock contains instructions for inquirers, in forming circles and making exporimcnti in table-moving and Bpirit writing ; and, in tho body of the work, Mrs Do Morgan has at tempted explanations of theso seeminsly super natural phenomena, ia the belief that a solu tion of some of tho most important problems in religious and moral knowledgo may bo found by a careful study of these mysterious manifested 'ns. Wheu this publication readies us wo may expect to progress rapidly in tho science of modern spiritualism. — Yours, etc., STRAT0GRAPH03.
