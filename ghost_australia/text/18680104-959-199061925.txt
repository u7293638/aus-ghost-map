The Intercolonial Match: Victoria v. New South Wales. ; On Friday tho gsimo was reanmed by tho Victorians taking the field, Xliompaon and Sheridan acting as avant couriers for the Sydneyites. : The attondanco of tho public : was jncngro indeed, for there could not have boon moro than, 200 or 300 peoplo on the ground, , and even as tho day wore on, tho attendance was not to any oxtent increased. Tho weather was very aultry, and aoon after noon tho elements plainly indicated that a. storm was brewing, thick lowering clouds ; gathering nbout in all directions. Wills placed Conway on to bowl, Kelly being point ; Gibson, wickct-keepor ; Camp bolli longatop'; Bennett, long-leg, changing toinid-offwith .Wardill, who took the posi tion of. longleg whon Allan bowled; Greaves and Cosstick; third man and mid-on alter nately j'Eobortaon, cover- point; Allan, short slip ; Willfli long-slip. From Conway'a first over a wido wns scored; Allan opening with a maiden. Conway, to tho astonishment of those in tho pavilion, bowled' another wido in his second over, thus plainly indicating that ho was not on the spot Fiom Allan's second over, Thompson obtained 4 by a neat cut, and in tho succeeding over of tho same bowler, ho cut him again for a braco, and played his Ia3t ball to mid-wickot for a sinolrt. Knt.tton faced Muster Jack, and got 4 from him Dy Wiu, Vawnnk cut. Sheridan getting a singlo from Allan's next by a dribbling hit ; ho then played a bump-ball of Coiiway'a into the hands of Kelley, but an appeal was answered in tho negative, Allan bowled a maiden, but from Conway's next Sheridan placed the ball nicely in tho slips for 1, Robertson just saving tho 4. Thompson then got Conway to tho on for a couplo ; Allan bowling another maiden, and Thompson spoiling Conway's average by cutting him for a trio ; ho followed tbis'up with a draw from Allan for a pair, drovo him for a single, nnd then hit Conway to log for 4. Allan, who was bowling splendidly, added another maiden, Nat cutting Conway for another 4, getting 1 from an overthrow, and a singlo off Allan by a flukoy hit to log. Wills then deposed Conway, tho captain himself going on to bowl ; his first was a maiden, Allan ditto ; Wills another maiden, ditto Allan again ; hut from Wills's next Thompson obtained n oouplo by a drive, and Sheridan drovo Allan for 3 ; 30 appearing on tho telegraph amidst applause Thompson soon afterwards gavo an easy chnnco off Allan to Campbell, who allowed the ball to slip through his hands. Thompson improved 'his score by cutting Wills for 4, which brought tho score up to 40\. Wills then changed ends with Allan, both bowlers delivering a maiden, but from tho first ball of Wills's next, Sheridan got a pretty ono to leg for a singlo ; and Gibson then made a sharp catch at tho wicket, which disposed of Thompson, who ran up a score of 35 in remarkably quick time, princi pally off Cor. way ; hia play wa8 much ad mired by those present,nudwhen ho roturned to tho pavilion ho received a round o£ ap plauae for his lino display of batting Hewitt, whom many expected to make a stand, did not fulfil tho expectations of his friends, J as nftor scoring a |4, ho fell a. victim to Allan, who nil along had been bowling splendidly, tho batsmen not daring to take tho slightest lihorty with tho South Melbourno colt Two wickets wero lowered for a total of 54, which was exactly tho total of the Vic torians at tho samo stage of their innings. K. Gregory wns Hewitts successor, and Wills almost immediately deprived him of his partner, Sheridan, by| scattering] his stumps with 'oueof hia own.' Catl'yu was noxt RtiOll' fl mitvinnliit.ir flu i it.in1.-nta nnrl Ilia nil. pearance wns the signal for a round of ap plause. The Surrny don took tho remainder of Willa's over w.thout scoring. Gregory cut Allan Cor 1, and from Wills's next ho got a couplo to tho off, and 1 for u hit to log. Allan delivered a maiden, but Gregory got Wilh away to the on for 1, nnd Caflyn hit him to leg for 2. Gregory's bails were nnw whipped off by ono u'f tliu beBt balls doli,voi|jd in the match. Four wiukots for 02. Gordon joined Caftyn, who had been batting very steadily. Wills delivered auoth&r; over with out nny runs being obtained from it, and Gordon played Allan to thu off fur a unit Threo maidens in succession followed, and the luncheon hour havingarrived,an adjourn ment was ms-do to tho pavilion. On resuming, Caffyn played Allan's over without scoring. Tremendous clouds of dust now uwept over tho ground, making it a difficult matter to got a good sight of tho ball, and Gordon was soon easily cuiKjht at point off W ilia. Fivo wickets down fin- 05. Laurence now bcoaroo the companion of hia All-Kuglaml confede rate, nnd received tho last ball of Willa's over. Cuffyii got 1 by a drivo to tho oil from Allan, and us 1 ho imnondiug storm .'YifCttii its career, the cricketers boat a retreat j but as the wind lulled n little, and tho dust disappeared, tho Victorians 'gain took tho field, and operations wero ouco more com menced. CaiVyn got 3 off Wills, Allan bowl » ing a maiden. Laurence got n singlo in the i- mips from Wills's next over, which brought tho acoro up to 70. Throo successivo ?uaidens wero delivered, but Caffyn got 1 i-o leg offWills's next over, and a singlo from ench bowler in tho following over ? Laurence scored 1 to tho off from Allan, Caffyn driving bim for 3; his partner making a brace of Wills ; Caffyn Kottinc a singlo to leg from Wills, and Lau rence 1 to cover. Tho storm now burst forth with all its fury, the wind, which had suddenly veered round to tho southward, blowing with terrific violence, and tho volumes of dust which it brought onward wore ao thick as to completely obscure a aight of tho men in the field.' Some of the Victorians, aeoitiL' tho dust approaching so rapidly, dropped ilat ou tho ground to escape its force, but it could not have availed them much, aa it entirely smothored every thing in tho immediate vicinity. Trees wero uprooted nnd branches broken off in all directions, tho pay-box at tho northern gato was awopt away, with the man, monoy, tickets, and all ; and in tho scr.-.inblo to secure tho cash, tho money-taker lost hia hat, and finding limbs of treca dropping about iu all directions, ho considered discro tion tho hotter part of valour, and boat a hasty retreat to tho pavilion, minus his hat, a number of tickets, and aomo of tho silver. How tho roof of tho grand standstoodao well is something surpriaing, and it speaks well for tho contractor that, beyond a trifling loosening of one or two planks, tho whole structure receivo.d no clftmnrm wliatovnv T lm largo marquee iu tho ladies' division swayed to and and fro with such forco aa to threaten destruction to its occupants, who, liowover, wero safely delivered from their porilous position, ami tho canvas structure brought to tho ground. This was not com pleted a moment too soon, for tho wind blew with redoubled forco, tho dust increasing, and in two or three minutes entirely changed tho complexions of those who wero unfor tunate enough to havo to withstand its fury. As there appeared to bo no probability of a clear up, it was decided that tho match should bo adjourned until tho following day at ton o'clock, at which hour the stumps will bo pitched. At aix o'clock, Bhould the match be unfinished, the stumps will be drawn, and tho gamo resumed on Monday. The third day of the match was a moat fa vourable ono for tho purposes of cricket, and the finenes8 of tho weather induced the ladies to assemble in greater f oreo than on tho pro ceding days, tho general public also attend ing in far larger numbers. His Excellency tho Governor was present during a portion of tho day, nnd watched the game from tho ladies' reserve. Tho state of tho gamo when the stumps were drawn on the previous oven inc had the effect of raising a hopo that our visitors were to be beaten in ono innings, but siioh was not to bo, for tho Now South Welshmen went in determined to avert such an easy defeat, and not only succeeded in their object, but also put 80 on for tho Vic torians to got to win. This state of things wa8 mainly attributable to tho splendid bat ting of Gilbert, Coates, Thompsoni and Gordon, all of whom handled tho willow in fine stylo. For tho Victorians, D. Campbell fielded during tho morning in place of J. Bennett, who was absent iii consequence of having to take part in the Victorian Re gatta j tho ? substitute, liowovor, fielded in grand form, nnd savod soveral 4's at long leg. The play of the day was equal to any thing over Been on tho ground, tho patience and pcrsoveranco of Gilbert and Coatea con trasting favourably with tho brilliancy of hitting and fast run-getting of Thompson, Caffyn, and Gordon. ' Tho bowling of Allan was again beyond all praised Ten o'clock was tho hour agreed upon for play to commence, and soon after that time Laurcnco and Caffyn, tho two not outs of tho previous evening, were ready padded and gloved for tho fray, but two or three of tho Vic torians had not put in an appearance, and the captain would not take the field until. they arrived, which delayed tho commencement of tho play until 10.50, at which hour a begin ning was made by Laurenco batting to tho howling of Allan, whoso second ball ho hit to leg for 3. Four maidens wero then bowled in succession, but from Wills's noxt tho Syd ney captain obtained a couple to leg, which caused 90 to appear on the telegraph board. Laurenco then drovo his rival skipper for a pair, and Caffyn hit Allan to the on for tho same number. Tho first ball of Wills's sue.: ?-~'iinij nver Laurenco cut beautifully, but tho 'little wonder' »u ;.. iu. ..-.«], «u-i returned tho ball in double-quick timn, Charloy, who had started to run, being nearly run out ; ho, howover, got 1 for a similar hit from tho last ball of tho over; Both bbwlors trundled a maiden, after which Laurenco hit Allan back very sharp, hut tb'v colt missed tho ohance, and 2 runs wero ob tained ; it was a very hot one, and had Allan held it, it would havo been a fine catch, but tho South Molbourno man was quickly re-, venged, for, in tho samo over Kelly disposed of tho All-England man by making a. splen- did catch at point, for which ho received en thusiastic applauso from all parts of tho ground ; the score standing nt .98, of, which Laurence had contributed 15 by very noat play. Tho parting of . , tho two. .English players seemed to ueprivo the .Sydneyites of all hopo of Baving defeat in one innings, and offors wero mado to tako 2 to 1 that Victoria won in a sinele innines. Sinclair uow.be camo Caffyn's partner. Willa .bowled a. maiden, and tho young player thcu had to faco Allan, from whom ho mado a single to leg, Caffyn following it;up with.nmngniB.. cent drivo to tho off for 4, which called forth loud cheors. Both bowlors dolivored a maiden, but Sinclair got a single from eitoh in tho two succeeding ovors, and Caffyn drovo Allan straight for a brace, which should havo boon a singlo only, hut Cosstick mulled the ball. After threo moro succes sive maidens, Oaffyn gave n vory difficult ohanco to CoSBtick, but ho could hardly reach it, and a run was made. Tho first ball of Willa's noxt over, however, was fatal to tho Surroy man, for playing it up. Greaves took it at third man, and Caflyn had to retire for 21\. Ho played a vory protty innings, but there was little, of that brilliancy exhibited which of yoro mado him so famous as tho best bat in England. This was no doubt owing to tho want of sufficient praetice. Seven out for 108. p. Gregory took tho vacant wiokot, whoa Sinclair cut Allan for 1. Two maidens wore thon bowled. Sinclair got a braeo to log off Wills, Wardill lidding, the ball in splendid stylo ; ho also got, a singlo to tho on from tho samo bowlor, nud thou Wills mado a beautiful catoh at ; short slip, off Allan, which disposed of Sinclair ; tho hit was a vory sharp, one, but the Vio torian captain was . quito equal to tho i occa sion. Gilbert, 'the ancient,', now mado his debut, aud played tjho romaiuder of the colt's „««.. Ti Cirnnnrv nnnn foil '' IV. vinfcim fcn \Vills, off whom Gibson, mado a .fino oatoh at tho wickot, Nino wickets down for 112. Coatea was tho last man,' and ho ' raised but., little hopes iu the breasts 'of the Now South Wales team.' But the ' disiilay botwoen'. him and Gilbort was really the libst bit of batting exhibited during the innings-7-thbir dofbneo wna perfect ; nnd tho bowling of Wills and Allau was indeod firBt-olass, causing both batsmen to play with oxtromo oaution. ; Two maidens woro bowled, but Gilbort got a sinalo to lee off Allan's next over, another from Wills byja very streaky hit, and l.mord off Allan j a log-byp was run, and Gilbort cut Allan for J, driviug Wills forward also fora singlo j Allan a uiaidon. Coatos placed Wills tolog for ft couple (120 up). Gilbort obtaiuod n single from Allan, and Wills bowled a maiden, after which Coatos mado n singlo off Allan by protty play to leg. Tho bowling was still lirst- rato, but tho batsmen were equal to it, real cricici being played by both aidea. Willa bowled another maiden, nnd Gilbort next got 1 by an overthrow, a log hyo following. Two moro maidona, Coates gotting 1 from Willa by a Cambridge poke, Allan nnolhor maiden, Ilia bowling beingdead on. Gilbort got Wills to covor for a single, and then each batamau received a maiden. Gil bert played Allan iu the slips for a singlo, and mounted Wills for another. Two moro maidens, a leg-byo being run, when Coates, by a nioo drivo off Allan, obtained a Binglo (130 going uji). Tlia left-handed batsman (Coatcs) got another singlo from Wills, and Gilbert followed suit. A ohaugo m tho bowling was now deemed necessary, as, al though very fow runs were- being mado, the batsmen had got set, and a judicious chnngo was tho best policy that could bo adopted. Conway was reinstated, and bowled a maiden ; Coates cut Wills for a double, and a leg-bye waa run in Conway's next, the last ball of which was hit sharply to tho off, but Kelly was again in tho road, and stopped her in his best style. Gilbort mado a Binglo from Wills, Conway bowling another maiden ; Will8 delivering threo in succession ; Gilbert got opposite Gonway again, nnd mado a aincle to tho off, and a leg-byo boing run ho made another singlo from tlio first ball of his next, Coatos scoring 2 by a pretty hit to tho off, and then a single, Gilbert also getting 1, t)ia last ball of Uio over. Another change iu the bowling wns resorted to, Cosstick takiug WHls's place, at tho eastern end, and off his second ball Gilbert got 1, serving Con way in a like manner, nnd spooning Cosatick to short leg for another single. Both bowlers delivered a maiden, and Allan resumed bowl ing at tho western end, and Gilbort got 1 from his third ball, Cossliek bowling a maiden. Coates got a couple from Allan by a very uppish hit, and a leg-byo being run, caused another chango in tho scoring-board, 150 going up amidst tremendous applause. Coates put Cosstiek away beautifully to log for n couplo of doubles, and Gilbert cut Allan for the first 2 in hia innings. Wills rcaumod bowling, and Coates got. n single from the last ball of tho over. Gilbort nil flm time crenting great amusement by his eccentric movements. Threo successivo maidens wero then bowled, Gilbert getting a single from Wills's next, by pretty forward play ; but tho Victorinn colt Bent him ono which ho knew not what to do with, and ho thereforo had to retire, after playing ono of tho beat innings of his lifo, Coate3 carrying but his bat for n splendidly-played ? 18. Both batamen received a hearty cheer upon retiring to tho pavilion. Tho total being but 158 necessitated tho resumption of tho bat by the New South Welshmen, as they wero not within 80 of tho first innings of tho Victorians j and lunch boing quickly got over, Thompson and Coates were sent to do battle for the honour of tho sister colony. Thompson got a Binglo from Allan's second- ball, and another fiom Willa, off whom Coates also obtained a single. Four maidens wero then bowled, but from Allan's succeeding ovor Thompson got 1 to tho off, Wills bowling a maiden. Coates hit tho left-handed bowler to leg for 2, which wao followed by two maidens. - Thompson played WilJs to the on tor a single, ana lrom the next ball Coates was neatly stumped by Gibson. Ono ' wicket for 8 runs. ' Shoridnn noxfc put in an ap. pearanco at ? the ? wickots, . and, hopes wero entertained that ho would make a stand ; but nfter scoring n. single by a cut from Wills, ho was run out in the moat foolish manner, the fault being entirely his own, as there was not tho remotest chance of a run. E. Gregory took hia plaeo, and a'log-byo was run (10 went up). Gregory hit Wills to log for a single,' and Thompson1 out .him beauti fully for 4. Allan bowled a maiden, and Nat hit Wills for 2, the . colt delivering another maiden, Willa doing tho samo ; Gre gory then cut Allan for 1; and 'Thompson made another brilliant hit for 4 (20up). Gro gorygotl off Wills by a poko to leg, arid Thompson drove him for 2, both batsmon get ting a single each from Allan j : both these hits were helped in , grand stylo, tho, oho. by- Robertson, and tho other by Conway. Allan then Bent one in to;.Grogory: which he could not stop. | (Three wiokotsdown for 27.) Caf fyn waa. Gregory's successor, and botwoen him- and Thompson- n grand display, of bat ting euaued,: Thompson,^ by. pretty play under, the leg, got a couple off Wills,' ana hit him. to tho on tho noxt ball, both men atart ing to, run, but thoy returned to thejr re spectivo wickets,, ono narrowly escaping a run out. . . Caffyn made a sinqlo from Wills, and Allan bowled him a maiden, tho young ster quite sticking him up by the precision of his pitch, the hall also breaking consider ably. Thompson made n fine drive off Wills for 4, and', played' him to the off for 1; . ho then by fine forward play got 1 to mid wickot off.AUnn. : Conway .wax tried -again, - this time at Wills's end. Thompson, cut .Allan for 0, and then (li'ovo him for 4, ono of whioh was obtained by an overthrow, 40 having been beon placed on tho telegraph in the . meantime.- — Onnrvn-'otit Cuuwny mooly for 4, Thompson' hitting Allan to tho on' for, a singlo, he also playing Con way to leg for 2 ,(50 up), nnd lpud ohoors, followed the intima tion. Nat hit Conway to leg for 2, Wardill saving; tho.4'in- splendid style. Caffyn fol lowed with a.drivo for 1 ou- Allan, Thomp son following his oxamplo bvliitting tho same bowler to tho off for 1, tho latter also getting n couple to leg from Conway, whom Iiq nftor -vards slippeu for 3 (CO up), Allan nnother maiden to Caffyn, Thompson hitting Conwny to the off for 3, nnd Caffyn potting 4 by n sniok off tho samo bowler, also' driving him to tho off for n single. Cosatick- now relieved Allan, and Caffyn got 1 off his .second ball (70 up). ' Wills' wont on again at his own -end, both batsmen sooring a single, from his first ovor. Caffyn got 2. from Cosstick's bowling, Thompson hitting Wills to leg for 4, and also playing him' to the on for 1 (80 up, and more cheering). Two maidens fol lowed, and thon Thompson got a pair to leg from' Cosstick, Caffyn sotting a singlo for, a similar hii off Wills j he thon played Sam neatly to tho off for a single, nnd sent Wills to1 leg for a quartette. .Threo successive maidens wcrb bowled, when a slight adjourn ment for refreshment took place. Oh resum ing,. Thompson cut Wills in lino stylo for 4, and Caffyn made a splendid off hit from Cosstick for another (00 up just previously). ?A consultation' between Wills, Wardill, aud ltobortson ' resulted inn chnngo of bowling, tho Victorian captain going . on with ' tno slows, from the;; first ? of which; Thompson obtained a single. 'Allan ..resumed offensivo operations at tho other end, and' bowled n maiden. Caffyn got a 4' off tho slows, and 100 went up, followed by loud oheers. Cnffyn then got a singlo, and Thompson faced Wills, whu at last dissolved tho partnership he had been BoloiiRamlanxiouslyondoavouring to dis solve] 'NatTiittiug'oiio into tho' hands of Bon n'ett at mid-off. 'Four wiekot^down for 103, Thompson1 liaviag contributed (10 of tho number by as lino batting as over was wit nessed on nny ground, nnd for which ho ro ceivod a tremendous burst of applmiso as ho approached tho; pavilion/.' Gilbert, then bo-, came Caffyn's partner, arid played tho slows rathor quoerly. Caffyn drovo Allan to tho on for 1, rind thoslows also for a similar number, Gibort getting 1 from Wills, wlnoh ^Oaffyn followed up with a hit for 3 from tho' same,, bowler. Allan bowled a maiden. Gilbert scored n.siuglo by a very plucky hit1 off tho slows, whioh uoiit 110 up, after whioh Allan bowled1 another' mnidon. Caffyn then drove the slows for a single, hut off' Allan's noxt ovor ho i was magnificently caught by Kelly at point, tho fiuo display of fiuldimj being rewarded with a tromundous chcor all round tho ground, and woll was it moritod,' fora finer oatoh was never- made. Tho ball was cut with terrifio forco in Caffyn's best style, 'and nobody appeared moro astonished than tho batsman ; himself when bo saw- tho hall token with such lightning-liko rapidity by' his old- pupil; ? Caffyn played in excel-; 'lent fornij bis : hitting and stylo, boing 'much' Ripbrior.to his first ossay; andit was indeed lucky' that Kolly made, .so brilliant a catch, , for Caffyn was woll sot, and bogiuning to hit iu; something lik'o; his old form. Hewitt took ..Caffyn's... placo, and -whan'- 'another singlo had- been added to tho' scoro, Gilbort was smartly run out. Seven, for, 112. Lnwronoo oamo nnd wont nfter scoring a single, but Gordon batted ex collonUy, and ho.and Howitt soon rose tho score to 120, soon after which Gordon hit tho slows for 4, aud stolo a single from tho fast bowling, Howitt doing likowiso. VVilla then ohanged his slawa to fast, How itt and Gordon both gotting singles from tho first tfver. Howitt drovo Allan for 3 (130 up), nnd sent Wills away for 4, but ho was imme diately nftowards bowled by tho Victorian captain (eight for 130). Sinclair joined Gordon, who playod Allan to tho on for a singlo, nud skied Willa for anothor. Sinclair opened the ball with a cut for .3, from WillB (140 going up). Both batsmen mado singles off Wills, and Sinclair hit Allan for 2, 2 moro being obtained for an overthrow. Sinclair scored a singlo to the off from Allan, and another by a straight drivo from Wills, who was also driven by Gordon for 4; 150 up, and great applause. Gordon then hit Wills to leg for 4, 9 runs having been got off tho over; and Wills thought a change to the alows once moro would prove effective. Two maidens followed, whon Gordon, hit tho slows to lee for a duo, and tho next ball skied ono right into tho hands of Wardill at long-log, but tho chanco was not aocopted, and tho batsman went on rejoicing, 2 rUnst being got instead of a wicket lost. Allan bowled a maiden, nnd Sinclair drove tho slows to the off for a pair ; tho next ball, however, was fatal to him, for GreaveB, who was standing close in ou the ou aide, mado a beautiful ono-hnnded catch, which sottlod Sinclair. D. Gregory brought up tho rear, and narrowly escaped being stumped tho very first ball. Gordon stole 1 from Allun, and thon scored 1 from tho slows, off which Gregory also mado 1 by a skier to mid-on, nnd another by a flukoy hit to leg ; Gordon hitting Allan to the ou for a single, and Bending Wills to leg for another (170 up). Gordon then made a fino hit off Allan, but in attempting a third run, his partner not being of tho same mind, he turned to get back to his wicket, but Robertson fielded tho ball in fine style, and returning it to Gibson Hko lightning, Gordon wast run. out, after playing iv very fino inninga indeed. i - Piny, was resumed at two o'clock on; Mon day, tho Victorian captain sending in Gibson and Wardill to try and wipe off the runs to gain a victory. D. Gregory commenced the bowling with a maiden to Wardill. Coates,1 the left-handed howler, took tho ball' at the other end, and from tho third Gibson got a single to leg, Wardill also scoring '. 1 off tho last ball. D. Gregory .bowled a wido in his noxt over, but from Coates's succeeding, over Sinclair mado a beautiful catch at mid-off, which settled Gibson, tho .disposal, of so dangerous a bat boing hailed with great satis faction by the Sydney men, (Ono . wicket down for 3 runs.) Conway joined Wardill, who hit Gregory for 2, Coatea following .with n maiden, Gregory doing likewise. ? Conway hit Coatcs to leg for 2, and Wardill mado a fino straight drive from Gregory for 4 (10 up); He next cut, the samo bowlor for ; a double, and Conway i skied Coatea for a single,: the ball going .off tho edge of tho bat. . Wardill put him, awny to leg for a brace, nnd in his next over drove him for 3,' Gregory bowl ing a maiden in tho meantime. Wardill played tho -last-named .bowlor, :vcry sharply into the slips, but Thompson fielded the bull in excellent atyle with one hand. ; Conway got Coates to . leg for 2, thon drovo him to tho off for another doublo, and .supple mentad it with a single. Gregory was. de- posed by Thompson, who .wont. on bowling at the ..eastern ' end, and \ Conway Boon ?cored off him';by sending him to';l(jg for a C air. 'Laurence reliovod ,Codtcs; with fast owlingj a maiden boinjj the result, but- a, leg-bye was run; and Wnrdill then made n sp'londid drivo nil nlong the ground from Thompson',:, for, ! which 4 wero obtajned (30 up), and the backers of Victoria quito jubi lant. ' Two' runs wore next got from/a, log byo, and Cbiiway puf Laurenco to leg for a single,' nlsp hitting Thompson to the same place for' a 2 nnd a single, Sinclair fielding splendidly: at long- leg. Laurence ohanged to tho' slows, and Conway got 1. from the first , ball, jWardill making a fino hit to log for'. $. which, caused, 40 to bo placed on . tho ' telegraph board. Conway. then hit Thompson to leg, for n ,4, and al, and Wardill mado a magnificent square-: leg, hit from the same bowlor for .4, 0 runs having been got ; from this over, nnd 50 going up in- tho interim. Conway. . got 3 .by another log: hifc off the slows. ,. E. Gregory took the ball from Thompson, arid Laurenco ., kept, wicket. From Gregory's second ball, Conway mado a , fine, hit to leg,, but Sinclair ran liko a deer and just succeeded in'roaching it bofore ;it .'touched, the ground. , , ,It,was_ really u beautiful catch, . and moro than deserved tho loud. cheors: which rewarded the. fieldsman. for. -his,, suc 'ces3.':(C6nway batted in a,'fino*freo stylo, and gave n'mnlo proof of hia' batting proficiency. (Two (wickets down for 55 runs).... Kolly next mado his appearanco, .nnd' Thompson tried his hand at the western '.end, delivering a maiden. ..Wardill played' Gregory; to the on for 1,, when a shower.-, came on, the players adjourning to the pavilion until it passed over. On resnming, ; Wnrdill put Thompson in tho slips for 1, nnd hit. Gregory to leg for 4, and then out him for a Biugle. Thompson bowled a maiden, but 3 byes woro obtained, through Gilbert lotting her pass him. . Kelly 'got 1 to leg, nnd Wardill drovo Thompson to the on for 2 (60 had just gono U|), and offers woro mado to lay 100 to 1 on Victoria), Wardill then got n little ono from Gregory, Kelly anothor by an- over throw, tno latter spooning Thompson to short-leg,' but there was nobody near to take it; 'Wardill got Gregory to tho on for 1, and Kelly immediately afterwards hit his wicket. Robertson took his placo,] and com menced in: his usual commanding style. Thompson then howled n mnidon to War dilli who all along had beon battinc in tho most brilliant fashion, and not giving tho ghost of n chance. Kobertson snicked Gre gory for 1, and a byo wns run. Threo maidens were bowled, hi tho last of whioh Wardill. hnd a narrow escapo of* being stumped. t Robertson then hit Gregory in nont stylo to the ? off for 1, Wardill cutting him tor 3, and' ho soon afterwards got 4. by aii overthrow, which raised the total to tho required number to win, loud cheera follow ing tho announcement of a victory for Vic toria. ' .'?'??'.- ? :- ..?..? ' ?';. : And thuB; ended tho Intercolonial AIntch of 1807, which, aa a display, of real cricket, has never been equalled ou the Melbourno ground. Thp bntting aud folding of our op ponents cduld'scarcoly bo surpassed, butthoy were weak! in tho bowling, and to tho. lost- named causa their defeat ia mainly attribut able, for had they had a bowler of tho calibre, of Allan, .wo should never havo scored 'buoIi an easy victory. Tho batting of Thompson, on tho part of Now South . Wales, was in deed a treat to witness ; his Holding, too, wns equal to'any on oar side, nnd by his general play ho proved that as an all-round cricketer, ho is second to noiio hi cither team.. .Sinclair's fielding at long-log was. also very fine, and could not bo surpassed; whilo Caffyn and Gilbort porformed in n stylo which plainly indicated that thoy still possessed somo of tho ability of yoro. Gor don, although not a vory pretty bat, showed a good defenco, and' hit in fine form ; ? ? Lau-. roiico. and -Hewitt bolh'performing in good stylo also. Coates w a sweet pretty bat, his steady -ploy with Gilbort in tho first in nirigS'gainiug him no ond of admirers. Of 'our own sido wo must also ' speak iu praise worthy terms, for thoro was not a man in tho eleven- who did not ; exert, himself to the utmost to win tho mateh. To the colt, Allan, especial praise is duo for his grand dis play of bowling, and to: this : the :Now South Wales men consider that they owo their, defeat. Mr, Noal, the/ um- pire for New South Walos, said that ho never 'saw such bowling in his lifo, for, observed he, nearly every ball was dead On to tho wicket, and as thero was agreot deal of .'work' in it, the Sydney inon could do nothing with.it. Whon it is remembored that this colt bowled nearly through thu entire match, it will bo readily admitted that his performance .with the leather has never' been surpassed, if equalled (remembering tho batsmon he had to oontoud against), iuthis colony.' Tho fol lowing is his Analysis ??— Ho bowled '414 balls, for 102 runs, 53 maiden's, nnd 8 wickets, from which it will be seen thnt, leaving out tho fractional parts,' only 1 tun per ovorwns obtained from liis bowling; and wo repc.it that such ' a performance, and against such batsmon, 1b_ without a panllol in tho annuls of colonial criokot. Wardill's bat ting in bath inniugs speaks for itself; his second innings being quito equal to his first as regards brilliant hitting nnd defenco. Robortaon also shone on a star of grca'tiustrc, nnd by bis oosy bock play gamod a host 'of ndmirors. Tho bntting of himself nnd War dill, . Thompson and Cnffyn, nnd C'oates and Gilbert wero cricketing treats of tho highest order, and will bo long remembered by thoso who witnessed them. Tho fielding of Kelly at point, tho steady batting and wicket keeping of Gibson, and also the bntting of Wills in tho first and Conway in the second innings wore all worthy of honourable men tion, while tho long-stopping of Willio Camp bell waa perfect, only two byes being obtained during tho match, aud thcae by no fault of the longatop's. And what shall wo say of tho generalship of Wills, who1 has never lost an Intercolonial Match during his captain ship, if wo except tho timo of the ''barney ?' We can only say of his captainship that it 1 was equal to former years, and the judicious manner in which ho worked his team was tho theme of admiration. Tho match was conducted throughout with the greatest good fellowship and gentlemanly feeling, and we can safely assert that thero has never been a match played with moro fairness than tho Intercolonial Match of 18G7, which passed off without the slighteat hitch occurring to mar tho harmony of the proceedings. After the conclusion of the match, Mr. T. F.. Ha- milton, , the, president of tho M.O.C., pre sented bats to Messrs. Wardill, Robertson, and Thompson, for their, admirable batting ; to Mr. Wardill ho also presented a silver cup, which had been given by a inomber of; tho M.C.C. to the highest scorer. To Mr. Allan tho president presented1 a ball ? for. his fino bowling,;nnd anothor to Mr.: Wills, who was received with groat demonstrations of ap plauso when ho came- forward to accept the present. Threo, cheors wero . proposed, - and . most lustily responded to, for the New. South Welshmen, to which .Laurenco returned thanks in becoming terms, and asked for a .return of tho compliment for the Victorians, tho Sydney team ch coring. loudly in response; to the call of their captain. \ Tho following is the full scoro of tho match :: — : , , ? : -' : ''.:??...'?? -. : -VICTOniA. ?.'? .
