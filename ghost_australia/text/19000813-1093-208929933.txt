THE SIN OF COflSSIOX. It isn't the thing you <lo, dear, It's .the thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of heartachc ' At the setting of the sun; The tender word forgotten, The- letter you did not write, The flowere you might have sent, dear, . Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Ou't of your brother's way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time or thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, Those chances to be angels, Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each mild, reproachful" wraith, Where lrope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all 'too droit, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the" tiling you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache At clie setting of the sun.
