The following is tihe translation of the message :— The Irtsb Race Convention bege to rcspress its pmfouud gratitude to the Holy Fatter for his most kind and salutary message, which oM the delegates receive as a signal favour, and as ilie happiest augrary of peace. Rev. Dr. Ryan, of Toronto, the appointed representative of fhis Grace tbe A j'ah bishop of Toronto, read a letter conveying his Grace's fegrcte for lite enforced absence from the Convention, of which he may claim to be the parent. "The Convention is now' a great and memoraMe fact," wrote the Archbishop.

" They have ooahe back," rang out.a voice from the assfembiy, which oheered again and again >«he ptesence of " Ah© packed delegaites from every iaakl of tk Irish disper^oni." The wretdhed dissensions that led to the suraMtaonfaig of iihe Conventioai needed no reference 1 . But there weri& other reasons for Ms assembling. The put*- licartion of the report of the Financial Relations Commission—not merely "the marvellously reasooed conclusions of one who beyond everybody else, and above all else -on that <^xm>missk>n, represented the cause, ctf IreJand," but the confessions of tlhe jealous experts of the British Treasury show that Ireland is overtaxed, to the extent of two and a half millions. " Tha/t is the rule of the stm'hger for you," said his lordship, vehemSmtty. . Had we a united Irfefh Party, tfce leading statesmen of boMi Englisih parties would •find in tflxis.

The de?egaites were not, howler, fools ; they did mot «ipecttihe Oonveaatioa to succeed completely ; bat -it would raffloe if they «onld go back and tell their people that the foundations were laid for the future. Dr. Ryan was followed by Mr. Justin M'Oarthy, who, though manifestly not strong, had come (bo prove his loyalty to Ms party and its cause. . Mr. M'Oanthiy was rewardtld 'by a warm and affectionate greeting. He, explained why the mapority of the Party had) taken upom themselves to summon the Convention. Iftey 'had done so because they W-ere majority of Party toad taken upon to hold out the "hand of fellowship to other Irishmen. They invited them to come in and work upon the old lines laid on the old principle. Until the principle of control by the majority . was recognised, he would be & sanguine mam who could pay he saw a chance of near success for the Irish Nationalist" cause. Then came the representative of Victoria, Mr. Thomas- Hunt,' a Tipper&ry; man, \tfho left Ireland as a MitotSe boy in »S8, arid who 'had found fortune in hospitable AuatraHa. • laie message foe bore was, he said, " a message of peace and aii appeal for unity." He was a friend of the rights- of minorities, aad would be generous to those In a minority, but -the majority! should be aUe to make their views prevail. Unity must be their waibdhword, and Home Rule must follow. THE VOICE. OF BOSTON was nest :heard through- Fr. O'Oallag- Sbian, He bore a message from the Archbishop of Boston, the venerable Dr. Wiliiaras:—'Go, in God's name," Said the venerable prelate, " and if you can sayaword for unity among Irishmen yon will have done one mam's part in Irish affairs." He wanted to see the old days restored, when, as John Boyle O'EWiffly once said, "It was a glory to Jt*e an Irishman," and when the taunt couldnot be flung at Irishmen that they could not keep , united. The jieads of the Irishmen of New England •were still warm for Ireland, and if union prevailed ffiiejy would rallxjtoumd •the Irish flag as to the brave days of «old; Uifty ivas afeo the burthen of Mr. Moses Cornwall's declaration- THE DELEGATE FROM KIMBKRLEY, *tvho to a qu<iet, prircfctciaJ, but most •effieeivie "and eaifieet speech wascned Trtahmem of the effects of disgraceful ^vMotts^pom^their earase.

They had been described as "nobodies, presenftiimg ©©body,", he said, dealing with a chajiawteriisttc but more than usually indisoreelt attack of the factianast press. But if they were nobodies, wfcetre were honest men to be found ? He was elected by the Irishmen of the Niagara Peninsula, and came from the banks of «xe Wellamd Gamal, whose banks were honeycombed with tlie gravels of Irishmen. They dame wistih a kindly feeling to ail Irishmen, Mr. Redmond included. They came not as diotators, but "as respectable beggais asking dn the name otf Gtod to close your ranks." But they were f(ntitled to courteous treatment, and if amy secition described them as nobodies they flung the Me back. That pJaifcfborm. showed how Canadian Irishmen could bury their differences for the sake of Ireland. Tlhe past leader of the liberal Partfr, Mr. Blake, and a leader of the Conservative Party, "Honest John CJosttgan," who bad fought face to face for thirty years, showetcL how they could stamd shoulder to shoulder when Ireland's cafuse was at stake. Could not Irishmen; at home<rmitgit£ them ? He had been told m ^e^gttfcr pf Ireland, but, said Dr. .Sfeffasf^^^ords fchait bnought ttoe vfhpi® Gont^iin to its feet, "So help ^TGo^iso fea^ is there are three Iriisil^'^ - ^ despair of Ira Manchester, spalgsf latum larger never of and Limerick.

NH^^s^e-the division in the people's Tiaml^^lide^kired, for if the people were urai(6^7"*they could compel unity among tfoeir representatives ia tw&uty-four; hours, " Close up your ranks," said Fr. Lynch, "and we'll poll our last vote, spend our last shilling, and fight your battle to the last ditch." Mr. Dunievy, of Pihiladelphia, speoiking for the organisation that had senit every penny that had rea<ihed Ireland from that city for political purposes during the last sixteen years, joined to the chorus -of appeal. The divisions in Ireland had spread to America, he said, but time has healed them there. He had received A GODSPEED FROM THE PARNELLITES of "Philadelphia, and could speak as the representative of all sections. Dr. Foley, of HaMfax-^m eloquent young priest, with all has life before him, but as full of fervour for the Irish cause as the oldest veteran in the hall—hoped that day would be the starting point of a iwivifled Irish Nationality. They came not to inspect or criticise the past, or say one wtord against any Irishman who stood for the flame of the old land .in days gone by, but they came from' a land where the rule of the, majority prevails, and any ieade)r who obtained! even a majority of one would have' their support. He concluded am eloquent speech by appealing to Irishmen at home not to make theirl countrymen hang their haads for shaime! alt the mention of Ireland's: name by reason of Irish dissension, Sfr. Kennedy, of Wellington, New Zealand, spoke for the Irishmen of - New Zealand, who are only a seveatth of the population, and know wfaat it is; to be in a minority. " New Zealand! was the land of experimental legislaifcion," he said, " but they had so far discovered mo other means of ruling than the rule of the majority." . Fr. Marshall, of Nelw Hampshire, was of opinion, despite his respect for all the men engaged in Irish poMMcs, that "we have need of a tyrant." it Is of 00 importance who leads, provided he leads with a strong hand. Fr. Clarncy, of Newfoundland, appeale& to Irishmen to make ttaelr rallying cry " Liberty for Ireland." Fr. Phillips, of Scramton, Pennsylvania', came NOT TO MAKE SPEECHES! BUT TO .00 T SOMETHING. He -was >nofc born in Ireland ; was no fault of his. His parents Irish,, and fliejcame as <tihe tive of ten thousand Irish-, of the jtiKAeht Order of 'Hlbeijniaiis, Tbe ambWom of leadeii^hlp shoold: iff' he said, staM in the way of ttoe tiiM' of the people.
