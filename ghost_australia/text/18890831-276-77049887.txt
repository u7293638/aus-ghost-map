STPBBBi Xflftfc alona with my conscience, In a place where time had oeaaed, And we talked ot my former living In llie land where the years increased. And I felt I should havo to answer The question it put to me, And to lace tha answer and question Throughout an eternity, Tha ghosts of forgotten aotiona Game floating before my sight, ? And things that I thought were ao&d; things Wera alive with a terrible might, And the vision o! all my paat life Was an awful thing to faoe,_ Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silont plane, And I thought oÂ£ a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking . Of the judgment day to bo, But sitting alone with my oonscionoa Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave 5 But no one gave me an answer, ' And no one o.ime to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past life - Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, ' . And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Had a warning of yesterday And I pray I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not ory in the future And no one come to eavo. And so I have learned a lesson Which I ought to have hnown bc-foro, And which, though I learned in dreaming) I hope to forgot no more. i So I Bit alone with my conscience, In the pis oo where the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, ; That to sit alone with my conscience Will he judgment enough for me,
