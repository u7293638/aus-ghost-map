THE HERBERT RIVER. (FltOVt A COlir.l-srONDFNT.) Is Jottings by a letter" in the Sind Â¡ey | Mail of 6th of Tilly last, there appeals a pal a graph commencing thus -' There is a wild white man on the Herbert River, somewhere in the Northern districts of Queensland above Cleveland Bay " It is not my intention to carry with this statement as regards the existence of the " wild white man "-on this point suffice it to say, that we (who are within a few miles of the locality in question, and which is well known to us) have never come across any " wild white man," or traces of his existence and therefore consider Dan Do'oo's ghost would not profit much by reappearing 'The Herbert River cer lately is somewheiemNorthorn Queensland, but i as this is a very vague definition of its actual position, I have thought a few remarks as to its ' I whereabouts, and the general character of the country along its banks, will not prove unacceptable to your readers First of all, then, this nvorompties itself into the Hinchinbrook channel, about four or five miles from the southern end of the island of Hinchinbrook, and about twenty miles to the southward of the township of Caldwell It is a bar river, but beautifully sheltered by the above named island, under which there is deep an shortage On the banks of the river, for the first four miles, is low swampy country, with mangroves to the water's edge , after which the river becomes more defined, with open country upon either backs well adapted for the culture of sugar cane and upon the right bank of this river, some five thousand acres (or this purpose have already been taken up These selections consist of portions of extensive plains, reach ing from the shores of Halifax Bay on the south, to the base of the Sea View or Main Range some fifteen or twenty miles to the westward This country is some of the richest that can be found in Queensland, and although in parts swamp), can be more easily reclaimed by drainage, and at less expense than at the lands could be cleared in more southern localities from the top of Mount Cathoima, an isolated hill upon the eastern verge of these plains you obtain uninterupted view of the whole of this splendid district Portions of the selections made have been taken up under the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868, partly under the coffee and sugar regulations and partly under the conditional pin clause and homestead clauses, and as a matter of course hates nor frontage, but this would not debar selectors from taking up equally good land in the roar, as even the b 10s portions uiepionouncod by good authorities to be, if drained superior muchness to the river frontage, always remembering that the land is without a tree and ready for the plough Upon the left banks of the river also no open plains, not so extensive, but stretching as far as the banks of another river called the So) mour, running parallel to the Herbert and emptying itself also into Hinchinbrook Chann 1, some four or five miles to the northward The navigation of the Herbert is not particularly good, owing to the washing away of Us banks in times of flood, thereby causing a deposit in the bed of the stream Noth withstanding this draw back, it is altta) s navigable for punts and Hut bottomed boats, such as would be required for conveyance of machinery or in bringing down produce Our acting Crown Lands Commissioner, Mr B or Sheridan, who has lately been on a tour for the classification of the lands already) taken upon the Herbert, and with whom I have conversed, reports most favorably the country, and says that he has not soon any place in Queensland more suited for the cultivation of sugar in his opinion, coming as it does from a gentleman who held until later) the position of lands Commissioner for the Wide Bay and Burnett district, also a sugar growing locality must be deemed worthy of some consideration 'HUB district generally), from what I have seen and gathered from reliable sources is one in which capital could be invested to the greatest advantage, and the easy access to its magnificent harbor would at all times facilitate the operations of the future settler
