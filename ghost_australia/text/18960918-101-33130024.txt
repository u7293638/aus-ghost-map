JL GHOST STOEY. " Talking of ghosts," said a traveller, " I had an experience once that nearly turned my hair grey., 1 arrived late at night in a - little town out west where the only hotel was one of these amateur gimcrack places with Vorsted mottoes on the walls and plants in the windows. The landlord him- self lighted me to my room and saw that I was made comfortable. I was dead tired and sleepy, and dropped off the moment my head touched the clean, laoe-bordered pillows. I was awakened, some time toward morning, from a sound sleep very suddenly, by a strange grating noise, and by the aim light I saw a man rise through the floor of the room. At first I thought he had come to murder mo, but the longer I looked the \ more certain I became that he was no mortal man. I lay shaking until daylight ' with my head buried in the bedclothes. "And then?" " Thon I saw my own clothes neatly sur- mounted by my hat disposed on the frame of a dumb waiter, where I had placed them when retiring. The landlord had hauled them down, brushed them carefully, and sent them up again, giving me a fright that nearly turned miy brain."
