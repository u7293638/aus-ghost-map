' . ? . . . The Ghost in our Midst. GOD forbid that I should, for the sake of sensa tionalism, sound any false alarm, or do anything calculated to create a panic in Brisbane. But I cannot close my eyes to facts. Death, in the hideous forms of smallpox and typhoid fever, is in our very midst. Professional jealousy and want of proper health regulations-or, rather, ignorance as to how to carry out those regula tions-and ve&ted; interests, are all enlisted muter the banner of the grim, destroyer. Let me place facts before my readers, so that they may see jbhat this is no exaggerated' strain, but merelytherecord of pass ing events. A vessel -lies in the Bay loaded, with immigrants. The Doctor of that vessel is confined to his bunk with smallpox. Of the passengers brought from England by this vessel, some hundreds have been landed at Northern ports, fcnd allowed . to scatter £h|»ix£selves over the country and mingle freely with it& inhabi tants. As yet, only one other case of smallpox has been reported, but possibly-hay,probably^ thegerms of the disease have been carried farand wide throughout the colony. . ; On this state of things, I will , here make no com ment. I shall content myse)f .witjh ^skingwho is to blame, and with requestiiig the Government to see that the responsibility is attached to the proper per son or persons. Again. At the time of writing this article, the wife of the wardsman at the lm migration Depot in Brisbane, is on her bed, stricken with' 1 ' Typhoid Fever. *7, ". . ?! For a month past she has been suffering frqm this fell disease^ and the authorities only' moved. in the matter at that period of her illness when heir medical attendant, Dr. Marks, declared that die could only be removed at the sacrifice of her-life: Thus, her quarters remain within the walls of the Depot, c.i" ,f ?*>'". rjy^v tih.,/ = where immigrants haveb^ttgoing and comingall the time. ^ !
