'A villainous looking place 1 ' I Bold to myeclf an I turned to rctraco my steps ; but, before I had gone-many yards, I found my self confronted by two dark figures. 'Cut you give, me a light, 'sir?' came from one of them, but I was on my guard, and ready for the rash which followed before I could reply. One of the men I avoided al together, and dealt fho other a blow in the chest which staggered him. 'Oh I that'* yonr sort, is it?' bo cried ?avaftdy, as he recorercd himself. 'Come on. Bob, and we'll settle his hash for him 1' I cant a rapid glanco around ; not a soul was in sight but my two antagonists — both men of nearly my own nise— and, after a rapid interchange of blows, I received a stroke on tho head which staggered me; but, just oh tho fellows wcro 'dosing up, a cradling blow sent one of them to the ground like a clod. Tho other immediately took to bin heels ; and, turning round, X saw basJdc ma ft powerfully built man of middle size, witb bowed legs and disproportionately' long Arms. 'Thank you, my friend/' I said, f That wm a timely, blow. Will you help mo to give this fellow in charge ?' ' No, sir— no,' was the unexpected reply. ' If I havo doneyou any sorviCo, I ask yon to requite it by letting tho man go,' and, before I could, answer, the thief «ettled the matter himself by scrambling to bis feet and running away.. 'ThatdocMcsit,' Iaoid. 'Ijhinkyour request a strange one, bnt, nevertheless, I am mcch bshotden to yon for your assistance. I am a' comparative stranger in Melbourne.' ' So I supposed. Cot me put you In your way aenin.' \ - ' I hAve seen you. 'before,' I said, as wo passed a lamp and tbe light revealed my companion's features. ' Wcro you not in tbo sparring-room jurt now?' 'I was, and I saw you there; 1 suppose yoa mused your friend in tbe crush.' ' Yc% but I Rball soon find him again. May I offer you any money?' I added, with some hesitation, for, though my rescuer's broad ehouldera' wcro clod only tn a rough pea-jacket, and his head in a rough far cap, hit language wan that of an educated person, and his physiognomy had struck ma in the ooxing-ioom as being that ot no common man. 'Tb&nk; yoa— no,' ho returned briefly. 'There's your way ; good nlghtl' I found Walter looking out for me in front of tho hotel. '1 was beginning to fee! anxious about you,' he said, ' for there were a. good rnanv rough characters about. You didn't think we bad this sort of thing in Mclboornc, ch ?' I did nof auiwcr immediately, for I was divided between toy good wishes for the speaker and my dislike to anything in the way of ' preaching,' 5' Do you approve of ' this sort ot thing,' Walter ?

The pieces, of course, cannot bo placed - on tbo stage with tbd splendour of London or Paris; 'StSD.^thcy arc fairly mounted, and the singing is not to 'be des pised. Indeed the basso— the Duke- Alfonso of to- nightr-is at present under engagement tolionaon, and in my Opinion ho will do no discredit to tho boards of Her Majesty's. But yoa will bo abla to judge for yourself this evening. I see by tho papers, too, that a now' tenor undertakes Gtennoro, bnt I, do not expect much from him— tha tenor is alwayff tho trcok point of second and third-rate companies.' ' DonisetU's 'Imcieria' is evcrywhaw a favourite, nnd when we reached the Opera-, house, in the evening it was filled from floor to ceiling. Tho overture was played— jthe curtain raised— the opening chorus sung1— and the new Gennaro made his, appearance^ Though evidently not young, ho was slight and undersized, and certainly looked inoro of, a stripling than tho robust young woman who played Moffeo Oroini; but his voice was good, and hod nonuthing in its tones which nwolio a vagno recollection within 'me. His face/ too~-despito tho 'tinted 'check, tho blackened eyebrow, and tha pointed beard — struck roc as ono that I had seen before: and for somo time I -vainly tried to remember ^horo ; but no sooner hod tho singor apprqached tho footlights and commenced j tho Dcoutifal 'Bi ncscator* ignobllo' than the truth came to mo uko a flash. Tito voioo was Dumoriay'sl I looked round at tho Count and bow by his ?faco that he had made, by tbo eyo, that din covcry which had come to me through tho car. « ,, lt Yos t— scarcely less sweet snd powerful for thepasmgo of over. twenty years, these, wcro the tones which had mado such an indelible impression upon my memory on that long past night .at Honkton-Edgctt. My mind travelled back to that time, and, absorbed in a painful reverie, I heard as in a dream tho increasing applauao which greeted each suc cessive effort of tho now singfr. Would he recognise tho Count or myself, I wondered ; bnt no — his eyes, as they roved over tho house, rested upon our party several times, .and no look or motion betokened that he knew either of us. But of tcr a time something occurred which did make him start. Towards the end of the second act there flounced into the stalls' a party of flaunting, overdressed women, and no sooner did Ocnnaro's glanco alight on them than ho gasped, faltered in his music — and then went on again with an evident offort. Directing my glatu upon tho group which hftd caused this emotion/! was startled in my turn to recognise another link between mo and my unfortunnto pa-it. Amongst tho impudent paintadfaccs — altered byyearsanddusipation, by rouge and violet powder, bnt unmistakeablo through all— was tho faca of Glika Nasilo vilch I That she had— wholly or partially— recog* niscd ?Duraarjay was evident -from tho fixed gazs with whi*h sho regarded him. Singing or silent, moving bNduJ or standing niill, sho never took her eyes oS him, and so uncom fortable did ho grow under this scrutiny that his performance deteriorated until poopla bs giut to think if he was ill. At last, however, the Russian relieved him ot her presence by leaving the house, and tho last act was unjig as well as the Urst had been. ... ?, The opera coma to an end 4 - Gennaro, having duly died in great agony, was. called before tbe curtain to receive, with his Bnppo si-ti- tious mother, ft final tribute ot applau«e, and then for the fint time I thought ot looking at tho play-bill. ?? Gennaro— Sigoor Claudio Dimarclli.' 'Claude Dumarlay, Italianised,' I said to the Count, as wo left the theatre. ' That re moves? all doubt 1' 'Yes,' he replied; 'but I knew him the moment I set eyes on him.' 'He U not the only ghost of tho past that has risen before me to-night,' I -aid, agd was proceeding to. speak of the Btuwian woman, when tho all-seeing Count interrupted me. Ho had recognised her m soon as I had. ' Put theoe wrctchc* out of your mind, my dear Ilaymonu,' ho Bald* 'They were not in it when yon went to this theatre; -and a little effort will drivo them out again.' But cren as 1«- npokc, and as wo crossed the street which skirted the rear ot tho Opera house, we naw a dense crowd collected round the stage-door, and soon gathered from the Kcrep* of conversation around us that fiignor' Diruarelli had been accosted, nnon leaving the theatre, by a low woman, who had not only claimed him as an old friend but had assaulted him upon hin repudiating tho acquaintance. 'The traps u taken 'cr oil to diokoy!' shouted ono delighted gamin to another, and in a few minute* two constables made their way through tlte throng, dragging between them— filrnggling, yelling and blaspheming— Glika Nassilovitch. -- ' I thought an much,' said the Count, as, having ncen them disappear into tho neigh bouring police-office, we pursued our .way to tha railway-station, whither Walter and 1'aola bad prcecacd us. t (To he amtimttd.)
