WEDNESDAY. Tho caso was called on at ten o clock. Charles Lett, being sworn, stated I was in the Court of Quarter Sessions when the prisoner Jackson waa prosecuted by Bertrand for sending bim a threatening letter I heard Ber- trand cross-examined by laokson, and heard him say that lie had sent a letter to Sirs Kinder, addressed " Sly Dear Lllcn He mentioned that ho had enclosed a ring ia the letter Mr Dowling, tho Chairman of Quarter Sessions, asked Bertrand whethei it was usual for a gentleman to send a ring to a lady when writing to her He said w hen he wanted her very parti oularly ho enclosed lils ring-that ho wanted her to como and nurso him-that he would take his medicine from nobody else and that she did come and nurso him He said that ho had been in the habit oi lending Jackson small sums of money, and that ho had been introduced to Jackson by Kinder, who had known Jackson in New Zealand This was, I think, said in Bertrand s examination in chief, and in cross examination I believe he said that these sums paid to Jackson were to be de- ducted from some amount that Kinder owed to Jackson I re- member Mrs Kinder being examined by Jackson, who asked her whether Mr Kinder was of a jealous disposition, and whether he was jealous of Bertraud She said yes, that he was jealous of everybody, but that there was no ground for his jealousy Charles Charlea Edward Ranclaud sworn, Bald I am a clerk in the City Bank, and am slightly acquainted with the prisoner Ber trand I was at Bcrtrand's house one night, about a month berore Sir Kinder a death I w cnt Hiero from tho theatre, with Bertrand, about twelve o clock at night, and remained there about a quarter ol an hour I left the house vv ith Bertrand and his assistant, the witness Byrne, shortly after midnight I asked Bertrand where ho was going, and lie said that he was going out fishing I UBked bim what he was going to do with the hatchet which he had with Min The hatchot was something like that now shown to mc, but I oould not swear positiv ely to it AVhen I asked bim what ho was going to do with the hatchet, he answered as well as I can remember that some- body bad insulted him, and ho was going to knock a hole in the boat By Sir Roberts I have had some conversation with Sir Elliott, the detective officer, with reftrenco to this ma.ter I told Sir Elliott In the City Bank what 1 remembircd of tho conversation I had had with Bertrand, and I have said out of court that I could not remember precisely what Bertrand had eaid to me I have, however, gil en the substance of lils answer AVhen Mr Elliott carno to mo I wrote down what I remembered of tho conversation on a piece of pnper Alexander Bellhouse, sworn, said I hav e known the prisoner for nbout three years, but for two years of that time I had not seen him uutil about three or four weeks ngo I met him then on board the Manly Bench steamer, when ho invited me to his house and I went there the iollowlng evoniug I remained nt his house for three or four hours, and was there introduced to his wife and Sirs Kerr AVhen I left the house ho Baid ho wanted to tell me something, and walked out with me He then volunteered a statement to me, saying that ho had pur- chased pistols in the garb of a woman, having shaved off his moustache entirely He said ho was sorry for Kinder, but Hint lie was in his way and in less than twelve months lie (Bertrand) would bo married to Sirs Kinder, as lie intended to get a divorce from his wife Ho said ho was a powerful mesmerist, that he had great influence ovci his wife, and could make her do anything ne liked Ho said that his vv ile knew nil about the affair, and was very fond of him and that ho could mukc her do anything for him Ho did not say anything pniticular about his lnlmcnco over Sirs Kinder I think ho said that he put the pistols in Kinder s way, but I will not swear to that By Mr Roberts Bertrand and I went into a cafe that night It was about eleven o'clock when I went out of the house vv ith Bertrand, and was with bim, I think, lor about nu hour I was not with bim until two o'clock the next morning Ho volun tocred tho statement I huye referred to without my having questioned him at all Kinder s affair was not in my mind nt all at tho time Bertrand spoko of Kinder s death flic con vcrsation was not begun by my saying, " AVhat sort of a vvomnn is Sirs Kinder ? 1 should like to be introduced to her ' Bertrand said he had something to tell mc, and then he made the statement I have repeated He said ho was a mesmerist, but not that he could make his wife do anything by means of lils mesmeric power I understood him to say that lie had great power over his wife, but not by menns ol mesmerism Bertrand said that Kinder had shot himself, but I don t think he said any more about it Ile did not tell me this In answer to any question from me ne enid ho was sorry for Kinder, and I think that it was immediately alterwnrds that he said that Kinder was in his way 1 am not positive as to that He told me that in the garb of a woman ho him- self had purchased the pistols I will not swear that lie men- tioned Klndcr's name iii connection vv 1th these pistols, but 1 believe ho said ho put thom in his way Ho did not say " So long as Kinder vv as in ills way he could not get married to Sirs Kiuder" lie said Insomopnrt of the conversation that Kinder was in his way I am certain ol that I had ono drink with Bertrand that night I believe By Mr Butler It was when wo left the houso that ho mnde the statement to mc, nnd we went afterwards, and had a drink at one of tho cafes Ho told mo ho was present when Kinder shot himself, and that he had bought the pistols I will uot swear that ho said he put the pistols in Kinder s way By Sir Roberts I had a glass of brandy and water at Bcr- trand's house,
