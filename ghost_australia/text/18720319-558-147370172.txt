THE CONCERT. A musical and elocutionary entertain ment was given in the evening by the members of the Young Men's Literary Association, at the Mechanics' Institute. The hall was literally crammed, and as the proceeds are to be devoted to the funds of the St. Patrick Society's band, the members may well be congratulated on the abundance and excellence of the notes that are likely to assist their music. Much of the success is uo doubt due to the inviting charactcr of the programme. An overture and several national airs were played by the band in a style that shewed they had devoted much time and pains to their duties. The songs, of which there ?was a numerous list, were well rendered, and when it is mentioned that Messrs Brearley, Rashleigh, and M. J. Holt, the blind minstrel, were among the singers it will readily he imagined that the har mony was quite as select as abundant, the Rev. T. M. O'Callagban presided, and the Very Rev. Archdeacon Slattery was present on the platform. It may be men tioned that two recitations by the reverend chairman were rendered so effectively as to take the audience by surprise. The first was " Gongane Barra," a translation by Callinan from the works of Cormick O'Can lon, an Irish poet of high repute; and the second was King Brien's address to his army at Clontarf. Probably the mostamusingpiece of theevening was " Father Dwyer's Ghost," from Charles O'Malley, read by Mr M'Donald, and a scene between " Palstaff and Heniy," in which the same gentleman and Mr Wallace were very successful. The original song by Mr Smith was well sung, and afforded great fun on account of its local hits, and concluded an agreeable entertainment.
