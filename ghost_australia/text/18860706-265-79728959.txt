DEAR Siu,-Owing to Ibe general depression I have ft little time to tparu and bop to offer | n rejoinder to " Slyeut»'" letter which appeared m your fe&ae; of fhe 2*t<h ult, < The cause of the InuicnesF in my opinion nl tlic bftbc Alphabetical Jockey Club meet- ; jug was the want <>f cash; williout a lair I supply °f which everything is tame. ! J notice " Slvcuh" refers to the Secretary*! ; there was n little delay in bringing the ! weight* to the course )>nt I observed the I jockeys were weighed out before the hurdles ' wore iu ponitiou ; " fclycus'1 has shown bib I ignorance of the duplicate flag Hytfutn, other wise he would jutt mnko ihe ivfercacc to it! which be does. I nra noiuii advocate of thin system, I merely want to hhuw that" Slycua" jias placed himself in the position of n sporting correspondent and no doubt in the eyes of the ^porting public he lias Mgnnlly fuHcrf. In fact, to uhb of his oivn word*, lie has luude n. bvirrilc. lilts aucouut of the racing generally in immt amusing. He wiyn the 1'lying and TuiubollnndicHps were a certainty and foregone conclusion for Ciar \ he a poor judge of human nulurc if he thinks owner* wilt pny up a riud of exceed ing £40 for thoVe two hnudicupK if they had no chnuce: let him fl'-k the owners if they thought they hud tuit the ghost of n show. My experience in railing men do not pay «p for nothing. He wiyn the l>oetor gut thiuwu in tlie I'matc bwucp of HUhovn (tbin UftH only the (secretary told ine on the cour-i- if J iumuinbcr rightly, but j»eihaj>s '. .Slycn«M added il&xora;,), but if 1 remember correctly it was mn the Northampton (Jift. I meiuly wish U> «how what a bungle tliis Heaven- horn sporting cor. has made of his report. 1 offer a little friendly advice to " Slycus" it IN before writing a sporting mem. to have u good fierasual of articles wiitU'ii by Augur, 1'eguMjs, or onr own t'yc/op*;, arid make reference to condition of tlit: horses, their running the riding of the jockey*, &c.;, fioinclbing readable, old buy. The public ure not interested in (he exact nutnbet of follies inonkcvb und gees#; <m the course, he has miscalculated the iiuuiber ol the latter, tliere weic apparently three on the course ; I will leave him to rccollcct who the (bird was. if any improvement is required i» the management of clubs sporting correspondents would do well to make KUggflstions which nu doubt would prove beneficial for the better working of provincial club". After a tour down South nnd a look about 1 may in a future issue offer a few suggestions. However, in the meant ime, 1 suggest " Slycufc" f^houM (subscribe to the Av*traUi*'nni and read, mark, Icnrn and inwardly dige&t; '. Augurs'" Kporiing coloimis.
