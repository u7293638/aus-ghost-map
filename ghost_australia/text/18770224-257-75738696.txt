COMICAL CUTTINGS. A LIKING. We met at a ball, and a something Came over tnc, bidding me stay On a scat by her side, like a dumb tliir.g, While others were waltzing away. Was it love that so lightly oucliaiued me Aud kept me aloof from the rest ? Or what was the spell that retained me, And me so lazy a guest ? She was old and she hadn't the ghost of A cliarm that should fascinate uie, Her complexion was nothing to boast of, Her manner remarkably free ; Yet 1 stuck by her while 1 was able, Ami found her society nice, For she'd charge of the 'I'resUineut room table, And gave out the Btrawberry ice.
