' THE FIR11I ' IN LONDON. TUe Ghost Walked Very Quickly, Nowadays responsible management is usually signalised by tho paying of treasury on a Friday, whioh is a great boon to the rank and-file of theatre employes, who are enabled to do their week's marketing on the Saturday before the matihees begin (says the London Pelican). On lu-iday night last the curtain fell at tlie Shaftesbury (where 'The Scarlet Feather ' is being played) at 11 o'clock, and in five and twenty minutes every member of the company had received his or her little envelopes of ' salary.' This is rather a change, for under former managements the ghost sometimes walked very slowly, often, indeed, into the following week, and some times had not strongth enough to walk at all.
