THE sad fate of General Babcock, of the United States Coast Survey, who, together with his private Secretary, was recently drowned off Musquito Inlet; Fla:, "calls up a chapter of memory, the recital of which may not be uninteresting. ' The lighthouse at Musquito Inlet is built of Coquina, a species of coral formation, and stands at the end of a low, flat, promontory jutting out from the island which lies between the Indian River and the Atlantic. Ordinarily this promontory is dry and covered over with snow-white sand, but during a storm the sea breaks over it, completely submerging it, and the light-house, looks like a mere speck out in the ocean. On a bright January morning some six years ago, I was rambling about on this promontory, and, with the curiosity natural to a land lubber, I made my way to the light-house keeper with questions. He was quite as willing to talk as I was to listen, and while I gazed out over, the limit- less expanse of water and listened, to the lazy swash of the waves as they chased each other along the beach, he he told me the following strange story. Said he : ' " Nancy and I had been married nearly twenty-seven years, and had, lived all that time solitary and alone in the little cabin you see yonder through the trees. We had passed the prime of life and I was begining to think we would have to finish the journey alone, when the Lord took pity on us and gave us our little Marine to gladden our old hearts. I wanted to name her Nancy, for her mother, but a day or two after she was born a grand Spanish lady, Donna Castina, whose, husband owned a big sugar plantation just above here on the river,stopped at our house. "When she found out we had a new baby, you, never saw a woman carry on as she did. She would not have been, any more de- lighted if she had discovered, a gold' mine. She had ...never . had,,,any ' children, and it looked likesshe hud' sot her heai't on taking ours away from us. She. sent her ..servants /.on up to tho plantation and stayed. lit our cabin' two or three > day d' begging us for that baby. She promised that, alie would tako lier back to 'Havana,' with her; have-her educated at tho best schools ; "marry her ? to ? some, great Spanish/ grandee, rind will' her. all her wealth when she died. But it was of no use; :I would hot'!have parted with that baby for all the money in Cuba. When, she saw sho could.not beg, borrow nor. buy.it, she: askedthopriyilege.of.nnining.it. She she seemed, so iirlove with the, little thing that wo could not refuse, so she had lier christened Marino. That is" how she came to have such an odd name. It seemed to me ns, Marino grow older that the orange blossoms' were sweeter, themocking birds sang prettier, and the flowers were thicker mid brighter every day, Nancy looked yoting again,.and the whole world ' setmied happier.
