THE SONG OF THE CAMPBELTONIANS. Mr. * * * we hear, is going to leave us, The newsmen in this, must surely deceive us; Of such a bright gem as this to bereave us, Can no good end answer, saving to grieve us. Beloved he is by every one round, E'en by those who themselves his victims have found, And also by those who ne'er hear the sound Of his voice, save when they are trod to the ground. We said we were free, but since he came here, Our birthright we've lost--that all held so dear; And his laws and his justice, they keep us in fear Of passing our days in the prison so drear. If some poor wight, in the flow of his soul, With some of his friends should partake of the bowl, He dearly must pay e'er he passes the toll Of * * * to * * * or some else on the roll. He keeps us all in a terrible stew, Such vagaries his prolific brains brew; And if what we've heard turns out to be true, Without him I do not know what we shall do. We have therefore thought proper to call your at- tention To all and every of that we've made mention, And what would be the best means of prevention, Of that for which we feel apprehension. We would thus propose, that no time should be lost, But a Petition be drawn up and forthwith engrossed, And let it be sent by the very first post, To retain Mr. * * * * of Justice--the Ghost.
