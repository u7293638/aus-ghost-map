The great skill of an advertiser is seen in the" success of his business. If the advertising, is skilfully,-i.e., "judiciously" done, the returns are sure and success is certain. The great lever of business is advertising. Care which is generally credited with being able to kill a cat, must be an expert shot. The best men who have gone wide of the mark in their endeavours to "pot" the midnight musi cian with a bottle of bootjack. ; Your object in advertising is to let the people know what you have got to sell, and if you have not the pluck to keep advertising until you have imparted the information all the money vou have spent is lost. A. T. Stewart once said : " He who invests one dollar in business should invest another dollar in advertising that business." There are many ways and means of adver tising, and probably all of them are of more or less value, but no other secure the good results attained by the newspaper, and no other give such good returns for the money invested. The live newspaper reaches a class that can be re ached in no other way, and produces results^ to be arrived at by no other medium. Advertising is.the business man's breath. Dr. Schleiman's discoveries of ancient sites and buried treasures will enthuse all lovers of classic history, and from a valuable accession to the achievements of patient search and zealous inquiry. They fix and locate events, it is true, and verify or contradict the teachings of cen turies. But really they are not as important as some of the developments of medial scionce, nor will they revolutionize the world of original ideas, as did the discovery of Udolpho Wolfe's Schiedam Aromatic Schnapps... . ... . " . DARKNESS.-We have waited patiently for some weeks past in the hope, that the Railway Commissoriers would see the necessity for making some improvement in the present ex isting arrangements for lighting on the railway platform. Night after night the place has been almost in darkness caused by bad kerosene Hand lamps are used to show people about, anil possibly candles will be brought into requisition. The man who without interruption can keep his name before the public is constantly inform ing possible customers who he is, where he is to be found, and what he is prepared to do. Pos^ and that before every harvest there must be preparation of the ground. But without doubt as with each succeeding month the advertise ment becomes more familiar to the public, so do the profits correspondingly increase. An eminent Bostonian, who regards an adver tisement in a newspaper as a personal invitation to call, says : " While I sometimes hesitate about entering a store the proprietors of which? have not thus sent their card to my residence,, I always feel certain of a cordial welcome from the members of an advertising firm." When you pay more for rent of your stores than you* do for advertising, you are pursuing a falser policy. To THEATRICALS.-We are now giving notice to travelling troupes that on no consideration can we take orders for printing or advertising, unless such be prepaid. This may be hard upon forwarding agents who are not always supplied with too much money, but hard as it may appear we object to be troubled by every adventurer who comes along. Gas at the Institute is not lighted for theatricals until the money is paid, and so will it be as regards printing. The Intransigeants who believe that the welfare of the Church and the world depends^ upon the full restoration of the secular monarchy of the Roman Pontiff, are inclined to the elect ion of a resolute fighter. They dare not go so far as at once to propose a foreigner, since all the Popes for the last two centuries have been Italians. But they are said to be felling the pulse of the college towards such a change. If." the innovation should be ventured upon, the choice would rest upon a Frenchman ; and then the candidate in this case would be Ord inal Leavigre who has served the Roman Church-: so well by his attitude towards the Republic^ and would be a persona grata to the popular opinion in Europe and America on account of his leadership of the anti-slavery crusade. Not - the least attraction of a French Republic Pope it is said, would be the soreness which. such a choice would create throughout monarchical Italy. They point out that it was the French Republic which restored the Temporal Power to1 Pius IX., aud that the hatred between the French and the Italians is far more acute no vsr than it was in 1849.
