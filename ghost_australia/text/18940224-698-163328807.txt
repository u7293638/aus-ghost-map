Friendship Between Men and Women. A woman's beauty is, after all, the most formidable of all barriers to disinterested friendship. Beauty, my lord, 'tis the wor.-st part of woman, A poji- weak tlnnfr, assaulted every hour liy creeping minutes of defacing time ; A superficies, which each breath of cara Blasts off, and every humorous stream of grief 'Washeth away as rain doth winter snow. When love comes in at the door, friendship flies out of the window, and seldom finds its way back. Not often from the ashes of a dead love will the phtenix of friendship arise ; commonly the only form that stirs there is the pale, brooding ghost of departed bliss— the only sound that moves, the sigh of shattered faith. 'Nay, but,' says one, 'there are many instances in disproof of that. Take Madame llecamier, for instance ; did she not turn many of her lovers into friends, and did they not live tor years in perfect amity ?' Well, she claimed to have done so, but it is difficult to believe that she did not feod their attachment with thin, delusive hopes. It costs so little effort to send a tender glance from eyes so eloquent as hers ; and though la belle Juliette affected to ignore the source of ner power, none knew better than she that it lay in her beauty.— (Sm Hisuhket Maxwell in Nineteenth Century).
