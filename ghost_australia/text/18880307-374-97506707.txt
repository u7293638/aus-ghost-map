Carl Sunder. He Talks About New Year's Resolves. Now, ehildrens, der time vhas near at handt vhen mors' eaferypody likes to do petter for der next year. It vhas shusfc like rolling off some log to be good. If you vhas badt you vhas all de time afraid that some ghosts or policemans grab you. If I vhas a lawyer I sh wear off dot and cefc some law sendfc for badt man to State prison, und I doan' shtand oop pefore some shury and cry for him. If I was a doctor I swear off dot . I doan'look like an owl some more und: sharge a poor person two dollars for it.â– " If I was some editor I shwear off dot if somepody preak his leg I doan* say dot he vhas killed so deadt ase nefer vhas, und dot all his relatione vhas robbed by tieves und den run oafer by the cars. If I vhas a policemans I shwear off dot I doan' go to sleep quite so mooch in somepoby's doorway. If I keep hotel I shwear off dot I doan' puy so mooch chicory for der coffee, and dot I doan' hold oop my hand trad say dot some neck-piece vhas der werry pest.siloin shfceak I can puy in dis market. If I vhassojBSL-Alderm&iis; I iiliwuITi off riot 1 viiaa elected to make some money from der peoples, und dot we can't puild no pridges nor haf some electric light unless I feels some " sugar" in my handt. If I vhas some farmer I shwear off on being so honest, und I do some growling if der weather vhas badt. If I vhas some preacher I shwear off on dot heathen in Africa. Maype it vhas better dot we look oudt for a wild niggei; in Africa instead of some poor widows and orphans in America, but it doan' seem like dot to me. If I vhas some rich mans I shwear off dot I mus' haf fifteen per cent, for my money, und dot I haf no property to be taxed. I let der poor mens pay all der taxes und make all der pooblic improafments, und I enshoy myself so mooch ash neafer vhas. If I vhas some tramp I shwear off dot I doan' kill myself mit hardt work any moar', but dot der peoples who vhas industrious and safing should support me. Ash it vhas now, you know, der poor fellow vhas almoas' in der.gcafe py his hardt work.
