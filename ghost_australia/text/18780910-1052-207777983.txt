" Well, I will relate a peculiar ( affair that happened on Tallmans Gully, in 1859." S We. were all attention, and listened to the very rcmark- ( able narrative he related in the following manner : ) " You must know," commenced my uncle, " that I and \ four mates were living in a tent on the banks of the ( river — living, I said, I should have called it existing, for X we were most unfortunate, only finding sufficient gold to \ knp.n 11s in 1,1 in p.ommnnest tucker. After our cvcryday's ( work, you may be sure wo were tired enough ; but wc were ) every night disturbed 111 out' rest by the clink, clink, cljnk \ of a pick, about fifty yards from onr canvas home. This ( confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did ) not cease until the break of day. One night we were v determined to see who it was ; so wc sallied forth in the ' bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel ) shirt, high boots, and slouched hat, hard at work by an v old claim which bad been deserted for many years. I was " chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; ) but when. I was within twenty yards of him,-I stood still, v. transfixed with horror, — for the wearer of the digger's clothes was no tiring man, hut a stxloton /" ) "'Undle Ned I !' \ve all cried, " how fearful." , " One night, our tent was visited by a handsome, wcll- ' to-do looking man, of about- fifty years of age, who ) enquired for a digger of whom ...we '.knew nothing -iftbout.
