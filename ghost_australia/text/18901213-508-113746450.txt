A True Gli©st Story. Half a century ag«, en Christmas Eve, a iady threw herself from the window of her house, situated on the outskirts of a town in the South of England. The event occurred on a Christmas Eve. Her death led to law proceedings regarding the ownership- of the house in -which she had resided. The house was thrown into Chancery, and in a few years got the reputation of beine haunted. It was said that late on every Christmas Eve a window was thrown open, a white figure appeared, a low moan was heard, and a figure was seen to throw itself on the lawn beneath, where it fell with a ' dull thud.' This scene was supposed to be a repeti tion of that which had occurred when the lady of the house had chosen that method of leaving it some years before. Christmas Eve eight years age agentleman who did not believe in ghosts was pass ing that house! It ^was a. weird, desolate looking place. All the windows were broken, it was destitute of paint, and the grounds around it were a field of long rank grass. Just as the gentleman got in front of the house he heard something like a moan ; the clock struck 11, an upper window was thrown open, something white appeared, fell headlong from the window and struck the ground with a ' dull thud.' For a moment the spectator was nonplussed. ' I must have made a 'mistake, the clock struck 12, and that was the ghost,' -Ee thought. His common, sense soon, however, got the better of this idea, and he advanced to the gate to examine the pre mises. The gate was unlocked, and this helped to reassure him. He walked on to the lawn, and there found two old women preparing to carry a,-»ray a bundle of soiled linen. That was tbe ghost. The Chancery suit had been settled, and the con tents of the fc'ouse were to be |pld. The bed linen was being conveyed away by the old women to be washed ; and to save carrying it downstairs they had thrown it cut of the window.
