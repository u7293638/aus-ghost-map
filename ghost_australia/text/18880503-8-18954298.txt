The, Synod will have beard with sorrow of the somewhat sudden death of Mr George Knox, who, although not able to be present with us year by yeir in person, yet acting as our Bishop's chancellor has been of much assistance to us He had gone to Egypt in hope of deriving some benefit from the climate, but, just when his many friends were expecting his return, the news carno that he had died there He has gone before many much older than himself, but perhaps none more fitted to go than he Feeling, as I do continually, the need of having some one qualified and willing as he was to give advice on the many difficult matters that con- tinually ariBe, I have asked and obtained the con- sent of Mr A J Gould, who is known to all of ub, j to fill the place thus rendered vacant FINANCES I proceed now to speak of our finances, a subject which I would at all times gladly avoid, but which asserts itself on all occasions as an overwhelming necessity, even of Church life and Church work By your Treasurer's accounts you will be able to seo what our position is, but I think it desirable to set before you very buefly the most important points We began the year 1887 with a balanco to our credit of £1141 19s 3d, as against ¿1544 5s Id m '8G We end it with a balance to credit of only £261 18s lOd We received from all souices in 1887 ¿67454 7s lLd, as against £7525 9s Gd in '86 Wo expended in 1887, £83318s 4d, as against £792715s 4d in '80 The funds, therefore, at our disposal for 1887 were £8596 7s 2d, or £473 7s 5d less than in 1886, while our expenditure was £8331 8s 4d, or £-103 13s more than in 1836 The difference, there- fore, in the balance with which we began 1887 and this year, 1888, is just £877 Os 5d or £1141 19s 3d in '87, and only £2( 4 18s lOd in '88 I I quote these figures to show you how absolutely dependent we are upon the support, which, we trust, will be liberally given this year through the Centennial Fund We look to you to do through it what has been done for the last year or two through tho Extension Fund, and I again remind the Cleigy and the Parishes that, unless the Diocesan Council is supplied with sufficient funds, it will be impossible to continue the payment of the £100 to every clergyman in aid of the parochial contributions We have never yet failed to supply this amount, but it even now takes all but a veiy small portion of the 15 per cent contributed to the General Fund to enable us to do so the centennial fund. I como now to a subject of great interest and im portance, not to us only but to the whole Church throughout the province-the Centennial Fund, its position and prospects I need hardly tell this Synod that it was founded by a resolution of the Provincial Synod, which met in Sydney last October, as a means of Bhowing our gratitude to Almighty God for the many blessings which in this the hundredth year of oui Australian national life we so abundantly enjoy It is the dehbeiate move ment of nur Church, as such, to express, not in words only (which are very well in their place), but by deeds, without which words are but idle wind,-to express this truth, as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, that all . we have, and are, we owe to the bounty of God, and that in return we mean to give, especially for His woik, His kingdom, His glory, something out of that which He has given to us Not as though He necdeth anything, for Heaven is His throne and earth is His footstool, but the man who ib found willing to give to God of his worldly goods will first of all have given, m some degree at least, his heart, and that is what even the Almighty God does deign to need, the love of the hearts of us His children That is why the Lord has instructed the Church to teach, an d call upon its sons and daughters to give, to give freely, to give cheerfully, and to learn and know that it is more blessed to give than to íeceive And so the Church in i£s Provincial Synod, containing the chosen men out of every Diocese in the colony, resolved that this hundredth year of national blessing was the fitting opportunity to show on such a scale as had never been shown before a large hearted liberality in ex- tending and strengthening the Kingdom of Christ, -and I here say deliberately before God and you, my brethren, that the churchman who does not put his name down in the great Centennial Book of the Church, for something-I leave it al- together to him to determine how much and for what purpose-such a churchman will be grievously failing in his bounden duty te himself, to his family, to his brethren, as well as to his Lord, and, in my estimation, ought not to be ackn( wledged as a meinbet of the church at all For obbiive, the strength of the church depends upon the hearty union and co operation of all its membeis There is nothing that we cannot accomplish if we are united, but you know how one jibbing horse des troys the work cf a whole team, and, just so, one or two men in a pamh, and one or two parishes in a diocese, m ¿y fatally affect the success of any Church movement Need I say then, my biethren of the clergy and the laity, members of this Synod, chosen by your brother chuichmen as their leaders in all good works- need I say that I count on your individual co operation I ask everyone of you who has not as yet done so to give your name to oui Centennial Secretary to put in the fore front of yout parish contributions I do not ask for your " mite," for that was all the widow had, even all her living, and none of us can rise up yet to her standard, but I isk foi such an offering as that, when Christ looks on it, as no doubt He still does from His throne on high, He may accept it as the offering, great or small, of a willing heart I am glad to be able to say that this oui diocese comos out fanly well already in its contributions to the fund It has come up to the amount which the Pinnate expected from us as the lesult of our first movement That one Sunday enrolling of names gave us over one thousand names and over £10,000-of course this represents the promised contributions for the term of five yeai s But you will see at once that if 1000 men, women, and children have given their names, to be inscribed on the Centennial Roll, there aro ten or twenty times as many more in this diocese who as yet have not given their names at all The truth is this thousand of first fiuits has set all the rest an excellent example, they have come of their own accoid to have their names enrolled by our Secie tary, and our Secretary means that this work shall not stop until all the other members of the Church shall have their names also in his book. Think what a splendid result would be obtained if all would work together to this end,-with what ease and gladness we should be able to set in order every thing that is wanting ; no one without his share his honourable share of the burden ; no one over- burdened. Think how the great St. Paul would have rejoiced at the sight ; how he would commend us aB following his wise counsel " that there may be equality." You must pardon mo for dwelling on this subject a little longer, because, believe me, not only our ability to do more church work, but our ability to continue the work we are at present doing, depends entirely upon the measure of success we attain to in this matter. In this diocese the number of names enrolled is now 1300. In the diocese of Sydney they have only as yet obtained a little over 1200. What pro- portion do these numbers bear to the number of churchmen-nay even to the number who regularly attend church every Sunday. Why should these few bear the burden which all ought to share? Why should not all bear what these have taken upon themselves to bear. It is not that they are unable, no it is not even that they are unwilling, but they require to have it put before them so that they can see what their share of the ' work is ; they require to have it brought home to them that the Church that is, the Head of the Church, God Himself, expects it from them. It is ! my work to bring this before you it your work to bung it betöre them You ure tut men, tins is tin» place and this the time wh n and where the work is to be blocked out and ill iiTrangements made All success lnt'ieiy undittiking di petids upon a perfect orgam»iti ni and then willing workers to cinj it out Wv lune got our Oigaui^ing Secre tuy, the Dioeesin Committee has appointed lum I know and you know that ho is most capible and eagei fir the work , but the best geneial it nowhere without his cnpLains and lieutenants, md these again ire nowhere without the lank and file I lely on you, biethren, to see that this Synol does not pasb away ia empty talk I rely on you to take whatever place may be allotted to you ia tho orginw ition which our secretary will duect, and when he comes into your parish, as he » ill come into every parish which will receive him, don't let a siuglo churchman fail to receive a direct request to join in this work, and if any deliberately say No, I toont.'let lum feel, I hope he will feel, u, proper shame that others should be working for him and for Go I while he nnnsolf stands nloof It is neces- sary th it I should heie just remind you that thtough this Centennial Fund we are now working what tor a few ycats past we huve been woiking as our Church Extcn-a in Fund That fund is to be absorbed, and I tiust greatly enlaigod, m this Centennial Fund, and you will see, therefore, that this Fund is not something which is unnei e^sary and a mero outburst of sentiment, but it is to do, we hope, on a larger scale and in a better form for the next five yeais at least, what we have been hitheito doing for the extension of our work And J parnoBi-'y commend it to you as the best and most deliberate attempt yet made to carry on our woik m an orderly, organised way, so that as a church we may live not as we have been hitherto too much in the habit of living, from hand to mouth, so to speak, but that we may know before- hand what can bo depended on to embie us to meet oui liabilities and to extend our usefulness TEBRIFR OF LANDS A complete teint r of all lands belonging to the Church throughout the diocese has been with much care and (labour compiled by Mr Atkins I am sorry to bay thit this docs not at present belong to the dncese, though it is of the greatest importance to it It will be luid ou the table, and I recommend every clergymen or other person interested to ex inline it, and to see whether all the lands in his paush are contained in it, and in whose possession the deeds at piesent aie If notue is given to me of any omission or error I will take care to have it rectified It seems highly desirable that we should by degrees simplify the tenure and management of our Church lands as much as possible that to thiB end all lands should be handed over under the pro- visions of the Tiust Property Incorporation Act of 1881 to the Church Property Trustees These gen- tlemen form a body corporate, and directly land is vested in them all difficulties and confusions arising out of the death, absence, or incapacity of trustees come to an end No vacancies, as of private trus- tees, can take place, and consequently no fresh elections have to be eared for, accompanied with delay, trouble, and expense , so far as I see the only point not quite satisfactorily providi d for is connected with the management of lands It is obvious that in many, if not in all cases, the cor- porate body is not a body qualified to manage lands of any sort notably cemeteries which require constant and minute supervision Provision was made in the first draft of the Act to meet this difficulty, and the corpoiate body were em- powered to appoint agents in any given case to manage the various properties I think it might be useful and probably even will be found necessary, for Synod to pass some resolution direct- ing the corporate body how to deal with such cases, and generally diiectmg that the clergyman and ehurchwaidens ex officio should have power to regu- late and manage the lands held m trust by the corpoiate body Thete is one other point in connection with this matter to which I would draw your attention It is that a good many lands, specially cemeteries, have for some years past been vested m, not the body corporate, but in the names of the gentlemen composing for the time being, the body coipoiate Where ever this has been done the whole purpose of the act has been lost sight of They become then no more than private trustees, and any chango in their number necessitates a fresh conveyance, and consequently the old uncer- tainty and expense CHURCH rROrBRTT. SALES AND LBASINO BILL. At our last session, I Btated that there was being obtained from Parliament, by the Sydney diocese, an Act to provide for the stle and leabing of church properties, and that I hoped we might be able to have inserted in it a clause by which any diocese might take advantage of its piovisions This, however, it was found could not be done It was, I think, very unadvisedly passed through Parlia- ment during the absence of the Primate, and with- out any thought whatever for other wants than those of Sydney It has thus become necessary again to apply to Parliament, on behalf of all our other dioceses, and I have every hope that m a short time we shall obtain an Act in most respects similar to that of the Sydney diocese, in some re speets superior to it By it all future applications to Parliament for power to sell lands will become unnecessary, and in place of each new bishop having to obtain an Act to validate his position, this is done by this Act for all future time and for all future cases I may idd that the bill has passed its second reading m the Upper House I had hoped that it might have passod through both Houses before this, but I have found that it re quires much time and patience, not to speak of expense, to get a private bill through Parliament It will, at any rate1, when passod, remove a dis- ability which has lon^r pressed heavily on the Church, and from which other bodies of Christians are free BLANDFORD SCHOOL I thought it necessary at our last session to give you a somewhat detailed account of what is known as the Blandford School I then stated that the Master in Equity had given me four months in which to communicate with the committee of the S P C K, with respect to the course of action which they, as being paities interested in the matter, desired to follow I accordingly wrote to the Sec retary, giving particulars of the case, and asking, on behalf of our Bishop, and myself as his commissary, for the powers which the Court considered necessary to be held by someone on behalf of the Society I also wrote to the Primate, who was then at home, I to forward the object I had in view My solicitor, Mr Gould forwaided at the same time a draft of power of attorney which contained the provisions which the Master in Equity had intimated seemed to him necessaiy to enable us to appear befoie him on their behalf I ndue time I received a lettei from the Secretary, saying that the Society had carefully considered the whole question in the yeal 1882 on íeceiving a communication from our Bishop, that they still adhered to the conclusions then come to, and that they saw no reason to îe open the question The conclusion they had then come to was that the affair should be wound up, and that the contract entered into between the share holders and our Bishop should be carried out The secretary made no mention about revoking the powei of attorney held by our Bishop and myself, which ran to this effect, neither did he say one word about a fresh power of attorney being granted to any other person or persons Naturally I thought that the course agieed on in 1882 and still advo cated by our Bishop in 1886, would be carried out, but, I found to my great surprise, and only from a casual conversation with the Primate soon after his return to the colony that what had really happened was this that the Pumate had received a fresh power of attorney to himself and tho Rev Mr Child and that his intention was to oppose in every way the carrying out of the contract to wind up the scheme, and generally to advocate as in the interest of the Society the establishment of the school at Morpeth I have no doubt the Society cares little or nothing how the matter is settled, but it is obvious that the letter of their Secretary to me, saying they formed their judgment in 1882 and saw no reason for 'altering it, is wholly inconsistent with the action which is now being takdn by the Primate He reverses their decision, and opposes the carrying out of the contract made with the shareholders by our Bishop, and, by his action, if it should eventually be sustained by the Court, the Society loses its share and we lose our share of the £5000 agreed to be given by the shareholders If there was the least probability that such a school as the Primate advocates would ever be sanctioned under the peculiar circumstances of the case by the Court-a distinctive Church school, in which not religion only generally, birt special Church doctrine and discipline was to be enforced, and the school to be under the authority of the Church-then

THE PROVINCIAL 8TNOD The Provincial Synod, or rather I siiould say the Provincial Synods, were called together by the Primate in October last It must be confessed that we found oun>elves in a position very haid to define The members of the Synod wei e in fact sitting ind acting in a dual capacity, and from first to last it became necessary to connive at irregulaiitics which could not be avoided 01 cured I trust that the experience gained in the session will have convinced all the membeis that it has become absolutely necessaiy that the Constitutions under which the first Piovmcial Synod exists should be repealed, so as to allow free scope for the existence and action of that Synod which, I v entino to say, is far moro capable of doing useful work toi the Church I regret to have to admit that the Synod rejected a motion brought forward by myself dealing with this matter, committing itself only to a motion for consideration of the question, which ended in a report being presented near the close of the session stating that there was apparently no means by which the Constitutions of the two Synods'could be brought into harmony. As this is exactly what I have always held, I trust that the time will soon come when we shall be prepared to go to Parlia- ment and ask for the repeal of the Act, at least so far as relates to this utterly unworkable Provincial Synod. One important resolution, which I trust will bear 'good fruit before long, was carried in the Synod, viz., the appointment of a Committee of both HouseB to consider a scheme and sub- mit a plan for the repeal of the Church Act, 8 Will. IV., No. 5. As I have been urging the consideration of this matter for moro years than I can remember, I may be pardoned for feeling somewhat glad that majorities are begin- ning to agree with me. The committee haB had several meetings since the session, and has with much care framed an ordinance to provide for all those mattera which are at present dealt with under the Church Act. You will be asked to deal with this ordinance dur- ing our present session : but you will observe not as an ordinance to be passed by this Synod. It will be laid on the table, so that nil members may have an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the provisions ; but the course which I should suggest we should do well to pursne with regard to it is this : that we should either refer it to a select committee, or perhaps the Diocesan Council, or at once refer it to the Provincial Synod, the body that eventually will have to deal with it and pass it in such form as they may approve. It would be alto- gether useless to waste our time upon all its details now, important though they are ; it will be better to leave it to the Provincial Synod, where it will no doubt be very carefully dealt with, and when passed by them, and under it due provision made beforehand for all matters dealt with in the Church Act, we shall be in a position to go to Parliament and ask for the repeal of the Church Act. This was the course followed in Victoria nearly thirty years since, and they have had no difficulties whatever arising out of the action then taken. cathedral and bishop's court. There are two other matters about which I spoke to you in my address last year with the hope that something would soon be done. I regret to say that no advance has been made with regard to either of them : I mean the cathedral and the Bishop's residence. To the absence of our bishop this must in great measure be attributed. Plans have been prepared, and tenders obtained, for expensive repairs and alterations at Bishop's Court. It is certain the house is not in a fit state for any occu- pant of the See to inhabit. It is moreover daily growing worse, as an uninhabited house is apt to do. But I confess I am not prepared to say what it would be wisest and best t o do. The question may even havo to be considered whether the resi- dence of the Bishop of this See should be at Mor- peth or hero in the cathedral city. If here, then the house and land at Morpeth should be sold and the proceeds used for building here ; if at Morpeth, then the land or some portion of it here should be sold, as not being required, and with the proceeds tho house at Morpeth made what it should be. I With regard to the Cathedral the exact position 1 is this, that the committee has never been called together since the work of putting in the founda- tions has been completed, now nearly four years since. The sub-committee entrusted with the carrying out of this work has met, but a misunder- standing has arisen with the architect, who has stated that the elevation or design of the building itself has been accepted by the committee and bears the Bishop's signature, whereas it is obvious to all who inspect the elevation so signed by the Bishop, thatitcannotbeand never was intended to be erected on the foundations as now laid, and that it is no more than an approximate indication of the style of building to be eventually determined on and ap- proved by the committee. Whether it is expedient in the vacancy of the See for the committee to finally determine what the exact form of the build- ing shall be, is to me at least doubtful ; but I shall be very glad to have a meeting of the committee some time during the Session, so that I may be able to give some answer to the many enquiries which are constantly being made. the stations. I turn now to a subject concerning which I am glad to be able to speak more hopefully than for some years past has been possible. Good seasons and good management have gradually brought about results which aro very encouraging. A brief abstract of the accounts together with a statement of assets and liabilities will be laid on the table, and you will see that acrording to w hat is considered by competent judges a not unreasonable estimate the assets show a surplus of about £27,000. Even if large allowance is made for some doubtful debts, and lower prices for stock, still a substantial balance will remain to the credit side of the account. -This result is one which two years ago seemed well nigh impossible, and is no doubt largely owing to the very kind care and attention given to the management of tho property by the three gentlemen who have taken charge of it at your request. We shall do well, I think, to leave it to them to tell us when the circum- stances are such that it would be desirable to sell, or perhaps even empower them to sell when- ever they may consider it advisable. It has not been considered necessary to hold any ¡netting of the committee appointed in connection with this matter since the last session of Synod, but I ask them to meet as early as possible during the session. MORPETH ORDINANCE. At the last session a committee was appointed to draw up a case and obtain counsel's opinion thereon with respect to the Morpeth Endowment Ordinance. This has been done, and an opinion obtaiued from Mr. Wise will bo laid on the table. It is to the effect that under the Funds Ordinance, taken to- gether with the Morpeth Ordinance, the clergyman at Morpeth is entitled to receive £200 per annum from the Diocesan Funds. Unless the income of the Council is largely increased this year, it will apparently become necessary to reduce the £100 per annum hitherto paid to all the parishes, and fresh legislation will become necssary to rectify an anomaly that was never contemplated, by which one parish is to receive double the amount received by any of the rest. > DIVORCE BILL. I think it would be well if a resolution should be passed directing the Diocesan Council to watch any proceedings that may be taken to again legislate on the subject of divorce. The Church owes the Home Government hearty thanks for calling at- tention to the grave reasons which from a social and political point of view may be urged against the Bill. The very temperate and able despatch of the Secretary of State should be largely circulated in any future opposition to the measure ; but the reasons so well given there aro not reasons which specially weigh with us as Christian men. Argu- ments may be adduced against them, but no argu- ment can bo adduced against our Lord's short, clear, statement: "Whosoever marriefch her that i- i >-t .»..i.y ooinmitteth ¡id ii- 'ty."

Tli.it is what re mutriage, or as it has been euphemistically put, "foiming new and happier homes," means. MARRIAGES. With regard to the present Marriage Law, I pointed out in my last year's address, that there wein certain points in which it ivas urgently neces- sary that nitiuudtuents should be made. lu the Provincial Synod the matter was taken up, and a committee was appointed, and a report by them presented, which after quoting from from a report on the «ub¡ect brought up by tho Hon. Dr. Creed, and presented to the Legislative Council, concludes wit li t hose words : " Your committee heartily approves of the recommendations made by this seleet committee, and believe if they wore carried out they would fully meet all the requirements of the eise " 1 hope, therefoi ?>, this Synod will authonre its Piesident to si^n a petition on its behalf in which shall be embodied the íecoinmend ations m ide by tho select committee of the Legis- lative Council on Registration of Births, Deaths, and Mai nages, with a request that these recom- mendations be carried out It is one of the advantages of our thoroughly inde- pendent constitutional form of church government that we have power within ourselves to deal with any abuses or difficulties that may from time to time manifest themselves in our church life lhere is, therefore, no possible excuse foi allowing oui sclves by any illegitimate methods to deal with such matters Let us prize oin liberty and wisely use our powers If wo undei value these things, or neglect to use them, wo may lose them altogether I think such an occasion ns the pn sent is a fitting one on which to ask you to be on your guard against a nunnet of pioceeding which is becoming mercas ingly pievalent, and which is full of danger, pre- sent and future, to the best interests of the church By it the guidance and government of the chuich is being piactically sought to be taken out of the hands of those to whom by all law, human and divine, it belongs, and tiansfenedinto the hands of cei tain n responsible, unknown persons, who having by any mums obtained the command of a punting piess 01 the position of an editor can week after week issue then broad sheets full of the most veno- mous attacks upon all who, in matters the smallest as well as the greatest, diffei from ihcm These meu constitute themselves at one and tho same time-accuser and jury and judge and executioner They are not afiaid to speak evil of dignities They are quite forgetful of the íesti unt which prevented the Archangel Michael from bunging ev<;n against the devil himself availing accusation It does seem very necessary for churchmen to con- sider whether we are to live under episcopal and constitutional gove umont, or under a Government whirli may be described as editorial and tyrannical I know no influence and tyranny more hateful and demoralizing than that of many of the so called religious newspapers conducted by men whoBe first concern is to sell their paper, knowing well enough that if their paper does not pay they will soon lose their opportunity of setting biother against brother, and stirring up strife If any man sins against the Church's law, let him be openly accused and openly tried, and openly con- demned and punished, but to be stabbed in the dark by unknown assailants, to be condemned without hearing, and often times for thintrs that are no offences at all, this is surely altogether in- tolerable, and the church should,put it down with a firm hand. It is the glory of the church that its platform is wide enough to contain men, who, outside the creeds, may hold opinions widely differing. True charity consists not so much in loving those who agree ivith you as in loving those who differ from you. It is a terrible and unmis takeable sign of a narrow sectarianism when a man is so possessed with his own opinion about eomo small detail of government or discipline tuat for the sake of it will either leave tho great mother church himself or cast out of it if he can all who will not conform to his opinions. The liberty we claim for ourselves, wo should be ready to grant to. others. There is quite enough work for us to do in ordering our own lives, and witnessing against known and open sin. Let us leave our brethren to do the same in their own way. Let us hand down to our children the broad liberty inherited from our fathers, acknowledging no Master but Christ, and welcoming as brethren all who, in ways it may be not our own, revere and love that holy name. CONCLUSION. And now, brethren, I have endeavoured to tho best of my ability to set before you the work of the church in this diocese ; what has been done, what still needs to be done. I ask you to remember that on you lies the responsibility before God of securing success in all those matters which belong to you to regulate and set in order. Some of them are very pressing and of the greatest importance. I bog of you to bring to bear on them all the wis- dom, patience, and forbearance which is needed to bring about good results. I ask you to strengthen my hands, to be all the more loyal to the office I fill, because I occupy it only for a short time, and as it were by accident. Let him who shall next be called to occupy the office of Bishop in this diocese feel when ho comes amongst us that our zeal has not slackened, nor our piety and devotion grown cold, even though our head has been removed from us, and we have been left for a timo without that special guidance, which from the times of the Apostles has been provided in the good Providence of God for the wollbeingof His Church. Brethren, I commend you to the gracious guidance of the Holy Ghost to do the work for which you are gathered together here to-day. Mr. E. Parnell thought the President, who mentioned the gift of land made by Mr. Armstrong at Mount Vincent, should also have mentioned the name of Mr. M'Alpin, who gave land for the church at the Bulga. The President said he had not known of the gift, but would take care to include mention of it in his address when printed. i On the motion of Mr. Hickson, seconded by Mr. F. R. White, the President was thanked for his address, and he was requested to allow it to be printed. The required permission was given. REPORTS RECEIVED. The following reports woro received :-. Report of the Diocesan Council, with Treasurer's statement of accounts, and statistical and financial returns. Report of select committee on religious education of the young. Report of the Presentation Board of the Diocese. Report of the Diocesan Committee on the Cen- tennial Fund. Various notices of motion having been given, the Synod adjourned till half- past nine o'clock on Wednesday morning. Previous to adjournment, the Rev. Canon Selwyn formally resigned his position as an elected member of the Diocesan Council, feeling that course desir- able since he occupied the position of Vicar-General, .and therefore cm oßcio was a member of the Council. The Synod accepted the resignation on the motion of the Rev. Canon White, seconded by Major Holton, and the speakers expressed their regret that it had become necessary for the President to surrender a post which ho had held since the i Diocesan Council was formed.
