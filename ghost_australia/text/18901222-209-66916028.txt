A LHGEND OF "HAVNTED" GOVLLT. (By 'V'LIras S'svre.sT'cR '1'AeKeR,) AUNTED) Gully was haunted no longer.. The two original prospectors' ewho had nmed the place had been absorbed, ild almost forgotten in thebo concourse` of diggers, whose new log huts; claiins, and constantly agitated windhrlsses lic spoke the eviction of tho. ginus loci, which was popularly supposed to brood over the:buried gold' of 'this deepand densely-woodled ravine. Freonch Billy had explained the early existfng error attached to the locality, and I confess that the hitherto secluded spot wis rilled of its charmsa Is ihe did so. "'You seec," said he, with much excite nment, "those tc'o fellows work like niggers, two-tree-week, whenI they go to the township and drink cognac, plenty -too much-then comaue bacIlt: i the nighlt, fall down, roll down the gully, lose theoir swags-tlhen they say the plance is hated-ghosts take away their things. Srac) I they got dlrunk, that's all. ,Considering that Billy, oil his l irstt pilotage. of myself to the tiully, had pointedl out a swag reposing against a trlee, lfil. way ilowns oan of the sildes of theo great 'rift, whore it had isppnarently bee,' ssou ghl t to a sudden stop in its ldownward' career,. end reilecting' also thrit eo'discoveered tlhat' same afternoon a inoi tin billy, aa siiall big of flour, and ia pick-handle, at various points, rind tlhat when after "infinite pains wehad cnried these rbtiblos Land our own tools to the prospector's ulit,.half way up the other side of the ravinel, we Isad.l bee received with smuiles nIII unlimited'olf'ers of battle-axe, I came, to lie conclusion, that Billy was right. As to the pros pectors, they didn't care. They were on. good gold, and had probablly spread thliu report of ghostly tthieves to scare aVwayu intruders. But sticking so Coiitantly to the sale place wavs against them,.. They were wvatclhed aied the new runti hegan, Iheaded by oursealvoes. It was not long before our party of five lhad run up a subatantial log hut, and were living in clover, retiring to rest in our hunks at nighlt literally tired out, and-oh, delightful life-dreaming of unearthling the largest inuggeot over heard of. With the exception of niever knowing wlhat Jemniy, oun, nwsv clhan partner, wonld Im uip to next, our lines had indceed cthancedl upoin pleasant places, and when the puddinig IImachin - was 'finisheld we cojsideorl that we should be, able to ismake plenty of trilbute moniey, even if our own claimi turned. out to Ie ait dulltr.

Sauerkraut had worked his clain with varyilng success, always hIutting, or in other words, living alone. Good luck invariably ended in a carouse, and 'he would emerge from i bout' as oco "wlio' had come back from the dead.; Ie had, wlhen debarred from our society, two constant comipanions one inanimate, the other dumb. Yet from the former hie could evoke such sweet aniid solemni strains, that hli solittude was solitude no longer, and il iny a digger, passing his rude biut on the hillside after nightfall would pause And listen, And perclhance renmarking to himself, with bated breath, that " Sauerkraut was on the picolo gaini" stroll oni in meditatlive mood.
