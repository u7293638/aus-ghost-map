AN INDIAN GHOST STORY. A fukeer, who is said to have lived on terms of intimacy with a ghost for upwards of twenty-four years, arrived here, says the Cal- cutta Daily News, from Rungpore recently, accompanied by his friend, a ghost, and is putting up in a garden house in Dum Dum, belonging to Baboo Guru Prosonno Ghose. Between 5 and 6 p.m. there was a small friendly gathering at No 1 Jorabagan, the town house of Baboo Guru Prosonno Ghoso. Baboo Dukhina Runjun, a wealthy zemindar of Rungpore, was one of the party. The ghost happens to be an old acquaintance of this gentleman, and was introduced by him many years ago to the late Rajah Baroda Kant Bahadoor. Many were the interviews which both the Rajah and Baboo Dukhina Runjun had with the spirit in days gone by. The spirit is said to be under great obliga- tions to Baboo Dukhina Runjun, for at the spirit's request or recommendation, the Baboo has made the present of a taluk to the fakeer, the friend and travelling companion of the ghost, yielding an income of 7,000 rupees per annum, which the fakeer still enjoys. Baboo Dukhina Runjun believed the ghost could not have forgotten this. It was upon the strength of this belief that he asked the party assembled at Jorabagan to start for Dum Dum at once, although Baboo Guru Prosonno had been told by the fakeer that it would be advisable to allow tho spirit two or three days' rest from the fatigue of travel be- fore an interview was sought. The party started, and it was 9 p.m. when they reached the garden at Dum Dum. Up to 1 a.m. all efforts to extract a word from the spirit were of no avail, until the most earnest supplica- tion of Baboo Dukhina Runjun, asking for the spirit's blessings, met with the response, "Go with my blessings," uttered in a deep and resounding tone, and seeming to come from the branch of a tree. As soon as the ghost is fonnd more desirably communicative, the public will be duly informed of it. Dr. Sircar, we hear, has been already invited.
