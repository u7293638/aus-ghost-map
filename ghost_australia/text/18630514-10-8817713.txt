THE ILLUMINATIONS. London may be said to have been en fete not only from the 7th of March, when the Princess Alexandra made her public entry), to the night of the 10th, when the marriage was celebrated by illuminations, but for several day s before and after The preparations were in them selves a sort of festival and it was thought that the; expense which had been incurred justified a little further display beyond the one style for which they were designed, so that the principal and most costly illumine turns and decorations were kept up for two or three nights longer During the whole poned the street i continued to be traversed, day and night, by dense multitudes of people, and it was not till the gin) trap judge of the public buildings were finally taken down, that the great thoroughfares resumed their ordinary home a range The illumination of London were of unexampled splendor No such exhibition has ever been witnessed lief etc How much grander it would have been, had it been arranges! upon an uniform principle, must not, however, be overlooked The great fault was that every house and public building illuminated in its own way, without reference to its neighbors, so that the spectacle was broken up by incongruities But London was very grant), notwithstanding, on the night of the 10th of March The only real failure was the electric light at St Paul's, which disappointed the expectations of its friends People thronged at great part of their lives to see a dome of fire, and beheld what the class books on optics call " an oblique period of rays," and a very faint one, too, wandering disconsolately about the dome A single beam of moonlight would have produced a much finer effect. The view from the top of St Paul's was a greater disappointment to the few who were admitted to look upon it than the failure of the electric light instead of being able to see the great fire on the high ground of Hampstead heath, nothing could be discerned further north than Holborn On the South, the view was shut in by the Surrey bank, beyond which all was darkness, on the east the extremity of vision was a triangle of flame over the Royal Exchange, and on the west the prospect was closed by St Clement's Church The view on all sides was bounded by a black wall within this wall was a thick yellow hare, nearer still was a luminous mist, and close under the st miling points was a bright glare, in which the smallest object was distinctly visible The upturned faces of the crowd swaying about like a hell of flowers in a high wind were so clearly seen in such valleys of light is Cheapside and Fleet street, even from an elevation of 200 feet, that the feat miles could almost be distinguished without nil eyeglass One of the great sights of the city proper was London budge The beautiful decorations which had been prepared for the entry of the Princess Alexandra still re m mined, and looked extremely Well under the influence of the illumination, which was produced by v series of small gas lamps placed round the different pedestals which both the Danish warriors and other pieces of scarlet are on each side of the bridge The magnificent inch was lighted up in a similar manner, the lamps running along the cornices and other architectural outlines of the structure o, and presented a very grand appearance, which was greatly heightened by an admirable tanson money on each side Perhaps the triumph of the city was to be found in the combination of the three noble buildings which enclose the open space at the end of the Poultry- the Mansion house, the Bank, and the Royal Exchange The first two were illuminated in the same manner, with jets of gas disposed along the chief lines of the architecture The long facade of the Bank, brought out with a single beam of light, relieved at intervals by huge stars, assumed an air of dignity and repose which it does not possess in the garish day The Exchange was a brilliant success It pediment was also traced with a line of light, and its columns were adorned with illuminated spirals Temple ball was conspicuous for the novelty and spion din of its appearance, transcending all previous at tempts at decoration on former occasions Arrangements, which are said to have occupied a fortnight in the preparation, were made to illuminate a medallion of the Pt nice and Pi mess of Wales, which was placed in the centre of thopnncipalarch, surrounded with flags The entire conduct of the pediment was covered with em blomatical devices in gold, and over the footways angels were placed, holding in their hands sage of orange trees some, above which were tnpod«cinittmginccnso,nmlover the centre and surmounting the whole was a statue of " Hymen" holding a torch The pediments of the air clips were covered with crimson cloth, and over the central arch were the arms of England and Denmark, surmounted with a crown of gold, with the letters " A A on each side Drapery, formed of cloth of gold studded with red hearts, entirely enveloped the front of the Bal on both sides The whole was lighted up with about 120 gas lights, under white ground glass globes, and the effect was very beautiful and chaste Amongst the other public buildings that call for special notice were the British Museum and the Nu tional Gallery The former displayed a magnificent and artistical device in gas, stretching along the centre of the noble line of iron palisades and the latter had an elaborate device on the portico which failed for want of gas, but made some compensation by an electric light, which, however, was not very effective, except when it was turned on the top of the Nelson column, to which the whole height remain tug in perfect darkness, it gave the effect of a sheeted ghost in mill air We may add that there were several electric lights in tho course of the night in different parts of the town, and on the top of the Monument, one air the corner of Ludgate hill, playing on the dome of St. Pauls, and another in Regent street, and the most successful of all from the facade of the Polytechnic Next to the Quadrant, St James s street, Cheapside, fleet street, Bond street, and Pall Mall, were the most brilliant and continuously lighted streets, the Strand, except near Temple Bar, bone broken and irregular An eccentric and ingenious individual in the H ty nutt ket produced dissolving views of the various members of the royal family, which excited great interest in the crowd, the Princess of Hesse developing out of the Pi mess of Prussia with a rapidity which even Mr Dm ram's new species never rivalled the remarks of the gazes upon this exhibition were well and original The wandering crowd invariably called the Princess of Hesse the Princess Bos-), and the Princess Alexandra the Princess Alexandra, accompanied by ejaculations of delight which were taken up and repeated by) thousands at distance who could not see the phantasmagoria it self The club houses were conspicuous for the costliness of then display The political clubs were for once of one accord, while the military and university clubs vied in their efforts to celebrate with splendor the auspicious event of the morning; The tradesmen of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales showed their devotion in over contrary titania of brilliancy Prominent amongst them was Mr Poole his loyal highness's tailor, in Saville place, the front of whose house was literally a blaze of light Thodesignwiis with a cute and fanciful and some of attics thought incongruous and over-done, but it cost great deal of money, and was undoubtedly one of the lions There was also an attic five device at the house of Messrs Swaine and Adoney, in Piccadilly, who have been appointed whip manufac the era to the ounce, and another at the establishment of Messrs Chubb and Son, his royal highness's lock and safe makers Mr Runniel, too, of the Strand ought to be mentioned, who supplied London bridge with incense and the wedding boulton with the essence of violets It but remains to be mentioned that the crowd was prodigious According to the breadth of the thorough fares where the number of lines of carriages in the centre of each street, and the average rate at which they progressed may be set down at about half a mile in four in li vo hours Hundreds of c images were out for five hours and upwards and never succeeded in making their way into any of the leading str out, then occupants get tinglioinoatdaylightwitlioiitscoing anything beyond the outskirts Ihouushouthofflotpnvcmentwu«tremendous But there was a marked difference between the West End and the City At the West end so ice was kept open on one side of each street for carriages to return, and the foot pavement was regulated so successfully that, although in some places the pressure was severe and occasionally dangerous, circulation at a slow rate was at least possible But in the City chaos reigned, and the frightful results are chronicled in the wards of the hospitals, and the verdict of coroners' inquests In the got go at the west end of the country, and in similar spots, the crash was positively applying, the pressure being, moreover, gratuitously increased by a number of "roughs" who kept charging the densely comp acted most out of put of love of mischief We have alluded elsewhere to these scenes, and need not dwell upon them here But it is only proper to add that the conduct of the people, under the circumstances, was admirable, and that when space permitted of easy loco motion the) displayed the utmost patience, decorum, and good butter The rejoicings in the province were on a scale of unprecedented magnificence , nor does it appear that there was a single place which did not testify its zeal by a display of illuminations and by public festivities In Edinburgh the scene was in the highest degree by valiant and picturesque, and the order and safety with which the proceedings of the night were conducted offer a striking contrast to the scene which took place under the Lord of Misrule in the city of London No car tinges were allowed in the streets, and no note or accidents occurred In Ireland the rejoicing went off with characteristic hilarity There were some windows broken in Dublin and Cork, and a disposition was motif fostered by the di logs of the mobs to got up a " row" , but the Queen's pence was not very motel tally disturbed in either place
