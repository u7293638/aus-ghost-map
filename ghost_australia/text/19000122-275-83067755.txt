A MAN OF RESOURCE, Sir John Waters was the most admir able spy ever attached to an army. In the Peninsular War he gave Lord Wel lington the moat accurate and valuable iniormation about the Spaniards and their movements, On one occasion he was taken prisoner by a company of. Spanish dragoons whilo still clad in the English uniform. He was supposed to bo a stu pid Britisher who could not understand a word of Frenoh or Spanish, and his captors oonversed freely before him. He learned from his guards, while riding between them, that they were go ing to kill -and rob him at an old mill where the company was to stop for din ner. Thoy would pretend that they shot him because of his attempt to esoape. On roaohing the mill the dragoonB dismounted and went into tho house, leaving their prisoner outside, in the hope that he would attempt to escape. The instant they were out of sight,. Waters threw his oloak upon a neighbor ing olive bush, and mounted his cocked hat on top. Some empty flour sacks lay on the ground. A moment later the dragoons came out, fired their carbines at the supposed prisoner, and galloped oft', intending to return later to rifle the body, A horse loaded with saoks of flour, stood near the door, and Sir John, still enveloped in the sack, managed to throw himself on the horao's baok, as if it were part of tho load. Tho owner at length came o-it, mounted, and rode away with out detecting tho peculiar contents of ono of the sacks, When far enough away for safety, Waters, finding liis position most un oomfortable, managed to freo himself from the sack, and sat up. The horse man, chancing to look round, beheld the man covered with flour, and took him to bo a ghost perched behind him. Terri fied at the sight, he feU'over in a swoon, and tho supposed ghost thrust him to the ground and galloped off. Sir John reached the English oamp without further adventure, and was warmly greeted by Wellington.
