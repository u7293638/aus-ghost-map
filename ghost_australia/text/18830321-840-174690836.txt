A GHOST LAND LEA.OTJER. Tiih London Daily Telegraph exclaims : — ' A new opponent of ' Saxon rule ' has como to the surfneo in Gal way. Tho ' ghost ' of Mylcs Joyce, ono of tho 5taamtro»na murderers, has taken up his quarters in the county gaol. The fact must be so, since it has been reported, anri, what is more, sent to England by telegraph. To tho Irish, of course, an ordinary ghost, more or li'ss is of no importance ; there arc so many in the land of the Banshee, tho Loprccaun, and ' good people ' without number. But tho pre sentment oE Mylos is a political apparition, who has returned to inako hfo a burden to the au thorities. Now such a transcendental pheno menon is really too formidable. What is to be done ? He, or it, cannot be arrested, held to bail, or imprisoned when ho ' revisits tho pale glimpses of the moon.' Over his intangible visibility the Coercion Act has no power, »nd he takes especial delight in violating the Uurfow clauses. There is nothing for it but to send down the Psychical Society to rea son with him. Tho story goes that ho has already so terrified tho matron and warders that thoy havo app'ied for a transfer to some unhaunted goal. Moreovor, l-e is not iifraid of the armed myrmidons of tho Saxon, for in the shapoof a ' fall, mysterious figure' — tho A.'. scription shows that Mylos has grown in his grave — he not only visited two soldiers on guard outside the prison, but had the temerity to handle thoir rifles. This is most ssrious, since there is more than a probability 'hat ionic stolid Tommy Atkins on duty wi'l, one of t cso nights, test tho nature of the visitnnt, by a Iiouie-thrtisc with the bayonet-. The agitators must bi) hard up when they set afloat such ridiculous gossip among a people prono to Buperstition ; but sinco our (-Joverninent has mana ;ed to oxoreise the demon of Foniunisin, it may fairly be trusted to lay the phantom of an ex'couted'murderor.'
