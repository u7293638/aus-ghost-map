Tee ratepayers of Quarry are naturally anxious thatsomeorihe money contributed by them to the revenue of the city should be_ expended initha improvement of their, locality. - Palmerston-square -is * at present an unsightly waste, comprising worked oat alluvial dig^ngs, and the residents of the Hill are vciy desirous that it should be planted with trees, and redeemed from its ; ragged rand ungainly condition. A movement w$s made to this end some time ago, "and a public meeting vas held, at which resolutions vrere passed affirming the desirability of beautify ing ' this. piece of ground, asserting the rights of the ratepayers of thai portion of Sandhurst to a fair share of attention as re gards improvements, and requesting the City Council to go to a certain reasonable expenditure on their public reserve, known as Palmerston-square.. The representatives of Sutton Ward, in which Quarry Hill is situated, are, we understand, very desirous of getting the wishes of the Hiiliies attended to, and there is a motion on the notice-paper, moved by one of them, to the effect that they should be carried oat. The motion, however, is low dovru on the notice paper, and no opportunity has as yet been afforded for bringing it forward. It is to be hoped ihLs will be done at an early date, for our friends on the Hill are becoming impatient, and the impression is growing upon them that they are being wilfully neglected. Whilst we are willing to believe that this is not the case, we would still submit to the Council that the matter is one demanding a serious consideration. We have been in formed that a petition numerously-signed will be presented to them at their meeting this afternoon, and we have no doubt it will be received with the attention it deserves. The prayer of the petitioners is one of im portance to the population of Quarry Hill, and really ought not to be treated with neg lect. We do not anticipate anything of the kind, but we shall watch the proceeding: with respect to it with considerable in terest. Cp.owiiild Olt.—Owir.g to pressure on oar space, we have been obliged to curtail our leading matter, and hold over some other matter.

Tar School o:-- Hikes.—The vexed Ques tion 2-= to what sum the School of Mines shall pay to the Mechanics' Institute towards the im provement! lately nnished, and for the use of th-j rooms triey occupy, came 0:1 again for dis cussion at the m-:-jting of the council of the Schod of Mines last evening. A letter was from the Mechanics', offering to give a lease of the room now used, and the laboratory, for 100 years, provided the school paid the Mechanics' £60). A iengthy discussion ensued, and it was at length decided, on an amendment moved by Mr. Clark, that a sum of £400 cash should b-i oilered to the Mechanic^' Institute for the buildings occupied by the School oi Mines, and for ground to extend their opera tions, Messr'. Bayne, Vahland, and lloss ieing appointed a sub-committee,to carry out the arrangements. A report of the meeting will be found elsewhere. The Late Mk.
