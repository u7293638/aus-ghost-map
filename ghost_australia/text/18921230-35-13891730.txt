THE SOCIAL DEMANDS INSURANCE COMPANY. (London Times.) "What is the least I can give without Booming shabby it' is a question which many citizens have to ask themselves on the arrival of every post A large percentage of our letters (w o are not speaking of charities) are requests for money, for money to be spent on facilities with which we have no 33 apathy, hut to which tradition compels us to subscribe J bore seems to be a race of bus bodies, for example, who on at for the purpose of getting up testimonials, and medicaments, and memorials they appear to consult the almanac daily and to ask themselves, " V horn "to we 0 tease the public into coming more tiugJ" Almost every day is the birthday, of the cen- too dry, or the territory of somebody A hundred years have passed since Prodgers was born, or died, or published his immortal work " Let us do something" erica the busy body, " for the illustrious memory of Producers " He then consults the " Biographical Dictionary," and finds that Pledgers was born at Little Fulhugton, or died there, of was at school there So he determines to make Little Pedlington a kind of Stratford-on-Avon , he takes into his counsels seven other busy bodies worse than himself, he makes a committee, he writes to the papers, he sends letters to all the conspicuous 3 people whom he can think of , he asks for their namES, and, worst of all, for their men by these things cannot be done without money, and -Utlo Pedlington (which never heard of Prodgers before) is enthusiastic hut does not subscribe A Prodgers drinking fountain is proposed by the temperance people , the local boot seller is all for a Prodgers library (as if any one in Little Pedlington over read a book ' ) a Prodgera museum, containing Prodgora relics,, the walking stick of Pi odgers, his old boots, his quill pens letters to Prodgors, and similar objects is " a 'colt want " Every man of letters is no! end to sub- scribe There is 1 Proctors five-man distinguished expressions of regret are received, the local clergy perforate and all those splendours have to be paid for Then the problem arises, " How little can I give for Prodgers and Ina glory without seeming shabby " " There are thousands of such demands. It is Professor M'tilaahnn's sliver wedding, of his golden wedding, or he is resigning his chair, and some noxious erson decides that M'Glnshan must have a testimonial, or Hint his honorable fe items must be immortalised on canvas or in marble 'the natural a id just thing would be for the enthusiast to put his hand in his own purse and defray the necessary and considerable expenses But that is the last thing of which the enthusiast thinks, he gives his useless time to committees and circulars and a world of honest people who never think of M 61 ishan are asked to subscribe. there is no help for them, subscribe they must, that H'Giasban mar smirk in marble or frown n oils If they hold their hands will they not In thought means, inviting and unfriendly v Yet they have no enthusiasm in the cause Ihowoild has wagged on without statue of Prodgers or a portrait of M'Glashan, and might continue to do so But they have to pay and naturally wish to pay as little as possible, and with the smallest conceivable amount of trouble In addition to those endless and superfluous demands, there is the constant tax of wedding presents. These usually take the form of the sm Best and cheapest articles in silver and ormolu, but there is the trouble of selecting them, and the expense of buying them at record prices To meet all those difficulties, and to lighten the needless burdens of life, the boom Demands In surance Company has been formed. The society, on receipt of a sufferer on graduated according to the income and needs of the members will transact for them the whole business, on the cheapest possible scale The society is not afraid of being called shabby it has 110 corporate delicacy of feeling. Doing a large ready 1001103 business, the society enjoys exceptional facilities for the purchase of silver announcers at a considerable discount, and is thus prepared greatly to reduce the annual expenditure on wedding presents It has established in the ratio of contributions to testimonials of all descriptions A large bankrupt stock of ex engines and decorative o clocks has been secured, and silver weddings can now be arranged for or, satisfactory, jot economical terms in the matter of port at, the society has engaged a staff of impressionists and sculptors ghosts, who will work at low rates jet produce articles which, the society Hatters itself, are calculated to give artistic satisfaction Moreover, a collection of painters'mibtits has been secure 1 on very reasonable terms tiresome portraits rejected in the vanity of the Bitters, and it has been estimated that they can be converted into tolerable likenesses of almost any professors, actors, schoolmasters, generals, musicians, landlords or mash rs of hounds at an almost nominal expenditure Thus commanding the market and until 'lug artistic refuse (that great principle of modern economy the society is prepared to con- c li into the most apparently antagonistic interests, and is equally ready to treat with the organisers of testimonials and with the unfortunate persons who are at present compelled to defray the expenses the society, of course, makes no pretence of being a purely philanthropic affair, but his all the prestige of a pin ing concern The div doubts as the society frankly announces, are earned partly on the life insurance principle inquiries are made into the chnracU r 1919 habits of each member and his list hay to calls for testimonials and memorials is estimated by an accomplished staff of actuaries and accountants Special privileges am allotted to literary persons, who are peculiarly subject to these taxes, and peculiarly conspicuous for lack of adequate means the mutual principle is also taken into account, as any one of the members may con- ceivably become the object of a testimonial or a memorial himself On the principle of lending libraries, epergnes decorative clocks, and similar expressions of esteem ma> to the round among the members, who will thus be robey ed, at intervals not 01113 of those distressing objects but of such wedding presents we are now reserved for the domestic chamber of horrors Those will be removed by the society at stated periods without extra charge, the expenses being defrayed at a kind of clearing-house and by means of said by motion the so here is admirable 111 its simplicity Members (who have paid their subscription) merely send in to the secretary their weekly pile of social maging letters, and have no further trouble with the matter.
