Jack the Ripper. The mysterious murderer known as "Jack the Ripper," whoso crimes in London created such a sensation a few years ago, and who eluded cap ture, is now reported to be dead. He died (says Figaro) in a private lunatic asylum in England unknown to the majority of the public, but his identity was fully established some time before his death. He was a medical student of good family and considerable means, and there is no reason to suppose that when his family first put him under forcible restraint they had any idea that he was the author of the Whitechapel hor rors Two prominent journalists, G. R. Sims and T. P. O'Connor, M.P., are among the few who know the facts of the case. The whole matter has been kept very dark, as it was felt no good end would be served by re-opening the case. The police authorities, however, were aware of the circumstances, and undoubtedly felt relieved when this human fiend gave up the ghost.
