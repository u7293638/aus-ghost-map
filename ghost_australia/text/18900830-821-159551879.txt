W> THE EDITOR. ' Sir—7be reading public will require some thing mote tangible than the "wishy-washy" *ubl&£cftar appearing in the Advertiser on Monday ae » reply to Mr. Bussey'e charge accusing 'your contemporary of journalistic buffoonery and poUticsTjobberyof the most glaring description. Mr. Hussey deserves the' thanks of the community for exposing such a disgraceful partisanship on the.part of a paper , which so often boasts of its numerous oircula-5 tion. Would it be too much toask the Adver fiter in future to confine' its columns to the re counting of "tiger yams" and "ghost Stories," and leave the'discussion of political iand. other important matters'to those papers.. Whose columns are open for the discussion of both sides of the question. It would have been much more to the credit of the Advertiser had it confined itself to reply ing to Mr. HusseyV accusation, and not attempt by an evasion < of the whole matter to throw .out insinuations to the effect that you had been accused of altering a telegram purporting to be the feeling of James town on the political crisis. '. The telegram in question appeared in your columns in the exact form it left the hands of. your .correspondent. The Advertiser makes a big flourish at the end of their article about Mr. Hussey not acting for them in the future, but it is'significant that the misleading statements-originated in Way-' mouth- street, and not at Port Elliot. Jamestown, August! lam. Sir. &e.;, J. H. TOUCHBLL.
