Sydney cch8ey co (FRvost onUR OW CORRESPONDENT.)' THE LATE fisUPRIPE. THE prorogation of Parliament may he fairly considered a surprise, coming, as 'it did, so suddenly, for it is a. fact thab , number of strong Governmunt 'supporters even were not prepared for what is tanta mount to a dissolution so soon. The Government themselves had not made up their minds till the cloventh' hohr? so to speak. In fact, they had anticipited a less determined opposition (although they were! prepared to meet with a good. deal), and they had not properly gauged the weight of. the ememy's guns. Tho broadsides fited from the Opposition during:thes debate on the address in reply, and the later and still msore destructive bombardment'during tihe debate on Mr: Garvan'sa motion sc the Minister for Works, showed the Govern ment that they could do little inthe time. at their disposal with .sdcha harrassing foe. But inore than all,.that which was the real crusher. was the vote of :'cednsu':e,proposed by Sii enoery .Parkes, ,and wvhich, would, have called'forth another. week's or perhaps two weeka' waste of time. ,.Eo the.G v.rn ment .sai the wisdonm of not longer, con tinuing the struggle within the walls of the; Hoti?se. It would hav lu'btrt the remnant of repdtationli for conlmon.? sense left,, to thein to have done so, and thy accordingly detsrmined topprroogue foi a,time suficient to enable thie wits to be issued,and when all necessary arranlgements are made the dissolution will take place Then wil'come the tug of war! TRIE FATE OF PARTIES. Opinions vary as to what the rcsilt of the general elections ?ill be. . There is a concensus (f opinion that the Governinmqut party, as at present conslituted, will :not have the ghost of 'a show, and it is also pretty certain: that the pe'soiicl of the Assenmbly will be largely changd. sd Id other words, there will be ileanynew mem bers, and a good deal' of "fresh 'blod?" wvill be infused into the government of the country. There is a hitrong irlical element ricing to the sirfaed'of the poa tical life of the country, and the fac cannot be overlooked that a rcw order of things is being ushered: in. It seemus reasonable to 'suppoec that Sir Henry Parkes, the veteran statesman' will habve something to.'sayy in the formation of the next Ministry; but there are ndt wanting indications that the people' aie. ge~otin' impalient w th what remains ot the old political life; and bO: thii 'leaders of the next parby in power : who they may, they imust be prepared to accoin modate ihnmselves tona change' in thonght' and felin~g that has been giowioe- very. surely for gome years past,; nd whichl has of late begun to manifest itself in r:eal earnest. Of rumours there are plenty anent the political situation.. A not unprobable idealis ia c ;urse of: circulation, which is given sup port toby the metropolitan paper;, which is said to be subject to Government inspi'a tion, namely, that there will be an attempt to form a. combination ~linistry. It is aih open secret (lot theGovernment deny it ass they will) that'there has been a split in the Cabinet for time past. It is not a happy family. To:begin with there are at least two very strong-willed, not to say stubborn, members ih the Ministry, who are somethinri like t woejuarrelsomp andunfriendly dogsrun ning ina leash. The head of the party, Ioo, is notoriously unfitted to keep it together and to cot)i01ped, or lead his followers in the proper sense. Mr. Farnell again has ipenly shown that he is not in sympathy: with his colleagues on many points, anl has really only one po!iticalamb:tion left,nimely, to rear his child, the Land Bill; till it can fairly wilkl and answer for itsel ' The' result of such wet'nursing of that objec tionable 1 baby' statuteis not likely 'tobhbe satisfactory under any. circumstances, liut that' is at any rate .the last hope of the "Minister' for Lrands. It is probable there fore, as above -suggested, that theld:overo ment party will go to the soantry with the implied 'understandin,. that 'a colition Ministry will be attomptedi : RISING YOUNGME 'I.f Among the aspirants for Parliamentary honours is a M?r.
