Old Country Notes. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, February 3. The watch-night services this year were as numerous as ever in the denominational Churches, but they are gradually, decreasing amongst the Anglicans. St. Albans, as usual, was crowded with a congregation of mostly poor people; but there was not ihe ghost of ritualism in the services. Even the choir was unoccupied, and the service .was in itself, what it is of course in its origin, an imitation of Methodist: services. . Father Stanton, whose popularity as a priest and preacher has never waned, was in the-pulpit. While the people in the East End were returning from their chapels, a terrible tragedy was.being enaoted in the Forest Gate Industrial Schools— o fine set of buildings, in*, which over COO children from Whitechapel and Poplar are .maintained by the parish authorities. The children.were asleep when a fire insidiously crept, up a wooden parr tition on the ground floor of a detached dormi tory, where eighty- four boyB: lay. Of this number twenty-six were suffocated by smoke befoce they could be rescued. The fire itself I Was inconsiderable, and was soon extinguished. | Otherwise the new -year bap opened well. The i usual homilies—ave? been read in pulpit and 'Press, andLfrom a commercial standpoint ; the brightest forecast is indulged in- The very i sanguine are predicting' a . surplus of over £3,000,000. Beyond, doubt industries that hove languished: languish/jno mojev-and money making people are rubbing their hand* at the prospect of }800. , The year is to be a. boomer, and so mote it be, though, fpr that matter, I fancy that thispdor oM country that has been so long going .to the doge, has not been doing so very badly of late. Xheigreateat hopes seem 'to be centred in tho iron, steel, ■ 0001, and allied industries- and the shipbuilders-uatieipatejre morkabletbusiness. -A*'to, the last year,-figures .'show that* the failures of 1889 were a decrease of 5 per oent upon the :pr»vious year, when a decrease also.iappeared.

' ....,/■' The distribution of! .New Year honours has satisfied nobody, least of oil Anglo-colonials. This, in the course of human iiatuJ-e, is never tbe sort of thing thatdoes give general satisfao tion; but there is an: unusual baldness about ; tiie present h'st. Men like myself would naturally begin with the Order of St. Michael and St. George, and look for the name of Queensland. We don't find it. Two Australian Speakers are: knighted, and New Zealand nnd Tasmania get what Queensland gets—the cold shoulder. The home awards are, as might be expected, chiefly political- A satisfactory ex ception is the baronetcy conferred upon Mr. Savory, the popular president of the Royal College of Surgeons. The other, baronetcies are rewards - for money spent upon contested elections. There is a proof of party, gratitude to party journalism in the knighthood given to the proprietor of the Manchester Courier, Colonel T. Sowler—"Tom Sowler" to his Man chester friends. A similar honour was con ferred upon Leng, of Sheffield; but in Bowler's esse there was no ratting. He and his family and tiie paper which they have made a success have ever been true blue. There has been no change in them, and tbe conversion of Manchester to Toryism.was certainly some thing to signify approval of in the usual way. The Tories, as a rule, however, ore notoriously neglectful of their Press, though they ore be ginning to be educated upon that point. Th* friends of Mr. Levy Lawson. of the Daily Tela- graph, ore pnce njtnre d_gtg»te4 tbM he has been loft out, but his time may come yet, long though it has been delayed. Mr. Walters, ojf course, must wait a little too, though there is ft whisper that he iB to be rewarded for all the troubles of the year by a peerage when the Commission Judges have presented their report. Mr. Parnell begins the New Year under a cloud. Captain O'Shea seeks a divorce against his wife, and makes Mr. Parnell a co-respon dent. This is done under circumstances that are suspicious, and that havo been ?üblioly discussed. The allegation of the arnellites is that as there is. »0 difference in the domestio position since 1886, the cose has been instituted at this' particular time in order to injure Parnell politi cally, in order especially to lessen the damages which might be cast against the Times in the libel case that is pending. Tiie Times in large type announced the enteringof the writ, butasno . intimation was given to Mrs. Q'STica and Mi*. Parnell, the lady's solicitor took the unusual step of demanding service, and publishing the; letter at once in the Press. The Parnellitcs in sist that this action is brought simply to be hung in terrorem over their chiefs head, aud that any dodgery must, if possible, be prevented. As, however, the case cannot be heard for some time, Mr. Parnell will hand over the temporary leadership of the Nationalists to Mr. Justin M'Carthy. The intimate relationship between Mr. Parnell and Mrs. O'Shea, whether criminal or not remains to be proved, have been noto rious, and everybody haa wondered why the. action was not brought before. To-morrow brings a chaugc in the Saturday. Review, The conductors of'that once brilliant weekly, oalled not without cause by-John Bright the superfine reviler, hove awakened to the fact that their craft was to be left high and _*y. Hitherto, from the height of their Olympus thoy hove smiled at rivals, and in truth hove seen a pretty fair tale of rivals wreck and go under. Of all tlio papers started to compete with it the Spectator alone remains, and even that is said by Some to have got into, the superannuation stage. The Saturday--Review is henceforth to have a number of short lively notes, to lighten the heavy .cargo'of the.regula tion pattern, and a promise is held out that there is to be life in the old dog yet; There was room for it, and young Kngland of the clever type will bo content to let bygones be, bygones if this advertised pledge of reforma tion be redeemed, The new paper, the Speaker, to be edited hy Mr. Werayss Reid, is of eourse the spur in this business. This venture was evidently regarded '.as more formidable than tinoJteo-miner, .or ihoLnindon Review, nni\ it called upon the old fogies to stir their stumpr*. If preliminary announce ments and-congratulations;, if promises and predictions mean anything, the succe-'a of tiie Speaker Is assured. We shall see. It ia never safe, remembering how many of the most successful ventures of modern days beearae so by an absolute' fluke, to predict what will happen. If only aU the brilliant writers who have.given in thoir names ami eaten the openinir editorial dinner will send in their c:>py, there need be no doubt. J'ut a■■ preliminary flourish of trumpets is oue thing and winning the battle is another. Mr. Wemyss tteid is a good man, exceptionally lucky in the journalistic profession; and sound as a politician. The publishers, Cassell and Co., ore at the head of our .enterprising houses. Tho advertisers are all willing. All this means that favouring gales are blowing for.the new craft which is to be duly launched to-morrow. The Daily Graphic, too, i* to be published to morrow, and the worthy people in Milford- Jano are very anxious about their scheme. Twenty; thousand pounds has been spont upon machinery ' alone, and no expense, no trouble has been spared in all the preparations. There has^ been great diffi culty experienced in obtaining men who are ot the same time artists arid descriptive writers, fori need' not say that the two .gifts, arc not always to be found together-. If the man i«* a good sketcher somebody iu tiie office will; have to rewrite his " copy;''if he is a good.writer somebody must redraw -his sketches. And aa the pinch of the Graphie experiment will be in doing everything rapidly, the experiment that is to be attempted on so large a scale may very well cause some anxiety. . Browning was buried in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, and the poet hud a Bplendid funeral. The homage to liim has been universal, and he worthily lies in a corner sacred to the memory of great and-good men. And yesterday Charles Mackay waa laid in the frozen ground in Kensal Greftn Cett*,*"tory, amidst a great gathering of clans— the literal CRan Mackay, represented by a contingent from Bcotland, and tbe darts artistic,-journalistic, and literary, from the metropolis. I remember once in the Queensland bush a boundary rider who'had left the old country just about the time when Mackay's songs wero at tho height of their popularity. Year*" had passed and tho charaoter of our ballads had changed altogether, but the fashion to him still was " Cheer boys, Cheer," and " There's a good timo coming/' and a very good fashion too. Co wen, and Tosti, and Mar/ial ore oil very well, but boys don't whistle tliem in the streets, and you eould not set an audience in outcry of chorus by starting one of their drawing-room pieces. By his songs Mackay will be best remembered. He wrote a quantity of miscellaneous literature, his best book, perhaps, being his "History of Popular Delusions." At one time he marked well for a foremost plaoe in journalism, but his special correspondence for the Times during the American war was on tho wrong side for the admirers who had learned to look upon him as a ballad writer for the people. We had lost sight of bim in Lon don, where he has never been a personal presence to the young men of the clubs, where he was once well known, for more than ten years. Dr. Lightfoot, tho learned Bishop of Durham, is another eminent man cut down by the Reaper in the lost days of the old year. He was a short, stout, bullet-headed, but most benevolent looking man, who never seemed at home in the House of Lords, in the pulpit, or on the- platform, for he was not an eloquent speaker, and was well aware of. it. The study was his place, and tho amount of work of th* highest orto*-|hich,l*fdtf ) *i^ was simply : prodigious*. ' From Bishops to priseflghtere is but a step, and tbe so-called Australian champion has been a bit of a hero of late, beoause he was the only man who came out with anything like credit in tiie blackguardly affair at Bruges. I cannot remember a prize- fight that has given so much satisfaction to the publio as the scandalous abuse of prizo fighting last week in Belgium, in which, the contending parties were Smith, tho Englishman, and Slaviri, the Queenslander. Had tlio latter- day' revival of boxing matches been anything but a feeder of the. book-making fi-aternity it might havo hod a chance. It was not. It proclaimed itself any number of times during the last two years as a liase imposition. Respectable it nover was, but there was always fair play. Whatever rowdies outside the ring might do, in thc ring fair fighting was thc rule. It is so no longer, and the public, in face of the dastardly rullianism of the ..Smith lot at Bruges, are I 1 think finally sick of the whole thing. The most curious, thing was that what happened was categorically .foretold beforehand. The rascal who hired the 'Birmingham roughs and took them oVei* to ptoVcnt Slavin wjnning the fight was not only Jcnown, but his intentions wore flwfiw-ed.-:-_he sportin-' papers warned. Slavin's friends of what would be done li is a thousand pities that precautions were not. token so that,, if it oame to the point, there [ was not a t'reo fight all round, flavin's be- I haviour was very good., He wa**, of oourse, the | best man twice overhand knocked the other man t 'all to pieces with his knuckles,'as at the. [.public spiirnry*.jujitches he had knocked all competitors with the gloves. But lie gallantly,; : knowing .the murderous gang that were ready for him, went into Smith's comer round after round, and po"Jno"ed, a".vay. -at tile skulking English ,-i-npoctor, though Wows rained upon him, and he was kicked and hnueklcdusted by: . the cowardly herd No wonder that at Dc-vcr and again *hi-Fleet-street when he made, his appearance after"wardH,hdreceived an> ovation, .or that the; Stock Exchange1 nieri, who are not all members'of the Peace Society pi* chapel goers, treated him like a Shah, and whipped Up a purse of three'figures; for hipi. In the ririg 'the'rofereb" lost his head completely. By the; modern, rules,.Smith twice liaicited tiie fight, f and to declare it "a dra*Jr-".was'iuw about 1 adding insult to: Injury. The Pelican Club, tbercforo, as .well as Exeter Hall, and the ordi ,miry.public who piok up a;Jiving between;those extremes, aro unanimous in their disgust; and 'at the pantomimes any reference to thia.djs 'igfacoful. exhibition .is'a' signal for execrations -fcM*' the Englishman, aiid loud .cheers for • 'the Australian.
