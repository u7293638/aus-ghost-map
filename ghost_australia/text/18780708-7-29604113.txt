DR. NEWMAN AT OXFORD. [From the London Times.] After thirty-three years' absence Dr. Newman has lately revisited Oxford. A third of a century, a generation in the life of humanity, has passed away and the worn scholar comes back like a ghost to move among the crumbling buildjpgi?, the cold cloisters and the cow leafless trees of the gardens, where in the maturity of bis manhood his busy spirit was remorselessly driven forward La the pursuit of peace and rest. He has long since found a haven which, if not the best, is, perhaps, sot the worst, for the shelter of weary mortals yet we know with what keenness hie memory retains the history of the conflicts end struggles which preceded his abandonment of the .communion of his fathers. He h&s; himself traced out the progress of growth and change that had its eodjn his recep tion into the Church of Borne. The sim plicity and sincerity of the confessions of fhf ** Apologia " command our sympathies, even when we most strongly renounce the reasoning to 'which he yielded, and some pang of kindred pain is inspired as the narrative reaches its great culminatwn. It was then that Dr. Newman quitted Ox ford, which he now revisits. It is not surprising that he has never borne to see the ancient city in all the years j that have since passed; but -we bope we { may gather from his present visit that for him the fever and the fretr of life fcaj*e ceased. Vivid as is hb memory of Mm former period of unrest, he can go back to the scene of its history wi&out; Jjein-r Ajaer- | iiome fay too disturbing emotions.

Yet we may be sure that in passing through a crisis of "mental and moral tumult the feeling: of beauty is thrown into the background, even though it cannot disappear, and Dr. New- J man's last experiences of Oxford' were so; largely mixed with pajn as to nullify die force of its fascination.'

Nor did he quit the place only. He cut himself asunder from friends and fcilow workers, from pupils and disciples to whom, .his departure was a great consternation. Some of them followed their master and friend into the Church of Rome, but by far the greater number of those who had hua? upon his words at I jttieniore and in St. Mary's started back from the chasm that appeared to be opening at their feet, and remained permanently estranged from him. And now there at* few, v«*ry few, left tv prove by their reception of Dr. Newman that the communion of friendship is liefeper-*.* .iam^iix* of divided ■ Churches. .The Society of Trinity maybe paid to hare drawn him back to Oxford, for, mindful of the fact that in the earliest years of his academical career he was a scholar of their -bourn, they elected bim -at Christmas to be an rto?onrj Fellow, and his runt to tire Umveniity was,' as it were, ■ taJrine-up of the freedom of. bifttew^ositip?.
