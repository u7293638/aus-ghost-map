THE "CORNER'S" LAST MAN. A VERY DISTANT RELATION OP " CAJUPBELL/s. Stump oratory shall live no more, Great Don must modest grow Before the " Corner" cocks presume, With * iieads * erect to crow. * * I saw a vision from my lair, Cr^ep haggard down the Assembly stair, And disappear from sight. I saw the last of Woods and Gray, 1 heard the last of Barton's bray Bing changes thro' the night. The gas lights gave a sickly glare, The House was thin and cold, The skeletons of Land Bilis hung, Festoon-like from the mould, Yet spectre speakers life-like stood, Saying— I most reluctantly withhold from an anxious public the exact words of the speakers. It may, however, be satisfactoryIto Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Michie, whose shadows I once saw, to know that the general effect of their exhortations, was an earnest request to the inhabitants of the " Corner," to retire again, while they stall cpuldytD a comparatively decent obscurity. They concluded an ^eloquent address by expressing an opinion that, the country wpuid not, by reason of the deprivation, collapse but that it would live In green and gold, In some where known ]to fame, By him recalled to place,'' Who captive led poor Heytesbury Who Richmond robb'd of victory, And others of their race. The speakers then gradually sank through their respective pillars, One who retired hear the reporter's gallery was heard to whisper to the ghost of Punch— ' • * ' • If such as you would hold them up To ridicule and scorn, I guess they'd take a parting And wish they'd ne'er been born. Go tell the country and the press, Thou saw'st the last of Barton's race On Legislative floor. ; ' " Go tell them that the game is dene, The " Corner's" course at last is run. Their * hopes * of place * are o'er. * * : I live in mould, 'Neath the ^arth so cold, It's darlf pnd bare, In iny lonely Jair, Yet'l^it uplate, O'ertheBoolcofFate, - And I strive to see in fiiturity, J Some record of greatness and purity.
