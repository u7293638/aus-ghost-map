SATURDAY, JUNE 7, 1884. On the 29th ult. a woman rejoicing in the euphonious name of Frances Anne Payne, was charged at the Dongarra Police Court with having stolen five tweed shirts from the bar of Mr. Linthorne's hotel some time between the 8th and 13th of last May. The case was dismissed. This evening Mr. John A. Liddelow, the Hay-street Confectioner, will have on view in his show windows two highly-decorated bride cakes, one of which is what is termed ! a three-decker, and stands about four feet j high. Both are most tastefully got up, and i reflect great credit upon the manufacturer, j About three months ago a man named Alexander Thompson left Mr. Morrissey's j station (Mount Erin), to make his way to | another place. Since then he has not been heard of, although his ' swag' has been piclced up in the bush. It is supposed that he has died from exhaustion and exposure, as he was in a very debilitated state of health when he was last seen. An unusually large number of deaths have occurred throughout the Colony dur ing the past few weeks, among them being many old and worthy colonists. We regret to have to add to the already long list, and to record the loss of another old identity in the death of Mr. R. deBurgh, of Cavershaui, Swan district, whose demise took place at his residence at an early hour this morning. We regret to hear of the death, early this morning, at North Perth, of Mrs. Armitage, the widow of a military pen sioner. Deceased was well-known through out the City as an accoucheur, and had only within the past few days returned from Jarrahdale, where her professional services had been availed of. Mrs. Armitage was known for some time past to have suffered from an affection of the heart, but it was not thought to be of so serious a nature as to cause immediate alarm. She was much respected and leaves a grown up family to mourn her loss. In an article published in the Journal of the Anthropogical Institute, Mr. Howitt gives the following summary of the belief of Australian natives : — ?' All the tribes believe that the earth is flat, and that the sky is propped up on poles. Beyond the sky is the gum-tree country, the home of spirit and ghost. Every man has within him a 'yanibo,' or spirit, which can leave his body and wander even to the gum-tree country and talk with the spirits there, or converse with the wandering ghosts or other sleepers. The state of departed souls and their doings after leaving the body fill the great part of Australian mythology. The dead are buried doubled ud. the bodv lyins on the side, and the usual deposit is made of the personal effects of the deceased/' In its issue of to-day our City contem porary endeavors to throw dust in the eyes of its readers by misinterpreting the private telegram despatched from Mr. Hordern to his agent in Perth on Thursday last, and unwarrantably raising a doubt as to whether the contract for the Beverley Albany railway is even now signed. The despatch to His Excellency the Governor from tho Secretary of State for the Colonies, published in our issue of yesterday, merely suggests that in Mr. Hordern's opinion this Colony should compensate the lessees, &c;, &Ci;) ? a baffliDg side-wind which, consider ing that his telegram positively asserts the contract is ' settled,' is too far-fetched to be worth the Herious consideration of any intelligent person. Yesterday the remains of Corpl. Thoa.

The) guarantees given by subscribers are onlj^pifai neriod of five years, but their is litt^doubt^hat at the end of that time means' of {cdntinuing the professorship will be sought aod found.

His Excellency finds from his experience in South Australia that there is no small amount of latent talent, and it must be acknowledged, from the manner in which some recent composi tions, signed ' W. C. F. Robinson,' have been reviewed in the musical press, that he is entitled to be regarded as a good judge. The endeavor to raise the standard of taste and skill in the Colony will be greatly facilitated if the services of a thorough musician be obtained, and as the amount raised for the salary is not more than .£540, it becomes an object to find how this income can be supplemented. Presumably, as the Professor of Music will be called upon to examine for degrees and certificates, he will not be allowed to take private practice as a teacher.' ?
