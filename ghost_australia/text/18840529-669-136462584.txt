Geology. On Wednesday evening, Mr. Pentecost lectured on "Geology." The attendance was larger than on the previous evening, and Mr. Turner again presided. The lecturer spoke for about an hour, dealing in a most interesting manner with the whole of his subject, and being repeatedly applauded. At the close of the lecture a vote of thanks was heartily accorded to Mr. Pentecost, on motion of Mr. Biggar, seconded by Mr. J. G. Keegan, who congratulated the School of Arts upon now having done for it by Government what long since should havo been accomplished by the community â€” namely, the formation of classes for the instruction of technical subjects. Some time ago he exerted himself with a view to have such classes estab lished, but found that although he was prepared to join, the School of Arts would not, as they appeared to think there was a nightmare or ghost or something of that kind in connection with the institution. Several gentlemen gave in their names as can didates for a geological class. Mr. Pentecost, meanwhile, had to leave, in order to proceed to Sydney by the mail coach, which he was only just in time for at the upper end of Smith street.
