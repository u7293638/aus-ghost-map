THE CATHOLICS AND THE STATE SCHOOLS. ABDRESS BY DEAN KENNEDY. Oa Sunday afternoon the Arohbishop of Adelaide, Dr. O'&eily;, performed the blessing of the new boys' school of St. John the Baptist at Healer Park. Thebartca. Tbe building is of galvanized iron, lined vith matchwood and seaweed, of dimensions 40 ft. by 27ft. The cost of tJ» structure, including furnishing and fencing, was £199 7s. 10d., and the cost of the land, inclnding interest and transfer, totalled £205 13s., so that the total expenditure was £104 19*. lOd. The receipts, inclnding proceeds of sale the old school, were £271 13s. 10d., which left a deficiency of £138 6s. Before 3 on Sunday afternoon th* members of th* Guild of St. John th* Baptist Total Absti nence Sooiety marched in procession to the strains of the Guild Bind from the Queen of Angels' Church to th* schoolroom under the th* leadership of Father Healy. In the schoolroom those on the platform included the Arohbishop, Dean Kennedy, Archpriest Kevin. Father* Healy, Murphy, and O'Neill, aad Messrs. O'Loughlia, M.P.,and Hourigan, M.P. There was a very large attendance, the room being uncomfortably full. Dean Kxsszdy, after congratulating the priest and the people of Tbebarton on the good work they had began that day, and referring to th* great help rendered to Father Healy in the undertaking by Mr. Turner,said during tbe apostolio ages and up to and in cluding tk* fifteenth century Europe was Chriatua in it* laws and iastitatioBS, the young wen trained aad educated by being first taught the principles of religion, whioh became a part of their coastitntion, bnt in the sixteenth century cam* a rupture. The Christian mould, in which Christians had been cast, was broken, and a Pagan mould took its place. That Pagan mould bad not j*» been broken. In this colony, if they allowed their ohildrcn to be brought up ia the State schools, tnese children ware cast, not in a Christian mould, but in a materialistic mould. The principle* of the State schools were suoh as to make the Christian religion despised. Th* Catholic* of Australasia would never allow their children' to b* educated in these schools, whareis was almost a crime to mention the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Theyhad to eduoate not only the intellect but tbe will aad tbe heart. The intellect wa* instrnoted in some degree in the State sohools, bat what was there to eaabl* a child ia the State school* to control his will or to form his heart? Th* intellect wan edu cated at the expense of th* will and tbe heart, and they bad an intellectually educated monster. Quoticg from offioial sources th* . average daily attendance in th* State schools of th* colony daring tbe year was S7.886, and these cost tbe State to instruct for the year a total of £132,440 8s. lid., made np thus:— Primary education, £123.577; expended oa building*. £8.240 18s. 6d.; and advanced schools, £622 10s. 5d. This meant about £3 9s. 4id. for eaoh child in daily attendance daring tbe past year in Sooth Australia. Those who had merely passed through the schools were given at 57.986, and each of these cost to instruct £2 5s. 8d. The Catholics of the colony were about one aeventh of the entire populatieo, and one seventh of the amount quoted came to £18,920 1*. 3d., which amount would almost clear off the Diocesan debt in on* year. If they got their proper share of the Government grant very few of their children would go to the State schools at all. In the Archdiocese of Adelaide they had in th* Catholic soboola 3,810 ohtldren. and in the Port Augusta Diocese 1,038 during last year. Tb» was roughly one- twelfth of the whole number of children going to the State school*, and one- twelfth of the total expenditure on educa tion by the State amounted to £11,036 14«. What could tbe colony boast of after spending so mush money on a system of education which was abhorred by Catholics ? Tbe only way to remedy the state of affairs was for every man and woman to see that their names were on the electoral roll of the colony, and to do all that they could to return those candidates who were in favour of doing justice te the Catholic*. It was only whet* it had been impossible to build Catholio schools that Oatbolio children went to the State schools. Th* Government were enttiac down th* salarie* of Civil servants, which were too low already ; but why not do away with this terrible expanse of £132.440 odd? Tb*r* wa» not much in th* argument that other de nomination* would want grants if the Catholics got one, for from appearances the Anglioanv, for instance, were satisfied with the State-school system, and though richer than th* Catholics were not making the sam* affort to build school*. All that bad b**a advanced against the Pagan schools applied with equal force against the Government system of education established In this province. Th* present system, as by law established, had been in existence for several years, and were the results at all com mensurate with the heavy outlay incurred in its escabliehnMBt and support? Moat cer tainly not. It pleased no one except the eecularisU, or rather th* das* who denied the existence of God and His divine revelations. Was th* moral condition of th* people im proved by it? It was notions: since they read of a nwetiag bavins; beea held ia the Town Hall, at whioh representative ministers of the various religions bodies ia th* city took part, for tbe purpose of inducing cur legisla tors to enact morbstriogeat lawsagainstcartain vices which he would not mention. He could not think the Holy Ghost had much to do with the- system or its principal abettoi a. It would have been better .or tbe colony were half the money which was and ia being lavished in establishing and supporting this iniquitous system of education expended in developing its material resources, aad th* other half handed over to tho** wbo*o proper business it was to look alter the eduaatioa of tbe people. Were thi* done we should not now bav* to witness th* scenes of poverty and destitution, not to aay vioe, which met us at every turn. He found in Prussia, where a system of educa tion similar to ours was fins enforced and rigidly carried out the secular plan had been long ago abandoned. At first the statesmen who directed this important work believed that secular education was tbe only plan by which they oould overcom* th* difficulties caused by religious differences, and the public schools were made purely undeno minational. Them for a time the teachers were ohosea in equal proportions from the two religions— CaihoUo and Prntrstant and tbe schools were called 'simultaneous.' This, it was hoped, would put a stop to jealousies. It did so, ia fact, bat is was fooad when the teachers war* prevented from giving religious instruction that a fatal indiffe rence to all religion was the consequence. Freethinkers would nc doubt bail thia result a* a sign of hopeful progress, indicating to* advent of a sort of religious unity by the exclusion of all religion. But tbe Prossiaa Government did not think so. The men at the head o! the Educational Department clearly saw the deplorable effeots of forgetf ni- nes* of God aad the claims of conscience. This state of mind soon manifested itself by th* abaeace qf all respeot for authority, and the wide spread of revolutionary theories and secret Sooietiesand evergrowing scandalous immorality. As early as 1822 the Minuter Von Alleastein ia the Cabinet rescript for that year, April 27, oalliag attention to this state of things, gav* expression to his views in favour of a return to denominational educa tion. 'Experience ha* shown,' h* said, ' that in these secular schools tbe chief matter of education is not sufficiently cared for, and it lies in the nature of the cat* that it cannot be.' Speaking at a later period he said, 'The time which has elapsed since 1848 appears to have wrought a general conviction among all practical men that the denominational school is tbe only school that is at present possible in Germany.' The Government ia coat*-' quence obanged its system and established sohools whet* Catholics aad Protestants might be taught under tbe dixaotion* of their respective pastors. The elementary schools in Prussia had beea for nearly thirty years purely denominational. If the school was for Catholics the teacher* w*c* Oatholio and to* books Catholic. If the school were Protestant the books and teachers were Protestant. Surely it was no insult to our legislators in South Australia to ask them to follow th* example of Germany in this. Time did not permit him to place before them the sad effects result ing from secular education, so-called, in Franc* and America, Those who wished to learn more about it were ad viced to read a little work entitled ' Pablio School Education,' by the Rev. M. Muller. In conclusion he called th* attention of our legislators to the Epistl* of St. Paul to the Romans, first ohapter— ' And as they liked not to have God in their know ledge God delivered them up to a reprobat* tease,' 4c Tbe Ahcbbisho? heartily congratulated th* Catholics of Thebartoa oa tbe faot that a building was finished in which the education of th* little ones of th* district could be attended. to. Although tb* bmldiog was ?mall it was Beat. He quoted tbe words of a famous Cardinal— 'If on* generation pulled down the Catholic schools tbeaext genera tion would pull down tb* Churches— in sup port of his assertion that th* school question was the question of questions for Catholio* all the world over.
