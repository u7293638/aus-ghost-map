V.A.T.C. STEEPLECHASE MEETING. IBv Teleerarjh. I Melbourne. Autrust 16. The Victorian Amateur Turf Club Steeple chase Meeting was held at Caulfield on Saturday, and although the weather was broken it was well attended, the crround returns being 30 per cent, better than they were at the last Grand National day. The Governor was present. In the Grand National Steeplechase Minerva, who looked a mere pony amongst the steeplechasers, broke one of her fore legs above the knee and will probably be destroyed. This would have been done on Saturday but for the fact that the mare was insured for £400 two days before the race in the Australasian Live stock Insurance Company, and it was neces sary to have a veterinary surgeon's certificate as to her uselessness before she could be shot.
