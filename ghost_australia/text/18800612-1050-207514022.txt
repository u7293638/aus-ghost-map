Over against all this, however, there is something more to lie added of the wonder ful' Mary of Pazzi. Mary could not boast of pigeon8coming tb visit hex. 'She knew nothing of pigeons perching on her right shoulder.

Chapter IX.— May 2Gth. The story is now about ", Philip de Neri," the patron- saint of Cardinal Newman, and the one, therefore, in the calendar, who receives the homage of our colonial friend, Mr. Dalley. , The pervert Newman, and his flatterers Dalley, B&dham; and Vaughan, . deserye , .to ,,be remembered on the ,26th May. On that, day they give special thanks :for. the -life and labours— the his-, tory and miracles of Philip de Neri j and 1 what is, -here: said of. him? Oh, that he was very fond of " fasting " according to the : rules and commandments of the Church. "Such was the abstinence of -Pbihp de Neri that he often remained - three days fasting, intent upon watching and prayer." " He was in the habit of passing the whole night in the contempla- , tion of sacred things at the cemetery - of Calixtus." Again; Philip de Neri was' so smitten with the love of God that he : continually, . languished, - and , ; his heart boiled with, such ardour, that when . it. could , not be contained within its boun- daries, the Lord wonderfully enlarged his heart by breaking and ; elevating two. ribs !" AgauV; Philip de Neri, while performing mass, or praying with much fervency, waB lifted up in tJte air and appeared with a wonderfui light round about him." Again. - This Philip do Neri, " always preserved his virginity, inviolate ; - and knew those . who practised, purity; by their sweet smell ; but those who acted, otherwise from their bad smell." Again,-' This Philip de Neri — " haying fallen into ;a pit was at the same time delivered, by -an i angel j lie was fre- quently honoured by the appearance, of the ! blessed Mo ther; herself, y and he saw the souls of. rnanyj ascend ,;up; to .heaven;, sur--. rounded ,by splendour;" - ..,i;f Now, is not: all this most 1 edifying reading?- Think-of ;;Father Sheridan and ' Father .'ForrestlandDivVaughani: face- "to1 faice,- with , each' other,1 reading devoutly this ; trash, .audi believing it, and feeding their souls on it! uPhilip'was a most' holy man.
