PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. WEDNESDAY, OCT. 15. The SPEAKER took the chair at half-past 4 o'clock. BENALLA COURT HOUSE. In reply to Mr HALL, Mr. KERFERD said that the Benalla Court-house, which was recently compared by Mr Justice Williams to a barn was erected in 1864 as a court of petty sessions. A jury room was added in 1878. Benalla had only within a comparatively recent period been appointed an assize town, and the de- partment had received no communication informing them of the insufficiency of the court for the additional work transacted in it. He would consult the Solicitor General as to the desirableness of increasing the accommodation. Mr GRAVES remarked that when he gave notice of his question on the same subject for Thursday he was not aware of the ques- tion of the hon member for Moira. THE CONVICT O'BRIEN. Mr. GAUNSON desired to call attention to the ease of the man O'Brien, now under sen- tence of death for murder. The counsel for the convict thinking that there should be an appeal to the Privy Council, prepared a peti- tion, to which he desired to obtain the signature of O'Brien. The prisoner's solic- tor, on presenting himself at the gaol for the purpose of getting the convict to sign the petition, was denied access. B) what authority waa this request denied9 He naked the Attorne) General to lay on the table a copy of the opinion ot bir Br)un OLoghlen with reference to the right of ap peal to the I'm) Council in such cases and nlso a cop) of the bohcitor s letter on the same subject. Ile would c,ive notice of mo tion for the production of the papers if the Government would allow it to go unopposed, but if not, lie would move tile adjournment of the House tomorrow, in order that the whole question, as one ot principle, might be discussed It the Attorne) General could Bee his way to give an answer to morrow, he would not pursue this course Mr. KERFERD stated that the manage- ment of the gaol was under the control of the Chief Secretary's department. Th e fact of the petition not being signed by the convict did not affect its practical value. If it was signed by the attorney only it would be re- ceived just aa ii the prisoner had signed As to the request that the opinion ot ¡Mr Br)an O Loghlcn should be laid on the table, he thought that perhaps the wa) for the lion member to pioceed would be bv wa) of an address to tlie Governor, as it was in the custod) of the I \ecutive Council He had not }ct seen the solicitors letter If ad dressed to him it would no doubt roach Ina banda to monow It addressed to the Governor Ilia 1 \cellenc) would no doubt forward it to hint on his leturti from Y\arr nambool He hoped that the lion member would not move the adjournment it the House to morrow on tina subject- the exercise of the prerogative of mere) b) the Crown lins was burelli a kind of sub ject that the House had ever discussed (Cries ot "Oh, ) es ) It was rcall) a question of construction of law, and, bo far as this aspect of the cuse wns concerned, it had been iully considered airead) (Heur, heat ) Mr SERVIC] -Mr M'Kean the prisoner s solicitor, called at ni) oflice on Monda), and complained ver) strongly tint he hau been denied access to the prisoner, and wanted to know under what regulations he had been so deine 1 I told lum that he hail come to tilt wrong department-that he ought lo have gone to the Clnel Sicietirv Mr M'Kean pointed out that it was a casi ot life and death, ond his non access to the convict might result in a wa) that would be vet) un sattstactor) I then advise! linn to _o to the under secretar) vv ho, in Mr Herr) a absence, would no doubt tell lum vv hat course to a lopt ile did not e,o, but continued to remark on the improprietv ot being excluded from the _aol 1 said, "1 cannot tell )Ott I know nothing about it, but I shall accept the peti tion Bigned b> )ou just us if tt were signed bv the pi isoner 1 immediate!) bent a note to Mr Wilson, aslune, under what cn cutiibtnnccs Mr Magee, the governor of the L,»ol lind denied Mr M Kein admittance mid I re ceived a note luck to the ellect that Mr M Kean h ul applied for admission, but vv is told that the feoveinorot thtgiol ivas not the proper person to applv to I he sherill, he was mlornied, was the onl) peison who could i,iv e uuthorii) to see the prisoner, as the prisonei was in Ins custody from the time that he was condemned to death Mr M Kean did not tell mt all this when he waited on me, and I had to find it out afterwards He mie,ht just as well have gone to Mr Cill to ask for an ordei to see the pusoner, for Mr Magee had no mort , authortt) to grint it than the police ningis trate 'Hie pusoner, however, was in no wa) ^injured by Mr M'Kean s being denied tccess H would bens well lor the lion member for ¿outh Melbourne to have possession of all the papers, at all events oi all the autho rities, bealing upon the case before sub nutting the matter to the House so that if tho House does détermine t > discuss it he ma) have full lnfoimatton (Heir hear ^ PRIN1ING C0MMU1LE RLPORI' Mr LAURENS brought up the first report of the Printing Committee prill in\T PI IllIOX Mr OTTICrR presente 1 a petition from tilt Borough Council of II imilton in favour of the Koroit line 1 ein_ m i le to join the Ararat line at Hamilton instead of at Dun keld JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

A break of gauge was an evil, but a very much smaller evil than that of being unable to get produce to market at all. Lines of 2ft gauge would cost less to construct and would be very much more economical for rolling stock than the heavy broad-gauge lines. The railways of the colony should be divided into three systems. The first should be the trunk lines and the second produce lines in level districts. In the estimates submitted by the Minister of Railways several of the proposed lines were classified. In one class the Moe to Narracan line was included with such lines as those from Lubeck towards Banyena. Murtoa to Sheep hills, Shepparton to Dookie, and others, some of which were over flat country. But the Moe to Narracan line was over mountainous country. The cost of this particular class of lines was, in the preceding ????cslim tes submitted to Parliament, put down at £2,185 per mile but in the last estimates at £2,485 per mile but in the last eatmiatea it was £???? per mile.

SERVICE.— There would be trouble with the customers. Mr. WOODS.— In some districts the roads were so bad that they were useless to the settlers It would be far better ior the settlers to have trains running for the nc\t 10 or 20 )iars at lreight tram speed as m 1 urope and America than to have no rail ways at all. Again, why should the railways be fenced in and gatekeepers be posted at every mile ? The gates cost £60,000 per annum and if that charge could be reduced to £15 000 per annum the railway freight could be materially reduced. Besides the annual charge of £60,000 there was the first cost of the gates and cottages. The gatekeepers lodges cost £100 per mile, and stations £500 per mile. They did not fence country lines in some of the other colonies. Mr. GILLIES.-- They do in New South Wales and New Zealand. Mr. WOODS.-- Lines were not fenced in South Australia, lhere were many prece dents for leav ing the lines unlcnced H hy should we udhere to the idea that ruilvv aya ou_ht to be neeessuril) different irom com mon roads ' H as it necessary that lines to carry produce should cost £5.013 per mile' Old passen_er carriages could be used for some of these country lines Mr GILLIES-Why did you not do all this ' Mr WOODS-Hie proper question was what ought to be done now An individual Minister could not always do what he liked Ci oss countr) lines to unite different s)stems would fucihtate the transfer of roi ling stock and be very useful on thutground It was a pity that we had not adopted the 4ft. 8½in gauge, the gauge of the world, but we could not help ourselves now, and the present gauge was not a bad one. On the No 2 linea the time tables could be so arranged that the speed should be reduced, and it Bhould be borne in mind that it was the Bpeed and not tho deadweight on the rails that killed light lines As to the No 3 lines, it was nccesatirv that we should adapt our system to the countr), or the country would have to go without ratlwa)s lake tlie case of the country about Harrietville, in Gipps Land which promised to be the future gold field of the colony, and was rich in minerals, soil water, and climate. A hundred acres of some of the land there would be worth 500 or COO acres on the flat country below, and how acres on the flat country below, and how was this district to be reached with a 5ft 3in gauge railway ? The line would have to run along the almost vertical sides of the moun- tains, and the engineers would have to go 50ft or 60ft up before they got the necessary cutting for the shelf along which the line could be run. A broad-gauge line could never be carried through these mountains, and we might with advantage notice the experience gained on the Dharjeeling line. That line was 2ft. gauge and one of the gradients was 1 in 18. There were no sta- tions and the footboards of the carriages were within 5in or 6in. of the ground, and the train could be entered at any point. There were no doors to the carriages, and the passengers had to take care of themselves. Anyone taking the outside seats of the carriages could look down precipices of 2,000ft. or 3,000ft., and sometimes appeared to he actually over- hanging a precipice. This railway was worked by a private company, and returned a profit of 7½ per cent. The same sort of country as that through which this line passed existed in Gipps Land, and why should it not be adopted there ? It would involve enormous expense to make cuttings 16ft wide necessary for a broad gauge line, while a 2ft. gauge line would only require a cutting 6ft wide. He knew that there was a mountain railway line at Festiniog, in Wales, of only 1ft. 11½in. gauge, and upon this an immense quantity ot minerals were carried. If our engineers said we could not adopt this class ot line in Gippa Land, they should make way for others who would carry out the work, lie was quite prepared to admit that a break of gauge caused great inconvenience, but to what extent had the break of gauge between Mel- bourne and Sydney been complained of ? (Hear, hear.) The greatest inconvenience was caused by the shifting of the load, especially in the case of live stock. In deal- ing with cattle, the difliculties might be re duci d by liai ing long narrow trucks on double bugies, HU that they would carr) us many heatl us the broad gauge ttucks Double bogies both lor engines anil carriuges should be adopted on the murow guuge lines, bo far as the transfer ot goods was con- cerned, the arrangements now made on the intercolonial line worked smoothly, lie did not know th.it the slightest notice would be taken ot an) suggestions he made, although w hen he tia\elled with other bon. members along the IJhaijeehng line, which went up to the highest known station m the world, 7,'lOOtt. uboxethe lexel ol the sea in the Himalajas, he thought it possible to in- duce the Government to seriously consider the question of introducing the same class ot line into the mountainous portions of this colon). Ile asked the House to seriousl) look at the question, and, if necessar), take it into their own hunds, and pass a resolution atliiming the necessity ot extending railway communication to Clipps Land on this narrow gauge s) stem. Narrow gauge lines could bo run at lur less cost than broad gauge lines. Tile rolling stock and the whole ot thu equip- ment would be much less expensne, the engines costing onlj £1,500 instead of about £2,000, and the trucks£70or£S0insicnd of £150. Light lines should be constructed to places w here roads could not be mude, lie ga\ e the Government every credit for what the) had done, but he wanted them to do still more. (Hear, hear.) Theie was not a single line m the bill to which ho Bhould object, olthough ho might lune some suggestions to oller in committee on mntteis ul detail. He believed, with the lion, member lol Brighton, that it wua scarcely possible to make lines in the wrong place m tins colon), because in many parts the railwu)s must take the place of the common roads, and wipe out that cllete s)stem altogether In his opinion at lenst .100 miles of railway ahould be added to the linea already in the bill, 200 miles of broad gauge lor the Hat countr), and 200 miles of the narrow _tt gauge lor Gipps Lund be tween the coast and the North I astern line I he lines could be built and equipped for £2 500 a mile and they would open out a fine fertile countr), rich m climate rich in timber nell in evci)tlung that nature could bestow and lacl ing onl) the means ot communi cation with the mirkets of the world to settle that part ot the colon) with an industrious nnd thnft) popiilition (Hear hear) then again, it would be better to tal c powers to borrow a large sum ot moni y SUllictent tor the requirements of the ne\t 10 years than to go peddling to the London market tune atter time tor paltry loans (Hear heir) Hie Government ot New South Wales were borrowing on a smaller popula lion the mono) they neede 1 to can) out a more comprehensive scheme of railwi) con Btruction than that of oui own Government and if we adopted a símilar course, it would save a very heavy percentage on the lines constructed, because tho iciuisitc plant and the trune! labour would be 1 opt in the colon) and not se lttereil to the four winds as was the eise in 187b 7 whenveiy little rail wa) construction wasgoin" on Any place in Gipps Lind could be reached b) the 2ft gauge uni the ibjeettons to hann., two gauges were as nothing computed with the loss incurred through the lack of railways in many parts of the colony.

The House ought to know whether it was contemplated to recust the )nrd on the old lines As to the item of £225,000 for work- shops and tools, money could not be expended in n better way. Then thare was the item of £100,000 for "nddilional accommodation for croods traffic at Melbourne " These estí- mate-a were altogether too bald. Amongst the other items was £73,000 for a viaduct in ¿"linders atreet A previoua departmental estimate was £00,000, and now £13,000 more was asked for what would be a worse struc- ture. The officers of the department might run to South Australia to get copies of bridges they were incapable of designing, but this viaduct was a special matter. Mr. GILLIES-I thought jou were not going to aay an) thing about the olficera. Mr. BENT.-These plans wore done out- side. Mr. WOODS would like to see the previous and present designs submitted to the judg- ment of impartial engineers. What was the use ot this connexion now that the Govern- ment were proposing to construct the outer circle, by which the Cuppa Land trafile would be diverted' The auburban S)stem was only paying 1J per cent Was it necessary to incur this ey. ti ii enormous expenditure for about 40 chains of a viaduct? 'Ihe via- duct was originally projected when the outer circle was not contemplated Tho ¿'Undera street station could not accom- modate moro passengers than at present. By sinking out this item, money would be saved foi constructing the trunk coal line from Grifliths Point to Kilcunda. In conclusion, he had to thank the lion, member for Brighton for the manly wa) in which he had alluded to a gentleman who had been in fumoualv treated-he alluded to Mr. Robert Ford. To that man the colony owed more for designs for cheap railwa)S than itowed to all the other men in the department put together. He thanked the hon member for Brighton for having done that gentleman some tardy justice Mr. Kord had beer, his private friend for the last quarter of a cen- tury, and he (Mr. Woods) believed in stand- ing up for his friends. Mr. Ford was an ill used and misused man, und-there waa no engineer of construction in the colony equal to him, and, as regarded cheap railways, the colony owed him a debt of gratitude.
