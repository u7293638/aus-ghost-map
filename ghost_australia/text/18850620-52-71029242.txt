Tlie Tragedy of Featherstone Br B. L. F*BJKON. Anther of " Grif," " Blade of Grass," " Joshua Marvel," &c; CHAPTER XXrV.-THOMAS MATTIE'S LIOAOT. It was on the evening of this day that a series of;very surprising circumstances, in which our old friend Thomas Mayple and his orafty em ployer, Thrifty Miller played the principal parts, came to an astonishing culmination. Sinco the thrashing'in the publio streets which Thrifty Miller had received from Riobard Freeman, the scheming usurer had kept himself particularly [uiet. There were good and sufficient reasons for his partial retirement /rom Bociety. In the first place, Freeman had dealt out**his punishment with such a heavy hand that, after it was administered, it was aa muchas Thrifty Miller could do to creep home and plunge into bed, where he lay groaning from pain. In thia condition he waa found by Thomas Mayple, to whom he related what had occurred, describing it as a savage and unpro voked assault, for which he intended to ruin his assailant. A single night's reflection, however, led him to the conclusion that it would be the wisest course to take no steps whatever against Freeman, and he contonted himself/therefore, with the indulgence of idle vaporings in the pre»1 .*enop of his confidential clerk. In the seoond place¿ when he waa able to get about, he was re ceived with so .much disfavor and aversion that he'waa glad tb "escape from'-'the "scowling looks and^open^tbreatenings of those who had hi therto been civil tô him through fear. The truer story of* his villainy'had become known, and there were manyfreàdy to add to' We /ôhastiselmentLhe hadjalready'received, and thutí'paV off bid "scored; Notj only " were" men ready to do this upon the slightest provocation ; the women he had imposed upon and robbed would not haye neglected a fa vorable opportunity to fall upon j him. As he .dbnfeased to Thomas Mayple, he went in fear of his life.. From this, old comrade; whom he had kept in bondage, he received nb .sympathy.. The confidential el<*rk had heard thö^ story of (the^ be¿ trayal and desertion, and his .careless easy^uatttre, was mubh'distúrbed by it. T)isagreeable as we^e tho duties he had been oalled upon, tb pérfprm in Che service of such a grinding taskmaster /as Thrifty Miller, he had performed them so good naturedly^ and there lay t«'-his credit sb-large ah accumulation of. kindly acts, that kp could not have failed to become a favorite.' 'And now, when, in consequence of the general indignation he was called ùpbri to pronounce an opinión upon his' employer, he also became indignant, and declared that he had never, hitherto^ believed that Thrifty Miller could behave so wickedly. ' . f "lt is a shame,Vr said a' woman, "that a mau like jyou ,should -remain in the sérvice of a 'mau like him? .

He/.shuddered,iand looked -up, and fancied he saw his old mother looking down sadly upon him from .the skies.' r' , .:; ? ; "Something dreadful will happen if I don't make it up to them," he thought. " It must be done-it must ! I oan't go about with this weight at my heart. It would drive me mad." . He had a small room of his own m the house in 'which Thrifty Millei's grinding business was transacted, and he retired to it, and locked, the door, and began to ruminate. He opened his old itrunk in which all his worldly poBBessious were collected-some old remnants of clothes worth about twopence, two or three story books he had picked up cheap at books! alls, and a picture of his mother. It was very much faded, but memory brought back the features distinctly. She had not been a bad mother to him ; she had been poor but . she had done the best she could, and he coiild recall, and did, many little incidents with which- she was tenderly and lovingly connected; \- "I give you my honest word, mother," he said; aloud, as though he was replying to an accusation, "I never, had an idea till now that I was doing such dreadful things, and that I was such a wicked monster." . - After which it seemed to him as if he was lis tening again to'the last words the woman had spoken to him- ., " Undo what youv'e done, in the best way you cari. Toil can't call back the dead, but you can make it up to the living." " Yes, I would," he said, aloud, in reply to the /silent voice, " if I knew how.'' ; Listlessly he took up one of the books he had bought; and happened to open it on a page in whioh the ,character of a rich, avaricious money lender ana miser was depicted. Thomas Mayple read it with a kind of fascination, and never in all his after-life forgot the concluding lines : " In perfect, truth; it may /be said that ho was a man wliosè/oiEcé was his church, whose desk was his pulpit'/whose lodger was his bible, and whoso mo ney waa his god." The words had a peculiar fascination for him, and he repeated them over and over again-" whose office was his churoh. whose desk was his pulpit, whose ledger was his bible, and whose*?mpney was his god." He, pressed his head;^be|ween his hands. That?was. the way in which he .had been passing his life. Church, pulpit, bible, ,'god, all were atv hand1' within the walls of /Thrifty Miller's house, /and' everyone of the seven days bf the week was),à day. of unrest and ruin. It. seemed to him asviffhe was just awaking from/a horrible dream. But it was no dream that; Mrs. Porter was ruined, and her children were going .about without shoes to their teet j it was no dream that Eachael Laven der's baby was starving, and that pretty Rachel's heart was filled with despair; it was no dream/' that Mrs. Rickaby was dead, and that her j/chil dren were ih ,the' workhouse; A host of other persons rose'in judgment against.him, allwith desolate homes and wrecked futures-bad/work for which he and Thrifty Miller were responsibly "Yes," he groaned, " ruined by me and Thrifty t Miller. No'; doubt of that. He told me to do his' dirty work, and I did it. lamas bad.asyhe'is, every bit as»bad. ¿It'íis perfectly horrible, to. think of, and I neveriäid think of it in a prôpërlight till now.
