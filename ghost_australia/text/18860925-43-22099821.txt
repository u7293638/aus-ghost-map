CURRENT TOPICS. ■ At a recent meeting of tha Carcpordown Railway Extension League delegates were present from the Cobden Ratepayers' Union, who asked tho assistarxe of the league in'obtaining the construction of the first instalment of the furest railway line from' Camperdown.to Cobden. Mr. John Walls J.P., subsequently communi cated with Mr. Anderson M.L.A, who, iv company with Mr. Williamson M.L.C., waited on tho Railway Commissioners on Wednesday, and brought the matter under their notice. Thu Commissioner*, in reply, remarked that it would be unad visablo to let such a small section, as the total length of the line was only about 18 miles. Tho work would be carried out consistent with the numerous other lines that had to be constructed. They, how ever, promised further consideration. It has been currently reported during the last few days," that a magnificent estate in the immediate vicinity of Cara penlnwu is to bo cut up into suitably-sized blocks, and leased for agricultural pur poses. The estate in question comprises somo of the finest agricultural land in the Western district, and it has hitherto been justly celebrated for its shoep carrying powers. The effort that is now being made to extinguish the liabilities of the Camper down Railway Extension League, is likely to provo most successful: A sum of £IU, it will be remembered, was collected at last meeting, and Mr. \V. H. Gubbins has since collected £10 or<£l2. Mr. Walls has also obtained further donations, and only a small portion of the town and distiict has been canvassed. A few not very generous replies have been received from people whs have derived the greatest benefit from railway extension ; but it is gratifying to know that the assistance which has been refused, or any assistance that cannot be cheerfully given, will not bo necessary. A dastardly trick was played on a well-known stonemason of this town some weeks ago. It appears ' that the tradesman was the successful contractor for the stone and brickwork in connection with a building now being erected at the west end of the town. He was making excellent progress with his work, and after having laid down the greater part of the foundations he discovered one day that there was an error of about two feet in the dimensions of the building. The stonemason felt certain that his own measurements wero correct, and on making a strict examination he found that some evil disposed person had maliciously shifted the line along the length of the building some two or three feet in. The man had left the lines over night, and under cover of darkness these had been tampered with. Next morning he resumed work without noting the change, with the result that a lot of useless work was done. It took the greater part of a week to remove and re-erect the portion which had thus been improperly erected. It is supposed that the person who moved tho line mußt have been a tradesman as the alteration was most skilfully effected. The motive is considered to have been mere trade jealousy. It is said that tricks of the kind are common in the old country; but, fortunately, they have not been of frequent occurrence in this colony. The matter was kept quiet for some time in the hope that the culprit might be detected; but it would Deem that he must escape this time. . , ■ . .: ' We learn that Mounted-constable Bourke, who has for upwards of a year been stationed at Camperdown, is about to bo transferred to Colac. Constable Bourke came to Camperdown compara tively a new hand, and during his stay hero he has developed very considerable abilities.' He is a painstaking and con- cientious officer, and great regret has been expressed at his projected removal. With all duo respect to Superintendent Toohey, it may be pointed out that these frequent changes in the local police force are hardly just. The constable about to be removed had got into the run of the work, if it might be so termed, and he is now to be transferred from the district when his services are becoming most useful. It is to be hoped that Mr. Toohey wiH fe-considor his decision, and retain Constable Bourke in Camperdown. Gbbat complaints have been made re garding the cunduct of some youths who gather round thn entrance to the Bible Christian Church on Sunday nights. They have been in the habit of addressing insulting remarks to people i;oing into the church, or passers by; hut lately their mischievous spirits have led them into other pranks. The church committee have recently gone to considerable expense in improving the property, and this soeras to have given otfenco to nome larrikins, who have recently sot to work to destroy the lately repaired fence. The police might give some attention to that part of the town on Sunday nights, and introduce ♦lie " niovo on " system, with, perhaps, a satisfactory result. Tut trucks of sheep wan consined tea thkti*iet|«l«&, taH«MiUk Tire chief topio of conversation in Cam perdown during the week has boen^ the reported appearance of a " ghost,", in a house situated in Manifold street'1 The present tenant, a bachelor, is reported to havo actually seen the > " visitor. from another f.world." The ' gentleman • in question returned from the metropolis on Monday by the last train, and duly retired to rest. He was verjr tired, and was sound asleep in a few minutes. Ho awoke during the night with a sort of " uncanny" feeling about him, and on looking down to Uio foot of tho bod he saw (or fancied ho saw) a man sitting on it. Thinking for a moment that somcono was playing a practical joke on him, he kicked out vigorously at the visitor, and to his horror his foot passed through the figure' without meeting any obstacle. Thomugldy roused he promptly sat upright in the bed, but there was nothing to be seen.' Think ing it was a dream he lay down again, but in.a very fow minutes tho apparition was again visible. Without waiting to make further discoveries the earthly occupant of tho room gathered up his clothes and made about tho quickest time on record from the house to the shelter of a hostelry somo hundreds of yards away.. Tho shock to liis system was so great that ho has since found it necessary to go to the sea side for change of air. This is the account which has caused so much stir in Camper down. It is now proposed to attempt to unravel the seeming mystery, and numbers of persons have volunteered to sleep in the room reported to be haunted, in order to provo that the "ghost" exists only in imagination. .It may be stated tliat some of tho former tenants have testified to noises, etc., but they have generally attri buted them to the love of some friends for playing a practical joke. The idea of tho house being haunted is generally ridiculed; but there seems to be a desiro on the part of some people to clear up the mystery. The trustees of tho Mechanics' Hall wars pRKDton Thursday night at tho meeting of the Mechanics' Institute com mittee. A .st atement was compilod at the meeting, from which it appeirod that the total cost of the hall was £1000, of which amount £1430 had been raised, leaving a liability of £170. Tho advisa bility of building an nnto room at tho rear of the hall was considered. A mother of pupils to loam practical farming are (o be taken by the Govern ment, on a payment of £25 per aunum. The number of applications received was in oxcesa of the number of pupils re quired, and a selection had to be made. Among the successful applicants are two from this district, viz.. Master H. Young, son of the head teacher of the Camper down State school, and Master Hindhaugh, son of the popular manner of Danedite station. Both pupils will leave for the Experimental Farm at Doukie, about tho commencement of October. \- We have received several complaints regarding a woman who is said to be travelling round tho district on a begging tour, accompanied by some children. The husband of the woman is reported to be earning good wages, and under the cir enmstancea she is not a suitable object for charity. ' : The mania for suicides which seems to have possessed the people- of Victoria to a largo extent, has apparently extended to other classes of the animal kingdom. On Wednesday la9t a sparrow appears to have committed suicide in a most deliberate manner by hanging itself. The tragic death took place immediately over the doorway nf one of the side entrances to the Lcura hotel. An examination ' dis closed the fact that tho bird had managed tv suspend itself ovor the sharp cd;o°of soino projecting mortar in tho stone work, and that death had resulted, as coroners' juries misht say, from "asphyxia by hanging." Tho cue appears to hare been one of deliberate suicide, as the sparrow, with the slightest exertion, might have liberated itself. The motive fur the deed can only be guessed at.- Domestic infelicity, the loss of a dear one, disasters in business (if sparrows have business), may have produced temporary insanity, when birds, like men, would doubtless be capable of any crime. The body was allowed to hang for somo hours, probably as a warning to other Bparrows not to tako their lives into their own hands. Tub Right Rev. Dr. Moore, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ballarat, passed through Camperdown on Wednesday, on his way to Warrnambool. Tho object of the Bishop's visit to that town was to officiate at the laying of tho foundation stone of a new church. The ordinary meeting of the Camper down Catholic - Young Men's Literary Society was held in Miss Robaon's school room on Wednesday evening, when there was a fair attendance of members. Mr. H. A. Meagher (vice-president) occupied the chair. Three new members wero elected and one proposed: The business for the evening was the reading of the magazine, contributed to by members. The papers related to various subjects of interest to the society. A syllabus was prepared for tho ensuing session, com prising 'debates, essays, elocutionary and magazine. It was decided to subscribe to the Adtotate. A meetlso of the committee of the Mechanics' Institute was held on Thurs day night. Tho schedule with reference to the Government grant was filled up, duly signed, and ordered to be forwarded to the Chief Secretary's Department, Melbourne. . . At tho Hamilton show held last week, Mr..J. M. Peter exhibited aoiuo stock, four-in-hand, and other whips, made of kangaroo hide, tipped with gresn hide. The Spectator, writing of them, says that the thongs would delight stockowners and Jehus generally, so beautifully 6nished were they. We understand thst Mr. Peter has received several orders to com plete from the adjacent colonies. There was an oicellent attendance at Messrs Hepburn, Dowlingand Crawford's sale of bullocks on Wednesday. Ninety eight bullocks were offered, and sold to the exors. of the late hon. Neil Black, Mount Noorat, at £7 per head. Mb.

Our Terang correspondent writes : The postmaster, Mr. Bell, who has been appointed to succeed Mr. Frayne here, arrived on Tuesday morning. On his arrival, Mr. Page, who has been acting as relieving officer, took his departure. Two young ladies of this district are about to open a dancing class.

Parnell'a Bill for the relief of Irish tenants was continued and brought to a conclusion in the House of Commons on Tuesday night Mr. John Alorley and Sir William Vernon Harcourt spoke in support of the measure, which Lord Hartinstoti, on the other hand, opposed. Sir Blichael Hicks-Beach, the Chief Sec retary for Ireland, : delivered a; .vigorous speech, in which ho condemned the Bill as unfair, and tending toward the levying of.black-mail. He further declared thai the sociall condition" of" Irolaud at the' present.time was sncli that' the Govern ment might be compelled to summon Parliament at an earlier date than usual, in order to ask for enlarged powers for, the administration of Irish afUirs. The House finally divided on the Bill, with the result that it was rejected by 297 to 202 votes; tho Government thus having a majority of 05 votes. Mr. J. L. Dow, M.L.A., accompanied by Messrs. G. Young, J.Williamsonand D. Ham, Ms.L.C, Messrs. J. J. Madden,' Bourchier, Langdon, M'Lollan, Auderson (Villiers and Heytesbury), Murray and Baker, Ms.L.A., and- representatives from the Belfast shire and borough coun cil, Worrnambool sliire and borough council, Koroit Bhiro and borough council, Minhamite shire and borough council and the Mount Rouse shire council, on Wednesday waited upon the Railway Commissioners, and asked that the sur veyors engaged in surveying tho lines from'Warrnambool to Koroit, and from the latter place to Belfast, should, on the completion of that work, immediately commence the work of surveying the line from Koroit to Dunkeld. It was also desired that the survey of the cross country line from" Avoca to Ararat should be undertaken as early as possible. The Commissioners, in reply, stated that tho surveyors in the Western district would not bo removed from that quarter until tho whole of tho lines wero • surveyed.' With regard to the Avoca and Ararat line they promised that as soon as the sur veyors finished their work on the Ingle wood and Dunolly line. they would be instructed to proceed with tho survey of tho Avoca and Ararat line. . i Tire opening wool salo of the season at Messrs. R.'(•uldsbrough and Co.'s wool stores, Bourke and William stretta, Mel-, bourne, look place ou Wednesday after noon, when a cttalogne of 2428 kales was offered to a large attendance of buyers, ami over 2000 bales were disposed of. Tho reserve figures in most instances were very high, but notwithstanding that fact competition, was keen, and admirable prices were realised. The bulk; of the wool offered was scoured, of last yeir's clip (principally from the lowor Darling), and that offered in the grease was also northern. The following is a resume of tho prices obtained :—Greasy (red, earthy wool), to o|d ; "pieces, 7jd; g bellies, C^d; soured fellmongers', 18d; scr. station, 267 bales at 2ljd. and 386 bales (both lower Darling) at 201 d ; scr. pieces (same brand), 18|d ; scr. locks lljd, and scr. bellies 15jd (both from same district.) The principal buyers wore English agents, and most of the wool will find its way to Yorkshire; but one or two special lots were secured for Japan. In the Legislative Assembly on Wed nesday Mr. Derham, in reply to Mr. Anderson (Yilliers and Heytesbury), said that the increments due to telegraph operators who bad been promoted to a higher grade since the Ist July last were now being arranged.' The debate on the Railway Construction vote waa continued, and progress was reported. The Residence Areas Act 1881 Further Amendment Bill was read a second time and committed.
