Twilight Song. Dewy twilight ! eilenb hour I Welcome to our cottage bower 1 See, along the lonely meadow, Ghost' like, falls the lengthened shadow, While the sun, with level shine, Turns the stream to rosy wine } And from yonder busy town Homeward hies tho lazy down.

StealB the sheep-bell's drowsy sound j While the ploughman, late returning Sees his cheerful fagot burning, ' And his darae, with kindly smile, Meets him by the rustic style } While beneath the havrthorao mute Swells tho peasant's merry flute. ; Last), from market homeward speed ; Traveller, urge thv lagging steed — Fly the dark wood's lurking danger ; Churl, receive th--» 'nigh tod stranger — He with merry Hong and jent Will repay thy niggard least, And the eye of Heaven above Smile upon the deed of love. Hour of beauty ! hour of peace ! Hour when caie and labor oeate j When around her hosh'd dominion Nature uprtacJH her brooding pinion, While a thousand anqel eyes Wake to wakh m itoxn the wkicH, Till tb© re moo wot rt*» ifocre, And the heart i.H rnovcvj to prayer.
