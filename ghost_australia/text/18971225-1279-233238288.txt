Original Poetry. CHRISTMAS HYMN. (BY THE LATE EBNEBT GILES.; Unto the throne of God's high grace, Now let us hymn a tuneful song, Where saints and angels hold their place Immortal in the golden throng ; There harps celestial sound their praise Of Jesus Christ the crucified ; To heaven's high dome for ever raise Anthems to Christ the crucified. Ah I could we mortals hear tho strain, The holy music from the sltieB, How would it leach us tu attain (And dwell with Christ in) Paradise, Where Father, Son and Holj Ghost The three in one united reign, Where all the gleaming heavenly host Resound their praise again, again. Where all the blazing, burning stars In rapture glow with light divine, Illuminating the heavenly bars They worship, sing and ever sbine, The circling orbB which float around The golden throne of heaven's high king Choiring with celestial sound Unto their God their chorus ring. The cherubim and holy bond Of souls celestial kneel and sing, Archangels in their glory stand And fold before God's throne each wing. Then let us mortals from the earth Follow their deathless paradigm, Follow with joy the holy mirth Of the eternal Seraphim.
