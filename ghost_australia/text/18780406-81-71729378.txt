AMONG THE GEYSERS. The Lower Fire Hole Basin is another remarkable place in the National Park, though not equal to the upper one, from which it is separated by a low divide. Still there are in it a great number of geysers exhibiting an infinite variety of fine structure, appearance, and size, "some small, some large, meriting almost to be called little lakes, and containing vast volumes of boiling water; others mere cracks or fissures in surface, occasionally ejecting air or liquid, like the diminutive puffing-holes one meets with on the sea-shore." Sometimes it is silica or flint that is deposited; at other times iron, or silica and iron together, mixed in some cases with sulphur also. Old springs are here constantly dying put and new ones springing into life, the pine-trees standing near springs, coated with deposit, and yet in full life, show that the outbreak of these springs must be something of vary modern date. Numerous bare patches in the forest indicate where springs and geysers once have been, and in many little lakes or ponds are buried the remains of extinct geysers. There are also various mud volcanoes in this basin. The Fire Hole River flows through the basin. Its waters are warm, and much appre- ciated in cold weather by flocks of geese and ducks. The whole of the river- sides are "honeycombed and pitted with springs, ponds, and mud-pots, furrowed with boiling streams, gashed with fissures, and gaping with chasms, from which issue hollow rumblings, as if great stones were rolling round and round, or fierce, angry snarls and roars. The ground sounds hollow under foot. The track winds in and out among holes that puff sulphur flumes or squirt water at you; by great caverns that reverberate hideously, and yawn to swallow you up, horse and all; crosses boiling streams which flow over beds composed of a hard crust, coloured yellow, green, and red, and skirted by great cisterns of boiling, seething water. The crust feels as if it might break through at any moment and drop you into fire and flames beneath, and animals tread gingerly upon it. You pass a translucent lovely pool, and are nearly pitched into its hot azure depths by your mule, which violently shies at a white puff of steam maliciously spitton in its face through a w|i.||i|i lirHl.u III fhn pu Ol, Yi'll IHH»I ilu dí PKimiii» Uli" t/MI t rnii|ii)..irii)iriiiiii.i en vein, mn) muri Imuit sviili m»a ii,<|l|i> (him HI»P« ll» Mri'W|»u /ililli I» flHldui) ll ind i f hot tVOtiT, ».illili rjtJ-i'li'My.

You fancy you can bear the rattle of the loom, the whirl of wheels, the clang and clatter of machinery; and the impres- sion is borne upon the mind that you are in the manufacturing department of Inferno, where the skilled hands and artisans, doomed to hard labour, are employed. I can compare it only to one's feelings in an iron- foundry, where one expects every moment to step on a piece of hot iron, to be run through the stomach by a bar of white glowing metal, to be mistaken for a pig, and cast headlong into a furnace, or be in some way burned, scalded, or damaged."
