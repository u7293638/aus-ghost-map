TE WfílTl, THE MAORI ! PROPHET. The intelligence received a few weeks, since that the Maori King, who fot years has re Bided in oallen dignity in the Waikato nursing; his wrath against the pakohas, had unexpectedly accepted the inevitable supre- macy of the white race, and in token of his submission had tendered his guns to Major Muir, the Government representative at Alexandra, was hailed with satisfaction by all friends of New Zealand. The catiBes which induced Tawhaio to abandon his policy of isolation have not been dis- closed, but possibly the representations of the politic chief Kowi, whose frequent and friendly intercourse with the Europeans mast bave convinced him of the hopelessness of a renew ul of the old conflict, may have, at last, produced their legitimate influence. Whatever the cause, the submission of the Maori King was as completo as could have been desired. With a cere- monious display,' which would have bor- dered on the ludicrous but for the intense enrneBtucsB of the native actors, Tawhaio and his followers surrendered their much prized ßims as a mark of submission to the colonial iiiuhorities, and as a sign that peace was to Lo their future policy. With diplo- matic tact Major Mair returned the guns, aud having rnbbed noses with His Majesty, and exchunged all other ceremonies con- sidered necessary to give due solemnity to the conclusion of a treaty of amity with the natives, he hastened to telegraph to Wellington the joyful intelligence of the paci- fication ol' tho King country. But scarcely had the nntive difficulty been solved on the eastern side of the North Island than it pre- sented itself with new phases of annoy- ance on the West Coast. It was hoped that the energetic measures which were taken Eome 12 months ago had con- vinced the natives at Parihaka of the futility of attempting any active resistance to the authority of the Government. Every effort was being made to secure a reasonable, even a gênerons settlement of all Maori claimB, us will be acknowledged when it is mentioned that it was proposed to Bccure reserves amounting to nearly 263,000 acres, of an estimated value of £638,000, to tribes on the West Coast, which, in the aggregate, did not exceed 3,000 souls, The^ difficulty whioh has unexpectedly ariBen" and which may vety possibly result in a renewal of a war of races, is apparently attributable to a sudden change of policy on the part of Te Wbiti, the celebrated .Maori prophet, who for years past has exercised a mysterious influence over the ignorant and superstitious natives on the West Coast. Very little is known in Aus- tralia of the career of this extraordinary fanatic, or of the sequence of events which have led up to the present unsatisfactory position, which, unless the greatest care is exercised, can only be solved by the dread arbi- trament of war. We propose in the following remarks to briefly sketch the origin of the dispute, and the efforts which have been made from time to time to settle it, and iu doing bo to throw Borne light upon the character of the strange being whose baleful influence threatens to produce such disastrous consequence to hiB countrymen, for it must be remembered that the long Buffering patience of the white Bettlers is thoroughly exhausted, and if hostilities do break out ' Vee vktia will probably be their war cry. It may posBibly be thought by some who are unfamilinr with the peculiar channels in which Maori fanaticism so frequently runs, that an exaggerated importance has been attached to the power of this man, but to such we it ply in the words of a leading New Zealand politician and an ex-Minister of Native Affairs, that " it is difficult to produce by description a correct impres- sion of the strange influence which Te Wbiti exercises over the minds and actions of his followers, and of the extra- ordinary mental condition whioh his teach- ings or preachings have produced in the minds cf the Maoris of the West Coast.'' Those vho are Bceptical should recall the terrible t cenca which occurred in another part of ihe North Island some 12 years ago iu consequence of the rapid spread of the Eau Ilau religion, and through the direct influence of its chief apostle, Te Kooti. The WeBt Coast difficulty, like every other important dispute with the natives, had its origin in the land. Sixteen or seventeen jcars ago the Maoris on this part of the coast joined in the rebellion which broke out in the North Island, and as a punishment their territory was confiscated-on paper-by the Government of the day. Little had been done to give penal effect to this sentence, when the natives again rose in revolt in 1868, under the chief Titokowaru, and in the war which followed the few Bettlers who were scattered along the coast, but whoseholdings it must be remembered never extended north of the WainROngoro River, were driven from their homesteads, and forced to seek the shelter of the settled districts. Within a year, however, Titokowaru waa defeated, his fol- lowers dispersed,and the dispossessed settlers again returned to their holdings. No attempt waB made to occupy the confiscated territory for several )ears, a mistake the effects of which ore now apparent, for the reluctance of the Government to enforce their authority impressed the natives with the idea that they bad abandoned their claim to the Waimate Plains, mid that the land had in conse- quence reverted to its original possessors, who re-occupied their old villages, and again cultivated the soil of this fertile district. To Whiti appears to have ' . emerged from obscurity- for he was not a high chief by birth-after the failure of Tito .kownru. II eprofesBed to achieve, by subtlety and supernatural means, what the man of war had been unable to accomplish by force, mid the apparent success with which he so long withstood the power of the Government, for years secured him the unquestioning obedience, not only of the natives on the AVeBt Coast, but of other tribes who have no direct interest in the lands in this district, but who ' were attracted to his standard by his reputa- tion 88 a prophet, and who have Bince ?' Buffered imprisonment and would willingly \- have faced death in obedience to his com- mand. His adherence to a policy of passive resistance unquestionably evinced tho pos- session of an unusual degree of political BBgacity and of self- restraint, aud goes far to controvert the opinion sometimes expressed that he is nothing but a fanatical enthusiast or a madman. The wild eloquence with which ho sometimes incites his followers to mischief or restrains their impetuosity, or his incoherent appeals to Alua, whose prophet he claims. to be, may encourago an im- pression that his words are "the false ure of an o'erheated mind," but those who know the man most intimately and have watched his career most attentively appear to entertain a far higher im- pression of his intellectual calibre than to Buppose him to be a mere self-deluded en- thusiast. In either case there is certainly method in his madness, for his tactics have enabled the tribes to hold the confiscated territory for yeara longer than they would bave done had the power of the Government been moro openly defied. Had he had re- course to armB, he would undoubtedly have been crushed like Titokowaru, but by .' astutely forcing the authorities to take the initiative in violence he converted his weak- ness into strength. His repeated successes very Boon emboldened him to assert the pos- session of supernatural power, and his pre tenBionB were accepted without question by the tribes, who regarded him aB a great pro- phet-a belief which later on deepened into a conviction that he was a Heaven-Bent saviour, destined to deliver not only the West Const, but the whole of New Zealand, from the dominion of the Pukehas. The appear- ance of this remarkable man waa recently sketched in tho following terms by a writer in the Nae Zealand Times : " With head uncovered, grey-bearded, bare- footed, elad in grey merino shirt, with shawl , of many colours wrapped round his louis erect and motionless, stood the moat power ful matt in these islands a'iout to address his assembled people He looks about 00 years of ace, bia dark batt tinged with streaks of grey, his thin beard-unusually large for a Maori-quite white He baa tho moat intellectual face probably ever seen in a Maori, with keen bright, but kindly eyes, brm mouth, and refined features He is of fair height, with well turned Umba The aBBembled crowd baten breathlessly, hm keen eyes range piercingly over the audience, and then his voice ringa nut clear and distinct, every sentence uttered with suitable change of voice, now persuasively, now m a tone of thunder, presently in notes of deepest melancholy as he tells them of their wrooRB, and anon in stern commanda, na the uiBpired prophet, for such he profesaos tobe" Nearly nine years ago, the Government desired to construct a road through a portion of the territory over which Te V hiti claimed to rale, but after permitting it to reach a certain fence, he inter feted and effectually stopped the work A little later he prevented tho completion of a telegraphic line intended to connect Taranaki with the rest of the colony, and for years he was Btrong enough to prohibit the erection of the much needed lighthouse at Cape Egmont But the act which placed Te Whitt upon the pinnacle of his power and to which may be traced the sortes of events which seem to be fast culminating in a final struggle between the two rucea, occurred some two and a half jears ogo Believing that the time had arrived for the settlement of the Waimate Plains, the Grey Goxernment, in 1878, directed surveyors to commence a surrey of the country north of the Waingon- goro River, with a view to its sale. The natives remained passive for somo time although they were evidently restlesa and dissatisfied The murder of a cook attached to one of the survey parties waa the lirat out xx ard sign of hostility The murderer fled to Panbulla, and claimed the protection of Te VMnti on the ground that the crime waa necessitated by the prevailing ' darkneaa on the land queation It ia Bcarcely necessary to add that the rights of sanctuary were at once accorded to him, and that he ia still living at large in deGance of the laws which are supposed to be paramount throughout New Zealand Mr Sheehan, the Native Minister, who had constantly endeavoured to conciliate the Maoris by what may well be pronounced undue concessions, visited Pan haka in March, 1870, but found that the infatuation of the tribes and the insolent demeanour of the prophet were too strong for even him to combat As if to give em phaeis to his humiliation of the Govern ment, 'le Whiti selected the very day after his interview with Mr Sheehan for his crowning act of hoatthty lie directed the summarv removal of the surveyors from the Waimate Plains, and Iiíb followers, with out hesitation, carted the whole of them with their instruments, baggage, and supplies, across the Waingongoro, and de poBited them on the settled land to tho south of that rix er At this time the very land from which the officers of the Go vernment were driven was advertised for sale, so that there was nothing wanting to give éclat to the latest manifestation of Te Whiti s power Long prior to this Te Whiti had laid claim to supernatural attributes Ile asserted tha he was able to raise the dead, and the natives frequently brought to Ina meetings the clothes which would be re quired by their departed friends when in obedience to the prophets powers they cast off the cerements of the tomb 1 heir faith was not even dissipated by re peated disappointments or by the declaration of Te V\ hiti that he was alluding to what would be accomplished at the general resur rection at the last On one occasion, it ia Bald, the chief Tltokowaru ventured to in quire of him " Who is behind you' ltnpl) tug "bj xy hose power do you act' but when the startling reply was made, unhesitatingly, "There ib no one behind me, I am the Tather, I am the Son, I am the Holy Ghost, the incipient Bceptic had at least to profess himself satisfied Theexents which caused the temporary withdrawalof the Waimate Plains from sale vastly increised the infatuation of the natix es Mr John Brj ce, the late Minister of Native Affairs, to whose interesting official despatches we are chiefly indebted for par liculars of the remarkable career of the Maori prophet, remarks - " Up to that time the mental epidemic among the Maoris on the West Coaat though strong, was not overwhelming, but it then attained an intensity and force which are not yet loat, and which baa enabled the faith of the Maoris in their prophet and lord to xvithstand the effect of all the falsified predic tiona and all the sniTenngs he baa brought upon them Clearly nt that time his own dreams of power became unbounded He was to recox er the Waimate Plains for the Maori He was to recover the xvhole of the confis cated linds in New Zealand The white man wub to be dispossessed of even the lands he had acquired by purchase Te Whiti was to become the supremo ruler of the West Coast of the whole of New Zealand, indeed, of the xvhole world nay, not only a ruler, but a prophet, a king, a god ' The apparent inaction of the Government encouraged a bolder policy than that of pasBive resistance, and accordingly Te Whtti declared that "the heart of the Pdkeha waa indeed to be tried, and in pursuance of this vision vouchsafed by Atna he directed his followers " to plough the belly of the Go xernment which the) interpreted to mean that they were at once to begin to plough the paddotl s and lands of the settlers, not within ihe debntable territory north of the Wain gongoro but the purchased landa which had been occupied and cultivated by Europeans for j ear?, and situated well within theaettled district" 'Ibe Government Beetued afraid to interfere lest they Bhould precipitate a war of races, so the settlers xvere forced to com* ine for their oxxn protection They according!) armed themselves, and arrested the ploughmen, who by direction of their prophet, made no resistance, but quietly ac cepled their fate, be it deith or imprison ment, iniplicitl) accepting To Whiti s assur once that they were thereby working out the plan foreordained for the deliverance of thoir tountrj T his strange warfare continued until over 2C0 prisoners were taken and it became a serious question where to lodge them with »nf etj They all evinced the greatest anxiety for mart) rdom, infinitely preferring imprison menttobemgcompelled toreturn toParihaka lo be characterised as unworthy servants 1 lio mysterious influence of the prophet gradually changed ita character The belief that he waa the destined deliverer of his race commenced to xxano as his predictions repeatedly failed, but the com iction that he possessed the power of the evil eje more than maintained his influence, for to the natives " the terrible dread of being maLutued, be witched, bedeviled to death, is an ever preeent fear ' This power was not only exercised over the more ignorant portion of the Maori race, but extended to chiefs of high rank, higher than his own, who have acknow leaped that tbey xvere constrained to send him supplies, and to submit to his dictation When the Grey Goxernment wera replaced by the Hall Administration, a more deter mined policy waa adopted on the Weat Coast, although conciliation was Btill pushed almost to the x erge of weakness An ox erwhelming force of armed constabulary was concentrated in the disturbed district and roads and bridges were rapidlv constructed, which will bo of immense Btrategic importance in the exent of hostilities The opposition of the Maories declined in proportion to the actixity of the Government Tho plough mg ceaEed, and fencing a milder form of irritation was resorted to for a time, but it too was at last abandoned and peace seemed bo assured that orders were given to diBband many of the recruits All tina time a commission, conaiBting of Sir T Dillon Bell and Sir 'William I ox, was taking an lnttuitude of paina lo arrive at the real merita of the West Coaat difficulty, and to determine what steps must bo taken to secure justice to both Mnonea and Europeans By their direction, reserves amounting to over a quarter of a million acres of splendid land were set apart for the use of the few thousand natitea resident in the district Repeated attempts were made to ascertain the wishes of the Parihaka natives Overture after o\ er ture was made to Te Whiti Major Parris the special local commissioner several times attended the monthly meetings for the pur pose of explaining the intentions of the Parliament, but he was refused a hearing Tor all that it ia perfectly well known that Te V hiti and most of the natives are tho roughly well acquainted with the steps which bave been taken On one occasion the prophet expressed his willingness to d13 cues his troubles with the Governor, and in their desire to use every reasonable means for a pacific settlement, the Hall Government advised Sir A, H Gordon to arrange for an interview, either at Wellington or New Plymouth A letter was written and His Excellency s A.D C , Captain Knollys, WBB entrusted with its delivery He executed his mission on last Christmas Day, but, as will be Been, it was devoid 01 political result Captain Knollys, who appears to have been a shrewd obserier, embodied his impressions m an interesting report, from which we pro- pose to make some extracts as they will convey a clearer idea of Te Whitis cha racler and insolent self assertiveness than nnythmg else that has been published Captain Knollys reached Parihaka abou mid day During the drive from Opunakt he passed lbrouL.li miles of fertile country, planted with potato, maize, and tobacco Vt ithm a mile and a half of Parihaka the Maori reserve was entered, and it, too, was well cultivated, and cattle, horses and pigs abounded Parihaka is a village of con Biderable size, containing over 250 wbares, and some 1 200 or 1 500 inhabitants, but at the monthly meetings of the prophet, the visitors can be counted by thousands The natives ap , peared tobe comfortably housed, well furnished tilth blankets pillows, and other necessaries and to have abundance of food The village is not fortified, but the country adjacent is well adapted for irregular warfare The aide de camp was courteously received, and pro vided with a mat and a pipe, after which he was informed that the prophet was enjoying a game of draughts, and could not be dis (urbed After Borne four or five hours bad elapsed, a chief inquired what was the object of the captain a visit, bnt when Te Whiti was acquainted with the reply he vouchsafed no answer As the mountain clearly would not come to Mahomet, Captain Knollys decided to go in search of the prophet The follow ing abridged account of the interview will be interesting - " We found Te Whiti in the village sitting in the open air, with the chief Tohu and others wrapped m a blanket He is a good looking man, with a ' smug ' face and a most marked expression of self complacency and conceit The absence of courtesy, dignity, and good manners, struck me, as it would anyone used to the courteous bearing of Fijian or Samoan chiefs Had I met with such want of ceremony 111 Fiji I should certainly have anticipated violence as the termination of the interview It was evident, however, that no discourtesy was intended, the men, women, and children pushing about amongst the chiefs, and even against the sacred Te N\ hiti himself, without the least ceremony We Bhook hands with 'leVt hiti and those round him After a short I ause Hone Pibama a friendly chief, asked if he should give him the Governor s letter As le Wluti would not touch it, he laid it down by his side Te Wbiti just glanced at it and made a sneering remark about the size of the envelope Tabana another chief, took the letter up, sajing 'Is it written m Maori ' and then, ' Shall I do this to it ' breaking the seal He then called a man named Tai to read it to all pre Bent When Tai had read about two I ages (as far as the words ' to discuss these matters) Te Wbiti said 'The cooked potato cannot discuss, meaning that he was cooked by the Government beyond dis cuBsion Tai attempted to go on reading, but le \/\ hiti interrupted him again with the same remark lal then put the letter in its envelope, and laid it down b> Te Whiti uq read As the prophet persistently refused to conveiBe, but when spoken to turned his back half buried bia bead m his blanket, and pretended to be bus) with his pipe, Captain Knoll) s was obliged to abandon the interview He telegraphed the result to Els I xcellency, who replied, telling him to inform le Mhiti that 'until the Governor knew how the potato was cooked, he could say nothing about it It was of the cooking of the potato from the very beginning that tho Governor wished to baie his account and for that reason had asked 1 im to meet bim to m Inch he was awaiting an answer Captain Knoll) s accordingly on December 28, sought another interne»-, which he thus describes - ' Vi e found Te Whiti and sat down outside a house to talk to him His manner was quite changed from what it was before He rat and talked, and was civil showing no signs of a desire to at oid us or to turn his back I delivered the message After an interval of silence, I said ' I he Governor has heard about the cooking of the potato from others but now he wishes to hear vthat Te A\ hiti haB to say and to tell his mind, of which he, Te Whiti, knows nothing Te Whiti answered, ' I havo nothing more to sa) The Governor knows hotv II vras done I f the Got ernor wishes to know about it he must come to the pot where the potato was cooked, and see the heap of evils that have been done It is no good my going to hide myaelf away in Wellington I an sv,ered 'That is what the Governor pro poses to do. and asks you to meet him Ile answered, ' Where the Governor wishes me to meet him is outside the pot I suggested that it waa on the edge of the pot 11 here the aBlies might be seen He said ' It is no good When a man s face is burnt the doctor comes to him to Bee it I said ' \\\ by don t you go to the doctor to show your burnt face' He aaid 'No, if a dog is chasing a pig, the pig does not cry out to tbe man The man calls the dog off I said, 'True, but if the pig runs to the man he is saved from tho dog I aBked him if he was going to answer the Governors letter He said he never had answered other letters The people about the Governor could tell their story about it I urged on him the necessity for telling his own story, but could get nothing satisfactory from him Ho said, * The Governor is like other Governors-a Governor tor the white man ' I Bald, ' He has left good behind where he came from the people are happy Ile answered, ' He has left good and bad behind bim The Maori potato is cooked 1 hiB conversation was carried on in all good humour, but thinking it would be useless to say an} thing further, I left Parihaka This very unsatisfactory attempt to open direct negotiations apparently forced Mr Bryce to the conclusion that the Government should at once adopt decisive measures for the settlement of tho West Coast difficulty He accordingly advocated an early advance on Parihaka and the arrest of Te Whiti and Tohu, his near relative and as Bistant, and their removal from the settle ment The other members of the Ministry were disinclined to precipitate matters and Mr Bryce retired.and was succeeded by Mr W Rolleston, who, however, after holding office for nine months, has just resigned the post of Nativo Minister, m order to permit hu predecessor to control thtB mportant depart ment m the crisis which has arisen The subsequent events are of too recent occur ence to need more than the briefest mention Within the last few weel s, for reasons which aro at present unexplained To Whiti has adopted a more aggressive tone than usual and by his order the fencing nuisance has been resumed At his monthly meeting on September 17 ho harangued nearly 3 000 natives in language of most menacing import He remarked - ' Nothing is left now but to fight The peace that existed is past away Let the Government and the king and the people listen to the words of the meeting Let them get from the land, and cease to bring their evil to us or they will meit away I do not say it will be by guns or an) thing else but that great tribe will meit away lake your arms look upon me as your protector, and the blessing of the Atua will be with you I send waron the land sold by the Governors If the pakehaa strike you with a stone strike them with a stone likewise If they hit you with their hands, Btrike you thus yourselves If they bring guns take your guns likewise If the pakehas come and say it is the-Gover net s lund, and bit hands to defend, strike them down These are my words They are the words Atua put into my mouth The chief Toliu, who claims to be an assistant prophet, was even more emphatic. He said - "There will be nothing but mule (death) for Maories and whites to day, and for the generations to come Our tribe will go on the land of our forefathers to tautohelohe (contend) with one another, with the Gover nor, the king, and the whites, for they have taken possession of what is ours, and xrhat we will not part with I say to all, we will not give un the land till the Governor, the king, and the whites have swallowed us up All I liaxe to say is-fight and kill, don't Bave anj one, destroy all before you " Te Wbiti dismissed the meeting after pre- dicting that if thousanua of Europeans assembled at the camp at Pangarehu tbey would make their grave there, as the land was his, and those in it would all perish What the real meaning of these I fanatical utterancca is, it is noteasy to decide I The language seemB menacing m the ex I treme, but some who profess to understand the Maories well interpret it as not an attempt to incite the tribes to war, but simply as an encouragement to them to persevere in their policy of irritation, in order to force the Go- vernment to strike the first blow The events of the next few days will probably solve the enigma. The old xvarnor chief Titokowarn, and all his people, have cleared out of their own settlement, Mawhitiwbiti, and have proceeded to Panhaka The chief is reported to have said that the inflammatory harangues of the prophet have so excited tho young braves that they are eager for a conflict The unsatisfactory result of the interview which the late Native Minister (Mr. Rol- leston) has just had with Te Whiti is also far from re assuring No doubt " War ia honourable In those who do their nativo rights maintain, ' but in this case its outbreak can only hasten the destruction of a brave and high spirited people, whose evil destiny seems ever forcing them to try and stem the inexorable advance of a race that is greater and mightier than they The Government evidently feel strong enough to take the initiative They have assembled au overwhelming force on the West Coast, within easy Btriking diatanco of Panhaka, and hav e everything in readiness for an expeditionary movement Under these circumstances an uUmiatwn has been addressed to Te Whiti requiring him either to accept the proposals of the Government within 14 daja or be prepared for the worat It ia earnestly to be hoped that the natives, who are reported to have assembled in great numbers at Panhaka, will not be so ill advised as to court their own destruction, but will disperse to their homes, and permit the long protracted disputes, which have occasioned so much bitterness of feeling, to be settled on the generous conditions which the Government have offered to concede
