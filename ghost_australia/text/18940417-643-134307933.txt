How the Premier Was Knighted. The following is an extract from an interesting character sketch of the Premier written by J. Tighe Ryan for the 'Review of Reviews': â€” 'I can only give a weak description of his in terviews with the Queen. Lord Hunts ford presented him- to Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace, where he .had the honour of answering her many in quiries about the people of Australia. She introduced him to one of her daughters. The Queen, being in mourning, wore a plain block dress. Sir George was charmed with her simple manners. 1 1 afterwards went to the Isle of White,' he said ' and drove with Lord Knutsford to ' the palace in ' the royal carriage. Lord Knutsford announced me to Her Majesty. I went down on one knee, and she asked General Byng for his sword. He offered her the uniform dreB8 sword, but she requested him to present his own sword instead. She then took the sword, and, touching my head and shoulder, said, ' In tbe name of the Pather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, arise Sir George Dibbs.' She then invested me with the gold collar, and handed me . tbe star. The ceremony over, I had another conversation with Her Majesty. Finally, I kissed her hand anil bowed out of the room.' The Premier of New Zealand, re plying to a deputation from the women of Gisborne, said that female members of Parliament were the natural se quence of women's franchise, but women should be first politically educated.
