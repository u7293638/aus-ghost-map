Sho was a pretty, young girl— so pretty, so young, that it seemed strange she should be travelling alone. . . We were returning from, Cape Colony to Old England, and our three weeks' voyage was nearly half over before I succeeded in mating the acquaintance of my pretty fellowpas senger.

A vessel, ora shark, or something equally obliging had been sighted, and there was a general stampede. My fair unknown followed the mob and left nor hook face downward on the chair.

I hid the novel behind a coil of rope which lay convenientlr near. lihe came back soon, and puckered her ashed crows when she discovered her loss. ttmSj$% I came forward with as nonchalant atus5f ?J*iJ i could assume.
