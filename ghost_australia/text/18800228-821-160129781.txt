A CASE OF RESURRECTION. The following story is told in the Era; â€” " la Thurgau, Switzerland, the body of a man was found, and it was sup posed that death had been the result of foul play. But the medical men declared that the wounds were self-inflicted, and that the deceased must have committed suicide. The body was identiSed by a large number of re latives as well as by sawyers with whom deceased had worked as having belonged in life to one Baumeler, a sawyer of Lucerne. His kinsfolk followed him to the grave, put on mourning for him, and the local papers pub lished notices of the dead man. On the evening after the interment, while a number of Baumeler's friends were making metry in the village inn, who should walk in among them but the dead man himself! The peasants dropped their tankards of lager, and stared at the ghost in dismay. Some took to their heels in fright, and, running home, barricaded their doors. The ghoBt quietly took his seat at a table, and ordered sausages, bread, and lager in large quantities, and, his meal being finished, went straight to the priest, and thanked him for the eloquent funeral oration he had delivered over his grave. He then called upon the head man of the district, and expressed his obliga tions for the trouble taken on bis behalf. So far, the ghost showed himself to be amiably inclined, but his mood changed upon looking down the columns of a local paper, which con tained an obituary notice of the deceased couched in not exactly complimentary terms. The ghost, whose reputation during lifetime was really somewhat shady, seeing his chance, in tends to bring an action for libel against the editor, who forgot to state in the obituary notice that deceased was a representative of all the virtues. The circumstances of a live ghost walking about, and contemplating law proceed ings, has thrown the village into a state of great excitement."
