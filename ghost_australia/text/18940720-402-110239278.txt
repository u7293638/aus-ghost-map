LET US FORGET. Let us forget The memories that bind us fast To our mistakes, outgrown and past ; The trust betrayed, the tarnished name, The look of scorn, the blush, of shame, Let us forget. Let us forget That once we strove for selfish gain, Regardless of another's pain ; The vain remorse, the sense of loss, The burden of our self made cross, Let us forget. Let us forget The slights, the stings, the anguished tears That marked the paths of by-gone years ; The bitter cup, the dark despair, The one sad hour which none might share Let us forget. Let us forget All but the love, the grace, the light That bore us to our present height, And haunting ghosts of grief and care The guise of angel hosts shall wear. Let us forget. â€”Ida W. Wheeler.
