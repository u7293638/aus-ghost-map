out of the beaten track of tourists and the political article, with which the number winds up, administers a mild constitution to the Con- volition of Royal Burghs in Scotland which is just now engaged according to the writer, in the exciting pastime of flogging a dead horse and parodying the Irish agitation in favour of Home Rule This is not a time, it is contended when North Britain should be agitated by paltry jealousies and petty dry seasons, and for opposing artificial obstructions to the gradual assimilation in laws and customs of the English and Scottish peoples in the lotInmhtly Review. the fifth item of the radical programme is unfolded in detail It is that of marine elementary schools in tirely free as in a leton Some valuable suggestions of social reform for the London poor are made by lady Greville and by a London artisan respectively The former deal with the question of recreation, and points out that a church, a school, and a leading loom do not supply all the needs of a human heart and brain, and that pleasure should be infused into the joyless and colour less lives of the extremely poor by concerts, dances playgrounds Arc She adduces many instances of the practical successes which have been achieved in this way and among others the pleasant Sunday evenings for the people provided by Miss Florence Hill in a schoolroom in Little Lichfield street where ten books illustrated papers and music are furnished and the admission is free. The views of the London artisan are epitomised in the concluding sentence of his article - It is only by culture that men and women can be brought to realise the full glory and honour of manual labour culture, that is, which embraces not merely the knowledge of facts but an appreciation of duties the cultivation of the heart as well as the intellect Professor Goldwin Smith in a paper entitled The 1 adney of Irish History, turns the tables on the assailants of J England and Englishmen in the sister island, and shows how false and "groundless are the accusations brought against them Hc8U)Sthat hatred of the 1 english is assiduously instilled into the Irish through the press and from the platform by agitators who subsist on the quarrel, whose hearts are steeped in venom, and who shrink from no sort of falsehood And it is by these men, who alone have the car of the people that an utterly calumnious picture of the acts, character and intentions of the British people IS every day presented to the bush mind Sir Lepel Griffin takes a very unfavourable view of America and Americans in his "Visit to Phihstia. He does not know of any country in the civilised world except Russia in which he would not prefer to reside, in which life would not be more worth living less sordid, and mean, and unlovely, and everywhere in the United States he complains that the ordinary American loudly asserts his superiority over! England, and treats an J englishman as on imbecile creatures to whom he was driving, to expound the elementary principles of social and political life At the same time he admits that there is no reason why the 1 n" lishshouldbcpopulurin Vmencti for hearns they are almost the most disagreeable race extant, and are often unendurable to each other nor is there any part of Europe except perhaps

the biogr cipher is bluntly told that he is an ass ' A critical article on the late liable t Bn one (the thus of four young, days) by Mr F W idmoic does full justice to the simple fact the flexibility

be the radical measures of the future one of which will probably be a heavy successes in duty on the passing of superfluous wealth b) inheritance Professor Jebb 1 as a good deal to say on the late performance of the Birds of Aristophanes at C unbridle and the bigger phases of Lords Lytton and Local hurst are reviewed 1 by Mr &coit;,c Dascnt and Mr 1 1 hebbel respectively There is much that will interest thoughtful readers in the dialogue on life and death "contributed by Mr W S Jill) Jin niatuialisticond and materialistic views are in, a Hally put and the latter triumphs in tin arguement Mr Lilly B notion approximates pretty closely to that of Bishop Berkely namely, that matter is one form although the lowest of spiritual energy ' My conclusion is observes the spiritualistic champion, that from a mere principal of extension you can get neither life nor mind, but that matter may well be a non extended principle of eneigyiiiunifcbting itself under dimensions In the Contivi/ioioi / Jlencw the question of annexation in Australasia is discussed by Lord Carnarvon, at whose shows an abstract lines already appeared in our columns The Bishop of Carlisle contributes some ' thoughts about apparitions in which he states the com hinton which he. himself has arrived at to lie that the supposition of some kind of intercourse talune, place between the spirit of one departed and the spirit of a living man is not absolute 1) absurd and incredible lie bil j s It is impossible to class as mere vulgar ghost stories all the tiles which have been told concerning the appearance of persons deceased, and he finishes his disquisition on the subject by trusting that "the reader will find something in it to strengthen, if necessary, his belief in the possibility of such communications between the spirit of man and other spiritual existence, as cannot be dreamed of in the philosophy of the materialistic philosopher ' In an essay on the outdoor poetry of the middle ages, Mr Vernon Leo shows us what it was in Tuscan), before the days of Lorenzo dei Medici, and how he gave it a new and more popular direction Two signs of the ministry of women are presented by the Dean of M ells, and Professor Godet respectively) The former (as ours their employment in religious and secular teaching , the latter is of opinion that that which is ordinarily recognised as her peculiar sphere is the one in which she can use her gifts to the highest advantage to others, while rendering a more solid and lasting service to the kingdom of God ' Major Baker's article on the Soudan and its future is both historically and politically interesting, and is intended to show that if Great Britain really intimate re- construct the shattered administration of the Khedive, no half measures will be effective "England he asserts, must become the determination and the adviser of 1 "jet, line position, represented by a permanent military force, will change the scene and assure the prosperity of the country ' Above all, 1 England should assume the control of the Soudan, which would render her independent of America for wheat and cotton Under the taking title of "Ladies at the Gate," Mr Francis Peck offer some suggestions for a new tragedy, the second and third acts of which show us the pauper side of English society in town and country, while the scene of the last is laid in an " elegant church," where " fashion able Christiana are kneeling in prayer for all whoaroailheted and distressed," while ma " vision of e head is seen a " dance of des is over prayers without works 'The writer concludes a forcible exposition of the evils of " outcast London, by submitting the draft of a suggested act of Parliament providing remedies for the more salient of them Among other things he would deal very gently with the parents of neglected children, and he would make it a legal offence for any owner of property to offer IIOUBCB for hire, or allow houses to be occupied, that are not in a sound sanitary condition, while at the same time empowering the sanitary authorities to demolish such buildings and to take possession of the land on which they stand, compensating the owner for the value of the property, this being based on that of the land alone Sir B J Reed M P, criticises Mr Chamberlain's proposals for the establishment of a Merchant Shipping Council, and argues that the object of the measure by which these proposals will be carried into effect ought to receive the approval of shipowners generally, while he praises the idea which dominates its admis trative section, namely, that of directly associating the large body of responsible ship owners of this country with the Government in the future operations of the Board of Trade upon merchant shipping affairs The concluding paper on England and South Africa, by the Iles John M Kenzie, is anno tried by Sir Henry Barkly and Sir Bartle Frere 'The three principal illustrations of the current number of
