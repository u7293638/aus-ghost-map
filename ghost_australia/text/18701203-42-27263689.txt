THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT. SIR, —The Ministerial financial statement is made, and p[?] of ptaise on account of its masterly lucidity have been sung to it. Every-<*> thing being only by comparison, however, I fear WflM former ones must have been jut a wm haiy. With jour permission I propose restat* ing it in a more familiar form, for I make bold to assert, that I nerer before formed part of a community so fearfully "innocent" of common arithmetic, book-keeping, and account* generally. Of ebuna I am well aware this v, in many in stances, assumed; as correct books and accounts are poison to the systematically dishonest trader (who must always hold himself ready to go bong at the right moment), and an awfnl bore to the uninitiated however well disposed one. My condensed statement therefore"!* for the Billion i for unless they learn to see things ) aright, they mast continue to be preyed upon by Ben possession frothy rather than sound quali ties. I adopt no party riews. It is open to all who eaa say, " Let the galled jade wince, my withers are unwrang." The Government in their statement, at reported in the Cemritr of SSnd instant, proceed as follows:— They tell you, you are in- £ a. d. debted for loans raised to September 80 last 3,081,186 0 0 Ob two of these loans a lose ' wae sustained, which (bar* ing spent) they add ... 209,977 0 0 They also spent over and be* yond these loans, chiefly on railway account ... ... 176,466 8 7 They also incurred "liabili ties" on railway account... 68,868 1 6 Ditto on Eleetrio Telegraph . v extension 88,707 411 Sundry ." unexpended bs> lanoes," explained in state* meat 8 (an " unexpended balance," in ordinary poo kete, would be an asset in ■tead of a liability—lean only refer you to statement 8 to render this item intetti- - gible) 88,101 1 7 Oost of Government steamer 17,600 0 0 They are also sorry to icform yoo that you have been go* teg to the bad to the average annual tune -of £77,305 7s. lOd. 8-sths, for five years. ending 1869, making in all 886,526 19 5 Total 4,060,811 11 0 They wish to deduct a sum of £74.086 Is. 9d., said to be to the credit of the sinking fond; but, as your self eleeted auditor pro t*m. t I cannot pass this till I know of its where* bout s. I * cheerfully credit them, how- ' evsr, with cash on hand and in banks, Ac, Ac. (and wish it was teu timee more) ... 70,999 0 0 Total indebtedness, Sept. 80... 3,979,813 11 0 They put it at £4.126,786 9s. Sd. net, but if you deduct £160,000 they are going to borrow . and spend this year, and add £3027 Is. 9d., — difference between sinking fund and £70,999, oash and banks' balances—yoa will find the statements coincide. Thcreforo on September 30, £ a. d. 1870, you owed 3,979£18 11 0 Bat you all know 1870 is not quite out yet. Whon this year shall terminate,- they regret to inform you that nine months' aotualities and three months' estimated probabilities will most likely lead to a further deficit 0f... 89,194 0 0 They propose now to borrow £160.000- which may be called the " lolly " part of the business, inasmuch as some of you will receive Some of it after a jolly good •weating day's work, yoa may be sun 150,000 0 0 Total 4,169,007 11 0 Supposing you then to ask how they managed to spend more than they had, they inform you they appropriated the Nation's Savings Bank deposits or trust funds, £119,918. They also issue lOUt or Treasury bills for £488,600, which, with a few minor items, enabled them to finger not far off a million of ready money. They also tell you the said Treasury Bills were provided to be paid out of revenue, but that practically there is not a ghost of a chance of it. By means of the present loan •nd other sources however, they tell you 188 600 of these hills will be met when due next month, leaving £360,000 to fall due in 1871-2-3. But a» giving an lOU does net enable an individual to say correctly, M Thank goodness that account is settled," so this remaining £350.000 must be added to the farmer total of £4,159.007 11s., making in all £1539.007 lls. as the National indebt edness on the present proposed loan being carried. The assets agatntt these liabilities are not set^forth, but I suppose a railway " esti mated " to ps v nothing towards the interest on its cost in 1870, and Ut>s than 1 per cent, (how much less is left to your imagination) in 1871, will figure as a leading item. I recollect a rail way in Auckland abandoned, crumbling to pieces, and thiuk of it whenever I look at the Brubauo bridgu, and wonder whether either of them havo been, or ever will be, completed. Perhaps, however, you prefer a cheerful view of things, in which case you must fall back noon a contoinplatiou of the millions of acres or this glorious colony, with its embowelled Basses of precious metals, forming a splendid inberiunco for an "estimated" future teeming population, in the full bluie of the enjoyment of that acme1 of earthly delights " representative government." Aiso, there i* the estimate for 1871: — K«venu-, £783 000 j expenditure, £759,607; surplus, £24,193; probabl* lapsed Totes, £10,000; surplus, £10,000; reduction generously submitted to by the Civil Bernce—third surplus. No wonder the state ment wii;ds up by " detnming" the odd £193, like, Mantul ni, arid gracefully retires with an estimated future j»ru:id total surplus of £74,000. Who fan grudge an miliaoced tariff for such a prospect ? Bother all nupplementarr estimates! tha pa.aeea of the newly- fledged colonial poli tician tor all deficits is consolidate—consolidate! I Only tak«t cure the old house at home does not learn the meaning of the word " bong." A ehield wight bo among you taking notes, an' faith, he might prcnt '«in. FRED. B. ADAMS.
