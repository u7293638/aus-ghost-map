The purse of 30 save. for trotters of the 2.55 class, mile heats, brought out four competitors, and Teviot came in the easiest of winners in the first heat, after distancing Maid of Mona and Talk and leaving Little Dick about 60 yards behind. The second heat was also won by Teviot without any difficulty. A grand contest took place during the last 200 yards of the Selling Flat Race between Queen Elizabeth, Pirate, and Kanaka. The three kept close together all the way up the straight, but just at the finish Queen Elizabeth got her head in front of Pirate, who in turn only beat Hunter by a head. The Two-year-old Handicap Flat Race was also a good contest, Amelia Victoria and Frou Frou eventually coming in first and second. The V.T.C.
