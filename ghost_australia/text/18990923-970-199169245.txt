Lost, lost, lost, on the vast expanse of ocean that stretched away, ^thousands of leagues, east west, north, south, with no land near save these inaccessible cliffs, that shot up far above our heads and sent out, here and there, sharp shafts of hidden reef, like horns wailing to gore our frail barks. Fifteen human beings in two small boats; iti al sea almost always stormy, without food for more than two or three days, without covering, except our saturated clothing, without water. What was before us save lingering to the death that must, sooner or later, overtake us ? Would it not be better to at once do as one of the men advised us, stave the boats and drown all hands at once rather than undergo the prolongation of misery which seemed inevitable? Wiser counsels and love of dear life prevailed, however: and, although we had all of ;what provisions there were in our boat, we determined to stick together as long as we could. ' But as the night advanced and the fog settled on the face of the waters and the cold wind chilled us to the Very inarrow, the extent of our hopeless position became more and more apparent. Some prayed, others 'blasphemed, some sank into speechless apathy—and so the cold, hopeless morrow broke. We had drifted during the night about a mile from the rocks, which showed dim and ghost-like through the mist. ^ All was silent around ; hot a sound^excep^ the low, unceasing hiss of the water, or tbe ! occasional wash of a little ripple against the. boat, as we drifted helplessly and listlessly aivav. : But suddenly the sun, which is rarely Been in" this desolate ^ region, aiter a . struggle with the hazy atmosphere,shone sick lily and faintly on us. This was 1 something, but very little, and it roused^ us from the condition of settled despair into whjcl^ we; were rapidlyteink-itig. Cheered by the example of the mate and Jim Cragg, we set about another search for k landing place- amidjst the I chaos of rock, though with very little hope of success,, fpr ;the cliff^ros^everywherc sheer from the .water. We were now, as I said, fifteen souls in 'all, eleven in oar boat,one of the quarterboats, and lour in the other, a small one, not much bigger than a dinary.

" v '- ^ ; • ^ Let me here state who and what he was, as I knew him then. What 1 knew of him afterwards will appsar in due course.' He was a Swede, named Joseph Born, a middle-aged man, a man gloomy and taciturn ; cine who had been of the first on our diggings »nd who had left just before the fire on the flat. He was a man I did not like ; a man, in fact, whom nobody seemed to care much about, and, whom J! had-not seeu since his departure frbm Fiery'Creek until I met him on bbard the day we sailed. How his fate became interwoven with mine this history will show. , CHAPTER II. REFUGE. Hours did we pull along those beetling cliffs in a vain search for a landing. Hour after weary hour of cold, hunger and thirst, until night again shrouded us beneath hip sable wing, and we lay under the lee of the islands until morning. Our sufferings during these two nights and a day of intense misery can never be told, and the despair of some of the men became so discouraging to the others that we, who had kept up our hearts, had to threaten to throw them overboard. Jim Cragg and the mate behaved nobly. So did the poor woman. In the morning we opened some of the tins of meat, but found it impossible to retain it on our stomachs. Only four were and we had one €ce of P' 8 ood ' In the early morning, impelled thereto by Jimand the mate, we again proceeded on bur hopeless quest. We had, during the previous day, come across the long boat floating bottom upwards, and her wa had a l so t^keo; in- tow:- Little did. we know <m:;heir idepended::our chance of life. The; weather^was singplarly calm; and the water smooth, and at >bout eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the tide being then just on the turn of flood, we came abreast of a rather wide opening in the ' cliffs, into which, after some c onsultation, we decided to venture. s |b, |wab despeeat^ j«3ianc0i /or the , • water, although slack, was still running , fi^* Me%domy 6tiaim f at ^ r^^iat strucl^|error into our hearts as we entered But tjhefe'^ks n Joflia- tor we had scanuM Entire coas#; and there was no place of foothold even for a bird, that we coulMiifl. yi |) \ {•';''<• Vi f\ ' We ran down the passage for atout a mi3e, ^ie tide rip,, bearing lis rapidly , on and aflifeatfy awe! bfrMmg fcWMdes of us.

" We were the firet that ever buret Upon that silent sea." There was not a breath of wind, not a sound, to break the awful savage solitude, save the occasional plunge of a seal into the darkly shining water ; and even that, as it echoed hollowly agaiust tlie overhanging cliffs, only seemed to render the silence more silent, the Bolitude more ^rOfbund. A short pull brought us opposite the ehiuigle b^nk^ Iihave spoken of apd, steer- 'in§ s boldly between two' huge toulders that, opened into,^.narrow cove, our boat waV soon gently grating on 'the shelving stonybottom. .„,...,,.. * t After so (inauy hourssitting in a contained portion between the thwarts of "tf ^oafc, exposed to cold arid our feet covered with water, for she leaked so badly that it took us all our time to keep her free, it was only with considerable difficulty.<ind great pain that we contrived t|> 6raWl jfaishore ;; biiit, by chafing our ' stiffened limb! attd iiioVing about'bn the rough shingle, we soon were able to haul up Qtirbpats and to set ahout making a fire, Vhi<:h was'piir first care. Nearly all of us had a e few matches, but they were wet, or at any rate damp, and therefore thoroughly useless ; and it was when we had wasted nearly all of them in vain attempts to strike them, that we awoke to the horror of our position should we fail to succeed in obtaining a light. We found that amongst us we had only seven left, and it was necessary to husband our resources. . We had collected all the dry twigs and leaves we could, biit the larger wood was damp, and an attempt to obtain fire in the aboriginal fashion, by placing the point of a stick in a hole in a piece of wood and twirling it to and fro between our hands, was a failure from this cause. Match after match of the few remaining ones was struck, sputtered, and refused to burn, until we came down to the last. Sick at heart and despairing of soul, I turned away and went behind i projecting ledge of rock, for well I knew what hung on that trifling morsel of wax and wick. A thing worthless in itself, but to us of more value th<*n all the gold that had gone down in the ill-fated ship, yea, than all that lay at the bottom of the sea; for, without food, without fire, what could we do but perish miserably oi cold, even although the raw flesh of such seals as we might be able to kill should save us from canabalism. It was a fearful moment—a moment fraught with such momentous results to all of UB poor wretches gathered round that one last frail means of obtaining fire,light,warmth, life itself, in fact, tHat in my bitter agony I fell on my knees and called aloud to Heaven for inercy in this our time of dire need.—To BE CONTINUED.
