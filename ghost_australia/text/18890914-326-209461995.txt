CAPTURE OF A RUTHERGLEN GHOST. Rutherglen bas always been noted for having its ghost. Several years ago one of these individuals used to make oc casional visits about tbe bridge across the railway, loading to the churches, generally appearing when children and ladies were passing, thus avoiding de- tection or capture. Daring the past three months his ghostship has again made his appearance, and a few Saturday nights back gave a fright to two yonng men while going towards the railway bridge. This success evidently made his ghostship very bold, as he suddenly appeared the other evening at one of the windows of tbe dwelling of the late Semuel Benjamin. Luckily, the occu- pant of the room was a stalwart young m&nf; who, not to be intimidated by the appearance of tbe white vision out- side the window, quietly armed himself with a paling, and suddenly opening the window, sprang through, seizing his ghostship with one hand, and made free use of the paling with the other across bis ghostship's .back, which quickly brought forth the ejaculation, "D — n it, I am not a ghost ; knock off; it is only a lark." These sweet appeals found no sympathy until his ghostship began to smart severely under tbe blows he re- ceived, and upon the table-cloths being removed from his head, revealed the form of » well-known supposed gentleman, foil owing the respectable vocation of a clerk. It is to hoped now that this party has been revealed, these night pranks will he brought to a close, and we compli- ment the young man who unmasked him, but think he lacked a duty to the general public, in not taking bis ghostship to the horse dam at the end of the town and giving him a bath observes the "San."
