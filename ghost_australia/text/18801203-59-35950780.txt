REDRUTH BAZAAR. — The ladies of the Redruth Wesleyan Church opened a bazaar in the Burra Institute yesterday for which they have only been working about four months and yet the display of goods is ex- ceedingly large and various. A flower stall on the platform at the end of the hall also as a thing of beauty and a novelty added con- siderably to the appearance of the whole. At one o'clock on Thursday the. Rev J. Bickford, who had been requested by the ladies to open The Bazaar, did so saying that the history of the Redruth Church and its growth was a very interesting one, and he considered it an honor to have been asked to open this Bazzar in aid of its trust fund. The church had been opened in 1874 having then cost £1460. In 1879 it was enlarged and improved at a cost of £63 11s. 3d. of this all but £500 had been raised. The bazaar was expected to realise at least £100 towards paying this off, and as the ladies had worked so well, he did not doubt but that they would be well patronized and that the sum anticipated would be realized. He wished the ladies every success and declared the Bazaar open. The takings so far have been satisfactory and every one seems delighted with the whole. The Bazaar is to be open again to-day. The following ladies presided at the stalls :— No.1. Mesdames Dnnstan, W. Sara, Gartrell, Woolacott, and Rayner. No. 2. Misses Goss, O'Brien, Elix, Jarvis, and Mands.

The game at present appears slightly in favor of the former, but an exciting finish may be anticipated, especially if Cobb (Aberdeen) continues to bowl as well as he did in the commencement of the second innings. The scores so fir as the game has proceeded, are Burra first innings, 76 ; second with six wickets down 46. Abetileen first innings 42. For Burra, Herbert batted well for 23, as also did Parker for 16 not out. The bowling honors were about equally divided between Roach and Herbert -who did pood service for their club. For Aberdeen Whittick was the only one who got into double figures, his 9M-n- twiner 17. he hrwled well : Cobb also bowled well, rue neiaing 01 uoin warns was very good, Moorhouse (Aberdeen) and Parka (Burra) made two splendid catches. Presestaeion to Mb. Lipsett. — We see by tha^Adelaide papers that an addness was, before^tonr Vist jisBue, ; presented %o Mr. Lipset£^nt!h&occMonttf;%is leaving 'Burra for Adelaide. We had no intimation of the gathering whicluseems to have been kept very quiet, or .we should haye,been present to have obtained a' report. Our attention has been, called to; the fact that the address is stated to have been signed by His Wor ship the Mayor on behalf of the inhabitants.' This is certainly a mistake as the Mayor not being authorised so to trio could not pledge ' the inhabitants' generally to such a docu ment. S. A.N.R.A.
