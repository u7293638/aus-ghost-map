ORIGINAL POETRY. SEPTEMBER ON THE MOUNTAINS. Month whose brow is wreathed with blossoms, fostered by the winter showers, Thou! the virgin of the seasons, bringing fresh and vernal hours; Vivifies Australian nature, bids the lofty uplands ring, Comes across the northern ranges wafted on a radiant wing. Comes and lingers on the mountains, breathes a rich ozonic breath, Beautifies the lonely wild wood, shines in streams that flow beneath; Lends a new life to the landscape—the sublimer feelings bring— Naught can wave transfiguration, like the great magician—Spring. Winter storms have ceased their howling, and no wind with freezing blast, Drives the drifting, drenching torrents, with a strong vehemence past; Shrieking like a pack of demons through the ravines, 'midst the hills, Where the fierce augmented current, dashes forth in frightened rills. Yea! the rage of winter's vanished, and by hill- sides sits the calm, Spirit-like the soul of morning, with its high ethereal balm; As the joys succeed the sorrows, follows spring from winter's gloom— Bright, asthetic, and delightful, by the mountain's floral bloom. Once again the leafless cedar, dons it cloak of verdant sheen— Brings a thought of English winter, 'midst Aus- tralia's glorious green; Ay! it looks so wild and haggard, in its naked- ness—alone, As a ghost from out the norland, mocking in a southern zone. And the graceful "grass-tree" rises, yearly from its calyx, where, Its successor drooped and perished in the plan of Nature's care. Hail September! from the winter, let us greet thy royal face, Let us feel thy regal music, throbbing by this mountain place. HUBERT YOUNG, Fairy Meadow.
