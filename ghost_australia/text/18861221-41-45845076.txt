THE DIVINING-ROD. ' He who limits things by his own narrow sense is i fooL'— Habgkave Jenhihgs. Sir— The increasing attention of science is being given to the-all-important problem of a kind of rapport between hidden springs and having aided Mr. Gerbers gift of this nature to be noticed, but what can aa ever so sincere enthusiast do without the co-operation of lhe daily Press ia matters .where ignorance and prejudice defy all attempts of honest investi gation? I fought ..(foolishly, maybe) for the phenomena of ; spiritualism as revealing hidden springs, of useful knowledge, and feel satisfied- to let the ghosts depart from the - scene, and rejoice in the discovery of springs of quickening water after all fuss. . The monthly. Sphynx, a German journal, seems now the best of all psychological periodicals, and I sent a recent number to Mr. Gerber wherein this divining rod question is thoroughly sifted and the vast importance of this strange faculty of detect-, ing water clearly demonstrated.: I hope Mr. Gerber will utilize this opportune chance of drawing the attention of your readers in all colonies to this momentous fact, which cannot be touched any longer by occasional failures or complicated reRultB of mixed causes. If the preciouB certainty is- established (and itiooks likely to-be) that spriogs will be so discovered, then, our persevering Mr.— K. Evans will, as a good Christian, join in the thanksgiving for extended knowledge and cheerfully forget' his tomfooleries about difficult but benevolent questions, and laugh with me at the London P;RS:, where a woman could for a little while upset 'evi- dences' by thoughtless gossip, and thereby turn the attitude of the august body into ridicule. I loyeaglaBB of crystalline waterafter a round of diverse liquors, aad feel now very happy at the fresh' springs after so many chases of tricky and vexing Bplrits. ; ? .','.'..???
