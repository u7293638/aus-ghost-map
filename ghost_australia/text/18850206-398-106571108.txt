©cctrp. Echoes Ofttijies when Even's scarlet flag Floats from the crest of distant woods, And over moorland waste and crag A weary, -voiceless sorrow broods ; Around me hover to and fro And ghosts of songs heard long ago. And often midst the rush of wheels, Of passing and repassing feet, When half a headlong city reels Triumphant down the noontide street, Above the tumult of the throngs I hear again the same old songs. Rest and Unrest—'tis strange that ye, Who lie apart as pole from pole, Should sway with one strong sovereignty The secret issues of the soul: Strange that ye should hold the keys Of prisoned tender memories. It may be, when the landscape's rim Is red and slumberous round the west, The spirit too grows still and dim, And turns in half unconscious quest To those forgotten lullabies That whilom closed the infant's eyes. And maybe, when the city mart Boars with its fullest,I oudest tide The spirit loses lielm and chart, And on an instant terrified. Has fled across the space of years To notes that banished childhood's fears. We know not—but :tis sweet to know Dead hours still hauut the living day, And sweet to hope that, whan the slow Sure messaee beckons us away, The Past may send some tuneful breath To echo round the bed of death. —L. J. G. in Chambers' Journal.
