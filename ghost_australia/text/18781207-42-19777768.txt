The Cost or Gold ("Sioul ">—Though no doubt a great deal of money ho* been lost by individuals in the search for gold in Australia, still the gold-mining industry has hitherto been and still continues a remunerative one. From the reports of the Mining Departments of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria for 1877 it appears that the gold produced if divided amongst the miners employed woulil give to each man for his year's work as follow*:—In Victoria: alluvial £47 Bs.: Suarts, £139 12*. In New South Walts (nearly one lird being Chinese), £67 11*. 100. In (jaeenaland, per European miner, £171. As, however, the number of miners in this colony is compnted from the miners' rights paid for, and as many of these are held by persons who are not working miners, the average earnings of the men actually employed may be reckoned to be at least £200 a year per head. In Victoria the industry is • becoming leas profitable every successive year, owing to the failure of the alluvial diggings, but quartz mining, there as iv the other colonies, promises to be remunera tive for very many years to come. Expiricxck " (Gympie). — Please excuse seeming neglect. Tour letter was sent to the author of the article criticised for his reply thereto, and by some means it was detained at a country post-office. It has been recovered, and will shortly be published. and Available for Selection ("Wide Bay").—At time of latest returns there were over 3,000,000 acres available for selection at the land offices at Mary borough, Oympie, and Bundaberg.

Another correspondent says:—"The prtmitet •re not termed Scotland-yard; they are situated in Scotland-yard. The term is applied in the same way as is Downing-atreet to various Government departments, the offices of which are then located." It a Lunatic a PrisonerT-"Bushman" says:—"l should like you to ventilate this subject, and answer my question for the benefit of the policemen of this country, who treat unfortunates of unsound mind as though they are felons and prisoners. Is this correct 1 Does the law make any difference between persons of unsound mind variously afflicted 7" Antwer. —Persons of unsound mind are prisoners only in the sense of their being in custody of the police, and should receive at their bands every care and attention compatible with their safe keeping.

Fattening Poultry for Christmas.—"J. B"says:— " I have been making enquiry of several farmers if they intend fattening geese ana ducks for Christmas, by penning them up as is done in England, but every one declines doing so. Can you tell why this is the case? Antwer.—Animals of all kinds suffer by eon inement in this climate; poultry suffer badly from vermin, and soon refuse to eat; they do not fatten. Henoe the feeling against feeding them in confinement Jvt Fishino (" Rook"X—lf th* fish riss to the fly it ia a pretty sure sign they would bite were the bait to their taste. As you do not mention the kind of fly used, we can only suggest that other designs be tried. The whiting of our coast waters is a game little flab, that takes shellfish and other baitsreadlly. As good a tast for bait as any is to open a few fish and see what they have been eating. The Rino Finger.—"One Interested"asks: "Doesthe law specify upon which anger the marriage ring must be placed f would it alter the conditions of marriage if the ring were not placed on the fourth fingerf What is the reason why that finger is chosen ?"—button-.• The law does not interfere with the placing of marriage rings; a woman without hands might be legally married for that matter. Various reasons are given for plaoing the ring on the fourth finger; amongst others it 1* said that it was usual at one stage towards the perfect ceremony of the marriage contract with which we are now blessed for the bridegroom to put the ring to the tip of the thumb with the words, "In the name of the Father," then to the fore-finger, say ing, "and the Son," then the next with, "and the Holy Ghost," and placing the ring on the fourth finger with "Amen." Such a ceremony indicates a degree of equanimity and study of detail that few men of the present day possess. But if the ladies preferred the longer ceremony, no doubt it would be followed even now with all the attendant risks. Vinegar from Grapes ("Middle Ridge ">—Under the circumstance*, the better plan, we should suppose, is to convert the whole making into vinegar; or you might atop the fermentation by the use of sulphur, but that could not improve the quality of the wine. To make vinegar, add half a pint or so of yeast to each cask, and leave the liquor exposed to the air to ferment with the bungs out Land in New Zealand <"T.," Townsvllle). — The prioe of Crown land in New Zealand varies from £1 to £3 per acre.

It is sweet and pleasant in flavor and smell; but we cannot say whether it is a marketable commodity. Potato Bugs ("Practicus"}—See the remarks of " W. K. T." in Quterulandtr of November 23. Ticks (" Squatter"). —1 hare have been several recipes in recent issues for destroying ticks, and in this issue we publish in full the instructions of the Sheep Depart ment for dressing Infected sheep. Weevils in Skins ("8. W.").—Spirits of turpentine in which a bit of gum camphor has been dissolved forms one of the best known means for keeping weevils in check. Selection by a Win: (" Mary") —As the law stands, the selection may as well be given up ; the wife cannot hold it, whether the husband is opposed to her doing so or not " Subscriber."—The conditions required to be fulfilled in order to obtain a certificate under the Homesteads Act of 1872 are (1) three years' personal residence, and (2) the enclosing of the whole area with a good sub stantial fence, or, instead of fencing, the cultivation of one-tenth part of gross area.
