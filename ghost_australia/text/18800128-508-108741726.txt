International Exhibition. There is only a moderate attendance at the Garden Palace this morning, and a lull might fairly be expected after tbe large number of visitors during the past week. Everything 1b in capital order, a,n( it mast bo remembered that, tho horso show will close on Friday. In the Queensland Conrt, two very intarestintr exhibits, lutelv nest to thn Gn.ri1r.Ti PaWn 'by the Hon. A. H. Palmer, Colonial Secretary of Queensland, are attracting much attention. These are two mummies of natives from Nepean Island in Northern Quednxland waters. Those mummies are laid in a lijrht frame of bamboo, and the figures are naked with the exception of an apron. The sockets of tho eves uro filled in with pieces of pearl shell, and the skin has shrunk cloao around tho bones. They were obtained by Mr. Alex. Campbell, who was on board the Queensland Government fiohooner Pearl, in the northern soas, and it itj understood that the bodies were smoked and then dried in the Bun. At any rate, the flesh has apparently quite wasted away. The features are perfect, although distorted from tbe tightening of the ekin. Tho mummicB are con tained in a glass ease, at the eastern end of tho Queensland Conrt, and wo are assured that in thu iastnn«e 'the ghosts do not walk.' ' Wo understand that the officers employed by ths Commiatiuners »f the International Exhibition five a dinner at the Exchange on Saturday, to Mr. D]Ayigdor, private secretary to the Exeoutive Com missioner, in acknowledgment of their good fellowship with, and esteem for, him.
