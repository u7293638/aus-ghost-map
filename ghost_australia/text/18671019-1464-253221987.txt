PUNCH "OUT OP" PARLIAMENT. Mb. Punch has heard that an absurd and totally groundless report — unde derivatur dicere non potest — has obtained that it is no longer his intention to continue his sketches of the follies, and worse, which have, more particularly lately, combined to convert the Legislative Assembly into a human bear-garden. He would simply regard these rumours as emanations from that numerous class whose sole object in life seems to be to mmd everybody s business but their own ; and treat them with the silent contempt they deserve; but that public credulity, if not absolutely illimitable, is remarkably plastic, and "dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds " might be detrimental, in a business point of view, to his interests. For that reason, and for that reason only, he begs to state that the hiatus which have generated this ridiculous hypothesis has been caused, and caused solely, by the indisposition of the unfortunate individual who pre sides over this painful department of the pursuit of fun under super human difficulties — an indisposition which peculiarly unfitted him to wade through the blatant and verbose twaddle and coarseness of the longer debates, or rack his "oppressed brain" into semi- imbecility in trying to raise the ghost of a smile from the flatness and insipidity of the shorter ones. The sketches will be resumed, and penned with the same amount of even-handed justice, and, as far as his ability served, humour, that have characterised them during the many and, to the writer, weary, dreary nights which have been devoted to them in the service of the public. To that public Mr. Punch confidently appeals, believing that his long career has proved his determination to hold the even tenor of his way, and "shoot folly as it flies," undeterred by fear of consequences and unfettered by policy or partisanship. ©$ Verb sap, et stult,
