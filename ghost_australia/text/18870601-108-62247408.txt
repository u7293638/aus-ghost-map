"FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW." BY MISS DORA RUSSELL, Authoress of " Annabel's Rival," "Lady Sefton's Pride," " Craeus' Widow," etc. CHAPTER XILL-(CoatDerD.) "Well," said MIr Wilmot, watching with an amused smile Elizabeth's changing colour and trembling hands as she read this paragraph, "shall I honestly earn a hundred pounds, and give the required in. formation to Messrs Bell and Barclay 1" "You do not know my address, Sir," said Elizabeth quickly and indignantly looking up into his face. "Do I not r' answered Mr Wilmot still smiling. "I trust, Miss Gordon, you are in comfortable quarters at Mrs O'Shee's, number- , Cambridge Street 1" "Then," said Eli-abeth yet more in dignantly, "You must have followed me I" "I plead guilty," replied 3Mr Wilmot "Here is my excuse," and he laid his band lightly on the paragraph in the paper containing Elizabeth's description. " What man of taste would allow such a beautiful picture to pass away from his sight I" For a moment Elizabeth was silent, and then she said in a voice of some emotion "MIr Wilmot, I am alone in the world -I have no one to protect me-do you mean to tell them where Iam l" "IMy dear lady, for what do you take me I No, no, certainly not For reasons best known to yourself you have left your home, and I presume your husband-but I shall not even ask you his name, though I could easily get what information I like by a visit to Gray's Inn. But I will not pay that visit. I shall only ask to be allowed the honour of the acquantance of -shall I say Mis Gron?,a " "But this woman," said Elizabeth nervously, "this Mrs O'Shee, may see this advertisement-" "She may, certainly, but it is not likely. The "Times" is nut a piper generally read by her class. "Still if she did-' "Change your rooms then," said 3IMr Wilmot quickly, "and that will prevent all danger. I know some very nice ones -people who may be depended upon; and if you please' I shall ble proud`'to recommend them to your notice." " You are very good-" "Nay," and thecotldsmoile played again over Mr Wilmot's cold lips, "I am only good to myself, for if you take these rooms, I shalLag.ain, know where to find you." These words recalled Elizabeth's almost scattered senses. " "You are very good," she said again, "but perhaps lihad better stay: where I am." 3Ir Wilmot looked at he'curiously with his acute calm eyes. - - "You mean to leave without telling me I" - " What if I did " began Elizabeth; and then rememabering.hermiserable posi tion, she went on piteously, ''Mr Wilmot,. if you are a gentleman, you will not molest or annoy a defenceless woman." "No," he answered, "I will neither molest nor annoy ya-obut in return will you trust in me a little I" "If you like," said Elizabeth falteringly. "BLt, Mr Wilmot, it is better I should not see you-it is better that we should never meet" - "Why !" ., "There are many reasons," answered Elizabeth earnestly, "one of which is that I am seeking a. situation-another that I am alone in the world." - "The very reason for making an acquaintance." Elizabeth lifted her eyes sadly to his face, and shook her head, "You know the world," she said, "how- apt it is to impute evil how slow to believe in good. I ask you then as an hondurable man not to expose me to its mijust suspicins." - "I know the world," answered Mr Wilmot, slowly, "but I heed it not The old story Miss-may I say Gordon ?-of the man who painted a picture and asked each friend to put a blot on any spot which displeased him, until the who!e canvas was destroyed by his various fault finders, is a true representation of it. What is a fault in one person's estima tion is a beauty in anothers. Thus, if we were to hear the true opinion of friends, we should be all blots-our chief perfections would certainly seem faults to some. No, the world I care to court and lire for, is my own pleasure." " I can scarcely understand any one saying su," said Elizabeth "Not saying so, I believe, but you know many I am certain who do it.". "Perhaps," and Eliiabeth's thoughts went back to Dick's selfish passion- to her own wasted and enmbitteredlife "Don't take me for a monstei.of in-. iquity though, pray," went.on 3Ir Wilmot with a light laugh, "because Iam honest enough to tell you that.when I want a thing I try to get it .It is- every man's creed, Miss Gordon, only'I profess it." " But,"-said Elizabeth hesitatingly and blushing, "our keeping tip our acquaint ance with each other could do no good. I am a married woman, as you know; I am poor and unhappy." " Yet you see I wish to"'keepl yoii ac quaintance, so I try for it," answered Mr Wilmot with another'smile. "But see,". he added, quietly attracting Elizabeth's attention to a policeman who was atten tirely observing them, "yon man in blue with his oiff?icial eye fixed on the tall. straight form described in the "Times.??" The adrertistment" l n' hii"do?bht been read in Modslaad Yad this morning byv many an anxious would-be winner of the hundred pounds. Let "us circumrerit this- especial one though. Allow ine to walk quietly by your side until we reach your rooms, and then permit me to enter the house with you, as if we both be longed to it This will throw the fellow offe the scent, for, believe me, he. fancides that he is on the right track now."' Elizabeth looked at the policeman and then at MIr Wilmot The man as watch ing them, no doubt, and Elizabeth's heart sank within her at the prospect of dis covery-at the dread of once more seeing Richard Horton. " Cime with me," she said faintly, and MIr Wilmot quietly walked down- the street by her side, saying in - the coolest and easiest tone imaginable just as they passed the policeman. " But it will be a horid sell won't it, if it turns out to be scarlat I It plays the very deuce, you know, with young children." CHAPTER XIX.

"but I thank you for your kindness." \--Then I will take my leave," ..ail-Mr Wilmot, rising, for having gained his end, and obtraned an entrance into Elizabeth's rooms, lie was too acute to pay a long visit there. "Take my advice," he went on, "and don't go out for a day or two at least, and if I hear of any more inquiries I will let you know.- And then, with eharaeer istic coolness, he bowed" and took his departure, leaving Elizabeth a prey to the most cruel anxiety. From her melancholy reflections, how ever, she was speedily aroused by a visit from her landlady. "Sure your friend is a foine tall man, mo dear." -aid 3Mrs O'Shee,liarvilgiititledl herself Inf? the roo?f onuithl pgetext ol seeing'if Elizabeth's firs were good; "lIe remojnt" ued, f? e at?e brpthe ow Capt. an' of tohe Dublin Militia.
