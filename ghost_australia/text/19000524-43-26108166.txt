In order to signalise the forty-first year of residence in Ternnsj of, Mr. and Mrs. j John Home, their relatives assembled, toqelher with a few friends, at their resi dence on Monday. The reunion took the' form of a social, and during the evening there wera many reminiscences of old timei.' Mr. and Mrs. Home, who can justly claim to have lived longer in Terai.g than ?ny other of the inhabitants, settled there in 1859, when .there were; very few whit* people in the district. Ihe aboriginals were /Still numerous. Mr. Home identified himself with the estab lishment of the first Presbyterian Church built in the town, and had th? bbnpnr of taking up the first cnllettion/'' When it wai decided to replace the oW building by the handaoma edifice which at presetit exists, Mr. Home also made the last col lection in the old and the first one in the new church. He was one of the first board of managers in the old church, and holds office in the board of managers of the new one. Mr. Home was also elected a memberof the school board of advice when it waa formed, and it is ouly within rscent date that he relinquished the posi tion. He was one of the trustees of the Park committee, and as secretary of the cemetery trustees took great interest in the management. When the Sons cf Temperance was established he threw in his lot with the movement, evincing very i;reat interest in the cause of temperance. He ha? for thirty yeara buen connected with the lodge. Up to within th? last few years Mr. Home, who is 75 years of age, always took an active part in every move ment which was started having for its object the furtherance of the town. It is within Mr. Home's memory when the Terang lake waa many feet higher than it is at present, the water having receded ilowly but i-urely, till now the resideuts n're seriously contemplating, some device to prevent the disappearance of the water altogether. Thx news of the relief of Mafeking wu celebrated in Mortlake on Saturday with great enthusiasm, and the following cable message was despatched to Colonel Baden Powell:—"The Mortlake citizens heartily congratulate you and inhabitants on heroic defence." Peobablt there is hardly a town of ira portance n hick has not had au occasion* experience with a "ghoit," which in variably turua out to bo gome frolicsom individual aeized with a desire to gain little notoriety at the. expense of th timid. Camperdown is at present suffer ing frum the presence of an " apparition. During the past few nights the " ghost' baa been observed—-now in one p*rt o the town and again in anotber —and soiii who have caught sight of it havo bee : more or lesa frightened- The " spectre I made its first appearance last week, whei two ladies suddenly canie in view of a t?i figure, attired in white and having bright light fixed to its budy. They lna no time in hurrying away. The mysteriou une has been several times seen niuce •md although search parties have secrete' themselves in all [sorts of likely placet ready to pounce upon the spectre, the; have so far been unsuccessful iv effectini a capture. The question'as to whetbu the lodging of a charge of shot io the per petrator of the foolish joke would b justifiable homicide is seriously discussed Ix connection with the herd of dairy oowa which Messrs J. G. Johnstone and Co.,in conjunction with Messrs Watt Bros, and Tod, will sell by public auction on the 30th in?t., at Larpent, ou account of Mr A. M'Crae, it may interest those con cerned in dairying to knonr the returns that this gentleman has derived as the result of cheese-making during the past year. The herd consists of 90 cows, and the gross product of milk was 45.277 gal lons, averaging -603 gallons per cow per annum: The net financial results were five .and one- seventh of a penny per gallon, and £10 15s 7 l-5d per cow per annum. This speaks well, not only fur the pasture lauds of the district, buc also for tht quality of. the herd, which are, without doubt, a very Sue lot. The following leases hare been nurren dared:—A.

A reply lihk been forwarded to him, saying that no exact information on that point could bj ob tained, but from statements msde by the enrolling officer* of the contingents and by Colonel Otter it might fairly be hssumed thut nearly two-thirds of ithe men who left Victoria for service in South Africa had been members of the cadet forcer .'. .'"'.'.•,.
