RELIGIOUS SERVICES. CHALMERS' CHURCH. The congregations at Chalmers* Church yesterday were more than ordinarily nume rous, when the Rev. John Murray, from Glasgow, preached the sermons. In the morning the rev. gentleman took his tcxic from Matthew vi , 33, ' Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteous* diss, and all these things shall be added unto you.' In tbe introductory remarks the preacher intimated that no one waB wholly absorbed in the present, the laws of nature indicated that some thought of the future should be taken into account, and therefore the command waB to 4- seek the kingdom of God,' so that they 6hould be able to participate in the kingdom of glory which was set apart for those who had attained righteousucsB by seeking, and joy and pcace in the Holy Ghost. The righteousness referred to in the text was not the mere wordly professions of the same, but the practices of those who wcie referred to by tbe Psalmist as ' all those who have clean hands and a pure heart.' The state of perfection to which a Christian might attain was uot obtained at once, but gradually personal righteousness cleansed the soul, aud faith iu Christ as oat lined in the Scriptures became tbe posses sion of him who had prayerfully sought salvation. The gift of Goi was promised to all who aBkcd for it, t-o that prayer was one of the chief agencies for obtaining true righteousness, and thus a life of perfect hap piness and true freedom. Those who would not seek Christ, or who would not profit by the teachings -of the Bible would be alone to blame if they did not receive the ever lasting pcacc which came by recognising as Master Jisus Christ aud Him crucified. It was impossible to serve two mastcrefaitb fully, and then-fore those who wouhl follow the Scriptural injuoetions could not snrve God and iimmmon. The GrÂ« at Teacher gave several reason* for -Christians avoiiting worldly care, and putting their full trust in Him. The Rev. Mr Murray preached again in the evening.
