THE CYCLORAMA. The introduction of new features in the - entertainment given at the Cyclorama haa caused this already attractive resort to become still more popular, and the attendance on Tuesday evening was very large._ The picture, of the " Battle of Waterloo" gains fre3h inte« • rest with every inspection, and the illustrative leoture by Mr. Lockley intensifies the pleasure of theonlookersin a marked degree. In addition to the illusion, the ghost of Napoleon, which is nightly on view, a novel and deoidedly pretty feature has been added under the some what. alarming title "Hydatapikilumina," or the enchanted fountains oi laughing waters. This consists of a fountain whioh throws 50G jets to the height of 50 and 60 ft., the altitude of the 'water constantly, changing and assum ing new shapes, which with the addition of colored lights has an indescribably beautiful effect. The Cyclorama has hitherto amply repaid a visit, but with the additional attrac tions now offered there is little-doubt that if will be still more , extensively patronised in the futurei.
