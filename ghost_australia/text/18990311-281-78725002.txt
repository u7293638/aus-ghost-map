AN AWFUL SXPERIENCE- Solving a Ghost Mystery. The mystery of a haunted house in South Melbourne has just been solved. Tho residenta bought the house about a mouth back, and on tho first night, after taking possession, were disturbed by the sound of a mysterious voice, which seemed to issue from one of tho walls. Tho voice, heard in tho silent watches of tho night, had a marrow-freezing effect; it was a hol low, awful voice, and sounded like that of a hoarse old man heard through a phonograph. The voico was only heard at nigth, tho words spokun were disconnected nnd jerky, and uttered at long intervals. They had no meaning, and sometimes only a simple swear word was heard during a whole anxious night. The closest investiga tion revealed nothing, and tho phe nomenon might eventually havo been brought under -tho notice of the Phyeehological Society, and have been specially investigated by an emissary sent by Dr. Stead, had it not been discovered by accident that a vener able and disreputable cockatoo, the property of a neighbor on tho right, had discovered a means of making hie way up between tho weatherboards of the walls and tho lining, where he slept every night. Tho dissolute bird talked in his sleep, which explains everything.
