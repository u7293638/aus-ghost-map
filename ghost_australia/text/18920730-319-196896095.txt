The sa<l love in tho Master's oyo : That followed Iho departing form : ' r- Fine ardors quenched in caution cold, Puro dreams that never dawned again— A. plcturo hero, to thrall and hold . The fleoting momory of men, . ! 0 weak and molaiicholy doom, To his young heart's bright festival To bid fair guests and not fliitl room, For the most gracious guest of alb f \- To hail'tliu Holy, greet the Just, -1: ';-. To ask find cr&vo;, and still not stay, Wistful and frank to almost trust, Yet pass to gilded want away I 1 0 boundless misery, dismal fnto Of minds that solf but half subdue. To reach, of loftiest life, tho gate, i And valor lack to venture through; To cheat the infinite dcslro, To halt and falter near tho goal, To kill tlio spirit's mounting fire, To savo tho shadow, lose tho soul! Astory old, yet vital now Tho vision and the voice abldo, ' A. bockoiiing shapo with star bright brow Travels our paltry lives bosldoj . A voico that clear, persistent, low, Softly persuades, and lingers long, ureatnos wnoro the ghosts of beauty grow . From color, music, marble, song; ' Calls in bluo mom's bird echoing air, Murmurs amid tho twilight pinos, "Whispers in sighing stroams, and where Tho rosy globe of sunset chinos ; Speaks from shy blooms in spring that blow, From tho still stars that beam above, From lights in conquering eyes that glow, And the strange ehann of woman's love. For duty's solf forgetful pain, For stainlosH thought, for aurvico high, Still pleads the urgent inward strain While Ono like Qod scorns gliding by. But wo, inditferentj deaf and blind, In mean, contented ways drift on— Somo moment wo shall start, to find The volco hushed, aud tho pilot gono. — Joseph Truman.— Spectator.
