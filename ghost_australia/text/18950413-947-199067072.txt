[?] 'GLADYS.' BtM. M.B. '; ,' . part 1. . ...' /:;'\ A lovely morning in spring, w.hen you seem to see the trees growing, and the flowers opening to the sun-^-all nature is so bright aro.und that' you .always feel a reflection of its warmth in your 'heart, and-'a Bong of 'thanks- giving rises to your lips; for the fact of 1-5-fla o-r^rl +I-10 niaooinrr r\V rrr\r\A ViaolfU 4-j-w enjoy it. ' ; A garden lies before us, eloping gradually to the river, 'and filled with all the sweetest perfumes of bud and blossom— an old-fashioned garden — where the Lent lilies tent their graceful heads, and the tall narcissi shared the honours with monthly roses. : . . ~ ? ? , ? A pretty house, of the cottage type, though built with plenty of space at command, and showing outhouses and stabling in its rear, 'bespoke the inhabitants to be sufficiently blessed with this world's goods to live, in comfort, at any rate, if not in absolute luxury. Seated under a spreading sycamore, with some dainty embroidery in her hand, was a girl of surpassing grace and beauty ; one glance at the pure oval of her face, at the deep grey of her eyes, and the golden brown of her hair, ' sunning over with curls,' to say nothing of her supple figure and taper hands and feet, and you -would not feel surprised to hear, what was indeed a fact, that Beatrice Conway had been ' the beauty,' par excellence, of the last three seasoDs, ? There was, however, a tinge of melancholy in the wistful, droop of her rosy lips, which suggested the fact, that though an heiress, as well as a beauty, she was not entirely happy or free from care. ;: Elitting about from shrub to bush, and from blossom to berry, as fancy alone dictated, and gradually filling the basket she carried- in her hand with all the epoiis of the' garden, was another girl. - '.?',- The two were much alike, but this one was younger, brighter, fairer, Viand evidently happier than her cousin;, o r such was the degree of relationship between the two. , . Beatrice, the elder cousin, was the owner of the pretty cottage,where also dwelt her aunt and co,usin Gladys. An almost sisterly affection existed be tween the two girls. . -C.'- -. ?. Up to the present morn en t Gladys had been the chief spokeswoman, but the conversation had been somewhat desultory and interrupted, owing to the fact that she always found it diffi cult to remain long in ope place, and gathering flowers afbrde/d a splendid exercise for perpetual motion. Now,, however, she came and settled herself on the grass at her cousin's feet, 'and with a little sigh of content began to arrange her spoils. . ';'? Beatrice continued the conversa tion as if no interruption had taken place. ' It is all very fine for you to talk, Gladys, just because you' happen to be engaged to the best fellow in the world — the best 'catch' of the season — a handsome man, and one who. beside all those advantages, is as madly in love with you, : little cousin, as if these were the days of chivalry, and you were an enchanted princess in a Moated castle. He has only one seriouB fault that I know of, and there's no denying that he is fright'1 fully, unreasonably jealous.' 'It's the only thing that prevents our love story being as common place as a cook's or housemaids,' pouted Gladys, 'but I am always hoping that something may turn up to arouse his jealousy, but you know,' confidentially; and with a quaint little sigh, .' I'mjso' dreadfully in love with him, that' I don't think it ever can, for, Beatrice, I'm sure I could neverr.giVe him even, the slightest cause-1—' , i i'jOb^jealous people don't wait for cause,' interrupted her cousin; but I trust you will never find this out, Gladys.' .'I don't mean to deny that I'm a very lucky girl,' continued Gladys, as if she had not heard, or, at any rate, heeded the interruption, and holding up a bunch of creamy roses to see how thev harmonised with her cousin's dress, and fastening them in. her brooch in a kind of parenthesis, ' or that Claude is cot the best and dearest fellow in the world, beside being, I know, quite too good for me ; but I am sure, Trixy,' coaxingly look ing up into the elder girl's face to try to get her to agree, 'it would have been much wiser and much - more romantic if he had happened to be an artist, and worn a velveteen coat, and 'Yes,' laughingly , - yes, my dear coz, much more romantic, but not one half so convenient. It was because my lover, Denzil de Lisle, was poor, that Aunt Catherine forced me to reject him. Don't ever think, Gladys my dear,' speaking very tenderly, 'that the most romantic surroundings can ever reconcile you to say good-by to one whom you truly love. I shall never forget Denzil, and if only I could see him once again I could then die happily.' '.'?'.??''' ' Nonsense, love,' said Gladys, put ting her arms round her cousin, and kissing her affectionately,, 'don't talk about dying in 'this glorious weather; let's think of 'something' happy and bright, like the.sunshine,' gathering all the flowers into a big bunch. ' Claude said he'd be down about twelve, and take us both up the river fishing. Yes, Trix,' as you say, I'm a lucky girl, and after bearing your sad romance, I ;dpa't think I shall ever want one of 'my own ; but, still, you must allow that poverty — mind, poverty without rags, I distinctly object to rags — poverty is so much more -romantic than having all the luxuries of life and a few over. ' My dear Gladys, I trust you will always have them ; you were made for thei sunshine. I can't imagine you with a great sorrow, or even a great love, although doubtless you'll go through life quite respectably without either.' This was said in a jokibg manner, but when Beatrice saw the rosebud mouth beginning to pout and the brown eyes fill ' with' tear.*, she drew her cousin tenderly to her side, and finished in quite a serious manner. 'Gladys, darling, whenever I look at your bright face and think of your happiness, I always feel so thankful you are able to marry the. first man you ever cared for, who is in every way worthy of you — you musn't mind me, dear. You will understand now why I am sometimes sad and melan choly. I am going into the house; fib all I bring your hat, dear ? '. ' Yes, or a sunshade, or something to keep one from being burnt black as a crow.' 1 That wouldn't be at all romantic, would iy.Gladys ? ' 'No,' with a merry laugh, 'not at all and I don't think Claude would like a blackamoor for a wife, dear Trixy,' watching the giaceful. figure till she disappeared into the. cottage,. ? Well,I don't wonder at men falling in love with Beatrice, I should myself ; it's quite a delight to me to watch her face, and I'm not a man, or I suppose it, yvbuld be more so. I'm quite proud to be her cousin, and for people;:,to pretend that they see a ? family like ness between us is certainly ivery amusing. I would do anything ill the world tor her — only I'm awfully {glad Claude didn't like her best, because; I don't think I could give him up, eyen to Beatrice. But,' with a puzzled look, 'if he had liked her best, I 4pn'fc suppose I should have had anything to do with it. Well,' with a shake' ; of the head, ' I don't know anything about that;all I know is, that it '.would break my heart to part with him. Now, if he had been poor, I could have proved mv devotion by — ' ?'?- ? But the rest of her meditations were cut short by a hand being laid over her eyes. With a little shrielt of pretended dismay, Gladys jumped 'up, scattering her flowers to right~and left. Her face looked very rosy as she hastily released herself: and stooped to pick up the blossoms, exclaiming in tragic tones — ; , V ' Oh, Claude, how you frightened me!' ? ?:?-.? ' Frightened you, sweetheart ? 'Why, what a clumsy brute I must be. But there, never mind those flowers, Lady bird, I'll take good care nobody ; else frightens you while I am' here.1 : , ^ He took her in his arms an.d,r bestowed a dozen kisses on her jigs, He is a stalwart figure, of six feet, one or two, clad in the lightest of tweed suits. His big blonde beard arid flaxen hair shone like threads pf. gold in the sunshine. His blue eyes Rested with deep love and admiration onthe dainty figure he held in his arms.', ; ; After a few minutes, given, to.lover like demonstration he ' Beated. himself on the grass beneath' the shady tree, and drew Gladys down' by his' side , possessing himself of one' small hahd. ' And now tell me what you were talking about when I came.1 ,;.,'; Gladys'Dlushed a sudden fiery'- red as she recollected the wish that- was on her lips. : . ;? '' ^ ; i - Talking ! Was I talking ?

' -; ~ ' Nonsense, Claude,' said 'GUdys, laughing in spite of herself, ' 'as ifpite could make love to order, like a dre^s,. or a coat, or boots.' . . ',.;!.. ' Well, nonsense or not, priyate theatricals are the very mischief and put nonsense into girls' heads, ,.1-hate all such exhibitions !' ' :. ,.. ?
