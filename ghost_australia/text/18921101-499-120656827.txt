SAILING NOTES. 1 ?^ ... DOUBLE BAY REGATTA. (Bl '1UCIST.IT.') This roggatta is always tho first, aquatic oveutof the season, taking place on tho last, Saturday in October, which was the 29th ult., and everything wont off woll, and anothor most successful day has been addod to tho long list of regattaa held in Double Bay. This is greatly duo to tho ouorcics of the lion, soo., Mr. Goorgo Heliings, and uon. treasurer, Mr. F. C. Eaton, who worked very hard to raakn it tho success it. wan. Tho committee also woh a very influential one, who, one und all, gavo their heip to tho affair. Tho officers were :— Sailing races : .Starter, Mr. H. Oatloy : judges, Mofflrs. H. C. Stookham and E. F. Jones. Howiug races : Sttirtor, Mr. J. H. Myors ; judge, Mr. AV. Woods; umpire, All-.. John Blaitkman. It is needless to say Unit those gentlemen carried out their respoctivo duties in a most nutisfuctory manner. The day was all that could be desired, oicopt that perhaps tho light ensWrly breeze which was blowiiif; was not quito strong enough for tho sailing races, but Butted tho pulling fraternity nicely. Until last year's regatta, hard bruozos were tho order of tho day, generally from tho north-east, which qUartor Doublo Hay is much exposed. Last year tho wind was from nearly tbo sums quarter us it was on Saturday, but unfortunatoly did not last as long, tuo consequence heiut; that several of tho sailing races woro not liniauod. The fiuo steamer Now castlo was placed at tho committoo's disposal for a llagship, and a right good ono she made ; and Captain Skinner and his officers did all they could for tho visitors. Sho was moored inuoh further up tho bay tiian hovetofore. Vassie, uduod in no small degree to tho amuaeinontof tbe afternoon. Tho South Slioro Steam Ferry Company conveyed tho visitors from Circular Quay, mulling at frequent in torvals, and each trip being woll filled. Several people wore left on Elizabeth Bay and Darling Point wharves through tho steamer not calling, although advertised to do ?.o. Another btoamor waH kept constantly cm ployod oor.veyinsr passengers from the Double Bay wharf, whilst a well-filled steamer fol lowed each of tho rowing- races, which wore well contested. An nufortunato error crept into tho report in tha StWDAY Tjjies, when it waa stated that the Tub Race was won by AV. Stannard, whereas it should havo been J. Hollings, who Bcnllod a vory good race from start to finish. It is to bo regretted that no yachts entered for the Yacht Kace. This certainly does not look like much advance ment in yachting, tn tho race for 2i raters only tho Norna entorod, but tho Louelle came forward later on, but after the programme, had been fixed, so it was agreed that tboso two yachts woro to havo a private race, under the anspinos of tho rogattn. committeo, which resulted iu a vory tamo. affair, tho Norna beating her oppouont by about fifteen minutes, the Louolle not carrying sufficient sail for the light day. There was also another race that fell through, viz., tlmt for residents of Pad dingtou and AA'oollahra, iu lona-ftde watermen skiffs, doublo sculls, the only entry boiug Messrs. T. Strottlen and W. Stannard. Tho prizes wero good and numerous, several races havinj four prizes allotted to them.
