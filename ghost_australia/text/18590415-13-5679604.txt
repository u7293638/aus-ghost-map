THE BIRMINGHAM " TICKET." [ THE SATURDAY REVIEW, JANUARY 8.) Mr Bright has appealed to the parish, mm gun the parish he shall go There is no longer any use in expressing surprise at the ignorance of this Gentleman The sentiment of astonishment is So much is soon exhausted in the presence of the strangest spectacles, and in time one becomes "situated even to the incredible blundering of a íni-iL'0-nie But for this we might have thought worth while to dwell at some length on the wonderful exposure with which the able and in S'" speech of Mr Moncrieff has furnished in of the fundamental ignorance and miss epre citation on which the superstructure of the west Birmingham scheme of Reform has been built up It appears from this conclusive demon Zt2 that % Bright is as profoundly 11 informed in regard to the affairs of Scotland as he is about English institutions more he could not be Indeed, his folly seems "actly commensurate with the wisdom of Solomon it extends " from the hyssop which groweth on the sea", to the cedar which protects on labours " From Parliament to the vestry- room the parish to the empire-his unscrupulous ignorance ranges with comprehensive incapacity and the more we examine his asser- tions and his schemes, the more we begin to doubt whether it may not, after all, be possible to absolve his honesty at tho expense of his in tC\s\\\an the notable proposal of the parish franchise was first launched, we pointed out the startling contrast between the practice which Mr. light professed to take as his model and the democratic principles in support of which such a precedent was alleged Apiactical inquiry at the real operation of the parochial franchise, which the Birmingham agitator, appealing to the a experience of the past, ' has so highly eulo used ns-'afrmchiso with a Inch everybody has been, contented, which nobody has condemned, and which has done no harm to law, or order, or the security of property, leads beyond all manner of doubt to a conclusion the exact opposite of that which Mr Bright reduces it to support the parish suffrage is far more liberal, more equal, and more just than the electoral franchise, says this well informed politician I am proposing no innovation, I only ask you to adopt that which already exists and which experience has proved to be both safe and satisfactory This is what offor you, because, while it is consistent with good government and the security of property, it will give you a great increase in the electra no body ,? This is the substance of Mr Bright's argument, founded on his famous precedent We have already examined at some length the accuracy of his information, and the conclusiveness of his logic We have shown that this precious specimen of ratiocination was deliberately conceived, publicly propounded, and three times repeated, in absolute ignorance of the fundamental fact that the governing principle of the parochial franchise is plurality of votes, by which property is carefully protected against the tyranny of a numerical majority But we are supplied with a still more instructive illustration of Mr Bright's political capacity and statesmanlike acquirements, on the unquestion- able authority of the Manchester Guardian li the failure of Newall s buildings knows nothing) ' of anything else, he might at least be expected to know something of Manchester , but it seems that, in fact, he knows just as little of Manchester as of anything else It is as from a Man chester platform that he deliberately proposed to substitute the actually existing parochial fian close for the present electoral system All he wanted was, that members of Parliament should be elected by the same constituency which " the Legislature had established for the Poor Law Unions ' Let us see what it as the state of this model constituency at the moment that Sir Bright was haranguing in the Free Trade (Hall We learn from the Manchester Guardian that, while the Parliamentary constituency of the township of Manchester amounts to LOANS, the number of persons entitled to vote under the Poor law franchise does not exceed 8,000 When we remember, in addition, that this diminished constituency is organised on the system of plurality of votes, we are in a position to estimate the impudence and the ignorance of the man who had the face to stand up in Manchester itself and propose the introduction of the parochial franchise as a radical substitute for the Parliamentary suffrage, which he judiciously designates as a " deliberate fraud' " We have tried it here," he says in our parish union , " and he adds elson here" I venture to say that the experience of the past in our parishes and in our Poor Law Unions, has sufficiently demonstrated that, to that extent at least the people of England may be fairly and safely entrusted with the right of electing members to the House of Commons " This, then, is the euthanasia of the great scheme of democratic Reform This is the tt well considered and deeply matured plan of the pro found and sagacious politician who "does not come to speak simply the temporary p ission and sentiment of the hour, and who has a " deep sense of the responsibility under which over a man ought to speak who offers himself as the ex- pounder of the opinions or the guide of the deliberations of his countrymen Certainly the enfranchised classes of Manchester have found an admirable " guide for their deliberations in the great Radical re former of Birmingham Let them compel Par- lamentably persuasion if they can, or by brick bats if they can t- to embrace in its integrity the Birmingham programme, and what would be the result ? Why, simply to disfranchise one fourth of the existing constituency of Manchester, and to give to one sixth or possibly to one twelfth, of that diminished constituency an equality of votes with the whole of the remaining numerical masonry Such is the ultimate product of the profound sagacity, the cost of the study, the la borious information, of our infallible demagogue, who never changes his opinions and novel alters his plans Mr Bright has taunted Mr Newde- gate with the democratic tendency of his reasonings ; but the member for Warwickshire might retort on his critic that he is the apostle of a reaction such as Colonel Sibthorp himself would hardly have ventured to propose The joke of the great mob orator of Radical Reform bringing forward a scheme which would decimate twice over the constituency of Manchester, and give the owners of property a preponderating vote 111 the poll booth, is enough to make old Sir Charles Wetherall shake his sides with laughter in his grate The ghosts of the boiouglimongers of former days must troop round Sir Bright with benedictions in his dreams, and the spirit of the late Mr. Croker must haunt, with lingering regret, the last impersonation of a retrograde Toryism Of course it will be said, " Mr Bright did not mean anything of the sort " We know that perfectly well But it is just the fact that he does not know what he means that constitutes line the demagogue he is, instead of the states man which be possessed the ability, but wanted the character, to become no had quite sharpness enough to know that it was a great point, in addressing a practical and, on the whole, a prudent people, to be able to appeal to borne example sanctioned by experience -some precedent which the Constitution had approved In his shallow and reckless charloUnism he thought he had found a pattern which would serve his turn and so he produced on the platform in this egregious blunder as a well matured and considered plan No doubt he imagined that he was proposing some very democratic and sw coping change when he declared his intention to substitute the parochial system for the existing electoral franchise It is more nonsense to say that what he intended was to adopt a restricted mileage, only without its restrictions if the Emperor of the French proclaimed to morrow that he intended to establish in France the system of Government which exists in England, and with which everybody has been contented, Milich nobody has condemned, which has done 110 harm to law, or order, or the security of property)," and if the day after he there to explain that it was true he had promised to copy the example of England, only he did not intend to auto any Parliament-that he meant to baton Constitutional Monarchy, only it has not to be limited-that, in short, he meant to have perfect freedom only so long as it did not interfere to 5th absolute despotism we should know what to think both of his sincerity and his wisdom Those apologists of Mr Bright who pretend that when 10 recommended the existing parochial constituency as a model he meant the parcel vi system apart from all the characteristics which distinguish it from any other system, make him out to be something worse than a fool they impute to him the knowingly and wilfully no committed a species of moral forgery lit appealing to an authority to Inch he knew to be adverse, and that he was guilty of a conscious india upon an ignorant audience, by imposing upon them a precedent which he know to he de 2 w T not 80 land on st. right in 'his friends We do him the justice to believe that he was quite as ignorant of the matter which he was talking about as the mob which he was addressing Wo belief 0 that he knew as little as they that his great scheme of Radical Reform Allie to exchange the liberal Constitution "it / , great Consort above system which (Li? found in the country. When the real Scheme! to be known, the "magnificent Tf?"'y.,»1 Manchester (as Mr Bright pompously calls it) turns out to be a caricature fit for the pencil of Hogarth The spectacle of an im nZ J MCtme cocaine to the echo the cham Frere 1 PeoPle who is actually proposing to disfranchise them must have been an excellent run Vessey first, wife had the wit to unriddle the true secret of the Birmingham programme th0fc?T_deyt4¿* "»»"*% illustrative both of AIT" ""'chillies cooperate It shows being cheated as to cheat, Mr. Disraeli has been suspected perhaps not without reason of an intention to produce a Reform Bill which, while affecting to be framed on Liberal principles, shall be cunningly contrived to promote the triumph of the Tory party. Now that may be we know not, but we are very sure that there is no Tory Government infatuated enough to propose a scheme be nakedly and undisguisedly reactionary as that which Mr. Bright in his wisdom has concocted for the behoof of the Radical Reformers. The very grotesqueness and comicality of these inconsistencies are the true stamp of your genuine demagogue. They are familiar traits of a well known character. The genius of Shakspeare is seen in nothing so much as in the immortality of the types which his knowledge of human nature enabled him to mould. We pay a fresh tribute to the living truthfulness of his art as we recognise the profundity of Jack Cade reproduced in the sagacity of John Bright.
