AN " EXTORTED" EXPLANATION. (To the Editor of the Bendigo Advertiser.) Sir,â€”I am pained to see that a somewhat in considerate expression which, fell from me in a de- bate at the Board on Wednesday last, and which applied solely to a sustain, should have been self- appropriated by your lady-correspondent, to whom I beg to apologise, through your columns, for my unintentional lapsus lingua. I will not waste my time nor your space by en tering into the merits or demerits of badgering public bodies (with the most benevolent motives,) for donations which we are told should be made " without the left hand knowing that which the right doeth." In fact, the nervous and sleepless state into which Mrs. Caudle's lecture has plunged I me, totally unfits me for such a duty, and leads me deeply to sympathise with the ghost of the departed martyr of Punch and Douglas Jerrold. Simply repudiating, therefore, the idea of having wished personally to offend that estimable and somewhat excitable lady, by any observation made by me during the debate in question, I am your obedient servant, D. J. MERINGTON.
