The Origin of Religion. The origin of religion has long been a difQcult; problem, and ia likely to remain obscure for sonne time yet. The germ; according to Tylor,.'lies in the belief in spiritual beings ;. Lippent finds it in the worship of the soul. Herbert Spencer has stated that ancestor worship is the root of every religion, and again that there is strong warrant for the inference (that ghost-propitiation ls the origin of all religions. C L. Henning attempts in "The American Anthropologist" to solve the question from quite. another standpoint. "All the investigators in the field, without exception, have neglected one principal factor in their respective researches-the economic conditions. Primitive man had no religion; this was the product of much later times, and did not arise from a so called "religious sentiment." A system of social virtues, or, in other words, a primitive social morality, was early developed owing to men being united in hordes; but this has nothing to do with religious perceptions. A man who during his life ameliorated the economic conditions of his tribal companions was not forgotten after his dearth; of this there are innumerable past and present ex- amples. Such men, after their death, became heroes or benefactors of their respective tribes. The veneration they enjoyed during life changed; after their death into ancestor worship, and later on into soul worship; (the two latter forma of worship are the beginning of the historical evolu- tion of religion.
