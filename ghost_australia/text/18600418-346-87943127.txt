[ Advertisement.] MR. M'INTOSH'S INSOLVENCY, (To the Editor of the Bendigo Advertiser.) . Sir,-I beg to deny in* to/o the statement of Jas. M'intosh as to his connection with me being the cause of his failure. I have in my possession vouchers to prove the ver}' contrary. I never (since he joined me, more than two years ago) have received the ghost of a sixpence out of the concern, as the bills and decision of the arbitrators can amply testify. I remain, yours, &c.;, JAMES WARDEN. 17th April, J8G0.
