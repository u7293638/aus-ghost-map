A True Ghost Yarn. "I was spending Christmas on a farm near Gawler," said Blodgers, 41 and imagine my joy when they showed me into a bedroom which they said had the reputation of being haunted, because some old woman had taken rough on rats there and had passed away to starland after an inef ficaceous application of a stomach pump.' I wasn't afraid of ghosts, and as it was mighty hot I left the door, which led into the yard, open. I am a i ood sleeper, and as soon as the farmer's eldest daughter had left off singing 1 Annie Rboney' I fell asleep. I awoke with a starts at midnight with a sensation as if liquid fire were eoursing through my veins. It was horrible. It seemed as if I were being torn to pieces with red-hot pincers, and there at the foot of the bed I could juso discern a shadowy form of most fantastic proportions." Here Blodgers paused for effect, while the women huddled together, and the men, with their pipes out of their mouths, mur mured with hot, dry lips, "Go on." " Well," said Blodgers, " what do you think it was ? Nothing but the family goat, which hsd wandered into the room and taken a fancy to my right big toeâ€”mistook it for a stick of asparagus, I reckon." There was a dead pause, and then one of the men, after trying vainly to expectorate, remarked, 11 Well, that's the sickest ghost yarn I ever struck, and I move we fine him drinks round." And Blodgers-had to part up.
