TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 1887. Politicians expect that the session which will commence today will be by no means of a quiet and unevent ful character, and politicians ha\o means of ensuring the íealisation of then predictions 'Iho programmes which His Excellency the Go\no.oR will bo invited to unfold in the Council Chamber this afternoon ii not likely to bo of a sensational type, but that is no îeason vvbj the proceedings of tho j ear should not be very lively indeed On tho contiaiy, the moderato programme may facili tato tho designs of those bon members who desno stinmg and stoimy scenes When a Government has a causo to champion, it may relj upon its adhci outs oveilool ing most things, if not all things, but when there is mci o casual work to porfoim, tho opportunity occurs foi cavilling and criticism and for breal ing awav And tho second session of a Ministry is alwajs J. critical period In its hist session i Government can rely upon the cry 01 tho necessity that brought it into existence, and in tho third session tho fear of a dissolu tion weighs upon members and tells against an intrigue, but tho second session is tho betwixt and between period 'J bus it is that the hopes of the Opposition run high that tho uuex peeled will nippen Iho programmo itself is not likely to justify a formal amendment Any definito statement about the unfortunate i ail way disaster at Prahran would bo challenged no doubt, whatever it might bo, but the coroners inquest is not jet concluded, and consequently all that Ministers can say in rcferenco to the subject is that the cuises of tho collision will be-aio being-uçorously inquired into Kcpoit has it, howc\ei, that tho Opposition will tako advantago of tho unhappv incident to attack the existing lailwaj 8)stem, and tho oulv doubt is whether thev will proceed by an amend mont moved upon the addiess or by a specific i «solution The collision is iho ono cloud upon tho history of tho îecess In rehearsing what has occuned sinco tho Houses wero pío îogued, His LNCLLLLNC. will have many subjects for congratulation, including the success of tho Impeiial Conference, tho initiation of an expérimental irriga lion colon,, and tho favourable lesult of

Captain Allbeury was an old colonist having been superintendent of the Sailors' Home for 21 years, and he, in fact, took charge very shortly after the insti- tution was founded. Prior to that he com- manded vessels in the intercolonial shipping trade, where he first engaged as mate, and still further back had experienced the vicissi- tudes of a gold digger in the days of the sen- sational new rushes.

G. Fitz- gibbon, town clerk of Melbourne, expressing the desire of the council of the City of Mel- bourne that each corporate body in the colony should contribute the sum of £15 towards the cost of a statue of the Queen in Melbourne, the council unani- mously voted the sum required. The Richmond City Council wrote to suggest that the five southern metropolitan munici- palities should unite in preparing a joint con- gratulatory address to Her Majesty on the completion of the 50th year of her reign. As the Prahran Council had already decided to prepare a separate address for presentation to His Excellency the Governor, the proposal could not be entertained. The amount col- lected in Prahran for the Bulli Fund was announced by the mayor to have been £242. The deputy Postmaster-General wrote stating that in future the practice of making one letter delivery on New Year's Day and the Queen's Birthday would be followed, the ex- periment of omitting the delivery having proved unsatisfactory. The council passed a resolution authorising Councillor John Turner to represent the council of the city of Prahran at the opening of the Adelaide Exhibition.
