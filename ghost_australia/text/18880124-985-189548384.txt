POETRY. The Bosebud. The girl stood by tbe brook side In tbe morning of life and of June ; She bent her fair head to hear when a tread ■■ ■ Blent with the rivulet's tune; And as she listened she gathered A rosebud that bloomed at her side, Played a moment there with the blossom fair, Then flung it into the tide. Flung it down and forgot it; For, as it drifted away. The step that for her life's pulse would stir, Bang on the winding way; And what in the passionate gladness Of the meeting of youth and love. Was the rosebud the less for the wind's caress Or the boughs that clustered above ? One night in the dripping autumn When she knew that her joy was naught. When she knew she was left, of her hope : bereft, 'Mid the wreck her summer had wrought, She thought of the rifled rosebud, And wept for it, tossed to the stream, To drift, smirked and torn, to its doom forlorn, like the ghost of her fair false dream.
