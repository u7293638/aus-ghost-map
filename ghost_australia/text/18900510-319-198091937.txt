SELECT POETRY. OUR LADY'S PENITENT. founded on a' medieval legend, They hanged him high on a withered tree On the wasteland baro and black ; Polo in the dusk they turned to fieo And nover a soul looked back. Muto they fled from the place of dread, But each in his heart mAdc moan ; c,0 if s up and uway from yon gallows grey Ere the foul fiend claim his own 1 Bobber, murderer, beast of prey, Fell as the were-wolt's race, None dared stay in the silence grey To look on that dying face. None dared hide while the death gasp died On the lips foredoomed to Hell ; Yet all the days of his dark life through Had he loved Our Lady well. Still from his spoil would ho choose the best Of glittering gold and gem, To hang in worship across her breast, Or lay at her garment's hem. .And all nightlong, twixt the man and Death, She hovered in glory there, And held hlin up in his living breath With her long bands thin and fair. .< All night long did she hearkenâ€” yea, Till liis evil soul was shriven : She loosed his hands with the dawn of day Leaden and stark swung the lifoless clay, But the ghost fled forth forgiven. -By Graham R.
