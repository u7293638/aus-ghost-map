h' A FICULIAR INTERVIEW. John Solomon, Esq., through greatly pres sing business one evening last week, had to return to his office in the city in order to ravel out some very intricate accounts.-"He had brought in -with him a bottle of J.D.K.Z., and was combining business with pleasure in a most satisfactory manner. . While wearily clambering up a column of figures which might have puzzled a Mirams, and at the same time imbibing a heavy draught of the " needful," he felt upon his check tho touch of something that Beaned to cling to the skin like thc carcase of a naked oyster. With great presence of mind he setdown the bottle, and the nddition so far ns he had proceeded with it, and looked up. " I beg your pardon, sir," Baid he ; " but I think you have come to the wrong place." , "Why, John," replied the figure, whom there is no need to describe; " don't you know me J " ... .' . ' - " Well, now.I look at you," returned John; " I confess there is something familiar about yOU." .'..-... ' ?>> , " John," rumbled the apparition, as a look of displeasure crossed his ghastly features,! " you're foolin," ? " No, I'm not. ,* I'm quite serious ; .but what is your name Î " ... ,, ..;ti -::<, ,,Tho mysterious party sank uninvited.into.a chair, and stared > blankly at the ceiling. Perceiving that his guest was making, him self fairly comfortable, Mr. Solomon turned again to his figures, and pushed the bottle further under thetable. . , ,. The fire in thc grate burned slowly, and now and again let out a flicker as if it could have done more if.it wished... Tho, Dutch clock looked wise, and swung its'.pendulum with studied accuracy, like one determined to do its duty and no. more. The.' bottle be neath the table, assumed an attitude of ele gant indifference. , , -.?--,:.?> After some minutes of silence the spectre turned towards his host, and reniarked, ; ¡ , " John, I'm yer dead father.,,.
