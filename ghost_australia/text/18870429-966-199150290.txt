WEST AUSTRALIAN PEARL FISHERY. DESTRUCTIVE M I - CANE. 553 UftS LOST. FORTY VESSELS DESTROYED. [By Telegraph.] Perth, April 28. A great calamity happened to the pearling fleet on the aorth-weat coast last Friday. The fleet, which was lying off the Eighty-mile Beach above De Grey River, consisted of a great number of boats. A hurricane struck the fleet, and a terrible scene ensued. All the boats were, damaged. Over forty were lost or driven to sea. Most of the forty boats were sunk, bat it is believed that some drifted to sea mastless. The crews of these are -ohort of provisions. It is estimated that 550 lives have been lost. Bodies are seen floating about in all directions. Many have been washed ashore. A great quantity of wreckage has also come ashore. Boats have been Bent to search for the drifting craft. The s.s. Australind is to he sent out by the Government. The affair has created a great sensation here. LATER. The following information was posted at tiie Telegraph Office, Adelaide, on Friday morning :—The Australind, from Singapore, which arrived at Cossack on April 28, confirms the news of the terrific storm on the pearling grounds. She reports that thirty-seven lives have been lost, while 400 men are missing. The following information as to the pearl fishery of Western Australia will be found interesting. It is taken from the Australian Handbook" for 1887:— " The pearl fishery year by year becomes of more value to the colony. The value of shells exported in 1872 was £25,890, against £12,895 worth exported in the previous year, and the estimated value of pearls and pearlshells sent from the colony in 1874, representing the take of the season, was about £72,162. The exports for the following years were—1875, £65,000 ; 1876, £74,143; 1877, £12,450 ; 1878, £24,000; 1879, £96,525; 1880, £40,710 sheila, £12,000 pearls; 1881, £34,912 10s. shells,£12,000pearls; 1882, £37,870 shells, £17,500 pearls. In 1883 the take of pearlshells for the season was about 619 tons, at an estimated value of £32,000, and pearls £17,500. In 1884 this industry, principally due to the epidemic of measleB among the natives, fell to 110 tons pearlshells, valued at £15,000, and pearls to the value of £10,000. In 1885 the take amounted to 284 tons, valued at £41,216 5s., and pearls valued at £15,000. In addition there were exported 465 tons of Shark's Bay shells, valued at £2,280. These values are, however, estimated upon somewhat uncertain data. It is probable that the stated value of pearls exported exceeded this amount. The aboriginal natives are now almost exclusively employed in diving, the cost of introducing the Malay divers being too great. There were thirty-two licensed vessels. The value of shells in the colony averages from £5 10s. to £8 per cwt., or even higher. These shells, the home of the meleagrina margaritifera, weigh on the average about 2 lb. per pair, and measure from 6 to 10 inches in diameter. It is to the intrinsic commercial value of the shells rather than the pearls they contain that the northwest fisheries owe their importance; although, occasionally, pearls of considerable value are obtained—one supposed to be worth upwards of £1,500 was found in 1875; in 1878 one was found weighing 40 grains at Shark's Bay, and another one weighing 234 grains, obtained at Nicol Bay, realized £715. In July, 1883, an extraordinary pearl, or mass of pearls, was found at Nicol Bay. It was composed of nine pearls about the size of peas, firmly embedded together in the form of a perfect cross. A lucrative pearl fishery exists in Shark's Bay. In 1882 a rich bank of pearlshells some 15 miles in length was discovered in the vicinity of Beagle Bay. The shells found in this region are those of the true pearl oyster, the avicula margaritifera, an oysLer only slightly larger than its European congener, and valuabla from the pearlB it bears. The shells have been introduced to the European and Indian markets, but have assumed no considerable commercial value as yet" A PECULIAR KNOCKING.—Our Cradock correspondent writes on April 26 :—" A mysterious ghost story comes from near Yanyarrie, about 17 miles from Cradock, and is creating a sensation here. It appears that at the nouse of a farmer named Hamdorff during the past several weeks an unaccountable knocking has been heard at various parts of the building. On Monday night Mounted-constable Mitchell, accompanied by Messrs. H. Hayward and A. J. Graham, proceeded to the place determined to thoroughly investigate Ithe matter. It was a dark and lonely drive, and the party arrived at the houEe about half-past 8, and found the place a pine-and-pug tenement on the banks of the Boolcunda Creek, about 30 yards from a waterhole. The proprietor haid left for Quoin, taking with him his wife and a little girl about 7 years old, who, they thought, had seemed to attract the knocks, as they stated the noises had almost invariably proceeded from that part of the house in which the child was at the moment. Two boys, aged about 14 and 9 respectively, were keeping house, and the party, in merry incredulity, ate their provisions, let the fire go down, and about 9 p.m. blew out the light, the boys having told them that the " ghost" appeared soon alter the light was extinguished. \V ithin two or three minutes two of the party heard a low distant sound as of a splash from a heavy stone dropped into a pool of water, followed by footsteps, immediately auc cteded by a distinct knocking at the outside of the chimney. Two at once went outside, but could see nothing (it W*B a very dark night), but heard the knocking on the inside. The knocking was as loud and distinct as an ordinary knock at the door. After a few minutes Mr. Mitchell went outside, and Messrs. Hayward and Graham took his place inside, but to each the knocking appeared to pioceed from the other side of the wall. They asked various questions, which were replied to by knocks, and on one of the party asking the knocker to ' knock louder' the next snook the building. After nearly an hour's duration the noise ceased about 10 p.m., and the party soon after proceeded ts * camp' but not to sleep. About 2 a.m., their nerves having become somewhat calmed, they would toon have been asleep, but the sune sounds recommended, and continued till nearly 3 a.m., when the 'supernatural visitant' decamped, leaving no trace behind. During the second visit they each went round and round the house in turns, but to no purpose, though the knocking was heard at almost every part, and several times so sharp as to make the building tremble. Many of the neighbours and residents of Carrieton attest the reality of the sounds. Of course there are incidental rumours afloat of a shepherd drowned near the spot many years ago and of a flitting form having been observed by people out at night horse-hunting, but, whatever may be the cause, I have it on the authority of Trooper Mitchell thit the noises as narrated do occur, and that the performance is weird and eerie in the extreme,"
