AN ACT OF HEROISM. [ON the 9th of August the lives of two children were saved at a fire, by Mr. H. KELLY, of WESTON'S Opera House, at great personal risk. See daily papers of 10th inst.] The flames burst forth in dead of night, Sprung from some source unknown; While far and near the angry sparks By hurrying winds were blown. The suffocating smoke was there, The flames still onward crept; And still, unconscious of alarm, The poor young victims slept. Foremost in danger 'midst the crowd Young HARRY KELLY came; He forced the casement from the hinge, And leapt amidst the flame. Half-vanquished by the reeking cloud, He still advanced alone, Intent on saving human life, Regardless of his own. Onward he went undaunted, Cool, 'midst these great alarms; Two children saved attest his pluck, Restored to friendly arms. All honour to the gallant heart. Which beats in one so brave ; To one who fears no danger, shuns no risk, While trying lives to save. * Exigency again to the extent of a quarto volume.—ED. \+ Unwilling to trust entirely to our own judgment in the case of so great an author as M. HUGO, we have called in the assistance of a Regius Professor and two writers for the Melbourne Telegraph; but all three, though accustomed to unravel the most obscure sentences, and to track the ghost of an idea through a forest of notes of exclamation, were utterly unable to discover what the "rock" has to do with the story. We have, therefore, decided upon another elision, a course of conduct which we the more regret, as the ten volumes which contain the episode of the rock abound with passages of exquisite beauty.—ED. ++ Inexorable necessity demands four volumes.—ED.
