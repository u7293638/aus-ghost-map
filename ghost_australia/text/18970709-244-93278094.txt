[CorPYJuOT.] MARTIN CASH ; Olt '11ii: OUTLAW OF TABLEMOUNT. 'In Historical .,VarraLivo of the Early Days, front. the Diary of ani Old Colonist. (IN SEVENTEEN PARTS.) PART XVI. Taking about six pounds of gun. powder, the leader advanced cautiously but quickly towards the circular build. ing, which was not more than one hun dred yards distant, and soon reached it. Thcre was a small recess close to the ..ronnnr in the oinn..warl ..virentlV for drainage purposes, and into this Cash inserted the powder. A train was laid out for some distance and the aperture of the recess partly closed by a log which lay close at hand. When all was ready the powder train was ignited, and, raising his tight arm as a signal to his comrades, Cash drew a pistol and ran round the building. The huge dog in front at once espied him, but almost ere it could bay the bushranger fired and killed it. The distance between this round structure and the homestead proper was not more than fifty yards, and it did not take many seconds for so fleet a runner as Cash to cover it. Short as was the time, however, the explosion occurred before the door was reachedt and just as a man, bent almost double with age, came to it a iterrible blast took The volume of smoke which shot up obscured the greater part of the struc* ture for a time, but as it cleared away 1 the full effects of the explosion were apparent. The loosely built stones were hurled and thrown about in all directions-in fact the place had col. lapsed. The howls of the wounded and dying dogs were terrific, and the sight and the noise seemed to paralyze the old man who had come to an swer the door, and was no other than Apsley himself. "Surrender or you are a dead man. I am Martin Cash, the bushranger. If any resistance is made I'll not scruple to take life, so be wise and yield with. out-trouble I" the leader cried as he confronted the aged owner of the farm. house. By this time Cash was joined by his two comrades, and though several men belonging to the farm made their ap pearance from different places, they were all unarmed and entirely at the mercy of the outlaws. To resist meant death. They had all heard of Martin Cash and his comrades and were not disposed to irritate them by useless re sistance. Moreover, the summary measures taken to destroy the dogs had a salutary effect on them from the bushrangers' injured by the explosion and the falling stones, and the sight was a pitiable one as the wounded animals dragged them selves about howling with pain. " Let me get pistols and put these poor creatures out of their agony," pleaded the old man as he watched his favorite dogs. " I'll save you the trouble. It's best to shoot them, no doubt. Watch these people for a few minutes," the leader said to his fellow-outlaws as he strode towards the kennels. There were-so far as he could see six full grown dogs in the place and four puppies. Only three remained alive, and Cash soon put them out of pain by shooting them. This done, he turned towards the homestead and be gan the serious business of the day. "Muster all your servants in the kitchen, and mind no one is left out," he said to the old man, who Jones told him was Apsley. The latter did not make any demur to this order but at once obeyed it. Indeed, the employees scarcely wanted telling, for they turned into a large wing on the south side of the home. stead which was used as the kitchen and common dining room. There were a dozen maleservants at the farm and three female- servants, but four of the former were in the outfields. They had heard the explosion and were now returning to the homestead in con. siderable perturbation. Ofcourse they had no idea of what had really hap pened, but naturally suspected that the powder which Apsley kept in the house had- exploded. Kavanagh, who remained outside, saw these workers coming across the paddocks, and he went inside until they came close to the house. Then going out he covered them with his musket and quickly marched them in to their prisoner comrades. "I don't see young Apsley amongst the crowd," said Jones to his chief, " Where is your son ?" curtly asked Cash of the old man. "My son ?" repeated Apsley senior rather startled. "My son ? Oh yes. lie is in IHobart Town. 'ent away a C o nia, ~( ., ." . t.. _ - -~ . culpie or tays ago ton business" he concluded, in a rather jerky sort of inanicr. The answer seemed to satisfy the hushrang rs, who aid nothing further on the point but prficeded to make themselves a. cotufortahle as possible. The larder of ApIey uttt was well stocked, and ( .uI ordered the best fooit in the hioui e to le prepared for all hands. Ie, dejirid to ingratiate hiu self N% lthi the rniloy is, as It was always wire to e:onitluate them. " I intend to stop here a couple of days, Apiley,"' he 'e.an, " and in the meantime I'll take care of %on: fire. arms. Let rme have every wc:Ii-inn of the sort in the hiotune, and I cat pro mise you will not he molested. There must he no treachiry. If there it, you know what will rc.':it." The farmer poe r to one of the teen, tellitt bitn to Siuwi the outlaw where the ar.- were keg', and in ten minuta s the c oi had them all secured in a corner v the large rom. These which were loaded he drew the charges' from, and that done, he proceeded to do full justice to the excellent repast set before Th~h'-was plenty of tro g drink placed on the table, but the outlaws were not foolish enough to indulge too freely in it. In fact, sobriety was one of the main factors attending the suc cess of Cash's gang. It was now rapidly drawing on to. wards evening, and the bushrangers consulted as to the best method of spending the night. They decided to get what rest was possible under the circumstances, and for that purpose Cash told the servants that they could retire to rest at the usual time, but the men must sleep in the kitchen and the women in their own quarters. Iy this arrangement two of the convicts would be able ,to sleep while the other one mounted guard over the unarmed em ployces. This suited the latter well enough, I and, truth to say, when they found there was no danger of brutal treat ment from the outlaws they: rather en. joyed the diversion. It really meant the master, for while thc bushrangers remained no work would be done, In addition they would eat and drink of the best, and altogether their lot would be much better than under the ordinary routine of life. The only person who looked par. ticularly gloomy, and indeed vengcrul, was old Apsley. For the first time in thirty years the farm had been success. fully raided and his trusty dogs de stroyed without him having a chance to fire a shot. Still a look of hope sometimes flitted across his face as he sat moodily before the spacious fire place. Cash noticed his dejection, and said:-"This is the first time I be lieve, Apsley, youlhave ever had to en tertain bushrangers. I must say you do it well, and we will always think Iratefully of onu." The old man turned fiercely and ex claimed :-" You may never get a chance to be grateful. You've come to Apsley Farm, but you haven't got-away yet. Don't make too sure of anything an this place'l" The outlaws only laughed at the old man's chagrin and ceased to torment him. Cash was chivalrous enough to see his great age should at least pro. tect him from insult. A couple of hours later silence and sleep was or* dered, and soon the inmates of Apslcy Farm wefc either slumbering or trying to do so. Each outlaw took a turn on guard and the night passed without in cident. -. Cash was in no hurry to leave his comfortable quarters, and decided to remain another night on the farm, as he had stated. The conicts did not fear pursuit for several days longer, and their disposition was to tempt attack rather than run away from it. indeed, the three men intended to have a short life-for they looked upon that as in* evitable-and to make it as merry as covert to another and suffering prva. tions and daneers. During the day the outlaws held high revel. Those of the servants who could sing or dance were cempelled to do so, though the compulsion was not of a severe nature. Apsley, of course, was not asked to take part in this on ac count of his age, but a careful watch was kept op him. , The old man spent the time wander. ing around, and often going to the front door, he would gaze long and earnestly in the direction where Oat. lands lays as if he hoped for succor from that quarter. He had heard of the desperate character of Cash and his comrades, and knew they were quite rcady to fight a company of soldiers, as they had done, and that fact occasioned Apsley not a little uneasiness. As evening drew on the same pre parations as were made on the previous night were carried out. During the day the outlaws had possessed them selves of all the money which was in place. This amounted to Â£64. They had also secured the most valuable of the firearms and additional ammuni tion. A bullet mould was also taken, heir own hai .n, F..e o. 1-. useir uwoi easing DeCCe lOSt. Cash decided to take the first watch. himself, and this began shortly after nine o'clock-early to bed and early to rise being a maxim practised in Van Dieman's Land in those days by the settlers. The large room where the employees were kept captive was, as already stated, a wing of the home stead, and from its door a good view could be obtained around. Before ten o'clock the whole house hold was apparently asleep, and the guard passed most of his time walking to and fro just outside the room and in front of the house, taking an occa sional look into the apartment to see that all was well. It was while thus engaged shortly after ten o'clock that the silence of the night, which was almost opprtSsive in its intensity, was suddenly bsroken by the deep haying of a dog close at hand. 11he sound appeared to cotic from the vicinity of the demolished kennel:, and the grim warning did not fall unheeded on the acute cars of Cash, Going into the room, he called up Jones. Kavanagh was already sitting up, the sound having awakened him, and old Apsley was also very wide awake and not able to conceal his agitatiotn, thiouh the outlaws diil not notice it being otherwise engaged. " There is somtiethini the matter, 01ne1. We could not have killed all the does. 'There is one outsiiic now, unless "--and Cash laughed, queerly-- " it is a ghost of one of the brutes we killed." IDogs ! repeated Junes. Jumjin up. "'Then there is somnethins wron' -and hteÂºbized his weapons You:3 Apslcy must have returned, and sw' t have to be careful." The three men were now very wide awake and fully armed-indeed, ahuost overarmed. Each had four pistols and two tnuskets,T>esides a sort of cutlass. Going to the door, they were speedily convinced there was something wrong as the commotion at the late kennels was considerable. There must have been several dogs, by the noise, and no doubh they had human comrades with them. The night was very dark, and Cash expressed his intention of going to the west side of the house to try and really ascertain what was the matter. Jones advised him not to do so on account of the dogs, but the outlaw chief only laughed at his fears. Kavanagh remained at the outside door, while Jones kept guard over those inside and rather anxiously awaited the leader's return. Cash quite knew the risk of discovery he ran, but lIe loved danger and was equal to every emergency. lie had just attained his onjcctive point when he instinctively felt some. thing was near him. Both muskets were at full cock and ready for use, but he could not sec the foe though he felt one was close to him. lie was not kept long in suspense, for in the dark ness a few feet away there suddenly gleamed a pair of fiery eyes, and the next instant, with a low, savage growl, a huge bloodhound sprang upon the ourtl w. lie instantly fired, but the shot only slightly wounded the infuriated animal and the next moment it had made a spring at his throat. With a sweep of the atilt the man k rpt it from that part, but its fangs fastened into the fleshy part of his left forearm. Dropping the tirearms, Cash drew the cutlass and hepan to slash the brute. This was a wise act and pro bably raved his life. Using all his immense strength, a few cuts of the weapon-one of which half severed its body-laid it dying on the ground, and not a moment too soon. 11e had scarcely time to draw a pistol when an other hound was upon him, but this time his shot was lucky and laid it low.
