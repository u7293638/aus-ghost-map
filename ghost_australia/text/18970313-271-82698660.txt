NICHOLAS. I. BROWN, SPEAKER. HOW IT WAS WORKED. Tbe election of the Hon. Nicholas J. Brown to tbe speakerehip is as rank and Biiiellful as tbe Uob&rt; rivulet. Even tbe Opposition are not possessed of sufficient brazen cheek to cl&un; the defeat of the ministerial candidate as a party victory. The ghost of the Western Railway Bill eits heavily on the chest of tbe newly-elected Parliament, and on Tuesday bossed tbe whole show. Mr. Neil Lewis proposed N.J.B., and Mr. Henry was tbe seconder. Neil Lewie was tbe man who put on the cloture ; but Hoaost John has plastered tbe blame on to Speaker Bird, and the Northern members have been compelled to bow to the inevitable ratlier than incommode them selves. Thus it has happened that though one and all arc pledged to a Liberal plat form they have voted ignominiously for a Conservative speaker. Quite so! Very significant, that the new Parliament is as spineless and as objectless as its predecessor, unhampered by cither principles or policy, bossed over by ambitious office-seekers, professional placemen, and unscrnpulons wire-pullers. Not that it matters much whether Bird or Brown dons the Speaker's owl-like wisdom and frill ; but it was not particularly refreshing to see businesi start with a North v. South duel, although the Fysh-Braddon Ministry cannot complain, as the liobart electiou campaign was conducted on straight out North v. South lines, and the Hobart electors with exceedinply great RU6to returned the old hotch-potch push jut-t to spite the North.
