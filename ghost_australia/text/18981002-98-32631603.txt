(By Boogarra.) "Tengeznco is mine saith -Sie- Premier, I will i^y,'^-Scriptare Bowdleriaed. Parliament opened on Tuesday witt a salvo- of artillery from the Govern- ment benches. The Premier drew the attention of the House to the pubfica tion in the Kalgoorlie "Miner" of as alleged mill in the back yard between Piesse and George which never took place, and moved that the Attorney General prosecute before the Supreme Court the proprietors and publisher foi a scandalous libel. Leake added that steps be taken to discover the origina- tor of the allegations with a view to hs prosecution or exclusion from the pre- cincts of the House. This passed OE the voices. Comment is oui of place, and skating on thin ice is a dangerous pastime, but these archives would bi incomplete without a bare statement ol fact. Let us change the conversation. ***** There was once a large and stately elephant in a menagerie of assorted beasts in a fair ground, and having thc biggest trunk, and the greatest ears, he bossed the show easily. His chief pah and supporters were four other ele pliants who trumpeted when ho raised his trunk, and napped their ears when he napped his. The boss elephant ol the show looked after the takings at the door, purchased buns and sugar plums with the revenue, and distributed them among his favorites in the sur- rounding cages according' to his own sweet will and vagrant fancy. By and by a small and venomous flock of mos- quitoes Sew into the menagerie* and perching themselves in a gallery over the elephants' heads, began to make un- kind remarks about the distribution ol the buns and the unmelodious style ol the beDowings. Tba long of the beasts endeavored many times to dislodge the intruders with his trunk, but got stung in the process with persistent regularity. Now, there was a cageful of monkeys that complained bitterly that their cage was inadequately supplied with water and appealed to the boss elephant to lay on a pipe and a pump, so that they could drink when they wanted without acquiring pains in their delicate little tummies. This was forthwith promis- ed them, and they were happy. Just then a rich capitalist strolled into the menagerie to look at the anímala, and wandering too near the elephant's cage, found the trunk of the boss beast in his pocket before he knew it. It was too late to retire as he bad gone too far to make a bolt. His substance was extract- ed, and the pump and pipe put in hand forthwiíh. * * * * Still the monkeys would not keep quiet. Digging down into the sawdust that lay thick on the floor of their cage, they discovered some yellow nuts, and proceeded to devour them with avidity. Short, indeed, was their new found joy for no sooner did king elephant perceive what was up, than he claimed the nuts for the rich visitor to the menagerie, whose pockets he had rifled, and for- bade the monkeys to dig more than 10 inches into the sawdust. The monkeys howled at him, and he went over to their cage to quiet them. Some of the mosquitoes followed and encouraged the monkeys, who forthwith took down a perch and jostled the great quadruped in the solar plexus between the bars of the cage, and enraged him greatly. Refusing to qualify bis position, he raised his trunk and trumpeted "Damdi fido" in great anger, to which a brown chimpanzee in a distant corner of the menagerie echoed with tail erect, "My God ; Fm proud of you." Peace was eventually restored, but the elephant felt sore, and vowed vengeance. The op- portunity came. It appears that the second biggest elephant had squirted some dirty water across into the cage of a shaggy-haired gorilla, who passed his time turning somersaults, and chat- tering incessantly to the annoyance of both his friends and his enemies among ¡he animals; the gorilla threw some empty nut-shells back, and took no further notice. Then the mosquito, who had made so much trouble over at the monkey's cage, made a great buzzing, he dug his toes into the sand, and chortled, while there was great amuse- ment in the monkey's quarters in con- sequence. The ancient and honorable prestige of the menagerie trembled in the balance. Then the king beast issued j an edict that that particular mosquito | should be captured and placed where the five elephants could sit down upon it heavily, and crush it out of all sein lance of its kind, and shift it off its perch in the gallery overhead, and stop its buzz for ever, besides getting even for the perch thrusts in the ribs. And the fate of that mosquito is hidden in the unknown mists of the future from which the veil will be lifted in due course. Here endeth" the first lesson. Let us pray. Which things are a para- ble and several others. * * * * The amendments which the House of Moss-«r©wn Fossils tacked on to the Pub- lic Education Bill in the Council Bethel on St. George's Terrace, came up for analysis and dissection on Tuesday night. Once more the âceleton of dog- matic teaching was dragged forth from its sectarian cupboard by ¿the base of its skull, and rattled weirdly before the House. Twice has the obnoxious bogie been decently interred by the Assemk^fl and yet it won't stay down.

The House snook its head, and would have none of it, and priestcraft retired into its own shell once more. The amendment speaks of "religious instruction, strictly nonrsecretarian, as dfefirnguished from dogmatic or polemical theology," which is exactly the same sort of definition as "overproof whisky, entirely non- alcoho- lic, as distinguished from spirituous and j fermented intoxicants," a contradiction j in terms. Look up the word "polemical" in Dicksons Johnsonary, and then reflect J "how these Christians live in unity." «? * * * The Workmen's Lien Bill resolved it- self in a log-rolling contest of no mean order. The great Westralian timber in- dustry, the squatting business, and the contractors' trade, au fought the work- ing man through their representatives j all they knew how. There was no con- cealment attempted whatever. Each man. got up and barracked for his pocket under the benign system, which forbids payment of members, and allows only financially blest mfen. to represent themselves solely in the name of their electors in Parliament. Still the work- ing man won, and now has legally a direct claim upon the product o? his own hands. The Bill should make some of those who regard the Bankruptcy Court as a means of avoiding their just debts, and who smoke a choice brand of Flor de Never-pay cigars, sit-up and run their business on a cash basis. * * * * Wednesday is private members' night, the one night in the Parliamentary week when members who suffer from political dyspepsia can heave it off their chests, and unload upon a suffering House. George Leake shone last Wednesday on the subject of spuds- The subject was just about on a par with the mental ¡ calibre and Westralian instincts of the House, and the member for Albany took it in hand, and lavished the finest flowers of his oratory on a pb tato basis upon it. On a Workmen's Lien "Act, or a popular and liberal Gold Mines Bill, Leake often shows the cloven hoof. In name, leader of a progressive Opposi- tion: by profession, an up-to-date up- holder of the bone and sinew of the colony, and by practice, a reed shaken by the wind, sometimes a leader of his parry, sometimes a trouble and anxiety to his friends, a member at war with himself, and the set of principles he adopted last. Some mern era* prin- ciples are like an overcoat, put on when I the weather demands it, and hung upon J a peg after the owner gets home. * * * * The dying wail of Esperance is heard in the House once more. The cloak of Elijah has fallen upon Elisha; Moran now does the barracking for Esperance in place of Conolly, whose duty to his electors formerly came so far behind his blind adherence to the Premier's wishes, and his trained obedience to John For- rest's whistle. Conolly'B sole tune on his Parliamentary flute has ever been, "Whisper and I shall hear." Moran made a logical appeal on behalf of al- lowing private enterprise to construct a light line under binding restrictions from Esperance to Norseman, the main sting of the indictment being the Southern Cross railway, which would never have paid for axlegrease to keep the sun off the engineer's boots unless Providence and Arthur Bailey had dis- covered Coolgardie and brought about an era of payability for which the Forrest Ministry took the credit, with just the same degree of reason as existed when they took credit one year for the rain- fall. The Premier put his big bluchers down on Esperance with a firm hand, ae<»rding to precedent. The bogie of centralisation rises up out of the Fre- mantle harbor works and dances before him as he formulates what he no doubt calls his "arguments." * * Then Conolly, having begged, bor- rowed, or stolen a backbone from some- where, rose up and dealt out oratorical "slouch" in large ladlefula. The Pre- mier got most of it till the Speaker in- tervened. The Opposition looked amused at the change of front, and con- gratulated- bim on his new-found grit. Then, whisper it not in the streets of Askalon! Conolly went and voted against John Forrest ; in vain, however, for the House declared against private enterprise, with capital or without, with restrictions or with noue, by 15 votes to ll. Esperance can now go and bury itself, and come to its own funeral, and get the Ministry to throw clods on the coffin, while Forrest puts up a sign, 'Iii Hopes of a Glorious Resurrection Next Session." However, the next day the worm turned over a new leaf, so to speak, and the Opposition welcomed Conolly as a man and a brother. Es- perance will now be felt as well as heard, j even though it put forth only the cold j and clammy fingers of a ghost. * * * * - Gems of oratory on the Esperance railway debate: - The Premier: I have nailed my colors to the mast on this question. Vosper: You mean the stump of the mast. Leake: Yes, upside down, as a signal of distress. Bungarra, the GeraldJ session <_^H Lwing to I present k Select Intteregufar comniittee-room, placed thoughtfully nest to the Refreshment Bureau, five honorable members axe discussing the Perth (whisky and) water works. In the Opposition dun- geon, specially appointed for the pur- pose by the Government on account of its anti-septic properties, Vosper and his Chow Forgery and Perth Leprosy Committee are pnuniningr Chinese in various stages of putrefaction and watching exhibitions of " expert hand- writing. * * * * The very-Select-Committee to en- quire into the woes of the Ivanhoe Ven- ture shyndikit are ranged on tables in the dining-room examining dryblowers, mining experts and other liars, as to alluvial and cement, while six good men and true, appointed to whitewash the penal system of the colony are e sconced in the lavatory, no other place being available. They are mixing their white- ! I wash in the basins ready to slosh on j j when they get to work. Meanwhile the ' Overhead Railway Commission are ap proppriately enough up on the roof talk- ing aerial tramways and other elevated means of transport. The Assembly kitchen is at present- unusable owing to the stove breaking out with tick fever in the sub-acute stage, for it was here the Select Committee on ticks held sway when all other space was otherwise j filled. It is now being fumigated and will shortly be in a state of convales- cence. * * * * Friday night witnessed an attempt to jerk the Goldfields Iniquity Bill through all its stages. After teven hours' talk, much of it Vosper, 2Í clauses were dragged through the obstacle race, and this only by putting on the gag. Next ; Thursday this Alluvial Miners' Destruc- tion Act will again be called np for judgment, and it is probable that some- body will break Jawbone Neild's record, if their own jawbone holds out.
