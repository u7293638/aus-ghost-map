'' ' 3vlI you know you were in or .about tie 4ra viBjj-r;x-ia£ all the time., and no one came into tiiera, Bu«pioiouB or 'unsagpiciouE ; sOj how will thai aid you.' * True,' murmured Alice. 'But it 'Brill be a re lief to go somewhere or do something.' Alice found lier sister at home ; had disturbed her., in fart, at a very interesting employment, ae .i-e reader riay i-eraeniber. In spite of her ©w» emotional pr&oeeups;,iion, Selina instantly deleted that so^ethincf was wrong; for the sus .*7vse, illness, and agitation had taken every ves i£b of colour from her cheeks and lips. ' -Tliat can be the matter, Alice ?' was her greeting. * You look jest like a wslking ghost.' ' i feel Shut I do/ breathed poor Alice, ? and I Sept. my veil down in the street, lest I might be takf-n for one, and scare the people. A great misfortune has fallen upon, me, Seline. You '-?.t-- fLose bracelets last night spread out on **. table ?' Yes.' ' They -were in my charge, and one of them has been abstracted. It was of great value, gold linis, holding diamonds.' * Abstracted ! ' repeated the elder sister, in Iwth coacern and surprise, but certainly without the smallest indications of a guilty knowledge. ? H;:'.v ? In what manner.' * \x is a mystery. I only left the room when I ane- you on the staircase, and- when I went np'.uairs to fetch tho letter for you. Directly afftw you left, Lady Sarah came up from dinner, too the bracelet « aa not there.' \- 'ii is incredible, Alice. And no one else en tered the rc-om at all, you say? So servant? '.Not anyone,' interrupted Alices determined W-t to speak of Gerard Hope. ' Then, chUdi it is simply impossible/ was the Ctflra rejoinder. *It must have fallen on the ground ; or been mislaid in some way.' 'It is hopelessly gone. Do you remember fleeing it ? ' 'I do remember seeing, amidst the rest, a oraoetet set with diamonds; bat only on the «da«p, I thusk. It — — ' ' That was smother ; iiiat one is all safe/ inter rupted Alice. 'The one missing is of fine gold links interspersed with brilliants. Did you see jit?' * Not that I remember, p-was there, scarcely a minute, for I had only strolled into the back loom juat before you came down. To tell you the truth, Aiioe, my mind was too fuHv occupied ?with other things to take much notice even of jew«l«: Do not look bo perplexed : it will be all light. Only you and I were in the room, you Bay ; and wa could not take it.' * Oh ! ' exclaimed Alice, clasping her hands, »nd lifting her white, beseeching face to her jBJEtor'E, ' did you take it ? In — in sport ; or in \- ? Oh, Eurely you were not tempted to take it for anything else? Forgive me, Selina! you eaid you had need of money/ ' AHce, are we going to hare one of your old ecenes of excitement. Strive for calmness. I am rare you do not know what you are implying, iffy poor child, I would rather help you to jewels than take them from you.' ' But look at the mystery.' ' It does appear to be a myfifceryj hut it will, no ikrabt, be cleared up,' was the reply, calm and equable. 'Alice, what could' you have been {Streaming' of to* suspect me ? Have we not grown «p together in our honourable home ? You ought to know me, if any one does.' € And you really saw nothing of it ?' moaned Juice, wiih a sobbing catching of the breath. ' Indeed, I did not. In trufli, I did not. If I could help you out of your perplexity I would thankfully do it. Shall I return with you and assist you to search for the bracelet ?' ' ' No thank you. Every search has been made.' ' You have not told me what could induce you to suspect mo.' ?; '1 think — it waa ihe impossibility of suspecting jwrrbody else,' breathed poor Alice, with hesita tion. ' And you told me, you know, Selina, how very badly you wanted money.' - * Ho I do: far more badly than you have any idea of, child. So badly thai the thought crossed mfefor a moment of applying iA that dreadfully rich fifi:ee*th cousin Of papa's %rLiverpool, Ben jaanin Dalrysnple.vivho estranged himself r f rom /us ; Sears ago ; butl knew he would only growl out a fo if I did apply.

Alice left, her, inexpressibly Believed ; though tihe conviction that it must $nve been Gerard, returned to her in full force. * I wish I «ould *ee him !' was her menial ei 4laim&tM;)n. ?- * And for oaee forfcnne favoured Jier wish As ahe was dragging her weary limbs along, he caane right upon her at the corner of a street * 1 am so thankful/ she exclaimed. * I wanted fcoseeyeu.'
