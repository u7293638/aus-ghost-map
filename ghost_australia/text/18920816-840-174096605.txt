Local Option. Here is an idea for an unpeoumous Troarar. Tlio subjcot of local option is beginning to hito in England. As it is doing so tho ghosts of ull tho dead Chancellors of tho Exoheqner aro invoked against it. This is tho argumont. Moro than one -third of tho whole national rovonuo — that is, nenrly thirty 'millions of money — aro derived from tho salo of intoxi cants. Should looal option prevail throughout tlio country, tho Exclioquor would loso very rouoli, if not tho whole, of this rovenuo. Under prohibition it wonld all ho lost. Somo persons nffocl to bo horrified at tho loss of a sum equal to the antount necessary to maintain tlio Army anil Navy, though not in tho least shocked at tho idea of having to obtain rovonue from tho consumption of intoxicants to maintain tho Army and Navy. And thoy orguo that in oil distriots whore looal option prevails tho pcoplo are boing spared the payment of ono-third of their share of taxation. But this is a mistake. It is not tho community as a whole, but only tho wino hibhors in it who have been supplying this money ; and why should, ab stainers from intoxicants bo taxed to make up the defioienoy caused by stopping tho sale of aloohol? That would bo u toothsomo revengo for tipplers. At present, rovenuo derived from tho sale of intoxicants does not go to maintain the Army nnd Navy ; it is absorbed in main- . tabling the police and the judiciary rendered necessary by tho sale and use of strong drinks. Tho money wonld not bo needed if tho had side of tho traffic were uboli'shed.
