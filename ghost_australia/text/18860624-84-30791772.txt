S'ioet's Corner. DIAMOND SCRATCHES. ivs y ears ago in the city inn, We passed a pleasant day ; Four merry friends, who ate and drank, And were blithe as birds in May. i We ecratched our names on the window pane; \- There they stand in the sheen, And prove t3 men if nobody else, \- : What fools we must have been.. One of them borrowed my cash (a dove r'That never returned to the ark) ; *The second was jealous of my fame, And stabbed it in the dark : The third made love to a bonny wee maid, . earer to mo. than life-- . Wooed her and won her behind my back, Aid 'made her his wretched wife. And here ,1sit in the cosy inn, - While the bright wood splinters blaze, And drink my pint of' claret alone, And think of thoeby-gone days, And wonder whichof mythree false friends .I hate or despise the most, : .. i Surely. not him who borrowed my cash ; 'Tis gone-'tis abodiless ghost * Surely not him who stole my wife,,. That was' not my wife, God wot; But might have been, to my dire distress, " Had she fallento my lot. i : think I hate'with the deadliest hate The fellow,who slurred my name Shaking my'haud, eating my bread, Aadmurdering my fame. ,
