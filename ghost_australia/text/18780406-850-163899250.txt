THE PIMPAMA GHOST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'LOGAN WITNESS.' Sir,— I would like to know if the Pimpama ghosts eat grass ; if so, our friend could have been one or more any day about there a couple of months ago. But I think if we could give the old Scotch bard a lift up he would come out with something like the following, but in better shape : — When ere to drink you are inclined, Or poor "Old Dick" runs in your mind, Of Pimpama I pray beware, Remember boniface's hair. Yours, &c.;, ENQUIRER. Podinga, April 3.
