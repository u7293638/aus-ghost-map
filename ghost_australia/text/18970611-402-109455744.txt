A Voice from the Grave. One of the best ghost stories we have heard this season is about a young widow, she's a charming young widow, too—who went to stay at a country house down in Somerset- shire. The house being very full of company, one of the girls had to turn out of her bed- room— the one in the home that had the repu- tation of being haunted—in favor of the new comer. But the widow didn't fear ghosts— lor', no ! They might haunt till they were black in the face, for all she cared. One thing, she wouldn't be likely to hear or see much of them, for she was quite tired out when she went to bed. The night passed all right ; but then, again it's so very dark o' mornings now, that you don't know for certain when the night really has passed. The widow herself was trying to decide whether it was night or morning, when —hush !—she heard a footstep along the old creaking passage. Nearer, nearer it came. At last it stopped. There was positively a tap at the door. Then a voice, half muffled, said, " I want to come in to get my body." Great beads of perspiration stood on the brave little woman's brow, but the mere thought of the spectre head entering settled her, and she swooned. And then—well, then Mary Emma, the upper housemaid, who had been turned out of her room for the night, and left, in her hurry a part of her wardrobe behind, came in and fetched the upper storey of her dress out.
