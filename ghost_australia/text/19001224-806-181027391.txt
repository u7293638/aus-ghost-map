MALDON. Our local correspondent writes:—Vincent's Freehold Co.—Since cutting the roof at the 200ft level, have driven south on it 12ft, and it has opened out from 2ft to 4ft at present. A now make of stone was out yesterday (Fri day) on the west wall which carries a splendid prospect of blue piotal and gold. The best gold was got in the adjoining claims on the north, on the west wall, and the part of the reef which carried the richest gold was only about 6 inches wide. Those who saw the stono broken in Vin cent's Freehold yesterday state that it is identi cal in appearance with what was broken in the adjoining claims when they got tho best gold. It is quite possible that the reef will widen still farther going south. Tho mine manager is con vinced that there is another reef still further west, which will bo driven for later on. Fente man’s Proprietary' will have a partial cleaning np to day for Iho week from ripples, and the rteno in tho winze is carrying good gold. The slopes are also looking well. All the necessary arrangements are all but complete for starting the Eaglchawk Consolidated battery, which most likely will commence crashing on Thursday next. y*>J> directors of tho North Mai don mine are calling for tenders for sinking their shaft 200ft deeper, Mr W.
