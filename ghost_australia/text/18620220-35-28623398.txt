A SHILLING'S WORTH OF CHBAP WOOD- CUTS. feront the Spectator.) I Tub mania for cheap illustrated serials u on the increase The number of woodcuts, chiefly of a worthies« character that may be procured weekly for one shilling ia considerably above a hundred on the average lor tSat snm eight miscellanies of the London Jehnal class, two ifiustsated newspapers a comic aerial, two serious publications, and the first number of I novel of "powerful and thrilling inte- rest" (Nwi 2 and 3 presented gratis to evérv pur chaser of Mo 1) may be obtained Here is a quantity! at any ratof but of the quality of the cuta and the paper on which they are printed much cannot fie said Exception, however. __u_tbe made In favour* of the London Journal, which commands the aid of Mr John Gilbert as ita chief illustrato., and u at once the longest establuhed and best conducted periodical of ita kind. For how long a period Sir Gilbert's . connexion with it has lasted I am unable precisely to say but shall be within the mark lu stating fifteen years He seldom now makes hu appearance in the JUtuttaUd _faM,andh_B entirely relinquished working for the numerous publications of tht Religions Tract Society To the London Journal he still keeps constant, and during the whole of the period above stated has been throwing off numberless " abduc tiona, " waylaying.," " unexpected intrusions, ' ' marriages and deaths, ' under every conceivable variety of circumstance, in illustration of the won drous stones from the fertile brains of Messrs Fierce Egan and J 7 Smith No matter whattthe Incident or what the period, whether a royal progress or a strike of operatives a review In the Champ de Mara or a band of mediaeval warriors, the interior of a gaming houso or a labourer s cottage, Mr Gilbert is equally at home. Scriptural, hutorical, Shakipeanan, and domestic sutaeets, have engaged him each by turns He u ready for anything, ' Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Flautas too light ' Nothing that he does u actually bad, and thu u a great thing to say, considering the multiplicity of hu productions Objection may ne taken to numerous qualities m hu work, but hu great picturesque feeling, masterly atyle, and happy pencilling, almost atone for his faults As with finbens, on whose style Mr Gilbert appears to have formed hu own, we forgive the eccentricities for the sake of the evident genius that guided the pencil Mr Gilbert has the elements of a great artist within him-he possesses the pictorial faculty in an eminent degree, and has considerable feeling for beauty, his sense of humour and character, though less marked, Is etui evident, and had he corrected hu tendencies to con- ventionality and cultivated hu taste by an numble study offunsopbiaticated nature In his earlier days, there is little doubt that he might have taken high rank aa a painter As it u, Mr Gilbert will be re memberád aa the moat prolific illustrator of thu or any preceding age He u not only a rapid bul a verv industrious worker Fabulous stones are related of the quickness with which he makes these London Journal drawings and the high prices obtained for them A collection of all Mr Gilbert a drawings would fill a room of _o inconsiderable dimensions, and not only did he at one period, find time to contri bute his aid to nearly every illustrated work issued from the Press, but also to paint one or two oil pic- tures of large dimensions and several wafer co'onr drawings within the year Bitter were the tears and loud the watlings among publishers «id proprietors of illustrated work* whim Mr Qilbart finally deter- mined to give np a great portion of hu wood drawing He has ijeen the* Tdol of the wood engravers, they ^wore^ and probably itiUáwear, by him, aa the man of the day-the king of Wöo_=_raug_ts_i_n Every young aspirant who wished to devote himself to illas tration waa to devote hu days and nights to tne study of Gilbert, hu was the only style " You may have originality of your own, but we don't want any evi dence* of it,, crush it ^.together if you dan, but at leaalkeep it in the background, become a slavuh imitator ; trade with another man s means, be success -ful, and be happy 1 " This waa the advice in effect, though 4°t in actual words, to the. unfledged wood draughtsman In some cases it has been followed with not very brilliant results, as we shall presently see, but: as a general rule men refused to look through the eyes of another, and adopted styles or their own ooking ipore to nature than any man a work, and thus the higher class of books and periodicals are now illustrated in a manner undreamt of but very few years ago The gentleman who draws for Reynolds' Sfitetllany and the London Berala presents a curious and pitiful instance of the effect of the advice above quoted Who he u I am unable to say, as, with a modesty that could scarcely have been expected from so un- blushing an appropriate* Of other mens ideas, he never appends hu name to his productions Like all copyuts/he has only succeeded in attaining the vices of hu master s style.
