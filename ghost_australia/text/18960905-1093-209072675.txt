SUNDAY READING. MY CONSCIENCE. I sat alone with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, And we talked oÂ£ my former living In the land where the jears increased. The ghosts of forgotten actions Caine floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; The vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face, Alone with my conscience sitting In that silently solemn place. And now alone with my conscience, In the place where the years increase, I try to recall tiiat future In the land where time will (cease, And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful so e'er it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
