ANOTHER TWANG FROM AN AUSTRALIAN LYRE. Mʀ. Pᴜɴᴄʜ begs to acknowledge the receipt of the appended “poem” from “Mr. Henry Bœhme, Rough Carpenter, Ashﬁeld,” the gentleman whose a‐muse‐ing contributions to the Australian Muse he had such exquisite pleasure in calling attention to a week or so back. He has equally great pleasure in publishing it 𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑚, feeling sure it will only conﬁrm all he said in his former article on the authors claim to rank as a poet of 𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑟 eminence. Mr. Pᴜɴᴄʜ, however, can ﬁnd no room in his columns for any more specimens of Mr. Bœhme’s gems. It is possible to have too much, even of a good thing. He has received the notice he asked for, and is now permitted to warble forth his Pœan of gratitude. 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚 𝑠𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡. A small prose paragraph follows the poem, but this partaking more of the character of 𝑟𝑢𝑑𝑒 than 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ literature, Mr. Pᴜɴᴄʜ declines to give it insertion. (𝑃𝑒𝑟 𝑓𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑢𝑛𝑐ℎ ℎ𝑖𝑚𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓.) All earthly Treasures gained, I use to buy my lunch with, Amongst all other tallents, I got one, ﬁtt to punch with. O Punchy dear Punchy, how shall I repay Thee for giving me justice right down on the spot. I must call thee, though grease, but not a bit greedy for lighting the ﬁre and skiming the pot. Come let us then have it; its kooked now and smoking Let us give the whole country a hearty good lunch, Let us use our treasure, in earnest, not joking The people want vitals, besides ghosty Punch. My talents though small, without fear I’ll use now Since I have a shelter and a punch, to correct, With pleasure; I’ll set in; to the soil, my own made plough With motto on: Practice, makes Man but perfect. Since thou didst correct, me, I am bound then to sail clear Though it took the best part, of thy wit, and thy staff What I have been writing, belongs to the last year O Punchy dear Punchy, take the ﬁrst lot of chaff. I am going to write now, in rhyme and with reason In the year eighteen hundred (not eight) sixty‐nine, Come let us go at it, all things, have a season Thy manger full chaff, wants grain to look ﬁne. Though I cannot talk latin, but chew Wurst in German In English, I manage some words only few, As little as I may be, without grease or gammon, I'll tease thee like Driver a rusty old screw. Come on then dont draw back ; or els thow must burst soon Since the scum of my Pamphlet, got stuck in thy Trap, No more wasting of fools cap, no matter what ink on, 1 shall glue it together for thy staff as a cap. Come on then, give spell ones to all the dear Parkeys, Leave the whole lot, in Iviama's Mistery engulfed, Let us sing to the Country, not Ghost like-like Larkeys And talk about, facts, in wich we all are involved. Oness more I say come on we all want Instruction We all have got faults, either rich so the poor, Come on then no matter, how strong thy corruption The stronger the better, for talent manure. Come let us go at it, I am not the least frightend No matter how many are under thy thatch I am redey to Punch, or thy bowels to lightin Or be for thy Gas staff a real germs u match. Henry Boehme, Rough Talent Carpenter, &c.; Ashfield. Mr. Punch was slightly thunderstruck — not to say considerably electrified — at reading the following among the Herald advertise ments. 7" ANTED a Cm-led Hair Devil, apply immediately, stating price, &c.; Parkes ! Parkes ! Are you " at it again ?" Political Barnum of the Southern Hemisphere, are you really going in for another new " sensation " to keep the game alive. "Exit Ghost. Enter Devil !" It won't do, my boy ! oh dear, no ! never no more.
