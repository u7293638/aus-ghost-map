poetrg. The Shield. Ob 1 did you heat a voice of death ? v And did you not mark the paly form Which rode on the silver miet of the heath, And sang a ghostly dirge in the storm? Was it a wailing bird of the gloom, Which shrieks on the house of woe all night? Or a shivering fiend that flew to a tomb, To howl and to feed till the glance of light ? ’Twas not the death bird’s cry from the Nor shivering fiend that hung in the blast; ’Twas the shade of Helderio—man of It screams for the guilt of days that arb See how the red, red lightning strays, And scares the gliding ghost of the heath 1 Now on the leafless yew it plays. iVhere hangs tbo shield of the son of death 1 That shield is blushing with murderous etains; Long has it hung from the cold yew|s It is blown by storms and washed by rains, But neither can take the blood away. Oft by that yew, on the blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon’s light; While the damp boughs creak, and the swing ing shield Bings to the raving Epirit of night 1
