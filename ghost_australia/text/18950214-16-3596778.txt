A COOLGARDIE EXPERIENCE. AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY. A writer in the Adelaide Standard gives the following Coolgardie extraordinary experience - "As I have often told you, the Western Australian nigger is no beauty, neither is he of much use, but he has one redeeming feature, he can find water in places that no white man would ever dream of searching for it, but the fellows who hang around camps are not of much real service The wild tribe in the back country are the useful animals, but it is no easy matter to get one of those savages to point out a ' soak" to a white follow. They will take all the damper, tobacco, and tinned camel you care to give them, or that they can steal, and they will readily promise to find ' plenty gabbing ' As you know ' gabbing' moana water in their liquid language, which is about as sweet to listen to as their faces are to look upon But after feeling you round the bush, until they know by the gleam in your roses that you won't stand them any longer, they suddenly disappear in the bush., and it is not a healthy sort of amusement hunting for them when they once got a good start in that forest The Prospectors out back give them a day or two to find water, if they do not find it then they tie the nigger to a tree and keep him there until he is dry as the inside of an oyster shell Then they let him go and follow him As a rule the coon makes a straight dive for the nearest water. They say that the men of their tribe will kill any savage who gives up the secret of those precious waterholes "Away beyond Idgory a couple of prospectors -one of whom is a well known Adelaide boy pot clean out of water, and they feared that they had looked their last on the City of Churches, for they were too far out to hope to get back to any civilised camp before death would put in his claim "As they lay dreaming at the flush of dawn a footfall soft as the caress of a snowflake on a sound of soot broke the death like stillness, a twig broke, and then a sable warrior and his gin glided into the white man's camp, and silently as ghosts began to loot it Had the whites been sleeping they would never have heard the stealthy marauders The diggers lay still, and waited for a chance to spun j The chance came, and the Adelaide man wound his arms around the skinny CLS of the warrior The gin got away, and the back' kicked and bit and fought, and got half strangled for his pains "Then he was fed on dry damper and salt fish, and tied to a tree until morning At daylight he got another ample feed salt bacon the time-and was asked how far it was from the nearest waterhole He could talk a mixture of English and nigger dialect, and this is what he said Gmtlnh got up, white fellow walks walks walks, galah tumble down, white fellow sit down, sleep, make in plenty plour Windah get up, white fellow walks walks walks, garden tumble down, white fellow sit down, sleep, make 'em plenty plour, galah get up, white fellow walks walks wall a, galah tumble down, white fellow got gabbing' This being inter- proved meant that the nearest water was three days' travel from that spot The whites would have to be on the move from sunrise to sunset Gindah means the sun, when Condah tumbles down it at sundown, white fellow sit down means camp for night " The SVUH0330S did not believe that tale, and they gave the darkie to understand unmistakably that they doubted his veracity, but he refused to budge an inch and they soon saw that he had realised that they were far more in need of slider than he was, and he made up his mind to But the show out At midday they shifted him from the shade of the tales and turned history towards the sun, and left him to think things over, bound hand and foot to quicken his mental faculties At sunrise next morning he was IIB obstinate as formerly, and they were half crazy from thirst, but they dimly understood his little game. His gin had gone off for help to her tribe, and, trouble was looming up for them. " Then they opened his mouth and stuffed it half-full of salt, and propped his teeth apart with a stick. He stood that for three mortal hours in the sun whilst they stood revolvers in hand, waiting in the shade watching for the tribe. At last the nigger came to the conclusion that he had better give in or be pickled, and he murmured huskily through his baked lips, ' Me find 'in gabby.' Then they tied his hands behind his back, hobbled him with a rope so that he could walk: but not run, covered him with their revolvers, and invited him to proceed and he did, and at sundown they were quenching their thirst at a good soak, and the black drank like a camel after thirty days' abstinence."
