(To the Editor of the Gironicle) SlB, — Some time ago the Maryborough Chronicle proved; on good, sound, sensible argument, that the time had Arrived when the Committee of the Maryborough Hospital should ' take immediate action to open a correspondence with the Government for the purpose of pro viding funds for the erection of a new Hos rnfol in omii» lrv»n1rHr nfchpr tVifln flip nrpspnt site, the centre of the town. tJp to the present I see the Committee have taken no notice of public opinion, bnt they can have their .day like the old Corporation, and after that public opinion will rule. . Yours, &c.;,' Typhoid. f The Committee took the matter up at its last meeting. If they will throw their souls into it, j the public will back them up, and the thing will be done. — Ed. M. -7.] A bl at a Ghost and the gonseque nce —Rather a peculiar case (says the Eclmca Advertiser of Wednesday last is set down for hearin at the Heathcote County Court, o comm nce -itting on Friday next, before his Honour Judge Bindon. At the intersection of Pohlman and High streets Heathcote, s sitn^ ated a brewery which has b een untenanted for a long time past, and was said to have been the haunt of a ghost, some white object having been seen pa rollin the premises at th mystic hour. A young gentleman living, not far o ' was escorting a young ady home one evening, some two months since, and wh n. passing the supernatural'6 promenade, beheld a white bject in front of him. Without more ado. he-rushed f rward and st : uck the sup osed ghost a heavy bio * with his walking stick. However, the ghost proved to be flesh and bone, in shape of a daughter of a trooper, who 'was quietly talking at the place with a friend, she being dressed in a light coloured dress. Nego tiations at an amicable settlement having failed, the.father of the injured intends to bring an action in the County Court to recover £200 damages.
