!Hables' (Column. Outside the Party. Thick throng the snow flakes, the evening is dreary, 594 Glad rings tbe music in yondor gay hall ; On her who listens here, friendless and weary, Heavier chill than the winter's doth fall. At yon clear window, light-opened before me. Glances the face I have worshipped so well ; There's the line gentleman, grand in his I glory ; There the fair smile by whose sweetness I, fell. This 1b akin to him, shunned and forsaken, That at my besom sobs low, without bread ; Had not suoh pleading my marble heart shaken, I had. been quiet, long since, with the dead. Oh I could I.enter there, ghastly and squalid, Stand in men's eyes witb my spirit o'er- borne, Show them where roses bloomed, cruBhcd now and pallid, What be louhd innocent, leaving forlornâ€” How the fair ladles would fall from thoir dances, Trembling, aghast at my horrible tale 1 How would he shrink from my words aud my glances I How would they shrink from him, swooning and pale I This is the hair that was soft to enchain him ; Snakelike, it snarls on my beautlless brow ; These are the hands that were fond to de tain him With a sense-magic then, powerless sow 1 No ; could I come, liko a ghost, to affright him, How should that heal my wound, silence my pain 1 , Had I tbe wrath of God's lightning to smite him, That could not bring me my lost peace again. Ne'er let him grieve while good fortune be tide him, Ne'er count again tbe poor game lost of old ; When be comes forth, with his young bride beside bin, Here shall they find us both, dead in the cold.
