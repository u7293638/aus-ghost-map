REPRODUCTIVE WORKS I Or the £102,000 senselessly voted under this misleading head contracts to the ex tent of £6,000 have been entered into, and will have to be paid for. About half this amount has already been disbursed. Now, we ask where is the return ? The jntgrcop qf 48Q,000 for pue y av n RiN per cent. is £1800. Has that sum been returned to the Treasury ? No, nor: the ghost of it, or anything at all. Have individuals been benefited ? To . nog appreciable extent, and you might go on spending publio money in the same way without anybody being the better. Roads in the bhush will no more relieve or prosper the laborer and mochanio than throwing all the gold held by the banks into the river Dorwent. Now, hero is au expenditure of thirty thou sand pounds. Can anyone show the smallest particle of reproductiveness ? The fact is, the whole scheme was a delusion and a snare, the product of ignorant or unprincipled men. It is just such a policy as might be expected from a cross between a fool and a rogue.
