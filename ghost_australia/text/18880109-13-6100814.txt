MONDAY, JANUARY 9, 1888. When the meeting of the Federal Council this year was first suggested, we mentioned that the most important business the delegates could transact at Hobart would be the consideration of the question of how to induce the colonies that still stand out to accept the federal bond. So long as New South Wales and South Australia ignore the scheme to which they once assented, the Federal Council is a ghost rather than a reality. It is no use piolonging the half cxistenco of a pnantom, and consequently all fede ralists will bo in accord with Sir SAMUI L GritiniTH and Mi GILLIES in their dc°iro to rofoim the Hobart body, and cuduo it with lifo No senso of wounded pudo or offended dignity need stop our hand m any degreo When the Convention sat in bydnoy wo woio willing to adopt any plan that commondod itself to the delegates as a wholo Iho avowed object of tho Victorian representatives was to accustom tho colonies to act together, to induce them to regaid Australia as a wholo , to sot aside potty provincial ideas, to steer steadily for unity, rather than to allow ovents to duft us to separation, and tho machinory was to a certain extent a matter of m difloronco A particulai plan was adopted, and ono which, if it had re coived fair pla), would probably havo effected its purposo of leading to some lai ger and better union We have been loyal to that plan, but a3 other lead mg colonies havo cLmngod their minds and do not caio to ratify it, thero is nothing to provont us from trying again lho sister states havo novor said that thoy aro oppobed to federation, but havo only objected to tho constitu tion or tho powors of tho oxisting council ]t is posbiblo for tho federal colonies, tlioieloio, to nsic tneir io luctaut, doubtful neighbours, with tho best possiblo giaco, how thoy would wish tho existing act to bo amended so as to onablo them to como in Wo havo novor jot had an authou tativo statement of what are considered by the maionty ot colonists in South Australia and Now South Walos to be tho fatal objections to the piesent schemo 1 ho speeches m Pai liamout and the articles in tho pi ess havo boen numerous, with the îosult that the complaints ate confused if not contra dictory Sometimos it is urged that tho representation is numerically weak and politically unsound, so that tho council must always be a bliam , and frequently it is assoitod that its poweis aro inordinate, and that a colony might awake to lind all its libortios desttoyed by a conclave of gontlomon ovoi whom it had little control, and whose ox istonco it had well nigh forgotten Easy and conclusivo replies aro possiblo to both objections, but thoro is no occasion to attompt thom now It is sufficient that tho fcdoral states aro ready and willing to amond or sot asido tho existing schomo if tho Bistei states will point out anothor Apparently Sir SAMUEL Ciumiu and Mr On LIES havo reason for tho belief that tho adhesion of the dissentiout provinces could bo socurod by taking fiom the Federal Council sorno of tho little legislative powur «,* \ which its present constitution gives it. As. matters stand, tho Council cannot deal with any subject unless tho provincial Parliaments have expressly remitted the issue to it. Sir SAMUEL. GRIFFITH, is now said to be willing that 1 after the issue has been sent to the Council for arbitration its act or acts shall remain inoperative until the local Legislatures have considered and adopted tho samo, while Mr. GILLIES , is creditod with favouring the idea of allowing a colony that considors itself aggrieved to petition the SOVEREIGN to disallow the bill. Either expedient, wo may remark, is better than the one proposed at the last instant by the late Sir A. STUAKT-which wa felt it to be a duty to strongly oppose -that any colony, at any moment, because of any temporary buff, should be at liberty to withdraw from tho union and cast off all prior legislation. Whenever the colonies federato, and on whatever terms, they should never look to go back, but should expect always to go forward-to become moro and more a one and .indivisible whole ; and wo would rather seo the powers of the Council weakened than its existence made to dopend upon tho inevitable caprice of tho hour. If every tiff was held to justify a divorce, few marriages would last long. No part of Australia can ever suffer seriously at the hands of another part. However, it is scarcely for us, nor yet for tho Federal Council, to lay down the law on theso and other points. The question is not what wa desire, but what aro tho views and the wishes of the outsido states. They must havo ideas of their own as to what tho Federal Council should be, and the first step towards reconciliation must surely bo to ascertain their wishes. It might bo a mistake to say, " Wo will "receive your adhesion on such and " such terms," while tho most sensitivo colony could not take ofTonce at being invited to state what are its ideas and its safeguards. If the Council adopted tho Griffith plan it might offend tho one state, and if it endorsed tho Gillies schemo it might offend tho other ; and what wo want is security that the reform, whatever it may bo, will propitiate and secure both If Sir SAMUEL Guiri mi and Mr GILLIES havo information to lay before the Council of tho viows and desires of the Governments and tho Parliaments of the two absent colonies, well and good The Council can then act accordingly, but otherwise tho procedure, wo pre sumo, must bo, not by tho Council laying down toims which tho non federal colonies may accept or reject, but rathei by tho Council seeking tho co- operation of tho states in quostion in making a new start Jealousy has been so much at tho bottom of the opposi tion to tho federal movement that the question of procedure becomes one of substanco Sir HENRY PAUKLS him solf should bo eager-if his old ambi- tion has not desortod him-to crown the Centennial yeat by tho creation of a real and living 1'ederal Council, but ho is handicapped m deiling with tho question, and it may bo advisable to allow him and the South Australian Premier a largo latitude as to whether terms should be offered by the 1 edcral Council, or whether thoro should bo a new convontion to decido upon amend- ments in tho existing act Iho Tedeial Council, with full information, will no doubt act with discretion, but wo may remind federalists goncully that tho task to bo attempted-and it is an all important task-is not for us to evolve anothor scheino which we may consider satisfactory but it is for us to get at tho now, audits yet non expressed, views of our neighbours No blaine attaches to Sir HENUY PARIV.LS foi having attempted to maka the best bargain that lie could for Ina colony regarding tlio transport of the mails between Ln0'land and Australia. But in this, as in nil niatteis requiring joint action, somo consideration is ne- cessarily duo to tlio opinions expressed by tho othei paities to tho contract 'Iho Ministry of New South Wales \oluntanly entered into an arrange- ment with Victoria and South Australia \\\ hich must prove of great advantago to each of the threo colonies, 'lhoy weio bound in houour, thciofore, not to rano any uuneceasaiy obstiuotion, and not to jeopardise, e\en for a week, the regular mail servico, because a diilcreuco of opinion had anson on what is, attei all, a subject of minor mtoiest Tho carnago of piiccls may bo an ex- citing or absoibing topic among tho officials of tho Post olhco, who aro natuially anxious to niako their branch of tho carrjmg ti ado suc- cessful In tho meantime, how cvei, tho btisincsi is small, and tho public aro practically concorned only with a speedy and regular delivory ol lettcis and nowspapcrs llenco tha lesponsiblo Ministers both of Victoria and of South Austialia have had na hesitation in expressing thoir willingness* to exclude packages from tlio "mail " matter," which is thosubject of the con tract, and to pay for them separately Mr. Ginns decíales in cllcct that it is not woith while to cntor upon somo months of haggling with tho companies for tho sako of the £800 which will bo lequued to piovido for the carnage of paicels. Mr JOHNSON, the l'obtinastei Goneial of South Australia, takos a stronger viow, for he has " reluctantly " como to the conclusion that tho companies aie right m distinguishing between parcels and mails It is m considciation of thobo facts that tho Lnglish Post olhco authouttos, who fust laised the ques- tion, have been induced to yield Por tunatoly tho pressure, if not tho argu- ments, of tho colonies has compelled Sir HENRY PAHKLS to follow tho samo courso, mid the contract can be at once ratified It is, of corneo, mgcd that tho dis- puto had some moi its of its own, and did not turn on tho pt osent business of the paiools dopaitment of tho Post oflico It is saul, foi nibtanco, that tho cainago of pat cols may necessitate largo payments to tho stoamship com- panies as tho ti ailie mercasen, and that tho £800 mnj soon mount up to thouiands JJut to theso statements there nie two obvious answois Tho first IB that tho Post olhco should make such a profit out of its paicols blanch as would enable it to pay tho ordinaiy charges for fi eight it it intends to com poto for a cairjing trade If, on tho ' contrary, it talos parcels at a loss for tho convonieiiLo of tho pcoplo, thou tho countiy bhould inako good the ordmaiy rates 'I he fact that a big businoss is expected is tho woist of all excuses toi tho meanness of try- ing to ovado tho pay monts which aio exacted from ordinaiy agonts In tho second placo, howovor, tho steamship companies can rouly that if such a rapid development of the parcels post is likely, then the space required for mia cellaneous packages may swallow up the whole subsidy It is conceivable that a steamer might be weighted with such a cargo of odds and ends sent through the Post office that the subsidy would not be sufficient for their tiansit Hie truth is that the Universal Carrying Agency is a brand new addition to tho work of the Post-ofiico By the expiry of the mail contract it will be firmly established, its results known, its proportion of traffic capable of estimation, and thon a fair arrangement could moie easily be made But wo have noyv to deal with piesent circumstances, and it is admitted, even in the Sj dney Post-office, that theio is nothing in the paicels business to warrant a delay in the signing of the contract " Sufficient M unto the Gay is the evil thereof " It is true that the steamship copi pames knew of the existence of the parcels post w hon they agreed to the contract They did not knoiv, however, and apparently no ono know, until Mr H viivXS brought his razor like judg ment to the subject, that a ¡yarcel was îegarded as a letter 'ihey contend that by their othei mail contracts they aie only bound to carry letters and newspapers and whatever belongs to the proper business or the Post office If tins is the case, why should an excoption bo «nado in tho Australian agreement, and why should the scope of the term " mail matter " be suddenly enlarged 1 ft/ would certainly be a moan inter oretation ot the agreement to main tam that a clumsy packago two leet in length is mail matter lu the ordinary senso of the torm More over, as wo have boforo pointed out, the claim that lias been so strenuously insisted upon by tho ÎNcw South Wales Postónico is unfair to piivato agents Tt involves that the cost of carnage, which is usually borne in tho first instanco by tho sondor, is to bo met by the countiy Whether a Go».eminent is wiso in entering into such business schemes is a fair question for discussion Lut thoro can bo no doubt that if it does so, and if it places itself m competition with private films, it should manage its affairs in accordance with the ordinary commotcial Hiles Poi all these reasons tho Governments of Victoria and South Austiuha did no moro than an act of justice in conceding from tho fir3t to the shipping companies the right to charge foi lumbering packages which happen to bo sent through the general agency blanch of tho Post ofhee With this concession tho contract has much to recommend it It will bringa substantial saving to the Post office , whilo, at the same time, a speedier sei vice will bo gi\on foi part of the mails, and a cheaper postage foi others Sir HEMIY PUIHLS must bo forgiven for pleading his case with fulness and vigour, for he has holpad, perhaps, against his will, to givo a sensible definition of mails and mail matter As the time for tho opening of tho Centennial International Lxhibition draws nearer, the signs which seem to show that the success of tho enteipriso is now well nigh assail ed increase and multiply in

What the foieiguer wants to know is what ho will be expected to pay if he disposes of his ex Inbits in this country, and if any thing can bo imagined likely to dis com ago him, it would be the

'J lie authority of health officers to board foreign «hipa of war on entering Port Phillip harbour was some time ago questioned by the captain of ii Russian war vessel, who de- clined to hoist tho usual flat: tor the health olficer on approaching Williamstown, or In any wa) to recognise the right of that officer to board the vessel for the purposes of health inspection The Central Beard of Health brought Iho nflulr under the notice of the Government, and suggested that the advice of the Crown law officers should be obtained. The Government was Informed that the cop tuiii of an American war vessel which visited Melbourne courteously offered all possiblo assistance, and promised to carry oat any I recommendations that might be made by the health officer or the Central Board It is considered desirable that steps should be taken to bring about the adoption of some international rule on the subject. Under present arrangements captains of different nationalities assume different positions in regard to the matter, and it is felt that it would be highly undesirable to take any step even though warranted by law, which would have the effect of creating unpleasantness in tile minds of the captains of foreign men of war visiting this port I rom a health point of view the difficulty is not regarded as of serious importance As a general rule every precaution is talen on board foreign men 01 war to prevent the spread of infec tion whenever disease breaks out among the crew and it is the opinion of the Central Board of Health that in the event of any foreign man of «or arrivinc at this port with infectious disease on board the captain would be only too glad to co operate with the health authorities of the colony in the adop tion of a'l measures which might be con sidered necessary to prevent the introduction of the disease into the colony Commissions m the British Arm) rrny bo obtained by officers in the military forces of Ivew South 'Wales, Victoria Queensland South Australia New 7ealand and the Cope of Good Hope, and according to a telegram from Hobart Tasmania has now been added to the hat Iwo army commissions nre alloted to each of the above named colonies annually 1 ach candidate tor a commission must be between the ages of 10 and 22 on the 1st of January of the year in which he is pre eented for examination The War Office also require that he shall have served at least 15 months na an officer in the colonial mill tory force from which he is nominated, and have attended two annual trainings or seen active service in the field lach candidate has to undergo the necessary medical inspection and must paBS tho pre scribed educational and military examina tiona Hie military examination includes | tile clements of field fortification and tactics, military topography, and military law.

Ihe regulation in question reads tis follows -" Members of any cadet compiny may, after leaving Behool, still remain members of the company until they are 10 years of age, or, if above the agc of 17 years, may be enrolled in any corpa of militia or mounted rifles, provided they fulfil the regu lations as regarda height and physique, and have Bcrvcd ina cadet corps for not lesa than twoyeara Boya who have left Behool may be allowed to join the cadet corps of any school, provided they arc below the age of 19 years 'J hey are, however, on no account to remain members ol the corps after that age ' On Friday the Railway Commissioners, ac- companice by the heads of branches in the Railway department, left Melbourne to in- spect the railway line in course of construc- tion from Traralgon to Bairnsdale. The line was found to be completed to within five miles of Bairnsdale, and it is expected that it will be finished to that town in the course of six weeks. The commissioners were of opinion that no special advantnge would accrue from the department consenting to take over the line until it was finished to Bairnsdale but to afford the public the use of the railway as far as Lindenow they arranged to lend the contractors (Messrs. Thornton Bros ) a carriage tor public traffic, on the understand- ing that the charges should not be in excess of ordinary departmental rates. Instructions were also issued that the railway from Stratford to Sale should be thrown open for public use during the course of the next fortnight. A special train 13 being arranged to leave Melbourne on the -'1st mat. to convey visitors from Melbourne to Sydney who may wish to participate in the forthcoming centennial celebration in the latter city It is proposed that the trim shall leave Spencer street station at about 1 o clock on the 21st, mid reach Sydney on the following tuorniiiL. at about 0 o clock A return, compiled by the officers of tbo traffic branch of tho Ballway department, ehowing the extent to which the excursion trams which were run to Adelaide during the continuance of the Jubilee Exhibition were patronised ha« been submitted to the Railway Commissioners. 1 ha total rnruber of trama run was -7, of which the earlier ones re turned the largest revenue. 'Ihe total num her of passengers conveyed was 7,aCW who yielded to tho department n return of £7,000. This amount covers the cost of the service, and leaves a small margin of profit. The amounts which the Railway depart- ment has been asked to pay to private owners as compensation for land required for the purposes of the outer circle railway have been exceptionally large. Each claim has had to be minutely investigated, and consequently there has been some delay in arriving at a settlement. The staff of valuators has been increased to enable the work to be per- formed expeditiously, and it is believed that it will be completed at an early date. The Railway Commissioners do not consider it advisable to mention the sums paid at compensation until the whole of the claims have been met. There appears to be no immediate prospect of the erection of the proposed bridgo over the River Murray at Yarrawonga. The Governments of Victoria and New South Wales agreed that the bridge should be erected by the Public Works department of the latter colony.

The bridge was estimated to cost ¿10,000 one half of which wau to be paid by each colony. The Government of New South Wales are re ported to have abandoned thoir Intention to proceed with the undertaking, owing partly to the necessity for retrenchment, and partly to their compliance With the wishes of a section ot the community, who have urged that the opening of the bridge would cause a diversion of a large amount ot trudc from New South Wales to this colony, nu., n ,.i"...

' The annual meeting of the subscribers to the Benevolent As)iura will be held at the institution at 4 p m on Thursday, January 10 The superintendent was authorised at the meeting of the committee on Thursday to ?draw up the annual report and submit it to tile next meeting of the committee for approval Messrs.

It met with some opposition from Mr. Hutchi- son, who succeeded Mr Bryce in the repre- sentation of Waitotura, and from Sir George Grey, who wished it postponed till next session The Premier intimated that he did not think it wise to ask for a subsidy for the cable between the colony and New South Wales, as he considered if it were not paying the Eastern Extension Company should raise the rates, and make those who used the cable pay A resolution waa passed autho- rising the Government to continue the pre- sent San Francisco mail service for another jcar, and then the Appropriation Bill was passed, and the session was finished a few minutes hclore 6 o'clock on the morning of the 24th. Of the work of the session it may be stated that ot the 122 bills which ongi- I nated in the Lower House and the 10 m the Council, 73 were dropped by the former and 10 by the latter. The sittings extended over 44 days, the average hours being 7 hours 31 minutes, of which Gb hours were after mid merin. General Sobaw's report on the defences of Now Zealand has (writes our Dnncdtn cor- respondent) been laid before Parliament. He advocates the re organisation of the ayatem, by which a siving of £27,417 will be effected. General Schaw states that the de- fences are in a very advanced condition. When all the guns have been mounted, as they soon will be, he recommends that a permanent force of 252 non commissioned ofiiccrs and men will be required to keep them in order and form the nucleus of the defence force. These aro to be united in ono body, called the Coast Brigade, embracing a due proportion of nrtillerymen, torpedo men, submarine miners, Bignalmen, testers, electricians, engineers, and other artificers lhere should with these be a Volunteer Coast Brigade in the same due proportions to assist the permanent corps These should number 002, and should be drawn from the volunteers at the four principal ports. In addition to these there should be a field force of 2,520 to guard againBt landing parties About 5b0 additional volunteers would be necessary for the minor ports, Dut these, it is hoped, would be houorary corps. The grand total of the force would thus bo 4,314, and would mean a reduction of the present volunteer force by 4,9b0 The General points out the advan- tage of having all arma under one head, and urges the necessity of obtaining from Eng- land competent non commissioned officers about every five y eura to tram the men thoroughly. If the By atom is brought into operation he points out that it will be neces- sary to establish telegraphic communication with a number of pointa and headlands in various parts ot the colony, where signalmen would be m a position in time of war to observe and give notice of the approach of a vcsel The Freeman's Journal recently gave some information regarding the National League lunds, which the St James a Gazette com- mends to the notice of Mr Gladstone and Ins lriends Since the first day of January last there has been received in subscriptions a sum of £31,024 5s 3d How has this immense sum been expended by the Irish patriots in charge ol the dollars ' T lie grants to evicted tenants amount to 15,070 0s 4d , and absolutely no information is vouchsafed as to the balance of £2GJ51 Is lid Nor is this all 1 rom October 1S7'J, to Juno, 18SG, the Bubscriptions from Ireland und Great Britain amounted to £80 72J 7s 9d , and from America Australia, Le , £222 343 13s. lOd It is thus seen that the loreign subscriptions are nearlj three times more than the amount raised in Ireland and Great britain , and of this only a tithe has been expended tor the purpose for which the subscriptions were ostensibly raised- the benefit of evicted tenants Madame Schiller, the celebrated pianiste, whose recent recitals in the lown hall gave so much satisfaction, will leave for Ballarat today in order to give a performance there on lnday next.
