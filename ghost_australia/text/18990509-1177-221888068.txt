, POETRY. THE DRIFTING WIND AND RAIN. The : f<mm-wroathod waves aro rolling ' Across tho angry main, And nutumn blasts are wailing A sobbing, sad retain, Ab, mo ! the droary day, love, Tha drifting wind and rain I .. A' sodden rose is tapping Against tho window pane, A ghost oc those bright summer days That ne'sr may come again. Ab, me,! the dreary day,, love, The drifting wind and rain. The angry mists are driving Above the mountain ohain, The breakers dash against the oliffi. In fierce rebellion vain, Ah, me i tho dreary day, love, The drifting wind and rain ! . 1 dream of hours whose sunshine , Waa lost in bitter pain ; , : I sigh for droame that never - May ohoer my heart again. Ah, mo ! thedseary day.lovo, Tho drifting wind and rain !
