VTas Jesv;8 a Christian* Under the title 'Was Jesus a Christian?' Mr. Charles Bright deliver^ Â» lecture last evening at the Gajety Theatre to an i.^..ienee which, spite of the wet weather, more than half -filled the theatre. In. order to decide w&at; was the meaning of 4;ne term 'Christian.' Mr. Brignt referred to the decision in the investigation into the alleged heresy of the Bev. J. Osborne, who had passed as a Christian because of hia belief in the Deity of Jesus and the Holy Ghost, the doc trine of the Atonement, and the pfenary inspiration , of the Scriptures. Jilr. Bright contrasted this with the teaching of Jesus when asked by an ' anxious inquirer' what was needed to secure eternal life, and also ' on the occasion when the day of judgment \ras I^pified ia the division of the goats and sheep. The lecturer contended that the teachings of Jesns harmonised rather with those of the Freethinker at tho present day. than with those of the Christian, and sought to show that were a similar character to uppear now, he would be found d'enoiyicing tha popular religion of the day, just as he did at -die time in which he lived. The excellent, orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Chas. Austin, performed some operatic selections.
