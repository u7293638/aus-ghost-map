Sydney -Bulletin"'has the following par on the above subject :.-Old Testrment Revisers show a further illustration that learning-is not wis dom. A man's head may bold Greek and Hebrew to bursting and he be still wanting in common-sense. The Itevised Bible is, -for - such reason, likely to get a nickname as tbe " Capeiberry Bible," as long past editions got nicknames Tor printer's errors in them. The beautifully-worded description of old age in tlie last chapier of Ecclesiastes is known to all of us. If touched at all it should, not have been made; ridiculous. Yet these, revisers have done that much in making the unthink ing to: laughs and the judicious to grieve. Everybody appreciated the sense of the ex-r pression, " Desire shall fail," as applicable to the falling appetites of old age. The revisers boggled over' if,- however-coming to- the. decision that the word ' desire* had been used for ' strnrulant/ and that the stimulant named in the Hebrew 'tixt Vras the ' caperberry,' so to call tie'capers of our dinner- table. In stead, therefore, of. writing, 'Stimulants shall fall,' which would hive been sensible, the name, of one stimul«nt only has been used. rThe caperberry shall fall,* as we now read in the Revised Version, is absolute nonsense to 99 out of every 100 Bible-readers. Coming after the-mention of' the groeshoper being a burden, it has even a comic look to some, and is""- aitpgejlter a blunder of. learning-^minus oommon-Mnse.C: L . .^x. .../ BATilBXT oi JtEMJEqs.-The Sduney Mail in aTeDent isBue, is very "heavy against pay ment of members- After referring to the recent attempt made in.
