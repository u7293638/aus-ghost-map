HORISE-STAUBING. When last I walked out on my patrol, To study the news of the day, About me I couldn't find one soul That even a word had to say. The noighbours all gone down togothor, Inconvenienced, and summoned away, Some to swear one thing or other, Fol lol the dol liddlo lol lay. The dastardly case of horse stabbing, That lately occurred on the Marsh; The offender I hope will be caught in The clutches of Justice--hold fast. And stuck to by old uncle D-n Sent oracking blue diamonds each day; Such work he will find isn't " bunkum" Fol lot the dol liddlo lo lay. I hope that he'll got a long sentence, That is, when the dog is found out; That the judge and the jury won't spare him But presently give him the route. Seond him whore friends cannot heoar him, And food him on skilly and hay, With the ghost of old Bally to jeer him, Fol lol the dol liddle lol lay. All persons-if any-gone down too Determined to noreen him-if known I hope that the Laws will award them The deserts so surely their own. Such people it is a sheer folly, To spare, or to lot go away, But send them to study geology, Fol the lol liddlo lol lay. Bacohus Marsh, 20th November, 1872,
