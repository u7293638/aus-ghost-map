St. Jude's Cliurcli. INDUCTION OIf THE NEW INCUMBENT. ON Friday night a large congregation as sembled at St. Jude's Church to witness the public induction of the new incum bent-The Rev. Gerard D'Arcy Irvine into the charge of his parish. The service was conducted principally by Dean Cowpcr, and the Rev. Canon D'Arcy Irvine, M.A.. D.D., assisted him. The address by tho Dean was based on the words " Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine, continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thy self and them that hear thee " (i Timothy, iv. 16). In the course of the address the Dean took occasion to speak very highly of the new incumbent and said that his long acquaintance with him and his knowledge of his work in different parts of the diocese justified him in saying what he did. After appropriate portions of the Bible bad been read, hymns sung, and prajers offered, the Episcopal license, and authority was read to the congregation by Mr< Oxley and delivered by the Dean into the hands of the incumbent, the Dean saying " Be thou a faithful Minister of God's Holy Word and Sacraments and a faithful pastor under the Great 'Shepherd .-of souls. The Lord preserve thy going out "and. thy coming iu from this time forth for evermore." Among the exlfortations addressed to the people was the following which we take from the " Order of Service " used : "I charge and exhort you, dearly be loved, to pray continually for this your minister called to the spiritual-oversight of this parish and to assist him zealously and lovingly in all the duties of his holy calling. " Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ." The hymn, "Come Holy Ghost our souls' inspire," having been sung and more prayers offered the service concluded by the pronouncing of the benediction. The proceedings throughout were most im pressive, and we regret that our report is not a longer one. . 1
