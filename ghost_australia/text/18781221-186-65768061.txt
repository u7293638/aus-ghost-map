It was only to be expected that some one would ?pot a hone that bad been let in on too favourable tenn, and £ believe the opinion fcaa been expressed by more than one that Prince Charlie is the most favoured of the renowned half dozen. To my idea, however, tiie impaste on the whole are warranted by performances, and I question whether they wwM fae much improved on.

Eaglet with 7st 4tte. is not fin out ; though, as ne is said to be very fit, his chance is not to be denied. Neither has Happy Jack any cause for grief in 6st lOlba. Young Whalebone and the Bainswortfi filly Dorcadiz being both untried should be about right at 6sL and Set lifts. Tfaeref ore, whilst ! according to Ins three-year old running, and j Hut Echo might have been let in with a few ' pounds less, I shall be greatly sorpriBed if the ! latter is not near the foremost rank when the whips are going, and should not be at all astonished to see the winner turn up where at pitaaut least expected. S&onld; Prince Qiarlie prove tite victor on j Thursday next, the public, a« well as the sntaenbers to the funds, will notbedinatisfied, I am certain ; for Mr. Bfynn has done so much towards encoaraging local sport of all kinds, that he has attained a well-deserved popularity amongst all classes of the commnruty. Monday evening next is the night of general entry for the Boxing Day fiaees at Xorm BockhamptoH, the place of meeting being Sir. ?Flyrm's European Hotel. From what I can hear several 01 the events are likely to have a large number of nominations ; tiius judging by pimMHil appearances everything is eoufctir -Le rott for Hoe ultimate success of tiie meeting. For the Maiden Plate the competitors will probably be Mr. Archibald's Sunshine, Visitor, Happy Jack, Dorcadiz Young Whalebone, and others. I have heard four spoken of for t&e; jumping race, and as they are all reputed clever at the sticks a really good race may be depended **' TltoBe mentioned are-.— Bede, Percy, Eildare, and Mickey Free. Eaglet, Echo, and Prince Charlie, I believe, are likely to meet in th& ladies' Parse- The Ghost is aid to have Inken down in his nllops ^?'T'ff the week, and has been thrown out of work. Only a few of the others are in the vicinity of the town, but moat of the others will put in an appearance abont ihe Fttyrtmrig of next week. As condition is »n'» I'lhtufr mder those cir **W'|H*^TH*B^ it wonld be onwise to more than of any of the events at present. Betting has not been very brisk as yet, though several sportsmen have opened books on the N. R. Handicap. A place book at 10 to 1 has induced a few to speculate, Echo, P»gT°t. and Prince Charlie having been laid every possible way, as well as another E^gM' ? tViwi^jt ? ^Vitmv* Chariie.

Weights for the Comet Handicap of £50, to be run on the 1st of January, were pub lished on Thursday last; and taken right through, I mast Bay I think Hie haTtAir^p a good one. Tt may be a doubtful pointL per haps, whether Hie Comet and ^***^^»* »'!?*''? handicappeEs would not have been nearer the made if a middle course had been taken with regard to Echo and Prince Charlie, Cor while I prefer Charlie for the Bockhampton event I certainly +1w,lf Echo is np to his t***^ in the Cometmoney. Julian, in hni old a£e, has ouitei enough to stagger under in S et. 10 lbs.; but Ifiddleton, T^glw^ Vobmteer, and Sappy Jack hare nothing to grumble at, and accord ing to performances are very fairly tooted ; Eaglet particularly so. Of tie remaining six the majority are untried, I presume, and may therefore be considered entitled to their feather weight, though I cannot folknr the reasoning that gives three and four-year- olds and aged horses the same weight unless they have appeared in pnVH«» The handicap is aa follows:— «L Ita.
