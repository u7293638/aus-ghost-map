DEATH OF MR. HARRY HAINES. AN APPRECIATION OF A VETERAN TURFITE. (By "Paynator.") The well-known sporting identity, Mr. Harry Haines, who in his time had play- ed many parts, each and all in an honour- able degree, joined the ranks of the "great majority" on Saturday evening last. His death occurred at 7 p.m. at the Club Hotel, West Perth, of which he was lessee. The career of the late "Harry" Haines on the Australian turf has been one the aftermath of which is the reflection of high credit on the name of the veteran, who, at the time of his demise, was within seven years of man's allotted span. Born at Cheltenham, England, in the year Queen Victoria ascended the Throne, Mr, Haines was educated for the Bar, but relinquished the legal profes- sion and came to Australia, when yet in his teens, and, like the majority of aspiring youths, took to the gold dig- gings. Meeting with a good measure of success, Mr, Haines became early iden- tified with the turf and all other branches of sport, and was not long in attaining rank as an amateur rider, racehorse- trainer, and owner and bookmaker, one of the leading Victorian weeklies consist- ently referring to the late turfite as the "gentleman bookmaker." A devotee of the "green cloth" from early years, Mr. Haines soon earned the title of amateur champion pyramid player of Australia, and retained his skill with the billiard cue right up till recently, with such effect that he met and defeated the world's champion billiardist, John Roberts, in an exhibition pyramids match in the Queen's Hall Perth. Mr. Haines was a member of the Melbourne Hunt Club, of all the leading Austra- lasian sporting clubs, and of the Vic- toria Club, the exclusive sporting club of London. With a number of other leading sporting identities of the time, "Harry" Haines was one of those involv- ed in the Cootamundra railway accident, which occurred a number of year back. The railway carriage shared by Mr. Haines and others was one of those im- mersed in the river and the fortunate fact that Mr. Haines had only been taught to swim three weeks previously by Mr. "Sam." Grimwood, now in Perth, saved his life. Mr Haines owned a number of race- horses in his time, several of which were the cracks of their time. This included Diomed, Mata (his,best), Cambatlo, Eu- clid, The Ghost, Firebell, Theodore, Spade, Guinea,. Bothwell, Swagman, Raoul, Mary Gladstone, Winifred, Mag- gie, Bodkin, and Warrior. He owned also a favourite old hunter, considered to be the best of his time, called Paddy. With Euclid, a son of Panic, Mr. Haines won the Adelaide Cup in 1882 ; Mata (an ex-New Zealand champion) having won the Adelaide Birthday Cup for Mr. Haines in 1881. Two years ago Mr. Haines was in part- nership with Mr. "Charlie" Watson in a turf commission agency in Perth, but he practically relinquished bookmaking, early last year. Early in the present year Mr. Haines took over the Club Hotel, West Perth. About a fortnight ago, on his birthday, Mr. Haines was sticken down with a painful illness, congestion of the liver (cirosis) and gas- tritis. Drs. Saw and Harvey, his medi- cal attendants, upon the patient's illness assuming a critical stage, called Dr. Horrocks into consultation, but their combined attention proved unavailing, and on Saturday evening the veteran breathed his last. The funeral of the deceased, which took place yesterday afternoon, was largely attended. The cortege was fully half a mile in length, representative sportsmen being among those following. The cortege travelled by road to the Karrakatta Cemetery, where the remains were interred in the Church of England portion of the cemetery; the Rev J. Ellis officiating. Mr. H. Haines (nephew of the deceased) was the principal mourner. The pall-bearers Were Messrs. F. Monger, M.L.A., H. Moses, B. Phillips, C. Wat- son, P. Fox, and G. Kirby. Among others present were Messrs.
