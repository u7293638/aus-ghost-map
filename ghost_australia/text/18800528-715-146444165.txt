The prisoner it appears was a real hardened rogue—araan who had served' several sentences-in all the prisons of the colonies, and for his safety, the corporal ordered his removal to the Robe goal. On their arrival the governor of the goal demanded the warrant, when, the trooper discovered to his surprise that it had been ( left behind him at the Kingston station, i He assured the governor ft was alb right, but that official Btood firmly onhisdignity and resolutely refused to acoommodate the culprit without the production of the warrant. The prisoner stood meekly by' and - heard- the altercation between his guardian and the inhospitable gaoler, and with a look of disgust at the latter individual, he said, "Ihave served at Yatada, Darlinghurst, Pentridge, " and- dozens of other stockades, and I have; never been refused admission, to any ' gaol before today."

Shosbr.—The Bishop of Adelaide, Dr." Short, was ex— posed to rather -a trying ordeal the -otherday {states the Australasian), and the* greatest admirer of that prelate, would hardly be disposed to maintain that he> stood it very weB. A resolution was submitted to the Synod by Mr. Downer, having for its object the amendment of the regulations of the- Ghsnh so as to pro—' vide that a resolution earned:.- by two— thirds of the- members. ©£.ibe—synod, and vetoed ty the Bishopy Should, if carried again by a two-third* vote, become law. The- Bishop thus.had. to- preside as chair- J man over'an assembly during a debate the? purpose of which was the limitation of hi® functions. 33iere was some degree, per■ haps, of awkwardnessabout this* but it is, | nevertheless,-a position in. wKiA. secular chairman and presidents .find themselves very frequently. However, the Bishop took the matter.very unpleasantly.' Ho i firit tried to suppress.' the discussion by , refusing* to ' allow the * proposer' of the motion. , to :t ttrgne the question. The Bishop's justifi^tinn for this course was that,, the : proposal was. '/repugnant to the constitution we have agreed to," the self-evident-answer, ofeewrse, being that it was thievery constitution which it; was proposed toamendi. fThe iRrabop fell into a prolonged : wrangle /with the proposer of the "motion, and in , the course of his little; interjected Bpeechesbroached Some/rather extraordinarydocrfcriaesL To Mr. Downer® remark,/ ■ ' Ho 'ypresumed that the analogy.oaLwIthjh t ihe=Rynod was founded ,1 was /that",; of :.tbe fjueen, am»V_ Lords, and tl» <Jornmohs,".

Mushroom^.—We have received from] Mr, Cutchie another- "fine : 'mushroom, ; measuring §boutJJ9 inches round. . j TheKelly Gaxg.—The second atep in oonnection with the'.Abandonment ofthe Kelly pursuit (say% * the Noriffi~ea$tern of May 21) is the withdrawal"from Ij^nalla and their restoration ito Queensland of„,the detachment, of,Queensland native ppjice, ^h^ under the leadership of I^ieijtetfeint /O'Connfer, have sd long remained here pending an outbreak of. the bushrangers. We learn that Captain Standish has given the necessary owlera for the withdrawal of the blacks, and that they will be sent home "under the charge of Mr, O'Conner at an nearly date, although it is hot known whether Mr. O'Conner will prefer to remain in "Victoria to proceeding to his future home and probable promotion. The reward, offered by the Wo Governments being withdrawn and the blacksremoved, we think there ia an early "probability of the gang again hrieaking oover ; bat the last-named step willthen in all likelihood lead to some .adverse criticisms of the polioe , management. It is generally recognised that the 'fear of the tracking power of-the Queensland "boys" has been a strong deterrent of further crimes by the gang—indeed, the! \- officers of the polioe kbow as much. Gnoe .they are removed and on the sea journeying homeward, there ia -little doubt the gang Of outlaws • will consider the coast, clear andvohmiita fresh outrage ; possibly with losa of life. Information to i hand points to °thte necessity for a replenishment of funds, - and as there are . many Banks unprotected,- a fresh crime ia • easy ofcomraittal, and it is felt certain will be committed if obce lhe .gang feel su^p , .they have only^tb deal with the ordinary ' trackers the Victorian Government can command. Most people resident-in the' bush are aWare of the fact that every bushmsn is more or less possessed of the peculiar instinct- which enables him tos follow the trail.. Morses «ud cattle are lost, and is is often by means of tracking the bush yojith.is aWc t*>. recover them. The Kelly gaqg haye not underrated the /.skill of the blackfeljows .and .the superior cunning which enables them to fellow a tniil with unerring certainty ; nor have riie many storiesT—sopm of. which are marvellous—of the feats performed by the trackers in many minor matters of crime escaped . their, -knowledge. They have known that .-should they once break their cover,. their haunts could not fail of being discovered, and hence: their long silence.^ We. are justified, therefore, in believing that when-tha danger is removed a ffresh crime is -not: only possible but probable. Whether iti&wise; to encourage a fresh outbreak first by the withdrawal of the extra garrison of police, and secondly the removal of the trackers, whilst in a short time the reward will be a thing of- the past, is a mattter of policy open toseriousquestion. Madame Sibly.—On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings Madame Sibly interested and amused fair audiences for over three hours. The proceedings werC commenced by several pianoforte selections very well played by Mrs. Goodhead. Madame Sibly then gave a short ambulatory phrenological lecture illustrating how the mode of walkdiffered in individuals of different temperaments. The bend of sympathy, the stoop of reflection, the strut of pride, the swagger of conceit, the defiance of combativeness, the glare of anger, the " leer of cunning, the frown of hatred, the expectancy of love, the gaze of adoration, the eagerness of 'hope, and the frenzy of despair were all depicted with accuracy. A short description of the organs of the brain was given, and it was shown that although a man might be naturally vicious this could be overcome by the counteracting inflnenceof some other organ .or by his training. In a like manner a man's head might indicate that he had benevolence and conscientiousness, "but these qualities might be totally hidden or lost through the unchecked" development of destructiveness. We give this to show Madam e's style those who wish to know more fully had better visit her. Having concluded her explanatory remarks, she' invited heads to come on the stage and be examined.: A good many subjects came forward each evening ; none of them were ladies, which is a fact to be regretted, as it would have done the audience good to hear properly described the virtues and endearing' qualities of the gentler and better part of us. A general outline of the characters of those- who' had gone on the Btage, with .remarks as to what they were most'adapted for were given, and were in j most of the cases so near the troth as to evoke the plauditB of the audiepce. After- the living models had. been diBmissed on Wednesday evening, Madame : Sibly said that on the next Monday night, which would be her last night here, she wonld invite a few ladies to ascend the ! platform, and-submit their heads for her! to delineate their characters for the 'benefit of themBelveB, the hearers, and science. It was not stated if it wonld be neceesary to cut off the hair; we think it is not, but it is probable that the wearing \- of falsehair would affect the truthfulness of the result. It is to be hoped that the natural basbfulnessr of the sex will not stand in . the way - of their bumps being " -read. Monday-night will be looked forward to with interest. The second part of the:, entertainment consisted - of ' an \- exhibition-- of etep dancing by-^Mr. T. King, and a mesmeric seance by Madame Sibly. Then entertainment will be repeated this 'evenings to-morrow, and on . Monday night. • We may state that - the lecture - is -different each evening. This evening the fbeads of children as well as of adults wilbbe esadiined. . . ' . Wants oF%^Somdetj?^BT.—On Satnrd^^EasifSZ^tSe' Hon.

After discussion it was resolved that if the stores' here will promise to close on Monday, 21st June, a challenge be sent to .the Kingston Cub to play a match on that day. The Secretary, Mr. Lyall was requested to see the proprietors of the stores, mid if they ©cnsented to close to advertise it in the. Herald, and to make arrangements for securing aspecial train to and from Kingston. The price of the return tickets will be 10a. ft was suggested by -Mr. McGilchrist that single "tickets at 6s. each be also issued. . This met with the approval of the Committee and it will probably be adopted. It was thought that the Club had. been greatly hampered in the past by the expense of the match dinners and jt was derided that in future matches no dinner be given. Rainfall sob.
