MUNICIPAL. In addition to the sum agreed upon for the organ performances by Mr. Best, the City Council on Thursday voted the sum of JE200 to that gentleman. A motion to connect the Newtown and Marrick ville tramway with the new line f com Bedfern to Moore Park, by running a tram from Newtown road by way of Cleveland-street to Castlereagh sfcreet, Eedfern, was under consideration by the ,Darlin-zton Council last evening, and the matter ^was referred to tbe Minister for Public Works. At a special meeting of the Newtown Council, called to discuss tbe question of introducing the electric light into that and the adjoining boroughs, a resolution confirming the principle ?was submitted ; but owing to the small attend ance of members of the council, its consideration tv as postponed to the next general meeting. The collective wisdom of Prospect and Sher 'wood cudgelled its brains on Thursday night to arrive at a fitting designation for their reserve, which adjoins a cemetery. Alderman Hollier, referring to tbe reserve, said, ' It is a beautiful site ? ' ' Yes, for ghosts !' interjected the cynic of the council, Alderman Jones.
