SPORTING. Nearly the whole of the Victorian horses which were running at our ajituinn meetings have been sent bacjk to Melbourne. Messrs. T. Hales, E. Power, S. G. Cook, and W. Hickenbotham have also returned to Victoria. The opening meeting of the Adelaide Hunt Club will take place on Saturday next at Netherby. Members have been invited to luncheon by Mr. John Pile. Special passenger trains will bo run on Saturday next on the occasion of the Gawler Races. They will leave Adelaide at 10.10 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. for Gawler, returning at 5.35 p.m. and 5.57 p.m. Excursion tickets available by these trains only will be issued. Very satisfactory acceptances were received last night for the meeting. Sir Michael has gone into Scobie'e stable. He left with Dreamland and Acton for BaJlafat on Monday. Hear Hear was returned to T. Burn's stable after the Rose Park Handicap had been run on Saturday. The Ghost, a steeplechaser, and Eaglehawk, who are engaged at the Gawler Meeting, have arrived at Gawler from the Barrier district. The Actress, who shaped so badly in the A.R.C. Steeplechase when well backed, was sent home on Monday. Sbaddrick has returned to Quorn with Briaem&rk; and Dumps. There is a slight falling-off in the entries for the Melbourne and Caulfield Cups this year, there being 137 in the two-mile race as against 149 last year, while the respective figures for the Caulfield Cup are 138 and 154. The nominations for the V. A.T.C. Futurity Stakes have not come up to expectations. The A ryus, referring to the last- named event, writes:—" The Caulfield people have failed to score a success with their Eubority Stakes; in short, as far as the entries are concerned the event is a froat. There appears to have been a combination amongst the breeders not to encourage a stake for which entries for foaLs are asked, and instead of the uxpactcd 300 nominations, the total, foals sjid all, is only 117. As pointed out, the conditions are anything but liberal, and though the prize which may be won is a big one the event has not bpen made attractive to owners in otherdirections. For instance, thB owners of now foals and yearlings have to pay 10 sovs each to see their weights, and the owners of the older horses 15 sovs. each. The club will probably lose over their First "Futurity Stakes, and we are hardly likely to see entries asked for tho ' Second Futurity' under the present conditions." The following table will show the list of entries reoeived by the V.R.C. for their principal events during the past seven years:— Kame of Bace. ,LB901891I1S92 18D31SMlS3. r i 1S96 Mrfboorae Cup ... 150 164; 135] 129: 1:6 149 137 Champion S takes .. 63 G7 56' £9' Ca: 60 57 Maribymong Plate 871 94i S4| 64.

Already an extensive double-event business has been transacted in Melbourne over the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups at 1,000 to 1. According to a leading Victorian excliange a South Australian- owned horse is the strongest fancy for the Melbourne Cup. The two-year-old colt by Gang Forward from Paigle haa been named Lord Brajiey. He has been nominated for the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups. Seventv-four horses were nominated for the Moonee Valley Cup and Purse ou Monday, aa against sixty-one last year. The only South Australian entry is Thunder Queeu. Tha steeplechaser Larrikin, with whom the late Tom Corrigan was associated, lias been purchased by Mr. W. Glassco.-.k. Larrikin is to be sent to India after the jumping season is concluded. Deerfoot, who has been nominated for the V.R.C. Grand National Steeplechase, was tried over the big sticks at Caulfield on Monday, and is reported to have acquitted himself creditably. _ Amongst, the entries for the V.R.C. Grand National Hurdle Race and Steeplechase is the F name of -RedJeap. Mr. Miller, however, is also represented in the Hurdle Race by Artist, Leslie, and Preston, while he has Latnook, Dart, and Whernside to choose from in the Steeplechase. Dungan has been nominated for both the Hurdle Race and Steeplechase. The yearling gelding by Vengeance from Dun^.ter has been named Vindictive. He has gone mto W. Morrison's stabia. Among the nominations for the Toorak Handicap is the two year-old sister to Maluma, who appuars without a name. If Mr. Redfearn neplcjled to nive the ally a name when nominating her (as he seems to have done) she is not eligible to run, as the rule (writes the Argus) states that no entry shall be accepted in respect ol a horse over one y ear old unless such horse be described by name, A £36 stake, limited to 24 dogs, will be run ill connection with the Hoyleton Coursing Club on July 112 and 2.",. Nominations are due with the Secretaries, Messrs. E. Langrehr and J. Wauchope. on .Tuly 17. The draw -will take place at the Hoyleton Hotel the same evening. THE GAWIjER JOCKEY CLUB RACES.
