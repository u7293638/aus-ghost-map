A Ghost Story. A sweep had been employed by a farmer, who lived in an extremely lonely spot. It was late when his work was finished, and he asked "permission to sleep in the barn. This was readily granted. In the "night the sweep was aroused from his peaceful slumbers by hearing the barn door cautiously open. He looked up and saw two men enter, who at once set down the lantern they had been carrying, and proceeded to fill two sacks with the farmer's best malting barley. " If," said one of the thieves, "we had someone to hold the lantern up, we shouldn't belong." " No," agreed the other ; " wish we. had someone." " I'll hold the light for you," offered the sweep, coming forward politely. The men turned. Their hair rose on end at the supposed apparition. With a blood- curdling yell, they both rushed from the barn. Not till next morning did it dawn on the sweep that the two men had mistaken him for his Satanio Majesty, or one . of his angels. No more barley was taken from that barn.
