But the infidelity which the priests deplore is a good infidelity.i It is the natural recoil from believing too mnch. It is the re-assertian'bf manhood, long oppressed, and degiaded. It is the denial of a claim which was false from the beginning. It says to the priests — " Ye have mocked us too long ; you have ridden on us too long ; you have long made, asses of us : you have frightened us witli your ghosts.untiLwe.. could not go to bed without your lying incantations.; you . have1 . flayecPus alive; but !we ! will : believe you 1 no "longer 'p Arid even when you speak the truth' to us,ywe! feel; instinctively as ifX'yoi.hfidlf'Bbihe1 design to ' impose upon 'us : your ' lies' and your assumptions, always ' affirmed t'Avi.tb'i great ; mouthings,' -'we' / will- - receive /no' l6her;;>nd,it',thiS3beH;ibfidelity,tHey:W aire infidels ; if this ! be yil|, then we shall1 make ourselves still"' more' vile Tn' your sight." b-.'.ia.i.-K What, then does D r.

So ; sure is lie of this that lie has kindly undertaken, . atgreaf'sacfiy fice of time rarid feeling,. torgo to Pyrmdht' to declare it."

They are- all iii the same condition. They are all doomed . They are all onthe way to infidelity. They are in different:stages of melting ; but 'the mass into which all of them' are to be fused is the dead and hopeless -mass iof- infidelity ; and, when1 this stage' is reached, only one of two things remain,' viz., either the " Church: of Rome' or no Church at all." ;;/-: ,'i; /?:.//;: j Which alternative would.be tlie worse ? For our part, we deliberately !say;,-thatjwe prefer " the - no Church. at ' all to ' tlie' Church of Rome." Give us our common sense; give us our civil and religious liberty ; give us our Bible— and we prefer nO'Church at all to. the Church of Rome/ Out of the confusion- will come' order '; but' out' . of the dead corruption i of Popery5 there is' no hope: without a miracle.' - . But do 'things really indicate this approach to Popery, on the one hand, or ib trio Church on the other ?" We don't' believe it. We can read>the signs of :tbe times as well as Dr. Yaiighan. At any rate,. wo care to read them. And: they say to us, in very significant language, The ages of faith are gone. If you don't prove your point, you have no point. If you are unable to give a reason for the faith/that is in you, you are a humbug.' Bat the-daysofhumbogandcant and priestliness are now and for ever beyond recall. m. / i
