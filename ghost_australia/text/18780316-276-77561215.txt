teMler, . AMONG THE GEYSERS. THE Lower Fire Hole Basin is another remarkable place in the National Park, -though not equal to the npper one, from which it is separated by a low divide. Still there are in it a great number of geysers ?exhibitingan infinite variety of fine structure, appearance, and size, "some small, some large, meriting almost to be called little ?lakes, and containing vast volumes of boiling -water; others mere cracks or fissures in surface, occasionally ejecting air or liquid, like the diminutive puffing-holes one meets 'With on the sea-shore." Sometimes it is ilica or flint that is deposited; at other times iron, or silica and iron together, mixed in some cases .with sulphur also. Old ?springs are here constantly dying ont and new ones springing into life, the pine-trees standing near springs, coated with deposit, and yet in full life, show that the outbreak of these springs must be something of very modern date. Numerous bare patches in the forest indicate where springs and geysers once have been, and in many little lakes or ponds are buried the remains of extinct geysers. There are also various mud volcanoes in this basin. The Fire Hole. 'River flows through the basin. Its waters are warm, and much appre ciated in cold weather by flocks of "geese and ducks. The whole of the river sides are "honeycombed and pitted with 'springs, ponds, and mud-pots, furrowed with boiling streams, gashed with Assures, and gaping with chasms, from which issue hollow rumblings, as if great stones were rolling round and round, or fierce, angry ' snarls and roars. The ground sounds hollow .under foot. The track winds in and out among holes that puff sulphur flames or squirt water at you; by great caverns that reverberate hideously, and yawn to swallow . you up, horse and all; crosses boiling streams which flow over beds composed of a hard . crust, coloured yellow, green, and red, and , skirted by great cisterns of boiling, seething water. The crust feels as if it might break , through; at any moment and drop you into fire and flames beneath, and nnimnlg tread gingerly upon it. You pass a translucent lovely pool, and are nearly pitched into its ' -hot: azure depths by your mule, which ' violently shies at a wKte puff of steam , maliciously spitten in its face through a minute fissure in the path. You must needs . examine into that ragged-mouthed cavern, and start back with more agility than grace to escape from a sudden flood ol hot water, which spitefully, and without warning, gorgta ctat an'd vrets yOtbrotngb, Tire uix is full of subdued, strange noises-distant grumblings as of dissatisfied ghosts, faint Bhrieks, satirical groans, and subterranean lauRhter- as if imprisoned devils, though exceedingly uncomfortable, were not beyond being amused at seeing a fresh victim ap proaoh. You fancy you can hear the rattle of the loom, the whirl of wheels, the clang and clatter of machinery; and the impres sion iB borne upon the mind that you are in the manufacturing department ot Inferno, where the skilled hands and artisans, doomed to hard labour, are employed. I' can compare it only, to one's feelings in an iron foundry, where one expects every moment to step or^a pieoe of hot iron, to be run through the atomach by a bar of white glowing metal, to be mistaken for a pig and cast headlong into a furnace, or be in some way burned, scalded, or damaged."
