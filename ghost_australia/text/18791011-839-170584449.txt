? * ? ... 'I', A STORY OE1 TBE LATIN QUARTER. | ?;' Hk is one of the Amerioans,' his fellow' ;locatairei said among themselves. 'Poor, jand alone in bad health. A queor follow.' Having mado this reply to those, who quoa jtioned thorn, they wore in the habit of dis.j .mibing the eubjeot lightly. After all it was .nothing to them, sinoe he had never joined their oirole. : They were a gay, good-natured lot, and ;made a point of regarding life as airily na, possible, and taking enoh day as it oamo with [fantastio good oheer. The house— which istood in one of the shabbiest corners in,. the, Latin Quarter— waa full of thorn from floor 'to garret— artists, students, models, Fxonqh, 'English, Amerioans, living ' all of them ?merrily, and by no .means tho. moat regular of . lives. But tliero were good' friendB. among ,them ; their world was their own, .and they iound plenty of sympathy. in their lore's and jquarrels, their luok and ilUhiok. Upon the whole there w&b; more ill-luok than luok,'^ 'Luoky men did not obooae for their, head-, quarters sunh places as this rather dilaoi ,dated buildiog,— they oould .afford, to 'go elsewhere, to plaoes where the Quarter was .bettor, where the stairs were less riokety,' the . passages less dark aud the concierge not tdven to ohronio intoxioation. Here camo , the ; unlnoky ones, whose ill-luok was of -various orders and degrees : the ydnng ones who were some day to taint Diotnren whinii would be seen in the I?alais de l'lbdustrie, and would be greeted with aoolainalions by an appreciative publio; the older ones who had painted pioturoa whioh had been seen at the Fajais de l'lDdnstfie, and had hot been appreciated at all ; the poets whose sonnets were of too subtle an order to reaoh the common herd; the students .who had lived beyond the means allowed them by their highly respeotable families, .and who were consequently, somewhat off oolour in, the eyes of the respectable families in question — those and others of the Bame olaBB, all more or leas poor, more or leas out at elbows, and more or losa in debt. And yet, as I have oaid, they lived gaily. They painted, und admired or criticised eaoh other's pictures ; they lent and borrowed .with equal freedom; they bemoaned their wrongs loudly, and sang , and laughed more londly still as the mood seized them ; and any Bpeoial ill- fortune befalling one of then: number generally aroused a display of sympathy which, though it might not last long, was always a source of oonsolation to the luokless one. But the American, notwithstanding he had been in the houso for months had never bo ;come ono of them. Ho had been seen in tho :early spring going up tho stairway to his room, which waa a mere garret on tho sixth Btory; and it fetid been expeoted among thorn ithat in a day or so ho would presont himsolf for inspection. But this ho did' not do, and when ho encountered any of thoir number in his out-goings or in-comings he 'returned' , thoir greetings gently in imperfect Fronch. He spoke slowly and with difficulty, but there was no cbldneBS in his voice or manners, and yet nono got inuoh further than tho greeting. He was a young fellow, scarcely of middle height, frail in figure, hollow-chestod, and with a gentle face and soft, deeply sot, dark eyes. That ho worked hard and lived barely it was easy enough to discover. Part of each day ho spent in tho various art galleries and after his return from these visits ho was seen no more until tho following morning. '?Until tho last ray of light disappears he is at his easel,' said a young student whom a gay esoapado had temporarily banished to tho fifth floor. ' I hear, him move now and then and cough. Ho has a villainous oough.' ' Ho is ono of tho enthusiasts,' said an other. ' Ono can rend it in his face. What fools ihoy aro— those enthusiasts ! They throw away lifo that a crown of laurel may bo laid upon thoir coffius.' Iu the summer some of thorn managed to leave Paris, and the rest had enough to do to organise their littlo oxoursions and make the best of the suushino, shndo and warmth. But when those who had been away returned and all settled down for tho winter, thoy found tho ' Atnorican,' us they called him, in his old place. Ho had not bsen away at all ; ho had worked as hard as ever through midsummer hoat and autumn rain; he was. f railor in figure, his olothos were more worn, his face was thinner and his eyes far too hollow and bright, but ho did not look either discouraged or unhappy. 'How does he live?' exolaimed tho, con- cierge, dramatically. ' Tho good God knows 1 He eats nothing, he has no fire, he, wears, the clothing' of midsummer — ho paints— he paints— he paints I Perhaps that is enough /or him. It would not be for me.' At this time— just as the, winter entered with bleak winds and rains and falls of. powdery snow — there . presented herself; among them an arrival whose appearance oreatou a sensation. One night, on his way upalaira, the American found himself confronted on the fourth floor by a flood of light streaming through tbe open door of a before nnoocupied. room. It was a small,,, room, t meagrely furnished, but there was; a fire in.it, aud'jhalf a-aozen people who, laughed un,d ,talked,..at. the top of their voioes. . Five of tbom.iwere men he. had seen beforo.TT-artists who- lived, in the honse, — but the, sixth was a. woman, whom he had never seen, and whoso mar vellous beauty held him spell- bound where he stood. ' Bho was a woman of twenty-rtwo, or three, with an oval faoe whoso fairness was, tho (airnoss of ivory. She was ; dark-eyed, and low-browod, and, as she lean.od forward: upon the table and looked up at the man, who spoke to her, even tho bright, glow ot the lamp, whioh burned direotly before her. face, showed no flaw in either tint or outline. ' Why should we ,uBk the reaBon v-f your return?' said thomuu. 'Let nsrejoico that you aro here.' ' I will toll you tbe roason,' she answered, without lowering her eyes. 'I was tired.lf ' A good reason,' was the reply, She pushed he» chair;, back and , stood upright; hor hands, bung at hereidea; the men, were all loplting at net; buo, smiled down at, them with full irony. 'Who among you wishps to paint mo ?'', she said, 'lam again at youriBervioe, .and I am not less handsome than I was.'. Then there arose among, them , a little rapturous murmur, and somehow it i broko the spell, which had routed upon the j man, outiide. He started, shivered slightly, and turned away. He went up to tho bare., oold-, ness of his own room ana eat. down,- forget ting that it wan either ooH .or .bare. Suddenly, as he looked at tho, woman's upturned ? faoo, a great longing had' Botaed upon him. , 'iBhonld like to paint you-~I,' he found himself saying to the , silence ? about him. ' If I might paint, you !' He heard the next.day who Bha,wa8, Tho icoiioidiv/B waa ready enough to give1 him 'more, (information than be 'hftdiaeked. /? . : ? ; : ??;,? .i ; .'?.'

She gave him still another long look. 'No,' she. said. 'I will borne to, you to-morro\v if you will difeot me to your room!' 'It is on the sixth floor,' he replied ; ' tho highest of all. ^It is a bare little placo.' J. will come, Bno Baid, and was turning away when ho stopped her. 'I— I should like to tell you how grateful I, am— V ,he;beg»n. . . . ','?'/?-? ''?.'.; 'There is no need,' Bhe responded, with bitter lightness. V Yoa will pay mo some day— when you are 'a. great artist.' But when she reaohed 'the', next landing she glanoed down and saw that he Btill stood beneath,, watohing her. ' The next day she kept her word and went to him. She found his room poorer and barer even than she had fancied it' miglit be. The oeiling was low and slanting, and in one. corner stood a narrow iron bed stead, in another a wooden table; in the beat light the small window, gave hie eaiel was plnoed with a ohair before it. When he had opened the door in answer to her summons, and she uaw all this, she glanoed qniokly at his faoe to see if there was uny shade of confusion upon it, but there was none. He appoared only rejoiced and', eager. ' I felt sure it was you,' he said. 'Were youthen bo Bure that I would oome ?' she asked. ' You said you would,' he answered. He plaoed her as he wished to paint her, and then sat down to. his work. In a few moments he was completely absorbed in it. For a long time he did not speak at all. The utter silence whioh reigned — o silence which was not 'only a suspension of speech but a suspension of any other thought be yond his task— was anew experience to her. His cheek flushed, his eyeB burned dark and bright; it seemed aa if he Boaioely breathed.: When he turned to 'look at her she was consoious eaoh time of a sadden thrill of feeling. More than onoe he' paused for several moments, brush and palette in hand, simply watohing her face. At one of these pattBes she herself broke the ailenoe. ' Why do you look at me so ?' she asked. ' You look at me as if — as if — ' And Bhe broke off with an uneasy little laugh. He roused himself with a slight start and coloured sensitively, passing hiB hand aaross his forehead. ' What I want to paint is notalwaya in yonr faoe,' he answered. ' Sometimes Hose it, and then I must wait a little until— until I find it again. It ia not only your face I want, it _ is - yourself— yourself 1' And he made a sudden uuoonBoious gesture with, his honds. She tried to laugh again — hard and lightly as before,— but failed. ? ' 'Myself!' Bhe said. ? 'Jlfon Dieu! Do not grasp at me,' Monsieur. It will not pay you. Paint -my flesh, my hair, my eyes—, 'they are good— but do not paint me.'' : Ho looked troubled. / ' I am afraid my saying that sounded stilted,' he returned,: f I explained myself poorly. It-is not easy for me to exphxin. mysolf well.' i ..'?r understood you,V sho.Baid; 'and I i have warned you-' ; They did not apeak: to eaoh . other again during the wholo sitting, oxoeptionoo, when''. ho aeked her if she was. warm enough. . ' I. have a fire to-day,' he said. ' 'Have you not always a fire?' abe asked. ' No,' he answered, with a smile'; ' but when you. oomo there will 'always be one.!? 'Then,' she add, 'I will come often, that I may.Bave you from .death.'1; 'Oh !' he replied ; 'it is easier than you think to forgot that one is oold,'.' ' Yea,' sho returned. ' And it is easier than you, think for one to die.' . When Bhe was going away Bhe made a movement toward tho easel, but he stopped' her. ''''.' 'Not yet,' he said. ' Not' just yet.',' Ehe drew babk.' . 'I have, never oared [to] look, at myaeli before,' Bhe said. 'I do not . kno^y why. I should oare now.
