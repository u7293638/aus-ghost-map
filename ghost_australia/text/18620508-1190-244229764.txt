Distinct, auriferous quartz reefs, 42. ; There is little' to bo said of this place, for there is too little water for the alluvial, and too, much for the quartz miners. The reports from tho Lochlan and tho Jordan liavo . had tlieir full effect upon tlio already reduced population, nnd many miners are pre paring forimraediate departure. About Huntly, which was lately teeming witli an active popu lation, not a man is now at work, and through all. tho gullies and flats the only portion now flourishing is a emnll part of tlio deep lead, tbo whole of which may bo comprised in an area of twenty acres.

Distinct auriferous quartz reefs, 9. There is very little eliango here, all sluicing operations being o'icckcd by tlio drought. Except at ono reef on the Reedy Creek, there is no mining going oil.

Distinct auriferous quartz-reefs, 118. Never wns eo much depression known in this dis trict before as that which now exists, owing solely to1 the want -of water. The result, is muoh distress, among the miners., Tltc con struction, of tlio proposed resorvoir.-nnd.n more cxtonsivo acquaintance with the great capabili ties of tlio district,:will, however," soriii bring, about porrinnent prosperity. Early in Fobru-' .nry, a rush took place to tho eastern side of Mtlyor Creek, near tho Criterion Hotel,, iri coriscqiiebcc of tho reported discoyery bv some Ohinaincn of the lost Creek Lenil. No lend wnB found, but payablo gold has been struck. Many claims which wore taken up, abandoned, arid re-taken up, haTO turned out golden holes. Tho great want is a spirit of enterprise; , In tho neighbourhood of Oostorfield,- every claim", now ubahdoncd would pay handsomoly. , There is abundance of first-olass timber, fit for'.overy/ purpose, at hand, and a first rato pprmrinont 'supply of water pouldpasily.bo secured. . ! xuryborough district.1 " !

Quartz mining in this district has a healthy tone, nnd tho results of crushing will compare favourably with those of other divi sions! Towards tho southern portion of) the division: there are - frequent rushes of minor importance. Tlio last took place to the Emu, in consequonco of tlio. discovery of a ten ounce 'nugget at the bottom of ra twenty foot .hole.

Penny aud twopenny tnx03 in a colony with a f«w hundred, thousand inhabitants will ssnrcely pay for oolleotion. Tlie best tariff the colony ever had was that which was in force 12 ryoars ago ; and ai the circumstances of the colo- ni.ts ore every dny heooming moro like what they wotc then, it would not be unwise to rf-fotrf duce Uia rcvenne laws ,as they stood at that period. Cirndually alltlUDsa-are reverting to tlieir old staudard, aud thu'sooner we can gob rid of tho j; ideas cngeudored by.y the feverieli exoltement of j the last few yea-s, the sooner will we starts npon a fresh career' of moderato Drogress and co'isequent prosperity.— Gcclon g Advertiser, fob.
