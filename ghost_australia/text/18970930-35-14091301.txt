In the first place, the loss of C A Richardson, whose duties have taken him to Brisbane, is irreparable, for he led the team since its inception, in addition to proving of service in the batting" and invaluable as a short-slip or short- stop Unfortunately the loss does not end here CTR Turner, after experiencing dama fortune's frowns, also went north in search of fresh fields and pastures new and up there also is b Deane J hua, three good me Fire lost to East Sydney and New South Wales As though the East s cup of bitterness were not sun ciently filled, C Pitt, one of the club's best box here, is thinking of retiring from the team and Camplin) has been removed to Goulburn Two good men in T Spurway, late of Waverley and J Sheridan, late of Zingari, have decided to throw in their lot, and if the former could but recover his form of the year that he bowled for Warwick he should prove an acquisition Sheridon last season showed burne good cricket on the Rushcutter s Bay Oval and he should get runs, but Turner s and Pitt's al space will be severely felt in the bowling There will still be available V A Richardson J Gould, and others that figured last season and there is a chance of the New Zealander, L A. Cuff, playing for the Test Another electorate that cannot look forward to a more successful season than last ia Central Cumber- land for both F. Iredale and S If Walford have departed to win fresh laurels elsewhere tin fortunately there is some doubt about T irquhar'j donning the flannels for as far back as last Easter, at Newcastle, he hurt his back and is still occasionally painfully reminded of the injury. There are, however, two or three new men who have announced their intention of representing Central Cumberland, notably I Dockers the old Albert and intercolonial player, but one from Perth, who a few years ago was a rating batsman and 13 Paid to still no less merit in that direction Then there is 11 promising colt in Bergerac, who makes his debut in senior cricket from the Parramatta Junior Association He is looked forward to as supplying the position of best all-round men That, however, is hardly possible while L Pye keeps up his form Other recruits are Jackson a good bat and hotter field Kennedy, Fowler 1 at, and Cold Pobilbard,", both bat and splendid field, and Robertson, a left-hand bowler with nice break from leg, who carried off the bowling honours in the local Junior Association, taking 70 rickets at an average cost of seven runs the old men, W Howell, J Wilson, Laverulgj, Miller L Pye, Donohue and O'UciHj together with those previously mentioned, will, notwithstanding Iredale and Walford's resignation, require a lot of beating Great improvements have been carried out on the ground in the south-eastern corner 1000 tons of soil have been spread and these fill up the horse dip, and probable by the time these comments to the fight the new rail ion, to COst Â£211, will have been started The Englishmen are to play a match on the ground The electorate that will show a decided improvement during the ensuing year in Waverley, in every department of the game, but more particularly in that which the public appreciates most, namely, hotting Straightaway it may be said that two of the '90 Australian team have thrown their lot in with the extreme eastern suburbanites They are S E Gregory and T A Iredale, whose qualifica- tions do not require dwelling upon It is singular that the former has hitherto, or at least for a couple of seasons not shown his true batting form in club cricket, but probably as he has more settled evidently permanently in Waverley, his services may prove more valuable. Amongst the big influx of members there are, in addition to the above couple, P Kelly and Carter, the latter a wicketkeeper that comes with a reputation from a local junior club, and Callaway the erstwhile crack bowler The selection committee will have con- siderable difficulty in selecting the team for there will be no fewer than six cured dates for the eleventh place With the exception of J.
