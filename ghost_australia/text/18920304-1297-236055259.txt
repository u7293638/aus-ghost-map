FISHER'S GHOST. to tiie editor of the daily telegraph. air, — In roply to Mr. Ferey Ii. Meggy s let ter in your issue of the 2nd inst. with regard to 44 Fisher's Ghost," I would like to bo allowed to say that this very old story can bo found on pages 6 to 9 of Household Words (then conducted by the late Charles Dickens) for March 5, 1853, No. 154. It is also given in a collection of 44 Australian Stories," by (I think) John Lang, and also in a littlo work called 44 Australian Stories Retold,'1 by Mr. W. H. Suttor, M.L.C., published by Glyudwr Wbalau, Ba-thurst, 1887. The account given in tho last-mentioned work is slated to be taken from the Sydney Gazette, the Monitor, and the Australian for the first week of February, 1827. It also states there llmt the story was published in Montgomery Martin's book on the colonics written in 1835, and in J'tu/y's Monthly Annual for 1836. Mr. Sutter's account gives the date of tho 44 ghost" as 1826, and states it was supposed to have appeared at Campbclitown, N.S.W. Household Words gives the appearance as taking place at Penrith, but has no date.' To get any 44 authcutic particulars with veri fication," as asked for by Mr. Stead, is, I think, impossible, the whole thing as regards any supernatural agency being apparently wliat is looked upon as a 44 ghost story " and treated as such by people familiar with it. Apropos of the 44 Real (?) Ghost Stories," I may also say that the account given m a letter on pac 38 of tiie same may be found in 14 Man and his Relations," by S. B. Britten, M.D., New York, W. A. Townseud and Adams, 1868. And the story on page 33 ol tiie gentleman's 44 wraith" being seen by his wife going into a publichonso is very delight- i ful as a humorous anecdote, but can hardly i uo uu\\.uii nutiuuiy, u ii i j u g Li pciuajja xu la uc i 4 'real" as most of the others. — Yours, etc.. 5 UNBELIEVER. Sydney, March 3.
