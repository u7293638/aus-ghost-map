THE TRAGEDY AT'HAUNTED STREAM. A TERRIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS CRIME. THE INVESTIGATION OF DETECTIVE SERGEANT CONSIDINE. The inv estigation of the circumstances of the death of John Cohen at Stirling, or Haunted Stream, on the 5th mst has been a difficult one, and Detective Sergeant Con- sidine, who has had charge of it, returned to Melbourne yesterday without a prisoner, though the death was undoubtedly due to foul play of a more than usually terrible character His inquiries hav e not been fruit less On the contrarj, lie has obtained much evidence of an íniDortant character which may have a grave bearing upon the developments of the details ot the trngedj But at present there ia nothing tangible, and though there is a good prospect ot the mystery being cleared up there is also a chance that Haunted Stream, which owes or rather owed for its name has been changed to Stirling-its name to an un avenged crime, will be noted in the calendar as the scene of u second which has baffled the intelligence of the police The rature of Detective Considine s ev idence cannot yet be revealed, because it is incomplete, and disclosure nt this juncture would be ex tremely unwise, but the broad details of the scene of the crime are av tillable Haunted Stream, now dignified bj the name of Stirling, is a collection of a handful of vv catherboard and corrugated houses and huts situated on the Haunted Stream Creek It is 42 miles bejond Bairnsdale, and is up proached with difficulty. From Bairnsdale a coach runs us far as Omeo, dropping passengers for Stirling at Tambo Crossing Thence to Stirling, a distance of 10 miles has to be accomplished, according to the capa bihties of the traveller If he can ride and has nerve he will succeed well enough If he cannot he must walk, for there is no driving track . The road is mountainous, and the bridle track at times overhangs steep precipices, where a fall would be fatal. Along the route the scenery is charming and the hills and valleys, which are clothed with good timber, are at present yellowing into gold with the bloom ol the wattle Stirling itself is on the bank of the creek, and its situa tion surrounded by hills, is most picturesque Once a thriving quartz mining locality, but now a sleepy diggers hollow, it boasts a population ot 22 souls all told, and a history rich in traditions, such as arc common to all mining townships The best authenti cated of these traditions, and one which holds first place in the estimation of the " people of Stirling because it named the Haunted Stream, is that concerning the death of " Ballarat Harry "He was known by no other name, and in the early days he was a prominent character in the shifting population of the locuhtv He finallj dis appeared between the diggings and Omeo, and his mate who had accompanied lum in his prospecting excursions, returned alone Hie mate, now long since dead was in possession of Ballnrat Harry s vvutch and chain, some of his clothes, and m addition au unusunllj large amount of nione} He explained that he had won them from "Harri at cards, and that when ' narrv found he was financially crushed he Bevered the partnership and started off on his own account What became of bira has never been learned 'Hie mate was arrested and charted with his murder, hut as the boaj could not be found the charge was abandoned A\ hen the 1 leilhome case w as engaging attention ' Ballarat Harry was commonly credited m that district with being the ' Real Sir Roger, and up and down the little creel; mysteri ous noises were heard at night, and ghostly nppintions were said to have been seen bj lonely diggers till the creek gained the reputation of being haunted by the ghost of Sir Roger tichborne, otherwise ' Ballarat Harry ' Here, where quartz reefing w us at one time successfully follow ed, mid »lieie a mechanics institute still stands to mark the prosperous post, John Cohen established a general grocery store live years abolie sold it to a mun named David Tait, and came to Melbourne to carrs on the business of a produce merchant m Sydney road, Brunswick, but two years or so later he returned and acquired a share in the store Ile and Tait continued partners up to the lost, and while lait followed the pursuit ot mining Cohen managed the store Cohen waa d4 years of age and unmarried He was ot a quiet and sober disposition, and by temperance and frugality and attention to business was generally esteemed to be in comparatively comfortable financial circum stances '1 mt mid Cohen slept in the same building-one room, built oi zinc and lined with pine boards 22ft long by 18ft broad 30 j arils distant lrom the store, from which it was separated bv an empty hut Next the sleeping room on the other side was an unoccupied butchers shop, and these two were senaratcd by w. small fassage way blocked at the rear On nday night lflth mat, Cohen and lint vunt to bid befoie 10 o clock, the iormer sleeping in the north east corner ot the room, and the latter m the south east I arly on the morning of the next day-probably l8 minutes past 3 o clock, as Cohen s watch w as found to nave stopped nt that hour-Ldward Cohen, a young mull 27 years of age, and brother of John Cohen who lived a few yards on the western side of the butchers shop, was awakened by an explosion He got out of bed and found that the house occupied by Ins brother and Init was in ruins A hasty (dance failed to show him any signs of either of the partners, and he went to the house of a miner named Burt, who lived 110 yards away, and sought Ins assistance to explore the ruins Burt returned with Cohen, and found Tait lying amongst the broken timber alongside his bed, portion of which had been shattered Ile was in a da?ed condition, and Ins arms and face were bruised and cut 'Ihe body ot Cohen was found 10ft awaj, and it bore many injuries, which must liavecausedmstantatieousdeuth "Hie building was totally wrecked, and Cohen s body must have been blown through the roof mid have tullen where it was found Hie preliminary investigation made by the local police revealed that the explosion was due to dvnamite placed under the lloor ot the bud ling, immediately beneath Cohens bed, and though this fact of itselt wns almost sufficient to have demonstrate!
