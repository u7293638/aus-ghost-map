THE JUBILEE OF THE REV. DR. CAIRNS. The Rev Dr Cairns having completed the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a minister of the gospel, a public meeting of his friends was held in the Town hall last evening for the purpose of celebrating the event. The hall was densely crowded in every part, there not being standing room anywhere On the platform there were a great number of gentlemen, including representatives of all onommatioiiH The chair was occupied by Mr. Jas MacBain, ML A The organ had been placed at the disposal of the committee by the mayor, and during the evening Mr P C Plaisted played two voluntaries and also the accompaniments to the psalms and hymns, ses end of which were sung during the intervals between the ad dresses The proceedings having been opened with devotional exercises by the Revs P Bailhache and W L Binks, The Cn AIM. AN (Mr MacBain) addressed the meeting, pointing out the many good works done by Dr Cairns during the many years he had been in the ministry He had always been foremost in every thing that could advance the interest and welfare of the church of which he was a member, but also in every charitable work that was brought under his notice Dr Cairns had served in the ministry for 25 years in Scotland before he came to this colony, and he (the chairman) could speak from his own experience of the good he had done since he had been here, for he had become connected with Dr Cairns s congregation a month after his arrival here, in NSW, and had became attached to that congregation until 1870, when the reverend gentleman had to give up the pastorate of Chalmers Church He had in tended to speak at some length of Dr Cairns doings since he had been in the colony but as he saw there was a great deal of business to be got through that evening, and there were many) speakers to follow him he would not trespass on their time He could not bones or help referring to some of the laborious work done by Dr Cairns since he had been here He was appointed by the Synod to be the convener of the committee on the union with the other branches of the church, and this office entitled much labour and unless until the union was consummated in 1859 He had also been convener of the Scotch College Committee, and had been instrumental in the promotion of the Sabbath Observance Society) He was also convener of the Education Committee, a position which in vols ed great responsibility) and trouble, and nlBC tons each of the theological hall. Committee until 1861, when ill health compelled him to retire from the position and further, he had assisted in originating the Repose lent Asylum the Orphan Asylum which was originally commenced at Kew, and the Refuge and Reformatory) for I illen Women In conclusion he might say that he thought the character of Dr Cairns ss as summed up in the following lines ' I did not ashamed to on II my Lord, stor to defend till) eau.. Maintain the "1 ir) of Ills cross And honour and 118 1 usa The Rev J By Mr riF, on behalf of the ton gregation of Chalmers Church, then presentcd Dr Cairns with a congratulatory address In doing so, he thought he might say a few words, as he was not only Dr Cairns successor in Chalmers Church, but also the son of one of his oldest friends He could assure him that the address he had just read SSUB no idle compliment, but represented the exact feeling of the congregation toss irds him Not only that, but he had only to look around him, and the high esteem in which Dr Cairns was held was plainly shown by the large assemblage then present to do him honour, and which included representatives of all Christian denominations Long before Dr Cairns left Scotland to come to this colony he is as is well-known as an earnest soldier in Christ s arm), and his loss was greatly felt when he left Coupar to come out here In conclusion, he referred to the hub stands in godliness of the congregation of Chalmers Church, which was, in ¡.rtitmeasuie. Juc to the ministrations of Dr Cairns The Rev T li VLLVXTINE said he was there that evening by the appointment of the venerable the press) ter) of Melbourne, who looking forward to this epoch, li id wished to take part with others in presenting to Dr Cairns their warmest most Chris timely, and most brotherly congratulations 'the presbytery had prepared an address, in which they had set forth the esteem in which he was held and their great appreciation of the many good works done by him. They had also desired to present him with some more tangible token of the most Christian character which he had held in the colony, his usefulness in standing up in defence of whatever he considered right, and of the works he had done for the consolidation and advancement of the Presbyterian Church in Victoria, and of his exertions on behalf of the morality and good of the community With this object they had decided upon raising a sum of money to be presented to him, so that he might has set it in the formation of a scholarship at their Theological hall, which they wished to be called the Cairns Jubilee Scholarship On behalf of this work the handsome sum of £1000 had been raised in response to the appeal made by the presbytery He then read the address, and presented to Dr Cairns a cheque for £1000 on a acts or Balser, bearing a suitable inscription, and which he said the presbytery was anxious he should keep as a small memento of the occasion. The Rev Dr MACDOVAm then addressed the meeting, referring to the time when he and Dr Cairns landed in this colony At that time Victoria was a Crown colony, managed by officials, and he assured them that things were very different then to what they were at present Very s son after his arrival here, Dr Cairns had a large congregation around him, and his precept and example were of great advantage to himself (Dr Macdonald) and other young ministers who came out at the same time It was, he said, a matter of great surprise to him that the Free Church of Scotland had induced a man of Dr Cairns abilities to come out here, as even now, with invitations from Large congregations, it was difficult to get ministers of ability to come out, white in the days he was referring to, there was no such thing as a large congregation in the colony Dr Cairns had always laboured hard since he had arrived here, and in his opinion, the Presbyterian Church here ss is greatly indebted to him for the great work he had done by his precept and example as he had never known any one who had worked so hard and sat so long at his desk us Dr Cairns had done A with reference to the union of the different branches of the Presbyterian Church in Victoria there could be no doubt but that the chief credit of that work must be given to Dr Cairns and it was him they had to thank that they were not the ided into several sects, as was the Presby terian Church 111 Scotland They were also greatly indebted to him for the example he had set them of ss working with other denominations in all good works in conclusion, he considered it gently) satisfactory that there should be such a large meeting of all denominations assembled that evening to do honour to their friend and pastor, Dr Cairns The Right lies the Bishop of MEI Boulter, who was received with long continue 1 cheer mg, next addressed the meeting he said that he had that evening listened to a great many eloquent and able speeches, but acted ing to his standard they were not short ones He, however intended to make avers short speech, as in the first place he had a very bad cold, and in the next place he had to hasten assay in order to liberate another of the speakers-the Dean of Mel bourne who was now engaged at the church assembly) When he saw in the newspapers that it was intended to celebrate Dr Cairns jubilee he had at once written, asking permission to be present in order that he might express his appreciation of a noble character He had not had the long knowledge of Dr Cairns that the previous speakers had referred to, but he thought he knew It man when he saw him and as soon as he saw Dr Cairns he knew that he was a good man and a Christian, and he now wished to record his appreciation of the Christian usefulness which existed 111 his esteemed friend Dr Cairns He called him a man because he had those qualities which belong to manliness These í ere decision of character, simplicity of purpose, and fidelity to noble principles He also called him of men because he was always ready to eighteen proper occasions (Laughter) Perhaps he would not go far wrong if he attributed that to natural png nacity, but at the same time he was quite sure he would never give way to that pug nacity except at the call of duty Another quality for which he esteemed Dr Cairns was his large-heartedness, by which he was always ready to recognise any good works, whether in his own church or in any other denomination He was now going to pay him what might seem to be an outrageous compliment It seemed to him that Dr. Cairns impersonated the great qualities of the church he loved vessell They all knew that the Church of Scotland walked with its head a little in the clouds (Laughter) It was what a Scotchman would say sees a leetle metapheesiial, ye ken (Laughter) But 1ltI10u_.l1 it did stalk with its head a little in the clouds it always has its eyes open, and was always ready to fight on the least provocation (Laughter ) It was also large-hearted, and it was because he found those characteristics m Dr Cairns that he thought he so well impersonated the Church of Scotland (Cheers) There was no one who had a greater love for his church than he had for the one of which he was the chief pastor in this colony, and in saying that he also said, " God send us more such men as Adam Cairns ' (Applause ) Having such feelings, it was not to be wondered at that he had desired to be present that evening and because Dr Cairns had been able to exhibit the qualities he had done, he had come there that night to say with all his heart, on behalf of the church which he represented, that he congratulated Dr Cairns on having attained his jubilee (Applause ) Dr CAirns, who appeared considerably moved at the warmth with which he xv is greeted, bind Dear Brethren and Christian 1 neilds I much needy ourTorbeuranceaavv ell as sympathy of this to me most trying time on may well believe that this demonstration

in the compass of this address I shall therefore limit my review to some of the more sinking and fruitful of my expel I ences, omitting much which I have no doubt you would be pleased to hear, but which has more to do with the history of the church in the view of all men than with my personal movements and experience I received licence to preach the Gospel, so far as I recollect, in the month

of Christ, and in my frequent visits from house to house My great difficulty was the "bothe,' the lodging of unmarried men in wretched box els of one department, where they had no comfort, where good

after a residence of nearly five years, transferred to Cupar, the county town of 1 life The scene was new and trying The population of the parish was above 5,000, and although there was a large

century There was no Sunday school, an J no place in my knowledge was more in need of this inestimable institution The very first of my public office acts was to commence a Sunday school for the

imagine the first effect of this adverse providence on my depressed and agitated mind My thoughts were confused my feelings saddened faith was sorely tried, and but for abundant grace I would have sunk into despair But I soon found that though cost down I was not forsaken, that as Christ's sufferings were mine, so my suffer pigs were His, and that consolation richly abounded to me by him I found that " though the outward man perish, )of the inward man is renewed day by day that the furnace fire, though fierce, was set passing that I was dealt with according to any need that I might

afternoon service with the speed of a light mug Hash 1 was struck down, and speedily earned by a few of the elders from the pulpit to the vestry, on the floor of which they gently laid me down UB a dying man I was not dying, but I was smitten with a nervous prostration that made me in invalid for nearly two years A portion of that long recess I spent in Gib altar, in the hope that the climate of

chief anxiety was for my congregation But a kind Providence opened a way, are moved difficulties and assured me, that my successor in Cupar would be the unanimous choice of my people, far better qualified than myself to feed them with the truth, and to build them up in holiness and comfort unto eternal life Since my arrival here my history is known to us) brethren as well as to myself I have
