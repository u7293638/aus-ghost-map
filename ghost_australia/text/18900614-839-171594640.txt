A I'OOn HAVEN 01' IU5FUG15, Bernifle bad no clearly defined plans :bri bring the hotel. She knew no one in London. She know nothing and suspected nothing of the wickeilncsa that lurks on every side in the great metropolis. She had money, nml in her simplicity she imagined thst she would easily find a home in that great wilderness of boiiecs. ' IJUli MUTT IV unit 1,11 vi Ali.ail VVl Ml/1110 OHM did not yet know. She joined tbo tide of shop girls, and walked on toward ltegent Circus in the gray chill of the early niorn in.L'. . She wandered on, hour after hour, bearing her travelling-bag. No one seemed to notice her. Tho few people whom sho met appeared ifcorbed in their own affairs, and bestowed scarcely a passing glnnce upon tho veiled and slender young figure that trudged eo wearily onward. 'It is time that I found lodgings,' thought Uernice, with a horrible sense of bcr loneli ness creeping upon her. 'I must procure' them immediately. It would be terrible to lave the day wear on and the night come and fiuil me shelterless.' But the task was not so easy aa it jtvmoil. There were placards in plenty in Windows signifying that the houses t-j wliich they per tained were to be let. And there wero little wlluiv bills and pieces of white paper in other windows, with the legend, ' Apart ments to Lot,' but the houses were for the moBt pnrt dingy and cheerless, of the cheaper grade oflodgiiig-liouscR, nndBerniocrccoilnd from the frowsy heads at the windows, the broken pants of glass, and the slipshod maids en the stuns. She turnuil from one street into another, growing more tired and less fastidious at tvery step. At noun, nearly exhausted, sho wont into a pastry- cook's shop nnd asked for n cup of tea ami a roll. Tncso were supplied her an'ishe was given a chair, but such demands in that quarter of Kentish Town wero ap parently net numerous, and licinico felt herself to lie an object of considerable curiosity to the shopkeeper and single at tendant. ? Oil paying her small bill at this counter, she inquired if lodgings were to bo obtained in the neighborhood, adding that sbo was a stranger in London and could not give re ferences, ''There are lodgings to bo had in the neighborhood, Miss—plenty on 'em,' replied the shopkeeper ; ' but references arc gener ally required. Some lodging-house keepers maybe willing to take pay in advance in. ?lead. iV young girl like you ought not to be hunting lodging by herself. There's dangers mid perils lurking on every side for a beautiful young creature like you,' iind she looked with compassionate interest nt the iwp, pale, high-bred face.llit up by dark.lsor rowful eyes. '? Why, you arc a real lady, Jim. Vou surely ought to have fiicnda loir.ewhcre.' 'My frieuda are dead,' said Beriiioe, her 'ps quivering. ' My father was a minister oi the Scottish Kirk. 1 am nlono in the «orld, madam, aud am come hum to earn jay own living. I -vnnt to get lodgings while i seek a situation aa governess.' Iho shopkeeper meditated. Sho wa3 an Merly woman, with daughters of her own. one saw that Bernico was' a stranger to Lon J°n waja, that she Boomed like a pupil fresh Tom a convent or plnce uf equal seclusion, »na she trembled ot tho pitfalls that lay be wre one so innocent, so unsuspectiiiK, aud ?'guileless. 'I believe in you, Miss,' thu woman said, ?wnptly, after a long, searching scrutiny of the lovely, half shaded face. 'I'm not a Pe«on easily taken iu.ns people will tell you, but 1 believe in yon, and I'll toll you ot n re-' 'psclnblo lodging-housu where you may get 'room, It's around the corner in Victoria 'wl.

During the three weeks oE her stay in the libufcc, Bernico had not made a single friend. Her follow-lodgeis buuiiiimI scarcely aware of her existence.
