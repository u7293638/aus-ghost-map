THE CYGLORAMA. There is a cotnpUtenese about this unique entertainment which we have olbeu noted, and any novelty introduced is well thought out. On Saturday night the really extraordinary illusion of the Ghost of Napoleon made its last appearance to a'very large attendance of enthusiastic spectators. This illusion has mystified all who have seen it, and it is to be regretted that circumstances will not permit of a longer run. But the policy of the management is to make rapid changes, and this evening there will be introduced a new and very interesting illusion entitled "The Sentry." It is a beautiful illustration of the historical episode in Xaiwieo: 1 . ^ career, where he finds '.he sentry asleep ami qu:et!y takes up 'his rifle, f.t»nd:n(r himself an sentry until the horrified man axvakes, thun (riving him a neverto-b«.f.ir(rotten lesson in nap. Tti« liknnees to the authentic portraits of Napciieon remarkable. The attendances at; Waterloo have been r j very during the past week, and this evening there shuuld be another bumper house. The Knchanted Fountain is, too, one of the attraction* of Adelaide.
