i4v - - * LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE C. OF E. SUNDAY SCHOOL AND Y. M. SOCIETY. The very interesting ceremony of lay- ing the Foundation Stone of St. George's Sunday School, and Young Men's Society's Rooms, was performed on Tuesday afternoon last, in the presence of a large concourse of spectators. At half- past four the procession was formed in Pier Street, near the infant school, and, passing into Hay Street, entered by the north gate of the Cathedral grant, and moved in the following order of procession to the School site by the side gate The Superintendents. The boys with their teachers. The girls with their teachers. The Chairman of the Y. M. Society. The members of the Y. M. Society. The Bishop's Registrar. The Lord Bishop. The Archdeacon and Clergy. The Churchwardens of the Cathedral. On arriving at the site, the Sunday School children sang the 167th hymn, after which prayer was offered, and the 127th psalm read. His Lordship the Bishop of Perth then laid the Foundation Stone, saying: " This Stone is laid in the strength of Him who is the Chief Corner Stone, elect' precious, in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen." Offerings and contributions were placed upon the stone. The Bishop then addressed the assembly, closing with Lord's Prayer and Benediction. A Soiree had been arranged to take place in the evening, in the Hall of the Mechanics' Institute, but it was unavoidably postponed, almost at the last moment, until Wednesday next. Judg- ing by the programme, a most enjoyable entertainment may be confidently predicted.
