' ? 'A wedded; wife ! Of course you will say that, women always do. Yon would find the fact' difficult to prove, I \- fancy.' ?'.'-?': ; . . ' The speaker, was a tall, well-dressed young man, with a blase, languid air, and a handsome but somewhat sinister looking^ face ; ? 'and a ? young woman, scarce past her girlhood, indeed, who woi'e a wedding ring upon her finger, and held a tiny infant in her arms. She was wqndfbusly beautiful with the loveliness which goes deep down into a man's heart at one. blow,' and -makes' it captive for ever. ?? ; :? '-:' i ' '?? -. '?'' ? Her complexion was pure and clear with the rosy tinge of health, and ' '. she had the rare combination of black crip pling \ wavy hair, and soft blue eyes, ?which is often 'a characteristic of Irish beauty. ' .. : : ' ? ? ; ? Nora Keane was Irish, one of those' rare flowers of symmetry and:loveliness which blossom sometimes in the mud-; walled 'cabins by the roadside. ????'': ? -Captain George Tristraile. leading ah idle life in the ibarra'cksi of ?.{ the nearest town, found out his lovely blossom,' and stretched out his lordly hand to pluck \- it.' ??-. ??: ?-.. , But Nora would have nothing to say to''him, and; held aloof, which only made ? his passion stronger, though still he met with no response. Then suddenly Nora disappeared — none knew where she was gone ; . her father either could not or would not give any explanation of her absence, and. Captain Tristraile was obliged to be content in ihis ignorance. ' ? 'All sorts of rumours were speedily afloat ; some said the girl was married, others that she had fled to conceal the consequences of an intrigue with a stranger' who had more than once been seen talking to, and wandering with her over the hills near her home. Others were inclined to believe that she had committed suicide, and that her corpse would one day be found in some of the pools and streams of the neigh bourhood. This last was only the re mark of the ultra-romantic portion of the community; the sharper-sighted ones could see that her absence was not a source of much trouble and perplexity to her father ; his home was more comfortable, little luxuries were seen there which had not been noticed before, and there were not wanting those who openly said that Mickey Keane was living on the fruits of his daughter's shame. He .bore his accusation with equanimity, even when taunted -with the fact by Captain Tristraile, who had ridden over from the barracks to inquire about the pretty Nora. That gentleman was puzzled and angry at losing the lovely girl he had elected to throw the handkerchief to, and indig nant at the fact of being rejected by a peasant's daughter, he vowed in his own mind that if ever he did meet Nora he would be avenged upon her. He met her sooner than he expected, at a time and in a place whero he would least have looked for her. His regiment was transferred to Lon don, and, riding one day down the New: Kent Road, he saw Nora just entering a respectable house, -with an infant in her arms. She was neatly and comfortably clothed,' and had an air of gentility about her, very different from what she had been in Ireland, but he was sure he was not mistaken. It was Nora Keane and no other. ?..;.:., \\-.-, ..?;? Allowing a sufficient;: time to elapse he knocked at the door. - ; A 'civil-look-; ing and tidy woman answered his sum mons; ' Does Miss Nora Keane live here ?'' ' No one of that name hero, sir.' ' But I saw her come in only a minute or two ago ; a young woman in apuple merino dress and a velvet cloak, with. a baby in her arms.'1 . ' That is Mrs Merton, sir.' 'Ah, well, it is the lady I want. I was not aware she was married. Mr Merton here ?' . . '[ Well, no, sir, he don't. often come. I think he's a traveller or something of that sort ; he . brought his good ? lady here not long before the child was born ; and he pays for everything most regu lar.' ? ' . ' I have no doubt ; what is he like'?' Very little could bo gained from the. landlady's description of Mr .Merton, except that he was dark, and ' foreign looking,' but/Mrs Merton was 'Irish; and quite thelady.' ' ?' ? - ' ? The captain's lip curled superciliously as. he heard the' girl he' had known* only as ? a peasant described as a 'lady;'; forgot what wondrous transformations love can make, and love had been at work on' Nora. '?' : '?'*'. ' L am a very old friend of Mrs Merton's' he said, with a disagreeable emphasis on the name. 'I will go up to her, if you please.' : . ' '. ,; ; : The woman marked the sneer in his voice arid took fright. '? ' Do you think it is. all right, sir ?' she. asked; ' mine is a respectable house, and I: shouldn't like to have any thing said;' : ? ' : ? ? 'I am not going to say anything, my good; woman, so'don't'fear for your house's reputation; '; ri only : say that I never heard of the joiing lady's being married, nor any of the rest of her friends 'either, I. fancy?: ? Show me. up to her, if 'you. please.' ' :, : .-. . A most unwelcome visitor he was, as was evident ,from the frightened start the girl gave as;his name was announced. , : She was hushing her baby when he entered, and.her-; pretty fuce turned deathly ;pale- as;-she startedup: ? , '?'.- 'You I You here !?' she gasped. ; The woman r of the ??? house saw this, and she hesrd the impudently familiar greeting of the visitor. ' Well, my pretty one, I have . found you at last !' And she drew her own conclu sions therefrom. 'Out she goes,'' she said to herself. '.' ril have no 6uch going on in my house —/hs pretty one indeed !. How many more on 'em I wonder ?' lib was a stormy interview between Nora and her visitor; he sneeringly refused to believe that she was married, and .renewed his old ; solicitations, which the girl indignantly rejected, but refused to give him any explanation. ' I deny your right to question me,'; she said, irritated beyond- bearing by his words and manner, ' or the right of any man to intrude upon the privacy of a lady. Captain Tristraile, I wish you a good morning.' . ; She threw the door wide open and waited for him to go there, and there was nothing for it but to obey. The landlady was listening on the stairs, and heard Nora's words, and also those of her visitor, who whispered — - ' You may turn me out now, but I'll come again, darling.' ' He slipped a sovereign into the hand of the old landlady, who let him out with a profusion of curtsies, while Nora sat up in her room weeping as though her heart would break. ' We must go from here, acushla,' she said, bending over her baby, ' and find some place where that bad man won't come. Oh, darlin', darlin', when will you be able to stay with your own Nora, that loves you so dearly ?' The lodgings were paid, and she had money, and the next day, saying she was going to join her husband, she left the Kent Road, leaving no trace behind to testify where she was gone. She was not going to her husband, poor girl, he was not in London, and she knew it ; she was only going to seek a fresh home till he could come and tell her what to do. She could not live where she would be subject to Captain Tristraile's perse cutions. She made the cabman drive her to one of the large railway stations, from whence after an interval she departed in another cab to seek a fresh home. She chose the busy City Road, and after some little difficulty obtained a room in a house whose owner asked no questions so long as rent was paid. . It was not a nice place, but there was no choice. People, looked so suspici ously at her and her infant that she was glad to take the first chance that offered of a shelter. From this place she wrote to her hus band to an address he had given her, ; stating what Bhe^ had done, and why, and then set herself to wait as patiently as 'she could till ho could come or' send for her. . ' . ...... But he never came. The letter.never reached him: 'Laid ' upon the m an tie piece of a merchant's office in Mincing \ Lane, it was accidentally knocked into the fire by a careless clerk, who did hot think it worth while to risk a reprimand by speaking bf.it, and who told Mr Merton there were no. letters, when that gentleman called in a few days to see. A week later a young, lady appeared closely veiled, and inquired if they could give, her any' information' about Mr Merton. : ' . ' '. .The head of the firm, who could have told her all she wanted, was out, and the flippant clerk, assuming a know ledge he did not possess, .informed her in 'off-hand fashion that no one there knew Mr Merton's address ;. that letters camo there for him, that was all. Nora tremblingrly: inquired when the last one came. : 'Let me see, a week or so, ago, I think.' \ '.'?..' ' And he received it ?' ? ? ? ' Certainly. I gave it . to him my self.' ' ?? ':) ; ;: \ '; '?? -'? : ' - ; . : ? / The poor girl turned . away sick . at heart,- and went' to her old' lodgings in the Kent Road; , The landlady held the .door. ajar,; and insulted her,, as only' one woman. can insult' and sting another. , . ' . ' Indeed Mr Merton had been there, the very day after she went away, and a pretty scene there was with himj and no wonder, poor fellow, his wife (if. Nora was his wife) going, off like that.' 'And what did you toll him ?' Nora asked.. 'Did you tell him what you knew, that I had gone away to avoid Capt. — - — the mnn who came here ?' 'Avoid him ! Ho,'ho '.'laughed the woman, 'sardonically: r-v '.«. I'll tell you ; what I told the man you' ' call your, hus band, ma'am: — I told him how the gent came here,, and how you pretended to be angry with him, but bolted the next day, and that I'd never- set eyes on either of you since.' She shut the door as she spoke, leav ing Nora trembling on the steps ; it was a minute or two before she could realize the full meaning of what the woman had said. ? Her husband would think she had . gone off with : another man, and that man one who had pur sued her with his importunities long ago in Ireland. Sick and shuddering she turned away fro - the house, hope less and not knowing what to do. . Her money was exhausted, only a few shillings' remaining ;? she had 'not been provident, fearing no want of difficulty in the future. Her marriage was a secret for the present from every one but her : father, and he was far away. It was the last' day of the old year, and want and destitution stared her in the face. She must sell her pretty watch to find the means of life for her self and baby for even a few days, and then supposing her husband did not come, what then ? 'Wearily she turned her steps home ward through the snow that even Lon don smoke and dirt had hardly tainted — past groups of holiday folks throng ing to the theatres, and busy people going home to friends, and glad greet ings by happy hearts after their daily toil was over ; sad contrast to all these was her lot. No loving husband to wel come her, nothing but loneliness and the knowledge that he whom she had so loved had been made to think her un worthy of his faith and truth. Very wearily she climbed the stairs to her upper story room, hardly heeding the landlady's snappish remarks about the trouble her baby had been ; . taking him softly in her tired arms she opened her door, to find there Captain Tristraile. How he had tracked her matters little to our story ; he had done so, and was come to renew the solicitations she had fled from so short a time before. The pursuit of her was an excite ment to the worn-out man of the world ; he enjoyed it as a cat enjoys torturing a defenceless mouse, and he felt sure of victory in the end. ' He had no, true knowledge of women, and much less'did he appreciate such a heart as beat within the breast of Nora Keane, ? ?' ;l, ' . ; ' ? :?' :- ' ?;?'.?:?.'?..? ';?.;;; .'i-- I'--' ? ?'??' -?' '?'-? : Even in the midst of her dire neces sity and terror she refused to Jiston to him. She could not conceal from him that she was in trouble, and he quickly found out why. '.. ' So,' he muttered to himself. ' Forsaken already. The game is mine, then.' But ho reckoned without his host. Nora stood firm; resisting all offers of help or counsel, and baffled at last he rose to go.' '. -, .; '.'?'. ;', .He did this somewhat suddenly, and Nora wondered in the midst of her' thankfulness. She did not see him twitch a letter out of her work-box, the last she had received from her husband. He had re cognised the handwriting or thought he did, and he was not mistaken. He wont into the nearest public house, and calling for something to drink sat down to read the paper he had pur loined.1 The handwriting was peculiar and he was right in believing that he knew it. . . It was that of one whom he had met in Canada two or three years back, and who thougtr'much younger than himself and, a civilian to boot, had managed to expose him in a nefarious card trans action, and leaving a stigma upon his name he had not been able to shake off. .It was a long letter, such as a man who loves sincerely would write to the woman he has chosen from all the world, but only the ending had any interest. for him. ' Only a little longer, my darling, and you shall . take your true name and place in the world, and then you will 'forgive me the.false pride which prompted me to wait until I could present to my brother and his wife a lady. My own Nora need fear no comparison between her and Mrs O'Grady now. Gusty's 'Angel* as he calls her, and she is well worthy of the name, is a dear creature, and will be a sister to my darling when I am far away. I had a note from the Dingle this morning, poor Gusty is in great trouble. Angel is very ill and they fear, the worst. He implores me to go over, at once; of course I shall come to you 'first1 and see you' and my boy, who if anything happens at home will be heir- presumptive to all the family honors. But I trust poor Angel will live, and the expected scion of the house of O'Grady prove a boy. I am content that I and mine shall be younger sons for ever so that God spares my brother any sorrow. I enclose money, dear, ten pounds, I think that will be enough till I see yon. I have got a copy of our marriage certi ficate, and you will remember the church, St. Chad's, Dublin, so that all will go right. I shall see you in a week from this, and shall get a letter within four and-twenty hours if you send to Haddon ' and Co.'s, Mincing Lane, as . usual. Kiss the boy for me, darling, and be lieve me, ' Your own loving, ' H. O'Grady.' ' So it is his heartstrings my fingers have got amongst, is it ?' the captain said to himself when he had read the letter. 'I owe you a long grudge, Horace O'Grady, and by the heaven above me, I'll pay it now ! Your wife, is she ? The poor little fool, and a secret from your proud, respectable brother. She let out that the old cat she had left sus pected her of running off with me. I'll make all the world believe it too before long. I'll go on another tack with you to-morrow, my virtuous married lady, and if I 'don't make Horace O'Grady smart for that unforgotten insult my name's not George Tristraile !' , . B«t the morrow was not to come yet on which he was to meet the wife of the man he hated. Chapter II. 'FIRE!' The mnninc Kre is loose, who was so tamo; ?Whon little children looked iDto his'fuco, He laughed and blinked within his prison grato. His fit v» on, the merry Winking olf Hris rushed into a crimson, hungry fiend. Now he will seize a house, crush in tho roof, And. hop and dance aoovo his proy.' : Aibxandbk Smith. There was a masquerade at the Eagle on that last night of the old year, and lights gleamed, and music sounded, and the hum of grateful voices 'and light laughter floated out upon the still air. The snow lay white and thick upon the dancing platform, but the ball and supper rooms and all the covered promenades were alive with -maskers. All grades were represented there, from the rollick ing shopman and city clerk to the languid west-end swell, who had, just strolled in to see how the ' common people' amused themselves. ' : More akin to the last named race than* to the others, were two young men in plain evening dress, who were lounging arm-in-arm through the gaily dressed' crowd. . They had come there purely out of curiosity. They were neither., of them what is termed fast; and they wore deaf ' to all the solicitations that reached them continually, to stand suppers or bottles of champagne to the gaily dressed; and empty-headed butterflies, that flitted every moment across their path. They ate and drank and lookod on till ' the scene palled upon them, and after the fashion of tho ennuyee pulled out their watches repeatodly. ' Two o'clock,' said the taller of the two, with a yawn. ' We have had almost enough of this, Travers. Let us go.' 'With all my heart. They are getting too noisy for my taste. We shall find cabs in plenty at the gate.' Plenty of cabs, with expectant drivers, waiting to carry off the guests from that noisy festival. They hailed the best looking hansom, but ere they could enter it the red glare of a burning house shot up into the sky, and hoarse voices shouted, 'Fire!' even into their very ears. ' Hullo ! There's a pretty beginning to the New Year for some one,' s»id the - gentleman whem his companion had ad dressed as 'Travers.' 'Drive us to ? the scene of action, Caddy. I rather like being in at a good fire. I hope it's no poor people being burnt out of house and home, this cold night.' Just what it was. One of the high houses which stand back from the street with long narrow gardens before them' — fine mansions once — lodging-houses for the most part, now. It was filled from top to bottom with separate fami lies, whotie shrieks and lamentations -were terrible to hear, as the fire drove them from their houses, and seized on all their worldly goods with destroying rage. The conflagration had reached its height when, the two gentlemen ar rived on the spot, and the excitement was intense, for a horrid rumour ran through the crowd that some one was perishing in the top storey. The escape was there, but all too short, the tallest fireman, standing on the top rung of the ladder, could not reach with his finger-tips the sill of the window, from whence a moment since shrill screams had issued. All was still now, and volumes of smoke poured from the open casement, telling that another minute or two would make escape impossible. But London firemen, God bless them ! — hold nothing impossible, and don't know the meaning of fear. Before the gasping crowd could realise what was being done, a second man, shorter and slighter than the one who stood so still at that dizzy height, scrambled up the escape, and with a coil of rope in his hand, stood just below his fellow hero. . A moment's colloquy between the two, a spring, and he was on his shoulders and had disap peared through the window. Was he gone to death ? The crowd gave a shuddering sigh, the excitement was too great for shouting, and the five seconds that ensued seemed like so many long hoiirs. , In almost as little time as it takes to tell it, he re-appeared, a white inanimate form in his arms and a bundle between his teeth. The man underneath the window held up his hands, the bundle was dropped, gently lowered into the escape to come out at the bottom a living baby, unhurt and yelling with all the power of infantine lungs. But the crowd scarce heeded it, or whether the policeman who held it nursed it head or heels uppermost, so absorbed were they in their breathless watching of what went on above. It was a narrow escape for all three, who depended upon that coil of rope and that dizzy ladder, but it was admir ably managed. ' Steady of eye and hand, and firm of foot, they set themselves to their business with a. will ; tho insen sible form was /steadily lowered by the aid of the rope, and safely deposited in the canvas slide to be guided down by the man who had received it from his fellow. Then the one who had so nobly risked his life, sprang from tho window sill, hung by his hands a moment to make his balance sure, and dropped himself on to the ladder. . : Another moment and he was in safety, and then the pent up feelings of the spectators burst forth in a shout that rang for miles through the stillness of the night. v-Tpfir? , { ... ^:i'3ipR5^ Men wared their hats and hurrahed, and. ?women sobbed and wept as thej young hero ot the noble act emerged', safe and hot on the pavement. One of i his mates took his hand in a hard-grip. : ' I thought it was all up with yon, j Bill,' ho said ; ' God be thanked '!' '? The other returned tho hand shake and they returned again':to their -d u ties. ' There were no more lives to -be isaved, every one was out of tho house, but the ?fire -was ^unsubd ued yet, - and -plenty .of hard -work, was to .be done. ?

I Meantime Horace was shut up in his I room gazing blankly at an attested I certificate of tho death of his wife and ? child, and a letter such as a friend m, might have penned which accompanied !? it. There:. was,- also- a; newspaper ac7 ?.| count of the affair, detailing how she m% had jumped from a third' storey- window I and lay unclaimed at a police station « till recognised by some gentleman who II had provided for her funeral. Her H-, name was given as Mrs Merton and the ?j| incidents of her tragic fate were en ?p larged upon in a penny-a-liner fashion. ? | The letter, was from Tristraile.

' ? | 'And when will that be ?' ; 'In a week, .if Jam ali\re,' he added soitovoce; ' my business in London will be Boon done.' ; ' How- will you cross ?!' ? ? 'Tnthe ?Erin,' she sails to- night ;. I have plenty of time to reach Dublin.' ?. They let him go unquestioned ; as he wished.. Ho' was permitted to see Angoline and! her- three days' old son for a. moment, and-: then he turned his back upon, the Dingles,- with . grim carking care beside h'm as he- rode' a sorrow to face, and a wrong to redress1, such as seldom falls to the lot of' man' to , endure. . ? ,' The same post which brought hirrvrthe tidings of his wife's death,, also took; a letter to Mickey Keane telling him; of his daughter's fate. There wgs no sneering sarcasm -in' this epistle ; it' was written by one of the parish officials at Tristraile's request, .merely isetting forth the' fact of Nora's death in dry' hard terms, and stating; that Captain- Tris ? traile i had identified! the body ? and paid for the interment thereof. A fivje pound note was enclosed with-'tlie inti mation that ttie , captain' begged his ac ceptation; of it for the, sake of his 'daughter,,' for :whom he: hadr great, re gard.' ' ? ' ?:'..? ,-.??' To say that' Mickey Keane was astonished at this letter, is to use a' mild word.^ He couldnotread it' himself and straightway (took it' to his priest, who expounded the contents:to him., He, had- not heard from. Nora for' some1 time1; her sorrow.' had -made her somehwat selfish, and though she had often .thought of going home to her father, : she had not written to him. How she hnd- come in contact with Captain Tris trnile he could not imagine,' her last r letter was fnll: of: loving( assurances of ? ?her' husband'si kindness' andi: her- 6w;h 1 perfect^ happiness, andr now' there was' ?something in the tone of the note, dny 1 as it was, that j'arred! upon him. He seemed to suspect mischief beyond the ' fact of his childfs death',, and spurned the money enclosed with, a contempt which did his untutored- heart1 credit.' After this first burst, of frantic grief had somewhat subsided he put away the .letter and dressed himself in his Sunday suit. He told no one what had hap pened : he knew that Horace O'Grady was, at the Dingles, arid he wished to sec and speak to him before he settled what todo. To get away to London and find out . the truth was his first wish, but lie made up his mind to see his son-in-law first. No thought of betraying the : young, man's secret ever entered his head ; he would only walk over to the suqire's house and ask to see him. According^, in, the evening, long after it ? had grown dark, Gustavus O'Grady was informed, that' a man was. asking for Mr Horace. 'Tell him; Mr Horace is gone to London. By the- way, who is it ?'' ' Says his name is Mickey Keane,, sir— off Mr O'Connor's ; place.' ' Mickey Keane : ! Oh, pretty Nora's , father — whatever can- he want with my brother ?' ' ' He didn't say, sir—he seemed: in trouble.' 'Tell him to step in here ;? I'll speak to him.' Mickey Koane was, shown into the squire's room, whence he came very bashfully, and bidden kindly to sit down, for Gustavus saw in an instant that something more than, common; emo tion was agitating the old man. 1 ' You want niy , brother^' ? ho said. ?' Can I do any thing for, you ?': 'I; think, not,, sir.!'' I' 'Why?' 'It'sa throuble, sir,1 that has come upon me, and I. can't speak, of it., My Horace knows about it, and I wanted his advice,, that's all.' , 'Mr Horace, wont, to, London, sudr deuly: this morning ;'? a letter came which' he had to attend'- to immediately.' ' 'Was.it throuble,, sir?'' . ' ' T fear it was,' Mr O'Grady replied^ wondering not a little, at.tho man's tone ' but my ' brother said nothing, to any of us., He appeared much distressed and harrassed,, but, none/ of us- saw. the letter.' ' ''He knows it then !' Mickey Keane exclaimed:: 'tho news has come to hiin.too.!: My purty child- — my own darlin' Nora ! Och hone,! och hone !' ,, 'Norai! Your-; daughter, do. you mean, Mickey ?. Has anything hap-^ pened: to her ?'' 'She's dead, , sir— dead and gone ! Oh, acushla !, shall I never look upon your sweet face again till I step over the threshold of the next world ? — and not then, maybe, for I never was good enough to stand anigh you in this one !'f This speech died away in a sobbing wail. The tearless, grief of age is very pitiful to see, and Gustavus put his hand on his shoulder in sympathy. , ' I'm sorry to hear this, Mickey — ? very sorry,' he said ; ' take this glass of wine, and try to tell. me about it; When did you get this bad news ?'' Mickey produced the letter, and put it into , the .squire's hand. Nora was , spoken of therein as Mrs Merton, and ho grew more, and more puzzled as he, read! ' This is very, terrible,' he said, when he had finished it ; 'but, Keane, what had my brother to do with it ?' ' He knew about her; sir,' the old man replied, hesitating; 'that is, he A new fear flashed into, Gustavus O'Grady's heart — had his brother be trayed'and ruined this man's only child- ? He remembered his agitation when nsked what troubled him, his brooding silence; and now, last of all, his sudden disappearance. Can it be that he was the partner of Nora's flight ? — a guilty . one, as it seemed. ' Keane,' he said; ' you have known where Nora has been all along ?''?' 'Till within these -few weeks, sir.' ' You know what people said when ?she went away-?' ' Lies, sir — they'll he known for such someday.' 'Well, tell me — -was it with my brother she went ? Did she own her ruin to him ? Don't be afraid^to speak; you were not to blame in the matter; : arid if: all this is true it' is - over now.' ' Over, yes,' said' Keane, rising with a:tbueh of homely, dignity in his mannen. ? '?Squire, I've an oath on my lips that I !can?t break till the priest lifts it from pffme, or I'd speak. May God forgive me .for suspecting an innocent girl that: never harmed you, and letting your heart slander your own brother, that's a true :O'Grady, and' would never wrong. , or' harm living creature. This I can ] swear to you, sir — my girl never had wrong or shame from him-, but he knew about her, and I wanted his advice, ''?'that's1 all.'' ' He sails in the 'Erin' to night for Holy.head. Would it not be better for you to go to London also, Keano, and ascertain the trutlvof this rumour ? If '?monoywourd1 Help you in any way — -' 'Mr Squire, ? thank you, L'vo a tidy bit; she didn't, forget hor old father. ? You could help, me1 with a bit of direc tion, may be. I'll be lost in that- big 'place, and hardly know: how to get there.' Gustavus wrote down some clear in structions , for the old man's guidance and gave him a letter to a friend of his in London, who,, he said, would give him; every information when he got 1 thero. ; ? 'I'd like to see the man who wrote that letter,' he said, 'and give him back his money. There's been mischief /afoot, Mr O'Grady, or my girl would never have left her old father for weeks without a word.' ? Mickey Keniie went his way to Dub lin to take passage in the next steamer, and . four-and-twenty hours afterwards the family at the Dingles read in the ?papers of the foundering of the steam ship ' Erin,' and loss of more than half her crew and passengerc. Foremost on the list of the drowned stood tho name of Horace O'Grady. (To le' continued.)
