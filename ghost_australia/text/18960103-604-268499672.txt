The sacred ties of home affections must never be mine My feeling upon the subject is fev strong as to be unalterable.” . i .

"With its habitual expression of truth and Ingenuousness, and its look of ear nest sympathy for him just touched tvith a trace of archness and sense of nurnor, it might almost have been the .ace of an angel, who had received special permission to learn laughter ind mirth, and all the innocent joys of larth life. “We ought to be brother and sister, hen.” said he.

She used to tell us about him at school." ^ Theri I will be the next best.” “She went out rowing with him one day, and dropped his signet ring—the parting gift of a dear dead friend—into the river.

Then there were Sunday evening visits to Mr Rose’s house for the pur pose of keeping Mr Rose in spirits while Mrs Rose was at church—a duty they performed by strolling in and out among the flowers, oblivious of their host, who slumbered peacefully in his verandah chair.

He wondered why she looked more dignified with her somewhat trying surroundings and occupation than many a. court lady in full dress. ‘‘You truant!:” he said, reproachfully, lou said you were coming out. You promised distinctly.” lt I am coming out,” she answered; “coming out in the character of a pro mising (and performing) kitchen maid I have found my vocation at last.” “But why this interest in, and atten ion to plants of the leguminosae spe cies, if one may as?” “Your education has evidently been neglected, or you would know that vege tables are an essential to every weli •egulated dinner. With vegetables, the 20ld meat is a meal; without them, it s only a ‘snack,’ or ‘a bit of something.’ .t is necessary to -the enjoyment of our 'riend, Mrs Durables, that her evening •epast should be a dinner rather than L snack, as often as possible,” she re died, with an air of grave, preceptorial iignity.

She questioned Frank about the mat-' ter later on, and received the assurance • that the likeness was a speaking one; but just now he was looking at the man as- if he (Frank) would have liked to hit out straight from the shoulder. “Old woman seems comfortable off,” Mr. Dumbles remarked, “That clock cost fifteen and six, if a penny. Them chairs and side table cost money, and you could not get the looking-glass under a pound.” He seemed to lapse into a pecuniary reverie with a view to the realisation of future profit. “Come, Gay,” said Frank. “And what might your name be my young gentleman?”'Mr. Dumbles asked, suddenly rising to his position as host and master of the house. “Wentworth is my name,” Frank an swered. iNot son of Vincent Wentworth, oi the Manning: River?” ther1” Vincent Wentworth was my fa Eh? "Was that so?

Look how you’re frightening the young lady! Looks quite pale, she does, the pretty creetur! You’d better let me go and get her a drop of whiskey.” Frank took Gay’s arm and led her out. Mr. Durables called after them hos pitably, "Look round some night, when you’ve a mind for a pleasant chat, sonny. 1 might be able to give you some news about your people.” 1 • 5' a dep]orable turn of affairs,” said Gay, Wth .a dismayed face, when •vih ^ +W 1 Walking: awa-y together.

"There are several ways of trwirlinn a moustache,” Gay continued. “There is the supercilious twirl, as when a girl’s face and frock does not please the male fellow-creature; there is the conceited twirl he affects when he looks down up on other people from his own high opinion of himself; then there is the thoughtful twirl which comes on of it self, in which you have been indulging for some time. . On the whole, I con sider that it takes.a really clever, sen sible man to .twirl a moustache nicely.” I was only thinking whether this fel low could really tell me anything about my people." ^ .Jf®8 “° one el3e ever told you any thing about them, Frank?

Lately, however, X have resolved to come to a full understanding and knowledge of all the circumstances of that sad mystery.” “I think you are quite right to do so, Frank.” “I have two months’ leave of absence from office, and have determined to visit my mother’s sister who lives in Port Macquarie; also to revisit my native Shall you be away for the whole of the time?” “Very likely. Shall you miss me at all, do you think?” he asked rather tremulously. Miss the best brother in the voidd ? Why, of course, I shall miss you very very much.” He wished that she had been less ready to make the admission, and a little more shy about it.
