Toe "Lou DA-O' AoGiATrow.-The third report of the selet committee of the House of Commons shows that there are now lying on the table of the hon. House 56 petitions, signed by 4,130 persons, against opening the BritihMuseum and the public glleries on the ord's-day. Some ofthepetitioners also object to "music in the public parks," a pro vision for the amusement of the people which. among others, "they regard with the utmost apprehension;" while others believe that if Sunday "be turned into a day of amusement it will soon become a dayof work." Other petitioners. who regard with horror the open ing of the Museum and the galleries on Sun days. and who consider the attendance of re gimental bands in the parks or elsewhere as "calculated to lessen that reverence for the Sabbath which the people of this country, as a nation, have ever entertained," expressly disavow the remotest desire "to curtail or in trench upon the innocent amusements of the people on any other day." A petition from the clergy of Halifax, in Yorkshire, expresses a convietion that the obnoxious measures referred to will be "the means of 'opening' additional temptation under the charaeter of recretion"-a peculiar style of phraseology which the committee think it right to state was sic inorig. This curiously wordeddoc ument is sniedby the Viusr of Halifax, Dr. Musgrave ;hi lecturer, Mr. HepwamthHal;; and by M 0r. .

On their reaching the hotel, the "happy'" pair were at dinner, which they awere gowed to finish without interrunption. When the repast had ?enr well disusd ano dessert sered up, the waiter was requcested by the three pursuers to conduct them to the room and introduce them by merely opening thoe door. The infuriatcd brosther of the lady abruptly entered, and, like Hawlet's ghost, "made her blood run coldz" Sheshrieked sod fainted. No time was lost in parl?ying. A post-chaise being waiting at the door, the lady was speedily placed inside, and hastily driven offby the detectire and her brother, and the gallant Lotharo was left lamenting over his fate to the remaining policeman, who kindUl advised him to take a comfortable nigoht s rest. and then depart byr the first teais inthe mrnmming.

By way of cludi pursuit thtyhad taken tickets through to York, but left the train at Church Fenton, for Hlarrogate. Thepartrinpursuit, therefore, on arriving at the tor'ner place, found themselves at fault, and the keen pereeption of the detective enabled them to return to the latter place and try Hlarro.ate.

Do not. at any rate, let your card be enamelled. The enamel is prpaored from lead, and the proces of anplyi i is stated, on good auth:rity, to proruee paralvsis of the hands and other miserable complints among the poor people engaged in this ridiuenlo? manufacture. A shiny card imparts no lustre to the name upon it, but communicates on appearnce of rulgsr glitter to the table or shelf wrhereon it is deposited. If you rejoice in polish, concentrate that quality on your manoers, conversation, and boots. In case you teel it absolutely necessary to display your taste in your oislting cards, have thoem embossed; and then it will be as well for you also to wear lace collars, and shirt cuffs of the same nmaterial.

Goo UTrtsn.-Keep min oodhumor. It is not great calamitics that embitter existence ; it is the petty scxations. the small jealousies, the little disappointments, the minor miscries,. that make the heart heavy and the temper sour. Don t let them. Anger is a pure waste of vitality. It is always foolish, and always disgraceful, exceptin some rare cases when it is indled by seeing wrong done to another; and even that noble rage seldom mends the matter. Keep in good humour ! ifo man does his best except hc whe is cheer ful A light heart makes nimble hands, and keeps the mind free and alert. No misfor tune is so great as one that sours the temper. until eheerfulness is lost, nothing is lost. K.eep in good humor! The company of a good humored man is a pepetualfeast; he is welcomed se here. yes glisten at his approach, and difeulties vanish in his cheer ing presence. Fanklin's indomitable good humor did as muchfor his eountry in the old Congress, as Adams' fire or afferson's wir dam; he clothed wisdom with smiles, and softened contentious minds into acquiescence. Keep in good humor! A good conscience, a sound stomach, and a clean skin are the cements of good humor. Get them and keep them, and--Be sure to keep in good humour!
