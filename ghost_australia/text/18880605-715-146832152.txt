I am not certain''that" it is a surveyed line, but IJcaowihat it -has been in con atanl.use:ns~apublic road for twenty years, and that entitles it to be continuedas one; but the .best of the farce is that those who ah ut lip thes e road have miles upon miles of roads round, purchased sections, closed up also. Mr, Jamie Ker ought to rub the film from, his eyes, take a snooskan and then have a peep at the closed roads. . . John ^Bright, the peerless orator, asserts that it is aapecies of suicide for colonies to impose vexations tariffs on each other. They .should rather, he says, take each other by the hand and make their sister's ' yoke easy , and her. burden light. They ought to make up .their minds on the sub ject and altogether go in either for free trade qr protection, because it is unseemly i to see sisters all pulling in different directions, and. in place of useless gun boats they ought to get carding mills and looms'; for no belligerent power will molest them while they keep their " Con tingents" at home. He approves of the leasehold system of alienating the public lands and says we ought to have com meucid with it. True ! but although it do s look, somewhat like locking the Stable when the horse is stoleu, " it is Beldom too late to .mend." Superstition fa not yet defunct in the: Benyeo district and. silly people have re cently been alarmed at the nocturnal ap pearance of a spectre at a neighboring station, but why these unreal visitants prefer night to day I never could make out. Some one should address it as M. Moliere did, and say " I say friend ghost belay your jaw, for if on mo you claps a claw, Salvation Tom will soon reveal a tight rope's end as yon shall feel." Mr. W. T. Hoare's new cottage at Apsley is highly creditable to both archi tect and builder and is really a very , beautiful retreat. Mr. 0'Connel's new hotel also improves j the appearance of old Apsley which after all has not moved ahead so fast as it ought to have done, and seems at present in a stand still attitude uncertain apparently whether to move onward or go back— wringing its hands over the departure of Willie Hope. Good-bye poor Willie and may good luck go with you, for you in fused a deal of life into Apsley, and al though you go like Sinbad the sailor with Gordon the poet on your back, you will make friends wherever you go and the old ones will not soon forget you. Selections have recently been going briskly over to the large estates—so briskly that in a year or two there will be few left in Victoria, and nevertheless Duffy, whose first Land Bill did all the mischief, stood blowing in New Ross the other week that he made Victoria what it is—and he did so in one sense—he made the black side of the picture.
