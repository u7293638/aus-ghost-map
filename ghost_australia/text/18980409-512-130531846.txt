Maurice liastcucd to return to the sec tion to enter a complaint against Simon. It is true that before quitting M/uiriee Louin had found a more expeditious waff: this was to collect some Thermopjles to lie 'iu wait for him and kill him in a pitched battle. But Maurice was streu uqnsly; opposed to this plan.. 'You are ruined,' said he, 'if you make lise of these moans. Cru^h Simon, but ''do it legally. That ought to be an ea«y .thing enough to the lawyers.' CoiiBcquentLy, the. next morning, Maur ice laid a formal complaint before tlus section, but whs both astonished and an noyed when the president turned a de#if ear, excusing himself by sviying he could not interfere between two good citizens, ench .Incited b,v the love of country. 'Good!' snid Maurice. 'I kuow now how to act to merit the reputation of a good citizen. To aeBemble the people and to assassiuato a man who displeimi's you: this you call being 'incited by' love of country.' Well, I return to Louis' opinion, which I was wrung to dispute. After to-day, ns you heair, I shall' adopt patriotism, and shftll first experimeuta liiivupon Simon.' 'Citizen Maurico,'-' said the president, 'you are, 'after all, perhaps' more to blniiu- in this affair than Simon. He hns discovered a conspiracy, .which it- was not his iJrovince . to do so. .

'Where? when Citiwu President?'' snid Maurice, carried awa^ by the firm con viction t-f his own4uubccnc'e. 'You have lied.' 'Vonr zeal for your country carries you too far, Citizen Maurice,' said the ' president, 'nnd you will regret what you havo said, .when I.tcfl.jqu I can prove what I eay. to. 3'ou' bo true.

'And why should ' you not believe1 it 1' 'Because it is only the ghost of a conspirator, with whom you always have ? a conspiracy ready to amuse your cne- ' mice.'' - ._ 'Read the denunciations.' ' *'I will rend nothing,''' said Maurice. 'I protest I hove ue.ver seen the che.va liVr— never spoken to him. Let anyone1 who doubts my word of hoiior come-, aud tell inc so. 1 shall know how to answer him.' The president shrugged his shoulders. ' Maurice; who did not wish to be iu ar rears with any one, did the same. An air of gloomy Silence pervaded the remuiu der of the sitting. After tlie meotiug was concluded, the president, a stanch pat riot, raised to the highest rank .-in the district by the votes of his fellowciti icne, approached Maurice, aiiid said: 'Ctome, Maurice, I want to speak to . afcm.' ?? ? , ?

'Yon will not believe iu the conspira tor,, .Maurice,' said the president; 'then, tell inc. do you heiieve'iu the rcdcaruti tious for which Hcloise Tison was yester day guillotined ?' Maurice started. 'Do you believe iu the subterranean passage under the templo garden, coin zuuuiciitiiiK from the cellar of the Cilo .yenue'plumenu ti- a certain bouse in La line de la .Corderic ?'' 'No.' said Maurice. 'Then do as Xlioinas the Apostle did— 'Go aud see.' ' 'I am not on guard nt tlie temple, aud they would not allow me to enter there.' 'Anj1 one mny cuter the temple now.'' 'Hoiv is that 7' 'Read the report, since you are so iu Credjilous. I kuiiII only proceed by offi cial iuloiuiutiou.' 'Well.' said Maurice, reading the re port, 'this 'is 'the point.'. 'Continue.' 'They have transported the queen to the uonciergiMwe!'' i-.ried Maurice. 'Do you think that- fi'om n dream, or what you call an imaginary idea, or an idle story, the Committee of public Sufety would have adopted so grave a mens- ?? ure:?'. ;?...- 'This measure has been adopted, but will never be executed, like many more I have seen, and all—' . , 'Head to the end,' said, the presidpiut: and he 'priw»nl'ed hiin with tlie lns't par ?pe-f. ???? ?- ?: .??-?'-?. - .

'The Cow.inune, as you knqw,' con tinued the president, 'nets with pro . found judgment. .It is . digging a furrow long aud straight Iu its course; its meas ures are not puerile, find It has put in execution the principle of -Cromwell: 'It is uqt necessary to strike the king, except ? upoii the head.' Rend this Kecret note frpni the minister of the police.' Maurice rend: 'Seeing that we possess the certaintv that the ci-devnut Chevalier de Muisou Kongo is iu Paris— that he has been in several places —that ho hns left tracon of his apjiearauc.e iu. various plots, liap pilj frustrated, 1 request' all chiefsof the different sections to redouble their vigi lance—' -. . 'Well ?' paid the president. 'I must believe this,' said Maurice; and he continued: 'Deifription of the Clievalier de Maison Rouge. In height, five feet three inches, fnir Jinir. blue eyes, straight nose. oh-?ist- Hiiit-colorcd beard, dimpled chin, soft voice and lands like a female's.' At this description a strange light burst upon Maurice; he thought of the & ouiig man who commanded the troop of Mn^ndi'iis, and who, on the precedi ig oveuiiig, Puved the lives of himself nnd Louis, and po valinntlj drew his sword upon the 'Mai\jeillu.is iii their defense. 'Moidieu!' ' exclaimed Mnuricp, 'it must be lie;' in that case, the denomina tion would not be false. I spoke to him, but I can not remember taking his hand.' 'Maurice,'1 said the president, 'what do you say to all this now, mou ami ?' 'That I ibelievo it,'1 said Maurice, mus ing sadly, who, for some time pnst. with out understanding what evil influence saddened his life, had noticed everything durkeuimr around Iiim. 'Do not jest thus with popularity,' said the president. 'In these days, Maurice, popularity is life. As ior uni|/i-pulnrity, it is ;to be suspected of treason, and the Citizen. Maurice Lindcy oii^ht not even to bo suspected of being a traitor.' Maurice had nothing to reply to senti ments so much in accordance with his own. He thanked his old friend and quitted the section. 'Ah!' iiuvniured he, 'there 5b too much -suspicion, and skirmishing. Now,'' drawing a deep breath, 'now for peace, ? innocence, aud , joy—now to Genevieve.' And Maurice took the road to the Old flue St. . Jacques. ' . When he reached t'ne abode of the mas ter tauuer, Dixiner and Morahd were sup porting Genevieve: «ln) was suifering ? from a (violent iiltack of lystericR, Tims, i list end of entering inii'cremouiously. us lii wu« nccustoini'd to do, a servant) met him in .the pasbiige. - .

At length, Dixmer liimself appeared. 'Conie in dear Maurice,' said he; 'come iu you (ire not one of those against whom the door is closed.'' - 'What is the mutter ?' inquired the Joung man.
