LAMBTON. Bor.aeOLsE AND WALLSEND CO'OPEsRATIVE So CInTY (LtMITED).-A special'general meeting of shareholders of the above Society was held at the Lambton store, on Saturday evening lst. There was a fair attendance ;Mr. J. G. Baker in the chair. The meeting was called to consider the advisability of reducing the socisety's capital, on account of the Wallsend store being closed. It was carried, by the casting vote of the chelinrrn, that the capital be reduced to Â£2000, butthe vote will go for nothing as the rules of the Society stipulate that any alteration must be carried by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members present. The Ghost,-numbers of people have been on the lousk-out for the Jesmond ghost, but ihe will not make his appearailce only when least ex pected. Some, who have seen it, aver that it takes the shape of a pig; others a goat, and som0e few a piebald dog, and, like all other ghcsts, din. appcars when closely pressed. It is tim?e that this sensation should die out; but it seems to create just as much excitement as ever.
