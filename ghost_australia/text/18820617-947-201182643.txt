We did not receive any information o£ the death of Hanlan, nor did the , Mel bourne ; Arqits, nor , any. : other. . . journal indeed. Let us hope: that -the news, therefore, is on a par with the Russian scare business, and other veracious items published of late in the Melbourne journal named. .Unfortunately, some -.colour is lent to the rumour by the latest ;i'io(ltelli gence of Hanlan, which was to the effect that after his return' to Toronto ha was suffering from rheumatic fever, and con sequently his match with ,! Wallace. Ross, fixed for the ', 2Qth June^;'h'ad to be postponed. ., We publish, 'some interesting particulars of the'^wbrid renowaed and phenomenal sculler, trust ing that they may not prove an obituary notice :— .

In 1875:he also won the Governor-General * Medal, defeating London and Douglas, at Toronto. In 1876 he defeated William! M'Ken for the Champion Belt of Ontario, and was also in a orew that wod a race (three. pairs of soullB).at the. same regatta. .These, were but local .races,, and although he had, started .on his careeras a profes sional sculler, it' was not until 1876, when he won th e prinoipal event at the Centen nial '?? Exhibition ; Regatta at Sohuylkill River, Philadelphia, that he wasbrought into prominent notice. ? Hanlan won .the first prize, ; .defeating the renowned H.

The distance was three miles, with one -turn. At Plymp ton, ; MaBB. , June . 13, - 1877, Hanlan waB defeated by F. .Plaisted : and others, through.his outriggor getting injured.

The race, was rowed.at Lachune ,on the St. Lawrence, and'the time was 36min. 22seo. Hanlan having beaten ' all ! bis antagonists in America, turned his attention aoross the Atlantic, 'and oh May 6, 1879, he met John-'Hawdbn 'i on: the ' Tyne for £200, and the Canadian won ridiculously easy. The three1 ? miles three fur longs i were travelled in the .fast time of 22min. ; 2seb. Elliot, who .was then champion ? of ' England, challenged the wonderful Kanuck f or; the championship, the Sportsman Challenge Cup, and. £200. aside,' over the Tyne champion course. , Hanlan, . however, rowed his man down ^ from start .to finish, and never gave.him a ghost of a show. The Canadian was then pronounced a wonder, and ?.? no _ other English -sculler caring to tackle: him, he returned to America. His first race after, his, return: was at; the Barrie: Regatta, ,;0anada,- when;, he rowed a dead heat with Kiley, but not being ' in condition,, refused to : row off. On. October. 13 the same year he was to. have rowed against Oburtenay for a purse' cof 6000 dpls'., but1 on the morning of the race; Cburtenay's boat was found sawn ? in two; I The referee ordered Hanlan to row over the course, but.' the donors '. refused to pay the 'prize.

No wonder t^enheliBpronounced the greatest sculler the wflrid ever Been.' ..Hanlan in this last race, although under difficulties from the; ronjih'wat'er, Bhp'wed';Bplaridid form,; and iaaaid to have won aa he won all his other; races in England-r-by making a race with; his opponent; , ?: for , a . short; distance, and then having him ' settled. , He defeated Trickett more easily .than' ha ,- did j.'on the . previous occasion. Hanlan is about 5ft. 8f in. in height, and in condition weighs about 10atr 121b. He has a palatial hotel on the island near Toronto, and , is a married man. Ho is stated to possess a gentlemanly, manner, and personally is much liked, ! while! in addition' to his wonderful skill as a sculler, he commands ,' the respect of all who came in.contaot with ...him for honesty. His style of a sculler is thus described by a leading English journal ':— 'Unquestionably . Hanlan!! is: a , great sculler, and master of. a style which he has, made entirely his. own. The science of .motion in wager boat,! pulling was. never, .better exemplified in any sculler than in Hanlan. When he comes forward for his extraordinary, reach he appears to bo a part of the boat. . No souller, of the present, generation had such a length' of stroke from dip to feather ; his. boat is never, pressed, either fore .or. af t ; the weight is evenly on while the occupant has hold of the water with the blades of the sculls, and so perfeot is his . recovery tliat his boat is travelling as fast when he is coming back for the dip as it does when he has hold of,; the ..water. ..,.;.,? THe only thing about liis.scullirig to which ex ception .can be ' taken, and we .. have no wish to be hypercritical, is ; an apparent failure of his body to travel fore. and,, aft in a: ! perfectly . straight line— in .., plain words,. a trifling tendency to screw.' ,. .,
