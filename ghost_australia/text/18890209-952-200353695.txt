They stood silent',. lLstening, Rose mary at least unwilling to be the first: to move.

'I say, Rose, is that Kirko?' called Hugh's voice from tho door. Come in, Kirko?1 ' Not to-night, thanks. Good-night.' Tlio gate swung behind him, as Rose slowly and wearily entered tho house,. to fall at Hugh's foot, without a word .of warning, in a dead faint ! * '' « ' ♦' * ' Well. Mrs Jofl'roys,' said Eliot Kirko, nine months later, setting down a'jj.ass of alo, helping himself to broiul-and- cheese. and glancing from time to time at the cheerful face of hisnow housekeeper, ' how ; has your gnod man progressed while I've I been away ?' j .

' You can go, Mrs Jeffreys, I will ring when I want you.1 The good woman shut the door rather sharply after her, having boon in the humor to furnish her master with a good many details, of which sho was un expectedly relieved. But' her master hardly let tho door close before ho opened it again, snatched his hat. and hurried o\it. He walked a little way, as though' there wore not a moment to lose ; then, as the afl'air presented itself under a new aspect, his steps became more and more undecided ; and finally ho sat down on a stile' instead of getting over it, relaxing into a state ot extreme uncertainty. ' What has come ovor mo ?' ho said to himself, at last. 'I'll go, and chance it !' The Arnolds' house looked so exactly as usual that it was ha'd to realise what liad happened sinco ho saw it last. The front door stood open, but no ono visible, nor did any sound of voices come from within. Ho laid his hand on the knocker, but changed his mind, and walked straight in without stopping to think of the strange ness of the pvocccdipg. He pushed back the dining-room door, to sec Rosemary, seated in her grandmother's oasy-chair asleop.' Kirke approached softly, and stood look ing at hor, noting how white hor face :ind hands looked against the dull black of the crape on her dross, and taking in the hollows under hiir eyes, and the drooping curve of Iit mouth. A minute later she- started into wake dulness, and blushed rod, as she found herself observed. : ''.Oh ! Mr Kirke, I beg your pardon, she said, hastily, rising and giving him her hand. And then as sho looked at him turning paler with a new misgiving, for he was strangely moved. ' . ' ' You are not in any now trouble, I hope,1 she asked. 'Is anything the matter? ; A great deal,' he answered, recovering himself; 'but nothing new. I came to see if I could do anything for you. Have you no ono here— no friends or rel atives?' Eosemary shook her head. ' AVe have scarcoly any relations, and those we have aro in America. I do not want anyone.1 '. ' But what aro you going to do!* JMo, don't be offended, Miss Arnold.
