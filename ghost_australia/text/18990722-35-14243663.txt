THE MYSTERY OF FASHION. BY E. E. D. _ยก_ To those who expect social regeneration, revolt against fashion, merely as fashion, is greatly to be desired. Surely at last the day of good sense is dawning on our civilisation, and in dress, in manners, and in thought the time only shall be called the beautiful, and when found shall not, cr be departed from Well, all things are possible, and this much is for the moment certain flint a leading lady in England sets her face steadfastly against crinoline Meanwhile the wise TV will consider that, that there is no more curious psychological problem than lies behind the pageant of fashion, when we mean by fashion what it has come to mean commonly continual change in social accidents, and enraged acceptance of that change It is not, baron or, the change that is the problem We mortals seek change and ensure it for many reasons profoundly philosophical Nor is it the violence of the changes, for we love keen impressions, and impressions are keen by contrast Moreover, there is the determination of tailors and dressmakers that last season's gear shall not be furbished up and worn tigntn-ihanpres, therefore, must be as fresh. as possible Neither does the problem (consists in the frequent hideousness of the charges, for practical forms of clothing and other decoration are not unlimited,, and fashion moves in oil los There was Germane in the year 2000, and in the year 1799, and in the year 1860, and I do believe there will some day be crmoliMO again The interest and the mystery of fashion lie in this-that there is a genuine aesthetic gratification given to intelligent persons by these changes of whatever sort That Dorinda, who found a real joy in the close clinging of her own Skirts and Amintn's skirts, and cheerfully risked her life by damping these skirts to make them ding the < loser, that she should suddenly find an equally real joy in the abomin- able outspread of crinoline, and delight that hers was the greatest and most unstable circumference on the promenade there is the problem But one cannot doubt the reality of the joy It is not I he commonplace and the imitative, not too blind crowd alone Who testify to it, but the intelligent and the cultivated, and one can no more refuse their testimony than one can refuse the testimony of all those who have met their friends' astral bodies in the highway, or had a vision of one far off at the moment of death If one is to doubt all of which one has had no personal experience, one will not, in the long run, believe much because I have never seen a ghost, has no one over seen a ghost ? I do verily believe in a real satisfaction of the aesthetic sense, of the eye and the imagination of discriminating persons \- f non Is of one's own-by a sudden and arbitrary alteration from what is comfortable and artistically beautiful to something that is inconvenient and artistically ugly readers may object here that this satisfaction is not by any means unanimous that they frequently cry out against some change of fashion, loud lament their deprivation of what they really like, being reconciled to what they distil of only by custom that is quite true for some few people, but true also that if their cry were the voice of a deep-seated principle, a conscientious conviction, they would never be recon oiled Could we ever reconcile the Shakespearian with the Bacon Shiikospeannn-tho Orangeman with the Parnellite 'J If a woman sincerely believed that green one buttoned gloves were true to the canons of Be mty-the eternal canons of Beauty-would she ever be content with fawn coloured gauntlets The fact that she is so destroys one's rospectfor the aesthetic sense One's faith in evolution, moreover, is hereby shaken to its foundation fashion is arbitrary, recurrent, in progressive to use a popular word, there is no " inevitableness in it Wide sleeves do not follow from France, nor a flat head-dress from a high, as Gothic architecture followed from Norman, us the failure of the Stuarts from the tyranny of the 1 actors, as the modern horse's hoof from the five toed foot of his ancestors These are arguable, reasonable, under standable that is unscientific, " up in the nu " Individual taste might prefer the round arch to the pointed but it could see how the pointed came about, and although members of the Order of the White Rose still keep holy the day of the execution of King Charles, those who have the historic sense seem to agree that the sacrifice was necessary in the cause of popular freedom, and that if Cromwell had not arisen to cut off his head some one else would have done so Given the six wives of Henry VIII . there are those who could have foretold the long sermons of the Independents, but who could pro- phecy a decade of skin-tight pantaloons from a decade of short breeches stuffed out to a great size with rage and feathers and all sorts of light rubbish J fashions in dress are like nothing else It used to be thought that the winds were rather knew plic ible, but meteorology can tell us something about them, whence they come, and whither they go and it is the fashions that have a charter of fools-to blow on whom they like They per meat through a civilisation as a thought wave, kindling the most diverse souls with one flame and one soul with the most diverse flames All now is ishionB suit the average female soul is all the now clothes of all Tlr hnuecrs's pupils suited Mister Frankford The planet Neptune was discovered at about the same time by Cadorna, Levernor, and Galle, distant (different men but it is conceivable that Donna in Cheltenham, riots in the Isle of Skye, find made at Cape town, having no means of interchanging ideas and all happy in green kid gloves, one-buttoned, would at the same month at, independently, this cover the fawn coloured gauntlet and demand it of the linen draper aye, and would wear nothing else Aye, and would shortly come to shuddering point at the recollection of the once- approved green kid It is inconceivable but at the Sug- gestion of a fashion plate, or br example of a visitor from town, each of them will do this of bona fide most sincerely burning that which she has adored, and worshipping that which she would have burned Certainly fashions are like nothing else Those who believe that the movement of humanity is ever onwards will declare that this pendulum swing which began speaking of England about two centuries ago, and has be come continually more rapid and more wide ever since is a sign of many good things, of keener intelligence swift trow th of ideas loss of class distinction and easier national and international communication If EO, then with our social advance gathering impetus as no go there will be a constantly qui ker shuttle of fashions till there is a stage when every new play brings its changes Till at the millennium itself there may be such a velocity of changes that all changes shall be one, as the stillness of a sleeping top It does not seem though that our millennium is to be for all the world has healthy change is characteristic only of Western civilisation The East never moves its customs are not "Motionless pertnps-strange thought unconscious of our as one is able and looks past us, as the tiger 1 fol s when we stand before his cage His green gl ire goes through as over us, beside OUR Does he need us not at all Does he think as not worth heeding p Why does the log fire in his master's moods and the cat gaze i ist us into unknown pi ices P Why does the West dance like a weaver s shuttle, and the last he still like the Spl mx ? Because past is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet But there is no such thing as East Bombay is no nearer to-the sunrise than Greenwich The problem of fashion must be oxiluucd-if at all -by some more fundamental difference Now, being British, I know of none so fundamental as that between black and white Whatever your subtlety you cannot prove that black is white, or white black and if you want a matter to be perfectly clear why you have it in black and white Let us try, to fit our question to the Procrustean bed of black and white We shall find that it solves itself with an ease that is laugh able for Fast IS black and West is white The black man changes not, the white man does Is it because they are set erally black and white ? Undoubtedly Pluck is the negation of light, and white is its fullest exhibition Black stands for death, for absence of motion and white for life, which is ceaseless change Black receives nothing acknowledges nothing, expresses inching white represents the play of all the gay motes that people the sunbeam The case is here, and the conclusion is very creditable to us as a white race
