: The Curate and His: Cure. Mr. Drake, B.A., was a curate of the deepest dye. He had not so much principle a 'a;lj?1afknt tand ! h cameto Cobklebourne with the express purpose of marrying the richest and least objectionable of his con gregation The difficulties before him were few. In personal appearance he was .so'siniple and'sweet that even his rector,-the Rev. D. Trump, thought him a fool; what more could a girl of five-and-forty desire? 'It was;;:not ,a question which of the spinsters of Cocklebourne he should marry, ,:but wIhichi:odf:the tempting .creatures ;he: should reject. They followed him whither soever'ii'heweat in sixes and sevens. They made him sufficient slippers to stock a ware house; and they wrote letters to him, marked "private," containing the burning thoughts they !dared n6ot utter in, the pre. f. is ence. of ; their, ;dear,.friends. i Each letter was tintamount.to an offerof marriage; but their claims were soequal that he could not decide, ,and ,hereplied to all. letters withi touc?iig but ambiguous texts. He hoight' ifW- let t fwait awhile. SIt was in-September that there appeared Sin 'Gooklebourie a stranger---a man with a 7-ý--black- eard*and-a-'di~ ilmayi care ;eye--and She tookithe- slitary hut upon the cliff, which long ago had'belonged to a smuggler. He snubbed the inquisitive'.tradesmen of whom he bought his. eatables and. drinkables. He .orderted lacon by tlie 'side', beer by the 'barrel, and whisly iby the 'largest' of atone bottles. .He livyed' quite alone. No one , .knew .anythingi , albou :;him, ;except that he laughed aloud wlien he passed 'Mr. Drake, B.A., witti two spinsters on his right aid S'three'on his left.; The.ladies declared, ;ne and all, that he-was a bold, had mian, and they dared not go near the; house upon the cliffi i But sinners'being so 6fei, they could Snoftbut feel intersted ii this man with the black beard and dark eyes, and when one Sunday he did hot appear at church, they ;waited upobn the rectorr'and begged him to i'bring the sinner to repientance; . The' ev Dr. Trump ihating sinners and walkingin equal degrees, said 'he would Ssend his curate to persuade" the strange. A; '. t this time, r.Drake, B.'A, .was suffer. ,,ing somewhat from excessive b~ile, for his most active exercie was ,wbool-wiinding, and *, the ladies bittered his tbast ,,6?i b'th sides S.and the e~dges. He had not enjoyeid half an i hour'si: freedom .since, .he first .arrived at' SiCockleboirnie. His bowvels yearned towards , .a quiet .pipe, beer ;.from .the, barrel, and whisky from the stone bottle. It was there fore with joy that could scarcely be masked. Sthat he Ireceived his orders to visit the sinner on the cliff. That last evening he was ever :'to spend in his lodgings 'atiCocklebourne he passed; in preparation; for,the morrow. He looked up tlhe old pipe he had brought with hiim' but? never smoked, the pouch of; dry birds' eye, pipelights, and a French novel. These he stuffed into the pockets of his. alpaca coat, and covered up decently Swith soothing tracts., 'Ini: the morning he rose gaily, and when he.had parted with his flock at ,the foot of the hill-beyond which point their fears would':riot permit them to v: enturedhe ascended the steep path like a; cherub climbing a cloud.,' ! ' A walk of two miles 'was before him, but he did not hurry himself when the weather.. cock on his church steeple was out of sight.
