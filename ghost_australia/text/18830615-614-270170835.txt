IMsMtcc. Tho incident is from llio Lovo stories of Partlio nlns, wlin jiruservail fragments of n lost epic on tho expedition of Acliilles ngninst Lesbos, nil islnnd nlliod with Troy. 'I'm; daughlorof tho Le.siiiitn king Within her bowor slie watched tho war, bar off she licnrd tho arrows ring, Tho smitten harness ring afar; And, lighting from tho foremost car, Saw ono that smote wlioro all must floo; Moro fair than tho Immortals nru Jio Boomed to fair l’isidico! She saw, she loved him, and her heart Before Achillos, Pelons’ son, Throw all its guarded gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won 1 And, ero that day of fight wan dono, No moro of land or faith reeked sho, But joyed in lmr now lifo begun,— Her life of love, PisidicC; Sho took n gift into her hand, As ono that had a boon to eravo j Sho slolo across tho ruined land Where lay tho dead without a grave, And to Achilles’ hand sho gave Her gift, tho secret postern's koy. “ To-morrow let mo bo thy slave!" Moaned to her lovo Pisidicd. Ero dawn tho Argives’ clarion call Bang'down Mothymna’s burning street; They slow the slocping warriors all, They drove tho womon to tho fleet, Save ono, that to Achilles' feet Clung, but, in sudden wrath, cried ho : “ For her no doom but death is meet.” And there men stoned Pisidicd. In havens of that haunted coast, Amid tho myrtles of tho shore, Tho moon sees many a maiden ghost— Love’s outcast now and evormorc. The silence hears the shades deploro Their hour of dear-bought lovo; but time Tho waves lull, ’neath thine olives hoar, To dreamless rest, Pisidicd 1 —Andrew Laity in the Century,
