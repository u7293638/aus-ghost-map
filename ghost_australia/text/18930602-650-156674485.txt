Challenge and sudden spar, .??',. And then some stars he'll see ; Oh, there will be some moaning in the bar When he encounters me 1 Home brew and then a plunge, A bleeding mouth and nose ; Oh, I will make a quick and fearful lunge, And then rush up and close I 'Upset and sudden jar, And one clear fall to me ; Fresh air, and then a moaning in the bar, Will I strike out to see. [Tennyson's ghost warned off.]
