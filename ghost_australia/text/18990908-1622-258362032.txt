FIRE A N D SNAKES. Ah incident of the recent forest fires in the Pine creek region is relnted by Sam Campbell, who works iii the woods near Blackwell's. San was one of the crew of men sent out to " back' fire " (fight fire with fire), and he declares that tlitir experience was most thrilling. While -siting (ire to a thicket that crowned a rocky rhjsrt. he and his crew were .startled to find t:b~nselves suddenly in the midst of a lot of «••-.!: c'tesiiakes. The forest fire was advancing up ; hide of the hill at a rapid rate. Its whistl- ><•.:,. whining snuml as it devoured the hemlock wns terriiie, and the men were bent on building a line of fire to start toward it, hoping lilac when the two lines met the fury of the •_'.nrs would be subdued tor lack of material on '.'•h to feed. It was while thus employed that l^y eneountered the snakes. The ground si-emed to be liters.!! v live with raoilers, the reptiles crawling in tin: direction of a rocky hhifi: not more than one hundred yards dislant. Tin.! men were ail equipped with high-lopped l:-at!;er boots and paid litilu heed to the snnkts, stepping on them as though they were but hnrinless old sticks. Campbell says that thn rattling made by the reptiles could be heard it hove the roar of the distant flumes. The " b.'.cklire " mad-i by the men caught dozens r.f err. wit rs and thef were burned to tleal.li. Campbell said he watched several of the rattlers " f.ive up the ghost." When the flame:? advanced no c!o.--e that, the snakes saw further t s- cape WHS impossible they would coil up in a htap. darting their heads angrily at tho to. gut s of lliiine. then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them, a moment later to be devoured.
