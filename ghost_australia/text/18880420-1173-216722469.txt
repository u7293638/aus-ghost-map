Ballad of Christmas Ghosts. Between the moonlight and the fire, In winter evenings long ago, What ghosts I raised at your desire To make your leaping blood run slow! How old, how grave, how wise we grow 1 What Christian ghost oan make us chill* Save these that troop in mournful row, The ghosts we all oan raise at will? The beastB can talk in barn and byre On Christmas eve, old legends know, As one by one the years retire, We men fall silent then, I trow, Such sights has memory to show, Such voices from the distant thrill, Ah, me! they come with Christmas snow, The ghosts we all oan raise at will. Oh! children of the village choir I Your carols on the midnight throw I Oh, bright across the mist and mire, u , Ye ruddy hearths of ChristmaB glow 1 Beat back the shades, beat down the woe, Benew the strength of moral will; Be welcome all to oome or go, The ghosts we all can raise at will. Friend, sursum corda, soon or slow We part like guests who've joyed thai fill; Forget them not, nor mourn them so, The ghosts we all oan raise at will!
