VARIETIES. [?].—Etna, unlike other mountains, stands alone, rising straight from the plain, with no rivals to dispute her height, or intercept any portion of the glorius view below. The whole of Sicily is stretched out at yow feet, the hiUa below looking like the raised part of a map for the blind. Not only is the panorama anequaDed in magnificence, bat there are atmospherical phenomena in it which belong to Etna aloin* As the son rises over the Calabrian coast, a perfect and distinct image of the cone is re flected—aa on the sheet of a magic-lantern—on the horizon below, gsadually innfing lower and lower as the son becomes brighter, and finally disappearing altogether. As it was early in the season, the mow extended over the whole of the so-called desert region, while the mod below seemed to encircle the mountain a* with a green belt, which added to the beautiful effect of the whole. Tired and exhausted, and yet delighted, our traveller descended the cone, and rejoined been compelled to content themselves with seeing the sun rise from a green hillock just below the house. They determined on their way home to diverge a little fiom the straight route, in order to visit the Valdel Bove, that weird and ghost-like chasm which had struck them so much when looking down upon it from the height of the cone.

It is of vast size, enclosed by precinices 3,000 feet in height, and filled with eJCT""" rooks, of wonderfully strange and fantastic shapes, standing oat sepa rately, like beasts—hence its name. The perfect silence of the spot reminds one of some Egyptian city the dead. Smoke, explosion, dripping ice, or rushing torrents, characterise the other extinct crater* in this wonderful moun tain ; bnt in this one all is still aad silent as the grave. It is stern as the Curse of y«*M?i?. and as if the lava had been cast up in these wonder ful shapes in some extraordinary convulsion of j nature, and then had been petrified as it rose.— ! Lois Herbert of Lea in " Tie Monti." The Tale of a Do -.~Le Petit Journal of Paris, which contains from time to time some very strange stories indeed, has the following anecdote of a dog, which may be pronounced j interesting if true:—" Lately a traveller passed in a carriage along the Avenue de Nenilly; the night was dark. All at once the horse stopped, and the traveller saw that the animal had met an obstacle. At the same moment a man raised himself from before the hone, and uttered a cry. * Why don't you take owe?' said the tfwdkr 'Ah,'cried the man, 'you would do batter, matead of '■-'Vtrinf. to lead M mr lantern.'

"Give it to me.' The man hesi tated. 'Give it to me: it i? a ttwaas of re covering the others.' The poor derfl gave him his last coin. The traveller whistled ; a anagni fieent Danish dog began to leap arotmd him. 'Here,' said the traveller, putting the coin t? the nose of the dog—«Look.r The intelligent creature miffed a moment at the money, and then began to ran about the road.

And bow is " a good juvenile to combine walking gentlemen 7" Is be to came behind them slily, and pin their first tiili together? If so, we abonld be apt to "*" him a bad boy, rather than a good juvenile. Then, how odd it aeems to stipulate fora "goodpri vate appearance" in an actor, and say nothing whatever about his public appearance, which certainly must be the more important. Aa to what on earth is meant by " sending scrips for Easter week's baa," our wits have been co mnch congealed by the cold winter, that we own wo •re completely at a lorn to give agues*.
