To the Editor of The Record. V:- Sin,-In reading the report of Mr. !'Nimmo'« meeting in your valuable ! paper. I was greatly iurprised to find ,'thiat Wm. Ferguaon, after proposing -" th« candidate a fit and proper person to represent the district, urged the " desirability of forming a strong com inittee to secure his return. Now, as Mr. Ferguson had assured rue that he did not intend to take any part in this election, simply because he had not the slightest confidence in either of the candidates, you may suppose that I and many others were taken aback when we discorered that our worthy friend had so soon changed his mind. Upon enquiry, however, I was pleased to ^hear that the Wm. Ferguson who so prominently figured upon the plat form on that occasion was not our wor thy friend, but only his ghost, so to speak, or in other words, a young fel low who happens to be in the employ of Mr. Ferguson, and, strange to say, bears the same name as himself. Not a bad move of John Niramo's after all, and I venture to say that this young fellow, in all his youthful simplicity, little thought that he was only being used ae a cat's-paw, and that in being pushed to the front -: much as his vanity might have been flattered in the act-it was merely an electioneer ing dodge to make him appear the thing he is not-a substance-when in reality only a shadow. As a lover of justice and fair play, I would thank you to insert this in your next isiue. I am. Sir, very truly yours, AN ELECTOR.
