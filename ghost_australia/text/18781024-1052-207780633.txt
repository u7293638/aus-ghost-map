MACBETH. . Mr, Thomas Kenny, a clever essay ist, and who has written most ably on the subject of " Alacbeth," character ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime and terror relieved by the most mag- niiiccni. jmagiiuiLivL LA|'jicobiuii yci marked with great simplicity of general design. The date of the production of the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6, and "we may take it for granted," says Kenny, " that it was written in the time of James the First, whp ascended the throne March, 1603,. as it contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iv. scene i, and also a' complimentary reference to him in an- ' other part, Tiie material for the play was found by Shakespeare in l-lolin- shed's Plistory of Scotland, where the story of Macbeth is told. at page 168." The A'lacbeth and Duncan are repre sented to have been cousins ; the first a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo sition, and the latter "so soft and gentle in his nature that the'" 'people wished the inclination and mariners of . the two to have been so tempered and intGrchaiigtably! shared betwixt them that wliei'c the one had too much of clemency arid the other of cruelty, the main virtue between these two extre mities might have reigned by indiffer ent partition in them both. The play I all along keCps close to the line of Holinslied;, Varying from it in scarcely 1 any particular except in the non appearance in the banquet scene of the murdered Banquo's ghost," i This tragedy has been presented in Melbouroe we believe oftener than any other of Shakespeare's works. The ( late G..- V, Brooke, Charles Kean, Charles Vincent, in their time e.ssayed ' the part, and we have had other repre- ) sentatiycsj ; from ; . the 1 b.urly AIcKean Buchanan and James Anderson to the ' little dapper J.
