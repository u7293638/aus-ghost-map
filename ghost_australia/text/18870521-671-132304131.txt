Working Men's Rowing Club Concert. The above named peculiarly Balmain Association gave a concert in aid of their funds, at Halfnight's Hall, on Wednesday, which was largely attended in spito of tho very inclement weather. A full programme was presented under the management of the_ Brailoy Bros., which went off with entire smoothness and liveliness to the great satisfaction of the audience, who were liberal with their applause, and appreciated tho performance highly.

Tur ner ' Good bye till I see you again,' Mr. W. T. Knight his favorite ' The Clang of tho Hammer,' and Mr. W. Eland sang ' Come buy my flowers,' and ' Skied tho Coppor,' satisfactorily. Messrs.
