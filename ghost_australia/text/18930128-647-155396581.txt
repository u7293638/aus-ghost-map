Strings to Our Harps. Anna Shipton. Many a waiting hour was needful to enrich the harp of David, and many a waiting hour in the wilderness will gather for us a ' psalm of thanksgiving,. and the voice of melody,' to cheer the hearts of fainting ones here below, and to make glad our Father's house on high. What was the preparation of the son of Jesse for the songs like unto which none have ever sounded on this earth 1 The outrage of the wicked, which brought forth cries for God's help. Then the faint hope in God's goodness blossomed into a song of re joicing for His mighty deliverance and manifold mercies. Every sorrow was another string to his harp ; every deliverance another theme- for praise. One thrill of anguish spared, one bless ing unmarked or unprized, one difficulty or danger evaded, how great would have been our loss in that thrilling Psalmody in which God's people today find the expression of their grief or praise ! To wait for God and to suffer His will is to kntfw Him in the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. So now, if the vessel is to be enlarged for spiritual understanding, be not affrighted at the wider sphere of suffering that -awaits you. The divine capacity of sympathy ?will have a more extented sphere ; for the breathing of the Holy Ghost in the new creation never made a stoic, but left the heart's, affection tender and true.
