"MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR" AT HER MAJESTY'S. This hale old English comedy was revived at Her Majesty's last night with almost the same cast as that of a year ago, when Mr William Rignold first made himself known to the playgoing public of this part of the world in the congenial character of the fat knight Those who watched with pleasure that evenandartisticperformancovveronotslow to recognise the good taste with which the play was presented, and the capacity with which it was acted Mr Rignold's Sir Johnralstaft easily took its place as one of the successes of the local stage, and its revival has been looked forward to with a sense of pleasurable anticipation The public was not dis- appointed last night The " Merry Wives " was staged with the same completeness, and played with the same Oicollont effect as on its first presentation, and the patrons of the theatre were thus enabled to enjoy return once more to sterling English drama, played in their own familiar tongue The story runs that Shakespeare wrote his " Merry Wives of Windsor " at the special desire of Queen Elizabeth, who was so much pleased with Ralston as he appeared in the first and second parts of Henry IV that she commanded the dramatist to continue his adventures in another play, which should treat of the knight in love. At all events, that is Rowe's version of its origin, while other authorities mention that the whole piece was begun and finished inside of a fortnight, such was the royal eagerness to see it performed Dennis, who is said to have had exceptional opportunities of coming at correct information on Shakespearean subjects, wrote an adaptation of the " Merry Wives" under the title of "The Comical Gallant," and in his dedication of that effort he explains that " this epistle was often at her (Queen Elizabeth's) command, and by her direction and she was so eager to see it acted that she commanded it to be finished in fourteen days, and was at tornaros, as tradition tells us, very well pleased at the representation This Dennis is, of course, the chief victim of Pope's "Dunciad," and these words were written about 1702 the Shakespearean scholar as well as the student of dramatic literature, I however, is more interested in the circumstance that there is a much earlier draft of the present version of the " Men by Wives," st Inch, as Warton says, is curious as containing " Shakespeare's first conceptions in forming a drama which is the most complete specimen of his council potters "As to the order in which the play should be road the authorities are divided, though surely with very insufficient reason Dr Johnson maintained that the Fal- staff of the Merry Wives of Windsor should come after the knight s rebuff by the erstwhile Prince Hal and before the death scene, instinctive babbled of' green holds " in Henry V But "Malone s contention that it comes between the first and second parts of Henry IV his incontrovertible evidence to support it, for Mr Page has doubts about 1 onion is a suitor for "sweet Anne Page" because he keeps company with the tt dd Prince, and with Tons As for the very enjoyable performance of last night, when it is mentioned that the initial bunce s was repeated little remains to be Bald As on the occasion of its first representation the Betting had much to do with the artistic presentment of this thoroughly old English comedy Master Page's house in the first act, with its red brick wall of the garden close, festooned with creepers and brightened with trellised roses, with the broad stretch of open country and breezy downs in the distance were delightfully colourful and characteristic The bit of forest was a Shakespearean wood- land, and the scene round Herne's Oak m Windsor Park, with its iairioH black, grey green, and white v You moonshine revelling una shade of night, was just such a score heroin over and farmers might disport themselves in fine old English fashion before Pack and Oberon and Robin Goodfellow left the land.
