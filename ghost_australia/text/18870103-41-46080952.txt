SPORTING; A THE VICTORIAN RACiNG CLUB'S ? ~ - 'MEETING.' .::?.- :. IBv TeleeraDh.1 PFrom onr own JseTiorter.l Melbourne, January 2. . The races at Flemington on Saturday were very successful. The weather waa tine and the attendance good. From first to last the favourites were most forfcnnate. and the Einc declare it was one of the most disastrous days they haveever known. A fine field of twenty one saddled up for the Standish Plate, and Hogmanay was made favourite when the betting opened, but the public were so persistent in their fancy for William Tell that at last the top weight passed Morrison's horse in the betting. Kohai, Harvester, and Straight Shot were the only others backed for money. Ihe race wag soon re duced to small proportions, and after Hogmanay and Harvester had threatened danger for half a mile William Tell drew right away and won very easily by nearly two lengths. The Normanby Stakes proved a very easy thing for Hortense, although Perhaps ran so fast for half a mile that Campbell had to shake the big mare up to catch her aa they came into the course proper. Escutcheon ran a good colt, but flortense beat him handsomely at the finish. Eight saddled up for the Hurdle Race, but this waa voted a moral for the handsome Ballarafc horse Blue Mountain,£and directly the betting opened he was made a very hot favourite. Ihe race was run at a slow pace, and Scobie allowed the favourite to change his position continually, but when the pressure waa put on half a mile from home he came to the fore, and smothering Mb op ponent in the straight won in a common canter. The race of the afternoon came next in the shape of the Bagot Handicap, and a splendid field of twenty- one sported silk. It was generally understood that the carefully kept All Gold was a good thing for this, but Silver Mine's performances were more attrac tive, and until just before the fall of the flag there was nothing to choose between the pair in the betting. Lord Wiltcn was most in demand of the others, but at least ten horses were well backed. It waa a magnificent race, nearly a dozen horses entering the straight almost abreast, and it was not until the distance was passed that All Gold, Duration, and Recall had the struggle to themselves. Duration was the first to crack, and All Gold, stalling off Power's rush on Recall, won cleverly by half a length. The victory of All Gold was very disastrous to the Ring, as he was taken in all the doubles with William Tell, besides being very heavily supported straight out. Commotion got jammed between two horses after they had gone 6 furlongs, and put Ma shoulder out. The Steeplechase was a chapter of accidents, and after bring ing down several others Lady Ashton fell at the wall, and Lizette was enabled to win aa she liked. None of the jockeys were hurt. When it waa seen that Escutcheon was to be started for the Criterion Stakes odds were laid on his winning, and the certainty came off, although Epicurean, who might have been second, was not beaten until they had gone 5 furlongs. The following are the results : — STANDISH HANDICAP. A sweepstakes of 5 sove. each, 1 ft., with SCO added. Second horBe to receive 100 sovs. out of the stakes. For three-year-olds and upwards.

The lot left the post in good order, and ran for some distance without anything showing distinctly from the Stand. Coming to the tan Straight Shot, William Tell, and Hog manay, on the rails, with Sedition and Har vester in the centre, looked most prominent, and already a number of competitors were beaten. At the half- mile post Sedition was going very well, but as they entered the course proper, Straight Shot, William Tell, and Hogmanay, on the rails, and Harvester, in the centre, were in front, with The Ghost, Louise Berta, Kohai, and Sedition next. Coming on the Btruggle was reduced to William Tell, Hogmanay, and Harvester, the three running very level to the distance, where William Teu shot away and won with something in hand by a length and a half from Hogmanay. Kohai came very fast at the finish, and just beat Harvester tor third place, with Coronet fifth and St. Louis Bixth, the rest straggling in, with Maroondah last. Time, 1 min. laf sec.

After a little delay the word waa given to a good start. Boolka, Recall, Camerine, and All Gold on the rails, with Lord Wilton, BritiBher, and The Nun in the centre were the first to move, and passing the Stand Camerine was leading All Gold, with Lord Wilton, Britisher, Harveater, and The Nun next, The Levite and Silver Mine, who got off badly, running past the rearmost horses on the outside. As they made the tarn. Harvester joined Camerine, the pair going on from All Gold, with Recall, Duration, and Lord Wilton moat promiuent of the others, bat the lot were well packed. Harveater took command as they ran along the river, Camerine being at hia heels, with Lord Wilton, All Gold, Britisher, The Nun, and Recall following in close order, and pasaing the lj-milepoat there was little change, except that All Gold had taken second place, and Duration's due jacket wa3 Bhowing among the leaders, Jarveater was well clear of hia field at the bridge, but The Levite now made a faat run on the ontside and joined the Emulation colt, while All Gold, Recall. Lord Wilton, and Duration were almost abreast at the head of the main body of the field. Pasaing the abat toirB The Levite ahot away with a clear lead of larvester, while Britisher, All Gold, and Lord W ilton came next, and following them were Camerine, Silver Mine, and Recall, but nearly all the runnera were bunched and going well. The Levite led them two lengths passing the sheds, and he kept his advantage along the bend, where Meteor joined Lord Wilton, Britisher, and All Gold at the head of a well- packed lot. There was a general closing-up as they reached the turn. The Levite pulled out wide aa thev entered the Btiaight, and here Duration on the inside, All Gold, Britisher, Meteor, and Camerine were very conspicuous, and the colours of Lord Wilton, Silver Mine, and Recall were also seen among the leaders. Directly they were in a line for home Duration and Gold settled downin front froaa Meteor, with Lord Wilton, Britisher, and Claptrap close up, while Silver Mine, Recall, aad Camerine were also handy. When 'the diatance was reached Meteor and Silver Mine had retired, and All Gold was leading Duration and Recall, with Lord Wilton, Camerine, and Claptrap at the head of the others and well up; but at half - distance the race waa reduced to All Gold and Recall. The latter came very fast, and after a few strides he threatened to win, but All Gold answered very generously to Gorry's calls, and drawing away in the last 50 yards he won cleverly by half a length. Duration waa a length off third, and at hia heela were Camerine, Claptrap, and Grace Darling almost abreast, with Lord Wilton and Im pulse next, the last four being The Levite, Sardiua, Rufus, and Shark.

Lady Aahton at once went to the front from Curiosity and Letitia, Lizette being next, the first fence being taken in thia order. Lady Ashton then drew away, and Curioaity, atickiBg to her pair, went_ on at a good pace, and left the others some distance off. Coming into the straight Curiosity fell, and Lady Aahton increased her lead still further from L'zette, Contingent, who was jumping badly, being third a long way behind. At the Btone wall Lady Aahton took off a great diatance and landed on the fence, rolling over on the other aide.
