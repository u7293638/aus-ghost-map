I A Model Theatrical Notice. I BY OUB HYPBUOBITIC. Tho now drama of " Deborah tho Done-for" (adapted from tho French of Leonardo da Vinci) was " un grande success," and is deservedly one of the best and most original works ever submitted to public attention by its author, air William Shakspero, Esq., who sent it out expressly to the management. Mr Buller was the perfection of a famishod father, some of his points re- minding us strongly as Mr George Coppin as Hamlet. Mr Smith was himsolf, und Mr Brown was very funny us the murderer, while Mr Jones as, the ghost was excruciatingly rich. Tho great sensation scene in the last act but seven, where the heroine is rescued by hor futher's cow, was one of those striking bits of nature which the late Mr Kean would, have re- velled in. Mr Bellows's imitation of the jackass in the drawing-room was not acting, it was nature. Mr Stout's Bottom, and Johnson's Snout were both immense. The Shipwreck scone was remarkably grand, and but that the dust raised by the raging billows nearly choked the pit and buried the stalls, would have completely realized thc notion of a bargo hurrying to eternity ; but we think thc ipecachuana light would hare been an improvement in the Poop scene. In short, notwithstanding the dis- approbation at the fall of the curtain, the piece was a genuine success from beginning to end. P.S.-Since writing tho above, wo hear the piece was not played at all, so. our readers will bo kind enough not to read this till it comos out, and so save us further trouble.
