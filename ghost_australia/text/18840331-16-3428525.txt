THE EUROPEAN MAIL. OLD COUNTRY NOTES. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] LONDON, February S. AUK session is open, and somehow we seem to have settled down to Parliamentary) business as if it had been on for months I need not say that nothing has yet been done 1 here has been a good deal of R Randolph Churchill an old) and Mr Gladstone still angels his Liberal friends by being very considerate and polite to the nominee for Woodstock Sir Stafford Northcote has aged very much during the last two years and looks much more the old man than Mr G Liston A most worth) English gentleman he is and citrus trees to a fault The pranks of the horses on his side Randolph Churchill, Ashmead Bartlett, and Drummond Wolff cause others to laugh, but the v ener able Opposition loader seems thoroughly dis- heartened at the damage they inflict upon the fair fame of the party if the Minister) keep in power for another five years or so it will be simply because of the manner in which about a dozen Conservatives' conti is to create a deep rooted distrust in the party to which they belong The count!) at large I suspect would not object to a change, but people would like to feel sure that it they want out of the ft) mg pan they will not fizzle in the file There have been this week a few exciting half hours over the Egyptian dis isters, but the House is already sick of the debate on the Address, and there was a fearful amount of yaw ning after dinner both on Tuesday) and again last night. The P. and Company) are starting another splendid vessel upon service on the Australian line She is 4000 tons burden, named the Valetta and carries not more than 200 passengers The saloon is fitted up with marble, beautifully) ornamented, and designed for coolness in hot climates The Valetta sails for Melbourne next week We are in for a bus) session, though probably it will not prove to be as exciting as many people predict Amongst the items of private legislation there are quantities of bills referring to railway, tramway, and electric lighting schemes The corporations of the country have also plenty of work for the committee rooms One corporation at least seeks, amongst other things, power to put a stop to street processions and bands of music on Sunday Others have clauses in their bills seeking powers to deal with "dangerous amusements and nuisances, bic) cles, tricycles, and other carriages ' An attempt will be made to limit the hours of assistants in shops, somewhat on the principle of the Factory) Act regulations These are specimens of the domestic side of the sessions legislation The novel writer in these days, no less than the future historian may find excellent stock in trade in the daily newspapers In their columns the affairs of State and the social customs are alike pourtrayed The Press is Argus eyed indeed Even the eccentricities of a fashionable doctor are not spared Here, a day or two since, we have an angry gentleman writing to the papers to say that he had made a distinct engagement for a certain day with an eminent West end medical man with a title The medical man fails to keep the engagement, and the papers show that he had, at the time appointed with the patient who was thrown over, gone into the country to see a sick peer The moral is obvious Consult fashionable West end physicians no more The chances are that the patient will be a gainer You may not be able afterwards to console yourself with the reflection that the fingers which have touched a royal via ist has felt your pulse, but you will very likely secure the services of a physician as competent or more competent to treat your c we The authoress of "A Lady's Rule Across Spanish Honduras," now publishing in Black wood's Magazine, is Miss Mary Lester, daughter of the late General Lester, and a member of the family which gave us that most charming novelist, Miss Fernel She has led a busy and adventurous life, having at one time been English governess in the Spanish royal family She has lived in Fiji and Australia, and has a novel ready for the Press She was a teacher at the Brisbane Convent The clergyman who in connection with St Matthew's Guild ventured to discuss the land question from the socialistic" point of view have been somewhat roughly handled The fact that they felt it their duty to argue it as a question that must be dealt with apart from politics and as one of the social problems of the day, is significant in itself, for it and cares, as I suggested a few weeks ago, that there is a shaking in the valley of dry bones in the same category must be placed that clever speech, in which Lord Randolph Churchill pointed out the wicked profligacy) of our public expenditure e When a prominent Conservative does this in such a manner that he is forthwith congratulated by a Financial Reform Association we may well rub our eyes and wake up But this is a question like unto that of the London pool, which continually crops up and blossoms into agitation and then dies down like a garden plant The thing to remember is that the plant is hardy, and that the root does not die There is always therefore, the chance that some good result will one of these days happen All parties in the State know that half the civil servants might be cleared out without loss to the public service, but there has never yet been a party in power that dared to la j the axe to the root of the tree Not a little was I astoMshcd in the course of around I have recently made among the local parliaments to discover that threatened less than that of such societies in London, and that, taking the country through, there are something like SCHOOL members. These associations have existed for many years in Manchester, Liverpool, Carlisle, and other large towns, but the growth in the metropolis is not yet three years old I was prepared at last for a good deal of amusement When young Smith from the city is Minister for War, Brown (a lawyer s clerk) Premier, Jones (a counter jumper) Home Secretary, and Robinson (the grocer) Chancellor of the Exchequer, sitting respectively as members for King's Cross, Clerkenwell, Colney Hatch, and Chowder Bent, take to playing at Parliament, there ought to be some elements of fun My expect station in this respect however, only showed my ignorance I was like the individual who went to scoff and remained to pray At first the solemn manner in which the members addressed the chair, with their "Mr Speaker, sir always being very careful about the pause between the two words-and never failing to use both titles, struck me as odd True this was only following the House of Commons' rule, though old stagers there generally honour it in some such way as, Mr Speaker, I hope the House will bear with me, sir," etc , Le but it showed at least an anxiety to stick to the ancient for ras Ivor could not quite suppress an inward smile when Smith, referred so often and so solemnly to Brown as " my right honourable friend " But all this was more fringe The speeches were the point, and these I invariably found to be well ton received and well delivered The general result of my round of visits is a conviction that these local Parliaments are to be encouraged They give a number of young men subjects for study, practice in an art in which Englishmen are notoriously deficient, and must diffuse a vast amount of political knowledge I wish many members of Parliament would speak such good English, and in so natural a manner, as some of those young men did. Certainly I would recommend the hon. members at West minster who ungathered with the University sing song, which curates have in a most virulent form, to attend the local Parliaments to learn how to speak without winning By this time we are able to take Mary Anderson's measurement Her success has not been checked for a moment She is coming money But her appearance in comedy and tragedy " shows that as an actress she is much inferior to Mrs. Kendal, Bllcii I err;, Mrs Fred, and Ada Cavendish, the only actresses we have, so far as is known, who can rise to the height of either tragedy or good melodrama is one of these are equal to Helen P meet the last of our tragedy queens Mary Anderson has a wealth of talent, carefully trained She has not the sacred fare of genius She never offends, but she never rouses Apart from her beautiful face, she always pleases by her graceful movements and unaffected speech But she is incapable of bringing the ton to the eye by depth of pathos 01 thrilling you with the strength of her jaw sion She does everything well, but is never great Her face, as I have said, is beautiful Rev. felt aim, of which you always see a good deal in the few hunched attitudes in which she has been photographed, is ship- But her figure is bad-up and down from foot to shoulder Any how, she leaped into a try out on his first appeal area, and is first favourite now the forthcoming publication of the Queens book is being widely discussed A kind of Bjiiopsisof its contents has been allowed to appeal in a semi official guise It may or no is not be content Still it is enough to set people talking in a not altogether friendly way. The assumption is that the book is Conservative in tone How a member of any Royal family could be other than Conservative I am at a loss to conceive There would be nothing sur pi ising therefor e, if the stone were Conserve acts of and that we shall have warm eulogy of Lord Beaconsfield would be but natural morn when all the world knows of the Queens opinions that there will be a good deal about John Brown goes without saying also Hut there will not be much said about the Prince of Wales and the borough House need not silt pi lee us Act these subjects are exciting keen expectations of an unusual character, and it is evident that the way is being paved of criticism in certain quarters if the political tendency of the work should turn out to be what is represented A few days ago Mr Edmund "Yates proprietor and editor, played the part of host to his contributors in celebration of the 500th publication of the Moral Amongst the guests were Mr Lycett, who wrote so many of the "Kosmos letters Mr Becker, the manner of most of the "Celebrities at Home Mr Al clubald 101 best one of the ear best and most loyal supporters of the paper, and Mr cole, the small 'Bras de of the World is the father of the " society papers " It has had many imitators some of whom remain unto this present while the others have ) folded up the ghost The only real rival it ever had is Truth, and as successful ventures I face) these two Jima very) close race indeed The action for libel brought by Lord Lonsdale has not been abandoned, but will be heard before many weeks are over unless an arrangement which is now understood to be an impossibility- be arrived at meanwhile The paragraph in the Court Circular announcing that the Queen has not yet recovered from the accident by which she was named last year was generally accepted as a broad hint that she would not be present to open the forthcoming session of Parliament Society accepts it, moreover, as a token that her Majesty will not be much in London during the year. The Queen, as a matter of fact, has been seen very little by the general public ever since the attack upon her by Maclean, at Windsor the year before last From that period the journeys undertaken by the Queen have been different from any that went before Spectators have born rigorously excluded from railway stations and dockyards where aforetime they were allowed to congregate and it is not forgotten that when her Majesty came into London last year to open the Law Courts she drove along the Strand at a rapid trot The Court ceremonies will, therefore, be once more presided over by the Prince and Princess of Wales, who, amongst the other social qualities which endear them to modern society, can boast of being the most zealous pleasure hunters in London there is scarcely a night which does not see them at one or other of the London theatres when they are in town With regard to the opening of Parliament by the Queen, it must be remembered that as a ceremony there is an element of corn cality in it The Queen in her robes upon the Throne, the brilliant dresses of the ladies, the uniforms of officers and diplomatists, contribute to a scene of splendour, but the robes and " belltoppers of the peers are a laughable absurdity, and very pantomimic in effect General Lord Wolseley on Saturday night delivered an important speech to the Artist Rifle Corps He intended that it should be read widely, and prepared it carefully for that purpose Much surprised shall I be if that speech is not used in a manner the General never intended There have been lots of lies told lately about the army It has suited the purposes of interested parties to declare that, in quantity and quality of men our army is a disgrace to the country Lord Wolseley proved how false such statements are But he went further He raised my alarm in my favourite capacity (in this column) of a taxpayer After invoking some laughter at the contented manner in which the people" pay for the forces, he boasted that at the present moment our army consists of "the largest number in times of peace in the memory of man." Accoidtngtoall the rudiments of political economy, this is a fact that should cause men of all sorts and conditions of politics to reflect You do not i e quire to be a peace at any price person to admit this However we have the highest authority for Lord Wolseley is cock of the walk in military matters just now for the truth as to the situation The president of the Royal Academy, who presided at the dinner, is an accomplished courtier, and perhaps could not resist the temptation of saying that the Volunteers were very much indebted to the distinguished guest for their position and rank in the service, and move to the same effect Yet it was Lord Wolseley, as Adjutant-General who wrote a that a letter last week rebuking the Volunteer officers for daring to meet and discuss the forthcoming Easter rev law. The law of coincidences-if any such thing can be set up often assists a good work On Friday Sir W. Harcourt and Sir C Dilke received a deputation which urged that in creased powers should be given to enable local authorities to provide more and better dwellings for the poor. The official was heard the petition with every show of sympathy, both Ministers condemning the corporation of the city for the comings The fact that the corporation many years ago had plans pie passed for suitable dwellings for the pool, jet had never acted upon them till last week, requires no comment On the same day a for ry builder defended an action brought against him for using rubbish instead of mortals He was as bold as you please but the evidence was against him, and he will have to pay the piper The next day we have a heavy gale of wind, and three houses, camped in their construction are blown down as if made of pasteboard Somebody must be pocketing large sums of money out of coursing This sport has been very popular since the establishment of the gate money meetings near London There are numbers of bookmakers who devote themselves entirely to this branch of the art The jargon of coursing is beyond me altogether, and how the daily papers can find it in their hearts to mystify their readers with the slang of the coursing reporter surpasses comprehension After the lost Kempton Park meeting there was a remarkable sale of grey hounds in London four saplings -meaning puppies, and not trees-fetched 290 guineas Plenty of greyhounds went for 60 and SO prices One victorious dog realised 290 guineas, and another which won the Waterloo Cup in 1882, was knocked down at 500 guineas Most of the best "lots' were the progeny of the now famous Misterton, whose owner must be piling up a fortune out of that one bound by stud proceeds It is a little curious that this gentleman was born on a west-country form known for generations as " Dog house Turn " If it was never appropriately named before, it is now, font is Mtstorton's home. It is not possible to conceive of a more regrettable misfortune than a clergyman losing beyond any hope of recovery all his written sermons Such an accident has happened to Dr Barry the new Bishop of Sydney He is about to sail for the new life which he has chosen at the call of duty, and forwarded his boxes of books and manuscripts by the Simla The library and the sermons have gone to the bottom of the sea. The former are insured, but no insurance can cover the latter They are the results of years of experience, study, and labour, and were about 400 in number These sermons would have lasted for twenty years for they would have been quite new to the Australian congregations, and would be; saved the right reverend prelate much thought and work If a man wrote at the highest speed, being already primed with material, the writing of a sea men would occupy at least four hours Allowing for causes and references to books, only those who have ready pens could get through the task under six hours Multiply this by 400 times and you have an idea of the greatness of this misfortune Some preachers would not trouble much if they lost their manuscripts Many congregations would be gainers But Dr Barry is not one of these I can remember that all his good speeches it the London School Board and in Convocation bore evidences of careful preparation, though there were many instances when the exigencies of debate proved him to be a good extempore speaker The new Bishop goes out to the antipodes with the best wishes of his Old King's College students and all who have known him as a popular preacher at Westminster The Pall Mall Gazette is gradually sliding into the solution of a question which has often been asked in this country Would an Illus tested daily paper succeed' In the outline sketches which are now appealing the com iiieiicemeiit cannot be said to be too ambitious the publication along with the criticism of illustrations of the newly produced play "Nell Gwynne at the Avemtf 1 beatie shows how rapidly the work may be done Should this ex) ss uncut succeed there is for us a new era in the history of journalism Simultaneously with this innovation, the Pall Mall adopts the American system of interviewing, and the French system of giving the names of authors of a tides the speeches delivered by Lord Randolph Churchill just before of the meeting of Parks ment are still being discussed, and it is perhaps but natural that in commenting upon his remarks upon wasteful expenditure certain T f . ' w journals shouldNise Lord Randolph himself to point the moral and adorn the tale of hero ditto y pensions It has been it is) explained that the Clan chills have already I received some thing like three quarters of a million of money But the commentators have gone strangely n tea) in speaking of the present owners of Blenheim as line of descendants of the Bar of of Marlborough that great Germ in whoso greed and gi ah all propensities were such that at one period he and his wife, from a variety of offices received over £00000 event from the public funds As a matter of fact the hero of Blenheim left no son, and it his death the name and estate passed to a daughter, and in the course of a generation into quite another branch of the family the name of Cluuclnll was out of the passage until the beginning of the piosontccntui), and the family now is that of Spencer Churchill While we are about it, we may as well be accurate even in non essential details If the old portraits are of any value there is not a member of the present family whereas the slightest resemblance to Queen Anne's favourite There would seem to be trouble ahead in London with regard to its School Board That body of elected representatives are making us pay) the piper to a very shrill tone We are rated for School Board purposes at Sid in the pound, and if some of the members had had their way it would have been nearly double that high figure Yet the last election, which was pretty hotly contested everywhere, turned almost entirely upon the question of expenditure The extravagance of the former board was most eloquently denounced and several of the most ardent reformers were returned on account of their wholesale pledges of economy And this is the issue! Some day there will be a big low People who a few years ago were hailing the spread of education in State schools, as the first step towards a true civilisation, are now looking upon the other side of the shield In moderation they would not object to pay for the education of the thousands whose parents are unable or unwilling to pay for them, but they look upon the fine buildings erected wholesale and upon the huge sums spent upon architects and solicitors, and ask themselves how long the growing expenditure is to continue ' They may arrive at the answer quickly It will go on in creasing just as long as they are willing to give the present members the power of levying Nothing is more tempting than the opportunity of spending some body else's money Nothing seems to scatter economical resolutions to the winds so quickly as that opportunity The members of the School Boards mean well no doubt, but they appear to have a deeply rooted conviction that their first duty is to put the saddle upon the ratepayers, and draw the girths fight flic willing horse has taken to shying lately, and rearing Nott it will buck and bolt and precipitate the rider into the ditch At the fancy dress ball at Hampton Court a few days ago the only members of the Royal Family present were the Duke of Albany and the Princess Beatrice The Prince and Princess of Wales were absent, though they were at a theatre in London the same night The explanation is that the hostess of the hall was the Princess Frederica who has never yet been forgiven by some of the Queen's children for marrying the German baron The Queen, however, is always loyal in her friendships, and unwavering in her purposes That is why she sent Princess Beatrice, and that is why the Duke of Albany, who is more amenable than his brothers, accompanied her There have been three baby lions exhibited in London of late, but it is not correct to say that they were imported Two of them were born in a travelling menagerie Strangely enough lionesses will not breed in our Zoological Gardens, yet they breed freely at the Dublin Gardens Zoologists are not able very positively to explain why this happens The reason probably is that the lions and lionesses in Regent's Park are too well looked after and too much looked at When I last saw the Dublin menagerie I was struck with the strong flavour of the lions den, and was informed that such a condition of things was more in accordance with nature than the cleanly swept and garnished cages in the Zoological Gardens in London. The Mr Leslie, who was killed in the recent fiasco in the Egyptian desert was the special correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, and both Cameron and Macdonald, of the Manila) d and Daily News respectively, were for an hour in the thick of the running massacre The Mr Ellen thorpe, who has been represented as the Telegraph's correspondent at the seat of war is the correspondent at Cairo, and not at Suakin All the spring flowers which used to appeal in the London sheets not earlier than the beginning of March, are now being hawked about event Garden has thus, through the mildness of the season, stolen a month from winter, and is proportionately busy An agricultural gentleman informs me that the farmers in his part of the country have been able, for the first time for fifteen years, to got their land thoroughly cleaned The old proverb was, therefore, not far out in insisting that it is an ill wind indeed which does not blow (good to somebody The leniency of Mr Justice Hawkins to wards the fire (fighters who not long since came before him may have something to do with the revival of prize fighting in this country There were two regularly planned combats of this description fought out last week on the time dishonoured rules of the pi lee ring A month since there was a most brutal fight in the East End between two women, but the affair was kept secret and the combatants and their abettors escaped detection at the time Bell's Life a fortnight since republished the detailed description of the memorable fight between Heenan and Sayers It is a remarkable curiosity even now The language of the " i mgs " read like an unknown tongue Nothing has come under my notice which so star dingly shows up the contrast between men and manners then and now Yet it seems but a short time since I looked upon that assembly of blackguards titled and in titled rich and poor clerical and lay down on the Hampshire borders, one line spring, day I can, in fancy, still hear the thuds which followed the terrible blows of Heenan, each round telling those who could not see that Sayers had again been felled to the earth That was the lastch&mpionshiphght;, but it was the greatest For two hours and twenty minutes those men hammered at each other, the little Englishman half the time with his right arm disabled, the gigantic American, towards the close, blind in both eyes After the sickened feeling which the brutal exhibition gave me at first had worn away, a sense of wonder overwhelmed rose at the good temper shown by both men Sayers especially, after being felled like an ox, would Return to his man with a smile upon his battered features Heenan ultimately hit out alike at friends and foes He had become simply a wild beast mad with fury But, hateful as the whole spectacle was, you could not help being powerfully impressed with the marvellous courage and endurance of the men The last man in the world would be to copy c poor children of pleasure Nevertheless I do not like these assemblages of charity children at the pantomimes It is a shrewd method of getting notices for the theatre, but apart from the dislike I have of putting a lot of children in charity dresses up for show, 1 doubt the effect of a modern pantomime upon the minds of the girls If they go home fired with the belief that the finest thing in the world would be to dress as the ballet girls do, and to kick up their legs after the manner of Kate Vaughan, they would have been far better away 'that a canon of St. Pauls should permit himself to play into an astute managers hands so far as to appear on the stage and make a speech to the charity child i ch is amusing There were GOOD children present Is it unreasonable to suppose that there will be 3000 boys and girls who will henceforth decline to accept the ridiculous old dictum there is a line between the Chin cb. and the world The engagement between Lord Garmoyle and May Finnie; is broken off It will be the making of the lady's fortune No one imagines that the talked of breach of promise case will over come into court The paragraphs in on dilation however, will insure Miss Finney s pecuniary success on the stage, to which she will return, andgivehcranopportunityof showing whether she can act Hitherto, she has given no such proof She was a passable figurate, unknown outside of the Savoy theatre, and known there amongst her companions in the chorus as a girl who was able to look uncommonly well after her own interests Now she has achieved notoriety If she has adults she will be; e w ery charge of distinguish mg herself, if not, she will still be able to travel on view ' as Mrs Langtry has done As for Lord of array le, to those other young men of family, to whom the revelation of his debts and doings would act as sanitary ware ing, and who haunt bars and slate roofs doors, a of land for breach of the cause might not be with out some wholesome influence Tilt new Chinese ironclad, the Nin Thin or Jewel of the South, lately launched at Kiel, is supplied with revolving guns and is accompanied by a torpedo boat
