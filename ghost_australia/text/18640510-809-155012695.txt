THE SCHNAPPER POINT POST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AOE. Sir,— A lank shadow, which looks liko a thin boy, is seen daily walking the ' Long Beach,' dragging after him a miserable wretch that has some mystified shape of a horse, with a mail-bug at times on tho back of the beast, and not unfrcqucntly on that of tho boy. Both horse and boy aro the pictures of extreme misery and privation — tho boast, according to the boy's version, lives on tho produco of tho Long Beach, which is sand, and tho boy goes with out food all day, sometimea for twenty-four hours ; on ono of which occasions ho was benighted on tho road, and had tho benefit of tho mail-bag for a pillow. But the unfortunnto lad toils on — cold or heat, sunshino or rain, it matters not, the shivering being, habited only in a ahirt and trousers, plods his wretched courso, day by day, striving hard to do liver a mail-bag, which he manages to do at soino unknown period during tho interval of four hours and twenty later than the proper timo. Pray advise your readers that thoro aro no real ghosts on tho ' Long Beach,' but that tho boy and beast are actual flesh and blood, employed in tho mail service — I am, Sir, your obedient sorvant, JAS. E. WORRELL. Schnapper Point, 7th May, 1864.
