Tennyson's " Queen Mary.' Is Saul also among the prophets ? Has Tennyson enrolled himself upon the list of dramatists who constitute the glory of our national litera- -ture ? And has he succeeded in establishing his claims to a patent of nobility, and to a seat in the intellectual House of Peers, of which Shakespeare is the Lord High President ? These are the questions which were very generally asked when it was first announced that the Poet Laureate was preparing a dramatic poem or a poetical drama. Most persons expected that "Queen Mary would prove to be the former. For Mr. Tennyson's chief strength has hitherto 1ain in picturesque narrative, and in the lyrical expression of delicate emotion. His writings are characterized by sweetness rather than strength. His and is more akin to that of the painter than to that of the sculptor. The one shows us the completed human figure, whether in action or repose , we can walk all round it, and study it on every side; while the other exhibits the surface of things, the play of color on them and the accidents of light and shade. Mr. Tennyson has constructed for us in his "Idylls of the King," his "Enoch Arden", and his "Holy Grail", a picture gallery as full of beautiful compositions as the "Faery Queene" of Spenser. The charm of the drawing and the splendor of the color line delighted all lovers of the picturesque in poetry; and some of the landscapes in "In Memoriam," enveloped in the soft haze of an English atmosphere, are simply exquisite. In 'The Princess" there were some hints of dramatic power, for the dialogue and the situations gave evidence of this; but nobody expected to find the author of these poems making, a sudden and successful diversion into a field in which he would have to measure his strength against such a formidable host of illustrious predecessors. This however, is what he has done. It would be wrong to speak of "Queen Mary" as a great work. We regarding rather is an essay, or trial at arms, much as we regard the earlier plays of Shakespeare here, with this important difference-that the Poet Laureate he has not applied himself to this form of composition until his powers were fully matured. The transition from "Locksley Hall" and the "Vision of Sin to "Queen Mary" has not been so rapid and abrupt as was the transition from the "Rape of Lucrece" and "Venus and Adonia" to "Pericles" and the "Comedy of Errors," And these two pi issue full of comedies, which are not discoverable in Mr. Tennyson's historical drama. So, too, while they disclosed the promise of still better things to come, there is also in "Queen Mary" the assurance of the possession, on the part of the part of the poet, of powers as yet but partially developed for Mr. Tennyson's mind is one of those which, like Cervantes, ripens late; and the last fruit of the vine may prove to be the richest it has borne. The crowned and wedded life of "Bloody Mary" is the subject of the drama which opens with her procession through the city, and closes with her miserable death. The dallying of the Princess Elizabeth with the Earl of Devon, the preaching of Father Bourne at Paul's Cross, the insurrection of the men of Kent under Wyatt the wilfulness of the Queen in the matter of her marriage with the odious Spaniard, the imprisionment of Elizabeth at Woodstock, the condemnation of Cranmer, and his martyrdom, the growing indifference of Philip to his wife, her anguish at continuing childless, her fanaticism, and her wretched end, combine to fill the play with incident and passion. It contains enough "bustle" to satisfy the in most impatient of audiences; and its variety, as well as its vivacity, ought to make it popular as an acted drama. The language is simple and natural to a fault, and monosyllabic to the very verge of baldness. Anything like redundancy of words is carefully avoided, and so is a Reaper flinty of ornament 'thousand phrase ology of Home of the Elizabethan di unionists, so frequently imitated by modern players lights, has been scrupulously eschewed by Mr Tennyson , and his preference for homely Saxon English is as conspicuously exhibited in " Queen Mary ' as it was in that noblest of elegiac poems, "In Memoriam," whole eighty-nine per cent of the words are Anglo Saxon vocables. And while upon this subject, we would call special attention to the preponderance of monosyllables in this drama, as a proof of the poets diligent study both of his master Shakespeare's writings, and of the Holy Scriptures. In these and in those, wherever powerful emotion has to be expressed, words of one syllable only are chiefly employed Take the death of King Lear, for example When the aged monarch gradually admits into his mind the awful conviction that his beloved daughter, the only anchor of his hope, the stay, support, and solace of his weary life, is irretrievably lost to him, a wail of terrible anguish rises to Heaven from his grieving lips; and, uttering these piteous accents, the heart-broken old man bows his head and dies - No, no, no life! Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more Never, never, never, never, never! Pray you undo this button Thank you, sir; Do you see this? Look on her, - look, - her lips, - Look there, look there! And the film of death gathers over his dim eyes, as he points with infinite tenderness and yearning love to the stark body of his child. The impressive simplicity of this passage exhausts admiration ; and it well be observed that, of the forty-seven words which it contains - excluding repetitions - no less than forty-four are monosyllables. Now let us turn to the touching narrative of Joseph's interview with his brethren, as recorded in the Book of Genesis, and note how admirably the redundancy of monosyllables conduces to the solemn pathos of the story -" And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to the earth. And he asked them of their welfare, and said, is your father well? The old man of whom ye spake, is he yet alive? And they answered, thy servant, our father, is in good health. He is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me ? And he said, God be gracious unto thee my son. And Joseph made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother, and he sought where to weep, and he entered into his chamber, and wept there Now, of the 138 words of which this passage is composed, 107, or upwards of three fourths, are words of one syllable and ne dwell upon this fact with all the greater emphasis, because the tendency of much of our current literature is towards polysyllabic utterance and inflated and artificial phraseology Against this treason to our noble mother tongue, Mr 'Tennyson silently protests by the very] structure of " Queen Mary ' Opening the book at random, we find eighty three words of dm logue on one page, the 110th, and seventy two of them monosyllables and the same simplicity of diction distinguishes the play throughout In character painting, the Poet Laureate effects his object by a fervid touches and Gardiner, Philip, Mary, Gummer, and the Cardinal pass before us as they lived The Protestant and patriotic sentiment is strong and active in Mr Terry souls mind. His sympathies are with Elisabeth and England, as ac, count the persecuting Queen and her Spanish husband and there are passages in the drama which are animated by the same spirit as the well known speech of King John to the Cardinal Randulph .
