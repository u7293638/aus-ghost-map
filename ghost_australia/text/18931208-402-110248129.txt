Sweet Peas and Flies. The " Scientific American," quoting from the " Louisville Journal," gives the following. The accuracy of the statement can be tested by those of our readers who grow sweet peas and are troubled with flies : " ' Come inside a minute,' said a Fourth Avenue dealer in pianos, yesterday afternoon. ' I have discovered the greatest fly trap on earth and I want to show it to you.' He led the way to an instrument at the rear of the store on which was a newspaper. On the paper had been placed a bunch of sweet peas. At least a thousand dead flies were lying on the paper in the immediate vicinity of the bunch of flowers. ' I threw these here by chance,' he continued, ' and in about ten minutes I noticed that every fly that alighted on the flowers died in a very short time.' Even as he spoke a number of the insects which had stopped to suck the deadly sweet had toppled over dead. They alighted with their usual buzz, stopped momentarily, quivered in their legs, flapped their wings weakly several times, and then gave up the ghost."
