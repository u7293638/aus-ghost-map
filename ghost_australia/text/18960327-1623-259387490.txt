TWO HUMOURISTS. Colonel Will H. Vischer, the humourist, enjoys the reputation for homeliness. Speaking of his yearnings for homeliness, the humourist said : " When I married and bad a little daughter, I had someone who really admired me. To her I was an Apollo. One day Bill Nye was in my office with me, and my little girl came in and began making love to me, as was her way, calling me all sorts of sweetnames. ' Nice papa," said she, "pretty papa.' .Nye turned around and sxid in his peculiar jdrawl : ' Vischer, are you trying to make a .humourist out of that child ! " I am very much better this morning," (said Mrs. McBride. "I feel like n new •woman." " I hope you won't, dress like ,one," replied her husband fervently. i Little Boy : That ink that papa writes with isn't indelible ink, is it. Mother : No. I'm glad of that." "Why?" "I've spilt it all over the carpet." ' Sparhawk : I thought the authorities in lyoui- city didn't allow prizefighters to give {exhibitions. Ringrope : They don't, but jsince the fighters began to kill each other the law hasn't been enforced." '; A trde of the great frost comes from ;Glasgow, where, says the "New Age," an aged clergyman with a cold church and a ;very small congregation, touched a chord ;in every heart by praying, with great frankness and spontaneity, " 0 Lord, if we had studied our own comfort, we would not have been here this morning." : it is not, generally known, in connection .with Eudynrd Kipling's early life, that to fbe haunted by a terrible apparition, which ;took the form of a grandmother's ghost, was almost the constant plague of. liis <»ristwHTic.0 as a boy. :„.
