ORIGINAL POETRY. SUNSET ON THE MURRAY: WINTER. I watched the sun slow-sinking through the wood, And rosy clouds rise up at his retreat- ing Marking tho spot where day with light was fleeting, And shadows fell across me as I stood. Over the river rose a misty cloud, And hovered o'er the waters; through the green It traced its many windings, else, un- seen-- Like a pale ghost it trailed its vapour shroud. Out from the west came a freshening breeze, The air grew colder as this courier Of might announced her presence now was near-- It shook the leaves and whispered to the trees; The new moon from a cloud dropt to the view. Long did I gaze, until her slender frame Gleamed golden, and the faintest out- line came (So bright upon the sky her beauty grew), Of her round form of fall maturity, And shone a beacon o'er the shadowy scene; And night was regnant where the day had been, With one great star attendant bonnily. Then turned I homeward-set my pleas√©d face; The comeliness of this one perfect hour Moved as a spirit with me, and its power To peace and great content attuned my pace. M. M.
