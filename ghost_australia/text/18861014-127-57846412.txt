THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE. Against the wooded hills it -tands, Ghost of a dead. home, staring through Its broken lights on wasted lands, Where old time harvest grew. Unplonghed, unsown, by scythe unahorn, The poor forsaken fari- fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale gieer breadths of rye. Cf healthful herb and flower blisefit, The-garden plot - l housewife keeps; Through weeds and tanigle only left, The snake, its tenant, creeps. A li!ac spray, once blossom clad, Sways bare before the- empty rooms; Beside the roofe-s por.h a amd, Pathetic red ruse blooms.
