The grass Valloy Tlilino* makes tho follow ing mention of a spccimon of this subterran can vegetation : " On Saturday somo miners found a rather queer specimen in tho 700 lovel in the Idaho mine. Tho specimen which was found among the timber, is a sort of fungus (punk, wobeliovo tho miners call it), and is just tho shape of a human hand. Tho hand has five fingers and a thumb, and appears to be in a sort of cramp ed position. It is a singular looking speci men, and may bo seen at the Wisconsin hotel." In tho lower levels of tho Comstoek mines -particularly those long abandoned or un used-aro seen many wonderful growths of different kinds of fungi. Somo of these aro of great size, almost filling up drifts, and seen by tho dim light of a oandlo look liko sheeted ghosts.
