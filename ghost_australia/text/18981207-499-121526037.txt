Slowly, under the gentlo brooze, the Ca talina. guided by her victor, swung round and headed for tho Islo of Mists; audr a second hail, fiorcoly Insolent, rang from tho Fair Fortune, woll astern of us. ' 'Givo them a reply in an iron tongue,' warbled the Marquis.

The shot struck the lugger's bov.'3, and hy .the howling of her crow wo guessed moro than slight' damage had been done. Laughing long and jeoringly, the Rogues kept on their way.

In an hour, when the grey gloom of breaking morn changed to. soft pink and glorious opal, and tho sea gieamed a vivid emerald, the Fair Fortune was naught. but a., black spec, -drifting cap talnless towards southern waters.

'Twas v/ondrous to note the change which seemed to pass over tho bucccaneers as soon as they touchod land. They appeared to loso all souse' of discipline; they were no longer saamen ruled by a hand of iron, but gay, laughing gentlemen, full of most rollicking bonhomie. They jested with the Marquis as a revered, but beloved equal, and' treated Copplurtone with no more de ference than ono Rogue at 'tny time used towards a companion of tho Brotherhood. All restraint had vanished;' they .swung along free 33 air, and no sign of grief for tlio slain shone in their eyes or roiled from, their tongues.
