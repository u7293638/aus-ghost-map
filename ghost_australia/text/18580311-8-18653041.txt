WAS A GHOST SEEN? To the Editor of the Maitland Mercury. Gentlemen-Some time since, an account of the ap- pearance of a ghost in this quarter was noticed under the head of " Strange if True." It is now time the ab- surdity of that tale should be exposed to the public, as it has been to every one in the quarter. The woman that pretends to have seen the apparition, holds long conversations with it, and goes from house to house, in- forming the neighbours of what the ghost has told her is to take place. In every instance it has proved itself a bad prophet. Not content with that, she stated lately that the ghost informed her that it was my intention to murder her on a certain day, and prevailed on two or three of the neighbours to keep watch over her with loaded guns, to shoot me if I made my appearance. To manage it more effectually, one was concealed in the scrub, and another in the creek, where the body of the murdered woman lies. Of this the parties who kept watch informed me. With regard to the spot pointed out as the site of the grave, it has been searched and dug up ; a bone was got, but unfortunately for her vera- city it turns out to be a bullock's bone. I may mention that I have known this woman for some years, and during that time she has seen some scores of spirits of people both alive and dead my own wife among the number. According to her account, ghosts ride on horseback as well as walk; whethor the bone is real or not I cannot say, but all here say that the whole story, with all particulars of information received from the spirit, is only an invention of her own brain. The subject has here become quite a byword and a mockery. -l am, gentlemen, yours, obodiently), JOSEPH ROLFE. Quorobolong, March, 1858.
