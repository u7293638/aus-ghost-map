PORTFOLIO. There is something very wonderful in music. Words are wonderful enough; but music is even more wonderful. It speaks not to our thoughts as words do; it speaks straight to our hearts and spirits, to the very core and root of our asoul. Insic soothes us, stirs us up; it puts noble feelings into us; it melts u s to tears, we know not how; is a language by itself, just as perfect in its way as speech, as words; just u divine, just as blessed. Music has been called the speech of angels ; I will go further, and call it the speech of God Himself. . . Yes, I say it with all reverence; but I do say it. There is music in God. Not the music of voice or sound; a musio which no ears can hear, but only the spirit of a man, when awakened by the Holy Spirit, and taught to know God-Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. There is one everlasting melody in heaven, which Christ, the Word of God, makes for ever, when He does all things perfectly, and wisely, and righteonsly, and gloriously, full of grace and truth ; and from that all melody comes, and is a dim pattern thereof here ; and is beauti ful only because it is a dim pattern thereof.
