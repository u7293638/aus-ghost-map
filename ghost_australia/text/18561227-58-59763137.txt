TUG BACHELOR'S REQUIEM. ' Br FRANK, FARLOWB. Gono to the grave ! with no wife to cheor him. No children to kiss him, no friends round to sigh- ( Alone -with his head on an empty cigar-box, H's feet on the fender-he laid down to die. Dying alone, with no friends to surround him But the rats and - the mice, that gaze awo ,stricken on, Who left their rich meal of his boots and his ,' papers,, gi To finish their feast when his spirit has gone. Haggard and worn are the bachelor's features; His checks aro all sunken, his brow coldly damp, His eyes black'as coals, with one faint spark to light 'om; , Aitd this is the end of the merciless scamp. ' , He writhes, 'neath' the last 'pang of torturing conscience, H is bosom is heaving-that never heaved yet He thinks of the thousands of hearts ho' has broken. Of the thousands of loves he has won-to forget. Hark! there's a rustling of robes in the entry, . And daintily treading, 'como pretty young feet; The door swings wide open, thc ghosts make their ¿titree, . The flirt and his victims on earth again meet. There werè bright' giggling maidens ' and beau- teous ladies. ¡ " Arch, mischievous jades/ with much fun in their eyes; ? : j And withered old maids, and half-crazy young I damseli, . '. I Who've called in to see the bid bachelor die. | He gives them one glance, and his eye flashes fury He turns to reproach them-alas, they are gone ! The rats and the mice have impanneled a jury The bachelor shivers, and dies all alone. Alone' itt his glory I with empty old bottles, And 'tailors' and boot : bills, ' and' club bills ' around. With one hand convulsively clutching the poker. And the other a crushed billet-doux, be is 'found. '
