Robert Burns. I see amid the fields of Ayr, A ploughman, who in foul or fail', Sings at his task, So clear we know not if it is The laverock's song we hear, or his, Nor care to aek. For him the ploughing of those fields A more ethereal harvest yields Than sheaves of grain ; Songs flush with purple bloom the rye -r The plover's call, the curlew's cry, Sing in his brain. Touched by his hand, the wayside weed Becomes a flower ; the lowliest reed BcEide the stream Is clothed with beauty ; gorsc and grass And heather, where his footsteps pass, The brighter seem. He eings of love, whose flame illumes The darkness of lone cottage rooms ; He feels the force, The treacherous under-tow and stress. Of wayward passions, and no less The keen remorse. At moments, wrestling with his fate. His voice is harsh, but not with hate ; The brush-wood hung Above the tavern door lets fall Its bitter leaf, its drop of gall, Under his tongue. But still the burden of his song Is love of right, disdain of wrong ; Its master-chord b Are Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood j Its discords but an interlude Between the words. And then to die so young, and leave Unfinished what he might achieve ! Yet better sure Is this than wandering np and down An old man, in a country town, Infirm and poor. For now he haunts his native land Ab an immortal youth ; hia hand Guides every plough ; He site beside each ingle-nook ; His voiee is in each rushing brook, Each rustling bough. His presence haunts this room to- night, A form of mingled mist and light, From that far coast. Welcome beneath this roof of mine ! Welcome 1 this vacant chair is thine, Dear guest and ghost ! â€”Henry W. Longfellow, in Harper's for August.
