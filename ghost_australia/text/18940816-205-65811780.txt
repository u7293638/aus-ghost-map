Frankstoka to the Rear. TO T.IE EDLTOR. Sir,-M-1y ?iritnalis:ic propensiirs. have taught rue, quite unexpectedly, t., be an observer of all things going on around us. Let me now point out that from your coloms I find that Frar ti ston is going fast to the rear; much faster, in fact, than even I bad ex pected, for the proposed division of the shire into three ridings with one of those ridings named the " Centre" is intended evidentiy to fr.strate all that has been done recently as regards the meet;ngs of the Council by bringing forward a motion that the central rid ing shall be so named that it may be selected as the particular spot where all meetings of the Shire of Frankston and Hastings shall be held in the future. Now this is directly opposed to all the preachings of the past, and it must be observed that should such a proposition come to the fore on Friday next, at the meeting of the Shire Council, great care must be taken that Frankston and Hastings are not unfairly treated. In times past Frankston has been enough on the back seat and in imy nightly spiritual visits, at my cost, I have had to deplore that I could not make my rounds without being toy visible, in consequence of the great improvements as regards light and its powers, in that township ; therefore I conclude that '" progress" is not the watchword of those who are now seeking to have the old cause of complaint, that of one meeting place only for the Council, being perpetuated. Frankston beware. ''THE GHOST."
