CORRESPONDENCE. TO 'JILT EUIL'OH. SIR—I nolice in your IBSAE of 11th inst of "Justitia " having contradicted several statements of the evidence given in the Stirling school enquiry case. He states that the evidence given by me is all one sided. Now Mr. Editor bow- can it be otherwise than a one sided affair when there were seven witnesses against one as Mr O'Leary only called one witness for the defence, but as regards the greater portion of the evidence being not reported I can challenge " Justitia " on that point as there is only a little that in left out and the reason was because the witnesses spoke to low to be heard where I was pitting; but as for anything being incorrect I hereby contradict the statement most emphatically. I can assure " Justitia" that I am not the writer of the letters signed "Pro Bono Publico." "Justitia"' does not want to give the memorialists a ghost of a chance of fair play, for why is he in favour of the school master to remain when he says he knows neither of the parties. I say if the present teacher does not suit tbe place it would be better for him to ask to be removed to a more suitable school than to be altrays in hot water. I have no animosity against Mr O'Leary but at the same time it is very hard upon little children to have to walk to the Port Augusta school when there is one within a half a mile of their homes. Mr O'Leary I believe to be a good teacher butthe residents here don't approve of him. As for the children not using bad language as "Justitia" says I again contradict him, as I have heard them myself and have chastised them for it; morover I say that most of the children are very unmannerly and vulgar in their speech, whose fault it is I know not, whether the parents or tbe teacher's. In conclusion I mean to say that " Justita " is very unfair in his letter, as he would not give the parents a chance to have their children properly taught if he had his way of ruling the district.—I am &c.; t STIRLINGITE.
