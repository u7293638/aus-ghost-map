There were 13 people in the yacht Ripple when she capsized last Sunday off Sydney Heads A venerable old lady in 'the city ejaculated as soon as she had read the details of the disaster, ' You couldn't expect anything else from a party of 13 " Nobody can realise how deeply the superstition of numbers is embedded in our common literature nature until a tragedy occurs Like that of Suucl ly last We may think that a modern education has handed us away from the dread superstitions of our forefathers, who dwelt surrounded by ghostly horrors in the dim grey dawn of history, but the sinking of the Ripple tears the thin veneer of civilisation from our hearts, and we hear the voices all about UB telling how close w to stand to our remote ancestor s Thefio vague meaningless superstitions which stood over us at times are but the sad reminders of witch drowning waters such as bathed our forefathers in the long ago Ino thirteen superstition is but one of the eternal guide posts on the world's great thoroughfare When we hear the quaint old-world fancies about the power of numbers, we stand face to face with the dead philo- sphere of long perished races, and we listen, sadly enough, to the echoed of ancient faiths, and we say With Richard II - Let's talk of gi ales and worms and epitaphs , Make unit our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrows in the bosom of the earth. The idea of the poll er of numbers is old, old and hoary It belongs not to Christian times or to pagan tunes, nor to any special time Modem people, with the egotism of wide humanity, say that the number 13 is unlucky because there were 19 at the Paschal Supper, when the betrayer sat with his Master Never since that time, EUJ the world's old wives, have to people sat at meat together but what death or disaster has i come to one of them within the year Never have 13 people lived together, sailed together, or sat together since that fatal night without disaster, and tins Ripple tragedy proves that the superstition is true it We hear of the crew hero, so it must be true ' Three years ago a party of ladies and gentlemen dined at a 1 ago and fashionable hotel in New South Wales They wore scientific, scholarly, thoughtful people Just as they sat down to dinner a grey-haired lady, mistress of a large educational establishment, noticed that there were 13 guests at the table She rose in horror and refused to sit with her friends brother table had to be prepared and the company divided, and then it transpired that several members of the party shared the same superstition That was startling, indeed, to those who held that the superstitions of old hodprssid away, but it gave anon meaning to the talk of old raised to Mrs Quickly 11 This is the third time I hope good luck lies in odd numbers They say there is a divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death " "Verily, there is a wonderful power in odd numbers, for we know men who when they are sick will undertakers even number of pills, and the same class of people are very particular about always putting an odd number of eggs beneath a setting hen There is something very fan tan tie in this ins x to us busy, prac local matter-of-fact Austruhms but the idea has dominated the world for untold ages, long before Christ was born, or history was written When we bear the loud-mouthed cannon, pouring out a royal salute over by duty Harbour, we never dream that it is connected with the superstitions of our forefathers of the wreck of the Ripple , but so it is' no royal salute consists of 21 guns, or three times seven and seven is a sacred number An honourable and esteemed good man in the olden time wrote "to the numbers of seven there is a musical perfection which our understandings cannot attain unto, and nature heiaUf ia observant of this number " Our astronomical-astrological (?) forefathers held that there womanly seven planets, and they proved" that there could not possibly be more, to cause seven was a sacred number, and there were only seven holes in the human face, so that there could not possibly be more planets When modem science made the earth into a planet, and took the sun and moon out of the list, and discovered a few hundred extra planets and planetoid, it was bad for the number superstition but old beliefs die hard, and the wreck on Sunday last proves it But the superstition in regard to the power of numbers has been felt all over the world, in all lands and times Without referring to Virgil or the classic teachers of antiquity, NO can find ample testimony to the strength of the belief in numbers in our own race and religion The good beat Austin believed that Christ was to have twelve Apostles, because, he said, the Gospel was to be preached in the four corners of the M world in tho name of the Trinity and three times four make two We " But was good logic to the men who preceded us on the earth it was quite unanswerable, because our race bell over in the sacred power of number When science took the corners of our earth and made it into a ball it would have been hard on tho doctrine of the "four country," but it didn't nilcetitnbit Benson and superstition are strangers we do not discover ghosts by means of reason, but through blind, fearsome-, winning faith, and we could not get rid of ancient superstitions by means of modern knowledge We drank in the e old beliefs with our mother B milk nay, we inherited some of them, and we believe things that we know are wrong, in spite of our judgment, because we are human One 01 Lugh ud's greatest Chancellors confessed to a fear of "hosts, and to his dying day, because of a nurse girl who had filled his child-mind with goblin Port. This faith in the power of numbers is part of our homage flora unknown, far- away ancestors, who lived in the gloom or time, are books were born in the far away, days, Salaam said to Bar IN Building here over altars, and prepare me here set out oxen and seven rams," and now we have seven days the week, and three times seven in it Boy i ! salute When A a inns, the leper, went to Elisha to be cured, the prophet told him to go and bullion seven times in the Jordan and all through Sacred Writ to the same idea of the intrinsic value of numbers, "so that v he n we come down the avenues of time to the Last Supper the belief in numbers was already old undeserved but the tragedy of Call any gave the number 13 a new start through the world, and it comes into the bight now in Sydney in connection with this latest disaster to a little yacht We shall hear of it over and over again in the people who believe that the seventh son of a seat nth sou is a born leader of the people will believe that the Ripple says because there were 13 on Lo ml of her and sensible ยก people will mean when they had how ignorant and superstitious who no in spite of our books, our schools, and our nineteenth century eil sensation As with numbers, so with dry We have believed, until very lately, that Friday was an unlucky day Sailors would not sail on Trid iv s, and I have seen some strange incidents in connection with that super station, which has been almost driven out of the world by the steamboat Aten tell in gloomy whispers, even now, of a ship captain who has a need Friday He determined to end, once for all the gloomy superstition of his sailors He had the bed of a new ship laid on ii Friday she was launched on a 1 ado she sided on a Friday, under the command of Captain I Friday and she was never heard of more' So the sailors say, and they try to keep the old t, edition alive, but the steamboat and the exigencies of modern trade are against them Yet there are lhirteeuClubs" m thoworielto-dav, which meet on Ti ida j is to face the bitter old super station which most people thinK could well he left to I die a natural death but this disaster to the Ripple has awakened a sleeping terror in the belts of the superstitious, and we can see how all the world, ancient and modern, is bound together in a mystic chain of ignorance, woe, and superstition, such is makes us feel our motherhood with all man- kind TV here that laughing party sailed out in their little yacht on Sunday afternoon tomeottho mighty rollers of the smiling passionless sea they little dreamed that they were going, by their deaths, to sanctify and perpetuate a miserable old superstition which lies dormant in the big end of mankind but the old lady's ejaculation on Monday morning showed that they had done so, and brought us all into what Mrs Browning calls this " ever lasting face to face I with God."
