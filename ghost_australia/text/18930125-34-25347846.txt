THE COMING ELECTIONS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—I notice in your paper that our member, the Hon. A. Catt, has been visiting thedistrict and waiting on his constituents; one or two storekeepers and agents, I suppose. What about visiting the working men and email holders, wbo are the bone and sinew of the district 1 Slime of the earth, I suppose; they can go as they please. The pipe track and that great farce of a public work, the Birth and Gladstone railway, are the two last places for men of South Australia to find work. What are they good for?—onlv for a few of the top officers from the Public Works Department. Slow and sure goes far in the day, and that seems to be the way these two works are carried on. It may not be the fault altogether of the officers on the ground. If is is not it must be the fault of the heads of the departments in Adelaide. Perhap« King Smith has to be consulted. Anyhow, Messrs. Cats and Howe will be asked some hard ques tions about their stewardship on the hustings. If they can answer them well one of them may come oat on top on polling day, but if not one thing is certain — the labor man will go in. At least, here he will poll pretty strong, and in other outside places too. —I am, &c.;, GHOST OF HAMLET. Crystal Brook, January 23, 1893.
