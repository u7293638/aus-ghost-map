Sporting Notes. (By ' Tobyboy.') Today the Autumn meeting of the Tas manian Turf Club takes place and as I am writing, the weights have been handed to me by the handicapper. He leads off with the Autumn Hurdle, a mile and a half spin, and lifts All Fouro up to list 21b. Why? What has he done lately? It is a cruel iiupu&u; uiiu uuuBiuBriii^ wuui* jjuuubim uuu Mount Lyell have done, is not just. Glanc ing down the list I can only Epeak 'on paper,' And I must put Rebecca and Manuka to the front with Mount Lyell next: Mozart leads off in the Autumn Handicap with list '51b, and in mentioning this I am bold to say it is a misprint, list 51b— Great' Cajsarl- what' insult'has poor Mozart inflicted on.Mr.Mqnaghan?. What has he done to merit this punishment ; and Promised Land too, how can he be expected to go a mile and -a half with a few pounds under lOst ? I cannot go through the lot but as' a disciple of weightsgive me Red Kose with 83t 21b, Diamond 7st and Lizzie 7st 61b. ' Sir Wilfred gets, it hot in the steeple with 13st lib.. That means about two Jockeys in the pigskins, consequently I will, pick Black Jack ?. with 9st 71b and Bere'sford'lOst 51b, with Echo as company lOst 121b'. The Flying Handicap might go to Zephyr, 8Bt, or Allspice 7st, unless.Taipo upsets the pot. ... The right of booths in the members' paddock and outside for the Autumn Meet ing of the Tasmanian Tuif Club, to be held this afternoon, were submitted privately on Tuesday, at satisfactory figures. I have paid the cpnrse a visit, and find that it is in splendid order, the late rains improving the running track, and also the. paddock and lawn, which is now coated with a fine green cloak, consequently the ^presence of the dust felt so unmistakeably ; at : the Summer Meeting . will; not be, noticed, for the most significant reason ,it won't be there.1 I may, also state that for , the con venience of, visitors from' the N.W. Coast ta. the. races a special' train will be run to Fbrmby on Sunday, returning the s'amelday. ', .,' —;,?..; * In the weights for the Fingal Steeplechase; published in our last issue, Toi Toi should have lOst 121b opposite her name not list 121b. Those who remember Tom Pickernell, who rode Malua's maternal ancestress Merry Maid and Lucifer in Tasmania 37 years ago, and afterwards as ' Mr Thomas ' won three English Grand National1 Steeplechases, will be glad to hear that he is still in the land of the living. An English paper states that, considering the falls he has had, he is wonderfully hearty and well. 'His failing eyesight,' says 'Rapier,' '.'which was al most destroyed by his last accident, is the only screw loose in his conformation, By the-by, he is the vicar's warden at King's Heath, aud is universally beloved and re spected. He always did look like a curate, ean-shaven, white-ohokered, fresh and fair.' Mick O'Brien, the popular jockey, was married to Miss Heywood, daughter of the landlord of the Turf Club Hotel, Caulfield. a few days ago, and. the pair left the same day for Sydney, where they will spend t,he honeymoon. The wedding waB very quiet. The Victorian Amateur Turf Club has re ceived a Crown grant of the Caulfield race course. W. Southall has succeeded in purchasing a good Australian horse for India, Messrs. W. C. Yiiille and Co., acting on behalf of Mr S. G. Cook,' having sold him Cyclops, for 11C0 guineas. This horse has been pur chased for Messrs. Apcar and Gaspar, who are among the formost sportsmen in India, I hope they will be 'successful with this fine son of St. Albans. Curiously enough, Cyclops has never actually won a race out right, his only winning bracket having been gained by running a dead heat with Mentor, but he has often shown real good form, and if Southall manages to get him into his best form he will prove quite equal to the occasion, for thoroughly well, he is a better horse than any at present in India. He is more reliable than Moorhouse, and weight will not stop him. By Keith's victory in the Hawkesbury Handicap his owner and trainer bagged £3000. This in a. mere flea-bite to the Tine. which would have had a rare shaking had Plutarch or Yabba got home first. The following were.the prize-winners at the Hawkesbury meeting ; — Hon. J. White, £410; Messrs.1 E.' Night, 350; J. Brown, £200; W. Kelso, £150; J. Swan £90; B. S. Sweetland, £180 ; G. Gunning, £90; W. J. Forrester, £90 ; W. Gannon, £50 ; J, Mona ghan, £40; W. Gosper25; W. Andrews, £30; H. J. Davis, E. M'Carty, J. Payten, W. Lees, T.Lamond, and J. Allsop, £10. It is reported that a commission has been sent trom America to buy either Uranbrook, Sheet Anchor, Cardigan or Carbine for stud purposes, and that a purchase will in all probability be effected. J. Robinson, the Australian jockey, has been retained by the Indian sportsmen, Messrs. Apcar, and Gaspar, at a fee of £200 per annum, with a percentage for winning mounts and the usual fee for losing. Robin son at preient is one of the most ac complished horsemen in India, and is at the same-time one of the best behaved. There cannot be a doubt that the various sons and daughters of the defunct Musket (says a N.Z. paper), will'this season again place his name at the top of the list as a winner-producing parent, for, counting in first, second, and - third moneys, they have up to- date won-, between 'them over £13,000. Ai reference ' .to 1 -last .season's statistics 'shows tb at the progeny of Musket won £12,762: while 'those : of Chester secured] £12,605. With Beveral meetings yet to come off this season, Musket's total, will, no 'doubt, be further 'considerably added to before the curtain is rung down. Writing the betting over the coming English'Derby, the Field said : — ' Years ago winter books upon the Derby were plenti ful enough, and one would have had no diffi culty in backing a dark colt like Monte Cristo. The bookmaker of the present day, however, will offer about half the price forthcoming in former times ; indeed, affairs are not cut down so fine that, with a dark colt, an owner, if he intends to specu late, fares better in waiting until some what nearer the day. The limited market just now on the Derby must be very trying to those who hare commissions to execute ; at any rate, it would be a difficult matter to invest a sum like £500 on a candidate without taking a false price to finish with.' It is rumored that £203 has been offered by an Australian buyer for the trottinc stallion Victor since the latter's disquali fication by the Lancaster Park (N.Z.) Trot ting Club. Mr Charles Westbrook, the leviathan cash better, has gone to a deal of trouble and expense in compiling a list .of the Hon: James (Vhite's winnings for the past 11 years, says the Referee. He has issued a large sheet in Mr Maclardy's best style in three colors in alphabetical order. Starting with Abercorn, it will be seen that up to January 1889 the chestnut son of Chester Cinnamon is responsible for having won £8172 18a. Then comes Aberdeen with £367, Aberfoyle £350, tome £4387, Angora £179, Bargo £3233, Bathurst £360, Blue and White 395, Carlyon £4157, Chester £844, Cranbrook £2640, Democrat £1856, Enigma £117 10s, Ensign £1707, Etna £478, Gunid £100, Hecla £719 5s, Iolanthe£1544, Kiapara £278, Lava £871, Lennox £98; Martindale £477, Martini-Henri £4751, Mascotte £327, Matchlock £3324 10s, Middlemarch £290, Monmouth £738 15s, Monte Cristo £1816, Morok £220, Morpeth ''£2190, Neophyte £157, Nordenfeldt £3225 10s, Palmyra £2100, Perfume £828, Phillip Agustus £804 10s,Pippo £398, Plutarch £1231, Rudolph £2209, Salvo £364 10s, Sapphire £957, Sege'nhoe £1815, Sinecure £464; bpice £210, Sumatra £328, Tamarisk' £714 10s; Tempe 3036\. The Pontiff £1071 lOs.Tremarido £263, Trident £8840 3s. Uralhv £4821,' Volcano £1668, Volley £4072 Is. From the list it will- be seen that 52 horses' won 179 races, the value in all beinc £86,555, 12s. Indepen dent of these facts, Mr Westbrook hoi given the whole of Chester's pefprmances while on the turf, and the ambut of his progeny's wins, which amount ? to the handsome 'sum of £34,734 4s. Then follow Hales': wins for the hon. gentleman; -In 1883-4 he won £3654 10s: 1884-5, £5503 15s; 1885:6, £9774; 1886-7, £13,194 8s; 1887-8, £16,239'; and 1888-9, £6425. Total, £54,790 13s. Alto gether, Hales has ridden' 228 times for th'e stable, and wonlOSraces.andlost'lSS During the last.six years the- Hon. James White has headed the list of winners, taking during that period the sum of £66,730,''which;d6es not include second- arid - third moneys, making a total of £11,000 per year. A's'an index to the success' of the Kirkham stable, nothing. like the list furnished' lis by1 Mr Westbrook has been published, and he is to be congratulated forthe expense and trouble he has gone to. The hunter Robert Teddington recently died in Staffordshire, aged 41 years. He was brother to Teddington, the Derby winner of 1751, and is said to have been the oldest thoroughbred existing. There is quite a craze among American jockey clubs for straightaway tracks, and no new course is considered complete with out one of these features. The threequar ters of a mile straightaway at ? Sheepshead Bay proved quite popular last year, and it is now announced that the New York Jockey Club's new track in Westchestor is to have a course similar- to that of the Coney Island Jockey Club; while the con templated new Monmouth Park is to outdo every other effort in this line with a straightaway of a mile and three fur longs. At the Sydney TattersalPs races lost Saturday the Metropolitan Stakes, of 500 sovs (one mile and three-quarters), which was won by Quicksilver, had 13 starters. All the jockeys in this event were fined £10 for disobeying the orders of the starter. The V.R.C. probably did the State good service on Wednesday (says the Argus) when it adopted the new rule about metro politan racing. At each race meeting there must now be substantial stakeB ; one or two good distance events, and no absurdly short flutters. It was well said that though there may be animals that cannot cover five furlongs at speed, these creatures are not racehorses, and should not be on a course. At the same time, by reducing the suburban radius from the iroposed 25 to 20 miles, nearly all the oona Jlde country meeting which were ikely to be crushed out have been eft upon their old footing. The rule is experimental, and its operation will need to be watched, to see whether or not it should be supplemented. But the desire exhibited for turf reform is a good thing in itself, and we may suppose mt if success is not now obtained le V.R.C. will try again. The more the matter is reflected upon, the more, probably, it will be found that tbe 'v£/wbuuj^ uvuioa abauua m u very uii terent position to that of the public course, and may need accordingly a special supervision which is not yet provided. One of these institutions is already familiarly talked of as 'a sink of in iquity,' and there always will be the danger of the proprietary course becoming a common gaming-place. Courses which Bimply bring riff-raff together, and where thegentry known in the colloquial language of the place, as ' the dark division ' and 'the knowing ones' are more than sus pected of obtaining undue advantages, are not in the interests of horse- racing, as it is desirable horse-racing should be understood by the people. Syste matic proceedings are possible upon them which could not be indulged in upon the old public-owned course, where neither the trustees nor the club had a direct interest in working at all ways of making money — suicidal ways included. The rich and re spectable companies will by no means object to stringent rules or a stringent in spection of their establishments, nor yet to their number being severely limited, for fcl-e shareholders or syndicates must know that it is only under these conditions of the sup pression of the worst that they can hope tor the survival of the fittest. The V.R.C. should still be firm . about exercising' its privilege of closing dubious courses, by ex cluding them from its calendar. The' skirt of metropolitan racing has a muddy fringe, and the cure is a'clean cut off. John Gorry, a well-known jockey, was urrtjBLeu in ueeiong lasc weeK on a warrant charging him with having deserted his illegitimate child utCasterton on 1st March, and was lodged in the local lock-up. Gorry was discovered driving the coach between Geelqng and Ocean Grove. When arrested he had in his possession a sum of £19 11s, a bank deposit receipt for £100, a silver watch, and other articles of value. It is just 100 years ago, on 28th Febru ary, 1789, that the famous racehorse Eclipse gave up the ghost. The centenary of that event suggests the reflection that in spite of all the changes of a century there is at least one English institution which remains essentially unchanged — The Turf.
