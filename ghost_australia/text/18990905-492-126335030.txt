WHBI. A GHOST. lut night tfcwugh driven mist And beating mio, Ooe came whose feet had known the path before t Tbe little lcrvo we buried stood again And sobbed beside my door. What could t do, oh foolish woman heart ! Bat draw bim in and hold him safe and warm P Why had -death loosed bim, helpless and apatt, To wander in tbe storm ? Ob, lips and bands that I hare wanted most I My arms were opened1! Be it wrong or right, Who conld tarn each a lonely little ghost Adrift into the night?
