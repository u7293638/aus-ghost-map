THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES AND PRINCESS ALEXANDRA OF DENMARK. (From the Times, March 11) Yesterday the marriage ceremony in which the Eng- lish nation feels so deep an interest was performed with fitting pomp and solemmty at Windsor. The fair Prin- cess, who landed on Saturday morning a stranger to the people, their habits and modes of thought, is now a member of our State, the partner for life of the Heir Apparent to the Throne, and, if the favorable omens under which that union was contracted be verified in the event, is destined to play a not unimportant part in the history of the Royl House of England. For the last quarter of a century we have been so favored as compared with other nations in the rule under which it is our privlege to dwell, that we have well-nigh forgotten that there can be such things as injudicious or even indifferent rulers. Lec- turers and historians, indeed dwell on the events of the Civil War and of the period before the Reform Bill, as conveying lessons both to Kings and subjects, but in practice we have fallen into the habit of thinking that what is now will always be. Yet it needs but a slight retrospective glance to discern the magnitude of the influences for good or evil which can be exercised by a single well or ill-assorted union. The example of a Sovereign nearly related to the present Monarch was as pernicious in its effects as the mild and pure influences of her sway have proved beneficial, Hence the instinc- tive interest which the nation felt in the nuptials just solemnized, and its readiness to share in what was wil- ligly accepted as a marriage of affection. From the moment of its first promulgation the proposed alliance with Denmark was decidedly popular, and the feeling in its favor was gaining day by day, till the culminating point was reached at sight of the fair face which has left home and kindred to become the adopted daughter of England. Among the Orders of Danish knighthood there is one, the ranks of which are open equally to male and female knights, and its name seems singularly applicable to the event which has taken place. Let us hope that in the happiness the Prince and Princess of Wales may mutually derive, the advantages they will each obtain from the counsels and sympathy of the other, above all, in the results of their marriage, as these will affect the nation at large, the English people may feel justified in applying to their union the title of the third Danish Order-" La Pafaite Alliance " From an early hour the loyal town of Windsor was astir. It seemed on Saturday as if all the facilities for decoration afforded by the locality had been turned to account, but in the interval the street embellishments magnified indefinitely, and some invaluable secret relating to the repair of damages must be in possession of the residents, for the triumphal arches looked as new and as bright as if there had never been any rain on Saturday or hail showers on Sunday afternoon. Numbers of well-dressed persons, armed with cards of admission, began to as- semble on Park-hill previous to 10 o'clock, and at half- past 10 there was an anxious crowd, requiring the exer- tions of a force of Coldstream Guards, Horse Guards, and police to restrain into an unbroken line. The diffi- culties of the situation were increased as vehicles which had set down their company at the entrance to the Royal Chapel, and made the circuit of the Castle internally, returned down hill again. The lines of spectators closed in after each carriage passed, and a fresh opening had to be made in every instance - a proceeding to which the public, and especially the female por- tion of the assembly, manifested great repugnance. Lines of galleries, commanding an admirable view of the route of the procession, and extending from the private grounds in front of Windsor Castle to the lron Gates, were filled with spectators, and wherever vacancies existed on these benches they did not remain unoccupied long after the arrival, about 11 o'clock, of a body of Etonians The line below the Iron Gates to the entrance to the Castle-yard was kept by the Royal Berkshire Volunteers, 580 strong;, under command of Colonel Lloyd Lindsay, V.C., and Major Sir Paul Hunter. Of this corps, which is remarkable for its steady drill and excellent attendance on important occasions, represen- tatives of every leading town in the county were pre- sent, and not a few proved their interest in the proceedings of the day by travelling forty miles in order to be present. Each member wore in his cap a rosette exhibiting the Danish colors. As half- past 11 o'clock approached, the hour named for the departure from the Castle of the first detachment of the bridal procession, all eyes turned towards the State en- trance through which the Royal carriages were expected to make their appearance. The view from the extreme end of the upper platform, commanding this entrance, was exceedingly fine. On one hand the eye ranged over the massive architecture of the Royal residence round which so many associations cluster, on the other it stretched freely over the wide expanse of private grounds declining in the distance to the level of the Home Park. At half past 11 o'clock precisely seven of the Royal carriages, with an escort of Horse Guards, left the Castle, and proceeded in the direction of St. George's Chapel. The sixth and seventh carriages, containing the brothers and sisters of her Royal Highness the Princess Alexandra, were cordially cheered on their way to the Castle, and the acclamations of the by-standers were cordially and gracefullly aknowledged. Another in- terval of waiting followed, but this is a process vastly more endurable under the bright sun and clear though frosty sky of Windsor than in the chill and murkey streets of London. The utmost good humor prevailed on all sides, and at a quarter to 12 o'clock expectation was further gratified by the issuing forth of another cortege, composed of members of the Royal family and of the Queen's household. The Royal Princesses were all loudly cheered, but more particularly the Crown Princess of Prussia, who has always been popular in her own right, but in this instance was further accepted as in some sense the repre- sentative of Her Majesty the Queen, whom circum- stances debarred from appealing publicly in the proces- sion. Her Royal Highness seemed much gratified at the warmth of the sentiments preserved towards her in her native land, and partially rose from her seat several times in acknowledgment of the public acclamations. The next departure from the Castle was the procession of the bridegroom, which left punctually at twelve o'clock. It comprised six carriages, the last containing his Royal Highness the loisiung Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and his Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Prussia, supporters of his Royal Highness the Bridegroom. HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE BRIDEGROOM The children who are educated and maintained in the schools supported by her Majesty were drawn up in front of the Castle, and cheered as loudly and shrilly as their little voices would permit when the escort leading the procession of the Bridegroom emerged from under the gate, and the cry was lustily taken up by the assembled spectators. At a quarter past twelve the procession of the Bride, shorter but more interesting than any of its predecessors, filed out in order comprising four carriages, in the last of which were His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge. His Royal Highness Prince Christian of Denmark. THE BRIDE It is neodless to add that at sight of the Princess Alexandra enthusiasm was redoubled. Her Royal Highness had not the same flush of excitement on her features which was visible on the occasion of her public entry, but she looked, if possible, more charming and winsome than on that occasion, though exhibiting faint traces of agitation in hert demeanor. ST. GEORGES CHAPEL Simple, lofty, and cold, it is difficult to light up the Nave of St George's. But the difficulty was overcome yesterday by hues and colors so rich and bright that from the floor half-way up the fluted pillars the effect was like that produced by a piece of gorgeous tapestry, or by a grand oriental carpeting hung on the walls. The Nave served as the channel and embankment of the stream which swept from the outer hall to the Chapel laden with all the pageantry of thoe great spectacle, and, returning thence, rolled lack its tide once more, bear- ing the Prince and his Bride on the swelling crest of all its pomp. The door of the western entrance, which opens into the upper part of the nave, near the Chapel, was not opened till some time after 10 o'clock. The porch and arched passage leading to it were nearly filled soon after 9 o'clock, Carriage after carriage set down its occupants every few minutes, and at last the crowd extended out- side and overlapped the narow entrance. Considering there were so many fair ladies in steel armor, the sterner sex did not fare so hardly as usual, and the crowd, if impatient or rather anxious, was decorous. The doors, which were visible above the heads of the crowd, now and then opened, and let a streak of light gleam through, and suspicions arose that some favorit- ism might influence the janitors, but the opening was too small to admit the best managed crinolines or even ordinary mankind to the coveted world beyond. At length the preparations inside were com- pleted, and the assemblage filtered through into the Nave, where the gentlemen of the Lord Cham- berlain's department and their assistants received them, and distributed the happy atoms along the scarlet benches. The front rows were reserved, the second were speedily filled, and as drift upon drift of those favored with tickets came fluttering from the doorways, each succeeding row higher and further back was occupied. When the door was finally closed at 11 o'clock there was no more room left. In the archway leading into the Nave a heavy drapery of purple silk, patterned with gold, screened the interior of the temporary hall, where the guests of the Queen were received, and Her Majesty's great officers and Royal Household assembled to form in order of proces- sion. Through rifts and openings now and then in the veil could be seen clouds of drapery and waving plumes, and glimpses could be caught of the apartments where the wedding party rested for awhile before the principal pro- cession was formed. On the pavement and black carpet with a broad cream-colored border, embroidered with the Prince's cipher and crest in alternate compartments on one side and with the Princess's on the other, was laid from the entrance to the steps leading into the Chapel. The seven lofty columns which divide the aisles from the body broke the monotonous lines of seats covered with scarlet and yellow-fringed cloth, which rose tier above tier from the narrowed fronts between the col- umns high up the walls beyond. The ladies have certainly no reason to complain of Lord Sydney, or of those to whom tickets were sent, as they exceeded by three to one, the gentlemen, the result being a much more agreeable view than if the space had contained more of the sombre colors to which the latter are very properly condemned. Many of the most dis- tinguished families and persons in the empire were represented on these benches, but we cannot give the names of such a numerous assemblage. The last of the visitors has been finally wedged into the only space left. The moving of every person in uniform up and down the Nave is marked with greater attention. By degrees the plainly dressed gentlemen, such as Mr. Spensor Ponsonby, who have been directing the arrange- ments, go off for a time to some abstruse wardrobe, and reappear glittering in blue and gold. Some walk down the Nave and go under the curtain, as if they merely sought an excuse for coming back again, though, no doubt, they transacted important business outside. Although the British Court has not a great variety of uniforms, the grades and distinctions in the different offices are so well marked by fine differences in lace lappets, embroidering of skirts, and the like, that one is scarcely apt to mistake a great man for a little one, or vice versa, if he judges solely by the general effect of the wearers dress, having regard to the general distribu- tion of the precious metals upon it. But, then, the least of officials may be carrying a very important order. What it can be is impossible to imagine, but he cannot - he ought not - to go walking up and down for nothing. Sometimes there comes out of the fast gathering crowd, whose plumes, robes, and gay ornature light up the ap- parent gloom of the choir, some fairy-like figure floating down the Nave, who is greatly agitated by a desire to see the apartments in the land, outside the curtain before the Bride and Bridegroom arrive. Sometimes a more stately body, with a more precious freight of jewels and years on board, launches out on the same voyage, and is borne there and back in safety by the ever willing and courteous pilot Chamberlains, The carpet is trodden by many feet before the Beefeaters, moving from the Chapel end of the Nave are posted in an exact line one by each pillar, and mark the course of the processions and indicate the beginning of the ceremonial. The quaintness of the dress and the absurdity of the corrupted name make us forget that the bearers of both are often stout old soldiers whose bodies are seamed with old war scars as their breasts are covered with medals, of which this much bemedelled generation of Crimea, India, China, bright with ribands of France, Sardinia, Turkey, and the War office, knows nothing. They are followed by the gold-encrusted kettle drummer, trum- peters, and the sergeant trumpeter, who take up their position at the entrance to the Nave, next the doorway. We have all seen their hunting caps and surcoats of em- broidery, silver trumpets and kettle-drums and wondrous aggregates of woven lace ; but rarely have they looked so solid and so important. And all this time, as these preli- minary movements and adjustments are going on, there are filing in singly or in groups to the Chapel the in- vited guests of the Queen and the dignitaries whose rank gives them posts of honor ; now and then, as before, still comes forth a stray visitor to the Nave. Here comes with infirm but measured step the well known figure which has been seen so often for many long years, once erect, soldierly, stalwart, strong type of the strong man who fought in the famous fields of half a century ago, and fighting still with stark courage against the inroads of time. Covered with honors, laden with years indeed, and with the honors his services have bought, who that sees this day Stapleton, Viscount Combermere, in that exact uniform, marching down the centre of the Nave in the lustrous boots, which will remind old soldiers of the scrupulous neatness for which the dashing horseman of El Bodon was distin- guished, remembers that he served in Flanders before Napoleon founded a dynasty, and in India long before the great Company had ceased to fear Tippoo, before the Mahrattas were broken, and before the power of the Sikhs was heard of ? Again some charming face, half confident, half afraid of being too late for the much-coveted private view of the realm beyond the nave, beneath a twinkling light of diamonds, and rising from some subtle millinery, trips down and gives us something to admire and talk about for a minute, till the older ladies are distracted by the appearance of some contemporary bent on the same errand, whom they criticize with unfailing good nature. It would be vain to make an attempt to describe all of this kind of incident which took place before the Nave became the scene of more interesting proceedings, short as the time was. On a sudden - far remote, indeed - are heard from the world beyond the walls the dulled bars of "God save the Queen," and as they are yet sounding nearer and nearer the purple curtain is drawn back, and there enters the Nave the procession of the ROYAL GUESTS His Highness the Maharajah Dhuleep Singh, K S I , his Serene Highness Price Edward of Saxe- Weimar, C B , his Serene Highness the Prince of Leiningen , his Serene Highness the Duke of Holstein- Glucksberg, his Royal Highness Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, her Royal Highness Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his Royal Highness Prince William of Denmark, his Royal Highness Prince Frederick of Denmark, his Royal Highness Prince Frederick of Hesse- Cassel, his Royal Highness the Count of Flanders, her Imperial and Royal Highness the Duchess of Brabant, her Royal Highness the reigning Duchess of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, her Royal Highness Princess Christian of Denmark, mother of the Bride, leading their Royal Highnesses Princess Thyra and Prince Waldemar of Denmark, the gentlemen in attendance on his Highness, the Maharajah Dhuleep Singh, Colonel Oliphant ; the equerry of his Serene Highness the Duke of Holstem-Gluksberg, Captain Haas ; the Adjutant to his Royal Highness Prince Frederic of Denmark, Capt. Lund ; the gentleman in attendance on his Royal Highness Prince William of Denmark, the Chamberlain to his Royal Highness Prince Frederic of Hesse, Monsieur de Oertzen, head of his Royal Highness's household, Mons. de Koepstorff ; extra Equerry to the Queen in attendance on his Royal Highness Prince Fredrick of Hesse, and on his Serene Highness the Duke of Holstein-Glucksburg, Colonel Du Plat ; Gentleman in attendance on his Royal Highness the Count of Flanders, Major Burnell, Lady and Gentleman in attendance on her Imperial and Royal Highness the Duchess of Brabant, the Countess d'Yve, the Count de Lannoy ; Equerry to the Queen in attendance on his Royal Highness the Count of Flanders, and on her Im- perial and Royal Highness the Duchess of Brabant, Major-General the Hon. Alexander N. Hood, Groom- in-Waiting to the Queen, in attendance on her Royal Highness Princess Christian of Denmark,Colonol Francis Seymour, C B The representative of the glories of the Khalsa, the descendent of the Lion of Lahore, is resplendent in cloth of gold kirkob, with collar of pears and sheen of yellow satin ; and it is strange to see him here among the fair- haired Norsemen and Teutons whose boldest adven- tures had never led them within half the world's circumference of the land we have made our own ; but, without offence to the distinguished throng, it may be said it is in the nature of this day that the greatest attention shall be attracted by the mother, the young sisters and brothers of the Bride, who are received with such deference as could be shown to them by the assemblage. The Teutonic names suggest some curious reflections to the man who remembers who were our friends and foes in the old days of Marlborough, and must give him increased confidence, if any increase were needed, in the stat of England. But where do Brabant and Denmark carry us ? There is many an ancient schloss in the much-vexed land betwixt the Scheldt and the Danube and the Elbe, where grim portraits of armored men frown on the walls, that would almost crumble to pieces with dismay if they could hear that peacefully and 1,1 indi} down thu nu\ e of the Chapel of &t; George were marching m procession to seo a dnughtei of Denium k wedded to tho son of Ln"lnnd, the represent itivcs and suions of house» that had boen boi n aud bred and died in b ittle with our houses Lut let us sec m this wedding m ireh an nugmy of union and strength arnon,, the races which have boen the champions of our faith, mid who can fitlj meet ni the Chapel of St George Tholast of the piocessum was the Queen's "nest» in which iniirchod Pnuco Edward of Soxo Weimai, who fought in our ranks at Inkoi mann was closed by Colonel Seymour, who stood new nt hand m that torublo press of men '1 hoy all p used in to the Chapel-a bhue of D inish, and Prussian, and Bolgian, uni Ccimnu gi con nnd blue, picked out vwth English scurlot and as the list of them melted awuy into the dattening ¡,low of the liinei building the strains of "Gist save tho Queen sounded yet Jondol and neaici, and the cheers of the people outside caine throuL.li stone and glass, and stuie 1 up the J*ave It was just 12 o clock Hie music outside mid tho jubilation ceased, and there was taloneo fot a little while-such silouco as there is m a treat fotest when all that meets the eat is the gentle murnini of tho lo ives funned lightly by tho creeping mr Then onco more, ona sudden, that purplo eui tain was thrown open tho ti umpets blared forth a silvery peal to the roll of the kettle di urns, and facing to the Chape], two mid two, follow ed by pursuivants and heralds lu tabards of office, i ivcred with golden devices, for tho delight of all who boliovo thore is somo thing of goodness m ancient olisemuioe, usage, and remembrance, the) uni ched slowly towards the Chapel entrance up the Navo i hoy headed lioio the second and the great procession of tho Rojal Fannlj and of the Queen s Houseliul 1 It was thus composed - Di unis and rvumpots Sergeant Trumpeter Pursuivant and Heralds Iho Eqiiony m AVmtiug, Hie Olotk Marshal, Majoi Gen 1 H G Se) inouï The Lord Afad Paget Tho Controller of the The Treasurer of the Household, Household, The Lord Proby Tho Viscount Bui y 'Hie Keepei of tho Pi ivy Purse, Colonel the Hon bu Citarles B Phipps, KX B The Gloom in Wuitinc,, Tho Lord m Waiting, The Hon Mnitintet The Lord Caniovs Sackville West Hie Loid Steward, the Kail of St Germans, GOB Norroy King of Anns Claienccux King of Anns Gentleman Gat ter King of Gentleman Usher, Aims, Ushor Lt Gen ian F Smith SirCGYoung SirW Mnrtius Deputy Eutl Marshal,the Lord Edward ïitzalanHowird.

No bridal favours are worn on such an occasion of state dress, but, as a kind of amende for this necessary omission, where the collars of the orders of knighthood are displayed they are in every case looped at the shoulders with bows of white satin riband, which answers the purpose eqally well. Now that the Choir is almost full, tho the predominance of mauve and violet colours is more marked than ever,-- in fact, few other tints are shown, except when ladies who fear the cold keep their white burn ouses, which all without exception have, still wrapped about their shoulders. The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress are among the late arrivals. His Lordship wears his robes of state, which without being over gaudy. make a rich addition even to the mass of uniforms and gorgeous dresses around. Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli are also among tho last comers, The leader in the Commons of tho Opposition wears his Windsor uniform, and is seated with Mrs Disraeli, who is radiant with diamonds, on the left, immediately inside tho Choir. The Speaker of tho House of Commons also comes attired in state, with Lady Charlotte Denison, and then nearly all the places are filled It is n quaitci to 12, and there is a short hush of ex- pectation-one of those periods of unaccountable silence which alua)s fall at inteivals even upon the most eiowdcdaniiunimtvtcd assemblies The Usliu of th» Black Rod, Sit Augustus Clifford enters, and then then» is aiiothei pauso, thntis qnieklv broken b) a loud hum of admiration in the Nave, which tho more stately awl select giitheiing in the Chou mil) notice b) increased tigidity of upiightness till the cause of the niiirmui is itiiulo known b) tho nppcamncotil the ontranco of tho Knights of the Gai tci all tobed and jewelled in their almost reg ti costumo, and ho tiled bv the Piemiei him- self Ihoj mako a noble and a gallant show as they sweop up the Chon like a procession of monarch», with thou long v olvot mantles of Imponul blue, looped at the shoulders with white nbnnd, traihug aftui them Lord Palmerston piocoeds at oucotohisstalT on the loft, whet o hois joined by Ladj Pahnei ston and thoothers.af tel waiting for a single second m a statoly group, pas« also to their soats The l'toniior »as, of couiso, the most obsorvtd of all, as ho stopped up lightly into lus seat and looked lound lum with a busk jo\ nility, as if ¿bout to quell a tioublosomo mombei, or evade bj a most voluminous reply an awkward quostiou Tlio Duke o Nowcastlo, Larl Granville, Etui Clarendon, anil Eui Russell aro tho most noticed of tho rest nud the latter, whon once ho sit« in his wide, high, ample stall is almost lost to viou lho othot kiii0hU »ho take part in tins splendid ceremony are tho Duke of Buccleuch, th» Marquis Camden tho Marquis ot Westminster, th» Duke of Devonshire, the Duke uf Somerset, tho Earl ofHaiiowb} tho Duke of Wellington, the Mamu!« of Normanbj, thoMirqui« of Abotcoin tho Miiiqui» of S lindum, and two jimioi knight«, the Earl of Shaftes/. bin v and Lui ritzwilliam, who a« juniors, in kutglit* hood nt lca«t, sit furthest awti) from the Sovereign.'» stall, mid thus, as it huppen», ne nest to tho Sovuloigu'» placo on this occasion Aftet all tho kiiijit« uro seated, the Lotd Chanoollor, in lu« stato lobes, mid curving the Gi oat St al, pasies slowl v anil stately up tho Choir-alone, but a perfect pageant in himself-to his scat nt the head of all It u non n qui)tu I 112 and the Aulibishiip of Clink rlwrr outer«, followed by tho Bishop of Loudon attending a« Dean uf tho Chapels Royal, the Bishop of Oxford as Cliancolloi of tho Ordoi of thuGurtoi the Bishop of Wmchestoi, as it« Prelate, the Bishop of Chostet, a» Cloik of thu Closet uni tho De m ofWmdsni, as Ilcgistmi of tho Oidci of the (nutu with tho Cannu« anil Minoi Canon» of tho Chapel Tho suffragan Bishojis stand asido as tho dais i« t e ichetl, anti make wav foi tho Pinnate, who pisses at o»co to thu not tit of thu altin, and tho Dean, robed m scailet, »tth tho Canon* take then places to tho south For a minuto tho Prolatos knool tu projet, then use and stand in lina inside tho rails 'lhon thom is u slight rustle of silk« nud clinking of jewelled orders ns,nearly the whole Corps Diplomatique como in und take their places underneath the Royal pew "i-ahowing literally like a cluitor of gold and j'owels, that .- equals even the appearance of tlio Knights of tho Garter. And now thoro is a long and soloinn pause, during which oven whispers are audible, and the rustle of the dresses comes with a noise as their fair wearers turn to survey the scene around, where " Lords, ladies, captains, councillors, and priests, " Their choice nobility and flowci j "Bmlocsslfs, from iculnus far icmote, in various habits, " Met from all parts to celebrate the day." It is in truth a scone of such stately pomp and royal cu-cumstnnco as few have ovor Been before, where the noblest by birth and intellect, the greatest and most revered in power, aro all assombled within the narrow precincts of this grand old Choir, Uko the treasures of the nation in their carved onk casket. Suddenly there is just a perceptible movement-a kind ofVionsciousuess that something lins occurred which tells at'once that the Queen is either coming or has come, and all eyes are quietly directed towards the quaint old jiew in the wall. In another instant the Queen hersolf appears, nccomiranied by HisRoyal High- ness, tho Duko of Saxo-Coburg and Gotha, tho brother of the late Prince, and tis we nil know, so like liim as to moke the resemblance almost startling as he stands by tho side of Her Maj'esty. Tlio Queen wears the .implcst and plainest of widow's weeds-a widow's cap, a black silk dress with whito collar and cuffs, and black gloves. The only colors which appear upon her are the star of the Order of the Garter, and its blue ribband, narrowed to the width Her Maj'esty usually wears, across her left shoulder. She looks well in health, but thinner and older, with the pennancnt traces of deep grief and care stamped on everv lineament of her features. She stands at tho window of the Royal pew, a little withdrawn from general gozo, and only to be seen at all hy those on the opposite side of the Choir glancing quietly into the intonor, whilo tho Duke of Saxe-Cnburg »peaks, and apparently explains to ,lier the arrangements going on below for the great ceremony which lins drawn her forth from her mourning and seclusion. After ti few minutes she seats herself a little away from the window, mid the Duko retires, the Hon. Mr*. R. Bruce, elad, like the Queen, in deep mourning, taking his place. It is 12 o'clock, and the noise of cheering can be heard outside, and then a pause, broken after a few minutes by tho great nistle_and peculiar hum which tho great mnss of visitors in tho Nave make on rising. The first of the three processions is nt limul, hut. no one moves in the Choir till tlio glittering file is seen, headed by heralds and great officers of State, coining rank in rank in stately order, filing ' off to the right and loft as they enter, the Choir, till they roach the dais, which none but tho most illustrious may ascend. Dhuleep Singh, with Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar and th« Prince of Leiningen, in his uniform as captain. in tho English navy, head the lino of Royal guests, but it is on tile sister of the brido, the lovely Princess Dagmar of Denmark, followed," by her Royal mother, in leading each hand the Princess Thyra mid Prince Waldemar, that all looks are centered as with «lately step they slowly pass up the contre. Tho Princess Christian is richly yer simply dressed, and only a feather and a fow flower« are' mixed with the thick clusters of her auburn hair. All as they reached the dais turn and mnko a deep and reverend obeisauce to Hor Maj'esty, and then pass ou to the scats on tho south of the altar. Hardly are they placed in order when tho cheers from without the building como loud and clear, with a sound that is almost noisn ainiiltliatstatelypoinp and quiet,aml the strains of tho bunds playing the NiitionalAiithom can bo distinctly heard heralding tho jirogress of tho pro- cession of tlio Royal family. There is tho usual slight delay whilo it is marshalled in the temporary apart- ments, mid then tho trumpets burst forth tis it enters the buildiug. Officers of the household, pursuivants nnd heralds lead tho way us before, halting and making a doublo line below tho dais, while tho Princess Mary of Cam- bridge, hor magnificent train borne by Lady EdithSouier >ot, moves up the choir with the most stately grace. At the dais hor attendant pauses, and she turns to gather hor train over hor mm, aud, moving to the ceutro,niakes u profound courtesy to,Her Maj'esty; thou passes at onco to her place ou tho north of tho nltur, in front of and just beneath thoso treasures of ironwork tho gates of Quintin Matsys.. As sho passes in the Duchess of Cambridge follows, with liko state and ceremony, and thon tho Princess 'Beatrice, Princess Louise, and Princess Helena ascend in turn, followed by tho Princes Arthur and LcojKild, tho lattor in Highland dresses of the Royal tartan. All bow and courtesy deeply to the Queou, and tim Princess Helena, who wears a train, gathers hera on her arm Uko tho rest, and seats herself near tho Duchess of Cambridge. The next is the Princess Alice, wearing aTiiohlo coronet of brilliants, who pays the same deep reverence'to her mother us all the rest ; then the Princess Royal, looking as young, its amiable, und os timid tis when, with slow stei>s,she her- solf was led to tho altar nt tho Chapel Royal, but this time lending by tho limul afino little hoy,whi>nll uiiawcd by the stately pomp uround.draggoil on Ids mother's, arm ashelonkcd behind him uttliopageant.midwithdifficulty brought his little feet to surmount tho three steps of the hmtt ¡ma. All havo l ¡sen as they enter, and tho Queen now rises too, and bows to her daughter witli a kind and whining smilo-tho first that has passed across hor fuco since silo entered tho Chapel. Beothoven's noble march has boon played its they filed in, but, us may bo guessed, its strains, though beautifully rundercd,are but little attended to in stich a scene ns this. The Queen has evidently found an object which moro deeply interests her, anil instead of seating herself again she remains at the closet window, watching hor Royal children as they jiass olio after another to thoir scats beneath, and evon when they aro seated silo leans ovor tho front mid rcmiiiiisgaziug down nt thom steadily with nu expression of fond pride which is unmistakable, mid in which no traco of grief can bo discovered now. Again the cheers como louder and more sustained than over from tlio outside ; again there is the sumo puaso, broken by tho trumpets and rattling kettle drums in tho Nave, mid this timo all savo tho Queen herself rise mid remain standing respectfully, for it is tho Bridegroom that approaches. Great officers precedo bim, but tiley aro little heeded ; all nyes .aro turned up- on tho Prince of Wales, who, in his uniform of General, hut wearing over all tho insignia and purple muutie of n Knight of the Garter, comes slowly up the Choir, jiartly accompanied, partly followed, by his brother-in-law, tho Prince of Prussia, and his undo, tho Duko of Snxo Co- burg, similarly robed. Tho Wedding Mareil is played ns they move up with stately «use, and the Queou rises and romes fully forward as (ho haut jms is reached, and tlio three uscend mid turn in lino towards her, bowing deeply, The Duko of Saxo Coburg and the Princo of Prussia retire to tlio south sido of tho aitar, and the Bridegroom, after kneeling a few seconds in prayor, rises and stands " thu roso anil expectancy of this fair Stale," in the centre of t\io haut juu,aluua,mth his face towards tho Queen. Such nu occasion is one in which fow mon appear to Mltftutngo ; yet tho Princo gains by passing through it. iyÛj). tho easy grace that scorns natural to nil his actions lie stwd alone, tho watched and observed of all tho observers, neither bashful uni' confident, but with a manly Royal bearing that beenmo his illustrious birth aud exalted station. Ho looked round upon tho splen itiil scene {or a moment quietly and easily ; mid his every Moyumeut, his look, his very Soaring, seoiied in thoir yiyid ? likeness to hi« Boyal father to impress and ¿iijaze all-oyen those who by thoir rank mid sta- tion might bo supposed to bo tho most familiar With his features. As tho sound of cheering was heard without, marking the coming of his youthful Bride, ho kopt turning his head every moment, for from where bo stood, in the centre of tho altar, he could see through the screen mid down thu Nuve beyond to where the crimson curtains would hide tho marshal liug of the Bride's procession. Often lind often did ho glance this way, but tho curtains wero motionless, mid gava no sign of tlio coming forth of her whom all now watched for with such eager expectation that tho sus- penso even of the slight delay seemed almost painful. Still he stood nlono, and, "though uvidotttly kconly anxious for the coming of his young Bride, ho "boro thu eager sciaitinv of all,with a quit cuso that was charming \- his youth, his face, his figure, all bringing irresistibly heforo tho mind tho lines, .' Slm|icil in proportion fair " Blue was lils piercing eye, " Ami auimrii «f the richest t!yo . " Ills short moustache and hair." At last, with n great clangor of trumpets, which nt first aro muffled into a rich indistinctness behind the cur- tains, the longlooked-for procession of tho Bride ontors, and tho Princo, giving ouo look to satisfy himself of tho fact of tho arrival, keeps his oyos fixed upon tho Queen, »ud never turns his head again till his nttianced stands beside him. The hush was now so deep mid breathless that even tho restless glitter of the jewah that twinkled every- where seemed almost to break it, mid, despito the stately etiquette which hail iiithorto regulated every word and Î ¡enture, all now lient far and eagerly forward as tho mm and rustió in the Nave beyond showed tho youug Bride to be drawing near. In another minuto she had «literal, mid stood ,. 'In gloss of salin awl glimmer ol pearls, "Queen lily and rose in une," the fairest and almost the youngest of all her lovely train that'bloomed in fair unity behind her. Though not agitated, sho appeared nervous, and tho soft, delicate bloom of color which ordinarily imparts a look of joyous happiness to her expressive features, had ¡ill but disappeared as, with head bout down, but glancing hor oyos occasionally from sido to side, sho moved slowly up towards tho altar. Tho pnigrammo tolls us that sho was supportod on the right by her royal father, Prince Christum of Doniiinik, mid on hor loft by tho Duke of Cambridge, and the samo dry but most authentic document leads us to beliuvo that both were in full uniform, and wore tho collars and badges of their respective orders of knighthood. But, without wishing at nil to doreguto from the importance of these illiistrioiifl .personages, vyo may say that any ono elso ?night have safely borne their part, sodoep, so all sbsorbing, was the interest with which the Bride, «ml the Bride nlono, wits watched. From tho way lier features aro now shaded by the veil, and her looks bent forward, it is difficult to soo lier features moro fully, hut ns sho near« tho altar she drops her arm,and for tho first time appears hoiicnth the fold« of her veil a largo lmuquot of orango flowers carried in a princely gift from tho Maharajah Dhulecp On theso occasions, wo beliovo, tho dross of the brido ranks in general estimation ns only second in ¡mportniico to the colouration of the coroinony itself, which is to lie regretted, for a lady's dress, uko a lady's lieauty, eau «inly lie described by its offect. It is embroidered whito silk, trimmed with silver, which can just bo discerned in rich dosigns glittoring between tho snowy fold«. Tho traditional white is not, hnwover, departed from, though «ivor all sho wears a «light boddico with open »loeve« of »hito silk, embroidered with «¡Iver, and which, falliug tight, set« off her tapering waist and faultless «yniinotry of form to absolute perfection. Her gorgeous train of whito mid silver is homo by eight young ladies, botweon tho ngos of 15 and 21), tho very .choice and flower of the fair scions of our most ancient holisus. Tho young ludion thus honored with so fair a 'post in the long programma of this happy day aro all tho daughters of Dukes, Miirquisos, or Earls whoso title« aro almost as familiar ns tho names of our Kings of old. They wero Lady Victoria Alexandria Montagu Douglas Scott, daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch j Lady Theodora .(irosvonor, daughter of tho Marquis of Westminster; Lady Diana lleaiißicik, daughter of tho Duko of St. ' Albans ; Lady Elma Brace, daughter of the Earl of Elgin: Lady Victoria Hare, sister of the Earl of Listowell ; Lady Agneta Yorke, daughter of tho Earl of Hardwicke; Lady VictoriaAloxanilriiiaElioibethCamp "lieu, daughter of"tim Earl of Cawdor; Lady Constnuco Villiers, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon; Lady Ernestine Emma Horatia Mount-Edgecumbe, daughter of the Earl of Mouut-Edgocumbe ; and Lady Feodorowna Cecilia Wellesley, daughter of Earl Cowley. It is quito superfluous to say how they looked, as, robed in snowy white, and wrapped in veils, they fol- lowed their Royal mistress with soft footsteps, though, as they woro not going to bo married, they seemed to think themselves relieved from the necessity of looking on the ground, and glanced about and turned to one and another, and matte believe to look as if they did not know and hear that thoy commanded almost their full tributo of admiration, evon behind such a lady in such a sceno as this. Imagination must draw their pictures, for words would fail to paint them. Their dresses woro nil of white-a wonderful mixturo of silk and lace that made them seem ethereal in their light- ness, as partly wrapped in long soft veils thoy passed as noiselessly as a vision which cannot bo forgotten or described. Lady Georgina Hamilton, daughter of tho Marquis of Abercorn, who was originally intended to form one of the lovely train, but was unfortunately pre- vented by ¡udisposition, which, though not «overo in character, was sufficient to prevent her attendance now. Slowly the Bride reaches the haut pas. and as she stops to bow to the Queen some of her fair attendants, who aro apparently oven more nervous than herself, at- tempt to kneel, but, finding their mistake, rise quickly and move on as if they did not mean it. Then, and then only, does the Prince turn, as if to receive her, but checks himself as he sees them all bowing to the Queen, mid for the first mid only timo he seems irresolute as to whnt ho ought to do. The long keon scrutiny seem« to have disturbed his composure at last, though only for a second, and the Anthem ceases, and nil retire a little apart while the Bride and Bridegroom nro left standing in the middle of the hunt pas, the latter alone, tlio fonner, of course, closely surrounded by her attendant bridesmaids, so closely, indeed, that in that gorgeous moss of scarlet and purple and gold they were the only group on which the eye could tura with a foeling like rest from the surrounding glitter. Handel's inarch from Joseph hnd been played nt entering, hut all music hod ceased as tho party stood around the altar, till its strains broke out with the solemn words of the chorale : " This day, with Joyful heart and voice "To Heav'u be noseda nation's pray'r: 11 Almighty Father, delan to grant "Thy blessing to the wedded pair. . , " So shall no clouds of sorrow dim " The sunshine of their early days, ' But happiness in endless round * ? x " Shall still encoinpasB all their ways." \ * The exquisitely soft music of this chant, at once solemn and sorrowful, was composed by the late Princo Consort. It may have boen this, or the associations and lifelong memories called up hy the scene beneath her, but certain it. is that as the hymn commenced Her Majesty drew back frem the window of the pew, and, after an effort to conceal her emotion, gave way to her tears nnd almost sobbed, nor did she throughout the rest of tho ceremony entirely recover her composure. The bridal party saw nothing of this ;,the Bride's face was luntod from the pew, and the 'Queen was with- drawn too much from the front for the Prince to seo her, though his looks were often turned in that direc- tion. As tho solemn chant ended, tho Prelates advanced to tho communion rails, and the Primate, in a rich clear voice, which was heard throughout every part of the building, Choir, or Nave, uommenced the service with the usual fotmulary, "Dearly beloved, wo are gathered together hore in the sight of God, and ia thej foco; of this congregation to j'oin together this man mid this woman in holy matrimony." There is a solemn puuso after that dreadful adjuration in which they are charged to answer if there was any impediment to their marriage, aud then, nftor a moment, the Primatu passed on to " Wilt thou, Albert Edward, have this woman to thy wedded wife, to livo together aftor God's ordinance in the holy estate of matriineny ? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her, in sicknoss and in health ; nnd, forsaking all other, keep theo only unto her, so long as yo both shall live?" To this tho Princo rather bowed than responded, his utterance was so indistinct. To tho same question " Wilt thou, Alexandra Caroline Maria, have this man to thy wedded husband ?" tho reply wa« just audible, but nothing more, though, as usual, ovety car was strained to catch it. But to the wonls,-" I take theo, Alexandra, to my wedded wifo, to have and to hold from this day forward, for bettor for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness nuil in health, to love and to cherish; till death tis do part, according to God's holy ordinance; mid thereto 1 plight thoo my troth," the Prince repeated clearly word for word after his Grace, though now, again, when it was tho turu of tho young Bride, she could bo heard ouly to answer almostinaudibly, and her cheeks were suffused with a crimson flush, and she seemed very nervous. To tho question "Who givoth this Woman to bo married to this Man," tho Roj'nl fathor of tho Bride only bowed and moved towards tho Princes.«, who was removing her glovo hurriedly. Thou the Primate joined their hands, and in a clear, soft voice, firmly and deli- berately repented the wonls : " With this ring I theo wed, with my body I thoo worship, and with all my worldly goods 1 theo endow, in the ñamo of the Father, of tho Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." All thou knolt down vvhilo tho prayer commencing " O Eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all mankind, Giver of all spiritual grace, the Author of everlasting lifo; send Thy blessing upon thoso Thy ser- vants, this man and this woman, whom wo bless in Thy name," was solemnly repeated, and then thoy rose, while the Primate joined their hands and said the final words " Those whom God hath joined together, let no mau put asunder." ? .' With tlieho words, which in law comploted tho murringo ceremony, tho set vico wn« continued to the 67th Psalm, tho .solemn strains of which caine like a relief to what soonicd almost the overwrought feelings of all within tho Choir as the »ords went pealing softly through both Nnvo and Aisle ¡ "Blessed ure all they that fear the Lord; mut walk in Hi.« ways. " For thou shalt eat the labor of thino hands : O well is thee, mid happv shalt thou be. "Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vino: upon .the walls of thino house. "Thy children like tho olive-branches : round about thy tnblo. " Lo, thus shall the man be blessed : that fearoth tho Lord. " The Lord from out of Won shall so hie.«« thee : that thoa shalt sec Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long ; " Yea, that thou shalt seo thy children's children ; mid peace upon Israel. " Glory bo to the Father, anti to tho Son, and to tho Holy Ghost; "As it was in tho beginning, is now, nnd over shall be : world without end. Amen." Then »as continued the usual pmyoranil oxhoiiatlon, during winch the guns in tho Long Walk were heanl booming forth, and tho steeples throughout the town seemed to fill tho air with sound. Misled for a moment, the Queen's band begun tuning their instrument.«, mid oven the organ gave one or two involuntary spirts nnd whistle.«, tis if anxious to lead in the ruco of harmony. It was- promiiture, however, anti there was a gentío hush, which restored the for- mer silence, when thu Primate wits heard con- cluding tho exhortation. Thon; raising his voico, he solemnly pronounced the benediction, during which the Queen, who had been moro deeply affected, knelt and buried her face in her handkerchief. The Bride mid Bridegroom then joined hands, and turning tu the Queen, gtivo moro a nod of kindly friendship titan a Imw of State, which the Queen returned in kind. lu another minuto tho Queen, giving a similar greoting to tho Princess, quitted the closet, and the wholo pageant went pouring ¡u a gorgeous stream or Hood of colors, of waving plumes, and flaming jowols, out of tlio Choir, ii one can toll hut those who wera present, how grand .mid aoloiitr. was the whole coremony.or with how much deep hope anti true devotion the marriage of the second Princo of Wales was celebrated in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. As thoy left tho Choir, tho organ mid thu baud went pealing forth tho Hallelujah of Beethoven : " Hallelujah to the rather "And the Sun of God, " Praise the Í.Ttl. ye cvcrlatting cliol-, lu holy songs of joy "World» unborn shall slug His glory, " The exalted S n ot God." Whilo the ceremony wa« going forward within tho Chapel,uothing remained for tlio spectators without but to wait patiently the return of the Procession. ..Thoso whoso tickets enabled thom to avail thenisolvcs of that privilege took the opportunity of visiting ' the court vnnl, from which nu entrance leads to St. Georgo's bhapol. Within this enclosure, whoro the carriages sot down and took up their occupants, a guard of honor was stationed, and tho baud of the Grenadier .Gunnia, initier the leadership of Mr. Godfrej', wa« also placed at this point. For the first time after an interval of 15 month», tho walls of the Ctuttlo re- sounded with .military .music. On tho arrival ol' the first and second processions the Danish airs''Sangfor Flaaden" ("Song of tho Navy"), and " Don TapporLandsoldat" (" The Bravo Land-soldior"), were performed; and tho Prince*) Alexandra was re- ceived with the Dauish anthem "King Christian."
