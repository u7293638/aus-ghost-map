The Window. ;< A great deal depends upon the kind of lookout one has into the world, HARPER'S BAZAAR says, beyond the fireside, -whether one is grave or gay, contented ot dissatisfied, poetical or praotioal. The -window, in faot, has more or less influence upon those to whom ; it affords a mental escape from workaday affairs upon their well-doing and their growth. A green hill-Bide, or a pine grove upon which the eye may rest in pauses of work, is a mental stimulus ; it carries the mind away from sordid things into realms of fairyland j it soothes the weariness of body and soul, and makes tho narrow world stretch out mto infini tude; or, given a bit of water view where now and then a sail flits by like a quiet ghost, or a sturgeon leaps with all its Beales guttering in the sun, where the shadows of the trees and- shore are daily painted on its surface, and what a relief it furnishes to the overstocked brain or heart, what a chance to drop the (burden of worry and anxiety, and let one's thoughts drift out with the tide into remote regions of poetry and romance ! The val"e of those pictures that the window offers us can hardly be estimated ; one is un aware how subtle and how sure their power is, nor how far-reaching and developing,' how, day by day, they add their atom to the beautiful mosaic of cha racter. " Ye were but little at the first, but mighty at the last." We adorn our walls with the works of the great and lesser masters, but these pictures which may be had for nothing, whioh are retouched every day and hour by a master hand, never wearying us with their monotony, nor aggressive with their beauty, are too often disregarded-by us¿r Probably half the people in the world would find difficulty in reporting the view from their own windows, simply beoause they have never thought about it, and there are many to whom the window is but a loophole warranted to admit light and air, who neverregard it as a spiritual aid ; people who believe it was designed to show them what their neighbors are 'doing or Wearing j and there are yet others who seem to think it was in vented in order to be safely blindfolded that the Bun may not fade their carpets or hangings. ¿The window ÍB like tho face of à friend ; it haB the same general outlines at all times, but the expression'varies with the mood of the hour and the weather; we feel a bom-, panionship with all it offers to our gaze, associated as it is with our daily life, our pains and pleasures,; our hopes and fears ; it relates our petty lives with the immensity; of nature,, which is; perhaps capable of lending them something largo and generous,, some virtues that we might not else have made our own, something of beauty to soften the asperities of every day living and thinking.
