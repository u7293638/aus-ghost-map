OUR LATE LIEUT.-GOVERNOR WE cannot withold from expressing our admiration, at the unfeigned respect so sincerely evinced by the people attending his honored corse to its present resting place. No man that we have read of in colonial history, was ever so sacrificed by his own good nature and credulity, and the opprobius venality of those who were planning his ruiu, even deserted on his death-bed by those who, i'rom common duty and respect, ought to have aitended him—no-feelling " CROMWELL" attended bis ruined master to ofi'er up his prayers—shame—shame— on bucli base imitations of the human form. We are in possession of several instances, iu which, through base advice, he had erred to the prejudice of more than one ind< vidual, but which, ou discovery, he as hastily and anxiously sought to remedy and redress, proving the goodness of his heart, aud that be had a mind open to conviction. His moral character so basely calumniated by interested hypocrites, lo those unwise and cruel authorities at honii', with all the chicenery and scrupulous enquiries has never yet been attainted during his stay in the colony—and where is the man or woman who has yet dared to impeach it—it is far beyond OUT humble abilities to sufficiently enlogize his worth and character In his native country, so ably as was described by a minister, (who knew him in his own country) in a funeral sermon to tbat worthy sect the " INDEPENDENTS" of this city, who, with a due sense of his worth, have subscribed to a testimonial of his character, as a man and a christian during his Colonial Administration, for the satisfaction of his relations and friends in England. And we hope it will afford a little consolation Jo his three worthy sons now in this colony* the high estimation in which aiI our citizens held their beloved father, wh6se spirit we hope has fled to those realms of bliss, beyond the reach of his cowardly enemies The ghost of Julius Ceasar met his mur* derers at Phillippi.
