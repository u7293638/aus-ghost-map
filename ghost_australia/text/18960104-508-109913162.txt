Company, Sydney, \ Nt^P^^I P'^ Melbourne, &c.; - ^-.Jii^P^P This is No. 1 of the /M@S«K\v 1 ' 'Warr&al; Series,' ^^^»JM . a title which, as ta Tfo^F^jgj T^fcJ riginal vocabulary, H Ws^?i|t»^i— ^ not inappropriate vVfiWel&OSs;^ &u; connection with publications which, like, the opening one, are to be dis tSmctively Austra lian. It is got up in very nice style, and in 43iat respect wffl compare fa vorably with similar books issued by noted houses in the old country. The name which Mr. Fayenc has chosen for his story has, as lie explains in the preface, been suggest ed by certain facts which have been, made known concerning a tribe of blacks in the interior of this country. They have, it ap pears, a skill superior to that of all the other representatives of their race with re gard to tuo construction of their weapons, and they also employ peculiar signs which, resemble hieroglyphic writing. But what specially distinguishes them is that they are thft only blacks in Australia who wear a kind of 'shoes on their feet There are two theories as to their use. One is that they are worn by the blacks when making steal thy* approaches on their enemies. The other is that they are part of the stockin tra-le of native wizards — 'rain-makers.' Bota theories would seem to 'have been in corporated in the narrative under notice. These shoes, it may be added, are fashioned in a manner which may be described as real ly artistic. The material is of the strangest natiire— the upper part woven of hu man iiair, the soles made of 017 grass mix ed with human blood. It will, of course, need no very extraordinary sagacity to at once divine that 'The Mocassins of Si lence' must be a tale in which there is something fateful and mysterious. And such, indeed, is the fact. Two white men, fa.r in the depth of Australia, are -witnesses of a weird incantation scene, in which a number of blacks are the actors. The white men are discovered, and have to fight for their lives. A hideous looking black, who had taken the principal part in the awesome rites, is among the slain. Near Iiis dead body, the 'mocassins of silence' are found. Ere he had given up the ghost he had uttered a fearful iniprecation, boding death to the future wearer of the blood stained shoes. It would not be fair to tell exactly how this sinister prediction is veri fied. It will be enough to say that the curse is ultimately fulfilled, on a woman, and that the circumstances which lead up to the catastrophe involve much of love and jealousy. A fascinating, but unscrupulous adventuress and an innocent girl are the rival fair ones. Pearl fishing incidents, and quests after treasures, the secret of which is supposed to be known only to a missing ?man, are matters which also have a place in Mr. Favenc's book. 'The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible,' by John Clifford. London: James CJarke and Company, 1S95.— The object of the writer of this book has been, as he Irin^self states, to remove as far as possible the difficulties by which students of the 'Scriptures are most apt to be beset, par ticularly youthful students. That his efforts in that direction have met with some suc cess is to be inferred from the fact that his work has now reached a second edition. The 'Windsor Magazine' for November opens with an article on the Lord Chamber lain, that Court functionary who, among his other duties, is supposed to supervise all pieces which are intended to be performed on the stage, which task, however, he usual ly delegates to another official— the Examin er of Plays. Among the illustrations to the article is a portrait of Lord Garrington, who, it will be remembered, is an ex-Lord Chamberlain. The story of 'The Grey Dady'r is concluded, as also is Mr. Guy Boothby's story of 'A Bid for Fortune.' There is another tale by Mr. Boothby, a short one, in the number. 'On and Off the Turf In Australia,' by Nat Gould. London: George Routiedge and Sods, 1895.— In this book the well-known sporting writer gives an interesting account of his varied experiences in this part of the world. He speaks in a very kindly spirit of the Australiam people, and of the country in. which, as ne says, he spent ten of the happiest years of his life.
