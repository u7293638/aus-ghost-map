®o£s' ffolumitt The Ghost* About the year 18501 was on one of our English India ships bound from Boston to Caloutta, We arrived off the Capo of Good Hope with fair weather to that point, but every one was on the lookout now for a blow from some quarter, The pervious evening one of the lookouts during the midwatoh had insisted ho had seen the Flying Dutchman, and every one knows that whon that is the caso a blow or bad weather in some shape is sure to come, And como it did with a vengeance, for tho very next night tho wind died down to a calm, then suddenly jumped out from the nor'west butt-end first, Six of tlio old tars wont tumbling up the weather main rigging, and were urged on by the gruff voice of the second mate, a thorough old sea-dog, who sang out, " Ootue, bear a hand there, you lubbers, and get on deck again I" And on deck they were again sooner than ho or the mon expected; for just as they showed their heads over the "top" a deep sepnlohral voice called out, " Blows hard, 3 Jack!" They were staggered, and for an in stant hesitated, when again the fearful voice repeated, " Blows lmvd, Jacki" That was enough; their superstitious fears overcame there, and they did not stop till tho deck was reached, By this timo the Captain and mate wore on deck, and wore astonished to see six of tho best men on tho ship come tumbling down, while, the main-top-galiant sail and royal were slatting in thebuntlinosfts though they would blow away at every flap. " What's the matter 1 Why didn't you furl those saiIs ?"aaid tho Captain, " Matter enough," said an old ealt, " You don't get me in that main-top to- night, I wouldn't give much for anyone who goes up, cither, for I not only saw the ghost, or what | over it is, but hcatd him'talk,fl This was too much for the old akippoi\ The idea of losing all bis sails because there was n ghost in tho main-top was too much for him, so ho called for volunteora, and started up tho rigging, follows:! by his two mate3 only. Not another man' would go, Thoso who had been up had soon and heard enough, and those who hadn't did notcaro to risk it. Well, the old skipper and his mates fared no better than the wen, for hardly had their hoads reached over tho. " top rim " than, in tho same awful, blood- curdling tones, came to their ears tho words, '. Blows hard, Jack 1" and there, right in tho "dubliris" oE j,he mast, the Captain caught Bight of two glar ing eyes, and a long white arm reached down as if to olutoh him, and down they all scam Qered to tho deck as fast as their legs would tako them, About daylight tho steward discovered that a pet parrot belonging to the skipper had es caped from his cage, and was gone, probably blown overboard and lost in the gale, I'olly had, however, by hard work, managed to alight in tho main-top, whore she had stowed herself in the, " dublins V of the mast, and was holding on for dear life until she was reacued in tho morning, f&Tho; maln-top.gallant studding sail was lashed in the weather top.mast rigging, and the clew had blown adrift, and happened to flop down at the Captain as ho went over the " top" in the black darkness, and so was easily magnified into a ghostly arm, and Polly into tho frightful ghost,
