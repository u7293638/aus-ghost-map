THE FOOTBALL SEASON. ALEXANDIRA V. GOOUIR The above teams met on our ground on Saturday last. The weather was against all out door spots, as the rain came donn in torrents during the greater part of the afternoon. The match may be described as " md v. mud, "for the ground was in a terrible state.; the game was a "one horse" affair, as the visitors hadn't a ghost of a show against our maio, who played without some of their best'ien. The result speaks for itself :-Alexandra-1- goals, 17 be hinds. Gobar-Nil. The out-and-out doing which the Gobnr foot. ballers received at the hands (or rather the feet) of the Alexandraltes on Saturday last has canused many of the old 'ans in that neighbourhood to hide their heads for the time-being; and put on their "considering caps." Ourcorrespondent says that in order to get them (the members of the Gobur club) into form so that they may be able to play with a team of less pretentions than the Alexandra Club, that they intend to play a match against the local club on the 21st inst and for which purpose they intend #o exhume the bodies of a few of the old-time paids in order to get a strong team for the occason, and whose names will be forwarded to us in time for next issue. Iasty jar, this, for the members of the Gobar Club. Well, it comes from one of their own. The mazih which was arranged to take place to- morrowf between the Alexandra and Thornton Clubs has been postponed on account of several players of both teams taking part in a match between Tallarook and Seymour. This is al together wrong for men to leave their own club to play for another, and If continued, the Alexandra Football Club will very soon be a thing of the past.
