" The Current That Kills." Many people have as genuine a terror of . electricity as their ancestors had of ghosts * and churchyards at midnight. This is quite . foolish. As in the case of ghosts, lt ls ignor- ? ance which frightens, but knowledge which re- . assures. Dr. J. B. Verity, in his "Electricity up to Date," tells us that though "some fatal . results have happened, electricity does not kill wholesale, os do dynamite, gunpowder, or coal gas explosions; nor is the 'list of fatal .accidents to be compared with deaths due to ' exploding or overturned oil lamps." It is . well to remember that the ability tobear.elec- . trie currents varies in different individuals. Moreover, that electricity will certainly kill if contact be good and pressure sufficient, need not bo denied. Indeed, it will kill very prom ptly and certainly; so much so, that Dr. Verity thinks capital punishment by electrocution i3 much, the most speedy and painless of all the methods of killing known to science. On this point he reminds us that, since electricity travels much quicker than sensory nerve cur rents, the brain is rapidly rendered insensi tive and the. subject) therefore becomes quite unconscious long before the sensory nerves can communicate the impression of pain. "The current that kills" is, however, as per fectly under the control of those who have but a,little real knowledge U3 ls the. gas burner or even the composite candle.-The "Hos pital."
