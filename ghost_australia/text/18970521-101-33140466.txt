The jnrj hod fouad* negligeaes, bat did the responsibility li« with the defendants? Lt wu* argued iii at auder th« terms ef the charter party it wa« the duty «if the own«« to provide {or tho security and sufficiency of the beam iu question No doubt the owners guaranteed tue fresse) " to be tight, staunch and strong and in every way fitted for the service to .be required. But it seemed to him that 'it might reasonably be argued that thee; words' referred to the seaworthiness and to the general fitness of the steamer for such services as she was to perform, and would not bo taken as a guarantee that a cross-bar over the bold should not become warped. Again the owners were bound "to maintain the ste&jner; in a thoroughly officiant state in hull and machinery for tbe service tobe performed." It would be difficult, he imagined, to maintain that the efficiency of the hull and machinery wera in any. way impaired hy the defect in the cross-rot" which caused .he accident in question. Yet on the other hand it bed to be admitted that the control and manage ment of the space allotted to the cargo, which might entail the duty of seeing that the Hatchway coverings were in a Ítraper condition, had net been in clear «rms handed over to the charterers. It might with some show of reason; be urged on behalf of the plaintiff that the defen- dants ought to be neld responsible for the accident because they only could have been aware of the defect ls the cross-bar. Ko witnesses for the dafeucc were called, and upon this point th« plaintiff could not he expected to give evidence; He took:it that no one, except in the case of urgent need, would have the right to enter the bold which contained the company's cargo without their permission. The liatches -could, therefore, only be removed under their euperrie'oa or with their coasest. lt might be assnmed that when the vessel was fir*t liaadod over to the charterers by the owners the crossbar in question was in good condition. If it béca'ue defective whilst it was being handled in the serries - of the défendante, why should net the de- fendants be held responsible ? If they were not bound to repair it themselves, was it not, their duty to see that it was set right-by the ; owners P Those were questions which wera j net capable of easy answers in favour of j til« defendant company. It "was evident j that tb« defect was in existence when the ' j ship was last loaded. On that occasion the i loading ernst bave been camed ova UiUer 1 the supervision cc the defendant company er of its servants. Did the company incur no responsibility by eendme: the plaintiff to work ion a hatchway which tbs^r knew, or ought to have known, «as defective ? The Attorney-General had put * case before him which, however, was not analogous. with the present ene. In the present case the defendants knew, or ought tie have known, that there was a toking: dangerie, the work en which the plaintiff was em- ployed, - Both -the other judges were of ^opinion that no obligation rested upon the defendant company either te repair or to get repaired the defective cross-beam. It must be admitted that the terms of the charter party nowhere clearly" gave th«'' défendante the .. right of entering upon the vessel forv any ojher pur !)oso than that of loading or un oading their carge, and es he had been nuable to find any direct authority for holding the defendants liable io the circum- stances ef tits case hs would not formally dissent from the judgment of th? m&i;«riiiy ef the Court Th«; case of Mutray ». Owrie, L.B., 6 C p. M, on which Mr. Bjsynés roUed, did not seem to him to support the plaintiff's «as», Mr, Haynes argued that if the stevedore was liable in that case, the defendants in the present case, whs were acting in the capacity ef stevedores on their-ewn account, must also be held' liable. If tba defendant company ia the present case were liable it was not in their : capacity as stevedores, but betunas a duly rested «pan them to take reasonable pre- caution to «asure the «afety ef those ejsplôyed by them in loading »nd nnioad isg tho-vessel which they hadcbaiterel. Mr. Justice Stone thought it was clear' fzom'the charter party, that ibo master and crew were net under theoontrolef ibo de- fendants, nor were they paid by them except fer «vertnne when engaged in load- ing and unloading. There was no evidence that th« defendants were aware er ought te have known of the defectivo hatchway. Although the plaintiff's counsel. en- deavoured io fix them with notice upon the ground that, as they had to lead, they' ought io have known of such defect, on th« other hand there was 'no evidence to show that the defendants did load the '? steamer. Under tb« circumstances he j failed to see in what way the defendants ' could be held responsible. The owners guaranteed the steamer to be tight, staunch and strong, &c.;, and by so doing (bey tacitly invited them, their agents, and servants to board, the vessel fer the pur- j pose of unloading. Zn hts opinion there was n* mere iuty cast open tb* defendants of examining ibo batch ways before they em- i ployed men to unload than there was fer j them t* ascertain whether the deck of tb« i steamer was in such geed erder as te admit j ef the men going on board fer the samp, purpose. In order to fix the defendants - with liability it was necessary te prov« som« breach of duty en their parter on tb« ! nart *f their servants. It was clearly tb» j duty of the owners and net of the ! charterers to see that the beam which : supported the hatchways and formed part of the hull of the steamer was in geed order j and fit fer the purpose fer which it was ra-1 quired The case of the Omeo Coal Com- pany v. Huntley would appear to establish ' that file master and crew ware th« servants I ef th« owners and net ef the charterers, i Fer these ressens he thought the jude- ; meat-entered fer ti» plaintiff shetud be ; set aside, and judgment entered for th« defendant company. ^ Mr. Justice Hensman said that it was impossible not te sympathie» with the \ jtâftttf in «his sellen. Be bad sus- i tafead etrhmsv beatty injuries -. by' jao fanlt of m> own. Bíífcthe abestien to bs determined was whether those injuries were caused by any neglect'*£ duty «a tba part of tl)» defendants. The jary bad lound that there- was a deîect io tho hatch- way gear which caused the accident, and that there was negligence on the part of those who were responsible for the security cf the hatchway. Didtaeerilenc^showtbat the 'defendants w«ra respemttblo for the security of the hatchway f Ks was of opinion that it did nat. By the defendants' charter party the owners agreed te gniran tee the ship to ba tight, staunch, and in every way fitted for tho service required, and to maintain her in a thoroughly effi- cient state in hull and machinery for the service to be performed. The ewnera were to prof id» and pay th« captain and orew arid the charterers were te work th» cargo with liberty to employ the crew for that purpose, paying them for the servie». The defendants employed their »wu men to unload, amongst whom «as the plaintiff. The action was therefore foy a serrant against his master for a neglect by the Utter of hts duty to his servant The duty of a master ^ESS te exercise reasonable care ia the selection of the persons he employed to work, with the servant and to provide proper gear and materials for his servants to work- with. No complaint had been made a; to the first point, and hs was' unable to find any evidence upon which a jury ceuld say that the defendants had ns»b3cted their dnty upon the ether point They bad contracted with th» »wners sf . th» -ship to provide a vessel ia all respects fit fer th« serries, and he was of opinion that the contract obliged th« owners te have th« vassal not only fit to carry cargo, bot sate and in proper con- dition for its unloading, fi« could not ees -whatmorsosuld.beexpestedfMutthe defen- dants than what they had dene. The defect was latent, lt could only have fesen dis- covered by préviens examination and ex- periment. There was ne evidence that the defendants either kaew of the defect, or that they eagbt t# bave kaewn' ©f its existence. It was a structural defeat in the bull of the ship, for which they were ¿a-ñ» way responsible, os to which they had ni ade express pro vision in their agreement with .the owner*, and against which no care that they were bound te exercise could have provided. Under tho circumstanoasi and without expressing any opinion upon the question'of the liability-of -»ny other person te the j/laintiff, he was of »pinion that the défendants were uotliabl* for the. injuries which had hapjieued to th* plain- tiff, auátfcat judgment ought to bs entered for tbs defendants. Upon tit« motion of the Attorney-General tUe appeal was upheld, and an order made, that the sam èf /damages paid. into Conrt-should be returned "t« tb« defendant company. , ' v Z.

Haynes might produce an affidavit setting forth the reasons ef the magistrate for refusing to grant a new trial Mr. Haynes produced the required affi- davit, in which it was stated that the claim was upon a lawyer's bill of costs more than three months eld, and under the terms of the Legal Practitioners' Act it was a bill that could not be taxed, and therefore if he heard the case again be should still be obliged to find a verdict for the full amount. MT. Haynes contended that the plaintiff's claim was not upon a bill ef cesa, ss it wee made in a amp sum which the defendant considered excessive. The magistrate should, therefore, have granted a re-bearing of the case. Mr. Parker argued at considerable length in support of the magistrate's view of the case and urged numerous «oints. 1 Mr. Justice Hensman remarked in the j course ef argument that the magistrate ¡ was willing to grant a new trial, but he \ thought ho saw a legal J»r in tbs way. j The Chief Justice : Which bas proved a ghost. \ The bench was unanimous in tbe opinion : that the magistrate bad laboured nuder a mistaken understanding when be regarded ' the plaintiffs claim as constituted by a legal bill of costs.
