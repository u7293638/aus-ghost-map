ANOTHER MAOLEAN GHOST. \--- Tnx public cannot but remember all the ghostly apparitions that have dis turbed a home situated on the heights of the classic town of Maclean (says an exchange). On Friday evening last the lady of this romantic home accom panied a visiting lady on an evening walk. The happy ladies had just re turned as the sun was sinking into the western seas, and in looking for some vestas one of them, to her groat sur prise, laid her hand upon the nose of a now boarder. There they found a particularly ugly man in bed, his head reosting on a pillow gently smoothed down, and just about to practise chromatic pieces on his nose. One of the ladies succeeded in fainting,, the other began a cloture movement by sealing the doors and putting two blackfollows on guard, while a third wont for the police. The police arrived, and said in a familiar voice, " Is that you, Bill ?" The reply was " Yes." After a brief explanation, the unwel come guest was taken to the lockup, and was afterwards sentenced to a period of seovon days. The wonderful difference in the presence of mind of both ladies cannot be overlooked. While one was fainting, the other was making preparations for a capture. If " Bill" had the intention of do veloping into a midnight ghost, would his apparition be visible so early in the evening, unless 3to wore of unsdund mind at that particular time of the day ? It would seem as if all the ghost scares of the past had develope'd into a"'oiisiblo reality in the presence of tiis grlacoful stranger. It seems hard that he should be dis tiurbed from his poeaceful slumber, and that he'should pay a penalty of seven days for a bid' occupied for so short a time. : Many people think that those seven' diis retreat will puit an end to the lheart troubles; and that a big victory has been sebred against ghosts in general.
