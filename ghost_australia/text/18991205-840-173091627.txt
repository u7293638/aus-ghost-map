Tiie chief feature in tho news of tho war to-day is tho announcement that many Capo Dutch in tho north of Capo Colony have rebelled and joined the enemy. This is serious becunso it entails tho em ployment of many troops who would other- aviso ho at tho front to keep theso disloyalists jn cheek, who can do much harm by threatening communications. The Bechuunulaud mounted polico is a rather mysterious body, turning up at one phieo ono day, and tho next showing its activity far away. Evidently this fine irregular- force is doing tvery needful work in breaking up and clearing 'largo areas of Bcchuanalund of small roving 'bodies of Boer raiders. i The ubsenco of news from Natal is annoy- jing, but there does not seem much to be feared in that quarter now. The long silence, however, from Matching 'in tlio far north is ominous. All tlio Australian troops have now arrived lot South Africa except the Queensland con tingent in tho Cornwall. , , These men, when they have got ready for (field work, will doubtless ho sout to the ! Orange Free Stuto frontier, .like tho rest of the 'Australian forces. The entertainment of Colonel Pennycuick Ion board tho stcamor Lucinda by the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce was a success from many points of view. The speech made by tho colonel was full of valuublo instruction, und its publication will ) certainly cause tho scheme to bo easily nudcrstanded of tho people." ( Tiie eminent engineer was courteous enough tto answer a number of questions. Some of tho questions wero reasonable and (sensible. Others wero otherwise, and at least jone of them could have beon answered by a Vschoolboy. An alderman, who when speaking of water (is in bis clement, desired Colonel Pennycuick 'to givo bis views on tho question of irrigation. The quiet and dignified reply was that (when tho Government desired tho colonel jto report on irrigation ho would do so, but he 'did not think that his roport had anything' to 'do with irrigation. When Colonel Pennycuick asked what (would happen if tho steamer boiler blew up, . Mn. Dalbymtle interjected, "Thero would llie an end to tlio speechifying." Piiobably ho did not consider that this would be u relief, though hasty people might 'filler that ho did. At any rato ha appeared to be deeply (interested in the colonel's utterances. The colonel is excellent company, being j exceedingly well informed, yot modest almost to shyncsa. Soeptioai, gentlemen who boarded the ; steamer wont homo fully convinced that at length disustors from flood will bo prevented. "Gbay Ghost op Lindewarnk." See Christmas number of the Week.

Too many war correspondents have snoli in. strong wish to send sonsational accounts Ithat censorship becomes a necessity, l A sriiAOQLEB at tho battle of Marengo j quitted tlio field when the fight was going lagainst tho French, and posting to Paris 'announced defeat. The greatest consternation and an incipient (revolution was put an end to by tho arrival K)f Bonupurto's aido-do-cuinp with tho news % | of victory , whioh reinforcements of the Frcnoh Iliad secured. Too much haste in tho present campaign (might also causo confusion. . . The French Press warns Monelik that iwhen tbo South Afriann question is settled a I danger will arise for Abyssinia.
