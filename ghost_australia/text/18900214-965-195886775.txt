MY UNCLE'S ADVENTURE, A Wabninq to Antiquabian Enthusiasts. Mr-uncle had a large nose, which was often the occasion of irreverent jokes at his ie. He was also a man of antiquarian tastes, and was often victimised by tiiose who palmed off upon him worthless articles which he was persuaded to believe were of ancient origin and of priceless value. With these'" curiosities " he filledhis house, mucly toilie anuojrance of my auntand the amusemenfof"his less credulous friends. But he was suddenly awakened from these absurdities in a manner so remarkable that he invoked my aid in reproducing a story often told by himself at his own fireside. It was a sultry afternoon in the month of September, when my uncle bent his steps across the common and through the meadows to visit a neighbouring farmer friend. On the occasion of this visit, and just as he was leaving, after having partaken of the usual hospitalities of the place, he espied in a corner of the farmyard an old iron pot, nearly spherical in shape, which had formerly stood on three legs, but could now only boast of two. Owing to its unsafe condition it had long since been disused, and had been consigned to its resting-place on the principle that for all the ills of life prevention is better than cure. A somewhat minute inspection of its exterior revealed the figure 16, followed by something which could not readily be deciphered; and instead of concluding that these marks probably represented nothing more than the size of the article in question, the great antiquary rashly concluded that the 16 with the obliterated marks represented nothing short of the date of its manufacture. A pot whose early existence was probably contemporary with Cromwell could not he permitted to remain in such a place. Accordingly my uncle determined to transfer it to Stanley Court, there to keep company with the many relics of days long ago. But his burden proved more inconvenient than he anticipated. After taxing his ingenuity to the utmost to discover a means of carrying it with a maximum amount of ease,it finallyoccurred tohiiil that, inverted, it might rest on his head. Accordingly, it was so placed, and my uncle proceeded with the queerest helmet that ever pressed the brow of a human being. His path lay along the bank of a small river, and so down to the rnill. Here, it may be mentioned in parenthesis, lived an old sweetheart, who, out of patience, I suppose, in waiting for the question from my uncle, had accepted his rival, the miller, fully twenty years before. Across the stream a dam had been constructed for the purpose of diverting the water to the mill, and thus a pond was formed at least five feet deep. The water often flowedover the dam, forming a beautiful cascade from six to eight feet in height; and when the water was low, people frequently passed over the wooden platform of the aam to save the walk to the bridge, which stood more than a hundred yards below the mill. But doubtless, my uncle had another reason for selecting this route, a reason Which received additional force from the strange appearance which he now presented. As may be readilysupposed, the action of the water had rendered the platform Very smooth and slippery. Along this dangerous path, however, my iiiicle proceeded, but whether from the effect of the aforesaid hospitalities, or from the weight of the pot on his head, he became unsteady in his gait, and suddenly slipped. A fall of "eight feet to the bed of the river was no joke; besides, such a fall could only end in the destruction of the pot. Now, divided attention is always to be avoided, where the possible issues are serious, Jls under even ordinary circumstances, a slip in such a place was no trifling matter; but with the object of his solicitude firmly fixed on his head, what wonder that his safety was doubly jeopardised ? Be that as it may, the fact remains that he stumbled upon the slippery platform, and the pot slipping over his nose, enveloped his entire head! Practically blind, he was now less capable than ever of recovering his footing; and his attempts to do so ended in my worthy relative tumbling head first into the mill pond. Thus was he brought literally face to face with an ignominious death, no better than that of the vilest cur which leaves the world with a stone tied to its neck. But the darkest hour is not unfrequently the hour of deliverancei it prated so herfii The attention of Joe, the miller's iilah, had been attracted to my unole before he reached the dam, by the strange head-gear worn by my relative. The unsteady gait, the slip, the fall, the plunge, were all observed; and having reached the pond as quickly as possible, Joe succeeded, after considerable difficulty, in-extricating my uncle from his perilous position. Whenever the old gentleman related the story to his friends he moralised here on the vanity of human wishes. " Yes, nephy," he would say, turning to met " that Was the crisis in my history, ttdtmerely as regards the unexpected extension of my existence, but more particularly with reference to the folly which was the outcome of the mania which had seized me. I never felt how useless my life had been till death _ stared me in the face Under such ignominious surroundings. My punishment appeared to me as complete as it was deserved. Drowning seemed Only the secondary cause of my death, thei real cause being the ruling passion which had prompted me to possess the pot. The idea of dying with my head in such a position, humiliating though it was, bore no comparison to my thoughts as I felt the air rise in bubbles from the pot in solemn mockery of my life, and thought how, in breaking upon the surface, they wrote my epitaph,' Emptiness.'" Having rescued my uncle, Joe carried him to the house of the miller, where he removed the wet garments, placed him in bed between the blankets, and applied those means for his restoration generally resorted to in cases of suspended animation. It was fortunate that Joe was familiar With the treatment, as he was the only person on the premises, and the nearest house was fully half a mile distant. He persevered in his efforts and ere long Was rewarded by returning consciousness. But the pot, the terrible pot still canopied my uncle's head in spite of every endeavour to remove it. "The nose was the cause yoU see," the old gentleman would say, playfully tapping that protuberant organ with his finger, " and appeared to be little short Of a bolt, which defied the removal of that ungraceful headgear." Now, of all places, the mill was perhaps the last which my uncle would have cared to visit under the circumstances. He could not endure the thought that the nuller's wife, his old sweetheart, should witness such a spectacle, and was really distressed at the idea that her eyes might even now be resting on his misfortune. The old pot refused that assurance to him which his eyes would have supplied, and so he had to rest content with the repeated avowal of his benefactor Jde:— 11 Keep yer mind aisy; the maister and his wife and the whole lot 'em be gone to the fair. But don't ye_ be afeard on the missus. She be mighty kind and 'ud help ye heaps if she was here. And now ye be safe and a-comin' round a bit I can't help a-laughin' just a little bit. I zeed ye go in headvurmost, right down like, and yer legs a-kickin' up zummat like the ducks" when they goa-divin' after what 'em can catch in the pond. Then there's that there pot about yer head. La! I never zeed such a nightcap in all my born days. Don't think I'm a-makin' fun on ye, but I've a-tried toget'n off, and 'er won't come, leastways without a piece o' yer nose, and I reckon you don't want to spare a slice o' that." With these and such like speeches Joe enlivened his patient, introducing parenthetically such hearty bursts of laughter that my uncle speedily recovered himself, but his increasing strength only intensified his desire to get clear away before the miller and his wife returned. As a first step in this direction he emerged from the blankets in which, barring his head, he had been enveloped, and with the assistance of Joe as his valet, he dressed in the garments which that worthy supplied. There was nothing remarkable about "these, with the exception of a smock-frock of snowy whiteness, which extended to my uncle's feet, and played a not unimportant part in the sequel of the story. But here arose a difficulty. Joe being left in charge of the premises could not leave until his master's return. Every argument which his ingenuity supplied to detain his patient, and every protest against my uncle's injustice in believing the miller's wife capable of aught but sympathy, fell upon my uncle's ears " like water on a duck's back." Finding that he could place the pot in a position which enabled him to see his feet, and consequently the path bit by bit along which he had to travel, besides being jible to raise the plaguy apparatus sufiS- ciently to enable him to breathe; and seeing that Joe could not accompany him as a uide and protector, he determined tq make he attempt to reach the village alone. Being naturally anxious to avoid, as far as possible, the public gaze, all thought of taking the turnpike-road was abandoned, though he need not have been under such apprehension, for who amongst the many returningrom the fair would be likely to recognise An that strange figure Farmer Bloomfleid of Stanley Court ? Indeed his objection to this route might have been overcome but for his dread of meeting the miller and his wife, who, so he thought, might possibly recognise the garb which enveloped him, and would naturally feel unpleasantly inquisitive about the individual within it. Yet a walk of three miles through meadows and across a common after seven o'clock on a September evening, under such circumstances, appeared well nigh as possible for a blind man. Anything, however, appeared preferable to thedisclosure he so much dreaded, and so, trusting to his circumscribed vision, he departed with slow and steady steps along the old familiar path, determined, by a happy thought, to make his way to the village blacksmith, whose ingenuity he had no doubt would speedily remove the encumbrance. The keenest foresight is, however, unable to anticipate the circumstances which may befall us. For some time all went well, and the antiquary's progress, though slow, was sure. But what with the sultriness of the evening, the defective ventilation inside the pot, and the weight of that at other times useful article, my uncle was compelled to sink to the ground in a faint, just as he had reached a shallow brook, over which he had to pass; and there he lay until consciousness returned. How long he had been in this position he did not know, but he soon became painfully aware of the fact that the shades of night had closed around him. Nor was his anxiety diminished as a thunder-storm burst over his head. Heavyclouds overspread the sky, and deepened the darkness; so that when my uncle rose to his feet, he found the path completely hidden from hla view. In so helpless a condition, what wonder that he wandered from the familiar track! To add to his discomfort, the rain came down in torrents; whilst the lightning, flashing around him, filled him with a new terror. Still he continued to trudge his weary way ; and at length, to his intense delight, he heard the faint but welcome sounds which came from the anvil of the village blacksmith. Sweeter music he had never heard. He listened intently to the sound as it was wafted across the gloomy common, and with his ears as a pilot, walked on, cheered by the fact that every step brought him nearer to the man who would remove the load from his head — and heart. He had not proceeded far in the direction of the smithy, when he became aware of the approach of a man, and in the snatches of song which fell upon the darkness, he recognised a familiar voice. It was the village schoolmaster, who, being fully occupied by day in keeping other people's spirits down, resolved that his evenings should be spent in keeping his own spirits up, which he succeeded tolerablywell in doing at the dub which met nightly at the village Mil. A load of anxiety fell from my uncle's heart as the schoolmasterapproached him. But, alas I the relief was only momentary. Whether the darkness hid my uncle from his sight, or whether he was so occupied with ms thoughts as to be unconscious of such a peison's presence, we need not stop to inquire. A vivid flashof lightning for an instant lit tip the scene when they were but a fertr yards apart, revealing my uncle shrouded in garments of snowy whiteness. The song suddenly ceased; a shriek rent the air, and the tremulous voice of my belated relative, intended to remove the schoolmaster's fear, served only to quicken his flightacross the common to the village inn, which he had left only half an hour before. With a face ghastly pale, with drops of perspiration like peas standing on his forehead, and trembling and gasping for breathj he threw himself into a chair, perfectly overcdme aild speechless. In the hands of the landlady he recovered in a few minutes sufficiently to explain the cause of his terror. He had witnessed that night, he said, such a sight as never before met his eyes. In passing the spot on the common where, in the remembranceof most of his heargrS; tt fflllrdertd man had been found— a spot he confessed he never passed at night without nervous excitement—just as he had commenced a song, by way of diminishing the loneliness of his situation, a horrid being stood before him. It was clad in white, but had a head as black as night from the top of which projected two short horns. It was impossible to be mistaken. A flash of lightning revealed all this too plainly, and seemed for an instant to dance Around the head Of the Satanic spectre. Besides this a voice, sepulchral in its tones, plainly called him by name. Surely the evidence df two of his senses could not be rejected. His associates at the inn gave a ready ear to the statement and after partaking of some Dutch courage) at the earliest request of the schoolmaster, they consented to accompany him across the common to his home; Amongst them Was Joe, who, on the return Of the miller, had Walked to Stanley Court by the ifdad, professedly to bring my uncle's clothes, but in reality from a feeling of anxiety about his safety, Finding he hac[ not returned Joe started off in search of the wanderer, and on his way stepped into the village inn just in time to hear the schoolmaster's accoiint of the ghost on the common. He might easily have removed the schoolmaster's fears, but being of a frolicsome turn, and wishing to test the courage of his bodyguard, he remained silent and followed them unobserved when they left the inn. Meanwhile the ringing sounds from the anvil had guided the exhausted wanderer, and before the party from the inn had proceeded far the supposed ghost was encountered Dutch courage proved unequal to the shock, and Joe had the satisfaction of seeing them scamper away as fast as their legs could carry them, each one doubtless as much overcome as had been the sohoolmaster when he sank speechless into a chair but a few minutes before. The faithful Joe, however, was soon at my uncle's side) atld Under his guidance the smithy Was reached. A consultation now took place as to the best means of effecting a release; and nothing appeared so practicable as to place the pot on the anm and with a sharp blow from a hammer to shatter it into fragments. A hazardous ;, but desperate ills require despe- 11 was therefore not without forebodings of evil that my uncle, supported by Joe, placed the pot as directed. Down came the blow; and my uncle stood erect, a happier and a wiser man. The kindhearted and faithful Joe lived long in my uncle's service as farm bailiff, and never wanted a friend as long as the old gentleman lived; and, in repeating these extra- ordinary proceedings to eager listeners, he would assure them that "he never zeed sich a nut afore, nor sich a kernel."
