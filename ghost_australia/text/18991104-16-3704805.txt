LANDS DEPARTMENT RED ORR. PASTORAL OCCUPATION. The business connected with the operation of the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869, which is entirely confined to unsettled districts, was practically much of a routine character. The total number of new runs applied for was seven, of a gross area of 472,/<2 square miles, and of a total annual rental of £71 12s. 6d., and the licenses for two other runs were refused. There were purchased at auction eleven forfeited runs, of a total area of 385 square miles, and of a gross annual rental of £372, the average price per square mile realised being 10s. I 6½d. for the lot. The particulars of runs held under this Act at the end of the year, and situated outside the boundaries of the first schedule of the Act of 1884, are Total number of runs, 1598 ; gross area In square miles, 96,150 ; total annual rental on available area, £54,627 18s. 4d.; average rent, 14s. 4d. The gross annual rent ''of leases extended under the Act of 1890 is £9363. The runs occupied at the end of the year were settled districts : Total number of runs, 23 ; gross area, 1016% square miles ; i total annual rental, £1666 4s. 10d. Un- I settled districts : Total number of runs, . 2784 ; gross area, 369,841 square miles ; j total annual rental on available area, £303,707 8s. 4d. | The time for payment of rents in tick infested areas were extended, and the arrears had been well met. " The total pastoral Tents, including those for occupy- j son licenses, as per rent list made up to | 30th June, 1898, and payable on or before 3 30th September following, amounted to a. gross sum of £344,075. Of this there was a paid during 1898 the sum of £257,023 9s. | 10d.; and a further sum of £76,892 4s. 4d., being principally for Tents of lands in tick | quarantine area, for which extension of time j for payment had been granted up to 31st March, 1899, was paid during 1899, but not I later than that date ; thus making a total sum of £333,915 14s. 2d. out of the total amount due in 1898, being more than 97 per cent of the whole of the rents due, which is very satisfactory, considering everything." AGRICULTURAL, GRAZING, AND SCRUB SELECTIONS. The total area proclaimed open to selection in each made during 1898, under the provisions of the Crown Lands Acts, 1884 to 1895, and the Land Act, 1897, respectively, was as follows: The Crown Lands Acts, 1884 to 1895 : Conditional and unconditional, 75,20.2 acres ; unconditional only, 1461 acres ; grazing farm and grazing homestead, 269,011 acres ; graz- ing homestead only, 2560 acres ; conditional only, under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands (Purchase Acts, 1894 and 1897, 37,170 j acres ; making a total of 385,420 acres. The Land Act, 1897 : Agricultural farms, agricultural homesteads, and unconditional I selections, 4,274,040 acres ; agricultural farms and unconditional selections, 489,588 acres ; grazing farm and grazing homestead, 11,078,805 acres ; scrub selections, 191,027 acres ; agricultural farms and unconditional selections, under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Purchase Acts, 1894 and 1897, 997 acres ; making a total of 16,034,457 acres. The largest area opened was at Winton, 1,678,214 acres, nearly the whole being for grazing selection. The place where the greatest areas were opened for agricultural selection were-Brisbane, 430,933 acres ; Bundaberg, 435,276 acres and Gympie, 311,713 acres. The total area of land remaining open to selection in the colony at the end of the year was 12,266.461 acres. Agricultural selections, exclusive of selections under the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act, exceeded those in 1897 by 247 in number, and 65,374 acres in area. Agricultural homesteads were much in demand. Out of 1224 agricultural selections, of 302,812 acres, there were 684 agricultural homesteads, representing 151,391 acres. In unconditional selections, the number was less, but the area selected greater by 8683 acres than the previous year. There was a decrease of thirty in number in the grazing selections, equal to 418,601 acres. The decrease was due principally to the unfavourable seasons and causes of a temporary nature. Grazing homesteads had, however, increased by four, and in area by 413,864 acres, due to the increase in the maximum area allowed. Out of 191,027 acres opened to scrub selection, 54,506 acres were selected. The amount received for first year's rents on all farms was £32,999, Including £9210 under the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act. The total second year's rents payable on SI st March, 1899, was £122,643, an increase of £26,323. The amount of this rent received up to the compilation of the report was £113,974, or 92.9 per cent, which was considered satisfactory. The area of conditional and unconditional selections made freehold during the year was 33,63 acres. AUCTION SALES. The allotments sold during the year were 999, consisting of 92,815 acres, realising £157, 276, as against 1101 lots, 149,998 acres, realising £84,539, during 1897. There was a slight increase in the total area of town lots ; (but a decrease of 21 acres in sub- urban lots, and 57,173 acres In country lots. The average prices were Town lots, £30 18s. 3d. per acre ; suburban, £3 8s.; country, 10s. 6d. The two former are slightly less than the average, and the third a trifle more. OPENING AND CLOSING ROADS. The applications received for the opening or closing of roads was 260 ; US new roads were opened, and 70 permanently closed. The total revenue was £698, and the compensation paid £170. The cost of survey of new roads opened was £694, of which £398 was paid by divisional boards. TIMBER (ROdGULAflUOINiS. The total receipts for the year from the, issue of ordinary timber licenses, sale of confiscated timber, and of special rights to cut timber, were £7091 19s. 3d., being a slight decrease. (Brisbane produced the greatest revenue. Speaking of the administration of the Act, the Under Secretary favours the royalty system, as likely to produce more revenue, and prevent timber seeing ruthlessly destroyed ; tout the cost to the department would be much greater. He believed, however, that the solution of the problem would be met by energetically administering sections 29 and 30 of the present regulation, which authorise the sale, by public auction or private contract, of the right to cut any specified number of trees on a given area. Under these sections, payment of royalties, as well as taking out licenses, or other necessary conditions, may be imposed. In this connection the time had arrived when it Alias desirable to ap- point an experienced officer as Conservator of Forests, for the purpose of assisting the land commissioners in selecting the most suitable localities for timber reserves, and generally for inspecting and advising upon the best means to he adopted for the prevention of waste of the indigenous timbers and the profitable disposal thereof. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE. The riots territorial revenue for the year was a 139,429 19s., showing an apparent decrease of £61,867 3s. 7d. But the revenue was short by £76,892 4s. 4d" which was allowed to stand over for payment on mines in tick-infested areas, until this year. If that sum had been included, the increase would have been £15,025 0s. 9d The expenditure was £77,732 10s" of which £40,138 19s. 7d. was for supply of wire net- ting to lessees and rabbit boards ; £9101 12s. 3d. for permanent staffs of country offices ; £7753 13s. 5d. for head office and £4334 9s. for Land Court. The total number of officers in the department was 87, of whom 37 were engaged in Brisbane. C. Arthur Pearson, Limited, have quite taken rank with the other great publishing houses in London, and they have a good " staff" of authors working for them. Headon Hill is to be out shortly with " The Shadow of the Bear," while E. and H. Heron, who, up to the present, have a claim to be considered as two of the few funny writers of to-day, are preparing " Ghosts : Being the Experiences of Flaxman Low," a series of incidents quite distinct from their earlier work.
