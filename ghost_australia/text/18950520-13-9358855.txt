MONDAY, MAY 20, 1895. Mr. REID informs our special cor- respondent who is inquiring into the Budget situation in New South Wales that, so far from intending his fiscal proposals to be hostile to federation, he is convinced that it is only by procedure on his lines that the colonies can ever be brought together. And so far as provincial duties are concerned, our Victorian federationists have admitted before to-day that Mr. REID is right. On the last occasion that the tariff was under discussion in the Legislature, the Victorian members who have definitely espoused the Australian cause took the ground that new duties aimed at Australian products, or any in- crease of duties aimed at Australian products, were to be deprecated as tend- ing to widen the breach, and as throw- ing fresh obstacles in the path of federal unity. Mr. PEACOCK, Mr. BEST, Mr. DEAKIN, and others used this argument, and it is too manifestly correct to be challenged in good faith. It must be admitted to be correct even by the men who are hostile to a common Australia. The provincial party which exists in all the colonies, and is probably far stronger than it is generally supposed to be, believes that each member of the group will do best for itself by isolating itself from its neighbours, and by each taxing the others' products. It believes that given free intercourse and the one colony would kill the other. The fable of the sticks and the faggot is in the eyes of this party all nonsense, and in- stead of the bundle acquiring a common strength it would develop a general weakness. Desirous as this party is of seeing Australia split into seven colonies, or better still into seven times seven, it is perfectly reasonable in call- ing for an increase of border duties whenever occasion offers. For the same reason the supporters of the Australian cause were right in the last Vic- torian Parliament in opposing the pro- posed increases, and both logic and honesty, both reason and intuition, must tell these federal workers that Mr. REID is right in not only refusing to increase border duties, but in de- clining to countenance and in doing his best to get rid of the current border hostility. If Mi Iii ID IB right os an Australian then Sir Iii M V P vi M s is making a painful exhibition of himsolf when he declares that Ins zeal for federation, and that alone, compels lum to oppose the lioid Budget On othei grounds that scliomo is open to ciiticibin, but not on this Sn Jil vin Putuis may havo deceived himself J lie powoi of \nin old men to deceive themselves is won dorful But his aigunients can scaicely dupe any other In ing poison-and certainly they will not diipo thoso who will use lum as their tool Ho objects to tho Bad tai id lovision in tho convoniont nanio of fodaation, and }ct his suppoitas in nino cases out often aro tho pio\ merni 01 anti Ans Italian members They aio tho mein bois who want the local su0ar duties in oula to keop out (.¿uconsl uni sn0ai, and who wint the "lain tho butta, and all similar imposts nioidei to ched 01 stop A ictoiian comj etition In neaily ovory insttinco tint }ou tneel a piotectionist in Now South A\ ales-as Ali J i ID put tho case to om icpie scntativQ-ho is a man who desnes to hit back at Vietoiia Given tho o anti A ictormn duties and tho JNCW ^outh AAolcs intcctioiust will toloiato nnpoit duties at tho port reluso thoso internal duties und he will ha\o no such injurious imposts 1 lins Su Jil MU Tutus, wlnlo tailing about Austialia, is championing the anti fcdaalists Unless ho tau bo oxcuficd on tho plea that his fciasp of tho ease is not what it onco was, his best fneilds must loluctantly confess that ho is doing all ho can to clou 1 Ins reputation and to justify tho ]ini«licst cnticisma of his loco Provincial duties, creating pio i mual interests, are the real obstacles to federation. They oac.i create on interest, more or less powerful, hostile to the idea of an Australia^great in its home market, great in its commerce, and great in its national influence. It is always a repugnant as well as a difficult task to light against vested interests, and the true Australian will always bo deeply anxious to so arrange as to avoid a collision between a wiso patriotism and local pockets, llonce tho man who removes anti-Australian duties in his own colony must be the real friend to the Australian cause. Mr. BEI» expresses the beliet that his offer to throw -few South Wales open to all Australia will evoke federal enthusiasm. If it does not, federal leaders will have to admit that the work before them is far moro arduous than they havo imaginod, inasmuch as it will look as though -hero were very little solid Australian feeling at present to work upon. We shall hope for the best. Ono remark of Mr. ..BID to our representativo is worthy of notice. " I " calculato," says tho New South Wales Premier, " that the taxes on tho " four articles I propose to leave in will " realise ¿£1,250,000 per annum." That is to say, tlioso four articles (for opium may bo excluded from consideration) will bring in a rovenue of £1 per head, and if so, tho Customs revenue account as between tho two colonies will stand PerHead XewSouth Wales, .articlestaxed... ül 0 0 Victoria,-100 articles taxed. £1 !) G There is nothing absurd in Mr. Bern's I computation. Great Britain with her light duties realises n total revenue of ¿£1 -is. per head; Victoria, when sho taxed only ten nrticlos, raised as much rovenue per head ns she docs to-day. It is difficult to over-estimate in reason tho revenue power of woll-selected Customs duties so levied that everybody using tho selected articles shall pay- tho Treasury receiving the indirect tax as a wholo as it would reccivo any direct tax. When we comparo the pro- ceeds of a " tariff for revenue " with what is loft of tho proceeds of a tariff at which artificial trades have taken each its separate pull, tho diflerenco is indeed astonishing. Mr. REID'S calcu- lation gives point to the argument that the way to maleo suro of Freo Land which ought to be the great object with a community which must livo by the land-is to return as fast as wo con- veniently can-as quickly ns a full and a fair consideration of vested intorests will allow-to the broad and tho couimon-senso rulo of levying' taxes, oithor at tho Customs or elsewhere, for the one object of raising money for public purposes. And then if the community , desired to aid an " infant industry " it could proceed by bonus, tho industry and tho workers at the industry know- ing what it was receiving, and above all tho community-which is now fleeced wholosalo-knowing what it was pay- ing. BURKE spoko of vice as losing half its evil when it parted with all its grossness. Tho proposition is doubtful. But state aid does lose the poison of its sting when that aid is given in tho light of day. Should the Turner Ministry be re- membered for anything particular after its demiso and cremation, it may be its voluminous letter-writing. Tho lettcr I writing propensity of Mr. SHIELS pretty j well did for his Premiership, and Mr. TURNER and Mr. ISAACS between them appear to bo courting a similar fato. Their workmanship, whethor joint or several, is moro remarkable for biting phrases and multiplicity of sentences than dignity of expression and sound arguing. Tho Attornoy-General in his eagerness to talk forgets the responsi- bility of office and the quiet and solid interests of tho country, which aro by no means synonymous with tho reputa- tion of the members of Parliament lie is so anxious to protect. It will bo ob- served ho very carefully avoids asking Judge 'MOLESWORTH to name or enter i into particulars it would bo inconvonient to hear about tho legislators who have secretly compounded, and by so doing evaded the spirit of tho law, whoso letter has been so artfully complied with. Nowhero in Air. ISAACS'S long dospatch is a word said about bricking up or mounting guard over the backdoor into tho Insolvent Court, which appoars to bo so serviceable to representative gentlemen who wero caught in the troubles of tho land boom, yet do not wish to relinquish tho privilego of making laws for men who pay 20s. in tho ¿El. Perhaps Judgo MOLESWORTII'S mentioning tho matter at all should bo considered censured in somo one or other of tho ? reproofs, couched in general terms, which remind him of tho danger of speaking lightly of the democratic equivalent of the Lord's anointed. Tho length of tho Attornoy-Goneral's letter and tho number of dates and ox tracts paraded in it aro, no doubt, accounted for by his having to go through tho papers bofore ho could sit down to point out to Judgo MOLES WORTH that ho was altogether in the wrong. And the first porson whom tho narrativo should fill with regret is Mr. CUTIIDERT. In his haste, when a Minister is apt to slip, vide the Psalmist, Mr. CUTHBERT said that it was tho County Court judges who, wanted lo shift Judgo MOLESWORTH from town ; but now it nppears that tho idea was entirely of departmental origin. So littlo did tho judges approvo that nono of thom but Judgo CASEY thought tho suggestion" practicable or desirable. The exception will bo recognised as the inevitable one demonstrating tho soundness of tho rule ; whilo as for the correction Mr. ISAACS'S quotations givo to tho ex- planation which Mr. CUTHHI;RT vouch- safed to tho press, of courso a lapso of tho kind is not unprecedented in tho history of tho Minister of Justice, so it required no special apology at the hands of Mr. ISA AIM. Tho correspondence threatens to prove as great a treat to the public as tho Kingston-Turner discussion, so voluminously carried on, yet ended, as Beatiico baili of Benedick (who mado the lady a presont of the last word), " with a jude's trick." Wo shall there- fore nt present Miy as littlo as possible, not wishing to savo either sido the ' necessity of keeping up tho fight till tho wholo truth conies out, Mr. ISAACS thinks Judge MOLESWORTH has shaken public conlidcnco in tho administration of justice, but so far,his Honour has i only cast doubts on tho accuracy and ' lttigo-mindednt'ss of Ministers and tho scrupulousness of llid-ûliond. of insol 1 vent politicians, So he is moro likoly to j provo his words than to withdraw them, ¡which demand for a withdrawal is so ' couched, by tho way, that most on 1 lookers will think it lucky for his Honour ' that ho cannot bo humiliated with tho dismissal which Ministers look rathol" anxious to order We have ah cady said that the judge has not made out an overwhelming case, and we daiesay that in his lomarles on the I B Davies application he was an ticipating piessuro to como rather thnn speaking of pressure past Upon that point we may leam moie haeaftci As to the malingering, tho tine ] nature of Mr ISA vos comes out va y cloaily when lie amvos at that phase of the controversy The half pay notice was only balking, how much pleasuio it would gue the Attoiney Geneial to bite comos out cloaily enough when ho lunts at the pains and I penalties which would have íssiieií if the Government dated to havo suspected that his Honoui when ill in bed was only pietonding At this stage of the conespondenco no aro brought lo feel that governing tho counti} is, fiom the Isaacs point of view, consileiod a soit of foiensie wa; fate Banco cxporionco makes lum regal d the otha side as an enemy whonovoi he is di awn into an aigumont Wiitin wo sec in what form wold was to be communicated to Judge Mon sworan that ho was to consider himself on half pay we shall know what to thinkof the inference his Honour diew fiom tho notice If the intimation wus of thcusualcui t, off hand kind, hchadainplo excuse, and tho fact mentioned by Mi Is v ves that a verbal explanation had to bo added when tho judge recova ed, inclines us to believe, foi the present, that the noto was a good deal too laconic to be courteous or m keeping with the occasion 'Iho Attorney Genoral harps a littlo on tho "general " rule " In the Dow nie case, Mr Justico HOOD caught a wit nes3 emphasising tho wold "living" Lvety time ho had to deny that a particular thing had been given linn by any pa son, ho said living poison, whence his Honour concluded that ho was indulging in a bit of va bal casiustiy Mi ISAACS sa}s that Judge MorrswonTii carno under the " geneial " nile " Why does ho not say univasal nile 1 Is it because some otha olhcer of his own department was otha wiso .dealt with?
