A Ghost Story from Ireland- A gentleman' took a house in 'Ireland for six months, and was accompanied thither by his, wife and daughters. Tho house was furnished, and had plenty of bedrdoras.' Therefore, it was decided not to use a certain large, long, room, with cupboards along one side (which had all been locked, and sealed UP with tape), in which things belonging to the owners of the house had been put away. One evening one of the daughters, go ing up. to her room, saw an old wrapped in a shawl walking along tne passage in front of her. The old lady appeared to know her way. and hurried on without hesitation into the unused room. The girl called her sister, and they followed the dame into the room. But all was silent; no one was there; the dust lying about showed no .signs of footprints. .Shortly after, the same young fa'dy was reading on the hearth rug. by firelight. Looking up, she be held the old lady standing in the door way watching her. Greatly frightened, she sprang up. and, rushing dowh- stairs, was found fainting at the draw ing-room door. At last the family re turned to Dublin. One day, when a friend was calling, the curious incident which I have narrated was referred to. The young lady very unwillingly told her experiences. The visitor seemed much struck, and asked for an accurate description' of the old lady. "For," said she. "that house belonged to two old ladies, sisters, and when they let their house they went to reside at Geneva; one of them, answering exactly to the- description you have given, died at the time you saw her appear." â€” "Realm."
