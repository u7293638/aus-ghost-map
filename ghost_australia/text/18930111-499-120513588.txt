GOLDEN GATE. A good attendance witnessed some fun and sport at the " Gate" on Saturday night. Charlie Sawford and Tom Wilson boxed a scientific bout of four rounds ; then Joe Pablo tried out a new arrival, who reckons he can fight a bit. He is a Samoan native named Bee, and is a sturdily built fellow. He got all he wanted from Pablo, and although he took his gruel in game fashion he was never in it, and hadn't the ghost of a show. In fact Mr. Bee was hopelessly " beaten" at the end of the first round, which will probably throw a damper on his fistic proclivities for the pre- sent. The big item in the bill consisted of a ten rounds contest between Tom Simpson and Bob Foran, the hard-hitting North Shore slugger. Foran had a bit the best of the weights, aud after a tough battle knocked Simpson out in the fifth round with a right- hander on the jaw, breaking his right hand middle finger in doing so.
