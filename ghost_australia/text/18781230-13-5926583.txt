MONDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1878. Without doubt, we presume, recent events will in due couise lead to an inquiry into the organisation of the police force of Victoria, with a view to an improvement in its arrangements and a change in its duties. Everybody must recognise that it is both a disgrace and a danger that the Mansfield murdorers should be at large. The escape of the man WIEBERG because the detectives' revolvers would not go off is another reflection upon the force, and assists to give strength to the feeling that there must be a change. We have men- tioned the source of the evil before, namely, the general yielding to the tendency which always exists to employ the police for other than police pur- poses. They have been called upon to inspect nuisances, to collect statistics, and'to see that children attend school, whereas their proper task, and ono which demands all their energy and at- tention, is to protect life and property and to"reprcss crime. Tho policeman of late1 years, it would seem, has developed inore and more into a civic officer. If stationed in the country, he is a towns- man still. ' For work among the fast- nesses which have become the haunt of muïderers and marauders we have evi- dently no adequate provision. An inquiry would be impossible just now, when there is work for every officer in the field, but still Ministers and the police authorities are called upon to consider whether the ordinary oflicial routine should not be departed from in the further pursuit of the Mans- field outlaws. Two suggestions have been made which commend themselves to the common sense of most men. One is the apprehension of the men and women who are suspected of giving aid to the criminals. The police must have spent their time badly if they have not a shrewd idea of wheie the food and information the outlaws receive como from, and a series of judicious arrests would be one means of breaking up the confederacy. The Greta district might bo rendered untenable, and if the gang could once be dislodged from that neighbourhood, it is incredible to suppose that they could find a population to screen or coun- tenance them elsewhere. Driven from their stronghold they must, as we should apprehend, soon be run to earth. The Outlawry Act was passed with the express purpose of giving the police power to act in this way, for it was recognised at ' once th.it the most important step to bo taken was to cut off the murderers from their supplies. But if this act cannot be worked, and if there is a difficulty in the way of suspending habeas corpus, other machinery exists. Under the Criminal Law and Practice Act, sec. 276, ac- cessories after the fact to murder are punishable by imprisonment for any term not exceeding 15 years. The Kelly gang have been proclaimed as murdeiers, and whoever succours them becomes an accessory to their crime. Arrests could bo made under this section, and remands could be ob- tained from time to time on the grounds that the principals were still at large, and that until their arrest the police were not prepared to go into evidence. Not only wrould there be a chance of rendeiing the district untenable if this course wero adopted, but as nearly all criminals are cowards at heart, there would be a fair prospect of some of the confederates, when they found them- selves in gaol, consenting to point out the KELLYS' haunts in order to save them- selves. A second suggestion, which presents no legal difficulty whatever, is that the authorities should at once enlist a num- ber of active bushman with local know- ledge to serve as troopers for the time. The call addressed to the men would be lo do their duty to the state, and we should apprehend that it would be responded to. The pay would of course be high, the prospect of rewind would be great, and the period of engagement would not be long. On such terms energetic station hands, with equal bush knowledge to the marauders, could, we should suppose, bo enlisted, and the skill obtained in tracking cattle could be turned to account in finding men. The force would then be strengthened iti the element in which it is admittedly deficient at the present juncture, and the public would have moro hopes than it has just now of the gang being met with. And the difficulty of meeting with them is the one obstacle. If the gang made its escape from experienced men it would scarcely bo without some loss, and once horses are disabled or men aro wounded tracking becomes comparatively easy. At all events we submit that the operations con- ducted up to date should be im- proved upon. The last step taken, to send up the local artillerymen to the range townships, was right enough so I far as it went, but it only amounted to protecting property which had been left unprotected, and did not directly strengthen the search. As the police failed to use these townships as traps, the only thing left was to defend them openly, but this is a negative and not an active measure, and action against the offendeis is what is rcquiied. Crime is only to be stamped out by punish- ment following offence as an absolute certainty, and the longer the gallows is deprived of its due in this case, the more encouragement is given to lawlessness in the ranges, and even-so widespread are effects-to larrikinism in the towns. Every citizen, we are sure, sees the need of fresh offorts to capture the murderers, which need not bo gigantic, but which should have a prospect of striking home. With regard to the detective force, the stricta es of our correspondent "Asmodeus" in our issue of Wednesday last will suggest the possibility of im- provement there. His charge is that secresy is never thought of, and that the authorities seem even to take pains to make the criminal class familiar with the detectives. Thus, while it is neces- sary that the detectives should seo all the prisoners at the Melbourne watch house, with a view of recognising them if there is anything against them in the past, or of identifying them with any offence in the future, it by no means fol- lows that the suspected criminal should be made personally acquainted with all the detectives. Arrangements by which the detectives could see without being seen could easily be made, and this our corre- spondent alleges is only one instance of stupidity in the management. It would not be just until after inquiry to impute personal blame. The circum- stances of the colony have greatly changed of late years. On the one hand our large cities have called into existence a class of crimes which have to be dealt with by an intelligence of one kind, and on the other hand rugged districts have been allowed to become the haunts of dangerous and desperate characters who require the employment of means of a totally different kind. The police force as a whole will have to bo adapted to the situation. We published on Saturday last a lotter from Mr. MOLESWOETH GREENE, in which he refers to some comments we recently made on the action taken at Bacchus Marsh, and Kyneton respec- tively with regard to meetings in sup- port of the " embassy." Our corre- spondent says that no comparison can be made between the two places, berause at one " an Opposition meeting " was almost an assured success," while at the other it was " an equally assured " failure." In noticing such an asser- tion1 we can only ask-Why are the two places so different1} Can any other reason be assigned than that there have been energetic mon in tho one place and none in the other? No doubt thero was a time in Kyneton when the party of moderation and order had an uphill fight, but they acted on the principle that "Faint heart never won fair " lad)," nor anything else that ro quires dash or industry, enerby or cirort, to carry it off Is there any other pnnciplo known to men that ever earned peoplo through difficulties to a gi eat end? Was it by keeping quiet and avoiding the clash of opinions that tho liberties of tho lintish nee were won?

An aiticle m the cuncut numbei of the NoUh Ama nan liuiew on "Hie " Goveminent of the United States,' from the pen of Di Hoitmo Scwiomt, invites attention, because while eluci dating and eulogising some of the best features of the American Constitution, it exhibits, by contrast, the îadical de fects of our own We suppose it will scaicel) be disputed that, m theoi) at least, the form of government m stituted by the foundeis of the Ko public is the most "populai that it was found possible to devise, and that it was destined, m the woida of WASHINGTON, to "exemplify the pre " eminence of free government by all " the attributes which could win the " aftection of its citizens, and command « the respect of tho woild ' In outer to attain these ends, what wa3 the animating principle and what the great object of the able and patriotic states man by whom the corni tution was so patiently and thoughtfully constructed? It was to provide against the establish ment of that worst of all despotisms the tyiauny of the majority, that majority bemg composed, as it necessarily is in all countues, no mattet what may be the average intelligence of its population, of the least well infoi mci, tho least îeflective, and the most im pulsive, excitable, and easily misled classes of society " The distinguishing " featuie of oui government, ' writes Di SrYMOun, "is that it is the only « orle which attempts to restrain and " check the pow er of ruajouties, although " that pow oi may bo acting m a°«>ia » with the populai will In other words, " it is the only government which at " tempts to protect the rights of mmou « ties and of localities against tho pov, er " of majorities, and for that, purpose it " has worked out apoLb-al organisation « unparalleled m any other country, or "m any other period of the worlds " history " In this colony the popular theoiy is that minorities have no lights, not even that of making themselves heard at i jpublic meeting or through the press, am that they ought to bo rigorously pro scribed, if not violently suppressed. Ii 31 out of tho 55 constituencies returnin; members to the Assembly the minority .-frequently numbering nearly as manj persons as the majority-is wholly unrepresented, and those districts whicl elect members boloiiging to the minority in the country aro actually punished foi so doing by the Government withhold ing from them their fair and legitimate ' sharo of the expenditure upon public works. They aro treated as serfs. Thoj must contribute to the general revenue, but they undergo the mortification oi witnessing the diversion of a portion oí that contribution to other localities which happen to be represented by political marionettes. In America the Legislature expresses the popular will, but the constitution arms each individual with defences against that will, and against the power of the Government which embodies it. For this purpose, tho judiciary has been placed abovo the executive and law making powers. "This," remarks Dr. SEYMOUR, " is tho great distinguishing " feature of our government, hi this " wo stand alone among the peoples of " tho earth." And the candidate for the Presidency who should venture to talk about bringing tho Supremo Coure of the United States "under the " heel of authority," might as well retiro into private life at once, and thus escape the execrations of a people who justly regard the inde- pendence and authority of the judiciary as the bulwarks of individual liberty. " If," continues Dr. SEYMOUR, " the " Parliament of Great Britain enact " laws with the assent of the Crown, " they must be enforced by the judi " ciary and the whole power of tho " kingdom, although they trample upon " every maxim hold sacred, or upon " every right of person or of conscience. " Thero is no remedy but repeal or " revolution. In this country, our " couits declare such law3 to be " void, and they will not enforce " nor permit thom io be enforced by " the Executive nor any other power, al " though they trench upon the rights of " but one citizen standing against the " whole people." And only whore some such safeguard as this exists can there bo true personal freedom and safety from the tyranny of the multitude. This tyranny is the great danger of modern times. All other forms may be com- bated; but this, when unrestrained, is vast, hideous, and irresistible, subject to fits of ungovernable passion, and to paroxysms of mad ferocity-blind, igno- rant, brutal, and remorseless. Another important check upon the absolutism of the majority in the United States is the constitution of the Sonate. This, thu most powerful branch of Congress, while it is co-ordi- nate with the IIouso of Representatives in matters of ordinary legislation, and can amend or reject money bills, has also the exclusive power of approving or of rejecting treaties, and of ratifying or disallowing some of the most im- portant appointments in the public ser- vice. And how is the Senato com- posed 1 Each state, irrespective of its magnitude and population, has two electoral votes ; and thus " about " one-fourth of the people havo as " many senators as the remaining three ,{l fourths, This inequality in principio, " if not in degree, was designed by the " framers of the constitution to keep ." the majority in check, and to protect '" the rights and interests of the states " having small populations. . . Tho " purpose in making the General Go " vernment one which does not strictly '" represent the people of the United " states was to protect minorities, " and to keep it within its con " stitutional limits." What follows is paiticularly woithy of attention at a time when it is proposed to make a revolutionary change in our own constitution by a mere majority in one Chamber, representing in its totality only 53'35 per cent, of the voters of the colony, and opposed by the unanimous voice of the other Chamber :-" This " purpose is shown more clearly in the " article about amendments, where it is " provided that no changes can bo made " in the constitution unless two-thirds " of the House and of the Senate " fhall propose them, and thon, in " addition, they are to be ratified " by three-fourths of the states. If " more than one-quarter of the states " object to an amendment, although " they are small states, with less than a " tenth of the population of the country, " it falls." In this way did the wise and far seeing founders of the Republic guard against rash changes, and impose salutary iestraints upon that "will of the people" which is deified by demagogues in this colony, and which it is also part of their insidious policy never to call into exercise until the popular mind has been first of all in- flamed by passion. MADISON, JEFFER- SON, ADAMS, HAMILTON, and JAY avowedly selected the English Constitu- tion "as their model, for the quarrel of the North American colonists was not "with it nor with England, but with the Government of the day, which had do parted from its principles by insisting upon taxation without representation. Yet they saw that in a democratic -condition of society they must engraft new principles upon an old stock. And Dr. SEYMOUR has clearly pointed -out what these are. They were intro- duced into the state constitutions also ; for, as he observes, " the whole course " of constitutional legislation, in all the " states, shows that the spirit and " genius of our politicol system tend to " check the power of majorities, either " acting directly or through their ropre " sc-ntatives, and to secure to each indi " vidual the rights of person, property, " and conscience." These would cease to exist in this colony if the power of the majority were rendered absolute, as is the undisguised aim of Mr. BERRY and his party. Every member of the minority would hold his person, his property, and his conscience permissu superiorum, these being superior numbers. To dissent from "the voice of the people" would be treason to its authority; to acquire property beyond a capriciously, variable limit would be regarded as felony ; and to hold views in religion, science, or politics which might not accord with those of the multitude would be reputed, perhaps, a capital offence. These, unfortunately, are not fanciful speculations. They would be the repetition of well known historical occurrences, and they may cease to bo moro possibilities unless every man who has any sort of stake in the country becomes alive o to the impressive fact that at such a grave emergency as this political activity is the first of duties, and political indifference the worst of crimes. The month which is about to close has been marked by more than the average number of failures and insolvencies. The "Berry blight,' to use tho expressive phrase of a correspondent, has of course fallen severely upon all blanches of industry and trade, but it is instructive to notice that the prominent victims are those who have enioyed the doubtful benefits of protection. The most important failure of the month was that of a clothing manufacturer, and amongst the others who have gone to the wall are a furniture maker and a fuse manufacturer. All of them havo enjoyed protection at the rate of 20 per cent., in addition to the natural advantages derived from the distance of competing markets and the cost of transit. In furniture, especially, the home manufacturer has been well served by the tariff. The import duty is 20 pel cent, not to speak of the fieight and other charges, which on some classes of goods bring up tho handicap on the imported articlo to something like 60 per cent. A manufacturer protected like this ought to make a rapid fortune, he should, at all events, be secured against loss, but it is found that when a pinch comes he is the first to collapse. His favoured friends in other departments of business keep him company, and how many are to to follow is the question which suggests itself. It seems as though the misgovernment from which tho colony suffers were operating as a practical test of the protective policy. We have depression, loss of capital, and diminished purchasing power. The protected trade, according to the popular theory, ought be best able to resist the shock, but the earliest signal of distress is exhibited in the quarter where there is most protection. Evidence is always better than argument, and we call the particular attention of protectionists to the facts which we have cited.

A curious feature of the affair was the indifference manifested to Professor Pearson whom the working members of the Liberal party appear to have agreed to treat as a nonentity. He was left to wander about helpless and forlorn, and the mail steamer probably never took away a more disconsolate and miaerable looking object than the second member of the embassy. The Australian and New Zealand mails of the current month for England and the East left on Saturday afternoon by the R M S S Assam. Amongst the large number of passengers who left by her besides the members of the embassy were Mr EPS Sturt (late city police magistrate), Mr Ormond, M Tollet (Iate vice-consul for France), and Mr D jones, formerly of Ballarat. Messrs Wheatleigh and Jack, actors were also passengers. The Assam took away treasure to the value of £469,384, consisting of specie to the amount of £314,300, and 12,320oz. 16dwt, 9gr. of gold valued at £121,284, from this colony, and 33,000 sovereigns and £800 in silver s[ecoe from Sydney.
