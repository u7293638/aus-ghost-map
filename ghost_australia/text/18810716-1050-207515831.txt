Twelfth' of July. Celebrations. THE LOYAL ORANGE INSTITUTION, OF NEW SOUTH WALES, JULY 10th. The annual religious service in connection with the above institution, was held in the Exhibition Building, Prince Alfred Part, on Sunday after noon, July 10th, 1881. Notwithstanding the threatening - appearance of the weather,, upwards of ' 12,000 persons wero prosent to render thanks ;to the' Great Joliovah, for his bountiful goodness shown to' us in our dolivery from popisll bon'dago : and slavery. The wrapt attention with which each minist'or was listened to by tho multitude, must indeed have beon gratifying to the brethren- of the Loyal Orange Institution. : : One incident in connection with this Sundny sorvice, and. which wo desire to draw special atten tion to, is that overy Protestant denomination was represented on the platform. , A- choir of four hundred voices; under the directorship of 'Mr. P. D. MoCormiok; with Mr." B. J. Vhillips as organist, led tlie singing. Too ,much praiso cannot'bo given to Mr. - IfcUormick - for the efficiency of- the choir, the singing- being - extremely good: v Mr. Phillips 'acquitted hiuiBelf as organist, in his usual brilliant style. The chair was taken by H. Hicks, Esq.;R;W'. G.M., ,on tho right of whom wero VV. Honson, Esq., M.P.jD.G.M., Rev. '1\ Si Eorsaith, Grand Chap lain, and N. J. Mackenzie, G.

Di\ Barry read-a scripture lesson, from tho 72nd Psalm. - » . Tho 'Rev. T. S:-Forsaith,<. Grand Chaplain; then delivored an addross, taking 'as -the basis' of his remarks- a- sentence out -of- thomessage -which Christ commissioned his belovod 'disciple 'John 'to send to the Church at'Pergamos — " To liirn 'that overcomelh will- I givo -.to oat 'of - the:; hidden manna:" -Revelations, 2 chap;, 17 v. What was written -aforetime .'.was written for- our' learning; and we are - authorised- to ; consider this - messago as addressed personally -to ourselves, 'sdn every ago: of: the world : and'-in : all BCotions -'of the Christian Church a -religious life has boon 'found to-be a warfare, a -fight of- faith-to be; followedby victory, a harvoBt to 'succeed the sowing..- What have we to contend against? For the words "him that overcometh" imply a struggle; if' there were no contest the words would be without - meaning. What, thon, have we to overcome ? In the first place, the evil in our own hearts. All the followers of the Lord Jbbus Christ have felt at timeB a weight at their hearts ; patriarchs, prophets, apostles, the univorsal Church, all believers, have wept over the same mournful truth, wo " have all sinned, and come short of tho glory of God." That ancient noble hymn, which may bo called the hymn of the universal Church, which we call the Te Deum , combines all the varieties of dovotionol meaning; it is as the sound of many waters, its tones at times can be compared to the awful roll of tho thunder, and' at times to the still small voice of conscience ; that noble hymn of faith, hope, and triumph has an undertone of sadnesB mingling with its gran d or" m ensures. You hear it in such words as theso "'Vouchsafe, O'Lord! to keep us this day without sin ;" " Oh Lord ! have mercy upon us." What are they but a confession of weakness and of pronenesB to sin, a sense of ' transgression and of our need, of the constant help and support of the everlasting arms ? Now the reason why the people of God have at all times confessed their- proneneBS to sin is, becauso thoy are alive uuto God; they are not dead in tresspasses and sins. In a state , ot naturo, a man docs- not 'enter this holy warfaro ; . ho is satisfied with himself ; but when tho Spirit of the living God enlightens his under standing, convinces him of sin, and 1'onovates all ' the feelings 'of his- heart, thon " he becomes sensible that there is a law in his members warring against 'the law in his mind. It is tho' most learnod -.man who is most , sensible ' ol' his ignorance. -'Discords jar more in tho ' ear of ' a sensitivo musician than on the ' ignorant -listener.- Men of honor are the . most susceptible to -the stains of dishonor; and mon who most lovo 'the truth most readily shrink from falsehood. And it is- thus in spiritual things. Whon tho Spirit of God enliglitcns a man, brings him out of a stato of nature into a stnte of grace, then he bocomcs sensiblo of the sinfulness of his naturo ; and tho deeper tho work of graco is in tho heart, the moro vivid is the conception of our own un- worthinoss. It was a Paul who could truthfully say, " For me to livo is- Christ ;" and who" said,' "I am -tho- chief of sinnors."' But - it 'is not enough that we' feel and acknowledge tho 1 evil ' that is in us ; we must' contend' against -if and : ovorcomo it. Tho Scripturesaro full of 'examples ' of mon who by tho - grace of God' havo' fought this good- fieht. and 'come off - victorious; Think of-'Peter : whon-our Lord 'first -suffered 'him to loavo his fishing-boats and'- nets,' and" for long' aftor, lie remained unstable as water, impulsive as a mountain torrent; but oventually he became J distinguished for steadfastness and humility. ' His' character undorwontsuch a' transformation- that it1 answered to the signification of the-name bostowed' ' upon him by'our L'ord-himsolf, "Thou art-Potor,' tho rock:" Or think of Paul, who is first intro duced to - us on the -snored" page as tho vory; impersonation of pride/ bigotry, self-will; and cruelty; and' yet- lio' lived to say, "T1 am loss than-the -least of' all saints." And in the case of 'ono- whoso wordsfo'rmmy subjoct to-day; atone' period of his discipleship; ' he .would -not have' scrupled' to make an entire, village.' a lolocaust by calling down fire from'lioavon- to consume the -inhabitants ; and yot he lived to write, "'Everyone -that'lovoth is born' of 'God; and. kuoweth God;- Ho that lovetli not knoweth not God/for God' is lovo." Then tho next thing wehave to contend' -against and ovorcomo is the world. If you- road ' the second chapter of Revelations, yoil wi-1 find ' that there arc allusions .to throe distinot 'olomonts - ofy opposition- to bo found in -tho -world'.- - First, false teaching. The Church 1 of ' Ephosus was commended because 'it sot - itsolf - to tlvo main-, tonance of 'a pure ministry and-rofusod to receive" and acknowledge thoso pretenders who said thoy woro apostles,- but wore not. Wohavo to contend' against that false, teaching which -emanates - from ; him- who exalts - himself ' above- all; that -is -called \- God's or that is worshipped as -His.. There arc two- wave of contending, against error ; - on is by direct- . warfare,- but in- all ordinary times "the .weapons of our ' warfare- aro not. 'carnal; but spiritual.'.' . There 'havo -been, times in the history of tho i Church-'- and" -the '.world,-' and' they moy occur again; when other- weapons huvo"to be'resortod1 i to,- and -if 'over in- the -providence" of-' God that time- should come, I trust - wo ' shall be found \- faithful, .shoulder to 'shoulder, ready to shed our ' blood andJ sacrifico our livesif- necessary 'in 'the defenco- of the Gospel -.of- truth: But there is . ariothor - -way -"of contending against,' error; by upholding 'and 'oxomplifying- the ' opposite -truth; "When the light of the glow-worm bogins to pale/' when- tho birds commenco to sing-in the -branches: of the -trees, when streaks of sunrise illumine the eastern horizon;-then- ghosts- nil -vanish : and so- with> -- error." - 'Error ' walks in - the darkness: of ignorance and superstition, and there is nothing liko tho light of- intelligence, 'piety, and' purity- of conduct for ridding ue of at. -'Error cannot stand' in' the presence of- truth.- But abuse is a- wrong weapon 'to use ; ' angry words: directed against errormaybe like boomorangs-which - recoil 'upon those-- who' send' them --forth, < but '-truth- wherf personally exemplified is a weapon- which cannot j, . U i : i . . !' ' fail. Secondly, wo have to contend against the spirit of the world. Have you never boon sensiblo of the powerful ' influcnco of' different moral atmoBphorcB ?' You go into some family circles, and you feel as if tho very spirit of worship pervaded the place, and you can kneel with' tho inmates of the house and delightedly lift up your hearts to God in praise. But there aro circles the opposite to this, households whore God' has no recognised place, and if you on I or such a" circle and attempt to pray, you feel' like a man who has lost his way, who is going -round' and round but making no progress. And oftentimes, ' combined with that spirit or godlbssness, there is ' the spirit of doubtful disputation. Men say, ' What is truth ? Who knows ?' Who can know P There is no form of error" more difficult1' to contend against than that: It-is like an infected '' atmosphere, and you oannot bronitho it without ' danger; ' Thirdly, we miist cbhtehd: against and 1 overeome the evil one who is cohtinually besotting 1 us. Our own- renowned- poet, Milton, in the ' ' fervour of genius, has investod the fallen archangel1 with a kind of halo of glory ; ho has- made him to appear like an infernal hero ; but the Bible, though full of' poetry, has not a particle of romance in its portrayal of him. It nlwa.-s makes 1 him what he is, an adversary;' and 'a deeeivor ;; malice, fraud/and all ovil qualities are ascribed to him. Ho is a to'mptor; and: as/in the caso of'our " " Lord and Saviour-Jesus Christ, ho "displapad - be fore him all the pomp and grandour of the king doms of this world, and said " fall' down and' worship me; and all shall be tlnno;"'bo ho now displays similar baits before the' eyes of the sons of men. It Ib true they are' phantom kingdoms, but thoy eeein to bo roal as he prossnts them, and alas many men do ; fall down and worship ; and having complied with' tho condition thoy tli'oh 1 expect the reward.1 "But1 tboy are disappointed, a horror of a great darknes3' supcrvonos, aud all the reward ' thoy get is the sound of the mocking voice of tho ' iiond as lie rotroats. Brethren, the question "for us to docido is, shall wo listen to the tempter and bo overcomo like the first Adam, or shall we' liko tlie second,' and ' in his grace and strength, resist tho tempter and'' overcome him ? " To him1 that ovorcometh, will' ; I givo to oat of tho hidden manna." There is, : . ; you see, a promise attached, which stimulates every warrior in the good fight of faith. The ' manna which sustained tlie people of Israol in' the wilderness is used as an example of the grace and strength which Christ imparts to all who fight' under His banner/and whioh' aro known only to thoso who receive them. -It is hiddon manna ; nature has her own faco/patont to tho observation of all/but it is not ovory ono who understands its expressions. For mstanco, the law of gravitation was written" over the whole face of naturo and might-have beon -seen there at'nny timo sinoo tho creation; but it required a giftod' philosopher to' discern in the falling of tho apple the fingor that .. pointed to it. The 'attributes of God; the gran deur of 'His power/ the breath of His goodness, tho scope of His wisdom, nil thoso aro inscribod as it wero openly on all the things around us; they maybe read- in liquid lottors on tho bosom of the mighty'deep, in craggy characters on the ' face of the vast b'vorhangihg rocks and boetling cliffs, in lotters'of homely utility in' the corn fields that- wavo on tbib 'plaihs/ ini lottors of ' exquisite beauty in the flowbrs that drink 'the pearly drops of the gracious dew, 'ih'thb forest trees thiit' stand ' liko giants arm: in arm, in tho rainbo ;v that adorns ' the 'thunder cloud, in the' lightning flash of ' the storm, and in tlie great firmament sparkling with in numerable stars ; tbeao are all opon secrets, so to speak; rovoaling- the bonefic'onoo 'of tho great Creator.- I3ut thoy aro not heedod or road by all.' Though thoy aro the open volumo of creation, .which prophets; poots, and artists can' read, yot tho majority of- men' pass thorn by unhocdcd. Tho ' same with religion: That divino onergy by whicli jtho hearts and minds- of.' mon- aro tutored and' : trained- to holy deeds — that poaco which results from a conscious reconciliation- with God through ! faith 'in Josus Christ — that consolation which grows out of a- spirit of filial 'roverenco, lovo, obcdienco— -the o aro all, so to spoak, tho open socrots of 'roligion-; but thoy are. revealed to com paratively but few. Prophets have spoken of them, psalmists -have sung of thom, our Saviour him- solf declared that they shbuld be onjoyod 'by his -followers; 'the- apostles- testified to their reality,' land multitudes of dying men have bleasod God ' ifor tho possession- off thom' and have spent thoi/ 'last'breafh- proclaiming "their 'valuo; but still , theso -things'- are hidden' from '-rtho proud, the worldly/ the impure, and tlio disobedient ; they -have oyes but see not, their hearts bccomo gross : and they do not understand, "'the natural man re- ' coiveth- not the things'of the1 Spirit of God ; for ; they are foolishness' unto himY' noithor can ho, know them, because they nre spiritually discerned." , What- shall 'we -do, then ? Ono tiling is certain j if -we -would engage in this holy warfare and, overeome, we are absolutely dependont upon tlie grace' and strength of Jesus Christ. Lot us turn these truths -wo have been considering into prayer. Oh; Saviour !' we feel our need of Thee ; without Thee we can 'do nothing J as the' lifeblood circuv lates - through ' every vein and vessel ' of1 these natural bodies,' which are bo fearfully and won derfully made, so' do.

The first-weapon is proclaiming liberty; of consoiencq,,and the ,-untrammelqd: exerr.j ciso of. the huinan will.. . This great > trutli, was connoctod, with the life of . our first parents in the garden of .Eden. ,It came .down tolatev days, fpr, wo. read, that Joshua said to the peppie, " Chooso . ye this day, whom ye will servo." find Isaiah saying, "If.yq bo willing. an.ft.o(hcdient y;e shaft ea . tlio good of; the, land: but .if .yq rqfuse> and rohol ye shall ; be , .devoured with the . sword ; , for, the', mouth of tho Lord hath /spoken it.",.. Coming:, .down to ;pur ,New...Testamont we ..find tliis.graud /doctrine' .permeating tho whole, of, its teaohings. We may then, safely use. this. .weapon, seeking to proclaim and stand by liberty of conscience, and the untrammoled exorcise of the liuman : will. Wo know there is that; Goliath /enemy, .which, wo see |and„meqt,onf.oypry. banc, ,the;euerny of liberty and /light, which pvoftssosrto . bo,. Christian, hut. is 'more heathenish than Christian, , professes to give liberty, but is, a. tyrant, which is dishonoring to God and rinsulting and dograding. to man. . Another weapon,- is 'the. dissemination of the word :ofGod. Th ore is, but /one., hook in the, whole world which bears upon it the , imprimatur of God jhimself, which whoreror .it :goos, carries light and .'liberty, and tlio blessings of freedom. Wo must take that book,, remembering that ,by, it .wo shall have our liberties: and, blessings. hero and, all the : blessings'- mankind' .can enjoy in timo-and for. ever-.. : more., Another weapon we may. use .is, preaching !tlie Gospel of Christ. . The. teachings.of the great -i Goliath! enemy are opposed to tho teaohings of the; I Gospel. of Christ. Wo have in this .Gpspol . the; j good news' of salvation, lyithou t money andjwithout i price.:;,, W readj wo understand,- , wo. admit the ; glorious truth that Jesus Christ shed His precious; j blood -.-for, .us, /'redeemed us to God, and only ' through the death, sacrifice,- and modiation of our | Lord Jesus.Ohrist, wo find tho pardon 'given to ns ! by God himself ; a pardon no, man can .ever pur- j chase by giving, money, ;to a corrupt priesthood.i Thank God, wo go to the court of heavon /for, it, 1 wo ask tlioro the' forgiveness of our sins, and it is ! hostpwed upon.us by God/for the sako and through ! the . mediation :|of, His Son. , Wo must use this ! weapon, . the Gospel; of , Jesus. .Another weapon. ! wo employ, is tho personal work of; God tlio .Holy, ; Ghost, i, by ...God /the. 'Diviuq Spirit, that precious i blood of Jesus, which cleanses from .all, sin, /leads to a reriewal/of, heart, /and .makes us spiritually minded, sor, vants of..,God.' ; , ; . ti:. .
