SOME FUNNY TRANSLATIONS. One account of the late German Emperor's funeral, writes David Ker in Harper's Weekly, stated that the sermon was preached on a text taken from "the Book of Jacob"—a hitherto unknown portion of Holy Writ—the real words being the "Epistle of James" (Jakob). An English translation of a German novel ren dered " Ich habe einen Gast bekommen" (I have Sot a guest) by " I have become a ghost." .nother transformed " food for reptiles" into " the Diet of Worms." In a Frenoh version of " Guy Mannering" the phrase of " a stiokit minister" (unsuccessful preacher) figured as " une ministre assassini." Nor are the titles of books a less fruitful field of mistranslation than their contents. A Vienna transla tion of George Eliot's "Felix Holt, the Radical." was entitled "Felix; Hold the Rascal!*• The play of "Love's Last Shift" was reproduced in Paris as "ia Derniere Chemise de VAtnour." "Rob Roy" still figures in Russia as "Bob, tha King," r *Boy" having been oonfueed with " Boi." A auaOar mis eonoeption turned " Memoires de Boy d'Argent" into " Memoirs of a Silver King"—aa exploit almost rivalling that of the farmer who named a pet rooster "Robinson" because he "crew so." But the palm of mistranslation is cer tainly dne to au Englishman who some years ago came to a foreign teacher to be " finished" in German, and was asked to write a sentenos in colloquial English, and then to translate it. He wrote: "He has bolted, aad has not settled his bill;" translating it by, "Er hat verriegelt, tind hat nicht einsiedelt semen B:hnabel." " Verriegeln" meaning "to bolts, door," " einsiedeln" to " settles** a colonist, "and "&A;*aW'the"bmofabird." Thisextraor dinary sentence really signified: "He has driven in a bolt, and has not colonised his beak."
