HAMLET RE-CKEATED. Ami the man that did it was Bferbohm Tree, the most ini|>ers<>iiil and versatile of all our actors. Ifnwl'f. the mtsprakable Dine, Ins of late years been dime to death by ambitious artists who successively have replied to the " To be" with “not to be." The sight of Wilson Barrett disporting his cumbrous length on the steps of the throne, ami soliloquising before a Vriuce.se s audience was not olio to forget easily. 1’our bested Dane, he has indeed sulfered llie “slings and armtvs of outrageous"—actors. But Mr. Beerbohm Tree has bid the dead hones live, and the manes of Shakespeare are appeased. There was a splendid first night audicnee in the Havniarket on the Thursday the play opened. Mr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the role admirable. 1/nm'rt's underlying love for Ophelia u beautifully accentuated by tone and glau&'. The bouse *as moved cn mane at the I end of the second act, when bending ovt i his tablets by the red tire, Hamlet cries. '* The play's the thing, wherein I’ll catch the * «>um irnee of the king.” In the tilth act the cliurchy.ud is a spring varterre of blooms, a new remit ring, and thither Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The fencing seem with kiertes is a magnificent piece of intellectual grasp, shown in the actor's expression and acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and leads his treachery. * Then again, Mr. Tree’s subtlety shows its jnnvor. Mrs. Tr»e makes a charming Ophelia, delicately as well as j strongly given. Mr. Arthur Pacre, as Horatio, also ! secured'a triumph, ami Mi . Fernandez, as Ghost, ami > Mr. Fred Terry as Laertes were generally successful. Shakespeare this season at the Hay market will not spell ruin. __
