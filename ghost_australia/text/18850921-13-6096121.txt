LRCTURB 'FOR TUR GORDON MEMO JUAL FUXD. " WAGNER AND HIS WORKS " On the BUbject of ' Viagner and his Works " Mr Otto Linden gave n lecture w ith musical illustrations m aid of the ' Gordon Memorial Fund," at the Independent-hall, on Saturday night, in the presence of Lady Loch and a largo audience the lecturer en deavoured to bring before his audience the "dauntless cner"yof the man, his courage under repeated defeats, and his resolute de tcrmmatio"n to give to the world the mess ige he felt called upon to deliver, come what might" Mr Linden acknowledged his indebtedness to various sources, from which ho quoted largely It was pointed out that at the ane of 11 Wagner was well read in Greek and Latin, and had made some study of the pianoforte, but according to lus own showing he never beeame a pianoforte plojer Tired by a study of Shakspearc, he produced a trogedj, of which ho sajs, "It was a kind of compound of 'Hamlet' and 'King Lear,' the design being grand in the extreme Forty two per- sons died in the course of the piece, and want of living characters compelled me to let many of them re appear as ghosts in the last act" Ho composed music to his own tragedy after having heard Beethoven's incidental music to Goethes "Egmont" At the age of 21 he became conductor of an operatic troup at Magdeburg, and in 1S39, after his marriage, he filled a similar post at Riga, on the Baltic. Here was conceived the idea of his opera "Rienzi," destined for the grand opera, Pans, and on his journey to the last named city, vtd London, he learned the legend of the " rijmg Dutchmon," which he afterwards embodied in musical form In Pans he spent three j ears of miserable drudgery, in the midst of which he, neverthe less, succeeded in completing his " Rienzi " and tho 'Tlying Dutchman " "Rienzi" marked thecompletionofWagner'sfirstpenod With the "rijing Dutchman" Wagner entered on a new stage of d-Volopment Tor the full appreciation of his *vast schemes ho looked to tboso to come, and his inven tions w ere ironically termed the music of the future It was during lils stay in Pans that Wagner became acquainted with the story of Tannhauser Hie lecturer described at length the original legend, and such modifi- cations a* were made in it by Wagner to adapt it to his purpose. He dwelt graphically upon the scene near Eisenach in central Ger many, where stands the Castle of Wart burg and the Venus mountains, and then eulogised Tannh mser as having contributed more to the spreading of the author's fame than any of his other works. 'Hie overture w aa a masterpiece of its kind, and the key note of the drama itself. " Tannhauser" was performed for the first time at Dresden in 18.5, mid was followed three j ears later by "Lohengrin" Mr Linden referred with special point to the meeting of Wagner with 1 ran_ L>n/.t, and to the beneficial m fluence upon the geniuB and fortunes of v\ npner which resulted from that friendship A brief history wasgiv on of the "Nibelungen," 'lineingold," "'Hie Walqure," " Instan and Isolde," mid " The master singers of Nürn- berg ' During the time when these colossal works wero in progress many pamphlets and literary works came fnm the Bame in defatigable pen In 1855 Wagner conducted , the Philharmonic Society in London, and met with the pronounced approval of the Queen and Prince Consort but not with that of the press and geneial public. I rom that time forward, however, Ins career was one of unbroken and brilliant success 'Hie lee turer briefly referred to the encouragement given to the composer by Ludwig, King of Bavaria, and the various Wagner societies founded throughout Germany mid in Milan, Rome, London, and New *i ork, winch li d to the building of the Wagner Theatre in Beyrouth which was opened in presence of the Emperor of Germans in August, 1876. Wagner died of heart disease in Venice on the 13th of Peb mary, 1883, and was buried at Beyreuth In concluding, Mr Linden remarked that " Wagner's thought is universally intelligible, because he deals with the universally human. 'Niobe' in sculpture, 'Othello' in drama, 'The Messiah ' in oratorio, in opera 'Fidelio,' in musical drama 'Tannhauser'-these require no comment The love of all women is in Elsa, their jealousy and revenge in Ortund, the despair of all noble and blighted natures is in Tannhauser, their chivalry and thirst for action in Lohengrin Each character resumes as it passes tho whole of what is true and always true of human nature in situations eternally recurrent" The music of the first act of "Tann- hauser" was creditably rendered, the over ture was plajed by Mr Linden and Mr A Morrison, the latter of whom is an accom pbshed amateur 'Hie arrangements a quatre mains for the pianoforte necesssanly lacked the high colour and elaborate development of an orchestral performance, but it come} ed an intelligible idea of the composer's meaning The part of Venus was sung by Miss Frede rica Mitchell, the Shepherd Boy, by Miss L.
