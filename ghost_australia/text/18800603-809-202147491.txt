TIIE KELLY GANG. BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH By our own reporter. Benalla, 2nd June. The excitement in Benalla occasioned by the report that the Kelly gang had been seen in the vicinity of Beechworth, has quite sub sided to-night. The remainder of the police who went out have returned. There is no doubt whatever that the gang were seen near Mrs. Byrne's farm. Mrs. Byrne is the mother of one of the gang. The name of the person who saw the Kellys will not be revealed by the police, but it is quite evident that something has occurred. The party of police who proceeded to the Wool- shed searched several houses and then divided, one party coming back to Benalla whilst another party scoured the ranges near Greta, where it is believed the gang has been living. At and around Greta the police have been on the watch. Numbers of the force are constantly to be seen in disguise passing along the bush- tracks making inquiries and searching dili gently for a trace of the outlaws. Superinten dent Hare arrived in Benalla this morning,and his presence here for a short time increased the excitement that was previously prevailing. Later in the day, however, it was understood that he had been transferred to Benalla to relieve Assistant-Commissioner Nicholson. Some little dissatisfaction was expressed at the change, it being the opinion that Mr. Nicholson would outmanmuvre the outlaws. Three months back it is stated that he very nearly succeeded in capturing the gang. Every person in the district is remarkably reticent on tho subject of the Kellys. The sisters are still living at Greta, and draw their stores from the estab lishment of Mrs. O'Brien. Greta is now only the ghost of its former self, the land in its vicinity having been greatly reduced in value in consequence of the fact that so much cattlo- duffing has been done in the district.
