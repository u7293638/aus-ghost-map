CUI BONO? ' I The lapse of a rocnth from the time the reward was first oftered shows that the discovery 'v^as ] not the result of any increased activity, stimula ted by that means. From the day that the Go vernment took the. matter up the local police 1 were, no doubt, assisted in their efforts by many j of the residents, v^bose interest in the matter ] would naturally bavo been very great. The area of the crime, so to speak, was so small and so 1 ©pen, while the persons in any way connected j with it were sc few and so well known that the task of discovery Gught to have been an easy 1 one; but for tbc-f-e very reasons, perhaps, it be- ; came difficult. In two recent cases we have \ seen how quickly 'a mysterious disappearance' was accounted for without the aid of native trao- I kers, and in country whieh might well have de- j £ed the most active search for some considerable j time. In Fisher's ease 1t may be taken for granted that there was no want of intelligence cr activity in prcsecuting the search, and that every j part of the iK\ighi-orhood which promised to yitfd I up the dreadful secret had been carefully examin- j ed before the end of October. His sudden die- j appearance was the topic of daily talk in Sydney, j as weil as in CaiEjrbeUtown; and among those fl ?who took the liveliest interest in his fate were I Mr. Daniel Cooper and 'his solscittbr, Mr. James i Nerton, at whose instance, proibaibly . arising from a conviction that he had been murdered by Wot- ' rell, the Government jwas induced to act. But, after all, -xnut is a ghost? ? G. B. B.
