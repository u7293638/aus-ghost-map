Our Bishop was up here a day or two seeking some ' money for. the repairs of onr church, how! much did thoCharters Towers " Trne Blues J* contribnte! A friend of mine tells the H<«t! mots thonfonror fiwe of them gave any- ' "S-Shmg, and that this "Trne Bine " who talks of 1 virtues as an Oifuigeman, when he sees the «ntebr|Diis round the seats, plate in hand, he (" Trne Bine") .took fright, arose, and hooked it, that is the way he supports the cfcnrfi. Doonan would not do that, neither wonld "Native.'" This creature likes popu larity on the cheap. Bat tbey say wb are loyal to the Constitu tion. What Constitution7 Why, the British. O ghost of Macaulay be not angry with these poor simpletons. Why they dont know a \ thing abont it, not a wotd in the book. Why, if I were * strict Orangeman lifea "Trne Bine" I shonld ask by what authority the! English Government imposed an Heirarchy on j Scotland -against , the will of the people of Scotland-tills In the *^ery teeth of. "True Bine's" Glorions Constitution. I wonld ask' * "why did England pi ise & Catholic Vice-Royal over India; that noble act-Emancipation made it legal to appoint a Biwhi Catholic to to be a Governor but not to be a "Vice-royalty. The Constitution forbids endowment to the Church of Rome-what - about the Catholic Colleges ? what about Roman Catholic chap lains in the navy ? I conld go on enumerating in this way for two hoars. Now, I call all these things right and jbst, but then I am like 'Doonan, not constitutional. Hello ! " TVue Bine," wake op man, yon have slept till yoor -Glorions Constitution has been stolen. Wake up man, yon have been holding on to nothing. On my honor, Mr. Editor, Doonan and myself are right a&er; all, they ate mad, especially Biddy Moriarty alias " True Bine." O, " Trne Bine " answers, " we support the i^it of property," of coarse yon do we know, ?Oiaagemen are faithful to the claims of the landocracy ; these men have several thntxBands .. per year, they need not wort, there are many objects gained by that, first, it keeps such mp as '' True Bine " {not all Orangemen by any means) in mmd of a enperior being, it gives them a chance to pull off their hats to show .what brains they have got; secondly, it' gives them b chance to send these freebooters to Parliament to tax them and pass emblem acts and party procession acts to enable them to cram their own beloved Orangemen into gaol, to wit, Johnson of Bellikillbtg, bat the Lord ehapteneth those he loveth-I fear I shall be taken for Doonan if I quote scripture, well let tube dope with Europe and her hatired^ Jet us see if the -Orangemen df Austra lia are what they gammon to be, let us take Queensland and we tow these " True Bloes " have acquitted tt«teel?es, how they have defended their glorious constitution, do they know that it is not constitutional to pass and confirm any act of Parliament, in any other place than that appointed by the crown. Do thj conaUUitioual Trne Bines " not know that some of the acts of last session were passed ootside the L^sutive Chamber. Tell *ne "Tirt»e Kne" wh*t proof have you or your hrethem givcn, that yoor or they were not parties to tiie beading underfoot yonr much, thiBtoo was' ' m^i who in their very heart demise yon, a selfish aqnatting ologarchy.
