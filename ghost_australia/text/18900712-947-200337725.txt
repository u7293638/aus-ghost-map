I was unable to answer this, and we turned to more profitable topics. . In another locality I was chatting to an old pioneer, a type of that sturdy old British stock that so often puts us colonials to shame, and a question led to a conversa tion of which the following gives the pith : — lasted— . - ,...'??'.' .

I am now.Epeak ingof the general run of coast lands, and not of such; exceptional, districts' as, the Montagu, which is phenomenal, for its potato crops. Last year a settler . there showedme a.30-acre paddock, put of, which he had Eold 300, tons, at .£3 per ton, and had an ample supply left for theiise of his family and for seed. His crop yielded.about 12tbns to the.acre;' '.''..''. ,,.!

But I -have -seen it asserted that the standard of :prosperity of .an agricultural -community must be gaugedby the amount ,of breadstuffs it grows, and: a community, that docs not: grow. ; wheat .enough for its^ own use must be 'going to the dogs.' Now I can prove ,to .you' by -statistics that on: ?the North-West Coast the acreage under, .wheats crop, ' is .: less , to-day than it was] fifteen, or twenty, years age, and if. the: itheory quoted: be, true; then it is impossible; the Coast cari;be progressing.' ; . ; . j \- .

Of , course' there ,are other lines that are profitable,; but that is the main crop.' I--.,..- : ' But if ,y oil are going-.to buy your wheat and flour you may be purchasing them1 from the 'barbaric Hindoo' whoworkB for threepence a day.' :; , -.: : i ,. ? .. : 'What has that to do with us, provided; we can grow something thatpays.us better, and, enables us to buy from, him or the South Australian farmer ? You are quite correct in your, assertion that we used to grow more wheat than we donow, but that was because we, were fools. ;We had not1 then learnt that; this coast is not suited to wheat culture, that the grain produced is soft,, and will, only command an inferior1 price, while the soil and climate are eminently , suited for root crops.- A few; farmers on the Coast still cling to wheat, but one ' of the foremost, a resident of the Forth, recently told me he felt it was a mistakej'i and he should not jpersevere any longer. '' Look at-1-:— ^whoi when he came' here, set up a flour mill. Why, there was no wheat to keep it going, and it proved a dead loss to him. No, bir, this coast can raise more of certain products than it can consume, and our nearest and best market is the adjacent colonies, where, if we can only get intercolonial free-trade, our superior soil and climate, and the higher yield per acre, will enable us to hold our ; own against all comers.' „ ' , ; Here was another impracticable sub- , ject, and other conversations proved he, was! , better versed in ,th~e principles of free- trade than myself. ,On the principle of audi alterant parteni, I must record acouple of ! conversations with protectionists. The first wanted intercolonial free-trade, and re gretted Melbourne was not as free a poru as Sydney for our staple products. But he had been misled by ,' clap trap,' and strongly; objected to the ' barbaric Hindoo' coming here to work for threepence per day,. . or to the Chinese immigrating ; in ,horde3 to oust us from every; 'branch of agricultural or industrial: employment. I pointed out that the gentle Hindoo could not work for tbieepenue a day in a land where rice, his sttple food, was 5d per lb ; that the cliu ate would not suit him, that he hadnever desired to leave the tropical soil of India, and that if he did come my friend, who had been growling at the scanty supply of European farm labour at £1 per week and rations, would promptly, engage twenty Hindoos if he could get them for eighteehpence a week each. I pointed out that the Chinaman (whom he had seen) was like the Hindoo, unable to compete on open terms in manual labour with the European, arid that if you had to board five Chinamen or Hindoos to do the work of one white man, there was no profit in the transaction. It was, however, useless to argue with him. He had been impressed with the idea that the Hindoos and Chinamen were coming to Tasmania to oust all white labour, arid ruin the farmers, and- as he could not dis tinguish between a real ghost arid a turnip with a candle in it, backed up by a white sheet, I had to leave him unconverted., '..I obtained, however, a curious glimpse of|the ' bogy'V which was troubling him at another township. In 'conversation with one of the best, known residents of the Coast, ;for whom personally I entertain a high' respect and' warm' regard, the subject of protection arid free-trade cropped up in connection with the then recent debate between Henry George and Treriwith(an ex? Ta smanian) . I was told flatly I was utterly mistaken in my views of the real aim and objects of protection. It was in vain I. quoted from the writings of all, the sup posed apostles' of . prbtectiori in Tasmariia^ t' was utterly mistaken. ' The true aim and bBj^st. of .proteotion-fnever'. mind! what tHbae'' ignorant and misguided- apostles asserted— was the elevation of the people, the maintenance of the highest possible physical and moral standard. This could only be obtained by the exclusion of races likely to lower that standard, suck as the ';barbario Hindoo' and the Chinaman, and this was the true principle and essence of protection, never mind what so-called' protectionists advocated. I chewed this over, and reviewed the writings of ThoB. Hogarth, Normnn Cameron, 'Elector,' and others, the leading (?) articles of tho renegade, protectionist journal, and other .'matters, and came to ' the conclusion that this subject was too deep for me. -I began to appreciate tho contention of 'A.B.B.' that you never know what the. principles of protection really are : it is like hitting a .straw, ,man j you knock; him. down and next minute he is up again &b; lively as ever. There is, however, one matter , I was assured upon, namely, that the principles of free trade have taken deep root upon :the N.W. Coast, and that the consistent advocacy of those principles by the- Launceston Exami ner for the last half century has not been 'labour in vain.' : . '....? ? ^
