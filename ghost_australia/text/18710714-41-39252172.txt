of the distances, as trill be better under stood by the study of the following:— According to the dates given a simple calculation gives — 1, sun's semi-diameter = ft = 444,340 miles ; 2, sun's distance = e = 95,288,300 miles ; 3, apace pasaed through by the earth is one minute of time = 1138*3 miles. For the questions 4 and 5 the application of the calculus becomes neces sary:— Let p represent the space passed through by the falling earth ; v = velocity ; t = time (in minutes) ; g = velocity at the end of the first minute in distance «, then accelerating velocity at distance e — p = | / t \ - dv ( e ydp -A ?

In the, case in question p is to be equal to e, which gives finally t = ^^\\-\ ? (2). Formula (1) gives the time for any value of p, and may be applied in other similar cases. The value of g will be found = 0*01342 miles per minute, and thus t = 64* 23* 54W or very nearly 65 days. The final velocity will be = 23,364 miles per minute (by formula above).— J. C. Hansen. NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE. The new problems, &c;, sent by the fol lowing contributors are acknowledged with thanks :— A. D. Nairae, Thomas Hallis, H. \V. Torode, Eliaha Seaman, Mentor, R. S. K. Problem 1,265. There would probably have been more answers to this problem but for a misprint in the author's illustrative answer. Problem 1,284. The answer to this question is calculated by ' Kapunda' on the assump tion that the ball falls 16^ feet in the first second of time. The force of gravity slightly increases towards the equator, consequently no universal unit can be laid down. Zero.— Our correspondent E. J. C. has, we think, answered more problems since 'The Piddler' was started in June, 1868, than any two other contributors. F. S.— The letter e was omitted in error. QUIPS AND CRANKS.-NO. XXXIII.

She was to me a thing of beauty; Love beguiled me like a spell, As oft she rested on my shoulder, Oftener than 1 eare to tell. Her stock was one I might be proud of— Ancient, firm, unyielding, fine; Further back than England's peerage E'er could trace their noble line. Her locks, how soft the sunlight touched them, Bright were they to every eye; How oft my loving fingers smoothed them When to my burning cheek so nigh. Her caps so neat and nicely fitting, Her bands arranged with such a'n air When, as she leant upon my bosom. Could I deem her aught but fair. ' Oft in moonlight we nave wandered Through the woodland's silent shade,' She within my fond arms resting, Light her graceful figure weighed. Her voice, oh! how it raised the echoes. Ringing forth, so sweet and clear; Dearer far to me than music I could ever chance to hear. She'd none but me to love and tend her, Tender love I lavished o'er My Minnie,'for I prized her highly, Prizes she has gained a score. We've seen danger in our rambles, Minnie never left my side; Oft in peril she was foremost, Keeping with me in my stride. Once a traitor soldier met me, Levelled rifle at my head, ^innie in a single second Shot the coward villain dead, for that deed I've often blessed her, None shall with her trifle long; In fact, since ever I possessed her, My Md»ie Rifle ne'er went wrong.
