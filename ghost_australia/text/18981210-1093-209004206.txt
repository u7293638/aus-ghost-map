THE HOUSE OF JACK SHEPPARD. Despite the fact (says an exchange) that the house known as Jack Sheppara's in Wyeh-street, has been doomed more than once, and a few _ months since was said to be included in the drastic Strand improvement scheme, workmen are busily engaged in restoring the quaint old house in Wyeh-street, in which Wood, the carpenter, to whom Jack Sheppard was apprenticed, is said to have lived and car ried on his business. The house is a double-gabled one, with overhanging upper floors, and is situated on the south side of the street, immediately opposite the gate way of New Inn. It has been closed for a long time past, and given over to rats and ghosts, but, much to the astonish ment of the neighbors, a new tenant has been discovered, and the old house is be ing so transformed that it will hardly know itself. It therefore seems that Harri-j, ' son Ainsworth's exciting romance of Jack and his daring deeds is to be perpetuated for a while longer. How thrilling is the section of the story that deals with the old house. "In the pleasant month of June, 1715," writes Ainsworth, "it chanc ed that Air. Wood, wno had been absent on business during the greater part of the day, returned 'nerhaps not altogether unde signedly) at an earlier hour than was ex pected to his dwelling in Wyeh-streec, Drury- lane, and was about to enter his Jack Sheppard's House, Wych-street, Strand. workshop, when, not hearing any sound of la'nor issue from within,_ he began to suspect that an apprentice, of whose habits of industry he entertained some doubts, was neglecting his employment. 'Stand ing on cip-toe, on a joinc-3tool, placed upon the bench, with 'his back to the door, and a clasp- knife in his han'd, Jack, instead ot executing his appointed task, was occupied in carving ms name upon a beam over head." â€¢
