LITTLE FOLKS. LITTLE PITCHERS. [By John S. Adams.] Little pitchers whose ears are long Shall be the burden of my song; frolicsome boys and laughing girls With rosy cheeks and clustering curls, With eyes of black and brown and blue, ; Who so worthy of song as you, "Little pitchers?"; Would father a secret of state confide To a chosen comrade, true and tried ? Has mother something of moment deep Too weighty for her alone to keep ?— Of quiet nooks they may well beware, forVithout a doubt they are listening there " Little pitchers." Little pitchers ask questions queer t That sometimes cause us to quake with fear.; Little care they for hint or frown— Like Banquo's ghost they will npt "down;" Words that are icy and looks that freeze Alike are wasted oh rogues like these— ; "Little pitchers." "Little pitchers" remember well, . And their fearful tales they are sure to tell, Be it later or be it soon. Always at moments inopportune, frightful phantoms with twinkling-feet, Beautiful, horrible, terrible, sweet.. " Little pitchers 1" . -
