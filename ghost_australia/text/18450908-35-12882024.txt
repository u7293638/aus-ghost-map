It was, in truth, a debate for the country to be ashamed of A discussion more discreditable and damaging to the landlord order has not occurred seen during the present session Not a reason, for a decent apology and substitute for a reason, was alleged against the simple request of one colony to share an indulgence already granted to another line obvious piece of [ justice was refused, not because there was any real i doubt about its justice, nor because any human being would run the shadow of a risk of being injured by it-but, first, because Australia is not Can class which is as true, and as much to the point, as that Australia it not Note Zembla and next, because the " agricultural mind a sensitive, unsettled, and much given to "panic A measure of the clearest light, and the most finds suitable expediency in which some thousands of loyal British subjects, who are busy on the other side of the world, engaged in a great national enterprise, have a deep practical interest, is rejected out of regard to fears that are confessedly grounds SS, and apprehensions that are as palpably absurd as they are sordid selfish The I Legislature has, almost avowedly taken its rule of action from fancies rather than from facts the case the interests of a valuable colony are sacrificed, not to the interests of any person or class elsewhere, but to a mere chimerical terror which nobody professes exactly to feel for himself, but which everybody feels on be half of every other body The national police j of" tr alting our colonies as integral parts of " the empire is given up, because landlords say the farmers are afraid of ghosts Instead of " agricultural interest which has at least the merit of morning something real and tan gible we have got now, as the basis and rule of h "'isle tion, the assumed ' sensitiveness of the " agricultural mind ' As regards the bearings of this decision of the House of Commons on the general interests of the free trade question, we scarcely know that one need view it with regret It certainly will not tend to arrest that process of public conviction which has been going on with such extraordinary rapidity and the beginning of the present session The corn he is implicated in it more deeply than ever, in the odium and contempt resulting, to any cause, from an absurd and unscrupulous acre each The reject tion of such a motion as Mr Hutt s is likewise most damaging to the landlords cause, as it exposes the insincerity of the stock landlord ure intents, and spoils them for future service As Mr Hutt mail showed, the ordinary defences of the corn Un me quite unavailable against the particular measure proposed by him Men who are ill belli be in the ability of the press for the corn law ought to support such a measure, as Sir Walter James and Captain Rous actually did No thing can be more palpably for the interest of the " British agricultural labourer,' according even to land lord notions, than a measure tending to facilitate proof able emigration, not to add that the age culturists of Australia are as much a part of the British agricultural interest as those of Essex Nor can anything more directly conduce to give us tile so desirable independence of foreigners than arrangements for raising, on British territory, the extra supplies which the United Kingdom needs We confess, however, that he rcgrettholnjustico done to a deserving body of British subjects, far more than we can rejoice at seeing the 1 legislature bring a bad law into contempt, at the a cost of its own character It is really a hard and cruel case Monopoly will neither let these men The at home nor abroad It first drives them from their until 0 country by artificially narrow in, the field for the application of cupit ii, and spoiling the market for labour, and then, when they have, an infinite lizard and difficulty, under a lien home for them lies on the other side of the globe, it grudges them a little profitable trade There is something most unfeeling and barbarous in this mode of dealing with those of our countrymen who run the risks and do the work of colo mation We treat them neither its I Englishmen inn as foreigners We follow them to the antipodes with our authority, jet, the moment they leave our shores they find themselves walked out from our markets by -v tariff xv o insist on having their allegiance , but " protecting, the co relative ofnlltglance, they know chiefly as some thing hostile to their industry To our com1tr3uu.11 and fellow subjects engaged in the great national work of spreading the British name, language, and power at the other extremity of the world, and turning wilder passes into fruitful fields, we cannot find in our hearts to grant so simple a fin our as that of buying 1 len ship loads of best wheat at market price
