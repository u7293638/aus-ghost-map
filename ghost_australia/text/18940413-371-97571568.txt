. 'Whit is Christianity ? ' SERMON BY TEE REV. W. & - STEPflfiNSOtf. Oa Sunday evening, March 25,. at the Primitive Methodist Church,' the flesV W. R. Stephenson gave au address . on ' What is Christianity?' The texts re id were Matthew, a, 16, v. 21, and Luke, o. 17, v. 20— 21. :' If any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his onus and folk w me,'- ' And when he w« demanded of the Pharisees when the king dom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of Gad cometh not with observation : Neither shall they say, Lo here ! or; Io there ! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within (among) you.' Mr. Stephenson said -the conception of a suffering Messiah was so alien to the .thought of Christ's time; that it became needful to prepare the minds of his immediate followers for receiving the divine idea of self- sacnfijp, which he was to reveal 'in his suffering and death; Pater, with characteristic impol sivenasB, repudiated the idea, but Jesas. reading at once the thoughts which prompted the remonstrance of. Peter, laid down the indisputable conditiou of spiritual life, 'If any man will come after me,' &-}. The hostility of the Jewish . Rabbis, had become more pronounced, And their; attacks more virulent. With- the .desire of ensuaring aud . convicting hinofiome. of ^the Pharisees put a question to our Lord about the coming of the kingdom of God. These Pharisees were the ecclesiastics of their time. They busiad themselves with the externals of religion — with external institutions and forms and oermonies. Many of them, like all men in error, were better than their creed, bat the essential nature of the Pharisaism with which Christ had to deal was a formal, dead ecclesiasticism. He knew that this lay at the root of their question, and therefore he told them that tbe kingdom of Gad would never corns aa they expected, 'with obser vation,' with outward pomp and ceremony. They were looking for political revolution, and a3 part of a restored Jewish empire, the establishment of a great visible church in which they should be advanced to pre eminence .and power. ' Disabuse your minds of that mean, selfish idea,' says Jesus, ' it is a dream, a mers delusion of. the night.' He tcld them further that his spiritual kingdom, which was to hold its 8-vay in the hearts of men, was already in the midst of them. . He -himself was the embodiment of that kingdom. They could not see it in any political or ecclesiastical organisation so as to say, ' Lo, here it is ! or, lo, there it is ! ' for while they were looking for such signs it was already silently making its way among them. Is there a lesson here for us ? Is there not a possible danger of looking at the church, as an outward institution, for the kingdom of God, instead of looking at Christ himsslf ? . That was the thought on which he desired to fix their attention. The religion of Christianity had, unfortunately, lieoa&a; identified with creeds And churches that when the historian of the future seeks to. trace tbe development of religious life in the nineteenth century he will find it no easy task to discover ita vital elements amid the antagonisms of doctrinal belief, and the conflicts of eccleaiastioal power. ? It -becomes especially important in such circumstances : to realise the truth that religion is in no -sensn dependent upon any special phases of doctrinal bslief. or upon any peculiar forms of ecclesiastical institu tions. The distant, recognition of this position is necessary for the right apprehen sion of many of the questions - which are trying the minds, and for. n just estimate of many cf the difficulties which are- perplexing the hearts of serious and earnest men. They must get hold of that truth in order to rightly understand the true position. la answer to the question, ?? What is . Christ ianity ?' he said there were many words which, were used to express it, such as Tightness, justice, love, and benevolence, but it often happened that there wub far too much con fusion in the use cf these words. What did they mean in the New Testament sense ? If they meant anything they meant thit we must endeavour to put our lives on a par with the life ond teaching of Jcaus himself.: Not there was nothing good iu man that was worthy of imitation, but that Jesus was the ooly pei feet .man whom they could with - safety follow. Tuey were t;- d-any them selves and follow him. What did . that : mean? There W48 one word that cxn.-eseel it better thun any other — sacrifice. Bat sacrifice did not mean giving np sim^thiug that we could do without. That was not. sacrifice, neither was it self-denial. The term aolf-deuial, as ustd by Christ, meant the denying of self,'-nvolvin--.as its correlative tha giviog of the life to God.
