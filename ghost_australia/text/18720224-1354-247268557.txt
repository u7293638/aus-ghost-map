? forty-five ry intervening :<, the year the heat% is very oppressive, one would scarcely suppose s that there wroild be found many people willing . to encounter so many difficulties for the purpose of attending a tea meeting and soiree.

The light Aafi :.fto"m libove; - aiid there Wete no cast shadows. ^Tho .edges of all Bear objects were sharp"and' Well ; .defined,' tiodlthe effect was most peculiar. ,As. we reacVed the summit of the hill, we could'see "for-miles rn various directions, and as w6 ; iooked down upon the dense foliage, it was wrapt -in a thin mist, becoming more and more soft and Jakey till ail was lost in haze. The sky itself was -pure' (mi! silvery, but there were stray banks of clouds here and there, with the sides-towards the east tinged with a blue purple, and- the " silver lining " rolling 1 dilitately bVer the upper edges. Everything was so soft, so fresh, and so pure that it set us dreaming of what- the world was on the first morning when it'Was handed over to Adam's keeping. Nqw;and then the stillness was disturbed for a few.moments by the ringing laugh of some lady's voice-as it broke from dr.e of the buggies and went in echoes dancing hither and thither among the pearly fringed leaves of the surrounding hills. Then all was still again. But now the sun broke from the east, and in an instant all was changed. Up he came like a huge mass of lurid fire. One side of every bbject seemed in a blaze. "Long lancets of apparent flame darted across the forest, and intense past shadows trailed along, the' ground. All kinds of birds with screeching and discordant notes sprang from all quarters, Sand screamed and chattered as if their only object of existence was to make as much discord as pcssible. Higher and higher rose the sun, firey and more fiery became every object. A haze, like liquid fire, commenced to dance around us, and we were rolling along beneath an autumnal sun of Australia. Away we went, however, down Burrangong Creek, then to Mr. Howell's station at Bribera, and then to Thuddungarra Swamp, where breakfast was proposed. The party having assembled and the vehicles having discharged their cargoes of cold "fowls, hams, tongues, pastry, wines, fruits, Ac., &c.;, a grand jivc-nic. took place which lasted three hours- It is astonishing, how soon latjies settle down to • circumstances. In a few minutes they senmed to be as much at home beside the cloth on the grass as if it was part of their every day occupations, and extemporized things in the most marvellous manner. One gentleman, however, outstripped all others in this line. He had a very shy horse that would :not, be either led ov driven to water, so in tlip absence pf a bucket, a carpet-bag was brought into • requisition fo:- the purpose of giving the shy brute a drink. There were hundreds of ducks .ofl the lagoon, but they were so shy thatf-dur sportsmen sno ceeded only in driving them all away. Twt, cranes, however, were shot, and brought Jatu camp with an air of triumph w6rthy of-a bettoicause. Having re-arranged matters, away wo rolled again, through lurid, haze aDd clouds of dust till about two o'clock, when another halt was prpposed. Again .were , the buggies unpacked, the cloths spread, and a luxurious repast enjoyed. Someof the gentlemen withdrew ^toi bend of Ballabia Creek, and plunged in the stream. Away we went agaiij over nine miles of level and uninviting country, aiid Moranjare] was reached. Here all was bustle and .excibemen(-_ a g reat number of persons having come ip fr<jp the surrounding statjinS. , ^Morapjarel is on the ba»k, ofi the Yoo Ye.
