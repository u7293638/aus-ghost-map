A MYSTERY SUPERNATURAL AGENCY. The following remarkable story is from the Dubbo Dispatch, a journal which would not lend itself to the publication of any fabrications: A COALBAGGIE MYSTERY. About three years ago Peter Stein, a hard headed, practical, frugal German, sold property he possessed in the Wagga district, and, with his family, came to Dubbo in search of land. He and his son Jacob, a young man now 28 years of age, took up two areas of 2560 acres each on the Coal-. baggie. The selections are on the South Balla. doran run and rather isolated. Jacob's selection is on the southern part of the run, and there was when it was taken up an old hut upon it. In this at first lived the family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs Peter Stein, two adult sons, two adult daughters, and five younger children. With the family a young man named Daley came into the district. He had been reared by the Steins and was as one of the family. He was much attached to them and they to him. Jacob determined to build on the site of the hut, while Peter commenced the erection of a commodious residence on his land, about three miles away. The Steins were, however, no sooner settled down-the father and family in their new house and Jacob at his hut-than they heard at night strange voices, loud cooeying, and awful scream- ings. Thinking that they proceeded from either belated travellers or homeward proceeding selectors, more merry than sensible, they took little notice of them. These sounds were only heard at intervals, a fortnight or three weeks intervening between their occurrence. They, however, took place so regularly, for they were at one time heard at Jacob Stein's and again at the father's, that the idea of noisy roysterers, making night hideon with their noises, was given up. About 18 months ago there were further developments and, according to the family, strange manifestations The furniture in Peter Stein's house became as possessed. It jumped about in all directions, and on one occasion the crash of crockery was something decidedly extra ordinary and uncanny. Mrs. Stein was baking in the kitchen one day, and after she had her dough prepared to be placed in the oven an invisible hand caught it up and tossed it on the floor. These things, or akin to them, have kept on from then till now, but with the further development that the person responsible, whether spirit of heaven or goblin damned, has frequently interviewed and has had conversations with the several members of the family. Evidently the presence is not of the regular type, for it does not wait till the " witching hour when graveyards yawn and ghosts troop forth," but comes along in broad daylight and talks to a family who are now somewhat terrified, as may well be imagined. In reply to a question from Peter Stein the invisible visitor has said that his name is George William Herbert, and that his mother, who was named Annie, and his sister, who was called Julia, were burnt to death on the South Balladoran run-that his father died in the Cootamundra Hos-. pital 18 years ago-that he (the speaker) had been hit upon the head and left for dead on the road, that he had been saved, and had subsisted upon herbs and weeds. Upon being asked to show him-. self by the elder Stein be replied that if he did those who saw him would faint, for they had never seen anything like him before. According to the Steins -and all, from the father to the youngest child, tell the same round unvarnished tale--the visitor sometimes speaks in a gruff, manly voice and some- times as softly as a woman; indeed, it would be difficult to distingulsh his voice from a girls. The dogs about the place seem to know when it is coming. Although the Steins cannot see it, they appear to have that power, for they bark furiously, and one particular dog goes nearly wild with fear and excitement. About a fortnight ago things reached a climax and the invlsible one performed all kinde of pranks. It cast tomahawks and knives about with the grace of an Indian juggler and upset pots, chairs, and other articles of domestic economy. One night while the family were en- gaged reciting the Rosary-they are Roman Catholics and retain the simple devotional habits of the Rhineland-the table round which they knelt was suddenly lifted towards the ceiling and then allowed to come down with a heavy thud. So an- noying have, been the manifestations that Daley, the young fellow who came from Wagga with the Steins, has left the place. Another men named Bowden, employed by them, has also left, saying that if he were given the selection he would not live there. The whole thing is certainly mysterious, but, however the sceptical may be inclined to laugh at it, there is not, our informant states, the slightest doubt that every one of the family thoroughly believes what he tells, and each, from the youngest child to the father of the family, has the same story to tell. Mrs Stein, who is an Eng-. lish lady, with no tendency to the superstitious, is as convinced as she is of her existence that the place is haunted. A few days ago, at Peter Stein's request, the Very Rev. Father Byrne visited the selection:, and though during the night and day he spent there he saw or heard nothing, he investi- gated as far as possible the affalir and is thoroughly satisfied that the Steins are believers that they are being annoyed by a power which can act materially talk like a man or woman, all the time being in- visable. The affair is extraordinary and a searching inquiry should take place.
