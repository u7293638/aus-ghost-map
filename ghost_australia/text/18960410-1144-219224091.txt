Rifle Match at Mooxxta- | By Miss Outer. The Gladstone team left home for Moonta on Saturday, and after the usual incidents of a railway journey, arrived at their destination at about six o'clock. There was one incident which may be classed as very unusual, and for the facts of the case I rely on the undoubted vera city of two seigeants and a full private. Shortly after leaving Kadina tliey were surprised, on looking through a carriage w ndow, to behold a supernatural being embracing the best-looking officer of the team. The officer was quite unconscious of the endearments of the fairy visitor, and no other explanation can be given than the supposition that it was the ghost of some dead and forgotten sweei heart. When we readied Moonta we were assailed by a blinding hurricane of sand and dust, but this was soon succeeded by a steady downpour of rain. The team put up at the Globe Hotel after being escorted from the station by Captain Page and several other officers of 'the Moonta Company. Mr Nankeivis, the genial host of the Globe, did all he could to make the visit of the team a pleasant one. Mr. Crutchett, an old and well known Gladstone resident, also did all he could to make the trip enjoyable. Most of the men had a look about the streets, but the weather was very inclement, and the usual Saturday evening crowds in a mining town were conspicious by their absenc\ Sunday morning was bright and clear, and most of the team were up betimes for a ramble through the clean, welj-laid out, and well- kept town. The places of worship were well patronised by the Gladstone men, and those who went to the anniversary services of the Wesleyan Sunday School enjoyed a real musical treat. At the In stitute in the evening a sacred concert in aid of the Brunner colliery disaster fund was held. The Mayor of Moonta and most of the ministers of the district gave short addresses. The singing and the in strumental music were really excellent, and were highly appreciated by the visi tors. The rifle range is conveniently placed to the town, aud by ten o'olock on Eastei Monday all our men were eager and ready for the fiay. There was a fairly strong wind blowing, but the light was ail that a rifleman could desire. Two targets were prepared, and without delay the battle began, half of the respective teams com peting at each range. The distances were 200, 500, and 600 yards, seven shots aud two sighters at each range, ten men aside, the 8 highest soores in each team to count in the match. At 200 yd3., Gladstone led by 9 points, Lieut. Sampson beating all competitors with 32 points. At the next range the visitors increased their lead by 19 points, Sergeant Edmunds with 32 being highest. At the longest range the Gladstone men simply romped over their opponents, beating them by 40 points. Private O. Coe was top at this range with a deserving '29. Captain Page, of the Moonta team, made the best shooting of the day, ooming out with a fine score of 89\. The scores of the teams of 8 men are given below, from which it will be seen that the shootins all round was far above the average, the winners averaging 83.1 and the losers 76.7 points per man.
