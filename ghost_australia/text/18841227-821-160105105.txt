"I WOKE ONE DAY." I woke one day to find that Youth was going, With lime, who takes good things and ill, To join a vague procession, evergrowing, Of ghosts who people dreamland still: Those whom the years have rent world-wide asnnder, Old friends once daily looked npon; Borne toil npon this earth, and some rest under, So doubt: and do some still regret, I wonder, The glad old days, the good time gone 2 Time rakes away his dust-heap of dead roses. Of empty cups, of broken vows. Spent love, ana all dim memories discloses, The morning after Youth's carouse; Be Bhows us shades of unforgotten faces, We hear the voices far away, Of revellers, who leave us still some traces. Of songs whose echoes haunt old halting-places, Where night was often turned to day. And many rest in sleep by dreams unbroken, By winds unswept, by stars unseen, Never to speak again as they have spoken, Or know lost joys that might have been. When elow-d6parang summer-day yet lingers. Between the purpling western bars, When winds sound faint, as if some far-off singers Were touching harps with tired, trembling fingers We see lost eyes smile in the stars.
