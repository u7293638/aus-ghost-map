VICTORIA THEATRE. The Spectrcscope and the Ghost. " LAST night a marvellous and most amusing entertainment was given in the Victoria Theatre by Messrs. Davison and Wilks, who provided a performance, unique and enjoy able. The theatre was fairly well filled, and it is only regrettable that tile house was not crowded to witness thlb startling, effective, and moit mysterious illusions given under the name of " St. Vincent's Spectrescope and D'Arcy Read's Ghost." The stangs arrange ments were excellent, Mr. D'Arcy Read, the stage manager, deserring great credit for Isis work, and the lisne-lighst effects wore splendid. The eltrlrpreseers are ably as sisted by a very good company, consisting of Miss A. Do Voro, a sweet contralto singer, Miss Jessie Sullivan, a soprano serio-comio vocalist, with a voice of much power and tone, Miss A. Denvers, a capable actress, Mr. Charlio York, a comedian of ability, Mr. H1. Saunders, a funny, negro comedian, Mr. H. Victor, a splendid baritone, and Mr. H. G. Lawrence, a gentleman with a wonderful double voice. The programme consisted of illusion after illusion, tihe spectres appearing with such rapidity as to almost startle the on-lookers. "Tine Spirit Tempter" and "The Haunted Houso" were two very laugh-. able pieces; while the "Barber bewitched,', and the "Phnantonn Minstrelo" were also pro - vocative of muoh mirth. Mr. Fred. Fostoe's ventriloquial cntortainsent was unique and amusing, the ventriloquist she sing himself a master of his art. Tie theatre should be well patronised during the season ot this company, for tIhe show is-wall worthny of a visit. Tlno programme to-night will undergo a clange. _ LArnrms, suchlovely Millinery at Scott and Aird's. 708
