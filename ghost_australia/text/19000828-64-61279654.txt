Tue Federal Site. Nobody seems to have the least idea yet where the site of the Federal capital will be, and a definite opinion cannot well be formed until the Site Commissioner has sent in his report. But when that event will happen is still a mystery. Questioned on the subject in the Assembly, the Premier said he was unable to give any information. Mr. Oliver has had the matter in hand so long that it makes one compare his investigation with the M'Sharry arbitration case. lb was a mistake to entrust the duty to him, because as a member of the Land Court he could not have had sufficient time at his disposal to make the inquiry within a reasonable period. If the report is not furnished next month it will not be of much service, and there will be an outburst of expletives from members pf the Assembly that may not be pleasant to Mr. Oliver. The .feeling is pretty general that in conducting bis inquiries he has visited too many, places. Some of them there was no necessity at all to visit, because there was not the ghost of a chance of any of their number beingselected as the site of the Federal capital. But Mr. Oliver was not supposed to know that. When his report does see the light,' BO doubt it will be an elaborate affair.
