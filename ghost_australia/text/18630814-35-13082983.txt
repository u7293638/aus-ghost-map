KAB AND HIS FRIENDS. St John Brown, M.D. Toub-a-nd-Thirtï years ago, Bob Ainslie and I were coming up Infirmary-street from the High School, our heads together, and our arms intertwined, as only lovers and boys know how, or why "When we got to the top of the street, and turned north, we espied a crowd at the Iron Church " A dogfight'" shouted Bob, and was off, Mid so was both of us all but praying that n might not be over before we got up ' And is not this boy-nature and human nature toil and don't we all wish a house on fire not to be out before we « out Dogs like lighting , old Isaac I says they "delight" in it, and for the best of all I reasons and boy are not cruel because they like to see the fight They see three of the great cardinal virtue s of dog or man-c drage, endurance, and skill -in more anon This is very different from a love of making dogs tight, are enjoying, and ingratiating and making gain by their pluck A boy-be he ever j so fond himself of fighting, if r e be a good boy, hates and despises til this, out he would have run off with Bob and me fast enough it is a natural, and not n w lacked interest, that all boys and men have in witnessing intense energy a section Does any curious and briefly ignorant woman wish to know how Bob's eve at a glance announced 3 dog- fight to his brain He did not, he could not see the dogs fighting , is it as a flash of en inf rence, a rapid induction The crowd round a couple of dogs light rig, is a crowd at calme man 'y, such an occasional active, compassionate woman, Hutt ring wildly round the outside, and using her tongue and her hands freely upon the man, as to many "brutes,' it is a crowd set ular, compact, and mobile, a crowd centripetal having its eyes ord its heads all bent downwards and swore"!, to one common focus Ye eil, Bob and I are u,., and lard it is not over a small thoroughbred, white bull-terrier is busy throttling a large "shepherd's dog, unaccustomed to war, but not to be trifled with them are hard at it, the scientific little fellow doing his work in great style, his pastoral enemy fighting wildly, but with the sharpest of teeth and a great courage Science and breeding, however, soon had their own, the Game Chicken, as the premature Bob called him, working his way up, took his final grip of poor Yarrott's throat-and he lay gasping and done for His master, a brown, handsome, big young shepherd from Tweedsmuir, would have liked to have knocked down any man, would " drink up EsiL, or eat a crocodile," for that part, if he had a chance it was no use kicking the little dog that would only make him hold the closer. Many were the means shouted out in mouth full, of the best possible way of ending it. " Water'" but there was none near, and many cried for it who might have got it from the well at Blackfriars "Wynd W' Bite the tail !" and a large, vague, benevolent, middle- aged man, more desirous than wise, with some struggle got the bushy end of Jarrott's tail into his ample mouth, and bit it with all his might This was more than enough for the much-enduring, much per- spiring shepherd, who, with a gleam of joy over has broad visage, delivered a tense later upon our large, vague, benevolent, middle aged friend, who went down like a shot Still the Chicken holds , death not far off " Snuff' a pinch of snuff '" observed a calm, highly dressed young buck, with an eye-glass in his eye Snuff, and ted growled the angry crowd, affronted and glaring "Snuff' a pinch of snuff'" again observes the back, but with, more urgency ; whereon were produced several open boxes and from a mull which, may have been at Cul order, he took a pinch, knelt down, and presented it to the nose of the Chicken The laws of physiology and of snuff take their course, the Chicken sneezes, and Yarrow is free The young paste ii j- its area-, cf with Yarrow in his aims,-Ceiiiit i uni a But the bull terrier s blood is up, and his soul un- satisfied , he grips the best dog he meets, and discovering she is not a dog, in Homeric phrase, he makes a brief sort of amends, and is off The boys, with Bob and me at their head, are after him down "Baldry-street he goes, bent on mosCtuef, up the Con- gate like an ano (t-Bob and I, and our small men, pantTog behind. There, under the single arch of the South Bridge, is a huge mastiff, sauntering down the middle of the causeway, as if with his hands in his pockets he is old, grey, branded, as big as a little Highland bull, and has the Shakspenan dewlaps shaking as he goes The Chicken makes straight at him, and fastens on his throat To our astonishment-, the great creature does nothing but stand still, hold himself up, and roar -yes roar a long, serious, remonstrance roam He it is this Bob and I are up to them Be is muzzled The horses had proclaimed a general muzzling, and his master, studying strength and economy mainly, had encompassed his huge jaws in a home-made apparatus, constructed out of the lea hear of some ancient breeches His mouth was open as far as it could , his Dps curled up in rage-a sort of terrible gain, his teeth gleam ne, ready, from out the darkness, the s rap across his mouth tense as a bott string , his whole frame stiff With "indignation and surprise ; his son asking us all round", " Did you ever see the like of this " He looked a statue of anger and astonishment, done in Aberdeen granite We soon had a cross of the Chicken held on " A knife '" cued Boo and a cobbler gave him his knife, you know the land of knife, worn away obliquely to a point, and always keen I put its edge to the tense leather, it ran before it, and then ' one sudden jerk of that enormous head, a sort of duty mist about his mouth, no noise, and the bright and fierce little fellow is dropped, limp, and dead A solemn pause, this was more than any of us had bargained for I turned the little fellow over, and saw he was quite dead , the mastiff had taken him by the small of the back like a rat, and broken it He looked down at his victim appeased, ashamed, and amazed ; snuffed him all over, stared at him, and taking a sudden thought, turned round and trotted off. Bob took the dead dog up, and said, "John, we'll bury him after tea." "Yes," said 1, and was off after trie mastiff. He made up the Cowgate at a rapid swing ; he had forgotten some engagement. He turned up the Cnndlemaker- rcw, and stopped at the Harrow Inn. There was a carrier's cart ready to star;, and a keen, thin, impatient, black- a-vised little man, his Lind at his grey horse's head, looking about angrily for something. "Rab, ye thief!" said he, aiming a kick at my great friend, who drew springing up, and avoiding the heavy shoe with more agility than dignity, and watching his master's eye, slunk dismayed under the cart, his ears down, and as much as he had of tail down too. What a man this must be-thought I-to whom my tremendous hero turns tail ! The carrier saw the muzzle hanging, cut and useless, from his neck, and I eagerly told him the story, which Bob and I always thought, and still think, Homer, or King David, or Sir Walter, alone were worthy to rehearse. The severe little man was mitigated, and condescended to say, " Rab, ma man, pair Robbie, whereupon the stump of a tail rose up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled, and were conferred ; the two events Were re- conciled. " Hupp !" and a stroke of the whip were given to Jess and off went the three. Bob and I buried the Game Chicken that night (we had not much of a tear in the back- green of his house, in Melville-street, No. 17, with considerable gravity and silence and being at the time in the Iliad, and, like all boys, Trojans, we call him Rector of course. Six years have passed long time for a boy and a dog ; Bob Ainslie is off to the wars ; I am a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital. Rab I saw almost every week, on the Wednesday and we had much pleasant intimacy. I found the way to his heart by frequent scratching of his huge head, and an occasional bone. When I did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me, and stand a Egging that had of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one side. His master I occasionally saw; he used to call me "Master John," but was laconic as any Spartan. One fine October afternoon, I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Rub, with that great and easy saunter of his. He looked as if taking general possession of the place; like the Duke of Wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace. After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart; and in it a woman, carefully wrapped up, the carrier leading the horse anxiously, and looking back. When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque " box," and said, Master. John, this is the mistress ; she's got a trouble in her breast some kind of an income we're thinking'." By this time I saw the woman's face ; she was sitting on a sack filled with straw, her husband's plaid round her, and his big coat, with its large white metal buttons, over her feet. I never saw a mere unforgetable face-pale, serious, lonely, . delicate, sweet, without being at all what we call fine. She looked sixty, and had on a much, white as snow, with its black ribbon; her silvery, Hoooth hair setting off her dark-grey eyes-eyes such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of it is not easy para? this book by one word ; it was express 111 of her fctiEg so much of her life alone, tutu ung, lull ratio of the overcoming of it , he eye on us black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and contented, which few mouths ever are. As I have said, I never saw a more beautiful cool tenance, or one more subdued to centred -just "As we, ' said Jane, ' this is Master John, the young doctor r, Rab's friend, ye ken We often soak above you, doctor." She smiled, and made a movement, has said nothing, and prepared to comedown, putting her plaid aside and rising Hid Sermon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate?, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, then did James, the Howgate"earner, 11 hears be lifted down Ailie his wife The contrast of his small, swarthy, weather beaten, keen, worldly face to hers-pile, subdued, and beautiful-has * something wonderful. Rio looked on cor cleaned and puzzled, but ready for any thing that might turn upside it to strangle the nurse, the tor er, or even me Ailie and he seemed great scenes. " As I was says', she's got a kind of trouble in her breast, doctor , will we take a look at it We walked! into the consulting room, all four, Rab grim and comic, willing to be happy and confidential if cause could be shown, willing also to be the reverse, on the same terms Adie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast, I looked it and examined it carefully she and James ii rich- ing me, and Rab eyeing all three. What could I says there it was, that had once been so soft, so shaped, so white, so gracious and bountiful, so " full of all bless d conditions, '-hard is a stone, a centre of horrid pain, asking that pale face, with its grey, lucid, reasonable, view, and its sweet resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome Why was that genre Redcar, sweet is woman, clean and loveable, condemned by God to bear such a burden - I got her away to bed " May Rab and me bide -" fad James " Journal and Rab, if he was to bear e barrels." "I'se warrant here do the, doctor ," and in slunk the faithful beast I wish you could have seen him there are no such dogs now He belonged to a lost tribe As I have said, he was brindled, and grey like Rubislaw granite, his hair short, hard, and close, like a lion's , his body thick set, like a little bull- a sort of compressed Hercules of a dog. He must have been ninety pounds weight, at the least, he had a large blunt lead ; his muzzle black as night, his mouth blacker than any night, a tooth or two being all he had gleaming out of his jaws of darkness. His head was scanned with the r cords of old winds, a sort offences of fields of battle all over it, one eye out, one ear cropped as close as was Archbishop Leighton's fathers, the remaining eye had the power of two and above it, and in constant; communication 111th it, was a tattered rag of an ear, which was for ever unfurling itself, like an old flag and then that bud of a tail, about one inch long, if it could in any sense be said to be long, being as broad as for g-the more lay, the instantaneou«ness of that had were very funny and surprising, and its expressive twinkling and workings, the intercommunications between the eye, the ear and it were of the oddest and swiftest. Rab had the dignity and simplicity of great size and having fought his way all along the road to absolute supremacy, he was as mighty in his own line as Julius Caesar or the Duke of Wellington, and had the gravity of all great fighters You must have often observed the likeness of certain men to certain animals, and of certain dogs to men Now, I never looked at Rab without thinking of the great Baptist preacher, Andrew Fisher t The same Urge, heavy, menacing, combative, sombre, honest countenance, the same deep inevitable eye, the Esme look as of thunder asleep, but ready neither a dog nor a man to be trifled with Next day, my matter, the surgeon, examined Ailie. There was no doubt it must kill her, and soon. It could be re- moved-it might never return it would give her speedy relief-she should have it done. She curtsied, looked at James, and said, " When -" "To-morrow said the kind surgeon-ft man of few words She and James and Rab and I retired I noticed that he and she spoke little, but seemed to anticipate everything in each other. The following day, at noon, the students came in, hurrying up the great stair At the first landing-place, on a small well-known blackboard, was a bit of paper fastened by wafers, and mine remains of old wafers beside it On the paper were the words,-" An operation to-day. J. B , clerk " Up ran the youths, eager to secure good places in they crowded, full of interest and talk. " What's the case-" "Which side is it Don't think them heartless, they are neither better nor worse than you or I they get over their professional horrors, and into their proper work, and in the city - as an emotion, ending in itself or at best in tears and a long- drawn breath, lessens, while pity as wine, is quickened, and gains power and purpose It is well for poor human nature that it is so The operating theatre is crowded, much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth The surgeon with his staff of assistants is there In comes Ailie, one look at her quiets and abates the eager students That beautiful old woman is too much for them , they sit down, and are dumb, and gaze at her These rough boys feel the power of her presence She walks in quickly, but without haste , dressed in her match, her neckerchief, her white dimity short gown, her black bombazeen petticoat, showing her white worsted stockings and her carpet shoes Behind her was James with Rab James sat down in the distance, and took that huge and noble head between his knees Bab looked perplexed and dangerous for ever cocking his ear and dropping it as fast Adie stepped upon a seat, and laid herself on the table, as her friend the surgeon told her arranged herself, gave a rapid look at James, shut her eyes, rested herself on me and took my hand The operation was at once begun , it was necessarily sion and ehlor^fcrm-one of God's best gifts to his suffering children-was then unknown The surgeon did his work The pale face showed its pain, but it is still and silent Rab's boat was working within him he saw that something strange was going on blood flowing from his mistress, and she suffers, his ragged ear was up, and importunate , he growled and gave now and then a sharp impatient yelp , he would have liked to have done something to that man Bat James had him firm, and gave him a glower from time to time, and an intimation of a possible kick , all the better for James, it kept his eye and his mind off Ailie It is over she is dressed, steps gently and decently down from the table, looks for James , then, turning to the surgeon and the students she curtsies and in a few clear voice, begs their pardon if she has behaved ill The students all of us wept like children, the surgeon happed her up carefully, and, resting on James and me, Ailie went to her room, Rab following "We put her to bed James took off his heavy shoes, crammed with jackets, heel-capped and toe caps, and put them carefully under the table, saying, Master. John, I'm for name of' yer strynge nurse bodies for Adie I'll be her nurse, and I li gang about on my stocking soles as canny as pussy " And so he did and handy and clever, and a Rift and tender as any woman, was that horny handed, snell, peremp to-t little man Everything she got he gave her he seldom slept, and often I saw his small shrewd eyes out of the darkness, fixed on her As before, they spoke little Rab behaved well, after moving, showing Dr Nott meek and gentle be could be, and occasionally, in his sleep, letting us know that he was demolishing some ' adversary He took a walk with me every day, generally to the Candiemaker rest , but he was sombre and mild , declined doing battle, though some he cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indignities, and was always very ready to turn, and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door Jess, the mare, had been sent, with her weather- worn cart, to How gate, and had doubtless her own dina and placid m ell and ores and confusions, on the absence of her master and Rab and her unnatural freedom from the road and her cart ' For some days Ailie did well. The wound healed " by the first intention, for as James said, Oor Ashe's skin is ever clean to bell " The students came in quiet and anxious, and surrounded her bed She said she liked to see their young, honest faces The surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short kind way, paying her through his eyes, Rib and James outside the circle, Rab being now reconciled and even cordial, and having made up his mind that as yet nobody required worrying, but as you may suppose, semper parties So far well but four days after the operation, my patient had a sudden end long severing, a " groom'," as she called it.

Dr Charles Stewart, of Dunedin, the rare gifts and graces as a physician, a divine, a scholar, and a gentleman, live only in the memory of those few who knew and receive him, liked to tell how Mr. Fuller used to say, that when he was in the pulpit, and saw a hardly man come along the passage, he would Inaunctively draw himself up, measure he imaginary- antagonist, and forecast how he would deal with him, his hands meanwhile condensing into fists, and tending to " square."

The end was drawing on the gold a bowl was breaking ; the silver cord was fast being loosed-that animals blankets, regula, hospes, comesque, was about to free the body and the soul-companions for sixty fears were being sundered, and taking leave She was walking alone, through the valley of that shadow, into which one day we must all enter, and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and staff were comforting her Or e night she had fallen quiet, and, as we hoped, asleep , her eyes were shut We put down the gas, and sat watching her Suddenly she satupinbrd and taking a bed gown which was lying on it rolled up, she held it eagerly to her breast to the right side "Ya e could see her eyes bright with a surprising tenderness and joy, bending over this bundle of clothes She held it as a woman holds her sucking" child, opening out her night-gown imps lently, and h' siding it close and brooding over it, and murmuring foo ith little words as over our whom his mother comforters, and who silks and a satisfied it was pitiful and turned to see her wasted dying look, keen and i e. a gusher immense love ' Pieseivtme' groaned James, Riding way And then she rocked back and forward, as if to make it sleep, hushing it, and west ng on it her infinite fold its- 'Wats me, doctor, I eWlare she s thinkin' its that bairn," " What being ' "The only brim he ever had our wee Music, and the a in the Ring dam, fern leaves and mare It was plainly true the j rain in the breast, telling its urgent story to a bewildered ruined brain, was misread and mistaken ; it suggested to her the uneasiness of a class' full of milk, and then the child, and so again once more they were together, and she had her ain wee Mysie in her bosom This was the close She sank rapidly the delirium left. her, but, as she whispered, she was "clean silly , ' it was the lightening before the final darkness After having for some time lainstill-her eyes shut, she said " James '" He came close to her, and lifting up her calm, clear, beau ideal eyes, she gave him a long look, turned to me kindly but shortly, looked for Rab but could not see him, then turned to her husband again as if she would never leave off looking shut her eyes, and composed herself She lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away to general, that when we thought she was gone, James in his old fashioned way, held the mirror to her face After a long pause, one small spot of dimness was breathed out, it vanished away, and never returned, leaving the blank clear darkness of the mirror without a stain ' What is our life it is even a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, and then vanished away ' Bab all this time had been full awake and motion- less he came forward beside us Ailie's hand, which James had held, was hanging down ; it was soaked with his tears , Rab licked it all over carefully, looked at her, and returned to his place under the table James and I sat, I don't know how long bat for some time-saving nothing he started up abruptly, and with some noise at ent to the table, and put ting his right fore and middle fingers each into a shoe, pulled them out, and put them on, breaking one of ibelfatberlatehets, and muttering in anger, I never did the like of' that afore I believe he never did , nor after either " Rab ' ' he said roughly, and pointing with his thumb to the bottom of the bed Rab leapt up, and settled him self, his head and eye to the dead face "Muster John, ye 11 wait for me, said the carrier and disappeared in the darkness, thundering down stairs in his heavy shots I ran to a front window there he was, already round the house, and out at the gate, flying like a shadow I was, afraid about him, and yet not afraid, so I sat down beside Rab, and, being wearied, fell asleep? I awoke from a sudden noise outside It was November and there had been a heavy full of snow Rab was in statu quo, he heard the noise too, and plainly knew it, but never moved I looked out, and there, at the gate, in the dim morning-for the sun was not up, was Jess and the cart, cloud of steam rising from the old mare I did not see James , he was already at the door, and came up the stairs, and met me It was less than three hours since he left, and he must have noted on-who knows how - o Hott gate, full nine miles on, yoked Jess, and driven her astonished into town He had unarmed of blankets, and was streaming with perspiration He nodded to me, spread out on the floor two pairs of clean old blankets having at their comers, " A G , 1794, in large letters in red worsted These were the initials of Alison Grant, and James may have looked in at her from without himself unseen but not unthought of when he was " was, wet, and weary,' and after having walked many a mile over the hills, may have seen her sitting, while "a' the have three sleeper ," and by the firelight working her name on the blankets, for her an James's bed He motioned Rab down, and taking his wife in his arms, laid her in the blankets, and happed her, he nodded again sharply to me, and with a resolved but utterly miserable lace, strode along the passage, and down stairs, followed by Rab I follott ed with a light, but he did it need it I went out, holding stupidly the candle in my hand in the calm frosty air, we were soon at the gave I could have helped him, but I saw he was not to be meddled with, and he was strong, and did not need it He laid her down as tenderly, as safely, as he had lifted her out ten days before-as tenderly as when he had her first in his arms when she was only ' A G deserted her, leaving that beautiful sealed face open to the heat ears, and then taking Jess by the head, he moved away He did not notice me, neither did Rab, who presided behind the cart I stood till they passed through the long shadow of the College, and turned up Nicolson's feet I heard the solitary cart sound through the streets, and die away and come again, and I returned, thinking of that company going up Libbrton Brae, then along Roslin Muir, the morning light touching the Pentlands and making them like on looking ghosts , then down the hill through Auchmdmny woods, past " haunted "Woodhouselee," and as daybreak came sweeping up the bleak Larnmermmrs, and fell on his own door, the company would stop, and James would take the key, and aft Adie are again, laying her on her own bed and, having put Jessup would return with Rab and shut the door James burned his wife, with his neighbours mourn mg, Rab inspecting the solemnity from a distance it was snow, and that black ragged hole should lock strange in the midst of the swelling spot- less cushion of white James looked after everything then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed, was insensible when the doctor cane, and soon died.
