COR1RESPONDENCE UNWHIOLESOME LITERATURE. \- TO THE EfDITORl, SIs,-On perusing a Home paper recently, I road with regret oE the and suicide of a young girl through having developed a mania for reading cxcitiog none (?) and I venture to endeavour to lay before mothers and fathers the evil effects and bad results in. variably attending this corrupt literature. Thin poor girl in quee.tion, who was described as being strong aud healthy and a help to her mother in household work, ultimately committed suicide by hanging herself, which alone I think should prove suffleient warning to mothere especially who allow their daughters to read anything and everything they eon lay their hends upon, It is my reluctant experience, even in our merry little town, to observe children of tender yoere earrn d away with this se-called attractive and entort-ining literature. The needs of tnwholesomo testes are often sown in the nuraory or schoolroom. Anuras or governess is porhaps given to telling ghoct ctories of the most blood.curdling description, a praotio I concedor thet, even in its mildeet form, can not be too etrongly condemned. So great a piteh is this carried to in aome households that there arc many children who do not consider a etory the leat in. tereeting unless it tells of ghosts and akinny hands clutching swords and daggers, and impossiblo people who walk about with their heade under their arms. All this kind of thing meejedihe shsuld bo put down in every household, nureery, cur 8eh0o0room with a very strong hand, for it is hidoous beyond oxpreesion, and in the cue of quite young children might possibly have fatal reselte, or lead to insanity, which would be even worse. -lam, &o.;, Wiekham, 10th June.
