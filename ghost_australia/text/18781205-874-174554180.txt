Bonny Doon, Revised by the Ghost of Burns. Ye banks and braes of Yarra Stream, How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair; How can ye smile when we are doun Wi' wrackit Government and care V How can ye chant, ye poortith folk, Wha find nae wark to earn y'er kail, Ye mind me of departed joys, Ere we had Berry and his tail Oft hae I roamed by Yarra Stream To see the flowers and willows twine, And ilka man sang of success, And fondly sae did I of mine. Wi' lightsome heart I earned my bread, Fu' sweetly frae all worry free, But that fause Berry changed the scene, And, ah, he left us misery.
