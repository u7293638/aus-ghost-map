CHAPTER VI.— Mr NAive ;Lakd,. Good Night. r Mav^horpe was for 6ale ! ' . : 1 The sturdy old horase/that had cradled within its walls so many comely. o roaidens and,hardy sons, was about 'to pass, with ail its associations and hoarv belongings, -to other hands: and from henceforth it would know the :Wingate|s np more. , - j What haunting memories in.tUpse silent, yet eloquent rooms ! Solemnly, amidst the gathering gloom, the ghosts of ihe departed race seemed to elide in and ont among the quaint nooks and corners of- the place as if in protest at the irreverence of the act. ; Look at the frowning defiance depicted on the face of that picture on the oak-lined parlor wall. The corporeal form of Jasper Wingate passed away from earth 300 years ago. Yet here — the painted likeness glows as if with life and motion, and by the uncer tain light appears to jabber at the unfortu nate Smith, who is pacing slowly to and fro beneath. - 0 the weary hours and the long, sleepless nights for the sorrowing father — thinking of his poor prodigaL E that father's heart rose the unholy wish that the trosfe and the snow might be merciful to the wanderei*, and end his wretched life, rather than he should fall into the hands of those who, were on the watch for him day and night. O the weary haul's of suspense ! An escaped felon, to be chased and hunted like a wild dog, and per chance to die a dog's death. Skulking and dodging around the old homestead, the agents of police were ever on the alert to secure their prey. How-could the honest smith meet his fellow tnen with the sword of Damocles hanging daily and hourly over him? Nay, better to resign his civic honors, and leave the old place for ever, A purchaser was soon found fp;r' May^ thorps, and John Wingate roused his latent energies to leave England and seek a home in the colonies. * The poor smith wondered to- hear the, cprporal laugh and indulge- in snatches of gay song, while he was so troubled and dis consolate, was it not sufficient that they were quitting the old land ±or«vermore — to them at Ieast7 and that in the decline t-f life they would have to begin anew? 3ujb Corporal BaE had wisely kep-r his -feecret to himself. He felt confident that Claude Wingate, under his assumed name, would be safe in the army ; and, come what might, there was honor in a soldier's grave. ' Therefore was the pld veteran comforted. ' . While John Wingate walked up and down before the frowning V' picture of his ancestor, .Corporal Sail . stole quietly up the broad stairway toward a small room overlooking the garden. The old huzzar paused 'before the door of this chamber for several inmates, and stroked his grey moustaehe.reflecjavely. Opening it noiselessly he looked in. By the light of a small lamp he beheld Lena Graham upon her knesa, her head buried; in the snow white covering of her couch. Scattered around lay a heap of old letters— some of them faded and yellow with age, others bearing marks of violets and roses, with here and there a ribbon stained and decayed, by which they had been tied. There was a world of sorrow in the girl's posture. The listless arms resting upon the bed; the long, Kglossy hair displaced, and laying about the slender figure like a rich mantle; the sntalL shapely- head halt buried, all spoke more eloquently than wordg a mournful, -restless grief, that could not be gauged by rule and compass. One of her' small hands held a photagraph, the picture of a fair handsome boy — of Claude Wingate when he first came home from school tp spend his holidays Holding by the door the corporal took in the whale scene at g glance. It was amazing £o note how quickly the hard, rugged face of the ntan changed to* look of soft womanly tenderness as he gazed ^tp note the *n|st whi^ftoi4y^lSBnj^l^^hei^ Hl/lmf keen^ -soox«ge&ag;!4syeB, and^dimmed £h£m fib that hjB poufol *psHaeb/Bee; eyes that fca^L1 not quailed wheti the^ fiussian '^e^ions gathered **ound him J&nd; his' devoted com rades o^* f^t p^gy iNorentber jnprning*aj; Inkennan ; eyjas JwSoh iaa looked utrwmk ingly nppn#h« ^rribie line of guns at Bala clava, jrehoee aeathing whirlwind of -she£ and shell he had fronted gallantly, a face that iad ^rown stern and resolute jn the hour of Jinmin^ftfe fjejjl j yet the lagged features, atid the^ashi^ eypg had been unlocked and melted At Sight of a mother ^\$m^0m ihee, Harry BaU^nay hear^ grows '\\*frmfp*o a^ jkmd w%nl^ think ^ thea, wfo»-Gifi£^ '^orld-weafr^^na tired-of the '^aUa Jaw^k^iss/ the '«fit-ilovr*' «hamsf aromid me,4he^mp^y of ifiee ^hd-of thy tendj^ejjtle i»e|rt btufc an^ bittpm^lfe nij remembratfce like ^an «aeis an '^ae^mt^i, ' i Gentitjr -^b 'veteran moped forwanL and ^taQping7J4^?aS igipraajbe^Tfl, ?Uss ^|^iier in iwar^Mj, and|foldea|Sfei^s^teH? hetrt tbat3kew&j;?af* ^gn of ^®ftfe^M^ nn«on/i i3Coli)»fe|9l^ *t 4^^Hg1i «^% JNf^^e' ^^?^^fellt^fe*1^.^ seemediia^at ^e^^mm^-.^i tw^||o(ul| knjt together y^:^^:W:.g^vf'f.t%eml1^1east, felfc- 'aB|l ^ilfittiSa?'; aofcoQwledsred, as ifijouci thlp lieaJin^ wing^tQr fflm gbfa^iftii^pigife-.jwreged near- ; ?- : i^m^Ly^^^LMi yp|t love this «n ?; ..,. ?'3Sp'-^«e^^of- ^'; ihe^uesi^on. corporal. ;'*Pher shyi^l^shins1 face tijjat would hide its^ -#^in -.tj&y; pOTep.talbjepm.-in maid^nlF e»y with;jie* g^pssy i.air, but a grave lepj^feomes 1 :}'^y- oasi&ng.t; yau. must jia-y|ttnd forget thttftjBlande Wingate ever lived,* i ? ♦AT^i^8j-?i; will -pcy, dear fattier,; e«- anewer| afw'r j^panse,.

[ If I.speak unkindlj; it -'is. because I would save- you from vain longings* and hopes which may never be realised. Ijisteni Two young men — schoolfellows, friettds, both born and reared iniibis township of Cran bournen— ; unhappily fell in love with the self-same maiden. 'One of the twain was a- tall, awkward; youth, who had little to. recemmepd , 'him in the eyes of such- a proud, handsome girl as Lucy Fanshawe, bat he loved her Tfith the \rhale force of. a strong and passionate nature. , His rival, ^m the contrary, had such, qualities of disposition and person as won the lady's love, ftjeo 'her hand. The less fortunate friend kept his secret well, and ,betobk himself #nd his misery out of Cranbpurne.-' He entered the army, went abroad, became a. morbid, lonely, and dis agreeable man, until one day in India a little foundling . nestled its tiny arms about his neck, and thereby opened tbe flood gates of that affection which was consuming him. Again.,1 OTty, God has been kind to give me you.' Lena drew down the weather-beaten face close, to her own and kissed, it fervently. ' Dearest fat&er; '.who can gauge your love like the poor foundling ? That friend of your youth a&& favored rival in love was John Wingate '.' . -_' Hnish I In alj these years that have gone he has never even suspected that I, his friend, had.ever felt the tender passion for anyone, much more for his dead wife. Death is the great treasure-house of love. There lies buried 'the., real wealth of passion and of youth. Take the lesson,, Lena, my child.' \- She clung closer to him now. The secret he had imparted in his rough, ^upright way, had revealed' more fully the ? diamond beneath the rude crust. . *? They went down the* broad stairway together aitn-in-arm, and onward to the oak lined chamber, where the Smith walked :t© and fro with, his head gunk upon his breast. , * Jack Wingate ! Halt !. Lift up your head, manj I have news of the prodigal.' The friends face, each other, with Lena between them. *News, good news, Jack, my dear old friend,' continues the veteran. 'Your son r— nay- our son — sailed from Bristol yester day, with the livery of her Majesty upon his back, anda weapon by his side to fight old England's foes. -Look, read for yourself. Hnrrah! We need no orders from Horse Guards. From tHis hour we hold ourselves in readiness to march out of Cranbourne with djums beating and colors nying at one day's npfcice. Kiss me,, Lena ! Damme I I'm. a boy again.' And so we leave them. When we lift the curtain again it will be upon a new land — that Greater Britain at the Antipodes. [End of Book; I,] (TO BE COHTQrtTED.)
