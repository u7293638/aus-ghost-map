Box ing apparently died in tho old couhtry with Tom Sayers, and when champions are required In that lino to-day we must turn to America and Australia. Wrestling has gone to Turkey and Japan; pedestrlanlsm In England is but a ghost of its former self; the- rowing re cords are mado'. by Australian oarsmen; coursing Is. coming on In this country, and slipping back,- or, at any rate, it is at a. standstill at 'ome; cycling 'honm\s fluctuate between t'ho .land of Presidents and pop corn and the land of the .Kangaroo; we have Just kicked a crack English team out at football, and it is merely a matter ot timo when an A-ustraflan-bred horse will bear off the blue riband of the Epsom Derby. Verily, tho old order tfhangeth and goeth under, land ithe new one] cometh out on 'top, and 'waxeth firmer day by day.. It Is in crlckfJt, however, that the chango referred to Is most 'apparent, for at the old country's national gamo it is quite correct to say 'that Australians are now moro Eng lish than the English themselves, 'Our toys' have simply walked over the Eng lishmen this trip, and, so far, their pro gress has been a triumphal march of tho most glorious description. The coming Test match ought 'to end In another v-'In for Australia, for the Lion's ta'l.-is on the drop already, while ttao of the Kangaroo «fands out as stiff ? as a ship's jlbboom. All tho English men's 'hope seems to lie centred in Young, ?A-ho certainly mistook his sphere of life most wofully when ho started off ? as a sailor-man to roam afar, and soil his hands -with the nasty tar. Now ho Is known in tho cricketing world as tho 'Essex hurricane,' and the wonderful left-hander seems to havo earned that tltlo when lie tied up the Australian batsmen at Leyton, and, to quote a modest English scribe, 'The Colo nials' wickcJt3 -wore mowed down one after the other in quick succession, and a stream ; of sadly disappointed batsmen walked from , tlio pavilion to the -wicket, and wicket to . pavilion,, with never-failing monotony.' It | Is very certain, however, that somo of our | ball-punishers have got Mr. Young's mea- ] sure hy this time, however, and when the 'hurricane' arrives ithey will prove that! 'they know enough to 'come in out of the we't,' .'and to stay in against the fiercest blasts' as well. ? ? ; ; Rather a neat suggestion has- been made 'TiyTfilbndoii we'eWy totheedec: that' peo- ple with a taste for speculation can -amuse 'themselves by guessing which member of the Australian team will go down in his tory as the 1S99 failure. It is further stated ; that '.'no Australian team has ever visited : England without producing this curious re sult, vizi, that some player, after, distin guishing himself by .the most brilliant play in Australia, has proved an absolute failure on English fields.' That is something of a I staggerer; but certainly there isno sign of ' U10 present team earning the very doubtful I honor alluded to. 'Our boys' h'avei so. far, played well up to their Australian reputa tion; in fact, some have improved upon It, and so we may safely say that the baneful spell has at last been 'broken; ??.-.-? . * ? * * * : .... ' By way of backing up Its bold remarks,' t'he Journal in question points out that the, most conspicuous failure in this, lino' was W. H.^ Cooper, :who crossed tho 'herring pond' in '84. In Ws own country Cooper ', Was reckoned to be tho, greatest slow- ' bowler; In the world. Ho was able to rnaUo - tho ball 'break' three or four feet, and in ! ?S3 he rattled down the stumps of an Eng- j lishteam like' ninepins! In England, how- [ ever, ho was pasted to 'the four corners ot ? the earth; and occasionally a trifle further; but that is only one side of the case, and no doubt Cooper could show another and a very different one which would account for his failure. ? Tho next 'crack' who -cracked badly on English soil Is a party known 'to ?tho English' scribe as 'Edwin Evans,' prb sumably our worthy friend, 'Ted,' ' who I was indeed a clinker here; but when he travelled, to the old land In 'S6 the Bri tishers found -that 'neither his bowling nor his batting was up to the standard of a de cent public school eleven. And yet only a ; short time' previously Ted had scored in , successive matches in Australia a couple ot centuries, nnd had floored seven wickets ; tor. II), and five for 13 runs, in the same j match.' . It must-be remembered, .however,- ' that 'Ted'- was 37 years old when he went to England, and at that age many men pre- i for a comfortable seat in the pavilion -to a risky standing' place In the field. Besides, Ted Evans had been for a few years a. clerk Ini the ..Civil Service 'here, and. everyone knows- that 'that sort ot slavery- tells on a I man us much -almost as 'twice the 'time ! spent 'in .the prison mines of Siberia. ; 'In ''.'96,' continues this London1 pen jostler, ''every 'English' cricketer was won dorlngiwhy. C. J. Eady had been selected as a 'member of- tho ? Australian ? team that year,'and 'notwlthoutreason, either, for 'he was a dismal failure asa bowler; and almost equally unsuccessful as a batsman.' And ydt; in Australia, Eady was not only a dead bowler, but as a batsman he had ac hieved tho rare feat of scoring two cen turies in 'the samo match.' M'llwralth, Bruce, Jarvls, and Graham are also quoted as frightful examples of cricketers who , played like demons in Australia, and like schoolboys in England; but no doubt ample excuse could bo pu't up for them all. And it sfeems safe to prophesy to-day that, even if there is a failure In tho Australian team of '00, his record will bo quite as good as that of most of the first flight Englishmen ho has mot in the tented field.. Cricket Is certainly a most uncertain game. Bat I think that remark has been mado before — probably a'bout 3G5 times every year since Jack Conway took the flrEt Australian team 'Home' 'In '7S. Somo time ago I mentioned that In my humblo opinion London was a very desir able place for a pure-minded young man to keep away from. Tho sanctified seed sown on that occasion must havo fallen on fer tilo soil, for I now find one of 'M-odern Babylon's' noble array of journalists de claring ho intends to expose 'the lmmor~ allty of cycling in all Its ropulslvo naked ness, so that tho eyes of pure persons may not be shocked by unseemly displays of tho nude, and Satan, maybe, figuratively speak ing, .'warned to keep off tho grass. Strango .to say, this social purity scribe does not seek to shield yfung men from tho danger of gazing upon girls who frolic round in the 'altogether,' but he Intends to start a Society of Moral Organisers, which will havo for its Immediate object tho shielding of young women from the demoralising, but sweetly saduetlvo sight afforded by men who scorch round on their bikes showing a greater stretch of uncovered stockings than even a Lord Bishop would bo justified in displaying. To quoto his own words, ha says: 'Young men now have the awful audacity to ride along in public places with nothing but a woollen stocking gartered abovo tho knee, bctweijn their fat, bulgy Icdian-clublike calves and knobby knees, and thu wide, wide world: *he nature a£ the garments being such that the shape of the Hnib Is indicated so plainly that the most short-sighted of women can see It between the chinks of the fingers she raises to he/ eyes to shut out the sinful sight. 'And,' continues this pious, pure-souled Pressman, 'could anything bo more disas trous for the moral welfaro of our youug women V' It may bo urg-ed In defence that ?things are not what they seem by. half— cotton-wool may ma-squcrado as calf; but 'how is a guileless girl to know that ?
