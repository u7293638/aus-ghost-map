THE MERCANTILE BANK. Melbourne. May 21. Meetings of the shareholders and de positors in the Mercantile Bank were held to-day for the purpose of receiving the report of the liauidators. The chairman, Mr. Ducker, referred to the last balance-sheet of the bank which was tested in court. He still mainfcained that it was wrong. Mr. Thomas Smith interrupted, and said it was no use referring to the ' ghost of their departed glories. ;- They should let the dead past bury its dead. There was no objection to this view, and the chairman said no more on the subject. Mr. Ducker said they had paid two dividends totalling 4s. 2d. in the pound, and now had a cash balance of about £100,000. The total assets, deducting the expenses over valua tion, now amounted to £628,000. They had 600 mortgage properties, but the pre sent time was not ripe for realisation. It was a hard matter to say what the out come would be, but it was hoped that they would be able to declare another dividend of Is. or Is. (3d. shortly, and altogether they hoped to pay dividends amounting to 7s. or 7s. 3d. in the pound above that already paid. The liquidators did not intend to accept deposit receipts at the full face value in exchange for pro perties held by the bank. The report was received.
