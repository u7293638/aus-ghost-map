St. G-eorge's Day. On Monday next, the Statue of Prince Albert, which at present very much resembles the Ghost of Hamlet's Father, will be denuded of his canvas dressing gown, and appear in his "habit as he lived," and the result will be a great ornament to the city, if the representation of the statue as it appears on the tasteful rosettes furnished by Mr. Goddard, of Pitt-street, be any criterion. Mr. Punch will be there on the occasion, and it is to be hoped " the Committee will see the propriety " of according to him and Toby the most distinguished position in the procession.
