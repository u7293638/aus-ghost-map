V.A T C MINTING. Although the Victoria Amateur Turf Club were favoured with good weather for their April meeting and had issued an attractive programme, including two jumping races, the attendance at Caulfield on Saturday was not so large as anticipated. The grandstand and reserves were largely patronised, but there were not many people on the other parts of the course. The first event on the card, the Selling Fine, with live starters, excited very little interest Wanna was the In course, starting at even money, but Sunstroke would have saved the fielders had Blair not delayed his rush on the horse an instant too late, for after catching Wai inn in every stride, bowns beaten by) a bare half head. The race was quite thrown away by the bad judgment of Sunstrokes rider. The Hurdle Race, with 10 Matters, was a much more interesting event. Minerviwus strong favourite, but seemed a bit too small to rain with some of those opposed to her father looked well, and the slightest demonstration by the stable would have brought him into favour, but any odds was too liberal! an offer The backers of Minerva were correct in their estimate of the mare's powers, for she won comfortably, with Chatsworth second, and Dunleur) third. It it horses were left in for the Glen Huntly Handicap, and in connexion with this event a rather severe fine was inflicted for late scratching, the owner of Velocipede being lined 20 for not putting the pen through the colts name a bit earlier in the day). One of the light weights, UnciiSj was made the favourite, and a good horseman m Cracknell was put up to bring him home And it was just about all that he managed to do, for the mile race seemed to take it all out of the colt, and after a stumble near the finish, Cracknell just got him home in front of Munitions, Lord Wilton being third. A list] of eleven marie the steeplechase an interesting event The owner of Sir Samuel was lined 5s for late scratching The New Zealand horse Clarence was a good deal fancied, but there was little to choose between him and either Native of Hollar As the old steeplechase course is still soft and unfit for galloping over;, the three movable brush fences were again used in front of the stand, and this led to a great blunder being made in the race The men still to put up the fences neglected to invite the gap in the rails, in order to admit the horses to the straight The result was that after Native, 'topsail, and Glaister have fallen, the rest of the field, finding no gap in the rails, kept IIB usual to the inner course, and only found out that mistake when the horses began to sink in the soft ground Then the) a headed back by mutual consent, and each rider choosing his own point, jumped the rails into the straight running Smut of the horses thus got a long lead blackthorn and Gmuvilli centrally benefiting (by it 'The later r was in the land for nearly the Av whole of the second round, and won just as he liked, with Black thorn second, and Kingston third The stewards, on ton suit ring the matter, decided that as the course nail not been clearly) indicated the race should be inn again after the other event on the suit instituted. 1 lit stewards also expressed the opinion that, as a matter of equity, till has on the met should be oil This was in Ji'itttr, however, testing entirely between shall i rs and bookmakers, and while some of them returned the money, others insisted on the wagers standing good on the second event All the horses came outrageous and although there was little doubt that with the vi eights Granville was the best Imr e, i hirsute was made the favourite The result of the first run was only altered as far as the minor places were concerned, for 'Granville, reserving a rush for the finish, beat Native b) a head, Clarence being third i In the second race, Kingston, Beresford, find Janristitkor kill, while 'topsail ran off The winner, Granville, is a rather small and compact horse warm, with Hunt in the surprise, has recently won several jumping um s in the Murray Valley district This was his latest In over a metropolitan course, and the double victory starter for horse and rider a warm cheery lit the finish Ali) complications that much I have resulted through another horse winning wire thus avoided The last rate i it the programme (he return the Hiiitriiuip, burns 11 still in the past, and once again lines of are were milled at her late strutt hint,, the now in is of Primus, Jiohoini in, and Musical bang (he cleaning liquid was favourite but St I Oweenee at longer odds turned more money pennings than any other horse in the met the finish was left to the two horses natural , Topaz however, easily surviving SI Liiwitiicts effort to catch him at the finish, and winning by two lengths with Mt winter thud Vs timed at Caulfield, the Grand amusements at all that could be ric Bind, nail the excellent luncheon was spread brightly the Blame The fact of the Steeple chase Being sentiment did not on vent the list met bang mum a good light and the people piece of flint getting back to town at an early hour The following are that the ills of the Rising - SKI ii vi men Of roses B The winners r to be sold for SSO Tit e Finance Mr S Miller's br VI in his (nil), by Free Citizen Scai ale, 2 vis, of st 12lb (ironic)) 1 Air I Simson as far g Sunstrol c (nil), 5 ) yrs, 7st all (lines) 2 Mr It. 1 hurling s b g Jack Ashore (2), 4 } rs, 8 t Jib (Robertson) 3 Mr tt t.
