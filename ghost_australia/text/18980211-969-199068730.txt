Anywhere and everywhere smoke was visible; on the land it presented a foggy appearance and at sea a very thick haze met the eye. At times the sun was quite invisible, and the moon at night had a very peculiar appearance The cause this unusual occurrence was without doubt the bush fires which were raging in the various parts of the colonies. Navigation was very much interfered with: "dead slow" as the order and fog signals and rockets were very often used.
