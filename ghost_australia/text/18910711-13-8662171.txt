THE RELATIONS OF CAPITAL AND LABOUR. ADDRESS BY THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. In the course of a recent address at Hu the Archbishop of York spoke as follows the most prominent topic of the day to t working men of that city -"Let me a; word to you on what I think ought to said to the possessors of power, and 5 out the possessors of power It is not my v> 01 It was given a very long ago, it was given to engage in the Book I hope you prize and lo' The message I have to give you as possess' of power is this God has spoken once twice have I heard it said, power belongs unto God ' Power is God's gift love er is Got trust, and the man who possesses power I don t care in what measure or in w h degree-has something given him by God use rightly for the service of his fellow me and for the honour and glory of Him! gave him that power , he has a solemn time; for which he has to render account to Him who gave it God has gi-, on you my friend great power and you will have to be accept able to him for the use of it And what the rule that He gives us as regards the u of power? It is tins He that ruleth ov men's whether the rule be large or small whether it is the rule of a father over family or a statesman over a peoples' that ruleth over men must be justly be just' ruling in the fear of God That is the law and that is to rule for all possessors of powers plause) and I venture to say to v< that the message of the church of which am a minister, and the message of love true minister of God amongst you, is this you have power-and YOU have it-use just use it rightly , use it not merely for your own gain and ad vantage , use it looks as the Bible sayS, not every man upon li own things, but every man upon the trial of another, be guilty of no injustice i jealousy, watching yourselves lest you should be guilty of injustice, and rule in the fear a God as those who have to give an account it Power is a dangerous thing for any me to possess Absolute power is a terrible thing for any man to have You may have heard-perhaps people have told you he wicked and cruel and selfish emperors and kings and nobles were long ago Why were they so wicked and cruel and selfish' Because they were kings and nobles Not bit of it, but because they were men and had absolute power over others It was the human nature in those men that vast perv cried and betrayed by the possession i too much power over their fellow men No, you are going to have a great deal of powe I am not going to tell you to night whether you are going to have too much power, tin is not my business, that is politics, I an not going to have any politics to nigh (Laughter and applause.) The Church < Christ has no politics (Hear, hear, and as plause) It is my opinion that it is very easy thing for an Archbishop of York to have too much politics I am not going to trouble you with a word of politics, but I am only going to say this-that if you have immense power you have immense responsibility And, speaking as a representative be amongst you of the Church of Christ, so that the Church, in her 1,800 years of life has confronted all manner of Governments all manner of rule, and that she has no red son to fear wherever the seat of power ma be, when the holders of that power are just and righteous, and merciful men (Applause Of course, we are all aware that great social problems are the problems of the future the great questions are arising between labour and capital in this country And there are not a few persons he say that the minister of religion in general, and the clergy of the Church of England especially, should give themselves up entirely to the study of the question that they should read for instance books on political economy especially , that they should read up John Stuart Mill and Mr Fawcett, and Mr Herbert Spencer and Mr George, and I do not know how many other persons and that, having read up all these and formed their minds very careful 16 on the subject, that they should come forward to act as mediators and arbitrators for you in all the disputes between capital and labour Well, I have a very sincere respect for the clergy of the Church of England that I need not say, but there are some where about 23 000 of them, and if you see all of them to read up all these books on political economy, I think the result will be that they will get into a very mixed condition, and that they will not be by any means unanimous in their advice and counsel total for this reason, that these political economists are not agreed amongst themselves That is one reason why I think they would not be particularly useful in this respect to you I think that there is another reason and that is that they do not possess and I do not see why they should be expected to possess-that technical knowledge of your business and your affairs that would make them useful arbitrators If a man wants to mediate between two of men who an differing about a matter of business surely his first qualification should be that he knows the business they are disputing about If he does not, he will only be meddling and will end in muddling (Laughter ) I do not know was whether you have am sure I hope you have not-but, if you had any trade dispute here in Hull, and you were good enough and trustful enough to say -' Well, we will leave it to our new Archbishop to settle it, and, if I were unwise enough and I am not unwise enough to set about settling it, I should want the essential requisite of technical knowledge Suppose it was a dispute about ships and shipping, I should want to know something about the work of the stevedore and the work of the upper, the wages that he ought to get, and how much he gets what are the co editions of capital, what is the condition of the ships, and the repairs of the ships, and a vast number of other things about which I know nothing at ill and the result would be that I should make a mess of it with the best possible intentions I will give you another reason When we read our books of political economy we read about labour and capital on nearly every other page labour with a very big L and capital with a very big C. sLaughter ) Labour and capital I Well now, it is all very well to write and read about labour with a big L and capital with a big C, but what I want to know is, has any man in this room ever seen labour with a big L and capital with a big C," outside a book I never have What you do see is not labour and capital, but you see labourers and capitalists, and that is a very different thing , because, when you come to deal with labourers and capitalists, you come to deal with that queer old world old fashioned, mysterious difficult thing that you do not find in books, but that you do find in men and women, which we call human nature (Hear, hear) I think that you will agree with me that there is a great deal of human nature about men (Laughter ) If you come to settle what labour is to do for capital, and what capital is to do for labour, it is all very well in the book, but when you come to deal with men in the shop, in the factory, in the street, with their passions and their prejudices, with their needs, with their aspirations, with their sorrows, with their trials, with all the infirmities which infect and weaken our human nature, it is not so easy a thing to arrange the relations between those who suffer and toil and those whom they look upon as free from toil and suffering It is not so easy a thing to adjust men and women and children as it is to adjust words with a book, and, therefore, I do not think you would be wise in going to the clergyman of the parish or even to the archbishop of the province to settle all these trade disputes I heard with the greatest delight what the representatives of your trade societies said to night about conciliation and boards of arbitration and that I confess is what I should like to see growing more and more amongst you Shall I tell you how the Apostles, whom we are bound to follow, settled a question of money long ago ' It has always, seemed to me very instructive There was a dispute in the early days of the Christian Church about the distribution of money, very much what it is about now-(laughter)-and there was a murmuring between the Christians and Hebrews-two different classes and they came to the Apostles to complain to ask them to settle it Now what did the Apostles say ' They said It is not met it that we should leave the Word of God to serve tables We have something else to do , we have to study the Word of God. and care for your souls but we are not indifferent to your bodies by any means-only we think you can manage this matter better than we can They said 'Choose you out seven men from amongst you who can settle this business and the saying pleased the multitude, and they chose seven men who were full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and those seven men disposed of the question justly and reason able at any rate, we read no more of it in history Now, I venture to say to you, my dear friends, and I would say the same to your employers and capitalists if I were addressing them, choose You out of your own body honest men, and if you can find them Christian men-'applause)-choose you out men who desire to be just, choose you out men who feel that their fellow men are brothers in Christ, and that they must think as much of them as they think of themselves Choose such a board of conciliation or arbitration (call it what you like), choose honest kindly men, choose practical men who know what they are dealing with Settle them together to consider what is right, and I believe that out of that conference there can come more good than would come out of reams of political economy and armies of political spouters stirring you up to strife (Applause) I have seen a good deal late in some of the papers in this Northern Province of conferences held by ministers (the gospel of all denominations to try an find out why) working men don't go church, and I have seen a great number < answers given by working men One w orkin man say) she does not go to church because he is very tired on Sunday, and another say) she does not go because he does not like the service, and a good many more reasons good, bad, and in different Well, now, this reminds me of what happened to myself a good many years ago in a club in London Aver) linean highly cultured young gentleman came up time and said My) dear Bishop, it is a very strange thing ver) sad thing rather-tim none of the cultured classes go to church Now, don't ) you think there is something very wrong with the church a ' No. ' I say: 'don't you think there is something went wrong with the cultured classes * (Laughter Now, I should like my dear friends the working men to consider this question Before you settle why the working man does not go to church you must find settle why he should go Unless you' do, there is no use asking why he does not go It seems to me that a man goes to church to meet God , he goes to church to meet his Say four, who has said, ' Where two or three of you are gathered together in M name there am I in the midst of yOU,' h goes to church, if he is a communicant, the lie may receive those elements that shall become the strength and refreshment of his soul He goes there for that, and do you mean to tell me that a man as he goes for the is to be altogether hindered because he does not like the parson ' If men are hungry in their souls they go to their church to have their souls feel and you may depend upon that a man is not very hungry) who is always finding fault with his food (Hear, hear ) Do this, throng the churches, and you will soon discover that the parsons will tim a way to satisfy the people That is there reason why you should go there is one reason and one excuse that working men have for not going to church, and I entirely s) breathing with it. It is when a man says ' What is the use of my going to church when there is no place for me to sit in' (Ap please) I feel for the working man in his maul) self respect, who comes to church and finds a great square pew with perhapsonetnan in it, and the door locked, and, if it is not turned with the key, with a sour face behind it, and a look of ' What business have you in my pew? I should like to live beseeched) where every church in this kingdom, from north to south and east to west, was free and open (loud- applause) to high and low, rich and poor, w here they kneel in the presence of Him who was the Maker and Judge and the Saviour of us all I hope in time, in spite of difficulties and there are difficulties that the thing will come to pass, that the churches will be free and open to all men (Applause ¡ I have a word or two to say to you on educa tion on religious education You see, at any rate, I am not afraid of touching upon rather burning topics There is a great controversy going on about religious education and I believe that it is getting hotter What is the controversy about? The controversy is not really whether religion should be taught in our schools If you polled all England the immense majority would insist that their children should have some religious education in the schools The difficulty is this that we disagree as to what kind of religion shall be taught You will tell us that we ought to legislate to remove some of these difficulties but it is not so easy to do it b)ac of Parliament (Hear, hear ) Suppose there were in every home and every family of the working class real religious education Suppose that every mother brought her child to her knees morning and evening, and taught that child to say, ' Our Father, which art in Heaven ' Suppose that every father of a family, when ever his labour would give him time, were to gather his children around him and say) to them, Let us kneel down and pray to our father, and would tell them in a few words of the Father in Heaven who had sent His Son to die for them, and of the Holy Spirit, who would guide them safely through the tangled ways of life and that thus he and his wife were to strive to bring up their children in the fear and the nurture and the admonition of the Lord-I doubt whether there would be half the same difficulty or a tenth of the same difficulty about the education of those children in the schools The real difficulty about school religious education is the lack of family religion, and the lack of family religion is not confined to the working men It is quite as common in the other classes What we do want in this country, above all things, is religious family education Man made the school, God made the family, and the family. is the place where the love and the fear of God should be taught (Hear, hear ) '
