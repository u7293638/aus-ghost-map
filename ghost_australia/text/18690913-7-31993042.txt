VI—RELIGIOUS. THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE FIRST MEETING. On Monday afternoon, August 30, a meeting of ministers and members of Evangelical Churches in South Australia was held at the Veatry of the Presbyterian Church, Flinde[?] street. Th-re wa, ? Urg e gathering of minuter, ami laymen, and the X.-v. U. H. H.tdge having beeu vot*tl t>> the ch?ir, ull?l on the Kev7 Jaunea Way to off or prayer. The Chaibman then announced that the ob- I ject of the meeting ?ii to diacuaa a draft coo stitutiou of the proposed Evangelical Union. He stated that he had only hastily glanced through the Constitution, but he believed it was such that if its pcioctplca were worked out, it would tend to the benefit of the individuals connected with the Society, and of the Churches with whom such individuals were Mtoaated. fite Rev. J. LtaLL announced having re ceived a letter from the Rev. Mr. NichoUa. of Brighton, expressing his warm sympathy in tba movement, and his extreme regret that he was unable to be present that afternoon. THE DRAFT COXSTfTUTIOS. The meeting ttuttt p;oeeed?d to discuss the Draft Constitution as submitted to the minister* assembled on the previous Monday afternoon. "OansAi. Pbinciples.—L ThatthisAUiaace is not to be considered an alliance of denomina tion* or branches of the Church, bat of indivi dual Christians, each acting on bit own respon sibility.** Tliii wm c4itu-<{ smbont discussion. •' 11. That iv this Alliance it ia distinctly de clared that no ouiprottiue of the views of any member, or sanction of thorn* of others on the VoinU wherein they differ is either required or expected, but that alt are held as free as before to maintain and advocate Ibeir religious convic tions, with due forbearance and brotherly love." Witlt respect to this principle, Mr. BOBFORD started a discussion. He thought it dasbei with .the article " object*," and he asked for information as to whit were the prevailing errors against which Christian truth vu to be defended. Did it refer to the differ ences among themselves? The Chairman said it was pretty well known what the prevailing errors referred to ware—the errors which were s|K?kon of were fundamental, and were well known without aptiiking more specifically. The Key. Mr. Jeffebis remarked that differ ences among tbennelves would not be consi dered as prevailing ?rrora. Dr. CampbeiX suggested that if weir differences were to be considered prevailing errors, no basis of evan gelioal alliance could take place. (Ciieera.) Me movwd, and Mr. Cummino seconJed the adop tion of this principle. Mr. ?. W. Cotton wtuhed to know distinctly if it was un derstood that they weie not to discuss the divergence of tbeir religious view*. Unless this were definitely known, he could not be one of the Alliance. The Key. Mr. HeMOEBSOS said do compromise whatever of any of their respec tive denominational principles was intended. The Key. Mr. Caselt thought there nLould be a liroj Jor basis of union, lie that of the Evan gelical Alliance of Kugtand, because with out such a basis they might have minis ters of the Uuitarian and Moinau Catholic Churches coming iuto their uiidat. The Rev. Mr. STOTCLL moved the adjourouient of this and the third priuoqiU) uutil after the b*au of the Alliance was detenniu?d on the article respecting mciuberahi|>. This was carried. " Membership.—That the persoua who com pose the Alliance shall be members of Evangelical Churches, or those who are recommended by the minister of the congregation with which tbey elatedly worship." At the request of the Rev. Mr. Millard, the Sbcbetart (Key. 3. Jefferis) read the following as the doctrinal basis of tbe Evangelical Alliance of England :— "That the parties composing tbe Alliance shall be such persons ouly as boM *ud maintain i what are usually understood to be Evangelical views in regar-1 to the matters of doctrine un derstood, namely.— ' "1. Tne divine inspiration, authority, and sufficiency ot tbe Holy Scriptures. "2. The right and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. '3. The Unity of the Godhead, and tbe Trinity of Persons therein. *' 4. The utter depravity of human nature in consequence of the fall. "5. The Incarnation of the Son of God, His work of atonement for sinners of mankind, and His mediatorial intercession and reign. '• 6 The justification of the sinner by faith alone. "7. The work of the Holy Spirit in the con version and sanctification of the sinner. '* 8. The immortality of tbe soul, the resur rection of tho body, tbe jadgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of tbe righteous and tbe eternal punishment of the wicked. "9. The Divine institution of the Christian ministry and tbe obligation and perpetuity of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. *• It is, however, distinctly declared:—First, that this brief summary is not to be regarded in any formal or ecclesiastical sense, as a creed or confession, nor the adoption of it as involv ing an assumption of the right authoritatively to define the limits of Christian brotherhood; but simply as an indication of the class of per sons whom it is desirable to embrace within the alliance. Second, that the selection of certain tenets, with the omission of others, ia not to he held as implying that the former constitute tbe whole body of important truth, or that the latter are unimportant." Tbe Key. Mr. Millard moved that tbey adopt that as their basis. Unless they did so he believed they would go sadly astray and meH with insuperable difficulties in declining to associate with persons who denied the Deity of the Lord Jesus OhrUt; or the Deity and personality of the Holy Ghost, or the cardinal doctrine of justification by faith alone. (< beers.) The Rev. Mr. Bonn seconded. Seeing the amount of time and ability ' devoted to thfl preparation of the con stitution of tbe British Evangelical Alliance he thought they need not hesitate to adopt it, especially after the manner in which tbe AUiance had worked together, and the good it had aocomplished. A question then aroae as to whether it would not be better to submit the j points of tbe doctrinal basis to the meeting teriatim. and Mr. Mill&bo; moved the adoption of the first item—tho doctrine of the Divine inspiration, authority, and mifuitnry of the Scriptures. Tbe Bev. Mr. Jbttesis expressed feeling considerable difficulty ia providing for > a subscription to any creed. He belonged to a Church that didn't like to pat their hands to creeds of human devising, and be feared they would be narrowing the membership ineal culaWy if they ventured to adopt a basis of this kind. Mr. Brmro?O thought if they carried the doctrine of the Divine inspiration, authority, and sufficiency of the Scriptures that that need be the only basis of union. Mr. Earl felt convinced that if they undertook to make a creed and to com pel every one to subscribe to it, that they would and considerable difficulty in carrying on the Alliance with any degree of success. He vi no necessity for making creeds of human making when they had a Divine creed. The Rev. Mr. Jefferis remind*.! Mr. Earl that nearly all the heresies with which the Church had been afflicted had been found in the Scriptures. (Cneen.) The Key. Mr. Patchcu. questioned very much if they could have an Evangelical Alliance without a doctrinal basis. He was pre pared to unite heartily with the Evangelical ministers, but he was not prepared to unite with men who denied cardinal doctrines. The Rev. Mr. WRIGHT remarked that if they simply carried the first doctrine, the Unitarians would be admitted, and he could as soon unite with a man who denied the divinity and work of the Holy Ghost in the conversion of souls as he could with Unitarians. Mr. Corrog <?U car tain that if they were to have an Evangelical Alliance it most be on some such basis as that of the Alliance of England. Dr. CAHmix thought the additional dawe at the end of the doctrinal basis of tbe English Alliance tended so nullify almost entirely what the basis set forth and he thought if they were going to discuss a doctrinal basis they would get into a great muddle and into many **&?• ??fa>Mi. mm .ooptodS •nuat he aoaas isrVsiiiij bebaad at by whack -^wdd wSitoA, o^i t2 Per.
