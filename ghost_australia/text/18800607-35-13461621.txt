VICTORIA THEATRE. Tho performance at tho Victoria Theatre on Saturday night was for the benefit of the champion oars- man of the world, Edward Trickett; und was tendered to him by Mr. John Bennett, as a valedictory upon | his approaching departure for England, where ho is , to meet the American champion, Hanlon, in a rowing I contest, to decide who shall thereafter wear tho aquatic belt. There was a large attendance, excepting in the dress cirole, which displayed a heggarty array of empty benches. The piny chosen for the occasion was " Hamlet," the part of the Royal Dane being essayed by Mr. S. H. Teece, Miss Laura Wiseman taking the charac- ter of the fair but unfortunate Ophelia. The other parts were cast in tho same manner as when the play was pro- duced a few weeks ago with Mr. Fairclough in the title role, and worked smoothly enough from beginning to end. It is, of course, impossible to compare the perform- ance of an amateur with that of a professional actor, but it is due to Mr. Teece to say that his interpretation of the character is an intelligent and in- telligible one, although anything but faultless. His action was good, but his voice was decidedly against him, being quite unfitted for such a difficult character; and,in addition to this, there were one or two liberties taken with the text that we hardly think wero justified. Miss Wiseman is a good actress in her own line, but she was considerably over- weighted by being cast for such a part as that of the unfor- tunate daughter of Polonius. Mr. Hall's First Gravedigger Is too well known to require commendation, and the same may be enid with regard to Mr. Vincent's assumption of the Ghost, whilo there was but little fault to Be found with the other performers. This evening, Mr. und Mrs. Lingaid open for a short season, in " Stolen Kisses." j
