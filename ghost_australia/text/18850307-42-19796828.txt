The betting was 5 to 4 against Commotion, 4 to 1 against Malua, and 3tol against Off Colour. A good start wm effected. Off Colour was quickest away, but soon gave place to Metal, who cut out the running at a good pace for half-a-mile, when he gave place to Plausible. Commotion led into the straight, and, despite the deter mined effort of Malua, who cams through very fast, the favourite won easily by three lengths; Off Colour, a head away, third.
