LADIY- C HETWYND'B -SPECTRE, SHAPTER XXXV. THE POTTE5ALL BUST. , 'It's all up :for to night,'she mattered in her Hindoo tongue. 'I must bide my time and watch my ehanoe. It will come soon, if I am ready. This pale faced young girl, with her baby face, shall'not crowd my young mis tress from her; rightful position as Lady of Ohetwybd. I will destroy her as I would an insect.' She shobk her head in fierce menac ing at the Abject of her hatred,and then growing nfindfnl of her own safety,and not wishiig to risk an encounter with Gilbert Monk, she crept on the narrow spirial satirceee to the upper room and the balcony crouching there in the shadowsrAnd awaiting a chance of sceape, She hPbd not long to wait.

Joman darted down the outside staircase on the instant, and was away in the shadow of the trees almost with the rapidity of thought. She concealed herself in a secure position at a little distance, at a point commanding a view of the door of the chalet.' . Her escape was immediately dis covered.T Bernice had informed Monk of thesieg'o she had endured in his absence. and on entering the chalet Monk's first movement was to search thoroughly for Ragee. He examined the closets. the spiral staircase, the up per room, and the balcony and returned ed to Bernice with the information that the old woman had escaped. I ,'Youi are safe now with me, Berg nice,' he 'said. Rages has hurried homeI am positive. She would not dare to- isk a meeting with me. You are pale and worn out. Let me taae you from this place as soon as possible. Flack has been staying in the neigh. bourhood since he brought me the news of your departure from Mawr OCstle, and i found him on the edge of the park as I went to the house. I sent him to Ohetwynd by Sea for a carriage, and he will drive you to Eastbourne directly. He is to be in waiting at the lower gate of the park, nearest' the village. Here are your clothes. It will be well to lay aside those wet garments as soon as poa sible: -Bernice assented, and Monk went outside the chalet and closed the door. Yoang Lady Obhetwynd secured it on itsjinier side, again barricaded the her wet garmaents fordry ones as- ra. pidly as the swollen and painful state of her sprained wrist would allow. She was soon warmly clothed. She rolled . up her damp garments and packed them into her travelling-bag. tier white silk robe, which had so ably served in her appearance as a spectre, was quite dry. She examined it carefully. It had been gathered up about her waist when she had fallen into the lake,and was not torn nor damaged. She had not worn it during her occoup ancy of the lonely garret, and it would have been still in good order but for the fact that the wetting it had receive had somewhat diLoloured it. She was abouttoroll up the gown when Monk knocked cautiously upon the door. Dropping the garment. Bernicehastened to admit him. 'I am almost ready, Gilbert,' she said 'I have only to pack this dress.' 'That dress has served your purpose Bernice.' said Monk 'yon will not want It longer. Give it to me will you c noti'a 'What can'you want of it, Gilbert? Youwant to make sure that I shall e play the ghost no more at Ohetwynd Park? I cannot promise that I shall c o√Ωit ;do' that, and I cannot give up lhe drees.' She rolled up the robe deftly, and thrust it into her travelling bag. She a was attired in her broaze gray cash more robe and jacket, and it only re- r mained to put on her bat. While she a was thus completing her attire, Monk v pout out the remaing fire,scattering the e embers on the hearth, and extinguished e the lantern, which he restored to the a closet from which he hadwithdrawn it. Then he arranged the furniture, which a Bernice had piled up in the form .of a barricade, in its usual order, and con- a ducted young Lady Ohetwynd out of the chalet. SThey halted outside while ha locked the door, and Bernice then placed her arm in his, and they moved onamong the shadows, keeping a vigilant and apprehensive look out around them. The girl's recent terror was still strong upon her, and Gilbert Monk knowing as she could not, the wicked and piti 1as nature of the old Hindoo woman, htilf expected to see Bernice fall at his side under the knife thrust.o-bulle?t?if the Iurking "asasslinT"l But no attack was made upon the young marchionees, They wound along the narrow and dusky paths avoiding the wider moonlit avenues and one or or twice they halted at some rustic seat that Bernice might rest; but at last they approached the lower end o? the park, and the small gate leading out upon the open highway. 'I always carry a key to this gate,' said Monk, producing the key in ques tion from his pocket. I generally cross the park when I go to the village, Mgpwe ap eo a4 tiof wi ?Bg, . spears, tipped with bronze like the fence, which had been modelled after the fence-if farce it may be called inclosing the Imperial gardens at Paris. Monk unlocked and opened it, and led Bernice out into the public road. As he had said,the fly was in waiting. It was an antiquated vehicle that might have been a relic of the days of the Georges, and was drawn by a big bony horse which stood pawing the ground restlessly. Flack was on the box, whip in hand. He raised his hat to the young lady and his master. Monk assisted Bernice into the vehicle. He hesitated about accum panying her to Eastbourne. He feared leathe should be missed from the Park, and he had another task to do on this night-a task which he dreaded, but demeed necessary to the success of his plans, and even to his own well being. But he dreaded not to run any risk of losing Bernice again. To place her safely in the hands of Mrs Growl was the first and most important movement to be made. Upon the safe custody of Bernice all his plans lingered. He decided therefore to accompany her to Eastbourne. 'To Mrs Orowl's lodgings, Flack,' he ordered in a low voice, with a piercing glance round him. 'And be lively. We've a long drive before us and I have other business ton hand to night.' He sprung lightly into the vehicle and closed the door. The fly rolled heavily along the road on its way to Eastbourne. Ly Ohetwynd by Sea. It was was not yet out of sight,when the dusky withered face of the old Hindoo woman was pressed against the spears of the gate, and bead like eyes glittered as Bagee muttered 'To Mrs Orowl's I A long driveI He must be going to Eastbourne, ehi To Mrs Growl's lodgings'at Eastbourne I'm going to Eastbourne to morrow. She laughed softly, a strange, low, hissing laugh. She was about to retrace her steps to the great house when a sudden remem. branco of Monk's later words recurred to her. ' He said he had other business on hand to-night,' she said to herself with a star. ' What busineesel. find that he is deeper than I thought. Bo'll bear watching. I'll know what his ' other business' is. Missy won't be troubled if I am absent all night. She trusts me. So I'll wait and watch him! He'll be ba-k at this gate by two o'clock and I'll be here too.' She sought out a place a deeper sha dows and crouched upon the ground, wakeful anl watchful, her eyes gleam ing turugo?.-.ea.clm' like the eyes of a waiting beast of piey;-nuuur-.u. settled herself to waitwith thepatience of her race and sex, Meanwhile the antiquated fly and occupants were proceeding swiftly along the road to Chetwynd-by-Sea. Monk put out his head when they passed the rectory and the church. His ' business' lay at the Ohetwynd parish church, and he was in haste to return and enter upon it. Bernice look also out upon they othic church with its slender gray stone spire, and she shuddered, and said ' Oh Gilbert how much I owe you! I cannot think of the horrorof my being buried alive without growing frightened and trembling. You have saved my life twice, and I owe you a debt of gratitude greater than I can ever pays' 'I ask no pay but your confidence and trust. Bernice,' replied the schemer byI want you to realize that I am you rest friend, and that my highest object in life is to secure your happiness and comfort.' 'I do feel it,' said Bernice, fervently a tremor in her sweet young voice, and I do trust you, Gilbert. No broth could be tenderer to a sister,more care ful of her, more loving than you have i been to me.' 'Monk pressed her bhand respectfully as a brother might have done. Bernice was sitting in the sheen of the moon's rays, and her pure, proud face, dark and clear like a purse, pale and olive was turned towards Monk. Her sen sitine lips were touched with vivid scarlet. Her eyes of soft dusk gleedw and buried under her broad frank t brows and. her dusky hair fell around her shoulders in floating waves. t Her wonderful beauty made a sudden and striking impression upon Gilbert SMonk. He had see her often during t the past year, and had watched the unfolding of her glorious loveliness, but he had never appreciated the change in her as at this moment. 'By Jove l'he thought ' she's as proud and pure and noble in character as she wonderfully beautiful, I wonder--I wonder-' In all his life Gilbert Monk had never thought of love. He had intended to-msrryi rich-wife but only for the sake of securing td himself luxury and position. In all his schemes concerning Bernice he had never once thought of love. But now as helooked upon her vivid beauty, so rare so sweet so pure, sudden thrill, shot through his sluggish veins,.and quickened the beat ing ofhis heart. It was the thrill of an awaking love. They entered Eastbourne after their brisk drive and Flack drove.into the retired street which Mrs Orowl had taken lodgings. The fly presently halted before the door of a three storied brick house one of a. row of isiar b91 ' . I a This is the place,' said Monk, open e ins the door of the carriage .nd r springing out.

He saw her in the park,dressed in white and looking ethereal and nn real in the moonlight. He talked excitedly about her. He said he was convinced that it was no illusion that he saw her glorified spirit. Those were his very words, and as he is so thoroughly aroused and excited he may come upon a hint of the truth: Did you see her!' 'Yes, missy, I saw her.' Miss Monk leaned forward in uncon trollable excitement. 'Well I' she questioned eagerly. ' What was shel A ghost or a wo manu' 'A woman missy.

And yet why should he wish to ruin mel He rescued her from tke tomb. It's all plain to me now. Aid he has some object in defending her. But what can it be. He did not love her.' 'I can see into the mystery,' said the old'Hindoo woman, her dusky face glittering. 'The truth is Gilbert has found out the secret. She is of nosble blood-one can tell that by her bh'ohtly air, her patrician beauty,her highbreeding. She looks like's princess at the least. I can see Gilbert's game now. He means to allow you to marry my lord, and he will then restore my lady to her own frienda and relatives, and feather his own nest.' S'But what will then become of met I should be no wife II should be set adrift?-? 'Yes missy, but perhaps Mr Gil" bert would not permit things to goiso far. Perhaps he will not allow you to marry my losd. Gilbert is a selfish fellow, and means to look out for him self, and he won't care what becomes of you. I~think he brought my lady here to play ghost.

He will take her to London, and conceal her there until he is ready to disclose the fact that she lives.' 'Then I'll go to London too,' said Hindoo with a resolute gleam in her eyes. 'I'll be more than a match for him. Miss Monk allowed herself to be dressed in her luxurious Eastern style and at nine o'clock was ready for her breakfast. She bade Rages await her return to her chamber, and descended to the breakfast room. Lord Chetwynd was already there, and Gilbert Monk followed her in immediately,looking somewhat haggard and wearied, Miss Monk was very amusing, with forced gayety but Obhetwynd was un usually silent and abstracted. ' Anything I can do for you in town SylviaT inquired Monk, carelessly as he received his second cup of coffee at the hands of the waiter. Have you any commands for jewellery, dress maker, bootmaker, or milliner? I shall be pleased to execute any wish you may entertain. I am going up to London to night.' 'Ah indeed I' said Miss Monk. 'I, you will inquire when my opal bracelet will be finished, I shall be obliged. Shall you begone long1' 'A day or so-possib'y a week. Scotsby and Newman expect me, and business'is business you know.' Lord Chetwynd made no allusion to the 'spectre' of the previous evening, and he scarcely spoken even in response to Sylvia's gay remarks. His grave stern face was not very encouraging to Gilbert Monk but that young man after breakfast followed his lordship to the library, and coolly asked him for a loan of two hundred pounds. The loan was readily granted, and a cheque for the amount was placed by Monk in his pocket book with the expression of apparently the most sincere grati tude. 'I apply to you as a brother, you know, Chetwynd,' said Moak. in his boyish way. 'I'll pay you some day if 1 am able. And I'll never forget you kindness. You look glum. Pardon me Ohetwynd but I trust that you hav'n't quarrelled with Sylvias 'By no means,' returned Lord Chet. wynd hastily, his fair face:flushing.

I was out until after midnight, searching the park. I had a suspicion that your lordship might have been the sport of some beautiful unprincipled woman who desired to trade upon her resemblance to Bernice, or that some enemy of your lordship's might have been playing a a trick upon you. I think your former explanation is the true one, that you are not well, and that yourspectre is but an optical illusion.' Ohetwynd shook his head. 'I shall see Hartright to-day,' he said quietly. 'But I know that the beautiful vision that haunts me is not the freak of a disorded imagination. And the face I saw last night-and have seen before-is not the face of an 'unprincipled woman.' It is the face of an angel. Monk.' added his lordship abruptly,' if I had not myself laid my darling in the tomb-if I had not seen her face day after day in her coffin- if did not absolutely know that she is dead-I should think that there had been some hideous mistake, and that my darling lives.' 'The 'spectre' must must have been strangely like Lady Chetw3 nd to leave an impression like that.' 'ton are wrong. It was not so like my darling Gilbert. The spectre has a beauty which my Bernice lacked,but the same glorious soul that animated my darling looked out from the pure and lovely face of this-this ghost! Bernice in heaven must look like this radiant vision.' 'Perhaps,' suggested Monk,,'there is truth in the theories of the return of spirits. Talk with the rector and the doctor Obetwynd.' 'I will. I sea you think me fanciful Gilbert. Perhaps 1 am,' and he sighed. Monk soon after took his leave. Lord Ohetwynd paced the floor after his departure, with his head dropped low on his breast, and murmured 'Did ever man before marry one woman with all his soul bound up in another, I wonder I ] begin to shrink from this projected marriage with Sylvia. It seems as if Bernice meant to reproach me for my haste, yet she desired me to marry Sylvia after a year of mourning had passed. Why does she come back to me?
