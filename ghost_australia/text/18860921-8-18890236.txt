Fire Stronger than Faith. As Ion" ago as we can remember, says the HaverhiUGazclte, an imposing individual used to travel about New Tork State and Connecticut mostly in the rural districts-violating sacred things by healing in the name of the " Father and -the Son and the Holy Ghost." Ho took a goodly number of well-worn, cast- off canes and crutches with him as convincing proof of his powers, which were always displayed at tho country hotel where he stopped. Patients came for miles to be healed, and we are informed that they always left their crutches and canes when they returned. In one case, an old lady had been bed-ridden for years, and this great healer was summoned to cure her one evening. He entered the room bearing a tallow candle, placed his hand upon her head, and commanded her to rise and walk. She told lum firmly and conclusively that she could not, and after repeating his solemn command three times with no avail, the doctor lost his patience and said: "Then perish in the flames," suiting his action to the words by attempting to set fire to the bed with the convenient candle. Thereupon the old lady, who had not walked for many years, 3umped up, ran to the kitchen and threatened to drive the doctor from the house with an uplifted broom. This is but one of the remarkable mind cures performed at that period. The present system is rather more (esthetic and is not sacriligious, but no doubt it operates somewhat similar.
