WALKING FISH. -Â» When one hears or reads of fish that walk one thinks uiHlinctivoly of the lung fishermen fish those curious creatures, Burma's of an ancient fauna, that seem to have made some advance towards becoming amphibians and stopped short on the road. It is only natural that one abtmltl recall them in this connection When the Australian lung dall was first described (swathe " London Standard ") it was sad to leave the Streams and go out among the reeds and rushes on the Hats, which are left uncovers at low lust, and settlers averred that on still nights they often heard it moves on the river bank This however, have been shown not to be the case though it is probable that all the three lung' lull-from Africa, Australia, and South America roipociively-cm move easily through the i losses of up late vegetation in their native rivers and swamps The n uno " walking Ilsli " is generally given to some small species allied to the Robes of our own i coasts, and found on the shores and eatuancB of West Africa and the countries bordeiiiuthoIndo-Facillc Bunks, in his 'Journal," speaks of the very singular phenomenon I resented by those Uah, which, he says, were about the size of and a grade minnow, and had two very stating breast lines to mil hn part often found them in very few places where it was at first thought they had been left by the tide 1 further observation showed that the Ilsli had chosen their Bitu Witton voluntarily Sir Joseph fixed his attention upon one flat, and pay s that it immediately fled, leaping as nimbly as a frog, by means of its breast him not did it seem to prefer water to I and, for if been in the water it often leaped out and proceeded on di> land and when the water was filled with small stone standing above the surface, would leap from stone to stone rather than go into the water in this manner I observed several pass over puddles of water, and proceed on the other side, leaping as before Other naturalists have added a good deal to our knowledge of these strange fish Hickson found them in the Celebes", and described them, as did also Woodford, who met with them in mangrove swamps in the Pacific, where, he says they are exceedingly common, hoppeR and climbing among the aerial roots, to which they cling by means of their strong pectoral fins, and jumping off into the water when anyone approaches He also found them in wells a long distance from other water, in situations to teach which they would have had to make a considerable journey overland Moboley saw them during beverage of the Challenger, and in his " Notes of a Naturalist " he tells how be chased one in Trincomalee Uni hour, which skipped along the water by a series of jumps until it reaches! a rock where it sat on a ledge in the sun, and waited till he came up, when it skipped along to another rock TROUBLE spun specimens have had,; been known, and Dr Gunther lent one to Moseley, who drew it for an illustration in his Notes," it was not t II some three years ago that living ex- samples were brought to E iropo the credit of introducing these strange lists into zoological collections is due to Dr IT Forbes, Director of the Liverpool Museum, where they have done remarkably well in shallow salt- water tanks, kept at a temperature of about 80 Fair When they came they were exceedingly timid but the. shyness soon wore off, and in a short time they learnt to recognise the attendant as he came to feed them Dr Forbes speaks of them having two modes of motion on lauded hop or sinning and a walk in the former case the pectoral fins are used simultaneously as a base whence to take off, and in the Utter alternately, when curious triple trick is left in the soft me At the meeting of the British ABSOCIUIIOU in lobb Jdiclvson pointed out that these fish, in the Celt lies, always kept the tail under water, and this led Professor A C. Haddon, during the Torres -Straits Expedition, to make some experiments, which induced him to believe that the tail does assist in inspiration, and the microscope showed that the circulation of the blood was exceptionally vigorous in Hutt organ But with these conclusions Dr Forbes 18 unable to agree The speculations which have lived in the aquarium of the Liverpool Museum have been kept under close and continuous observation, with the result that the directors, believe" that no aid eau IIB lent to desperation by the immersed portion of the tail The gill chambers of these fish are capacious, and, in his opinion it is probable that a sufficient amount of water can be retained in them to keep up respiration during the time the last one out of the water He has turned individuals, both in their natural condition and in the aquarium, and found that they would sit for more than half an hour without a bath they would then walk slowly into the water, and go below the surface for a

pectoral fins, it often appeals to work at the spectator, with one eye or both Dr Forbes has however, explained that what seems to be working is the inversion of the eye into a depression immediately beneath for the purpose of lubricating the organ when it becomes dry The climbing perch of India seems to have been well known to the ancients, for Theophrastus records the existence in that country

without difficulty Lvdekker writes of them is " having a peculiarly ghost-like appearance, reminding the beholder of monsters in a pantomime" Their w aird look caused the keeper of a large aquarium to doubt if they could be true fish, and he used to describe them as " something be tween a leal fish and a lobster " And in truth, the best free rays be to some extent similar the walk- ing limbs of x
