THE trial of the most sensational criminal of the "nineteenth century terminated at Melbourne yesterday, end th*-re can be no doubt bat that the public opinion is that, the jurymen have"' done their .duty in fisdins DEEMING guilty. The prisoner and his counsel complained of the lioatilrty of the public *>ut there would be little hope for this or any other-country in which snch a fiend conld escape H»'e l>ublichatred. Th-«t just anger of the' people w notaronsed by any aensa- ? taoiial newspaper artiel-B, but by following out »he bare hiatoiy of the life whiA th- eot-'prise of Australian journals, with marrellous rapidity, «oupht out. ' We are not concerned as to OEEMING'B career "before he first arrived ia Australia, but bis Sydn-y record is' that of &: fraudulent insolvent and convicted thief. Set'irn ipg to England; irader -on-* of his numerous aliases he committed bigamy bymaTving Miss MATHESOW apd was anbseqnently imprisoned for fraud^ntly obtaining the jewellery, which h» first preS"nt»d, and then wrested from her. cloeifg the incident by eending the di-honored girl home. Up to this time he had been content to steftl, font tired of the burden of a family he dete'mitiod to kill. 2Tey«*r was a more terrible plot to. murder more fiendishly -devised or more ac curately carried out. With a caution which does not savour of insanity, t'ie cement was purchased in Miss MATHER'S name, and in the night a wife and four children, were slain. The most wonderful feature in the case is the iron composure of Ihe man, who c«olIy interred his five victims before leaving < he honse. 1 he murd>r mid the interment most have occu pied hours ; an experience through : which but few strong tuen could come After such wholesale slaught T, the murder of a poor we&k; girl in a strange land would be bat a trifle. His overweening confi dence, however, and probably ad^rire to economise caused his downiaJL Another h«lf cask of cement and Miss Hotmnfell would probably now be reposing' under the cement floor, which, with his partiality for that material, DEEMING had laid down in his house at Southern Cross- There wonld hav«' been a- seventh vic'im added to the list of those already dis covered, and DEEMING,, under auotiier alias, wonld have been looking for another wife, which despite his 40 years his jewellery co»ld always) pro cure him, and ''another residence possessing a kitchen with the indispensable cement floor. It is not impossible that an insane man conld c>mmit the crimes which will render the name of Deehikg infamous for all. time, hut it is highly im probable that having done so he wonld be sufficiently apprehensive of the punishment to seek to evade it by lying abant his relatives and traduc ing: the memory of Iub dead mother, and murdered wif»*. Were he in sane no one wonld cry oat for his execution, bnt eo outraged ate the public that almost irrefutable evi dence on. that point would be req aired to satisfy the general indignation. Were DEEMING toescape, "every murderer on tri«l would s'mply have . to relate realists-: caily how bis mother or -grandmother in transparent costume and illnaiina ted by sreen lights ajipeaiedlo him in the small hours, andcriedfor the blood of the .person, he particularly wished to dispose «i The lion's den stray, which is an . improve ment on Scripture - for DANIEL never traded a«ay tbe harmless-lions -conld also be told with path«s, 'and morbid females in the ' front seats' could, as they did on Monday, weep for pity's sake. One great ^question wonld foe solved-by the release of eopli men as Deeiuxg : the preponderance of the female papulation. " What to do withonrgir's' need never then be asked, for one -hnsband wonld go round so often, and if the strain were too. great: on the female population, a society of ladies could be formed for the suppression of concrete floors, and the leading brands of cement conld be brought under tbe Sales of Poisons Act. However, these speculations are idle; a hard- teartedjuiy trere not movwl by Mr. Deism'seloquence,, wen not Impressed by ghost stories and green ligiifcB, disbelieved the lion's .den stoiy,; ; survived . the pathos which EO touched tbe fair occupants of the -Court, and brought in ih«» murderer guilty..

A BTOHY which, if true, is (tlie Pariscorre. spoudent of the Daily Telegraph remarks) one of-the most sensational on record, reaches Pans from the Spanish frontier. A tanner | and his wife, ' 1 ring at Peralada, near F|tnieras, bad saved up £60 in order to hire a substitute to serve in the array for their son, who had been ctiled upontojom theooloura. The parents, accompanied by their boy, set oat the other day for Oerona in cder tofind the substitute, leavingtheir daughter llolores to V-»ep house in their absence. Item while a lonal bad character, named Fouiatioli, who lived in the next borae to tbe farmer, over hear < the latter and his wife as.ther were conversing about the object of their proposed visit to Oerona. Heals? earned through hi' eavesdropping operations the . amount of money raised, and heard the farmer's wife Iodine it up in a wardrobe.

She could, however, choose Hie manner of lw death; whereupon the eid said that she preferred hanging to being butchered with the rabbet's knife, he" tnoftsens tionalparr. ofthisstorv is its climax.

Then there arrived on the ecene, *ike a true hero of romance, the lo*er of Dolores, who was accompan-ed bv a crowdof villagers and Fotdanou'a wife. The r bbel* was released f om his perilous posi tion. restored to consciousness, «nd handed over to justice. The cu tain fell as Dolores was lifted fmm the gronnd by her deliverer,: while lite robber's wife went off intj a fit of hysterics. - A correspondent of the Gardener* Ckrotiide, writing from Tuscany, where the mrtayer system is in operation, say*: " Your short paragraph on thi< subject pre sent j food for reflection.
