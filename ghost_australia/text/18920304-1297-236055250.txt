to ti1k editor ok the daily telegraph. Sir, — I'ar the information of Mr. Moggy re the " Fislier'a Ghost Story," I might state that it whs nothing more or less than the tactics adopted by an eye-witness to the derer to be iv man of wealth and position, and being afraid to ley direct information lest he be disbelieved and lie iuinself be charged with tiie crime instead, conceived the idea of playing the part of ghost, and which ulti mately led to tlio arrest and conviction of tho real murderer. It is stated that tho ghost used to proceed to a certain watorliolc and then vanish. This is a mistake. This ghost, lilto all other gliosis, never vanished, but the persons that saw it vanished. In conclusion, if Mr. Stead liad mado himself thoroughly conversant with tlio writings of Emanuel Sweedeuborg bis ghost number would have never seeu daylight, as ho would have learnt to know wliat were ghosts und what were not. Trusting tho samo kindly-given hint will nerve Mr. Meggy and others interest in ghosts as well. — -Yours, etc.. \V. FADDY. Wollongoug, Marcli 2.
