Then the friends of Mb GomiftridtcuJedthe idea, and so thepublic kept idling the money on; stall there wasalw^yspl6ntyH$Ja.y against her, jast as though she-lmdbeen boiled, until at last, if hen tto more could begot out of her, fcour setfor tbe, .nop, describe theoonstemataoft of hsrbaokeis, orthein> dignationexpresaed,bothlood*nd deep. And the stewards present immediately called for a explaiiation,whiChwasabont8B unsatisfactory a one as could be imagined. Six. Gomm, in an unwise moment, bad givenins tractions to a bookmaker natned Collins, who slso resides at Birmingham, to take six monkeys about the mare, or else he was to scratch her. This Collins did not take the six monkeys, although it is idle to suppose he could not get it, because after the ugly reports began to circulate he might have got much longer odds. That of course, however, would not have suited quite so well and the tragedy was played out, themare kept in the market almost to the last-*he was. indeed, actually on the course, read/ to run, when the pen was put through, her name. Many excuses ate to bemade for Mr. Gomm, none for his commissioner, who was walking about for more than 24 hours with the dnth warrant in his pocket, And did liot scratch the mate, as he ought to have done much earlier, if he truly found he dould not get her owner's money on. The stewards of the Jockey Club will in all probability have something to Say on the subject, andintbeir hafi'ds it may be I safely left The only extraordinary put of I the case is that the backers of Fraulem have paid, for thefitse was not P.P., and if ever there was a time ftt breaking that unholy custom which compels people to pay on even race, P.P. or not P.P^V ft had now arrived.

Th® n«n it raineth every day," has been ?Hie text upon which most of the sporting ymras hare considerably enlarged; for in fact they had little else to write about Race meetings had been abandoned, cricket T*jfke8 pnt off. The'greater part of the British Isles had been far days and weeks under water, libit of our towns and citiea, wise and Small, all exdeptLondon, had been visited with tremendous floods^ which caused great damage; and London Itself only owed us escape to the excellent drainage, for the downpour was as heavy and persistent here aa anywhere else. With sighs of relief then, the whole racing population, high tod low, nch and poor, opened their' eyes on the morning of the Monday before Goodwood, and, to their delight, beheld a cloudless sky, and heard no pelting on their window-panes. So for, indeed, as the weather was concerned, we have not had so " glorious" a Goodwood for many years. If it does not comedown on the first three days, Friday generally makes op for their deficiencies, bat this anniversary, saving a few heat drops, which fell befote ~ t^co-gociB had left their couches, we had brilliant weather all the week; the only drawback being the dust, which, in spite of all the inches of rain recorded in July-more than ever recorded before in that nuotsummer month-was as dreadful and as intolerable as eyer. The racing throughout was scarcely up to Goodwood form. There ate, in fact, too many races, and not enough added money. It would bewellif the Duke would follow the example of the Ascot authorities; he would have to puthishand in bis pocket a little deeper, perhaps, at first, bnt it is quite tb^meeting, which is said to be the best farm he has, would be much more remnnerative to him, and much more apprel ®y.the general public. For intMiwJ it is positively abettrd to have a doxen races set down for . decision on any day, ""fh mott t?16.

Kidbrooke re ?-fined to travel the long Queen's Plate, course, stopping to kick several times, thus allowing Lilian to score her 23rd.Queens ' Plate without much trouble. Horse Chesnut defeated 10 of the speediest animals in training ? for the Duke of Richmond's Plate, among them being Modena and Lady of Urrard, second and third; besides Blenheim, Vril, Oxonian, &a;, not placed. The victorious career of M. de Ftieny was continued in the Nursery Stakes. Coomassie, second in the Stewards' Cap, won the Chesterfield Cap in a common ca&ter; from Chieftain, Tartine being third 14 others also tan; and after Prophete had carried off the March Stakes, and the colt by Victorious out of Blspeth had beaten Rich mond in a match, Chieftain was {railed oat again, tKrihnig the worse for his previous ex ertions, and he beat Lady Patricia by a head ' lor the Goodwood Corinthian Plate, a dozen .then fiushing behind them. Zee bad only Pieriightto beat to be returned the winner of the Strafford Stakes. Spina way won the Nassau Stakes in a canter; and Miss Toto hwfaig won a sweepstakes we once more bade adiea to dueal Goodwood, its shady glades and fcirdless groves. The following facta connected na the meeting may be worth remembering:-Each time die Kan of Daitiey was defeated he was backed for the ' 8t> ugeii each time being a tar better 'ftvmnthiahis conqueror.

Oar French friends appear to be qnite in as flourishing a condition as we are at home in racing matters, their Grand Prize for 1877 having jost dosed with the unprecedented number of 342 entries. It is with much regret that I have to record the retirement from the turf of Mr. Merry, and the sale of the remainder of his stud, which were disposed of on Monday at T&tters;&lTs.; Itis nearly 50 years ago since the great Scotch ironmaster first won a. race, Bince which time he has carried off the Derby' twice, and almost every race that is worth winning. There' were 15 loto for disposal, of which Blantyre realised the largest prioe, 2,300guineas; the sum total amounting to 7,360 guineas, or an average of about 480 guineas each. The great cricket matches at Lord's and the Oval are how pretty nearly all-num bered with the past; ana this week at Can terbury and Worcester the whole of cricket ing England will assemble. While the racing was going on at Goodwood a good many matches were played np and down the country. At Lord's, M.C.C. gave Wilts a decided beating; on the same ground Rugby beat Marlborough in one innings, 166, with 35 runs to spare; bat the Midland School were not so fortunate when they met the M.GLC. on their own ground. Yorkshire, in a three days' match, for the benefit of J. Thewlis, at Sheffield, got the better of Gloucestershire, for whom Mr. W. G. Graoe's 111 and 43 were the only goodsoores: Green wood and Lockwood, for the Northern county, making 52 and 75 in their firet innings, and not oat either of them; 24 and 39 in their second. At Glasgow an extra, ordinary match took place between Sliding County and the West of Scotland; Che county eleven pat together 78, and the West went in and had only lost one wicket, Evans's, bowled for 10, when time waB called, Sharpe 105, and W. (Sack 83, carrying oat their bats. On Monday, at Brighton, the annual match between the jockeys and the sporting press was played, when the knights of the pigskin defeated the quilldrivers; Bob I'Anson contributing 20, and Cnstanoe 18; for the press, in the aeoond inninjp Hooper made 30^ ana Salter 2L On Monday the Canterbury weak com* menced with the match of England against Kent and Gloucestershire, splendid waaajter attracting an immense assemblage. There was good pl*y on both side, bat the counties eventually won with«x wickets to go 4own, Appended is the sootsf Att-mrauxD. fBtsrnomras. noose Drawee. Mr. A. JT. Webbe, fe c Yaidley, b W. O.
