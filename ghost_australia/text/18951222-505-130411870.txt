A EEDFERN PHANTOM. This story relates a true experience whioh I, with about a dozen lads of my own age, from 15 to 20, had of a ghost or apparition. It was in a street off Botany-road, Eedfern, called Moon-street, at the back of a butcher' o shop keofc then bv a man named Jeffries. At the back of the shop was a vacant lot of ground with a willow-tree and a water hole that made the spot very lonely at that time, as it is twenty-five years ago, We used to go there and sit under the tree every night to tell stories and keep out of the way of the police. On this night we mustered very Btrong, and were all seated very comfortably. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and while we were talking we saw a woman coming down Moon street. So we said, 'Stop talking until she gets past.' But she didn't go past us. She stopped right in front of us, and we thought she was the mother of one of tho boys ; but when we looked at her we knew that she was not. She stood there some time looking at ns, and we at her. She was dressed in a brown dress, aud had a red plaid shawl over her head. Then all at once she seemed to fly away, and we could not find out where she went. We were all dumb-struck, but after a while one of us spoke, and tbat woke us up, and we jumped up and ran like mad, and you could not get any one of ub near that willow-tree after dark again if you gave us anything. So we found a new spot for our meetings. This is a true story, and if you think it worth while to print there will be a great many men that were boys then who will remember it at once, for it must have &ade; a great impression on their minds. If I was in Sydney I could get this signed by at least a dozen names. I may add that this woman could not leave that spot without somo of us seeing whioh way Bhe wont. â€” G.A.F.S. M.
