The report said to have been made by the inspector is still more difficult to understand. How such a garbled account of the facts could have been manufactured it is hard to imagine. It is stated that the inspector traced a very bad smell to the residence of Dr. Rendle, who admitted that he had a water-closet in use, the refuse from which passed into a drain, &c.; It is true that the inspector called, and was taken over the premises by me ; he was shown some stable manure which had just been carted in for garden use, and this certainly gave off some odour, but nothing like night soil. He saw the earth closets and there was no bad smell in any of them ; he saw a cup- board where a water-closet formerly existed, but which was abolished three years ago. This cupboard now contains some chemicals, but there is no bad smell, unless perhaps the experienced nose of the inspector recognised the ghost of the long-abolished water-closet. The drains leading from this old closet were under- ground, and they also have been abolished, and an open surface drain substituted to carry off slops and storm waiter. If anything more can be done to make the premises more healthy to myself and my neighbours, I shall feel indebted to anyone who will point it out. When I entered the premises at the end of 1879, there was one water closet and one earth closet ; there were numerous underground drains in a horribly offensive condition, There was a long open wooden drain sunk level with the surface and full of filth, a large tin-lined case, sunk in the garden and boarded over, containing several loads of offensive filth, another long open wooden drain, as an over- flow', also full of filth ; there were also two large brick cesspits. Fever had existed in the house as one might expect. Occupied as I was busily in my professional duties, it took me some time to discover all these abominations, but in less than six months they were all removed and filled in. Four earth-closets are now in use and are carefully attended to. The house slops and storm waters are all carried off in open drains level with, or above, the surface, and these are frequently inspected and Hushed, so as to prevent stagnation or overflow. No fever has since occurred in the house. If anything further can be done I shall be obliged to the Board of Health, or anyone else, who will inform me of The gravity of such charges in the public Press, especially against a medical man, formerly a health officer. must be my excuse for trespassing so much on your space." -I am, sir, c, RICHARD RENDLE, Garth House, Wickham-terrace.
