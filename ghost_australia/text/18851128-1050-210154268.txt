, THE PRIEST'S: IDEAL GOOD 1 SAMARITAN. ' ' / /Y e have bad so often/obtruded on our notice . tlie coarse, . and brutal, side., of the character of the Papal clergy/ that it is a ; plphsant/'change. now and then /to listen /to tue voice oLa lewvox that, prder-.who, are .disposed to be a little more' charitable, so i'ar as the despotic rules of - their church will allow. If - these gentle' natures can not shake oft ;tlieir bonds to ' the 'dogina ; that there is rib/salvation out /of the, Church . of Rome, and therefore no., salvation, for ProtestantB.; . still they like to pay us.some ; duty/ while.- wevawait the, awful fate, and , : would, save us if they could - by teaching us and convincing us of the truth of their 'faith;// '' '/' .'- v/-.:;.-'. v ,' . ' We believe much more may be learned' of tlie true nature of" Popery/ from those iriild natures ;thari froin the more ferocious , :and blatant which are . more .common among the . craft. We suppose,1 among a thousand- we -could not- pick out a better specimen of 'tbe gentle kind than the Rev./ Mr. Gollinridge who delivered a. lecture this week in St. Bridget's Hall.Kent- street, on the duty of Australian Catholics to! their " separated brethren meaning . of course, Protestants, -v Butter wpuld.not melt in his inouih.: Contrary to every .definition of his church he went so far as: to; allege that the Protestants of the present day /'are 1 not heretics at all, hut the disinherited successors /of those who \yere." In/ fine we are all. claimed by! him because we were baptized, as belonging to . the papal, church.,. We should be treated very kindly, not boycotted, for instance;; nor beaten; nor cursed; openly at least or by laymen. W as there no one to suggest to the good priest the refrain of the good coster— ' ' If I had a tionkoy what wouldn't go Do ye think I'd wallop him.-? no, no,' uo. I'd give him some hay and I'd give Lira some grass And I'd cry clieb up, Neddie." . The poor Protestant like the ass, deserves pity, he is indeed quite as obstinate.
