POLITICAL RUMOURS. It is reported io the city that, at the next Ã‹eneral ejection, Mr. Carruthers will offer is services to the electors of Kiama, of which district he is a native, and that Mr. Bull, the present representative of Camden, will flit to St. George, for which district Mr. Carruthers is the Bitting member. Mr. Bull is quite aware that he hos not the ghost of a chance of being returned again for Camden, and that seat will be easily captured by Mr. Kidd, who was beaten at the last election by Mr. Bull by about 18 votes. If the Minister for Lands stands for Kiama, he I will be defeated by a considerable majority ; the present representative is very popular in the district, and the people will certainly not reject him in order to give his seat to Mr. Carruthers. The latter may recognise thiB fact before the dissolution of Parliament takeB place, and make up his mind to face the ' music at St. George. If he does, be will assuredly suffer tribulation, for a large number of the women in the district have conceived a strong dislike for him, and indirectly they are capable of doing him an immense amount of injury.
