By a communication in the Times of 20th August-, relating to the progress of the vine disease in Portugal, it appears that the Alto Douro district, which in 1843 produced 111,000 pipes of wine, will this year not produce 4000. Many proprietors of vine j yards, finding that their crops of grapes are already destroyed, have determined no longer to cultivate their ei states. From Cureton, moved for by Mr Obviera, M.P , it appears that the quantities of wine remaining under bond, in the United Kingdom on the 31st March, 1855, amounted to 11,180,171 gallons, of which 239,129 came from South Africa, and 1971 from other colonies ; 569,819 from France, 5 442,484 from Portugal, 3,628 803 from Spain, 29,373 from Minden a, 50,119 from Holland, 9704 from the Canary Islands, 2708 from the Azure, 256,255 from Naples and Sicily, and 432,743 gallons from other countries Although Savings Banks in the United Kingdom are designated National Security Savings Banks, it may not be generally known that, till such" time as the moneys of depositors have been transmitted to the Commissioners for the liquidation of the National Debt and by them acknowledged, the Government is in no way responsible either for the safe keeping or re- payment of deposits made at the different banks throughout the three kingdoms Up to that time all is at the depositors' own risk. Hence many senses frauds have occurred, and much distress been entailed upon parties who, by the knavery of managers of local Savings Banks, have been deprived of the hard earned accumulations of years. To remedy this unsatisfactory state of matter-, a new association has been projected, which is thus noticed in The Times of the 19th August The prospectus has been issued of the Natif n ii Tinny Association, with a capital of £10 000 loboiiiricisedto ílftO.000 The object is to create an iiiiltncndcnt savings bank, presenting security of a more tangible until a-, combined with greater freedom of nett n, than ispossUi c under the minting M of The result of the high banks on the cb suitable or pnterntlsi'tcin has been a heiress to the Government while the depositors have also suffered, fined 22 have failed for in high repute amount of £150,000.
