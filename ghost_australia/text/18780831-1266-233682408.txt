W, G. GRACE AND THE AUSTRA- LIAN TEAM " One of Them," in the Leader, writes as follows :—" In my last report I had to record bur severe defeat in one innings by the Gentlemen of England, at Prince's. I can only say respecting that contest, that if we had played at all up to form the result might have been far different. I think it ought to be mentioned that the team was not wholly composed of gentlemen cricketers, for the Messrs Grace and Gilbert received a sum of £60 for their services, . and upon an objection to the payment being raised by our manager, it was pointed out by the Messrs Prince that, W. G. and G. F. Grace with Gilbert are invariably paid for playing. It seems odd, therefore,that J amateurs. We have to thank Messrs W. G. Grace and Bush for : depriving us of Midwinter's aid during the remainder of our tour. Midwinter had entered into a verbal arrangement to play for us in every match in England, and these two persons hearing of it, and being desirous of. our non-success, came into the pavilion at Lord's about noon, on the 20th, when we commenced our important match with ; Middlesex. They had alongconversation. with Midwinter, who was in cricketing dress ready for play, and the upshot was that Midwinter left us in the lurch without a moment's notice, and 1 went away with Grace and Bush to play with Gloucester against Surrey at Kennington OvaL I don't think Grace will be the better liked for this manœuvre. As he was leaving the ground he said to one of us, " You have not the ghost of a show against . Middlesex." Doubtless the result of the match has surprised hitm. Despite Midwinter's aid too, Surrey, which we beat by five wickets,, defeated the Great Western Uounty by'16 runs. We have determined that we will not play against Gloucestershire unlesB Grace apologises for his conduct and for the language he made use of in reference to us on the occasion of his taking Midwinter away-
