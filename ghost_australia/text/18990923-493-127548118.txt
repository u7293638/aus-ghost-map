THE SECRET OF POWER. Show mo a man who has been a power 'in prayer and I will show you a man who' has given himself up to do and be what God wants him to do aud be. If you have this powor in prayer yon, too, must make this complete surrender to the will or God. You may bo praying for somo special blessing, but God cannot give it to you until you aro wholly His. And let me urge you to make this full consecration, because it ' will result in power fer service. Peter before the council said : ' And wo aro his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God had given to them that obey him.' Tho real secret of power for God is to have the Holy Ghost upon you, and in ordei'' to havo tho Holy Ghost upon you you need to yield yourself to God's wi|l, making over to him definitely, deliberately, solemnly, and forever tho entire, control of all you have and aro.
