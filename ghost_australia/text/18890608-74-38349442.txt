M1IE1ORIES. The wind s cahill to-night, While n the flickering light I sit alone within my home, and dream of days of yore ; While ghosts in lilence rise Boflro my saddened eyes. Oh memory, memory, bear me back to the days whrich are more. I eec tire wooded hill, Standing so calm and still In the warm, mellow light of autumn after. noon ; And then the narrow stream, Ietweon its banks doth dream The willows bend and listen to Its plaintive murmured tuneo. Oft in tihe days of yore, I, standirg by its chore, WYatched the long shadows falling farther, still more : While in the plimroso sky, As ganset's glories die, Is lit the first, tile fairest vening star. Now down the winding road, Come wagons with their load, With lumbhorig pace and slow, the day's work ceded; Thie weary labouror singing, His voice so cheerly ringing With softer sounds of everoning clearly blended. Theroe by the flowing stream Stand I once more, and dream. ieo all the vanished scone by mem'ry's power HIrer I tihe moorfowl eallr Then silence over all, iMaking yet awettlr that enchanted hour, Press I the loving hands Of friends in distant lands, Now scattered wide, or lying beneath the churchyard sod Le?n happy thore now left Of joys and youth bereft, Thnr thoeo who, labour ended, are resting with their God I Away I Yo ghosts that rine Before my saddened eyes I Creep heck into your graves for evermore I Your gladness all departed Makes mro but sadder hearted, Por gone beyond recall are the days I loved of yore.
