A Coiiunissiou on Gliosts and Spiritualism. The Committee appointed by the University of Pennsylvania under the will of the late Henry Seybert to investigate the so-called phenomena of modern spiritualism have come to the conclu sion that there is nothing extraordinary in any of those manifestations that is attributable to any thing more mysterious than legerdemain. The full report of the Commission, which will shortly be issued, is likely to attract a good deal of at tention. They report that the demonstration of the trickery of slate-writing is conclusive, as is that of the purely physiological origin of the rappings. It was the common experience of the Seybert Commission that " as soon as any inves tigation worthy of the namo begins all manifes tations of spiritual power cease." They told of marvellous things that the spirits did, but when it was sought to have the miracles repeated in their presence the " conditions" were " inharmo nious" and nothing took place. The Commission Bay in concluding their report : "We regret that thus far we have not been cheered in our inves tigations by the discovery of a single uovel fact ; but, undeterred by this discouragement, we trust, with your permission, to continue them with what thoroughness our future opportunities may allow, and with minds as sincerely and honestly open as heretofore to conviction."
