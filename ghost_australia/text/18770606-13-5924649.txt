THE CONNEXION OF UTOPIA WITH TODAY. A lecture on the Utopia of Sir Thomas More was delivered last evening at the Scots Church, Collins street, by Mr. Murray Smith, This was the first one of a series to be given in connexion with a, literary association formed by members of the church, under the direction of the Rev. Charles Strong Mr R Jaffray was in the chair Mr. MUK AT SMITH said it was now some what over 2,000 years since the moa- illa, trions Athenian philosopher elaborated the plan of perfect commonwealth the ruling principles of which should be wisdom courage, temperance, and justice, and it was worthy of notice, moreover, that he then declared the realisation of such a conception to be difficult indeed, but not impossible How far had we progressed since the days of Plato' Could any nation or community now declare that by such principles as those which Plata recommended their counsels were determined their conduct regulated, or did not the expectation seem almost a bitter satire ' From the sword of Harmodius to the last flaming torch of the Parisian Commune how many weapons had been brandished in the name of Liberty-' in her right hand a civic wreath in her left a human head 'and with what result? Men were not agreed as to what was the best form of government, much less the road to it Liberty, of course, was now the fashion-Cuan cial reforms in Egypt and constitutional reforms in Turkey Houses of Parliament responsible Ministers equal political rights -all the newest receipts and doctrines adopted with a faith and eagerness well proportioned to the ignorance of their recipients Whether Turkey would realise by mushroom creations of to day all those advantages which had come to England through centuries of slow growth chequered by reverses, by failures by wars and revolutions it was not difficult to determine, but reformers every where, we knew, were hopeful, and some good might come of it at last Fromanacconntwhich the lecturer then gave of Sir Thomas More he next proceeded to his well known work The main intention of the fiction, so far as the story itself went, he gathered to have been purely sportive. The theory of communal y of goods, on which the prosperity of the Utopians was assumed to rest, was not likely to have been seriously maintained by a rising politician and successful lawyer. It found favour rather with that somewhat numerous class of philanthropists who, having no goods of their own or any likelihood of getting any that were to be gained by honest labour, preferred to share the result of their neigh- board' exertion-, and in the human have to combine the indolence of the drone with the mischievousness of the wasp The in superable obstacle to all propositions for common property was that they took no account of the existence of rogues, fools, or idlers, and imagined the whole community to be imbued with such a sacred regard for the dignity of labour and self denial as might preserve them against all tempta- tion, and stimulate them to every exertion without hope of reward H. feared we must rely for the progress of the world on the commonplace virtues of energy and industry, backed by that self interest so hateful to the social philanthro-. paste who were engaged in the pleasing task of assisting everyone at the cost of everyone else The account of the Utopians was supposed to be given by a learned traveller lately returned from an expedition with Amenons Vespucci Advantage was taken by More of a pause in the narrative to point out to the traveller that he ought to apply the experience he had gained to the public affairs of the day Even in our day, would it not be desirable to bring to the national councils some of the travellers who had been, if not through distant countries at any rate through the world of books (Cheers ) Was there no place of entrance for them save through the portal opened by a turbulent contest ' A ' if the rising seal of learning in our midst few though her sons might yet be had been permitted to choose a representative might not one at any rate, of the two men amongst us of European reputation have escaped the inevitable destruction and he feared, equally inevitable deterioration, of such a vulgar strife ' (Cheers ) One of the topics debated by the fictitious traveller and his bearers was that most fertile topic of discussion, the rights and responsibilities of landowners The question had been more or less under discussion, he supposed, since the days when Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth an inalienable right to a piece of ground where he and his descendants might bury their dead or when Joseph took advantage of the necessities of the people to alter the land tenure of Egypt It needed no ghost to come from the grave or philosopher from the antipodes to tell us that property is land was not wholly as other property- that it partook of the nature not only of a right but a trust and that those who held it were therefore in same measure liable to be called to account for their trust The old feudal system was not without its virtues It laid obligations on the lord as well as on the servant and though the system was gree, the obligations still he thought, morally are married, and were, he believed, acted up to by the great majority of the landed proprietors in England, otherwise they could not have maintained their position England loved the hereditary glories of the great houses she did not forget the victories in peace or war of Stanley and Russell, of Cecil and Herbert and she welcomed to her proudest seats the worthy descendants of noble trees tors who loved the land and whom the land still loved (Cheers ) But if ever the day came in England when power and privilege became divorced from reference, when noble and squire in the mass followed the bad example of Borne among their number, then he thought there would be a short life for those things. Here too it would appear that we were on the eve of important events A large body of people themselves prosperous and happy, but persuaded by agitators (some of whom had at any rate the excuse of ignorance for their folly, whilst others were abusing their knowledge were being bounded on against a single class-the wealthy landowners of this country. Possessed of a truth they were exaggerating and distorting it into a false hood But what should he Bay of the objects of their intended attack'' they appeared he was afraid, to be incapable of understand- ing the gravity of the position, they were isolated, indifferent, untaugut It might be confidence in a just cause, but they needed something more than confidence Deeply though he deprecated the attacks made upon them tenaciously as he purposed to maintain if ever again he had the opportunity (cheers) those rights which they had acquired under the shelter of the laws he could assure them that his or far more powerful advocacy would be unavailing, unless they recognised fully and fairly the responsibilities of their somewhat invidious position, and unless they set their houses in order, and did more than they ever yet had done to redeem their class from obloquy, and therefore from that in justice which obloquy would bring in its tram. The lecturer then dealt at some length with the description which was given of the customs and institutions of the Uto plans The principle of toleration, be observed near the close of his sketch, was one that they respected. Might it not be possible to improve even upon them and extend the operation of the principle to other than religious differences ' Might it not be occasionally practicable to hold different opinions on financial or constitutional subjects, without attributing to one another every defect, physical, mental or moral, which a lively imagination could conceive or a copious vocabulary after* (Cheers ). If not how could public life be pursued much longer without the indispensable qualities of a foul tongue, a brazen face and a corrupt heart '' Fencing, not stabbing should be learnt in the political arena. Utopia, he feared, would never be made visible to mortal, and he abandoned such a hope with some regret For, thinking of the charms presented by perfect justice toleration and kindness thinking of all that might be and yet was not amongst the fairest kingdoms and nations of the world he could not but echo the concluding words of the gentle and blameless author There were many things in the common- wealth of Utopia that he rather wished than hoped to see followed in our governments, (Cheers.) The Hon. J. A. MCPHERSON proposed a vote of thanks to the lecturer, and expressed a hope that Mr. Murray Smith might take the opportunity at an early date to lecture on the duties of industry and property. The vote was carried with cheers. Mr MURRAY SMITH, in reply, said that he hoped the time was not far distant when he should have the opportunity to deal with the question in a more suitable place than a lecture room (Cheers ) A vote of thanks to the chairman closed the proceedings. A dreadful accident occurred at Inglewood on Saturday morning, which terminated fatally the following Monday morning, to a baby about eight months old, son of J. H. Harrison, builder. The mother (says the Talbot Leader) was engaged cooking at their farm, a little out of Inglewood, and having lifted a saucepan of boiling water off the fire, stood it on the hearth for a few minutes, and while her back was turned the child sat down against the saucepan and spilled the contents over its legs, severely scalding time.
