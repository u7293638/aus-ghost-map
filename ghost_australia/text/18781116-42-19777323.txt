"No." Hamish looked round. The shining clear evening looked very calm* notwithstanding the tossing ot the blue-black waves. And it seemed waateful to the old sailor to keep the yacht lying-to or aimlessly sailing thia Way and that while thie favorable wind remained to them. " I am not sure that the breese WiU last, Sir Keith." . -.. .. . ) * Are you sure of anything, H_n.-4i ?" Mac* j leod said, quite absently. " Well, there is one thing we can aU make sure of. s But I have told yoo, Hamish, I am not going up the Sound of' lona in day Ught':' why, there is not a man in all the ialanda who would not know ot our coining by to-morrow morning.

Is it Colin Laing 1" exolaimed Hamish, indignantly; " I wiU know how to. sail this yacht, and wiU know the banks, and the tides, and the rocks better than any fifteen thousands of Colin Lainga !" "And what if the Dunara is coming south ! If she cannot see us, we can Bee her." But whether it was that Colin Laing had before leaving the yacht managed to convey to Hamish some notion of the risk he was running, or whether it wss that he was merely anxious for his master's safety, it was clear that Hamish was far from satisfied. He opened and shut his " The right of rapahiiahiac "Jfar-d-tod ol Dat*** ia Qaesnaijiuul has bean jwitihisan by th* •ps-opriston. of Jm big clasp-knifeln an awkward silence.

" The Dubh-artach men would recognise the Jmpireat once," Macleod said; abruptly; and hen he suggested to Hamish that he should get i. Uttle more way on the yacht, so that she might >c a trifle steadier when Christina carried tb* (inner into the English lady's cabin. But? in* < loed there 'wis now little breese of' any kind, aamiah's fears 6f a dead calm were likely to wove true. MeanwhUe another conversation had been •oing forward in the small cabin below ;hat was; flow suffused by a strange warm ight reflected from the evening sky. Miss White was looking very well how, after her long i lea voyage. During their first few hours in blue 'rater she had been very ill indeed; aud she Repeatedly called on Christina to allow ber to ' (lie. The old Highland woman came "to the conclusion that English, ladies were rather diifdish iv their ways ; but tho only answer she made to this reiterated prayer was to make Misa White aa comfortable as was possible, and to administer such restoratives as she thought desirable.' At length, when recovery and a good appetite set in, the patient began to show a great friendship' for Christina. There was ne longer any theatrical warning of the awful fate ' In store for everybody conneotedwith tir_ enter-1 wise.

And jroii know, mem, Sir Keith has not shut you up in this cabin : you hef the saloon, if you would pletee to hef it" "Thank you, I know !" rejoined Miss White. "If I choose, my gaol may consist of two rooms instead of one. I don't appreciate that amount of liberty. I want to be set ashore." "That I hef nothing to do with, mem," Christina said humbly, proceeding with her work. Miss White, being left to think over these things, was beginning to believe that after dl her obduracy was not likely to be ef much Service te her. Would it not be wiser to- treat with the enemy : perhaps to outwit him by a show of forgiveness ? Here they were approach ing the end of the-voyage—at least, Christina aeemed to intimate as much ; snd if they were hot exactly witbin oall of friends they would surely be within rowing distance of some in habited island,' even Gometra, for example. And if only a meesage oould be sent to Castle Dare ? Lady Madeod and Janet Macleod were Women. They would not countenance thia monstrous thing. H she could only reach them, she would be safe. Tbe rose-pink died away from the long pro montories, and' wata succeeded by a sombre gray ; the glory in the west sank down; a wan twilight came over the sea and the sky ; snd a small golden star—like tho point of a needle—told where' the Dubh-artach men had Ut their beacon for the coining night- The Umpire lay and idly M-x* •** thfi" deadtelm; Madeod paced np md » .j ... I'tlV . . •A. il . : * . ,; down the deck, in tho solemn stillness ; Hamish threw a tarpaulin over the skylight of the saloon, to cover the bewil leriug light from below; and then, as tbe time went slowly by, darkness came over the land and the sea. They were' alone with tbe night, and the lapping waves, and the stars. , About 10 o'clock there was a loud rattling of qlocks and cordhge— the first puff of a coming broeze had b truck her. The meu were at their in a moment; there were a few sharp Suick ordera from Hamish ; and presently tbe Id Umpire, with her great boom away over her quarter, was running free before a light south easterly wind. ■ " Ay, Ay I" said Hamish, in sudden gladness, *| we will soon be by Ardalaniah Point with a fine wind Uke this, Sir, Keith; und if you would rather hef no lights on her—well, it is a clear night whateffer; and the Dunara Bhe will hef up her lights." 1 The wind came in bits of squalls, it is true ; but the sky overhead remained clear; and the Umpire bowled merrily along. Macleod was still on deck. They rounded the Ross of Mull; and (tot into the smoother waters of the Sound ; would any of the people in the cottages at Erraidh see this gray ghost of a vesael go gliding past over the dark water ? Behind them burned Ihe yellow eye of Dubh-artach; before them a lew Bmall red points told them of the lona cot tages ; and still this phantom gray vessel held on her way. The Umpire was nearing her last anchorage. I And still she steals onward, like a thief in the night She has passed through the Sound ; sbe is in the open sea again ; there is acalling of startled birds from over the dark bosom of tbe deep. Then far away they watch tbe lights of a Steamer : but sbe is miles from their courso ; they cannot even hear the throb of ber engines. ,' It is another sound tbey hear—a low booming aa of distant thunder. And tbat black thing sway5 way on their right—scarcely visible over the arkened waves—is that the channelled and sea bird-haunted Staffa, trembling through all her caves under the shock of tbe smooth Atlantic surge ? For all the clearness of tbe starlit sky, there is a wild booming of waters all round her •jocks; and the giant caverns answer ; and the thunder shudders out to the listening sea. j The night drags on. The Dutchman iB fast asleep in his vast Atlantic bed; the dull roar of the waves he has heard for millions of years is not likely to awake him. And Fladda and : surely this ghost gray ship that steals by is not the old Umpire that used to visit tbem in the gay summer- time, witb her red ensign 4ying, and the blue seaa all around her ? But here _is a dark object on the waters that is ¥ rowing larger and larger as one approaches it The black outline of it is becoming sharp against clear dome of stars. There is a gloom around as one gets nearer and nearer the bays and cliffs of this lonely island ; and now one hears the sound of breakers on the rocks. Hamish and his men are on the ulert. The topsail has been lowered. The heavy cable of tbe anchor Hes ready by the windlass. And then, js the Umpire glides into smooth, water, and her head is brought round to the light breeze, away iocs the anchor with a rattle that awakes a thousand echoes ; and all the startled birds among the rocks are calling through the night, -•-the sea-pyots screaming shrilly, the curlews littering their warnfagnota, the herons croaking is ttar.wing; their slow flight away across the sea. The Umpire has got to her anchorage at last • < ) AUd aoaroely was the ancho^ down when they brought him a meesage from the English lady. She waa in the saloon, and wished to see him. Jle would scarcely believe this ; for it was now past midnight; and she had never oome into the saloon before. But he went down through the forecastle; and through his own state-room ; 4nd opened the door of tbe saloon. j For a aecond the strong light almost blinded' him ; but at all evonts he knew she waa sitting ihere; and that she was regarding him with no fierce indignation at all, but with quite a friendly ; " Gertrude," said he, in wondor ; but he did not approach her. He stood before her as one •who was submissive. "So we have got to land at last!" said she : and more and more ke wondered to hear tbe friendliness of her voice. Could it be true then? Or Was it only one of those visions that had of late been torturing his brain 1 -• Oh, yes, Gerty !" said he. "We have got to an anchorage." " 1 thought I would sit up for it," said she. " Christina said we should get to land some time to- night; and I thought I would like to see you. because you know, Keith, you have used me very badly. And won't you sit down ?" He accepted tbat invitation. Could it be true f could it be true ? This wad ringing in lis- ears. He heard her only in a bewildered way1. " And I want you to tell me what you mean to do with me," said sbe, frankly and graciously; * I am at your mercy, Keith." ' "Ob, not that—not that," said ho ; and be added, sadly enough, "it is I who have been at your mercy since ever I saw you, Gerty ; and it is for' you to say what is to become of you and of me. And haVe you got over your anger now ? —and will you think of all that made me do this, and try to forgive it for the sake of my love lor yoa, Gerty ? It there any chance of tbat now?' ' ; She rather avoided the earnest gaze that was bent on her. She did not notice how nervously his hand gripped the edge of tbe table near him. "Well, it is a good deal to forgive, Keith ; you wiil acknowledge tbat yourself ; and, though you uaed to think that 1 was ready to sacrifice every thing for fame, I did not expect you would make me a nine-days' wonder in tbis way. I suppose the whole thing is in the p .pen now ?" " Oh, no, Gerty ; I sent a message to your father." *' Well, that was kind of you. And audacious. Were you not afraid of bis overtaking you ? The Umpire is not tbe swiftest of Bailors you used to say ; and you know there are telegraphs and railways to all the ports." " He did not know you were in the Umpire, Gerty. But of course, if he were very anxious about you, he would write or come to Dare. I ahould not be surprised if he were there now." A quiok look of surprise and gladness Bprang to her face. " Papa—at Castle Daro 1" she exclaimed. " And Christina Bays it is not far from here. " Not many milea away." " Tben, of course, they will know we are here in the morning !" she cried, in tbe indiscretion of sudden joy. "And they will come out fur me." " Ob, no, Gerty, they will not come out for you. No hutran being but those on board knows that wo are here. Do you think they oould Bee you from Dare ? And there is no one living now on tbe island. We are alone in the sea." The Ught died away from her face ; but she said, cheerfully enough— " WeU, lam at your mercy then, Keith. Let us take it that way. Now you must teU me what part in the comedy you mean me to play; for the life of me I can't make it out" " Oh, Gerty, Gerty, do not speak Uke that 1" he exclaimed. "Tou are breaking my heart Ib there none of the old love left 1 Is it all a matter for jesting ?" She saw sbe had been incautious. " WeU," Baid Bhe, gently, " I was wrong ; I know it is more serious than that; and I am not indisposed to forgive you, if you treat me fairly. I know you have great earnestness of nature ; and—and you were very fond of me ; and although you have risked a great deal in what you have done, still, men who are very deeply in love don't think muoh about con* sequences. And if I were to forgive you, and moke friends again, what then ?" " And if we were as we used to be," said he with a grave wistfulness in his face, " do you not think I would gladly take you ashore, Gerty ?" "AndtoCaßtleDare?" " Ob, yes, to Castle Dare t Would not my mother and Janet be glad to welcome you !" " And papa may be tbere ?" " If he iB not there, can we not telegraph for him? Why, Gerty, surely you would not be married anywhere but in the Highlands f" At the mention of marriage she blanched somewhat; but she had nerved heraelf to play this part "Then, Keith," said she gallantly, "I will make you a promise. Take me to Castle Dare to- morrow, and the moment I am within ita doors I wUI shake hands with you and forgive iou, and we will be friends again as in the old ays." "We were more than friends, Gerty," Mud he, in a low voice. " Let us be friends first, and then who knows what may not foUowt" said sbe, brightly. "You cannot expect me to be over-profuse in affection juat after being shut up like this 1" " Gerty," said he, ahd he looked at her with those strangely tired eyes, and there was a grea^ gentleness in his voice, " do you know where you are ? You are close te the island that I told you of—where 1 wish to have my grave on the cliff. But, instead of a grave, would it not be a fine thing to have a marriage here ? ! No, do not be alarmed, Gerty ! it is only witb. your own good will; and surely your heart will consent at last! Would not that be a strange^redding, too; with the minister from Salen; and. your father on board ; and the people from Dare ? Oh, you wonld see such a number of boats come out that day, and we would go proudly back; and do yon not think there would be a great rejoicing that day ? Then all our troubles would be, at an end, Gerty ! There would be no mot* fear ; and the theatres would never see you again; and the long happy life we should lead, we two together 1 And do you know the first thing I wonld get you, Gerty ?—it would be a new yacht! I would go to the Clyde and have it built all for you. I would not have you go out again in this yacht, for you would then remember the days in which I was cruel to you ; but in a new yacht you would not remember that auy more ; and do you not think we would have many a pleasant long summer day on the deck of her, and only our selves, Gerty ? And you would sing the songs I first heard you sing, and I think the sailors would imagine they hoard the singing of the mermaid of Colonsay, for there is no one can sing as you can sing, Gerty. I think it was that first took away my heart from me." " But we can talk about all these things when I am on shore again," she said, coldly. " You cannot expect me to be very favorably disposed so long as I am shut up here." " But then," he said, "if you were on shore you might go away again from me, Gerty ! The people would got at your ear again ; tbey would whisper things to you ; you would think about the theatres again. I have saved you, sweet heart ; can I let you go back ?" The words were spoken with an eager affection and yearning ; but they sank into her mind with a dull and cold conviction that there was no escape for ber through sny way of artifice. "Am I to undentand, then," ahe said, " that you mean to keep me a prisoner here until I marry you ?" " Why do you speak like that, Gerty ?" " I dem md an anawer to my question." " I have risked everything to save you ; can I let you go back ?" A sudden flash of desperate anger—even of hatred—was in her eyes ; ncr fine piece of acting had been of no avail. "WeU, let the farce end!" she said, with frowning eyebrows. " Before I came on board this yacht I had some pity for you. I thought you were at least a man, and had a man's generosity. Now 1 find you a coward and a tyrant " "Gerty!" " Oh, do not think you have frightened me with your stories of the revenge of your miserable chiefs, and their savage slave-. Not a bit of it! Do with me what you like; I would not marry you if you gave me a hundred yachts !' " Gerty !" The anguish of his face was growing wild with despair. " I say, let the farce end ! I had pity for you —yes I had f Now—l hate you 1" He fcpmng up with a quick cry, as of one shot through tbe heart. He regarded her, in a be wUdered manner, for one brief eecond; and then he gently said," Good-night, Gerty ! God for* give you 1" and he staggered backwards, and got out of the saloon, leaving her alone. See f the night is still fine. AU around this soUtary bay there is a waU of rock, pet black against the clear dark sky with its myriad twink ling stars. The new moon has arisen; but it sheds but Uttle radiance yet down there in the south. There is a sharper gleam from one lam bent planet—a thin Une of golden-yeUow light that comes all the way across from the black rocks until it breaks in flashes among the ripples close to the side of the yacht SUence once more reigns around ; only from time to time one hears the croak of a heron from the dusky shore. What can keep thia man up so late on deck ? There is nothing to look at but the great bows of the yacht black against the pale gray aea; and the taU span and the rigging going away up into the starUt sky ; and the suffused glow from the skylight touching a yeUow-gray on the main boom. There is no need for tbe anchor-watch that Hamish was insisting on. The equinoctials are not likely to begin on such a night as this. He is looking across tbe lapping gray water to the jet black Une of cliff. And there are certain words haunting him. He cannot forget them. He cannot put them away. Wherefore ia light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul ? . . . Whioh long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave. * * * * * * Then in the stillness of the night he heard a breathing. He went forward and found that Hamish had secreted himself behind the wind- lass. He uttered some exclamation in the Gaelic ; and the old man rose and stood guiltily before him. "Have I not told you to go below before ; and will I have to throw you down into the forecastle ?" The old man stood irresolute for a moment Then he said, alao in his native tongue:— "You ahould not speak like that to me, Sir Keith: I have known you many a year." Macleod caught Hannah's hand. "I beg your pardon, Hamish. You do not know. It is a sore heart I have thia night" " Oh, God help us! Do I not know that!" be exclaimed, in a broken voioe; and Macleod, aa he turned away, oould hear the old man crying bitterly in the dark. What else could Hamish do now—for him who had been to bim as the son of his old sge !" "Go below now, Hamish," «dd Macleod in a gentle voice; and the old man slowly and reluc tantly obeyed. Bnt the night had not drawn to day when Macleod again went forward and said, in a atrange excited whisper— " Hamish, Hamish, are you awake now f Instantly the old man appeared: he had not turned into his berth at aIL "Hamish, Hamish, do you hear the sound?" Macleod aaid, in the aame wild way, "do yon not hear the sound V "What sound, Sir Keith r* ssid he—for indeed then was nothing but the lapping of the water along the aide of the yacht and a murmur of ripples along the shore. "Do you not bear it, Hamish ? It is a sound as of a brass band I—a braes band playing musio —as if it waa in a theatre. Can you not hear it Hamish I" "Oh, Qod help ua! Qod help ual" Hamish cried. "You do not hear it. Hamish?" he said " Ah, It is some mistake. I beg your pardon for call* ing you, Hamish; now you will go below sgsin." * Oh, no, Sir Keith," said Hamish. " WUI I not stay on deck now tiU the morning ? It ia a fine sleep I have had. Ob, yes, I hsd a fine sleep. And how is one to know when the equinoctials may not come on 1" " I wish you to go below, Hamish." And now this sound that is ringing in his ears Is no longer of the brass band that he had heard in the theatre. It is quite different It has aU the ghastly mirth of that song thst Norman Ogilvie uaed to sing in the old half-forgotten days. What is that he hears ? King Death was a rare old fellow, He ut* where no sun oould shin* ; And he lifted hi* hand so yellow, And poured out hi* coal-black wine I Hurrah I hurrah I hurrah I for the coal-black wine I It is a strange mirth. It might almost make a man laugh. For do we not laugh gently when we bury a young chUd, and put the flowerejover it; and know that it is at peace ? The child hss no more pain at the heart Oh, Norman OgUvie, are you stiU singing the wUd song ; snd are you laughing now ?—or is it the old man Hamish that is crying in the dark I • » • • • There came to him many a maiden, Whose eyes had forgot to shine ; Aad widows with grief o'erladen, For a draught of his sleepy win*. Hurrah! hurrah I hurrah I for the coal-black win* I It ia auch a fine thing to sleep—when one has been fretting aU the night, and spasms of fire go through the brain! OgUvie, Ogilvie, do you remember the laughing Duchess : do you think ahe would laugh over one's grave ? Or put her foot on it, and atand relentless, with anger in her eves! That is a aad thing ; but after it is over there is sleep. All oame to tha ran old fellow Who laughed till his eyes dropped brine, As hs gave them his hand so yellow, And pledged them in Death's black wine"! Hurrah I hurrah I hurrah I for the ooal-black wine I Hannah I—Hamish ! —will you not keep her away from me ! I have told Donald what pibroch he wiU play ; I want to be at peace now. But tbe brass band—the brass band—l can hear the blare of the trumpets ; and Ulva wiU know that we are here, and the Gometra men, and the sea birds too, that I used to love. But she has kiUed all tbat now, and she sta_ds on my grave. She wiU laugh; for she was light-hearted; like a young child. But you, Hamish, you will find the quiet grave for me ; and Donald will play the pibroch for me that I told him of ; and you wiU say no word to her of aU that is over snd gone. • • c c • See—he sleeps. This haggard-faced man is stretched on the deck : and the pale dawn, arising in the east, looks at bim; and does not revive him, but makes him whiter still. You might almost think he was dead. But tiamish knows better than tbat; for the old man comes stealthUy forward ; and he has a great tartan plaid in his hands ; and very gently indeed he puts it over his young master. And there are tears running down Hannah's faoe; and he says, " The brave lad ! The brave lad I" (to be contixued.)
