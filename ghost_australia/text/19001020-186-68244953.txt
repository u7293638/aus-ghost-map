JUXSTRIOL'S GHOSTS OF THE TEMPLE. And what ghosts there might be flitting about these dim and shadowy walks at night, or promenading with stalely mien amidst the fading flowers -. brave shades in silken hose and buckled shoes, and ample wigs or ~ ties,'* in liats aud fathers with which thev sweep the ground in salutation of petticoats that rustic the walks in rare brocades â€” petticoats whose lovely owners add to the whispering of the Temple leaves, faint ripples of feminine laughter! Oh. 'yes. ladies visited the Temple, and some of them lived there as a few hedvcM-liorn danies do to this day. And there were stately lords, wise coun cillors, and judges in ermine, and Princes of the blood roval, a picturesque band of gallant men and lovely ladies 1 It would bV hard to think thej- do not now and then revisit the glimpses of the- raoon. The last time 1 left a little party of i^edate revellers in the Temple I could be sworn I had brushed shoulders with more than one ghostly tenant : might have been Sheridan who was entered at the Middle Teaiple a few days before his marriage with Miss liufey, though he paid but flitting visits there ; or might have been Tom Moore, a quite recent shade compared with nioft z for one might go back even to Chaucer were it not too cur ious a speculation.
