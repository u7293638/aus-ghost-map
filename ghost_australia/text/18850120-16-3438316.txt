MR. DALLEY ON THE NEW GUINEA QUESTION. 'stallion W li Dalley, acting Premier of New South Wales, addressing a meeting at Maitland, misreported by the S M Herald of last Tuesday to have said - You have perhaps heard recently-T think, with astonishment-Unit we are all supposed to be suddenly implied with a great distrust of the Imperial Government and that we me he ginning to engage in calculations concerning the value of the Imperial connection his libel alike upon our loyalty and our common sense has been pretty freely circulated It is due to the reputation of the country that it should be repudiated promptly, energetically', and effectually I do not believe that, cou evening the matters out of which this imputation has arisen, there is any strong feeling in this country whatever I feel perfectly eel team that any man who presumed on ii public bust ings to assert that any conduct upon the part of the Imperial Government had ever shaken our allegiance to the Empire would simply be covered with lingerie (Cheers ) I do not mean to assert that many of us may not be able to appreciate and regret a certain hesitation and timidity in dealing with colonial questions which does not augment our personal admiration for individual statesmen of the mother country (cheers) but not one of us has any stronger feeling than regrets this want of boldness, or would favour any stronger measure than a firmly worded remon str men against it if it prove to be dangerous to our best interests (Hear, hear ) We may feed that we have not been treated with that candour and confidence and consideration which we is 1 a right to expect , but we know v the difficulties as well as the weakness of import Lil statesmen, and we should not, and we will not, be too precipitate in dealing with them in what we conceive to be their shortcomings (after, hour) With these preliminary v observations I shall say something of the difficulties with which this Government has lately had to deal for a short time As you are aw mc, we have been under a cloud of suspicion as if we were incapable of appreciating the value of questions of national sign in "ance, or went up and to associate ourselves with those whose capacity was higher and whist courage more undoubted Bor a few w week, and until the course of events had fully vindicated our JHO crime, we were supposed to be more careful of the case of Ministers of England than of them tortoises thepeopleoftliiscolony How we could be so suddenly affected with this sacrifice of colonial to Imperial interests, nobody thought of explaining It never uc uri ed to any one of our critics to know why we should prefer the approval of noblemen and gentlemen in England, whom we had never seen, to the satisfaction of those by whose favour our political expense was alone continue 1 I think I shall show you, gentlemen if it is necessary to show you, the conduct of the Government of this country in this matter was regulated by two considerations, both equally import it and equally obligatory upon us One, what was best to be done in the interests of this colony, and the other, w line was due to the great Jjnipiie from which we have sprung (litar, hear ) We can discharge no public duty in this colony which will be of lasting value to it if in its discharge wo weaken the prestige of that great Empire from which we have derived all that we prize and cherish, and by which we are protected in the position we occupy before the world (Cheers) I shall, with your permission pass from our domestic to our foreign policy, for, strange to say, we are now enriched soil embarrassed with a great foreign policy You are aware that no sooner did we escape from our perils and sufferings of Parliament than we were exposed to fresh acts of a more serious character than peisomiicatcs of Absolutism in European statesmanship The Prince von Bismarck took upon himself to annex a portion of the Island of New Guinea which no one had over claimed, which lay outside the British protectorate lately established, and which, from the very circumstance that we had abst unod from including it within our limits., he may have imagined we did not intend at ven i tune to arise.

My own belief is, the people of England are coin paratively indifferent whether the islands are annexed 01 not by England to a certain portion of the community any accession of territory by England is a subject of triumphant cry Such persons, however, often overlook the responsibility which such acquisition of territory brings with it-J responsibility for thought administration of the islands themselves, and a responsibility to the other European nations who will not 'stand idle by When we have laid violent hands upon the islands with which they have also been cultivating mci castile or tilling relations It is be cause 1 stc, 01 believe I it, some of these difficulties and iCdpont>ibilitieg to it I do not enter upon the matter with the same impulsive spirit which you have brought to bear upon it, and thus it is that I seem to you to be cool, hesitating, or indifferent I am strongly impressed with the idea that a pro ttttoiato by England over New Guinea, beat all events, over its southern toast, and a joint protectorate by England and J i into over the New Hebrides and other gi mug of islands, would be the best and most pi allowable solution of the question I believe that it would he more, advantageous for us I mean for the whole of the Atistt allan colonies if the assurance were clear that no other nation would annex the islands than that we should '-c adds to responsibility and expense of annexation and, most covet, I feel perfectly sure that, whatever may he the feeling of 1 France with regard to New Guinea (probably she would not care much about it she would not allow us to annex the New Hebrides without a strong protest and struggle I do not undo it all the trade with those islands Personally I have been as much concerned in it as any man in the colonies, but in the event of war they would be at her son eyes of weakness than of strength, having such a number of places to protect and defend Nor do I see where the annexation is to end at the New Hebrides Then how about the Sr be more Group, the Santa Cm,!
