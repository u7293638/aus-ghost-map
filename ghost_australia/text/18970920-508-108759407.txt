COJiSfJMPTITES' M03IE FILND congest; There is no lack of activity en the part of those who are organising entertainments on behalf of the Queen Victoria Consumptives' Home Fund, anJ^ie many previous efforts may account for the scanty attendance at the Y.M.C.A. Hall on Saturday evening. The araniatic and. musical recital givea by SSr. Parker Lewis and Miss Winifred S'ratton, K.A.M. (Mrs. Eobb) was worthy of a larger audience, for the organisers in their reepeciive parts as reciter, pianist, and con tralto were thoroughly satisfactory. An ex cellent inter tretation of Beethoven's ?' Moonlight Sonata' was given by Miss WiniiredSirutton.who ! : subsequently played 'The Black Knight' (O'Leary) with, good effect. 'Mr. Parker Lewie interwove the musical portion of the programme^ with Dickens's 'Christmas Carol,' his selec tions, ' Mra-iey's Ghost,' ' Pezziwig's Ball,' 'Bo 3 Crachet's Christmas Dinner,' 'At Scrooge's Nephew's,' ' Poor Tihy 1'im,' and ' Scrooge Keclaiaied by Christmas,' requiring considerable y-iriety in treatment and gesture, were competently given, a-jd met with appre ciative response from the aud;ence. Miss btrat ton's flexible contralto was heard to advantage in Cowan's ' Gift of K'.'St,' and, in response to an encore, gave 'The Hum of tlie Bees.' Miss Stnttton al-s . sang ' Will He Come ' (tiullivau), and ar^am yielded to the demands for an encore.
