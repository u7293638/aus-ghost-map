I did DOt know that bis intellecfrWas so unclouded, nor;'that he had recognised me tfll that niurtimt. But I bad no difficulty in answerin" it. I answered briefly but solemnly. "f'do. Ipity thofce who doam it." Foe the more I became acquainted with the disoovefies & thafsci^nce which had made eucb 1 rapid stride# in my time, the more certainly had I become donvmeed -of the reality of perejmial existence. The man showed no pleasure. He had no memories " benienantl^ luminous," as Carljrle calls theiB^ "to tise froni the darkness of his life, no wishes for a future. 'But tie rallied gallantly uTa fresh tremendous effort to express himself, aJid then it became evident to me that a new voicfc jbora of love, wasspeabihg fdrthefirsttimeinMB desolate life.-'- -" ' It went against me to forbid'bhn to expresr himself, although it became' my imperative duty to enforce silenoe contrary to my own wishes. His character had always been a Btrong one though it had repulsed me, and I coutd nirt but be'afraid that every effort he waslmakin^ was consuming so much of the necessary oil of life. I had no occasion to pride myself cn the self-restraint which I had exersisedin only allowing myself to answer, hu one question of supreme importance. Evety o*her medical man would have done the came in scch a case. And yet, when the orning was far advanced, and I kept my atient more calm tinder the influence of a arcotic, I could not help a slight regret that T had felt it to be necessary to stop a probable onfession. That in his hour of utmost need the u retched man had been willing and even esirous to confide in me, and that such an pportunity might not again occur, was borne T n upon me with some vexation as I'went to y daily work. ' As I returned 'on ioot to nfiy wn breakfast, and drove in my carriageto isit my other .patients, a sort .of oppression eemed to weigh upon me, as I thought of the iserable man dreading to venture into the arkness alone, with! no one to hold out a elping hand to him, and "none to shed a tear over bis grave. It haunted me to remember ow his bleared and sunken eyes had rested ith an expression of despair on the familiar objects in the room. I thought how wilingly lie wonld : have been a boy again. And et life was so shirt—" tone hour for a buttery," twenty yearsfor the' average ! man—but ho could tell after all what was short or what was long? The visible work of the last thousands of years had fcefen quickly enough done from a geologist's point of view, and' it comforted me to fancy that for some of the Creator's ignorant children it might take hundreds of years at least before they conldbe perfectly taught the right. It Was not m~ way to give up hope about anyet I Was stamgely : depi that day i sri as T drove past the liK little Church, ana | thought©! God's Acre near it, and the neglected corner which we had -chosen for Mysie'B tomb. People were already beginning tb talk -of sew and better methods of disposing of their , dead, -and I confess it seemfed to me that the Church to which we resorted to pajr ftctt *>f ioyous worship would be better -separated from the Churchyard, with - itBSolemn ^ggestlon 6f the questions, When<»lwe6omeftimWMther-we go.
