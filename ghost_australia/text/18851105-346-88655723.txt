There are only five fillies loft in tho Oaks, viz., Uralla, Lady Claudia, Buttresj, Parody, and Violet. There was an excellent attendance, and some good racing at the Elstornwick Park course thia afternoon, but tho heat, dust, rain and mud were some drawbacks to the perfect happiness of those who went. The horse, Douglas, was killed whilst running the Steoplechase. The following are the results :-Tho Bayswater Cup (for trotters) - Julius CiB3ar, 1 ; the others distanced. Hurdle Race-The Chief, 1; Vernet, 2; Distiller, 3. November Handicap-William Tell; 1; Ocista, 2; Pyrette, 3. Steeplechase-Irishman, 1 ; Union Jack, 2; Pride, 3. Selling Flat Race-Primus, 1; Woodbine, 2 ; Hopaless, 3. Eltornwick Park Handicap-Irralee, 1; Stationer, 2; Umbarto, 3. Perhaps there were horsos in the Melbourne Cup which carried a good deal more public money than Sheet Anchor, yet ho was well backed both by his owner and the public. It was stated that Mr Loughlin, who was very favorably impressed with the chance of Ilia horse, has netted £20,000, and that as the books are apt to be leas liberal whan dealing with people who are not greenhorns it required some strategy in order to get the money on. MANDEUS' SPORTING TELEGRAMS. (From Albert S. Handera, telegraphic agent). ELSTERNWICK PARK RACKS. Wednesday, 4th November. The interval between the Cup and Oaks day was well spent to-day. Tho weather was hot and sultry, and notwithstanding tho counter attrac tions of the pigeon match at Brighten, the atten dance at this fast rising suburban course was never so large. Tho trot for tho Bayswater Cup, run in heats, was won by Mr W. Branch's Julius Cieaar, after going very unsteadily in tho first event. In the final heat a dust storm cau3ed Lieutenant to shy, and throw the driver out of the machine, therefore Mr Branch's horse came in alone, after which Colonel Morgan presented the plato on behalf of Mr Miller. In tho Hurdlo Race Mistake made most of the running, with Vernot aud Diatiller in close prox imity. Coming into tho turn for home The Chief, who was judiciously ridden b/ his owner, came away and won somewhat easily from Vernet, Dia tiller having to put up with third position. The November Handicap was looked on as a good thing for Vision, but William Tell at the finish came away easily. Honora carried the stable money for Mr Whittingham, but she liad to give way to her companion, Ocista, for second honora. All tho jockeys in thia race were fined for dis obedience at tho post. The Steeplechase lay botween two, Irishman and Uuion jack, the former winuing after a hard ridden race. Kulkyne ran oil when going well. Douglas fell heavily, and broke his back. He was destroyed. Fred Hill, who was riding Taud sti^kor, met with a nasty fall. We think he was blaineable for riding after his late nccident. Only throe started for tho Selling Race, for which Primus was served up a hot favorite, and won easily. He was sold to Mr E. Weeks for £115. The last race was a good thing for Irralleo, who waited until they came to tho finish, CRICKET. The Golden-square Juniors and West End met for the cup match in the Reserve yesterday. The latter went in first and made 74, out of which Trevarro.v made 23, Graham 15, and Brewer 12. The Juniors then went in and ran up 44, Jamei making 22 not out, and Frost 15. The West End in their second innings made 30, Graham and Trevarrow contributing 7 each. Golden-square started their second inninga, and when time was called one wicket was down for 3 runs. For tho West Eutl, Brewer aud Luckhurst bowledj splen didly; and for the Juniors, James and Murdeu did great mischief to the West End. Tho JuDiors requiring 54 runs to equal the spore of the West End, will resume their innings on Wednesday next. The match between the Excelsior and Capulets resulted in a victory for the Excelsior by 13 runs, scores being Excelsior (G3), Capulots (50), highest scorors for the winners being M'Veigh (19), Southby (15), M'CaHum (13); and for the losers Brown (14) aud Stokes (14).
