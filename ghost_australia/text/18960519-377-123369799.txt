Punctually at 4 eedlock the Bishop entered: the church by the northern doorway, he being preceded by the Rees,. A. R. Bartlett, A. Davids, and H. E. Whittington, who walked in the orn der in which theirnames appear. As the qause tette of clergymen proseeded up the northern' aisle the congregation rose in a body to their, feet, and remained stsmaing forsome moments. An added interest was. imparted to the service which followed, by the singing of several of the members of St. Paul's (Parch choir, who occu pied the front seats. 11Be D. Russell, assistant. organist at St. John's Pas?atlhedral, Brisbane, preaided at the organ... At the conclusion of the preliminary part of 'the service, the Bishop dedUiraed the church, spalkiag in earnest tones thns?-"I hereby declie this All Saints' Church, of Bundanba, toblanow dedicated and s?t apart for the public worship of God, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the HI olyGhost, Amen." All ptreant having joined in singing the well-known hymn, "The (lueeb's One Foundation,!' the evening service of the Anglican Church eas then held, after which ThMhBenor delivered ansranestaddress. He said that in congratulatingthem upon the good .work which they had met together that day to see consummated, let themagand a few moments in thinking upon the characteristics of worship, and. take as a basis the words.of St Paul to be bound in 1st Corinthians xis,. 15-" What is it ;then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will ,pqy with the understandingalso; I will sing with, the spirit, and I will sing: with-the under staeding also." What ledi St.Paul to utter those words? At the time there was a con 'trvemr going on in the Corinthian Church as tothe relative value of certain.things. Some bhad a, gif of tongues ands some a gift of pme hecy. The former did not mean a gift of aguistiepower, but rather the essential power of true: ecstatic language, and of giving expreasias to spiritualised feelings. And the giltof prophecy did not meansthe faretelling of future events, but rather thegift oi exposition. ISt..Rh(was called upon to decide the relative me.its qi these two things.. He said, "I will prog. with the spirit, and I wilLpray with the unelsatmdi_ g also," which, referred to the gifk trophsecy. The wholemsanshould assist ods tal4e part in the worship,,ot (Gol-not the spiariuit part alone, but the whole man. Let ithaem meditate on the order in which St. Paul place4 these things. He didinot say, "I will pray with the understanding, and with the spirit as well," but he stated-lit in the reverse wany, sad rtlsv -'. Wl. per with the ... i , hat was the 6i ak. v prayer. The spirit was thedorce,.the impulse, the enthusiasm, the emotiong;ihUlst the under stinding was the mould, which gave forrs, sblope, and direction to the prayer. So the apostle's judgment was thitk the whole man psrat take part in the worshipot God. There most be force and understanding to prevent be force running to waste.. Observe how this principle acted in connectionrwith the Reforms tion. In the days of .the UBbmanEmpire the Latin tongue was spoken thnoughout the world, andsf course worship was tbencondicted in that tongab. But at last the passer of the Empire was taken, and the home otihe Casars became the home of the barbarians,, and by degrees thcse who spoke the tongued theformer began to speak the tongue of theJ.htter, and in time Latin was no longer spoken. as the common langasge. So that the fatsemof the Reforms. tion agreed that henceforth the people should worship God in the mothe.-tosnge of the coun try in which they lived. Sa, they prayed with the spirit and the understanding also. They would see what an entirely.gosernitg principle that was which the apsteio ed. Tlheeame principle was noticeable in the matter of united prayer as against extempere payer. When they met together in ordbe that they might pray with the spirit andlanderstanding, there must be preconcerted action aR to the prayers in which they were to engage. Thus they would see how helpful to,.cmmon worship were the forms which they had. in the Litany. Their prayers engaged not only the spiritual force of the man, but his intellectual forces also. The whole man's intelligenea, his strength of judg ment, and power of will,,ought to be enlisted in the worship of God. Let them go from God's house with their hearts raised to Him, with their will bent upon, I?s service, and praise Him not only with their lips, but with thek lives also. Subsequent to the service a number of then visitors accepted an. invitation to partake a. afternoon tea at Mr. James Stafford's residence. ?Trn. IiLDI NO.
