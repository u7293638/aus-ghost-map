CYCLING. CYCLING GOSSIP. by ixion. The Melbourno club held their twelfth annual meeting last Tuesday evening. The committee's report was presented to each member in printed form, and showed the great progress the club had made during the past year ; the club during that period handed over £700 worth of trophies to successful competitors at their race meetings. Tho treasurer's report showed that no less than £1593 10s. 7d. had been paid by the club. Tho election of offico bearers for the ensuing year resulted as follows : — Patron, his Excellency the Earl of Hopetonn; president, Mr. Justice Wil liams ; vice-president, Messrs. Burston, Gregg, Kernot, Head; captain, S. A. Bucknall; vice- captain, H. Kerr; treasurer, S. A. Bucknall; lion, see., G. S. Gcddes; committee, Messrs. Thome, Hall, Schwaebscli. Tho balloon tyres appear to have made a stir in this oity, and have been subject to & largo amount of commont. From the trials I have given them over our bad roads I must say, as far as comfort and case is concerned, they totally eclipse all other tyres. But for wear, I am afraid they will prove a failure. The repairing of spokes and the tyros one or two agents here say is an easy matter and inexpensive, but I think when they really come to tacklo a crippled machine they will find it more difficult than to talk. In England, according to the last mail, tho agents find it necessary to send men to Dublin where tho tyres nro manufactured in order to take lessons in fitting now valvo tubes, repairing punctures and replacing spokes, so that riders of those inflated tyres will not need to send them to Dublin should any go wrong. From the reports we have had of these balloon tyres upon the racing path, especially rough tracks, there canbe no doubt as to the tyres being much superior to tho hard ones. In many races, they have been barred and sometimes suffer penalty of 50 yards back in a mile. But when it comes to a good traok the hard tyres generally find their way to the front. Mr. Geo. Spicer has presented to the union tho record of all handicaps framed by him since November, 1863 to May, 1890. He has handi capped 93 events. 38 given by the Melbourne club, 19 by Fcrnside, 8 by Victory, 5 by Geelong, 4 by Victorian Cyclists' Union and 19 by Friendly Societies.

The times for all tho distances are not yet- to hand. Kerr, winning tho Five Miles Championship of Australia, has given cyclists here rather a surprise. For scarcely anyone thought that the honor would be won by New South Wales, as their ridors were considered to be seoond class men, and against two such riders as Davis and Lewis, it was thought Now South Wales had not a ghost of a show. I am told that the track was a regular mud pond, and as the times show it must havo been bad. Both Lewis and Davis wero compelled to dismount boforo they completed tho distanco.
