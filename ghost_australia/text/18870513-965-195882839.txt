poetry The Shield. Oh t did yon hear a voice oi death I And did you not maik the paly form Whioh rode on the silver mist of the heath, And sang a ghostly dirge in the storm ? Was it a muling bird of the gloom, Which shrieks on the house of woe all night? Or a shivering fiend that flew to a tomb, To howl and to feed till the glance of light ? 'Twas not the death bird's cry from the wood, Nor shivering fiend that hong in the blast; 'Twas the shads of Helderic—man of blood— It screams for the guilt of days that are past! See how the red, red lightning strays, . And scares the gliding ghost of the heath I Nov on the leafless yew it plays. Where hangs the shield of the son of death! That shield is bloshing with murderous stainB; Long has it hang from the oold yew's spray; It is blown by storms and washed by rains, Bnt neither can take the blood away. \ Oft by that yew, on the blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon's light; While the damp boughs creak, and the swinging shield . Sings to the raving spirit of night!
