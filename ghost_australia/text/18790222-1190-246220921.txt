HELLER ON THE SECOND SIGHT AND OTHEE TRICKS. Speaking recently with a reporter of the Washington Post, Heller said ; " The second sight mystery is a pure trick, nothing but a trick, yet deftly interwoven with tho marvels of science. Strange and peculiar as it is, how ever it is only the a; b, c of what I am pre pared to do and can do in the same line of business. You need not bo startled, but I can resurrect the dead. lean produce on the stage the spirit form of Napoleon, Wellington, Washington, Clay, Calhoun, Webster, your father and mother, or any friend who has passed into the realms of shades, and you shall see them move and hear them talk. I dare not do in public — knowing how excitable Borne in every audience are — what I can do with the aid of science." "The Spiritualists might really believe you." " The tricks of tho spiritual medium are positively vulgar in comparison, and believe me, they are all tricks. There is no such thing as a real ghost. Those I can produce are only descriptions, have only one figure and a thousand disguises, ready at the instant wanted."
