. Tke Haymarfcet. Another grand change of -programme was effected at this more than ever pepular music hall on Monday evening. There was again a large audience present. The first part, which | consisted of minstrelsy, was received with great 1 applause, especially the oddities of Alf. Moyn ham and Johnny Cowan. George Gardner's song, '? Any Ornaments,' created immense fun, while Johnny Collins and Eugene Faust were equally as funny with their comic songs and jokes. Bella and Willie Perman rendered a neat song and dance entitled ' Eosie's Sunday Out.' ' The Mystic Shadows ' concluded the first part. Gardner and Mornham were exceedingly funny in their plantation pastimes. It may here be mentioned that Alf. Moynbam. who has been long and well 'known in this quarter, is to be the recipient of a benefit on Friday evening next. Johnny Collins received an encore for his song, ' Have you seen me Uncle.' Little Daisy' rendered a male impersonation in good style, and sang ** The Dude.' The clever Permaiis appeared in their triple slab clog dance, and were very loudly applauded. Cowan and Hagan caused much laughter in an absurdity entitled ' The Ghosts in the Woods.' The silent fun manufacturers, Ted and Eugene Faust, again succeeded in their musical acts. Harry Carroll rendered a double-voiced song, and the whole con cluded with the very funny farce, ' Where's Fedora ?' ____________________ At the .Bury St. Edmunds Assizes, before the Lord Chief Justice of England, a case was heard in which damages were claimed by a commercial traveller, named Flanagan, against Mr. Hulme, governor of the Ipswich Gaol, for having forced -i?rn to take a bath and wear prison clotiies.
