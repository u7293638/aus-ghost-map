SPORTING. An Oxley correspondent sends the follow ing ' A'beer drinking contest between two district residents took place on tho evening of January tho 2nd iust., which resulted in an oasy win for No. 1, who beat his opponent by annxing j / pints witniu z\j minutes wiuiouc leaving the bar,' his opponent drinking 14 pints, and going well. The; defeated man claims sympathy on account of having drunk 5 pints a few miuutes previous to the match. Oxley \- still keeps up a. reputation which it earned in its earliest infancy What may be termed an unprecedented performance on a racecourse, is reported in connection with the Mitta Mitta Races on Boxing Day (writes the Albury Border Post), when Walter Douglas rode the winning horse iu all six events. The winners wpre : — Han* dicap Hurdle Race, Monarch ; Maiden Plate, Glenord ; Welter Handicap, Monarch ; Mitta Mitta Handicap, Gleuord ; Handicap Selling Race, Friendless ; Flying Handicap, Monarch. It tiill .be. remembered that Walter Douglas rodo Glenloth in all his engagements at the last annual meeting of the Hay Jockey Club| his obituary notice boiug published shortly afterwards. The above would make it appear as though he were still very much alive. But possibly.tbe above feat has really been accom* : plislied by Walter's ghost, the extremely light weight carried by the winners being the real explanation of their success, Rating men being unable to get out of town on Saturday, an ' off1' day was arranged, which resulted as follows t— Farewell Handicap, one ii mile— Mazurka, 7s 1 6lb, I ; Sundown, 7st 71b, 2; Mistletoe, Oat, 3.

A correspondent Beads us bu account of an affair which he states took place on New Year's evn in a small district town, which, if accurato, reveals a deliberate and successful attempt to obtain money by fal»o pretences. It appears that a rmii, a foreigner, was inveigled into bucking a notorious character of the town to box another m'in for tho sum of £25. the money being duly staked. Tho man backed by the foreigner beers a high reputa tion a? a fighting mau, and tbe foreigner waa assured that he had tho best of good things on iti backing him. Unfortunately, howover, the two boxers before aud after the fight woro the firmest of good friends, ana tbe contost as a consequent was of the mildest description. Eventually the man backed by tho out«ido&» was knocked out by 'a crushing blow which hit the air two feet to the left of tho knocked out one's ear,' a termination of such an ab. surdly ridiculous character that it could not iail to tell br.th tbe audienco and the unso* phisticated backer that they had been most completely 'had.' If the circumstances are as detailed tbey must be well known to tho I -cal police authorities, and it is quite possible thab sufficient evidence might be gathered to warrant tbe indictment of tho two principals on h charge of conspiracy to defraud. The hurdle horso Mosurka was disposed of by raffle on Saturday last, and won by Messrs B. Germley and W. Johnstone. Truly a groat 1 bargain for a modest quid. On account of Topsail having injured his leg whilst running in the Gunbar Hurdles, the son of Homer has boen turned out for a spell. On New Yoar's Day, at Fiemington, Charlie Lewis again demonstrated his skill ns a horse | man by winnins the Normanby Stakes on The woywuu UMU ^nwu.iivu wumoo uu xueuuiuio. Lewis also, had mounts on Tho Spot and Leona, who ran uapiacod. A Melbourne sporting writer says -Tbat well-knowu cricketer, W. O'Hmloo, ie in Melbourne on a visit from Hav, and looks in the bf»t of health. '* Felix,' of tbe Aus ? tralaman, snys tbat O'Hanlon keeps wicket as well as over, and his batting is oven better than of old. Tho Sunrise stock were greatly in evidence at the Wagga mooting, and those who havo a few good damos should avail themselves of the services of Mr Devlin's horse, whose pro* genyaroall galloppers. Merry Pipes will in future bo trained by Dan Burrows. Several cuto racing men were making eager inquiries ahout Mr Tyaon's Midday at race time with a view to purchase, but no tempta i tiou in onv monetary shapo or form would in* [ duce Mr Tyson to part with the sou of Satirise. I One of tho candidates in the Hurdle Race I at the late Hay meeting look our fancy greatly. The horse we allude to is Mr Weir's Ontario. The grey son of Teddington jumped faultlessly, and wej expect to hear of him winning a good race over tbo big sticks in the metropolis before long. Ontario is modelled for a steeplechaser, and has a rare dash of pace, which these class of horses as a rule generally lack. ?' Bilt ' Gormly, who is earning a reputation as a trainer, has Mazurka and Beau Monde in bin care. Tbe latter, with Bait's polish on, will soon repay her now owner for his outlay. Jessie left by train this morning for Mel bourne. If the mare keeps well she will bo worth an inve%tment in the WiUiamstown Anniversary Handicap. Mr Walter Tyson's string, including Ulti mate, Simon, and Piety, left by train this morning for Cootamundca in charge of Larry Holmes. The trio will be prepared on that course for the forthcoming local meetiog. By the same train Merri Merri took her doparture for Young.
