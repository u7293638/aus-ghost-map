It has transpired that the deceased engine-driver, James Griffith. was a brother of the famous old Surrey cricketer, George Griffith, or, as ie was popularly known, "Ben Griffith, the lion bitter." He visited the colonies in 1861-62 as one of H. H. !Stephenson's eleven-the first to visit Australia. The eleven played twelve matches in all, and Griffith played in each. He made the best average during the tour--namely, 21 15, and his aggregate was 372. For several years old Ben assisted to fightthe battles of his country on the Kennington Oval and other famous cripket-fields. He was one of the redoubtable Surrey eleven which, in the year 1863 or 1864, was not defeated in any instance, and which thrashed a picked All England eleven with nine wickets to spare. Habitu6s of the Oval, even as near as ten or twelve years ago, will remember what a grand hitter and very fair bowler was this popular left-handed cricketer. His benefit match was one of the most successful ever played on the Oval.-Courier. A telegram from Sydney in Friday's Telegraph says :-News has been received that the screw steamer Madjus, from Sunderland, via Suez Canal. Sourabaya, Torres Straits, and Mackay. foundered on the coast, on the 6th instant. All hands were saved and arrived at 'Port Stephens, whence they proceeded yesterday to Newcastle. The steamer left Mackay on Tlhursday and her arrival here was hourly expected when the news of her fate reached town. The lMadjus was coinmnnanded by Captain T. Brewis, and set out from Sundcrdand from Port Jackson, on April 30. She was compelled to put into Sourabaya for repairs, having sustained damage in a heavy gale to the westward of tihe Haby Island. Tile vessel. as far as is at present known, was in ballast. Tie Madjus was from the shipnilding yard of Kish, Bould, and Co., Sunderland, and was launched on March 27 of tihe present year. Sie was an iron, twin screw steamer. and was built to the order of Mr. Thos. Kish, of Sunderland. She was especially designed and constructed for river service, being of an exceedingly light draught of water. The Madjus belongs to the samne line as the Bortonius now trading on this coast, and was to run in con junction with that vessel. She was insured in England.
