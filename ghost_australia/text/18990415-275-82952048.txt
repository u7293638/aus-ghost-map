THE LAST BITES IN FIJI, ? o ? â€” When, in former days, a man died in Fiji, great precautions were taken both to ensure Iub safe conduct to the land of shadows and to prevent his return to tho inconvenience of the surviving rela tives. Every man, great or small, when placed in tho grave, had a whale's tooth put in his hand, the same which in life he had hung around hi& neck as an amu let, or had used as part of a ponderous necklace composed of thio marine ivory. On tho vond to Hades, such is the Fi jian belief, there stands a tree, at which the spirit, as it approaches, throws the tooth. If the tree is struck, well and good, the ghost is sure that his life has been sufficiently meritorious to ensure ! him a comfortable seat in the courts of the hereafter: if the tree is missed, it \n certain that the reception awaiting him is likely to be more exciting than agreeable. Many spirits which miss the tree turn back on their journey and revisit their former habitations, but, fortunately, the majority are fair marks men, and pass on. , Early yesterday morning, Mrs. Hope, her daughter, Mrs. Evans, and her Eon i;i-law, who occupied a house in North Shore, Sydney,' awoke and found tho staircase- a raara of flames. -They, jumped out of a window on to the roof cif an outhouse, which collapsed, ana Mrs. Hope and Mrs. Evans were injured. Tho house was destroyed.
