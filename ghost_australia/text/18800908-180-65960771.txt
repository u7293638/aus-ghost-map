PEPPER'S GHOST. In our advertising columns the advertise- ment appears relative to the appearance of the Pepper's Ghost Illusion. We are informed by those who have seen the exhibition, both at home and in the other colonies, that it is a wonderful combination of fact and fiction, the shadows in many cases appearing like real life. We under- stand Mr. M. N. Griffiths was for a considerable time connected with Professor Pepper both in Melbourne and Sydney, and therefore, we suppose, is well posted up in all the mysteries of shadow life, and from all we have heard, we anticipate a treat for the public in witnessing these— in Western Australia— new and startling entertainments. The appearance of Miss Evelyn Eldred will, we are sure, be welcomed by the music-loving portion of the community, and as her reportoire of songs will comprise the ballads, pure and simple, of England, Ireland, and Scotland, together with the "Lays of other Lands," and also a selection of classical music, we feel there will be nothing wanting to make up an evening's enjoyment.
