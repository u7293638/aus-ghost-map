AMATEUR PERFORMANCES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. Sir-Dr not the Government of Tasmania pay their officials sufficiently well to enable them to maintain themselves respectably? Tanqueray has suggested itself to my mind on reading a play bill, announcing a theatrical performance at the Theatre Royal this evening by amateurs, the majority of whom I recognise as holding clerkships in the public offices. I look in vain for any statement of the object for which the performance is given, and I am left i to assume that the profits, if any, will be appropriated by the soi-disant gentlemen amateurs. Performances of the kind have been a frequent of late, and whether the projectors know it or not, are becoming a scandal to the service. I think three have come off within a month for the benefit of these impecunious officials. Such continual study for theatrical representation must disorganise men's minds for ordinary office duty, and argues that the work of the departments in which those amateurs are engaged, must either be neglected, or so light as to render their further service unders sary. Perhaps, if the hon, the Treasurer, who professes to be strict in his economy, wool J look into the matter, he could consolidate offices a little, and send some of these ardent young Roscius' to a more congenial occupation. I trust that compassion for the memory of the immortal Shakespeare will influence the public on this occasioned prevent them from countenancing a proceeding which is dishonourable to the civil service. Amntonrperformances occasionally, for the benefit of public charities, are all very well, but they are not a means by which Government officials should supplement their salaries, I am, yours, Â£10.
