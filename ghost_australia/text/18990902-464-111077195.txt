FORM OF CONSECRATION TO THE SACRED HEART. Most sweet Jesus, Redeemer of the human race, look down upon us humbly prostrate before Thine altar. We are Thine, and Thine we would ever be ; nevertheless, that we may be more surely united with Thee, behold here to-day, we, each and every one of us freely consecrate ourselves to Thy Sacredl Heart. Many, alas, have never known Thee ; manjr too, despise Thy precepts and have rejected Thee. Have mercy on' them all, most merciful Jesus, and Hrnw Mmm' tn Thv Sacred Heart. Be Thou Kine. O Lord, not only of the faithful who have never forsaken Thee, but also of the prodigal children who. have turned their backs upon Thee : grant that they may quickly return to their Father's house lest they die'of misery and hunger. Be Thou lung of those who have been beguiled by error or whose affections have been turned aside from Thee, and call them, back to the haven of truth and the unity of the- faith, so that soon there may be but one fold under one Shepherd. Be Thou King also of all those who still sit in the ancient superstition of Paganism, and refuse not Thou to deliver them out of darkness into, the light and kingdom of God. Grant, O Lord, to Thy Church assurance of freedom and safety from harm ; give peace and order to all nations, and make the earth resound from end to end with this cry : Praise to the Divine Heart that wrought our salva tion ; to It be glory and honour for ever. Amen. Litany of the Sacked Heakt of Jesus.
