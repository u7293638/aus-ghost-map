THE PROTESTANT WARNING. Ye Orangemen of Melbourne, who fondly dreamed the laws Were strong enough at least to clip the Papist rubble's claws, No longer on the broken reed of Government rely, But " put your trust in God, my Boys, and keep a your powder dry !" 'Sharp ground be every sabre which hangs against your wall, Well furnished every loyal house, with powder and with ball I For of these Ribbon braggarts, naught so soon the courage chills, As a dose of good steel lozenges, when followed by lead pills. Alas! for England's honor, when our Rulers prove so weak, As to be to Rebel smiters, compelled to turn the cheek ; But they've truckled to them long enough, and now must surely know, The laws' arm is not strong enough tis we must strike the blow. We'll do it, though we will not ask their help or their advice. In " Ninety-eight" our fathers' task required no striking twice Whose swords upheld the British Throne, and taught the Rebel South Submission's bloody lesson from out the cannon's mouth. Shame fall the lukewarm Protestant, who tamely stands and sees A Romish mob, unchecked, work out their Church's vile decrees And of the coward Magistrates, dishonored he the graves, Who basely fled before the threats, of such Priest ridden slaves ! Then closer draw the Mystic Ties, which all our souls white, While still our Flag unconquered flies, as in Boyne Water's fight; It triumphed then-hut should it ever victorious cease to fly, We will not fear its fate to share, or 'neath its shade to die !
