SUPERNATURAL IN F LO UN QU, E (London Daily Telegraph, January 5.) Two curious incidents of recent occurrence in Russia are very dainty calculated to strengthen that deep-seated belief in the direct inter- are so of six ernatural ra finances with the ordinary course of human affairs which still holds its own with the vast majority of mankind, in spite of scientific discovery, popularised educative and all the other modern forces so strenuously exert d to promote human enlightenment The first of the incidents in question-h th of which are avowedly regarded as miraculous by the inhabitants of the cities in which they happened- took place a few days ago In St Petersburg. It is alleged that a priest of the < Orthodox Greek Church, carrying with him the Holy Sacrament, called upon a young officer residing in the Russian capital, to whom he stated that had come for the purpose of admirers 'enner extreme unction to him at the urgent request of an elderly lady who had visited him the priest at his house a short time previously. he officer observed that he had entrusted no one with any such mission , the lady, whomsoever she might he, had assuredly not been sent by him " Besides," be added smiling ' I am in the enjoyment of excellent health and am by no means preparing for death " Glancing round the room as he was about to take his leave, the ' pope" espied the portrait of a lady handing to the wall " that," he said pointing to the picture, is an exact likeness of the person who came to my house and instructed me to bring the Holy Sacrament hither " " Impossible," exclaimed the officer, for that is the portrait of my mother, who has been dead for some years" florist, ho a ever reiterated his st items to the effect that, beyond a doubt, the original of the portrait had called upon him. So deep was the impression produced upon the mind of the youthful officer by this startling and inexplicable assurance that he forthwith partook of the Sacrament A few hours later he suddenly expired. If the tale, as it has reached us, has been truly told it must be admitted that history has an indisputable tendency not only to a peat itself but to repeat fiction for if we remember right the central incident has already been made use of-and perhaps more than once in tales of imaginative mystery Of course every link in its chain of indisputable events may have reference to something real, the outcome of purely natural causes the only wonder of the whole matter by ing in the fortuitous coincidence of several such realities. Ihovoung man may have been afflicted with some dangerous organic disease, to which he himself attached no importance, while some of his near relatives may have suspected or even been aware of its formid- able character Let us suppose that one of those ay a maternal aunt, bearing a strong resemblance to his deceased parent, her Histor-fearing that he might be carried off by his mortal malady without having received the last ministrations of the church, to the eternal prejudice of his spiritual welfare, should have betaken herself to the priest, on her own responsibility, as to nervous, fanatical woman might well do, and should have implored that reverend person to administer extreme unction to her nephew w without loss of time. The subsequent incidents of the narrative, to wit, the fancied recognition of the portrait and the sudden death of a highly impressionable von h, accelerated by an agony of amaze Front and superstitious horror, would be comprehensible enough without as above their occurrence to any miraculous intervention or other preternatural agency On the sending of the priest with " the essentials " may have been a cruel practical joke pin) ed upon a notoriously superstitious and sensitive lad by his brother officers, and the ghastly jest may have frightened him into committing suicide With regard to the other strange story, which came from Y line, the 'cessation" of Russian I Lithuania, the catastrophe that constitutes its chief served me), with almost equal probability, be at habitable to coin dance or to crime value is an ex- treme!) ancient city in which Catholicism at one time the predominant creed of its inhabitants has for some centuries flourished side by side with so-called orthodoxy It possesses six oral pieces of Roman Catholic worship, among them a church of world-wide renown in which there is a gorgeous and much-vonerated Bhnuo dedicated to the holy Virgin of Czestochowa To the chapel containing: this supreme attraction many thousands of pilgrims annually repair and a superstition prevails among its innumerable vi taries, do ming to a sudden and tragical end any impious person who should seek to destroy or remove the sacred shrine It would ap-? ear that Alexis, the Russian Orthodox Bishop of Vilna, un- daunted by this popular belief recently persuaded the Imperial Government at St. Petersburg to authorise the closure of three of the Russian Catholic chun has-beens ing to Vilna, and furthermore to decree the removal of the image of " Our Lady of Czestochowa,' so that no more Catholic pilgrimages might henceforth take pi tee within the limits of his di close This does u having, in due course, been t officially communicated to Monsignor Audience the Roman Catholic Bishop of Vilna, his Grand mr hurried off to the capital in order to petition that the order might be rescinded While he was absent on this pious mission with little hope of bringing it to a successful issue, his fellow i rotate, the Orthodox Alexv, dropped down dead one day stricken with apoplexy, it is said in the Vilna railway station Not unnaturally) the sudden death of a beret cal priest who had been at matching malloch " to their sacred shrine, was regarded by the Catholics of "> line as a retributive visitation and a fulfilment of doom " As a mater of fact it savors of local excitement of so serious and significant a character that the " powers that be," despite their severe orthodoxy and each wil in nt ss to persecute the Roman Church, 'benefit fit to posts in the removal of the shrine lost that inoppor tune measure should lead to cal famous disturbance Very likely Bish p Alexv died by the visitation of God," and would have don a so his time berne i come to pay the great debt of nature if he had refrained from meddling; with the Holy Virgin of Czestochowa. On the other hand it is by no means impossible that he may have poisoned by some unscrupulous fanatic, burning with indignation at the stupid and brutal outrage inflicted upon the hallowed object of his or her adoration Religions hatreds run high in such semi barbarous countries as Russia, and too often prompt unreasoning enthusiasts t > perpetrated atrocious deeds in vindication of the sanctity of their pet idols " Do evil that good may come of it " is an axiom that recommends it off to the imporfoctly-doveloped into silence of many superstitious people, who foolishly believe that, in fulfilling, some antique predictions they are the chosen instruments of Divine will that the belief in ghosts and in all manner of spir fund manifests iona " which could only take place if a reversal of natural law were admissible, should be still entertained in our " enrich 'ened age " is a lamentable proof of human weakness and credulity The gigantic progress of science, the wide dissemination of philosophy, the rapid development. of education, have of late years striven stanchly to uproot it but in vain At the present moment, in the most civilised countries of Europe, the number of people convinced or even influenced by scientific induction and deduction, compared to that swayed by superstition is as one to a thousand Science appeals to into agent judgment, superstition to imagination Science proves nor disproves by logical proof of boys based on dear matra tion, superstition comes reason and cling to faith, being gifted with that capacity for irrational belief which science utterly lacks 1 physiologists invited to account for spectral apparitions, pronounce them to be the offspring of indigestion insanity, optical peculiarities, or liver c plant, and define them crisply as ' mortal illusions generated by bodily derangement " Many imaginative persons in time to recognise the " disembodied spirit" as a missing link between the material world, of which they know very little, and the immaterial we rid, of which they know nothing. Only a few months ago two gentlemen who-I crag joint secretaries to the Society for Psychical Research ought to have known all that there was to be known about chests, differed from one mother in cv orr essential respects far on their views of The to typical spot tro vi ere concerned One of them expressed his conviction that a g loss was " a dead man walking in his sleep a definition which, berne absolutely unintelligible was suggestive of much assiduous thought and interesting speculation The other eminent "Psychical Researchers " p ace on record his absolute certainty that a spectral apparent in was a subjective phen honor, called into being by the influence, conscious or unconscious, of one living intellect upon anora r " This were very alarming theory , but fortunately for nervous and impressionable people it was a thing more The wraith who called of the priest in St I Petersburg may have been a " dead woman walking in her sleep " white Webop Alexy may have been done to death by " the influence of one living intellect upon another " Both these contingencies appear to us i equally improbable, but who shall decide when adepts in Psychical Research disagree I
