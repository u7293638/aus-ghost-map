Sometimes ic requires greafc coolness and self-possession to remember this, but the effort to do so iB worth making, for it may save life or reason. A striking illustration of this was the tragic experience of a Dutch painter, named Penteman, who lived in the ISfch century. Ponteman had a commission which required the portrayal of skeletons, death's-heads, and other objects intended to inspire contempt for the fri volities and vainties of the time. In order to have models before him he painted his picture in an anatomical museum. One day he bad been sketching the ghasty objects which surrounded him when he fell.asleep. Suddenly he waa awakened by an extraordinary noise. He was horrified to see all the dead-heads nodding and grimacing, and the skeletons dancing, about, and waving their fleshless arms madly ia the air. Penteman fied from the frightful scene, and escaped into the street. He waa picked up uncon scious and half dead with fright. As soon aa he was rational, it was explained to him. that there had been an earthquake, and that had caused the commoticu among the anatomical spedl niens, but the shock had been too severe, he died ill a few daya. . -
