ANGLING. Preserving the Saltwater River. TO THE EDITOB OF THE ATTSTEALASIAX. Sir,-In one of his letters your correspon dent " Pike " threw out a suggestion which I think might be turned to good account, viz., preserving a portion of the Salwater Biver for anglers. I don't think there can be two opinions on the subject; but the question is, how is it to be done? I am told that each side of the river for a certain distance from the punt is private property, and that the society could easily obtain permission to preserve the water on certain conditions. Then another question arises. Is the .river public property under the supervision of Government, or doeB it belong to those whose land it flows through, subject to certain reserva tions ? I am afraid that in this democratic country the proposition to preserve public water, or rather what has been so long re* garded in that light, might raise a howl of dis content, and that the Anglers* Society, though acting for public good, would get into bad odour through its patriotic intentions. Is it "Pike's" idea to have a close season, to give the water a rest, say from June to the end of October every year. If so, a permanent watcher would be necessary, armed with the legal authority to arrest poachers, and I fear his billet would be no sinecure. Netting, if carried on now to any ex tent, could, of course, easily be prevented by haying the water properly staked; that, how ever, would be rather an expensive proceeding, and I imagine a heavy tar on the. slender re-. sources of the society. No doubt there would be considerable opposition to the proceeding on the part of that numerous section of the puttie who frequent the river nearlyall the year round, and consider it, as they do uni versal suffrage, "their inalienable right** to fish there.;' The verythonght of being prevented from anglM^ift their fftTourite .w^^jnight raise up enemies to the society in every direction. For |f lie society ti^tains permis sion to preaerveihe water, tlienght of fishing will, I presume, be eitended only to members of the societyatoertain season*, and that is tantamount to excluding a great part of the angling public, by whom that very portion of the river wotted by the society would be ImmediatAy Bingied out^ either; from epifyor as moetlikely to afford the best aporti 'lam, however, <juiieof " Pike's" wayof thinking, Uufe^inethiigehotildbedones andalthauga some people do say that the river is full of fish, It iams^qtteertimt three matches should take ^lace ^ith anch poor xesnlta, JTow.ifja mile or two pf jthe water were properly pre iwred'ttr'a' Mr jeani We' ehoiiul softn Tmow deeired effect, forifflsh mn thta&kenlheifer; and not Jba; tip ttripwr .er?ed portion, itwpuld show tbat.tkp bffiih wo mw ppwplain of ttdue. w flsMngjaiid fishing 'iSuT" though.
