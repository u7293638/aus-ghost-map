TO THE EDITOR OP THX COCRIKR. Bid, —A correspondent of yours ityilng himself " Credo" bad the temerity to criticise Mr David Blslr'i lecture on BpirlUim, to which Mr Bliir has replied, I perceive, io the cnlnmni of one of your evening contemporaries. I think that for refinement of abuse Mr BIslr'e reply surprise! everything. He makes no attempt at arguing the question, bnt launches out at the unhappy " Cred:" to a manner which is both amnstng sod Instruc tive. It Is a pity Mr B islr cannDt argue, b-einie very many people would like to hear ibis eubj:cl ventilated, sol there is no doubt that his lec-nre requires a little explanation, particularly when taken in enr-jnetian with his other lecture on ' A Flea for Ghosts," as pointed ont by "Ztr" In tbe columns of a contemporary. Aod as for vxpecLlog private gentlemen to meet bim pub licly, be most know that tbey don't care ah- at that aort of thlog, Let Mr Blair argne it oat, and If be throws no atooea UDoe shall bethrovn. In tbe meantime he labors under the suspicion of beiDg Inconsistent and illogical — of believing In ghosts, and not In spirits. — Yours, &e.;, Pax irr Bxixa
