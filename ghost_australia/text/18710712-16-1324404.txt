MB. PBIA'G'S MEETING. MR PRING addressed the electors of North Brisbane at the School of Arts last night. There was a large attendance, and Mr J Petrie presided, and after a few preliminary remarks he introduced the speaker Mr Penno, who was received with cheers, said he had invited his constituents to meet him on that occasion under rather extraordinary circumstances He felt that in consequence of it being likely that there tiouldbouooppo-ition raised to his return as a representative of the city he could address the meeting upon many topics which would interest them very much and not in defence of his own conduct as their representative It was indeed a pleasure to think that for once after so many contested elections through which he had struggled, he should be put in the proud position of being enabled to address his constituents nure y on the present political position of the colony without having any fear of opposition, or having to retaliate or question the political opinion of any gentleman who might oppose him Now it could not be denied that the present political position of the colony was a very serious question, and although he could not hope to occupy the attention of the meeting with so much effect as his friend Mr Lilley had done on a previous occasion, under great political excitement, still he trusted that he would be able to offer a few observations which might in duce them to think not only that he was worthy to represent them but also to awaken them to that interest which every individual in the colony ought to feel in reference to the present state of affairs (Hear, hear) He could not conceal from. himself, and he had no wish to conceal from his constituents, that in the present car is t to prosperity or otherwise of Queensland was deeply concerned. The contest would undoubtedly be a severe one and great efforts were being made on both sides to secure the victory, and of the party which he representcd was not now victorious he believed the effect would be to retard the progress of the colony for a very long pc lod So far as his own political conduct us u up t entative of the city is as concerned he had little to say YY him he was first returned as a member for the city he advocated a policy of progress and reform in he had always continued to advocate that policy, believing, it to be beneficial not only for the interests of his constituents but also for the interests of the whole colony (Hear hear ) in the first session of the late 1 area ment he advocated the same principles, and although there was not then an organised Opposition so to say still a sufficient amount of pressure was brought to bear on the Government to enable them to see what would be likely to occur and what in fact did occur in the session of 1871 the great defeat which in his opinion the Government sustained its on the tariff question The Opposition then beat the Government on every point and the Customs Duties Act was a nasty the Act of the Opposition He maintained that after suffering that defeat it was the duty of the Government to have rescued (Hear, hear.) It was at this time that they sought to impose that most obnoxious tax the ft duty on flour, and when there were defeated and a deficiency of £15 000 ttu»thircbv muted in the estimated revenue the} instead of seek ing to provide for it by some other means in effect gave up the ghost and told the House to supply it themselves, in fact The Colonial Treasurer sat down in a till, and as much as said you may make it up tour selves, I ntl) have no more to do with it The Opposition acted very fairly on that occasion, for sooner than see the Government placed in an awkward position and business suspended, they absolutely assisted them to make up the £10 000 or the greater portion of it, by increasing the ad latere t duties, although such a course it is contrary to I 80 him (Mr Pring s) views At all events, the Go- a" th eminent got out of the difficulty by the assistance of the Opposition, and therefore, at that period of their political career, they were da cidedly weak But when they came to meet Parliament in 1871, it was clear to his mind, although he had not an opportunity of taking part in the debate in reply to the opening Speech, that the two great questions which the Government then propounded to the country were electoral reform and additional representation Now, had they carried out what they then proposed to do, in its integrity ? He maintained they had not, but having ascertained that they had a majority, if only a majority of one, they sought to use their power for a particular purpose, and that purpose was neither more nor less than to secure to themselves class legislation (Applause) Now, he believed it would be conceded by everyone who understood what ought to be the political prospects of a young colony, or of any colony, in respect to the question of electoral reform taken in connection with a representative form of Government, such as was given here under the Constitution Act, that the people and not a class, should rule the country (Hear, hear ) If the representation of the people was honestly and properly carried out, it must be done by legislative action of a peculiar character No doubt the colony, as it existed some years ago, became from force of circumstances, subject to the control of a day, and it would be very difficult to say when that class had not predominated or when it would be possible to prevent it from exercising g great influence in the political affairs of the colony It represented a great and perhaps the only interest at one time, but as times progressed, and as population increased, the necessity for another kind of legislation arose, and it appeared only reasonable to suppose that any Government which desired to benefit the country would concede to the people all the rights and privileges to which they were entitled under the Constitution Act But what did they find Instead of the people being properly represented, or their wishes respected, quite a contrary idea seemed to possess the present Government, and he might say, after much consideration that he believed that under the regime of the party now in power the colony was going back or was being taken back, to the old days of squatting rule In fact, if the proposed legislation of the present Government was carried out, he fully believed that the colony would soon be in a were position than it was in previous to separation, and he would explain why When Separation was granted. Mr. Herbert became the first Colonial Secretary, and he was disposed to be a reformer, but whether he was disposed to conform to the extent which was then required, and which was now more than ever necessary he (Mr Pring) could not say But, at all events he was more disposed to be a reformer than any man in the present Government (Hear, hear ) The next Government which might be said to represent the pastoral interest was the Mackenzie Government, of which he (Mr Pring.) was Attorney- General Mr Palmer was then Colonial secretary, but he did not then advance such ideas or propositions as he now propounded to the people of Queensland He believed that Sir B Mackenzie would never agree to such legislation as was proposed by the he d of the present Government He believed his ideas were more expansive, and although his interests and sympathies might lean towards the pastoral tenant, still he (Mr Pring) was of opinion that he would have been a reformer to a certain extent, and that his Colonial Secretary would have gone with him if the Government had not been upset At any rate he was certain that he would never agree with the policy lately pursued by the Government (Hear hear-) But the population of the colony had since increased, and of course it was palpable to any Government that it was need sary that there should be a real tribution of electorates in order that the voice of the people should have its due and proper effect in the legislation of the colony But of course there were two ways of doing a thing right and a wrong way, and it was clear that if the people were to rule the country they should be fairly represented, and any representation which favored a class was not a representation of the people (Cheers) The y* hole question resolved itself into whether the people were fairly represented or not (Hear, hear ) The present Colonial Secretary know years ago as well as he (Mr Pring) did, that this great question would have to be determined before long, and when a member of the Mackenzie Government, he (Mr Palmer) proposed an Additional Members Bill, which was drafted This bill was prepared under the idea that the Legislative As- enable as then constituted, was not numerically sufficient to decide upon a redistribution of electorates, and it proposed to add eight or ten new members, and at the same time there was an intention on the part of the Government to secure gi its strength to its own party by means of this measure The Mackenzie Ministry failed, but he considered wrongfully, because in the first place, he believed that when a gentleman accepted an office of trust, such as Premier of the colony, he had no right to throw up the appointment and plunge the country into difficulties, unless under very extraordinary circumstances, and in the second, he ought not to place his c jue agues in a false position Sir K E Mackenzie was the best Treasurer the colony ever had, but he was a timorous weak man totally unfitted to hold the office of Premier Being defeated by the casting vote of the Speaker on the address in reply to the Governor's speEch although one of the Cox comment supporters was absent, he resigned The result was that a court on Mini try, a tin in which he never hoped to see again, was formed, and the troubles of the colony commenced from that date His friend Mr Lilley was then called upon to form a Government, which he did under very difficult circumstances and he (Mr Pring) went in prepared to oppose that Government, and he expected to find Mr Palmer equally energetic in his opposition but he was surprised to find him very freely to t re L Hoy Administration Then he saw Mr Taylor and Mr. Hodgson taken into the Ministry and a system of you scratch me and I'll scratch you" was comedian which he could not understand, and did not at all approve of Lil match he found Mr Palmer supported, the Immigration Bill of the Government although he knew it was opposed to his opinions on that question, but the whole matter was cleared up when he discovered that the J Twenty one Years Leases Bill was coming on the arrangement was plainly this 'If you give us the facts by one years' leases, we will support your Immigration Bill, and he got disgusted with the whole proceedings About that time the people of Brisbane were agitating on the qui ation of railway extension and he was requested to address a public meeting in that hall on the question He did so and who herself to the House h was asked by Mr Palmer r why he xx at and arising public meetings last id of the drug to his duties in the House and he told him to mi 11 his own business, and from that time all political connection between them ceased When the Lilley ad ministration resigned 1, Mr Pi'nur took office, and he would do him the credit to say that he did not seek i but inste y 1 of pursuing a liberal policy he sought to go back to the old squatting system which was in force ve is ago. He went to the country on the question of railway extension and, n) had been shown by Mr Lilley, there was a majority in favor of such extension so far as the wishes of the A tulle were re ¡ re tent d and had it not been for our habits and g (this: over by other means some of the si who were pledged to support railway the Government Wowan have been in a minority Hexxoull, however impress on the meeting that the question of railway extension was not the only foundation the conduct of the Opposition not thinking fit to resign after their close it on the tariff the Government subsequently proposals redistribution of electorates on a very magnificent sent by which the House would be in re set in over fifty members But there was never any intention to pass it a was clearly shown by their opposition to the repeal of the two thirds clause, and it was simply a sham and a delusion then, when the Premier came to meet Parliament in the third session, what did they find a there was no Re- distribution of Electorates Bill brought in, out be brought in what was called a measure of electoral reform which would give manhood suffrage. The Opposition members looked aghast The Government absolutely went beyond their views in the liberality of the measure, but when they came to examine the bill they could find no manhood suffrage, but there was a clause containing an education test which would have the effect of depriving thousands of intelligent men of the franchise The Government were defeated on this, and the Premier actually asked time to consider what course they would put guest but they accepted the defeat, instead of resigning, as they ought to have done, according to constitutional practice In fact it was impossible to know, under existing circumstances, when a Ministry could be made to resign, and it appeared that if they chose they could remain in power as long as they pleased They ultimately withdrew the bill. The Additional Representation Bill was never brought before the House, but it was circulated amongst the members, and it was clearly intended to return new members the majority of whom would be supporters of the Government The policy of Mr Palmer thus crept out The Redistribution of Electorates Bill was a dodge, and the Additional Representation Bill was the measure really meant to be passed, and, if they succeeded in that the redistribution could then be settled so well pleased, and their power be preserved (However -tr ) They desire j no immigration or BetftimT" on the land, but belonged to that class whole-souled sooner see fenced in runs with out their herds, so long as they got their wool sent home and their supplies back (Hear, hear ) This was their policy, and it simply meant sit still and do nothing, and if it was carried out, what, he would ask, would become of the colony ? Mr Palmer had said that railways must be made by and by, but not at present, but he maintained that the colony would be no better able to carry on such works twenty years hence than it was now, because no matter how st addy the revenue increased, the expenditure would absorb it all He pointed out that no more favorable opportunity could present itself than the present for borrowing money At the same time, however, he would not advocate any injudicious expenditure, and he was not aware that it was the intention of the Opposi- tion to rush into the market for a heavy loan for immediate outlay But he maintained that the whole world and prosperity of the colony depended on its progress, and he failed to see how it was to progress if it was allowed to remain in its present state A policy of progress was desired by the people, and it was the duty of the Government to carry it out or reign He could not therefore give his support to the Government, because their policy was retrograde, and not conducive to the interests of the country He remembered on one occasion telling the present Colonial Secretary that he would find out some day what a powerful minority could do, and he (Mr. Pring) believed he (Mr Palmer) was now conscious of it, and it he expected that a majority of one would carry him through he was very much mistaken It was curious to observe in the addresses of the members of the Government to their son stituents, how they harped on the; question of a minority being ruled by a majority, and he admitted that it would be very wrong for a minority to attempt to rule a majority , but then, in the present case there was only a majority of one, and they should consider how that major city was obtained With reference to the conduct of the Acting Governor he (Mr Pring) thought he was perfectly justified in commenting on his conduct, and although he believed that that gentleman acted conscientiously to the best of his judgment, he maintained that the proper course for him to have pursued was to call Parliament together as requested in the mo moral of the Opposition By adjourning the House for five months and thereby usurping the power of the Governor, the Government clearly acknowledged that they had no right to a dissolution, and yet when driven into a corner they demanded it (Hear, hear.) The constitutional course when one party failed to carry on the business of the country was to exhaust the House, and he contended that a Ministry could have been formed in the present House which could have carried on the business Of course a dissolution would have to come, but it would not have come until there was a larger amount of representation in the House and the feelings of the country it would then be fairly tested on the question of railway extension Mr Palmer would not have dared to oppose an Additional Representation Bill after his conduct in office, and had this been carried the result would have been very beneficial to the colony With regard to the struggle now going on, he believed that the Opposition would be returned with a majority of one, and his ground for the opinion was, that although only one seat on the Oppo- union was doubtful, several seats on the Government side were by no means safe (Hear, hear) He therefore thought it very probable that the position of parties would be as he stated when the House met and if it was so he would be well satisfied, as what would follow could be easily settled (Applause) He explained that the policy of the Opposition, although it was not necessary that an Opposition should have a policy, was settlement on the lands, coupled with Humiliation and electoral reform, and ud vocated general railway extension, in order to give facilities for settlement He also expressed a belief that it was possible that the dummies lands might yet be recovered for the use of the people because fraud vitiated every contract With regard to the Polynesian labor question, he regretted very much to see by the papers by the late mail that Mr A relief and Sir Robert Mackenzie had not put the feeling of the people of the colony fairly before the British public The people here had never encouraged P lyntsians,andhe contended that if the Act was strictly adhered to the agitation on the subject would not now be so great It was der the Act was not being carried out properly for it provided that the engagements should be made with the Polynesians at the islands, until tent he saw adver movements in the papers offering, them for hire at the theatre This was a < ver the intention of the Act, and it was the mit of the Government if it this not prop iii scr ministered He would not object to such labor in the tropical parts of the colony when it was suitable, but he was opposed to it as t i p in 1, against white labor In conclusion we can he hoped to always merit the supper which he had already received from his constituents In answer to electors he said he was in favor of a reduction of the ad later in i titles and that he was opposed to Polynesian labor except where it was as closely nect a day to facilitate the cultivation of tropical products A vote of confidence in Mr Pim"' w s then proposed by Mr SpEECh seconde i by Mr M'CuLLtN, and carried amid entire estate cheers Mr PinG briefly replied, and a vote of thanks to the Chairman terminated the proceedings The Prince s Lot ist and um Island on State Occasions-A London corre- pondent of a iW \oA Journal describes the dedication of the Royal Albert Hall in London, present at which were the Queen an most of the Royal family, says - jar" Pl|UCt" , Wales is pretty and popular, but to day most eyes are turned on a figure that follows all clad in white silk with veil and bonnet of white and a wreath of orange blossoms about his forehead It is the bride of last week, the franc ss Lorn c Uarclnouc s of Love, by whose side walks her brother, Prince Arthur, and not her husband or to marry a Princess does not touch a man a Prince, and royal etiquette thinks nothing of putting usunder bride and bridegroom The Marquis, looking more boyish than ever, walks some ranks behind his wife Blands at at from her when they had reached! the dais and afterwards, when the whole party go raise their boxes cannot sit even in the same box(«,hhci Nobody seems to be troubled about it, yet there in the Cabinet box is that proud Duke of Argyll looking down on the current scene, and one would really like to know I what he thinks of the social law that ranges his on so far below his son's wife "
