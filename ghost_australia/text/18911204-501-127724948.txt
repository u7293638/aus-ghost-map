An old Story Re-told. A Mousing newspaper in this town (says the Now York Sun) has been telling its readers a gliOBt story of a fire iu the Tombs, and of a condemned murderer who went up or out in the flames, leaving only a small heap of ashes to mark tho spot where he had been. The writer has evidently got hold of the wrong end of tho tragedy of Jobu C. Colt, who mur dered the printer Adams, was tried, sentenced, and prepared for execution on the afternoon of thut ' dark day ' in the autumn of 1843, which had been selected by tho second advent preacher and prophet, Miller, as the time for the final consummation of #11 things. Colt's family had moved heaven ni:d earth to save him, and when a fire broke out in the Tombs belfry just before tlio hour of execution it was believed that a rescue wa3 intended. Tho murderer was locked in liis cell while the flames were exting uished, and when the guards returned he was found dead on his cot, a bloody knife in his hand. He had committed suicide. It was rumored that he had escaped and another body had been sub stituted for his, but tlie corpse was identified by the Rev-. Dr. Anthony, rector of St. Mark's Church, who at tended him, and by others, so that Â»o mistake was possible. A dozen years afterward somebody asked his brother, Col. Samuel Colt of revolver fame, whether John C. Colt wus alive. ' That,' was the reply, ' is something that only God Almighty and Sara Colt know.'*
