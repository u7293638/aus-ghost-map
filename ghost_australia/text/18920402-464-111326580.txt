A GHOST IN THE COLLEG1 PaEK. Considerable anxiety, s&ys; a Dublin journal, February 20, has been escited in Trinity College by the alleged appearance of a ghost in the Col lege Park. A few days ago, bet tv eon 5 end 6 p.m , a member of the University Harriers, well known for his athletic prowess, was returning £rorn the pavilioD, when he wna surprised to cea the figure of a man running swiftly round the park. He immediately gave chase, but to his astonishment the figure easily outdistanced him, end disap peared, apparently through the closed door lead the building but could find ao trace of the mys terious athlete. He told the circumstances to a friend and they determined to watch at the 3amo hour on the following evening. Stationing them selves behind a clump of trees tbey waited for some little time, when suddenly they became aware of a shadowy figure gliding swiftly by. They both pursued at full speed,, bufc were quits unable to get close enough to make out anything of the[strange visitant but a mere outline o£ the form which made for the Anatomy portion of tbe Medical School Buildings, and there disappeared aa bofore, leaving no trace behind him. Much per plexed both returned to tbo College, and the subject has been much discisssed sincep both gentlemen being positive as to the evidence of theie reuses. It has, at all events, suggested a subject for on essay to be read at the Philosophical Society at their next meeting, when some interest ing experiences tending to elucidate the subject will probably be related.
