A GHOST AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. During the last weeks a story bas been going about that the rooms, situated in tbe Speaker's Court, of Mr A. J. C. Miluan, Assistant Clerk of tbe House of Commons, are haunted. The apparition, it was stated, took the form of Mrs Milman, and always appeared in her absence. A reporter o£ the " London Evening News " called on Mr» Milman, who very kindly told hita all about it. "The funny thing about the story," 6he said, " is that it is perfectly trne. It has been going on for years. People are constantly telling me that they have seen me in places where 1 have certainly not been at the time they mention. I have neTer seen my double myself, But I have heard of it. One night when I had just retired to my bedroom I heard a noise outside the door, and made sure there was something there. I went out and found all the doors on the landing open. I went back and fastened my door by means of a night-bolt, which is worked by a rope from the bed. The handle of the door was immediately turned, and the door pushed open again, the bolt be* ing shot back. X again went "out and found nobody there. Then I ran for two of the servants, my maid from the top of the bouse and the butler from the bottom." As they came to me I knew that they must intercept anyone on the stairs. Tbe maid had.seen nobody, but the butler had }ust met me coming through the folding doors of the bottom corridor." One of my governesses some time ago left me simply because of meet ing this strange sight so often. Only to-day a young lady who was staying in the house told me she had seen me some where where I bad not been."
