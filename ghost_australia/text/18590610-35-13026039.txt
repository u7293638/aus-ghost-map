CHINA AND THE CHINESE. 1 THE BISHOP OF VICTORIA (Hongkong), delivered the opening lecture of the session of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, on Tuesday evening, the 7th instant. Tho chair was taken by the Rev. Dr. Woolley, one of the vice- presidents of the Institution ; on the platform were Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart., the Bishop of Sydney, the Rev. Thomas Dinney, and other gentlemen. Tho fol- lowing is a verbatim report of the lecture. The subject on which I have undertaken to address you this evening is " China and the Chinese " I may as well state to you at the very commencement, that, from the limited time placed at my disposal, my address will necessarily partake of a very desul- tory and general character. At the same time, I hope to be able to give you a brief and general description of the religions that prevail in that land, and then to pass on to such detailed state- ments respecting their Government, their literary system, their usages and customs, and their civil institutions, as may enable, you to carry away from this meeting a tolerably accurate estimate of the political, moral, and social condition of that people. The very name of China is calculated to raise n feeling of curiosity and in- terest in the mind of the man letter, as well as of the Christian philanthropist offer great antiquity nu n nation—the vast amount of her population her isolated p i ion among kingdoms of the —the long period during which she has maintained her seclusion from the rest of mankind—the peculiar form of her social institutions and the prominence which she has lately oc- cupied in the political events or our native land—all combine to give interest to my subject and to direct attention to this remark- able race. One of the most striking facts that we must observe concerning the Chinese people is, the early, but stationary, civilisation which has prevailed amongst that race China appears to have been from the very earliest period peopled by a race advanced in ma- terial civilization, having a very simple form of religion, and possessing a system of patriarchal government. That country possesses an authentic history dating back nearly two thousand years before the Christian era. That continent seems to have been opened by an early migration from the cradle of the human race; there seems to have been an early movement eastward from Mount Ararat; and we fled that at a period pre- ceding any other known history she had her laws, institutions, and government. And such she has continued with but few in- terruptions down to the present time. For some few intervals the vast continent of China was divided amongst several indepen- dent governments, resembling what occurred during our own Saxon Heptarchy; but for more than two thousand years she has remained under one government, partaken of the same customs, and such as she was then she is in the main at the present time. A remarkable circumstances connected with China is, that we find originally the religion of the country to have been a pure mono- theism. Probably in no part of the pagan world have we pather recognitions than those we find in the writings of the earliest sages, of an Almighty Ruler and Upholder of the universe; and though there are but few and observe populations respecting this Divine Being, yet all the early Jesuit writers and historians of the Chinese people who first imported into Europe any detailed acquaintance with that country, give us their uniform testimony, that the Chinese in early times attributed to this Almighty Being the attributes of wisdomt, power, and justice, disposing evil princes, sustaining virtuous monarchs, and directing the affairs of this lower world. The Supreme Being they call TEEN (Heaven), or SHANF TI (tho Supreme Ruler). Put about a thousand years ago, during the Sung dynasty, there arose a school of materialist philosophers, who introduced their comments on the writings of the sages, so as to give an atheistic turn to the whole system. There was in their system no longer an Almighty Ruler of the world, but a mere material principle of order and of fatalism, denominated Li. But besides this recognition of an Almighty Ruler of the world, the ancient belief of the Chinese also peopled the various departments of nature, the elements, the hills, the vales, and the rivers, with an intermediate and subordinate class of beings whom they denominated SHIN (spirits or demigods)— who have came to be at the present time the popular divinities of China. They reserved the worship of the Supreme Being for the Emperor, who, as the Great High Priest of the nation, at certain periods offered up solemn sacrifices. Then the variant clauses in the subordination of civil and military officers, worshipped these demigods, these spirits or angels, the messengers or servants of the Supreme Being. The highest class of mandarins worshipped the spirits or gods of heaven : a step below these worshipped the gods of earth ; and there still lower in the social scale worship- ped the gods of the lower regions. So that the religion of the people, which was originally Monotheism, afterwards degenerated into Polytheism, and has at length become associated with the idolatrous worship of gods of wood, stone, and metal. There are also the more recent idolatrous systems of the Taoists or Buddhists, and the worship of the national canonized heroes, of men who from time to time have been elevated to the divine rank by the will of the Emperor. It has thus come to pass that the Chinese, though monotheists according to the tenets of their ancient writings, are yet in practice idolaters. And here I would remark, before I leave this part of my subject, an interesting of circumstance connected with the diffusion of Buddh- ism through China. The Buddhists arrived in China about the period of the Christian era; and it is well known, from their history, that it was principally by means of an itinerant priest- hood, by printed books, and by the Press, that Buddhism was propagated through the eighteen provinces of China. But if I were to speak of the native religious sects in China I should leave you under a misapprehension, unless I stated that in China, except among the priests of each religious system, there is hardly such a thing as a religious sect. The whole multitude seen to recognise the mental and moral ascendency of Confucius as their great law-giver and teacher—the great national sage of China, who generally advised his disciples not to attend too much to the concerns of another life. His argument was characteristic that we have only an imperfect knowledge of the affairs of this life ; why, then, should we waste our time in vainly attempting to understand the things of another world that we cannot well and perfectly perform the duties of this world, how then can we hope to please the gods ? But besides the priests of these Buddhist and Taoist superstitions, there are no persons who range themselves as partisans beneath the banner of any religious sect in China. The empire of supersti- tion is however, almost universal in that land. Their scholars generally profess to disbelieve in idolatry, and polytheism; but the literate class of the people, and the female sex generally, whenever a domestic calamity occurs, send for a Buddhist or a Taoist priest, who comes and performs various incantations and charms. This is the only way in which idolatrous rites are re- cognised by the Chinese, and obtain a prevalence in the country. The Taoist monks are not so numerous as the Buddhist priests ; and, perhaps, we might say that on the whole Buddhism is the most prevailing and influential form of superstition known in China. And yet their priests seem to exercise very little influence on society.They are generally found in numbers of from ten to a hundred ; some monasteries possess so large a number as three hundred priests. They have endowments in land and in the offer- ings of their votaries; but they possess no respect in the minds of the people. They go about from, place to place begging alms and ready to hire their services on any occasion of domestic calamity ; but they are generally men who have been sold in their infancy and become the properly of the temples; or are driven by their poverty or their crimes, or by outlawry, to find an asylum within these temples. It is a strange and affecting sight to see these monks in China, sauntering about in the pre- cincts of the temples with an idiotic smile and vacant stare, scarcely raised in intellect above the animal creation. These men are universally despised by the Government, and by the scholars of the country. But there is nothing like reverence amongst the Chinese people for religion. For instance, during the New Year holidays it is a common thing to see the temples filled with gambling-tables ; it is a common thing to see theatrical representations, too, carried on in their sacred buildings. I once saw a priest who, in order to practice asceticism, had burnt off with a-slow match one of his fingers to the end of the second joint, with the view, as he con- ceived, of obtaining greater purity, and to purge away some of tho grosser elements which form the compound being— man. But generally throughout the country beyond a few idle senseless superstitions, there appears lo bo no interest in the subject of religion; and, probably, the statement might with truth be made, that in no part of the world are there so few positive obstacles of a strictly religious kind to oppose the pro- gress of Christianity. I pass on to notice one custom universally prevalent among the Chinese race, which is found more dimly enthroned in the national belief,' and that is the worship of ancestors. I know scarcely any custom which requires more delicacy, more kindli- iles, more wisdom, more forbearance in the intercourse between foreigners and Chinese, than this custom of worshipping their ancestors. It forms a great difficulty in the intercourse between the missionaries and the Chinese race, I should state to you that the Chinese believe every man to have three souls; at death, one of three souls passes into the world of invisible spirits, the other is inducted to its habitation at he tomb by a superstitions cere- mony and the third is supposed to abide at the ancestral tablet; this is a small wooden plane, about twelve inches long by three inches wide, and is inscribed with the name of the deceased and the period in which he lived. Now, however much the Chinese race may differ in other respects; however lax they may appear in holding their own national superstition, yet the worship of their ancesters is great duty which every Chinaman fulfils, and which he never neglects on his return even after long separation from his native land. In some parts of the country the most beautiful scenes in the rural dis- tricts are occupied ty those little ancestral hills, in which a clan preserves with reverent respect the ancestral tablets of the first founders of their family. They sometimes date back many centuries, and record the simple fact that such a person of a cer- tain na ne, pet hap« a twelfth or thirteenth of th it pe libree, cime from such i prounco in iho liilerieir, indEittlcel in tb it district, and b"tnro those tablet« tho Chincso no lcciistomcel to bum in ccrse, to place offerinps of food, to offer f e-nflce« from time to time, noel, in Tact, to perf mi all that horn ige which in other countries Is genorslly nfforiled to denies During a rectntiiiit In tho nortbtrn pjrtse ef China, about SIN. uioi ths aero, I took ii journev of about thlrtetn diys fioni the cm of Nu erpo, thrtiif,h u ponton of tho pr »ince ot Chclil e irg to S i inf,liie T FI ej ii during that tiip for a prrioel of four elie« in tho largo and populous city of Hnnghbow.

I onco saw a magnificent tomb which must havo cost an immense sum of money, 1 itelj rnl'cd by a rich family to tho memory of a dcccised f thor Bit it appears thal in s uno of the c in ed images of am nats, or what wo should call the armorial be nings or escutcheon, along the precinct of this tomb they bael departed slightly from the ane'ent pre- cedent, and hail brought thenieches within the meshes of some sumptuarj law The mandarins of the neighbourhood, desirous of practt ing extortion, gladly sieved tho opportunity, nnel ln v oil ed the family in lair suits which ultimately stripped them of nil the properti they po«scsEed 1 he tomb is the onlj thing that now remains of tne large propertj amassed bl the deceased parent liequenel> as I saw in different part of the country, the great respect gil en lo parents, tho deference pile! to oge, the *. great power of authority conceded by universal consent to ancient mothers and grnndmothor«, I felt that this waa a feature in their national character which could be equalled probablj in no other part of the world 1 helleie that tho national cohesion of China during so last and unprecedented a period of time amid the ruin of surrounding empties and the frequent changes of her own dynasties, is a remarkable historical comment on the fulfilment of the temporal promise annexed to the fifth commandment, " Honor tby f ithcr and thy mother, that thy days mav be long In the land ?which the Lord thy God givctk thee " It may nppenr strango that a people who poi such respect to their parents, and enow such veneration to age, should generally bo Biippcfed to have none of the kindly feelings and tender pity dictated bj human nature towards their own offspring I fear that with all my prédilections in favour of tho Chinese chnractor, I must state that thcroportof the prevalence of female infanticide in China U only too true It may notho right to say that the practice prevails in all parta of the country, yet I havo taken great pains to learn from the people lu distant villages, and to collect statWtlcal faols; and, grounding my opinion on these data, I have been compelled to come to the conclusion that In the villages of the island e>l Arno)', mut in tho adjacent parta of the province of Kokten, nein ly onc- halfof the female offspring are put to eleath, and this not so much from any cruelty on tho part of the parents, as from tho poverty nf the nialia population. They never put to death their malo offspring, knowing that ns sonn as a son comes to mun's agc, lie will be nb'.o to support his p u enta in honourable ease-. But their daughters uro considered ns use-less cnctim. bruscos, anil after a period aro married into other families. They believe, too, that females cannot perform sacrificial ofTc-rlngs to tho elend, consequently families ee ti limit it ton consider It a very great inlsforlune, II« there is no on« lo sustain the fiimilv n-imc, anil no ono from year after year to ero)ship at the tombs, nnel to offer sacrificial ric». Th" dreadful effects of fcmielo infanticide ate checked In some paris of tl>e country by the institution of foundling hospitals. The Chinese inf.mts, rescued from drowning, or picket I up by the way side, aro brought lo tho hospitals, and pis-eel through a littles elrnevcrlnto the Inner patt tif iho building Hut I believe that tlieso foundlings uro saved from an cully elo.itb, onlv to bo purclia»cel by Chincso speculator In aller times, nnel subjected loo gene- rally ton life of de-gradation, worse than death itself ¡n infancy, Tho marriage customs nf the Chineo have one pcculiir fe.ituro that would strike -.is as very ntijeciiemsb'e. Their marriage con- traéis are generally mule in very early life-, and the severest ¡,en altles aro Imposed "upon any Chinese f.nnily who commits any breach of contract in regal el to mntriinonlil engagements. They nro generally betiolhi el in ohiîdliood hy their parents, and their own wl-lics or inclinations au- never consulted. Soma time ago I had a pupil ee ho, after spending four years in Melbourne, ir lurncd home, relng commanded by his father to marry. Ho had ten thousand dollars willi him, and was i very intelligent i espect- able youth. The ncci-inn ot his wielling was the first interview ho had had with his wire. Yet ho was twenty-four years of age, nnel hail been cngnged to her fur slxlotn yeais. T/houi'li he li.ul thus been betrothed at the early i-ge- eif eight year?, and bael lived for sixteen years within two English miles nf'her f.ill'cr's home, he had never fixed his eyes on the fjceof lils hi Ide until the occa- sion of the wveldeug di>y, when ltd out from tho gally elecomted sedan ohilr of Hie mnrringo proci-a«iun, she ' waa lifieil by two matrons over the threshold e>f her husband's develing, and introduced for the fir.-t lime to her future lord and mailer. To such an cMont do t'-.e-y ciny these early betrothal«, that c.ses have been knoei n of t evo Chitie'sc mothers'who were neighbours agreeing to bc-.ioth their yet unlioin nlf.prlng, in the event of their being of opposite sexes. Ane*, when you see t-iis stale of things you cannot lie surpilscd to hear that polygimy prevjlla In Chln.i, and cartlea with it nodlsgrace. Tiiofirst wife whom a man marries nt the command of his patents is considered the only proper nnel lccl ¡matt- wife. They rulo jiavmnou-.it in tho house- hold, nnel the either wives ure called by lower titles as secondary wives, but their children- nrc legitímale. The first wife is nlono ioonsldoied the misiiess of the household, and often treats llic other secondary wives niih tjranny und cruelty, a» dtuejgcs and slaves, lu conveising with enllglitenrd Chincso who had been fra long timo ncquain c-1 with forclgncis, I have sometime* dwelt on tho iinrcasanableiieta of tlieso customs, Even when they «aev tho unrcasonahlenci-s only to n sight extent of other practices, tiny all seemed to regard polygamy as most ptollflo in elomcslio misery, and one of the cternest oursetof the land. They auld that no Imagination could ptcttiro tho cruelty, tho tyranny, and tho suicide* vrhloh prevail in huuscholils through tho plurality of wie es. Then, nguiu, ns rrgorela tho small feet of Chinese women ; many person« mvy think this ii very, perverted tnelo ; mid such undo..Meetly It Is, nut it la n strange fact that those Chincso who havo associated witto foreigner«!, und havo travelled through Europe and America, como hackullh uiidlniln!«lied attachment to this foolish fashion. I knew a Chinaman who lived for some years In England niio had the advantage of a good education, and waR flattered and caressed in every way, who even give lils auto- graph to the Queen and Muco Alboi t. Iii- was for s.iitio four or flvo yenra an inmuto of my house, and yet I »nspcctvd that »If along it was only my intlneiico that prevented him from oramp'ng lils daughter's fret ; and when two yearn tig» I roturnrd from a vi«lr, lu England I found his little daughter hobbling about with her Icet tighlly bandaucd. It in donn from tho absurd idea Hutt other- wise they ahull lose caste, mid will no longer havo tho appearance of gentility, unless tit least one daughter of the family complica with the nbmrel usage. Thcro la One point which I must notice before I Icavo this part of my subject, it ia the Chinese catlmato of woll doing ; It ¡a one that might ho copied and followed hy the subjects mid oltlncns of every counlry in tho world. A Chinaman when ho wanta to do virtuous deed» on n largo scale, le-jialra idol-l temples | that I would not rotommeml)- ho bcauilflea tho public buildings, builds bridge», raises useful Institu- tions, erecta piucos of public rcfrcslimmt on the high road«, and in this way ho endeavours to obtain n plaoo In tho remomhranoo of iho people, and Is sometimes honoured bj tho pcrmitslon of tho emperor to allow lils children to creot a monu- mental arch In memory of lila good deeds. I havo Feen In Southern Inello, in l'alnmcotia, the chief town in Tinncvclly, an clecant anil substantial bridge acreija tho river, that mii«t have cpst XllO.COO, bulli by a rich Brahmin, for the oimvuiilencn and benrftt of tho public. Ho had saved a large amount of money from the emolumenta of au office held miller thô British Govern- ment. , I will now offer n fern- remarks upon tho Government of China. Hero I must oh'orvc that tho theory of pairl irchul government mid pitcrmel rule pervades every department of iho ompiic. This theory of patriarchal government often degenerates into a severo rille. Wo find this bonded patrlarohul government of the Chinese Government very oppressive through tho cruelty and corruption of the subordinate officers. The Emperor Is absolute ; his will is law throughout tho empire ; yet tho nu-ooracy of the . Chincso monarch is u very modifttel absolutism. Tho pcnplo e'ontrallv seem lo have no doubt of the bcnevolonce of lb» Impel lal will ; they only eloiibt ,tho rectitude nnd tho integrity of tho mandarins who aro appointed to carry that will into execution. In their conns of justice strïingo scenes sometimes occur. You may have seen pio'oiiul representations nf the form« çf judicial prtceduro in Chinese courts, tinrt fron tho largo number of nllcnelanta mid executioner» you .would think thot a great tieal of terror wns inspired awl cruelty exercised. A fev months ago I waa staying with t\ family at Shangliac.. A theft had been com- mitted, aid it eeûo found necessary toonil in the old of the Chincso mandarins. Two Chinese who had been devclllng lu tho family, a nurse anil ntiiloi-, were arrested, and remanded from timo to time for examination before lim district magistrate. Olio of tho olorgy residing near wuR commi'sloned to go and watch tho proceeding! and to not as nu lutcrui cter. On his return he reported to u?, that though tho 'defendants, had as u«ual to kneel on tho ground before tho magistrate and to be-ot their honda on the ground, yoi tliul their linpudcnco and bûldn"ss towards tho mandarins ex ccedeel all lila expectations ;,. that it was merely a quarrel between tho two defendants-tho woman gliing Vent to her tongue In tho moat abusivo languago. It w.is, in fact, such a proceeding us would not ho tolerated In an Kuropenn court of law. I ataicel that though tho Emperor of China is absolute, ynt it Is a lneidifii'd absolute government in Colon. In fnct there nrevarioti» mid very powerful channels of democratic lulluenoo In China. The elemoci alto element Is becoming formidable, mill few of the rulcro duo to «beet tbeir cars altogether to tho popular veilce. The institut!m which, nbovo all.otbi'ra,.gives forco to Chincso demo- cracy la Hie ancient aja-em of literary degrees-in olhejr words, a m »tem of competitivo examination for tho posta of honour and tho emolumenta or oflloo. In China, from ancient times tho professed theory of tho government baa been tu confer tho highest offices of the state 'on thoso native« who havo acquired literary degree!. And it lauiemurkalilo fact that tho Slantcliow Tartars, who, nbovo two centuries ago, subjugated China hy force of nrma, hiivc lu their turn been conqucre-el by tho civilization of tho subject race, refpec ing this litrrory system of promotion, and oon se-nting to associate tho Chincso vaco with thcmse-lve-a in tho government of tho country. Tbo first or InwcBt degree is coufcrred by examination in every department. Every thiid year mi examination is held of those «nu f>ni gra- duates, for promotion lo the second or higher degree of leen-jin, lu the cnplt ii cities of each province. ' Iii the province of denton tho number of successful candidates is limitoel bv law to scsrntv-two.
