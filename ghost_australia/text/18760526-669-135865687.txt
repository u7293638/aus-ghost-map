' Make railways into the interior,' is the cry raised by the Newcastle coal monopolists, who dread the passing of the amount on the Esti mates for a railway from Sydney to Illawarra. They try to frighten country members with the name ' Jllawarm,' as if it were a goblin or a ' Kiama ghost,' that would put a stop to all railway extensions into the interior. , But Illawarra is neither a goblin nor a - Kiama ghost,' , and we certainly have never been' ob structionists. We can -appeal to the, columns of tho Mercuiy, and to tho'votcs,-in. Parliament, of- oar representatives, to prove 'that we have ?always, been the fast friends of railway exten sion into the interior, and this,',too, without ever having previously insisted that they will ? pay. And the policy hitherto adopted by the ' people of Illawarra in that respect will be con tinued by .'them- and their representatives in ?Parliament, unless the' country members are seduced by interested persons to render unto us evil for good.' Surely this- ought to satisfy the country members 'that the people of 'Illawarra arc entitled to their .votes, and more especially 1 as it ja for' a line that will pay, and not cost the country one shilling, but, on tho contrary, yield a considerable nelfc revenue, nn'd unques tionably will not retard railway extension inlo ' ,.i,tbe interior. to' the extent of .one 'shilling in ( ? expenditure,1 or rod '.in' length, or. one day of ..delay? Our- motto is progiess, and '.we adhor 1 the selfish greed ; of monopolists, and schemers '''?who are striving to ' prevent ' the vast resources . of this colony being, developed, and would keep 'countless millions of'tons of excellent coal locked ,np, in 'order that they may 'enrich, themselves' , by monopoly and high l prices. -% The whole ' ? community must bleed, in order, that they' may . grow rich. The people, of Illawarra, and tho.so of Sj'dney also, are waiting with ' intense * anxiety to learn their fate, in the Legislative Assembly, with respect to the 'Sydney' and Illawarra railway estimate. .-]3ut, we have ,no ' hope tljat Mr. Diuns will see the'folly of per- | severing iii' pushing forward his own paltry [ interests, tp thp- incalculable injury of those of his own 'constituents and the public.

And there can bo nothing ruoro certain than that what is Tiow spoken of as the Metropolitan and Illawarra liiio of railway will become within a compara tively speaking few years the Great Southern Coast line of New South Wales, extending as it then shall from Sydney, through the Illawarra, Sh.oalh.aven, Bega, and Twofold Bay districts, until it connects with the Victorian line which runs 'throiigh Gippslund toward the borders of this colony.
