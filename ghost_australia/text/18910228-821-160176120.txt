Rei departed, wondering and heavy at heart, and Meriamun the Queen passed into her beu chamber, and there she bade the eunuchs suffer none to enter, made fast the doors, and threw herself down upon the bed, hiding her' face in .its woven cushions. Thus she lay for many hours.as one dead—till the darkness of the evening gathered in the chamber. But ', though she moved not, yet in her heart there; burned a fire, now white with heat as the' breath of her passion fanned it, and' now waning black and dull as the tears fell from her eyes. For now she knew ail that the long foreboding, sometimes dreaded, sometimes desired, and again, dike a dream half forgotten, was indeed being fulfilled. She knew of the devouring love that must eat her life away, knew that even in the grave she' should find no rest. And her foe'was no longer, a face beheld in a vision, but a living woman, the fairest and most favoured, Helen' of Troy, Argive Helen, the' False Hathor, the torch. that fired.great cities, the centre of all desire, whose life was the daily doom of mem Meriamun was beautiful, but her beauty Ealed before the face of Helen, as a fire is slain y the sun. Magio she had also, mbre than any who were on the earth; but what would her spells avail against the magic of those changing eyes ? And it was Helen whom the Wanderer came to Beek, for her he had travelled the wide lands and sailed the seas. But when he told her of one whom he desired, one whom he [sought, she had deemed that she herself was that one, ay, and had told him all. ; At that thought she laughed out, in the mad ness of her anger and her shame. And ho had smiled and spoken of Pharaoh her lord—and the while he spoke he had thought not of her but of the golden Helen, Now this at least she swore, that if he might not be hers, never should' he be Helen's. She would see him dead ere that hour, ay, and herself, and if it might be, Helen would she see dead also. To what counsel should she turn ? On the morrow night these two met; on the morrow night they would fly together. Then on the morrow must the Wanderer be slain. How should he be slain and leave no talc of murder* By poison he might die, and Kurri the Sidonian should be charged to give the cup, And then she would slay Kurri, saying that he' had poisoned the Wanderer because of his hate and the loss of his goods and freedom j and yet how could she slay her love f If once she slew him then she, too, must die and seek ■ her joy in the kingdom that Osiris rules, and there she might frad little gladness. I What, then, should she do? No answer came into her heart. There was one that must answer in tier soul. Now she rose from the bed and stood for a 1 while staring into the dark. Then she groped her way to a place where was a carven chest of olive wood and ivory, and drawing a key from her girdle she opened the chest. Within were jewels, mirrors, and unguents in jars of alabaster—ay, and poisons of deadly bane; but she touched none of these. Thrusting her hand deep into the chest she drew forth a casket of dark metal that people deemed ' unholy, a casket made of "Typhous Bone," for so tlicy call grey iron. She pressed a secret spring. It opened, and feeling within she found a smaller casket. Lifting it to her lips she whispered over it words of no living ! speech, and in the heavy and scented dark a ! low flame flickered and trembled on her lips, 1 as she murmured in the tongue of a dead people. Then slowly the lid opened of itself, like a living mouth that opens, and as it opened a gleam of light stole up from the box into the duskof the chamber. Now Meriamun looked, and shuddered as she looked. Yet she put her hand into the box and muttering, "Come forth—come forth, thou Ancient Evil," drew something to her and held it out from her on the palm of her hand. Behold, it glowed in the dusk of the chamber as a live ember glows among the ashes of the hearth. Bed it glowed, and green, and white, and livid blue; and its shape, as it lay upon her hand, was the shape of a coiling snake, cut, as it were, in opal and in emerald. For a while she gazed upon it, shuddering, as one in doubt. "Minded am I to let tbee sleep, thou horror," she murmured. "Twice have I looked on thee, and I would look uo more. Nay, I will dare it, thou gift of the old wisdom, thou frozen fire, thou sleeping sin, thou living death of the death of the ancient city, for thou alone hast wisdom." Thereon she unclasped the bosom of her robe and laid the gleaming toy, that seemed a snake of stone, upon her ivory breast, though she trembled at its icy touch, for it was more cold than death. With both her hands she clasped a pillar of the chamber, and so stood, and she was shaken with throes like the pangs of childbirth. Thus she endured awhile till that which was a-cold grow warm, watching its brightness that shone through her silken dress as the flame of a lamp shines through a alabaster vase. So she stood for an hour, then swiftly put off all her robes and ornaments of gold, and loosing the dark masses of her hair let it fall round her like a veil. Now she bent her head down to her breast, and breathed on that which lay upon her breast, for the ancient evil can live only in the breath of human kind. Thrice she breathed upon it, thrice she whisperd, Awake/ Ami kef Awake!" And the first time that she breathed' the thing stirred and sparkled. The second time that she breathed it undid its shining folds and reared its head to hers. The third time that she breathed it slid from her bosom to the floor, then coiled itself about her feet and Blowly grew as grows the magician's magic tree. Greater it grew and greater yet, and as it grew it shone like a torch in a tomb, and wound itself about the body of Meriamun, wrapping her in its fiery foldB till it reached her middle. Then it reared its head on high, and from its eyes there flowed a light like the light of a flame, 'and lo! its faco was the face of ,'a fair woman—it was the face of Meria mun ! Now face looked on face, and eyes glared into eyes. _ Still as a white statue of the gods Btood Meriamun the Queen, and all about her form and in and out of hor dark hair twined the flaming snake. At length the Evil spoke—spoke with a human voice, but in the dead speech of a dead people, "Tell me my name," it said. "Sin is thy name," answered Meriamun the Queen. "Tell me wbenoe I come," it said again.' "From the evil that is in me," answered the voice of Meriamun. "TeJl-me whither I go." Where I go there thou fioest, for I have wanned thee in my breast ana thou art twined about my heart." Then the snake lifted up its human head and laughed horribly. " Well art thou instructed." it 'said. "So I lore thee as thou lovest me, and 'it bent itself and kissed her on the lips. "I am that Ancient Evil, that life wweh endures out of the first death; I am that Death which abides in the living life. I -am that which brought on thee the woe that is in division from the Heart's Desire, and the name thereof is hell. From life to life thou hast found me at thy hand; now in this shape, now in that.. I taught thee the magio which thou knowest; I showed thee how to win the throne! Now, what wilt thou of me, Meriamun, my mother, . my sister, and my child? From life to life I have been with thee. Ever thou mightest have put me from thee, ever thou fliest to'the wisdom which I have, and ever from thee I draw my strength; for though without me thou mightest live, without thee I must die. Say' now, what' is it? Tell me, and I will name my price. Nq more will I ask than must be; for—ah !—I am glad to wake and live again; glad to grip thy soul within these shining (folds, to be fair with thy beauty.!—to be foul with thy sin!" " Day thy lips against my ear and-thine ear against my lips," said Meriamun the Queen, "and I will say what it is I will of thee, thou Ancient Evil." ., Do the human-headed evil laid its ear against the lips of Meriamun, and Meriamun laid her lips against its ears,' and they whispered each to each.' There in the. darkneBS they, whis pered, while the witch-light glittered down the grey snake's shining folds, beamed in. its eyes and shone through the Queen's dark hair and on her snowy breast. . At length the tale was told, and the snake lifted its woman's head high m the air, and again it laughed. " He seeks the good," it said, " and ho shall find the ill! He looks for light; and in dark "?o lo " nesB shall he wander! To love he turns, in lust he shall be lost! He would win the golden Helen, whom he has sought through many a war, whom he has followed o er many a sea, but first shall he find thee, Meriamun, and through thee death. For he shall swear by the snake who should have sworn by the star. Far hath he wandered—further shall he wander yet, for thy sin shall be his sin! Dark ness shall wear the face of light, evil shall shine like good. I will give him to thee, Meriamun, but hearken to my price. Mo more must I be laid cold in the gloom while thou walkeBt in the sunshine—nay, I must be twined about thy body. Fear not, fear not, X shall seem but a jewel in the eves of men, a girdle fashioned cunningly for tne body of a Queen. But with thee henceforth I must ever go—and when thou dicst, with thee must I die, and. with thee pass where thou doth pass—with tbee to sleep, with thee to awake again—and so on and on till in the end I win or thou win nest, or she wins who is our foe 1" " I give thee thy price," said Meriamun the Queen. "So once beforo thou didst give it," answered the Evil; "ay, far, far away, beneath a golden sky in another clime. Happy wast thou then with him thou dost desire, but I twined myBelf about thy heart and of twain came three and all the sorrow that has been. So woman thou hast worked, so woman it is ordained. For thou art that SHE in whom all woes are gathered, in whom all love is fulfilled. And I havo dragged thy glory down, woman, and I have loused thee from thy gentleness, and set it upon the earth, and beauty is she named. By beauty doth she work who is the golden Helen, and for her beauty's sake, that all men strive to win, are wars and woes, are hopes and prayers, and longings without end. But by evil dost thou work who art divorced from innocence, and evil shalt thou ever bring on him whom thou desirest. A riddle 1 A riddle! Read it who may—read it if thou canst, thou who art named Meriamun and Queen, but who art less than Queen and more. Who art thou ? Who is she they name the Helen T Who is that Wanderer who seeks her from afar, and who, who am I? A riddle! a riddle! that thou mayest not read. Yet is the answer written i n earth and sky and sea, and in the hearts of men. " Now hearken! To-morrow night thou halt take me and twine me aoout thy body, doing as X bid thee, and behold 1 for a while thy shape shall wear the shape of the golden Helen, and thy face shall be as her face, and thine eyes as her eyes, and thy voice as her voice. Then I leave the rest to thee, for as Helen's self thou shalt beguile the Wanderer, and once, if once only, be a wife to him whom thou desirest. Nought can I tell thee of the future who am but a counsellor, but hereafter it may be that woes will come, woes and wars and death. But what matter these when thou hast had thy desire, when he has sinned, and hath sworn by the Bnake who should have sworn by the star, and when he is bound to tbee by ties that may not be loosed. Choose, Meriamun, choose! Put my counsel from then and to-morrow this man thou lovest shall be lost to thee, lost in the arms of Helen; and alone for many years shalt thou bear the burden.of thy lonely love. Take it, and he shall at least be thine, let come what may come." Thus spake the Ancient Evil, tempting her who was named Meiiaraun, while she hearkened to the tempting. " I have chosen," she said, " I will wear the shape of Helen, and be a wife to hiin X love, and then let ruin fall. Sleep thou Ancienb EviL Sleep, for no more may I endure thy face of fear that is my face, nor the light of [ those flaming eyes that are my eyes made mad." Again the thing reared its human head and laughed out in triumph. Then slowly it unloosed its gleaming coilB. Slowly it slid to the earth and shrank and withered like a flaming scroll till at length it seemed once more but a shining jewel of opal and of ame thyst. The Wanderer, when he left the inner secret shrine, saw no more the guardians of the gates, nor heard the clash of the swords unseen, for the gods had given the beauty of Helen to Odysseus of Ithaca, as it was foretold. Without the curtains the priests of the temple were gathered wondering—little could they understand how it came to pass that the hero who was called Eperitns had vanished through the curtains and had not been smitten down tjy the unseen swords. And when they saw him come forth glorious and unharmed they cried aloud with fear. But he laughed and said, "Fear not. Vic tory is to him whom the gods appoint. I have done battle with the wardens of the shrine, and passed them, and methinks that they are gone. I have looked upon the Hathor also, and more than that seek ye not to know. Now give me food for I am weary." So they bowed before him and leading him thence to their chamber of banquets gave him of their best, and watched him while he ate and drank and put from him the desire of food. Then he rose and went from the temple, and agafii the priests bowed before lain. Moreover, they gave him the freedom of the temple, and keys whereby all the doors might be opened, though little, as they thought, had rhe any need o£ .keys. Now the Wanderer, walking gladly ana light of heart, came to his own lodging m the courts of the palace. At the door of the lodging stood Rei the priest, who when he saw hiTYij ran to bim aud embraced hun, so glad was he that the Wanderer had escaped alive. " Little did I think to look upon thee again, Eperitus," he said. "Had it not been for that which the Queen" and he bethought himself and stayed his speech. "Nevertheless, here lam unhurt of ghost or men," the Wanderer answered, laughing, as he passed into the lodging. "But what of the Queen t" , "Nought, Epentua, nought, save that she was grieved when she learned that thou hadst .gone up to the temple of the Hathor, there, as she thought, to perish. Hearken, thou Eperitus, 1 know not if thou art god or man, but oaths are binding both on men and gods, and though didst swear an oath to Pharaoh, is it not sot' "Ay, BeL I swore an oath that I would guard the Queen well till Pharaoh came again." "Art thou minded to keep that oath, Eperitus!" asked Rei, looking on him •strangely. " Art thou minded to guard the fair fame of Pharaoh's Queen, that is more precious than her life? Methinks thou dost understand my meaning, Eperitus?" "Perohance, I understand," answered the Wanderer. "Know, Rei, that I am so mmded." Then Rei spake again, darkly. " Methinks some sickness hath smitten Meriamun the Queen, and she craves thee for her physician. Now things come about as they were foreshown in the portend of that vision whereof I spoke to thee. But if thou dost break thy oath to bim whose, salt thou eatest, then, Eperitus, god or man, thou art a dastard." " Have I not said that I have no mind so to break mine oath," he answered, then sank his bead upon his bieast and communed with his crafty heart while Rei watched him. Presently he lifted up his head and spoke— '• Rei," lie said, "I am minded to tell thee a strange story and a true, for this I see, that our will runs one way and thou canst help me, and in helping me thyself and Pharaoh • to whom I swore an oath, and her whose honour thou holdest dear. But this I warn thee, Rei, that if thou doBt betray me, not thine age, nor thine office, nor the friendship thou hast shown mo, shall save thee." '• Speak on, Odysseus, Laertes'son, Odysseus of Itliaca," said Rei, "may my life be forfeit if I betray thy counsel, if it harm not those I serve." Now the Wanderer started to bis feet crying— " How knowest thou that name?" '•I know it,"said Bei, "and I tell thee that I know it, thou most crafty of men, to show this, that with me thy guilo will not avail thee," For he would not tell him that he had it from the lips of the Queen. "Thou hast heard a name that has been in the mouths of many," said the Wanderer; " perchance it is mine, perchance it is the name of another. It matters not. Now know this, I fear this Queen of thine. Hither I came to seek a woman, but the Queen I came not to seek. Yet 1 have not come in vain, for yonder, Rei, yonder, in the temple of the Hathor, I found Tier on whose quest I came and who waited me there well guarded till 1 should come to take her. On the morrow night I go forth to the teuiple, and there, by the gates of the temple I shall find her whom all men desire, but who loves me alone among men, for so it has been I fated of the gods. Thence £ bring her hither that here we may be wed. Now this is my j mind, if thou wilt aid mo with a ship and men that, at the first light of dawn, we should fide this land of thine and that thou shouldest j keep my going secret for a while till I have gained the sea. True it is that I swore to guard the Queen till Pharaoh come again; but as thou kuowest, things are so that I can best guard her by my flight, and if Pharaoh thinks ill of me—so it must be. Moreover, I ask thee, to meet me by the pylon of the temple ] of Hathor, to-morrow at one hour before mid night. There will we talk with her who is called the Hathor, and prepare our flight, and thence thou shalt go to that ship wliicli thou hast made ready. Now Bei thought a while and answered— " Somewhat I fear to look upon this goddess, yet I will dare it. Tell me, then, how shall I know her at the temple's gate?" "Thou shalt know her, Bei, by the red star which burns upon her breast. But fear not for I will he there. Say, wilt thou make the ship ready?" "The ship shall be ready, Eperitus, and though I love thee well,' I say this, that I would it rode the waves which roll around the shores of Khem and thou wert in it, and with thee she who is called the Hathor, that goddess whom thou desirest."
