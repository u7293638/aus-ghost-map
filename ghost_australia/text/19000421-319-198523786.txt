A GHOST STORY. In liis latest reminiscences. Sir M. E. Grant Duff records a ghost story— brought in amidst the surroundings of 1111 Episcopal Harden party— as follows:— To a garden party at Fulham I'alaee, where met, amongst others, , with whom I talked about his experiences ivhen he wus stay ing with us some years ago. saw no thing and heard nothing, hut was oppressed in the strangest way by a vague sense of terror, as if something alarming were ubout to appear. He told me ut the time that he felt "us if the glioSt were coming round the corner." Charles Bowen, who slept in a room next that occupied by, . accounts for what lie heard by supposing that it wus a sound transmitted in some odd way from a distant part of the house. What he did hear was the rustle of n dress past his bed, aud steps in the passage into ivhieli his room opened. Much surprised, he went into his wife's room, the same which was occu pied by . hut found that she hud not moved,' and he passed the rest of the night there.' The eminence of the two persons concerped— the one a very distinguished judge, the other a well- known man of science— make their statements interesting. Tliev curiously confirm the impression 'which my wife used to have of a light girl's footsteps tripping down the stair .which led from tlie passage above alluded to to the room adjoining the draivingroom, where she sat so much at- night.
