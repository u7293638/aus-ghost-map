THE DEFEAT OF HICKS PASHA. (Times, 23rd November.) KHARTOUM, November 20. A losT trustworthy sheikh, in the service of the Government, uri ed in Ducm yesterday, and reported a terrible disaster to Hicks Pasha and his army near Obeid The army of 11,000 men, including Hicks Pasha, the Governor General, and the entire staff, has been arms related in a defile at Kashgar, whither they had been led by a treacherous guide on the morning of 1st November Hicks Pasha and the entire army marched out of Melba's, the scene of the victory over the rebels a few days before The guide led them to a rocky wooded cattle, without water, where an ambuscade had been prepared by the rebels, who were armed with rifles and artillery y Hicks Pasha's force was so situated that he could not use his guns For three days the army, worn out by thirst, defended itself, but on the 4th instant it was annihilated to a man "V ately, At ten and fifty soldiers who were outside came in and were taken and earned prisoners to El Obeid The rebels captured chu by six Krupps, Nor denfeld, and mountain guns, and all the flags, munitions of war, and camels Wth Hicks Pasha were 41adeen Pasha the Governor General, Abbas Boy, Colonel Farquhar, Majors Seckendorff, Massy Warner, and Evans Cup tains Health and Anutyngi, Surgeon General Georges Bey, and Surgeon Rosenburg, Mr O'Donovan, the correspondent of a London newspaper, Moms Body, late Sergeant- Major Royal Horse Artillery , with certain Pashas and Boys, and about 1200 officers Kordofan is virtually lost Colonel Coetlogon, who, before the fatal news aimed, had succeeded in dealing the White Nile of the rebels and preventing any aid from going to them, want Ducm when the sheikh he lived He at once took him to Klin found, and is arranging for the defence of the city and the suppression of the expected revolt by calling in till the out lying gas users He nil j out coiiespondcutaic the sole stn living I Englishmen in the Soudan The first section of the army of Hicks Pasha near El Obeid reveals, writes the Times of 23rd November, Lie formidable nature of the religious revolt which has been developing force in the Soudan during the last three by car s under the self styled M dich Before the mutiny of the colonels at Can of in the summer of 1861, there had been symptoms of a coming using on the part of the slaveholders of the province of Kordofan aiitlDiufui Before Mr ubi had given the first sign of insubordination the Dongolavn, Mahomed Ahmed, had begun his car cci as a Mussulman enthusiast, and had in og lied to himself the title of Man of the long expected Redeemer of Islam He was thought by the Egyptian officials to be only a madman,' but his recent success shows that it w as gave rise to treat him and his plans with the contempt and indifference which were meted out to them in the v years 1886 and 1887 It is probable that, however, described the Mahomedan world may have been it that time and is Arabi's insur section showed it to be, Mahomed Ahmed would not have succeeded in carrying such large forces as he did to his side but for the peculiar condition of things in the Soudan, where the al no holding interest was supreme, and where the approach of the year ISSU was legal tied with apprehension as the date fixed for the emancipation of the slaves The using of the Mahdi, while not to be lightly treated as an ebullition of religious fervour, derived its chief importance from the fact that it was supported by the sheikhs and chiefs who had flourished under Zebehr, and whom all the of for us of Sir Samuel Baker and Gener al Gordon had not put down. In the summer of 1881 the movements and proclamations of this individual attracted the attention of Scout Fisher, then Governor of the Soudan, and an official was sent to make inquiries as to what were his plans and intentions At that time he resided in a small island of the White Nile, and he had already attached to his person a guard of chosen followers, who stood before him with drawn swords He refused, not unnaturally, the demand of the Egyptian official to accompany him to Khartoum and when a small force was sent by water to effect his capture it was igno ominously repulsed and compelled to return empty handed to Scout Pasha Mahomed Ahmed then left his island home for a place of greater safety, and settled down at Gebel Geuir, where he was left during several months, not merely undisturbed, but at liberty to increase his influence among the neighbouring tribes, and, perhaps, to form a joint plan of action with the dealers in slaves His fame was further enhanced by the defeat, in December, 1884, of a force, under Rashid Boy, Governor of Fashoda, who attempted to expel him from Gebel Cedar In the early months of 1882 another and stronger expo ditton was fitted out by the new Governor General of the Soudan, Abel el Kader Pasha, and the command was intrusted to Yussuf Pasha, who had had nominal command of the expedition against Sebehr, in which the Italian Gessi had so much distinguished him self The situation was further complicated at this moment by the outbreak of what was at first a distinct rebellion in the province of Sennar, on the Blue Nile, but the leader of this using, hoping, no doubt, to attract men to his cause, gave out that he was the Mahdi's lieutenant, and assumed the title of his Vizier Gicgiei Pasha, an Austrian officer, succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon this popular loader, which had, at least, the effect of preventing the inborn action on the Blue Nile spreading as far as it seemed likely to do This success was, however, trifling when com pin ed with the Mahdi's great victory in June of the same year over the main Egyptian force under Yussuf Pasha He swept away and attacked that official at Gebel Geon, and victory had declared itself decisively in his favour Very few of the Egyptian soldiers escaped, while all their commanders were slain The Mahdi then armed some of his troops with the weapons captured on the field, but the mass of his followers still possessed only swords and spears The defeat of Yussuf was shown to be due to his own carelessness, but none the less it reflected credit on the military capacity of the Mahdi At this point, after a course of unchecked success, the Mahdi met with his first reverse He then attacked El Obeid, and was repulsed with the loss of 6000 of his warriors in one assault alone Elsewhere the rebels also failed to capture the towns where the least for indications had been erected, and it seemed as if the fanaticism of the Mahdi's followers would be able to effect very little against stone walls of earthworks During the months that witnessed the campaign of Tel el Kebir and the occupation of Cairo, there were rumours, on the one hand, of the dispersion of the Mahdi's hands, and, on the other, of their threatening Khartoum and the towns on the White Nile with attack Soi cial times little short of a panic press tiled in Khartoum itself, notwithstanding that the insurgents had always shown a wholesome fear and respect of the liver gunboats the fine state of the case was revealed when the information came that the Mahdi was again 1 lying siege to El Obeid and that the gas men had been he dared to desperate straits Last winter with missed the capture of this town, and the larger part of the garrison, with the commandant, Iskander Bey, at then head went over to, and took service under the Mahdi Iskander was made use of by his conqueror for the purpose of enticing other Egyptian officials over to his side as the Defender of Islam, and a unions letter written by him to this effect was published in the Times of the 19th September last During the spring of the present year strenuous military pt operations were made for the effectual super easton of the rebellion, and considerable bodies of troops were sent from Lower Egypt to Khartoum for the purpose of the proposed expedition No movement could be attempted until after the close of the wet season in September, and, with a view of testing the quality and temper of the new force, many of whom had been Arabi's soldiers, a camp was formed at Um Um man, a place on the west side of the Nile, opposite Khartoum Here, by the end of August Hicks Pasha had collected an array of 7000 infantry, 120 cases sters, 300 Basin Bazotik cavalry, and about thirty guns, rockets, and howitzers of all sizes At Duem he was to have been joined by at least another 1000 men, and it is probable that several detached bodies of troops swelled the number of his force to more than 10,000 men The collection of the necessary number of camels presented one of the chief difficulties, but this was successfully overcome through the personal exertions of Alla ed Doon, the Gov or not General of the Soudan A further cause of delay was the wish to procure the co-operation of Adam, the so called King of Takale, a district south east of El Obeid , but, although his language was exceedingly cordial, King Adam gave, so far as we know, no direct assistance to the expedition An Egyptian official residing in his principal town sent, however, very prudent warning to his superiors to be aware how they proceeded against the Mahdi, as "he is very cunning He sleeps during the days, marches at night, and attacks at dawn Be cautious and beware of surprise The recent disaster invests this excellent advice with a melancholy significance On the 9th of September Everything was ready for a start, and the camp at Um Um man was broken up On that day Hicks Pasha began his march up the Nile following a route as near to the western side of the White branch of that river as the inundations would allow The spirits of the men were pronounced ex- cellent, and their officers expressed themselves highly satisfied with their morale No one doubted the result of the expedition or that the days of the Mahdi's power were already numbered On the 20th of Sen tember the force reached them, 110 miles south of Khartoum, and situated on the west bank of the Nile The march had been hindered by the flooded state of the country, but the men had done their 10 miles a day under an unusually fierce tropical sun El Obeid is distant from Duem by the direct way less than 150 miles but considera- tions of water led to the selection of a southern route, which increased the distance to fully 240 miles, involving it the same rate of pro gross a march of more than three weeks. On the 24th September an advance party left Duem to occupy the village of Shut, 15 miles on the road and the main body was to have followed as soon as a steamer by making up the last of the stores had an iv ed It is probable that the army had reached the neighbourhood of El Obeid before the end of last month, and as one of our telegrams this morning. seems to show, had even inflicted a defeat on a portion of the Mahdi's forces, when it was drawn into a prepared ambuscade by a tieticherousguidc ThcLgj ptiansoldieissccmto have fought with the most doggeddeteininia tion, and not the least suspicion is one lesson as to either then fidelity of their valour timing three days then resisted the assets of the fanatical was lor's of the Mahdi who are to a large extent, composed of those armed slaves whom General Gordon has described is follows -"Small, dapper looking follows, like antelopes, fierce, unspar mp, the tenor of Central Aft ice, having a pi est age far beyond that of the Government " Then overwhelming numbers, and then reckless disregard of their own fees, proved more than a match for the discipline of the Egyptian troops, exhausted as they were by more than a month's severe matching in a desert, vi horse water was both limited and impure The details of the battle may never be fully known, but that is no doubt that the small hand full of English officers covered themselves with glory and set then gallant soldiers a brilliant example of mere party Numbers, however, prevailed, and although the Mahdi must have suffered an immense loss he will consider so signal a success cheaply purchase 1, for whatever may have been the number of slain Ghosts, their places would be promptly filled on the morrow of so decisive a triumph The consequences of so great a disaster are not exhausted even hythe annihilation of an army of more than 10,000 men Already there is talk of a precipitate withdrawal from Khai trim and of retreating through Berber to Suakim Those who suggest this appear to have forgotten that Suakim itself has been the scene of another Egyptian disaster, and that communications between that port and Khartoum have been threatened by a rebellious tubes This was the case before the news of the defeat at El Obeid was known The recent disaster is hardly likely to induce any of the tribes to feign any further respect for the Khedive's authority "The whole of the Soudan is in a blue " says one of our correspondents and it can well be believed But we hate or the future c decision taken as to the fate of the Soudan may be, and whether it is decided to abandon or not those costly possessions which Mehemet Ali first began to acquire, and which the late Khedive Ismail did so much to extend a calm view of the military situation would show that the only way to repair the misfortune is to hold on to Khartoum for the present The solitary ray of hope in the situation is furnished by the fact that Colonel Coetlogon was not present at the battle, and has therefore escaped the common destruction He has hastened to Khartoum to superintend measures for its defence, and as the Egyptian Governor General Alla ed Deen fell he is left in sole command It is said that he can still muster 1000 regulars when the outlying gan sons have joined him, and with these, aided by the river gunboats, he ought to be able to make a stout defence. REFERRING to the recently floated New South Wales loan, the Sydney Morning Herald observes -' For yet another reason are we glad of the success of the loan It cannot fall to help our Victorian neighbours next month There are four and a half millions are eating investment in colonial stocks, and while the securities of New South Wales for a variety of reasons are undoubtedly the better, there is no such difference in value as to lead to the supposition that those who have been unable to get the one will not take the other The fact that it is now known that so much money awaits investment may increase the competition for the Victorian loan, and get for it even a better price than has been given for outs In looking at the price paid for the loan of course we must remember that the deferred payments and accrued interest will knock off the premium, leaving only a net return of about it) This is the second loan that has been floated for fifty years, and so far without any explanation from the Colonial Treasurer The present prices of our existing thirty and fifty years' loans do not favour the idea that more value is attached to those having the longer currency On this subject perhaps the Treasurer may give us some explanation in his financial statement " THE Jewish Chronicle, commenting on the "bitter outcry about the homes of the London poor," says -"vice and crime and want and suffering cannot be laid to the charge of a mere abstraction The heedlessness and the want of thought which have permitted these blots * i disfigure and disgrace our times are chargeable with the mischief In other words, the responsibility for having permitted the humbler classes to live under conditions which must inevitably have produced w wrongdoing and suffering lies upon the nation at large The cry that his gone up from the true tiling and sinning misses congregated at our very doors has hitherto been all but unheeded by us, and now in the moment when conscience is awakened, we may well exclaim with the ancient patriarchs, ' Verity we are guilty con- cerning our brothel, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he entreated us, and did not hearken to him " Mr. your own fault if you remain sick or out of health, when you can get Hop Bitters Read,
