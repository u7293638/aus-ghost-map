Superstitions j Hindoo and English. Tho following stories of superstition .are told by, " E.A.K," describing in TEMPLE BAR the " Ways of the East."-One day an English magistrate was paying a visit to a Hindoo gentleman, who was an old friend of his, in the course of which ho happened to yawn ; to his astonishment up" - jumped the Rajah aa if galvanised, and began, furiously snapping hi3 fingers in startling proxi mity to his face. Observing his visitor's look of unfeigned surprise, he explained that this waa dono to scare away tho devils, who might other wise Bei zo tho opportunity to jump down his throat. How strange it seems to us this practical belief in devils, and fear of them, combined with . so insultingly lowan idoa of their intelligence and power I I once heard, however, an odd in stance of the same fear and yet contempt for un seen powers shown by an English lady in tho beginning of this century-a Bishop's wife, too ! I -v/ho was afraid of ghosts, and if left alone in the house would whistle as she walked through the passages at night in order that the ghosts. 1 might take ber for a man.
