Death of Mr. Dind. A PIONEER THEATRE MANAGER. The death, in his eighty-second year, of Mr. William Dind, has removed from our midst the oldest Australian theatrical manager, and one who will be remembered by the oldest of our playgoers as a genial honorable man. Mr. Dind passed away at his residence, Cowle's-road, Mossman's Bay, on January 23, after a long, busy, and eventful life. He first entered upon theatrical manage ment at the old Prince of Wales Theatre (which stood on the site of the present Theatre Royal) over forty years ago, and for twenty-two years was almost continuously associated with its management. A partner at one time with Mr. Dind in the old Prince of Wales was the veteran George Coppin (now of the Melbourne Theatre Royal), and the actor longest associated ywith him is genial ex-Alderman Rainford, who played under his management for eighteen years. The pantomime "The House That Jack Built " was the last production Mr. Dind was responsible for, and it was during its financially disastrous run that the Old Prince of Wales Theatre was burned. After this event Mr. Dind retired from theatrical management and settled at North Shore, of which municipality he was for several years the highly respected Mayor. In spite of the ups and downs of the profession, "the Ghost" never failed to walk on Tuesday morning under Mr. Dind's management, and many an old Australian actor, dead and gone, has had cause to remember him as a good and true friend.
