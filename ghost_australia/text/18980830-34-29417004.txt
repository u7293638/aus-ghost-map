Miss Florence Menkmeyer, who lias just ■returned to London at tlie conclusion of a prolonged and highly successful tour on the Continent, leaves for .Australia v.tth her sister by the Prince Regent Luitpold on the 28th August. It is her intention to make an extended tour of all the princi pal centres of Australia and Kew Zea land. It is noteworthy that Miss Menk iheyer's great successes have been achieved in the most highly cultivated musical com anmities. In Rome she was especially suc cessful, -and also in Germany, where it was admitted on all hands that she was the most; understanding and sympathetic in •terjimer <of the beauties and subleties of Beethoven who had been heard there for -many" years. It is nearly four years since Miss Menkmeyer was last heard in Aus "tralia. ' --SSie hat which is %bout to be handed "round the empire on behalf of poor old Sims- Reeves will, one supposes, have to be filled, though it is a gross scandal that any step of the 6ort should be necessary. For 30 years the great tenor seldom opened his month under a hundred guineas, and what he did with the huge sums he earned no one has decisively discovered. Rela tions -unquestionably eased his pockets somewhat, a penchant for gambling as sisted materially, yet even these weak nesses'should not have melted such pheno menal gains as his. Still less should they ■bare left Sims Reeves at the age of 76 a beggar, obliged to beg from Australians, who have never even heard him sing. \- The hospitable AucklandeiS who drove Mark Twain and Mrs. Clemens to the top of Mount Eden, and displayed before their eyes aO. the bicbiresque beauties of the Waitemata without extracting from the great humorist as much as a single word, ot even the ghost of a smile, will sympa thise with the .waiter in a story now cur rent. According to this yarn Mark at one time was in the habit of lunching in a res taurant in New York, pretty far uptown, and away from the madding crowd. A lady who lived in one of the flats above the iestaurant, meeting him just as he was coming away from lunch, spoke to him for a-few minutes. Later on, when she her self was havfaie lunch, the waiter asked her to tell him "oie" name of the gfentleman with Whom she lad been -speaking. He said he -wanted to know because he was the eaddfist-iooking gentleman he had ever aeen.'
