\- - l~ A QUEER STORY, About three o'clock in the morning, as a man was passing down Athol-road, Sunderland, in the Hendon district, he saw. a complete outfit of clothing hanging on some railings. He thought it a rather strange circumstance, and, being an honest man, he informedthe police at the Hendon Police Station, and they fetched the clothes. It was a good suit, and in the pockets was discovered a watch and other articles, but in money there was only one half-penny. The suit was brought to the Central Police Station, and during the morning a young man, 10 or 20 years of age, came up and claimed them, and they were handed over to him. He. could give no account of how the clcthes came to be in Athol-streoet. All he knows is that the only article of attire he brought home was his walking-stick. There is no doubt, however, that owing to the heat or some other cause he undressed himself in Athol-street, and hung his clothes, as he thought, on the pegs in his bedroom. Then he must have walked home. The wonder is that he was not seen by someone, because a man attired in a walking.stick is not usually seen in the street. Perhaps he was noticed by some belated individual,' for he had to walk nearly half a mile to his house. If so, they would probably have mistaken him for a ghost, or thought that it was Venus-or, more correctly, Adonis-out for a transit, and there is just the possi bility that if anyone did see him the ob. server's condition did not permit him to be dogmatic on anything connected with vision. Anyhow, it is surely one of the funniest things that has occurred in Sun derland lately.
