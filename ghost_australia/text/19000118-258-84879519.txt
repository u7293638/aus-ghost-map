Some of the Ztdu chiefs,' and also the missionary sta tions in Zululand, have large trains of raggims. and during tlie Zulu war, the British Government found the loyal chief extremely useful for the assistance they rendered in connection with transport. John Dunn, a Scotchman; who bad rte?i. to being a Zulu chief, and who iahieU died, had no immense number of waggons, and his dan. at least I mean tribe; witt protably follow In Hie footsteps of thi: unowned Bard^s* iaddie. and ^render ithf BriLi>ii army every a&^iiLce in their power.
