THE DEVON. All is going well in the Devon. The news of Mr. Charles Meredith's defeat at Glamorgan was received there with rapturous delight. Mr. Davies had held three meetings in the district up to Thursday last, and was to hold a fourth at Torquay on Friday, at which four hundred electors were expected to be present. At all the former meetings, the feeling had been unanimously and enthusiastically in Mr. Davies's favor. Neither Mr. Field, nor any other man, would stand the ghost of a chance against him. If Mr. Field goes to the poll which it is now almost certain he will not, Mr. Davies and his friends expect to poll seven to his one. What a chance Mr. Miller would have had, if he had gone there He might have " bled for his country again, but that would have been all. The return to the writ for the Devon is, we observe, postponed from the 1st to the 6th of November, That will give I ministers another week's salary.
