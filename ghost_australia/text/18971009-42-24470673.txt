The Storyteller. The Christian. THIRD BOOK.—THE DEVIL'S ACRE. X.—(Continued.) BY HALL CAINE, Author of "The Manxman." Somebody was coughing loudly in the hall as John stepped downstairs. It was the archdeacon coming in. "Ah!" he exclaimed with a flourish of the hand, greeting John as If they had part* ed yesterday and on the best of term* tl'es, there had been changes, and he was promoted to a sphere of higher useful ness. True, his good friends had looked for something still higher, but it was the premier archdeaconry at all events; and In the Church, as In life generally, the spirit of compromise ruled every thing. He asked what John was doing1, and on being told, he solid with a some what more worldly adr, " Be carvful, my dear Storm ; don't encourage vice. For my part I am tired of the fallen sister. To tell you the truth, I deny the uauio. Tl.o pa!nted Jezebel of the Piccadilly, pavement is no sister of mine." " We don't cnoose our relations, Arctf fleacon," said John. •' If God is our Father, then all men are our brothers, and aIJ women are our sisters, whether: we like It or not." "Ah ! The same man still, I see. But tvo will not quarrel about words. Seen tha dear First Lord lately ? Not very lately ? Ah, well"—with a superior smile—" the air of Downring-street-Mt's so bad for the memory, they say,' and oouphins loudly again, be stepped up stairs. Johi Storm went home that day light handed but with a heavy heart. " Begging 1s an ill-trade on a fast day, laddie," saild Mrs. Callender. " Sit you down and tak' some dinner." " How dare these people pray, * Our Father which art dn heaven 2' It's blasphemy ! It's deceit!" " Ay, and they would deceive God. abouftheir dividends if He couldn't see into their safes." " Their money ds the meanest thing leaven gives them. If I asked them for their health or their happiness, Lord God, what would they say ?". On the Sunday night following John Storm preached to an overflowing con gregation from the text, "This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth and honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me." But a few weeks afterwards bfs face ;was brjght and his voice was cheery, and he was writing another letter to Glory. "In full swing at lnst, Glory. To carry out my new idea I bad to get tbree thousand pounds more of my mother's money from my uncle. He gave dt up cheerfully, only saying he was curious to see what approach to the Christian ideffl- 'the situation" of civilisation per mitted. But Mrs. Callouder is dour, and every time I spend sixpence of my own money on the church she utters wdther iug sarcasms about being only a ' daft .tiuid w.onian herself,' and then I have to caress lind coax her. •The newspapers were facetious about ray ' Baby Houses' until they Bcented the Prime Minister at the back of them, and now they call them the 'Storm Shelters,' and christen my nightly pro cessions 'The Whitecross Army.' Even the archdeacon has begun to tell the world how he ' took an interest' in me tvoru the first and gave me my title. I met him agallu the other day at a nlch woman's house, where we had only one little spar, and yesterday he wrote urg ing me to 'organise my great effort,' and have a public dinner in honour of its inauguration. I did not think God's work could well be done by people din ing in herds and drinking bottles of champagne, but I showed no maHce. In fact, 1 agreed to hold a meeting in the lady's drawing-room, to which clergy men,- laymen, and members of all de nominations are being invited, for this Is a cause that rises above all differences of dogma, and I intend to try what can be done towards a union of Christen dom on a social basis. Mrs. Callender tts dour on that subject, too, reminding ime that where the carcass is there will the eagles be (gathered together. The archdeacon thinks we .must have the meeting before the 12th of August, or not until after the middle of Septenv "ber, and Mrs. Cullender understands this to mean that Christianity always goes to sleep in the grouse season. \- "Meantime my -G4rltf Olub goes like a forest fire. We are In our renovated clergy-house at last, and have every thing comfortable. Two ttoundred mem bers already, chiefly dressmakers and tailors, and girls out of t;he jam and match factories. Tine bright, -merry, young thing's, rejoicing in their brief blossoming time between girlhood and womanhood, I love to <be among them, and to look at their gUlatenlng eyes!

On the day of the drawing-room meet ing a large company gathered in tine hall at Belgrave-equare. Mercy Maekray, now Lady Robert Ure, ba'ek from the honeymoon, received tine guests for her another; whose weak heart and a head adhe kept her upstairs. Her husband stood aside, <dhewing the end of ttite mouetadhe, and looking through bib eyeglass with a gleam of amused In terest In ilia glittering eye. There were many ladles, ell fashionably dressed, and one of them wore a sea igull's wing In her Imt, witfh part of the root left visible and painted red to show that it had been torn out of the living bird. The men were nearly all clergymen, and the cut of their cloth and the fashions of their tics Indicated the various complexions of their creeds. They glanced at each other with looks of embarrassment, and Mrs. Callender, who came in like a breeze off a Scottish moor, said audibly that she had never seen "sac many crows on one tree be fore." The archdeacon was there with his head up, talking loudly to Lady Robert. She stood motionless in her place, never turning her eyes towards John Storm, though it was plain that she was looking at him constantly. More than once he caught nn expression of pala in her face, and felt pity for her as one of the brides who had acted the lie of marrying without love. But his spirits were high. He welcomed everybody, and even bantered Mm Cal lender when she told him she "ob jected to the hale thing," and said, ■ M Weel, weel, bide ye a wee." The archdeacon gave the signal, and led the way with Lady Robert to the drawing-room, where Mrs. Mackray, redolent of perfume, was reclining on a sofa with the " lady poodle" by her side. A& soon as the company were seated the archdeacon rose and coughed loudly. "Ladies and gentlemen," he said, " we have no assurance of a blessing except ' Aak and ye shall receive.' Therefore, before we go farther, it is our duty, as brethren of a common family iv Christ, to ask the bleesing of Almighty God on this enterprise." Thero was a subdued rustle of droop ing hats and bonnets, when suddenly a thin voice was heard to say, "Mr, Archdeacon, may I inquire first who ia to ask the blessing ?" " I thought of doing so myself," said the archdeacon with a lofty smile. "In that case, as a Unitarian, I must object to an invocation in which 1 do not believe." " Well, if the name of our Lord Is a stumbling block to our Unitarian broth er, no doubt the prayer in thid instance would be acceptable without the cus tomary Christian benediction." "That's just like you,"'said a large man near the door with whiskers all round his face. " You've been trimming and compromising all your life, end now you are going to trim away the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." " If our Low Church brother thinks he can do better I ehall be happy to re sign the duty in his favour," said the archdeacon. '• But, sir," said another voice, " I. ob ject to both of you. Being a Catholic priest, and therefore the only clergy man present whose ordination is valid, I decline to sit here and be superseded in the sacred office by any layman." There was a half-suppressed titter from the wall at the back, where Lord Robert Ure was standing with his faca screwed up his eyeglass. But the Uni tarian had risen again. " May I," he eaid suavely, "as the first cause of this unhappy difference, pour oil on the troubled waters ? I propose that the venerable archdeacon be requested to repeat the Lord's prayer—l think that will be- unobjectionable to the re« presentatives of all Christian denomina tions." A murmur of relief was passing over the company, when a bushy-bearded man rose and said, " As an Agnostic, I must object to the Lord's prayer, the very'flrst clause of it being beyond all possibility of human knowledge." Then there was blank dismay, and Lord Robert's face seemed to be crack ing under his moustache from ear to ear. „ John Storm had looked Icy cold, though the twitching of his lower lip ehowed that he was red hot within. *' Ladies and gentlemen," be said In a quavering voioe, " I apologise for bring' Ing you together. I thought if we wero In earnest about the union of Christen dom we might at least unite in the real contest with evil! But I find it Is a dream ; we have only been trifling with ourselves, and there is not one of .us who wants the union of Christendom, except on the condition that his rod shall be like Aaron's rod which swallowed up all the rest. It was a mistake, and I beg your pardon." 44 Yes, sir," said the archdeacon, " it -was a mistake ; and if you had taken my advice from the flret, and asked the blessing of Ood through good High Churchmen alone " "God doesn't wait for any asking," eaid John, now .flushing up to the eyea " He gives freely to High Churchmen, Low Churchmen, and no churchmen alike." " If that Is your opinion, sir, you are no better than your friend the Agnostic there, and for my part I will never darken your door again !" " Darken is a good word for It, arch deacon," said John, and with that the company broke up. iMre. Mackray looked like a thun der-cloud as John bowed to her on passing out, but Mrs. Cal lender cried in a jubilant voice, "Be captain of your own ship, laddie!" and ndMed (ibeing two yard* ibcihind the ATdhdeacon's Tbroad back going down the staina), " If that 'deacon, man, is to be an Inheritor of the kingdom of heaven thereil be a m-iehty crush at the pearly gates, I'm thinking I" John Storm went back to Soho with a theavy heart. Going up Vlctoria street ho passed a; crowd of ragged people who were ploughing their way through the carriages. Two policemen were taking a man and a woman to the police court in Rochester Row. The prisoners were Sharkey, the keeper of the gambling-bouse, and his wife, tine tmtoy-farmer. Bnt within «. week John Storm, In greater spirits than ever, was writing to Glory again. "The archdeacon! hai» deserted me, Tyut no matter ! My uncle has advanc ed me another thousand of my imotiher'o money, so the crusade Is self-support- Ing In one cense, at vM events. You trould be amused to see how tihe women of the West End are taking it up—Lady Robert Ure among the rest 1 They have banded themselves into a sister hood, and christened our clergy-house a 'Settlement.' One of my Greek owners came in the other evening* to see the alterations. Hto eyes glisten ed at the change, and he asked leave to •bring a friend. I trust you are well and settling -things comfortably, and fbat Miss Macquarrie has gone. It id raining through a coTander here, but I (have no time to think of depressing weather. Sometimes when I cross our great squares, where the Ibirds slog among the yellowing leaves, my mind goes off to your sweet (home- la the fitrasJhino ; and wlhen I drop Into Hhe dark alleys and lanes, wlhere flic pole faced children play la their poverty and; rags, 1 think of a day that 1«* coming, and, God willing, to now co near, -when a ministering angel of tenderness and strengtih will be passing through them like a gleam. But lam more than erer sure that you do well to avoid for the present the pompons joys of life In .London, where for one ihappy ibeSng there are a 'thousand pretenders to haippiness." On lihe Sunday night following, Crook-lane, outside the dergy-thouee, was afltnost blocked with noisy people of botfli eexes. They were a detaehr •ment o? the "Skeletons," and the talk among tkeni was of fhe trial of the Sharkeys, 'wihidh. had taken place the dny before. " They've 'ed six months," said one. " And it's all along o' mm« jee parsons," said another ; and Charlie W likes, -who h-ad a certain reputation for humour, did a step-dance, and eang some doggerel, "beginaiing : " Father Storm is a werry good man, . 'E does you all tho 'arm 'c can." Throny'li this crowd two gentlemen pushed their -way to tho clergyJhouse, which was 'brilliantly lit up. One of •them was the Greek owner, the other was Lord Robert Ure. Entering a large room on the ground, floor, tlhey first came upon John Storm, to cassock and blretta, standing at tho door and Shak ing hands with everybody wilio came in !and went out. He betrayed no sur prise, but greeted them respectfully, and 'then paaised them on. Every moment of his time was occupied. The room was full of the young gdrte of tho dlj* trict, wltih here and there a Sister out of another world entirely. Same were reading, some ooffversiinig, some laugh. -Ihg, some playing a piano, and some slniging. Their voices filled the air like the chirping of birds, and their ■fakjes were .bright and happy. "Good evening, Father," tfhey said on entering, and "Good night, Father," ua they went away. The two men stood some minutes and: looked round at the room. It was pbj> served that Lord Robert did not re move his hat. He kept chewing the end of a decrepit cigarette, whereof the other end hung down his chin. One of the sisters heard Mm say, "It will do with a little alteration, I think."! Then he went off alone, and the Greek owner stepped up to John Storm. It was not at first that John could attend to Mm, and wlhen he was able to do so he began to rattle on about this own affaire. " See," he aaid with a de lighted smile and ft wave of the arm, " see how crowded we are I We'll have to think of taking in the next door soon." "Father Storm," said the Greek, "I have something serious to «ay, tihouglbi the official notification wHI of course roach you toy another channel." John's face darkened as a ripe corn field does when the sun dies away from It. .'• " I am sorry to tell you tihat the true> tees, having had a favourable offer for thks property " " Well ?" His great staring eyes bad stopped the man, » have decided to sell." ' "Sell? Did you say se-—? To whom ? . . . What ?" •• To tell you the truth, to the syndi cate of a nn/usSc hall." '. Jdhn staggered iback, "breathing audibly. "Now if a man had to be lieve that ... Do you know if I thought such a. -thing could "happen " " I'm sorry you take the matter so seriously, Father Storm.

Do you suppose I'm -thinking of that, and not of the desecration, the outrage, the horror ? But who are they ? Is that manr- Lord ** The Greek had nodded his head, and John flung open the door. "Out of -tin-is ! Out of ft, you Judas!" And almost before the Greek had crossed* the threshold the door was banged at; his back. ' v The incident (had been dbserved, and there was dead silence In the cluib room, but John only cried, " Let's sing something, frirls," and when a sister struck -up his favourite "Nazaretfo," there was no voice so loud as his vofltoe. But he toad realised everything. "Gloria," ttos coondng "back, and tne work of months was overtfcrown ! When he was going home groups of the girls were talking In whispers to the hall, and Mra. Plncher, who wa» wiping her eyes at tlhe door, said, " I wander you don't drown yourself, I do." i At tlhe corner of the lane Mr. Jupe ■was waiting for him to beg his pardon, and to ask hU advice. What he had said of Mrs. Jupe had turned out to be true. The Sharkeys had "split" on her, and she had been •arrested. "It •was all in the evoivin' pipers l««t nigiht," the weak <creatr»e whimperedV "and to-day my manager 'told me I fed, 'best look oat for «w>tiher f plaoa. Ob, my poor Lidjer I What am Ito do?" •" Do ? Out her off like a rotten limb !" said Joihn eeoiuxfuMy, and witlx Ittmt lie strode down the street. Tbe banian sea roared around hfcm, and toe felt as if [he wanted to fling (himself Into the midst of it, and be swallowed ■up. Poor champion of women, • thrown down and trodden on toy the yery iwoman in whose name lie Ivad worked ! On reaching Victoria-square he told Mrs. Callendor the news—flung it out at her with a soil of triumphant shout. Kis church had been sold over his head, and being only " Chaplain to tho Greek-Turks," he was to be turned Into the streets. -Then be laughed wildly, and by §ome devilish impulse began to abuse Glory. " The next chaplain is to be a girl," he cried, "one of those creatures wlio live by their looks and throw kisses at gaping crowds, anil sweep curtsies for their dirty crusts !" But all *it onco he turned white as a ghost, and sat down trembling. Mrs. Calender's face was twitching, and to ijrevont herself from crying she burst into scorching satire. " There !" she said, sitting in her rocking-chair and rocking herself furiously, " I ken'd weel •what it would come til! Adversity wink's a tnau wise, they say, if it doesna male' hlnj rich. But it's the Prime Min ister I blame for this. The aliid dolt! he must be fallen to hie dotage. It's enough to niak' a reasonable body go out of her mind to think of sic wise asses. I told you what to expect, but you were al»rys inlsealllug me for a suspicious auld woman. Oh, it's a thing ye'd no suspect; but Jane Callendor Is only p. daft mild fool, ye see, and. doesna ken what she's saying !" But at the next moment she had jumped up and flung her arms About John's neck, and was crying over him like a girl. "Oh my son ! my am son ! And is it for one to ttlng out at ye ? Ay, ay, it's a- heartless world, laddie !" He kissed the old woman, and then she tried to coax him to eat. " Come, come, a wee bltee, just a wee bitee! tWe must eat our supper anyway." "God seems dead and heaven a I6ng ■way off !" lie murmured. • "And a drap o' whisky will do no "barm—a wee drapee !" "There's only one thing clear—God sees I'm unfit for the work, so He lute taken It away from me." She turned aside from the table, and tho supper was left untouched. The first post next morning brought a letter from Glory. " The Garden House, " Clement's Inn, W.C. "forgive me! I have returned to town 1 I couldn't help it, I couldn't, I couldn't! London dragged me back. What was I to do after everything was settled and tho auntie* provided for ?— assist in a dame's school and wage war with pothooks and hangers ? Oh !

You'ti iflnd me hero at Rosa's. Come, come, come! I*ll never forgive you if you don't come soon—never, never ! " Glory." XII. A fortnight had passed, and John Storm bad not yet visited CHory. Never theless he had heard of her from day to day by the medium of the news papers. Rvery mornjng he had glanced down the black columns for the name that stood out from them as if its let ters had been printed Jn blood. The (reports had been many and mysterious. (First, the brilliant young artist, who 'had made such an extraordinary im pression some months before, had re turned to London, and would shortly Resume the promising career which had tbeea interrupted by illne?« and family fbereavement. Next, the forthcoming (appearance would be ou the regular stage, and In a Shakspearlan character, (which was always understood to be a crucial test of histrionic genius. Then .the revival of "Romeo and Juliet," iwhiCh had formerly fJteen in contempla tion, would probably give way to the ■till more ambitious project of an en fthrejy new production by a well-known Scandinavian author, with a part pe culiarily fitted to the personality and talents of the debutant. Finally, a ejrncUoate >cwas 4bout j to •be formed jftHr the >purehaae of- some old prdpivty,' • with a. view to its roconatruotfou a* a theatre, iv the interests of the new play and the new playen • John Storm laughed bitterly. He toM himself that Glory was unworthy of the least of his thoughts. It waa bis duty to go on with his work and think of her no more. He had received his official notice to quit. The church was to be given up lv a month, the clergy-house in two months, and he believed himself to be immersed in preparations lor the re housing of the club and home. Twenty young, mothers and their children now lived in the upper rooms, uuder obedi ence to the sisterhood, but Polly's boy had remained with Mrs. Pincher. From time to time he had seen the little one tethered to a chair by a scarf about its waist, creeping by the wall to the door, and there gazing out on' the world with looks of Intelligence, ami babbling to it in various inarticulate noises. The little dark face had the eyes of its mother, but it represented ttlory for all that. John Storm loved to see it. He felt that he could never part with It, aud that if Lord Robert Urc liimself came and asked for it lie would bundle him out of doors. " 800-100 ! Lal-la ! Mum-um !" As he passed up the' lane he stopped at the pawnshop door and kissed the little lips as they prattled and curled, and then kissed them ngaln as they drooped and fell, und something darkened the little extstenoe. But a carriage drew up at Mrs. Calen der's one morning, and Lady Robert lire stooped out. Her pale anU patient face hod the feeble and nervous smile of the humiliated and unloved. " Mr. Storm," she said in her gentle voice, " I have come on a delicate er rand. I cannot delay any longer a duty I ought to have discharged before." It was about Polly's baby. She had heard of what had happened at the hos pital ; and the newspapers which had followed her to Paris, with reports of her wedding, had contained reports of the girl's death, ateo. Since her return she had inquired about the child, and discovered that it had been rescued by him, and was now in his careful keep ing. "But it Is for me to look after -it. Mr. Storm, and I beg of you to #ive it up to me.- Bomethis*Lt«Hs me that God-will never give me. any children of my own, so 1 shall be doing no harm to any one, and my husband need never know whose child it is I adopt. I promise you to be good to It. It shall never leave me. And if it should live to be n man, and grow to love me, that will help me to forget the past, and to for give myself for my own share in it. Oh, it is little I can do for the poor girl who is gone—for after all she loved him and I took him from her. But this is my duty, Miv Storm, ami I cannot sleep at night or rest in the day until it Is begun/.' V I don't know if 4t.is your duty, dear lady, but if you wish for the child It is your right," said John Storm, and they got into the carriage and drove to Soho. " 800-100 ! liA-la ! Mum-um!" The child was tethered to the chair as usual and talking to the world according to its wont. - When it was gone, and the women on the doorsteps could see no more of the fine carriage of the great lady who had brought the odour of perfume and the rustle of silk into the dingy court, and Mrs. PJneher had turned back to the house with red eyes and her widow's cap awry, John Storm told himself that everything was for the best The last link with Glory was broken ! Thank God for that! He might go on with his work now and need think of her no more !•:.•?■ • That day he called at Clement's Inn. The Garden House was a pleasant dwelling, fronting oh two of its sides to the garden of the ancient Inn of Court, and cosily furnished with many curtains and rugs. The Cockney maid who answered the door was familiar in a moment, and during the short passage from the hall to the floor above she communicated many thingsl. Her name was Liza. She had heard htm preach ; he had made her cry, " Mies Gloria" liad known her former mistress, and Mr. Drake had got her the present place. There was a sound of laughter from the drawing-room.. It was Glory's voice. When the door opened she was standing in the .middle ot the floor In a black dress and with a pale face, but her ey«s were" bright and she was laugh ing merrily. She stopped when John Storm entered, and looked confused and ashamed. Drake, who was lounging on the couch, rose and bowed to him, and Miss Macqnarrle, who was correcting long slips of printers' proofs at a desk by the window, came forward and wel comed him; Glory .held his hand with her long band-clasp and looked stead fastly intd his eyes. His face twitched and her own blushed deeply, aud then She talked in a nervous and jerky way, reproaching him for his neglect of her. " I have been busy," he began, and then stopped with a sense of hypocrisy. " I mean worried and tormented," and then stopped again, for Drake had dropped bis liead. She lauj*fdi toomh &&**&*** noth ing to laugh at, and-proposed tea, rat tling along In broken sentences that were spoken with a freniulous trill, which had a suggestion of tears behind it " Shall I ring for tea, Rosa ? Oh, yon have rung for tea J Ah, here it comes ! Thank you, Liza. -Bet it hero," seating herself. " Now, who says the ' girl' V Remember ?" and then more laughter. At that moment there was another arrival. It was Lord Robert Ure. He kißsed Rosa's hand, smiled on 'Glory, saluted Drake familiarly, and then set tled himself on a low stool by the tea table, pulled up the knees of his trous ers, relaxed the congested muscles of one-half of his face, and let fall his eyeglass. Drake was handbag out the cups as Glory filled them. He was looking at her attentively, vexed at the change in her manner since John Storm entered. When he returned to his seat on the sofa, he began to twitch the ear of her pug, which lay coiled up asleep beside him, calling it an ugly little pestilence, and wondering why she carried it about with her. Glory pro tested that it was an angel of a dog, whereupon he supposed it was now dreaming of paradise — listen !—and then there w«re audible snores in the •silence, and everybody laughed, and Glory screamed. " I declare on my honour, my dear," satd. Drake with a mischievous look at John, " the creature Is uglier than the beast that did the business ou the day we eloped." " Eloped!" cried Rosa and Lord Robert, together. " Why* did you never hear that Glory eloped with me ?" Glory was trying to drown his voice with hollow laughter. " She was 7 and I was 6%, and she had proposed to me In the orchard the day before !" " Anybody have more ten ? No ? Some sally-lunn, perhaps ?" and then more laughter. " Hold your tongue, Glory ! Nobody wants your tea.! Let us hear the story." said Rosa. "Why, yes, certainly," said Lord Robert, aud everybody laughed again. "She was all.fov travel and triumph al processions In those days " Gtory" stopped her ears, aud began to sing: . Willy, Willy Wllkin, . Kissed tbe maid a-milkin' Fa, la, la ! "There were so many things people could do if they wouldn't waste bo much time working : Willy, Willy Wilkin, Kissed the-maid " " Glory, if you don't be quiet we1 * turn you oiit!" and Rosa got up and flourished her proofs. " I had brought my pug, and when I called her a " But Glory had leapt to her feet and fled from the room. Drake had leapt up also, and now putting his back against the door, he raised his voice and went on with his story. " Somebody saved us, though," and she lay in his arms and kissed him all the way homo again. Glory was gtrummlug on the door and singing to drown his voice. When the story was ended and she was allowed to come back ehe was panting and gasping with laughter, but there were tears in her eyes for all that, and Lord Robert was saying, with a sidelong look to wards John Storm, "Really, this ought to be a scene In the new 'Slgurdsen,' don't you know !" ' John had retired within himself dur ing this nonsense. He had been feeling an intense hatred of the two men, and was looking as gloomy aa deep water. " All acting, sheer acting," he thought, and then he told himself that Glory was only worthy of his contempt. What could attract her in the society of such men ? Only their wealth, their social station. Their intellectual and moral atmosphere must weary and revolt her. Roea had to go to her newspaper office, and Drake saw her to the door. John rose at the same time, and Glory said, " Going already ?" but she did not try to detain him. She would see him again ; she had much to say to him. "I suppose you were surprised to hear that I had returned to London ?" she eald, looking up at his knitted brows. He did not answer immediately, and Lord Robert, who was leaning Against tlii) chimneyptece, said In bis cold drawl, " Your friend ought to be happy that you have returned to London, seems to me, my dear, Instead of wast ing your life in that wilderness." John drew himself up. Hfs pride was wounded by the light tone of the man's familiarity. " It's not London I object to," he said ; "that was inevitable, I dare say.'^ " What then T " The profession she has come back to follow." " Why. what'? amir* with the pro fession ?" said Lord Robert, aud Drake, who rctPi'Ded to the room at the mo ment, said, " Yes, what's amiss with it ? Some of the best men lv the world have belonged to It, I think." " Tell me the name of one of them, since the world began, who ere*.lked on active Christian life." • Lord Rdbert 1' made a tdtnk of laughter* and, turning to the window, began to play a tune with his finger tipß on the1 glass. DTRke straggled to keep ft straight face, and answered, " It is not their role, sir." ' Very well, if that's too much to ask, tell me how many of them hare done anything in real life, anything for the world, for humanity—anything m hatever. I don't caa-e what it is." "You nro unreasonable, sir," said Drake,- " and such objections could as properly apply to the professions of the painter and the musician. /These are the- children of joy. Their first func tion is to amuse. And surely amuse ment has its place in real life, as you N\y." "On the contrary," said John, follow ing Irfs own thought, for lie had nr>t listened. " how many of them have lived lives of reckless abandonment, self-indulgence, and *yen scandalous license." " Those are abuses that apply equally to other professions, sir. Even the Church is not free from them. But In the view of reasonable beings one clergyman of evil l»fe—-nay, one hun dred, would not make the profession of the clergy bad." V A profession." said John, " which appeals above all to the senses, and lives on the emotions, and fosters jeal ousy.l and vanity, and backbiting, and develops duplicity, and exists on lieg; and does nothing to encourage self sacrifice, or to help suffering humanity, Js r» bad profession and a sinful one !" "If a profession is sinful," said Drake, "in degree as It appeals to the senses, and lives on tho emotions, and develops dnnUc'ty. tbon the profession of the Church is the most sinful iv the world, for it offers the greatest tempta tions to lying, and produces the worst hypocrites and impostors !" " That." said John, with flashing eyes and passion vibrating in his voice, <: that, sir, is the great liar's everlasting lie—and you know it J" -Glory was between them with upr I'ftfxT hands. " Pence, peace ! Blessed is the peacemaker! But. tea! Will nobody take more tea ? Oh, debar! oh, d»>ar! Why can't we have tea over agalu ?" " I know what you mean. s!r," satd Drake. " You mean that I have Itrvratrht Glory baclfto a life of danger and van ity, and sloth and sensuality. Very well. I deny jour definition. But call it what you will, I have brought h« 1 nek to the only life her talents nre fit for, and if that's all " " Would you have done the same for your own sister ?" *' But how dare you Introduce my sister's name In this connection !" " And how dare you resent it ? What's good for one woman is good for another." * Glory was turning aside, and Drake was looking ashamed. "Of course naturally—all I meant." he faltered, •' if a girl has to earn her living, what ever her talents, her genius—that is one thing. But the upper classes, I menn the leisured clnßses " " Damn the leisured classes, sir!" said John, and in 'the silence that fol lowed the men looked round, but Glory was gone from the room. * Lord Robert, who had been whistling at the wiudow. said to Drake in a cynical undertone. " The man is hip ped and sore. He hns lost his chal lenge, and;, we ought to make allow ances for liini; don't you know." Drake tried to laugh. " I'm willing to make allowances," he said lightly ; "but when a man talks to me as if— as if I meant to . . . " but the light tone broke down, and he faced round upon John and burst out pas* * slonately, "What right have yon to' talk to me like this ? What is there to my character, in my life, that justifies it ? What woman's honour have I be trayed ? What have I done that Is unworthy of the character of an Eng lish gentleman ?" John took a stride forward, and came face to face and eye to eye with him. "What have you done?" he said. " You have used, a woman as your decoy to win your challenge, as you soy, and you have struck me dn the face with the hand of the woman I love. That's what you've done, sir, and df it's worthy of the character or an English gentleman,' then God help England !" \- Drake put his hand to his head and Ills flushed face turned pale. But Lord Rdbert Ure stepped forward, and eaid with a oiulle,." Well, and If you're lost your dhurcli, -so nnidh t!he better* You are only on outsider in the ecele eiaatieal «tud nnyway. Who wnnta you ? Your rector doesn't want you ; your Bi&hop; doesn't want you. Notwdy, wants you, if you ask me." "I don't ask you, "Lord Robert," aald John. " But there's somebody who does want me for all that. Shall I tell you who it te ? It's the poor and fhelp less girl who lias been deceived by the base and selflcAi man. and then left to fight the battle of life alone, or to die by suicide, nttd go dhuddeaing- down to bell!

Drake— ".what do xeu think has happened ?, My wife Las fallen under tliis gentle man's influence—the poor simpleton ■!— and not ore hour before I left my house £l>e brought home a child which ,he had given her to adopt Think of it !— out of the shambles of Soho, and God knows whose brat and bastard !" The words were hardly out of the man's mouth when John Storm had tHkvn him by both shoulders. " God does know," he said, " and so do I. Shall I tell you whose child that is ? Shall I ? It's yours I" The man saw it coming, and turned white as a ghost " Yours ! and your wife has taken up the burden of your sin and shame, for jibe's a good woman, and you are not fit to live on the earth she walks upon i" He left the two men speechless and wnt heavily down the stairs. Glory was waiting for him at the door. Her eyes were glistening after recent teats. " You will come no more ?" she said. She could read him like a book. MI cou see that you intend to come no more. jHe did not deny it, and after a mo ment she opened the door and he passed out with a look of utter weariness. Then she went back to her room and flung herself on the bed, face, down wards. * The men in the drawling-room were beginning to recover themselves. Lord Robert was humming a tune, Drake pacing to and fro. " Ruying up his church to moke a theatre for Glory was the very refine ment of cruelty !" said Drake. " Good heavens ! what possessed me ?" "Original sin, dear boy !" sadd Lord Robert with a curl of tbe lip. 44 A bad plagiarism, you mean !" said Drake bitterly. " Very well. If I helped you to do It, shall I help you to give it up ? With draw the prospectus and return the deposits on shares—the dear arch deacon's among the rest." Drake took up his hat and left the house. Lord Robert followed him pres ently. Then the drawing-room was empty, and the hollow sound of sobbing came down to It from the bedroom above. Father Storm sadd prayers in church that night with a hard and absent heart. A terrible Impulse of hate had taken hold c£ him. He bated Drake, he hated Glory, he hntcd himself most of all, and felt as if seven devils had taken possession of him, and he jvas a hypocrite, and might fall dead at the altar. "But what a fate the Almighty has saved me from !" sic thought. Glory would have been a drag on his work for life. He must forget her. She was only worthy of his contempt. Yet he could not help but remember how beau tiful she had looked in her mourning dress, and with that pure pale face and its signs of suffering ! Or how charm- Sttg she bod seemed to him even in the midst of all that deception ! Or how she had held him as by a spell! Going home he came upon a group of men in tlie court One cf them plant ed himself full in front, and said with an insolent swagger, "Me and my mites thinks there's too many. parsons abort 'ere. What do you think, air ?" " I think there are more gamblers and thieves, my lad," he answered, and at tbe next Instant the man had struck him in the face. He closed with the rnfflan., grappled him by the throat, and fluqg him on his back. One mo ment he held him there, wydthing and gasping, then he said, " Get up, and get off, and let me see no more of you*" " No, sir. not this time," said a voice above his back. The crowd bad melted away, and a policeman stood beside them. " I've been waiting for this one for weeks, father," he said, and he marched the man to gaoL it was Charlie Wilkes. At the tidal of Mrs. Jupe that morning, Aggie, be ing a witness, had been required to mention hiis name. It was all in the evening papers, and he bad been dis missed from his time-keeping at tbe foundry. (To t>e continued.)

"I .reckoned- I'd done about,enough for glory to that, line, and was- just starting away over the veld south-west to £ut the Lichtenberg line, when I heard the clatter of hoofs on gravel, and, looking along the. skyline, saw some moving forms just topping.the iidge between me and tUe Zeerust road. T!hat was Quito good enough for me ; 1 didn't stop to investigate, but seat the spurs dioine, and my old nag, which had liad a good spell and pick at tiie grass while I was working, spluttered off down the liilll, sending the stones flying, to the dark shadow at its foot, where a deep spruit ran along on its course to the Marico River. How we ever got down that hill in the dark over the rocks and gullies I don't know ; the wind fairly whistled in my' ears as we pelted along. We stopped In the donga, and I looked back for the pur suers. They were lost, liowever; no doubt they were carefully .picking-their way down the krantz. ; " Anyhow, they ihad seen what I was up to, and it was 'high time to trek out of that, 80 I set the mare going, and plugged away through the bush and rocks along the spruit towards the J-iichtenberg line, whidh I judged was o;bout ton ■miles away to the south west. After about a mile along the creek, we left the bash, and struck out across the 'bare, high veld. "On the top of the watershed we stopped and listened for signs of pur suit, bait there was no sound but the of a jackall, coaming faintly down the cool breeze. " Away we galloped over the veld ; the country all around, -bright lit by the summer moon, reflected again from the white grass and quartz pebbles. Now and then fhere'd 'bo a scuffle and a splutter as a startled duiker or etem buck sprang from its lair, and lit out rustle of the wind in the long, dry grass, and the distant yapping snarls for its natural, scared by being nearly run over, and ortee the old mare shied half-way across' tbe Transvaal as a great,'gray, ghosffly secretary-bird rose from where lie had been lying, .and after a few preliminary stride* with (his derned long legs, and swooshes of his wings, rose and flapped off through the night. " I saw a couple of farms, and kept clear and wide of them to avoid dis turbing the doge, and before half-past 2 reached the wire and commenced operations. "The posts here were all galvanised Iron, and I had to otimb up, and having smashed the insulator, endeavour to cut the wire against the top of the post with my axe. "To understand how things happen ed, I must tell you that just where I had thit toe wire, there was a long tongue of bush came down from a kopje on the.east towards Lidhtenberg, and towards Zeerust the ground ran sharply away to a thick patch of thorn "bosh; below that again ran a deep kloof full of camel-thorn trees, which. continued up tbe far side, end ran patchy and thin.over the veld away in. tlio direction of Zeerust. "Well, I had made a ja<b or two at the wire with my axe, but it wasn't aU velvet, I can tell you, banging on to a thin Iron pole by any eyelids, so to speak, and chopping away with a heavy axe that wouldn't hit the darned wire straight, but slipped away to one eldo or the other at every blow, jolly nearly taking me with it. Every lift rang off along the line, making enough row to raise the dead. "At last one fell straight, and with a hissing clang the wire parted, and falling on either side of the post coiled itself away through the grass out of sight. "•Thank the Lord for that lot/ I think*, and dropping the axe 1 slid to the ground ; that is, I slid half-way, but dropped the rest, for I hadn't reached foothold When bang! bang! two shots rang out from the Lichten berg bu4b, and whang ! a bullet Ihdt the Iron post, making it. quiver again, and singing away through the night amidst the echoes of the reports travelling front hill to bill. "My horse was. tied to a.tree about twenty yards away. I don't, exactly remember how I did it, but I was in the saddle with the axe in my hand 'iv about two ups, and was off to the donga on the Zeerust side like one policeman. " Bang I Bang ! the shots flew after me again, and passed with a vicious little whizz ; 'tig a sound we don't think much of now, boys, but I didn't see any points about it that night, and bent low in the saddle as we raced into the bush. , " I had just reached the timber and kidded myself I was safe again, when there was a yell, in front, and three horses came shooting through the tim ber and pulled up across my track. Lord, how 1 remember that sight t There was one white horse, and as the beggars pulled up and levelled their Tlflef.ka&wtte; moonlight tUnton the bwwhv&nd; thought J was a«o»e oussi; .■.*.' In that moment 1 niunc hu' bane clean, jumpln' mud, for with a yell I swung the axe round my h'oua and raced straight : at .'em. Vivo tired-nmiaeed— and cleared for cover to reload: r The other man stood, and the light glinted and gleamed ap and dowu his barrel as ■he followed my horse's movement. I remember thinking; though it was all over in a second, 'He's making dead sure, 1 and at that instant Lie fired. " There was no hiss this time, but the flame «hot a warm breath over my cheek. As he tired, I loosed the axe handle, and saw Its head catch him on the jaw. We passed so fa«it thai I could see no effect; but, turning imme diately in the saddle, a riderless horse trotting into the bush, and a dark, shapeless, motionless heap in the centre of the moonlit patch amid the timber, showed the first blow of tho Jameson Raid .was struck. A moment more, and the thickening busrh hid us from sight, and loud, hoarse shouts of the baffled Boera proclaimed they were sold again by the ' Verdomde rooinek.' " I was fairly drunk with excitement, and felt incliued to turn, again and huve another dash through them for sport. ," At the bottom of the hill, all torn by thorns and bleeding at the neck where I had been either bullet-grazed or lipped by the bush, I stopped and listeued. "Up on the krantz the Dutchmen were following, shouting, and yelling, and their calls, mingled with the rat tling o<' the stones as they scuffled down the hill, showed they were following the right line. I considered a bit and decided, instead of hitting straight for the border, which was not far away, to go back to Susie's place and pick her up to take her for safety to Bechuana land. I thought the Boers must know what is up, and there'd be a battle there in the Marlco for a dtnrt, so shod be better away~; and, besides, my pur suers would probably make straight for the border, and, being fresher mounted than me, would stood a show of catch ing up on the open country that 'lay between this patch of bosh and Eng lish ground. It was no good hoping to do more to the wire, oa my axe was gwne for good, and altogether things hereabouts was getting a bit too thick ; so we trotted on, taking advantage of the cover until I couldn't-hear voices any more, then away we galloped across the veld, stopping ami listening now and agen for sound* " We parsed one farm a few hundred yard* off—Coetaee's, it was. Lights were dodging about, and men's voices calling, so I judged they had either heard the shooting or old 'Oom PauP ■had wind of what was coming, and had called out the commandos. However, they didn't see or hear me, and about 4 in the morning I wae outside Susie's window,< and she was climbing 'out tome. We went carefully to the kraal,- where the horses were; Susie's saddle was on the wall, and in five minutes she was mounted and ready. Susie, whose mother was English, or, at any rate, colonial, told me they were all asleep In the house, and would not miss her tin daylight. I jumped up, and away we went I had kept clear of Zeemst coming to the farm, and had now only to fear Malmani and the polled of the border. " The mare was still going well, and I hoped to get her 'home an right. She wm a ijphmdld bit of stuff. It was a grand gallop. I was a* (happy as Larry, tn high spirits, and felt lit for all the Dutcfhman in the district. " We eased up at M&lroanl; Cemetery, and, seeing lights flying round In the town below, Heft It wdde on the right, swimming the Mfclmnni River about Wenthaitgel farm ; thte to how we ml«s ed the 8.8.P. column, which hod readi ed Malumni, and were waiting there for Jameson aud the M.M.P. I didn't know for certain that they toad yet marched, and wouldn't go (through the tov/n on «pec, aud pYapa fetctb. np against a Boer commando, fiuaie had lost her l>at» in . the gallop, go I gave her any ipolice-'bat, with the broad brim looped up, and white puggaree, tying a hand kerchief round roy own bead-. "The mootrlhad now gone down, and at Bultfoutedn there was only a pole gttmmer from the *tars ; daylight woold be afong in half-aivboor, but. we were nearly «afe, I . caHed to Susie, 'It won't be good enough to. go tttrouffh the police at the border:; they witttoe waiting, and may possibly have seen something of the 8.8.P., if t&ejr;'ve start ed. We ihad better go down fbrongu, thte Jnwfli, aeros* the border at the back of Frlcke BotluiVß place,, and get to Cowan's farm, wtoere well tie able to get some coffee, and then take to ea«y into Mafeking.' ' Very well,' 4fae said, and we turned off the road. " Now, it Ju»t happened, wlben ihour later we reacihed ttie bonier, we fell plump on top of a crowd of Boera coming up from Rooi "Grond. They, had been eomaaondeered early in the night, and were patrol!ing t*e frontier. " Agaioet tfhe earning daylight in the east we roust have «ft»owed bl<g, awl they evidently recognised my police hat on Sueie, for there wm a -yell, awl • they hopped off their honse* «od- 9tiut«d to firing aro&y; Hke mad. .. fcord, how those show Whizzed poet us. ' Quick, separate !' says Susie ; ' you take to the river and I'll (break Into due bills Again. None of thorn can touch my horse. Good *uck !'—aaitl she was off at a pace my ■mare/, pretty weflQ knocked up by the Edghtfa work, couldn't ha' looked at. Bang ! Bairg I Wlhizz ! I deared to the loft, where, about half-a- niile a way. the Molopo nan ou irte course to MafeJtinjf, seven milea away. As «oon as we (parted the firing wias stopped, and I heard a shout. "Before crossing the border I had to dodge two more parties, 'galloping up to see what nil Che firing* was about, |but got off without being »een, reaped the river, crossed the border, and gut safe ly Into Mafeking. "I kept my teeth stout, and after Jameson and all our chaps were taken, I thought it would 'be heailthy to change my scenery dor a while, no I was very well known a<r<x.d the border, and didn't want to be tusked to explain tny reason for cutting a.bout tihe Mavico so free that night; so I came up to Mata fteleland, Joined the M.M.P., and here we are. < 41 W'heu this war's v>ver I'm goin£ to a»k the colon el or somebody for that "hundred quid (I reckon I earned it), and go back and marry Sudde. I ha-vent heard a word from 'her since, though I wrote several times, bat through thto war the mails arc always golug wrong, and iher letter must have gone astray. I She must have gat home all right. She lia'd a fre&h; 'horse, knew the veld, and rides as well as I can. She's all right. " And now, chaps, my yarn is. don© ■and we 'had befter turn In. There'll De a fight to the morning, aivd I want to dream about Susie and forget Smith's baking, and Tu-libulll beef. Good night, all." Half-an-hour afterwards Tiffin leaned over on Smith's blanket and whispered, " How'll poor Tom feel when he hears how Susie dv Toit paid with her life for wearing one of our hats, and lie* io a nameless grave, where Hlie fell shot through the heart ? Thia yarn explain* all. I never understood how the Boer patrol had killed one of their own women ; but with a police hat on, and in the faint light, who could tell she Was not a man ? I'm not going to tell him, anyhow, and all the other chaps are strangem to Mafeking, and don*l know the story. Poor old Tom 1 Good night."
