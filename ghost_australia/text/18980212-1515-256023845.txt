The: sun. glared, fierce and sullen and wrathful, and: one'* parasol hanflle. waB hot to die touch of gloved handfe. Uliose Ikdies who would persist in braving the sun's fierce rays by tripping to and from the stand and paddock, wore complexions that needed no touch of carmine before the day wasdone, for they were one brilliant blush front forehead: to»chin. The day was too warm to allow of atly. enthusiasm being shown in regard to the various events, and; even the* loss of a half crown was borne -with but languid: interest; to become vexed over one's lostes required some show of spirit, and no one possessed the strength to scold dame.

The railway officials seemed to take a fiendish pleasure in hustling people into the ramshackle pens they dignify by fbe names of carriages, and then leading them there to simmer for half an hour under the biaziqg heat, before sending the train along on its way.

One of the stewardesses of the club had a carriage all to herself. Of •course she kindly allowed hubby and the infants to occupy a seat in the corner, hut she sprtad her ample skirts over all the remaining space, and ordered the guard to lock the door lest any of the overflow from the too ^crowded cars should venture to seek tntrance, and when a stranger tathe •carious ways of Westralians politely Squired if there was room for brother in the half-empty compartiment, the haughty club officialees «aoFtedout defiantly "This carriage is resetted for the steward." *•" . ^ course there was m attempt at ^dtessi^ft As »as natural 4H>der the cir- «u«ist»nces, ladies wisely atatiwg vmmmmBj^tm Oa#ot were ' - ^Tres^ed in white ' . m A - i t o silk bows and hiffon.
