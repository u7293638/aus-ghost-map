LONG AGO. {BY HENRY HOWARD BROWNELL.] When J^sit at even alone. Thinking on the past and gone, •While the clock, with drowsy finger, Marks how long the minntes linger; And the embers dimly burning, Tell of life to dust returning; Then my lonely chair around, With a quiet mournful sound— With a murmur soft and low, Come the ghosts of long ago. One by one I count them o'er, Voices that are heard no more ; Tears that loving cheeks have wet, Words whose music lingers yet; Holy faces, pale and fair, Shadowy locks of waving hair; Happy sighs and whispers dear, Songs forgotten many a year; Lips of dewy fragrance; eyes Brighter, bluer than the skies— Odours breathed from Paradise. And the gentle shadows glide Softly murmuring at my side. Till the long unfriendly day, All forgotten, fades away. Thus, when I am all alone, Dreaming o'er the past and gone, All around me, sad and slow, Come the ghosts of long ago.
