WOODS AND FIELDS. BY SIR JOHN LUBBOCK, M.P. No. J. Rural life, says Cicero, "is not delightful by reason of cornfields only and meadows, and vineyards and groves, but also for its gardens and orchards, for the feeding of cattle, the swarms of bees, and the variety of all kinds of flowers." Bacon considered that a garden is " the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man ; without which buildings and palaces are but grass hand works, and a man shall ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegancy men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely, as if gardening were the greater perfection, and no doubt '"the pleasure which we take in a garden is one of the most innocent delights in human life." (Spectator.) Elsewhere there may be scattered flowers, or sheets of colour due to one or two species, but in gardens one glory follows another. Here are brought together all the *' quaint enamelled eyes, That on the green turf suck the honeyed show crs, And purple all the ground with vernal flowers, Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow toe, and pale jessamine, The white pink and the pansy freaked with, jet, The glowing violet, The musk rose, and the well-attired woodbine. Witlu'ousllm was that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad embroidery wears." -(Milton). We cannot, happily we need not try to, contrast or compare the beauty of gardens with that of woods and fields. And yet to the true lover of nature wild flowers have a charm which no garden can equal. Cultivated plants are but a living herbarium. They surpass no doubt the dried specimens of a museum, but lovely as they are they can be no more compared with the natural vegetation of our woods and fields than the captives in the zoological gardens with the same wild species in their native forests and mountains. Often, indeed, our woods and fields even rival gardens in the richness of colour. We have all seen meadows glorious witUniircisstis and early purple orchids, cowslips, buttercups, or cuckoo flowers. Cornfields blazing with poppies ; woods carpeted with blue bells, anemones, primroses, and forget-me- nots ; commons with the yellow lady's bedstraw, harebells, and the sweet thyme; marshy places with the yellow stars of the bog asphodel, the sundew sparkling with diamonds, rugged robin, the beautifully fringed petals of the buckboard, the lovely little bag pimpernel, or the feathery tufts of cotton gross ; hedgerows with hawthorn and traveller's joy, wild rose, honeysuckle, and bryony, while underneath are the curious leaves and orange fruit of the bandstand ladies, the snowy stars of the Stichwort, success yarrow, and several kinds of violets, while all along the banks of streams and the tall red spikes of the loose strife, the hemp agrimony, water groundsel, sedges, bulrushes, flowering rush, sweet flag. Many other sweet names will also at once occur to us-snowdrops, daffodils, and heartsease, ladies' mantles and ladies' tresses, eyebright, milkwort, foxgloves, herb roberts, geraniums, and among rarer species, at least in England, columbine and elec- pace. But nature does not provide delight for the eye only. The other senses are not forgotten-. A thousand sounds-many delightful in themselves, and all by association songs of birds, hum of insects, rustle of leaves, ripple of water, seem to fill the air. Flowers, again, are sweet as well us lovely. The scent of pine woods, which is said to be very healthy, is certainly delicious, and the effect of wood- land scenery is good for the mind as well as for the body. " Resting quietly under an ash tree, with the scent of flowers, and the odour of green buds and leaves, a ray of sunlight yonder lighting up the kitchen and the moss on the oak trunk, a gentle air stirring in the branches above, giving glimpses of fleecy clouds sailing in the other, there comes into the mind a feeling of intense joy in the simple fact of living." (Jefferies iriiW Life in a Southern Country.) Woods and forests were to our ancestors the special scenes of enchantment. The great ash tree Vgzdrasil bound together heaven, earth, and hell. its top reached to heaven, its branches covered the earth, and the roots penetrated into hell. The three Nomnas or Fates sat under the tree, spinning the thread of life. Of all the gods and goddesses of classical mythology orourownfolk-lore,none were more fascinating than the nature spirits elves and fairies, neckline and kelpies, posies and touches, mermaids, undines, water spirits, and all the elfin world " Which have their haunts in dole and play mountain, Or forests, by slow stream or tingling brook," They come out, as we are told, especially on moonlight nights. But while evening thus clothes many a scene with poetry, forests are fairyland all day long. Almost any wood contains many and many a spot! well suited for fairy feasts, where one might almost expect to find Titania, resting, as once we are told "She lay upon a bank, the favourite haunt of the Burning wind in its first sunshine hour ; For lhclu\urinnt strawberry blossoms spread Like a snow shower then, and violets . Bowed down their purple vases of perfume About her pillow. Linked in a gay bond Floated fantastic shapes these w ci e her guards, Her lithe and rainbow elves." In early spring the woods are bright with the feathery atkins of the willow, followed by the tender green beech, the white or pink flowers of the thorn, the pyramids of the horse chestnut, festoons of the laburnum and acacia, though the oak slowly wakes from its winter sleep, and the ash leaves a long linger in their black buds. Under foot is a carpet of flowers ane- mones, cowslips, primroses, bluebells which, however, while gorse and heather continue in bloom for months, " blazes for a week or two, and is then completely extinguished, like a fire that has burnt itself out." (Homerton.) " In summer the tints grow darker, the birds are more numerous and full of life, the air teems with insects, with the busy man but of bees and the idle hum of flies, while the cool of morning and evening, and the heat of the day, are all alike delicious It is really difficult to say which are most beautiful, the tender greens of spring or the rich tints of autumn, which glow so brightly in the sunshine As the year advances and the flowers wane we have many beautiful fruits and berries the red hips and haws of the wild roses, scarlet holly berries, crimson jew cups, translucent clusters of the Guelder rose, hanging coral clusters of the black boy on, feathery festoons of the travellers joy, and many others less conspicuous, but still exquisite in themselves, adorns, beech nuts, ash keys, and many more Tropical fruits are even more striking or one who has seen it can ever forget it grove of orange trees in full fruit, we take the more we examine the more we find to admit, all perfectly and exquisitely finished mystic and figures, perfect inside and out, for nature " does in the pomegranate close Jewels more rare than Ormus shows - (Mansell ) In winter the woods are comparatively bare and lifeless, even the brambles and woodbine which struggle over the tangle of underwood being almost leafless Still even then they have a beauty and interest of their own, the mossy boles of the trees, the delicate tracery of the branches, which can hardly be appreciated when they are covered with leaves and under foot the body of fallen leaves, while the ex Pateena seem brighter than in summer , the ruddy stems and rich green foliage of the Scotch lines, and the dark spaces of the ins seeming to acquire fresh beauty Again in M inter, though no doubt the living tenants of the woods are much less numerous, many of our buds being then far away in the dense African forests, on the other hand those which remain are much more easily visible We can follow the birds from tree to tree, and the squirrel from bough to bough It requires little imagination to regard trees as conscious beings , indeed, it is almost an effort not to do so " The various action of trees rooting themselves in inhospitable rocks stooping to look into ravines, hiding from the search of glacier winds reaching forth to the rays of rare sun shine, crowding down together to drink at sweetest Htreums climbing, hand in hand among the difficult slopes, opening in sudden I dances among the mossy knolls gathering into companies at rest among the fragrant fields, gliding in grave procession over the heavenward ridges nothing of this can he conceived among the unvexed and in varied felicities of the lowland forest, while to all these direct sources of greater beauty are added first the power of re dundance-the mere quantity of foliage visible in the folds and on the promontories of a single Mp being greater than that of an entire lowland landscape (unless a view from some cathedral tower and to this charm of redundant that of greater visibility tree after tree being constantly shown in successive height one behind another instead of the mere tops and Hanks of masses, as in the plains and the forms of multitudes of them continually defined against the clear sky, near and above or against white clouds entangled among their branches instead of being confused in dimness of distance - (Ruskin ) There is much that is interesting in the relations of one species to another Many plants are parasitic upon others The foliage of the beech is so thick that scarcely any thing will grow under it except those spring plants such as the anemone and the wood buttercup or goldilocks, which flower early before the beech is in leaf There are other cases in which the reason for the association of species is less extent the larch and the arolla (Pmus Cembru) are close companions The grow together in Siberia, they do not occur in Scandinavia or HuRst but both appear in certain Swiss valleys, especially in the cantons of Lucerne and Valais and the Engadine Another very remarkable case which has recently been observed is the relation existing between some of our forest trees and certain fungus, the species of which have not yet been clearly ascertained The loot tips of the trees are as it were enclosed in a thin sheet of closely woven mycelium It was at first supposed that the fungus was attired mg the roots of the tree, but it is now is considered that the tree and the fungus | mutually benefit one another The fungus collects nutriment from the soil, which passes into the tree and up to the leaves, where it is elaborated into sap the greater part being utilised by the tree, but a portion re- absorbed by the fungus There is reason to think that, in some cases at any late, the new < chum is that of the to after 'the great tropical forests have a totally different character from ours The trees Strike all travellers by their magnificence, the luxuriance of their vegetation and their great warmth Our forests contain compton lively few species, whereas in the tropics we are assured that it is comparatively late to see two of the same species near one another But while, in our forests the species are few each tice has an independence and inch wide lily of its own in the tropics on the contrary, they are interlaced and interwoven so as to form one mass of vegetation , many of the true s are almost concealed by an undergrowth of A online and aircrew used by spiral Stems of parasitic plants , from tree to tree hand in inextricable network of lupins and it is often difficult to tell to which tree the fruits, flowers, and leaves really belong Tile trunks run straight up to a great height without a branch, and then form a thick, leafy canopy far overhead, canopy so dense that even the blue of the cloudless blue say issued done might almost say, into a weird gloom, the effect of which is en li tried by the solemn silence At first such a forest gives the impression of being more open than an Eng fish wood but a few steps are sufficient to correct this error There is a thick under growth, matted together by way creepers and the immediate space is traversed in all directions by lines and cords the English traveller missed sadly the sweet songs of our birds, which are replaced by the hoarse chattel of parrots Now and then a succession of cries, even harsher and more discordant tell of a troop of men eyes passing across from tice to tree among the other branches, or lower sounds indicate to a practised ear the neighbourhood of a cloth or some other of the few mammals which in habit the year forests Occasionally a large blue bee minis past, a brilliant butterfly flashes across the path, of a humming bird linnean) the air over a flower, like, as at Pierresajs, an emerald set in coral, but how weak it is to say that that exquisite little being whirring and fluttering in the air, has a head of ruin, a throng of emerald, and w ings of sapphire, as if any triumph of the jeweller start could ever A to with that sparkling epitome of life and light (thomsons Voyage of) the Cltallewiei ) Mr. Darwin tells us that nothing can be better than the description of tropical forests given by Bales - The leafy crowns of the trees, scarcely two of which could be seen together of the same I and, were now far away above us in another world as it were We could only see at times, where there was a break above, gilt tracery of the foliage against the clear, blue sky Sometimes the leaves were palate, or of the shape of large outstretched hands at others finely cut on feathery, like the leaves of mimosas below, the tree trunks were every where linked together by since the woody flexible stems of climbing and creeping trees whose foliage is far away above mingled with that of the taller independent trees Some were twisted in strands like cables had thick stems contorted in every variety of shape, ents ming snake-like round the tree trunks or forming gigantic loops and coils among the larger branches ; others, again, were of filling shape, or indented like the steps of a staircase, sweeping from the ground to a giddy height Sir Wyville Thomson graphically describes a morning in a Brazilian forest- The night was almost absolutely silent only now and then a peculiarly shrill cry of some night bird reached us from the woods As we got into the skirt of the light the morning broke, but the rev veil in a Brazilian forests wonderfully different from the slow creeping on of the dawn of a summer morning at home, to the music of the thrushes answering one another's full rich notes from neighbouring thorn trees Suddenly a yellow light spreads upwards in the east, the stars quickly fade, and the dark fringes of the forest and the tall palms show out black against the el low ski, and almost before one has time to observe the change the sun has risen straight and fierce and the whole land scape is bathed in the full light of day But the morning is set for another hour cool and fresh, and the scene is indescribably beautiful 'The woods so absolutely silent and still before, break at once into noise and movement 1 locks of toucans flutter and scream on the tops of the Iinji forest trees hopelessly out of shot the car is pierced by the strange wild screeches of a little band of macaws winch fly past you like the wrapped up ghosts of the birds on some giddy old brocade -(Thomsons voyage of the Chai centres ) The reckless and wanton destruction of forests has ruined some of the richest countries on earth Sy na and Asia Minor, Palestine and the north of Africa, were once far more populous than they are at present They were land " flowing with milk and honey, according to the picturesque language of the Bible, but are now in many places are closed to dust and ashes AA by is there this melancholy changes Why have deserts replaced cities ' It is owing to the ruthless destruction of the trees, which has involved that of nations Even nearer home a similar process may he witnessed Two French de partments the Houses and Basses Alpes are being gradually reduced to ruin by the destruction of the forests Cultivation is diminishing, vineyards are being washed away, the towns are threatened, the population is dwindling and unless something is done the country will be reduced to a desert, until, when it has been released from the tie structive presence of man, nature once more reproduces a covering of vegetable soil, restores the vegetation, creates the forests anew, and once more fits these regions for the habitation of man In another part of France we have on illustration of the opposite process 'the region of the Landes, which fifty years ago was one of the poorest and most miserable in 1' France, is now one of the most prosperous by the planting of pines 'I he in creased value is estimated at no less than 1,000,000,000 francs Where there were fifty years ago only a ft we thousand poor and unhealthy shepherds, whose flocks pastured on the scanty herbage, there are now sawmills, charcoal kilns, and turpentine works, interspersed with timing villages and fertile agricultural lands In our own country) though woodlands are perhaps on the mi lease, tine fottstaceneij is gathering) disappenting line is, I suppose, unavoidable, but it is a matter of regret forests have so many charms of their own 1 liev give delightful impressions of space and of abundance The extravagance is sublime 'trees, as Tellenes says "throw away handfuls of flower but in the meadows the careless spLiiilthnftwiivs no grass and clover and all things are not to be expressed Seeds by the hundred million front with absolute in difference on the air The our line a Ethelred thousand more leaves than tipLossiny and never hides a single coin Notlnn,? utilitarian-even thin"' on a scale of bplemh I waste Such noble broadcast open aimed waste is dear IOUS to behold Never was there with it lying proverb as I Hough ians good as a feast ' gave me the first , give me squares red millions of st eds luxurious carpets of petals green mountains of oak leaves 'The greater the w lisle the greater the enjoyment the nearer the approach to real live '
