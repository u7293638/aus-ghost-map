' . - The wording of the: above .note-r- rwhich Vas handed. to me at the o^ce4-rpused my curiosity, and I immediately .'complied with the request, arranging to see' the- Captain that afternoon at my_ own house. By _a few enquiries I learned that he was a quie, t, retired gentleman, a widower,- without children, aiidTiad a passion ifor flowers and great taste in..gardeiiingj,but these facts gave me no clue as to his probable business with niel _/ . J ^_ i ' ''.-': . ^ He came, punctual to a iniuute, at the hour Lhad named^ and then I found him to be an easy, accomplished gentleman of forty or so, with an Jutter absence of mili-r tary stiffness or fashionable formality. : No time was lost— he began Tiis business at once. But he began it ina queer way. , ' I have heard that you are a little above the' common run of detectives/' he said. ' I meau that, besides the astuteness necessary for your profession, you have some education.' ' \- i 'No; I never had the^chance. -, What I know is all in scraps, just as I have picked it up,' I replied. 'You have been misled there.': ?-.;-? , -.- - - -? ; v ???- :?

Do you agree ? or have you not the time to spare at present? ' ' I have exactly one hour.' **? Less will do — much less at present.' ; ^-Then I agree, if it is necessaiy to your b^smess.'1 , Y' ? :-s3^« rattled overa number of topics, and very soon his brilliant intelligence and deep knowledge made me feel very small indeed. In thinking of this, I had forgotten about his errand ; but suddenly he drew up with the words— 'Now, do you inow why I asked you to talk with jne a while before mentioning my business?' 'No. Why?' '1 did it to see If you thought me mad.'' 'Mar* ?' ..'?'-'*?? I almost started from my chair as I echoed the word.. '.''.-?' ' Yes, Honestly, now, do you think you discover in me the; slightest indication | of a miud unhinged or diseased ?' ; 'A medical man would be a better j udge ; but, honestly* I dp not.' .L .

Neither do I— stay, I should say neither did I; for now 1 am_ haunted.' 'Indeed. By what, or whoui ?' 'You §hall hear. But first I may tell you that, in spite of my robust appearance, I am subject to a palpitation at the heart, and have been warned by my medical man that any undue excitement or violent ex ertion might be fatal; therefore you will understand the concern this thing has given me, and iny anxiety to have it cleared up.' I bowed, and quietly waited^ to hear more. He extended his left hand- on which glistened and slione a ring 6 j qutious f workmanship and resplendent beauiy.; It had but two stones — a ruby and a diamond tj — and these were set into each other, and cut so as to resemble- a round, glittering eye— like that of .a.serpent or a snake. 'Doyousee that ring?' he said. ^ I both saw it and admired, it. ,t ' WelMhat ring.I cut fEom.the finger of a dead nabob, during the rebeifioii iri India, and it isTOie'ghbsf of i;h.at nabob that bow haunts nie.' ???'* ?- -'?- :- -'* - S Here was a romance ! and I was into the heart -of it in a moment. t But it did not upset me.

The dress was of white silk, bound with red and fastened at the waist with a crimson sasi^fu The head was uncoveredj.and the ibng^ blackVliair- falling down over the shoulders formed a vivid contrast to the shiny, white material of the dress. ' Well, that was a dteans: now for the reality! When did the ghost proper appear— r- I mean tb your genuine^alang senses ?-' 'Three 'weeks ago tornight. This is. Friday, and I wish you to note that it was on a Friday that the , skirmish , occurred when I became possessed of the ring.' 'Of course it appeared at midnight ?' 'Not exactly — at least to my knowledge, for at that time I was sound asleep. Some thing must have roused me. I sleep but lightly, and the least rustle or noise would have done that. My bedroom is at the backhand on the ground floor. I chose it there because the window is the largest in the house, and looks to the east. I always sleep with the blind up, that I may get the full benefit of the morning sun. Well, I woke, as I have said, and- with a start, for I was sitting bolt upright inched and staring straight at the window when I came to , myself. ^There was no moon, but it was very clear, and the stars were all out. What I saw I saw distinctly, . and J! wish - n. to imderstand that I sprang out of to make sure that I was awake. About a couple of yards from the win dow, as near as I can guess, stood, the ' spectre of this Hindoo. From where I stood the head, shoulders, and arms, nearly to the waist, were visible. The eyes were fixed reproachfully upon me. The face was; convulsed, half in wrath and half in grief- ^ and the hands, as in my dreani, were wrung restlessly and persistently* How long I gazed at it I cannot tell. I was rooted to the spot. But as it slowly glided out of sight, I am ashamed to say that the shock was too much for me, and I fell down in a swoon. I had fainted like a woman.' 'Did any one else see the spectre ?' /'Not then — that I know of. , I was ill for three or four days after; but though the doctor saw that I had received a shock, I was ashamed to give Mm the details. When I recovered I found the servants moody, reserved, and continually conversing in whispers. I suspected the cause, but said nothing. My only dread was for the coming Friday.' I smiled — nay, grinned suits the thing better. 'Then you were sure it would come again on the same night, or rather morn ing ?' I said, enquiringly. ' I wasn't sure^-I merely feared it. Your scepticism does not displease me ; I rather like it than otherwise, for my own reason would fain point in the same direction. The Friday night came, and, for the sake of appearances, I went to bed at the usual hour. To make sure of no optical decep tion, I not only kept the blind up, but raised the lower sash of the window. Of course sleep was a thing I did not dream of. . I' placed a loaded pistol ready on the coun terpane, and lay down with my eyes fixed on the open window and lawn beyond. I; must have dovered over at last into a bgk£ slumber, but a rustle outside roused me. There was a little moonlight this time, and there in the feeble light stood the spectre !' The perspiration stood on the brow of any vasitor at the recollection, and he was . becoming painfully white. I handed him a glass of water, and shortly he resumed — ' There was no: difference in the ap pearance. The outline' of the figore was shiny against the light of the youug moon, but, owing, to the light coming Jfrom be hind, I could not so well distinguish the dark features. It slowly raised the right hand, and in Hindostanee whispered the word's — * Plunderer, beware the third !' ' *? Did you make any reply ?' 'No, I sharply raised my right hand and instantly fired at it point blank.' 'Did you hit it?' . ' No; the smoke cleared awayj and there it stood, showing every white tooth in a contemptuous smile. ,t am considered an. excellent shot, and could not possibly have missed had it .been a man. The sight was too much for me — I groped to get out of bed, a suddentearing at my heart seemed to send me sinlmig ^ownwaads, -andi ve^ member no more' till I found myself in becP : ^e£r! j; 'twelve 'hours after, witb/the doqto^, at my side.' v ' ''*'* : 'You are not well yet,' I said, with rs^meTsympf[thy'-^or 3iis~ agitation.' ,'',Ypu c :ought not,, to Jiave cpine but.

T 'Do you Teally think so?' he quickly responded with evident rel£efrand a general brightening of his whole aspectV\ 4i If I could only catch your spirit, it would take a deathly weight off my mind. By the doctor's advices and hints lean see that he considers my brain affected. . Now, I know that it is not. But you must admit that it is a very different thing talking about such matters here in the broad daylight, with the aun shining on us, from facing the thing alone in the stillness of night.' 'Yes, that is just where you erred; but if youjcoinmit the whole thing to me, the mistake shall not be repeated. I will watch with you.' 'You will?' he joyfully and eagerly returned. 'It is the very favor I should have asked. You do not then believe that the apparition was really the spirit of the Hindoo?' ' I certainly do not. In dreams the living may, in some mysterious way, affect ^is — though I am even doubtful of that; but the idead— no, I cannot believe it. You have been. duped in some cleyer way— perhaps by some one having a knowledge of your delicate health, and cruelly anticipa- - ting an evilxesult from the fright. Now, listen. This is Friday; and your whole manner tells me that iypu fear a return to- * night of your Tomantic spectre. It will be tieSuronderful * third time/ and your fears hint that it may be your last night on earth. Now liere are two pistols,' and I took them from a drawer as I spoke. V They are not, perhaps, such fancy affairs as^ yours; but I can assure you they niever miss fire. Indeed, I took them from a criminal who meant business with them ; and had they been useless, he would never have carried them. I will load them before you; and to-night you shall use one, and I the other. I am not, like you, a practised hand with them- — only keeping them for self-defence, or for frightening criminals in an emergency,; but between us, if youv hand does not fail, I daresay we may send a ball through your impalpable spectre. If he is still impervious, I will use my legs and hands in a chase and grapple, and I will take care that some one else is there to second me. Do you agree ?' ' Agree ?' he warmly echoed,' grasping my hand. 'How can I express iny thanks?' -/' . ... ..._.. . ' By lending me your wits in laying bare the swindle. I do not think the con spirator is oh the: premises, but it is as well to provide against every emergency, by keeping our every movement secret; Gould you get rid of your domestics in anyway for an- hour or two to-night while I inspect the premises a'nd make arrangements ?' '?I- don't know* Would it do to send them to the theatre ?' * ; ' The very thing^-a good idea.' : 'Then it shall be done. I will send them all, except my housekeeper ; and as she is Jny .fosterT-motheiy I can trust her with my very life. ' . : ' Then what time shall we ^ay ? There is no. need for coming too soon. Nine ?' .' Very good. Nine be it.' ' Just one thing more,' I added, as he r rose to go. 'My companion will be a de tective called McSweeny; will you be good enough not to mention such a thing as a ghost, in his presence? Speak of it as a man,' a trickster, a masquerading fool, or anything else that may suit your fancy j but not on any account as an apparition or spirit.' . Ihis Uaptain Lindsay very readily agreed to, and then ,he took his departure, while I got back to the office and asked McSweeny to assist me in the capture of a madman who fancied that he was Nana Sahib, the author -of the Cawjipore atrocities. It was the only plan I could think of to provide against his inherent fear of ghosts. He agreed with great alacrity. ' Nana Sahib ?' he echoed, with a know ing wink. . ' Sure, it's good company Fni goin' into anyhow.' 'Yes; p'raps better than you imagine,' was my inward reflection. 'I wish it was the real one.

'If Nana gets that on his head, he wont seek any more.' . 'Ah, but no violence, mind, unless it's absolutely necessary.' ?Och, never fear; Til be as gentle as a rat-trap widthe teeth wrapped J in velvet,' aiid with that his head disappeared, and we re-entered the house; I followed the Captain to his bedroom-* and^oon fixed upon my own place of con cealment. I may explain that this room had two doors-^-one -leading byya narrow passage to the door into the garden* and the other, opposite, ? leading into * the main lobby of the house. Opposite the wind6w stood a large wardrobe, and it so happened that, after I had ensconced myself in this, leaving the doors about two inches ajar, I had a full. view, of both these doors, as well as of the great window facing me. : « As soon as all. this had been i arranged, Captain Lindsay struck a light, threw up the lower sash' of the - window, brought some books, and sat down to read. . The suggestion wasmyxmn; for if it; happened that eyes were fixed upon that window from without, his figure could be clearly distinguished by the bright light, and it would be seen that he was calinly following his usual practice befoue retiring to rest. By-and-bye I could hear the - carriage drive up in front qf_the house,_ and the ' servants getting out and dispersingjuibugh the building. Then I saw the coachman, away down at the stables behind,' putting away the carriage and rubbing down the horses; but very soon his twinkling light went out, his footsteps- died away, and silence gradually fell over, the whole place. Captain Lindsay read on, steadily and unflinchingly, without once speaking to me or looking near my hiding-place till close upon twelve, and then lie deliberately un dressed, extinguished thelight- and got into bed. The silence soon became- oppressive, and it did not now surprise me that the captain had on the last occasionf alien into a slumber. . The moon rose -clear and- full* and as its light came in on the bed ilia broadsheet, I could see that this timethe occupant was both wide awake and keenly on the alert. His eyes never closed for a moment. The right hand, holding my pistol, for readi ness and convenience lay outside the counterpane. Had I been lying instead of standing I must evidently have fallen asleep; but perhaps the captain had excitement to keep him awake, while I had* only a deep in terest. How McSweeny got on among the faggots in the tank I cannot tell; my private opinion is that at first he slept. About two there was a disturbance of the heavy, stillness — a kind of rustle, ac companied by a soft footfall, and the Cap tain raised his head, strained his eyes in. the direction of the window, and listened intently. I felt my own pulse quicken as the ? sounds approaehed. Suddenly, and I must say 'quite unexpec tedly, one of the door^ of the room noise lessly opened, and a tall figure in Eastern garb, with Turkish trousers- and pointed shoes to match, stalked deliberately across the room, wringing its hands and keeping , its eyes fixed on the bed. , '- ( Captain Lindsay appeared completely . fascinated — paralysed — and stared at it with widely-distended: eyes, without even moving a finger. 'Even I was ^ taken: aback,: and never thought of the pistol in my hand till the thing had crossed the broad sheet of mopn£ light and vanished through the- opposite' door. ; , A -moment after I had recovered myself. 'Stay there— do not move!' I whis pered, as I flew across the room and through the open door. But the wide lobby was pitch dark, and after fruitlessly groping about for some time, and. hearing neither footsteps nor aby sounds but those I myself was making, I floundered back to the. bedroom for a light. 'Why did you not fire ?' whispered -the Captain, pale with excitement.. ^'1 could not have moved though it had been to save my life.' ' I don't know. I did not expect it from the door,' I hurriedly returned. ' Be sides, it might almost be murder ; I'm afraid it's a man.' ' Why do you think so ?' ? ' Because it did not glide after the ap proved fashion, but walked: — deliberate, regular strides. Ss-s-h ! what's that ? j I. hear it again, or something: like it, outsidie.' 'Look, look!' gasped Captain Lindsay^ pointing to the window. I did look, and there was the apparition again! The same paralysing effect fol lowed its appearance — we both stood staring at it as if petrified. ? ? For a . moment it stood wringing its hands as before, then the right hand, was slowly raised, the eyes fixed themselves Eiercingly upon Captain Lindsay, and the ins s!oWiy began, to prtwooncB some wor,Js in a foreign tongue*, wnich mSa& the Cap-* tain ehriiflr ^nd -ghrinfe? m if luf wrm-going ' to ekpi& on ti$$-6pot. ry- ^ %) -.^ ,\ But there came » suddeff intarrupftag!

The feet of ithe fugitive tripped «m something, ssA?So» hand being oooupiecE in holding the- other arm, down lie rolled in the dirt, with a heavy thud1, groanedf or a moment, ancllaT perfectly still'. - ' The ghost liads fainted. . j;' We pickedhiin up-— a warm, breathiBgr bleeding man^-and' earned him between us towards-ttie house; Half-%ay we were met by Captain Lindsay, with sonie of tin* roused servants Bearing Kghts; andwespoit had our prisoner stapetehecl --ut in^the 'hatil, surrounded by »? w^idering . shuddering group. ji I took a- candle^ fi*am one of them, an! placed it close to tfte- face of the wounded maUi v~* ' Nbw, take & gaocE look at your, ghosts Captain,' I!said, 'and tell me if you know iiim.'- The face of tiie senseless man was dona up with Spanish Brown, the moustache and Ijeard had been shaved off, and more* over the eyes were closed, so it is no won* der that for some- moments the Captain was in doubt.. . j8 McSweeny poured! a tumbler of water par the face; I wiped it white. The man: groaned; writhed, and' ©pened his eyes; and then the Captain knew him, and started right back at the discovery. . ' Why— good God ! if s Parks !' ** Your old body servant?' 'Yes. Well', rf that £snt the strangest thing I ever, heard of ! * What on eartht could prompt him to it ?n il Fancied wronors, probably. He ha* paid dearly for it, though; Fin afraid jfour shot caught hiin in the arm. Take off th& dress ; it?s real silk, too. I wonder where lie got it?' . t .- : ;; ;, . ''Stripped1 from the dead. I see ii alt now,' returned the Captain. \\*'Wefl, T would give anything that it were undone^' and he looked like it, f 6v he stooped ttownv and tried to radse the man in his arms. The face of the wounded old soldier was convulsed with agony, and he could scarcely speak ; but he managed to struggle' -back- wards, with his eyes fixed in deep irate on the face of the man he had once served so faithfully, and groaned out— - r 'Awajr! keep — off!' : 'I'm afraid, Captain, that your pity, is misplaced,' I ventured to remark. = ^JRe member that this trick of his might have cost you your life, and might have done in calculable mischief as well. In intent he was a murderer, and- in my opinion, for such a contemptible trickster no punish ment can be too severe. He has taken Ad vantage of your inmost confidence, com bined with ais knowledge of the premises, to plot against your. life. 'Chance has decreed that instead of a M My8terip_us_and Fatal Q-hostStoiy'. there is only an inge nious piece ef masquerading to.-jjeiate;;j but the result might hav^ been 'Vary' different, -and lie Baust suffer accordingly.' These were my words, but it tbdk a deal ?more talking to convince the Captain of their soundness. At last, : howeirer, h& consented to the removal .of ; Parke'tft'thei Office in our -custody, and orderejl^out th© -'carriage f&r; the purpose. Beyond vttexingr the three words I have /record^, ttt« wounded man never opened \liS8^p|iv-Wa took him to the Office, where- his arm was. dressed; but the bone had been badly shattered, and next day, after a consulta tion, he was, removed' to the Infirmary t where before night it was deemed neces sary to amputate the disabled limb a little below the shoulder. » ,; As soon as he was sufficiently Recovered he' was' arraigned for playing^th^ighost, 'with intent to do grievous oodily harm.7* To make sure of having a hold on him, the indictment had to be very carefully and nicely worded; but the ingenious defence set up for him almost threw the whole- to the winds. The plea was that he had been: suffering from deluium jbremens, andf«on sequently was_.npt responsible for- his actions. The j^dge and jury, biearever, did not quite see it in that light ; bttk as the principal suffereT, Captain limifeav, had spoken strongly in his favor, the ^mitigated punishment of six months' in^msonment was awarded. \ One carious fact I must ste*K c-The very ;_(jay ^tbat Park's term ^xpirea^ Captain Lindsay^s carriage wasiia- waiting to- »? ceive him and convey ;hiin to FmuMinff House, in : which lie served faith&K;^ «nd honorably till hi& death, four years iamr.
