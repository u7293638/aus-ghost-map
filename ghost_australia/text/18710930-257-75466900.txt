The latter constituency consists only of 57 electors, and the results of the poling was— Morehead, 21 ; Handy 8, li.

Mayor was in the act of rising to propose something, we believe the health of the ladies, when the floor ut tbe ' hall ' suddenly collapsed, the table, dishes and lights disappeared, and a scene of excitement ensured. The ladies were passed through the windows into the ball room, and from the ball room, we presume, into the street, while sundry lusty lords dashed through the door, bearing their timid partners to the nearest point of safety. "F rcrtaaatel;-,' says 'Ms telegram, 'no one was tt:-t. Mr Anthony Trollope has completed a tour on the Downs, where he has been treated with princely hospitality by the "squatter kings." Owing to the drought he will not have seen this beautiful country to advantage, but he will nevertheless be able to form some idea of its extent and capabilities. On Wednesday last he was the guest of the citizens of Brisbane, and from what we can learn he has promised to deliver a lecture on the Caxton cen tenary, which will be celebrated in Melbourne in October next. Notwithstanding the derogatory re marks passed upon the colony by the "university man,'' who visited the colony a short time ago with a floating notion of making his fortune in a general way without very much exertion, Mr Trol lope has given us words of cheery encouragement, and expressed himself in the warmest terms upon the condition of our laboring classes. Speaking to the citizens of Rockhampton on the 24th ultimo, he is reported to have said:— "Although you all say that everything is going wrong, and although you are all complaining, yet I never see a man that does not eat three meals a day. (Laughter. ) It is not so at home. There you often find men that taste meat only three times a year. Here I see no one without clothes, if not of the best kind, yet appropriate to his position. There you often see a man clothed in tatterdemalion rags, that wears a coat cast off by some reduced gentleman, that belonged to some flunkey before him, and perhaps a nobleman before that. You never see that here. In England they are only considering how to educate the poor. Here the children of the poorest are educated. I am surprised to find that even where the population is very limited a free school is established, to which the children of the poor and rich flock together. When I hear you grumble I cannot understand the language you use. When you see what is your po sition, and also what you have done; what is the position of labor— for after all that is the main thing— you have no reason to complain. The aim of all political energy is to raise the laborer, and the laborerer here occupies a grand position." Wi have great hopes that the so-called Queens- land Slave Trade will receive its death-blow long before the Home Government is called upon to inter fere In the matter. Notwithstanding that every precaution has been taken by the Government to guard against an improper system of recruiting for laborers in the South Sea Islands by the appoint- ment of Government Agents to each of the cruisers J|#M tesw tusaA (^experience that toe agreements ^s^aetiBaUcaMbeenncplainedtotheiilaiiders, Hjatl feat kMsappingiaaaotnally token place under ttettfeeeCtfeatgB&tt.; A very painful ca*si» now (, J^iMtsfliUtin..aaa trosa what has famnapired «*»**** (Maonto bdifcve tfad tbe inquiry is tin ******** Hi* *&.' mat ?«-.«. a. , .jm.mgltme tetare in tin fcikrtory of r«^fej£^^ 'L ****** rf **?* Bss»^L^siiiii^s^BB3BHnlJSIBKHS^^ff'w^^-#^^^**P^ *s Sw* ?a^S^?S- ^H^^K^^BaHf^i»^s^^MBl^s^is»a^stesttrf«i**-^^'^i^--' they cannot appear in a court of Justice aginst their taskiB»8ter», -od ttat tt»body casaforitemwboks toUwttintererta. ttmaybeUtatibiarliaea'faUaome ttmeatn light and}il-#LS)l-itpbuies;tlHt their semtuuc M on fdBaiaat employment and moderitepiolit; but l^aUtJus there ii»«ai a great aodto- nUtriettii «tt**K«mi«ofawbe»{Je».l»ondtas«nwilJ(all int»-^ baada of cruel aud oppressive tyraats Men wao-fawa not ewo tbe pecuniary istedat in. the «iaw once peaaessad by tb* Amerkaa pUuters, but who, by an unforsauate license from the Crown, have every inducement or temptation thrown in their way to neglect, or, in plainec and more appropriate wonK to get rid of their victims in order t» asoapsi tbe j£3i- (Moment at tbe eipiratioii of t&6 service. As we said before, our ministers of rejjgion are perfectly informed as to the terrible coniiogen- dot of the trade, aad still they are mate in yalpit and hall. It would not be so in England. The question of again opening up the Torres Straits mail route has been diseassed on several occasions during the last month, and tbnt very favorably. No action, him ever, will be taked in the premises until the conclusion of the Customs Conferance' iiuw sitting in Melbourne, when the claims of the respective routes nil! in all probability be duly cousidereii. l\v ths l-epreaeutative of tbe Torres Straits line it is proposed to open a monthly service between Batavia and Sydney, in the Straits and Moreton Bay, with i.pr- nissi.-i! to cail et Timur and one or more vf the Northern ports of Queens- land, the run to be Jiirjli1 !:i i::;iCt-eu days.

Mr Cox.tliei;eut'.fr.'^«iiu4ue'.stion, has received tele- graais from the representatives of both parties to the rait. The first telegram was from the firm of soli- citors for the defendant, telling Mr Cox «u no ac- count U- cive up the book to any one. but stating that ii he would deposit it in tie Bank of Sew South Wales tb-'y wonld open a baak credit in his {avor. tD \k available should the hook prove vain- able in t-viienit-. This was quickly followed by a message frcLi the c'.aimatit'e lawyers, demandmcthe book as their client's property, and threatening an action of trover should it still lie detained. Our readers will remember that the coarse and unculti- vated person who has instituted proceedings for the recovery of the Tichborne estates has admitted in evidence that he assumed the same of "De Castro" whilst engaged in his butchers and stockman's duties in New South Wales, and the bride of the "last of the Tichbornes"— who at the present time is receiving instruction in the three R's at a private school in London— was never acquainted during her "gunyah honeymoon" with the position she was chosen from among the " domesticated ladies'' of Wagga to occupy in England when Roger should have his own again. The pocket-book in question is said to contain several memos of a very interest- ing nature, made by the lusty Knight of Alresforl or the "cleaver"— we cannot say which — during his short but characteristic career in Australia. In mic of the first pages of ' Sir Racer's ' note-book is the followine a^l'lress : — 'Miss Mary Ann Loder, No. 7, Russell's Buildings. High-street, Wapping, Lon- don, which, by a strange coincidence, is, or was, the address of the young lady to whom the Wap- ping butcher, Arthur Orton, was engaged prior to his departure from England. In another portion the book is a!i entry, iusertfil probably as a re- minder, ' La l-iclla.' R. (.'. Tichborne, hart., Tich- borne Hall, Newmarket Surrey, England, G. B.'' The memory of the presumed heir being so terribly deficient iu regard to the situation of ''that Hall,' which f.ir nearly eJereu hundred v«ars has been the home- of the Tichbornes, that he is compelled to refer to it as 'Tichborue Hall, Surrey,' instead of 'Tichborne Hall, Hants.' The following hhrewd observation, which appears immediately after tbe address of Miss Loder, will unable our readers to obtain a very fair idea of the author's inward re- flections: — 'Some men with plenty money and no brains where made for men with plenty brains rui'l nomoney. K. C'.T. Bart.' In concluding his notes, Mr Castro observes : — ' I do hereby certify that my name is not Th'-n)i.» '.'astro at all. Therefore thow; that say it don't know anythink aliout it. K. f. T.' Of the authenticity of the- hook as once; having been the property of the claimant there is no douht ; hut we understand that Mr Cox intends for the present to 'stick to it.' OUR readers will learn with surprise that the Hon. Charles Lilley, who was so very modest and cir- cumspect in his hustings' utterances, has not only refused to forget and forgive the nestle criticism of the Warwick Examiner, but has "raised" the amount of damages from £1000 to £2000. Satur- day's KjMviiiit'r says : — la urder to keep our readers well posted k? \n the progress Mr Lilley ib making in his suit for libel against us, we beg to inform them that wu have this week been honored with another voluminous document, occupying eight pages of foolscap, and which in legal parlance is called a ' declaration.' This frightful looking memorandum of monotonous legal technicalities is enough of itself to strike such terror as to almost make us give up tbe ghost atoncu, but its formidable appearance is nothing to the sensational intelligence it contains — viz., that Mr Lilley has raised the amount of damages from £1000 to £2000 (two thousand pounds') If there are any steps yet to be taken, and at each of them Mr Lilley raises his claim by £1000, it is hard to aay for what sum we may be sued when tbe trial really takes place. Sat as the case at present stands, £2000 from us and £2000 from the Queens- land Times are nice sums, and, after all, are better prizes than any seat on tbe Ministerial Benches. To say the least of it, this is a new way of raising the wind, but whether it can be carried out success folly or not remains to be seen. We learn from a contemporary that tbe arrivals of immigrants in the colony under the Immigration Act of 1869, have been as follows: The numbers tupiesuut statute adults. i87O-^u]y Ii : The Indus (Brisbane), with 421, of whom 734 were foil paying, 1761 assisted, 1374 free, aud 3tt remittance.

Tie total number of souls is alxial 4530. No official ioforniatioa has been received respecting th» neit immigrant ships, but agents' advices state that the Royal Dane has. been accepted by the Aeenl- General and placed on the berth, and that the Elestrew will bring the nert 1st of liiruiaii immigrants. Owing to the high rate of freight charged by the railway authorities on goods passing between Ips- wich and Oakey Creek, and opposition exhibited by the Minister for Works to every industry initiated on the Darling Downs, Mr Beit has been compelled to suspend operations at the Hogarth Meat-preserv- ing Establishment. It will be unnecessary for us to refer to the number of hands that will be deprived of employment through the closing of this establish- ment, but we understand from excellent authority that the profits derived from the business will not adirtft of so large an outlay for freight as demanded by the Commissioner for Railways. WE believe there are few localities in the colony, generally speaking, bctter supplied with schools than Toowoomba. Indeed our fellow-townspeople have every reason to congratulate themselves, and to be grateful to the Board of Education on this score. There was perhaps one suburb which hitherto seemed to be forgotten in this otherwise excellent provision. We allude to the district commouly j kunnii as I'piw Irisbtown, iu the neighbourhood of Mr Pentcost's Picnic Hotel.

A RATHER unusual casee of summary punishment and unlawful imprisonment occurred in Russell- street a few days ago. It appears that a worthy and substantinl publican residing within a hundred and fifty miles of th' Post- office corner, was pos- sessed, in addition to his stock of Perkins aud stout, of some five or six sides of bacon, a corresponding number of hams, and a few "pickled shoulders." The latter were temptingly displaye.1 in the back kitchen, and many were the mouths that 'watered' thereat. Nothing, however, came of it until Tues- day last. On that day Mr Boniface went around taking stock of his pork, when, to his astonishment, he discovered that the number of " shoulders" had been reduced by two or three. He at once concluded that the thief or thieves were not far distant, and that in all probability they were residents of the neighborhood, which latter opinion was supported by certain sounds and grateful odours which escaped from an adjoining tenement. Puzzled for a time, and unwilling to risk the responsibility of enforcing a search, Boniface pruilti.tly resolved upon watching the premise:;, bcliuvi.'ig th.it the quuliticdof'thetueat uvuid U-n.l to ensuri' auvthev aud an early visit. Having posted himself in a convenient corner, he sat down in view of his neighbour's door and the pork in the kitchen. Scarcely, however, had he settled down to the task when he heard a slight move ment of the door, and observed a strange form craw ling stealthily in the direction of the ' shoulders.' Tin; form entered the kitchen, and immediately it paxsc-il from the ste]i to the floor Boniface dashed suiMi'iiIy frotn hie hiiiog place, Ivckeil the tluor, cautioned his sen-ants, and proceeded with bis ordinary duties. After an absence of about two hours he proceeded t-) open the door in the presence of tbe police, and t i Mb nmuseinent discovered that the ' captured crawler ' was no other person than his suspected neighbor. The fellow jumped with amazement at the ' sight of the sergeant,' declared that his intentions were strictly honorable, and that lie had entered tbe kitchen with the simple view of taking a comfortable nap. He prudently, perhaps, had refrained from appropriating any of bis neigh burs goods, ninl nothing beinj; found in liis bundle or pockets Mr Boniface declined to charge him with being ' illegally on the premises,' and allowed him to go at large after administering a severe and atriki'4; rebuke. The lost shoulders were never -lii?' nvered, but tbe neighbours say that the savoury riivnrof 'broiling rashers' in that particular neighborhood is 'very remarkable.' A fine little boy named John Gunzer was ad- mitted to the Hospital on the 10th inst., having met with a very severe accident at his father's residence near Black Gully. It appears that the boy was en- deavoring to climb a tree in his father's paddock, and while so engaged fell from a branch and sus- tained a fracture of the left thigh. We are pleased to learn that the little sufferer is doing extremely well, thanks, to the skillful treatment of Dr. An- derson. A sale of Crown lands took place at the Russell- street Office on the 14th inst. The attendance was very small, and the competition limited. Lot 1, comprising sixty acres in the parish of Drayton, near the head of Hodgson's Creek, was taken by Bridget Brennan at £1 6s per acre. Lot 3, containing forty acres, and situate near Gowrie Creek, was knocked down to Mr J. L. Hodgson at 20s per acre. Lot 4 was sold to Mr E. Edmunds at the same price. Lot 5, consisting of thirty-live acres of agricultural land near the Oakey Creek Railway Station, was taken by Mr Wm. Beit. Lots 5 and 6 were passed with out an offer ; and lot 7, the last, was sold to Ellen Crawley at the upset price of 15s per acre. A voung woman named Mary Lynch met with a very narrow escape from serious injury on the 17th inst. The unfortunate girl who is a very inexperi- enced horsewoman was riding in company with a fellow servant from Eton Vale along the side of the East Swamp, and on turning into Margaret-street at a brisk canter she was thrown from her saddle, and fell with considerable violence on one of the side beams near the bridge. Her companion also was un- able to manage her horse, and on reaching the turn she was thrown to the ground, but, fortunately, so far in advance of her friend that she escaped the abutments of the bridge. Assistance, medical and otherwise, was immediately given, and the injuries sustained by the young woman Lynch were found of so serious a nature as to warrant her removal to the hospital. The other victim, although seriously bruised about the head and face, was enabled before the close of the day to resume the journey home. MR TYSON, of Buarabah, is having a paling fence erected about five feet high, aud a foot in the ground, thirty-two miles in circumference, enclosing a, dense scrub, with the object of keeping the wallabies, kangaroos, and native dogs from encroaching on the surrounding lands, and it is believed that this will have the effect of killing them all off, as there is no water in the scrub where they are to be confined. A little boy named Daniel Ryan, met with a very painful accident on tbe 19th inst. It appears that the boy, who is a pupil at the Irishtown school, was returning to his parents' residence near the Highfields road, and obtained a lift on the road from a passing dray. On arriving at the point of the road where it was necessary to dismount, the little fellow imprudently attempted to jump to the ground whilst the bullocks and dray were in motion. The consequences were that he stumbled and fell to front of the dray, one wheel going over the left thigh, which was broken, and the other grazing his cheek and ear. The unfortunate boy was brought into tbe hospital on Wednesday last, and we are pleased to learn that under the care of Dr Roberts his case is progressing very favorably . A MAGISTERIAL inquiry was held at Oakey Creek by G. O. Beardmore, Esq, J.P., on 22nd inst., touch- ing the death of a South Sea Islander named Selledele- man a native of Levuka, in the employment of Messrs. M'Lean and Beit, of Westbrook. It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Ross, Mr Gunn, and some of the deceased friends, that he had been ailing for a long time, but only took to his bed last Monday, since which time he had been visited daily by Mr. Ross, who had at each time failed to induce him to take either food or medicine. He died, evidently from natural causes, sometime the previous night, two of his companions having been sleeping near to him at the time. A carpenter was at once instructed to make a coffin for the body, which will be interred on the ground. A second inquiry was held by by Police Magistrate on Thursday morning last, by order of the Colonial Secretary. The evidence given on that occasion will be found on our second page. It is notified in the Government Gazette that B. Aland, Ea%., has U*i appoiuted to the Committee of the Toowoamba Hospital, rirs E. \V. Robinson, Esq., resigned. Our readers wilt learn with regret that Mr W. H. Wiseman, Police Magistrate at Rockhampton, died from an attack of bronchitis on Monday, the 3rd instant. Mr Wiseman bad attained the ripe age of sixty-seven aud had resided in the colony just thirty years. We regret to learn that Sergeant King, of the Leyburn Police, met with a very serious accident at Glenelg, while he was on the track of the sup- posed Toowoomba horae-stealers. We hare not yet been advised as to the nature of the injuries, but the Warwick Anjun Bays they were of such a char acter as not only to prevent the Sergeant from pro- ceeding further, but to compel his return to Leyburn in a vehicle kindly furnished.

M'Carthy, bto acting manager ..f the 15risb:i;iu brancli of the Bank of New South Wales, u reported by the Cvitrier. It appears that Mr M'Carthy met with his death by drowning, the body of the unfortunate geutleiuim liavim; bii-.i iliscivered in the Brisbane River on Tn.-fi.i.iy, .^cpt. 19, by a hid who was lisbiiig at the Tnrb-.t-Ktreet ferry steps. Thu hook of the line crmpht in thi: (.m-nionts of the deceased, and on l.riiii! haulfil iii'tlie body rose to tliii surface, aud was 6ec»rc 1 ):y s man jiauial William fioberteon jiassing a lin.- rour.d it. Informs tiou Mas imme diately couvcyeil to the police, and Sergeant Ste- phenson mill several of the men attached to the force proceeded to the spot and removed the body on .i rtn tcher to the morgue, where it was examined by Dr. O'Doherty. The sad occurrence caused deep lvisret in tins city when it became known, Mr M'Carthy havingbcen highly respected and esteemed as .i kind-hearted, genial citizen, whose loss is de plored by a wry large circle of iricoils aad acquaint ances. It appears that on Saturday morning last the deceased, whu resided on the bank premises, came down to his ollicc at the usual hour, aud transacted tome business in the ordinary course, and that about 11 o'clock he put on his hat and walked out, this being the lost time he was seen fdive by any of the mmatiB. His affairs were in perfect order, deceased liciiu.' considered to be one uf the most efficient offi cers connected with the bank. A magisterial in quiry touching the sad evout took place last even ing, when Or O'Doherty, one of the seven witnesses examined, described the appearance of the body, and stated that it had been under water probably about forty-eight hours, tbe cause of death being asphyxia from drowning. Tbe funeral, which took place on Wednesday afternoon, was very largely at tended, the attendants occupying nearly forty car- riages. The Rev. E. Fnller, after a brief visit to Mary- borough (says the Chronicle of Tuesday) set out yesterday on his return to the Mission station on Frazer's Island. He expresses himself sanguine of being able to do the aborigines much moral and spiritual good. The chief obstacle to be encountered, so far, lies in their roving and unsettled habits. He has, apparently, little difficulty in teaching them to read, as they master written symbols in a very short time. Several of them can read the New Testament and repeat hymns. They also devoutly join in public worship. Mr Fuller is still in search of a more eligible site for an agricultural mission station. A CHARMING idea bas occurrred to the Mayor of Melbourne, viz., the forinuH.ui of a cabinet of curi osities in connection wilh the civic archives. It is suggested that the portraits of His Worship and his fellow-councillors should be preserved in an album for the benefit of future generations of "doges," and a commission under the great seal of the Council has been appointed to seek out and secure an artist competent to dificlinrgp the grave duties which will be required of him by the civic authori ties. At a meeting held on Monday, the SOth ult.. His Worship presented to the Council a very ' handsome photographic album, constructed in hold 500 portraits, with a request that the councillors would insert their eartet-rle-tmte in the volume as soon as convenient to the artist, in order that it might be preserved as a memorial of that Corpora tion in years to come.' We recommend the pro ceeding, with nil sim:«;ty, to tbe attention of tbe Municipal Council of Toowoomba. It ij, to our mind, the most simple and inexpensive method of laying the foundation of an alderniauic portrait gal lery, and affords the most favorable opportunity of preserving tbe memory of those sagacious and beam ing countenances, which have so lone and so honor ably administered tiie affairs of the town, ami whose names will )?-?- for ever associated with shaded thoroughfares, revolving debentures, and the Dog Act. As regards a family picture, we believe it would be a very difficult task to discover a 'body' — civic or otherwise— that would form a prettier or more effective group. Taking tlie. portly members, aud there are many, for the centre, the medium membcre for the sides, nnd the plump little mem bers as guardian angels— sportive cherubs, or other wise— a picture would lie produced worthy of special observation in every circle, and deserving a ulace of honor in every family album. A stMTCr; antidote for strychnine is given by Mr Donald Gunn, of Pikedale, to the Warwick Argus, — "Some time last year I noticed in the newspaper an account of the death of a young girl from poison by strychnine at Inglewood. and again I notice the death of a young woman at Leyburn from the same cause. And from this I suppose that it is not generally known that oil is an antidote. It is quite common on stations where strychnine is used for the destruction of native dogs that the domestic and useful dogs get poisoned, but on every occasion where I have given oil to the poisoned animal the dog has recovered, though in some instances after having had several fits, and to all appearance beyond recovery before the oil had been given. Once two dogs got poisoned hero at the same time, one had sulphate of zinc, the other got oil given. The one that got the oil given recovered, and the other died. I am so confident nf the cure by oil that t think 1 am only doing my duty by letting it be known through year paper that a fill of salad oil poured down the throat, if not too late in the application. is enough for a dog, and ought to be tried on a man.' NORMAN M'LEOD, writing from the CAoncurry Diggings, under date August 12, to the Cleveland Bai/ Expna, sjays : — ' Some tune ago my premises were robbed by blacks of firearms and other things. - The police were informed ef this, and tbe answer was that they dare not go after Hrem.

Tte iianaiid and lour others belonging to she tudua took the ?hip's boat op Doughboy Creek, with the intention of tMthing. The current was rsuming very strong at tbo time, sad it appears that Brown was swept away by it and drowned before snyoooooBldoosie tohusaadstanoe. Robert Veren, the third mate of tbe vessel, div«d four times after tka body and brought it to thesorfaoe, but was obliged to let it go after endeavoring to swim with it on his back to tho bout, in consequence of its weight. The creek was assiduously dragged during tho whole of Satur . day night, in order, if possible, to recover tho re mains of deceased, but without success. Brown was about 18 years old, and had only joined the Indus from the Kamgey about six wee*. The body iras found on Wednesday morning, and conveyed to the Morgue at Brisbane, where an inquiry was held on Thursday last.
