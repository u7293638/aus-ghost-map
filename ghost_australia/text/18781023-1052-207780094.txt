— ;o: . 1 ' MACBETH. , ' Mr. Thomas Kenny, a clever essay- ) ist, and who has written most ably on the subject of " Macbeth," character- > ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime, s and terror relieved by the most mag- nificent imaginative expression, yet ) marked with great simplicity of general \ design. The date of the production of the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6, ) and "we may take it for gninted," , V says Kenny, "that ir was" written 'in ' ' the time- of James the First, tyho- ) ascended the throne March; 1603', as it C contains an evident allusion to that r monnrch in act iv. scene I, and' also a ) complimentaiy reference to .him in an- I other part. The material for the play- was found by Shake.speave in Holin- 1 shed's History of Scotland, where the' ( story of Macbeth is told at page 168.'.' . / The Macbeth and Duncan are. repre- 1 seated to have been cousins ; the first ( a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- ) sition, and the latter " so soft and V gentle in his nature that the- people ( wished the inclination .and manners of ) the two to have been- so tempered and J interchangeably shared : betwixt tkem C that where the one had too much of ) clemency and the other of cruelty, the J main virtue between these two extre- / mities might have reigned by indiflfer- V ent partition in tliera both. The play \ all along keeps close to the line of / Holinshed, a'arying.from it in scarcely p any particular except in; the- non- V appearance in the banquet scene of the ( murdered Banquo's ghost." ) , This tragedy has been presented in C Melbounie we believe oftener than any / other of Shakespeare's worlis. The \ late C. V. Brooke, Charles Ke.an, ( Charles Vincent, in their time .essayed V the part, and we have had other repre- \ sentatives, fiom the burly McKean f Buchanan and Jame.s Anderson to the ) little dapper J. B. Howe. But few A , artists have made their Melbourne C - dchnt in the rSle of the Thane ofCaiv- ) dor. Of those who have, we now call \ to mind: Mr. C.
