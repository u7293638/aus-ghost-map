SEMAPHORE. The crowds taken to the Semaphore by train were supplemented by vehicles of all descriptions filled with excursionists. The tide being suitable the juveniles were soon sporting in the briny, and the elders set up camps on shore. The steam-cutten had a lively time in making short trips, but there was a manifest want of music. The rotunda was like a ghost at a banquet. Another lamentable want is proper accommodation in drinking fountains. The day proved a most enjoyable one, the light sea breeze keeping the place beautifully cool, and the enjoyment was nnmarred by any accident.
