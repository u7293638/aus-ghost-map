Suitor ** points to ?file' circumstance' that a largeisvajprity of the NSTases decided in Local Oonrjts turn purely upon 'iiffieult points of law. He' deems this an ex ?eellence in 4k«w-3oarts. I think it a defect, -mot in the oonstltution of - the Courts, but in theirlpractice. These Courts are expressly dlBo^a'Jto;ae-jiae iaccordiBg' to 'equity and :g6od9%onsoienee,n not upon legal quibbles, sw&ioh; axe most frequently utterly beside the .merits. F^oigmenta^ guided as it is,enacted ;$hey'shouiarbe guided, no lawyers aienecesB&ry.; v^n f.ct, your borrespond^nt strikingly connrms ' the-ehargoiroDght against the working of the Courts that ithey jstrise too frequently after [ttie ' law' rather than the 'good conscience ' ,9f a* case. 'This is manifestly directly opposed ^io the prinoipleB upon; which these Courts created. ? .-.???-. 'A I4o not profess to he acquainted with rwriters ' upon jurisprudence. Their opinions ^however, are not binding, and it is not neoesssry Ito be their slave, An English lawyer, a writer °of considerable' eminence,' supports my views flSen?be.»ay.Sr-'lHso far aa^concerns justice and veracity there; are two codes of morality th«t In this country have currency and influence, viz., that ?6f the public at large and that of Westminster HalL In no two countries can the complexion «f their respeoti?e iegal codes be easily more opposite than that of these two moral oodei.' And again—' So far as concerns love of truth and justice, the greatest, but at the same time the moBt hopeless, improvement wouWTbe the raising of the mind of a thorough* paced English lawyer, on a bench or under a imnoE, to* a level with that of an average man 'taken at random, whose mind had net, for pro* ^^^^tudy of the law.1' The whole passage la ; tpo^Iongio he cited at length, bat the above is anfficiehtv'to »hbw that All jurists are not so mush in accord as ??Suitor 'states. Natural ^stice 'unfettered by precedent is. undoubtedly preferable to artifioialj ustice, of whioh we have had so long, jio painful, and so unsatisfactory ^experience. r,'''.'1 ' . rT^tt:fs hiRh ttne that &e; hollow mookery of ce(fjfcainty claimed by our present system should be -expOTed and scattered to Hie winds. This Mcfeous Idol of cer'ainty of precedent, so wor shipped, by the devotees and high priests of the -UWffia no -more substantiality than the Cock* lane Ghost.

T?alk of the Tmeertalnty of ^he law Talk of ahy man knowing the law' i Why even among lawyers, who have devoted themselves to the study of the so-called science, from the Lord Chancellor down to the rawest errand boy in an^attorney's effice, there ia txq man that knows ?the law. Yet it Is to the mercy of this no* knowledge, and to the ' certainty' (?) founded upon this no3cnewledge that ' Suitor' would Jeave^us. He will not contend that law admi nistered in the Supreme Court is less certain than that administered by a professional Local Court Magistrate.
