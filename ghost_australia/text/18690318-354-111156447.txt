? MUCKLAY'S MANAGERIE From, the Ghost. . TVTio voted for llucklay tho Big? The Clarence dingo, ho, ':The Braidwood moke,* the Mvulgee pig, ..? The Camdeu chimpanzee. ' They voted in a park together,— ] ' '. Suoalhavon's hungry stoat, : . ''The Upper Hunter's old. bell ?wether, And Tninworth's bleating goat. And, foremost in the motley crew, West Sydney's poodle show'd, East Sydney's ' little birdie,' too, Tied to East Sydney's toad. And there was Newtown's ohatt'ring daw, And Tentorfield's blind owl, : And Bast Macqunrie's old kahauf ' : Known by bis fervent howl. And there the Hastings wild cat slunk, To join foul bkd trad beast ; And poor Argyle ! its mnimed skunk Was 'inougst them— not the least. . There Wellington's Jew liiard crawl'd, And Eden's faugless snake ; Bnlrnnrdd's bunyip came, when call'd, For Big MucklOy's dear sake. Now England's bandicoot was thore, And Paddington's raccoon, And West Macquarie's native bear, And Hawkesb'ry's wild baboon. They gathered round Mucklay the Big, To play his despernto game ; But dingo, donkey.npe and pig Were brought to grief and shame.
