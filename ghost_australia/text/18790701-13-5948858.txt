I FARMERS' UNION. ,¡ [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) ECHUCA, MONDAY. About a fortnight ago, a public meeting w as held at Rochester, called for the purpose of forming a farmers' union That union was formed, and the public meeting appointed a committee to draw up the rules for the government of the association Some few days later the committee met at Rochester to form a code of rules At this meeting two representatives of the local branch of the National Reform League waited on the committee of the Farmers Union to endeavour to amalgamate the two bodies, which, however, was not agreed to by the Tanners Union The committee of the latter then adjourned till tonight, when a meeting was to be held at the Restdown Hotel At the appointed time a large gathering took place As soon is the chairman was elected (Mr J. T Brown, of the Marathon 1 state), the Bec retary read the following list of cardinal objects of the Farmer s Union - 1 To advocate for a revision of the tariff providing for the restriction of the duties upon those implements solely used by the signal tural community in the production of grain, &.c, and other duties such as those levied upon cornsacks, salt, in 2 To obtain a subdivision of electoral districts, with the view of separating the agricultural and mining districts 3 to obtain a reduction in the freight on agricultural produce charged by the Victorian railways 4 to urge upon the respective Governments to place a sum of money upon the estimates to forward the interests of agriculturists by providing for a proper water supply in the dry districts, and to connect those districts by branch line of railway which were at present outside the pale of railway communication S to advocate for a system of assisted immigration 0 to have the farm ing interest fairly and proportionately represented in the local government 7 to take such other steps to conserve the interests of the members of the Union from time to time, also as soon as practicable to establish weekly markets 8 to support only those candidates for Parliament who will thoroughly identify themselves with the farming and grazing interests, and pledge themselves faithfully to represent the Union in Parliament In answer to an inquiry from Mr Thomas Spencer, J P', the chairman stated that the meeting was a committee meeting, but there was no objection to the public remaining as spectators, but they could not take partisans business A great dispute then arose, and several of the leading members of the local branch of the reform league spoke in favour of the gathering being turned into a public meeting The meeting then became most disorderly, and merged into a public meeting of a noisy character, which continued to a late hour. The rules could not be passed in consequence of the action of the members of the reform league and the meeting resulted in nothing of a satisfactory or definite nature BALLARAT. -?

much to be pitied Ihej'hivo not only the obnoxious jumpers to heart, but all the existing birds of prey seen to be hovering over them to pick their bones The last development of this great rush to deprive these shareholders of part of their property was the notification by the bank that it intended to sell its right title and interest as mort gages of the old St. George Company to certain blocks of land claimed by the Band and Albion Consols Company, and alleged to have been transferred by the St George Company to the Band and Albion Consols Company without the consent of the mortgagee The next thing reported is that Mr Gray, the manager of the St George Company, means to sell all the right, title, and interest of the old company, which he represents, to certain mining tenements the same, I believe, as those put up by the bank, to which it is alleged the St George Company still hold a title The rumour is to some extent confirmed as anadvc-tiBcment which appears in this evenings papers by the Sheriff announces the sale of the tenements in question and now another rumour has followed, to the effect that the Band and Albion Consols Company have decided to enter an action against the bank, claiming heavy damages for defamation of title To use the language of the hammer.amostsplendid opportunity is here presented for men of capital becoming possessed of a valuable
