Proceeding along the Ballarat-road to the Kororoit railway station, a magnificent stag was unharboured from the deer- park in full view of the field. The stag immediately went away at a great pace, until approaching Mount Atkinson, when a fearful storm of wind and hail caused him to change his direction, cross the Bacchus Marsh railway line and make for the Kororoit Creek, where he was retaken after a run of about seven miles, Messrs. A. Oliver and R. Grice wading thigh deep in its swollen waters to assist in recapturing him. The plains were almost a sheet of water, and the farmers were jubilant at the great downpour of rain.
