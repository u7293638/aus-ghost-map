( MAGBEiiv . ' : Mr. Thomas Kenny, a clever es.say- ist; .and who has imtten most ably on" » the ; subject , of Macbeth," charaejer- ( ises it as " a drama 'of igigantic c/ime anct terror relieyea . by the .mo.'jt mag- \ hificent imaginative'' exprcsMon'," 'yet' f marked with great 'simplicity of general' ) design. The date of the prptluclion of \ the piece is 'set ' by Fiirnival at 166576, f and "we mayJake-it for grunted,"' J says Kenny,, p. that it was ,.\yritten ,iri A the tim'e ' of 'James the 'First, -ivho ( ascended the throne March, 1603, as it ) contains an cvidenj .allusion to that \ monarch in act iv. 'sceiic I, and also a ( cothph'mehtaiA' reference to him in an- ) "olher; parti" The material for the jilay was found by -Shakespeare in Holin- shcd's Histbry of Scotland,' where the / story of 'Mactielh is told at page 168." A 'The A'lacbcth ami Dunc.in are .'rcjirc- ( sented to have been cousins ; the first / a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- \ sition, and the latter "s6 soft and ( gentle in his n.iture that ther people J wished the inclination and. manners of \ the two to have been so tempered and interchang -ably shared betwixt them J that where the one had too much of . clemency and the other of cruolt), the ; ( main virtue between these two cxtre- i mities might have reigned by indiffcr- \ ent partition in them both. The play / ' all .along ; kee|)s clp.sc to the line of Holin.shcd, varying from it in .scarcely T any,.' particular ' except, in the , npn- ./ appearance in the banquet scene of the A murdered Banquo's ghost." ' f -, This tragedy has been' pre.serited in t Melbourne we believe often'cr than any ( other of Shakespeare's works. The A late Gc. "V.
