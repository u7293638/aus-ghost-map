At the morning service P* J. C. Verco gave s,n address. Speaking with out a text, he referred to the early Christian Church and the day of Pentecost. This was-a time of reception for the Jews into the Church that Christ had established. Salvation through Christ wa3 first offered to that nation, and the descent of the Holy Ghost was a mani festation of God's power amongst them and His call to them. He detailed on the life and customs of the Jews; their observation of ordi nances, the notion they held that salvation was only for themselves, and their surprise on discovering that the purpose of the gospel of Christ was the extension of salvation to the whole world. That was a great reopening service when Cornelius aad his household were brought into the Church of Christ, and from that day the apostles aud many of the Jews began to see that the purpose of Christ was to extend to all nations the enjoyment of salva tion through Him. Mr. Gore, M.A., gave a discourse on " Lovest thou me ?" in the after noon, aud spoke of love as a power operating in the heart, creating a disposition to love for Christ's sake. In the evening the pastor (Mr. H. D. Smith) delivered an earnest address and expatiated the leading principles of his Church. Their common ground was love to Christ. Special music was sung under the direction of Mr. George Maggs, and Mr. Jos. Taylor presided at the organ.
