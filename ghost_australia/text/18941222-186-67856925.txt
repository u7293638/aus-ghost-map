BY JOSEPH HATTON, Anthor of ' Cmel London,' ' Clytie,' 'Three RecnritB,' ' Under the Great Seal,' ** By Order of the Czar,' tc., &c; [all bights kesebfed] Chapter XL— Ox Guard. Within a fortnight Geoffrey Lathkill was as well baown at Castleton as if he had lived there for yeans. He had settled down io the house with the iron gates, the grass plot, and the flower garden; and Mrs. Midwinter declared she had never had so charming a ten ant. Her two maids were almost as complimentary about Mr. Lath bill's valet and man-of-&U; work who had arrived at Castleton on the third d*y of Lathkill's Wait with all kinds of luggage, easels, sketching tents and what not. Mrs. Midwinter's drawing room had been turned into a atndio. It faced north and sooth, and thoa possessed the artist light Mr. Lttthkill desired. Two of the windows that gave upon the lawn were draped, bat a glass door-tray at the northern end was left open : and here the eye fell upon the greenest turf adorned with the brightest flowers, the whole shot in by a high wall which in its turn was excluded from the sky by the hill that over looked Cavedale. Mra.Midwintermadeevery possible concession in regiu-d to the rearrange ment of her house, for LathldU was not only amiable bat a liberal paymaster. At first she was not sore whether it was quite the right thing for Adser BIythe to visit her tenant alone, even if only far the purpose of sitting for her portrait. The question had been debated by Zodack Bradford, and had been protested against by Lewis Tregarron. Mrs. BIythe saw no objection ; Adser cosld take care of herself ; and Geoffrey had spent more daring one day at her Museum than any visitors throughout a whole season. Geoffrey would take his sherry and bitters one day at the Nag's Head, the next at the Wheat Sheaf ; he bad eat in the smoke-room of the Castle at night ; and he had patronised the general trade of the place. He was never tired of visiting the lions of the locality, and had eat for the hoar together sketchu & God's factory. The only man be did no', get on well with was Tregarron ; though he disliked a certain Staley Brentwood almost efi much as Tregarron did. Sol Tidwr amused him, and at the same time saddened him. There was something fateful he thought about the Uttle crooked chap, who turned up in odd cnriao& ways at unexpected times, and his chumt of ** After many roving years ' seemed to imply a meaning that was certainly not in tended. It was as if Sol knew Geoffrey's secret pasrion for Adser BIythe, and noted it as the denoaement of a world of wandering aad cur conquest, to meet bis match in this child of nature, this woman of the people. Sol had no such fancy, his song as we know was a reminiscence of bis friend and patron Jessop BIythe. Geoffrey's conscience troubled him a little, though it is only fair to say that he had no set design against Adser, nor any seriously formulated intentions one way or the other, bnt be permitted himself to become fond of the giri, while he honestly tried to make believe that he was fascinated with the iiistoric and artistic attractions of Castleton. Geoffrey and Adser bad already had many 4 quiet calk. Sometimes be found her at leisure in the Museum. Now and then he atroiled into the Cavern, bat mostly when other people were there. Nevertheless, he made opportunities foe chat. Once he had ?net her near the Gate of the Winds, and she had walked with him thence over the top of Mam Tor in the direction of Peveril's Castle. It was during this pleasant ramble that Geoffrey in a bantering way asked her if she had ever had a sweetheart : ' besides Mr. Tcenrwn,' with a. emile she did not like. 'I wonder why you ask me snch a foolish question,' she replied, 'do you snppose it is a compliment!' ' Well, do,' said Geoffrey, taken a little aback. 'It's the kind of question lads oat for the day ask lasses they meet at teetotal trips from Box ton and other places.' ' Is it V said Geoffrey, amused. ' Wnat if I should ask you a question of that kind ?' she said. '* Well, I should endeavour to answer yoa to the best of my ability,' he replied. Adser hated to have Mr. Latbkill speak to her aa if he thought her one of the ordinary -silly frivolous lasses that she allowed were -x-mmon enough in. shops and bars and auch like places. Spite of her lovely sution and her unconventional manners she was jost as proud in her way as the best lady in the land. Not only in words, but in her sadden silences, in protesting **Ohs,' in her quick repartee, and by an occasional toss of her head, she fi^ve Geoffrey to understand that if they were to be friends he must treat her with respect and consideration ; for the more Bhe found berself liking him, the further indeed that she drifted into love with him, the more exacting she became on this score of courtesy. 'Very well, then,' she said, looking at him with an arch flash o£ her eloquent eyes, '* have you ever had a sweetheart ?' 'Yes, one,' be said with acted demure 'Only one?1' she asked, raising a cross examining forefinger. ' Only one in earnest,' he replied. 'And where is she now ?' '* Md she jilt you ?** ?'No/* ?'Didjou jilt her*1' ' Bnt she ib not your sweetheart now ?' Adser asked, with a little liurry of increased interest. 'OL,' said Adser, with an uumiaLakablc sigh of relief. 'She was a beautiful girl,' said Geoffrey, in something of his former tone of banter. 11 Of course,' said Adser. '* A lovely figure.' ' No doubt,' said Adser. *? The loveliest hair.' ' Had she really !' said Adser, with a little scoffing laugh. ' And she could sing divinely.' 'lEbonlaVt wonder,' said Adser, 'and how came you to let ber slip V ' I don't know what she had to her fortune, but quite a. Urge sum,' said Geoffrey, uot noticing Adser's last (question. ' I wonder that didn't decide you,' said Adser sharply. ' Oh, then, you think I wonld marry for money *' *? If you wouldn't, you're a grand exception from all I've heai-d of roeo making up to rich lasses and widows wi' brass.' ' Hrass ?' said Geoffrey. 'Money, it's all the same,' said Adser, ' we call it brass i' the Peak.' ' I'm sorry you have such a poor opinion of me,9 said Geoffrey, pretending to be hurt. ' Nay, I dare say you may be the exception to mooey- niarriers ; you're an exception in bo many other ways ; but what became of yonder lass, yoa 're only sweetheart wi' the tine figure, the lovely hair and the divine voice ?' 11 Fm afraid she joined 'he Salvation Army,' Geoffrey replied, once more his natural self, with that little suggestion of banter, however, that troubled Adser, becsuae it seemed like 'making fnn of her.' He pleased her most when be wan serious and talked what she called sense, and told her about some of the wonders lie had seen beyond the seas. ' What wi1 a tambourine and a great hulk ing fellow banging the drum under her aristo cratic nose,' Adser exclaimed. 'Ictn't quite say whether it bad dram? and tambourines in it, but it was some kind of a Salvation Army ; I know tLat I wouldn't take the shilling and become a recruit : so we couldn't agree about it, and ? ' ' Don't you think you should tell that story to the marines, as our Zodack Bradford would say?' ' To the marines ?' repeated Geoffrey, smiling at the familiar phrase, that sounded oddly on Adser's lips. ' Yes.' ' And who are your marines in Castleton ?' ' Kay, don't ask me, Zodack will tell you. Bo.t you seem to be in oqc of your fanny whims to-day.' ' No, I don't think so ; if it is dot exactly true to the letter about that sweetheart of mine and the Salvation Army, at all events Bhe had such strange ideas of evangelisation and giving up all one's life to the work of the Master, and so on, that I found if ever I made up my mind to marry her that I should be a very secondary person in the partnership, so it was off. Not, mind you, Alias Blytbe, that I was really in love ; no, and have never been that X know of ; though it is rather suspicions this long stay I am making in Oastletoa, eh t' Adser did not reply, but walked on by his side silently. Then he attempted to take her hand ; which she resented with a flashed face, and hurried on, as if she would leave him. *' Don't go, Miss BIythe. You promised to zhow me the way, yon know.' 14 bonder's Sol Tidser,' she said. ' Hell show you,' and thereupon running towards Sol, who was sitting with a book in a grassy undulation of the mountain walk she called out, 'Sol Tidser, hi !' Sol taking no nctice, she gave out her signal-whistle, that was something like a boat swain's call, and Sol looked up, and was on his crooked legB in a moment. 'Sol, here's a job for you,' she said. 'Mr. LathkQl wants you to show him the way to the Castle— not Castle Hotel— Peveril's, and down t'other side beyond Cave dale, and into the highway,' 'All right; I'm yonr man, sir,'' he said, running back to Lathkill : while Adser, with out another word, fairly flew atom; the ridge, and socn disappeared beyond the remains of the once gloomy fortress, where suddenly reconnoitering the country far and near, now shading her eyes, and now lying down as if to listen, she dropped down by the side of a bit of jutting crag, then sat Btill a little while ; of sight altogether. Old Muckletkorpe was not surprised while going his rounds with a party of visitors from Liverpool to meet Adser coming from the farthermost end of the Cave. It was a trick she had often played him. He never could guess how it was done ; and on this occasion he was so pleased to see her that he did not trouble to say that he had not seen her go into the cavern, and nobody except himself had the key. She had deserted the post of volunteer guide so long that he could only exclaim, ' I am glad to see thee, lass; I do hope yo'II help me agin wi' Adser only laughed, and said she'd see about it ; bat just then she had other things to attend to. What other things did not transpire. Adser simply walked quietly home, went to Zodack'a room, sat in an easy chair, that he culled her throne, and watched him chasing with a tine-pointed needle a piece of shining mineral that was whirl ing round and round on bis lathe, like an impaled deathahead moth ; and Adser feU as if her own heart was being similarly tortured. Chaptkb XIX— Adser Rlvthf. Sits For Hfr Portrait. Ic was quite a week after this incident of the walk over Mam Tor before Geoffrey had induced Adser to sit for him in his extempor ised studio at the Laurels He hud done everything in his power to regain her friend ship, though he hardly knew how he had offended her. Once or twice he had made sketches of her at the entrance of the Cavern when he had also been st udying, or professing to study, tlip general effects of the ar^uc Ouce he had introduced Txegarron into a group of the ropers and hoping to conciliate the Welshman bad shown him the result, bnt Tregarron only scowled at it, and remarked that a photograph was good enough lor a rope-maker. Geoffrey was delighted when it was settled that Adser should sit for him. He had Uejpin to feel that a day without a talk with the girl was a lonely business. By no means unsop histicated in the art and practice of flirtation, he nevertheless hardly knew how firmly the girl of the Cavern hart taken hold of his fancy, and hou- deep an impression si.e was making on his heart. The truth is, he did not think about it. She amused him. It was a uew pleasure to talk to so fearless yet so timid a girl, and one who was so na.Luro.Uy and un affectedly beautiful. She seemed to lead him on, and. when as he thought he was surely winning her confidence she would Buddenly fly out at htm, or Bulkror run away, just asshe had done that day on ihe mountain. Hut Adser was quite unconscious of leading him on. She had no subtle plan of making him love her ; but the was impressing him in a way that kept her continually in his thoughts. He had quite looked forward to her visit to the Laurels. When she arrived, he plotted all kinds of subjects for conversa tion. He liked to hear her talk. Even die blemish of her dUlect did not affect him un pleasantly. He found a peculiar music in her voice Her langii w as genuine and mirthful, and her teeth fairly ahone when she was merry. Geoffrey had never seen a. complexion so healthfully pale It had nothing in common with the eiueraic poverty of blood that accom panies the pallor of the Londoner. Her lips were red, her eyes bright ; and now and then a flush stole into the fair cheeks, tl»at to Geoffrey seemed perfectly beautifoL Adser was sitting near an open window, partly shielded from the morning sun by an outer blind. She was dressed asGeofirey had wished, in the brown serge and old-fashioned sun bonnet in which the artibt had first seen her. They had chattered about various things while Geoffrey was busy getting his easel and hia palette ready. He was purposely dawdling and Adser was in a good laikiiig humour. Presently from the weather and the opposition Adser had encountered at home on Geoffrey's proposal that she should sit to liiui, he asked her who was the remarkable person they called Scarthin Ely the. 'Oh, he's a queer lot,' Raid Adser, 'he's my uncle, where have yon seen him ?' ' One day coming oat of the Cottage, and on another occasion going into the tumble down old place they call rue Traveller's Best ; the swinging sign is soil there, bat I didn't notice much in the way of rest for travellers ; even the sign was creaking in a. very doleful way.' windy there; its a rum kindof place, Scarthin's 'Oh, do they call it a smithy?' 'Some folks do; he's got a bit of black smith's shop at the back, where he shoes his own horses ; oh, he a hard loc is Scarthin BIythe ; I don't know that any of my family1*, much to boast of ; bnt even Granny Blythe can't stand Scarthin ; though they say he's as rich as a Jew ; he's gotten his hand on many a poor fanner's homestead, I've heard say ; bnt I don't know much about him, except that when he speaks to me I feel as if somebody was walking over my grave. Eh, but you should go through Winnats at night ; they call it the gate o' the winds, yon know ; and there's been no end of murders done there ; the last man killed 'here, however, was years and years ago ; he was hi a Glossop bank ; he was running away with stolen money ; his horse went over a nasty bit right into the Winnats and he broke his neck ; old Scarrhin married his widow a month or two after, and made a drudge of her, and she looks as much like a ghost as a real bogeart, they s*yf though I've only seen ber about twice. Fee heard a deal believe in 'em ; if luere'd been such things 1 should have come across one for certain in the Cavern. Eh, bat I am chattering; I've never talked so much to anybody as I have to you, not even to Zodack Bradford. ' ' I like to hear you talk,' said Geoffrey, 'besides you have so much to say that is in teresting to a stranger.' 'I dare say; I often think Castleton and hereabouts must seem very queer to visitors, especially if they stay long enough to get to know all about the place.' 'It is a very romantic village,' said Geoffrey, 'end the people are what you cail mostly characters ; now there's Staley Breut wood, what is he ?' said Geoffrey, as he squeezed a fresh tube of colour upon bis palette. 'He lives retired,' Aduer replied. *? Lives retired?' repeated Geoffrey. ' He was iu the Derby police, and married a widow with money.' ' And why does Mr. Tregarron dislike him 'There are folk a man can't help hat ing, Zodack says it's their nature. ' '* But was there not something al-out Iiis lieing willing to risk liis life lor your '? Who told j-ou that *' 'Mucklefhorpc.1* '* He's a regular old vocnan for gossip, Mucklethorpe,' said £ds--r, h-?r eyes bent upon Geoffrey's palette, which was by this *4 He aeems a very mnUbfo old fellow,' said Geoffrey. 'Oh, he's all right.' 'But how was it that ue was ?ftiUioc to sacrifice himself?' ' Oh, it was just nothing ; the Cavern was flooded and they thought I whs in Roger Rain 'a house and couldn't get out ; and StaJcy Brentwood volunteered to go after me, and he hadn't got as for as first dip in the Cavern when lie was washed out like a drowned rat.' Adser laughed heartily at the memory of Staley's appearance on that memorable occasion. It was a musical laugh* (Senffrey , thought he had never heard aUugh so s^uum and so full of enjoyment of life. 'And where was Trecarroo ?' ' Talking politics with Zodack Bradford. ' And you * Were yon in the Cavern V 'That's telling,' said Adser, with a little nod of the head implying mystery. ' And is it ever since Staley wanted to save your life that the Member for Wales hated him ?' n . ' They always snarled at each other,' said Adser ** bnt didn't Zodack tell you that old Mrs. Brcntwood was jealous of Staley because he went and half drowned himself.' Adser laughed again as she asked this, to her most ridiculous question, pausing in Ihe middle of her merrimeut to offer the comment of 'Just fancy anybody thinking about Staley Brentwood ; fifty if he's a day and with a nose in everybody's busioess ; they aay he was the most ferreting sergeant of police that was ever fenowc in l£-rby, always finding something ont which there was nothing at the bottom of. He spends most of his time wi* county police in the Peak and spies on folk for them.' 'Now then, I am quite ready, said Geoffrey, placing a chair upon the platform for Aaeer ; '-ft-ill you oblige me by taking this seat ?' He offered his hand to her ; but she stepped upon the dais and sat down un assisted as if this was by no means her tirat experience of portrait painting. 'Thank you/ said Geoffrey, 'have you ever sat to an artist before ?' ' Do they call photographers artists,' she asked, with a little hesitation. *? The photographers call themselves artists,' said Geoffrey. ' But you don't,' said Adser, still a little embarrassed. ' Hardly,' said Geoffrey. ' I once had a photograph token for Zodack at Boston ; he liked it ; I thought it wua hateful.' Geoffrey moved towards her with a view to pose her, but observing a certain stand-offish manner in the way she looked at him, be merely stood below the platform and directed how she should nit. He found her apt in her interpretation of his meaning, and begun to make a rough crayon sketch of her. ' We caa talt while I isorit «U the same,' he said, noticing a somewhat tiled expression bpreadiog over her otherwise mobile features. 'Very well,' she said, putting on what Geoffrey called her submissive manner, which was one that came at intervals when she was puzzled or very much interested. ' I mentioned Tregarron just now,' he said, ' by the way, I don't think he like* me ?' Oh, he's a character you know,' ehe said, recovering her habitual manner ; 'it doesn't do to take too much notice of what he says ; some folks think too much before they speak ; some think too little; Tregarrou doesn't think at all, he out's with whatever cornea into his mind.' ** Ho likes you very much ?' *' Well, Tve never done anything to make him go against me that I know of,' said Adser; ' we've been brought up together, as ' But they tell me he doesn't aspire to lie your brother !' ' How do you mean aspire?' ' He han higher hopes. ' 'Oh, Tregarron has all manner of fads, wants to see life, he says ; baa had thoughts of being a missionary ; says he envies my father, who ran away to foreign lands ; but there s soft heads in Castleton who make out that he should be a member of Parliament like Boke's eon. Sach rubbish !' ** He's a clever fellow-, eh ? Can make a good speech * Doesn't he write poetry?' ' Lewis Tregarron knows more than most ; but when you come to ' Lord UUin's Daughter,' ' Mary the Maid of the Inn,' and verses of the kind, Tregarron'a only a rope maker after alL' ** A very good rope-maker, bat not a very good poet, eh 1' 11 Have yon heard him say the speech, ' Ruin seize thee, ruthless king?' ** No, is it very stirring *** ' It isn't bad, and ' Men of Harlecb.' well that isn't up to much, bat it wants singing, he says. Have yoa heard him sing?' '* No, I have a. great many pleasures to come I find.' 'Oh, I don't know about pleasures, but they say iny father was the Hiwn to sing and Zodack tells of hie whistling like a black bird.** ' He's comin** home they say.' ' firaodmoiher'a heard that story any time this two or three years.' 41 Rich, they say.' ' I wonder he dare show his face in Castle ton,' Adser replied, with a slight drop of the corners of her mouth. '* Oh, but he is your father,' said Geoffrey, patting in his pretended work to look ox ' Yes, that's it ; and he left mother to die and me to be dragged up anyhow. A. nice father that ! And it it hadn't been for dear owd Zodack Bradford, Nannie BIythe would have brought nie up with a stick. Zodack had many a row with her about it ; but that'll long since. She has to be content lo give me the length of her tongue now, instead of her staff.' ' You've bad rather a hard life, my poar girl,' said Geoffrey, in a tone of pity. ' Oh, no, i haven't. I've had rather a good life as things go. I'm not to be pitied. I don't know anybody that I envy, and nobody that I'd change places with. ' Adser drew herself up proudly, and Geoffrey was quiet to say, 'iiy dear Miss Blythe, I don't commiserate you, I admire you. I don't know when £ have seen a yon&£ lady whom I admire so much.' 'Oh, don't call me a young lady,' said Adser, the flush ou her face dying away to paleness. ' I'm uo young lady ; young ladies don't get up at five in the morning, and make fin* and gee breakfast ready, and sweep up, -dort be guides to caverim, and go tr&tnpmg; about hues and hills, and each like/ 'There are girls who cannot help being ladies though they are bom to drudeery. Do yon ever read fairy tales V ' I've read ' CindreUa,' and * Dick Wittinp ton,' and 'Jack,' and Zodack has read some of * Midsnm-ner Night's Dream ' to me— that beats them all, doesn't it?' 'Yea, I think it does,' said Geoffrey, snrprised at the answer. ' Bottom - Oh, isn't he great 1 If he'd been a bit mean he'd have been something like Staley Brentwood—and, uh, yon most get Zodack to chaff Tregarron about Parson Hugh and that other fairy tale* or do yon call ft a play ? Yes, I know o, comedy ; it's got Tre garroa ont of saying look yon and indeed to goodness, Zodack says. It's where Llewellyn says he was born at Monmouth, and makes ont it was where Alexander the pig, was born, that sets Tregarron going, and Bometimes he's real mad with Zodack, bnt they come round after a bit, and then Zodack gets him to say, ' Rain seize thee, ruthless Ring, con fusion on thy banners wait,' Jand it's enough to make a cat laugh.' ' It roust indeed,' said Geoffrey, delighted with the girl's gossip. 'Mr. Bradford is your idea of a fine man ?' ' How do yon mean a fine man *n she asked. 'A fine character, a man to make a friend of,' said Geoffrey. 'Oh, he's a nan of a thousand, is Zodack,' shp replied. ?* It's a wonder he never married.' 'It would h&ve; been a wonder if he had, who'd he have been likely to marry ? Besides he's an old man.' ' Not so very old ; besides he was young '* res,' she replied thoughtfully, 'of coqrse, though I cannot imagine ZoA&ck; ever being young, that is gadding about* black berrying, nutting, or wading in the streams for fish ; he most alwavs have had old ideas.' '* Yet he is lively enough, and nimble too.' ' lively ! I should think he was, he's the life and soul of Castleton, and as for bein« nimble, he can set about faster than grand mother without a stick : and yon should hear them have a bit of a squabble, doesn't he get the better of her ! He told her one day she was like a mfllwheel that ran all day long and ground nowt, and I daresay you've uuiiced that about her, how she goes on, talk, talk, talk, and after all says nothing, unless it is some nasty thing that angers yoa ; I mean none of it's any good. Now I know wfant you're thinking, I can see it in the way you're nulling, yoa think Fve got & long tongue of my own ; pot calling the kettle black. ' 'Ho, indeed,' said tieafirey, 'I L&« *& bear yon talk, yon are so frank, and your voice is sweet*' 'Hank you,' said Adser, with a mock bow of her handsome head. ' You'll beaskiog me to ring next' '* You told me yon could not sing, and I nave asked yon to whistle,' said (jeoffrey, smiling. ' I only whistle when Tin giving signals to 2A nckietnorpe. or walking by myself down in the valley, or up above Peverfl Castle.' ** I wish I might go on one of those rambles with yoa,M eaid Geoffrey, aa if he were speak ing to himself. 'Yoa'd set Castleton talking if yon did,' said Adaer, ' and I don't know that I haven't given them points enough for gossip as it ie in Bitting for my portrait ; they all know ?boot it.' 'Do you care V ' Not I,' said Adser ; ** I've flown in the face of CasUeton many a time.' '?Indeed, in what way?' ' Oh, in many ways, in the way Tve dressed my hair, and walking ont of church once in the middle of the sermon — who'a going to be talked to as if one was dirt by a curate on a pound a-week. ?' I certainly would not,' said Geoffrey. Then there was a pause, daring which Adser wondered why getting ready to begin painting took flo long, and if it always consumed so much time why Mr. Lathkill did not get readv before she arrived. 'Won't yon tell me something elsei' Geoffrey asked presently, ** I can't taint of anything just now ; you said you'd tell me something about that young lady that yon think is the same that Mr. Jerry Bray was telling ns about being in Sheffield when he was there, and they say is coming through the Peak with her banner and her singing women. ' 41 Yes, 1 will tell yon all about her wifh pleasure, but another time ; I want you to sit quietly now for a Uttle.' ' Very well.' said Adser. 'I don't mean to ineituu-te that you have not been sitting quietly all the time.' ' Oh,' said Adser. ?' We will go on with our chat soon.' ' Very well,' said Adser. ' Are you ready to begin?' 'Yes/' said Geoffrey, stepping Dp to the platform. ' Hermit me. Torn your head a little this way, please.' He kid hia land upon her shoulder, a familiarity, slight as it was, that she let him understand by a glance of her expressive eyes she did not like. ' Pardon me,' said Geoffrey, who under stood the silent protest as well as if it had been expressed in the most emphatic words. It passed through her mind that qnite recently when Tregarron had suddenly kissed her, she had felt something like the annoyance that Geoffrey had set up when she found his hand upon her shoulder, and yet there was no flutter of the heart in her anger with Tre guron, whose face she had promptly sUpped. Somehow the tonch and the look of Geoffrey iAAhkill hurt her. To her curiously sensitive nature it was an affront. For a whole half hour ahe did not speak, and Geoffrey's spirits fell. ' It's raining,' were her first words after th* long interval, daring which Geoffrey hurt painted seriously, and without ceasing 'ami I must hai-e been here for hours. I tuni'i stop any longer now.' bhe rose abruptly, picked up a large sun bonnet which she had taken off* oo entering the room, uid made straight for the door. 'I bave not offended you,' said (ieofirey, anxiously, and following her palette in hand. 'No,' she answered. ?? Bat I can't stay any longer.' ** You'll get wet. Let me give you an umbrella.' 'No, thank you. I've no use for um brellas,' she said, and was gone without looking back. Geoffrey went to the door, and watched her disappear along the path towards the L&pidtry;'a Cottage. She ran through the summer storm, her short skirts flying behind her, and shotting her neat ankles, her flap ping bonner looking like a pair of Mercury *d wings against her head. Geoffrey sighed as he stood watching her ; and when he turned to re-enter the hoase, from which the sign, 'To Let Furnished.' had been taken down on the second day of his arrival &t; Castleton, Mr. Lewis Tregurron, die Welshman, came np to him from the opposite direction. ' A word with yoo, Mr. LathbiH,' said the young man, in a peremptory manner. ' By all means,' said Geoffrey. '* Step tliis«»y.' ( To ?* ronfiitned. )
