Ihayo isberi' 'Clifford' doing his work ' daily, mbrnirig' and' 'eyenirig ' ever: sinco.he 'cariie'fi;pni .iFlawarra'Lake.' ft . have also seen him. rowing alongside of l'Beabh'/^he'.Champipii,'''but as they were' both'' foxing' no line' could bo taken ; .but on 'the 'other hand','1 -have seen Clifford rowirig 4iipr6 th'an'lonce ;in;'twb different arid' distinct forms. .One'- he 'rows for his own e'dificatibri as':well''as'for nis friendsi The other, is most pal^abl'^1 meant for the public, and itis quite'pri theWoardttiat'sbme of the Ptessreporters.hWe had the. misfor tune to ;witriesB Clifford when he wins not row. ing. From mjr o wri personal knoweldg'e and experiericej I thin'k' that '^Clifford cannot row' well in rough water';' but, iii .smooth or .medium water he', ib1 far from being' a 'waster ;'. and I liaye' had-the pleasure of seeing; him, row;' 'in; 'all ' watersj'.' and' have ' arrived ' at no ') ; pther ; conclusion than ' that he is a ' .first class oarsinari, can strike' the !. water'' as . quickly as any of ' ? the ; others '?' that ' I , have: seen (and I have' seen them all) ?; in fact; I- have seen1 hiin doing 'hard, 'spins' from, almost every point of the'riyerj' and nave counted his strokes!,1 whieh;yary.'frpm' thirty-eight to twenty7fpiir per minute.0, When .striking' the'.fbrmer he is uttbp' speed, and geto ' wbndbrf ul pace ;'liis',arms are well extended and his swing- is'perfect, and no faiiltsarb visible, but when' doing twenty-four his arms are' straight, ' his back also, and he does not use' his 'slide /fully. ' Anyone seeirig. hini in tliis position would arrive at no other conclusion than 'that he could not beat any one of oiir sculler's, 'Poarce in cluded,' but do not he led away by any such notions, for he is' really rowing, well and strong, with plerity.bf pace ; and in my opinion whoever beats him from Charity Point to Brothers . will be glad to see George Mulh'all !' or Jimmy Ricliiiids lower the flag which denotes the, race over. Of Hanlan I have ' also seen a crreat deal, and he is rowing with the same grace and swing which is so characteristic with hiin. Al though I am inclined to believe at, times that he has fallen into a vory, bad habit of 'jerking' at the end of liis stroke, which tends to bury the boat, 'instead of .lifting, notwithstaridirig- this,'he is looking and moving along well, /and I believe that if he is beaten, and whoever beats ,him, will beat Edward Hanlan,' the renowned oarsman of the world,' and not his ghost, which wo saw in August last.' 'Beach,' the champion sculler of the world,, is. doing good, work from Gascoigne's daily, under the tutorship of Messenger ; but/as Beach is only com mencing' his , troubles, we cannot, expect much fast work at present, although he ap pears to be iri: good health and spirits, and jnoving along strongly. . Laycock, who ac companies Hanlan twice a 'day in his work, is beginning. to look more like him self, arid is rowirig much better than lately described, in a /'weekly/ : /How is it possible 'to, write ori.Laycock's: form and conditiori without first consulting them selves as to his real, state of health, viz., that sirice [we saw^ him perform so well he has had the. misfortune to break his leg, then he started to run' the 'Bell's Tavern,'' at Woollpoinoolob Bay, which was a very bad move for him, after, living in such a healthy place as 'Shark Island,' where he could . go to bed at what hour he, liked, and get up iri the mornirigandhavea bathe in hhe salt woter, and a row if ho folt inclined. This he must have missed, considerably when. at the 'f Bells.' ;/ After this long spell he tries to row'Hanlan, and because he can't hold him and- show the same pace as he did IB, riionths ago, his form is. con deinned, evidently; without thinking/ over these matters,' which I have briefly men tioned, and which I, note only iri fair j' play, andjustice'tb Laycpclc, , who lias done so much to bring the cbloriy /so prominently before the aquatic .world,' V '.. . . . ;As the. time ; for. the frace draws nigh, numbers of persons find' th^ir way up the river in the afternoon ta jyitness ? the men at practice ; but ,no,ineyf[ trials ;have yet been indulgedin. , Hanlan. pulled a good strong .pace, right, over the .course on Wednesday, /and, is getting into good' buckle.

The- water- was very rough . at the time ;. and this, together .with tlio fact ? .oh his' having rowed his1 boat for the first time, made it'impdssiblo to bbtaia a proper idea of hisstyle.' ' Fvor all' this, it was asplendid performance, arid, Clifford sliowed so iriucli stay tliat he may .be relied , , on . to , , make ' a hot race. The /Canadian- will find that there is rnoro thari;one sticker in- Australia, and possibly a successful one. Clifford . does much of his rowing with his arms, and to- this- he is, -perhaps; unconsciously1 addicted owing to .the groat breadth of ?' histi shoulders arid the, length of hife: reach.
