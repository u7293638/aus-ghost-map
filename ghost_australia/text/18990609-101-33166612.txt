OUR SERIAL STORY. THE FACE AT THE WINDOW. BY WELLESLEY PAIN. (COPYRIGHT.) (Continued.) A week had gone by. Charlie's inves- tigations in the neighbourhood of Char teringham had resulted in a few dis- coveries, and a somewhat unfortunate occurrence. By the aid of seme local policemen and afew gamekeepers, Charlie had found that the country for fifteen ruileearound Charteringbamhad recently been visited by an expert gang of poach-» ers. Three important burglaries of an unusually daring nature had also been I committed. No arrests had been made> j and thejjolioe had not yet found a clue j to work upon. The poachers had also escaped detection, and Charlie was de- lighted to hear this. There was just a [ chance that he would. be able to find and rescue , his .brother- in-law, whose real j name ^aB Charles Bestall. The pro- prietor of. the circus had'altered " Best all " to 7 Bestelle " for buBiness.purposes. }. The unfortunate, occurrence inferred to was à little love affair. On the very first day of the searob/Charlie had" »ade' the, mistake of falling completely in love with the daughter of the head game- keeper on the Browby estates. He was probably almost unaware of the fact at the time. Its' immediate effect on hiin was to convince him that Browby was the place in which he ought to pursue his search for Charles Bestall. He re- mained in Browby for a week, and he had the misfortune to meet the head game-keeper several ' times at places within a stone's throw of that worthy man's cottage. The head gamekeeper grew suspicious.7 Another week passed, and CharleB Bes- tall wai not: yet - found. ! Charlie still, found it necessary to con-" duct bis inquiries in the neighbour- hood pf Browby. His hobby was litany, and he had obtained' permission from Lord Browby'e steward to make excur- sions into the Browby woods for scientific ?' urposes. Ainiea with this permission e was able to go where he wished to ; but on several óccasibng he found himself w^îki^ .towaiâs Ihçl head gamekeeper's ojitagè, *hè shortost W&y;&y; ceytaiiv. i>îaçes^: in the ttraods. andfh^f£^^ to ÎBabel Thornhill, the keepers daughter. He wrote to'hte sMerpvery day ah'di^; ceived eoine letters-from her. Th ey Ml eaidthe same thing : " Bring my^ hus- band back to me. My' girl is dying. Bring him before its toe late," ". . ? To these letters Charlie always replied' as hopefully as circumstances would per- mit. He did not consider it necessary to, tell his sister that the one topic of con- versation among' the keepers on the Browby esjates ^as the probable capture bf a band of reckless poachers, who uutil now had wofke^â^^terïjr and without fearr bf being CRigg%^fe^wished te make hie lj^ià^n^>:^^^éivia\, and he wrote atsdmèlengjh ftbout his own doings and his new acquaintance. At first his sister was ; vexed when she received these letters. It was possible for anyone who chose toread between the lines to see that Charlie was neglect- ing his real mission-to find Charles Bestell-in order to fall in love with Isabel Thornhill \ But his sister soon learned to rejoice secretly at her brother's love affair. She had had trouble ; she had '- deserved it. She had no. right to expect him to efface himself for her good. A feeling bf re eignation caine tb her; ehe grew accus- tomed to receive letters ' about Isabel Thornhill and not about her husband. She smiled to herself as she read these letters, and resolved that she would do nothing to cloud the happiness of the writer of them. . So it.was that, when one day, "owing tb indisposition" ac the ring-master put it, Madame Bestelle did not perform, she was careful'to. avoid mentioning the fact to her brother. It was true that Madame Bestelle was indisposed, but it was only , half true, for it was on that, af ternoón that the Queen of the Slack "Wire left her caravan and followed the body of her dead baby to its grave. Another week went by and still Charles Bestall was not found. All the local papers and most of the London dailies contained a judiciously worded advertisement in their agony columns addresed to him, but aB yet these had met with no response. The excitement among the natives of Browby occasioned by the presence of expert poachers and burglars in their midst was incrensed-as each day went by and no rr s were nlade.'.

Then to his horror, the words of the next speaker became more distinct. Themen were coming slowly towards the very spot on which he was standing! He had no time to consider his best coarse of action ; the men wera almost upotí him. Quickly and noiselessly he crept behind a small bush and lay down. In another moment the two men came up to him and one of them kicked against his leg in passing. Charlie doubledhis fists -they were his only weapons- and held himself ready to spring up. Sut the men had pased on ina moment; Charlie had not been discovered. He listened intently to all they said, but was unable to hear more than a few sentences, "as the men we're walking quickly. Those few sen- tences; however were these that behad for many days. wished to hear. . ??- As soon as the men had gone, Charlie/ crept cautiously from his hiding-place, and getting to open country ran at his top-speed to the head gamekeeper's ' cottage.

He had no wish to make ms way'through the woods to "Double StUe " until it was absolutely necessary that he should leave the high road. He knew the exact ' spot at which he would have to enter'tiié woods. He sauntered slowly along and tried to think of anything else but the work in hand, for in truth the nearer begot to " Double Stile " the less firm became his resolution to go there. The night was black and forbidding; he was alone and unarmed. It had occuredto him that by reaching the place carly in the evening he might possibly- he able to prevent a disturbance.

He walked quickly along a narrow path in the midst of a thickly wooded copse. At the end of this path there was a stump of a tree. He sat down on this and waited, for he was now within fifty yards of "Double Stile.",; : The night was still; he was able tb hear his watch ticking,, and" he thought that Ms heart-beats - were * keeping time with it.

He rushed at his assailant, and the two men closed. But it was only for'a moment. There was another rustling in in the bushes behind them, and a man sprang out to separate them. He grasped Charlie by the collar, swung him loose from Thornhill's grip, and threw him, stunned and bleeding, on to the soft turf, where he lay motionless. Then the stranger turned his atten ' tiou to Thornhill, but this time he used no force. He placed one arm round ThornhiU's. waist, «and steadied him. Then he assured him quietly that his daughter was quite safe, and that his antagonist was at the present moment i senseless. Ti be had-reversed the state- ment it would have been equally true, j since Miss Isabel Thornhill had fainted away SB soon as ber father had appeared 1 on the scene.
