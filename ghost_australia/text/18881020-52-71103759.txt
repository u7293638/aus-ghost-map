The Phantom Ship. * Sometimes when dawn breaks oold and grim, Where billows moan o'er seamen's graves, There loom up on the horizon's brim Huge sails and cobweb oordage dim ; . And she comos travelling through the waves» Turret and port-hole, mast and Bpar, Orer the Bea they riBe and dip ; While fade tho moon and the morning star ; And oh, but bodiless SOUIB they are Who man the dooks of tho Phantom Ship. - Far out across th' untraverß'd seas, And shoreward where the slumbering tide Ebbs through the roots of tropic trees, .?>. Or flows in the light that oities at ease> Oast from their banquet-ohambers wide« And through toss'd ioe and spear-sharp sleet For evermore the Bhip muse go, Her decks reoord no sound of foot j Only for aye the waters beat Upon her prow, now loud, now low. Onoe 'twas tho prayer of mariners "Blind be our oyno to yon groat boat, Seek not to know what cargo's hers, Though it be ebony, ßilvor, f ars ! " Onoe 'twas a prayer with men afloat, " OuesB not tho riddle that lurks therein, Whether hor folk wero gluttonous, Whether they died atrango gold to win P Know 'tis the ghost of an anoient sin Round the paro seas pursuing us !"
