I THE HOUSE OF CROMWELL, FROM THE " SPECTATOR.") In his Bowe of Cromwell Mr Waylen has given us a delightful book on a delightful subject Let no potential render expect from the title there is nothing here but a bare chronicle of the minds of those in whose veins runs run, and still runs, the blood of the Protector Mr Waylen gives us that, but he gives us a good deal more His book is full, from the first page to the last with matter illustrating that most fascinating of historic problematic personality of Cromwell 61 he book, then is one which has remedies not only for the few who love to trace the links in the chain of flesh that binds the present to the past, and to contemplate themselves and their fellows as but the latest manifestations of posterity-it appeals to every 1 englishman who loves and venerated and who is there if he will but " give his heart its rights, ' who does not love and venerate the greatest captain in arms and the noblest wielder of sovereign power that ever held away in these islands . There is no name in the long and splendid story of our race, unless it be that of Mr Lincoln, which can claim more respect for wisdom, for true patriotism and for dutifulness in the highest in name than the Protectors His figure is a beacon light for Lngbalinipn in its strength, in its wide tolerance, in its gentleness and in its liberalism And more especially can the remembrance of Cromwell help the England of to day. He was the first though most cruel of Unionists His prescience and states manship realised that the two great islands of the Atlantic are link ed indissoluble by fate, and that the more perfect and complete is made their union the better for both countries lie it was who first summoned members from Scotland and Ireland to meet with those of England in one Parliament it Westminster The too, gave us one flag-the flag which he ordered to bear the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland ' united Hence no record of Cromwell and those who derive their descent from him can be unwelcome or unworthy of the study of his countrymen It is curious to note how many members of the governing class in modern times have Cromwell's blood in their veins His descendants have given England a Prime Minister, Lord Goderich, a Chancellor of the 1 Exchequer, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, as Foreign Secretary Lord Clarendon , a great reformer and champion of free trade Sir Charles Villiers, a Governor General of India, Lord Ripon a Viceroy of Ireland, Lord Cowper It is true that I Lord Goderich " the transient and embarrassed phantom ' of Mr Disraeli was not a very Cromwellian figure but considering the manner in which the Cromwell family was kept under during the first hundred years after the -restoration this record of em mence in the service of the country is very remarkable If we were to recapitulate the peers and baronets, the admirals and generals, and the persons distinguished in law ordering), who find or have the blood of Cromwell we should require space for a very formidable list The living descendants of Cromwell already number many hundreds and in another twenty years it is not impossible that they may have i increased to thousands Hence all fear that the line will ever become extinct may be banished These descents are of course all through the female, the last male descendant Mr Cromwell of Cheshunt, having died in 1821 Since, however, the Queen only represents the kin of Cedric of Alfred of William the Conqueror, of Henry Tudor, end of Charles Stuart through the female, it is absurd to speak of a Cromwellian descent through the female as Homcthmjr too remote to be worth remembering It may be mentioned that, but for a piece of mean spiritedness on the part of George III, we should still have a Cromwell by name as well as by blood 'He lost Mr Cromwell was anxious that his daughter and heiress should take his name and transmit it to her children The following 13 Mr Waylen s account of the circumstances which prevented his wish being carried out After recounting the deaths of Mr Cromwell s two sons, Mr Waylen continues -" Under these circumstances it is not surprising that Mr Cromwell of Cheshunt, should wish his daughter to carry it on, in accordance with the course usually pursued in such cases by her husband a adopting the surname and arms of Cromwell either in addition to or in exchange for those of Russell Such a procedure is technically said to be by royal permission and though royalty seldom interferes in such matters, yet here was a case in which royalty s instinct-, seemed suddenly aw ski ned to the susceptibility of an unaccustomed chord '1 rue, it was a chord whose vibrations responded to the mere ghost of a name But what animal Has it over been other than a word of omen to royal time during the last two centuries? 'the issue of the affair is thus records 1 by Mr Burke the herald -'Mr Cromwell wishing to perpetuate the name of his great ancestor, applied it! is said in the usual quarter for permission that his son in law should assume the surname of Cromwell, when to his astonishment, considering that such requests are usually granted on the payment of certain fees as a matter of course, the permission was refused Such a course of proceeding is too contemptible for comment.-lluloru of the Commoners, Vol I, p 413 he credit of the refusal has been variously ascribed to the old King to the Prince Regent, and to William IV Sir Robert Heron writing 1111812 makes mention of it thus Within the last two or three years died the last male direct descendant of Oliver Cromwell He was well known to my father and to Sir Abraham Hume, who lived near him They represented him as a worthy man of mild manners, much resembling in character his mind dint, ancestor Harry the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Early in life his pecuniary circumstances were narrowed, but utterly he possessed a comfortable in come He was desirous of leaving his name to his son-in-law, Mr Russell, and applied for His Meribah permission that Russell should assume it, but the old King positively refused it, always saying No no no more Cromwell's ' Sir Robert Herons Xoles Another version of the affair is that Mr Cromvv eil becoming apprehensive that the chance of name might alter nil prove a hindrance rather than other wise to him grandchildren s advance in life, allowed the matter to remain in abeyance , but that the scheme was revived by another member of the family in a memorial addressed to William IV and that it was this Kingnndnot George III who uttered the energetic etc above recorded This refusal may be regarded as the last attempt on the part of the bones and the Crown to depress the Protectors family throughout the eighteenth century it is clear that the family suffered a good deal, and that it was usually thought safer for its members to keep quiet A pleasant story of the great Lord Hardwicke s conduct in checking the petty per secution of the Ciomwills is worth quoting -" Lord Chancellor Hardwicke once heard a still in which the grandson of the Protector Oliver was a party Hit opposing counsel, thinking to make way with the jury by scandalising Olivers memory, was running on in the accustomed style, when Lord Hardwicke effectually checked lumby sly 117- I perceive Mr Cromwell Is standing outside the 1 nr nil inconveniently pressed by the crowd Make way for him that he may of me as I sit on the bench I the representative of the family accordingly took his place 1 eside tin judge and the orator changed his tone Before having the subject of Cn mu el a descent hints, we may note that Sir W of him Harcourt and the late Lord Lytton are both connected with the House of Cromwell I he first Lady Harcourt was descended from the Protector, as is the widow of file Into Ambassador 111 Paris We must also mention the curious circumstances of the intermarriage in the fourth descent of Oliver s posterity and King Charles s and of the men mixture of Hyde and Cromwell blood What misery and humiliation would not the first lord Clarendon have suffered could he have known that his descendants wool 1 intermarry with those of the Usurper and that the children of this intermixture would rig in their descent from the Protector with far greater price than that from the Chancellor of Charles II '
