T'HE 'LATEST GHIOST. A thrilling tale of terror comes from the preelnots of Grenville College. Thursday night, was already spreading its shadow overthose studious walls, when a doleful figuere some 5 feet 8 inches in height, and clad in the orthodox white livery of ' per turbed spirits," appeared to the astonished gaze, of, some eighteen of the pupils. Ghastly, iinstbstantial, but too real in appearance, Its'presence chilled the life current in the veins of the boldest. A champion boy, however, wont forward to in'vestlgate, and the ghost ." materialized" -as' the' mediums say-and exhibited corporeal functions unmistakeably, by knocking him'over. Two more youthful heroes braved its supernatural wrath by rushing towarids'thbir fallen comrade, and the ghost'adopted the discreet 'course of runing (it should be'gliding) down the Gnarr creek' as the bell rang for study. About 20 ninutes 'pist 9 p.m., the un canny visitor returned in like. fearful guisio,' id;this time .t was 'chased into wilddr epacesby twd of the mators. 'And doubtlosd the ghost'would have succumbed to'ttieirprowess';, only 'unfortunately, the grouiid was alippery and both the pursuere fell.on ithe road to' narr, Creek.
