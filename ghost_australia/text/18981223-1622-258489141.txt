G R E E T I N G S . A MERRY XMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR." TJHERE IS nothing remarkably original in the salutation, but it is just as original as most of the expressions which find a place in ninety-nine out of every hundred articles written at this festive season. Seme few of'outreaders doubtless expect a great deal more from us. They may hunger for chunks of ancient doggerel that have boen hashed and re-hashed & thousand times; they may desire to see the " blazing Yule log" dragged forth from its congenial hearth in frigid regions to the caloric atmosphere in which Welt Australians live and perspire. Buc we are not going to do it. They may, perhaps, long for invidious comparisons between the frost and snow of the Motherland and the heat and dust of this country. We are too patriotic to lend ourselves to anything of the kind-, It may be thought that we should extol the virtues of roast beef and plum-pudding, and introduce|Santa Claus, and fly into ecstacies over the " ivied towers" and " pealing bells," and " bracken," and "moss" of some* place ten thou- sand miles away. But life is too short, and our • imagination too blunt for this sort of thing. Besides, we don't think it would help our subscribers to enjoy their Christmas dinner if they were reminded that another part of the world is like an ice-chest, while the thermometer is up in the hundreds here. Nor can the majority of our readers be nervously anxious for allusions to beef—roast, tinned, or otherwise—seeing that they get it almost every day in some shape or form, and as regards plum-pudding, we don't want to raise up the ghosts of indigestion and biliousness to haunt the dyspeptic ot our esteemed clientele. So we shall simply repeat the words of greeting in our opening sentence, and wish every man and woman who deserves it L! A MERRY XMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR."
