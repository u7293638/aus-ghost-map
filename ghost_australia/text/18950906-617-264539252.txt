He and another Australian were the first wheelmen everts invade the Holy Land. He has the rare gift of being singularly graphic in his descriptions of men and places he has met and seen ; and an hour or two is well spent in his pleasant society. He has been in some " tight pinches" at times, more especially in the East, where on two occasions he had to use a trusty six shooter. At a meeting, of the Dairymen's Associa. tion held in Melbourne last week a board of advice was appointed to assist the Minister of Agriculture in matters relating to the dairying industry. . i5 > ' \- The following aiiimsM imsM are.impound'ea'Si/ are.lmpoundi and if not' claimed and . expenses paid will be sold on the 26th instant:—One red cow, white about belly, TP off rump ;, roan cow, W. near rump; red steer, C off rump, both eijrs nicked ; red Steer, TS off rump ; five nri and white calves no visible brands. .

" ' " '; v • Municipal life is very much misunderstood (sayB the Age). There is no entf of people who believe that the life of.a mupi; cipal councillor is even a more glorified existence than that of a departmental trotter; and that when not engaged in rolling a huge log to one place or another ,he.is refreshing himself at tbe mayor's cupboard. : Indignant ratepayers, who write letters to the newspapers, call these exertions "pleasant." That is where the mistake is made. A bear pit, a dog fight or a' Home Rule meeting is an orderly, and harmonionB scene contrasted wjt&Sonigj; cotiDcil meetings. It is on record that Macreedy, before appearing in the quarrel scene between Brutus and CaBsiuSr used to work liimRelf iuto a passion behind the scenes by fiercely shuking a ladder. -Now if municipal councillors did not love Biich violent exercise as log rolling there, tempers, would he sweeter, and tliert would bfe leis' need for lubricating themselves with whisky out of the mayorul cupboard Pro- Ijiilijxy the Macreedy incident is not known in municipal circles.

Mr Archer, who appeared for defendant, agreed to the usual warrant issuing and therefore no evidence was taken. Plaintiff was allowed £1 3?.6d costs. L. Eenton proceeded against W. M.

Defendent did not appear, Plaintiff stated that since issuing thesum-t iiioife Slie had received portion of the goods.
