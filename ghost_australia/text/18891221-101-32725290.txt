Swynford gets'quite as much pleasure ont of' the city as we do this side Temple Bar, and I am quite sure he would find as much real enjoyment in Yenice as we shall. Don't think, iny dear llr., Swynford, that I imagine my profession b a more noble one than yours. On reflection, and notwithstand- ing what I said a little while since, I am inclined to think trade, business, finance, har? the. best of it. I sometimes wonder if painting and acting and writing novels and plays, and indeed if all the other fields of art are not the mere playgrounds of men who think they are tilling a splendid soil, and after all do not succeed in providing mankind with either food or raiment; they, are not producers who ,â^f ^^ôkjA ^^^iiht^gtokpo coro» men who make life worth living. What is the moneyed niau's highest ambition? to surround himself first with their work and then with the artista themselves; which bring its back to the Veneliru question./ Those old fellows of the great Republic : they knew how to combine trade with art, how to glorify monev, how to make it and how to spend it. ts it settled, '.Forsyth, that you are to be one of our iittle party P We go nest month, Our plan at present is not to stop unt;l we get w> Milan; then on to Verona; next to, Venice ; stay there six or eight weeks, -.and after a run through the Lukes, return via Switzerland and Paris.

X should ¿ike to go ; indeed, it is one of the "dreamaiof my life that I would like to realise* " Youl have a good many dreams, you fellows who paint-," replied Swynford. "Te^said Phil, his mind running on the face of his sketch, " any fellow might, be. excused for dreaming over his cigars at Miloanke's, not to mention his claret. ' What a.; capitaj dinner you have given ns. But yob^ cook is a treasure." \- Philip felt he must make ah effort to get aw/ty from, hts picture.

" Bull or bear in that stock P" said Sam Swynford to himself as the three left the room,/v; ?' I suppose he will take the pool ; jtist^iuck?* « Mr. Swynford was a stoek-broker and he looked it. 'There was a certain city go and swagger in his mannor, which gave confitbluco to his customers and made Sam. welcome - both in artistic society and amoujcditp city friends. He was breezy and alive with aiimalspirits, dressed well, worea flower in his buttou bole summer ; and wiuter. and wa%always groomed "tip .to inequities," AS some of the most slangy of his acquaintances described the polish of Ins^boots, bia waxed moustache, : his clo3e-cr.»pped hair, and hts tvel!-brushed coats; . He was what would be termed a you% mao* with a fair comp'exiou, and accordingly ion that account MM.

Sam was of meduun: height, iuullued to be what is called s*tout, Wai broad of shoulder, his hands of ' a generous . type, and he had a fat qheery laugh. He wore tight costa, a .showy Watch chain, and carried a big silver-mounted stick. On¡ the preíent occisiou his dress clothes were in the he^g'it of fashion »ilk f acings silk ollar andi white ved;, with a siaglu small gem tu the way of a stud' for his immaculate shirt front. His somewhat i{orid cheeks shone wi'ii health, his 'grey eye* sparkled with his hosi's wine. jBEe had no pecutiari»ies of inauucr, hut* was a type of a fairly-bred ycuug .Ëugiishtnau, iu a big way of business, perfectly'* at home with himself except wheii he was near D«illy Nore >tt, with whou) lib wa« over head and ears in love; and without, as he,feared, tin remotest, chance qi ever winujug even her esteem, he 'yet Jthought of the possibility of making "a - heap of money for her, when ever.TiQ 'entered upon a more thau ordi- nary, large hasard either as a bull or a 'bear.* He had never dreamt of proposing to IM jj-, because she had more than once Îriven Rim to understand that auy fami iarity of that kind would be fatal to their friendship ; that she was not for him in any other capacity than one of friendship;, that as a friend she liked him batter than any other of her brother in-law^ i guests, and she hoped he would not «omjpettier to ask Walter not ito in- vite * him .any more to Westbury Lodge. Although this had been said more or less jestinMy,* Sam kneW that for the time being Dolly meant it ; but he had a lurk- ing tope that in tho course of the chapter acctdentsMie might have a chance. Pos- sibly kis'cifcy experience encouraged him to thj'uk of his prospects in this way, because he had so often seen tho unex- pected happen, on the Stock Exchange and he .did,not see why the doctrine of chancea which .affected his operations there shpnld^ot also influence his specu- lations in regard to Dolly, the one line of matrbnpnja4< stock which he desired to inscribe in his hook of options. Some- how, .however, on this night of his latest little.¿Boner at Westbury Lodge he had his ^misgiwings . as to his prospects iu that quarter; but he made it a rule to appear cheerful and happy under all cir- cumstances, so ho sailed into the drawiug rpom after Philip and Walter, with tiie smile o£ Apparent confidence and nncon :,^h^'mäM:i0^mi^ ot the fdeeora much as to destroy the sense of comfort, Which is often sacrificed to artistic show, ît was neither a harmony in yellow^ nor a symphony in pink ; it was not an inspir- ation from Japan, nor a copy of a Chippendale idea adapted to parquette flooring and Queen Aune windows} there had beeu uo paragraphs in the Society papers about it ; probably neither. Mr. Whistler nor Mr. Menpe* had ever seen it, and if they had they would most likely have condemned it- -Never-, theless you felt that the decorator bad worked at it with artistic feeliug, and that the hostess iiad supplemented bis labours with ideas beyond the reach of art. There was a copper kettle singing ou an old hob-grate, a cluster oE caude labra ou the mantel, a sconce or two of gas on the walls, a dozeu or so flue examples of Cox. Haleswelle, Herkomer and Carot on the walls, a cabinet of, Veuetiau glass, a many-legged table with a Crown Derby coffea service upon it, and a dainty liquor case; the. floor was covered with Persian rugs, there was drawn up before the fire a big much cushioned seat; and the general, tone of the room was yellow,.but whether it was the yellow of warm light or the, yellow of curtaius and walls one did not think of iuqniring, though one might wonder about all this afterwards, reflecting on tito pretty, comfortable, unusual kind of room it was, Mrs. Milbanke was seated at a pretty.' tea table, lighted with a pretty epper lamp. Dolly was half buried iu an, .-asy chair with the last new book tu her.lap«. Swynford hoped she was enjoying Her literature. She looked up with a luU cbievous smile and said she was, thong'* she must confess it was full of saiuess, not to say horrors. Stepniak's " Russia/ auder the Czars," she continued, this timé turning her blue eyes to wards Philip, whó, of course, became immediately interested. Her sister had suggested the book as . à désirable oup to have lying about «mise, they had seen the sketch ou Philip's easel, and they had driven dow$ fyi Candie's for it before g>*iug homo after they had left the stu li» «hat very after* noon. It had. not taken Dolly half ah «tour, the.half hour after din uer, to get at the tone of the work, and tb know just enough-to let Philip vee that she was interested with the subjects that interest- ed him. " Yes," he replied, sitting down by her sine, " it is a painful subject, though pup might bo forgiven for cxpeii'iiig t/> find something noble in pages inscrit» id with such a title-hut there is in the re :ord of . inartydonts." Tiiere was something fateful iu Philip's appearance aud luauuer ; he was pale, his black hair was dishevelled, it foll , iii a great shock over his forehead, his long hands were particularly whit«, and there tras a poetic melancholy in thé expression of his sallow face that suggested hinch thought and work. All this made , him interesting in Dolly's estimation, and she was also taken by the air *»f distinction which seemed to belong t j those student* like characteristics which we^s so opp«, site to the happy profession tl air of her 1 brother-in-law, and of the swig city cheerfulness of Sam Swyuford, ot Lom 1 bard-street. " I have always been deeply concerned in regard to the fate of political prisoners in Russia," contiuued Philip, " and just now I am thiukiug of little else. I sup- pose there is a touch of selfishness iu this increased devotion, becausa I ant puttiug ray feeliug and my imagination into com« mission as it were; I hope they will assist me to carry off the Gold Medal." " Oh, that is the secret of the sketch we saw this afternoon ?" said Mrs. Mil« bauke. " You forgot to tell us ; or perhaps it is A secret." " Forsyth thought he would not spf»il a gojd subject for conversation this evening," chimed in the host. " Yes, my dear, I will have a cup of tea ; dou't approve of tea as a rule, ' but to-night we'll merry bc,' as the 6ong says, eh, Swynford?" Walter did not quite know what he was saying; not that he had had too much, wine, but his wife had been making signs at him, aurt he tried tj hide his nou uuderstanding of them under a ripple pf talk. " A good old song," he wout on ; " I remember my father singing it whon I was a boy at a birthday-yes, my dear, Mr. Swynford will take a cup of tea, and by tho way, Swynford, you are a judge of water colours. I would like to show you a little portfolio I bought last week-a collection of landscapes »nd figures-two little Turners, half a dozen David Cox's, a Calcolt, and a couple of sketches by Landseer ; here it is, my boy." ^ And Walter, having suddenly caught tho meaning of his wife's nod, had led Sam to the furthest ead of the vooui, away from Philip and Dolly, and was soou deep in tho mysteries of the portfolio in question., getting Sam's ideas of its value, not only artistically but financially, to father with hi» views of the present . uflatod ¿tato of the money market and othetjnatteViirof «uríoutiutorest..,» .. ' ¿C. tA«u,?.,. »I...,, v......t*J.Sjk*ù Ruèsiâ, Ule high-handed character dt what ! wäs termed administrative arrest, and what he intended to convey ia that sketch, in which the woman's face was so ' remarkable as to have set Jenny talking of j ndthing else ever since they had seen it. j Philip rode his hobby gracefully, with j eloquence . and with knowledge, and j paused more than once to note how ' . beautiful Dolly was, aud what a happy contrast were her red lips, her bright genial eyes and warm healthful flesh, compared with the woman of the opera, ''the ghost of Madam Lapukin," as Disk Chetwynd had styled her. ^Presently. Jenuy had drawn her chair dear tim two young people, to hear Philip's ? stpüy of this womau at the opera aud his desire to hare her aé a model for the face iii His medal picture ; aud by and by she led the conversation up to their trip to Italy abd. the poetic lnreliuess of Venice, whère she assured him he Would find a model in crery woman of the people whom ho met. ' She had only been to Venice once, and then only for a week, ' and she thought she had seen more beautiful wdinéti during those Seven days than ever sae liad seeu ia lier life before. ,'Ptóliri in re'gly coitld not resist the suggestion thdt it was not necessary to go to Venice to look for beauty; aud if he accompanied them ho should ask the favour of putting Dolly into a Venetian ßitcure, for so far as he was any judge jjt the peculiarities of the Venetian face M thought .Dolly herself possessed that curl of the.lip' Aixd that sunshine ! in the haïr which was supposed to bé thoroughly Venetian. Without seeming to say it, the clever little .matchmaker let Philip also under- stand that Dolly was also blessed with a certain, golden 'sunshine in the Three par cent's., which his mother, Lady Fdrayth, . thought an important item in the charms of marriageable youug ladies. r It is difficult to fathom the thoughts of mau, and to say whether the best of God's creatures is mercenary or not, whether tim . most virtuous may not be influenced now find'then hy tho worst passions. So far ap the narrator of this history is con- cerned, he is iuciiued to think Philip did not note the worldly hint of Mrs. Mil- bank*,' ol', if he did, that it had no njnueuce with him, though the hostess more than once make some passing \- reference to the responsibilities of marriage being so greatly lessened if there was money on both sides; or if there was money ou one side and genius ou the other, quite iu a more or less in- consequential way, getting in a reference to lap artist whom they bath knew who wita very clever but still could not sell his pictures, and what tm important thing it was in art for a man to be more or less independent of dealers, so that he could afford to follow the bent of his genius or his inclination, and do the work he liked best ; and BO on-an eloquent rush of worldly'wisdom, most useful in regard to young people about to contract a marriage, and especially to a couple of young people, the bride pretty, with money and social Position, and the bridegroom au artist, also wi'h social position, a little money, perhaps, and no end of genius aud ability, if he could only paint what he wished and be iudepeudent of tho Academy and dealers; and somehow Philip found him- self,' before lie quite knew where he was, diss'cussing thèse delicate mattere, as if ho or Dolly, or both, were personally concerned in them. Abd once, Dolly's hand being near Philipps he laid his upon hers, and she, not'withdrawing it, he pressed the fair hand,; »nd was very sensible of its soft pliability. The gentle pressure that responded to his, when he ventured a little further and took Dolly's hand fairly within his own, set his heart beating, and be forgot everything except Dolly and hts mother's praises of her. It came into his mind that it would please his mother very much if he married Dolly, and that she was very beautiful, had golden hair, a sweet voice, and cheerful manners, and that sometimes Fate met ono half way, as it were, and sometimes clapped one on the shoulder unawares, and that after all it would be a'pleasant Fate to bo entitled to take Dolly U ono's;arms, and have her for a lifelong companion.
