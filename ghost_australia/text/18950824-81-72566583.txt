CH AFTER1 ir: f , ûiV OAEUSD, OOHES HOME SADDLE EMPTY. THE night of 22nd of June, 1679, ahall never be forgotten among us white Eailstoun home Blanda. It was the ere nf the day whereon"befell the weary leaguer of Bothwell when the enemy beset; the brig, and the good Blue Banner gat .fyled and reddened with other dyestuff than the brown mosswater. I mind it well, fori had grown to be man-muckle since the day on the Tink lers' Loup. After a day nf heat there fell a night like pitch. A soughing wind went round the ¡house and round the,, house, ; whispering; snd groping, like a forlorn ghost trying to find his way within. - If there was a shut eye in the great house of jEarl»toun;that.nigbt,-_it_was. neither mine nor my mother's. Wa I ny and thought of them that were over the hill, striving^for the Other King and the good'cause. And our thoughts were prayers; though .there was ttone to take the Book'iri Earlstoun "that night, for I was never ' gifted that way. Sn we bedded without sound nf singing or voice "of prayer, though I think Jean Hamilton had done it for the asking. , I lay inmyj naked^bedian listened all ,the night witti unshut'eyeal*" I could hear in ¡my .mother's,, room..the boards tcreak'aa isbe. ruse .every "fluart^r .hour, and-,l<«ked.out into the ^rayles8*dark.',-^Mai8ie.^nnoxröf~tKe Duchrae, ,bM'7Lhtqh'saau^ well-grown lass, 'láy:with'her,:; iind ' Sandy V'young ' wife, Jean Hamilton, with her suakling bairn, waa in .the little anulad Chamber that opens off the turret, stair near by.

And when a bundle of reins slipped ' from the shelf and fell on my shoulders like a man's hand clapping on rn« unaware I cried, out l.ke a frightened hen and dropped- almost : to the ground: Yet, though l am' delicate and not overly well grown iu my body. I do not count myself a coward, even though my brother Sandy's courage be not mine.' " Blind eye, hard head " was ever his .ort, but I love ,to take my danger open-eyed 1 and standing tip-and as little nf it as possible. . As I went back-which I did instantly, leav ing the stable door swinging open-I beard my mother's voice again. She was calling aloud,"; and the sound of her voice was yearning'and full like that of a young woman.. ~ "L 'William!' she called, and again "*. Wit liam !"

Once 1 shot an eagle on Millyea, and I his mate, came and .called him even thus, .with a voice which was as soft as that of a cusbie dove, in the tall trees in the early summer, till I could have wept with sorrow at my deed. (TO BB CONTINUED.) . WHY DOOS ROLL IN CARRION.-A writer in an American journal says: "Dogs love to roll in carrion because it rids them nf fleas their most annoying pests. If, while afield with your dog, you would examine him care fully after he bas rolled in carrion, you will find the fleas crawling all over him in the most confused manner. All along the top nf the hack, right up to the nose you can see them as if they- were-mixed up "in some disinfecting powder.. Some think the dog rolls in carrion because he delights, in the smell. The smell swains to linger with the dog long snough tin rid him of "a "greaß many fleas. I have watched dogs carefully while afield and my experience is that the above is correct." . j l' * Fôr'îriflupnrà/ bron^tii^ «Bäm»i inícJnést and Ilung troubles generally . itberé*1 ia ' nothing! like Cavaaouga's Pulioaio Balsam.*
