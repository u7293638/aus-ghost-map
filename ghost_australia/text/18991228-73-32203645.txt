WESTRAL'WEEEL MEETING, MILLINGTON WINS THE WESTRAL. If there is anydoubt in the minds of the sporting public as to the Westral Meetig being the most important wheeling event on the goldfields, yes terday's racing, under the control of the committee of management of the Coolgardie Recreation Reserve, must help to remove any uncertai ty on that point. The Westral Wheel Meeting, like the Victorian Austral, has now' made quite a name for itself. Cycling clubs must not run away with the idea that it is only necessary to give goad prizes to enpure a large attendance of the public. Good management has much to do with the success of any meeting, and in that partictlar de partment the Westral Wheel Meeting shows out conspicuously. It is an an nual event looked forward to by cyclists and the public iii gelleral alike, and for the chief event of this meeting cyclists undergo many months' prepara tion, many of them attemipting to hoodwink the handicappers to gain a good -mark for the Westral Wheel: Race. Speaking of the management the secretaries geherally fall in for the blame if anything goes wrong 'with the working of the meeting; but in this mn stance the racing, and, indeed every thing connected with the meeting, were carried through withput a stoppage or hitch in .the proceedings. To Messrs T-ownley and Purdy much credit for the success of the tarrying out of the ar rangements is due, and they` were ably assisted by a posse of- hard-working ste wards, who kept a lynx eye on thetcom petitors, and brought up and fined many of them for careless riding. Falls were numerous, but fortunately -none of the riders were seriously' injured. It is safe to say that.never before has such a large-crowd been seen on the Cool gardie Recreation Reserve. Every train -from Kalgoorlie; was packed, and streams of people, taking 'advantage of the fine weather, thronged the road from the toolgardie station to the con vincing ground. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the track was lined round al= most three deep with people,)and the grandstand and enclosure were packed. There could not have been, less than 700? people on- the ground. - The racing was close and interesting, the finish of the Wheel Race particularly producing a capital race between the favorites, Millington and Marshall. The scratch ,racing, too, brought to -light the marveQous sprinting powers of Levien, and this rider mdst be labell ed dangerous in the 'handicap events - yet to be 'decided during the holidays. Millington and Marshall .-had been' backed by their party to win a-heap of money in-the big raceand it was ams ing to witness the-faces of Marshall's backers as he "kicked" out and left the field about i5o yards from home:' But Millington had to , be reckoned with. Picking up his machine smartly the latter went in pursuit. Slowly he gained on the leader, but as they flashed round the, turn for home Marshall held a -lead of fully a length, and, moreover; he had the advantage' of the inside run ning. This advantage, however, lost him the race. Riding too close to the embankment his front wheel .carried him off the track, and Millington, with a final effort, passed him and finally landed the big- stake. Millingjon's vic tory was principally due to the splendid pacing which was set for him. Smith quickly carried 'hiir'up to the leading divi ibn, and once there his friends were tisfied that he would win. He showed splendid judgment, and having peen penalised 20 yards for his win at the Boulder, his victory was all the more meritorious. Levien won a double) and in the Five Mile-Scratch Rate he did not give his opponents the ghost of a chance, his final sprint settling any show the opposition had of winning. We almost forgot to mention that Mr. Faahan provided an excellent luncheon with refreshments for the commrriittee and Press. Following are dietails of the racing : MAIWIirN RACE.
