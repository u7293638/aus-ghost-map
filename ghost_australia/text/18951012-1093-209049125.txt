During the past two or three, days credence has been given by the small boys of Port Ade laide and the neighborhood to a story that a ghost is abroad' after nightfall within the dis trict. It is not known how the rumor origi nated, but the, tale has spread with'remarkable rapidity, and /there is a notable absence-after dark of youngsters from the principal Streets where they had been accustomed to play. Messrs. George Wills & Co.-.have received cable advice from London of the arrival there on the 8th instant of the Lund's line steamer Culgoa. This steamer left Port' Adelaide on August 26, with the first parcels of the new season's wool clip, and has.thus made the passage in good time—43 days. At about 2.45 on Priday afternoon a horse attached to a trolly, which was loaded with goods and owned by Messrs. Lindow, Bishop, and Co., wholesale grocers, of Glubhouse lane, bolted out of .their yard down-the lane and across Hindley-street and on to the foot path in front of Mr. Howie's drapery shop, smashing one of the castiron lampposts and striking the verandah, which fell on top of the trolly. The horse then stopped, and no further damage resulted. Mr. Howie at once engaged workmen to clear away the wreckage, and intends to at once repair all damages.
