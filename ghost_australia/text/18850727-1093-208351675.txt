THE SALVATION ARMY. TO THE EDITOE. Sirâ€”Allow me to sympathise with the Kev. T. Lloyd re the annoyance of the Salvation Army. Poor gentleman, I do pity him sincerely when I think that the brass instru ments and big drum of the army have caused him (a minister of the Gospel) so much more distraction than the loss of the immortal souls of poor sinners who the players of those self same brass instruments and the beater of that dreadful drum are trying their hardest to save in their way, even if not in exactly the way Mr. Lloyd would have them; but of course they should let souls perish rather than annoy the "decent and orderly" rev. gentleman and his congregation. Well, what I hope for Mr. Lloyd is, not that the army should leave Kapunda, or stop beating the drum (for even that instrument of torture has been the indirect means of the conversion of some poor souls), but that Mr. Lloyd may get such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that he will join heart and soul with the Salvation Army in trying to save poor fallen humanity, and even beat that awful drum himself, if by that means he could bring souls to Christ, who suffered so much for him; but for whom Mr. Lloyd, like the priests of old, cannot stand even Christ's praises sung and played in any but the orthodox fashion. I think we all, as "Christians, would do well to learn a lesson from Paul, who cared not in what way or by whom it was done, if only Christ were preached. I am not a member of the Salvation Army, but every effort made by any church or people to win souls for Christ has my best wishes for its welfare. So I say success to the Salvation Army; may God bless and prosper it, for it is reaching and saving a class of people whom our churches, with their set forms and proud pastors, never could reach. Then do not let us stand in their way, but give them all the help we can, even though they do work differently from what we should do.' -I am, &c;,, F. Z. H. Booleroo, July IS, ISSo.
