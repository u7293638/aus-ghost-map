? THH OPXSA.—The change in the class of entertainment at the Theatre Royal has brought with it a marked contrast in tbe composition of the auditory. Instead of seeing the boxes scantily filled as they were during the reign of the sensational dramas we have been treated to during the last two months, this part of the house, as well as the stalls, pit, and gallery, have been well filled during the two nights of " Maritana. Last night the attendance was a brilliant one, and tl-e ever-popular opera, with its many beautiful airs, was received with a good deal of enthusiasm by the house, whick was especially liberal in _ its applause when the leading characters in the piere presented themselves on the stage. To-night the "Rose of Castile" will take the place of " Maritina," and in it Madame Rose Hersee will make her first appearance this season. PBOFESSOB PBPPBB'S GHOST.—Last evening a large audience assembled at Garner's Theatre to witness the second representation in Adelaide of Professor Pepper's Ghost. The spectral illusion was received with every expression of satisfaction, as were also the representations of celebrated ancient and modern statues, the colourchanges, and the various illustrated ghost-storieB which enlivened the entertainment. Every one present seemed to thoroughly enjoy the evening's amusement, rendered the more pleasing by tbe dry jokes with which the Professor interlards his lecture. To-night the same programme is repeated. ALIIEET ETAIX, GERMAN CLUBHOUSE. The members of the Adelaide Liedertafel will give a concert in the Albert Hall, Pirie-street, this evening.
