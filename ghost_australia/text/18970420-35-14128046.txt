Tho Convention met it 1Ü 30 this morning, the rrooidont (Mr Kingston) being m the chair HIE COMMONWrALTH DILL IN COM MI11 HE lhe Convention went into committee on the Com- monwealth Constitution Bill POWERS OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT On clause SI, which dealt with th« exclusivo nowera of tho Tedcral Parliament, Mr Isaacs said ho did not agroo with Mr Bar- ton's interpretation of tho Atnorican Constitution with regard to the power to restruu Congre"« from imposing an export duty on goods sent from ono State to mother As the result of a confereneu hold at FhiUlulphiiit «ii held that a State should le allowed 11 impose an pxpoit dutv on goods -eut to a foreign couutn provided tho Stitu got tho con- sent of Congress to do so It «as only right th it the Federal Parliament should not interfere with the production of States and their etporta to foreign countries The clause was agreed to, as was also clause 55, relating to the Royal assent being given to bills, and clause 56, providing for the disallowance by order of law assented to by the Governor-General. On clause 67, which provided that a bill reserved for the Queen's consent shall not become law until within two years from the timo it is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, Mr Reid said that two years was too long a time to hang up a bill after it had passed the Federal Parliament. Hence he moved that the period be reduced to one year. Mr Lewis said it would be inadvisable to accept the amendment, as it was possible that a bill might lead to such a largo amount of correspondence between home Government and the Federal Parliament that it could not be completed in a year. Mr Kingston said he agreed with Mr Reid, and hold that the effect of curtailing the time would be to got the hill ««scnted to sooner than would other- wise bo the caso Mr lteid's amendment was negatived on division by 17 to Iß votes riNANOE AND lltADE At tho lequcst of Mr Keid cbaplcra 2 and 3, dealing with the E~icutive Government mid the Federal Tudtcisi), «ire postponed 11 j cnnit of the flnanc ni el mies of the bill 1 eiug considered C1 luses 79, 81), and 81 were agreed ti without di»cu«sion, as they were rucroly machinery rieuses On clause b., which pro, idos that the Common - «eilth (hall havo e-sclnsive power to low duties of customs and excise and offer bounties ittcr a cer tiiu time, Sir George furner said the claude as draw n would limit the power ot a State to nrposo an excise duly on articles subject to tho eustoms «Ititi I hi« would bo a great drawback, as it was possibío a State might desire to impose an excise duty on an article on which no unpoit duty wa« imposed He thero foro moved the omission of the words *' and upon goo Is for the time being the subject of customs duties " The amendment was agreed to, and the first three paragraphs of the clau»e weio agreed to after debate Upiu tho fourth paragraph, ptoviding that " upon the imposition of uniform duti°s ot customs all laws of the several States imposing nuties of customs or duties i f excise upon goods the subject of customs duties and all such law a offering bounties upon the production or etport of goods shall cease to hav e effect Sir George furner said this raised the very im- portant question of prot ctn g existing bouutv arrangements Where a colony had already entered into an rrungement of the kind, such an ingé- nient should certainly be proteoto I, otheiwiso by ofTenng a bounty they might; start a now iudusir\ , and it the bounty suddenly ceased the lndustrv might bu ruined Sir John Downer said the drafting committee would bo grail to prepare an amendment for Sir George ' uruer but he did not think ono member of the drafting committcB would support it lor it would enable a coach and four to be elmon through tlio bill By conceding the right to the colonies to givo bounties they might have infero >!onial freo trade the polnv of the Commonwealth-handicapped by the various colonies to an liideliuite extent Mr Simon Fraser O letona; said unclonbtedlj the existing bountio-i oucht to bo protected, but he agreed that no future bounties should bo imposed by individual colonies Mr \Vi«e riioio is no objection to that.

They were all agreed that the existing bounty contracts should be pro- tected, and that a limit of time should be put to the granting of new bounties, and that mining bonuses should be exempted. Would it not be better for the drafting committee to draw up a proviso to that eftect? Mr Higgins proposed as an addition at the end of the clause the following provis, - "But this sub- section shall not prevent any bounties for the discovery of gold or minerals, nor shall it prejudice any contract of a state to give bounties if made before the 31st of March, 1897 " Such bounties would not be for the production or export of gold, but merely for discovery. Mr Deakin said the word "discovery" was rather limited. He suggested "search for, or dis- covery." Sir Edward Braddon withdrew his amendment. Mr Kingston said he was not disposed to agree at all with the limitations proposed to be imposed on the States with reference to the offering of bounties No doubt it was put fairly enough that the effect of a State offering bounties must be to some extent felt in the local market, but protective duties and the offering of bounties were adopted for precisely oppsite objects. Protection secured to them their local market, end it was wisely provided that there should be intercolonial freetrade but an equally important matter was the development of their export trade, and he thought a slight interference with the freedom of trade which might result from the offering of bounties or exports was as nothing compared with the importance of develop- ing their export trade. They were making a mistake in laying down a hard and fast rule that the States should not give bounties for export trade. Where was that goining to stop ? (Voices "Hear hear that is just the point") It was stated they would not bo able to offer anything in the way of preferential rates to producers for ex- port. What about State export departments ? Were they to be abolished ? Mr. Read said they could fix their own railway rates so far as they affected their own producers to their own seaboard. Mr Kingston: Mr Reid was very ready to object to trusting the Commonwealth when we proposed that the right of New South Wales to use our waters should be controlled by the Commonwealth (Loud laughter) It was all very well to laugh, but that matter had not yet been settled. The States should have the right to grant bounties, and it would be an unnecessary interference with the rights of the States for the Commonwealth to regulate these matters Mr Reid said he thought their friends from South Australia were so steadily developing the tone and attitude of martyrs it was time he reminded them that in New South Wales they were prepared to leave matters vitally affecting the inhabitants of that colony to the Commonnwealth Parliament. With the odds against New South Wales, things they held very dear as a freetrade community they were pre- pared to expose to the risk of a policy which the majority of the people of Now South Wales would be the last to accept. The people of New South Wales did that in the interests of federation. They left the whole policy of trade and bounties at the mercy of the federation (Hear, hear) South Australians began to feel timid about bounties, but why should they when every one of the colonies was agreed on that point, and had adopted a system of bounties ? New South Wales, as well as South Aus- tralia, had established a department of State for ex- port, so where was the necessity for fear that South Australian interests would be sacrificed ? (Hear, hear. ) He hoped Mr Kingston would remember that other people were taking greater risk in that matter than South Australia. Mr Isaacs said that the amendments would be highly risky in regard to gold- mining in Vic- toria and silver-mining in Tasmania. They were purely local industries, and should not be handed over to federal control. Hence a new sub- section should be proposed stating that the previous sub section should not apply to mining for gold, silver, or other metals. Mr. Higgins said it was their imperative duty to preserve existing county contracts , hence he moved the addition to the sub-clause of the words " contracts subsisting with any state on the 31st March, 1897," under which bounties are offered or given by such State. Mr Barton said that before he would be prepared to vote on tho question, he would like to know if there were any contracts entered into by any of the colonies which were permanent or perpetual. If there were such contracts, the Commonwealth would be asked to protect a contract which would be a derogation from the freedom of trade und com- merce. Mr Wise said that if such contracts existed Mr Higgins's amendment would have to be amended so as to provide a definite time when all these local con- tacts should absolutely cease. Sir G Turner said he was unable at that moment to answer the question. The Victorian Government had promised its coal mines certain concessions for two years and they could not be gone back on. They had also entered into other contracts to assist growers, but none were for an indefinite period. Mr Isaacs said that if the amendment were car- ried it would tie the hands of the colonies from assisting the development of their resources from the 31st March. That was objectionable, and he moved that the words 31st March be struck out, and insert the words " From the establishment of the Commonwealth." Mr Barton said the effect of such an amendment would be to enable the Governments to go on making bounty contracts and passing laws to legalise them, and until they were repealed the Federal Parliament would have power to deal with them. He suggested that the clause be amended to pro- vide that contracts entered into up to the 31st March should be held valid, but shall become void in three years time fiom the 31st March. Sir G. Turner said that would never do, as men u had planted 1 md and would not «derive iny boneUt i or lorn orhvo years heneo they would be in- jure 1 hi such an arrangement Atti i some fui thor iliseusHon, during which Mr. Sv mon complicated matters by nu Tingan aniend moi t in Mr Higgins's amendment, they were withdrawn at the suggestion of Mr Barti n on con- dition that tho aiibsectiou waa recommitted aud dealt with bv the light of discussion at tho latter stag« of ilauies rclnting to freíd m of trade and commerce Clause SI was then agreed to On clan oSJ relating to the tian«fer of ofliceis, Sir G lurnei said the clause prov ded tor the coiu pulaorv Hanger of others liom the State to tho relcml Parlament, but it would be unfair not to allon thurn to ran ry with them all tlioir rights and pr v ileges Mr Curl uthers suggested that the clause should not be in tho eli ,ptei dealing with finance, and ought to be considered in connection with clause 64 rolut îug to 'ho appointment of a Civil servant Clause 81, dealing with tho transfer ot lind ami buildings from the States to the Commonwealth Mr Wiso aatd in order to te-t tho focliug of tlio comnuttej on the question us to vvhotl or or not tha mil-iajsof tho colonies should bo handed over to fcdci it control ho m ved tho insertion after tho nord "Commonwealth" of the woids *' and the railways " He would not speak on the subject, as hu wished ii division to be taken at unco, and thus eimrlif) tho debato on the subsequent financial clauses Sir G Turner said he Btrougly objected to vote on an aniiudment without discussing it A subsequent cluusu provided that the public debts should be taken tiver by the Federal Parliament, and it was possible that somo menil ora who n ere opposed to handing; the railways over to the Fedoral Parliament might ta), " If von spree o tuko over the | ulilio debts, no ure prepared to hand over the ra ii wa) s " Mi Iteid Bald he ivas opposed to huuditig over the publio debts to tho redera!
