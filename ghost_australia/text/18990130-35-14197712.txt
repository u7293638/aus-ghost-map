THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEAD ON THE LIVING. * So the dead influence our lives for good or for evil? The immediate answer to this question will (says the " Spectator ") be that of course they do All the generations that have passed away have left their mark upon no who live here to day, in a certain sense their lives are embodied in our a We quite assent to this very obvious assertion, though we do not hold with the posi- advises that this influence constitutes immortality To be immortal is to be alive, to be oneself, as well as to be capable of influencing others "We are now referring to a different kind of influence, not merely to the influence, of past genera- tions, but to the active, long, immediate influence from another state of being of the " wonderful dead, who have passed through the body and gone " We have found in a series of letters purporting to come from the spiritual world through the lncdmmBmp of the late Rev W Stainton Moses, and now collected in a volume published by the London Spiritualist Alliance, this idea stated with not a little force We need hardly say that with the organised movement known as spiritualism we have no relation or sympathy There is much concerned in it which is palpable imposture, and still mare which is tedious and banal But if we believe in the continuance of human life after the great change we call death, it is difficult to refuse assent to some of the teachings of spiritualism, which are not, after all, any more the teachings of spiritualism than of the various forms of Christianity We are not so foolish as to attempt to prove human immortality from the messages spell; out by a tilting table, for immortality is an idea of faith We are not even concerned with the question as to whether the singular phenomena at " seances " or two facts, though we do not doubt that many of there are What we are concerned with is the teaching that death is a mere transition to another life, and that the souls who have passed through that gate of death may still influence in many ways, for good or for evil or for both, those other souls which are still in the tabernacle of flesh That such influence did occur was the faith we might almost say the universal faith-of the antique and primitive world We do not believe in Animism as the origin of the religions belief among men, but we do believe that much of the ritual, ranch of the abcrglaube so closely associated with religion, was due to the belief that not only are the dead still alive, but that they are daily influencing mankind in this world The modern cult of telepathy, with all its various con- nections, may be regarded as a more thoughtful, a more introspective recrudescence of the old primitive belief After centuries of " enlighten- ment " and sceptical analysis Touch has produced a widespread agnosticism, the link between primitive man ind and ourselves of to-day seems to be in process of renewal, and not a few scientific men of high standing are not ashamed to declare that experiments have convinced them that human thought in transcend the limits of time and space and that minds can communicate with each other without any apparent material medium In a noble poem Tennyson his welcomed the coming of this new era when the fetters of match Thera will be thrown off, and the conception as well as the fact of the spiritual world will expand before the min J. of man Now, we do not time here that the evil which seems to separate us from the future state has been so lively proved to be bridged over by modern psychological discovery, though such a highly trained psychologist us Professor William James, of Harvard, seems to take this view On position is this If as is asserted, people in London and New York can occasionally and under exceptional and fortunate conditions communicate with one another without apparent material medium, thus throwing down the old barriers of space and revealing the instant inter- penetration of thought, can vo limit that power by the boundaries of this present work], this globe on which we live In thought transference is possible between London and New York, is it absurd to suppose that it is possible between our earth and Saturn, assuming that conscious life is present on that (distant planet ? If the universe is one, and if every wave in its rhythmic motionimpmg03 on every other wave in the in- finite Eoa of universal being, can we set any limits to the bounds within which thought operates , can we say to any spirit, whether within or without the body, " Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further ?" Can we say, " Within such and such limits your thought shall extend and snowmen others, but not beyond f" Can we, indeed, conceive of such limits as possible, when once we have attained the idea that those we call the dead are still living, and the cognate) idea that thought can influence thought without material medium ? from this point of view the question of the influence of the dead over the living becomes one of such bewildering interest that words fail the imagination in conceiving it The whole universe is one great whispering gallery, and we are again Surrounded, as the Apostle said, by a great cloud of witnesses " We are no longer alone in a dead universe, we are in instant communication with myriads of beings in a universe palpitating with life AB the old mechanical notion of a clock like order of the world has given place to a theory of universal world-energy, so, on another hypothesis, the idea that we are isolated tenants of a mighty void, the idea, as Matthew Arnold put it, that " we mortal millions dwell alone," yields to the conception of a world permeated with thought, and that not only the infinite thought of the Creator, but the thoughts of numberless created beings who can in some mysterious but real way influence our characters and lives This was, in and forms, the idea of the old-world Animism, and it is the idea suggested by the newer thought of our time in the curious book to which we have referred, and much of which consists of what may be Called excellent spiritual platitudes, Mr Stainton Moses professes to receive from his guide in the " next world " an explanation of much of the am and misery which baffles us here, and which does not seem to he explained by the hypothesis of heredity or phy E "al environment This explanation is that men are affected by use on environment, that of the wicked dead We do not think, it is true, enough of that side of things, which was constantly recur- ring to the mind of primitive man, whose sacrifices and incantations were offered in order to ward off the baneful influences of malevolent ghosts The old notion of a dim, far-back world seems mere superstition to us to day, but may there not be a truth behind it F We do not need to offer sacrifices to avert the anger of ghosts, but are we sure that wo escape their influence ? Are we so certain that we are so self- contained as to scout the notion, still spontaneous with many children, that evil influences enter from without into the mind ? If so, how do we explain de- maniacal possession, how do we explain number- less nUuBions in the New Testament ? It may be (and remember, we are all along suggesting rather than asserting) that our good and evil thoughts can both be explained by referring them to heredity and ordinary environment, but a portion of large experience in life has, we incline to think, many subtle temptations, many persuasive influences operating on his inner nature, which cannot be so explained What it these come from an invisible host encamped all round us ? What if the lower order of beings who have died after a life of vice, ignorance, and degradation, do haunt the minds of their old companions in Em and drag them down into deeper evil ? Of course, if the future life 13 denied, cadet quartoo , but if the fact of such a life is for us the great reality which Christianity declares it is, can we say that this view is irr tional Â° There is nothing in the mere article of death to change the character " He that is fully, let him be 11th by still " It will he said that this idea of all- pervading evil influence which we cannot See, cannot grasp, is too terrible to contemplate but if the evil influence is there, so is the food also, and if we are hemmed in by the phalanx of evil, we no also encamped about by the legions of the just But why, it may be forged, has this great gap ] existed for so many ages, between the Animism of primitive times and our new development of tele- pathy ?

And so it may be that, as the chief nations of the world are approaching the termination of their lower civilising task, they are about to take up once mare the broken threads of ancient Animism and weave them into a complex strand of high spiritual purpose and endeavour. -""as
