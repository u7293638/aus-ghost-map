INVESTMENT OF LADISMITH. JOUBERT'S INACTIVITY. CAVALRY SORTIES. SOUTHERN' COLIJMNS' RE CALLED. LONDON, Nov. q, 6.10 a.m. The Boer investment of Ladismith exhibits very little enterprise,, and for the last few days General Joubert has displayed an astounding lack of ac tivity. The British cavalry are^ con stantly out, and their brilliant sorties in all directions have greatly harassed the besiegers. ' ? The apathy shown by the Boer Com mander-in-Chief is said to be' due to the severity of his losses at the end of last week, and the failure of his dearly bought occupation of Colenso to effect any good purpose. ' General Joubert seems to have recognised at last that his operations south of Ladismith were so. many grave tactical errors, and is now devoting himself to repairing them. All the Boer columns sent to the southward have been recalled, and are now being re-concentrated much closer to ' Ladi smith. . . , ^ (We may be sure that this order of re call was known at Estcourt before the British armoured train was. sent, up to repair the railway line. Probably Joubert's inactivity is caused by sheer perplexity and inability to see what to do next. There is little doubt that the admirable generalship governing the Boer operations hitherto did not oriL ginate with General Joubert. It was supplied by the brains of Colonel Adolph Schiel, the ex-Prussian Hussar officer, who has been -for some time known as- Joubert's ' tactical ghost.' His capture at Eland's Laagte means to the Boers the loss of their head. Schiel would never have wasted time and men in futile attacks on Colenso. Joubert now seems to be at his wits end. He is an old man; he can know but little of modern scientific and tactical warfare; and left to himself he will probably go on making mistakes as costly as the one he is ' now trying to rectify.) ,','-' ' ' ' ' ''
