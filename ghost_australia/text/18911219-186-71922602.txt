BRITISH AND FOREIGN ITEMS. {From our Exduuioes.) It has been generally understood that the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls, the husband of Charlotte Bronte, was dead. But this is not so. Mr. Nicholls, the Bookman says, has been long resident in Ireland, aad still occa sionally preaches. He hat* maintained a resolute and honourable silence on ibe ro mance of his life. Some years ago the Rev. Mr. Baxter, of prophetic fame, used to deliver a lecture in which he predicted that the end of the world would take place in 1901, and that General Bonlanger, who would ther be at the very height of his power, would be the Anti-Christ foretold in the Apocalypse. Since the death of Boulanger nothing of this particular point has been heard from Mr. Baxter. The special correspondent of the Johannes burg Star, writing from Mashonaland, says : —The lions kept Lord Randolph Churchill tucked up one night, and everyone kept tight in his waggon or spider, as the case might be. On one of the shooting trips Lee shot a lioness out of a troop of seven. It is not every real live lord who sees lions shot He was wise, and stack to his horse and let Lee blaze away. like ' Ikey,' he 'hadn't lost no lions, and wasn't goin1 to look for none.*1 Anderson's Medical College, Glasgow, was opened on Tnesday afternoon with an address by Professor Watson, who took for his subject 'The Organisation of the Medical Profes sion.' The State, he said, maintained an army to kQL Might it not maintain an army to cure ? He suggested that there ou^ht to be a great Department of Health, imme diately under state control, with a Minister of Health and a vast organisation under him, and in which each member of the profession would have his appointed rank and sphere of action as in the armv. A Washington correspondent of the Xew York Sun states that the United States Government has induced both Germauy and France to agree to lower the import duties on maize to a very trifling rate in view of the failure of the Continental harvests. When tiie arrangements were privately entered upon it is said that the wheat crop in the United States was expected to yield a surplus for export of only some 150,000 bushels ; but non it is officially estimated at four tunes that authorities. The result necessarily will be seriously to check the European demand for American wheat and rye, and that at a time when the American grauaries are overflowing. Tlie typical Yankee face has found an en thusiastic admirer in Mr. Millet, the well known American artist. Hi* country, in his opinion, possesses not only a distinct type of feminine beauty, distinguished for symmetry and refinement, butalso a strongly accentuated masculine type, full of character and pictnresqueuess. The first thing that strikes the observant eye of an American who, after a season abroad, returns to his country sensi tive to fresh impressions of his native land, is, be assures us, ' the peculiar, nervous, high strung, keen type of bee, which has in it great elements of beaut}', prominent marks of character, and an accentuation of lines which are particularly fascinatiug to the painter.*1 The immortalisation of this type is, in Mr. Millet's opinion, a task which may well fire the ambition of any artist. A terriblfi panic occurred the other night in the picturesque southern town of Beancaire, immortalised by Tartarin de Tarascon. A herd of wild cattle escaped from the ground at Bellegarde, where they were tied up, and ran riot through the town. The animals overturned the chairs and tables outside caf&, gored one of the oldest inhabitants of Beaucaire, named Meissonier, nearly to death, upset a milkwoman with her pans, knocked down a toreador who attempted to lasso them, and would have ripped bis chest open had he not received assistance in the nick of time. An exceptionally savage bull impaled a citizen on its horns, and carried, him on its head through a street until the man was disengaged. It is said that the animals were let loose designedly by one of the Bellegarde people, who wanted to play off a rough practical joke of the kind peculiar to the .Southerner od his neighbours in Bcaucairc. In any case, the temporarily emancipated &uima.ls; liad Gome revenge ou those who are foud of seeing them badgered, baited, and hacked to pieces at the local bull fights. In the SberilTs Court at Artern, in Ger many, one Fritscbe, a shoemaker L-y trade, was summoned last week by an apotuecary for ttdvertisilsff & medicine for sale, he being an unlicensed person. The following ensued : — The Judge : You are charged with having advertised for sale in the weekly journals a certain process for the cure of corns without possessing the necessary legal qualifications. Is that so ? — Shoemaker Fritsche (em phatically) : No.— Tlie Judge : But you Lave advertised the remedy in the papers — Fritsche : Yes. That is quite true. Your Honour will observe I simply state in my advertisements I possess eacli a remedy, not that I have it for sale. I have no specific for sale apart from the good workmanship aud perfect fit of iny hoots, which I, with due public— The Judge was satisfied with the ex planation offered l*y the accused, and he wa* discharged. Frilsche left the justice chamber amid some signs of mciTimcnt from the litocli and crowded court. It is uot often that a pawnurokt-r over estimates, or rather over-pays, the value of a 1 pledge, Still less likely is it lo happen when ] the pawnbroker is the Slate The governors of the Mont Je Pii:u- ha\e fouud themselves j posbcsacd of aJi extraordinary Gtock of nicer- I schaum pipes. They had l-eeu pledged at the differenl shops all about the same tim^ mid liad in no case been redeemed. The- circum stances Looked suspicious. Some wholesale robbery was feared, and the police were colled in. When the next pipe was presented the pledger ivas detained, aud the police inquiry commenced. The prisoner told a very ample story. He said he was a polisher fay trade, and that he bought wholesale little blocke of flawed meerschaum, polished them, and made them np into pipes. They cost him on an average \\\ franc The Mont de PSete ad vanced him 3 francs, and he sold the pawn ticket for 2 franca. Thus on each sale he was 3£ francs to the good. The inquiries of the police only corroborated his story, and the prisoner was discharged. But the authorities are now most anxious *o lay the ghost 'they have themselves raised. It seems they have thousands of these pipes in stock— so many that there is to be a special auction for the sale of them. In the diaries of the late Mr. Cope, R.A., published by Bentley and Son, the following story is given as told by his Bister-in4aw. 'She met a farmer friend, and said to him, ? I bear, John, that yon're lately married ; who is your wife? 'Wed, Miss K^wwig, J doant quite know.' 'How bo? Where did you meet with her?1 ' AweeL ye see, miss, I went t' market, and as I was going I seed a canny lass warking along t* road, and I says, * Will ye get oop and ride V * Ay, ' says ahe. So she gat oop, and I asked her. 'Are ye ganging to t market? 'Ay/ says she. ?What for? says L * To git a pl&ace;/ says she. ' So I set her down i' t' market, and left her; and as I com* back i' t* evening there was the same lass warking t' saame way oop hni_ So I spak1 to her ng*i'j pnft ay*^J her, * Ha1 ye gotten yer plaace?5 ^Nay/ says she, * I hanna.' * Will ye get oop and ride V 'Ay/ says she. So she got oop, and I axed hex, * D'ye think my plaace would suit ye V 1 What place is that?' cays she. * Why to be my wife,' says L *I doan't mind,' sayB she. So we got wed, and she's a rare good wife, bat she's a perfect straanger to me. During an inquest at Andoveron a railway guard, in the employ of the Midland fwi N^uth-weatern Jnnction Railway, it traaspired that be had been at work from ten minutes to 5 a.m. on the 15th October till a quarter-past 3 a.m. on the following morning, when he sustained the injuries that proved fataL It was shown by a Cheltenham tradesman, who travelled in the deceased's van from Swindon to WeyhHl, that he seemed thoroughly jaded and disinclined to converse.

The Kew York correspon dent of an KngKnli contemporary says ; — About a year ago I mentioned, in trtffw* i^M»T»nTi* the perils to which the children of the lewdinj; millionaires were subjected here while taking their daily airing in Central Park. Tlie latter is bordered at certain points by streets be longing to the worst quarters of die town, and nothing would be easier than for any desperate TTiftir to snatch up a child and make his i'BCT'p*' therewith into the slums of thia great city. Surrounded as the latter is on fiiTyy codes, by water, escape would presen t bat little difli colty, and indeed a crime of this ***if **»'***??** would not only be exceedingly easy of per petration, but would also present almost certain prospects of a great pecuniary resalL Parents are ready to consent to almost any conditions in order to regain possession of their offspring, and to pay not only heavy ransoms, but even to promise immunity from punishment to the kidnapper. That the con' spiracy just frustrated by the New York police authorities has been of a serious nature is demonstrated by the fact that for the pastr ten days a special force of constables has been detailed to keep an eye on the children of the Yanderbilis, the Goulds, the Rockefellers, and others, and the nurses and governesses of those families have been invariably followed during the past week by two or three private The following is an ertract from a letter which the Pope lias addressed to 3|gr. Goutiie Soulard, Archbishop oE Aix :—4* During your recent stay in the Eternal City, when we de rived much consolation from the admirable piety and devotion of so great a multitude of' the faithful, we certainly had no presentiment of the anguish we were so shortly to undergo owing to unfor&cen; events. We cannot,. indeed, refrain from the thought that some thing worse threatens us, seeing, as we do, that so much impunity and license are granted to the insulters nf tlie Roman Pontificate. For in; fact ou the first pretext, angry passions were allowed full stray, and suddenly the city re sounded with savace cries. The fury with* which our enemies were filled broke loose. The' J'ooliGcatc was bitterly and rudely insulted^ imd the Catholic name was loaded wi&atinse.-; Neither the laws of hospitality nor their* innocence shielded many of the pilgrims from outrages aim personal violence. Alter tuese: events, which have so seriously impaired the aneieut reputation of the Italians for courtesy and urbanity., it is evident that the hatred' or our adversaries increases day by day j and? whatever the nature of the hypocritical' device? employed, the lamentable schemes wliii'h are l)?iii£ secretly lormcd against us. and against the Holy SW, become more andi more apparent. You, venerable orother, htH continue to figlri uith vour whole strength with us and for the Church.'
