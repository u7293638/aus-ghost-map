The Comet. . By E. Baly About a dozen, years ago, or fifteen at the most, The question ev'rybod asked was, 'Have you seen the ghost?' Akin to this the query, now, which seems to issue from it. Has since assumed the milder form of 'Have you seen the comet ?' 'Tis tantamount to asking if you often rise at four, And, as a step preliminary, ope the passage door, Which having done, you next proceed to call Jemima Ann, To wake up ev'ry sleeper then, and lastly call the man; A retinue of ghostly shapes, arrayed in spotless white, . All shiv'ring in the chilly breeze, they seem to haunt the night ! Unluckily the sky just then is anything but clear. And, curtained by relentless clouds, our Guest does not appear. 'It can't be helped!' papa exclaims, ' we'd better all retire, Unless Jemima would prefer to light her kitchen fire. I'll rouse you all again, my dears, to-morrow, without fail, 'When possibly a clearer sky may show the creature's tail ; The weather's so uncertain, and the clouds so often rise To mar the splendid vision of this 'marvel of the skies !' The brilliant guest that sweeps the sky with his tremendous tail, Now blows a cloud of dust about, or breathes a burning gale, Converts green fields to-arid wastes, and revels in the drought, While haughty Science vainly strives to guess what he's about : It may be that his mission is to bring the sun supplies, That, when he has delivered these, back into space he flies ; When near the sun, like Juno's bird, a tale he can unfold, But, far removed, twill pass away, like tales that have been told ! !!
