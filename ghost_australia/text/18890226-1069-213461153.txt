The Drought. — I can't resist sonding the enclosed from a" Now Zodland paper: — The Otago Baity Fiia'es, (says thb New' Zealand correspondent of tho S. AT. Herald) while confessing thattlio preseub serious drought in Australia will materially advance the ineerests of 'the Now Zealand produce, is not without hope that it may lead to lho abolition of the artificial barriers which tlio protect,, policy has raised up between tlio colonic, ' and that tlio people of the continont will sea tliat it- is to their interest to ndmit freo' of duty the produce of the sister colony over the sea. Tho Times concludes its article us follows: — "Whatever may be the effect of protection in ordinary years when the Australian colonies can supply themselves, it must tell heavily upon the consumers in . years wlieU the crops entirely fail, and' they have to depend on outsido supplies for the support of their population, 't hen, at least, the Australian consumer, and not the New Zealand producer, pays tlio duty when ho can least afford to do so, and it would be .wise policy to suspend tor a time the opera tion of the tariff. Wo hope the time will come when thero will be entire freetrado be tween tho colonies, at least in the necessaries of life. It is unprofitable work to fight against tlio - laws of nature by artificially fostering productions to wliieli a' country is not naturally adapted." .
