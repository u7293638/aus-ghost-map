THE LOAN rover or NEW SOUTH WALES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Song-The Herald is undoubtedly rendering and mirable service to the public in insisting that the Ire insurer should at once ' lay before the House and the country a complete state none of our financial position in regard to love is and public works, and a systematic j offer for dealing with it. The steps to be taken in connection with the vet ) important proposal to issue a local loan of 2.,000,00 affords the opportunity for making such a statement, and at the same time makes it all the more imperative that the whole subject should be exhaustively considered by the herald of the 10th September I pointed out that since his return Sir George Dibbs had talked freely about the cost in loss of our loans and other points of mere detail, whilst maintaining absolute silence as to the possibility of further borrow ings in London and as to the proper policy of the colony in regard to loans funerals I affirmed that it was clear that the Premier had 'utterly, absolutely failed to create any desire to- further supplies of our securities " and that at present those wait not " the ghost of a chance of our being able to raise any considerable loan in London except under humiliating conditions " That the conclusion put forward was perfectly accurate is clear, for no one month after his return, Sir George has admitted that to at tone pt to float a loan in London at the present time would be disastrous to the future borrow mg powers of the colony " iv e may well ask why the Premier has kept his lips shut all these weeks and, observing the reticence that has bee a already show a, the public may be pardoned if they entertain the fear that even now it is not intended to thoroughly deal with the subject What lb w rated at present is a policy that has some finality about it Sooner or later it will be recognised that the policy which has in a few years piled up a vast aggregate of indebtedness, has been very bad policy, and the colony Hill there shrink from any increase of its debt burdens The whole truth about the matter has not yet been he imed lion - or, for those who want to resume borrowing when practicable and for those who want to stop Burrawing altogether, one common course is now open That is to make terms with the London money market, This done, for some e in the sorrow - mg policy can be resumed or abandoned The proposal to borrow iJ.OOO 000 in New South Wales, taken with the Premier a remark about 1 future borrowings' in England, suggests that the present Government means to continue an extra a paint works policy-a course full of future suffering If Parliament were to decide that the public debt of the colony should not be allowed to exceed 60 millions, the colony could borrow during the next two years the son nulli ms needed to make up that aggregate It would not be necessary to make that condition binding for longer than the year 1900, or eight years ahead Such a decision would strengthen the London market at once the balance of the £50 000 000 would be obtained on terms at pre "out absolutely impossible If we don't adopt some such course there must be grave trouble for us to tell Loud in capitalists that we intend to go on borrowing in that city as soon as we have mopped up all spare capital in New South Wales will not prove a good policy for ourselves Our own dignity recovery feeling of independence and manliness call for the adoption of a strong and self reliant policy in the present emergency The general financial position is anything but no assuring the Customs receipts which some time ago Sir George Dibbs, with much accuracy, styled the barometer of public prosperity, stands as follows for the three completest quarters of the year - Customs receipts 1892, in excess of those for 1894 January, £5 . 000 1 February, £79,000 March, £79 000 total, £210 010 April, 6000, May, £15000 Time, is 1000 total, £6,000 July, 28 000 August, £19,000 , September, £32,000 total, £109 000 The receipts (including the new duties) show a steady falling off The reduced shipments known to lie afloat make it certain that the fourth quarter will show receipts much under the extent to This being leap year the first quarter is so often by an extra day's receipts and the third quarter is depicted by the absence of the tea duty), which always brought in trust money in the third quarter, when the new teas arrived Those facts account for a portion of the falling off both on the first and third quarters possibly one-fifth but if the falling off is only £80,000 instead of £10/,000, it is still large enough to attract attention and to indicate that, even while a new departure in our works policy is essential, stern unflinching economy in our general expenditure is also essential It has been acquired for the policy of trade restriction that it would provide employment, Give plenty of profitable trade, and fill the public Treasury It is well that it should be shot in so clear as it has been that such results are not secured by such a policy No well-informed free trade will debit the Government with the whole of the depression now existing, but it is to be hoped that freetraders will recognise that there has seldom been a time in the history of the colony when freedom of trade was more important than it is at pro- sent, and certainly there never was a time when it was so much their duty to fight a w wasteful, and wicked expenditure of public funds I am, in the EDWARD PULSFORD.
