Genuine fear is something like a sudden ..-realisation of tlie fantastic terrors suffered 'by the common people in tlie dark age's. Aliiau who believes in ghosts, arid wlio firmly be ; lieves that he is gazing upon a midnight visitant from another world, must experience to its. fall extent the fiightful seu : sation of fear. " I once experienced that frightful sen; sation to such a degree that the 6rm earth seemed to melt beneath my feet to a singlp foothold, and my very soul to go :to pieces and leave me to topple over into the, aby of eternal night. " I've taken many risks in my day, run many chances of my life, fought' duels and been' left for dead by assassins. X was once condemned to be hanged as au insurgent) in South America, and on another occasion was thrown overboard on the China coast. Each and every time I gave myself up for lost^ but I didn't shrink. I faced death like a man ! Aud yet, my friends, there was no sensation of fear in any such perience, not a tinge of it; but, ah was quite different in the case which I am about to relate to you. There, it is striking midnight, arid would you believe it, I never hear a clock striking that hour that there doesn't flash through my mind a remembrance of that night, although it was more than 40:years ago. To my dying day I shall never quite .free my self from the shock. And yet that terrible sensation lasted only a few brief minutes', but so intense was the fear I suffered that I have never been able to rid my soul of its effect." .Any sudden sound in the dead of uight, any white figure dimly seen in the dark, makes me start. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm afraid of the dark. When a.man has passed his 75i.li milestone he can afford to be frank. It • is permissible for a man of tliat age to turn pale in the. face of some fantastic petil; but let the danger be real and tangible, and I will meet it just as calmly as ever. " It was in 1S27, in the mouth of July,, aud my regiment was stationed at Rouen. Oue day, while out for a walk on the quay, I met a man whose face was familiar to me, and yet I could not exactly place liim. In-, stinctively I came to a halt, and as I did so ho stepped forward aud took me by the hand. It was SaintGery, a school friend, whom I. had. not seen for ten years. As a boy. hex.had been extremely. pliunlooking.; .. as .-- a." lnan. Jie - was repulaive. With: tlie /-.squatty' r figure, if ; -a cufe-.riowii- \- -'HerciilesVV-neck "of e^raoydintWy^ and a face reddened with scrofulous taint, Saiut-Gery was not a man for your soul toi go out unto. Although we were of the same age lie now. looked .ten years my senior.- His hair was prematurely gr6y, and his whole manner denoted a- mental-unrest bordering, alniostupon insanity. • Saiut;Gery was the last of bis race. I suddenly." remembered that, and also the fact that he oiviied an estate a few miles out of Rouen. In i rambling arid half- violent'mariner, lie informed me that he had quitted his chateau, only a few days before our meetiiig, and that; it was his firm resolve -never to.enter it . agaiu. I eoulduVbringmyself to question him coricerning.tliis strange' determination. There was a.something :about the man that was-intensely displeasing to me, and./.yet,'j must confess, that this very- repulsiv.eness some way fascinated, me. " ' Thank-heaven .for this meeting,'said, he, abruptly, 'for I liave a favour to ask you. It is to ride out to my old horiie and get some papers for me. I'll tell you where to Bad tiiein—iu-theToqm,: in my••-writing-: desk. For'certain 'reasons I ' don't' want to. send an ordinary messenger, but I may trust you.
