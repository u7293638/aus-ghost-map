NOBODY'S CHILD. : : -(From the .Penny Miscellany.) Chapter XXI. DADDY PKTKIl FOIIMB A DESPERATE :? ? RESOLUTION. : '?; No sooner was the baronet gono than Paddy Peter cooled down, ngain, and repented heartily that burst of pride and anger which he found himself entirely unable to control, Peter called himself a stupid old brute, and wished that some one had been there to well pnmmerinm for the folly lie had committed, felt almost sorry that he had not received a seccond lashing at the hands of Sir Robert Tregarvon. ?? , What business had he to go- about . bragging and blustering ? Why could not ho hn'vo waited until all had beoh settled and finished before indulging in a parcel of rhodonaontado ? ' But no, he had shown himself in his true colours, had boasted and vapoured, and badmadeafoolofhimselfaltogethor; and instead of having the castle on the easy terms on which it had been about to fall. to him — it would cost him five pnd- twenty thousand pounds, and — ?who could say ? — perhaps even more than that. ? The people of that neighbourhood ?were all so disagreeable and disobliging, and haled Daddy Peter. That he knew, and it greatly surprised him, for,lie: con sidered himself quite and. amiable1! old gentleman. , , ? ..?;.? -; . ? ; '. But he would indulge -in;- no more foolery ; he was resolved on that. Self4 love' and: vain-glory were' all very well -—but that was no reason why lie should hurt himself ; and if the castlo 'was ' to bio forced tip to a higher price i than, it was worxo, no wouiu noy ? iiayo 11, ,.;no, , certainly.. 'not.; he . would, let lit go '.-to anybody that chose to pay: s through the nose for it. But suddenly a thought struck him.- ????'? ? : , r 'That letter which had belonged to the care to preserve, Sir Robert Trcgaryon would be delighted to get hold of it. ? Yes — and instead of exciting himself about the castle, Peter would go to tbe baronet and demand from hitn'a good price for that document. That way, the affair would be all profit, for he would pocket a good round sum and have nothing to disburse. .... ? ;': . Yes, yes, .vain-glory might go to the devil, and he would' 'look after the money. . . ':'?. ' '???'?? :: ; ? Having perfectly made up'his' 'mind, the. old usurer went to the foot of the stairs which led to the upper part, of the house, and there listened. , :; ,.? ? : ' He could hear that Lucy :and the others were very busy with the' child, and not likely to disturb him dtiringthe minute or so longer that he needed to be alone. . : Then he returned to his private par lour, and opening the lower drawer of the .buffet there, with a key which ho drew from his pocket, brought from it and placed on the table that little square box which alre.ody we have seen in Patty Peter's possession. ' Having next opened that little Bqnare box, Daddy Peter uttered a loud grunt and gave a great start. . ? The letter was not there ! Peter was however quite certain that, not more than a week before, he had seen it in that box. . ?But there it was not now— and of course somebody had . stolen it: from him. Then came the question — by whom had that letter been si olen ? ' ; ' ? Not by a professional thief, for though the letter was gone, the money had been {left, untouched. Who then was it ? It could be only those who had an interest in the matter— and who were they? ? -???-.??? Peter first thought of the baronet; and then told himself he wae an idiot. _i ' . If Sir Robert had got possession of ? that letter, he would riot hare come, to borrow money. . ?..;;??; ?. , And it was not Dudley Lazonty— decidedly not ; for hoandthe old. miser had had a talk together only the ; day before ; and in the evening- 'of th'ei pres ent day the captain was to be off again;! was about to leave Lucy Tregarvon 'arid ; all the rest ; ahdif ;h'e had 'that, .prcpf, Lazonby,'old :Petor ,: well,,' knew, jvould; not stir ayardifroin'itue castlo. i:'.i --; : \- /The old., usurer'' fo.placed):thG;'littIoi square box in its place %of '?'

Then he stamped and danced about his private parlour, muttering — 'But who is it then? Who has taken it ? Who has got it ?' Presently into the room bundled Joe the Foundling, and instantly on him fell his masters suspicions; Joe was very anxious to learn how 'to read— and to read writing hand too. Yes, Joe was the thief ; not a . doubt about it had old Peter. ' Now, Daddy Peter,' said Nobody's Child, ' I have finished my work, anil how about that writing copy— is it ready ?' ' ?????. 'Yes, yes, Joe— there it is upon the table.' ,' ',. .\, ,'.,, ' . . 'That's all right ; and here goes to seewhat I can make of it,'' and into his chair before the table again flopped Joe. ?'' ' That's it, my lad, dig .-away at it, dig away,' crieij old Peter, with pre tended good- humour, and at the same time bringing his fist down on the table with a heavy thump, as he thought — 'Oh, the scoundrel !? I see, he sus pects- something, and wants to cut me out of the business and make, something by it himself.' : ?'.. ? '*'?'?,' Then, as he watched Joe, hard at work with his- copy. : ' Yep.yes,' he muttered to himself;. ' learn to read, do, you thief !' ' .

What is it now ?' thought the old miser, as he obeyed the other's signal. '? 'We have not seen yon at the castle for several days,'1 Lucy said to Joe, who felt a thrill of delight on thus learing that his absence had not passed unre marked by the young lady. ' That is because I have had so much to do here — very much more than you could imagine,' responded Joe. ' Good day, then ; and do not remain too long away from us.' .

The captain smilingly offered his arm to the unhappy girl, both said 'Good- day' to old Peter, and commenced their walk back to the castle. Even before those two were gono Daddy Peter was again bnried deep in thought. . I . He had lost tho letter ; it was then absolutely necessary that he should, obtain possession of that document, which was a legal proof of Captain Tregarvon 's decease. ? . . It was no longer time to hesitate; and if that document had not fallen to the very lowest, depths.; of the 'earth, within an hour it should' be at tbe bot tom of his pocket. .'.-?'. Having thus determined, the old man hurried back into the house, aud throw ing open the door of his private parlour, abruptly shouted — ' Patty ! Patty !' . ?, ' Yes, father, here Iam,'» replied his daughter, disturbed. in .a conversation which she had just commenced with Joe.

And as Nobody's Child had answered ? very calmly, and was evidently '. entirely unmoved, his master, who had watched him very closely, was quite satisfied with the result of his scrutiny. ' ' ?? Nothing was lost— only he must make ' haste, was Daddy Peter's thought, as he hurried itowards the door. . . 'But wherever are you going with that ?'' cried Patty, and meaning the: rope. : Her father stopped upon the thres hold, looked back towards Patty, and then, in' what was for him quite xa gentle voiced — ' Come here, Patty,' he said. ' Yes, father,' she answered, and went to. him. The old man stared hard at her for a moment or two, and then said — '-':' Kiss me,' and, pulling her tohim, kissed her with a loud smack. ' Why, father, what is tho matter with yon ?-' Patty wonderingly inquired. ?'Nothing,' repliod tho old man, shaking from him a weakness of which he felt ashamed. ' Look well after the house— and mind, especially, that nono of the work is neglected.' :, Patty, greatly astonished at the wild ; ness of her father's manner, watched; him from the window, and saw him striding away with all his might. '' Wherever can ho bo going^ to?' cried Patty. ; Joe, his eyes still fixed on his copy, from ?which ho had not one moment removed them, said — ? ?;??? '.Oh, don't you know ? Ho fancies that lie hasn't got his proper length of cord, and has gono to bully tho rope maker.';. ;?',:? \ :'; ;A.)tninute. afterwards, dashing his !,hand down., upon the paper — ....... f','«,'Qh, I- -I:. am' ? .afraid I shall never understand anything of all this/' ho almost despairingly exclaimed. ' You must have courage, as Miss Lucy told you awhile ago,' said Patty. ' Yd?,' cried Joe, ' those words have given it to me ! I shall have it — I havogbt it ! Leave me, Patty, that I may learn.' . ? ! ' Yes, tliat's right, Joe, learn 'away, and I will go and prepare your dinner.' Unobserved by him, she looked long and fondly on the Foundling, and then left him to himself. And it almost seemed to her, as she set about preparing- his dinner, that already she was Joe's wifo and the mis tress of a happy home. Joe, poring over his copy, decided that it was not more difficult than print ing. '. ' '; ?''. :..-'-' Bnt how the dickonR was he to make words out of what Daddy Peter had givon him ? . . : : ; ; Then t'.ie thought came tohim to try ai little with 'the letter that had been found in the square box. ? 'V He brought the letter from bis pocket, and compared each one of its letters that he read there with thoss of his copy, but could not get beyond that. : And there were words, but Joo could make nothing of Hherri;, knew nothing which resembled the only sounds that he could give to them, and concluded that they must be pronounced after a fashion of which he was totally ignorant. He well remembered' that' old Peter had told him that for ? shoo he must say '— s-h; oo,' shoe — but that did not' help Joe a bit with the le'ter in his hand. He laid his head upon his hands, and called it a wooden head. ,? It would take i him a' whole year he was certain to learn how tu read— and before tbat time, Liss Lucy-: ? As thejtbouglit smote him that before a year Lucy might be married to some body else, he started up,' saying to him self-that-but one, thing was. left for, him to do, and that was to carry the letter to the castle and ~to give it to Miss Tregarvon. , , : ,; ?.? ..'.?Then; again he. reflected that there might be sorriethirig;-in.the letter which /sfie ought hot, to kriowTr?soniething^t]iat | might trouble and make her unhappy.^' :- '' Ob, wicked people,' he 'exclaimed: aloud, 'oh, wicked people that did . not teach n)e how to read when I was little !' He sank down into his chair , again, and laid his head upon the table and ? wept.. ' ' : ? ? ?' _:' ?? . ' : ? And just then the door opened, and into the room walked Limpy Lnby. '.?' Sighing heavily be approached Joe, whose face was concealed from him, and said—— . . ' - '.' Good day, Daddy Peter.' Joe raised his head. ? . 'Ob, it's you, is' It; ?' pursued Lubyj 'I thought yon were — you know !' ' What do j'oh want, Luby ?' 'I have come to say good-bye to Daddy Peter and Patty.'. v . .. ; ' Are you going to leave us, then?' 'Yes) I have got to follow my regi ment.' '. ~ -'-?.??'.?? ' What, are. you a soldier ?'';?-. 'So it appearsi'': responded Luby, with another and still more formidable sigb. : ' What. do you mean by appears ?' demanded Jo'e. ' Lnby told his melancholy story. A couple of nights before he had dropped into the Tregarvon Arras, and had encountered there a recruiting ser geant who told him that he was a very fine young man, an opinion in which Luby very readily coincided. The sergeant talked of heroes and of battles, piled Lnby well with Bingley's very best home-brewed— and 'on the following morning convinced ; Luby to his great horror that ho had fairly en listed, and was one of the Queen's soldiers. 'But the sergeant may. perhaps have been jesting with you,' said Joe, with the wish to give a little hope to tho new soldier. ' Jesting !' cried Lnhy ; ' oh, yes, very likely, isn't it ? Why, he showed mo a paper that I had signed, and which, ho told me, bound me hard and fast.' ' That yon had signed,' Joe eagerly ' exclaimed. ' You can write, then ?' ' Yes — middling, worse luck !' ' But t suppose yon don't know how o read ?!' Luby, for a moment forgetting that ho had:bocomo a soldier,- burst into a fit of If ighter. ' Well, Joe, you arc a fool,' he said ; ' we may know how to read and not krow how to writo, but wo can't know how to write and not now how to read; because, you see, writing is, as one might say— in short, it's writing.' ! ?:???-. ' Ah, yos,'1 said Joe, ?'* I think I un derstand. Then,' according to that, joa know how to read ?' '? ' I should think' so.' -'? ' And you could, tell me what Ibo writing was in a letter ?'.'??' ? -.? .! 'Why, of course I could,' I.uby proudly said.' ?' .??' ???-'' ??????;? ' Ah; yos— -but,' Joe doubtfully added, 'you couldn't toll me, I suppose; withontknowing yourself at the eanse time ?'. ?' . .'? -..' ? ' .? ?' ??? '?:- ???'???'?: . '? :? J .'?'? 'Well,' grinned Luby, ' that wbnM be rather 'a difficult matter.' 'Well then, I must think no moro about it.' ; ' ? ??'?'? ''? '?'. Then you have got a letter, and yoH ? want to know what is in it ?' .. 'Yes, biit— oh, what is to be done?' he despairingly criod. . ? ''What do you mean, Joe ? Havens I just told you — — ?' . 'Luby,' Joe . abruptly showtcd, ' when do you go ?' ......... -Thus, recalled to all his misery, Luby breathed another heavy sigh,- and res ponded — ???'.'?.' , 'Inacouplo of hours ; jny father and ntother are brealdng their poor old hearts about it— they wanted to try to. raise the money to buy me off, but I would not let them — I told them, heaven forgive me, that I was dying to be ft soldier.' ' ; ' Joe had not listened to all this, .bnt having formed a resolution, had 'cavo- fully closed the doors of the room, 'after assured himself that 'neither 'Patty- 'rioir any one else was within hearing.; 'Then Joe seated himself beside the table,- and, said, quietly— ' ' ' Luby.''- : ? 'Well?' ? '???'? ',-? ' -;; : ' Conio here !'?' ? ' Well, hero I am.'1 ?'?? '?' ' Sit down.' ' ' Whut for'?' '? ???:??: 'Sit down,' repeated Joe, ??? quite sternly. ?'. ? ' ' ?'?

' You want -no to read it ?' ' Yes, bnt — make haste !' Limpy Luby, commenced with the letter, read — ? 'To Sir Robert Tregarvon.' : 'Tlioso letters, then, made the baro net's name, and I could make nothing ef them. Oh, I shall never bo anything better than a stupid brute as long as $. live,' thought Joe, who was angry and ashamed of himself. ;-. 'It is with much grief, Sir Robert, that I write to inform you of the death of Captain Tregarvon, who has perished in tlie wreck from which I and tbe bearer of this letter only by a miracle escaped.' ' Luby interrupted himself in his read ing to exclaim with great surprise — ? ' Oh my goodness — oh my gracious 2 Tho baronet's uncle is dead, then ; here it is, clear enough !'' ' Go on, go on,' Joe anxiously said. 'And to ,the sailor who will deliver you this letter ——' . : ' A sailor ?' criod Joe. 'Yes,'- responded 'Luby, ' it says sailor.' ? ' - ' Go on !' shouted Nobody's Child. ? Luby returned to the letter — ' : ?'?'?' I havo given also a— — ' 'Well, a what ?' 1; ' ' ' A d-o-c-u-m-e-ri-t, a '?' document' whioh-will be a lpgal and proper proof of the captain's decease ? '' 'Goon.' ' And lie will be able to furnish ybit with every possible detail concerning that fatal event.' ' Go on.' ' That's all,'1 snid Lnby ; ' excoyt the signature, and I can't make out the name. And, oh my goodness ! Isn't it ' wonderful news ? We ' must\ run' directly and toll Sir Robert. But stop a bit — the document that tho letter talks about, whero is it ? -Shouldn't wonder if it was lying down at tho bottom of the Devil's Gap, whuro tho sailor was 'found.' Those words enlightened Joe, and he now understood whither his old master had gone, and for what purpose lie hail required the rope. It was clear to him now that D.uLly Poter had suspected him concerning the letter, and fearing that Joo would soon be able to arrive at tho same conclusion ~ ? «a himself concering that proof of Captain Treganon's death, old 'Peter1 .had desired to bo beforcliand with him. Now Joe saw it- all plainly enough, and, determining at or.ee to follow his master, was in agony lest ho should too late reach the ravine. 'No rope bnvo.I,' Joe said to him self; and was in a species- of . transport at the thought that perhaps in . onden vourjng to give fortune and hnppiness to Lucy Tregnrvon, ho would find his death in the depths of the Devil's Gap. .-,-?.,: ...;; Chapter XXII.

It was just: then that Joe arrived in the ravine, and concealing himself behind one of the roeks about twenty yards from the Gap, waited, and for a few minutes watched his old master's nroceo.dincs. Joe. as well as the old miser, hnd thought of that tree, and without hesi tating in his choice, made for that side of the precipice at which he had now arrived, and, thanks to the failure of Daddy Peter's courage, had in gooa time reached. And Nobody's Child had not now come alone to tho ravine, but had com pelled Limpy Luby to accompany him thither, that the young gentleman might have no opportunity of speaking to any one of the letter be had rend. By the way, Joe thought of a plan which he felt certain would cause Daddy Peter to hurry from the ravine, in case he was not otherwise to be got from the place. In hiding now with the Foundling waa Limpy Luby, who was to assist in the scheme that had been devised, and whom Joe had fully instructed concern »g it. :'?
