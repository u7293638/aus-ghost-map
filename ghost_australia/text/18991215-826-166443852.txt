THE KAISER'S CLEMENCY. A good story about the Kaiser comes from Berlin." It is well known that His Majesty, during his annual trip on board the "Hohenzollern," to theNor weigan fiords, is in the habit of con ducting Divine service every Sunday morn ing. He usually reads a short liturgy, and follows the prayers with a sermon, not of his own composition, but from the collection of some well-known German divine. During his recent trip the officers of the "Hohenzollern" noticed that a sailor during Divine service, either overcome by the heat or from some other cause, had fallen fast asleep. After the service the captain called the sailor before him, and gave him a sound rating, and sentenced him to two days' arrest. The captain reported the incident of the sleeping sailor, and the punishment inflicted on him. "Was he on the watch the night be fore?" asked the Kaiser. "He was, your Majesty." "Then let the poor devil off. Besides, it wasn't much of a sermon, anyhow." Mr. J. L. Toole's fondness for practical joking is well known. Not very long ago the celebrated actor entered a dairy shop in London, and, assuming a solemn de meanor, addressed himself to the man be hind the counter. "I will take a boy," Bald Mr. Toole, gravely, looking round at the shelves. "Boy, sir?" asked the dairy man, in a puzzled tone. "And a girl,"' added Mr. Toole. The man gazed open mouthed at his customer, evidently under the impression that a lunatic was address ing him. This is a milkshop," said the dairyman, in an emphatic tone. "Come outside," answered Mr. Toole, in a sepulchral voice; and, taking the man by the arm, he led him to the door and point ed upwards to the sign. "I'll take a boy and a girl," repeated the humorist, with not the ghost of a smile. "Read what your notice states: 'Families sup plied in any quantity.'" Some of the best lessons) we ever learn we learn from our mistakes and failures. The error of the past is the wisdom and success of the future.
