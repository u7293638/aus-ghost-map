The college is ;a teiftaiagular building, of Gothic design, occupying' half an acre of ground. All the apartments lead on to a corridor., iwhich-i.rfringes a courtyard af./.ltfOffc.'; by ,'fiOtt. The rooms consistof .a,, private .chapel, which will be appropriately furnished and supplied with Btainedrglass windows,, dormitories, classrppms, refectory, studies, private rooms, and,a,number of smaller apartments. The. strpctpre of pitch-pine throughout, with cprrugatqcl, iron roofs and brick chimneys. There jwuT.be; satisfactory seating accommodation in the, Ptyapel, the accommodation space of which is about ,50ft. by 26ft. The rpfectory is also 50ft. by" 26ft. There are two large dormitories, one 80ft. by 26ft., and tjie other ,45ft : . by ,26ft. Three class-rooms 5Qft., ,J)y 20tt., a main study 40ft. by 20ft., and eight or ten smaller rooms complete the. very adequate accommodation. Attached to the college is the , two-storied stonp ;building formerly,the residence of Judge Gaunt, audi \?hich was purchased by. Bishop Moore and presented by him to the diocese for educa-, tippal^purposes. . This will bemused as;a residence,.for. the principal and his, assist-' apt.jnstructors. : In view of the;;faot that the contractors had only been seven weeks engaged: on the college, -excellent progress has :been made. Every consideration has been-given to' the convenience of the ptipils; and the ventilation of the building has been oontrived by means of: adjustable vents on the most approved pattern. Already Dr. has over 100 students enrolled, a large p'prtion of whom hail' from Melbourne. The, cost of the . new structure is' to be about'! £5000, and ef this about £4000 has been already expended. The building is expected to''be complete within ten days or a fortnight.' The architects are Messrs. Tappin, Gilbert, and Denehjr. Messrs. Irving and Glover, received the contract for wood-work, and'Mr. H. Hunt for 'the^ brick-work and plastering, ' .

As I am now on the subject of education, you will- permit me to notice certain reproaches which eeoulatists seek to fasten on us; and by dint:of repetition they have come, I dare say, to be accepted by \a credulous public; We 'are upbraided with caring nothing for the spread of .education amongst the peojple; wq are taxed wifh hostility to the progress of eiilightenmeiit; we are said to cberce our people into snppotting denominational schdbls, arid to detfer them, against their judgment and ! wish, from tavailing ihemselves of -the free State eduoation, which, in faot, they^ay for; ;These broad assertions are very commonly .repeated in the columns, of, the secularist |Press ; and, of course, they sound very plausible to men whose inveterate prejudices ;prepare them for any accusation against the Catholic Church. Now, let us test these assertions by the light of a few facts.' The' priests are accused of coercing*"the laity. Well, then, Catholics must be Very much less than men if they act in this matter against their better: judgment. For, see what it costs them. Within the last year, iii this diocese of Ballarat, the maintenance of primary schools alone cost the Catholics no less than £6500. They pay. at least this annually to support what they are said to . condemn, and they also pay their share for the support of the State schools, whose advantages they forego in every possible case. Remember that the Catholic population is not very much above 30,000. Moreover, very many-families in the country places are so far apart from other Catholics that the support of a Catholic school , is out jof their power. Hence the £6500 is met jannually byonly a portion of the total population of 30,000, but wherever they are in sufficient numbers they need no spur from the priests. I gladly bear this testimony , to the spirit and liberality of ourpeople. Now for the higher education.' This college as you now see it represents an outlay Within a Jittle over one year of £10,000. In the same Itime I have paid away £6800 in order to establish two other centres -of intermediate education. And just now we have signed contracts to the amount of - £4500 foe educational .piarposes exclusively. So that ;in one. year this young diocese of Ballarat, with a Catholic population of some 30,000, has had an outlay of at least £27,800 defrayed by the voluntary contributions of the laity, the clergy, and myself, and all for education. With Buch facts as these to support us, I think we may calmly dismiss the vague-and baseless charges to which I -have called your attention. We are most anxious to'have our people .educated and' fully equipped for the hard battle of life. We jdesire ,to see them grow up in the full .enjoyment of those priceless advantages which are the fruit of enlightenment. We are alive to the .fact, that in these days of keen and ktiowirlg competition the odds, are heavy against the uninstrueted. All these reasons weigh with us, and greWly influence us. We ar6 actuated in the same direction by even other'motives. -Who trimmed the lamp of science and kept it burning through long ages of barbaric darkness? Who drudged anJ. toiled, with no incentive, but the pure love of knowledge and of truth, in order to save from utter,, wreck the remnants they found to hand of a bygone civilisation ? The olerics and the monks of , the Catholie Church'. We are to-day the heirs aiid representatives of those ineh.

Dr. Ee£f6, in reply, said:—My Lord Bishop, Monsignor Hoyne, and reverend fathers,— I beg to tender to your Lordship and the rev. gentlemen who have, with such a generous alacrity, consented, to be partners iri the gift with which you have this evening come to honour arid to : . eheer'me, the assurance of my deep and liiBting gratitude for your very noble present and your very com- : plimentary address.

Pathersof the Holy Ghostl; and the third want had been met by a community ot Redemptoriat Fathers. (Applause.) The Bishop Ito bringing the Fathers of the Holy Ghoet to Bft^rftt there was no requirement of the higher intellectual training or educationwhich was not sure to be supplied. He recollected when the intermediate system of education was introduced to Ireland there were various speculations as to its effects on the Catholic schools, and what position the schools would occupy when the first examination was made known. There were many men in Ireland competent to judge, and some predicted that for twenty years to come ?Q or 80 per cent, of the prizes .would fall to the students of non- Catholic schools. It was no wonder they came to that oonoluBion, as the traditions were altogether against the Catholic sohooh. Therefore, with the, {traditions and the endowments against them they believed it impossible for the Catholic schools to hold their own against such disadvantages. Bat when the results of the first examination were made known it was seen that Catholic students carried away not only the highest but the greatest number of prizesand exhibitions, and that success had continued at every examination from year to year up to the present time, and anyone awate of the circumstances would know that the Blackrock College contributed its share to the success of the Catholic colleges, not only from its own centre, but by its influence, throughout the whole of Ireland, He rejoiced to find in Australia a college conducted by the same Fathers, and he was sure the cause of education would be very materially advanced by their presence. He was glad to Observe that they had made provision for the combination of religion and education, which was education in its proper Bense. If moral principles were left out of sight, and if the relations with the Creator were forgotten/it was not education in the true sense. (Hear, hear.) This conclusion appeared to have impressed itself on others besides Catholics at the present time. In the Ballarat papers there was a report of a meeting held at Ballarat on the previous evening in advocacy of the introduction of the Bible into State schools. AH the speakers were agreed that without religiouB instruction the system of education was incomplete. (Applause.) Thetoneofthespeeehes generally was fair and unobjectionable; but there was one gentleman, with more force than good taste, urged that the existing system was favourable to the Catholics, or, as the speaker put it, to the Romans. He did not expect this from a man of education or refined feelings. (Hear, hear.) It was an unworthy statement, coming from a iman who occupied the position of the gentleman who uttered the words. He ought to'have known that the Catholic Church did not objeot to the reading of the Scriptures; that it was through the Churoh that the Scripture came down from past ages; and that the Church regarded them just as sacredly as anyone. It regarded them as the repository, and hot the organ, of revealed truth, and that they should not be interpreted .by every person of age or learning, But by the Church which Christ had set up to interpret them. It was sometimes said that the Catholics undervalued the teachings contained in the sacred Scriptures. This was said because they declined to depart from the basiB of the Catholic faith, whioh was thiB— that as it fell from the time of Our Lord and His apostleB, so it was in every succeeding-ageY that men were to be brought to the knowledge of! the truth by the authority of those whom Christ had established in the Church for the teaching of men. That was the reason why Catholics oould not join in the agitation for the introduction of the Bible into State schools, because if they did they would' '.practioally be falling into an: admission that it was. competent to every hoy and girl in a schpol to take the Scriptures into their hands and form their religious opinions for themselves. CatholioB would never consent to any such alteration of the basis ot its belief. In. concluding, the Archbishop repeated the 'pleasure he/felt at the inauguration of the oollege. sincerely trusted that it wjould hjs the opening of a great career of ptogreBB, and that it would form a new oentre of intellectual life find culture for future generations of Australian children—the ways and mpans of education that would fit. them for every position in this life, and tor their immortal destiny after death. (Cheers.), ; The Chairman next gave the toast of "/The Founder'of the College—The' Bisjhop o^BaUarat."', He said that if ever' a ship was' IjLundheil under favourable auspices, if eyjef a''college swas founded with every gvijaantee.jof success; it waB this College of thej'-Hp^y' J&host; at Ballarat. The oollege protector wd patrons man who n^yey put his band to anything/ but he madeif § suooess. (Hear, hear.) So far as hei, eoi$l<l,' j'nt|ge from circumstances, lie had,/no; hesitation in saying there was a g^wijpfftture before the establishment, and he wjas proud to fight the battle under such a leader as "I)r. Moore; for where he led who WO;iridt)e afraidto follow? (Applause.) ',The. Bishop of Ballarat, in replying, thanked the Arohbishop for the very kindly feeling he had expressed. They had, however, in Ballarat'a small field compared with Me]houi:tie,<and were oontent to do things in b amall way. Still .poverty was bo crime, eM tiiey ^ere quite^iappy with the situation, p^w^ ^'eari/j and. laughter;) That was tKef:fcmpiesk, ''flay //be': had exjwriehoed sympathy fceeniihbwn lOTjtiMw&iifc; of tsu olergyahd people, who jforVqMrterofa asked. He was quite sure that with the sympathy and co-operation of the clergy and laity the oollege would be a pronounced The toast of" The Clergy of Ballarat and the Dean of the Diocese" waB then honoured. . _ , Monsignor Hoyne, m response, expressed the belief that the college would he one of the best educational establishments m the ^fr^O'Farrell responding to the toast of the regular clergy, said it was a healthy indication that of late some 150 clnldren had been removed from the State schools and brought under the good influence of Catholic education. (Applause.) Prior Butler, replying to the same toast, said that on all occasions when the AxchbiBhop had touched on the eduoation^ question he had invested it with additional light and clearness. In the initiation of the College of the Holy Ghost they had cot something which the State did not supply It had been a constant charge against the Catholic Churoh that it had been too exclusive, and had not favoured education. It was a most wholesome sign that they had some competition. What they contended, from the educational point of view, apart from the religious aspect of the question, was that in any country where there was a system of education controlled by one central authority there would be stagnation.
