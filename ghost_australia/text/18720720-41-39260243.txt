Sentences of this kind may be formed into pretty and amusing devices. The process was described in the Christmas number of the Observer in 1870 under the general heading ' Parlour Experiments,' in Qie following terms :— Bisected Words.— Get a strip of card, say four inches by Beven, upon one side write part of a word, and the remaining letters upon the other side. Twist the card rapidly round by Btrings fastened to the ends, and the whole word will be visible ' QUIPS AND CRANKS.-No. LI. The following touching ode was written we can't tell when, concocted we know not how, conceived by an unknown brain, in a place no herein set forth, and sent us by means not told; but we believe it was wrung from the misty recesses of a juryman's brain during some highly exciting law case, where the legal fogs mustered so thick that the hand of justice could scarcely act. ..;.; ,. A JURYMAN'S LAMENT. . . Pity the sorrows of a patient man, — Doomed in this place to waste his precious time, ? . Far past the morning of a winter's day, Near to the ringing of the evening chime. *No drop of porter for his parched tongue, No cheering ditty for his saddened moods, No reminiscence of a saving balm, Smoothing the law's most dreary platitudes. Wife waiting for him in an angry way, Fast losing patience as the hours glide past; Still goes the pleading in its weary length, I'm in the Jury-box, condemned to fast. Man has no sorrow but he knows a cure, E'en tho' his luck is at its lowest steep; But what repays him for a day like this! Naught— though his time may have been passed in sleep. Law has no interest for such as I, Plodding thus onward down life's narrow rale; What does it matter how the case should end, Whether the plaintiff or defendant fail. They may perchance have much of pelf at stake, But a hot steak has greater charms for me; The pleas may be all good, but dinner hot Can please none better than it does M. P. Pity the sorrows of a weary man, Let him in. mercy now depart in peace, Though to be fee'd is good, a feed ia best, As meal-times go so do my woes increase. Mungo Park.
