An Explorer's Diary, By Diiamingo. XII. ON the night of the 19th we camped on the downs about nine miles due west of the Anthony lagoon. We lost sight of the creek on this course, nor could we pick it up the next morning, we therefore mile north, in the hope of getting a tributary coming from that direction, but got nothing but great plains, and, finally, Btuuted forest and low spinifex rises The boat had been intense, and the chance of a crook was be highly improbable that, after camping for a short time, we started back at about 10 o'clock, and reached the Anthony lagoon at daylight that day we spelled tLu horses, who had had a good perishing for we out of water in the evening a flock of pelicans alighted , they did not remain long, but presently flew away towards the north I had great hope of getting another creek coming from that direction, and the pelicans How so low that we all thought it could not be far ; therefore the morning of the 3rd of December I started alone, with a packhorse to carry water, to try and got as far north as possible Briggs meanwhile was busy making a pair of large now water bags to replace the ones lost on the packhorse Hedley had his time well occupied with his gun, which he was using with deadly effect on all fowl in the neighborhood On the 3rd December I started from the Anthony lagoon to see if I could get a creek of any sort to the north I had rather strong hopes of doing so at leaving for, as I mentioned before a flock of pelicans had left our camp and made nearly due north All the morning I travelled over fine downs country, but of course differing from the dry weather, and at about 1 o'clock reached the bauhinia forest that generally fringes the edge of the spinifex country Here I spelled for a couple of hours, as the weather was now very hot On starting again I kept a straight course north, and after crossing one or two slight rises came to a long stretch of coolibah fort st coarsely grassed and very full of holes Towards evening I got out of this and into spinifex once more, and at sundown was still on the same monotonous stretch of desert country I gave the two horses as much water as I could spare and, as there was nothing for them to eat, rode on without spelling more than half an hour. It was a fur moon, and the travelling not bad, so I made good progress , but always was it the same There was no possibility of telling whether the ground was more or falling, or whither I had crossed the vv ate i short of Cresswell creek The only difference I could notice was in the increased size of the timber through which I was riding, and this was a bad sign, as it looked as though I had got on to a tableland which would probably extend without a break to the heads of coast livers At 10 it began to be time to think about turning back, rib it was probable that my horses would not carry me to cure it I went on further without getting water I had made up my mind that if I could find any sort of watercourse I would chance following it, but there was not the ghost of one to be seen Always the same spinifex, gum trees, and not hills I went on until midnight, and then pulled up and put the question to the decision of on me I had a loose shilling in my saddle pouch, so 1 tossed up had, go on tail, turn back A good allegorical rendering I thought 'he first came over tossed in that spinifex desert uiiyilkntly turned her Majesty s face to the earth The circle Haul " Go back ' I lingered for some time in the hope of hearing some night bird in the distance, something that would give me a little hope of getting a creek, but there was no sound , the deepest silence reigned everywhere around I went two miles to the westward to see if there was any chance that way, but it was just the same dead level tableland, stretching probably for scores of miles to the northward From subsequent knowledge of the country I may say that had that shilling turned up head in all probability this diary would not have been written there was no grass, so it was no good turning the horses out, and I rode south disappointed once more, but I was not so well used to fruitless trips as I afterwards became On the line I went back the spinifex had been burned some unknown time before, and there was nothing but the anthills to break the dreary monotony of the bare ground Their striking resemblance to gravestones-by moonlight never struck me before that night. Altogether the scenery was not cheerful When I got out on the downs I gave the horses a short spell and a little water that I had left, and they carried me back to our camp without giving in, although I had had to ride pretty constantly since leaving There was nothing for it now but to stick to Cresswell creek, and hope for better luck further westward We started at sundown, and travelled down the creek by moonlight for some seven or eight miles before camping In the morning, as the traverse had not been sufficiently accurate, Briggs and Hedley went across to our camp of 30th November, to connect with that line, and I went on down Cresswell creek with the horses They overtook me about 10 o'clock, but up to that time we could find no water Many deep holes that in an ordinary season should have had plenty were quite dry, and the country presented a terribly parched appearance About the middle of the day we came to two small waterholes, and camped in the afternoon I rode on by myself, and found that the creek ran out into a great tract of flooded country a nice mixture of bluebush flats and polygonum swamps , all dry, of course I returned without being able to find any clue as to the course of the creek A small mob of blacks had been camped at the waterholes - which, from the number of death adders we saw there, we afterwards called Adder camp, but they must have seen us coming, for they had decamped, leaving some of their weapons and water vessels behind Round their camp were the heads and bones of some scores of pelicans On the next day we started again, and went due west, hoping that the creek would make again The most fearful piece of rotten country I ever rode over was the experience of the first eight or nine miles an endless blue bush flat, Bo cracked and Beamed that the horses could scarcely go a hundred yards without one of them coming to grief During the afternoon we got on to higher land, and camped at sundown for a spell, on some good downs country After 12 who saddled up again, and passed over good downs country until daylight, then we saw a belt of timber before us, and began to hope we had got a creek coming from the north The timber was on the edge of flooded country, and we were soon once more amongst the polygon ours We were in this until nearly 9 o'clock, then we crossed a plain of loose white dust, and then into a barren coolibah forest, and at half-past 11 pulled up The horses were very much distressed, both days having been intensely hot, and it was very doubtful if all of them would get back to Adder camp , it was useless going on, as it was risking the safety of the whole party without reason I caught a fresh horse, and told Hedley to do the same I told him to go south for about eight miles, and if he found nothing to return I went on west Briggs stopped to mind the horses- the most tedious job of all On a westerly course I soon came to high country, and saw it was useless to expect anything that way, so turned back and went to the northern end of the plain we had crossed, and had another search amongst the lignum and wattle scrub for a defined channel of some sort, but without any success I turned back to camp, and as I rode across that place I think I had the most vivid conception of the confines of hell that ever a man had Columns of white dust raised by the whirlwinds were moving about, and looked white hot as they towered above the quivering line of forest The heat haze was so great that every tree and bush looked twice its natural size, and appeared to be dancing up and down, and, as if in mockery, two or three light thunderstorms were gathering over head Small as they were they would have been of inestimable service to us, but they knew it, and carefully abstained from falls g A hen I got back to where we had halted I found the camp in a state of biege, Briggs having his hands full keeping the horses away from the waterings 'the poor brutes were very bad, and things altogether were cheerful Briggs had worked out the traverse time, and we were nearly 37 or 38 English miles from the Adder camp This was a long way to go back over such terrible country, but there was nothing else to be done to save the horses We packcdiip,undmadesoinotea, and at 0 Hedley came back After what I had seen of the country I was not much disappointed when he told us that, as far as he went to the southward, the flooded country continued, dry and unchanged, he had seen no sign of a water course of any sort As it got dark we started back-our only chance now to save the horses Strange to say, a fire seemed to possess a strong attraction for them, and whilst packing it was with great difficulty we could keep them out of it Hedley s horse and mine had had a dish of water a piece, when we stopped in the morning, we now (give them another and Briggs horse also, but it was as nothing to the thirst that consumed them Evidently we had got into the middle of a great tract of dead level country, where in flood time the creeks were lost, and their sluggish waters formed into great shallow lakes and stagnant swamps that soon evaporated, and left scorched and drought smitten plains instead-to be burnt up year after year by the pitiless summer burn, until another rare deluge should turn them into short lived lakes and swamps once more Fortunately the night was cool, and once or twice there was a feeble attempt at drizzling rain not enough to buy all hoped o sheet of tissue paper, but little as it was it cooled the air some whit, otherwise I scarcely think we should have got a horse back to the water At the earliest dawn we got back to the camp where we had spelled during the first night after stinting, and just then allow b1 itk cloud arose and hoping for a shower that would have sand us having to recross the terrible blue bush flat we pulled up and waited the cloud passed over without any rain falling, and beneath it broke the light of another burning hot d ii When we started we left one of the horses to bind He was an old horse, with one blind eye, and we used generally to let him follow , he missed us in the dark when we pulled up He never got in to the water, and removed saw a track of him again As the day got hotter the horses of coined to lose heart, and begin to struggle about in an aimless kind of funnel, giving us great trouble and taking a great deal of extra work out of the horses we were riding 'the flat was simply in- describable so bad was it that the horses, in spite of the thirst that was tormenting them, would round up in a mob and refuse to move, to fight tened did they get with constantly stumbling At last, when about four miles from the Adder camp, I sent Jillaga and Hedley on with the strongest horses, and stopped behind to bring out four who secured w ether than the road Two of them were mares, and they so one d to be suddenly possessed with every pel verso spirit of evil that exists they would go any way but towards the water, and only that the horse I was riding was unequalled) for endurance, they would speedily have reduced me to the necessity of walking At 11 or shortly after, a light thunderstorm fell, but the horses were I so far gone for any outward application to benefit them much They sucked up the tiny pools that vanished I almost on the nun ceased filling an 1 the II it was worse than before, for it was slippery after the shower One of the horses speedily fell, and I could not get him up again , the other soon followed his example, so I coupled the two men ps together to save my horse extra work driving them, and got to the water about an hour as to the others Buggy said that he had Hedley had had great trouble in getting the main lot back to watch , some of them seemed quite mud, it give them all they know to keep them , even when within half a mile of the water they would not go straight for it After an hour's spell, which was absolutely necessary for the horses, I started back with a water pack for the two I had left on the flat One was dead, the other dying, when I got there The dying one was an old front of mine I hold the poor fellow a head up whilst he drank the water I had brought it was the last kindness I could do him he was too far gone to rally, the infernal blue bush country had killed him I had not brought a pistol with me, so I had to leave him to die alone, under the bright moonlight on the desolate flooded flat, and as I rode back I felt, I think, more sorrowful than I would have done for a human companion A man knows what he his to expect in the outside country, but a poor devil of a horse never has the option given to him It was midnight when I got back Briggs and Hedley wore be sound asleep that they did not bear me ride into the camp, and no wonder, for this was the third night in the saddle During our absence the blacks had returned, and removed their weapons and water vessels , we saw nothing of them, however Two days after this disastrous trip I made another attempt to trace the course of the creek amidst the many disconnected flats and channels in which it was lost below our camp I succeeded in finding one that I thought might eventually lead to something, but it was too late to do anything that day As I came back on a more southerly course, I crossed a large polygonum swamp running north and south, but whether from north to south, or from south to north, noordniiiry mortal could tell We were now almost out of rations, and entirely dependent on game for our living, docks and pigeons being our principal articles of diet We bad enough flour for a few more days, sugar had been done some time, tea was only used once a day, but tobacco, strange to say, was plentiful, although that is an article that generally runs out first On December 111 started to try and follow the channel I had been on the day before Hedley went with me for the first fifteen miles in order to take back the packhorses that had to carry a supply of water out The creek looked rather promising where we left the bags and he turned back, but when I went on it suddenly disappeared and left me stranded in the middle of a stretch of forest without the ghost of an indica- tion as to the best course to follow However, following the example of Columbus, [ kept on steadily for the setting sun [TO Sr (OhTl RAID] "It s a
