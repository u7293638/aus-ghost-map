CRESWICK. Tuesday. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDNET.) The Literary Society met on Monday evening at the School of Mines, when the debate, “Socialism v Freedom,” was dis cussed at some length, the opener and re- spondent, Mr Kemphenkel and the Rev. Priest, being heartily applauded for their speeches. Next Monday evening Mr P. Costello will read a paper on “Marcus Clarke."

A “ ghost,” which changes horses in their stalls, moans, drags chains and throws stones on the roof of a certain house, is at present causing considerable agitation in the Dean district. A German band has been playing in the streets during the day, and seems to have made a good haul. Farmers hereabouts are delighted with the prospects of a splendid harvest during the forthcoming season. The crops are looking better, than they have done for this month for years, and, with a slight improvement in prices, it is hoped that 1596 will find thn turn in the tide of short prices, which has been harassing them so long. The borough council recently offered to give 50 tons of potatoes to any person who would dig or clear them off the council’s land at Dean within a week, which had been leased by a man named O’Hehir, who would not pay his rent nor clear the pota toes. When the industrious Creswick man got out there a couple of days later, it was found that the potatoes had been removed. Mr J. Manley, who had such a miraculous escape from a fatal accident on Saturday evening whilst crossing the line at the local railway station, is steadily improving, A horse attached to one’of Pauli Bros.’ delivery carte bolted this morning up Raglan street, but was secured before much damage was done.
