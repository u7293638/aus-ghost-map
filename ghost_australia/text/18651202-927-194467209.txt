LOUD FKANCIS DOUGLAS. The following singular story respecting the late Lord Francis Douglas — whose terrible fate amid the Alps is known to all — is taken from the Semaine Ddigieu.se of Nantes. The signature at the foot of the article is ' Edouard dc Kersabicc ' : — ' It is now exactly four years ago since the Marchioness of Queensberry, the mother of Lord Francis Douglas, having become a convert to the Catholic religion, suddenly quitted England with her three youug children and took refuge iu France. She fixed her abode first at Pouligueu, aud afterwards at Nantes, her motive for this step being to withdraw from the pursuit of those who wished to make .her change of religion the pretext for depriving her of a mother's rights. She left behind her three other children still in Protestantism — the Marquis of Queensberry, his younger brother, Lord Francis Douglas, and their j sister, Lady Gertrude Douglas. The latter shortly afterwards joined her mother at Nantes, where she soon became a Catholic, and received baptism in the chapel of the Sisters of St Vinccut de PauL The two youngest children of Lady Qucensbcrry wcrc baptised ou the same day ; the other, Lord Archibald Douglas, had been con vsrted previously at the same time as his mother. Subsequently the Lady Gertrude had completed her vocation by devoting herself to the service of the poor it one of the religious communities of London. Soon after the arrival of his sister Lord | tives hr.d, we are assured, a prcceplible ! effect on him, and he let fall on several occasions expression;-, indicatiug a dispo sition favourably disposed to examine and embrace the Holy Faitu. Having visited '. and spent some time in Germany aud at... - Rome, he returned to England iu tlie early part of the present year, and passed an examination with great credit for his com mission iu the Guards. He waa a youns man of much promise, as well on account of the excellence and amiability of his natural disposition as on account of his superior mental endowments and acquire ments. We have learnt from an iufonn ant on whom we can place full reliance, that during the few days immediately pre cediug the melancholy accident, Lord Francis Douglas showed himself more than ever inclined towards Catholicism. There was one of the Alpine guides to whom he was particularly attached. This man was a good practical Catholic, and Lord Frauds had followed him to church, and had at tended mass regularly ca Sundays. But what has struck us more than anything else, is the manner in which (as we are assured) Lord Francis behaved v.-heu the party reached the summit of the terrible mountain. During the halt which took place, one of the guides, says tho Timei account, was. 'frightened.' What really passed was, that tlie guide to whom Lord Francis was attached said, ' Gentlemen, there is great reason to fear that we may not be able to effect our descent without an accident ; therefore, let each of us think about his soul.' Then Mr. Hudson, who was a Protestant minister, took out his Bible and read ; Lord Francis went apart from the others, aud remained in eikuce and meditation for ii whole hour. Ou the same day the Marchioness of Queeusberry was in her garden in the Isle of Wight She was working and praying according to her usual custom. All at once she expe rienced a sudden revulsion of the heart ; she thought, she felt that her son was ill danger, aud she uttered a, fervent prayer to his angel guardian to protect him. For three days the impression remained on her' mind that Lord Francis was dying by fa mine. The same day a pious domestic, a fervent Catholic, had a vision, in which, she saw a young man covered with wounds, and in the last stage of inanition : a figure, habited as a monk, advanced towards him, holding out a radiant cross, which tho young man Lissed, and then expired. It was remarkable that whilst the remains of the other tm'ellers were found, nothing of. Lord Francis could be recovered, except his boots, which were unlaced, as if he had thrown these down the precipice. What was the fote of this young man ? Could he have fallen down a crevasse, and there have perished of hunger 1 If so, let us hope that it was his earthly purgatory, and the idedge of his eternal safety aud instant bliss. Who can doubt of the salvation of the child of so many prayers ? No one, cer tainly, who kuows this family, aud what great things the Lord hath doue for them.*1 A daring jewel robbery has been perpe trated in Sheffield. A well dressed man, attired iu black, with a pale face and dark complexion, and wearing a long black beard, ^ supposedjto be artificial, entered the shop of a pawnbroker, and stated that he wanted n gold wateh, mentiouicg the price that he would pay at about £12 or £13. There was nobody in the shop but Mrs. Gibson, who keeps it, and a female assistant. Mrs. Gibson took several watches out of a bos, but none seemed to suit him. She then removed a Ion? i?la=s carp out nf tk irin. dow, containing about forty gold watches and several gold Albert chains, which she placed ou the counter before hiin. He ex amined several of them, aud at last deter mined upon one, but he said he also wanted a gold chain, and asked her to reach some out of the window. She was in the act of doing bo, wheuie^oolry closed the case before him, put ii- under his arm, and walked out of the shop. Mrs. Gibson and her assistant began to shout ' murder,' which attracted people to the shop instead of setting them to run after the rogue, and before they could be informed of the loss she had sustained the thief got clear o£ A robbery is reported at Euston-squarc station. It appears that the guard of a, train from Liverpool to London, who had the custody of £1200 in gold, on arriving at the Euston station, asked the parcels porter to take it aud sign a receipt for the amount. The man refused, and an alterca tion ensued. The guard then left his vein to fetch some one else to sign for the mouey, but on his return, almost immediately, it was gone. It is said the company had insured the safe carriacc of the gold for .£1000. His Time was not yet Come! — A grinijy ludicrons incident of the cholera epidemic at Constantinople, now happily diminishing, is furnished by tho Leoant Herald : — One of the dead-carts was pro ceeding with its ghastly load to the ceme terv when the driver and his assistant twr ceived a Croat lying, as 3t seemed, dead by the roadside: They stopped the cart, and, after a very hasty look tit the body, thought the right thing was to give it burial, and so bundled it into the cart, aud proceeded on their way. On arriving at the cemetery the contents of the vehicle wore as usual, shot into the waiting pit The shaking en route and tliis rough awakener roused the Croat from what appeared only to be a drunken trance, and before tho hasty filling-in of the pit had proceeded beyond a few shovelsfuls, he scrambled to his feet The surprise of the cartmen aud grave-diggers may be imagiued ; but. whether from pare diablerie or some more vicious impulse, the story goes that they insisted burying him dead or alire. The sobered savage, however, managed to climb oat of the trench, and, vigorously stoned by his would-be inhamers, fled across the country as fast as tear and a perfectly healthy pair of legs -MuiJ carry Mm.

'. E I In order to enforce this startling deduc- ? U ! rioa. ' Major '' Mercer gives as a text at ! rj j the beauining of his pamphlet that p.ortioa i j. j of the 11th chapter of the second book of ? ,e i Saniuc-i, in which David is represented as ; .:. : putting Uriah, the Hittite, in the forefront i ir ; of the battle, with the intent to get him : a | despatihed. Captain Mercer's widow re- : -t i ceived the mmsl pension, but ' ilaj.jr'' ; le i Mercer thought she ought to have more, '?_ lt ; and wrote to that effect to the Duke, the i j i Premier, and the Queen. Our readers will ; j. ! not be surpris«i to learn that his advocacy j j was not successful. He now, by way of j ] j revenge, publishes this pamphlet, in which ! , | he accuses the couamandcT-in-chief of cow- j ^ j ardice in the battle-field, and of a can- : n ' spiracy between his Royal Highness zni ] ^ ; General Cameron to murder a brave officer, i .£ j Alcogethc-r, a more extraordinary produe- j ' j tion never issued from the press. Oar j ; j most charitable supposition with regard to I jj j its writer is that when he wrote it he was j I ' OTercome.' in the same manner as he was i ! when he was found lying on the ground by : ?p \ two artiiltn- men. | ^ i The Tim** contains aa advertisement I j ! which will have interest f ;r those who con- i j i «rn iheaistires with the histojy of old j g ? Loadcn. Most of these know the Old \ K ' KummuES. m Coretxt-gardea Market. The i ~ j place has tsisted for the best part of a j ~ j couple of centuries, though of course it has ? ~ j been rebuilt since its original opening. At \ 1 1 first it was, as its name (a corruption of i |f j the Arabic ' Hammam,' a bagnio or bath) ; * i imjjlies, a place for sweating baths — we j ^ i have now cocse round again to the Turkish j = ! bath, «ith which many dily persons are 1 ~ I killing themselves. Bat it became a ? I i tavern, and at one time had an undesirable ; I 1 repiitadflD. In Hogarth's picture, 'Mid- j , i night Modern Conversation/' there is a j ^ ; drunken parson, Ford, who died in this , | ; house Ttere is a etrange and grim ghost \ e | story connected with the death of this pro- ? , ! fiigate A waiter at the Hunimums had \ c | been absent for some time, and returned, ; i not knowing that Ford was dead. Coins I *_ i down to the cellar, he met Ford '. Going ? ) down aaaiu, he met him a eecond time- ? ?^ i When he came up, he asked some of the i i people of the house what Ford coald be j 1 doing there. They told him of the death, j e i He was seized with a raging fever, ia ' 0 j which he lay fur a long time. When he ! e I re-covered Lc said that he had a message to I ° ; deliver to some womaa from Ford, but he i e : was not to reveal what, nor to whom. He j ^ j went out, and was fallowed, but -was lost j 11 ; sight of near ,St Paul's. He came back, ; r i aud said that be had delivered the message, ! '' j and that the woman, in terror, cried ont, ; ' i ' then we are all undone.' Dr. Johnson ; '* j appears inclined to believe that there was j 9 j soniething supernatural in the tale. The ? 3 j house, since 1 have known it, has been a j s . very unromantic place. In one's younger ; 1 j days, when we stayed at parties until four j 1 j or five in the morning. I have occasionally j ' j sought a bed at the Hnmmnrns. and for j 1 j three Lours of uneasy slumber, and a j ' | toierabls breakfast, I have often paid the i ; I seven shillings ungrudginglj — the tariff j i non' seems to me to have been high. Bat, j I j high or low, I shall pay it no more, for j ' j for here is die conclusion of the history of j the old house : — ' Old Hnmmutns, Coveut garden, London, 15th of September, 1865.
