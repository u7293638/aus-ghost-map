MINING RETROSPECT. The great facts of the year just past are, so far as the Ballarat district is concerned, the development of the rich alluvial grounds in the Creswick division and the increasing confidence felt in the permanence of the quartz resources of this gold-field generally. Early last 1 year tbenew Creswick grounds were open ing out their ,wealth, and 'since then heavy yields, as disclosed -in the summary - below, have marked the weekly «and monthly returns. As we write, the grounds in question form the'richest alluvial field in Victoria. And:.there is little doubt, if.any, in the minds.of those most; familiar'with the locality, that a wide and paying extent of country lies beyond as the •ontinuation of the present opened up ground. Thus from Spring Hill, Kingston, and Smeaton to Clunes and 'the Loddon there is in all probability a reach of virgin .territory affluent in alluvial gold, and possibly also in' gold-bearing quartz lodes. In other parts of the .district alluvial mining has been rather under a .cloud. In the Central and Buninyong divisions the Hand and Band,: Prince of "Wales, Bonshaw, Leviathan,- and one or two other companies' of less prominence are either dead or in arlkulo mortis, and the occurrence of drainage diffi culties on the -Sebastopol plateau, as the outcome of the.cessation of work by the dead companies' low flown the valley, has led to considerable apprehension for the future of alluvial mining.along; thedine ofthe. old Golden Point and its tributaries. Winter’s Free hold is still developing its ground, and. with fluctua ting fortune, while the City...of Ballarat" has’not yet bottomed its shaft. 'To these two outpost companies. we have to look' for the. future of our alluvial field here close at home, and though the value of their stock has lessened during the last year, as it did during the year-1874,' that must.not be taken as. decisive of the actual or prospective intrinsic value of the mines. Any day’s;;, revelations ..may place either mine in quite a new light; before the investing public, and may give evidence of probable wealth that would at a bound place the -value , of stock at a rate 200 or 300 per cent- above present quotations. This possibility, as everybody knows, is an' essential element: in: so un certain a vocation as mining. The' alluvial fields of Haddon, Smythesdale, Scarsdale, Springdallah, &c; ;)< have maintained their yields very well, though there have been some names, as the Golden Lake,.Golden Stream, &c.;, falling, out of. the list of regular yields there, as in the Central division. These are also a necessary element in alluvial mining, for it is easier to compute the duration of an alluvial than of a quartz venture, and there must be constantly some one or other - alluvial' company giving up, the ghost. But in' the Grand Trunk Company’s mine, Spring dallab, a gold-bearing lode of quartz has been found, which promises well for future prospecting. At Staf fordshire Reef and other places in' the same direction, too, there has been a revival in . quartz mining, while at Blackwood the old and new rich lodes in the Sultan mine, and the yields in Mounter Bros, and home other mines there, go to show that quartz mining is growing in importance all round us. So we see that, as was predicted years agOj the great alluvial returns that in the past used to' overshadow the quartz yields have gradually fallen off in the older por tions of the district,—whilst the" quartz returns have been steadily advancing. This must he regarded as a most hopeful outlook for the future. Early ■ lost yeaiv I when we penned " our retrospect of tfiat date,! Spanhake’s claim in Ballarat- East-was creating a good deal of attention, and its excellent luck led not only to 'great, hopes, but to no little actual adventure., Nor has the activity displayed in that direction been barren of result or" reward. On the contrary, the new offshoots from and connections of the .old Black Hill Company have revealed great resources in lodes traversing the-Black '.Hill. Flat, while the Countess, Duchess, ' and other companies on Bakery Hill have proved, and are' now proving, that the southern extensions of the same belt of lodes are satisfactorily rich-in the precious -metal. Satisfac torily, that is, in relation to the modest expectations which we have learnt here in Ballarat to cherish, and which are full of reasonably safe promise of a per manent future for the industry in question, seeing that the Llanberris and Black Hill Companies long ago demonstrated the possibility of very low average yields from quartz being made to return a profit to the exploiter. But when we find that ouf general averages are increasing as our works have progressed, "there is every reason for anticipating that we are literally only just scratching, so to speak, even at this late period in our mining history, the vast resources in auriferous quartz which lie under our feet in every division of the district. The Sovereign Company, on the head of the Canadian and White Horse Ranges, has not yet proved the 1000 feet depth it was ex pected to test, but it has shown that large bodies of etone are there which will yield paying results under economical treatment. AU along .those ranges, as far as Hiscooks, where the Imperial Company has been paying its way. on low yields, there are fields- to occupy for, we may say, generations to come. At Clunes, the oldest quartz field, in the colony, new dis coveries have recently been made -which go to show ihat there is probably a new life commencing in the industry there. Last October a new reef-was struck in or near Service street; and only a few days ago:a gold-bearing lode was struck at a depth of 1000 feet in the Clunes Company's mine, that company being one of the first to mine for quartz gold in Victoria. A few months since, at Pleasant Creek, the Magdala Company, a Ballarat venture, struck a golden {ruta at the unprecedented depth of 1681 j feet, a depth, if we mistake not, below almost all the quartz mines in the world. We only men-; tion that fact here as corroborative of the evidence disclosed in our own district in favor of the permanence, and equal, if not greater, richness of our quartz lodes as the depth increases. In these revelations we are furnished with what seems to be solid ground for ex pectations of' a steadily prosperous future for the mining industry, that is if we can keep clear of bubble blowing, and can stick with sturdy tenacity to hard vork, and can practise patient thrift as well. With these, upon the evidence already before us, the future of mining is ensured. And it is gratifying to know that the art of bubble-blowing has of late fallen very much into desuetude. Even the splendid alluvial dis closures in the Creswick division have not led to (he feveresh excitements which some people looked for. At one "melancholy period in our history a thousandth part of such a “show” as that afforded by the Spring Hill grounds in the Creswick .division, would have made speculators wild with prospectusing ventures. But we have learnt some wisdom, it seems, from the past, and thus it is that a new field can.be opened, andp eople not go into hysterics or devote their days and nights to the labor of prospectus-drafting and bubble-blowing. Perforce, too, of circumstances or of greater sagacity, the great litigations of the past are comparatively tnownjno more. True, the great Jarndyce v. Jarndyce suit, known as Learmonth v Bailey and others, for the recovery of the Egerton mine, or damages therefrom, is still alive, and is a most portentous fact in our legal history. The latest phase in the suit is the order of the Supreme Court for the payment into the hands of a receiver of the current proceeds of the mine pending the further litigation on the issues raissd, Mr W. H. Gaunt, police- magistrate, being appointed inspector or receiver in the matter. Another unpleasant incident of the year has been the collapse of the Hand and Band Company, and its falling into the maw of the National Bank. The bank sold up the company under a mortgage, and set tributors to work the mine, finally selling the mine away to a few private persons, with out offering a chance to the Hand and Band Company to recover possession. The company, disputes the legality of the bank’s action, and being fortified therein by the opinion of counsel, the company has initiated legal proceedings to test the questions raised. In the meantime, however, the party that bought the 'mine from the bank has stopped work, tributors have been dismissed, and the substance of the mine frppma bo have gone whilst the Hand and Band Com pany has been struggling with its adverse circum stances. There was a general opinion here that the company had been unfairly treated by the bank, and one of the results has been the dismissal by the bank authorities of the local manager, who had the carriage of the sale of the mine. Mining legislation has not much moved during the year, and we are still without a law to make mining on private property possible in a proper way in the interests of , mining. When Mr Belcher early last year was contesting the South-Western Province—of which this gold-field is a part—he said at the Me . chanics’lnstitute here that “he heard "so little cry ’ from the miners about a Mining on Private Property Bill that he was led to infer they were very little interested in the matter.” This is certainly a not altogether unwarrantable inference, for the miners as b rule have given more attention to any political cry " fhon to a mining one. A bill to prevent accidents in inines has passed, and under it there are inspectors, and enquiries are sometimes held, and now and then a manager gets into hot water; and a company is made to feel some measure of liability. We do not frnnnr, for it is as yet too early to have tables of aver ages as a basis of comparison, whether the new law is lessening the number of mine casualties, but in so far ' as "it goes to increase the sense of liability for the results of accidents, the new law will, no doubt, bo of Value! There has been a conference of delegates from mining boards, convened at the instance of the • Mining Department, to prepare a code of regulations applicable to the, whole colony, and the code so pre pared in the rough has been issued; for the considera tion of the several boards. We were the first some years ago to. point out the absurdity of the existing system, and to urge the abolition of the mining boards, OS legislative bodies, and the adoption of one code of rules for the whole colony. Judging; from, the mea-", Bures lately taken, as abeady mentioned, it is probable (bat we shall soon have but one code/aud after that the continuance o£ the mining boards in existence will- hardly be possible, save -as consultative bodies, or Jas .bodies, dealing. with some purely local business, such as, the management of gold field commons' arid the disposal of Crown lands within auriferous districts. But we are not-at all sure that even for those purposes the. boards will be required, seeing that ’other local cover with their jurisdictions the whole area of the colony, and could be made available for the interests in question. ; The yield of gold for the past year in this district cannot be yet ascertained with accuracy, even after the fashion of the usual approximate returns of the mining authorities, for the returns for the lostquarter are not yet available. But there is little doubt that the returns, when complete, will bo equal to those of 1874; and probably superior. In connection'with this question, it may ' be| stated, .that while the ' average quartz yield for the. district was less in the last re ported, quarter—that ending 30th September—than in either of the previous quarters, the average for Ballarat proper was higher in September than in June, and higher in June than in March. The average for the March, quarter was 5 dwt 12’49 gr; for June, 5 dwt 20‘41 gr; for September, 6 dwt 2070 gr; and; we leafn from good authority that the latter average has been maintained and probably exceeded during the last quarter of the year. From the returns for the three, quarters already issued, we find that the quartz gold won amounted to 94,713 oz, and if a third of that total be added, we get a total of 126,284 oz for .the year 1875, as against the official total of 105,888 oz . for ' the year 1874. We think this is a probable calculation as to : the quartz gold for 1876, and when we consider.the rich yields from the Gres wick division, we .conclude that the : alluvial deficits in the Central division or else where will be more than counterbalanced. The" weekly reports, of managers of companies publishediin. our columns enable us to set down the winnings of all the public companies;' or nearly all, and those returns furnish a total of 146,356 oz for the year 1875. But th them have to be added the winnings of many co operative companies who make no return at all or only to the mining registrars, so that taking into, ac count all the facta and probabilities, we conclude that the gold obtained in this district during the past year may be estimated in' round figures at about 160,000 oz. i The companies ..whose,, returns are made by i managers in our columns, or: come to us in an equally reliable manner, are as follow, with the gold won set down in; ounces:-—■ Argyle, 746; Albion, 454; Bute, 2186:.Bunyans, 1388; Black Hill South, 64; Baron, 8655; Blue Peter, 48; Black Hill, 2592; "Central, 120; Crown, 32; Countess, 343; Carters, 77; Cunnings, 426; Clarkes, 36; Duchess, 544;: Derwent Jacks, 245; Eldorado, 1939; East Koh-i-Nobr, 39; Eclipse, 102; First ; Chanoe, 643; Grand .Trunk," 2688; ~Golden Lake, 1538; Gostellos, 1 19; Golden Beef, 89; Hawkins, 4184; Hero Extended, 1746; Hopewell; 271; Home ward Bound, 42 ; Happy "Valley, 17; Imperial, 825; Junction, 17;' Jacksons, 146; Key, 505; Kingston- Park,' -356; : Koh-i-Noor, 67; Kitty Consols, 781; Lowers’.
