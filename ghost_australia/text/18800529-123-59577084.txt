MISS M'ARINTHIA'S LAMENT FOR HER DEFUNCT POODLE, TOODIE. To me more dear than bridal ring He was! Ah, do not chide; If I am tearful while I sing, I miss him from my side. But 'tis in vain my cheek is pale, Distraught my weary brain; Not all my efforts can avail To bring him back again. And though Ill mourn him night and day, Again he'll ne'er appear; My thoughts will be with him alway, And likewise many a year. And when Tm laid beneath the ground, In a few short months at most, Tm sure his tail it will be found, A wagging at my ghost. mmmm mm ma
