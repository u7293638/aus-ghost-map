POET'S CORNER. ORIGINAL POETRY. AN EPISTLE FROM S**** TO D******. I. May thy hoary age be joyless—still disturb'd by thoughts of me; The fiend that haunts the guilty mind, thy fixed companion be. Thy coward heart will shrink within thy vengeful breast at last, With dread of future punishment, for deeds long gone and past. II. I long to meet thee once again—for thou art still my foe; I long to meet thee once again, in these dark shades of woe. Then with a grim unearthly smile, my ghost shall pass thee by, And turn on thee, revengefully, an injur'd spirit's eye. III. Oh! how my heart has fear'd to meet thee on "inspection day;" Oh! how my heart has fear'd to see thee dress'd in field array. And more I dreaded meeting thee, when iron'd and alone, In yon dark cell thou tortur'd me, and mock'd my dying groan. IV. Yes, I have met thee on the earth, and shrunk from none but thee; And I have seen thy vengeful eye, fix'd in stern wrath on me. And often from that with'ring glance, all fearfully I've hied, And shunn'd the man that urg'd me on to tempt destruc- tion's tide. V. But, tyrant, thy dark reign is past, and thou art joyless now; Thy guilty soul starts back aghast, and damps with fear thy brow. Eternity looks awfully—thou shrinkest from the blow, But death's sure aim will shortly lay thee (proud oppressor) low. VI. I long to meet thee once again, for think not I've been taught By vengeful fiends to favour thee by one forgiving thought. No—curs'd with thy own heart's remorse, from peaceful moments free, May thy hoary age be joyless--still disturb'd by thoughts of me. VALENTIA.
