Another Case of Zfeprosy. 1 The opinion whether we have no fre- j quehtly^^xpriiSJÂ»ed, as to the existence of leprosy among the blacks of the Alligator River district has at last been verified beyond the ghost of a doubt. An aboriginal, native of that district who came into Palmerston on Saturday last at the suggestion of Mr. P. Cahill (who was buffalo hunting for a couple of years at the Alligators), has been examined by Dr. O'Flaherty and found to be suffering from true leprosy. Mr. Cahill had a shrewd suspicion that the man was a leper, and by a little judicious deceit man- aged to entice him to come here to be " cured " by the doctor. After the Medical Officer had satisfied himself as to the nature of the disease, the native was conveyed across to the leper camp to break the monotony and lonesome ness of the solitary Chinaman's existence there. It is now common gossip that when the Government Resident's party was at the Alligator River recently Mr. Cahill pointed out several natives who bore outward and visible signs of leprosy more or less advanced in its terrible progress, and it is expected that the Resident's next report will contain references to the matter. It is the belief of Mr. Cahill and others well acquainted with the blacks of the Alligator district that a hundred at least could be found suffering from leprosy developed to such an extent that there could be no mistaking it in some cases more pronounced than the poor wretch who has just been transported to the leper camp.
