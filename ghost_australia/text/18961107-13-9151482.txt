SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1890. Sir Josia"H Lister's address as President of the British Association is a striking illustration of that mastery over Nature, that success in wresting now service- from natural forces, which is the glory of modern science. Sir JosEPH JjIstkii told the story of how, in the course of a single generation, the discovery of anaesthetics has robbed surgery of the terror of suffering. He told, too, in accents of singular modesty, the story of how he himself, following the hint of Pastkuii's great discoveries, had established the antiseptic law in surgery. Under the old treatment a man with a. broken leg was often as directly poisoned by the ferments of putrefaction as if he had taken a dose of strychnine. Sir Jo.ski'h Lister's discovery sobbed Hiirgcry of its worst terrors. A great , hospital in the pro-Lister days was a more fermenting nullity of gangrene. In the Munich Hospital, for example, 80 per cent. of all wounds were affected with gangrene. Hut on ft given day all cases in that hospital were dressed with the antiseptic preparation, and from that hour not a single case of hospital gangrene has been known in the institution ! Pytemia, and erysipelas too, vanished like unclear ghosts before the breath of Sir Joseph Lister's carbolic acid bottle The great surgeon then went on to describe the Rontgen rays, the discovery of which he declares is " the most " astounding of all results of purely " physical inquiry." After reciting the various services surgery has already extracted from the Piiintgen says, Sir Joseph Lister said that already we have the hint of another way in which the Rontgen rays may influence medicine. The human skin if long exposed to their action suffers from a sort of " aggravated " sunburn ;" and this suggests that the rays may be used to transmit a healthy stimulus to internal organs. Our own columns, by the way, have already reported the application of the Rontgen rays as a curative force in the case of cancer. But let the three new forces with which human science, during a single generation, has armed itself be put side by side anaesthetics, the antiseptic treatment of wounds, and the Rontgen rays. Where else in the whole records of human science can be found three such " victories of peace," three such magnificent contributions to the safety and happiness of human life ! ' But another scientist, M Cvmii 11 WILLASTON, gives in the Cos; politan another and even more ] turesque illustration of that mast of physical nature which the pry and restless intellect of man achieving so rapidly The li of M Pi, vmm vision s science is i microbes but suns He tells the site of the manner in which the federal astronomers of the world are carry i out that great scheme for photographing the heavens which has been in one tion since 1945?

Or what force which I cannot make the event of its need But, curiously enough, to the voice of the great English surgeon, and that of the famous French astronomer, has to be added that of a great Scottish scientist Lord Ki I warrant he supplies exactly that sobering check the human name) which this generation more than half intoxicated with its own performances, sorely needs A few months ago all the world joined to do honour to Lord Ki it in on the occasion of his jubilee celebration and Lord Kflmn delivered a singular little homily on the limitations of human knowledge "One word, he said " characterises the most strenuous of " the efforts for the advancement of " science that I have made during fifty " five years, that word is-J<n/u> ' " I know no more of electric and iron notice force, out the relation between " other, electricity and ponderable " matter, or of chemical affinity, than I "know, and tried to teach to my " students, fifty years ago ' The truth is that the boundaries of the universe and Us secret retreat before every advance of the prying brain of man Science translates into a sort of algebra of its own the order and relation of phenomena , it expresses in rational for nina the mode in which the discovered forces of nature work , but it is as far off as over from reading " the riddle of the uni ' verse " It cannot resolve all objects into causes nor all causes into one cause botany disc of light we call science no doubt widens continually, but so does also the encompassing circle of darkness A little wholesome humility may well sober the half intoxicated pride of modem science 'the looker on who has been watching lately the name and seemingly confused pulling of the voices by European statesmen must be sorely tempted. just now to King aside his cable news and dismiss the whole diplomatic situation as an insoluble enigma Within the last ten days a succession of stone has reached us more or less startling in charactoi-soino messages complonion tary of former ones, others m apparent conflict with them all evidently need is a key which is missing, and which conjecture cm most imperfectly supply Prince Bismarck, not for the first the second, or the third time, has sprung disclosures upon the world, on this occasion one obvious solidarity of the revelations being to persuade Germany a partners in the Triple Alliance that they have been filled with The Emperor William has shown anger, the genuineness of which there seems no reason to doubt, and has endeavoured to reassure him allies At the same time the substantial truth of the Bismarck assor tions has been as good as admitted The Em Snail's injunction to the ox Chancellor to be silent, and the some what feeble official announcement that Prince Hoh_.N-.oiie is the only person competent to decide when state secrets shall be revealed, carries that inference. Three or four subsequent developments worth noting have followed. Firstly came an unexpected and quite unusual signal of friendliness towards England from the Parisian paper, he Temps. Next an announcement by AL Pobik don-street, a veritable power in Russia during the last reign at any rate, to the effect that no formal treaty, only a cordial understanding, existed between his country and France, demonstrations and ebullitions of enthusiasm notwithstanding. These may not improbably have been the utterances of simple per- plexity and bewilderment. They were quickly succeeded by rumours that Russia was once more playing France's game by worrying Great Britain about Egypt, and that Germany, in conjunction with her allies, was pursuing her old policyoftemporarilysupporting England upon such an issue, being decidedly unwilling to seen general pacification of Anglo-French disputes. It is a tangle to which we have certain clues, although they are far from sufficient The fact that the whole crisis was made in Germany, and that the provocation emanated deliberately from Prince Bismarck, was of course, enough to shew that German interests were to be served, and there was no difficulty in aiming at the cot clusion that the attitude of the 0>a upon his tour had been disconcerting t German), and had given her oldest most sagacious, and most unscrupulous statesman cause for keen uneasiness There is no improbability in the assumption that, if Bismvuck were convinced the helm was loosely held in the vessel heading dangerously), her quite capable of springing forward in his old masterful manner, and giving an unauthorised turn to the wheel What li is to be considered is the plot able effect of his disclosure that Get man), behind the back of her allies had for six years been coquetting with' Russia " to break up the Inst "Alliance' was the object assigned to lines surely somewhat hastily That his words would have a most irritating effect in Austria and Italy, the ex Chancellor must, of course have been aware this was inevitable but his journ it has since been at pains: to remind these powers that the Triple Alliance itself is surrounded by various reservations and supplementary treaties of much the same kind as the secre- arrangement between Russia and Germany the argument evidently being that such arrangement was not reconcilable with German) s loyalty to her allies This is language intended to soothe Punco Bi--Mvitri.\ calculation seems to have been that where he must necessarily offend he could after wards placate that his real object was to provoke coolness and hostility towards Germany from the central European. powers is unthinkable The alienation of friends can be no gain to German) The ox Chancellor s revelations had to be lead outside Austin, and Italy, and it is in their probable effect elsewhere that his arm should be sought Upon this point, again, there have been various and conflicting statements Punco Bism week's press organs have vouchsafed the information that the existence of the secret treaty was contested hitherto out of deference to Russia, but that the purpose of the disclosure now was to pieventa,?«;v"0(.//( mail between Germany and England. 'The note conveyed in this utterance, that Germany will no longer pay much deference to Russia in view of the Courts disappointing conduct, may be genuine enough But there is too suspicious an air of frankness about this subsequent confession of the Bismarckian motives A very cordial understanding between Germany and England England is not one of the political signs of the times and if it were there is nothing in this to excite Prince Gisevius apprehensions, despite his general antipathy) to the English Once more, friendliness from other nations England Austria or Italy-is not what Germ my has to fear and the chance of closer relations with the great naval power, which has hitherto held watchfully aloof, is certainly not a prospect to precipitate Punco BisM vi ch s interference There are other prospects, how over, which might Symptoms of a drawing to gether on the part of Russia and England, with its (corollary, an interim more or less conduit between 1 France and England, would be decided menace to the policy which Prince Bism viteh. consistently pursued during his long years of office he angled often to gain Great Britain as an avowed supporter of the Triple Alliance , Great Britain in agreement with the Dual Alliance m stead would be a consummation which the astute ex Chancellor would run great risks to avert It cannot be forgotten that the secret of city disclosure must, as l.isxivuek knew, be double but relied on its effect Not only would Austria and Italy be necessarily disturbed, but France would be dismayed and bitterly mortified at discovering the duplicity of the ally on whom she was showering such theatrical demonstrations of confidence 'has not improbably was the barrel which Prince Bism vite k loaded with ball cartridge, and it is not a wild guess to conjecture that the shot has gone home 1 rene li pressure upon Russia for visible signs of the friendliness she has professed may easily explain the fact that once more St Petersburg has assumed a monotony attitude towards England upon the Egyptian question 'that the Czar's Government now any more than formerly contemplates turning any real hazard upon this issue is unlikely, but with a i renewed demonstration of antagonism between the two courts the ends of German diplomacy would be served for the time being Whatever truth there may be in such speculations, one undoubted effect of this lively international episode will be to weaken the public estimate of the importance of permanent alliances lho'lnplo Alliance is drawing into old ago, but has never, so far as the wet Id knows, been used to subset va an) immediate end It has been at last a vague and carefully guarded provision against contingencies When practical matters of states had to be under taken it has been invariably superseded by other combinations hurriedly formed according to the needs of the incident, as vision Germany, France and Russia acted together in the far East and when Austria, Italy, and England. were the only powers pressing in concert for a coercive policy towards 'Turkey 'The world sees now that the control European alliance, though it still Uganda, is and long has been hedged round with stipulations and subsidiary treaties which might as likely as not render it imperative in any given case The conviction that successive British Governments have acted wisely in keeping aloof from engagements so complex and yet so vague will be immensely strengthened in consequence Miranda being the Prince of VA nee Ruth duty, The Argus office will be closed it 10 a.m., and it opened at 9 a m for the convenience of advertisers Ontus unit mUtr tabernacles may be left at the hide into use (during the day.
