THE PHILOSOPHY OF GHOSTS. A sad tragedy once happened in our quiet illage. A poor woman drowned herself and her baby io a tiny stream that runs through the further end of the village. Before long some were to be found who had " heard tell as how " there was summat" to be seen every night at a certain hour. So-and-so had " seed " it. " Now, exactly opposite to the scene of the tragedy there stood a picturesque old cottage, with a well-kept garden in front of it, in which cottage lived an old lady of the name of Mrs. Dodd.
