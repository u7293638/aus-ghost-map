THE UNION OF THE CHURCHES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BENDIGO INDEPENDENT. SIR,— From the beginning of hte Rev. Dr. Barry's letter of the 3rd instant, it would appear that I wrote my letter of July 29th under the impression that I was writing my lust words on tho present - 1 con assure you I was under no , such impression. 'As Dr; Bdrry biVnaelf knows, I have all along anticipated, his lecture; and )in,. ; cop-»; 'firmaiion of this, there is need only to refer to ibis concluding paragraph of my letter of , July 22od;—“My heart is exceedingly re joiced at tho near prospect of his (Dr. Barry's) lecture.” Hence, when I made the summing up in my last letter, my i purpose was not to close the controversy, but ns I staled, .“to place before your readers the position’ bf tho present eonlrovcrsy.” Tho Kov, Dr, Barry bos been so given to wander ing from tho terms of his challenge, that periodical summing up is necessary. Tho terms of his challenge ,woro-, those“ May 1 hog of him (Mr,-Sadlior) that ho will show from Scripture proof against tho Immaculate Conception, and that ho will -furnish; ;( I shall not ho exuding) say, tlnco of Tho ancient fathers, to whosoi authority-ho' appeals, sup porting of course, the roreronoo by,tho pass ages from tho fathers selected;” , 1 1 In reply, I proved that’ tho dogma is not found in Scripture, and tliiit, in the words of Popo Gregory tho Groat, Christ “Al-OXE was* born truly holy.” Dr. Barry has not boon able lo refute a single argument, I Imvo used, neither has be attempted lo prove that I bavo misquoted, or misinterpreted one passage from either the Holy Scriptures.or tho fathers. I now pass to another of Dr. [Barry's misropre* sontations. Ho says“Now, wjiafc position has Mr. Sndlicr assumed [.with- regard to tho very important question of, tho Immaculate j Conception? This,; Ho dfjelarcs t. that; ilhe 1 Blessed Virgin, tho prodontined of the eternal Son of God, was in tho very first hour of her being conceived in-original-' sin—that is, she became a child of wrath, of raalvdio-! tion, of.aversion; hatred to God; wos [handed over to tho empire of Satan, was slave; of the! devil, and .aousignod to 1 corruption and death.” Dr. Barry assorts that I “declared" thane sentiments. I say I did not, and chal lenge Dr. Barry to produce his proof. 1 Assor tioiv-and proof arc two different things. < { jl have not once expressed my private opiniorf as to tho nature of tho Blessed Virgin Mary, nor have I over laid.that‘there was “an‘absolute purification anterior to ! the ‘Annunbjetion.” What I proved was ihat St. Thomas, 1 , .Aquinos hold that tho Blessed Virgin , Mary whs con ceived in original sin, .end 1 was afterwards made free from all sin. But that )8,tho''tos timouy of St. Thomas, whom DlV Bapi{y calls “(ho great lliool.ogian ;” .tho opinion'is not mine. Dr. .Barry, has; most conveniently dropped St. Thorpas- wlter occusing'jhbh of 1 inconsistency- I,proved, that liisatea/ation 1 of ; t.bo saint is, .absolutely groundlcs's 1 ,' for St/ Thomas is in perfect harmony with himfeolf on-I this point. Since I gave this proof. St/’ Thomas Aquinas has practically been blotted, out of, Dr. Barry Vlktltrsi i ‘I-hold in a former,; lot tor, and hold still, that ha owes Co ypui; readers some explanation* of, his altitjidoi to ; tho saint. I do not soy 1 agro6;)vuh St* Thomas. But the opinions whioh dDr.j Barry challenged mo to -produce wore those'of tho fathers. These aro the opinions' in my letters; and St. Thomas Aquinas’s opinion is added to them.
