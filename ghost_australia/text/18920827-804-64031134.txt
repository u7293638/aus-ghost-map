THE CONQUERING HERO COMES. It is whispered across the waves, through the cable man, that :-" Sir Gt. K. Dibbs has sailed from San Francisco in the B.M.S. Mariposa, on his return to Sydney. Sir M. H. Davies is also a passenger by the same steamer." There is some- thing touching in the juxtaposition of these names. The Premier of New South Wales is returning with Boyal honors thick upon him ; he is the Australian who captured the cautious Briton, and laid siege to the heart and mahogany oi everyone worth knowing in the world's metropolis. He swept through the home of culture, caste, cash, and consequence, and came out unscarred save for the inevitable mark of K.C.M.GK He gave Australians a bold and not undesirable advertisement in London, and made a continent " all right," so we are told, with the financiers of Europe. He also damned Chicago. When he plants his feet on Australian shores at Woolloomooloo he is sure to receive a startlingly enthusiastic welcome. But with Sir Matthew Davies the situation is dissimilar. His Mr. Andrew Carnegie, One of the proprietors of the Pittsburg Ironworks, advent to London was hailed with a shriek from every financial presa, and the ghost of the col- lapsed Mercantile Bank haunted him everywhere. To escape the weariness of the situation, he hurriedly took flight from London and gave out that: he was bound for Australia' via America. Whatever may be the farts; of the Mercantile Bank disruption, it is clear that 'th√© depositors and shareholders are dissatisfied ,- with Sir Matthew-in truth, they are almost smothering themselves with anger, and it, will require con- siderable ability and coolness on the part of the cold water financier and knight to assuage the troubled breasts and fevered brains of many a ruined citizen of Melbourne. Sir George is happier than Sir Matthew.
