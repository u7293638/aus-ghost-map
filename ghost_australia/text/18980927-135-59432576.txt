GLENGARRY. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) September 26. The milk supply at the creamery is still increasing, and since my last report has reached I oo gallons per day, while the output of butter is about 25 cwt. per week. Mr Drane holds pride of place as largest supplier at present. The refrigerator is now almost ready for use, and will be found a great benefit during the hot weather. Last Tuesday a bullock " gave up the ghost" on the roadside near \Vent worth's late residence, and the carcase remained there, much to the annoyance and danger of those riding or driving past. The day following Mr Webb, a machine canvasser, chanced to pass in his buggy, but the horse, true to its instinct, took fright at 'the "coo," result-buggy overturned and the axle broken. Since then the carcase has been " cremated "-or supposed to have been-but whoever performed the operation was an amateur at the game, for on Saturday afternoon a quantity of the carcase remained, and unless it is promptly reduced to ashes will soon create a nuisance. The last day or two has been nice spring weather, and as Mr Snake has a great hking for the sun, it is not at all surprising to hear of several fair sized ones being killed.
