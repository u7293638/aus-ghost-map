THE LATE POPE. ' ' Iv Rceordfta"o with the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church, the services known as the Month's Mind were celebrated at St Mary's pro-Cathedral on Monday evening and Tuesday, for the repose of of the soul of his late Holiness Pope Pius IX The services in themselves were not lessen LITTLE different from those observed on the day when the first Be plies Mass was celebrated On Monday evening the solemn Dirge was sung and yesterday morning at 11, Requiem High Mass was celebrated His Grace the Archbishop of Sydney was present, as were also the Bishops of Goulburn Maitland, and B itburst, the last named Prelate, Dr Quin, being celebrant, and having as his deacon and subdeacon the Rev Fathers Kearney and J Collins The press attendant on the Archbishop's throne were the Rev P J Mahony, PM re Garav c, and 1' Carroll The clergy present, exclusive of the Bishops' chaplains, numbered between fifty and sixty, ivory d case except that of Armidale being represented There was a large attendance of the laity, though the building was scarcely FO largely filled as might have been expected on such an occasion At the conclusion of the mass, the Very Rev. Dean M C ii The delivered the following address - to gain any thing like a proper concept on of the position held and maintained with so much dignity, power and effect by Pins I , we ought to endeavour to conceive some idea of his relations to the Church to temporal Kings, and to civilization The due understanding of these relations will enable us to see his duties, his right-", his difficulties, his failures and his successes will unravel the seeming mystery of his e evasion, of the attachment of millions to his person and ofTc and of the dread entertained by millions of some viol dorful power supposed to be possessed by him, and which is to them perfectly unaccountable He was the head < i an organization extending to all clunes embracing p i pics of all nations of every tongue, and every tube-stretching back during eighteen centuries and more, witnessing the rise and fall of m ghty empires presenting to the world the noblest characters that have filled the most 1 Zions parts of the h story of statesmanship, of literature ofnrU,nud asceticism connected with and loading every movement that tended to lift man from the depths of defendant n to the level of true liberty that sought to call man from the darkness of ignorance to the marvellous light of the desperate deliver him from the enslavement of passion to the government of reason, enlightened and Du did by the truths of Christian life When in June 1919, he became the su cessor of blessed Peter, his relationship with this organisation became more intimate , every member of it became of necessity an object of his solitude, whether they lived in Siberia, or in the scattered F-O kinds of Poly are as in Europe or America many elms met Asia, Africa or Australasia, it mattered not whether they were following the simple pursuits of the shepherd, the fisherman, the agr culturist whether they were fis mated with the sweets of literature, and the beauties of art whether exploring the depths of the heavens above and the earth beneath hellier studying the mysteries of God's revelation or revealed word, or humbly teaching its simple precepts-whether leading lives of the most rigid asceticism, and explaining its laws, or scandalising by the laxity of their morals, their fellow-man, it mattered net-all formed the mystic body of which he became unto the mystic head, all were the children of whom he became the du inch appointed guardian and Catherall constituted the bride to whom he was espoused by a heavenly and indissoluble bond of attention, affection, and protection When from the summit of his elevation be fixed his gaze on too far and wide extent of this organization, now united and endeared to him by the tenderest ties and the most chastened love, he clearly observed its mutual wants and spiritual influence, its spiritual shortcomings and ardent bearings its diversified pur ruts and conditions its simple minds meekly following lives of unobtrusive piety and some of its mighty minds energising with seven h a trying, and p replied with doubts about seemingly clashing merits, and the minds and hearts of all And then the hearts and minds turned towards him, as their father, their guide, for light, protection, and consolation He must have felt the full force of his relation to the Church, and well understood the full application of his Masters words "Thou art Peter, and on this rock; I will build my Church have and do thou, once convened confirm the brethren,nndfcol my lambs, feed my sheep " Whosoever has dwelt upon the meaning of those words of our Saviour, must acknowledge the clo est relationship between the Pope and the Church, and from this relationship to wards the Church follow his relations towards temporary rulers and our d17 ition Some of the temporal i rulers are his own children and allot them have some of his children subject to them. The welf ire of his Child en is largely dependent on the prudence, the impartiality, and justice of the Sovereign and r whom they live in the enactment and administration of contable laws where they reside If his spiritual subjects were confined to one territory, he and the temporal rulers of that territory would have a joint interest in advancing the happiness of their joint s objects, and for the same reason has he, with all the Sovereigns a joint interest in promoting the well-being of all nations, because in all nations has spiritual subjects dwelt If the Sovereign Tontiffanlnil earthly powers are unitedly bound to consult and provide for the peace and p'-ssjicnty-each in their own sphere of their respective and joint subjects it is evident that relationship of cordiality and mutual cooperation should subsist between them His relationship to cry station wall, to the least reflecting mind, be most unquestionable, and most intimate For what is civilisation ? It is the knowledge, the nclnovvhlgmcnt, the appreciation, and observance of the rights of God and man-the suppression of evil ten- dencies the subduing of our vicious passions, the cultiva- tion and development of our v virtuous incline on, the perfecting of our own noble qualities tho studying mutual forbearance and respectable making proper u off all the resources furnished by our Ci water, to enable us to effectively and agreeably discharge all our personal and see it dunes, and legitimately remove all our personal and FO ml ndv intake The position of the Sovereign Pontiff has the closest connection with such a civilization, which alone is worthy of the name, for it is his privilege to publish everywhere the rights of God and man-to inculcate everywhere that moral code, given by God to man, to show mon to himself, and help him to know his dangerous as well as ennobling properties, and guide him in removing a haley cr is base, gres Â¡m 1 irregular, and refining what is good, and noble, until the creature become the restored image of the All- poifect Original, according to what he was first made Pius IX thoroughly know all his relations towards the Church, temporal rulers, and civilization, perfectly understood the obligations these relations imposed on him, heartily embraced his duties and cheerfully and completely performed them He brought to the Pontifical Throne nor the personal qualities its eleva- tion and its sanctities required Trained from his childhood in the knowledge, fear, and love of God, and for years training many in the way they should walk, his heart was disciplined according to the rules of unassuming asceticism, and his mind illumined with the bright truths of revelation He apportioned his time, and arranged his various duties, that he may advance his own sanctity, without interfering with his attention to the interests of millions, his intercourse with he then secured him light, strength, and tranquillity, and his. intercourse o with men revealed his benignity and universal charity His communications with heaven, gave him humility without the least alloy of dissimulation , cheerfulness, without the least admixture of dissipation, imparted to him the spirit of mourning without dejection, gravity without the least acerbity, aspires playfulness without the leastinibccoiu lUsness, truthfulness without the least duplicity, fear without the least dejection, hope unattended with presump- tion, the spirit of fraternal cor rectum, unaccompanied with indignation the spirit of edification unstained by pride, the spirit of universal of affection unadulterated by the least selfishness, and the spirit of persevering patience undisturbed by the least repining, and his communications to and with men elicited from friend and foe a willing testimony to the purity of his heart, the uprightness of his intention, and his constant year In promoting his Divine Master's cause Let the honorable Pontiffs, in whose presence I now presume to speak, who have so often seen and conversed with him say whether I exaggerate in summarising the qualities of Pius the 11th. But as acts more forcibly than descriptive words tell a man's character I will beg your attention to a few of his acts of world-wide notoriety He began his reign by proclaiming a general amnesty for all the political offences against the State's opened the prison gates, and let the prisoners see he recalled those who had left the country, and he required of them only a sample declaration that on their word of honour they would not abuse the Sovereign clemency, and would for the future notes loyal subjects Their gi attitude appeared to be unbounded-their " viv as " resounded through the streets of Rome, and very many even swore by their heads and the heads of their children, to be faithful to death to Pius IX to shed their blood for him, and renounce their share of paradox if ever they betrayed the oath of honour which bound them to the Pontificate He commenced the work of political reform, and was proceeding in making his State a model for continental imitation, until the hand of the assassin stayed his proceedings, and the men whom he had restored to liberty forgot their honour their gratitude, their self-imposed oath, and forced him to by the city of Rome However, he replaced not, he knew he followed the generous impulses of a father R heart, and if his children abused his affection and generosity, they made him suffer less than his Sovereign and Lord Jesus Christ endured when he heard the hosannas of one day soon changed into the language that betokened his approaching crucifixion-"Ciucify him' ci used by him " Let the records of the pets of Pius IX as a temporal ruler be investigated, and they must declare "that as far as circumstances permitted he governed his States with the affection, therefor dence, and wisdom of a father But the difficulties with which he was surrounded did not in the least slack on his year, or appear to impede his efforts in furthering the interests of the Church Old England arrests his attention, the accumulated prejudices of three hundred a ears are being thinned and dissipated the Catholic truth is embraced and professed by many of the noblest minds of the land, the small congregations of former years increased to more and larger assemblages, and still the numbers were coming on and increasing more and more The government of the Church then was in an abnormal state, the bishops had their titles from Papal lands, and were recalled at the mere caprice of the Propaganda They had not canonical stability, Andelosia, on their own authority, undertake nothing of national importance or grandeur He saw the time was come for placing the Church of England in a normal state He re-created its hierarchy, established now centres of light, life, and vigour, whence has resulted that admirable progress noticeable in the Church there during the last twenty-seven years "Young America engages hisitttoiittun and he assembles its learned, experienced, and saintly pi relates to aid each other by mutual counsel, to devise the best measures to meet the wants of the new world-to make known to him their necessities, their suggestions, their recommendations, and to receive his directions and blessings The prelates are regulated, then number is increased their resources f r road are multiplied a hundredfold Far distant Australia is near his heart, and under the ken of his eye He looks on its Eastern division, and he beholds one probate of iron constitution and indomitable energy labouring with the real of an Apostle-it one time in the semi-tropical regions in the north, at another in the cold regions of the south, everywhere endeavouring to attend to the needs cities, and satisfy the piety of his scattered Rock, He fees Ins M work is more than one man can perform, and he ponds to his relief those prelates of whose name you now see before you, and whose presence forbids me the expression of well dozened eulogy and only allows me to say, cast your eyes over the vast region that stretch from Cooktown in the north to Deniliquin in the south behold the churches, the convent the schools, the colleges, the zealous pride to, the attentive and faithful congre "nations and you must exclaim, "Pius IX loved us in enlarging our hierarchy, and in sending such devoted, generous, and self-sacrificing trollies " The same may be raid of the southern an 1 western divisions of this fair Australian land Koompartoo the world engaged and received his attention It is not given to me to know all he has done for each part of the Church-the rush ips, the administrators, the heads of religious houses collectively can tell how much tin 1 how dear to him were the interests confided to their charge, how solicitous he was that they should guard their interests as the interests of our Divine Lord In some countries his directions were received without demur or opposition, in some he was obliged to enter into concordat with the Princes of the land, in some he was compelled toiobuko Princes, and sustain his people, priests and bishops against the unprovoked hostilities of the temporal rulers Towards all he acted the father, the son reign pontiff But though the special interests of every portion of the Church enraged his attention he found time to define and proclaim truths of universal importance These truths were written by the finger of God in the heavens of revelations Pius clearly saw them, distinctly read them, vans filled with admiration at them and he determined to make them known to the world He fired li!-, gaze on the heavens of revolu- thousand he saw a woman clothed with the sun of justice the moon of human frailty beneath her feet and a crown of the stars of the brightest virtues surrounding her he saw the heel crushing, the serpent g held-he saw her represented under types and figures there were exceptions to all the law a of nature he heard prophets describing her exceptional perfection he heard angels alting her as the blessed one among women he saw, and bend much more, and he invited the prelates of the whole Church to fix their gaze on this beautiful object, and declare whether they thought with him And they did desire, and their interpretation accorded with his, and he proclaimed to the whole Church, and the whole world, that Mary, the mother of our Saviour through the merits of her own Divine Son, was immaculate in her very conception, and, as a consequence, he, and with him the whole Church, can say that no material t pes, no earthly 1 language cm picture or describe the excellence of the one whom and others chose, to be the mother of His Son whom the Holy Ghost chose to be His spouse and whom the Son chose to be the mother of nil His disciple The world, indeed, will not under find the heir ng of this grand wonder, but even child of the Church has exulted, and will exult in a truth that is excites the mother of God that ushers in the new dispensation, and makes the second Evo worthy cooperating with the SeCond

Church, and entitle him to the gratitude of the world at large the world know how to appreciate the gifts of heaven But those are but two out of many Lie a watchman on the towers of Israel, he observed the movements of the enemy-he saw the snares, the sures they were lying for the ruin of Church and State, gave the alarm as they came under his ob exertion, and in his own memorial " Encv cheal letter" of the 5th December, 1864, he pointed out eighty of them, set over them his caution and anathema, and thus warned mankind against their ruinous tendencies and nature 4.11 his a is, in

How then was he, who deserved so well of King's and peoples despoiled of his States, stripped of his temporal power, and obliged to live for the last seven years of his 11 fo in a prison in the A Vatican ' I may answer lion as it His Divine Master, who went about doing good, marking every footstep by some miracle, heal ing all sorts of diseases, giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, strength to the lame, life to the dead, breathing the purest, and holiest, and most ennobling octane-vi as despoiled by the very people whom he most favoured of his liberty, his garments, and his life I will not ennor, indeed-dive into the mysterious depths of God's dealings with His servants and His Church but I may be permitted to glean something from their surface. I may presume to say that God permitted the spohntions, the humiliations of Pins, to exhibit the Church to the world-Ins extraordinary virtues of resignation, fortitude meekness, constancy, and charity, to demonstrate to all that the Sovereign Pontiff in poverty and destitution, is dearer, if possible, to millions of his children scattered over the world that was in the midst of the triumphant splendour of the temporal power or and to prove to mankind that the vitality of the Church is founded, not on temporal power but on the eternal, the irreversible promises of heaven The impiety of infidels and faithless children may take away what the enlightened piety of loyal and faithful children give Triumphant injustice may forces hold po season of the Eternal City, though consecrated by the blood of thousands of martyrs Crown-st sacrilege may even proceed to more irreligious deeds than any yet perpetrated, md the and he matised logic of ' accomplished facts may be wider for a time the minds of the honest and seem to gratify the doings of the dishonest But Europe will yet recover from the definition falsehood and vilhnies-tho dark clouds that hang about Home will he disper ed-and the ephemeral power created by infidelity, brute force, and sacrilege Full dipped and long the Sovereign Pont ff to walk once more the streets of Rome to repair the ravages made by his foes audcceroiso his spiritual power with liberty untrammelled by delusive guarantees But one thing they cannot take from him the treiNiuo of a stainless reputation, the treasure of a stainless character, the well-earned reputation of unflinching adherence to principle and duty, the tribute of universal admiration and affection, and the conviction of millions that he has fought the good fight, that he has finished his course gloriously, that he has kept the faith and illustrated it, that he has gone to his rest surrounded with a halo, of merit, and his crown of bliss is for him perfectly secure
