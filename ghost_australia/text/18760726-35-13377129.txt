MUSICAL SOCIETIES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD). Sir-At rather strange that anonymous c respondents make nee of the Flats to call the attention of the public to the utter absence of musical societies in Sydney while two musical societies have just been called into life and are appealing of public support No concerts have as yet been given but sufficient public advancements have been made to give notice to all who take an interest in such matters Still, "Handel s Ghost' and others ignore those sometimes existence entirely and studiously The lamented tied sounds rather like a bit of opposition, not straightforward but after the fashion of ghosts in the dark Since Herr Schmitt b departed from this colony, no greater concerts have been performed, nobody stirred, nobody abused the public for not supporting music, nobody came forward to do anything At the beginning of this year several lovers of music discussed quietly and privately the state of affairs-- Most of them were acquainted with the former societies, knew their successes, then faults and failures, and the causes thereof, and at last resolved-try again. The Sydney Musical Union was formed at a public meeting, and near li at the same time another society,- the Sycint) Choral Union started into life It is satisfactory to know that the former has found favour with a great portion of the public, that the subscribers list c assume a respectable number of nairn 8 and I fancy that the latter has also a fair sh 10 of support Both can well exist too hot, for The latter a cording to its programme desires amateurs only while the Sydney Musical bin a asks a broader base, solicits the assistance c f amateurs vocal and instrumental but wishes particularly) to draw together the professional musicians, and to engage then talent for public concerts in order both to support the profession and to present to the public the best performances possible But in trument' abets and vocalists are rare, and the number of trained choristers is very small The so called home Sol Fa system has sadly failed to spread fair knowledge of music, and, with Mr. Younger, I i consider it a tu le-fnnyled tion ii that has done more harm than good, although Mr. I Ã¼ber tells us that the method has been known for more than buO years Not one of the great composers of the last contained has availed himself of this method nevertheless its present friends declare it vastly superior to the common notation, which-as Mr T li i calls it in his letter, the old notation is I presume several thousand years old. The Tonic Sol system has been introduced into all our public schools, some a number of years, many teachers were tormented into acquiring a knowledge of the system, and many thousands have enjoyed (?) the instruction Where are the choral singers trained by that system ? I, for one, thought, seeing the splendid chance given to the supporters and teachers of the new fangled notion, that a gigantic choral society would once in a few years, that delighted pupils would rally round their beloved instructor, and astonish the world with their musical abilities Baitituunl month,' We have a few juvenile concerts, where some little songs were sung by memory, and by memory only More than one half of the performers were not provided with music, and the rest did obviously not require it, although they held it in their hands They weiodnlled-and really well drilled-to sing by heart if the system does work a musical revolution in Great Britain, and turns out 100 efficient choristers every ten named by other means it has certainly not done so in Sydney The new societies cannot find the trail of choristers, and it will require time and labour to prepare concerts But in the face of these difficulties two musical societies have established themselves and vom course! ondents so sadly lamenting may avail theirs was of bills, and give them the benefit of counsel and talent Time will show whether these will succeed wh have put their shoulders to the wheel, or whether they will be impeded, and perhaps even stopped, by those who stand by whining about the indifferent public, abuse is under State amateur soloists, lamenting their dearly paid colonial experience., and gnashing their teeth because others dare to undertake what they themselves had, perhaps, the de no, but not the ability of doing. I remain, c, CHARLES HORN.
