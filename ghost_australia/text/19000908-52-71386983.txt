AB Ideal War Correspondent. I The London "Dally News," In speaking; of the I late Archibald Forbes, -whom it regards as "the I Ideal war correspondent," and of whom it says ? that "he could write with the speed of a whirl wind," tells the following story to illustrate his cleverness in getting his news reports in ahead of his fellow-correspodents: "Here is a little scene. Time, near midnight, after a hard day's work; everybody done up. 'Hullo, Jones,' says Smith, 'there's Forbes al ready asleep, like brass.' 'By Jove, yes,' quoth Jones (incipient snore from Forbes) ; 'lt would take ten horses to wake him up. I'll turn in,' says Jones; 'time enough to get our stuff off to-morrow, eh?* 'Right you are,' responds Smith. In ten minutes the wearied warrior-scribes are dead asleep. Forbes rises cautiously, passing out like a ghost; sits him down in a hidden corner with the stump of a tallow-candle ; writes like a whirlwind for a couple of hours; finishes with the last flicker of his dip; saddles a horse; off he goes, helter-skelter, across country; gallops for an hour; delivers his letter; gallops back; is in bed by 4; sleeps, this time, Mike brass,' and no mistake. 'Hullo, lazy-bones,' exclaims Smith at 7 a.m., shaking the deeper. 'Time to be up,. old man,' adds Jones. 'What are you up to?' quoth Forbes, drowsily. 'We are thinking of getting our stuff off.' 'The devil you are. Why hurry? Let's have another snooze.* At last, Smith and Jones get their stuf* off; and in three days discover to their bepuzzlement that they were twenty-four hours behindhand. Very provoking to Smith and Jones. But if Forbes had been the victim of the little ruse, he would have been the first to laugh over If, and to con gratulate his successful competitor."
