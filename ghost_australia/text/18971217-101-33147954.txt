SHOULD A MAN PROPOSE BEFORE HE HAS PROSPECTS ? A mab. is of ten in .serious perplexity about a proposal. He loves a girl, and he longs to tell her 60, and secure her for his own ; and yet he knows quite well he is not in a position to face papa upon a ques- tion of settlements, and so he halts between two opinions, tormented with doubt. > If-he has absolutely no prospects what- ever, there certainly seems little > good in proposing marriage. It would be better to beep silence altogether, > were it not for a way men have of being unable to help showing their love > for a girl, and haunting her society, even when they are aware their- > prospects are hopeless. To show a ghi you love her, and to haunt her foot- > steps is, mostly, to make her care for you in return; at all events, there > is the danger of doing so. That being the case, a man is bound in honour to speak, He cannot win a girl's love by showing her his, and then ride away and say nothing more. He must tell her how matters stand. If he has the ghost of a prospect, he must ask her whether she thinks it sufficient to wait for ; but he should make it plain that he cannot consider himself . ill-used if she thinks the waiting too long and too in- definite. If there is no prospect at all, he cannot ask for any promise. But he can tell her how happy it would have made him to have her for his wife had fate been kinder. That will at least prevent her eating her heart out in the mortification of fancying she had given her love to him without being asked for it-a mortification greater ] to a woman than a man can have the | least idea of. Without definite prospects, no man has any right to blind a girl by an , engagement.
