Through the long, long year, With the clouds Tor a frown, and the rain for a tear; Where the air is free, and all blue the slty: Not a breeze below—not a cloud on high. And the sun lieams forth with bis rays unshorn, •From the first red break of the balmy morn, To the spot where the shades of evo are born. And flowers and fruits in their unforced birth Arise from the lap of the bright green earth: But here, the whole ground's but one big bog— The sky's like dirt, and the air's all fog, . And it seems wherever I turn to fly. That an easterly wind rungjnto my eye; And when death shall hare taken me far away, These lines shall my craven tomb-stone show— " Here in quiet doth lie a poor devil below, Who died of an English day."
