Meadow Sweet In Summer fields the meadow swpf.t. Spreads its white bloom around the feet .Of those who pass in love or play The golden hours of holiday, And heart to answering heart can beat • * Where grows the simple meadowsweet.. Kmbosomed in some, cool retreat Tbc long seed grasses bend to meet Tbc stream-that.murmurs as it flows Songsof forget me not and rose; The filmy haze of noon tide heat Is faint'with scenes of meadow sweet. Ah, love I do you know meadowsweet? Does some pale ghost of passion fleet Adown this dreary lapse of roars,, So void of love, so fuU of fears ? Some aucient. far off echo greet The once loved name of meadow sweet ? An Ingenious Swindle*.—A swindle' recently detected is conducted as follows-: A eheque, say for teu guineas, is obtained from & depositor at a bank, and a blank cheque exactly like the filled-in chcqnc is seen ml. The two cheques are laid one upon the other 60 that the edges arc exactly even. l»otb chcques are"then torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the filled eheque appears on one picccand the amount aud name of the payee on the other. The chequcs having be&n; held together while being torn, of course one plccc of the Wank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of tbe filled cheque. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blank cheque with ihe name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say one-thousand pounds, takes it with -the piece of genuine cheque containing ihe signature of the bank, and explain?. that ihe cheque was. accidentally torn. TJ»o ielJcr can put the pieces together, .abd as thcr Jit esactlv, the chances are-tbnt be will think the pieces arc parts of the same cheque, and become a victim lo the swindle. 7 lie tuck, of course, .suggests its own remedy. Tee teller should refuse to pay nny cheque thai is mutilated. • ..
