A Thirsty Corpse. A certified corpse was being taken by two porters to the Morgue, in Paris, on a stretcher, when it suddenly alarmed its carriers by sitting up and asking for a drink. It was a worthy female who, having got out of a train at tho Mont.parnasse Station, fell down on the platform and apparently gave up the ghost. A reputed doctor who was near said that tho woman's heart and pulse had ceased to beat, so sho was accordingly sent, by a stretcher,- to the unlovely establishment in mid Seine, whete the dead bodies of city castaways are kept for dissection and burial. The woman awoke on tho Place do Parvis do Notre Dame, and instead of taking her to tho direful destination for which she had been intended, her kind carriers marched her into the adjacent hospital — the Hotel Diou — where she was installed temporar ily in a warm ward, and received refreshments. She had been over fatigued by a railway journey from Brest, and the cold had brought on an attack of congestion of the brain.
