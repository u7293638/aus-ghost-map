Alone with Conscience. j sat alone with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, ; And we talked of my former living : In the land where the years increasod ; ?And Ifelt I should have to answer . Tho questions it put to me. And to face the answer and question ' ?.' Throughout an eternity. ' ? The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, 'And things that I thought where dead things. Were alivo with a terrible might; ' And thevision of all iny past life ,, Was an awful thing to face, ; Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning;, Of a sorrow that was to ho mine ; ? . In a land that then was the future And now is the present time ; And I thought of my former thinking. Of the judgment day to he ; ' But sitting alone with iny conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To the land beyond the grave, Bnt no one gave me an answer * And no one can come to save ; Then I felt that the future was present And the present would never go by, 'Fori^'was but the thought of iny past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, Aud I knew that the far- away warning Was a warning oE yesterday ; And I pray that I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry out in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson Which I, ought to havo known before, And which, though I learnt it ureainiug, I hope to forjret no more. So I sit alone with my conscience, In the place where the years increase, And I try to think of the future, In the land where time will cease; And I know of tho future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it he, ' That to sit ulono with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me. â€” Spectator.
