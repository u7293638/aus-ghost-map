COROWA. [FROM OUB COEEESPOlfBEKT.] Everything here has been very quiet this last week. The river is at a stand- still, and the Corowa 6teamer is still lying at tbe bank, unable to move. The second edition of the " Varieties" came off on Saturday evening at the Atheneeum. There was a large attendance, the room being full. Mrs. Neil and Mr. Daniels sang an operatic piece with exceedingly good taste. Mrs. Bains also favored us with two Scotch songs. Mr. O. Whitehead, blaokened up to tho eyes, came out with a burlesque on the " Mabel Walti," which created a great amount of amusement. Messrs. Martin and Whitehead also gave us two or three nigger arrangements in character, which the audience seemed fully to appreciate. Commodore Pierce's "Ghost" next appeared, on tbe table, or rather under it, and danced all kinds of jigs, &c.;, much to the amusement of the juvenile portion of tbe community. There was a railway meeting held at Wahgunyali on Tuesday, but, aB it was a private arrangement, I cannot give you any particulars.
