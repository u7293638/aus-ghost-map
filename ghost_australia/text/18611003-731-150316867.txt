To the Editor of the Chronicle. Sra,â€” Tour readers will no doubt like to hear a word from one of themselves while sojourning in this plane. Everything here is at present very dull, and unless some drays soon arrive from Maryborough, I, us well as other visitors, will have to make the best of our way to where there is plenty to eat and drink. There is not a pound of flour to be had in Gayndah. The only thing we hear talked about is the Governor's expected visit, which I understand is put off for another week ; but I am perfectly astonished to find how unpopular the Police Magistrate is here. I have not heard a single pne say 4 word iu Ms favour. He surely cannot last bere long. The 6quatters now seem to be ashamed to be seen talking to him in the street. He has again summoned White for libel. What a farcu ! He imagines himself Inspector-General of Mails aud the head of the leg^l profession in Queensland. I haye been disappointed at there having been no public meeting nor other publip demonstration since my arrival here, but the Jopkey Clqb meets tprdsy' to settle important business. Oh, by-the^bye, the ''Ghost of Ban Bau' is believed to have bis habitation, not at Ban Ban nor Gayndah, but in the vicinity of Degilbo. Iam, Tours, & c., GAYNDAH VISITOR. Gayndah, 30th September, 1861. .
