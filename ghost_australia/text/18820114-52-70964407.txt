A Girl's Ideal. BY A. GK "And thon came tho ball ?" .} ' : " ,' " Yea, and' then came tho ball, two nights afterwards.. It was one of those big things that Lord Ciiostor gave every year or two, wlion ho invited everybody in the neighbourhood^ all his tenants and all tho Eastwold people-' tag, rag,, and bobtail,' TJnclo Joseph used to say j and somebody told him about us, and wo had -cards for it.''It was tho only timo we ever went to Dunchester j they ;novor 'asked UB to their other parties, of courso, and we woro not: on regular visiting torinB with them," explained Mary, naively. . i Mrs. Lepel smiled, and patted the ^girl's ? inno cent brown head» She was intensely amused and interested. ? j .. " Go on, lovo," she murmured. " Toll me all about that ball." ' ' i . " It was a bitter cold frosty night," said Mary, " and vory dark/ ' Wo and tho Morrises clubbed togothor for a fly, and tho Morrisos called for us at 8 o'clock, for it was rathor a long way .to go. Mostly I stayed at homo to koop houso when "."mo-' thor and Nina went out; it waB too expansive getting ovening dresses for all of us. But niother thought this was a spooial occasion, and that it would be a great treat for mo ; so she bought nie a now white muslin frock, and I. made myself some trimmings of ivy loaves-those nico, I shiny ivy loaves, you know, with tho light vouas , in thom.". / J , : j.';\/: " Yes, I know. And what did Nina wear P'f >,,., . " Oh, Nina looked lovoly. She. had her ¡dross made by the best dressmaker in Eastwold ; it (was . tho .finest, faintest bluo tarlotan, with a ¡white Bask to match, and palo pink roses about it; j and she had mother's pearl croas and earrings; , Sho looked beautiful." j ? «wen p" I;, nv. "So wo wrapped oursolvea up and sot off. j .And when wo roaohod Dunchostor-oh, how splendid it all was ! I never saw anything like it.j The entrance hall was as big as all our house'put together, and full of flowers and statuos and foot men, and a great carved stairoaso, with rows of lamps up both sides of it. I felt BO shy and nor vous about going in. But Dr. Morris had often boon there, and ho led the way ; and wo went, we ladies, into a charming dressing-room, where there was a big delicious fire, and arm chairs, and hot toa and coffoo ; and we got a good warm, and a lady's maid settled up our skirts, while he talked to some of his friends in the hall. Thon wo went into tho ball-room, Dr. and Mrs. Morris and mother first, then Miss Morris and Nina, and thon mo." n 'Mary Beaton and Mary Seaton, and Mary Carmichael and mo/ " murmured Mra. Lepel. " I don't think I over was really conacious until then how enormously big I was," tho girl went on. " I toworod over Miss Morris and Nina, and, walking- all by myself, I folt so conspicuous, and so hob and so awkward, my faco was tho colour of a peony, I do believe" i " Child, you would look beautiful, with . that colour in your face." ' ,i !. . " Oh, Mrs. Lopol !" ¡.'..i..'ii j-' " And I hope you had your neck and arms, un-: covorod ?" ' ' » :s.i'i j '"'.'' "No, I hadn't.

And I. don't wonder at Captain Armstrong. Did ho aeo you when you wont in P" j M- ? ?? "Not just at first. There- was a greaticrowd about tho doorway. Lady Chester Bhook ¡hands with ÜB, and Lord Chester gavo mother his arm, and found her a seat. Nina got a partner directly. Somo of tho Eastwold men had askod hor before hand. ' And I caught sight of Mrs. Clarke, our .'-curate's'wife-, who sat in a quiet corner, and I sat down with her, while mother walked about the room a little and talked to pooplo. I did not ( expect to, dance much, for I hardly ever went out, you know, and I know so very few people thor0 ; but Hiked to sit and watch the others dancing it was very pleasant and amusing, and I had Mrs. Clarke to talk to. However, presently I began to long, to be dancing, too. There was a splondid band playing-that kind of clanging, swelling ; music,' beating timo with such beautiful precision, that makos you throb and tingle all over ; and I could hardly boar it-I felt as if it wore impos sible for mo to sit still. They wore having a waltz, and I watched them-it soemcd.BO delicious. I had nover Avaltzed myself-not to speak of, you know-oxcept with Nina at homo, to keep her in practice ; but I saw tho stop in a moment, and I felt that, if only somoono would give ino a chance 11 could do it so well. And, amongst the couples that went flying and swimming past us, I saw Captain Armstrong and Lady Craven (Lady Cra vón was Lord Chester's sister), and I said to my """solf ' that, of all men in the room, I would like bpst to dance with him. Nono of thom danced, Znone of them looked and moved like him. Lt was , tho very last thing I ever expected, though." Well?" !.;?'""?'?/? " Well, when the waltz was over, to niy sur , , priso, ;Mr. Grcvillo came up and askod ino if I 7? wore engaged for tho next Lancers. Ho was tho ? i archdeacon's son, quite a young man, with spec tacles, an'undergraduate at Cambridge. Wo used ' to call him Verdant Green at Eastwold. He' was I" a shocking dancer, but I didn't caro for that. I was delighted to get him, and to be moving about with tho rest ; and for Lancers it did not matter. . So we stood up when our time came. I went off, .^feeling shy-I was wild to dance, I was very .'happy. And there in our set, vis-a-vis with me, . wasj Captain Armstrong; and when 1¡looked at him he was looking very hard at me-not rudely, ' 'riot boldly, but as if he liked to look at nie, some .'.'how. I had been feeling that I was very'plain and common place beside the other girls, and that ..iny chess was nothing to theirs; andyotsomotliing \- ,in the way ho looked across at mo mado me. feel . ¡that I was all right, tho sort of feeling you know, 1 you have whon your clothos suit you.

I felt that ho was disappointed and thought I couldn't dance, and that made mo worse. I blundered horribly. And then he slackened and stopped, and asked me if I would mind sitting out the rest of it with him, because his head ached. He had had a fall from his horse iii India which had hurt his head ; it waB for that ho had boen invalided homo ; and he said his ¡doctora had ordered him not to dancé much. .So we .went away . to a refreshment lobby , and had some cup, and then ho, tookme tp^a long^gallory^ whore there was hardly: anyone ,<bútj ?ourselvosY and wo sat. down on ai Bôfa- ,in la" .«recess;'1 and talked." .m>;.hrHil timor ifiiw hm \ tM : "And what did yon talk ábout'^.'CfT ]'.'"{''?'}.
