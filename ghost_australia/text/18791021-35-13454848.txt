SCHOOL OF ARTS. Professor Pepper's entertainment, at the School of Arts, was witnessed last night by another very large audience. The Professor has added to his marvels one more marvellous than its predecessors, viz , :Fisher's Ghost," in which is given a most vivid representation of an incident said to have occurred near Penrith. He reads the story of Fisher's Ghost, told in "Teggs Magazine," a journal published in Sydney many years ago , the curtain rises and you see a fence, surrounded bv brushwood. The story is closely followed, and you then see a man named Weir appear. As Weir comes upon the stage, a shadowy something forms before him, and the apparition of Fisher is seen upon, the fence. Weir tries to grasp it, but his hands encounter nothing, and the ghost vanishes. Then it returns again, and Weir, marking the fence, departs to initiate the search which is said to have resulted in the discovery of the murdered body of the man whose apparition he saw, and the identification and discovery of the murderer.
