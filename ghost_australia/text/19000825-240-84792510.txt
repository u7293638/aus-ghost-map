CARE AND WORRY. You? ve v hcard of caro wnd worry-d:ari voitors, oay *'ay. VWho stoat abouc tu:tollor as Iamlet' ghost at p.ay. They ome aunt tarry with you, unbidden and unuokud, And llnunt their gaunt arms o'er you add weight to every tusk. They watch the rays of tsunhitne' and guard your open door, Lest sight auu hopo nmay uter end sing the songa of yore. Close frinoa are cr and worry, they laugh and dance with gico, And ple the luggots hlguer at each white look they see. They glory in the sbhadows their black eoson flig about, And wole toe croul is o'er you they laugh sand dance and shout, They over walk te oro you, for should they faL baeuind, T'a n tarus would vanish from you like mast botore Lut wund. BLt over on the other ide wait lore and hope and joy, Mother aPe wole and sister, and little B?b. your boy. The robun ings in the willow and the sikylark canta hus lay, And flowers haonsom about you from the morn tall close of day. Fling back at sorn and worry their black robeh of despair, And know ? the emro paus cwifvJly God?s hand hath rooted there. Smooth out te groat deep furrows oat wido on hrow and chook, For troublen ans m the vadey-yeu are fnaring the mountain peak.
