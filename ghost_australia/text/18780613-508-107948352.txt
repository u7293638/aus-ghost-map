The Pacific Mail Steamship Com pany having sold the steamer Great Bepublic to P.B.

The thin ghost of a fragile rumour that ..— nLnJn ah nnnrTiriM linirtlmrn YinA lilTltAri tH&t.llfi; might offer to buy from Goodall and Perkins the State of California, now beiDg built for them at Philadelphia, and Mr. Goodall having distinctly stated that the vessel is not for sale, and that a sum sufficient to buy her has never been offered them, is, of course, proof positive that she is going to be magnified into a ItUBeian three-decker and despoiT Victoria, Esquimault, and the coasts of Vancouver Island and British Columbia generally. Kow is the exciting period when every time a Pigeon Point potato schooner, or a Puget Sound lumber scow changes ownership, the reporter ?whose heart is in hie business, adds anotherto the fleet of Hussion privateers with which lie is coveringthe ocean. Tbe Great Bepublic is the newest of the Pacific Steamship side-wheelers, and -was purchased by Mr. Cornwall, who states that she will fly tbe American flag, and will not become a privateer.

The Philadelphia Chronicle of April 13th hue quite a sensation in regard to tbe Pacific Coast steamship Company's new Bteamer State of Cali fornia. It runs in this style :— ' The Messrs. Cramp say sne is for tbe Pacific trade, but knowing ones hint tbat when she gets to the Pacific she will hoist the Russian flag. One thing is certain, that British scents are watching aerrery closely end spies are upon her constancy. Some say she is for the Russian Government, while others claim that slio is to be a privateer in case of war between England and Bussia. Severs! persons who are known to have beon in the service of the Russian Government bare been seen in the vicinity.'
