new south "wales congrega tional union. The twenty-seventh annual session of the New South Wales Congregational Union was opened last evening, when the Rev. A. J. Griffith, of Croydon, preached the annua' sermon. He took for his subject the difhcul ties encountered by the Christian Church owing to the materialism and secularism pre vailiug. In confronting the difficulties which beset tlie Church tho secret of her sncce-sg would lie in the full recognition that the Holy Ghost dwelt in the Church and in the j individuals who composed the Church. There | were two elements which rendered the work 1 of the churches peculiarly difficult. He re ferred to the prevailing materialism and secularism, aud the absorption of men s minds in wordlyaiins and pursuits. It was notulto- gether remarkable, considering our surround ings, that in this land of the golden fieeco material objects should crowd out less worldly aims, but it was none the less re grettable. There was a tierce rush after wealth and pleasure, and au indifference to religious matters. Our spiritual enlighten ment was not in accord with our prosperity and educational advancement. it was a grave matter wheu a nation developed iu intelligence and retrograded in religious knowledge and faith. As a remedy, the scrupulous cultivation of personal pietv was one of the things most urgently needed, and they must also uphold the Church in her endeavor to impress the truth upon the world. One great want in our land was more Christian homes. The prevailing secularism must be met and fought in the Church's homes. Parents should impart religious in struction to their children. Home was the primary school for religious instruction. It was hardly conceivable that the Church could make great progress if the homes of the Church were comparatively destitute of familv worship. The choir of the Dulwich- hill church lead the service of praise. The Union meet for business to-day.
