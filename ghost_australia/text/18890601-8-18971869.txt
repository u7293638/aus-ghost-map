POETRY. BOOKS. Books are the garnered wisdom of the earth, Which else had perished in the fields of time; Storehouses they wherein all souls sublime Have treasured every thought of noble birth. Not all are wise; nor of the wise can most In deathless language shrine immortal thought; But great ideas never came to naught: Each Socrates has Plato for a ghost. Upon our shelves they lie, these priceless tomes, Silent and unobtrusive as a saint; But, opened, what are palaces with domes, Landscapes of glamour, music's mighty plaint, Compared with pages where the rapt eye roams, Pages whose glory makes the world grow faint.
