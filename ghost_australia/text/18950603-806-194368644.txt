The preacher first spoke-of the circumstances under which the Holy Ghost was* promised. Forty days after tbo resurrection the Lord was still .on earth and in the presence of .His disciples. Ail their doubts respecting His claims to the Messiab'sbip and- Bis resurrection bad vanished. Their faith and hope, which had died with Christ, bad revived;- and. their. loVe was rekindled and intensified. TbejrifaffilfeiSiy was regarding the'establishment of the'kingdom which they in company; with-many others looked for. .Though their hope bad been crushed with the death of. their Alasler, yet tbeiy, must rbavo been .raised, again at His/ resurrection, - and one of them asked“ Lord wilt thou notatthistimoreatoretho King idorp?" • Instead of answering, them in . thb; ■ way they expected, Christ promised 1 the Holy- Ghost, and soon after ascended ' into; the heavens from tbo midst of them.Then followed the time ofanxious waiting until the. day ;of Pentecost, when the promise was fulfilled. 'lt was well to bare as blear., views as possible about the Holy Ghost. Itwas 'not morely an, influence or a power, but a pivine person—; not .pno,, who • possesses a bodily fonri-f-hut a person ; In ' .(iho'-sehsb;, bf ,:onov baTiog <ppr6onßir..w|a'dprojV’pocsorial. knowledge and.ppjyer.
