LEGAL COMMISSIONS. 4 TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-I do not think it required a ghost to come from the grave, not even that of the late Attorney-General, to inform the public that Sir Joseph Innes never offered me a commission to prosecute prisoners. From the day he took office as Solicitor-General I was engaged prosecuting the Government to which he belonged, and never ceased until a verdict of guilty was pronounced against it and sentence of expulsion passed. From the leisure brought about by this verdict and sentence the late Attorney-General write you the letter headed as above. I do not know whether he quotes the Herald's report correctly, or whether that report was in itself correct, never having seen it. But r what I said in the Legislative Assembly on a late occasion was in substance this -" I was offered a commission to prosecute the other day, and refused it " -a thing I am always likely to do, seeing that at the Circuit Court to attend I receive, for defending a few prisoners, more than double the sum the Crown allows for prosecuting them all. No doubt the exit of Sir Joseph ones- from official life has left an enormous vacuum which be may well suppose remains void and desolate, but if a searching investigation of the position was entered upon it might actually be found that something like an attempt has been made to meet the dread emergency, and that it is just possible that the office of Attorney-General may now be, filled by a gentleman of pre-eminent ability, of distinguished position in his profession, and probably competent to know what he is doing in the little matter of granting commissions to prosecute. Your very obedient servant, DAVID BUCHANAN. Mudgee, April 17,
