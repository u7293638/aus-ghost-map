THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of a heart-ache . At the setting of the sun. ' ' The tender word forgotten, , The letter you did not write, 1 ?' The flower you might have sent, dear, . Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lighted Out of a brother's way, (The bit of heartsome counsel You have hurried too much to say, The loving touch of the hand, dear, . The gentje and winsome tone \- : That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. . ?; These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, . These chances to be angels Which even mortals find, ' ' ? .They come in night and silence, Bach chill, reproachful wraith, . When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. ? . For life is much too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. , And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heart-ache, . At the setting of the sun.
