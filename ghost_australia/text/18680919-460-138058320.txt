THURSDAY, SEPT. 10. Considering that the public were almost entirely the losers, over the Derby, the settling which took place at Tattersall's on Monday evening was thought satisfactory. There were one or two members behindhand with their payments, but which, we believe, a little time will square. One individual came in for more than his share of abuse from an indignant member of the ring, who was much incensed at the cool manner in which his debtor "collared" without possessing an adequate sense of the duty of " parting." The gentle men caught it rather " hot" over the Derby, but many recovered their losses by sticking to Mr. Lee's stable in the Innkeepers' 'Stakes and Bpsom Handicap. Betting on future events has consequently been anything but brisk, and speculation was chiefly confined to invest' ments in Calcutta sweeps, which were nightly drawn at Tattersairs, in which pur chases were generally made at a sha4e better odds than those obtained from the book makers. The Maiden Plate and Metropolitan absorbed the betting, as none of the other events were operated on, unless in the naming all the winners at 100 to 1. Ragpicker and Avalanche were made great pots of. by their several partisans. For the first, the former had a deal of money piled on her the beginning of the week at 8 and 4 to 1, and yesterday she became so hot that barely 2 to 1 could be had against her, Mr. Lee's filly being also well supported at a point more until the evening, when it waB intimated that she was a doubtful starter; she then became friendless, and BaTbelle jutaped into notice. Melancholy Jaques was out of favour, but a satisfactory gallop yesterday morning brought inquirers after him at 8 to 1. His owner was so satisfied with the performance that he looked upon the pocketing of the Maiden dollars as «» fait accompli. Nothing else was touched but the Rip and Regalia, on whom few investments were made at about 10 to 1 each. The Barb and Tim Whiffler held unlimited sway for the Metrop. all the week, Mr. Tait's horse having the call during the early part of it, but a most satis factory gallop on Tuesday morning brought Tim alongside of him, and in several cases Mr. De MeBtre's horses had a slight advantage for premiership. 2 to 1 was the rery most ihebook makers would venture against either of them, tbe shortness of the price bringing transactions to a very narrow limit. In certain quarters there has been a slight hankering after some of the outsiders, and BOO to 35 was laid on Monday In one "pop" against each of the following:-GHencoe, HamUeton Hill, Gul-' nare, Stumpy, Bylobg, Orlando, and Sir John, and 10 to 1 was taken pretty freely about Glencoe and Bylong yesterday. Double events were pencilled readily for the Maiden Plato and Metropolitan until the bookmakers were full with the favourites in each race at 100 $o 8, but here they stuck, as 100 to 4 to 100 to 2 against others proved aio inducement, to further business, Having now chronicled the State of affairs up to the night before the i-aces were again resumed at Randwick, we must#ow proceedto the business ofthe-day. ; 1 Tbe principal event in to-day's programme was tbe great Metropolitan Stakes, and ever' since tbe issuing of the handicap The Barb or jim Whiffler haB been spotted as being .the i most likely, winner, in . the feoa of the fact t)iat. no fjjeavy weight .has as yet Carried off this coveted prize. In 1865 the tear before the Metropolitan wals instituted, Volunteer 3st. and Tarragon 10st. 51b., had a ! desperate set-to for the Mayor's Cup, a handi i»p, two miles, won by the former by a .head, >qt those behind them were weighted muctj.. jnore heavily, than those below the two cracks on this occasion. In 1866, Bylong as a thine* yeariold/1)st.J 61b., defeated Yattendon, 9at. 01b., Tim Whiffler, 7st. 41b., third; and last > ? ear TimWhiffler, 8st* 81b., beat a large field :asHy in tbe shortest time accomplished for two niiea in the colonies, Smin. 88seo. | Yattendon, )st. 101b., getting fourthplace only.

Thedaywasbeautiful, and he aitendanoe kras more nunierOus than on the Derby tiayv thero could not have been fewer han from 6,000 to 7,000 people,present. .All.' h'ree stand swere quite full.

All now retired to . luncheon, someto partake of Mr. O'Brien's very recherchg fare below the stand, and some to keep the ladies company in their carriages at the opposite side of the rails. Thismoit.neoesiarypartof theper formance over, we had a look at the maidens Who were at their toilets in the paddook. Marksman struck us as being one of -the finest three-year-olds we ever put out eye brer. JaqueB was as melancholy-looking with fat as he appeared on Saturday. Barbelle must have caught gruel in the Derby, for she Wa8 more tucked up than usual. Begalia Was a neat cheBnut filly, but there was too little -of her. TheBip looked big and hearty jand we thought Ragpicker walked out of the paddobk rather eore like, but the stiffness went off in her pre liminary. Marksman cantered all over like a winner, and Jaqiies like a cat on hot bricks. As a lot they were a very respectable, field of maidens, and Kaizer looked at one time as. if be Was going to redeem his character, but Davis rpde Bagpicker like a general. Seeing Barbelle at her old game with Marksman,. Prince, and Kaizer,he took a pull .at the Leger corner, gave her her bead half way down the straight, and she Bhot out like an arrow and won a fast riin race with great ease by several lengths, and landed a good stake for the stable. 3T6 time was losi;, and the bell rang at Once to prepare for the race-the Metropolitan $tokes. The Barb and Tim Whiffler both stripped in great form^ and quite a host of friends surrounded them as they were being saddled. Bylong, too, looked something like bis former self. Hambleton Hill was grand, And his coat sbone like a mirror. Oulnare, Sit John, Orlando, and Glencoe were as fit .as man could make them. The Barb and Tim were received when they emerged from the paddock with prolonged cheering, and all went well in their canters but The Barb, as Aehworth had to lift him along in a very atilty manner. The race itself was a great affair; there was no tailing, all kept well to gether until the pinch came between the two cracks. Gulnare looked very dangerous to within a quarter of a mile from home, when Tim Whiffler gave her the go-by, with The Barb in CIOBB .pursuit; Tim was collared and brought to the whip opposite the St. Lsger stand, and Aehworth landed the black demon withoutaneffortthe winner by balfalengthamid much cheering; Bylong was threelengths behind, third. Eight went out to measure strides for the last race, the Squatters' Stakes, and Mr. Lee's filly Avalanche expressly reserved for this event, was made a hot favourite. This filly is very handsome, and appeared to us to be by far the best looking of Mr. Lee's lot; she put us much in mind of Zoe in her younger dayB} but Mr. Baldwin's little Begalia, veiy patiently ridden by Brown, bowled her over; it was a narrow squeak, for bad the winning ^ost been ten yards further off, the verdict of Mr. Lackey would have been reversed. To clay's racing was a great blow to the ring, as nearly all the bookmakers were heavy losers over Bagpicker for the Maiden Plate and The Barb for the Metropolitan; the double event was picked in every instance, and the " skin ner" which they had in the Derby has been far more than counterbalanced by the result of these two noes.

At the rocks Tim Whiffler ran into second place, Glencoe, Orlando, and Guinare at his heels. Here Casino shot her bolt, and Orlando went to the I front. At the back Guinare took the lead, and The Barb ran into third position, Tim Whiffler in front of him. Guinare kept a good lead to the Derby corner and " Guinare wins" was shouted from the stand; here Tim Whiffler closed on her, after entering the straight; then The Barb passed Mr. Lee's mare, caught Tim half way up the distance, j and without ever being called upon, beat him on the post by half a length, amidst great ex citement and cheering.

Fawn's unwillingness to start caused Bome delay at the post. Coroebus was first oflj but gave way to Regalia, who passed the .rocks . first, with Stumpy and Fawn in immediate attendance, Avalanche close op. At the back Begalia retired in favour of Stumpy and Fawn, and they ran thus into the straight, all close together. Begalia came again, and led to half way up the distance, when the favourite made ber eflort, passed Stumpy and Fawn, and was just defeated' by a neck; Sailor Boy, in close pursuit, got third place. . Time, 2min. 19aec. Fbidat, SEPT. 11. There was a very foil attendance at Tatter sail's overnight, bnt little speculation took place on the events of to-day, owing to the un certainty of several favourites starting. Sweeps were drawn on the Sydney Handicap, Mares' Produce Stakes and .Craven Plate. Bylong, Hambleton Hill, and Golnare, fetched the highest prices for tbe handicap; Marksman, Coquette, and Barbelle, for the Produce Stakes, and Tim Whiffler and The Barb for the Oravfen Plate, although Mr. Tait am pounced that his hdree was a doubtful starter. A good deal of betting took place as to the Melbourne Cup and the Bandwick Derby of next year. For tbe former race, Little Pish fras baaked for a couple of thousand at 100'a to 7, Bylong for nearly a similar amount jronrlOp tp 6to 7, Bagpickerat 500to20, Fenella BOp tp 25, The Barb, at . 600 to 40, and North Australian at 500 to 40. For the D^rbyj SOp. to j 25 was laid against Ch'ardn, $arbarlanj lAipjplighter, Agnes, and Mr. Lee's Kingston colt out of Vanity, and 100 to 20 fras, taken about Fireworks fot the' P; P. Stakes.

Barbelle ; ruBbed to tbe fore immediately after starting, and Thompson riding well on her shoulders, carried her in an easy winner several lengths. Marksman made a rush after enter* ; ing. the straight, and Donnelly stupidly tried to get up inside, but Thompson was notto be .. caught napping, and hugged the rails se tose ., that the former bad to poll ont, agd lost whatever chance he hacl of the race. Tin Drone, another of the Sir Hercules family* made his dSttt here, and did not do so hadiy* considering it was hijg Ant appearanoe. The Sydney Handicap gave us the only, race of the day. Hambleton Sill and Phasbe were nearly equal favourites, the former for choice. Four out of tbe eight on the card went to the poBt. The handicap was altogether spoilt by the absurd principle that, owing to the highest weight accepting being 7st. 101b., each horse was raised 16ib. Bach bones as Orlando and Young Mormon, being raised from 7st. 31b. to 8st. Sib. each, were .COB* sequently extinguished; neither could run under the weights, and Hambleton HQ1 and Phoebe had it all to themselves, and a very pretty little finish they made of it, Mr. Lee's " mare just catching the judge's eye by a head. Both caught pepper from the distance, both ran extraordingly game, were well ridden, and the struggle was witnesBed with great interest and excitement, the jockeys receiving hearty diem on returning to scale. But had Bamsay made more use of his horse at first, he would, have stood a better chance of winning. The Co rintban Cup, like a great many such races, was not worth looking at. Mr. Watson's old steeplechaser Comet, now the property of Colonel Waddy, was made a great pot, which says very little for the field; but the pot boiled over, as Mr. Bouse took his man Flirt to the front at once, and scattered his opponents like chaff before tbe wind; they followed him in Indian file about six lengths apart, but the grey mare proved the better horse, as die cantered in the winner by half-a-dozen lengths which she could have increased by ever so many dozen more bad her rider chosen.
