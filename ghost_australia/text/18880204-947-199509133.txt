Of course there are exceptions ,to' every/ rule, and' undoubtedly; the rich ought t'o! have a' far greater chance of con tentment' than others ' through ' their, life-1' paths' being rendered smoother. But; they ? ' are apt ! to create artificial wants for them-, selves that are ' difficult to be satisfied.'. Even 'those who, pace poor, dreamed that wealth'would give them untold happiness find that having gained gold and silver/ houses, 'and 'lands, something more; is required to -complete their felicity, for trueit is that ' men'ebange with fortune.' Surrouridihgs.associations, thought-coining leisure, * all conspire to bring a train of different' ideas to the mind destructive of contentnient, unloss in exceptionally iride- ; pendent ' natures.

Forin the busiest life there' are many 'empty hours that need 'filling, ; if one would banish saddening memories of lnight-havo-beens ?'? and never-inores* arid too-lates, that haunt one like ghosts ;? re placing the' demolished aerial castle3 that were^erected in the springtime of one's mortal career.1 ? Would one exorcise these gloomy iphantoffls, there is no surer method of doing so than by-'the perusal of some literary masterpiece j since Milton tells us ' Agood book is the precious life bl'oodr of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured' up on'purpose; to live beyoridsthe grave.' Good and evil1 spirits do 'not care about associating together. Melancholy becomes almost, in visible when the ? contents1 of a volume' of absorbing interest is poured into '-'the mind ; and although' there : are sowows that are imperishable,' still all are ' lessened by' thoughts being diverted from them into some other- channel; all ' are magnified through brooding over them. And -chief among books that bestow balm, on wounded hearts is the dear. old Bible; that every year we learn to love more .ten* derly, since it turns our meditations froui earthly sorrows to Divine things, impart^ ing to us' inexpressible comfort. *'? 'However heavy our 'cross' urny^ be; 'let' ue bear it ' patiently; trusting that it may thus be the means o£\ sanctifying our souls, '? and! ? re membering that '? all things ?work together for good to him who loyeth the Lord.' ! So we shall gain the blessing* all must covet — the fragrant flower contentment— for which, so many worldlings pine in vain.- — Believe me, truly yours, ; . ; Amioizi'a.
