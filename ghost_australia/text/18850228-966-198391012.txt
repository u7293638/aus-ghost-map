A CHINESE GHOST. Chu was an undergraduate of great courage and bodilv vigour, but dull of wit. He was a married man,*an<f his children (as in the old Oxford legend) often rushed into their mother's presence shouting. "Mamma, mamma, papa's been plucked again! Once it chanced that Chu was at a wine party, and the negus (a favourite beverage of the Celestials) had done its work. Bis young friends betted Chu a bird's-nest dinner that he would not go to the nearest temple, enter the room devoted to coloured sculptures representing the torments of Purgatory, and carry off the image of the Chinese Judge of tha Dead, their Osiris or Bhadamanthus. OS went old Chu, and soon returned with the august effiey (which wore " a green face, a red beard, and a hideous expression'') in his arms. The other men were frightened, and begged Chu to restore His Worship to his place on the infernal bench. Before carrying back the worthy MagistratejChu poured a libation on the ground, and said, " Whenever your Excellency feels so disposed I shall he elad to take a cup of wine with you in a friendly way." That very night, as Chu was taking a stirrup cup before going to bed, the ghost of the awful Judge came to the door and entered. Chu promptly put tue kettle on, mixed the negus, and made a night of it with the friendly fiend. Their friendship was never interrupted from that moment. The Judge even gave Chu a new heart (literally), whereby he was enabled to pass examinations; for the heart, in China, is the seat of all the intellectual faculties. For Mrs. Chu, a plain woman with a fine figure, the ghost provided a new head, of a handsome girl recently slain bv a robber. Even after Chu's death th® genial spectre did not neglect him, but obtained for him an appointment as registrar in the next world, with a certain rank attached.—Tht Magazintof An.
