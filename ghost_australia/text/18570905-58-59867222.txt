EXTRAORDINARY LEAP â€” We mentioned last week that the well-known old horse Fairplay broke his back, whilst following the Melbourne hounds ; but we could not at the time of writing, explain how it occurred, as our narrator, Nimrod's Ghost, merely saw the smash, and the pace was too good for inquisitive inquiries. We learn, however, from Mr. R., his owner, that Fairplay was carrying him away in his mouth at this unlucky fence, and that he rose 18 feet (by after measurement), from the jump. Although he struck thc top rail, he ibil not break it. but fell dead >-n lauding. Mr H., who for lunately escaped with a few bruises, slates it tu be his opinion that the animal broke his back at the moment of making this extraordinary spring, and not when topling over the timber. If this idea is correct, he is certainly the first sportsman who ever rode a dead horse over posts and rails, - Hell's Life in Victoria. August 29.
