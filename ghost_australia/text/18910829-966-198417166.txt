THE GHOST ILLUSION. This illusion still continues to attract visitors at the Cyclorama Buildings. A good programme is provided every day, and on Friday Professor Bousmard played Mattel's " Fourth Waltz," Madame Bousmard singing " Fiddle and I" most effectively. The show will be here only three weeks longer. The illusion is worth seeing.
