To the Editor. HOW SETTLEMENT IS PREVENTED IN THE TERRITORY. Sir,-It is a well-known fact that the Government Resident, Mr. Parsons, has expended a good deal of eloquence in trying to establish agriculture in the Northern Territory, without the ghost of a result. Witness Delissaville, and the Daly. I consider they have gone the wrong way about the matter from the first, and are going to make another gross mistake with their land sale on the Daly River in May. They have reserved all the good land there (and God knows there is not much of that in the Territory,) and are kindly going to allow the public a chance to secure a lot of useless swampy blocks. That don't look like encouraging settlement ! If the Government think settlers are mad enough to buy any swamp they think proper to advertise, they are labouring under a mistake, and the sooner they cure themselves of that de- lusion it will be the better for the Territory. They may get an Adelaide syndicate to deal with them, but some of these gentry have burned their fingers pretty well in Territory land already, but by the land transactions in the past and present, these are the men and the only men, that are wanted here. May they do the country as much good in the future, as they have accomplished already. The Government Garden I consider a useless toy. Why don't the Government have an experimental farm on the Daly or Adelaide Rivers, and experiment there with products suitable for the soil and climate ; people then could see what j the land would really grow, and if the country is good for anything it might be made to pay itself. That is the way they go about the thing in the other Colonies, and I don't see why it can't be done here too. A Botanical Garden is all very good as an ornament and pleasure ground in a large town, but we want something more profitable here. We have enough of beautiful natural scenery without resorting to expensive artificial. I am, Sir, yours, &c;, Bushman.
