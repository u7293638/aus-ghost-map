Poetry. A, AtTSTHA.LT A' 3 CENTURY. , Are we attaining fulfilment of promises, prophecies, uttered when work was begun, Under the red star and glittering white star of skies where Orion is king 2 HaTe we heaped measure on measure of knowledge, of uprightness 2 Heart have we cultured with tongue 2 Do we find manhood grown larger and fairer, thoughts fresher and freer, souls nearer the light, Under the red star and glittering white star of skies where Orion is king t . . Do we find braveness of spirit more widely expanded : ' and swifter response to the right 2 . Decades of centuries, filled with fierce strivings, made man as a ravenous beast iu a den Under the skies of cold old lands where weakness was prey to the meroiless strong. Have we made better of better conditions 2 made gardens of dens, and turned boasts into men 2 , - Cries of the hungry filled day with wild terrors, and echoes rang on through the vales of the night, Under the skies of cold old lands where weakness was prey to the merciless strong ; Ghosts of mad purposes, murderous mutinies, glared through the darkness and slunk through the light. ' Hope as a vision was haggard and weary whenever it looked on the ghastly sad ways, Under the skies of cold old lands where weakness was prey to the merciless strong. . What could he done with such sorrow transesndant 2 . , What brain could remodel 2 What heart could upraise 1 Surges of sea sang, and chorus of birds cried, and winds whispered welcome, and golden glades gleamed, Under the red star and glittering white star of skies where Orion is king, When the first hearers of civilisation stared spell bound around them, saw visions, and dreamed . Yet with a century what has there come of it 2 Keep we not still the old violent way, Under, the red star and glittering white star of skies where Orion is king 2 Wear we not talons and teeth 2 Hand and tear we \ not 2 Make we not night of the prophesied uay : â€” E. Loice, tn Time.
