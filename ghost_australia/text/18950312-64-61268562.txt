IF TARIFF REFORM IS CARRIED. MOREOVER they have abandoned the policy they announced during the late elections. What they proposed to do then was to abolish the Oit8tonis duties on stimulants and nar- cotics, and to impose a general land tax. The farmers, they averred, would benefit by this reform, because each would have to pay on the average only about £i a year to the Consolidated Revenue in the shape of a land tax, instead of about £15 or. £20 a year in Customs duties, as at present. Personally I am glad that the majority of the selectors are to be either partly or wholly exempted from land taxation; but the result of the kindness shown towards them must be the oppression of many of the large property owners, who in manv cases gave pretty stiff sums for their land. If tariff reform is curried out in the manner promised by the Govern- ment, it follows that it will be necessary to get about three-quarters of a million from the land, and this will have to be contributed by a comparatively few landowners. Surely this is not fair to them, nor is it in harmony with the Freetrade policy as it has been expounded ad nauscum during the last two or three years. Should Mr. Reid's bill be carried it will be necessary for him, if he would avoid the reproach of imposing class taxation, and acting unfairly towards one ; class of the landowners, to continue collecting duties on hundreds of important articles, and thereby become a recreant to his own prin- ciples. There is not, I believe, the ghost of a chance of his bill passing through the Législa- tive Council. The gentlemen in that chamber will make short work of it, whatever the consequences may be.
