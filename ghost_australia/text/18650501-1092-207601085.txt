NEW SOUTH WALES. A Headless Tboopeb !—The Riverine Berate says:—" We have not many recorded instances of supernatural visitations in the shape of ghosts in Australia. Some, however, have been spoken of. Dr. Lang, in his history of Hew South Wales, mentions one, through the instrumentality of whioh a foul murder was discovered; but that occur* rence took place many years ago, and ha3 well nigh passed away from the memory of the oldeBfc inhabitant. Most people have heard of that haunted - spot, the Black Swamp, between Deniliquin and the Murrumbidgee, round whioh, it is said, at the dead hour of the night, a headless trooper rideB a grey cob at full speed. We were assured the other day that a party of three men camped there lately for the night were nearly scared out of their senses by the appearance in the full moonlight of this mid night visitant. Our informant wap positive that the occurrence had taken place, and we believe he was sinoere in his belief as to the appearance of the appa rition. . It does not take much to impose on the senses of a certain class of bushmen, who are quite as superstitious as their seagoing brethren." A Blight oe Imagination !—The Riverine Berate says:—"A few days ago four hawks were observed to be engaged in a conflict at a considerable height close to the township. After the battle had been waoed for some time, a substance of considerable siza was seen to fall from among them, whioh on being examined was found to be a whole shin of beef that one of the marauders had no doubt filched from soma butchering establishment in the town. The weight was considerable, and it was a matter of amazement to the parties who picked it up that it could hava been carried into the air by a bird of the size of brown hawk." Is our contemporary sure that is was not a leg instead of a shin of beef that was dropped ?
