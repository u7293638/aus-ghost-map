A HEADLESS GHOST AT THE DUNDONGS AND A TRUNKLESS GHOST AT CIECULAE QUAY. The Upper Bogan correspondent of the Dubho Dispatch states " that the mailman, last trip up, says he saw a man without a head walk past him while camping at the Dundongs the other night. Other people have seen, or fancied they saw, something there. A man was murdered there years ago. and his name is cut on a tree in the locality." Surely it must be " Bogey " that has, from time imme morial, frightened the children. Is not the " Upper Bogan " named after him. But then, what was he doing without his head ? This is a startling query. What a cool customer he must be to walk about without this necessary appendage. We wish our contemporary had stated what sort of a neck he had on, and whether he carried a walking cane ; also, if he perceived the shaft upon which the head screws, and whether the worm round it appeared to have been oiled lately. By- the-bye, a pair of legs, neatly clad in a pair of walking trousers, having on Belmore elastic-side boots, have been seen walk ing round the Circular Quay during the last few moonlight evenings. There is no trunk or body to these legs, and they trip over the gut ters, wherein water lays, and trip over logs very lightly. They seem derermined not to dirty their boots. They never show by day time, and much speculation is rife as to what their advent portends. The following advertisement, which appeared in yesterday's Empire, may give some clue to them : — " Shanks. "If Eitzroy Shanks, who left England in the Dover Castle in No vember, 1861, and landed at Sydney, will communicate with George Cheatle, Esq. , solicitor, Holborn, London, he will hear of something to his advantage." Can it be possible that the legs in question are " Fitzroy's Shanks ' —Sir Charles, we mean— and that they are afraid of communicating with Mr. Cheat- all on account of his name ? 9
