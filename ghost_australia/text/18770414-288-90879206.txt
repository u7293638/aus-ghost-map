' .? ; It has been isuggested to us that'iii our \ article appearing in : ^Friday's Advertiser upon : the revenue for the 'March quarter 'we- 'were in j error in speaking of the receipts ior the nine ! months ending 31st March as a deficiency, be cause they were £30,600; 16s. lOd, in excess of ! tbe receipts for the three quarters' ending 31st j March, 1876/ In reply we bave only to say that i we did not profess to compare those periods \ witbeach other. 'We'Teferred to the estimated ? revenue for the year which will end on the 30th '?? June next, namely, £1,328,764, and stated that ; the receipts for the nine months fell short of ; three-fourths of that amount by J32.449 4s. lid., ? and this statement, according to the Govern ment figures, is strictly acenrate.

Thus at .came to pass that what promised- to be a most successfully-organised _ expedition ended in ;disaster. It,. is probable that the best, face will be put upon the affair now.

The deceased who was about 50 ysars old, was formerly the landlord of the Squatters' Arms, Thebarton.' ? On Sunday afternoon (writes the Border 'Watch of April 4) some foolish person set fire to the rank grass and bushes on the bank of the Blue Lake near the northern end of the cutting. The day was a dry one, and there being a fresh freeze, the flames spread rapidlyj and burnt several acres on the bank of the Lake. The want of grass at the top. of the bank prevented the fire spreading to .private property; but a few chains of the fence at the side of the cutting, Greeted1 as a1 protection ;tb'~pasBengers^ was de stroyed.' .

He left here and went on -the tramp, and was. last seen aliye no great distance from ' where these remains were found. He has never since been heard of, although enquiries have been made : for hint. He left here wearing new white moleskin trousers, andnew boots. Similar articles were found oh the skeleton, and there is little doubt that the remains are those of Watson. He did hot appear to have, died for want of food, as he had 'some bread in a leather bag, with some newspaper bearing date April 24, 1875. The drynessof the last two seasons, together. with the body being on the side of a hill, would ac CDunt for the preservation of the clothes. Water was alsd near the remains.' ^ The following particulars of accidents are taken from the Burra News of- April 6 .:— ' At the races, on Monday, the rider of Mr. Crabb's horse Doctor was thrown while coming up the first round for the Burra Handicap, through the breakage of a portion of the saddle, and sustained a fracture of his collar- bone. Dr.. Cave, who was on the ground, attended to the injury. — A man named George George was ad mitted into.the Burra Hospital on Wednesday, suffering from injuries received through a blast in a quarry at Mount Bryan Flat having ex ploded before he was able to get clear. He was badly burned on his face, arms, and side ; but under'thecareof Dr. Brummitt he is now pro gressing favorably.— On Thursday last a son of Mr. T. Warnes, of the Princess Koyal, got his right hand between the cog-wheels of a mangle, and before it could be extricated the first tind second fingers were severely lacerated. The little sufferer was attended by Dr. Cave, who found it necessary to remove some bone from the second finger. , He is now progressing favorably.' A lost child is the subject of the follow ing paragraph taken from the Burra News : — 'O/n Monday afternoon, April 2, a boy named Alfred Williams, aged six years, son of Mrs. Williams, living on Limestone Hill, went out ?with some companions to pick mushrooms, and by some means got separated from them. They imagined he had gone home, but on their return to Kooringa they, found he had not put in an appearance, and the mother begau to get anxious. A search was instituted, and Can stables Bennett and Wilson spent the greater part of Monday night on the surrounding hills, but without finding any trace of the little truant. On Tuesday morning, shortly after sunrise, Trooper Hillier started in quest, and learned from enquiries that he had goae in the direction of Daviston. The troopsr pro ceeded direct towards Daviston, and when within a short distance of that place met; Mr. John Baggp, jun., accompanied by the missing one, whom he had found while looking for some sheep. The truant was not much the worse for his wanderings, and still had in his possession a tin dish which he had taken out with him for mushrooming/purposes. It appears that he had called at Mr. Baggs's house, Spring Bank, on Monday night in the absence of the occupier. Some members of the household gave him some food and directed him to the Burra, but he dis regarded their instructions, and went in the opposite direction.' . ' An accident at the Burra Mine is thus described by the local paper of April 6: — 'On Tuesday morning' considerable excitement Was caused by -a report that the main pumping-rod of the mine had broken. On enquiry we found the intelligence only too true. It appears that about 4.20 a.m., on Tuesday, the second length of the rod broke about six or eight fathoms down, and to use the mining phrase, ' the engine came indoors.' The bob of the pump is of ca&t; iron, and weighs nearly 30 tons. Of course, when the rod. parted a tremendous weight was taken off the outer end of the bob ?^-theshaft being 85fathoms deep — and the inner, end -came down with terrific force. The horn plate struck the spring beams with great violence, and broke each ol them right through. The beams are of sound timber 2 feet 10 inches deep by 14§ inches wide, and in addition to the fracture by the hornplate they are also broken near the hearing well. The bearings of the bob were lifted^ about two inches out of place. The concussion' must' have been tremendous, owing, to the great weight of the machinery, and it is fortunate- the damage is n© greater than, it is. The piston came violently doivn in the cylinder, and. is cracked in several places, but it can be repaired, ? the weight of the blow having been sustained- t-y the -spring beams. Fortunately the engine-house, was strengthened about a month ago, otherwise it would probably have needed partially- rebuilding. Owing to the accumulation of water .in the mine all under ground work has had to be suspended; in fact, it may be said the only work-doing on the mine is the repairing of the damage. Work wilL' probably be ; started in same parts daring next -week, but ii will be a considerable time before everything is inT, working order again.' A meeting of the Catholic Young Merfs Society was to have been. held. -at St. Francis SaVier's Hall on Tuesday evening, April '10 j 'at which the subject of immigration was to have been debated. It was announcediihat His Lord^ ship Dr. Reyiolds would preside, but on the day of the meeting he received a telegram from the Archbishop of Sydney calling liim to that city on business.' His Lordship left at once by the steamer Victorian, and in his absence the meet ing was adjourned for a fortnight. ' At a meeting of the City Council, held o 3 Monday, April 9, a letter was read from the contractor for the new City Bridge, stating that the structure would-be completed and ready to open for- traffic on or, before the 18th of -the present month. The arrangements connected with' the opening demonstration were left to His Worship the Mayor. A motion by Coun cillor MathewSjthat the new bridge should be named the Albert Bridge, was negatived, ii being felt that the: name City Bridge was the ; most appropriate/ : . The first business meeting of the Port Elliot Literary Association for the session of 1877, was held in the district Schoolroom, on Monday evening, April 9. when the retiring President (Mr. C .H. Hussey) announced that he did not purpose standing for re-election, on account of business engagements, but he had great pleasure in stating that the Rev. E. T.

Thesam^ voted- to. relieve the various cises 'brought forward atrthe meeting, together with that for emergency-orders during the ' past ? month, amounted to- £11 .9s., being to relieve 23 cases. Each member of the Committee was empowered to dtaw-fe i3ie extent of 10s. in cases of emer gency during the ensuing month. Mr. -Ellis1 Edwards resigned his position on 'the Com mittee, he being about to. leave the colony on a ' visit to JSnglaiid. . -. -. ' ; ; On Monday evening, April 9, the open-'! ing meeting of the present session of the Literary Club was held in the Baptist Lecture . Hall, Flinders-street. There was an average attendance of members. The Committee's ra port was extremely eatisfactory, showing that the number of members had increased, and that a great improvement had taken place in the attendance. The balance in hand was nearly £A. The Librarian's report showed the circula tion of books to have been nearly doubled. The following 'officers were elected: — Presi- dents, Rev. S.

An adjourned meeting of the Narra coorte Hospital Committee was held in the Institute Library on Friday afternoon, April 6, Mr. H. J. Smith in the chair. A telegram from Mr. T. Magarey, Adelaide, stated his willing ness to give five acres of Section21. A cordial vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Magarey for his liberal gift.-and the' -Secretary was in* structed to forward the same to that gentleman. On the motion of Mr. McGrilchrist, seconded by Mr. Wood j it was resolved that the Government be requested to give 20 acres of land adjoining Section 21. The plans for the building were considered, and it was resolved by a majority of one to give the first prize to Mr. Trenter and the second to Mr. Lobban. It was decided to accept Mr. Trenter's plan for the building ? on condition that some alterations were made iu the elevation. On Tuesday afternoon, April 10, a meeting of the General Committee of the Children's Hospital was held at Mr. Turnbull's offices, Currie-street. There was a good atten dance, and His Honor the Chief Justice pre sided. Apologies for absence were received from Mrs. L. G. Carter, Mrs. Campbell, and Mr. SinedJey. The Hon. Treasurer ( Air. J. L. Parsons) reported that he had received from all sources io date £1,725 3s. 8d., that the Baak balance that day was £275 14s. 6d , and he had cash, in hand £24 3s. Besides this they had on deposit £554 2s. 66.., and also £500. He hf d received since last meeting — from His Honor the Chief Justice, £105 ; from Mrs. Hy. Scott, £50; from Mrs. Frederick Wright, £44 10s.; from Mrs. Wm. Milne, £15 7s. 7d.; and from Mrs. Beach £18 15s. 6d. They had paid on deposit for land £500, and £50 commission. There were outstanding promises as follow : — Mr. E. Barr Smith, ^6500; Messrs'. D. & J. Fowler, £105; Messrs. D. & W.Murray, £105; Messrs, Bowman Bros, (on the establishment of the institution), £105; and a lady in Eugl:-nd £10. He., thought the actual receipts at the present moment were £1,827 19s. 8d. In the absence of Mr. Tonikinson, the convener of the Building Site Committee, Mr. Parsons stated that the Committee had determined to purchase two acres of land placed under offer to them. A deposit had been, paid, and he held a receipt from Mr. J. A. Chartiers, agent, for the payment of £500 on Sections 731 and 732. There was a cottage on the land which 'was-bringing in 4s. -a week. Dr. Canipbsll reported the receipt of a letter from His Excellency the Governor consenting to give his patronage to a cricket match between the Muff Club and the All-England Eleven,the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the funds of the Children's Hospital, and stating that he hoped to visit the Children's Hospital in a week or two.- (Laughter.) A letter was received from Mr. W. F. Biicke, stating that he would take charge of an entertainment on behalf of the Children's Hospital. Received, and the offer accepted with thanks. On the motion of Mr. Parsons, seconded by Dr. Curtis, it was de cided that there should be six trustees of the Children's Hospital, and the first six gentle men nominated were His Honor the Chief Justice, the Hon. J. Colton, Messrs. J. H. Angas, B.. B. Smith, D. [Murray, and Dr. Campbell. The trustees' were empowered to get a convey ance of the property executed. Mr. Salom moved, and Dr. Curtis seconded, that the insti tution should be incorporated under the Act. Dr, Campbell said now that they had a site for the Hospital and a four-roomed cottage it would be as well to open a dispensary. He had visited the property purchased, and had looked over the house, and he thcught that with some little ad ditions or alterations they would be able to accommodate out-door patients. He would ? move that the hon. medical officers bs re quested to visit the site and report on the steps necessary to be taken for the opening of a dispensary for out-door patients. Dr. Curtis seconded, and said Mr. Smith, chemist, North Adelaide, had waited on him and' had., offered, to do the dispensing for the Hospital at half the usual rates. Carried. Mr. J. H. Angas moved that a deputation, consist ing of as many gentlemen as there were names on the Committee able to attend, should Wait on the Government, and request them to .place on the Estimates a sufficient amount to supple ?. meat contributions , foe .building the Hospital. It would be well to get the Government ; to place the amount on the Estimate* before the House met, and as promises ; and subscriptions to the extent of £3,000 had been received, it would not be too much to : ask for that amount. He knew that there were ; many members- of the Government who took an ; interest in the Children's Hospital, and no doubt the deputation. Vould be favorably met. : Dr. -Curtis seconded, suggesting that ladies ; should attend on the deputation, as they would ! be more difficult to refuse than 'would gentlemen. (Laughter.) . . This suggestion ? was overruled, as it ?- was felt that it i would be more' business-like if the deputa ! tiou ' ^were- ^constituted in the ordinary , manner. Dr. Campbell hardly agreed with the | mover, thinking that they should wait until i they, had raised £5,000, when they would.be in , a position to ask for a larger subsidy. Mr. ! Augas .said they would not have more diffi ; culty in getting .£3.000 now than £5,000 six. I months hence and it would be better to get a ; subsidy at once. The motion was parried, and \ the meeting terminated. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Adelaide (Eev. Dr. Eeynolds) was a passenger by the sttamer Victorian, which left Port Adelaide on Tuesday. It is stated that the goods of the Rev. Father Paul, Catholic priest at Auckland, have been . seized for non-payment of the education rate. . / The Hon. R. A. Tarlton has shown us a ; letter he has received from the Rev, James Jeff eris, dated Sydney, April 3, in which the rev.' gentleman says : — 'The journey overland was very enjojable ; an old traveller like, my self laughs at inconveniences which annoy others. The entire distance was a holiday ti-ip,and I would gladly repeat it next week. I felt a strange longing when nearing Sydney to turn round and just journey back again. If I dared I would have done it. My heart sunk within me as the new life began to open into : rccliiy. Again and again I yearn for the old sceres acd fiiends and . labors, but in three menths time, no doubt, I shall be piilling steadily in this new and galling harness on the ne-w and uphill road.' . We have received a copy of a pamphlet containing complete reports of the various . presentations and addresses to the B.ev' J. Jefferis, , LL.B., prior to his departure for Syd ney. Thereports commence with the Anniversary : Meeting of the North Adelaide Congregational Church, when his ministerial brethren bade him a formal farewell, and include the valedictory ? resolution of the Church, the addresses of :the Sunday-school, the Young Men's Association, and the Houghton Church ; the meeting at the Town Hall with the.Chief Justice's speech ; and Mr: Jefferis's replies to all. The rev. gentle man's farewell sermon is also given, the whole , forming an interesting memento, which will no doubt be prised 'by Mr. Jefferis's numerous friends in the colony. - ? . The impressive service of raising a candidate tothebrder of the priesthood,according to the ritual of the Church of Rome, was cele : brated a,t the Roman Catholic Cathedral, Wake : field-street, on Sunday morning, April B, by the 'Lligut Rev.. Dr. Reynolds. The church was crowded. The Rev. Father Prendergast , preached the ordination sermon, speaking of the high dignity to which the members of the priesthood are raised. : The candidate who was raised was the Rev. M. Sullivan, a student of St. Aloysius College, Sevenhills. This is the second gentleman from -.; that College who has received Holy Orders, the other being the Rev. G.i=Willianis, who was ordained last month on the Feast of St. Patrick. Tlie, first of; a series of evangelistic services, conducted by Jffr.' W.; Corrie Johnston, was held in the. Presbyterian Church, Flinders street, on Monday evening, April 9. There was a good congregation . Mr. Johnston took for his text — ' Th'e -Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey Him/'^-^-Acts v. 32. The address was characterised, by the great ability with which it was delivered and the earnestness of the speaker, and it appeared to make a great impression on those present.' The services will be continued throughout the week. On Monday. evening, April 9, the quarterly meeting of the Hindmarsh, Bowden, and Brompton Auxiliary of the Sunday-school Union was held in Bowden- Bible Christian Chapel. There was a fair, attendance, and Mr. James Harry presided. After half an hour had been spent 4n devotional services, Mr. Jas. P. Roberts gave a blackboard address. He used a sketch of a lighthouse as illustrative of the Bible being (1-) wanted, (2) well-constructed, (3) well-lighted ; and centred the whole in the text,' I am the light of the world.' The address was interesting, instructive, and somewhat novel' A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Roberts.1 At tlie monthly Committee meeting of the Sunday- school Union, held on Monday evening, April 9, in'StOw Church Vestry (Mr. D.

On Good Friday tea and public meetings in connection witfi the anniversary of the Kapunda Wesleyan Sunday-school were held, at which a farewell- address was pre sented to the Rev. Thos. Lloyd (Chair man of the District), who is about to leave Kapunda for Moonta. Mr. J. Barndon pre sented the address, which deeply regretted that the Conference should have felt called upon to place Mr. Lloyd in charge of another Circuit before his full term had expired, ex pressed a hope that his reappointment in their midst would speedily occur, and acknow ledged with thankfulness the rev. gentle man's able and faithful ministry, the counsel he had given, and the deep interest he had taken in the school during the two years of his pastoral oversight. Mention was also made of the esteem in which Mrs. Lloyd -was held as a Christian lady. Mr. H. Wheare, one of the Circuit Stewards, referred to the kindly regard in which Mr. Lloyd was held by tlie people. The Rev. Mr. Lloyd made an appro priate reply, alluding to the changes which had taken place in Eapunda and elsewhere since he commenced his ministerial labors. The rev. gen tleman . preached his farewell sermon on the following Sunday evening, when the church was crowded. The Sunday-school in connection with the Church of Christ, Port Adelaide, held its first annual treat, near the foot of the hills, on Thursday, April 5. This school, which was organised a little over a year ago (a few months after fifr. Martin began his labors in Port Adelaide) now numbers over 60 scholars with five teachers. The- picnic was thoroughly en joyed by the children and the friends who accompanied them. An excellent luncheon had been provided solely, we understand, by Mrs. W. G. Magarey who, a correspondent informs us, ' also gave a similar one a few days ago to about 40 children whom she teaches in her own house on Sunday- afternoons. The annual - picnic in connection with Trinity Church Sunday-school was held on Tuesday, April 10, on the picturesque grounds of Mr. R. B. Smith, J.P., and passed off most suc cessfully under the management of the Incum bent (the Rev. R. Reid) and an efficient staff of teachers. Although the weather was somewhat threatening in the morning, as the day ad vanced the; sun shone out brightly, gladdening ??he hearts of the excursionists,. The children were, with their teachers, conveyed to Torrens Park in a number of Messrs. Hill & Co.'s omnibuses. Arrived there, teachers , and scholars alike devoted themselves to the various games provided for their amusement. The comcrissariat department was well man aged by -Mr. Smith, of Hindley-street, and the gocd things provided were /thoroughly enjoyed ; by all, including several friends, who visited the grounds during the day. Before leaving ; the park for home the picnicers expressed their thanks to Mr, Smith for having so kindly placed Ins grounds at their disposal during the day. All returned in safety to the schoolroom, where a vote of thanks was warmly accorded to Mr. tnd Mrs. Reid for the great interest and exer tion shown by them in providiEg for the enjoy ment of both scholars and teachers. After a few parting words, the young folks were dis missed to their, homes, all seeming to have thoroughly enjoyed their day's outing. On 'Wednesday evening, April 11, a service of song was held at the Kent Town Wesleyan Church, in aid of the funds of the Lecture Hall in connection with that church. .The service consisted of a series of songs from the well-known and much-admired composition,'*1 entitled ' Eva/ compiled and arranged from ' Uncle Tom's Cabin' by James Tipton. The ~ introductory readings were ? given by the Rev. W. P. Wells. The songs were ably | sung by the .teachers and scholars belong j ing to the Sunday-school, and reflected great ! credit on the conductor, Mr. Chas. Hack, for j the admirable', manner in which the vocalists were arranged, and for tlSJF precision with which each song was rendered. The. service was accompanied by a band and by the organ, at -which Mr. W. R. Pybus presided. There was a large attendance, and the service was con sidered in every way successful, Cn Monday evening/ April 9, the inaugural soiree ojEL the eighteenth session of the Isorth Adelaide i Young Men's Society was held in.th'e schoolroom beneath the Congrega tici:a] Church, ^drth Adelaide. There was a' Inrge and an appreciative audience. The pro gr: n: me, though not large, was well selected, ; consisting of duets, songs, &c;, and 'concluded v.ith the, second scene from the Poet Laureate's recently produced drama 'Harold.' After an overture by Miss McNicol,. the Chairman (Mr., T. W. Harris) said he held his position tLrcugh being the oldest member of the tSoriety, a position which had been occu pied worthily for the past 17 years by the Rev. Mr. Jefferis, to whom they had tendered, a tangible and sincere recognition of the value of the services he had rendered the Society Kt hoped that Mr. Jefferis's exampl v ould remain with them for years to come. In \- comparison with other Societies they held their own ^although numerically they were not the ??? gtroDgest.still their library equalledany. The past . seesion had been marked by an unusual amount of thonghrfulness, and= he had every reason to think the session they were then inaugu rating would not be behbsd its predecessors. In concluding, Mr. Harris warmly recommended the Society to all young men desiring good companions and wholesome culture, also ex pressing a wish that their ranks would be augmented, which would- not only benefit the Society, but he hoped would confer advantages on those joining. The Misses Everett in the duet, 'I heard a voice,', which .was sung ?well and in good time, . were deservedly encored, as was .Mr. Oehlmann in the popular song. ' Come into the garden, Maud.' In the drama, Harold (Earl of Wessex) was taken by Mr. D. J. Adcock, Wil liam (Count of Normandy) by Mr. A. H. Neale, Malet (a Norman noble) by Mr. F. Johnson, and Wulf north (.Harold's brother) by Mr.,F. Jacobs. The amateur actors sustained their parts in a very creditable manner, and at the conclusion of the piece were warmly applauded. On 'Wednesday, April 4, a successful bazaar was held in the Council Chamber, Gepp's Cross, to raise funds to purchase a library for the Sunday-school -of; St. Clement's Church: For months past the ladies of the congregation and friends had been engaged in preparing ar ; tides, and certainly, their .exertions were not in vain. Throughout the room specimens of ex cellent handicraft of all descriptions were temptingly displayed. The stalls were presided over by Mesdames Raglas, Walker, Constant, Haynef, and Newbon (2),' and the Misses Barker, Thompson, and Frinsdorf, while Mr. Hill attended to. the creature comforts of the; visitors. At 1 o'clock a busy trade was opened, and continued unabated until 9 o'clock, when almost' the whole stock was d; posed of. Visi tors were present from Adelaide and the sur rounding districts.

Members of the various societies walked in procession from the Temperance Eall, Commercial-street, to the scene of festivi ties. The large procession and the inspiriting strains of a band of music induced some hundreds of persons to accompany the holiday makers.

Wine v.as then introduced, and the health of P.P.P. Wilson was eulogistically proposed and drunk y.ith Lodge honors and suitably acknowledged. The first of a course of twelve lectures, on 'The Ancient Physical Geography and Geology of South Australia,' in connection ?with the University of Adelaide, was given by. Professor Tate, F.G.S., in the reading-room of the Institute on Monday evening, April 9. There was a larje attendance. His Lordship the Bishop (Chancellor of .fcLe University) .pre- , sided: and theie wercvjalso on the^latJorm -the Chief Justice (Vice-CLaneelior), the Hoa#R. ,= D. lloss, and Mr'. ^Y. A. E. West-Erskine. The ,' Chairman referred to the importance and in- - terest of geological study, and said lie! had 'nb _'/ doubt ;tuat tlie Professors courseof lectures* v would prove ±hcrbua;My - instructive as well as '& interesting. He hoped that at future lecture,d| His. Excellency the Governor, who was unahklH to be present that evening, would preside. P'r6^§B fessorTate, who was received with applause,^ ! then commenced' his lecture, illustrating hi3 « I remarks' by occasional reference to diagrams M and the use of a blackboard. From the syllabus '^ printed for the. convenience of the audience, it appears that it was the intention of the lec turer^ to treate aort the^ educational value ! and objects of .geological science, geolo ! gical preliminaries embracing the r origin ! and phenomena of igneous and sedidientaryr I rocks, a'nd the' classification of sedirpSsatary j rocks, and finally to deal with the- surfacb* | features of -South Australia, Vie coast Scenery/ and its relation to rockisfcructure. Wankofciioie,i however,-,prevented the Professor from fulfilling} his original purpose, and he /was unable to^enter. fully into that part .of .his subject 'Ia«trmenT^ tioned, which will commence his next'leictnixeV* ' Tbe Professor commenced an exceedingly^ irite-^ resting address by exiolling the value of nataralp .-. science as a branch of education, and especialljfl the importance of geology. The practical advan tages of. a knowledge of geological facts were next explained, .the lecturer .incidentally re- - f erring to the valuable results which- would accrue from the preparation of a gebtogicat map of South Australia. .The prmciptestof the science having been dilated upon, the lecturer :: showed on the map the boundaries of the- part3-f ?;.' the colony with which he intended: to deal .-finj his lectures. These stretched, from -Spencer!s.^ Gulf . and. Lake Torrens' easterly, and thence southward to the Mount Gambler Districlr1 ^ffic, Tate spoke of SduiE [Australia as a gobH' field' for scientific research in this direction, and con cluded rwith'. an eloquent description of theplea sures enjoyed ,by those, who made -exauM ions for. : the purpose of studying the geological pheno^ meiia of a country. -The lecture was .listened to with great attention^ and ,at its close Mr. Tate was loudly applauded. It is intended ?to* have in cbrnection with the series of lectures two excursions on Saturday afternoons forths? purpose of studying geology in the open air; - : ._? '{ On Thursday evening, April 5, the Adelaide Amateur Dramatic Society jgave an entertainment in White's Rooms iu aid of the Blind and Deaf and Dumb Asylum, under the patronage of the.Chief Justice, Mr. S: J. Way, and Mr. W. Townsend, Chairman of Com mittees. The Society was assisted by Miss.* Blanche Gray, Miss- Tilly Francis,' and*1 a lady amateur. The attendance was not so great as either- the object or the excellence of the performance i deserved^ but that was no doubt to be attributed to the fact that Mr. Arnies Beaumont's benefit was drawing a crowded house at the Theatre Royal. The first part of the programme consisted of Mr, C, H. Hazel wood's 'Staff of 'Diamonds,' a ' drama in two actSj performed for the first time': in Adelaide. The piece describes one of those heart-recdiag scenes which have too ottean : occurred in real life wherever slavery has :. held its sway. A husband, wife, and child,. all -,-, slaves under a kind-hearted master, heepme.^. separated by the- jnaster, through, monetary^ ?difficulties, he having been obliged tp,part with the h usband to the governor of a diamond mine, who for his purpose does ^not require the wifet* . and child. The overseer- of the plantation where this slave family! has. lived happily 'S-ggether^ has had a bitter hatred of the wife because she has always resented his. insolence while under the protection of her husband, who is a favoiite with the master, iand no sooner is the husband taken away th^n.!the;: brutish overseer threatens to vent his spiggsSp&f; on the unprotected woman by taking awf^sner child and ill-using her into the bargain; \The .-'-' woman endeavors-to escape with her child and get to where her husband 4s. 'A v series of captures and recaptures take place, in which the., inevitable British tar^lwayg-'^: comes to the -rescue. 'Finally ' tKe* whole :; party, consisting of husband, -wife, .and child, with the -British tar and their comical friend from Farringdon-street, London' ^ fust -as' theyr ' imagine themselves to have clearly .escaped, are: captured .and condemned to death', when Capt., - Leclerc, of the Brazilian service, steps in and ? -r declares, that slavery -? is abolished throughout, !. the land, and all are. free. The acting was ex-; ceedingly good all through, and Miss Blanche Gray's performance was worthy of special remark. She displayed in a most' able manner the' tenacity iwith: -which. ;';.a mother clings to her,, child even through the utmost perils, and the . fortitude a woman may 'possess when she feels herself : the victim of injustice. The. second pars; of the performance was aiarce called, 'Retained for; the defence,'-ah amusing piece, which served w- restore to merriment any 'whose hearts might have been saddened by the tragic influences of the preceding 'drama. The whole affair was^a decided success. ' =./' : .

'? been carried, and all the field-glasses on '?'- board were constantly in requisition to discern; : a glimpse of the thin brown line, high in the : air, along which Blondin was to pass ,on his . r perilous journey. Soon they were close to\itj\ \ temmed in by the. steep forest^covered shores; ['; and almost immediately, as a piece of ordnance r was fired, the satisfaction was had of seeing theri adveaturous gymnast .appearing on the south eastern end of his hempen causeway;, high up s. amongst. the rocks and trees. Burdened as he r was with a pole oveF 60 lbs.- in .weight, 'he' ; stepped on, at first slowly but firmly, and with a confidence that wa£ discernible by the spec tators below. Afterwards ohe' walked a*-;1a quicker; pace until he arrived 'at ?! anii awkward place, extending, jaearly :. 20; feet,., , where iwo , ropes, of. unequal thickness Jaaj'. been spliced. Here a slow pace was re^jBsite^'T' but after passing this ] spbt 3J&. tfEstiaSigefj: thinking- himself entitled to »= re3t,exfcende-i ''?? himself on the rope on his back, amidst ^reat ... cheering. Springing to his feet the^Mmaind^r of the aerial passage was accomplished with iV alacrity and- apparent ease until 'the- south'- ' western end of : the rope was approachedj.which, . by reason of its gravitating bend; has- there. i--» visible ascent 4 but the gymnast eventually passed the tops of the trees on: that iside, ana landed on---th.eL rock .to. which the . ropfe is.

The timis occupiedj including -fee rest, was about 10 minutes. The party landed' and clambered i/ among the rocks and trees, until they reached the fastening of the rope on the nor^hrweatern - side of . the inlet. From .this spot a picturesque view was obtained of the surrounding kcenery, and of the great carvature in the iopeV ?«[& its '?'-'.. 16 guys, in spite of the great tension that^has - been put upon it. Though notsolobservable^ from the steamer, it here looked literally up and down hill, and from ^that . spo^ a walk along, it seemed a most for midahle undertaking. .
