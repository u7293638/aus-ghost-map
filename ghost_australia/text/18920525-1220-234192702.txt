HAMLET RE-CREATED. And the man that did it was Beerbolim Tree, the most impersonal and versatile of all our actors. Hamlet, the unspeakable Dane, lias of late years been done to death by ambitious artists who successively nave repiieu to tne 10 oe witn "not to oe. The sight of "Wilson Barrett disporting his cumbrous length on the steps of the throne, and soliloquising before a Princess's audience was not one to forget easily. Poor bested Dane, lie lias indeed suffered the " slings and arrows of outrageous" — actors. But Mr. Beerbolim Tree has bid the dead bones live, and the manes of Shakespeare are appeased. There was a splendid first night audience in the Tlaymarket on the Thursday the play opened. Mr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the role admirably. Hamlet's underlying , love for Ophelia is beautifully accentuated by tone -<< if M )" ;iij)i; and glance, Tlie house « as moved en masse at .vhi, end of the second act, when bending over liis tablets by the red fire, Hamlet cries, " The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." In the fifth act the churchyard is a spring parterre of blooms, a new rendering, and thither Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The fencing scene with Laertes is a magnificent piece of intellectual grasp, shown in the actor's expression and acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and reads liis treacheiy. Then again, Sir. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a 'charming Ophelia, delicately as well as strongly given. Mr. Arthur Dacre, as Horatio, also secured a triumph, and Mr. Fernandez, as Ghost, and Mr. Fred Terry as Laertes were generally successful. Shakespeare this season at tlie Hayhiarket will not qiell ruin. '
