Dying Out. Many of us can remember the days when whist- ling men and boys were almost as common as whistling birds, when the Btreets and workshops would resound with the shrill music of the merry whistler ; but nowadays the practice seems to be dying out. One íb Beldom tempted to offer a boy a piece of string to tie up his whistle, for the very simple reason that the opportunities for such joking are comparatively few. According to/ the old writerB, people used to whistle for want of thought, and in the dark to keep up their courage and scare the ghosts away. It is a question, however, if perBons aro any more thoughtful to- day than they were a century or so ago, and we must look to other causes for the reason why whistling is going out of fashion. Boys of the present generation make no attempt to cul- tivate the art, because of their mouths being too much occupied by the everlasting cigarette or pipe, while the practice of chewing, bo general among artisans at their work, and the presence of the pipe between their lips as they go to and fro, prevent them enjoying the leBB harmful indulgence of whistling so common a few years ago. The most that many men can now perform in the ^oy of whistling is the long-drawn-out wail when an unusually surprising piece of information ia told to them. Whistling as an art may eventually become the prerogative of women. Even now, many aro proficient performers, and can whistle for a dog or whistle for a living. Information haß reached Uralla that B, Quinn and party, who for some time past have been prospecting at Sunnyside, about 25 mi", ».j from Uralla and one mile from Sher- wood, have been rewarded by striking a reef which the prospectors estimate will yield 20oz, of gold to tho ton. The reef, said to be 7ft. wide, is within a few yards of the spot | where W. A. Jones, W. Cook, and others wera prospecting for a reef at the time I JMclroBe was booming.
