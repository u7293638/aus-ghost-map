The watch dogs howl and bay ; I pale, and Icnvo off Broiling. Oqly the other day I bold yonr heart in play, Intent upon beguiling. A little while aeo I wrnng jour soul with sighing ; Or brought a sudden glow Into your cheek by low , Soft answers, in replying. My life was all disguise, A mark'of feints", and'fancies j' I used to lift my ejes, And take you„by surprise With smiles aud upward glances. And now, where'er I go (| Yonr oad ghost follows after ; And blue the frame burn? low, And doors creak to and fro, And Bilent grows the laughter.
