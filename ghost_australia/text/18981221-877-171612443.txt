The sky has been cloudy all day, and wo havo just had the ghoBt of a shower, not enough to blot out what a reverend visitor once aptly described as ' a dreary sweep of ugliness.' But a thunderstorm is brewing, and there may bo rain enough to satisfy us all before long. Let us hope there will. At the bicycle sports at Nabiac on Saturday, 10th instant, Mr. Blaiklock was champion. One com petitor had a nasty fall, dislocating a thumb and re ceiving a few bruises, but ho picked himself up and followed the race. Another did not put in an ap pearance at all, having mot with an accident the day before whilo practising, the result being serious enough to need medical attendance. The Sherwood-M'Gowan Dramatic Company is playing to full houses out here. We are having quito'a large number of entertainments compara tively, and folk seem to be making the most of the opportunities for enjoying themselves.
