Thy Kingdom dome. ' — .-? T\ — ' ? A 8ermoa by Hcvbt Qboboe, del. '? lirered od Sunday, 28th April, 1889, in the City Hall, %: Glasgow; ' We hare just joined in *he most solemn,, the toost sacred, tbe most catholic of *)! prayers: 'Our Father which art in Heaven !' To all of u* who have teamed it in our infancy, it oft oalU up the sweetest and the most tender- emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it ! For oenturios, daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. ' lhy lungaom come !' - Has it come 7 Let this Christian city of Glasgow answer — Glasgow, that was to '? Flourish by the preaching of the Word' 'Thy ilingdom com* ' ' Day after day, Sunday after Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone up ; and to-day, in this so- called Christ?* n city of Glasgow, 125,000 human beings — kj your medical officer says— 125,000 children of God are living whole families in a single room. 'Thy Kingdom come!' We have been praying for it arid praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many think it will never - come. Here is the vital point in which what we are acoustonoed to call the Christianity of the present day Jiffers so much from that Christianity which overrau thg ancient world — that C'...i-liiw;!ly which, beneath a rotten old civilization, planfed the seeds of a newer and a higher. We have become accustomed to think that God's king dom is nut intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the devil's world, and that God's kingdom is in some other sphere, to which He is to take rood people wr-on they die. If that be so, what is the use of praying for the coming of thu kingdom? Is God — the Christian's -jo-I, the Almighty, the loving Father\f whom Christ told— is lie buth a luorBter as a god of that kind would be; a god who looks en. this world, sees its sufferiifcs and its miseries, sees high faculties al-orted, lives stunted, innocence timed to vito 'and dime, and heartftrugs strained and broken yet, having it in his power; will not bring that kingdom of peace, ?nd love, and plenty and happiness 1 Is God, indeed, a self-willed despot, whom we must coax to do tbe good He might P But, think of it The Almighty— aud 1 say it with reverence— the Al mighty could not bring that kingdom of Himself, tor, what is the kingdom of God; the kingdom that Christ taught us to pray for? Is it not in the doing of God's will, notby automata, not by animals who are' compelled, but by intelligent beings made in His image, intelligent, beings clothed with free will, intelligent beings knowing good from evil. Swedenborg never said a deeper nor a truer thing, nor a thirty more compatable with the philosophy of Christianity, than when he uid God had never put anyone into hell ; that the devils went to hell be cause they would rather go to bell than go to heaven. The spirits of evil would ' be unhappy in a place where the spirit ; of good reigned ; wedded to injustice, i and loving injustice, they would be ' miserable, were justice was the law. i And correlative^ God could not put - intelligent beings having free will into - conditions were they '«?*- do right, . without destroying that free will. - Nay! Nay! ' Thy Kingdom con?e!' i —when Christ taught tba- prayer, He - meant, not merely that men most idly i phrase these words, bat that tor the I coming of that kingdom they must - *drk as well ?* pray I; -'- « 'Omr Father T WTum\ Not my I Father— that Is not the prayer. 'Oar j Father'- no* Oi«f«^ro««ny sect, of - any «W bat tbslsttsecf all wen. T& AB^ather tfcifeMfWW, the i ? . # ? ' - ? .' ? He is all men's Father — weAn^by our institutions. The All-Fa&er; who made tbe world, tke Alt-Father who created man in his image, anoT put him upon the'earth to draw his subsistence from it* bosom; to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy his wants, waiting only to be worked Vp Ivy his labour! If He is the All-Father, then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally en titled to the use of His bounty 3 And, yet, our laws say that this, God's earth is not here for the use of all His children, but only for the use of a privi leged few ! There was a little dialogue published in the United Sta^M^n the west, some time ago. iPosaibM you may have seen it. It is betwMn a ooy ana niu lamer, wuen vnusg -» brick -yard. The boy looks at tHmen making brick*, and he 'askjA^se those dirty men are, why H^Jftre making up the clay, and what t^Kre doing it for. He learns, and t^Bhe asks about the owner of thet^Kk yard. ' He does not make any'^Ks ; he gets his income from lettq^Hihe other men make bricks.' T^Ue boy asks about what title thei^Hto the bricks, -and is 'told that it ^^^9 from the men having made -^^P» Then he wants to know how theVnn who owns the brick -yard geti hial^ I to the brick-yard — whether he made it A I' No, he did not make it,' the,father' replies. ' God made it.' The boy siks, ' Did God make it for him V Whereat his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but tib|L anyhow it is alright,- and it. is sJfkflt accordance with God's law. |Th,-^^H boy, who of course is a Sunda'.ed .-^H boy, and had been to church, ,'cifCW^H mumbling to himself that God jt ^hflpfl the world that he gave His o'^ ?$? gotten Son to die for all meriC°WB that be ao loved the owner of then***! yard that he gave him not merelj ^I only begotten Son, but tbe brick\\*^jjj too. ,J| This has a blasphemous sountij^^H I do not refer to it lightly Idojfij^^M to speak lightly of sacred subjtjj[^^^| it' is well sometimes that W$^^^^H fairly shocked into thinkjaji^^^^H t-f wftm tft tftflamiy ,te*gfa|^^^^M of the life and death of Jn^^^H to die for men! Think O^iH^^^^H ings, that we are all the equT^^^H of an Almighty Father, who inj^H specter of persons, and then tht^^H this legalised injustice— -t-hjs.- deniuH the most important, most fundaraenJH rights of the children of God, whiclMfl many of the very men who teach Christianity nphold ; nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of the Creator himself. Better to me, higher to me ii tho Atheist, 'who sayw'there is no God, than the professed Christian, who, prating of the goodness and the Father hood ot- God, te!U us in words as some do, or tells us indirectly as others do, that millions and millions of human creatures [at this point a child was beard cryingL=-don't take the little thing out — that millions and millions of human beings, like that little baby, are being brought into the world daily by the creative fiat, and no place in this world provided for them. Aye ! tells u* that by the laws of God, the poor are created in order that the rich may -have the unctuous satisfaction of dealing out charity to them — tells us that a state of things like that which exists in this oity of Glasgow, as in other great cities on both sides of tbe Atlantic, where little ohildren are lyiuy every day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because, having come into the world — those children of God, irith His fiat, by 'His decree — they ind that there is not space ( on the jarth sufficient for them to live ; and ire driven out of God's world because they cannot get room enough, cannot pi air enough, Annot get sustenance MMNtfh. I, Imbve in no such god. U I did, thMgh I might bend before lUm in fear, I would hate him in my Mart fot room, enough for the little MWlTO. -howl - IiOOk around any Sfc* toAodviltod world ; is thtt* Ntti* «ottfa jtad to spars t Not SSSsyw* « ^ '^ ?oros.loflk through every oouhtry aod see natural opportunities going to waste. Aye! that Christianity that puts on the Creator the evil, the injustice, the suffering and tbe degradation that are due to man's injustice, is worse, far worse, than Atheism. That is the blasphemy, and if there be a sin against the Holy Ghost,, that U the unpardon airfe»\n! n (To be 'concluded in our next).
