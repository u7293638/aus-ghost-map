After many days' sitting bythe vtihdow where Clifdeiibafl eatlookibg out on the future, "Andyonknowall, Margaret?" " You toldme the Story times and again in your delirium," she q^id to the woraface—so much note wont than herown, worn as it had been with watctri mat do r " Meaning by' they* the Commerflit sett If you^mean that party, I don't bnow.^ If to make me inquire, it is not^If^you think I'd ask one of them to-morrow one breath of a question about the reports that are going, you're, mistaken — 'teht!" ' Miss Bertram snapped her fingers wifchan air of utter con tempt, and further enforced it by making a face. It might have heeri the wintry evening that came in, carrying with it a poor, haggard ghost bf the old sunsets, and casting it upon, her as she looked trat, being with its thin, dreary colour, the wreck of the deep golden light that used to lie on the town before the atmosphere of smoke had despoiled it. This resting on her fragile face and figure—sunset and face and figure like two wrecks of the past—worked some softening, impulsive in fluence on Miss Bertram, who took the op portunity of again saying, " And if they do say anything, those dow agers below, concerning yon, Marie, as sure as my name is what it is, I -shall ten them a piece of my mind. They have heard that once before., Don't look so aid: yon are too weak yet Our lives am all before us, Marie. I don't like you like that If yon give way you'll d—die, after all my trouble." The tears were in her eyes as she took her friend's hand to caress it—as the caressed hand bad caressed the hand of a Titan, com pared to it, but a couple of months ago. "Here's the doctor." Doctor Kellett came in with bis familiar air and took a seat "Miss Bertram, I have to thank you, on my own behalf, and on behalf of my child Marie there, tor the cure that has been effected — mainly, my dear, through your instrumentality. Marie, there, weald be wanting in gratitude to you if she did not bear up and get well as Boon as possible. There not being anything to hinder her from getting well, she owes you this con sideration, and she will fulfil it Her first cam towards fulfilling this duty, Miss Ber tram, is that there must be no brooding or thinking, and no visitors. I expressly forbid it: thatis my prescription. You hear that* Marie?" From out the dreary light still on her hair and face, "Yes, doctor, as far as I ran—believe me, as little as possible. Margaret, -boW-gpod yoa-terebeen. • The doctor drew his chair closer to the two ladies. "Marie, I have something to say to you Sit stall, Miss Bertram; the fever has tol you as much as it has 'told me; and that your advice with mine will be derisive 1 most sincerely hope. My child, the oldesl friend 1 had in Commerflit was your mother There were times, long ago, when we bott needed help and advice, and we found it in each other. There was a rime, long ago; when in the loneliness of the life I had and in the admiration I felt for Mrs. Denton, I asked her to become my wife, that I might be a companion and protector to her, and i guardian to the little girl whom I have evei aihce "regarded as my child. Your mothei told me her history, without keeping back as I firmly believe, one sad detail. Myowi life, my dears, had been a sorrowful one ai well aa hers, so the feeling I had gave plao to a friendship that was precious and con soling to me. as 1 fondly hope it was to her The issues of life and death are not in ou hands, and I sorrowed in my own lonely wa; as much as you did, my dear, in yours. Not there is an emptiness in my life again, and i you' will come to the rid man's hearth, am fill his home with a daughter's presence, yoi will be always to me what you would hav been under the other circumstances. Yo want a father, Maris, and a guardian in Com merflit society." The gratitude that was in her face and tb sunlight with it seemed n> mingle into a brigh acknowledgement "Oh, doctor, I thought the world was sel fish; you are not of it" i " Bu$ I am of it and the world is selSsl and I am the most selfish curmudgeon ii Commerflit I'm a Gorgon of selfishnes dpar, and ashamed of myself—ashome enough tohang my head down and not look an young man In the face. Wait till you se how Til lode you up, and look at you, an keep yon with me, miss. You'U have ■ chance, for I'll drive you out with me an drive you in with me.
