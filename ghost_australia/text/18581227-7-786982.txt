The Prorogation of Paeliaj√≠ent.-Not-j withstanding the unfavorable weather on Friday,] a very large number of citizens assembled at the Houses of Legislature, for the purpose of witnessing the ceremony of proroguing Parliament. His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief had intimated that he should attend the Council Chamber at one o'clock, and precisely at that hour His Excellency arrived. A detachment of military and police had been stationed outside of the building, and presented arms to the representative of royalty. No cannon announced the arrival of His Excellency ; there was an attempt to " sound the loud trumpet," but the instrument was, apparently, labouring under a severe attack of influenza, and after a solitary feeble effort, I gave up the ghost. To alone, however, for these i deficiencies, " loud roared the dreadful thunder," the lightning danced in all directions, and the rain fell in torrents. His Excellency was received by the Hon. the President and members of the Legislative Council, and escorted to the interior of the Council Chamber, where the usual ceremony was gone through. His Excellency re- quested the attendance of the members of the House of Assembly, and upon their arrival Mr. Speaker presented his little Bill-the Appropriation Act which was settled without a murmur, and then followed twenty-two public and two private Bills, which had been passed during the session, to which His Excellency was also pleased to give his assent in the name and on behalf of the Queen. His Excellency's address proroguing Parliament till 1st of April next, will be found in our Parliamentary report.
