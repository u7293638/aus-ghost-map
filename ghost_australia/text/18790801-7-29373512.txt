CATHOLIC EDUCATION. The pastoral letter of Archbishop Vaughan and the Bishops exercising jurisdiction in New South Wales was read in the Catholic churches throughout the colony on Sunday, July 87. The document is a very long one, and we make the following extracts:— *' To our Dearly Beloved Brethren and Children in Christ, tte Clergy, Secular and Regular, and the Faithful under our Jurisdiction. " Health and Benediction in the Lord Jesus Christ—Having been convinced by many signs from many quarters tfaat existing dangers to Catholic education are steadily increasing, so as to become absolute perils to religion, and that unfairness to Catholics is developing into abso lute injustice, we, the Archbishop and Bishops having jurisdiction in New -South Wales, who are responsible to God for the souls of parents and children confided to our care, deemed it oor duty to meet and take counsel together regard ing tfae present condition cf affairs, so thst we might then, by tte authority of our united voice,instruct,warn,aad directyouas to your position and your duties with regard to the edueaticn of Catholic children. "The erection of costly public sohools in every direction, which is continually going on; the steady, systematic way in which our denomi national schools are bring weakened and extin guished ; tfae treatment of Catholics at Band wick and tfae Benevolent Asylum; tbe prospect of secularist grammar schools springing np at the public expense in Maitland, Goulbum, and Batturst; of a secularist high school for girls being established in Sydney, and partially en dowed by tte Government; of £1,600 a-year being spent for five years on the education at grammar schools of boys exclusively from public schools; ttb lavish expenditureofpublic inoney on one section of tte community, to the exclusion of others wbo cannot in conscience avail themselves of it, is in a free community like our own, where all are equally taxed, a species of injustice whicb cannot be submitted to in silence. "And more than this. This expenditure on godless education, this studding tbe colony with schools which the Ohureh knows from ex perience will, in course of time, fill the country with indiffereatists, not to speak of absolute infidels; this use of Catholic funds—of taxes paid out of Catholic pockets—for establishing a system of education throughout tts land, which not merely Catholics cannot aafely make use of, but which ttey firmly beUeve is calculated to sap tte foundations of Christianity, is an act so galling to every feeling of fair play that wa do not see bow any free man witt any spirit in him can allow it to pass unchallenged. "Not merely as Msfaoje of tte Catholic Churcfa, but as citizens of a free country which boasts that even- handed justioe is dealt out to all its taxpayers, we emphatically lay claim to our share of that aame even-handed justice; and we believe it to be fhe duty of the Catholic body not to rest until tbey bave been plaoed on an equal footing witt their fellow-colonists. We, Oattelica, wbo represent one-third of tte population, do not ask for cr seek one jot or tittle more eondderation than our fellow-tax payers receive; and we do not see why we should be content witt one jot or tittle less. "Let it be borne in mind that this is dis tinctly a religious question. Witt polities, as saeh, it was never eur taste to meddle. We prefer to do our work in peaoe, and avoid tfae tke alone, but tbe future of religion itself, is contention at rivd parties. But when not Jun es* fin tislly bound up with a certain position; when tiw question of education is in point of fact the great religious question at the day; we sfaonld be prevaricating against our bounden duty, and ahould prove ourselves unfitted for our trust, were we to bold our peace, did we not at the present juncture set forth the teach ing of the Church with great distinctness, and point out to you, dearly beloved, with unmis takable clearness your duties as interpreted by that teaching." The pastoral letter then sets forth the funda mental principles and doctrines of tbe Ohureh as taught by Christ; renews the efforts of paganism "to civilise tbe heart, instruct tiie conscience, and direct the will," which are pro nonnoed to have been failures ; and it is main tained that on the teachings of Christianity "all civilisation and legislation, all morality, public, social, and privaie are founded." The letter continues:— "Now we are bound both by the natural and the revealed law to educate children in the know ledge of God, in His love, aad in His command ments. As Christians we ara bound to educate them in the full revelation of Jesus Christ, and to procure for them those blessings aad gifti which tbe Christian Church alone faas the power to bestow. By Aaa law of nature parents are bound to train tiieir children, and by the law of Christianity the Church is bound to see thai parents do their dnty. Aad whilst father and mother, on the one hand, ara obliged, under strict obligation, thus to rear their child—__ from the dawning of tiieir reason, the Church is bound, on the other hand, to complete tbe work which the parents have begun. 'Go ye therefore and teach' (or make disciples of) 'all nations, baptising them in the name of tfaa Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatever I faave commanded you,' ia faer commission. Here the duty is imposed upon faer, and she receives ihe necessary gifts and powers. Thus both parents and the Church inculcate the aame class of teaching; they are in perfect harmony; the education of the child at its mother'- knee is not undone in tbe Christian schools, but de veloped and completed. Through tbe whole period the graces and influences ef Christianity are operating ontfae inner Ufe cf tiie Christian child; the heart, the c__MCJ__oe, and the arill, are being moulded for life; and the entire being, body, soul, and senses, the complete per sonality beoomes saturated by a _vi_aa__L of which Christianity alone can be the origin. ** Thus it is self-evident tfaat education with out Christianity is impossible-, you may call it instruction, filling tiie mind with a certain quantity of secular knowledge, but you cannot dignify it with tbe same education; for religion is an essential part of education; and to divorce religion or Christianity from education is to return to paganism, and to reject the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus it is that the Church con demns, with marked emphasis, those schools and tbat method of tffring in which the religious element is divorced from _ie secular. She knows that instruction is not education, and tiiat a system of national training from which Christianity is banished is a system of practical paganism, which leads to corruption of morals and loss of faith, national effeminacy, and to national dishonor. "It is not, therefore, surprising that Pope Fins IX. shonld have issued the following weighty instruction, which our Catholic people and our Protestant statesmen would do well to ponder on. In it tiiey will find no new doc trine, but the old tearhftig of the Church, which springs from immovable principles of religion. ' Tbe greatest injury is inflicted on sodety,' says the supreme Pontiff, 'when the directing and salutary power of tbe Church is withdrawn from public aud private education on which the happiness of tbe Church and of the common wealth depends so mnch. For thus society is little by little deprived of thst truly Christian spirit wbich alone ean permanently secure the foundation of peace and public order, and promote and direot the true and useful progress of civilisation, and give man those helps which are necessary for bim iu order to attain after this life his last end. And in truth a system of teaching which not only is limited to the knowledge of natural things, and does not pass beyond the bounds of onr life on earth, but also dtparts from the truth revealed by God, must necessarily be guided by the spirit of error and untruth; and education which, without the aid cf Christian doctrine, and of its salutary moral precepts, instructs the mind and moulds tbe tender heart of youth, which is so prone to evil, must infallibly produce a generation which will have ne guide but its own wicked passions and wild conceits, and wbich will be a source of greatest misfortunes to the commonwealth and tleirown families. Who does not see that the ssme system will give rise to still greater evils if itbeintrodueedinto theprimary schools. Those who pretend that the Church ought to abdicate or suspend her control and her salutary action npon tho primary schools, in reality ask her to disobey the commands of her Divine 'Author, aed to be false to tiie charge she received from God of guiding all men to salvation; and in whatever country this pernicious design of re moving the schools from ecclesiastical authority ahould be entertained and carried into execu tion, and tiie young thereby exposed to the danger of losing their faith, there the Church would be in duty bound not only to use ber best efforts and to employ every means to secure for tbem tiie necessary Christian education and instruction, but moreover would feel herself obliged te worn oil the faithful, and to declare that no one can in conscience frequent such schools as being adverse to tbe Oa_b__sC__rch. After quoting from a Pastoral Letter of the English Bishops, the present one proceeds:— "Sncb, then, being the emphatic teaching of the Catholic Church, we, the Archbishop and Bishops of this colony, with all tiie weight of our authority, condemn the principle of secularist education, and those schoob whkh are founded on that principle. We condemn them, firstly, because they contravene tiie first prin ciples of the Christian religion: and, secondly, because they are seedplots of future immorality, infidelity, and lawlessness, being calculated to debtee ttie standard of human excellence, and to corrupt the political, social, nnd individual life of future citizens. Wherefore we urge our clergy to do all in tiieir power, in the pulpit and out of it, to instruct the people iu these teachings of the Christian religion. They should uot rest till each member of their congregation fully realises the true position of affairs. They should [ bring before the minds of parents the terrible I calamity to their children in exposing them to lots of faith and morals, aad endeavor ta make | them feel that they could not do a greater ser vice to religion or to the State than to upset, by constitutional means, a system which, whilst it is a crying injustice to themselves, promises to be a source of incalculable evil to the colony. Let them, moreover, warn parents, who, tbroagh a spirit of indifference or worldliness, are ex posing their children to proximate danger of perversion and of ruin, that they are tempting the anger of Almighty God; and that they are jeopardizing the faith, tbe morality, the eternal happiness of those who are too young to help themselves, and wfao have been confided by nature itself to their guardianship and protection. Let them often remind the people tiiat tbey are gravely respon sible if they give encouragement to such schools, f__by so doing, tiiey are helping to perpetuate a great evil, and are standing as ob stacles in tbe way of Christian men wfao are bent on bringing about a change. Let one and all remember what their fathers of old suffered -fcc tbe faith, and let tbem not show themselves unworthy of thdr own flesh and blood—flash which was freely wounded, aad blood which was freely spilt, rather than betray Christian principle or compromise Christian faith. ** We are profoundly consoious that a latent cense of fair play exists in the community at large. Let all Catholics unite in bringing before the minds of thdr fellow-electors, and thdr re presentatives in Parliament, these two facts— first, tfaat Catholics faave to pay for schools which they cannot safely use, and whicb tiiey consider an evil to the oountry; and,secondly, that whilst they are thus made to pay, no equal provision bas been made for them. Let the country fully comprehend our grievances, and a sense of f""". <*n,"-l"'F''fofl justice will assist ns in working out a remedy. Would secularists hold thdr peace, if, without equal provision being made for them, public treasure wore lavished oa Catholic Grammar Schools, and Catholic Primary Schools, whilst £7,500 were spent on tbe training of boy. axelndvaly from Catholic institutions? Would tbey not bold that tiiey were beingtreated with extraordinary injustice and unfairness? And would not the whole world agree with them? "Tbe State may declare, and statesmen may teach, that the secularist system is aot adverse to Christianity and to the Catholic religion. But, in matters of religion, are Catholics to be gi__edbythewcrldorby theOhnrch? Does not the Churcfa know her own true interests best? Has not she had experience of centuries, in point of time ; and all over thewudd, ia point of space ? Are not her put eased opponents on the side of secularist education, and do not her best friends range themselves npon the Christian side? And to come to facts, has the secuUrist system,— far as it has gone, fostered and de veloped a Christian spirit? Has not the Catholic Episcopate/— various quarters of tbe world, found tfaat its direct tendency is to quench euch a spirit? What is our own expe rience and that of the Catholic clergy in thia olony ? To their shame, it must be aaid, some _ f our people do send tbeir children to public schools.

"What is the preeent podtion of affairs? Catholics are paying for tbe support of *-^**-w which they can ndther approve of nor make use of, whilst no anakgons provision has beea made for them. We may be met with the cry of ttie ' religious difficulty.' We admit tfae «Bgto«M difficulty; but that difficulty is aggravate-, not edved or mitigated, by acts of exteaocdinarf unfairness to a large section of tfae eommunhty. The'religious difficulty* exists in _-___d,a_d _tfc_U___orein__nglw_. Bat whilst tfae o_t____ of Ireland are receiving a larger share of justioe as days go by, tbe Ostfaolicsof this colony ace receiving a leas and lesa share ef justice. Whilst tfae small Catholic minority in Bngland is rejoicing, witfa regard to edoeation, in even handed justice, we, here, are retrograding, and are aggravating timt onesidedneas aad unfair ness from which the broad spirit of a growiag liberality has set Protestant Bngland fines. 1 Why dionld the mother country hold a mono poly of even-handedneas? Why ahould not we walk in the broad footpath of faer le_p___on on this question, and learn from her great states men how to edve the 'religious di____y' |_ the British pan___ of fair play? And bom can this principle of fair play be applied? Tbe answer is simple. Introduce payment by re sults in place of the present unjust and galling system. According to tbis method, whilst no creed is subsidised, each section of tiie an. munitv receives equd assistance with the other, according to ascertained results (by Govern ment inspection) of secular teaching. Thus the common funds are made use of far what ail admit to be a common good. Thus no one eaat complain. Tfae secularist sect, indeed, wonld be deprived of a monopoly; but then a wide spread irritation springing from a crnd wrong would give way to happiness and peace through out tbe colony. Neither Catholic nor Pro testant would be called npon to support needs which they condemn, nor would large annud grants of money be lavi_ed'npon one tertian of tiie community to the exclusion cf another. There would be one law of fair play and no favoring for all. Those wbo were-equally taxed would be equally treated. Is not this * Iroad and intelligible platform, upon which everv just and honest man wonld naturally toka his stand ? If there be a widespread sense of justice in the land, as we firmly believe there is, is there not some power amongst ns timt wi? rouse it into action? Let Cathofies rouse tbemsdvee up to a sense of tbdr respcnsnb?itiee; let tbem bring legitimate pressure to bear—fto right quarter; and never cease in ftdx per severing thdr organised importamity nntil they have obtained those rights which no man can refuse them without self-evident injustice. ? Dearly bdoved, 'Watch ye, stand fast ia fta fdth, do manfully, and be strengthened.' * Keep tiw unity of the spirit in fte bond of peace; one body, one Spirit, as you are called in one bope of yonr calling; one Lord, one fdth, one bap tinn; one God and Father of alt, who is abov* all, and through all, and in us all.
