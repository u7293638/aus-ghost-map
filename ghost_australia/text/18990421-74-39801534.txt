SEQUEL TO A GHOST STORY. As a venerable minister tells this story, it would be ungracious and superfluous to adduce further evidence of its truthfulness. "I went to a new parish that year," he relates. "In looking about for a house I came upon a very handsome residence that was charmingly situated. But everything indicated that the place had long been without a tenant, ano I made enquiry. The house was haunted, according to neighbourhood tradition, and no one would rent it. I saw the landlord, and he was glad to let the place on easy terms. It would be worth much to him if I would exorcise the ghost placed there by popular superstition. We moved in, and I admit that we had a very creepy experience-one that my wife could not long have endured. When everything had settled down to the quiet.of the night we would fre quently hear the most distressing moans and the sound an of someone walking heavily in the attic. I made several visits to that gloomy part of the house, but could find nothing to account for the uncanny noise. The next night that we were disturbed I went up there with a determination - to fathom the mystery. And I did it. The moans were produced by the soughing of the wind through the dis trict telegraph wires that were numer ous on one side of the roof. The 'heavy walking' was accounted for by a loose slate, flapped by the same winds that did the moaning. Next morning I had the wires removed and the roof repaired." "And that was l Nnt quite. The 'landlord at once advanced my rent one hundred per cent." The total value of fish landed on the English and Welsh coasts during 1898 amounted to Â£6,123,744, an in crease of nearly a quarter of a million over the total for the preceding year.
