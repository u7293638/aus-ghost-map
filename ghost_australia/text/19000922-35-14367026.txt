TO THIS EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-The Very Rev. Father Le Rennetel, in his paper read at the U.C. Congress last week, stated that the teaching of the Catholic Church is that .' error has a right to tolerance," and that in a Catholic community " there is no room for persecu- tion or oppression , citizens can have the same civil rights and claim to have their views respected and tolerated ; all can live at peace with their neighbours without allowing the blast of bigotry to destroy that happy union which ought to exist between the children of the common Father." If so, the Archbishop of Wellington, Dr Redwood, was an unhappy selection as the preacher of the official sermon at the dedication of St Mary's, for there had been no provocation to call forth the " blast of bigotry " which Father Le Rennetel very properly condemns , indeed, the words which have set at nought the rights and claims of others " to have their views respected and talented " were calmly and deliberately written by Dr. Redwood before he left Wellington. It is difficult, however, to believe that an eminent prelate could, from mere wanton areas, have set himself to make such an indictment as his printed sermon contained, or that he could have been ignorant of the teaching of his Church on the subject of toleration Indeed, in the press notices of the leading prelates present at the congress, Dr. Redwood is described as " the theologian, the contro- versialist, the men adjuster of fine points of doctrine. His manner is more that of a cool and restrained Englishman than of the warm, impulsive Irishman." It must therefore be concluded that in using the words reported, and intended to be read, Dr. Reid w cool, acting under a strong sense of duty, wished to clearly set forth the teaching of his Church, and the principles his wished his co-religionists in this colony to imbibe, in reference to Protestantism and Protestants, and Catholics are more likely to take their theology from Archbishop Redwood, the theologian and nice adjuster of fine points of doctrine," than from Father Le Rennetel, the courteous French- man and kind-hearted parish priest Moreover, the late Pope Pius IX. laid it down as a basic principle in the allocation of September 1841, " that the Catholic religion, with all its votes, ought to be exclusively dominant in such sort that every other worship shall be banished und interdicted." The Archbishop is also backed up by Cardinal Moran, who, with characteristic, if not elegant, levity, chuckles over the way his brother prelate has made the critics " roar," and expresses no regret that his Protestant fellow citizens, particularly his distinguished guests, whom be invited to add eclat to the festivities of his Cathedral opening, have been told that their Church 19 of purely human origin that their ministers are not divinely called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and are without the ministry of the Holy Ghost that the leaders of the Reformation were men notorious for their vices that Protestantism " has ever been the helper and instrument of the worst foes of Christianity " that " it has desecrated the home and polluted the nuptial be " It is not difficult to guess the meaning of Dr Redwood in the last-mentioned phrase when it is remembered that according to Roman Catholic theology matrimony is a sacrament, and, of course, only the priests of Rome have any authority to administer the sacraments of the Church of Jesus Christ Colour is given to this interpretation in the denominational organ which claims to be the leading Catholic paper in Australia Is it any wonder, then, that there is 11 widespread feeling of indignation at the publication of such sentiments as Archbishop Redwood has given forth to the world a Then, having instituted a comparison between Protestantism, which he branded as born of -vicious parentage, productive of domestic immorality and opposed to civilisation and Christianity, and Roman Catholicism, which, he claimed, possessed exclusively the marks an 1 prerogatives of the true Church, the preacher rose delightfully to a grandiloquent climax thus - ' How different is the true bride of Christ, how beautiful, how stately and majestic in her seam- less payment of unity, ho' snowy, jewelled gesture of sanctity, her Imperial mantle of catholicity, and her long flowing robe of apostolical " But what are the facts. The Encyclopaedia Britannica (art " The Reformation "), referring to the three years sought to be, obtained by the Reformation, says " Of these three distinct conceptions the first, taking its rise in the generally admitted corrupt practice of the Church of Rome, aimed at little more than a restoration of discipline-a reform of morals, that is to say, amongst the clergy and the monastic orders, and the abolition of those various abuses which had grown up under the lax administration and baneful example!.' of successive Popes and of the Curia of the widespread necessity for such reform as shown by the condition of the clergy and the monasteries, tim remarkable treaty" by Nicholas de Clemenges ' De Corruuto Ecclesia) Statu,' affords alone such clear evidence and it is striking proof of the deep-rooted corruption of the whole Church that such flagrant abuses should have continued to exist for another century with little or no abatement Cle- menges deplores the pride and rapacity of the car- dinals, their in morality und addiction to simony, the prevalence of the same vices among the episcopal order, the lower clergy in general so sunk in vice and saith that scarcely one in a thousand was to be found living a godly and sober life ; the nunneries, which be declares were brothers rather than sanctuaries A few years later we find the evils to which Clements called attention emphasised by one of the most eminent ecclesiastics of the age, the Cardinal Julian Cesarim " Such was the condition of " the stately and majestic" Romish Church " in her seamless garment of unity and her snowy jewelled gesture of sanctity " in the sixteenth century Of course, matters have improved considerably since then , but even in this, the last year of the nineteenth century there is still much to be desired Father Fitzgerald, O.F al, in his paper on " The Catholic Press, How to Promote Its referred to the "Contemporary Re- view " h one of the leading magazines of the pre -\ v lent day deserving of attention and respect. Now, such a reference is decidedly opportune, for in that issues of March and April last there appear two articles on " Monastic Orders up-to-date," in which there are startling revelations forming the most serious indictment the Romish Church of modern days has been called upon to answer " The fetish ism of contemporary Catholicism, ' almost worse than " the paganism of ancient Greece and Rome, or the galvanised Heathenism of Julian in the more than questionable methods for increasing the revenues of the Church, the matins and tincture of orphan children in the workhouses connected with the convener of france these and many more things quite as bad and even worse are not only plainly and train standstill Hated, but the proofs of them are offered. As Dr Redwood has felt it his duty to extol the Church of Rome at the expense of much flowery rhetoric, but with an unwonted economy of fact, it is well that both medieval and modern history should be allowed to throw a little light on the subject, in order that a correct judgment may be formed as to whether or not there is a striking resemblance be- twioujtho teaching and practice of the Church of Jesus Christ in the days of the Apostles and those of the Roman Church of later days But objectionable as it may be to Protestants to have their forefathers, their faith, and the family institution assailed and libelled, it is utmost past endurance that the kind of thing should be done under vice-regal patronage The managers of the congress cannot be blamed for seeking in any and every quarter the presence of persons of high degree to add to the pageantry in which Roman Catholicism is went to indulge, but when the Governor, attired in Windsor uniform, attends at the " sacrifice of-. the mass " in his official capacity as the representative of her Majesty then it is quite time to utter a respectful but emphatic protest against such a procedure j hat his Excellency did so attend is by road question. There has been no contradiction of the statement. On the contrary, Cardinal Moran is reported to have said at the luncheon at the conclusion of the Sunday morning service " They were also deeply indebted to the representative of her Majesty for his presence amongst them (Loud applause When he had the honour to invite his Excellency to be united with them in this solemn celebration his Excellency not only expressed his readiness to come, but notified that he would corns in uniform, thus showing that he came as the representative of her Majesty (Lou I Applause.)" It may seem somewhat ungracious to reflect upon one whose position precludes him from public controversy , but, on the other hand, it is conceivable that cases may arise when such a pre- clusion is a distinct advantage. Anyhow, vice royalty can claim no immunity from fair and courteous criticism when it acts in such a way as to deserve it. It is much to be regretted that on the eve of his departure from our midst his Excellency should have so deeply wounded so large a number of the most devoted subjects of his Royal mistress and our Protestant Sovereign.
