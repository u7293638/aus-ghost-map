THE CONDITION AND FUTURE ENGLISH JUDAISM. ' This subject has been dealt with by a Jew in the "Jewish Quarterly Review." He concludes that English Judaism "is an immense chaos of opinions; wo do not know whore we are," and ho himself sooms to be of opinion that "the eternal spirit of man toils in pursuit of over-rece'ding horiaons of truth: and morality." Of Judaism generally ho writes that " the plutociacy is ennobled and goes over to Christianity, most frequently to, the Catholic form of it: the educated are chiefly agnostics, and ato not even inspired by that hollow ghost of racial unity which is born of interest in ono another's births, marriages, and deaths ; in Austria the Jewish teachers have openly brokon with Judaism ; in Australia Judaism is an antumic invalid ; in America, even more than in Germany, the boldest, the most liberal,tho purest doctrines of natural religion are preached by salaried Jewish ministers." " Yes, both Biblical and Rabbinical Judaism soem to have had their day. Tho cloak that could not bo torn off by the tempest of Christianity and persecution bids fair to bo thrown off under tho sunshine: of rationalism and tolerance." Such ir, the testimony of a Jew writing for Jowb, and we encounter many of liko purport. It is a day in which we ought indeed to pray for tho evangelisation of " Israol after tho flesh." Nor ought wc to content ourselves until wo have.coupled effort with our prayors. Let it never boforgotten that socially,commercially, and through tho Press, the Jews are exciting unconscious but very sensible influence upon English thought and character. The cold chill hand of their infidelity will freeze the. warmth of our English profession of Christianity.â€”" Rock."
