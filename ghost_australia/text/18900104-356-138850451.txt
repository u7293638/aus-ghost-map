Capture of a Graveyard " Ghost." Foa some weeks past the inhabitants of Oek. brook, in Derbyshire, have been alarmed by the appearance nightly of a "'ghost" at. lonely spots. The apparition was recently seen walking among tombstones in the churchyard. The head and shoulders wereo covered with a light-blue "cloud," and, after examining several stones, the figure stood with folded arms, and then darted among some trees. One of the inhabitants, more daring than the rest, obtained the as sistance of a policeman, and they succeeded in capturing the supposed ghost, who proved to be a young woman living in the village. She pretended to have been looking for the grave of her father, who had been dead nine years.
