THE HOOP SNAKE. Tho following question, Bays a correspondent of tho Scientific American, is still being asked : "Is there such a thing as a hoop snake, and has anvbodv over seen one, or a specimen of one?" The way the hoop snake is said to move about is thus : It tukos its tail in its mouth, coils itself in nn ellipse, and moves uronnd like a hoop. There nro many persons who uphold the oxistoneo of tho hoop snako, yet all reports and declarations that havo been advanced in its favour have all proved to bo totally unreliable. Tho anatomy of a snake alone is sufficient to prove that hoop like progression is impossible. The hoop snako has never been described hy any naturalist in anj standard work on reptiles, and no museum nor collection in the world contain! a specimen of it. It exists only in tho minds of the ignorant and nnscientifio, and it must bo classed with ghosts, mermaids, winged snakes, s9a serpents, and fi-hhooked- 1 ailed fishing snakee.
