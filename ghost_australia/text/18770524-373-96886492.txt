LARKIKINISM. TO THE EDITOR. ' This town is troubled with unruly boys.'— Shakespeare. Sir — The main topic of conversation has lately been 'the ghost,' and sundry peisons have been terrified out of their wits (if they ever had any) by the prospect of an encounter with a supernatural visitor. Credulity has been rampant, and exaggeration has been rife. I have been gravely informed that ?* the ghost' went into one woman's borne and 'beat her shamefully,' and that on another occasion this agreeable visitant, being, I suppose, amorously in clined, went into a person's house, ' kisted her, and frightened her dreadfully.' I took the trouble to enquire into the troth of these two rumours, and, as I expected, found them devoid of truth. That there is, however, some scamp prowling about the i own ship, and playing upon the credulity of the female part of our community is beyond dispute. That with this past me is mixed a sp'ce of petty larceuy is also evident, fjom the fact that half of a sheep has been ?? lifted' from one resident, and come articles ab stracted from the premises of another. There is an element of materialism about these la'ter practices which is not consonant with the idea of a super natural visitant. Ghosts do not usually indulge in a penchant for fat mutton or ornamental table-cloths. My own opinion is that some one, or more, of the genus larrikin are playing their pranks with the double purpose of frightening the timid, and of pick ing up any ' unconsidered trifles' which may be within the reach of their thievish fingers. I would advise my fair towuswomen not to be alarmed by aDy idea of ?' ghostesses,' but to try the virtues of a good broomstick upon any suspicious object prowl ing about their premises after nightfall. I fancy snch a determined mode of action would soon put an end toAhe^rankaof master *M5bost.:t L * I am, &c;, COMMON SENSE. StrathiUbyu, May 22.
