CARTAGENA. THE special correspondent of the Times, under date Cartagena, September 21, willes as follows I My friend, Mr Cruz, the English Consul's Secretary, was so good as to explain to the Junta that nothing but an imperfect acquaint once, lory pardonable in a foreigner, however accomplished, with the meeting of the English language could have made any one suppose that I had been writing in their disparagement Thereupon the Canton Miliciano very courts ously gave publicity to the conviction, and than tod me for the support I had given the Junto So the little misunderstanding between us is, to my great satisfaction, at an end, and I find myself again to Cartagena If, in the first moments of bitterness at my expulsion, I allowed myself to be betrayed into any expressions which in the light of this pleasing reconciliation may appear hostile 01 harsh, I basion to withdraw them, and gladly pledge myself to v. rite of the Cartagena authorities and then doings in the same tone us that for which they have been so obliging as to thank me I find the place a good deal changed even during my short absence I should not have thought that its aspect could possibly have become drearier, but such nevertheless is the CEO of the foreign merchantmen which were towed out of the harbor when the pi eat " Battl i of Lseouibrera" was considered imminent, only two have returned, and Those, even with the assistance of the French man of war Board, the Mendez Nunez, and the Tetuan, make a pool show in the spacious and handsome roadstead, making its emptiness only the more painfully noticeable Besides, when I left, although the harbor! gate of the town was nominally closed to all but a privileged few, as a matter of fact a host of people used somehow to squeeze through, boatmen looking after chance passengers to Escombrera, and market woman with fish and fruit waiting for the crews of the foreign merchantmen and of the American and Italian men of war it was not in female nature that the housewives of Car angels should allow any number of Juntos or Volun teers their own Volunteers forsooth-bnyonels notwithstanding, to come between them and the chance of a bargain conducted on the soundest principles of vehemently hostile, jet amicable discussion, to say nothing of the 10 motor chance of a platonic flirtation with the foreign crows Hence the quay, up to almost the moment of my departure, was for a brief hour or two in the morning the one In ely spot left in Cartagena-an case of cheerfulness in. a desert of dulness and as one passed along it to take one's motoring swim, and drown in the fresh spray bitter memories of hot nights and hungry mosquitoes, it was possible to forget that the town was in a state of siege, with no trace left of two thirds of its population but closed Shutters and bolted doors This morning, however, when I went for my bathe, I found that even this last ray of cheerfulness had [ lamshed from Cartagena, and that the once lively quay was as dull and deserted as any spot inside the walls There are no longer foreign crews to attract the market women who attract the housewives It is now really do 111 cult in the extreme. for any Sponioids to get either in or out of the town When the Madrid Government declared the Cailugona port " foul," in order to put a stop to the entry of all merchantmen or mail boots for which quarantine had any ton ors, the Junta retaliated by declaring all Spain outside Cui Ingella and her colonies "foul," and drawing a protecting cordon round the walls. I had fancied This drawing of a cordon an imaginative process, and like the time honored ceremony of shaking the dust off one's shoes, now existing rather in metaphor than in foot But the Ourtagona cordon lina its outward visible symbol two rows of wooden rails, looking somewhat like a narrow cattle pon, between which stalks sternly the guardian sentinel, whose duty it is to keep the gates of our Cartugonmn paradise Shut against a sinful world He is very courteous indeed to foreigners, especially British subjects ; but Spaniards without a special order, very difficult to obtain, try in vain to pass him. Hence the general abandonment of the quay with its once noisy low of stalls, now silent and shut The small boy, an old acquaintance, who opened the doors of the bathing machines for my companion and my self, stared at us as if we had been ghosts improperly lingering on into the highest hours of down, and declared in doleful tones that " no- body ever Dothod now " As we swam about the harbor one of the finest in the world- its loneliness and stillness were quite appalling We were almost afraid to splash about or call to each other, less sounds SO unwonted in the spacious solitude should create a general alarm and draw the fire of the surrounding forts down upon us. Indeed, the harbour has now perils that are not imaginary. It is unsafe to outer or leave it before dawn or after dusk without knowing the watchword The French man of war's boats the other day, rowing out to Escom hero too early in the morning, received a volley from a battery at the mouth of the harbor, and one poor fellow was killed. Two English and dies," who had got leave for a cruise, and who, of course, persuaded themselves that there could be no harm in just baring a near look at the battery, also provoked a policy, which this time, however, luckily missed On the whole, Cartagena from the outside looked so desperately dreary and dull that, if it were not for the ruinous suspension of commerce which is threatening thousands of honest harmless people with starvation, for the pirate cal expeditions of the Intransigent ironclads, for the risk of the insurrectionary movement spreading to other towns, for the bad effect it produces on the credit and reputation of Spain throughout the civilised world if it were not, I say, for these and a few similar, not exactly trivial considerations, I should become quite a convert to the easy Madrid view that the best way of dealing with the Cartagena insurgents is to let them " tire themselves out " they must be dreadfully bored all, that is, but the few leaders who have the pleasure of play ing at Statesmen and Generals, and who got, I presume, what few can forts and pleasures Cartagena may still afford None but a S| rush population could have so long quietly endured so dull a siege Frenchmen would have either amused them selves mandolin wallaby of attempts ations lution, or would at least have thought of that resource outside, not altogether unusual with besieged garrisons sortie The patient Coito germs do not seem to have thought of one or the other until by yesterday, when in their despo lation they hit upon the idea of a portion sortie on a grand scale, like that to Champigny which would show the world that heroic Oaita gone would not, any more than Pans, tamely submit to be taken by famine without drawing blood from her relentless foe Only at Obum pigmy the idea was carried out, and poor General Ducros, cruelly as he 1 us over since been twitted about his famous son never to return to Paris defeated and who, really did his utmost to conquer or be killed I did not myself see yesterday's sortie, na I came into town just too late, but I am told that the Cirtageman force barely allowed itself to get within range of the besiegers' finis they went out hardly enough, about 2000 strong, including 300 chosen convicts, and were probably be astonished at finding themselves outside the walls that they may have thought General Martinez C impels' men would be equally as tonished and ran away Had they run away, there is no doubt that the Cartageniina would have folio need them, or at least taken La Palma, and the sortie would then have been, as it was meant to be, a great success But its readers do not seem to have allowed for the alternative of the General standing his ground, and eton | returning their fire, and hence the sortie failed, the assailants retiring almost, if not quite, as soon as they found themselves within range of his guns The strangest part of the affair, pot hops, is that they do not seem in the least disheartened by the failure I heard one of the leaders last night talking about the number of shells thrown into General Campos' garden as proudly as it a great and decisive victory had been won It is true that thoyha\oou their side not of no man killed or hurt, whorous they feel confident that they must have played sad havoc with the enemy General Contreras knows himself of one Artilleryman who was out in half by a shell A friendly pen aunt who brought the General in grapes this morning was, he declares, within fifty yards of the victim, and his testimony is naturally considered preferable to that of another peasant, who was also within the besieging lines, and who declares that nobody there was injured With the certainty, therefore, of one enemy out in half and the possibility of an indefinite number of others placed hors de combat, the General, contemplating his own intact force, may feel that he has a right to claim a victory The one all absorbing question among the handful of foreigners who are doomed to watch this absurd farce is, When will it and but no one has any sufficiently trustworthy data for answering it According to one theory, a color ably influential party in the Government are heartily sick of the whole business, and, seeing that no other Spanish town is likely to join Car agents, have lost all hope of the ultimate success of the movement They think, therefore, son Billy enough, that they may as well surrender at once, now that the Madrid Government are offering, or at least conniving at the offering, of very fair terms, instead of waiting on hopelessly till the bombardment at lost begins and the chance of fair forms may be lost they are bound to have urged yesterday's port in the hope that, if unsuccessful, 113 they anticipated, it would bring matters (circuses According to another theory, a few of the more determined leaders men like Senor Gil vez who has somehow convinced themselves of the goods of their cause, are resolved to go on fighting, even against hope, until they have eaten their last cavalry ' sorrow " 01 fired their lost shot One Bauguino gentleman, a distinguished Parisian Communist, has even been heard to declare that he begins to enter tain a firm and lively expectation of seeing Cartagena in flames " My own impression is that much, if not everything, depends on the success of the expedition to Alicante, about which I have already telegraphed to you If Alicante, which thanks to Admiral Campbell, will have had four days to prepare itself and obtain reinforcements, can make a successful stand, and the Intransigentes ironclads have to 1 even 11 to Cartagena without money 01 prow alone, then I anticipate that their comrades in side the town will, 111 thorough disgust and de- pair, open their gates to General Martinez Campos, especially if Senor Castelar, no longer hampered by the Cortes, can at last give him the means of throwing a few shells into the town Food is not exactly scarce 111 Cartagena, from all I can be there is, that is to say, enough food of a certain kind to keep 01 fully resolute garrison provisioned for some time longer But then this garrison is by no means roBoluto 01 at all disposed to submit to land ships The soldiers have been already grumbling at having to out what a Gibraltar gentleman of my acquaintance calls " good bill," and they also find the recent lations of broad not sufficiently white or delicate for their taste they are now counting upon better diet from the success of the Alicante expedition, and are not likely, if it fails, to beat their disappointment lory meekly 01 stoically Their pay, too, and that of the Volunteers, is also, I am told, greatly in arrears The Provisional Government of the Spanish Federation have found it very difficult to coin money in suflt lent quantities out of Senor languorous silver bars, although, with characteristic freedom from the old world prejudices which trammel less advanced Governments (boy called 11 to then councils in ' smasher," one of the nil useful convicts, and made him, as it were, Master of the Mint Possibly he could not get 111 Carta gene the materials requisite for the colors of his profession, or (he stimulus of danger and dishonest gain was wanting, or he had coined false money on too modest a BCOIO to have acquired the experience ueeessarvfoi the whole sale operations of a Government At any rate, the new Cartagena coins have issued very slowly from his mind, and are so scarce that it was only through private interest I could get one as a curiosity It is a neat coin-a dollar with seemingly rather more than the usual dollar's worth of silver in it, as if the " smasher" rushed to make up for the opposite weakness of his earlier efforts On 0110 side is, in the centre, the word " Cantonal," and round the run " Revolution once pesetas " On the other side, in the centre, " September, 1873," and around, " Cartagena sitiada por los centre listens " I had almost forgotten to mention what is perhaps the most important change since I left Cartagena, and one which lends a ray of hope to all who wish to see at an end The con v lets, who have all been fined and go about publicly in a blue sailor like uniform, have been giving serious trouble, and Cartagena is in con- sequence no longer the model of a quiet, orderly town that it so long was. I am told, though on no very good authority, that there have been cases of housebreaking, and there is no doubt that they have been many cases of brawling in the streets and stabbing The convicts, too, who muster from 1500 to 2000 a large proportion of the garrison have been using uncomfortably menacing language as to what they will do if they are not treated more like gentlemen they have taken deep offence at an attempt of some of the invalid soldiers to keep them from coming to the same hospital, the nurses aiding and abetting the soldiers by refusing to nurse the convicts Their indignation is scarcely un- natural, since it certainly is not fair to use a man for fighting as a patriot and soldier, and even to take him out in grand sorties, and then, when he is ill, to object to nurse him on the score that he is a convict One of them, when reproached with his past history which he had just freshly illustrated by nearly cutting a friend's face to pieces proudly declared that he had " only killed a carabinieri " Convicts, like other men, have their proper pride, and in this instance, perhaps, it is fortunate they have, or they might all unite against the non convict population. But the gentleman who had " only filled a cooslguardsmon" would probably refuse to be on intimate terms with any one who had killed a mere policeman, as the second murderer, in his turn, might " cut" a convict who had killed anybody not connected with the Government, and, therefore, scarcely fair game.
