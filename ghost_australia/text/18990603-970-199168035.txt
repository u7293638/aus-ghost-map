Barr, ho n e ver, 'did not put him to the ordeal of.waiting even the hour, for in halt that time they were speeding in the lessen* don train towards the former's home. *' They think yon are up aloft," whispered Barr, as they n eared the house; " I most go first and let them know the truth, or they will perhaps object to my bringing a ghost home with me." In a few miautes hecame to the gate with Mrs. Barr at his side and beckoned Trenoweth op." Mrs. Barr's greeting was a cordial one, for shelouked upon him as one really risen from the dead. Before he was allowed to shnt himself np with his letters, ! his ; host insisted upon his haying lunch, and, that over, he made hastily for his room and opened his budget of letters. He took tbem according to the dates on the envelopes, and thus h,e had a consecutive history of eveuts in St. Columb'a Gove. The letters from Inez Were of an affectionate character, but the later dated ones were mostiy written by his mother. The last one he had to open was very voluminous, aud he found that it was dated from St. C jiumb's Gove, on the 5th of September, 1871, and from his mother. It was is follows:— f My dearest Son,— *• It is only a sense—a very strict sense —of my maternal duly to you which impels tne to send'you the information contained Herein. Knowing me as you do> you can well believe me when I say that I would rather' be in thy grave than be thus forced to inflict the pain which I know this will giveyoui "Not to keep you in suspense, I.may as Well tell you at once that Inez has proved aiifaithfai to you (oh, taat I should live to have to say it I)" . { Trenoweth put down the letter at this juncture apd stared vacantly at the wall in front of' him. The news was so sudden that it fell upon him like a thunderbolt. " Inez unfaithful 1" He had never even reckoned on the possi* bility of suoh'an ending to his love dream. The awakening was a rude one. For twenty minutes he thus sat, and then, •lowly lifting the fatal letter, he Itieg^ to read again. . . .

' • - ' .• " On several Nother occasions the tourists paid visits to/ScI Oolumb; but, as there ate so many places of legendary interest to be ' seen, I did not attribute the slightest im- . portance to the visits. •• On several occasions, I now recollect, Inez was away from home for two or three hours at a time; but, as she was in the habit of visiting the villager*, as yoa know, I could not be expected to connect her absence with the Australian tourists.. I afterwards learnt that,at least twice, she went to meet Cbaiies Simpson. 1 At the end of two months I beg&n; to notice a change in the dea-eanor of Inez, She seemed dissathfied and irritable in an unusual degfte, and her absences were j moie numerous and more prolonged than ' before. " I bore with it all nntil one day the truth was most unexpectedly revealed to me by old Peggy Penhaven, who nursed you, and who has loved you like a second mother. " The good soul came to me as a soxt o accredited messenger of the villagers to let me know that all was not right—Inez Jasper was almost daily in the company of one of the visitors who had lately driven over to St. Columb. " The jealous villagers had watched the meetings, which took piaoe near the Black Bock, on the road to Tentagal. It was beyond doubt that the pair met as lovers, and the villagers, knowing tbat I must be ignorant of the action taken by Inez, resolved that I should know. *' I can assure you, Edward, that at first I Was incredulous, for I could not bring myseif to believe tbat the cuiid I had reared could act so treacherously. " When the old nnrse went away I sat down and pondered deeply over the cummusication 1 had just received. " The more I thought the more firmly wqs I convinced that it was my duty, both for your sake and for hers, to speak to Inez on the jsubject. " It was six o'clock when she returned,and as she passed me to go to her room I thought she seemed somewhat agitated. "Whenshe returned I asked her in the kindest way where she had been. "' I just went to see Mother Penhaven,' she answered. it i 8fc e a t home V I asked. •• 4 Oh, yes,' replied Inez. 4 1 This answer confirmed my worst fears, .for I well knew that Inez had told me a lie. " I went to her, and, taking her hand in mine, said: «« Do you remember, Inez, when Edward bade you bis last good by ? Do you remember promising to be faithful to him and that only death would part you ?' People, when they are young, promise many foolish things which never come to anything,' she answered with a^ forced laugh. 4 People, young or old, should not break solemn vows wicnout abund&nt; cause,' I said sharply. And have I not abundant cause V she broke out in a torrent of passion. * I have not heard^fram E l ward for more than a year; and it seems to me I will have to wait until 1 am gray haired if I wais for him to get rich and marry. But I am not going to wait. I am engaged to Charles Simpson, and arrangements are already made for Our marriage at Tiniagal to- morrow.' " The suddenness of this revelation gave me ^a shock; I dropped; her hands and was about to turn silently away, when I remembered my duty to you. Turning to her, I said: * " Will yon jdo yonr duty as far as yon can and tell J3dward what yon have done ? It will spare me a trial. 1 " *No t' she answered, passionately and decisively. *-I will ℓ him nothing, nor ^ hold communication ^wfth him. He treats fee with neglect and?l wiU .return it.' «I said no more, for my heart was too full.

She is one not only insensible ; to true love but also to gratitude. Are yon ! going to wreck your life for one so unworthy of any sacrifice ? I will say no more now, but think to-night over what I have said. If you do not care to leave your room I will send yon somethiugj" Trenoweth did not care to leave his room, and Barr left him to himself to fight out his own salvation. Even as Jacob wrestled with the angels, so also did Edward Trenowetb struggle with his passion that night; and, ere morning dawned, he had obtained the victory. The guardian angels of good sense and. fortitude came to hib rescue, and he registered a vow that he would blot the image of Inez Jasper entirely out of his mind for •ver. CHAPTER XXV, BISCHOFF. When Trenoweth appaared in the break* fast room next morning Mr. and Mrs. Ban were surprised to find the young man in sucb g«od spirits. As he Bhook hands with Barr, he whispered : " I have taken your advice, my good friend." " Good 1 Be firm !" replied Barr. •' You will want the day to yourself to answer your mother's letters and give an account of your long silence," ni3 host said to Edward as he was leaving. "And mind," he added, turning back, " the mail goes tomorrow," Trenoweth was anxious to write to his mother and explain his long silence, and he eent away an unusually long epistle, which it was fated she would never see. He touched ligLtiy on the dangers he had gone through, eo tjj not to unduly alarm the good soul at home. He annonnced his intention of returning to St. Columb'a Cove within a few months. His idea was that, if his mother did not like to leave the old home, he would remain there also; but, if she would emigrate, he intended coming back and taking up his permanent residence in Melbourne or some other part of Australia. The sunny southern land was beginning to charm him, in spite of the trials and disasters he had experienced. The progressive character of the people and the bonhdiess resources of the land convinced him that he would do much bettor ih the young country than in old Cornwall. : The associations at St. Columb could not but be painful to him, and his resolution was fixed to return provided his mother was agreeable. j$ .... • The next morning, as he was glancing over the daily paper before breakfast, a telegram t&of;'Launceston caught his eye which m&de; lus^eart beat faster. It Wft8^a«imple announcethent that valuable deposits of tin ore had been discovered , T } f < ^ it m the north-west, of ^Tasmania, not far te»m Emn Bfcy and in close proximity to MountBischofi.

Then he isaid.: , . . _ ( . . ,'*' "I thought you bad bad enough of this prospecting wdrk for a time. The west coast of Tasmania is not a pleasant place, though not quite so bad as central Austtalia. You can get plenty of water, at any rate ; but the food is scanty, and the forest and scrub are awful." "I have been to this locality, as I told you, and I am sure tbat a vast deposit of tin exists there. In fact, my intention was to go to the place in a few days and further prospect it; but yon see there is no time to be lost if I want to make anything," Edward answered. "Besides," he went on, " there is sure td be a rush to the place, and there 1 is little f£ar of anything bad happening to • me." | " Yes, I dare say you are light," returned Barr, who had been closely examining some papers. "I find the only boat leaving for Tasmania to-day goes to Launceston ; but you can join a service there which will take you to Emu Bay, or you can get overland to Bischoff. The boat sails in two hours from now, so that not a single moment is to be lost. The preparations which Trenoweth had to make were few, for Barr told him he would send a cable message to his agent in Launceston to buy the necessary outfit and also secure a berth in the coastal steamer. Bidding Mrs. Barr a hasty adieu, Edward and his friend went into the city, and two hours later the former was steaming down the turbid Yarra on his way to Launceston. Early next morning he was at the Tamar settlement; but. early as it was,Barr'slocal agent was awaiting fcim, | The latter knew him throngh his former visit, and,l>aving heard of his reputed death,! was a good deal surprised to see Trenoweth,' for he thought Barr—which would be most unusual with him—had made a mistake in' the name Jbe sent. j "I was under the impression," Fraser! said, as he cordially greeted Trenoweth,! that I would never meet you again except 1 in the kingdom of shades. It seemed almost csrta[in that you must have perished in that confounded place." " Well, here I am at any rate I and with much more experience than when I last saw you," said Edward. "Yes; I believe that." The boat to Emu Bay did not leave until noon. Fraser had already engaged a passage on it for Tr- noweth, and the necessary articles were obtained and put on board. As Edward was walking np the street in a somewhat abstracted frame of mind, he was surprised to hear a sweet voice—at least it seemed sweet to him—call; " Mr. Trenoweth." Turning, he found himself confronted by Miss Byan, of Cape Barren Island. She looked even more surprised than he did, as she said : "I was almost doubtful that it cauld be you, but I was determined to make certain. I have been watching you for five minutes. You know, Mr. Trenoweth, wa heard such—such very bad hews." "I am most delighted to meet yon, Miss Byan. How are rour father and mother and all on the island?" volubly enquired Bdward, as his face lighted np with real and unfeigned pleasure. a T <? all well," the girl answered ; " but we heard such had tidings of yourself and party. Of course, we took a great interest in your expedition, and we watched the papers for information, knowing where yon intended going. Six: months ago we read a dreadful account of what had happened to you; but I am so glad to find that it was a mistake." , -"-So far as : T am concerned, it was a mis* take; but- I am sorry to tell you, that 1 ;must £ :beiieve;thy good mates, Grey aud thi brothers Norton, perished in the wilder* intss;" it; UiSi-'J.rt- , ' • -•» *;...*Neither of i^iedQ spoke for a minnte or two, Wheju Miss^ansMd:' •; •. ?
