vanished hours. Where are they gone, tbo<ie dear dead days, Those sweet pass days of long ago. Whose ghosts go floating to and fro When evening leads ns through her maze Where are they gone ? Ah ! who can t-U ? Who weave once more that long-passed spell 1 They did exist when we were young. We met cur life with strength and trust; We deemed all things were pure and just. Nor knew life had a double tongue. We Vghtly sang a happy song, Nor dreamed our way could e'er be wrong. And then a'l changed; as life wont by The friend deceived, or bitter Death Smiled as he drank onr dear one's breath. And would not let us also die. Day followed day; as on they went Each took some gift that life had sent. Yet it was ours, that perfect past 1 We did have days that knew not pain. We once had friends death had not ta'en, And fiowers and songs that could not last Were ours in that most blessed'time, When earth seemed Heaven's enchanted dime. And so I think, when lights bnrn low, And all the house is fast asleep, From out a silence vast aud deep Those dear dead days we worshipped so Breathe on ns from their hidden stt re Their long-lost peace, their faith once more. God keep those dear old times; ah m9'. Beyond our vision they may rest Till on some perfect day and blest Once more those dear dead days will be. For death, who took all, may restore The past we loved to ua once more.
