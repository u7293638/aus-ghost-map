MABQII.— Od! vAjodnir.man, I-doot yea may -be - wraig -•• To keep the bairn's habteestmrnt aff sae lang ; (Suppose the fever,! or same quick miicliance. Or e'en the l&ghost;, whup it oft at acce. To fire and brimstone i* the black domains, Wi* unbdieren «nd-«t.christened -weans; I'm acre you never could lorgie yoursel', Or cock your head iu iieeven wi' it in hs!L Akdbew— If a I thocht on't te-Lmybo«o's began'to yearn; But woman, to my to trow I fca'e found Our minister i* or ythirg but FO.ind. I'd sooner break the half o' the commands, Than trust a oairn's bajiteesement tae his hand*. I wai na* »ay our minister's dij raved j In fact io a respect he's weel beu&ved; ; He veeaiU the hail parith, rich an.! por; A wortiu.r man, in wo-ldly ways, um BUi-e We could na' ha'e, but och! wae's n.c, wae's me. In doctrines poinis Ilia head is a' agee. Wi' him there's nae elect; a' are the same. An honest heart, and conduct free fr^e blame He thinks mair likely in tte liouro' de:uh To comlort ane, thin loads o' Bibl'i faith. Bedemptioa, tae, he am;»t sets aside, Ani leaves us hopeles?, wandering far and wide J And whether caved or damned we canna* tell, 1 or every man' maun e'en redeem liiuisel*. Then -on the res .rrection he's clean wrong Wherefore says he, lie i' your graves eae lang f The ape'erit is ihe nun, and it ascends That instant tliat your bn-athin* ends. The body's buried, and wi 1 rise no mair, Though a" the horns in heevea should rout and ratr. Sometimes he'Jl glint at Bobie Bums' de'il, As )f ho were a decent kind o' chief. Bur, to the doonricht Satan o' lli» wood, | Wae'o me I be does na* pay the least regard ; And hell, he treats sae brief, and counts sue ama', That ,it amounts to nae sic p ace ava. O ! dear, to thiok our holy cbaunts, And a' the self denying o* us saunta, Are no' to be repaid by the delight O' hearing fete that legion, black as night, Theyellii.g, gnashirguud despairing cry O' wretches that in iire and brimstaue ie. 1' will never dae guid wife, this daft divine £hall never lay hands on bairn o yours and mine. 2Il.se is.— You're j klit puid man, nthT than Ian' like his Sapteese the bairn, we'll keep it as it is ; for aye, cn cutlin' wi' its kith and kin, A huieatot, a hecthen^sU'eped in sin. ANDREW.— . Sin 1 iditi you say gnid wife 7 Ay, there again Our minister's meerringe&t; o' meu. Original sin he a most laughs to scam. And says the puirert thing's a La be new born ; Buithjree five guil, cjn-L'ption, guit, and all 3 he curses o* a vees.onny fall. Ay! vefsionsiy was his very word— Bapteese our bairn, it's morally absurd. MAGGIK.— Th n Andrew we'll just let the baptism hp, And pray to hceven thtf bairn may neier dee. It prov.dencr, for ends known to iteel'. Has o'er us placed this darkened infiiel, Let's «mst that providence 'jit make us right, And aihlenn turn our present dark to light. AKDBEW.— ~~ M aggie njy womon you're fcaith right and wzang. Trust providence, but din'na s t o'er laug, In idle hope th^t providence 'ill bring Light to your feet or o»y ither thing. The Lo'-d h lps them that strive as weel as trust, While idle faith ge s naetuing but a cruel. Bo sijs this heetben man—tae only truth We've ever gotten fmc liis grocelt-ss m..utii. let's usa the means, and h. even 'ill b ess the end. And, Maggie, this is what I noo intend ; That you and I the morn's moon go forth, Bearing the bairn aia-g unto ti e rooth, Like favored ones of old. until we find Am n ofnprLht life and g dly mind, Sound in the faith, o.aiured iu a' his powers, Tit to fajptise a w.el to n bairn like ours. Uoo then, the paritch—fl.sh maun e'en be fed— And I'll wail out a ohapter,- syne to bed. A! but the mornin'e grand that mottled gray Is certain promise o' a fnmus day. But Maggie lacs, ycu're getting nred I doot, Gie me the baim, we'll tak it t:me aboot. IUqgib — I'm no* (hat tired, and yet tlie road looks lane. . But» Andrew man, wliar da you mean to can* ?

A man of lioiy zeal, sound as a be 1, In a* things perfect as the woild i ee' btrict in his goings out and cjn.in s in, A man that knoweth not the taste o' sin ; £xcept origin 4. -Yon'a the ti^aa e. .* "Wi" him there's nap new reading o* the text, Kae whim that veetiat s the essential- of your creed, But scriptural in thouclit, in word and deed.
