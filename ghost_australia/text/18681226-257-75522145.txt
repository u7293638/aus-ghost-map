THE fltovMtiff ©iigiits $!«$*«»?? TOOWOOMBA, DECEMBER 26th, 18C8. 'FKBIO: TtOO.' We had no Christmas waits or merry chimes ringing out from quaint old belfries to announce tbe advent of the great Christian festival, but it came to us just as we would wish to see it come in ihia new land of ours ; for many, if uut all of us, are over-burdened at this time with memories of the past which scarcely reconcile themselves with the joyous humour and boUterous festivi ties of the days gone bye. We think of the old house at home, and all its once happy associa ? tions, the old familiar faces that we met year after year — faces that seemed to be consecrated to this happy day of rest— wandering brothers, sisters and schoolmates, all gathered from their ordinary scenes of busy life to gladden the Christ mas board and to cheer the hearts of ' the old folks at home.' We try to satisfy ourselves whether we are now remembered with the name kindly feelings that existed in that happy time, whether the vacant chairs are still kept for the wanderers, and if the hearts at home come out to meet us with all those recollections we are so jealous and happy to cherish. This time of peace, good-will, audj^^con Becrdtea tuso oy cue recoiLect^s*********iuie differences and estrangements wh^^^^^^&n; mutually forgiven ; the old frien^^^^^fe been reconciled, and tbe errant l^^^^f^B) have been forgiven, seem to comia^m^pi open hands to receive our congratulations, and to bless us for our intercession. The glorious tiding* given to the shepherds at Bethlehem, eighteen hundred years ago, come to us now with greater force and solace than they did wheu we were in the pride and flush of our youth— for we have learnt by experience bow to value the blessings which are conveyed in the words-.-' Peace on earth and good -will towards men.' The friendships and associations which can be formed in colonial life are no few in nnmber that none 'of those petty differences which frequently intervene should be permitted to interfere with the great principle of brotherly love ; and if there be any relatives and friends who have become estranged by hasty words, spoken, perhaps, in moments of anger, we trust that they will not at this time refuse to enter into the general feeling of good- will, but take each other honestly by the hand, and hallow the memories of the past by a mutual reconciliation. We cannot, of course, reproduce the Christmas of our childhood ; we have lost the enow and the frost which made us gather closer round the blaring fire u we listened to the Christmas ghost story ; we miss the green old holly with its rosy bern.es bursting, as it were, at the thought of the happiness around it ; and more especially we miss the silver-berried mistletoe, respecting which we have certain recollections connected with a coy little maiden whom we loved with all the fervency of our boyish love. If there was any rival to the maiden, it existed in mince pies, and these, with the pudding, formed the gems in that great carnival of the Christmas holidays. Unfortunately, the old fashioned roast beef of fabulous fatness becomes somewhat undesirable, with the temperature At a, hundred and two ; and the plum pud ding, which we always regarded as a sacred institution, seems Unpalatable and heavy to our degenerate constitutions. We have no taste for blind man's buff, hunt the supper, or kiss in the ring. We are oppressed with heat ?nd enwui, and consequently subside into our rocking-chair, dreaming of ice and ' the girls of the period' with whom we used to open the country dance and engage for 'Sir Roger de CoTerley.' But tjiere is one recollection connected with Chrifttmwi which presents itself for epeciftlobear* vatton, and that is the duty of providing for the ?ick and needy. A little relief, a kind word and Katie succour, will, at these times, go far to rain* the minds of the unfortunate and broken hearted, who, perhaps, are brooding over those bitter contrast* which force themselves into notice at this particular time. There is the widow and orphan, penniless, perhaps, in their tfcmave&ient;, and without one ray off hope to lighten the desolation which hat fallen upon their home. These and others should be remembered from mt of our abundance, and if we ean woetif/ the memories of the past with a^victuo£wt we have administered to a (ufiering hntlHr^ame portion of th*l light ?J«lluLpPine*^44ha»fmUento«lr|ot,we ?hall have itoMfeOMtttng worth? a golden record, Jfot.ln happy maudauat with that Gnrhtnaa enrtuks which prpeiai*a«4, -ffeMe nponetrth and good will toirard men.' ^. ??
