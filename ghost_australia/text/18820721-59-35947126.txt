g5oeti\\\ .BERTIE. BY KMSIA AIJCE BBOWNE. Drop the blind, and draw the curtain Close about the lattice sill ; How the Norther wails and clamors. And the night is black and shrill ! There are ghosts abroad — the spectres Of tine happy long ago : Wraiths that rise to haunt me ever . When the dreary north winds blow, As in winters long ago. Hark ! was that the wild rain falling In the dark, deserted street ? Of the fitful pit-a-patter Of a baby's restless feet ? Was that cry a gusty murmur Of the wind without the door ? Or a childish voice that calls me From the distance evermore When the rain, is. at the door ? From the hollow darkness reaching, Tender arms my neck entwine, Baby ringlets brush my worn check, Baby lips are pressed to mine ! Nay, 'tis but a haunting memory Cheats my hungry heart's despair ! Yonder stands his shrouded cradle, And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair .' Yet he cometh to me ever When the night and darkness fall ; ?When the wild winds shrill and clamoi', And the rain is over all ! While I count my hoarded treasures — Precious trifles dear to me ! — Sunny curl, or half- worn garment Rich -with cunning broidery — All of him that's left to me ! Battered toys and baby's picture, With ' Our darling' scrawled beneath. And his rosy coral, dotted .With the prints of little teeth. Ob, the dainty, scarlet stocking ! Oh, the tiny silken shoe — Worn threadbare, where I so often Kissed the pink toes peeping thro' — Baby's first, enchanting shoe ! So with loving hands I take them From their secret hiding--place : Turn them o'er with lingering touches — Kiss the chubby pictured face ; \- While the salt tears, slow and bitter, Wrung from motherhood's despair, Fall upon his shrouded cradle : And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair !
