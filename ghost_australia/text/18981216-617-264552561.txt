A sharp run acrosB tlje downB meanwhllcv soon bronjflittho young koepcr to a hilly spot tli;it,c(iiimianiiod n good view around and a clcar sight of the inn, the Pyed Bull, known by woodmen mony a mile away. Standing on the summit of the liiji, IIIB Cj-cs bright and keen, liarry diecornod four men nui^itigotid -atr the doof pf.lhejnn, all ptxliom, were Voikih^KiBs the mad top high lielil near u wood on the opposite side. 1 A few minutcH after the naluto and determined keeper had readied the little rillago public house, and making hie way into the bar .as he had suapoctod, found seated with soma half-dozen loafers, his fellow keeper, thu old man, Teddy Jakes, who, half drunk, was shouting out the scraps of n hunting Bong. By tho fire, with hU back to thp door, sat a stalwart lad, Iieay?ari>pr£batebfol her, in close confabulation With a short, red, bearded mjan, a wcll-knowu comrade of tho nyj^drdosjionadu and poaclier Jack Xngledew, or Black Jack, as he was colled. ' " Why, blessod if llarry Uudlcy ain't jined us," cried the inebriated Jakos, who, staggciing forwaidg, clapped his companion on tho back, exclaiming, in think, guttural accents: " Wo'vo had tile ranger here, Harry, boy, swearing about that buck that was killed yet-ierday. I did'ut let out as it war Black Jack's doings, though; Jack always squares itw-itliimo^Xijirry, and so he will with you." " I'll square with him, Jakes, by putting him in aholo he won't get outof in a harry I" muttered the young koepor, with frowning brow. " Don'lee meddle with 'un, Harry; he's a dead shot, and he's sworn lic'll kill the firet man who lays hands on liim. Ho said it of you lad, not half an hour ago in tliiB very bar. \- " Ha I yon've had the rullion here, then, as I suspected, bniX he's now away in Audley Woodo, but I'll have iiim!" cried the young keeper, as with flashing eyes ho mode for the door. Tho lialtdrunkcn crowd, along with the affrighted JakeB, now endeavoured to kcop (he oxciled young man back, but, Bhaking themiiff, Hairy Dudley was out at the door, down the ruud, and flying towards the adjacent woods in a moment of time. This place, Audley Woods and Walk, was a favourite haunt of the. doer, being full of ooverts obd lurking places, and full of leafy holly, the deer's favourite food. The scattered woodlands and copies abounded in hazel and young beech, and tho jfcrn grew thicker pn tho slopes and round the hedgerows than in other parts of the deep woods. .Gaining, after half-an-hour's sharp walking, some high ground, Harry, casting IIIB eye towards an hedgerow, perceived two men walking slowly by the Bido of it, ono, as far as he could distinguish at Buch a disatnae, carrying a gun. , i 7 With compiseBed lipB and knitted brow tlio enraged young keeper stood for amomcnt glariqjat the tW) poachers,and then withont furthSnSiltationdartid off in 'pursuit of them. i Past six o'clock thero was only a dim, shadowy light in tho wobdB,' and it was with some difliculty Harry kept the two figure in Bight, to biB chagrin the poachers presently both disappearing through a gap in a tall, thick hedge. Hlgh'tahcad he now unbesitatingly rushed, audio a few monSbhU-waiin the gap, and brushing; .^way Lb?, hazels, to Mb amaze, idni(^'b'uttedjE^alnat a rauns- ho was quietly sttodiugr^fikin£a pi^,i ;wit^i his hands in 1 hb pickets. \ f Tlie ehrewd young keeper fancied lie could aetoct>>he devicfc j.' •. Tlielellow eo iincpncerncdly-Bmoking his pipe waa sdreenlng and covering his mate on ahead; and that;otlier man.Harry intuitively bit, was the ruffian lie wanted—the deersteider who had Bwom to t«ko hia life—the poaclier, Black Jack '!• . • f il Bruphing past the fellow , '"wilh the pipe (who grumbled' Bometliing 'Bullenly), Harry hurned on. Presently, after gaining a sort or stubble fipld, ho could -;disccrn nothing of the-man with the gun. but dashing on recklessly now, for his blood was up, he caught Bight at lust of someone crcepingalong under a hedge about fifty yardB ahead. , A loud mocking lough , now woke up the stilln'esstof^hB scene, an din another moment the'creeping figure had -Btarted np. A giant of a man over six feet, with voluminous black beard and whiBkers shrouding his mahogany-tinted visage, menacingly confronted the garpekeejior, a gun-pointed BirtctlyathiS'heaS.' MfJ^J . ^yfct With a thrill Harry Dudley, as the deadly tube was presented at him, raised his own, rifle to hisshbulder, but, before lie could take* aim at his deudly foe, a sharp crack was followed by a whistling ping over his head, a Blrcakasof flame passing across his scalp, whilst hiB felt list whirled away like a wisp 'of straw. Staggeringback with the idea that he was mortally hit, the young keeper was saved from a second discharge by tumbling into a small hollow. i ~ Again now that-mocking, ; jeering laugh rang in thoalr; an<j uien as Harfyroso partly on hiB feet, muscular arms wonnd around his chest with the Btrength .and hug of a grizzly bear. ; Having made the diBCOvej-y ia second of time before that the bullet Of .the.-murderous poacher had only graed IUB ^ealp,he now prepared in wild, fierce rage for a stroggle to the death with his enemy. Hot a word was spoken by the infuriated antagonists. The stalwart young keeper knew that he' had to fight for it or his hour had come, and in rage and desperation he struggled in the orp(>r&ce; of the bloodthirsty; poasher, the renownM and merailesa Black'Jack. A practised wrestler, Hairy held his;own until his brutal and ferocious antagonist with hia heavy-tipped boots kioked at biB legs, slashing the flesh at every lunge as thotlgh It haqbeed ciit^with £ reaping hook, Notjcohtent iwith Ibis ba^barouB feat, as both eome to the ground, the doer-slayer, witjip savage howj.fixfd his teeth like a bulldog into the neck of his adversary. - Sick and faint from loss of blood and the Herco struggle, Harry had nearly.lost.all con-, sdoushess, as locked in the other's mad embrace, ho presently'fell with him into a deep, dark rent j>r. hole in the earth. Giddy and bruiBtid/^releasod from the deadly grip of hie mad foe, Harry remained for some Minutes with the same sort of feeling one lias upiin awakoning from a bad dream.
