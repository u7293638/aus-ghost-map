This process is not consoious learning, not even a translation, but an intuitivo act, that of " seeing in the mind " It is in the important part our faculty of visualisation plays in the study of languages, as in all mental operations, that, says Mr Howard Swan, depends the originality and success of Gouin's idea The ritionnio of his sj stem, then, is that the " gift for languages " is n method (not nn abstruse faculty of the mind), the two principal factors in which maj bo termed montai visualisation and mental v ocalisution On the basis of this theory that man is simply " a mental

to British oapi talists Mr Bent's travelling passport was duly mse'd br Scienco, but ho did not go as a naturalist any moro than us a sportsman His narrative is full of anthropologicalinterest, and no

ment on which it is written by Dr A Schaffle, who intends it as a supplement to his earlier work, " The Quintessence of Socialism " This authorised English edition was translated by A O Mourant, and

foot disclosed by this inquiry is the special illegitimacy average, repeated pretty regularly year after year, of not only each political division of Europo, but of each dopartmcat and county, each city and neighbourhood Religion seems powerless to combat sexual im- morality, nor aro "virtue and the spelling-boo'..
