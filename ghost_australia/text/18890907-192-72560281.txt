But the most pleasing trait .in this couple was that, though so plainly devoted to one another, and satisfied with their own company, they were not wholly eaten up with mutual adiniration: their nature seemed to have a sympathetic feeling that moulded it self to suit the dispositions of those around, without eaerificing its own individuality.
