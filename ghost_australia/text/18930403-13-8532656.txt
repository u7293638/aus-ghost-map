He was truly man and by His resurrection He proved himself to be truly God The day had superseded the Sabbath of the dows which signified, their delay chance from the bondage of 1 g} pt Heir deliverance was like other events which occurred to them typical of better things to come. The passage through the Red Sea was really typical of Christs going through the grave in order to deliver his people and the seventh day had given place to Easter as a day of more blessed redemption than that of the Israelites from Egypt And thus as a thoughtful writer had stated the observation of that day which the Jews signified ceased and was buried with our Saviour and instead of it the religious observance of the day on which the Son of God rose from the dead by the constant testimony of the blessed Apostles was transmitted to the Church of Christ and so continued through out all ages The invitation in the text to rejoice and be glad meant that the festival should not in rely be recognised as a venerable ecclesiastic institution but as an occasion for general rejoicing Passing on to the argument that the resurrection formed the foundation of the Christian religion Dr Gee observed that it mattered little whether other miracles were justified if this one were true If it were substantiated it could be easily be believed that the other miracles related in the Bible were performed This was the crown ing miracle and the one destined to be the keystone of the Christian arch and there was abundant testimony to the truth of the fact It had been said that the church had been built on the empty grave of Christ Now there had never been any thing to account for the emptiness of the trave except the Christian theory that Christ had risen from the dead and that being so it guaranteed our whole faith and was a sufficient answer to all the doubts and difficulties which abounded in the present day Concluding a sermon remarkable for its conciseness the Bishop urged that all should partake of the heavenly peace which at once carried UB backward with grateful love to our Lord's death as a means of reconciliation with God and carried us forward in joyful hope to the time when we would see the Saviour s face and rejoice in His presence The first evensong at half-past 3 p m was characterised by some excellent Bulging on the part of the choir The service was Stan lord s in A which is written in a somewhat unusual style and received a rendering enabling its good points to be thoroughly appreciated The anthem composed the appropriate solo ' I know that my Redeemer liveth and the short choruses which follow this number in The Messiah The solo was beautifully sung by one of the boy choristers At the conclusion of the service the triumphant Hallelujah Chorus of Han Iel was given with considerable effect Mr Ernest Wood as usual presided at the organ and during the service showed admirable taste and skill in the use of the instrument At the time of the sermon the congregation had the opportunity of listening to as well delivered discourse by the Rev Digby 'M Berry The text was- Blessed be the God and rather of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a, living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (Peter i 30 The preacher suggested to the congregation that the question they should ask themselves in connection with the festival was what real practical difference did it make to them whether Jesus Christ rose from the dead or not there were a great many people to whom it made absolutely no difference They could appreciate the holidays and that was about all that they cared for as retaide 1 Taster As to the fact that lay at its foundation they were as in different as if it were a myth There was another class of people to whom the resurrection made only a theoretical difference It affected them as regarded their theory of life their religious views their opinions on points of doctrine but it did not influence their practice It did not furnish them with a purpose an 1 object for which to live it did not lift them up in any degree above the cares and worries of mere temporal existence It did not alleviate any sorrow or brighton the gloom that would intrude itself in the lives of all it did not in short save them from themselves and of all the kinds of salvation a mon most needed that of be nL, saved from himself Mr Berry went on to refer to the wonderful effect that the resurrection of Christ had on his disciples who had learned the lesson that the things of this world could receive satisfaction in the presence and companionship of the Saviour they had found an influence that saved them from themselves -that drew them out from themselves and towards God They felt that they could give up everything and life itself, but they could not give up Him The influence which we as exercised upon the Apostles was, Mr Berry urged, exactly the same influence which Christians of the present day should feel 'J he Christian life consisted in being betrothed in heart to Jesus Christ and it was possible, by the grace of God lorthepeople of the present day without the direct evidence afforded to the disciples, to believe in Christ just exactly as they had done The words of the Lord to one of those very witnesses should be remembered Because thou hast seen Me. thou hast believed , blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed A plain evensong was held at 7 p m , when the Bishop delivered a second sermon dealing with the great sacred festival COLLINS STREET INDEPENDENT CHURCH The Collins street Independent Church was filled at both the morning and evening Bervice}esterdn} In the morning a detach- ment of the 1st Victoria Regiment headed by their band marched to the church and attended the service The band were provided with seats in proximity to the choir, and, under the baton of Mr George Peake, the organist of the church, accompanied the congregational hymns At the conclusion of the service they played as a lose The War March of the Priests, from Mendelssohn's " Athalie The choir sang the anthem " Sing Praises with organ accompaniment the effect being very good The Rev Dr Bevan who conducted the service, delivered a short and eloquent sermon on the following text from the Gospel of St John iv 16 " Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knowest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water The preacher then proceeded to expound these words, and stated that the narrative of our Lords interview with the woman of Samaria was one of the most interesting and suggestive of Holy Scripture It was so simple and yet was the occasion of some of the most significant utterances ever made to human ears One of the clearest assertions of the Messiah ship was given to that woman who came to draw water at the well She recognised Christ as a Jew, and was surprised that He should ask a drink of a woman of Samaria Christ answered if she knew the gift of God she would ask for six ing water This gift was the gracious gift of God that included nil His mercy and grace Christ was not a mere mystical figure, but was to be taken into our common life the gift of God in all its power was intended for us in the simple communion of friends when engaged in our daily work and at all times On the other side there was suggested the possibility of failure to know this wonderful gift Christ had been proclaimed in this world for nearly 2,000 years, and yet how many were there who did not know Him who had never heard his name Some people said they were sick of churches, which were to be found everywhere, but there were stretches of the world with large populations of men and women who had never heard the word of Christ It was rather for those who had heard it, but had not regarded it that he in tended his remarks If these knew what Christ was they would not sin as they had been singing, nor care for the things for which they cared It was the great want of this age that many men had not tried Christ He who took Christ as his Saviour would overcome Ina smB There were some sad homes to day in Melbourne where if Christ was only taken as the Master blessedness and peace would come Christ could not be had by searching but by accepting He concluded by appealing to all to take Christ into their hearts and six cs as the sunshine that would gladden and the ocean of power that would sustain In the evening Dr Bevan gave the third of his series of sermons to students and all thinking people on the subject 'In the Bible worth reading' answering the question in the affirmative from the ethnological point of view BAPTIST CHURCH, COLLINS SURE ET Both in the morning and the evening there were large congregations at the Baptist Church, Collins street yesterday there was no special choral service, but the organist, Mr Arthur Morgan played " Cujus Am main as the ingoing voluntary, and 3 sister by may and psalms were selected for the congregational singing The preacher at both morning and evening services was the Rev Samuel Chapman, pastor of the church Preaching from the Acts of the Apostles, chap i verse 2 the reverend gentleman made some forcible remarks on the overwhelming testimony which history and Christianity afforded as to the truth of the resurrection of Christ Mr Chapman does not aim at eloquence in his discourses His chief characteristic is simplicity and at times he becomes almost conversational in his style He leans over the reading desk with an easy familiar air, and takes the people into his confidence, as it were, draws his illustrations from the homeliest of subjects and indulging in no pulpit gesticulation trusts to his words and arguments to find their billet He pointed to the abrupt, apparently inartistic ending to the Acts of the Apostles as the highest form of art, indicating, as it did, that the Acts of the Apostles were not yet and never could be finished '1 they were neither more nor less than the octave ity of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost, and they had been going on for eighteen centuries 'the apostles had two kinds of evidence as to the truth of the resurrection of Christ the evidence of testimony and the evidence of experience and we too must be like the apostles and have those two kinds of evidence We had the evidence of testimony and what we next wanted was the evidence of experience Indeed we had more evidence of testimony than had the first disciples On the small slab which recorded the death of Christopher Wren, in St Paul's Cathedral, we were bidden to raise our eyes and see in that magnificent building his monument, and if we wanted to see the monuments raised in testimony to the resurrection of Christ, there was not a nation that did not bear testimony The whole history of the Christian Church was a testimony to the resurrection of Christ in the Church, in the world everywhere On Christianity and his tory was built the great memorial to the fact that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on Easter Sunday Reason and faith met to gether and said one to the other, ' Christ is risen The disciples evidence of experience was that they saw him and had we, who had the evidence of testimony, to stop there Were we to be placed at such a disadvantage compared with the first disciples that we were not to have the evidence of experience as well as that of testimony We cried, " Christ has risen But how did we know he had risen ? We could not see Jesus as the disciples saw him, and touch him, but in our inmost heart we could have the testimony of experience If we could not have that experience then all was miserable and we had been deceived but Christ promised that he would manifest himself to those who loved him and kept his commands, and the whole strength and power of Christian life depended on that manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ Mr Chapman s sermons are short but he practically has two discourses at each service for in the reading of the scriptures he pauses at frequent intervals to elucidate a point or drive home a truth The congregations at both services yesterday were as already stated, large, and Mr Chapman s manner and matter are such that they commune the closest of attention throughout THE AUSTRALIAN CHURCH The serv ices at the Australian Church yesterday were conducted morning and evening by the Rev. Dr Strong The church was very prettily decorated with on abundance of white flowers, ornamental leafage, and crosses The attendance was not up to the usual standard at the morning service, and a number of the members of the choir evidently reserved themselves for the choral service in the evening. It is evidently a transition period in the books containing the church service and hymns The old copies were present in abundance but a new and much improved book was in use and visitors spent a good deal of time in looking in the old books for li} inns and Prayers not there A special request from Mr Strong that those who had copies of the new book should share with those who had not was not unnecessary The sermon had special reference to the sacrament of the Lords Supper which was administered at the conclusion of the service It was from the words Take eat this is My body The discourse was a lengthy and interesting one delivered from manuscript in clear tones After a brief description of the feast of the Passover as observed by Christ and his disciples the preacher observed that to Christ the symbol of the feast meant not as had been previously taught, that men were to keep the ancient law of Moses, but rather the law of the spiritual kingdom which was love to God and man It was the substitution of the spirit of brotherly and filial love for legal righteousness and obedience This was the new doctrine which brought down upon Christ the resentment of the orthodox and for which His life was ultimately sacrificed Hence to the disciples the feast afterwards became the commemoration of the death of Jesus It had been variously interpreted since in the mass of the Roman Catholic, the sacrifice of the High Churchman, the incarnation of the Lutheran, and the mystic communion of the Calvinist, all of which contained some good and some truth To as the bread and wine of the Lord's Supt Dr earned no magical or miraculous significance They suggested the relation of our religion with the religions of the world being a link with the Jewish Passover and in later times with the beginning of harvest But whilst not despising any) of these religions, it taught that ours had deeper spiritual meaning than any other it had grown out of Jewish and Pagan soil, but was the fulfilment of the deepest and best results of human history It suggests to us the spiritual meaning of sacrifice and taught that the only true sacrifice to a God of love was love itself, that the banquet was love alone which God shared with him It was further a symbol of divine family, teaching that Christianity. is not an ascetic dwelling apart from others, but that One is our Father, and that we are all brethren, that rich and poor, learned and unlearned, are all one in God The observance of the feast in a right spirit wiped the him of the world away from our eyes and brought us into closer communion with God At the evening service there was a very large attendance Dr Strong preached an excellent sermon on the subject Risen with Christ in newncbS of the There was a special musical Service, including the following numbers, which were all excellently) rendered Solo " Jerusalem (Pur! ci) Miss M Stirling, tenor solo and chorus from ' Messe Solennelle ' (Gounod), Mr Robinson and choir, solo, "Eternal Heat" (Picnic mine), Mr Jones. mott t, "Thereb) Babylon's Wave" (Gounod), choir WESLEY CHURCH The services at Wesley) Church yesterday) morning were conducted by Mr R H Lade), a student of Queen's College, and were of the ordinary nature The sermon was on the sacrifice of Christ, and the words of the text were from the ninth verse of the eighth chapter of Second Corinthians, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor that ) e through His poverty might be rich The preacher referred to instances in which men who had made great sacrifices in order to benefit their fellow men were borne in grateful remembrance, and then said that, while tributes of praise were given to such men, we turned sometimes almost with indifference from the sacrifices of Christ who died for the sins of the whole world By the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, mentioned in the text was meant the above Iutelv unremunerated mediation and unie compensed love of Christ It men desired the benefits of Christ's sacrifice, they must ask for it The) could do nothing to obtain it by their own works, but when they were once saved they must perform services and good works in his cause Christ gave his life for mankind because he loved them Perhaps some of those who were listening to that sermon wondered why Christ should have done so and so did he (the preacher), but he would rather accept the fact than refuse it because he could not understand it. The record of Christ's life reversed all the ordinary rules of biography He came down from His throne to a manger, from being King of tunes to be a carpenter from heaven to earth, that He might like men from earth to heaven, and he passed through a life of sorrows, and a most painful and lingering death to accomplish his purpose The object of His sacrifice was that through His poverty men might be made rich Man) did not become richer in worldly) wealth through embracing Christianity but the riches meant in the text were not earthly riches They were heavenly riches and though Christians might seem poor m tin ores of the world, they were rich in all heavenly) blessings If men desired to have all those blessings, and the riches of Christ's grace, they must go to him and accept him as their Say hour There was no doubt some in that congregation who had not done so, and he earnestly implored them to do it at once The service in the evening was conducted by the Rev C H Ingamells , there was a short organ recital prior to it, in which Mr. W R Bennetts, jun , the organist played " Cujus Animam ' (Rossini), Iii ladies Goltcmnnn), and " Larghetto 1 flat ' Batiste) The sermon was from Luke xxiv IS 11 having reference to the appearance of Christ to two of His disciples on the way to Emmaus The preacher pointed out that the appearance took place on the day of the resurrection It was the fourth Christ had made on that day to different persons, and they with the subsequent one He made to the 10 apostles at Jerusalem, were sufficient to convince all who were honest and sincere of the glorious fact of the resurrection the two disciples had been devoted in their attachment to Christ but on the day. He appeared to them he was evidently not so much to the on us He had been play house) for the) has thought He was the MIRSIUII who was to redeem Israel but in rouse quence of Um death they had come to the conclusion that they had been mistaken, though the) still regarded Him as a prophet of God Christ knew they were true to Him, and therefore He joined them but they did not recognise Him and there was no doubt that a great change came over His appearance after His resurrection As they talked on the way to Timmins Christ showed the disciples how they had been mistaken in their comprehension of the scrip tures, and that according to them the object of the Messiah was to take away the sins of the world. He sent his light into their minds, and so. He did now, in words of consolation and of pence, into the hearts of Christians in dark and troublous portions of their lives at the proper time Christ revealed himself to the two disciples and He would reveal himself now to all who desire turn He would not enter into men's hearts unless they desired him, but when ever there were two talking together of him, he would soon be with them, and they would be made happy by His presence and strengthened by His love _ THE (ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHES The ceremonies of Holy Week were concluded in the various Catholic churches on Saturday morning with the blessing of the virgin fire, the paschal candle, and the font, the reading of the 12 prophesies and the before mentioned ceremonies took place at an early hour, and being a long ceremony, attracted but few persons outside the pale of the Catholic Church Yesterday (Easter Sunday the Feast of the Resurrection was celebrated with much pomp and ceremonial in all the churches where the necessary conditions we pre attainable, special musical settings of the Mass being used, St Patrick's Cathedral, St Francis 8 Church, S.
