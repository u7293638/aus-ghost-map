NEW SOUTH WALES PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. FunuY, May 31. When we went to press yesterday the debate on the Financial Statement was proceeding in the Legislative Assembly The following is a continuation of the speeches Mr KELLY said that the Premier in his Financial Statement had not only give notice of his intention to upset the policy of the country, but to destroy some of its principal industries The honorable members proceeded to read a number of extracts from country newspapers bearing on the proposed abolition of the sugar duties The CUAjiuiU, ruled the honorable member out of order in reading from newspapers str Kelly proceeded to read other extracts, to prove that the inhabitants New South Wales Lying north of the 30th parallel of latitude sacro entitled to petition for separation from IS now South Wales, and said that the probable, result of the stupid policy of the Government would lead instead of federation, to the separation of the northern districts from N osv South W ales Mr bM VILPS said that at the next election free trade and protection would claim but a secondary place, and that the people you d require the carrying out of important reforms The fiscalism he advocated was the fiscalism of land taxation Mr HALL said that those industries which had been established by the policy of protection were to be wiped out of existence, while those industries which had had assistance for a number of years were to have that assistance continued The removal of the sugar duty would mean the destruction of the sugar industry It was not to he supposed that the imposition of a land tax would induce people to go on the land. It the Government would give them an absolutely freetrade policy at once, he would give his assistance to bring it about so that it shall have a trial If freetrade would bring about prosperity, he would be satisfied, because that was all he desired to see" Mr It YWLIiiSON said at the present time it was inopportune to inflict a land tax on the people, as they had not sufficient income to pay even the working expenses There could be no inducement to settle people on the land with a land tax He would vote against the financial proposals Mr KIDD said the present tariff was assisting many industries and filial to the means of employment to thousands of hands This was not the time to tinker sy 5th the tariff, as her our young industries were still relying on the assistance of they had been receiving It was idiotic to talk of comes mg the sugar duties Mr GORMLY move that the Chairman leave the chair and report progress The Caversham declined to accept the motion, on the ground that it was of an obstructive character Mr PERRY" said hon. members had expected that the debate would close at an earlier stagooftho sitting but members on the Government benches appears to have been put up earlier in the evening to exhaust all the time when members might reason able) sneak Referring to the grain and sugar duties, he said that if the Government removed the duty from mai70 the country would be swamped with maize grown h- Jeafhrs and South Sea Islanders who did not live as I trousers did the men engage in the sugar industry had h til a very hard struggle since 1872 before it was firmly established If any one could prove that the sugar industry had been a curse to New South Wales he would at once consent to the duty homg remove 1 Mr WADDELL said the most difficult problem that had confronted Les cr) Government for some years past was that of finding work for our own people Since the year IS a up to about two years ago this matter had been getting worse and ss or so the word I like to ask: hon members what was there in the policy of the Government that would do anything to get me of this difficulty While a land tax would serve a road cut in making a large number of people pay tax upon which they had hitherto escaped a tax of ld in the £ would not have the effect of throwing land open to the people so that they could make a living on it. And if it tended to make land cheaper, how colE 1 more make a living on land if they had no market for their produce ' If the Premier did not think the wiping off of the duties would throw a number of people out of employment why did he hosiLatoto wipe off the sugar- duties at once f He did not think the repeal of the butter tin 1 cheese ration would not severe injury to those industries The soap and candle m lust of would be ruined by the proposals of the Government" There were many other industries which would be seriously injured in the duty was removed Ino sugar industry employes OjJO people, an during the last 10 years the production or sugar had doubled it noR Half the sugar produced in the colony was used in the colony, which meant employment to a much greater number of persons. He eulogised the action of the Government in pushing the export trade of the colony, and said he would live to see them go a step further and there is a commercial agent in London, an 1 also a travelling agent in the Eastern countries to open up new markets Air PYERS said he was altogether opposed to a Hud time, because it would press very heavily on the poor be of Ina district in income tax and not trouble him, because there were no incomes in his district that could be taxed the removal of the sugar duties would ruin the sugar growers Mr EDDEN said he was in favour of a land tax, and would help the Government to pass it Mr MILLER. said it would advance the mining industry very greatly if the Government would es- tablish ba syrup at A annual mining centres, and would also establish a central depot for the treatment of ores by suitable process Mr BWIbTLU said it In been stated that 9000 men were employed (in the sugar industry, and in answer to an interaction it was stated that those men . ere employed during the whole of the year Tal ing the amount of sugar manufacture d in the colony each year at 10,000 tom and the price of sugar at 1-0 per ton, that would give each person engaged in the in dustry £70 1st year J they took from that amount the pr his, commission, cost of transit and other charges, the wages to each of the persons engaged in the in dustry would amount to about May for a whole years work I Mr M\CrvPLVNL said the sugar duties were I not put on for protective purposes in the first instance, but for revenue purposes. The men in the districts along the nv had been working a number of years clearing land and growing cane, and had spent their all in the work, and if the duties were irene edit would mean a utter ruin to those people the land in these entries was ojV, suitable for (growing cane it would not grow maize Very Well, or anything else Mr I3a* beer's argument was in steading In reply to an interjection about an adjournment, the Pm MILER, refining to the agreement with the Opposition to close the debate at midnight on Thurs d ty, and " We is never trust., you again You have b tree as ones but you won I do it again. A breach of faith once is quite enough " Mr KIKKP VI RICK said one of the gentlemen representing the sugar industry had informed the labour member that the wages paid in the sugar ministry were 10s to 16s per week, and that the men were only engaged six months in the year Another of the 250 supporters of the sugar industry had told them that the Sugar Company was one of the greatest Monopolies in New South Wales, a 11 that it monopolized the land and a large I the people £1 an acre rent for it per annum that same gentleman had said he did not care one single rap if the sugar duty was removed to-morrow, and he had also said that if they had uo-op9nti%o mills and improved machinery they would be in dependent of the company, and they could produce sugar irrespective of the duty and "um die with any part of the world If it was good to impose a duty like that simply for the benefit of the sugT company, then he, as one of the labour member j was not going to support it. At 10 minutes to S a in. the Chairman left the chair till 9) a m On resuming, Mr HIIÏKP VEHICLE continued his remarks He said he was for; the debate had dw melted down to a large hon. members opposite were simply advocating a hopeless case Mr 1RA\ nKb JONES said he was a federationist as far as intercolonial freetrade was concerned and protection against the outside world There were two great parties in the House which had been contending j year after year for the treasury benches, and when could they get those two parties to join hands and decide what the fiscal policy of this country should be too was entirely opposed to the policy of the Government i here were men in the House representing labour who wished to crush capital out of existence, but they must have capital to develop the industries of the colony Mr Fir/L'AlKICksaid he would vote against the Ministry At the same time he believed they were fighting on honourable battle Mr PIDDINGTON said the proposals of the Government would require amendment, and he would endeavour to amend them in in accordance with his own ideas He did not think the land tax should be applied to conditional purchases which were in process of alienation The Premier had left on the tariff a number of articles which every freetrader had sworn should come off, and there were articles taken off which might as well have been left on He would do what he could to have these anomalies adjusted He would like to have seen the income tax a graduated one, and how odd like to have seen the exemption £200 instead of £300 Ino Premier in his financial statements said nothing about the loan account He thought a large saving could be effected in the interest burden of the State by a conversion of the loans He thought a saving of £150,000 to £200,000 could be effected annually in this way I Ihn Government deserved credit for the war in which they had endeavoured to take hold of retrenchment The total estimated saving in the various public departments was £o60,000 The system hitherto adopted of keeping the public accounts had made a laughingstock of the country The new system of Loop- ing the public accounts on a cash last was in force in England and the other Australian colonies and he read I could not see why it should not be applied with great advantage in New South Wales also would ask the Government to seriously consider whether It would not be advisable to have a commission appointed to inquire into the state of the public accounts, and to draw up a by stem which every future Treasurer would have to follow He also thought a Parliamentary committee should be appointed to annually check the finances of the colony He thought it was time some concessions should be made to selectors The proposal of the Government in this respect was not aorvmuchof a concession He thought that the interest should be reduced to 21 per cent, and the payment to t d per acre Another matter to which he would like to refer was the making of advances by the State to farmers This proposal had been complicated by being mixed up with the credit foncier system, a State bank, and other things not necessarily connected with it. He would ask the Government to take it into consideration, as he bohove1tho advent of cheap money would do more good to New South Wales than any other measure (Hear, hear ) The farmers were at present paying 80 and 10 per cent to the banks and 1 per cent to the State, and no one could make 11 per cent out of the land and live (Hear, hear.) Mr. SEE VIII said the party he belonged to was of opinion that there were matters of more importance to the people of this country than the fiscal question He thought that if, instead of spending a 10 000 or 60 000 at the Centennial Park, the Government had devoted the money to developing the natural resources of the country it would have been much more advantageously spent He would ask the Government to let hon. members who had been in the Assembly all night know within a few hours when there would be a division (Hear, hear ) The PREMIER appealed to hon members to go to a division The oFi ers of the House had been chained to their duties for the last 20 hours, and a number of gentlemen who had neglected their duties and had gone home and enjoyed a night's rest, now came down to the House to air their eloquence It was not fair , it was an outrage on public justice Mr LYNE said that if the remarks of the Premier were intended to have a personal application they were most insulting He had tried say eral times to speak during the no-confidence and the present debate but had not had an opportunity the financial statement of the Treasurer was such as he had never seen presented by any former Treasurer As One of the Treasurer's own supporters had said, there was absolutely no reference to the past loan accounts of the colony, and scarcely any reference to the con Bihdatoi revenue The Treasurer had imposed duties on certain necessaries of life without consult- ing the House and it was only when he (Mr Lyne) drew attention to this that the duties had been removed The Treasurer had not debited himself with items, amounting to 2238 000 in his statement and had neglected to place in his expenditure items which he was long ally bound to do That was how the Treasurer had been able to show his savings He had reduced the estimate on accot out of the Kath, ay Commissioners, and yet he had no power whatever to interfere with the vote In the road 1 ana bridge vote there was a saving shown of £13 2,000 hut when the Premier was leader of the Opposition he had attacked him (Sir Lyne) for reducing the vote by £21 6,000 The Premier had credited himself With that saving, and had said it was a very smart thing to do but it was the smartness of the pickpocket who put his hand into another man a pocket and took some h ng out And the Premier s action in regard to the road vote of 1893 was that of a pickpocket How was the 1 Treasurer going to get on afterwards when his air ling echo of duties had been carried out? He had proposed a penny a land tax now the next year it would be a twopenny, the next a threepenny, and so on If alan 1 tax were nee Mary he (Mr Lyne") would support it if it were introduce t in a [proper way but he would not support it merely for the purpose of filling up the gap cause 11, the Premier in carrying out his freetrade money It any direct taxation was necessary he would support an m com- tax, which was the finest kind of direct taxation that could be devised as unW it the professional man who was mad as a large in come had to contribute He considered that incomes should be taxed from £200 and upwards. He had been attacked in reference to the Rhea s Creek work but he maintained that that work had been productive of great 1 benefit and the money spent would prove to In well invite 1 ultima only The land reclaimed was well worth 100 an acre and nearly 600 acres had been reclaimed-not C- as had been state! whilst the money expended had been only £500 000 not loJO 000 In carrying out the Ocean street tramway the late Government had accompanied a work that benefited the whole city the fallacy of the free-trade could be shown by the iron imports, which in 1891 amounted to £7%,t>3S all of which could be pro- du ei in the colony It was the same with boots which in 1891 were imported to the extent of 5 to 030 but in 1891, after a 10 per cent duty had been imposed the imports fell to £29 000 the only hope that adopd free trade beside them. were t in k makes, in the south faces All the great nation excepting England, were protect honest in their policy The treasurer was going to take off the sugar duties and throw 16 000 people out, of employment What- won Its To the rest It of the abolition of the grain duties It would simply mean that "Victorian farmers who had come to this colony would go back to "a record when they found that they could pour their produce into New South Wales duty free I am Premier had said something about his s hence to assist the selectors who were in arrears with their payments but to (Mr I yet) could not and stand what his p~opo al was nor did anyone else understand it we i h reference to De Lain con b nations of which Iii by had heard so much lately, he would I say that he would 1 never- follow a man who has 11 ever to see a union of pro tee the since he had sit in the House-a man who he had never lost an oppor unit) o: injuring that policy, a man who never stuck. to a friend who super serial 11 u If the pole toasts true ed to Sir Henry parkes they trust d to a broken reed Sir George Dibbs in. the rightful leader of the project onist party and he (Mr La no) would follow the hon. member locally Sir Henry Parkes had been the greatest enemy of the time for the last 10 y ice It he 1 a 1 not been he would have joined the Federal Council in ISS i If he had done so they would have been very close to federation at the present time He did not believe that the people were in favour of federation as proposed by Sir Henry Parkes The people were chiefly anxious to see the bo der t cities removed but what chance would there be or federation it New South Wales started by abar filing her duties He was certain that the combination of Sir Henry I asked with the protectionists would never bring about federation He would do anything he could to oust the present Government from offe because he disapproved of their proposals He intends 1 to oppose the increase to the fibre of the Chief Railway Comm nioner Mr 3 lady was too autocratic for a democrat economy like this The Premier estimate! to save £100 000 by retrenchment , but he had forgotten altogether to make any provision for the large turn in gratuities that we Id have to be paid to officers who might be retrenched 1 He thought it was unjust liable to expend out of the loan money £2,000 in the thinning of forests on the Murray, be eau so suckers would come up and take to the place of the saplings that had been removed so that the object of the expenditure would fail A bill ought to be brought in without delay to prevent waste by water flowing from artesian bores Val they ought to have abdltogi\o the State the first right to surface water throughout the colony Mr ROBERT JONES said that the ex Minister for Works ' saved ' Lllb 000 by dot saving the colony of the benefits to be derive 1 from that expenditure It was to the credit of the present Government that they had restored that amount they ought not to run after federation which at present was only a mirage, to the neglect of pressing domestic legislation The proper way to remove the proper y of this colony was by an interchange of its products with those of other countries Mr HAYES said that freetrade was suited to England, and to England 1 alone If they had free trade he o they would close every indus rv or drag the price of labour down to that ruling in foreign countries. The imposition of the duties on butter and bacon had had a most bent ficial effect upon the farmers This Government proposed to remove the duties on luxuries which were paid by the wealth or classes of this community If there was one thing the House ought to deal with it was the question of reform in the Civil Service, and nothing needed more delicate trout m cut Mr riGG said it was a singular thing that the Premier's Budget speech had been so systematically ignored by hon members? He felt physically unfit to proceed with this speech on account of the long sitting but he could not refrain from objecting to the obstacles thrown in the way of progress both by the Opposition and some other members who professed to be freetraders Mr HASSALL said he must raise a strong objection to the proposal to tax the land of the people. It was an unjust tax and a class tax in the worst sense of the word An income tax was a much fairer impost It a land tax were carried he would move that there be no exemptions made either in land or in com c5 Mr WHIDDON said that one would think listen- ing to the speeches that came from the opjK>3ito side of the House, that we had never had any unemployed before whereas during Sir George Dibbs a Government there had been more unemployed than at any time. He had no special regard for the Premier but he considered that he was the right man in the right place at the present time and he supported him because Mr Reid had the courage to bring for ward those measures of social reform which the country had been crying out for for the last 20 years Mr ELLIS said that their railways were not worth the amount they were credited with because nothing had ever been written off for wear and tear The Treasurer had made it appear as if he had reduced the deficit instead of which he had increased it. He had taken credit for estimated savings which it was by no means certain that he could effect The accounts were cooked " He thought the Government ought to be compelled to take back their estimates and bring in fresh ones on a fairer basis Mr GORMLY said he had heard a good many financial statements but he did not remember one that had given him greater drama is action The proposals of the Premier would be the means of placing the country in a much worse position than at present and he did not think that the Government would have a ghost of a show if it went to the country on its present programme The colony was not justified in opening its markets to others while they denied theirs to ns He was anxious to see federation but only for certain purposes We must not federate with our eyes shut Mr COPE. AND said that no good would accrue from prolonging the case further, and he would advise both sides to go to a division Mr CARROLL said that he came into the House as a protectionist, but] he would support the land and income tax were it not that in doing so he would be helping to do away with protection The motion was then put, and carried by 50 votes to 25 The following is the division list -.
