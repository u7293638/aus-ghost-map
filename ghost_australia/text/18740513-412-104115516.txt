" ITEMS OF NEWS. \- An accident of some kiud occurred to the coach from Hay, below - Currawarna, on Sunday last, and fclic mails were forwarded on pack-hor3es. The mishap lias caused in convenience to several gentlemen who in tended to have gone to Hay by the return coach—amongst others. Mr. Scriven, manager of the Bank of Now, South Wales in this town,'and Mr. K. Murchisou, wlio proceeds to Hay to take the management of the branch Bank to be opened there. Notwith standing the delay occasioned by the acci dent, Mr. Adams, the contractor, with his usual regularity, delivered the mails in due time. ■ The following are the results of the Hay Races'.

We allude to-the presentation i to the Rev. Dr. Birmingham, who has just arrived in the colony from Europe, of a pair of horses, a buggy, and harness. In giving the present, Mr. Cox remarked that he hoped.it (the gift) would show that Irishmen did not forget kindnesses done to them in their youth. , The liberality was fully ap preciated by the rev.gentleman. • It is rumoured-ill: commercial circles that Mr. W.

Bv a Melbourne journal it is stated that the jiolice there, took up a drunken inan to the watoh-hoiiso, and that they found on ■him no lessa sum than £1000 in his pockets. This might well be called most respectable drunkenness under unfavourable circum stances.

According to the Burrangong Chronicle, extensive premises in the town of Young havo been placed under offer to the Bank of Now South Wales, and it is not improbable tli at a branoh of that Bank will be opened at ; Young.

'{Fue appeal made to the Full Court by Sir John; O'Sbanassy in the cases recently heard at D^niliquin, does not seem to have frigbl - enedj selectors from taking up land in the namto of minors. For 13,587 acres were selected at Deniliquin on Thnrsday week. Of this area, 25G0 acre3 were selected by miuorA who aro tho offspring of a gentle man naiyied Ofiicoi-.

Ferrier, also a minor, took up 320 acres; six minors of the Kiu-Ha. fatnily selected I960 acres. This is a Viiffi cient indication that the people will not be deluded by misrepresentations. According to a European telegram sent to a firm in Sydney, it is said that a severe frost has almost destroyed the vines In France. One telegram says that the entire vintage is lost, and that the price of wine in London lias advanced 3s. per gallon. Here 1500 hogsheads changed hands at 9s. 9d. for • large parcels. Money is dearer in Melbourne, for we learn by a telegram that the rates of dis count and interest have been ■ raised I per cent, by the Banks in that city. Ouu contemporary, the Burvangong Argus, • has settled amicably its quarrel with Mr. William James Watson. That gentleman has withdrawn an action for libel on the defendants consenting to divulge the name of the person who informed untruthfully, and to pay all costs. Beyond and abovo this, an apology lias to be published, l'er haps prudence is the better part of. valour after all. Some of tlie Riverina papers, wo observft \ are congratulating themselves that .a start'i promises soon to be made with the railway between Sydney and Echuca via Wagga Wagga and Deniliqtiin. The foundation for these congratulations is the late proclamation; of a reserve two miles wide along each side of the surveyed route. While it is hoped that the intention is really to go on with.9®.^ line that would be a promotion of the best interests of that important district, we con fess to a doubt as to the reserve having any-. thing to do with bona fide railway constrnc- ; tion. The surveyed route was originally one mile'wide. The new proclamation makes it five miles wide. What such an immense alienation of Orown lands has to do with f" railway construction it is difficult to guess. The more likely explanation is that, as the line runs through Sir John O'Shanassy's Moira, Virgoe's Mathonra, Peppins' Morago and other runs at present being rapidly settled upon by Victorians, this reserve has been proclaimed by the Minister of Lands to balk selection, in the interests of squattfcrs. It is well known that the Land office is literally under the control of the liiverina squatters; and the extent to which tljis reserve system is being worked is something astounding. Every run in .Riverina has one mile wide reserves running right through it, at regular intervals, not exceeding two miles. These are proclaimed as for water supply, stock roads, railway routes, &c.; but under whatever name the reserves are ■ set apart, it is contended that they can only be used by the Crown lessee of the run, and all others, including selectors, are liable to be sued for trespass. Of course this reading is a gross perversion of the Act, and is ou a par with a number of other corrupt practices which have been carried on because the squatters have hitherto had no one to check them. These practices cannot continue in opposition to the remonstrances of the selec tors, who are growing in number, and widely increasing their power by systematic organ isation.—Age. ■ <_ News of Saturday) that Hume left Sydney' for Newcastle last evening. Our informant states that Hume intends starting from New castle to endeavour to release Glassen, and obtain Leichardts' relics on or about tl^^lafc , ' of this month. He will be accompanied^ye says, on his perilous expedition, by his nephew (also named Andrew Hume), and Messrs. Campbell, Tweodlo, and Massen.f"' Another person from Sydney has been asked to accompany the party, but has not decided whether he will go or not. It is said that the expenses of the journey have been raised by private subscription. From the S. M. Herald we learn thattlie Colonial Secretary has received a communi cation from the Agent-General, Sir Charles Cpvvper, stating that the ship Jerusalem would leave London oil the 25th March, with 312 immigrants for Sydney. ' Sir Chas. Cowper describes these immigrants as a very superior set of people. The importance of -* this announcement cannot be over-valued ; , for we are of opinion that once the tide of £T immigration to this colony sets in, the pro splects of its inhabitants will brighten, and the future be as promising as could be wished. We only hope that our Agent General will not cease to carry on the good wbrk begun. lA Melbourne journal says, on what authority we do not know, that " a new-v : claimant for the Coady-Buckley estate has. appeared, who alleges he is a nephew." , . 'The hunt after O'Ferrall, the absconder frbm the Melbourne Land Office, in Noumea has not been successful. It appears that the ^ detective seut after the absentee failed tcr succeed in arresting him, and has returned by the Egmont to Melbourne, disappointed. To account for the failure, it is asserted that the late sporting gentleman of the Lands Office has made so many friends in his new home that it is impossible to catch him. What a fascination Mr. O'lTerrall must borrow. i Those who are given to studying tbo habits of insects will read with interest the following communication sent by a corre spondent to the Scientific American :—" It is cdmmonly believed that spiders are able to project their webs to distant objects,' thus bridging over the intervening space, but how tliis is done I have never seen explained. Once I saw a small spider upon some pro jecting object above a table, before an open Window, briskly engaged in trying to do something, without seeming to accomplish his- object. I therefore watched him, and saw that, after attaching his thread to tho projecting object ho spun down four or five inches, and then commenced climbing his thread, carrying the same with hiro, or rather winding it up into a ball. Having reached his support, he descended again, and wound up the thread as before. , This he did three or four times, till his ball was nearly as large as the head of a piD. Then taking liis position upon the of his projection, he remained apparently motionless for half a minute, at the end of which time his ball had disappeared, and there was Been a delicate line, a foot or more in length, flying in the wind. Ho waa evidently trying to attach his thread to a liimp standing on the middle of the table ; but ho had miscalculated the direction of the wind. I then carefully broke off tho flying thread, when, finding that he had failed to reach the lamp, ho repeated the atterqpj^"> going through precisely the same'movement* ^ aa beforo. This ho did four or five times, when, doubtless concluding that the fates were against him, or that some' one terferingwith his operations, he left for parts unknown. Whether ho projected his bull -of silk as the sailor does his coil of rope, or ■^Whether lie merely unwound it, letting the tliin e'nd.fly in the breeze, I could not make out; but it '.z very certain that when the -flying thread .appenre;l,ltlie ball beneath his feet had disappeared " Tiik Goulbnrn correspondent of the T. anil C. Journal says :—" Within the walls of the Catholic Convent grounds in this city, the body of one of the nuns was buued on (Fridaymorning Masfc.vvShc. was the eldest daughter, of Mr. P.

It was in -1871'that she became a professed nnn of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, after two years of probation.' On; Tuesday morning, Dr. Lannigan, the Bishop ofrGoulbnny with . the Very. Rev. P. Dunne,1 deacon, Rev. Father Hanley, • sub-deacon, and Father Gallalier, master of ceremonies, celebrated the solemn requiem office, and high mass for the repose of her soul; but the burial was deferred until Jhc -next day,? at the commumcatcd request of her father, jwho' was travelling, for .the purpose of being present on the occasion." Oun readers (says the Burrangang Chro nicle) will learn with much regret that Mr. Thomas Burrett, of Euroka station, on the Bland, expired at his residence at 5 o'clock on the morning of Sunday last. His unex pected decease took his many friends in this town and district by surprise, as it was only a few weeks ago that he was at Young, making arrangements for the erection of a new dwelling-house upon what was consi dered a more healthy portion of his estate than the spot on which his late dwelling is built. His illness commenced on the 20th of last month;but no serious symptoms were indicated until the 28th, and on the 30th Dr. Barnett was called from town, and saw Mr. Burrett. The doctor.announced his ill ness to be one of low fever, but did not anticipate any serious result. Shortly after the doctor left Euroka, Mr. Burrett's illness increased, and assumed a dangerous, charac ter, terminating, as before stated, in death last Sunday morning. The deceased, we believe, was born at Euroka; that station having been for many years the property of his late father. He was born in 1842, and was consequently only thirty-two years of age. He was very much respected in the district, and liberally subscribed to every charitable and public institution in the town. A large cortege of relatives and friends at tended the funeral of the deceased gentleman, who was buried in the Church of England cemetery at Young. The service at the grave was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Sea born. Mr. Barrett leaves a wife and four children to lament his early death. Who wouldn't be a banister of note if.the followiug is .true? and we give,it: on -the authority .of the Times:—-'.' Mr. Hawkins,. Q.O. (engaged, as our readers wilhremember,» oil the Tiohborne-cu7«-Orton case) lias been retained in six diffcreut election. petitions,: with a retaining fee in each case of six hundred guineas, and one hundred guineas refresher every day." As the arrivals from foreign; ports (says ■ the S. M. Herald) have been considerably less than during any previous month of the/ past twelve, there has been some reduction of the surplus stocky mentioned ia our last.., JX'.e cargoes received comprise.the Aviemore,; ^Jknda, Hawkesbury, and Duke of Abercorn, "from London; Dragon, from Liverpool, with general cargoes ; Beethoven, from- Mauritius, Twee"- Gezusters, from. Java, with .sugar Jeddah (s.),*from Java, .with a part cargo of .Eastern produce ; and R;M.S: Mongol, from Fiji, with sundry shipments of American and island produce. The decrease has not, how ever, been sufficiently great to - strengthen prices to auy appreciable degree, owing to the slackness of trade, and' goods: being forcod upon the market by Victorian houses. This seems to be a favourite mode of getting rid of surplus supplies when the Melbourne markets are glutted. Then sales are; made here at very .low prices, ;i Quotations .<have not altered very much during-the last- four : weeks, and hardly any article of import shows a positive advance. : The efforts now being made to divert a portion of. the trade of Kivcrina to this market can hardly fail to prove successful when the railway is com pleted to Wagga Wagga. ^ This the Govern ment purpose doing as speedily as possible, arid tenders for the extension to- Cootamun dra' are.to close next week. As it is useless to expect that squatters' supplies will be obtained from any market but that to which their wool is sent, it will be necessary to give as great, or greater facilities for its transmission than the Victorian Government offer. When this can be done by the Bail way Department of New South Wales, our merchants will be placed on an equal footing" with their Melbourne rivals, over whom they will have the extra advantage of a semi-free trade tariff as against an avowedly protective • fiscal policy. The experiment! introduced by Mr. Deve- . rell, of Portland, in Victoria, viz., a marine motive power and machinery, has turned out successful, and the inventor is likely to. become both wealthy and famous through' his discovery. Speaking on the subject, the . Hamilton Spectator says : — " News hps. reached. tlie^ colony that the Admiralty are making trial,of his patent for utilisingIwave 'power as a propelling force, and the. report is that the application of the principle lias' the effect of doubliug the engine power of, any .vessel supplied with the invention. Mr. . Bessemer, the well.known patentee of the process for manufacturing steel, is construct ing several' steatn vessels, intended to ply across the English Channel,, having the saloon cabin suspended according to Mr. Deverell's system, so as to keep the • floor always horizontal, notwithstanding the mo tion of the vessel, thereby saving the occu pants from the ddsagrdmens of sea-sickness. To' Mr. Bessemer Mr. Deverell has sold, at a satisfactory price, another invention of his, viz., that of the ' ship clinometer.' It ap pears, to be an apparatus for determining ^eyactly the angular inclination of a ship in a ^seaway. The ordinary method of ascertain ing this oscillation was by personal observa tion of, the horizon—a method which was obviously unsatisfactory; but this simple 'apparatus of Mr. Deverell's registers every \mbtion, and is self- acting. The importance 'of the invention is considerable, as it3 use will enable ship-builders to determine, after a few experiments, the form of 'lines' upon which to build vessels, so as to reduce the rolling motion to a minimum."

A law, how ever, thus interfering with the liberty-. of the subject, would be repugnant to society, consequently moral suasion is employed to bring about a precisely similar result,- and; so far, ■ it has been eminently successful, and> as to further success we must be content-to seek it in the good sense, moderation, and sympathy of the whole community.- Here, for example, are grocers' assistants, men: doomed by the present system of their trade : to eloso confinement for from twelve > to fourteen hours a day. Let any woman ask > herself if she would not feel acutely the mis fortune of a son or brothor or husband being doomed to*'this incessant labor and close, captivity. We venture to say that there-is. not a woman in the colony but would shrink from imposing such'harsh conditions, not one- but would.vinvoluntarily, exclaim that such labour was a shame and a degradation: Yet, absolutely, this is a woman's question, - for it rests wholly with the sex to set their faces against the practice by not only doing their marketing within reasonable hours, but also by taking' their patronage from, traders-who keep open establishments after the time fixed for closing'byrthe {majority of the trade.

If she would only fulfil honestly that which comes strictly within liciv province, she would do much that would redound to her honor, and to the social well-being of many toilers in the community. The following' rather clever dovice of a : clergyman to coerce a close-listed congrega-! tion into more liberal views is related by A tticus in; the Leader. .' He states, that ' -When the last ■ Melbourne steamboat was leaving the' pious' town of Lyttleton ; a clergyman brought the captain a large bag filled with threepenny bits, imploring him a3 ho valued religion to give him gold, in ex change. The kind-hearted captain, con sentedj, -but: asked ; his ;reverence; why, he • didn't go to the banks' instead.- ' They wouldliave beenonlytoo.glad,' said the. captain, 1 one of the managers told me' to-day he hadn't seen a threepenny bit for a -week.' 'My Christian friend,'• was the . clergyman's answer, ' it is for" that very reason I come to you.' This bag contains all the threepenny bits in Canterbury, and when- I send tliern out of the country -my flock will have to fall hack" on sixpences.' It would- have to be a-good' clerical ring that would: put threepenny bits out of circulation - in Victoria ; but as it is a matter upon which the, denominations - can . unite, the thing" is not impossible. The Heraldis' responsible for the follow ing : — " The Victorian Government, it is stated,: are fully alive to the fact that it is Jiy no means improbable that very soon after the meeting of. Parliament they will have to retire from'the Treasury benches, and they are said to be already making preparations for ' giving their successors a hot reception,, when tbcy go to their constituencies on taking office. In one borough represented, • by a prominent member, of the Opposition, who is sure to be.a member of the next Min-. istry, a candidate recently rejected is re ported to 'bo 'making strenuous efforts to ingratiate himself with the electors ia,order, ■ i if possible, to reverse the decision arrived at by the constituency last week. He is liberal in money matters, and as it is believed that , he is not very largely endowed with this. world's goods :liimself, the natural inference is that the siuews of war are being supplied' by Mr. Francis and his colleagues." The American journals report tlie singular death of a lady spiritualist at Aven, in the State, of Ihew York. Misa Bonuey, they assert, became impressed with the conviction . that her spirit was to leave the body for a time and then return, and she succeeded-in convincing several of her friends that this phenomena would actually occur. She com plained of no illness, but on the 10th of November announced that the time had come for her departure, and after tea took to her bed, where she remained calmly . conversing with several friends until mid night. Mr. and Mrs. Preston saw her "several times between that and 2 o'clock. At this latter hour Miss Bonney ex claimed, " Oh, this is glorious !" and ceased to breathe. There was no struggle nor evi ; dence of pain. Of course the friends of the young woman marvelled greatly at the ful filment of her 'prediction. Although Miss Bonney's remains were kept unburied ac cording to her desire from the 10th .Novem ' ber until 5th January, her spirit has never reappeared. Oh the last mentioned day a cornoner's inquest was held on the lifeless body, which, of course, was in a state of de composition, and her death was officially established. Miss Bonney's brother-in-law protestedagainstanyposlniortem examination avowing his belief that the spirit would re turn to animate the decaying body, and several witnesses testified that the house had been violently shaken, as had been predicted, and that the clear note of a bull had been heard on several occasions, although there was no bell about the house exccpt the door bell. So far as the physicians were ablo to .etermine, the various organs of tho body showed that at the time of death they were in a sound and lioalthy condition, and no cause of death could be found. The Legislative Assembly in New South Wales (says tho Economist) passed a proviso to a clause in tho Sydney Corporation Act Amendment Bill iu tho following form :— " Provided always that 110 election shall be holden in any1 public-house, church, cliapel, or other placc of public worship."

Foster to give ■ him a seanco at his house. Several ladies and gentlemen wore there,-and the ghosts were brought ill with the filberts. 'Is there anyone present named George?' asked Mr. Foster; ' a spirit has a communi cation to make to him.' A newly married i man, who had before experienced the bles sings of matrimony, owned to the name ; upon which the spirit of his deceased wifo sent him a most affectionate meesage, saying:.. that she hovered o'er him, that she loved him as dearly as ever, and that when he i lifted the veil and followed, she would be the first to greet him in the land of shadows. The unfortunate gentleman had all the sen sations of a bigamist, and preserved a guilty silence, declining even to ask bis former wife how she liked her homeless existence. After an: awful, pause Mr. Foster said there was a spirit wanting to make a ■ communication to ; a gentleman >iinracd Robert; was he present?
