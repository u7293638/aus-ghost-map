THE GHOST AND TTTK BONNET. A mght or two ago I xvas sitting in this very spot trlmminga bonnet for Mrs Oâ€” , xvho is one of my regular visitors. I was making tho trimmings light aud fashionable, just suited, in fact, to tho timoof the year. As l rawed my head from my work to speak to the cirl, 1 saw standing in the passage there, Mrs C's son, Charles. I knew ho was confined to his lied, for he had bean ailing a long time. Tho figure xvas so real and flfu. like that I exclaimed, ."NVliv hero is Charley?" Just as I spoko the figure vanished. Ifc xvas jnst as risible to my eyes iu form and feature ns you are at this moment. Oh dear, no ! l\v;w not alarmed in tho least. I simply laid aside the bonnet and said, " Kate, I am not going to finish thu xvork. Mrs C won't want that bonnet." I knew from this littio ox'ent that sho would require to go into mourning. The vory first tutinu. tiou I got to-day xvas to say that poor Charley had died during tho night. Ho xvas a very steady young man, aud often canic to our meetings. "This faculty of seeing into the future," ahe added, "is the reason why lam regarded an such a good medium. They call ine tho prophetic mcduim."
