Ein Courier PUBLISHED DAILY. THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1871. A. prison of Parliament worthy the name must be one which has the effect of bringing into the service of the country a larger proportion of its best people If the Legislature has failed to give reasonable satisfaction hitherto, it is naturally to be concluded that the cause lies in its unworthy composition, and would be removed if better men could be added to its tanks or substitute 1 for its present members Mike what changes we may there must still eye? reman defects and grieVances, nevertheless it is fully to be expected that as we get better servants our service will be better performed "What then are the qualities most necessary in a legislator and for want of which our legislation and our administration of public affairs have been hitherto so unsatisfactory t What do we mean by the better servants whom it is desirable to get? And how are we most likely to get them ? There is room for doubt whether honesty, good sense in energy do not include all the requisites for the making of the most useful politician or statesman For what do we, mean by these teams? Obviously and at least they imply along with other things, that their possessor will not profess to serve the public, his main object being to serve himself, that he will not pretend to serve the vi whole community his real and sole concern being to advance the peculiar interests of the party or the place with which he is connected, that he will not content himself with less than a thorough devotion to the public service which he takes in hand but will spare himself no pains to get the soundest opinions, and to advocate them with effect take the wisest and best statesmen the world has ever seen-be they who they may see there has consisted their superiority to other men, and you will find then accomplishments to be the result of these common attributes of mankind, possessed no doubt an uncommon degree The fact may just say selections the reverse of complimentary upon those who have occupied high places amongst us hitherto, but it is abundantly consolatory as giving us hope of future improvement in our political condition If our legislators have fallen short of our requirements, not from the want of some mysterious faculty 01 special heaven-sent genius vouchsafed to few, but because of their lack of such common things as honesty, good sense and energy, they may take shame to themselves but there is a good prospect for us since ascertain that a fair supply of persons can be found amongst us in whom these virtues are not v anting "We might well despair if it were rich men who alone could manage our affairs wisely and well, for we have few rich men We might be downcast if, as is also a current belief in older countries the business of Government could not safely be taken out of the hands of men with along pedigree and blue blood, since we have no ancient families And we might fear that our case was not susceptible of rapid amelioration if affairs of State were of the nature of an occult science demanding profound culture and large scholarship, seeing that we have no, or at all events very few, colonists thus gifted and graced But we have plenty of people whose honesty, good sense, and energy are unquestionable, and if we can only bring them to the fore, and keep such men there, vi e shall accomplish all that is wanted How to obtain for the public service in Parliament a 1 larger supply of persons conspicuous for honesty, good sense, and energy-this is the simple question we have to solve, but on the solution of which our welfare and progress as a community very much depend The example of the mother country may serve to show both the truth of this opinion and the solution of this problem When in 1832, and again in 1857, the British people found the management of their affairs to be intolerable, they reformed then House of Commons, and in both reforms they realised the immediate relief which they sought Revolution was averted in the former case, and no one knows what troubles, but probably the loss of Ireland, at least, was averted in the latter. The whole people breathed again, and new prosperity dawned upon the land. Both reforms consisted of applications of I one and the same principle-the admission of the people to the privileges and duties of Government. They were in quest of the same remedy us we need. They wanted a stronger leaven of honesty, good sense, and energy in legislation. To get it they simply opened wider the doors of Parliament. The predicted " ugly rush " of democracy, overseeing the Throne and other valued institutions and confiscating property, has not come, but such misfortunes would seem to be further off than ever. The Throne is made more secure, law and order are more firmly established, while old and crying abuses now stand a chance of being removed. The British people believed that the voice of the people, the more it could be exerted in the choice of representatives, would the more certainly ensure the election of competent legislators, and so it has proved. It was a reasonable opinion, and it has been abundantly justified by the result. Unless therefore there are special circumstances which affect our case, we may surely copy so apposite an example. That is to say, unless it can be shown that our people are less worthy of the franchise, and of that fair distribu- tion of representative:) without which the franchise is a mockery, than the British people are, it is our very obvious duty to look to them for a new infusion of better blood into our halls of legislation. But who in his senses will pretend that as a whole our population is not a better popu- lation more virtuous, more sensible, and more active than the population of Great Britain. The fact is indubitable that on the average our people are more orderly, more just, more intelligent, more independent, and more given to think and act for themselves than are those they left behind them in the mother country. They are therefore more safely to be entrusted with political power, and more likely to yield good fruits of wise legislation from being entrusted with it. If then our rulers really wish to obtain an amended condition of our political affairs, and as a means thereto an improved Legislature, they will get over their supposed dread of what is called the " population basis," and make whatever measures they bring forward with the view of re- forming the representation at all events tend strongly in this direction, if they cannot accept the truth that for purposes of government practically " one man is as good as another, and better too." The Mar¿/loíoii<¡h Chronicle of Saturday last says " We are informed, on good authority, that Air Mr chibald Archer has been appointed Immigration Agent for Queensland in London, in the place of Mr Douglas, whose resignation we announced a day or two ago " [We heard this rumor before, but it appeared to be so unlikely that we hesitated to give it currency j A RATHER serious accident happened yesterday morning, in Queen street, to Miss Hunter, sister to Mr James Hunter, of Queen street Xho lady, it appears, was in the act of descend- ing from a Melbourne car, near the corner of Albert street, and when she was partially out of the vehicle the horse gave a move forward MissHuntor was holding by one of the loops or straps in the car, and when the horse started she was thrown against some of the iron portions of the ear, and had her arm broken near the wrist She was at once conveyed to Mr Davies', chemist, and Dr O'Doherty was called in and successfully set the bone No dangerous consequences are apprehended from the accident, and Miss Hunter is progressing favorably Nos 2 and 3 CosirANrES Q TI, met at the drill room last evening, for moonlight parade There was a good attendance, and Lieutenants F Adams and Snelling were in charge respectively Brigade Adjutant Geary was in command After performing some evolutions in the yard, the charge of the companies was handed over to Drill sergeant Pike, and they then marched to the Green Hills where they were exercised for some time at battalion drill On the whole they acquitted themselves with credit We believe one of the Armstrong guns is to be sent to Ipswich There is on view at Gowans' establishment in Queen-street, a very fine oil painting of our lamented Governor, which has been executed by Miss Myra Felton In most respects it is an exceedingly good portrait, but while it is a shade too youthful, it lacks somewhat that very lively expression which was so striking in Colonel Blackall But taking the fact into consideration that the young artist never saw our late Governor, and was guided by a carte de visite, the work is highly creditable Hts ExoEMENor the Acting Governor and suite, and a very large and fashionable, audience, were present at the Victoria Hall last night, when the humorous comedy of "The Serious Family" was performed by special desire The performance was excellent throughout, and the hearty applause of the audience testified their appreciation The inlonselyamuiing comedy of "The Middy Ashore " was repeated with great success, and concluded the entertainment j Mr Chapman again performed his wonderful feats to a large audience, at the School of Arts, last night. There was a change of performance, and the new programme seemed to be more attractive than the previous one "The man sealed up with a sackful of ghosts" completely "bothered" the audience, and elicited enthusiastic applause The " desiccated canaries " was also a very clever trick, while the " vicissitudes f of a bit of cambric" were thoroughly appreciated, and enjoyed accordingly Mr. Wilkie's really excellent tenor voice, in some of the most popular ong of the day, is also an additional attraction to this really excellent entertainment. An announcement in our advertising columns states that a public meeting will be held at Drynan's Ferry, Logan, on Wednesday next, to nominate a deputation of cotton-growers to wait upon some business firms in Brisbane, and invite them to become buyers in the district. We have received a presentation copy of an original pastoral poem, by George E Loy au, entitled " The Australian Seasons " The author Boys " The large amount of incidents which each season brings would doubtless have been treated at greater length, but the limits accorded to the publication of the poem at a cheap price) were almost too small. The author, however, has tried to do justice to the subjects and the space at his command and intends (should sufficient inducement offer) to issue a second edition of the poem, with various additions and alterations " We don't think any of his readers will wish the poem was longer. Twenty-two pages of this sort of poetry is enough more than enough to satisfy any reasonable mortal A second edition with additions" would be overpowering Nobody can charge the author with plagiarism Certainly a man named Thomson did write a poem called " The Seasons," about a hundred years ago, but that is on altogether different work to the one under notice From the title page we learn that Mr Loyau is the author of a number of Works "Leichhardt, the Lost Explorer," "Enowera," "Rough Bush YarnS Dark Scones in Australia " " Colonial Sketches," " Tales in Verse," so, to Under these circumstances, advice from us would in all probability be useless, otherwise, we would strongly advise him to try some other line of business Legal His Honor the Chief Justice has been pleased to grant a commission to take bail and all davits, is to Mr W K Macnish, senior member of the late firm of Macnish and Son, solicitors, who has resumed his practice in Brisbane. The Gympie Times, of Saturday last, says " The provisions of the Gold-fields Homestead Act of 1870 came into force on Wednesday last, and since then applications have been made, we are informed, for about 300 acres of land situated in various parts of the gold field It may be mentioned that there is a Uno plan in the Commissioner's office, showing the boundaries within which land may be selected under the Act, which will probably be of great assistance to intending selectors -The following are the latest crushings Enterprise 291 tons, spare ground, Moneklond (Gillespie and party), yielded 90 ozs 5 dwts The produce of No 1 south, Monckland, is being washed up, and stone from No north, St Patrick's, is going through Victoria -200 tons from the prospectors' claim, Smithfield (Couldrey, Smith Bros, and party), yielded 326 ozs A trial lot of 6 tons from the Chatsworth, prospectorS (Todd and party), returned 4 oz 14 dwts and 31 tons from No 5 west, Inglewood (McLean and party), yielded 26 ozs 17 dwts Stone from the prospecting claim, Monckland, is going through "
