C H A PTE R FROM 'HECTOR -???'???: .'MACTAVIS H : » ?'?? : OH. rilB SOOICIIMAM IN AUSTUAMA. BV DODBRT RIUOLR. It was some time before daylight when we were called; aloud rap at the door from the butt end of Joe, the mailman's, whip, made me spring out of bed, saying as I did so, "All right, I'm up — when do you start?" "ln less than a quarter of an hour, Sir. I'll call you before I go." "Very well. Hillo ! Staunton, get up: why man you sleep as if for a wager, or one who did i not expect to enjoy that luxury for a thousand years — get up, get up!" "I tell you what it is, Hector," said Staunton, quietly uncovering his visage and raising him- self in a sitting position in bed, "You make a devil of a noise in the morning when people want to be quiet; but at night, when one may have a little pleasure, and occasionally be some- what noisy, you sit with that sanctified counte- 1 nance of yours, as if you had made up your mind f that any thing beyond the Quaker's 'Yea! yea!' j and 'Nay ! nay 1' was a sin not to be forgiven." "Come, Staunton, what 's the use of talking? the mail's waiting, man, and you are not dressed yet ; we can argue the point when we begin our Journey ; and if you are at all inclined to be hot in your argument, take my word for it, tho morning is cool enough to keep you in good order, without any intercession on my part." The necessity of the case made Staunton slowly creep out of bed, grumbling all tho while about consistency of conduct ; never for a moment dreaming that the greatest inconsistency lay With himself; for who, in the miserable look ing, ill-tempered individual who now pulled on his clothes, shivering with cold, and the effects of the former night's hilarity, could have imagined the gay convivial Staunton of the night before : whoso eye then danced with good humour, and whose wit, always to the point, often astonished by its brilliancy. Truly, thought I, "no man is a hero to his valêt de chambre," or, to the friend who by chance may sleep in the same apartment. Such a sight us this, might well explain the cause of many a broken-hearted wife's complaints, and her seemingly unreason- able conduct to the "best tempered husband in the world." Tho rambling of tho coach to tho front of the house, was succeeded by Joe's calling. up stairs, "Ready to start, gentlemen." ??' Coming, Joe,' called out' Staunton,' who was now dressed, and followed -- by ' myself, was walking down stairs. ? ' I say Jou, we must havo ,our 'morning.'' Wher.e's the landlord ?' , ?^'Ihbed, sir!

He was lumping from one part of the road to the other, picking up even the minutest straw or piece of wood which lay upon the pathway, and care fully placing it at the road side. The rapidity of his motions were most surprising ; ho was here, there, and every where in a moment, and there was an intensity about his eye and actions as he performed his task which plainly shewed that he had no other object in the world but its accomplishment. , .... „ . .» ' That *s what I call an awful sight, Heotor, said Staunton, as he strained his eyes after the poor idiot, till a turn in the road hid him from our sight. 'I would give half of what lam worth in the world, to know what the poor devil's thinking of. Did you notice how his whole soul seemed employed in his silly task ?

One was an elderly gentlemanly looking man, about sixty years old, with hair as white as snow, he was Captain Cobra, a retired naval officer. The other was a stout, ? bourdley looking, jolly man. He was Captain Gudgeon. ' Both exceedingly good men in their ways,' said Joe,.' and wholesale retailers of what in the bush goes by the cognomen of ? stringy bark justice.' The two magistrates took their seats on the .Bench, the clerk blew his nose, and Con stable Myer (who bad run his horse aguinst a post, in his hurry to got a hold of Captain Cobra's horse), wiped the blood from his. The Chief Constable looked indefatigable, like one who had made up his mind to be master of the ceremonies.

', Buoklaw paused, arranged the few hairs on his miserable looking pate — drew himself up to the full extent of his lank figure, and made another bow. Now, it was not a common bow old Bucklaw made, but it was one of those prostrations, which said as plainly as a bow could say it, ' Gentlemen, I'm yours, soul and body — Walker!' At length he spoke.
