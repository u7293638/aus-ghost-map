LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. i By Late Rev. C. H. Spurgeon. "As many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God ' -Romans vin 11 1 Whither does the spirit of God lead His sons? Trust He leads them to re- sentence One of the first acts of the Holy Spirit is to guide the sons of God to the mercy seat with tears in their eyes He points out with His hand of light the idol gods the images of jealousy the pen clean and abominable things within our nature and thus The astonishes us into horribly Then with that same finger He points to our past life and shows us the blows the errors the wilful tins the sins of ignorance the aggravated trans KiOBSions the offences against light and knowledge which have maticl our career from our youth up and being filled with shame and sorrow we cry out for the ear of God that we make them confess our sin and no knowledge that if He should smile us into hell it would be no more than two deserve Dear friend did the Holy Spirit over lend you to the stool of repentance? Did He over cause you to see how easily you have treated your God and how shamefully you have neglected 50111 Saviour ? Did He ever make you bemoan yourself for your iniquities? There is no way to heaven but by Weeping cross He who never felt the burden of his Bin will yet be crushed beneath its enormous weight, when, like some tottering cliff 111 judgments dreadful hour it will fall upon him and grant him to powder No man ever goes to the chamber of the no to sentence till the Holy Spirit leads him there but every child of God 1 news what it is to look on Him whom he was pick ed and mourn for his sin You must have repentance, for repentance is also lutely necessary to the Du ino lift 1 v copy ye repent ye shall all likewise perish The prodigal must or rather I have sinned " the publican must smile on his breast and 111 my God be merciful to me a sinner When a man has his face towards Jesus his back is necessarily turned on his sins Dear friends has the Spirit ever made the Lord Jesus glorious 111 your eyes? Breth ron and sisters this is the one point above all others if the Holy Ghost has never made Christ precious to you you know nothing about Him if He has not lifted Jesus up and sunk your own confid ones if He has not made you feel that Christ is all you want it and Ihntmoie than all in Him you find them He lins novel wrought a divine change 111 your heart Repentance and Tail is must stand going upon the bleeding Saviour 01 else Hope will never join them and bung Peace as his companion The children of God are led not only into knowledge but into love They are brought to feel the warmth of love as well as to see the light of truth The Spirit of God causes every true born son of God to burn with love to the rest of the family He who is a stranger to Christian love is a stranger to Divine grace Brethren we have our disputes for five dwells where it must needs be that offences come but we would be slow to take offence and Blower still to give it for we are one in Christ Jesus and our hearts are Line together by His Spirit The Holy Spirit leads us into intense love for the souls of sinners The devil has more to do with some men s pitiless theology than they imagine Christ weeps over the sinner s doom may the Lord save us from thinking of it in any other spirit. He who does not love his follow man whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not soon Does God look with complacency upon the men of our luce? Did we not love mon so well that He gave His only begotten Son for them? And will He have His own children cold stoical, and indifferent to the loss of human souls? Beloved if we dwell with Cain and city Am I my brother's keeper the Spirit of God never led us there. leads us into ten dorness sympathy and tearful effort if by any means we may save some Tur thor the Spirit of God leads the sons of God into holiness I shall not attempt to define what holiness is That 19 best seen in the lives of holy men can it be seen in your lives If I see a man lay ing as Christ would have lived loving and tender, fearless brave honest in all things minding to keep a good conscience before God and men I hope that the Spirit of God has led him if I see that man devout before his God and full of integrity before his follow men, thou I hope that the Spirit of God is his leader and influences his character. The fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness, temperance against such there is no law And they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts 2 How does the Spirit lead the sons of God? One great instrument which the Holy Ghost used upon the mind is the Word of God The word as we have it printed in the Bible is the great instrument, in the hand of the Spirit for lending the children of God in the light way If you want to know what you ought to do Bay as the old Scotchman used to say to his wife Roach down on Bible That is the map of the way, the heavenly pilgrims knapsack guide and if you are led by the Word of God the Spirit of God is with the Word and works through it and you are led by the Spirit of God TI 0 Spirit of God also speaks through His ministers May God grant that the ministry which you usually attend may be to you the voice of God May it be guidance to your foot comfort to your heart invigoration to your faith and re freshness to your soul and while you are sitting in the house of prayer and you feel That word is for me I came here not knowing what to do but I have received direction 1 was faint and weary but I have one inch consolation and strength the voice of the preacher has been as the oracle of God to my soul and now I go my way comforted 3 When does the Spirit lend the sons of God? Ah brethren that question needs anxious answering The Spirit of God would always lead the soul of God but alnBl there are times when even children of God will not be led they are wilful and headstrong and start aside The healthy condition of a child of God is to be always led by the Spirit of God May I this led by the Spirit every day not on Sundays only nor alone but periods set apart for prayer but during every minute of every horn of every day It you have a guide along an intricate path way, and you allow him to conduct on for half an hour and then any, Now I shall direct myself for the next five minutes ' 111 that short space j 011 will lose the benefit of having a guide at all It is clear that a pilot who only o n sionally directs the ship is very little better than none If you were traversing an unknown and difficult pathway I would render all directions useless if you were to Bay They told me to his 11 to the right at this corner but I 11 can be li J the left That one turning will affect the whole of join after journey If we are and are really sons of God our Divine Lender will make us retrace our steps with bitter tears and feel what an evil and bitter thing it is to have chosen our own delusions If we use our Divine Loader wisely we shall always follow Him near what God speaks 111 the 111 apired volume and if no light comes from thence kneel down and play When you see a sign post 111 a country road and it tells you which way to go you are fit (1 to follow its directions but if in your poiploMties you see no sign post what are you to do? Pray Cast your self upon the Divine guidance and you shall make no mistake Beloved the Lord will never let a vessel be dashed upon the rocks whoBO tiller has been gone into His hands Give up the helm to God and your barque will tread the narrow that not of life avoid every sunken rock and arms safely in harbour Am I a child of God? if he I am led by the Spirit Am I led by the Spirit? I am afraid Some persons never think of that muller By whom are we lod? Hundreds of 10 ligious people are led by their minister 01 by a Christian friend and so far so good for them but their religion will be a failure unless they are led by the Spirit Are you led by the Spirit? if you are you are a child of God and if not you are none of Ilia Ah there is toilsome tion If you are a child of God you will be led by the Spirit Are you in doubt? Are you ombanaBacd Are you in di ID culties? Then the sons of God are led by the Spirit and you will be led Perhaps you are looking a long way ahead and you are afraid of difficulties in your old age or at the death of a relative Now God has not given us eyes to pry into the future and w had in the use of our poor | ing where we cannot see' Leave it all to your heavenly Father 1 and you will be unerringly led by the Holy Ghost I lion there is an assurance If led by the Spirit you are most certainly a ton of God Can you say I decided in., self up to the ours will I in not p 1 feet-I y ish by one I am burdens I 1 with a thousand infirmities; but yet if the Lord will teach me I am willing to learn if He will 1 save patience with me I will strive to follow Him Oh y hat would I give to be perfectly holy I long to be pure within I wish above all things 1 0 in this world that I may never grieve my God but walk with Him in the light as He is in the light and into fellowship with Him while the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanse me from all sin P My brother be well assured that none ever longed like that but a child of God
