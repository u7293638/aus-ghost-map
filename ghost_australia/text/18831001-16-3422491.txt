What, then, had interest) him to come forward voluntarily in defence of this monster' He asked the question of himself aloud, and he answered it aloud-A reverence for justice It consoled him somewhat He had not indulged in self deception when he declared to Gautrans judges that the leading principle of his life had been a desire for justice in small matters as well as great-for the meanest equally with the loftiest of his fellow creatures What it did not clash with his ambition was his good fortune It was not granted because of this human coincidence So far, then, he was justified in his own estimation But he must be justified also in the eyes of the world, and here intruded the torturing doubt whether this were possible. If he made it known to the world that Gautran was guilty, the answer would be, ""We know it and knew it as we believe you yourself did while you were working to set him free why did you prevent justice being done upon murderer' ' "But I believed him some centres would say, only now do I know him liberality' "Uponwhatgiounds would he asked ' Upon Gautrans own confession given to me alone, on a lonely road within an hour after the delivery of the vehicle He saw the incredulous cloaks with which this would be received He put himself in the place of the public, and he asked, W% at such a time on such a spot, did Gautran confess to you' What motive had he Ye have not a priest, and the high sand is not a ton fessional He could supply to this question no answer er which common sense would accent and, say that Gautran was questioned, as he would assuredly be, he would deny the state mont point Wauk Liberty is sweet to all me i Then it would be one man's statement against another a, it. would be on an equality with Gautama "danced to his level, and in the judgment of>n*nnbers of people-Gautran would have the advantage over him Sides would be taken he lnatHelf in a certain wise would he placed upon his trial, and public resentment which now w s? mothered, and would soon be quite hushed would break out against him Was he strong enough to withstand this' Could he arrest the furious torrent which would set towards him could he overcome it- could be drive it back, and stand in wounded on the short pure and scathe the eyes of many He doubted He was too profound a student of human nature not to know that his few fame would be blotted and that there would be a stain upon his reputation which would cling; to him to the last day of his life Still he questioned himself, " Should he dare it, and brave it and bow his head '' Who humbled himself lays himself open to the blow, and men are not merciful when the chance is I offered to them But he would stand clear in has own eyes, his conscience would approve lib none but himself would tins he known inward approval handsome reward, his sole compensation A heroic work, however' for a moment or two he glared at the contemplation The soon cooled down and with a smile, partly of self pity, partly of self despised, proceeded to the calmer consideration of the matter "Elie meaner qualities came into play The world did not know What reason was there that it should be enlightened that he should enlighten it to his own injury' 'The scene belonged to two men-to himself and Gautran It was not likely Gautran would Sturt it out to others, he valued his liberty too dearly So that it was as safe as though it were buried in a deep grave As for-the wrong done, it was a a silent wrong To rum. oneself for a sentiment would be madness, no one really suffered The unfortunate girl was at rest She was a stranger, no person know her, ones interested in her, except for her beauty, she left no family-no father, mother, or sisters to mourn her cruel death fire was certainly the woman spoken of as Pauline, but she had disappeared, and was probably in no way i dated to Madeline What more likely than that the elder woman's association with the younger arise out of a desire to trade upon the girls beauty and appropriate the profits to his own use' Abase view of the matter," but until at, human And having leased a certain point out of their trade in flowers, larger than was suspected the u of by woman of thewoildlud deliberately deserted Madeline and left her to her fate Why, then should he step forward as her avenger, to the distinction of the neat name he had spent the best fruits of his mind and the first j ears of his life to build up To think of such a thing was quietism in the mud One of the two ends of Wiese reflections-that which for ct d itself upon him is the toughest and the most pi onment was contempt of himself for permitting his thoughts to wander into a current so base but that was his concern not affect' no other disease long is he chose to hold his own counsel the difficulty into which he was planned was not of his striking late had dealt him a h ml stroke , he received it on his shield instead of on his naked body Who would s 16 that that was not wise ' What other man, having the option, would not have done as he was about to do.
