STEAMER DEADHEADS. Visitors1 from Brisbane- The fact that this is not as free a country as some people would like to make out dawned upon Charles Manuel and Henry Scott this morning. It appears that prior to the s.s. Eurlmbla putting to sea these gentlemen took up a comfortable position, and while the vessel was ploughing her way over the blue Pacific from Brisbane to Syd ney, and tho usual collection of passengers' tickets was in progress, smoked their pipes and calmly informed the oaptain that they were on the free list. Tho captain saw no reason why they should bo deadheads any more than others on board, so on arrival in Sydney ho had them landed before Mr. Dolohery in tho dock of the Water Police Court, and this morning, as they could not give the ghost of an explanation of their conduct, they were asked to part with Â£3 eaoh or go to Darlinghurst Gaol for 21 days.
