WHERE ARE THE CAPITALISTS ? XO XEB EOHOB. Sir— It is quite evident tnat * B.A.' must ' bide a wee ' before he finds a capitalist to build him a house. The 'minions of fortune and the worms of the hoar' do not. in fast, quite see it. Ho yonr courteous correspondent -JLatd Agent' I can only point oat that I have not asserted that the income and land toxes ue « very, heavy .indeed.'' I nierely snowed tneir results, tie is, therefore, fighting a ghost raised by himselt Of yaor otbet correspondent, 'William Harper,' I ask Why, my dear William, should a capitalist's gains be called 'ill gotten?' May they noVbe as honest aB the earnings of those ' who are dependent for their own living' apoatbem? Or does the hardship lie in tha words 'their own earnings,' and would it be re. moved if those who think with youc correspondent could live on the 'eara- irjgB' and property of others? This, it,may be remembered, was thought desirable by thoBe estimable gentlemen— Bill Sykea and Silas Wegg, ; Is Adelaide to .bepome a robber's shrine 3 It is only a ' community' ol banotta that would seekto appropriate tbe hwdry won ???eareiBgb' of others for the benefit of thinking , mcB-witb opinions like those of your corres pondent. There is plenty of land ia South Austraiia quite as attractive as was AdeJssie Iand-eonre:40or50 yean ago, forrpeopte who earn tbeir own living?, -and who may- thus, . like a minority of the old pioneers, and without their hardships, become hateful capitalists, onle»e indeed their 'Ulgotten' gaia» are ap propriated by a ** community' of 'William . Harper's.' It ju't occurs tome that ^poritips even ' William Harper' would object to other : people's lmngs being dependent upon ihis eamiDftS— which, however, by his aueriion, belong to the ' community' as do .also! hU clotheB. — Iam,.&ca; A CAPITALIST.
