The Neglected South Pole. Compared with the North Pole, that of the South has received but little attention at the hands of explorers. It lies, for one thing, at the far end of the earth from the home of enterprise, but the chief reason for its neglect, no doubt, is that, whilat bold ad venturers have been tempted to navigate Arctic seas in hopes of finding a passage to In ia and China, no such temptation ever existed in the case of the Antarctic Ooean; by sailing southwards mariners had no difficulty in reaching these profitable regions, The neighborhood of the South Pole, how ever, has not been quite overlooked ; and now that the North Pole has proved much more difficult of approach than was imagined, if not actually inaccessible, it may have occurred to some thnt perhaps tbe Soath Pole might become tho goal of rivalry nmong nations. Sir Wyville Thomson, in a recent lecture on theJAntarctic regions, states liis conviction that an attempt to reach the South Pole would not have the ghost of a chance of success, The farthest south point attnincd by Boss wns more than 700 miles from the Pole ; Graham's Laud is 1,200 miles distant. The intervening space ap pears to be a desolate region of ice, without shelter, nnd a great portion of it subject to to high winds and incessant falls of snow.
