Oh, dear friend, ;I am a stranger to you ; but I do entreat you consider this Solemn question to-night, and ask your self, ? Do 1 Idong to Christ 'i ' Some think it a disgrace ' to belong' to Christ,' a dis grace to belong to Him who came into this world to save us ; who died on the cross that cruel death of suffering and shariie ; who finished the work that God gave Him to do, descended into the grave, was raised again by the mighty power of God,, and_ who now in glory is a Prince'; arid Saviour. A disgrace to belong to Him'!.' ,i Is it not ;an awful disgrace to be seen; drunk,tobo known as one who lives an un-.: clean life, to be heard taking God's name in! vain, swearing at and cursing your chil-i dren,:yo)ir horses, and your cattle % '\ That; indee'dis a disgrace. ; But to be redeemed' with the precious blood of Christ, and to* belong to Him, that' is a matter to be proud of and to rejoice in. Now what is it to ' belong io Clirist ' P. In the first place it is to know your sitis. forgiven. In Mark ii. we read of a man who knew: that blessed truth. V Thy sins are forgiven thee,' ? says Jesus. He -be- lieved the words ; but the , religious teachers were angry, and called it blas phemy! :'Many will tell you the same now, and yet there is an epistle which will bo valueless to-day, unless 'there are some on earth who know_ this blessed fact The apostle John continually speaks of- some 'whose sinSjare'forgiyen for Christ's sake;' and who were theriiiving. And there are multitudes to-day who belong' to Christ, and their sins are forgiven them for His sake. Secondly, ' to belong to|Christ ' is to have a'neio life in you, a;ppwer within frorii the Holy Ghost, whiqh enables you to over-'' come sin and, the Evil One. i: There was a poor 'Chinaman I knew in Burmah; ; He was a: slave to opiumsmok ing (a slavery worse than drink) and to gambling: He was given theNew Testa- ment, and came to near the preaching. He determined to, try. Christ, and alone in his hut, on his knees, over the Ne. w Testa- , ment,. he, gave himself to Jesus,, arid claimed this power from his Saviour. He became a. ne.w..creature_. through. faith in Christ, and' told me subsequently that he could pass the. opium dens, and^.gambling ?corners without tbeiri'g*' tempted by the .smell of the opium or the jingle of the lebin or dice. ??-(' ' ?' ' Thirdly, to belong to .Christ brings ?peaqeyinto ,-ypur. homeB, crooked things ,bo- coriie straight, and rough places plain. ' Fon/iihly, it enables you tomeet death without.- fear.

' rSoine years ago a medical student, ?$nom'I knew well, was 'taking a gospelt service in the ward of an infirmary in the North.

I am sure le heard me. for immediately a wonder ful, peace stole into my.heart, and it was as if Christ had spoken, to me, and said, ' Thy sins which are many are all forgiven,' ' I suppose you will be going home 3oon,' the young man said ' as you are get ting nearly, well.' 'I have no home. I loft my poor mother and father a long time since, and eamo to this city. I am an outcast. ?hey do not know if I am living or dead.' He found the addross of the old couple, and went down to see them in the coun try. There was the little cottage, with its neat garden in front. As he knocked at the door a woman with white hair came to answer, and invited hiin in. He soon found out she had a son living in a small town near. A little further ques tioning revealed the fact that she had a daughter once, but knew not where she was. : ' Would you receive her if she cm e home P ' ' Aye, that I would.'
