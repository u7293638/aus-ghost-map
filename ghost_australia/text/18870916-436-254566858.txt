IN RIVERINA. THE ROAD, THE MINISTRY, AND THE SHEARERS' UNION. BY TELEMACHCTS. *Tis very hard to leave Deniliquin at half-past 4 o'clock in the evening with a promise of wet weather and a certainty of infamons roads. " The Old Man Plain " lies right ahead, full of crab-holes, swamps, ruts, bogs, possibilities of floods in the coach, of capsizes, of stick-fasts, of " Torn out there and bear a hand to get the horses along, they can never drag you through." The coach itself is terribly prepared with more light than an ocean steamship carries—two great lamps with reflectors right over the driver's head; two more on either side—six in all. When the candles are lit they will throw a flood of clear white light far ahead of the leaders. It will be impossible for the driver to plunge suddenly into any trouble that declares itself on the surface. But what does the surface declare of the depths below, even in daylight ? " Is there anv water on the road ?" " Not mu-h —a mile or'two." "Many passengers going ?" " Plenty—a dozen at the least—*nd ail for inside if they can get there." It seems at the first a matter of impossibility to bestow more than six iDside—a couple of women and four men In the midst of one's own anticipations d of troubles it is impossible but to pity those two poor women, packed up for 14 or 16 hours travel in the square box of the coach with hard seats, straight back and front, and a handful of duty, well-trodden straw on the floor. One of tnem will eventually pull through all right; she is of the stoat old bush woman 6ort, with welltanned iace and hands She has known more of camp than city life, and will not make a fuss, no matter what happens. But the other is a poor flimsy girl with a whitish face and a fringe on her forehead, and a lot of doubt, which weariness soon wears down, as to how she is to bestow herself in the exceedingly narrow space allotted to her. Then we have city wool man, who has ventured out on a coach trip to Wilcannia ; a squatter, who has crossed the Old Man Plain a hundred times, and Bleeps or talks the journey through without the slightest symptom or discomfort of any kind. A bush workman makes up the inside party, and a company of shearers or bushmen of various kinds are Bto wed without. The horses and the coachman appear to time ; the latter mightily clad in woollens and oilskins, but with the brown cheek and bright eye which in pilot or helmsman or coachman always beget confidence. The garb of the man tells one there is a lot to be done —the glance of his eyes gives assurance that it will be got through. I am taking np a little space with this coach and its journey because I have a profound conviction that it is the last time my folly will ever lead me into such an experience, and a sincere hope that it is a trouble which will not much longer be endured by any travellers between Deniliquia and Hay. We started at half-past 5, well packed together, with the leather curtains shut down to keep out the driving rain, and an atmosphere speedily so bad that it could hardly get worse, composed of oft-breathed air, tobacco smoke, and chilly draughts creeping in through the crannies. We rattled and jolted out of the town, and came in an hour or less to one of the bogs. The good horses pulled us through in grand style. Amidst the gurgle of the waters, the falling of the mud clots, the " Dp, then up!" of the coachman, and the frequent swish and crack of the whip, we could beat them snorting 1 and blowing. They had frequent half-miles of this sort, with intervening patches of tolerably hard ground. They might be seen at every halt enveloped in a cloud of steam, mad-bespattered from ears to heels, with widespread nostrils and drooping, dejected heads. They were not asked to do long stages. It took more than 40 of them to take us through, bat it was hard, upkind work that ought to have been ended many a year ago. Three glimpses of the night will be enough. It is II o'clock. We have done 30 miles with four changes of horses. The men outside have ended all their singing and laughing and joking. The cold has subdued them. Within, the Btout bush-woman Bits silent and composed in her corner, the poor girl permits her head to roll about helplessly, and the balance of her body to slip or jolt into any position of temporary ease. My squatting friend has talked out all his memories of old days,- and eeems, with the faculty peculiar to bushmen, to be smoking and Eleeping at the one time. The other people look uncomfortable. I am becoming sore and cramped, and tired and cross. Where are we ? At the Black Swamp. It is a weird look-out- through the coaoh windows. All the light from the lamps h sent right ahead. We see only white water and black trees. The water holds so much clay in solution that it appears absolutely white close beneath the coach, grey 10 yards away, then utterly black. Far away on some patch of dry ground a curlew calls, or yells, or shrieks. My friend, who knows the road well, wakes for a moment, and says—" The Black Swamp. Queer thing, cattle will never camp quietly here There mast be something in it." " In what ?" " Don't you know this is the place of the Trotting Cob and Headless Trooper? A trooper was ma dered here and beheaded years ago, and his ghost r is supnosed to trot ronnd on a baldfaced cob. I never saw it, but I have Been cattle restless all night; and I know the drovers will never stay here if they can help it." Sleep again, and a chance to dream of the headless horseman, or to think about Bruuton Stephen's quaint rendering of the legend. Rasping of corn3, bumping of knees, collisions of shoulders or of heads, broken , sleep- for four hours more, and how then do we appear ? A candle behind a pane of dingy glass gives a dim light to the interior. Everybody is in as deep sleep as the circumstances will permit, rollling and rocking about in helpless condition. Very like a set of corpses, I imagine. " Descend and see a grisly sight, A vault where the bodies are buried upright." Stop. " Hullo 1 Who's awake there ? ' It's half-past 3. We're at Paradise Ridge. There is a publiclnuse anl "sapper"—a good supper, too, if we can master sufficient wakefulness to face it. Bat why do they call it Paradise Ridge ? There is certainly a good deal of Pur- gatory before you reach it, but when yon are there. "You can't understand that," says the squa;ter. " till you have been bogged out on the plain. I was dead beat ont there once. It was before I knew the country; horses knocked up, mud and water all round about, and little hope of either food or fire. A drover came on to me, and helped to get the horses oat. ' Bat where we are going,' said he. 'to-nigbt we will sup together in Paradise.' Blasphemous! Yes, so it was, but I forgave him when we got- up on this Paradise ridge, with dry warm sand beneith us, and a roaring fire on the sheltered side." Little of Paradise do we see in the coachonly a few sharper jolts than ordinary, with a glimpse of one or two trees, and then, the mud and water, and painful monotony, mile after mile, hour after hour. Seven o'clock. A grey morning reveals all the dismal country, and the musty discomfort within. We are more packed than ever, for a poor saturated half-frozen fellow from the roof has declared with much bad temper and strong language, that though the " coach busts," he will not "perish for another 30 miles," and has squeezed Limself in, and packed the two women together in an indiscriminate heap. It is neither cold or hot in the coach Generally one feels warm and nasty, somewhat as a sbeep must feel after dipping ; but there are cold streaks about one's body where the raughts have effected permanent chills. Dull pain in eyes and forehead, too, and a soreness of the throat. Let us be done with it. Two hours and a half more, 16 hours in all, and we are turned out in the street of Hay, at the door of one of the most comfortable hotels in Australia. We can get a warm bath, a quiet sleep, if sleep will come in such unfamiliar circumstances, and must needs turn out with all the rest of the town in the warm and cheery afternoon to note the arrival of the N.S.W. Ministers. They ha\e been trave'liug all the West, studying the rabbit. question, and the land question, and the railway question, and are supposed to have gained a lot of information which will be useful by-and-by, They come driving along the main street about 4 o'clock, with a cavalcade before »nd behind. The Minister for Mine', Mr. Abigail, who introduced himself to the world by his detection of the railway frauds ; the Minister for Justice, Mr. William Clarke, who went out into the corridor with a member of the late Ministry with intent to proceed from justice to execution in summary fashion. It is the Minister for Mines's trip, and as he has been journeying through country which has been all developed by Victorian energy, and , is now worked by Victorian capital, and educated, moreover, with Victorian newspapers, it seems to me a reasonable and necessary matter to obtain from him a few impressions or opinions— to understand what he has learned, in fact—and, if possible, what he thinks The little gentleman is quite approachable, though clothed with new and unfamiliar dignity. A little bit timid ; he has not come out" to express opinions, but to gather information." That is natural and satisfactory of course, and what every Minister ought to do ; but what generally strikes one in interviewing any Sydney man returning from ont West is, not how much he has learned, but how deplorably ignorant he must Have been when he set out. I was quite sure that Mr. Abigail would tell me that he did not intend to express any opinion, and equally sure that 1 should be able to chronicle opinions—or impressions which would have all the weight of opinions—be'ore we parted. A man must be a fool who can take the notions current in Sydney out into the Western district and bring them back intact— and Mr. Abigail is not a fool. What do you think about this question of compensation for ~ improvements to Crcwn tenants? Of course it would'be a breach of confidence to say what-was -thought, but Mr Abigail did Bay, and made no objection to the publication of the saying, that his views of the matter had been considerably changed by his recent experience. He had seen that the sqratters had many troubles and losses and harass then ts, and that their case was worthy of more considera- tion than it had so far received. We do not want to hear any more than that. Lot the whole of New South wales Cabinet come to the same opiniin, and justice will be done. The laudholders, the pioneers, and developers of the western country only ask justice, though any man who knowB them and their circumstances understands the souadness of their claim to consideration, assistance, and indulgence. Then as to the rabbit trouble. Mr. Abigail has Been the rabbit trouble and recogaised its magnitude, and braced himself to a noble altitude of " Britons never shall be slaves," even to rabbits. He has also seen a good work of destruction effected by boughs of emu bush steeped in some poisonous solution snd placed in a securely-fenced paddock.- - He thinks various paddocks can be cleared in that way, and byand-by that the country may all be paddocke^ and cleared. Also, he understands, as all meu oi practical experience have understood for year6 past, that the present methods of paying for scalps ani employing men to work by resulte, is injurious in' many ways, and must be stopped. And there is an end of bis views on the matter, and they are nothing worth. No man living could in a month of experience form views of any practical value in such a matter as this. It is a question to be given into the hands of a commission of gentlemen of the most tho- rough practical information and profound scien tific knowledge. Bush science, chemical pcience, medical science, all the arte and craft of Bport need to be combined for the performance of this work. It is no use saying the British race will beat the rabbits; they never yet beat mosquitos or—fleas. But the railways, Mr. Abigail—what do you think after travelling those tremendous distances ? Yon have came right in from Milparinka by Wilcannia ; /on have seen the diggings of the Barrier Rauges; you understand their proximity to Adelaide, and the wastes which iutervene between them and Sydney. You see also here, iu Hay, the possibilities of va6i development; and Melbourne, set by nalare just down there, and Sydney right over there; and you are a sworn freetrader and member of a free-trade Governmeut, and acknowledge the right of every man to bay and sell in the cheapest or the best market You have not been across the « Old Man Plain " in a coach by night, or you would know much more about it, but from what you have seen ate you 1 anything more of an Australian than when you left byd; nev? Not much, alas! Mr. Abigail stilldeems it possible to drag the produce of the Barrier Ranges 850 miles across to Sydney; still is not quite sure of the desirability of bridging that dirty, dirty ditch of absolute nndisguisable protection—the 014 Man Plain. Still is more dieposed to be true to the old motto of " Australia for Sydney " than for that newer and brighter and nobler and better of " All for Australia ; all for the common interest, to which Melbourne, and Sydney, and Victoria, and New South Wales must be subsidiary. Mr. Abigail went out to look at hospitals, schools of art, court-houses, roads, bridges, parks, and schools. Doubtless he was much instructed by what he saw, and certainly he gave much satisfaction to the townsfolk by what he promised later on, but I think that at a banquet in the evening he received a more liberal education as to the actual requirements and wants of the people of Riverina than through all his previous travels. The dinner was over, the usual loyal toasts honored, the health of the Ministers and Parliament proposed and responded to, and the district introduced. Then outspoke the voice of the district in most unmistakeable words. We have heard, said one mau after another, all that has been said about our duties to Sydney and New South Wales, and we stand fast in our attachment to our capital and loyalty to our colony ; but what we desire to experience is the loyalty and justice of the capital as displayed in actionstoward as. Here is a country fit for everything, and a population capable and willing to develop it. Down there is Melbourne, our natural market ; and at our doors 90 miles of bog, swamp, or desert, which ynu will neither bridge for us nor permit us to bridge for ourselves. If we trade with Melbourne and make money, we make it for ourselves as citizens of New South Wales. And as for your railway to Wilcannia and to the Barrier Ranges, what possibility is there of any retarns from it ? It will entail a permanent charge on the country. We shall be taxed to pay interests on its costsbe taxed, that is, not for the benefit or development of any native industry or re eource, but to allow Sydney to win a little trade from Adelaide. It was very straight talk, and it is much to be hoped that it will sink into the hearts of the Ministers, and influence the decisions of the Cabinet. But there is not much hope. Neither of the Ministers seemed able to take any large view of the matter —neither had ever opened his eyes and beheld Australia. If the Hay people really wished to get their railway made, they should not have kipt Ministers at all, but by some means have provoked a magnificent demonstration at Deniliqqin, and packed them off by Cobb's coach at night to enjoy it. The troubles of the road would hftve sunk far more deeply into their hearts than all the eloquent pleadings of Hay. Tjiey would have made up thfeir minds either nqver to travel between Deniliquin and Hay again or to travel by rail. 'When the Ministers had gone, there was time toj look about at the town—or city, it Bhould be said—the episcopal see add capital of Riverina. I'talked, as was most natural and necessary, wjth the (two good Sydney pressmen who had been all round about with the Ministers, and' thiey both agreed that this was a town which'did not belong to New South Wales. It was clean add bright^ and well-watered, and tree-planted, with roads well formed and metalled to some extent, though the .expense of metalling here is enormous, burnt , brick costing 24s. per yard, and gravel from Narandera 17s. 6d. per ton. . It had a good water supply years ago, while Baiburst folks whose town is coeval with the century almost, were content to go unwashed. It; is indeed a pleasant little town, and in this bright spring weather, after—or in the intervals rather—of the early spring rains, has elements of beauty peculiarly its own. How the sunshine warms everything in the early afternoon! The thermometer is standing at 70deg. ; the steami? rising from the saturated green flats, and a flood of light pours down the long, broad streets, making the berries on the white cedars and the brown twigs of the elms twinkle and shine. At frequent intervals between them are well-grown pepper trees, with heavy crowns of evergreen foliage, and bunches of scarlet berries beneath the leaves ; jackarandas, also, looking a trifle ragged, but later on, when elms and willows arc full-foliaged, to burst into plumes of purple or lilac bloom. The grand verandahed and balconied front of Esplin's Hotel will be almost completely bowered in them. With the banks and po3t office it stands boldly forth now, one of many good substantial buildings doing credit to the town and its people. There are a good many people moving about, a half-dozen squatters from near and distant stations arranging for the forthcoming shearing, and a half-hundred shearers hanging about the various hotels, a vexed, and weary, and disconrolate look on their faces This Union business is bothering them a pood deal, and they art doubtful if it will do them much good. One tall figure in grey, walking sileutly along, must needs arrest attention. More than 6ft in height, thin, stooped somewhat, hair and beard fast changing through grey to white, clad in loosely- fitting grey clothes, a great tilk handkerchief twisted about his neck in the place of the usual linen collar. It is Mr James Tyson, whose possessions are estimated at £5,000,000 who never married, and his whole life long has n it been known to drink a glass of intoxicating liquor, or Etnoke a pipe of tobacco, or enjoy a merry moment, or waste a shilling or a farthing. He has done liberal things of late years. It is said that he gives largely to charities and churches One of his latest gifts was of £200 to the Brifibane Cathedral Fund. It is rumored—indeed it is true—that the bishop wrote back remonstrating. The gift was too small aud inadequate to the donor'i wealth. The donor replied," Send back the cheque, and I will consider the matter " It was sent, aud is under consideration etill. Another figure in the street somewhat strange to the bushman's tyea is the bishop. The bishop, in apparel, compromises slightly to the exigencies or customs of the bush. He wears a felt hat, but loops it UP with tassels J apron, but not g&itera; He walks about the town quietly but"busily, and does his utmost to associate himself with the life of the people, and shed abroad all . the lustre which naturally attaches to his high, position—considerable natural capacity and large endowment of old-world culture and experience. Mrs Bishop, I am told, is still more active thani his lordship, and has taught the people of Riverina more of the necessity of testifying to their good faith"by go6d~wor&~lhan~lhey ever knew before. The bishop tplls me t|flrt the Union people are wrong this time, and as we propose to go to the bottom of this matter it may be just as well to make a statement of the present circumstances and the ; various events which have led up to them. • ,•,. First, then, as to how the Union came to be formed. Last year on some of the northern rivers of New South Wales some few of the squatters met together, and determined that, as bad season had followed bad season, and squatting investments had returned no profits whatever, it was reasonable and right that shearers should share the general loss, and submit to a slight reduction of their customary rates. They met, therefore, and agreed a reduction of 2s. 6d. per hundred, and advertised that this reduction would be made by all members of their Union. The shearers determined to resist, and formed a Union in Ballarat. A paid secretary was appointed, and a course of agitation and canvassing commenced. The majority ' of the shearers in all the calonies joined, and there were some slight conflicts, with varying results, in a few of the northern sheds With the commencement of the shearing season of this year,however,new steps were taken,a form of agreement was drawn by the Union, of which all the " Working Rules of the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia" jvere to be taken to form part, and thU;was to be signed by squatters and shearers. It is unprecedented even in the history of trades-unionism that any tradesmen or artisanB seeking employment should draft' their own contract with the employer, and it is also against the whole letter and principle of unionism that the employer should bind himself in any way to Union rules. Experienced Unionists never obtrude their; rules on the employers' notice. But it is pretty clear that the leading spirits of this business knew very little about either unionism or the common or statute law of the land. Otherwise how could they have framed and sanctioned such a by-law as this :— "Members on strike shall remain on the jrround, and not answering the roll shall to their be called names every to be morning. fined5b." Members What would be the thought of the Union leaders in Melbourne who would order men on strike to remain within any factory. Such a bylaw attached to the rules of any society shows an utter ignorance of the commonest facts of life and work; yet there it stands in thfe documents of the society, signed and attested by president and vice-presidents, treasurer, and secretary. When blind lead blind in this fashion it is tolerably certain that both will fall into the ditch, . and I fancy, the ditch; . has already been found, at least on the Murrumbidgee The Union has raised difficulties where none before had existed, and Union men have deliberately broken' agree- ' ments Which were entered into with full knowledge and in good faith on both sides. I : know all about the " mean Bqaatters " of the colonies, the " raddling " and " running," the exorbitant rates for rations, and, as I think, foolish and nnnecessary attempts to reduce wages. All these things constituted grievances, but instead.of attempting to redress those grievances, but instead of Union leaders, seeing doubtless their, own advantage in any conflict^ having sought to place practically insurmountable difficulties £u the way of' cordial agreement between the squatter and the Bhearer. As things ptaiid now, the leading squatters and the steady and trustworthy shearers are in perfect accord all down the Murrumbidgee. There is no difficulty whatever about rates or accommodation, or 1 quality of work required, or fines or penalties, or any matter whatever; but the 1 agitators and controllers of the Union have manufactured a fetish in the shape of their agreement,'and tihe men fall down aud worship or run blindly after it, to their own loss and injury, the hindering of much necessary work, and the serious disarrangement and delay of the commerce and progress of the colony. I am going to Mungadel to-morrow to witness a roll-call, and, it may be, a fight.
