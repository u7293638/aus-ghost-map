A GHOST STORY. BY K, 0. , IN TWO PARTS. Part I. As the world grows older and presumably wiser there is a curious reaction against that blatant materialism. which, following outrages which peopled every dark wood and blood stained ruin with the creatures of their super station rushed to the opposite extreme by absolutely deny ing the existence of the super natural The philosophers whose boast is that they believe in the reality of nothing which they cannot prod with a stick may be still in a majority), but I hope that the story I am GOing, to tell will not be incredible to the more intelligent of those who read it J bird was a time when I disbelieved in ghosts myself, but since the logic, of facts has been too strong for my preconceptions I have been forced to evolve a theory, crude enough perhaps but which at least affords to me a plausible explanation of their appearance It is a common belief that the mind or soul has an existence of some kind after death last existence must be one of con oUnt thought are in fact for the day embodied spirit must consist of thought alone while as it retains any resemblance to the living human mind, the materials of its thought must be largely supplied by the bodily senses Hence they would naturally dwell much on the past in which the organs of sensation const nitly provided subjects for the higher consciousness to combine and work up into conceptions or ideas Now if the soul has left the body by suicide or violent death, in fact under any circumstances which might cause a concentration of its highest energies into the few minutes or seconds left to it before escaping from its matter of visitors, it is probable that its best moments upon earth and the circumstances under which it lest it should be engraved upon its mernoo, and form the subjects of some of its most intense thoughts in the future Even in iteiiitlists given grudging assent to the possibility of one strong mind acting upon another without bodily aid, and surely we may not unreasonable go one step further and! believe that the mind of one dead may emu! to) convey impressions to the living A man approaches the scene of some to ready, and the thoughts of the spirit dwelling passionately upon it impose themselves upon his mind and bring it all before his mental vision, so that he may see the knife drawn across the throat of the suicide or the despair ing gaze of the victim upon the countenance of his murderer Such, at least, is my belief, and I know that I have experienced such an imposition of a spirit mind upon my even Though it all happened many years ago the circumstances are such that I do not feel justified in mentioning the names of the places or people connected with them even to give a greater appearence of truth to the echo In my undergraduate days at Oxford I became

The room was soon thoroughly lighted, and a careful search made for the body or any other traces of the unfortunate occupant, but without any result A pool of blood alone remained of what not an hour since was a living man There was no more sleep in the house that night, and most of the inmates not finding their own thoughts pleasant company sat round a fire in the great hall waiting to see what light the morning might throw upon the mystery It brought no chu there was no one in the house who could he suspected of motives for such a deed, and with out even the body of the dead man to cure them the detectives were absolutely without I any evidence circumstantial or otherwise to lo upon the only person who could have hoped to profit by his cousin s death was Pierre but apart from his character which was itself sufficient to preclude suspicion, was the fact that he had rushed up from the library to join the first group collected round the door Hence, though every person in the house was strictly cross it as ninety and searched before anyone was allowed to do part not one want of evidence was elicited which could aid the funds cuts in finding the missing man, or arresting the murderer if indeed a murder had been committed The adair remained a mystery, and the house in which it happened naturally acquire of the reputation of being haunted amongst the mat instants for miles around the blood was washed from the Hotel and the story went that periodically the stain returned, us it the dead would fore e on the living the recollection of his mysterious death shortly after these events Pierre came to England, where, as I have said: he became a college friend of mine, and from him I learnt the facts that I have just narrated After he had passed about three years at Oxford and taken his degree, he received a letter from his grand father promising him forgiveness for his past offences and other ing to reinstate him in the position of heir to his property. It was a touching letter, saying that he had always been fowl of him and anxious for his welfare, and having ascertained from his tutors that his life at Oxford had been steady and creditable, he hoped that, as the only remaining representative of the family he would live as a man of honour should, and maintain the fair name it for centuries had held He added that he would be most happy to receive during the j intimation may 1 English friend of his grandson's and make him welcome in his house Pierre showed this letter to mc and, being anxious to see France in general and a house connected with such a mystery in particular, I gladly accepted his invitation to spend a few w ec'Ks at the chateau, and we may all there together upon Christmas d cm the} ear li> There were one or two other guests in the house, and they and the grandfather gave us a most cordial welcome to Prince. Pierre seemed a little disconcerted when he was told that he was to occupy his old room, which he would find furnished just as he left it, and that he was to forget the past and imagine that he had never left the family mansion However, in answer to his ground parent's question it he was frightened by the old woman's! tales, and would rather sleep elsewhere, he land no, it was merely that the; mention of the room had awakened sad and unpleasant memories, but that he had no superstitious fears and would prefer to return to his old quarters. I asked him afterwards if he would allow me to share the room with him as I had several matters to talk over, and I added that it there was a ghost to be seen I should like to see it. He readily assented to my proposal, and I fancied from his apparent relief that he could not have been so entirely free from superstition as he professed himself. AA o spent a quiet evening. Pierre seemed nervous and depressed, the memory of his cousin's death evidently weighing upon him, while the same subject called my thoughts, and I kept revolving it in my mind, caught me' impossible theories, and longing for sending to see for in) self if there were any truth in the rumours which were articles of much with the servants At last we said good night.
