A discussion as to the! propriety'of taking the line to.North Adelaide; instead of -taking it up to King William/ street via Mile-End was instituted by Mr. J. B.j Spence, bat the shareholders present seemed to. be adverse to the proposed change of route. A man named Neil SmithWas committed; for trial at th A Narracoorte Police Court on; . Saturday, July 26, on two charges of obtaining; goods and money by means of false 'representa tions. . The Narracoorte Herald says" He; visited our esteemed Presbyterian clergyman at his manse on the 5th iiistant, and after claiming, to be not only from the same country, but from; the same parish/ unfolded a - tale cf wealthy; heirship.' There was, however, one link missing,' which he was sure the rev. gentleman could; assist him in obtaining, and that was, unfortu thnately, the will. This was in? this possession of. a Mr, McLean, a missionary, whom the Rev? Mr. McCalman happened to know some years ago, and he promised Smith that he would endea vor to obtain his address in a few days if he were at all in the colonies. The amount he staged to; have been left to him by. this will was £7/100; but haying been deposited in the Bank . pf Victoria j Melbourne, nineteen years ago, it had' accmntiiated'now to £12,000., Meanwhile Mr. McCalman wrote- a letter, at; Smi'.-h's re-1 quest, to-Messrs,. Bright Bros., of Melbourne, askmg for abi advance of £40 for him'; this firm; according.to.the tale, haviDg knowledge of the bequeathal and of Smith being on an errand,o? enquiry... Neil was, however, somewhat short "of cabb, and. he obtained a cheque for £1 before leaving the manse. It appears that the prisoner went , to Mir. Cunningham's store and obtained goods to the valiieof. £3 13s. 3d, on the strength of a similar tale of expected wealth/and pre? seated an order on the Rev. D. McCalman for the amount. In due coarse Mr. Can uiagbam ' presented the order for. pay ment. The swindle was then suspected, and Messrs. Bright Bros, were at once communicated with to see if there !was any truth in Smith's statements, . hut they replied that they did not know anything about Smith or the money he spoke of. An informa tion was laid, and the prisoner was arrested on Wednesday last at Edenhope and brought on to Narracoorte. Mr. Assheton,,of the Commercial Hotel, was also a sufferer through his false re presentations to thei extent of ~£l 18s, He told the worthy landlord that he, had just arrived fron/home to take possession of an estate that had been left him, and that he had any amount of money,-but .unfortunately it was all in f Scotch notes.' ■ We believe that at a small town in the Western District of Victoria the same man had two respectable men arrested dn a charge of assault and robbery, but the cash completely broke down, the defendants proving anxili&i.-; One of these men was at Narracoofts the day Smith was locked up, and evinced an anxiety.-t'o see if-he was this same man/that wronged him. On going to the cell he; at once recognised him." . .* " : "A lecture on "Digestion and Indiges tion" is to he given at the CityMisBion Hall this evening by Dr. Thomas. >. • ,. i \- We liaive .received from Mr. C.
