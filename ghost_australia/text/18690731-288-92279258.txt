Muxnlet's flefence was, that his photographs were super natural— that the disembodied spirit takes its 'place by the side of the sitter, or hovers in dim-angelic outline overhead as represented by Ms mysterious art. However, other photo graphers were called, and proved that Mumler's ghost could be evoked in many ways— by a lens introduced into the camera, by the im position of a positive plate upon the. negative, and the transmission of light through- it in the batch, &c; Pictures were exhibited' in all respects as curious as Mumler's which had b|en produced by these means.' The New Yptk police authoriti«s certainly deserve credit for the exposure of a trick so calculated to mis lead weak-minded persons. - -
