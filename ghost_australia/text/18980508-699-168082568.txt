STTORNIS' PBANKS. ElBt— Onthe 2St» of last month a young lady attended at the trince Alfred Hospital, where her'Vhur had tbatmorning expired, and after »:i%ajing the necessary sad function!, left the building, when the and «anie other ladies inthe vicinity were startled at hearing groans End strange screams. Thoroughly scared, they tried to locate the ipot from whence the poises came, and eventually it was found to be some students who were making ths da; hideous with, their monkey business of play ing ghosts. If this is decorous behavior amid the surroundings of an hospital, the authorities hare come strange notions, and the. feelings of bereaved and naturally kind fttualai evidently count for nothing.— Yours elsfc 1ND1GNAT10.
