The Law Remained Intact. In Boston, Mass., they lately passed a law that no one should take a drink in a bar in a standing position, and no one should buy a drink without having first ordered food. The Boston Herald thus describes one of tho results of this peculiar law:— He was a stranger in town. It was Sunday night, and he was tired after a trip , on the "ghost train" from New York. He wanted a drink, but knew not how or where to get it. He was in a Puritanical city, quartered with some religious and temperance relatives, and he longed for the morrow or a glass of whisky. His longing was of short duration. Within a stone's throw of Scollay-square he met a metropolitan friend who had been in Boston before. Together they went to the nearest hotel restaurant. " I don't want to eat, but to drink," said the thirsty man as he held baok. «• Never foar; your want shall be supplied." The waiter came, and* the man who knew Boston looked at him with a knowing smile and said: " Bring me one hard-boiled egg and a bottle of Bass's ale." "Add a good bumper of whisky to that order for me," said the other. " I can comply with the order for an egg and a bottle of beer, but"—turning to the late arrival—" I cannot serve you." " And why ?" "Becauseyou should have ordered something to eat. Furthermore, you should have ordered it before ordering the drink. That's the law." " True," said the man acquainted with Boston. "The waiter has no alternative. If he should serve j-ou now he would bo discharged." The new comer had to sit while his friend drank Bass and put the boiled ckjj in his-pocket, to be thrown away when be deiirrted. As soon as the thirstjHeavcller j?ot ont of the dining-room he bolted ft* another hotel near by. He ordered a biseait, and then add*o:l, •And a glass of whisky," His thirst wm Satisfied. The law remained intact.
