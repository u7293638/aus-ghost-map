' which she had sunk, and induce her to start on ' a cruise for her own benefit—but, warmly seconded by Cora, bis arguments finally pre vjiiled, and ^before the spring was over the Esperance was sailing southward, with Lady Dunluce, Cora, Lady Seliua and two young cousins, naval and military, by way of escort. The spinster aunt had swooped down from a preat house in the North Riding, where sho had been making a very long visit to one of her wealthiest nieces, a lady with a large heart .and a populous nursery, and with whom Aunt Selina was an esteemed authority upon all juvenile ailments. Life ou board the Esperance afforded' a pleasant relief from the atmosphere of measles, - whooping cough, and humdrum country people^ at Waddingly Park, and Lady Selina resigned herself to the loss of a London season ' —thereby putting money in her purse—while she enjoyed the dolce far iu Sicilian waters, or in the Greek Archipelago. And so the spring months passed away, and in June Lady Dunlace and her party landed at Genoa, leaving the yacht to go round to Marseilles in charge of the naval cousin, to be berthed there till her next cruise/ and the three ladies quietly settled at Bellaggio till the end of the month, when Lady Selina went back to England, and Sibyl and Cora moved north ward to the Tyrol, for July, August, and Sep tember,* only returning to Cumberland in October. ' ! Then came the long, qniet winter, with friends tit bnt few, and for their most frequent visitor John Coverdale, from his cure of souls at Workington, where he was doing good service among thecrowdedmining population. It was a comfort both to Sibyl and Cora in ! those quiet days of autumn and curly winter to I know that Hubert Xfrquhnrt was not living at ! Lnnluce Castle. He had indeed been there ' very little since he came into his estate. He -was not popular in the neighbourhood; and he had frankly expressed his hatred of place and people! He had spent the winter after his brother's death at Monte Carlo, where he had achieved all he desired of fame by his success in pigeon-shooting—and the. society papers reported that he was at Monte Carlo this winter, also that he had been laid up in Paris daring the whole of November, and had been * operated upon by a famous French surgeon, the nature of the operation not being stated. A letter from Lady Selina who had been dis \- fdpating in the brief gaieties of a November session, informed her niece that Lord Dunluce had been suffering from a tumour on the face which was likely to cause lifelong disfigure ment, and that people at Monte Carlo found him very much altered from Inst season. An inquiry at the Castle, made personally by Mr. Olebnr, confirmed this account. His lordship had been very ill, and was still an invalid. He was expected to spend the rest of the winter at Monte Carlo, where ho had taken a small villa near tho Casino. •'He is your father, Cora, and you may consider it your duty to go to hini in his affliction." Sibyl said gravely, when she and Cora had heard Mr. Olebar's report. . "He is my father; but I recognise no duty where he is concerned—except the duty of _ silence." Cora answered, with a look so grave and resolute that Lady Dunluce felt that there was no more to be said. 'She knew enough of Corahc Urquhart by this time to know that the girl was not hearties^ *nd that her repudiation of all filial duty must needs bo based upon some sufficient reason. There was nothing flippant or reckless in the daughter's manner. She dismissed the subject sternly, with solemn decision of purpose, as a Bdman daughter might have done. Brooding over the girl's conduct Sibyl D trainee arrived at the conclusion that Cora had summed up the story of Marie Arnold's death, and believed her father to he the murderer. Some cause as grave and as terrible would-alone justify her line of conduct. It was a shock for the nerves of both women when they heard early in the year that Lord Dunlune was at the Castle. He had been brought there marked for death, Mr. Dewsnap told Lady Dunluce one afternoon early in March, when they met beside a cottager's sick, bed, about a week after the earl's return. V " Is the case really hopeless r" she asked. "I fear so. AU that surgery can do for him has been done in Paris and here. The last word has been said. X saw Tiim this morning, I see him three or four times a day, hat there is nothing for me to do except regu late the amount of morphia that is given to him. He has excellent nurses. Dr. Saunders comes from Edinburgh every third day; hut science con do no more for him, and the only hope of rest and relief is in the inevitable end of all things. Life can be nothing hut a burden to him, yet he dings to life with almost frantic intensity." 14 Has he ever spoken to you of his daughter?" Lady Dunluce a&ed;, when she and the doctor had left the cottage, and were walking along : the village street together. • 41 No. The greater part of his days and nights are spent under the influence of narcotics, and the realities of life outside his own room affect him very little. He asks for no friend, cares very little who waits upon him, values his nurses for their'skill and nothing else. He told mc this morning that there was a time when he wanted fresh young faces about him—» pretty faces for choice—hut now he would have Gorgons to wait upon him if the Gorgons were even a shade cleverer nurses thnn the pretty young women. - He is very often in a state of semi-delirium, and enacts hideous tragedies in a kind of waking dream—& common symptom when the brain is steeped in morphia." "Unhappy creature.1 Then there is* no hope for him. 5c must die." "He must die. And in his case no one can regret the inevitable end, since it is the only possible release from suffering.'' Sibyl wrote an account of this interview - in a letter to John Coverdale. ' \ " Pray go to him, and if you can torn his thought to God, and persuade him to confess his sins it will be one more good work done^" she wrote. Her desire was obeyed, and it was not possible for a Christian priest to approach the bed of suffering with more kindliness and discretion than murked John Coverdale*s visit to Lord Dunluce. The two men had met in the past, and Mr. Coverdale entered the sick room as friend; bnt here frieudliness was of no avail. The sufferer treaied him with savage insolence, and ordered him out of the room. % . 44 X know your craft," he muttered. 44 You sneak to my bedside under the guise of friend ship—a man with whom I never had one thought or feeling in common, and presently you will bring a little black book out of your pocket, and drop on your knees, and pray me into worse horrors than those I suffer now. I don't want you or your Miimbo jumbo, your Abracadabra. Go to your starving miners, and wash your worn-out jargon down their thirsty throats with soup and wine—they'll swallow one thing with the other—bub don't come here. Johnstone, show that gentleman the door, and if that won't do, throw him downstairs. I've no use for him here." He laughed a hoarse and spasmodic laugh at the American slang which dosed his speech. } Tpg eyes were deeply sunk in the wasted face, j Forehead and cheek were livid, and all the lower part of the face was hidden by linen ■ bandages. Lazarus coming out of the tomb ! was the image which dashed, in John j CoTcrdalc's mind as he looked in sorrowful reproach at that dreadful face, a wicked Lazarus with malignity horning hi those sunken eyes—a Lazarus summoned, not out of the grave's dreamless slumber, but oat of hell-fire Mr. Coverdale told Lady Dunluce that his. visit had been ineffectual, but he told her nothing more. He would not sadden her by any description of that bed of doom. "It needs something higher than human influence to touch that hardened heart," he said. ""We can but leave the sinner to his God. The only deathbed repentance that is not a sham and a mockery is the repentance that comes from within—not from without. The sinner may find God in his own heart, even if he has mocked at Christ's message from the lips of the priest." It was more than a week after this when a letter was brought to Lady Dunluce, sitting alone in the March twilight. The note bad been delivered by a groom from Dunluce Castle, who was to wait for her ladyship's answer before he rode back. ' She .told the servant to return in a few minutes, when her answer would he ready, and then she went to the window to read her letter by the fading daylight, while the footman lighted the lamp on her writing- table. The envelope, was addressed in a strange hand, and the letter was written in pencil, and except that it was on thick vellum paper headed with the'castle address, it was almost as uncanny a scrawl as that which the ragged messenger threw into her lap on the moor. 1 * The doctors tell me that my end is near. Yon have suspected and hated me for the last twelve years'. It may gratify you to know 1 that yon had reason. Come and hear my full confession, and if you want to hear it come at once. My life is like n thin little flame in a spirit lamp—sustained by strong stimulants, and will soon vanish into darkness. Don'fcbe afraid that yon will hear the puling and whimpering of a deathbed repentance. I believe in neither pardon nor pity. I die the victim of an inexor able scheme of Creation "which includes the horrors of diseases that torture and kill, damnablo maladies that no human skill can cure.. Do yon think that any man, doomed as I am doomed, is likely to go out of this life listening to twaddle ahont Divine bene ficence?" * " I shall be with you as soon as my carriage can bring me." : These 'words were written tastily, and thrust into an envelope as the servant re-entered the room to receive Lady Dunkice's order for her coachman. The light phaeton with a pair of horses, was to be got ready immediately. "Lady Cora has not comeinyefc I suppose?" " No. my lady." " When she comes, he sure she is told that I have been sent for to the castle. She is not to wait dinner." Cora, who had taken very kindly to riding since she came to Ellerslie, and who had been mounted in the best style by her aunt's liberal care, was out with the hounds. Cora was a success in the hnnting fields, where light hands, a neat waist, and indomitable pluck, tempered with common sense, scored almost as high as a j handsome face. Beauty blundering over a ' hound, or beauty getting in the way at a gate is not altogether precious to the sportsman. . The deeper shadow of night was round the gaunt gray fortress, the darker shadow of death was in the room, when Sibyl i)nnluce ap proached the rick bed, and seated - herself silently in the place which the nurse indicated —a large armchair at the head of the bed, beside those heaped-np pillows from which the ghastly face looked out, white as the linen with -which it was bandaged, pinched by the in visible hand which had set its mark on every feature. "Leave mc alone with Lady Dunlnce." The voice was hollow and muttered, utterly changed from the metallic'hardncss of Hubert Urqnhart's enunciation. The two white-capped nurses vanished through a curtained door that opened into Lord Dunluce's dressing-room*—where all the para phernalia of the sportsman's toilet had been swept away to give space for the apparatus of richness—kettles, and saucepans and spirit lamps, new inventions for comfort or relief, extravagant in price and infinitesimal in value to the sufferer—contrivances tried once, perhaps and never ..tried again—the dreary details of the history of. failure which is being realised—the failure before which the physician owns himself an * experimentalist, and the surgeon confesses that his utmost skfil can only postpone tbe inevitable end. Hubert TJrquhart •' looked at his brother's widow with a cynical i smile—a smile on lips contracted by pain. "-I thought my letter would fetch you," he said; " Fou have come to see God's judgment upon & sinner. You remember how Herod .the king.was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost i *—an example, of. God's -judgment, swifc and sharp—a ready money tengeUnce. And you j tbmV that this fool leprosy which is killing' me is God's jndgment upon murder. Bosh, Lady Dtmluce. Clerical spofflel There are good men and women all orer the world doomed just as I am doomed—with a pain as lingering with a faith as hopeless—Christians of purest water, shining lights in the darknesss of this world—suffering just as I suffer. When you, and such as you, talk of them you gire your God praise for the blessed example of their affliction, and recognise the ineffable wisdom that tortures and kills. Yon see me stricken down and yon exalt God the Avenger. Yon see no inconsistency in the hand that strikes the wolves and the lambs with the same rod. Came, own that your heart burns with triumph at seeing this living wreck which I still call ME.. A few hours hence the undertakers will be talking of IT." " I am as sorry for yon as I can be, rem em* bering what Brandon ITountford suffered." "He suffered—why his life was u life of ease and comfort—his ten doll years were no worse than one dull afternoon—measured against what I have suffered in the last six months. Don't waste your pity upon an epileptic, whose convulsions may be ugly to look at, but leave no memory, iuflict no pain upon the patient. He suffer! Keep your pity for the mail whose tortured consciousness no narcotic can annihilate—whose sleep has been-peopled and spun into seeming eternity by dreams of indescribable horror. And where do yon think those dreams took me—Lady Dunluce—what do you suppose was the almost invariable background of those hideous phan-% tasics?" " The wood where you lolled Marie Arnold r" she answered, her eyes looking into his, as he sat up in the bed, grasping her hand with his clammy fingers, and bringing his bandaged face nearer hers, so that she might hear the feeble voice. " You are good at guessing. Tes, that is the place where the morphia fiend takes roe He takes me by the hand—a little black devil with a mocking grin—his skinny hand clutches mine, and he drags me to the wood; and she is there—lovely, and cruel as she was that evening—in the golden sunset. Oh, God, how beautiful her eyes were with that golden light reflected in their velvet darkness. How cold, how cruel. Such hitter scathing words hatred of love—love of your lover—hatred that turned to loathing when I drew her to my breast and kissed her reluctant lips, and tried to make her understand that passionate love like mine was to be rained, or to be feared; • that if she would not hare me for her husband, and take her chance of my doing- well in life, and making a great lady of her, I would be revenged on her somehow. A love like mine was not to be trifled with any more than a raging Are. But she was so hold, and so proud. She flang me off with her strong young ann9. She laughed at my passion an£ my threats. She accused me of only wanting Sir Joseph's money—not really caring for her. She was so strong, such a grand creature in her strength and beauty. And I had a knife in my breast pocket—Motratford's knife which I had borrowed a day or two before—and clutch ing at my breast, beside myself with passion, I frit the knife, and remembered that it was there. You can guess the rest. You may remember that I was late for dinner, but that • I sat down with you and your father, and was wanting in no observance of a gentleman. It was not till a long time afterwards that you began to suspect me." Sibyl (heard him in silence, and remained .silent now when the bloodless fingers loosened from her hand, and he sank back among the pillows,, exhausted by the most sustained effort that he had made for a long time. His breath came and went in hoarse pant ings» his wan hands moved restlessly upon the coverlet, and those haggard blood-shot eyes rolled wildly in their orbits as he looked at Sibyl's white agonised face. "Have you nothing to say?" he gasped at length. "Kothing. God help you in this dark end of your wicked life." 4; You are not surprised at my confession?" "Xo, 110. I knew you were the murderer. I have been convinced of that for a long time. You broke my father's heart; shortened his life. ' Yon - spoilt Brandon's life and mine. And your victim—that young bright life— there never was a crueller murder. What good can I do here ? Pray to God for pardon. What I think or feel can matter nothing to you. You can restore nothing—undo nothing." "Kb; the past is past. I cannot bring Marie Arnold back to life. I would have given twenty years of my life to undo that— twenty years, did I say ?—I would have given all that was left of my life for one day with her—to die, knowing that I had not killed her— that the murder in the wood was only a hideous dream. Call the nurse. It is tim« for ray morphia. The pain—the racking pain—is beginning. I must hare my dose.

At last the end came—only a sinking deeper into that morphia darknoM—only the fall of Death** curtain on thm distorted memories of past xin. A gentlemanlike vulinre—fn the *hape of ah undertaker—came po*i haste fnrn Carlisle and took prH^wdori of that which lutd been Jfuljcrt, eighth Karl of Dunluce.

Tlie new Karl and hi* family were aware how much of their prosperity Utey owed to the Dowager Lady Dunluce, and they took pains to cultivate her friendsliip, and to be i:ivil lu Liidy Condic Urquhart, who had hoeii co unaccountably estranged from her father.
