REEVES; OR, "LATE, TOO LATE." BY THE GHOST OF TENNYSON. THUS pleaded REEVES, while full passionately His hands he clasped; but stern- browed Collingwood Made answer even with the dark refrain Of—"Late it is, O REEVES—too late, too late!" Late, late, so late! and dark my chance and chill! Late, late, so late! but I can enter still. Too late, too late! you cannot enter now. No truth had I: for that I do repent; And, learning this, perhaps you will relent. Too late, too late! you cannot enter now. No pay! so late! and dark and chill the day. Ah! let me in, that I may have some pay. Too late, too late! you cannot enter now. Have I not heard a billet is so sweet? Ah! let me in, that I may have my seat. Too late, too late! you cannot enter now.
