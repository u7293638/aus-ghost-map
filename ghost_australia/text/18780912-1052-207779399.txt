) THE P H A N T O M M I N E R. ) _ (A story of the old gold digging days,) ( " THLL-you a ghost story," said ray uncle Ned, a hale old ) gentleman of 70 years. " IVcll, I will relate a peculiar > aff.air that happened on Tallnians Gully, in 185!)." S We were all attention, and listened to the very remark- , V able narrative he rcl.atcd in the following manner : y " You must know," commenced my uncle, " that I and \ four mates were living in a tent on the banks of the river — living, I said, I should have called it existing, for J we were most unfortunate, only finding sufficient gold to \ keep us in the commonest tucker. After our everyday s G work, you may be sure wc were tired enough ; but we were J every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink \ of a pick, about fifty yards frbm .our caliyas home. This ( confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did J not cease until the break of day. One night wc were \ determined to see who it was ; so we sallied forth iu the r bright moqnlight, and saw a llgure in a coarse red flannel J shirt, high boots, and slouched hat, hard at work by an k old claim which had been deserted for many years. I was r chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger ; ) but when I was within twenty yards of hjm, I stood still, C transfixed with horror, — 'for 'the- wearer of the digger's / clothes was no living, intin, hut. n sheleton ." ) i" Uncle Ned I " we ail cried", V how fearful.". (. " One night; our tent' was visited by a handsome, well- V to- do., looking man, of . about fifty years of age, who \ enquired for a digger of whom we knew nothing about. . C He told us i.hat in '51 he and a' mate of his deserted from / one of Her Majesty's ships,"and started for the Tallmans -. S gojd'iields. They worked withr pretty good luck for a few C months, when the lieur comer went down to Melbourne tp / see about some letters. . ..Before he went, he said to his ; S matei';'Bbb, whatever you. do,, never, stop working the ; ( claim'foSa day until l come back.' Bob , promised, and / they parted. "I went down. to Melbourne,' said the ex- \ digger, 'and there was.arrested as a descrtei', and sent on f board ; and now that I have obtained my discharge, I / have hastened up here to find .my old chum.' _ ' You will ; \ see Him tb-night,' Isaid; but you'll find him very much ehang;edV. At midnight,- the everlasting clink of the ) phantom's pick was heard, and we;hll turned but. 'Ah 1 ' ) cried 'the sailor, 'there's -dear, old Bob. Bob, here I am back. " Bob, speak to me;'- -He 'ran to the figure, which | ) turned itshideous fac.e on him. With a.Jond shriek the seeker V fell senseless on the. grouhd. //TheVgliost threw down its pick, and vanished.
