Hope had sunk on her knees and kissed the hands which held hers, then he:- head fell forward, and Hugh sprang forward to lift her. "She is quite overoden, 1 ' "he exclaimed, almost indignantly. "She is but a ghost of her former self." And he placed her in an easy chair, where She lay with closed eyes. . "Happiness will be a rapid restorative," said Mrs. Saviiie kindly.

And Hope, if you feel equal to the task, write to RichanJ, inviting him io dinner to meet his new sister-in-law." "Very few fellows have so good a right to be proud of .a wife, as I have," cried Ilugrh, exultlngly. "Our old naval .stories of desperate cutting-out exploits are poor compared to the enduring courage that upheld Kate, as I always call her, though the long stcaiu of her bold undertaking." "She has enlightened me, at all events," said Sirs. Saviiie. "Now go away t 0 the drawing-room and have your talk out. The doctor insists that a complete change Is necessary for Hope's .recovery; so take your wife away to-morrow for your long-delayed honey-moon. But, remember, whenever you are pursung your profession on the high seas, I claim the companionship, Mr. Rawson's pleasant protegee." "Dear Mrs. Saviiie, I will be your loving- daughter so long as you care to have me near you," cried Hope ; and, no longer hesitating, she folded her formidable mother-in-law in her warm, embrace.
