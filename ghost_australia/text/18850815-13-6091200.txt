AT THE AQUARIUM. J B A. N. P. VII. EMULE FISHES, THEIR CAPTURE AND CULTURE. It was quite a debatable question as to what should be the heading and the subject matter of this our seventh chapter of aquarium brie i brae, if we may be name these somewhat fragmentary) remarks about aquarium like 'to have attempted to describe each form of fish of which specimens are to be found in the aquarium would have been impossible in the short space at our disposal and the result we fear would have scared) been entertaining If the reader will refer to the natural history recess at the Public Library, he will see comes upon tomes of compressed and ponderous teeth) ological literature, written by such men as Lacepede, Cuv 1er, Valenciennes, Johannes Muller, and Gunther, and will gain some idea of the unfitness of descriptiveichth)olugy for casual reading As in our last chapter we gained from "The Professor" a few of the salient facts concerning the anatomy of the shark, which is the type of an order known as stated gill fishes, of E'asmoln arches, so in this chapter we might have considered types of the body scaled fishes, or Ganoids, which, however, are not represented in the aquarium, of the hard-boiled fishes, or 'Jelcostci, which are everywhere the most abundant, and whose name the Australian fish eater will have no difficulty in remember mg, and of the air breathing fishes, the Dipper, of which scarcely more than three species are known, one being the "Bnrramunda" or Ceiatodim of Queensland Or, again, we might have selected a fair of the more curious forms for special remark and there are some such forms which merit more than a passing notice. There is, for instance, the toad fish, which is a source of amusement to cruel boys, who catch it with a bent pin and a few yards of twine, and when they have landed it, watch it in late itself like the frog in the fable, and when it lins puffed itself out to a perfect globe jump upon it, causing it to burst with a noise like a pistol This is unfeeling sport at least so far as the cruel boys are concerned, but the toad fish has taken direful revenge It is very poisonous, and has caused children who have eaten of it to die in frightful agony) Then there is the quaint little sea-horse, I lip po campus, of which the unfortunate and cares are looking husband is made to nurse the children There is its winged brother, the Pegasus, which might well have served as a type for its mythical namesake, the off spring from Medusa s blood And there is that wretched tatterdemalion, the Philipp teryx which 'Tenison Woods, in his Food Fishes of A em hotels I) ales, describes in the following appropriate terms "But. of all the curious fishes that ever were seen, Pbyllopteryv is the most extraordinary It is the ghost of a sea horse, with its winding sheet all of ribbons around it, and even as a ghost it seems in the very last stage of emaciation, literally all skin and grief The process of development by which this fish attained to such a state must be the most miserable chapter in the history of natural selection If this be the survival of the fittest ' it is easy to see what has become of the test in an there is the old Schnapper, with his uncouth burlesque of the human face, the Old Wife, like a busy old lady dressed up for town in her new striped silk, and there is the 1 founder, reclining so prettily on the bed of the tank like a little gossip loving coquette, and which pretty fish, strangeness, is accustomed to he so much on one side that its head, which is symmetrical in early infancy becomes quite misshapen in childhood, both eyes turning round to one side not disfiguring the creature, however, as one would expect, but adding to the pertness of its appearance But it appeared to us that it would be more in keeping with that useful and practical aim of the aquarium trustees, which is expressed in their hope of leading to a further development of the fishing in dustries it we devoted a chapter to the subject of edible fish, their capture and culture 'The flesh of fish, besides being agreeably flavoured, is highly nutritious, and though generally used as an adjunct to other fare it is sufficiently) substantial food to form a meal in itself The Anglo Saxon generally has a prejudice against the too plentiful use of anything but what he calls good solid fare, and thinks that a food which does not require much chewing is best given to children and invalids. It is easy to show on many grounds that this prejudice is wrong in principle lish contains twice as much nourishment as bread, and that it is a sufficiently) substantial food is proved by the fact that Esquimaux and other northern races subsist on it during the great part of the year Still, it is a fact that for the poor man with a large family) a pound of fish will not go so far as a pound of meat the edible (fishes indigenous to Australian waters are neither so numerous nor, as a rule, such good eating as those of Great Britain , yet many of them are by no means to be despised, and Borne deservedly take a high rank for their excellence and delicacy of flavour Information concerning the Melbourne fish market is not so generally diffused as to render necessary an apology for introducing for the benefit of householders some remarks upon the best and commonest kinds of fish caught in a victorian waters Altogether, there are about 15 different kinds of edible fish, but if we leave out of account those which are too coarse or unsavoury ever to be come of much use, their number is reduced to 37, and of these some are so rare, 01 command so high a price, that the really useful fishes may be reckoned as 24 The really good and at the same time easily obtainable fish are the whiting mullet, schnapper, garfish, butter fish, skipjack, and silver bream It may be regarded as invidious to distinguish was one of these fishes is superior to the rest, it may be considered as a case of a MINe inter part us But the palm has been given by some to the schnapper, not on account of its superior flavour, for there are many more delicious, but because, being a really edible fish, it is at the same time SO abundantly and regular!) supplied But there are already rumours of its becoming less abundant in the ha) Others have given the palm to the whiting, which, being one of the best of fish, far superior in delicacy to the schnapper, is also one of the commonest It is a different fish altogether from the English whiting which is a cod Mullet, both fresh and smoked, is deservedly esteemed, and is plentiful Gar fish, as every one knows, is an excellent breakfast fish, though it suffers from the reputation of being bon) borne people do not care for the soft flesh of the butter fish, but many) consider it a. delicate, and as iOs one of the commonest in the Melbourne market it must be regarded as a valuable fish the proper way to cook it is to cut it open, remove the head and principal bones and to fry it with or without bread crumbs. Possibly, if it were boiled and dried, it would make an excellent substitute for the Bombay duck," which is used as a condiment to eat with curry. The skip jack is very common, and is held in great esteem for the table, " the younger individuals being truly deemed dainty " And as to the silver bream, every one knows it as a " sweet little fish " Sometimes, however, it is a sweet big fish, for it is known to attain the length of it Next in importance come the sole, flounder, beardie, flathead travale, maru), whitebait, smelt, bad eel, barracouta, pike, skipjack pike, and perch Perhaps, as the Australian sole is "an exquisitely) delicious fish, equal, If not superior, to the haines sole," it should take a higher rank than we have given it here, but Us supply is not so regular as that of the first mentioned fishes, owing to the fact that it is obtained only by spearing on calm and clear dayS 'Hie beardie, or rock cod, 13 a common and esteemed fish With regard to the flatheads, of which there are four edible species, opinions differ , some pronounce them bon) and coarse, while others consider them as of excellent quality) But they are very common, and are the cheapest fish of the Melbourne market Possibly their cheapness detracts somewhat from their reputation 'The travels is plentiful, being caught in shoals in the bay, and is considered good eating The mares, which is considered by Professor M Coy as being identical with the English pilchard was but little known in Melbourne before the year 1864, in the summer of 1866 it was so plentiful in the bay that baskets were easily filled by simply dipping them in the water, and since then it has occurred so abundantly) in summer months that it has been banked about Melbourne in cart loads and sold for almost nothing. Yet we have met many) housekeepers who have never heard of this fish The pilchard, or mare) is the first cousin of the common European her ring being not readily) distinguished from it Ris however smaller 1 eaten fresh orme! ed us bloaters, or preserved in oil life sardines it is an excellent and invaluable fish Ut whitebait and smelt, both of which are common in Melbourne, nothing need be said, their qualities being, well known Sand eels or sand mullet are delicious, and the larger Rix of excellent flavour The sea pike has been authoritatively pronounced to be the best and most delicate of Victorian fishes, and the skip jack pike is said to be equally good The barracouta is also one of the principal edible fishes. W ith regard to the perch, which abounds in the Gipps Land Lakes, opinions differ, some pronouncing it to be a splendid table fish while others consider it unsavour) Another fish not usually con- sidered a Victorian fish, has gained a very high reputation We allude to the Hobart trumpeter, which 13 sent over from Tasmania, and which attains a length of from 2ft to 20ft It is known to occur in Victorian waters The bastard, or Gipps Land trumpeter, is an inferior variety There are still four kinds of commonly occurring fish which we must not omit to mention, namely, the colonial salmon trout, the rough), the Murray cod, and the Murray catfish Of these the first two are well known, occurring at times in shoals in the bay , the first is the larger and the second the smaller. They belong to a genus peculiar to Australia, of which one species sometimes attains the length of 25ft They are both good eating but it is not as a) s safe to use them, as, like some other kinds of fish, they occasionally possess an unexplainable poisonous quality. The Murray) cod, which is not a cold at all, but a kind of perch, is plentiful enough and large enough, but as known in Melbourne is too coarse for any but the poorest use It is said to be better flavoured when taken fresh out of the river, but in any case it may very well be left to the blacks and the swagmen. The cat fish, which grows to a great size, suffers considerably in gastronomic reputa- tion, owing to its being hideous in appearance It comes of a hideous family), against which the English have an almost ineradicable antipathy. One of its family, the Weis (attains giants), was considered so valuable a fish by certain authorities in England, that it was introduced into that country from the Danube, in which river it abounds. Now, certain Englishmen who tasted it at a time when it had been properly fed, pronounced it to be superior in flavour to the salmon, set others, still clinging to their prejudices, pronounced it to be "fat and gelatinous " be with regard to the Murray catfish, though it has been pronounced by one Australian authority to be "an excellent fish," others have give it no better meed of praise than that "it is fit for the table, but hideous" It is very voracious, and as, in company with the Murray cod, it clears the river of other fish, it ought, seeing that it is fit for the table," to be made to pay for its depredations by being eaten itself. Of the less common kinds of fish, perhaps, the Murray silver perch should take the lead, it has been described as " the perfection of fish, extremely rich and delicate in flavour " It weighs from Gib. to Gib. Next should be mentioned the king fish, which is considered so great a delicacy that in dividuals of it have been known to Bell for £2 and even £3 each. The red mullet-not the red garnet, with which it is sometimes confounded is a near relation of the one that used to be a source of so much extravagance amongst horses epicures, who spent fortunes in busing particular breeds The John Does, the fish out of which Peter took the pieces of tribute money The fact is proved by Peter's thumb mark being on the fish to this day is considered a great delicacy and it is said that it might possibly be less rare if it were caught by train, instead of by the seine net theatening the black perch, the mackerel the flying gurnard, and the rock long have all their reputation, and we need not further particularise them here, nor can we (give special notice to the Congress and the two lampreys We have said enough, to remind the reader that the edible fishes of Victoria are numerous and varied some of them taking a high rank as table delicacies And the successful introduction into "A Victorian rivers of the English salmon trout the brown trout the perch and the carp has materially added to the possibilities of epicurean enjoy ment the mention of the introduction of English fish into v Victorian rivers brings us naturally to the question of fish culture His idea is still prevalent that the fisherman's art ends with fish capture indeed there are very few amongst fishermen themselves who conceive it to go my further But it is not too much to say that the mere capture of fish is but the very beginning of fishing and bears scarcely a higher relation to the more perfectly developed industry than does the primitive gathering of wild herbs to modern medical care or the early hunting of the beasts of the forest to the domestication of cattle It is a remarkable fact that while modern civilisation has made such giving the States in many directions the fishing industries with a few distinguished exceptions remain in principle no furthered vanced than they appear to have been in prehistoric times If as communities grew and population increased men instead of taming and domesticating certain of the wild beasts had continued simply to hunt and kill them, it is safe to say that long before the present ate the meat supply of the world would have been exhausted The ocean however swarms with such countless multitudes that the fish supply has appeared inexhaustible but in 1 Europe the enormous increase of fish consumption during the last half century owing, to the great advance of popu- lation and the opening up of new fish mar! else If the railways has caused over) perceptible decrease in the fish supply and both in France and in England the questions of fish conservancy and fish culture have of late years received a great deal of attention Even in so young a country as Victoria the matter of over dredging has been brought to public notice by the well nigh extermination of the caster, and the necessity of supplying the Melbourne oyster market from Sydney). It seems at first sight a remarkable fact that such prolific creatures as fish should be liable to extermination. Everyone has seen the thousands upon thousands of eggs in a herring's rose and a shoal of herrings, if left undisturbed, would shed spawn in countless millions. It only a hundredth part of the ova shed by the edible fishes were to produce adult beings, the ocean would very soon become a solid mass of fish But the causes operating against such a result are more than sufficient to prevent its occurrence. Much of the spawn shed by the female escapes fertilisation by the male, much of it is eaten by other fish , the young fry full a prey to innumerable enemies or die from other causes, and millions of fish are caught in the fisherman's net before they have had time to propagate their kind and here the work of extermination goes on at a faster rate than the work of propagation, it becomes necessary to take in hand as a regular industry) the art of fish breed- ing and cultivation To many, perhaps, this will sound strange, but pisciculture is by no means a new art, it has been prac- used for a%a in China, where in consequence fish is both plentiful and cheap, it was practiced in a fancy way by wealth) Romans, in order to add to the dainties of their table , oyster culture was introduced by a Roman, begins Grata; and there used dence that fish culture was practised in Great Britain by the early monks In modern times, the work of M Coate 111 France, by means of which he has restored the rivers of his country, and restored to France the oyster, is now celebrated. The introduc- tion of salmon and trout into the rivers of Tasmania, Victoria, and New Zealand in connexion with which the name of Mr James A l our stands out in honourable prominence has furnished a classical chapter in the history of pisciculture In short it seems only necessary to awaken the public generally and capitalists to the great and we might without exaggera- tion Bay inestimable value of this part in order to have it established as a vigorous and profitable industry The points to be attended to in the cultiva- tion of fish are three namely -1 To take care of the ova and see that they are all v fertilised 2 To protect the young for) from their natural enemies b) enclosing them in confined waters in which shall be allowed to live on such forms of life as shall serve as the 1 to the young fish And 1 lol men and flavour the fish by means of 1 proper feeding, vi e might also add a fourth -namely the change of the habits of ocean and migratory fish so that they may live and bred in captivity and even give rise to new breeds similar to the breeds of domestic cattle. The experiments conducted a few years n Do in 1 Ismailia, in connexion with the breeding in captivity of the migratory) s dmon seem to indicate that great success in the future may crown such experiments though of course many preliminary failures may be anticipated The most prominent feature of pisciculture is the enormous return it gives for a comparatively small expenditure of capital and labour a feature which might reasonably be anticipated when one considers the prolific nature of fish By means of this art every acre of water whether inland or littoral may be rendered as valuable as every acre of land, I
