I have been a, nisg;itrtte< fiT lix yran. and my experience has been fin ted to this district. Far from thinkiuß the proxent Act increases crime, I bare boon particul*ily struck with the almmt entire ab-ence of it atnonc»t nnr young people, and 1 do not r<tmenib*r a single instance cmuini; Hefora me of one who did not uuder.tand thu adminittratinn of tho oath. I think the Act if open to improvement, t-ut I mutt emphatically •lute, an far. as my experience tends, that the i-resitit K'lucntion Act is the reverse of conducivo to crime. ■ • Mr. Tho«. Shenfirld, Cubfien,—ln reply to yiuir* of the 22nd icut, dors the Edacstien Act incresne crime? My ex pcrienci*, and opinion aro that it does not increaie crime. You knuw outaiJo of the magi«terial func i in, 1 am mixed up with tho working prop'e a i;re^t dr»l, and 1 havoa' good an idea of thu»e mattera as >oy one in the distuct, and I am very positive thnt the Education Act hasa great tendency the othrr way, aod in my magis terial capacity I mu«t say my opinion ia Uio lime. You are at liberty to make uso of thia in any way you'ehoooo. I could say a great deal on tho question. Mr. J. iWCrae, Camperdown,—ln rr ply to yuur queryjas to whether the present Eilucntinn incrtis-s crime I .may aute that my experience as a magistrate has not lnl me to think that it docs; but as a au{M-rintcndent of > Stbbath school I' hire been led to beliovc that the want i.f religinu* in struction in ■ the school fosters a great desl of irreverence in the young. Mr. W. A. Taylor, Camnt-rdown.—l tin in reefi| tnf vour>< of the 22 <J ult. With reiMrd to your n-quost to give my opinion »t tn whflher the present Edacation Act i|iif»t'i>u which xr*K sent to all J.'s. P., was that I had nut sufficient experience (ogive an opinion. But I would understand from your letter that it has. naimocil down more to the »cutl rcsitts of the xyetem in our nwn district, aid I am I quit" prepared to give >n i.piuioti t> the etl ct that I think the d:airict would compare fivnrably with ,»ny district «.f equal pupulntiim in England or S^tNmi, that pirtly from admnlaKOS of educatiuti, but quite as muc|) from the more coinfon. ahlo circumstances of the pollution and kbience of poreity, tbire are fewer in siances of crima aniuoi; thit youns gen«ration—that is to a»y amomr the young people wh». haie left school—than would he'found in the old couttry.' • Mr. P. S. Lang, Lars, Camperdown,— In answering the question contained in rour letter of the 22nd, received on my rtturn homa after aome day* »b.enc-. 1 liavo to erplain ih-t my disunce from the Court of Petty Sessions preclude* my forming as decided an opinion as -1 ihould liki 11 civo you as a magistrate "as to whetber tho ,present Elucation Act increases crime V More.ner, the present Act was in operation some years before I arrived in the colony,". and I hare no means of comp*rinz the present system of State school edautiun with -tut which preceded it. However, I have no hesitation, in taying that in my opinion as an individual, apart from on position as a magistrate, the with-boldiri* "of the bible from the ordinary course ol infraction in the Victorian State school* is answerable to a considerable extent for th» pravalooceof crime among the jnvenil-. pirtionof the community; and, mofeoter that this (.rcvaleoce wilt necessarily under the present system, become mor* appirent.as years n.ll by, and tv tb» off spring of th« present State school ohildron come to take tha place of their parents nnny of whom must of necessity be almost Godless. . , - ■ * ■ ■■ Jlr.
