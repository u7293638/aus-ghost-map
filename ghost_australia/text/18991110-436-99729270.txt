CHESS NOTES. The Otccgo Witness publishes an interesting account of a chat in London between Steiniiz and an .old friend, Dr. HeinemanD, formerly of Dunedin. Aeked how he could account for losing to Lisker, the veteran replied : — 'Young blood, my dear friend ; but he has not yet beaten my record of winning the whole of the games in a tournament of 17 players. Laoker has original idea°, but does not make the game a scientific Btudy, &nd;, unless he changes, will never be the founder of a new school cf playerp,' Asked whether playing with bu puilVL- U^^IVJUOUfcD UUUUL^flU ,LU 4 UJ JLF1 -J V OUllSllIf ? more or less than playing with inferior » Steinitz said.: — 'To play with a master. is.; decidedly best. He is able to show you things v wbich.it would be impossible for anyone but a master to point out,' adding, as an after-' thought :—' Play not with the mere o,bj?ct of winning, but rather with the view of observ ing how the master handles certain attacks and defences — in short, with the intention of learning.' Asked for his opinion as to how Janowsky was likely to foro in his match with Lasker, Steinitz answered : — ' He has not a ghost of a chance of wiat ing. In a tournament anyone who can play fairly well has some chance— but not in a eet match,'' On one other point, Steinitz expressed a very positive opinion. This was as to the use of studying problems, wilh a view to improve ment in play. 'Waste no lime in solving problems,' said the old champion, ' If you wish to become an expert in solving problems, wait till the solution is before you, and tben: look at the principle involved. If you do that for six months, you will without difficulty be able to solve any problem.' a.11 who have travelled by the Messagertes Maritimes (French mail/ boats are loud in their praises of the comfort, civility, and excellent cuisine met with.
