THE BISHOP OF MSLBO OHM'S LECTURES ON CHRISTS TE ACHIM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS, SIR-Having read the brilliant lectures recently delivered by the bishop of Melbourne, I willingly acknowledge the pleasure derived from the wealth of words, the riches of ornate rhetoric with which these lectures abound But while the ears are filled with the enticing words of man's wisdom, the heart, with which we believe unto righteousness, ' is left to desire the form of sound words, which is so sadly wanting in a vacuous waste of Rabbinical lore, and to shrink from the doubts suggested by the attenuated doctrine artfully shrouded in a glittering veil of sonorous amphilology The subject matter of this doctrine is a vital truth which all even the most profound and most lasting interests of all the children of Adam the mystery of the Incarnation is the sun and centre of all revealed religion. and of all human redemption, radiating from the Cross on Calvary), illuminating the whole expanse of revelation, reflecting its light upon the promise in Paradise, and projecting its rays to the valley of JehoBophat, where the Son of God ' shall come to judge the quick and the dead This for reaching all absorbing truth is a most essential dogma of Christian faith, for he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God, and therefore it must be taught with the most unequivocal clearness, and believed with the most in doubting faith I feel, then demanded of conscience, stimulated by the force and the majesty of truth, and urged by the interests of common Christianity, to protest against the shadowy views of the eloquent bishop, and to proclaim the orthodox doctrine so explicitly and emphatically taught by the Scriptures, the symbols, and the articles of his own church in his lecture of the 13th inst, Dr. Moorhouse undertakes to define the Incarnation, and its object, the Atonement "What he asks, is the Incarnation, but simply the fatherly love of God bending down seek His child What is the Atonement but that same love, lifting up the lame and guilty child to seek his descending Father' The ultimate force and being of the universe IS our rather Is not this Unitarianism, for it excludes the Son, who is equal to the Father in all things, congenial and consubstancial, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made And what a vague jejune notion of the Incarnation is presented to us, the love of the Father revealed in a Galician peasant whom all knew to be unlearned, winning truth, and therefore ignorant of it until He won it, though He was the God of all truth, the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world to the bishops reason there is but one possible answer to give as the solution of the mystery of this exceptional achievement the nature of our Saviour was other than ours would not His divine nature throw a flood of light on the mystery and make the achievement a very easy one This is the solution which I expected to find in the lecture of yesterday), but have been lamentably disappointed The subject is dexterously ignored, and no where notevenonco,isChri3tspokcnot as the Son of God having the same divine nature as His father He is merely presented to us after the manner of Henan, us a great reformer who tives a new meaning to old precepts and observances He is called our Lord and nothing else throughout and the meaning of this is determined by the context We are told qt His exegetical skill, of the wonderful tact and readiness which arose from the certainty of His intuition of ' His own intentional allowance, of the spirit of the other which is within Him of ' His divinely enlightened consciousness, of " His intimate and complete knowledge of the mind of the Father by which he could dis ecru accurately) Now, if the Son of God, who was God the Son, equal to His Father in all things having the same substance and the same nature who was full of grace and of truth only acquired his knowledge by intuition, b) enlightenment, by his comment, then ' our laird was not God All this phraseology recalls to mind the c [invocations of the Ariana of the fourth

andtml) our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ With this familiar knowledge he enjoyed also the advantage of knowing all that had been previously written of our Lord by the

heaven at the baptism in the Jordan "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased He knew of the confession of Peter at Caesarea Philippi, ' Thou art Christ the Son of the living God He knew and heard with his own ears the reply which Christ himself made to the adjuration of Cmaphas, ' I i adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the Son of God And he answered " 1 Thou host said | He knew all this and much more, which I prefer to avoid prolixity And how did he understand, how did he interpret it In the first chapter of his magnificent gospel he summarises and sublimates it all with majestic simplicity HoLuttera no uncertain sound, but peals forth a clear, loud ringing trumpet blast Soaring upon eagle pinions to the very throne of God he proclaims, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God And the Word was modelled and dwelt among us (and we be held His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth He then who was made flesh and dwelt among us was the only begotten of the Father, the Word who was God has apostle of love whose writings are characterised by peaceful gentleness, uses against those who may deny this truth, an adage which for him, is significantly strong, In the second chapter of his first epistle he asks-' Who is a liar but he wholemeal that Jesus is the Christ' HO is anti-christ that den le til the Father and the Son Who soever denied the Son the same hath not the father In the fourth chapter he declares that "every spirit that confesses not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God ' And again, "God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him. ' In the fifth chapter the askS, Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God Y and he adds-" there are three that bear record in heaven, the father, the Word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one in the Apocalypse he proclaims the Lamb of God to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending the Almighty Whit adit front picture of the incarnation is this from the frigid colourless abstraction presented to us by Dr Moorhouse Here we have the canvas glowing with life glistening with the radiance of truth projecting before us the. God Man as a living young life giving per sociality the AY ord made flesh, dwelling among us the Emanuel God with us Hits sublime doctrine is formulated 'or us with precision and minuteness in the creeds, which are accepted as the standards of Chris turn faith Let me here observe that the eighth article of the Anglican Confession of Faith declares that the three creeds Nicene Creed, Athuiiasius s Cice 1, and that which is commonly called the Apostles Creed ought thoroughly to be received and believed for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy) scriptures. With such warrant, then the Apostles Creed teaches us to believe in God the rather Almighty maker of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ His only son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary He then who was born of the Virgin Mary Jesus Christ, was the only Son of God the father Almighty The Nicene Creed is more explanatory, in order to confound and condemn Ananism - I believe in one God the rather Almighty and in one Lord, Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God and born of the Father before all ages God of God light of light true God of true God begotten not made consubstantial with the Father by whom all things were made who for us men, and for our salvation descended from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary and was made man One would hardly think that anything more formal could be required But advancing errors made it necessary to be more explicit still in the creed of Saint Athanasius, the doctrine is laid down so as to deny all duplicity 'WliOBoever will be saved before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith And the Catholic faith is this That we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity) Neither ron founding the Persons nor dividing the sub stance for there is one Person of the Father and another of the Son and another of the Holy Ghost. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ For the right faith is, that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God is God and Mun God of the substance of the 1 rather begotten before the worlds and Man of the substance of his Mother born in the world, Perfect God and Perfect Man of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting equal to the father us touching his Godhead and a fence to the Father as touching his Manhood 1 Who although he be God and Man yet he is not two but one Christ one not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by the taking of the Manhood into God one altogether not by confusion of substance but by unity of Person or as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man so God and Man is one Christ has is the Catholic faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved Such is the minute unequivocal testimony of the creeds to which I am in a Id for the special attention of Dr Moorhouse the second article of his religion which reads thus - The Son which is the Word of the father begotten from everlasting of the father the very and eternal God and of the one substance with the father took Many nature in the womb of the blessed A Virgin, an 1 of her substance so that two whole and perfect natures that is to set the God had and Manhood were joined together in one person never to be divided whereof is one Christ very God and very Man who truly suffered was crucified dead and burned to reconcile His Father to us and to be a sacrifice not only for original guilt but also for all actual sins of men Now may I remind the Bishop of Melbourne of just one other thing, When he was consecrated to his high office theory ciating prelate asked him two questions set down in the ordination service of the Anglican ritual Will you faithfully exercise yourself in the Holy Scriptures an I call upon God I j prayer for the true understanding of the same so that you may be able by them to teach and exhort with wholesome doctrine and to withstand and convince the gum sales Answer I will so do by the help of God Yrcjou ready with all faithful diligence to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrine contrary to God s AN old and both prix ately and openly to call upon and encourage others to the same Answer I am read) the Lord being my helper The comparison or rather the contrast between the scriptures tho s) ml oils and the articles of the Anglican Church on the doctrine of the Incas nation an 1 tin teaching, of tin pious bishop in his late lectures on MOUSIJ suggests another question Have these promises been fulfilled But I would rather leave the answer to himself while venturing to remind him of the admonition of Saint Paul to the Galatians If any man French and J other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be anathema."
