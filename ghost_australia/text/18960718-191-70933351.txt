The Boomers were short-handed — but that's no ? excuse— a junior team would have done as well as they have been doing during the second round of fixtures. : * * * Hocktons evidently couldn't rake .to gether a team to toe the mark aaainst the Cityfi, so tiiat club claimed a forfeit.

The attendance numbered some three thousand or more, the weather was nice and mild, and the saucer-like track ia tip-top order, Martin, the iron jawed Yank, was the hero of ,the occasion, securing five wins. In all he pocketed some £26, representing first honours in the follow uig races; Half- mile Handicap, Mile Han oicap, Three-mile Handicap and Five-mile, Championship of Queensland ; he also oc cupied back seat on the triplet which annexed the Three-mile Multicycle event. Porta, the Italian crack, competed in a couple of eyentsr his best performance ? being second in the Three=mile Handicap. Me did not, however, seem to be in any thmg-4ike good fettle, a fact most likely due to recent illness. T. A. Healy, famous »^,on& Toowoomba -wheelmen, won the Mile Roadster, -while-K. H. Walne showed best form among the local riders— he secured second place in the Half-mile and _-Mile Handicaps. ? T, -_* * * inere was one thing that was vexing on Saturday at the cycling sports, and that was the way in which the local men were treated .by thejjandicapper. Martin won \-- everything^ started for, and on each occasion had apparently a good deal to spare, our own men notiiaving the ghoSt of a slMtor.

As a consequence, the totalisator was well patronised, and the last dividend, £2 18s. for 5s., will no doubt cause a little extra speculation to-day (Saturday). There is not much djubfc but that the Creek is be coming a popular resort on Saturday after noons, and ho long as the management keep on serving up first-class sport, such fz has been the case of late, then so long will the public both patronise and enjoy it, and every week will see fresh faces to swell the iiu-3ii/uy mi ge iuiwjnuji/ius? xueioi lowing is the result :— Flying Handicap, of 15 sova..
