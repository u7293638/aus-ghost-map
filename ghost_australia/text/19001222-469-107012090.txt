A Ghost Story. A sweep had been employed by a fnrmer, 1 who lived in an extremely lonely spot. It was Into when his work was finished, nnd lie asked permission to sleep in the barn. This was readily granted. In the night the sweep was aroused from | his peaceful slumbers by hearing the barn door cautiously open. He looked up and saw two men enter, who at once set down the lautern thoy had been carrying, and proceeded to fill two sacks with the farmer's ' best malting bsvrloy. " If," said ono of the thieves, "wo had someone to hold the lantern up, we shouldn't belong." " No," agreed tho other ; " wish we had someone." " I'll hold tho light for you," offored the sweep, coining forward politely. Tho men turned. Their hair rose on end at tho supposed apparition. With a blood curdling yell, they both rushed from the barn. Not till next morning did it dawn on the swoop that tho two men had mistaken him for his Satanio Majesty, or ono of his angels. No more barley was taken from that barn.
