SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28,1878. As tins is the last issue which vi ill go by the mail boat calry nig away our very cvpensive delegates to the Imperial Go veinment, vie think it veil to diaw at tention once inoietotlie pi mcipal reason ?winch lenders their journey so unnoces sary and lidiculous The Secretaiy oí State has said, in terms as distinct as any he could possibly use, that " how " ever justifiable jn the last lesort, as " the only remaining means of carrying " into effect the dehbeiately expi eased " will of the people of Victoria upon an " issue plainly piesented to thom," the interfeience of the Imperial Pailiament might be, that such întei ference did not appeal to him " to bo wauanted by the " circumstances contemplated by the, " ^ ictonan Ministers as likely to anse " m this case " What are the circum stmces to which Sa MICH U L HICKS BIACH alluded in this part of his despatch ? They ni ly be found set foi th m the 7 th, 8th, and 9th paiagraphs ot tue kinwwuSl memorandum foi warded through His EXCELLENCY to the Colonial Office m August last These clauses um as follow - 1 ' AA lien, therefore, in clue course it has pissed the Assembly, mid been Bent up to the Council, a time of great anxiety will have aimed It is impossible to predict with any certainty the probable course which vv ill be adopted by the Council, but whatever that course maj be Ministers are fully determined on meeting the Council in the spirit of con cession and conciliation in all mattera out side the principles involved in the bill Should, however, conferences or any other mode of effecting a conciliator} arrangement unfortunately fail as it is to be feared they maj, Ministers will be most rcluctantlj com pelled to despatch to Tiigland, on behalf of and with the express sanction of the Logis lative Assembly, commissioners chosen from the leading members of that House to lay before Her Majestj s Imperial Government the matured result of its deliberation with a v lew to get that result embodied in an act of the Imperial Legislature &.C The circumstances, then, which, m the opinion of the Secietaiy of State, would not justify the interference of the Impeiial Legishtuie, aie the fuluie of confei enees oi other modes of effecting a conciliatoiy arrangement to secure the passage of the Ministerial Reform Bill Let us ask, if Sir MICHAEL HICKS BL urn did not consider that Impeiial legislation would be permissible even after an at tempt to eflect a settlement in a " spa it " of concession ind conciliation " had filled, what is he likely to say to a cool íequest foi his assistance m giving effect to the insolent demands of a fac tion when id vanees made by the Council and supported by the Opposition in the Low ei House have been contemptuously rejected 1 If it would have been useless to go home m the one case, suiely it is simply fatuous m the othei By last mail we weio able to nifoini our English icadeis that the Legislative Council had, in the most magnanimous waj, held out the olive blanch, by cany ing a series of resolutions, of which the following wero the chief - ' 1 hat the annual Appropriation Bill con tam grants for the usual and ordmarj ser vicoB of the >ear, and for no other purpose and shall not contain any matter foreign to such granta 1 hat the Council may, under a resolution passed by an absolute ma jonty of its members, inform the As Bembly by message that, m their opinion, any grant recommended in a message from the Governor ought not to be con I tamed in the Appropriation Bill That if the Assembly disagree with such message, the Appropriation Bill, without such disputed I grant, Bhall proceed in the usual way, and the Assembly shall send to the Council the dis puted grant m the form of a. separate bill If the disagreement between the two Houses on such separate bill continue, and if the Go- vernor, in consequence thereof, think fit to dissolve the Assembly, the Governor may, at the same time, also dissolve the Council. That on disputes between the Houses aa to other act affecting their respective powere cither House way petition the Queen ii Council It must be undeiatood that these reaolu turns weio not put foi ward as a fini settlement of the question, but simplj foi the pui pose of intimating a willing ness to concedo something rithei thai havo tile colony degraded by a confes Mon of inability to minage its ovvi affairs Everyone, wo think, will admii that an offei to submit to dissolution ir letum foi the mere right of objectim to the lntioduction of queutions ol policy into money bills, was a voij substantial proof of willingness te treat the mattet in a fair anc reasonable spirit But, as wo sait before, no intimation or even hint wai given of a disinclination to consider anj furthei propositions which might b( submitted The lesolutiona, howovei, instead of being received and discussed in that " spiut of concession and con " ciliation ' which Mr BLUR) hid men tioned ns certain to actuite his dealings, w ci e treated with ill the derision the humoious poweis of the I'leimei and his colleagues peinutted them to pom out If \fi Bl i R\ hid îeilly been mu HIS to settle the question, and notmeielv dtsiious of seeming a pleisuio jiunt it the public expense, he would hue put forw ud counter pioposals, and hive seen how much fuithei tho Council wis dist (ned to give way Hie mittei wus undo eisv. foi lum bj the iction of the Opposition Mi Si R\ ICI pioposcd tint he should tiko up the Councils liofoim Bill, which i educed the qualihcitions of members ind elec tois, the tenure of seats, ind the si/o of tlio pi ounces, graft on it the provision foi dissolution contiinecl m the îesolu tions to which we have been lefoiiing [making the power applicable to dis putes concerning geneial as well as financial legislat on], ind add to it a condition to the effect that if, aftei a geneial election, the cUfioi once which caused it should still continue, both Houses should sit togo thor and decide the mattet by a joint vote Mi Si RV ICE maintained th it such an aiiangement would havo the following advantages - ' 1 It tv ould effectually remedy the evfls arising from deadlocks between the two Houses ' 2 It would take away the permanent veto which the Council has now the power to exercise over legislation without impairing the usefulness of that body, or destroying the desirable check which two Houses pro vide ' 3 It would m no way interfere with tho privilege of the Assembly to put any item it chooses into the annual Appropriation Bill " 4 It would constitute the people of this country the final arbiter in, all coses of dis pute bctvv een the two Houses ' 5 It would provide a simple and effective means for such amendments in our constitu tional law as the j eoplc of the country may from time to time desire "G It would develope feelings of mutual respect and conciliation betiveen the two Houses and w ould thusbe the best guarantee in the future for sound, useful, and har momous le0islation ïîicï? w<ls no lttcmpt to deny that the settlement suggested would havo the effects pointed out, but as it was thought necessaiy to get na of this new danger to the lree tup on some pretence or othei, the Premier fell back upon the biillianl discovery that the Opposition could not speak foi the Upper House Ibis conceding and conciliating gentle man peiemptoiily declared that nothing but a guirantee norn a lmjonty of the Council to igree to what is known as the Reid Mum o scheme would stop the " embassj " As though an mdenendent House would thus place itself beneath the feet of a co oidmate Chimbei ' It will be seen that, taking the Conn ciPs bill and itsiesolutions together, Ali SrRvict's proposals only went beyond its offeis m two particular, viz, in making dissolutions apply todisputes over geneial as \»ell as financial legislation, and in piovidlng for joint votes in tho event of continued differences In other words, the object of the leadei of the Opposi tion was to obtain finahty by some mechanical means The question then anses, Would the Uppei House have consented to these amendments 1 Oui own opinion is that it would But while this may be a inattei of doubt, we aie ceitain it was Mi BERRY'S business to ascertain definitely wbethel it would oi notbefoie setting oft to make the colony i idiculous in England Oin leasonfoi believing that it would is that vntually finality is attained at present-u we have shown îepeatedly-and as this mechanical device is supposed to be the rage in popuhi cueles it present, it is not likely that a very stiff fight would have been made about the mero semblance of pow ei Perhaps some membei s of the Opposition in both Houses would have objected, but w e have reason to believe that if the experiment suggested by Mi SERVI«" had been made, Mi BERRY would now be pieparmg to spend his holidaj s m the bosom of his family m stead of being about to compass sea and land on is complete a fool's on and is any on which mortal man evei staited Our summary number of yester- day contained a record of the threatening utterances recently in- dulged in by Ministers of the Crown with regard to the stops to be taken in the event of the embassy to England proving a failure-and the cer- tainty of a failure now confronts the Government. These declarations have created uneasiness in the colony, and probably they will be read with asto- nishment elsewhere, for it is certainly wonderful that responsible Ministère in a British territory, enj'oying the confidence of a British Governor, should lose no opportunity of exciting the populace, and of allowing it to be known in plain language that apart of their programme is that there should be riot and confusion. Wo call attention to the threats, not only to show the reck- less character of the men who hold office, but also to make known the spirit in which the "embassy" is entered upon. The fact is recog- nised here by all parties-and the speeches we printed yesterday will re- veal the fact elsewhere-that loyalty is assumed by Ministers as a mask, and that they are ready to drop that mask at a moment's notice. The Ministerial oratorB, it will be Been, do not even pro- fess that the embassy goes to London to advise with the Secretary of State and to take his opinion and profit by it. According to official deliverances, the which, namely, the setting aside of tho Council, is preposterous, and the other, the setting aside of the Go\ LRNOH, ¡¡, disloyal-and to warn HEK MAJESTY'S Secretary of State of tlio consequences of i ejecting these proposals Hid the Ministoiial language been v ague, and had it been only casually employed, little attention would luvo been excited, because tho membeis of the Government are by no means measured speakers But tho threats oro studied They aro spoken not lnipiomptu but on set otea MOUS, no oppoitumty has been omittod of íepeating them after attention was fiif-t called to then significance, and they point to particular means md to a definite end This much will be seen on refeienco to the record M yoi SMITH at the close of the reform debato (No \ ember 28th), annouii ced in the Assombly the plan of opeiatioii': If tho Impend Parliament declines eithei to piss the Ministen al liefoim Bill 01 an ict to enable the Lower House alone to adopt i constitution, then the Government will tick then íeform pioposals to tho numil Appropiiation Bill llio com bnied nieismo would of comic bo laid i side by the Council, ind we should havo what is called " a leal cusís, 01, as M ijoi SMITH sajs, ' the soveiest dead ' lock evci known Presuming that tlio A'-'-cniblj would be stubborn, it is not easy to foresee the conse picncoi Ko funds would be available for i ni w ijs, foi postal pin poses, foi tlio gaol«, foi thclunaticasjlums.andfoi the police, and the Mimsteml impression ippean to be th it theie would be plunder and npnie, in the midst of which the Council would disappeai "If wo io " suit to extieme measures fli-,t, said Major &MUH;, "the Impenil G)voin "mont might sa), 'Why did you not " ' come to us ? \ou hid no ught to " ' plunge the countiy into civil strife, " ' and to create suflciings and distress " ' until you came to us ' " That is to say, the embassy first and civil strife after waids In the same way it will bo seen that the Chief Secietaiy dechied in the Assembly that the embassy would say to the Imperial Government, " You lia ve " placed a power /tho Legislative Cou i " eil) in oin colony that is moro inimical "to oui welfaie than Downing street " itself, and we expect that yon will " geneiously accede to our lequest that "it be îeinoved Considci this thing, " and bear in mind that tho disgraco to " the Imperial Government will bo as " gieat is to us if anarchy m tho 19th " centuiy should occur in the city of " Melbourne " Mi BLRRY'S faiewcll utterance will bo found to ho still more pionounced At the Mel bom no banquet he said, "Wo will " ask the Secretary of State what " furthei must the people of Vic " tona sufter befoie tho ' last io " ' sort ' conies Î Does lie want uíulecii " hoads and houses m flames V All means short of "broken heads and " houses m flames " have, as Mi BFRRY insists, and as ho endeavours to make his nnsguided follow eis believe, been exhausted But "broken heads and "houses in flames" aio with linn a constitutional lemedy He said - " I have always held that our Con stitution Act does contain within itself all the power essential to settle this question, but the Government shrnil, as all honest thoughtful men should shrink, from a contest winch, ho«ever successful, must be marked by the complete and permanent humiliation of our opponents, from a course which would be surrounded by cir cumBtances which nil must deplore and which could not bo read in the history of the future with satisfaction ^ e will ask them as statesmen to look ahead, and to prove their statesmanship by realism,; he danger to ourselves-ajC and the danger o I noland also At a eye, t, we win jicver forset that we a«, the reno,. sentativcs of u free People7 tlnt wInf WJ ask in one way Ve ourselves can do ia another And that other way has boen indicated aheady Mi PLVRSON, the codekyito With Mr BI-RRY, talks glibly about tho " timo when a nation must íesort to " extraordinary means which no dis "passionate statesman would evei " dare to contemplate " Mi T B PVITEPSON, Mmistei of Public Works, speaks of a íesort to shillelaghs, while Mi LONGMORE, Mimstei of Lands, addiessmg a public meeting at Hotham, asked, "What would the country have " lost if the embassy weie unsuccessful ? " The people would have their battle to "fight Did they know how ALLXVNDLR " cut the Goidianknot, he cut it with the " swoid The people must, if need* "be, fight foi then hboities" The othei speeches aie of the same type, md if they have any meaning they can only imply that Mmisteis pio pose, if unsuccessful, to resoit to a tack m ordei to provoke a stoppago of public payments, and to bring about a few dajs of noting and of pilhgo feomethmg like the Loid GLORC-I GORDON riots is to occui here, but m stead of " No Popery," men will bo re cjuned to chalk on then houses "No " Council " The antecedents of Ministen all justify the possibility of thou íeally meaning a íesoit to the violence w ne i their speeches foicshadow Then Black Wednesday action, when they cleJt what they called their return blow upon innocent and helpless civil sen ants and did not hesitate m meie spite to close the courts ot justice, is not to bo lightly forgotten And the dangei of talk about shillelaghs and the toidi is i real one In au communities there is some giound 101 such seed, and the murders ot tie police and the robbeiy of a bank m tie northeastern district, coupled with tue scieenmg of the offenders, show that we have a cnminal class of a peculiar type to deal with in Victoria But wo ato still confident that neithei appeals to political passion nor to hopes or mateual plunder will suffice to ia.se any confusion amongst us The bul« 01 the community here aie thiivnig and loyal, and any wise advice given by the Secretary^ State to the embassy to go back, to talk reasonably, w act peaceably, and to settle the lefoim issue by the easy constitutional means which are now available, wal at once cieate a powerful party in support of the maintenance of law and order In stating that the choice of too im penal Government is between owed <, to the embassy demands or plungwg Melbourne into anarchy, Mi i«"»* does, we believe, put a false issue 1W» threats have not intimidated the ton stitutional party here, and it »rim culona to suppose that they w11 be 'Tities of the Empire. Eather, we may feel assured, their effect will be to show the Secretary of State how it is that the Berry Ministry haa failed to obtain ' the '.reasonable reform which ' has been, and still is, within the reach of any mon who wish honestly to discharge their duty to the com- munity. They disclose with tolerable plainness tho character and the motives of the men who, invested with tho re . sponsibility of rulers, aro moro dis- orderly than the people that they rule.

The Alba tross was proceeding up the Yarra for the purpose of landing her passengers at the Queens Wharf and when just below the Yarraville sugarworks she came into col lision with the s.s. Arawata, from New Zealand, which had run aground on a mud bank. There appeared to have been ample room for the Albatross to pass the Arawata, and although signals were made on board the Arawata to warn tho approaching steamer of the danger, the Albatross stood on her course and the result was that her paddle box struck the stern of the Arawata. The paddle box of tho Albatross was very considerably injured by the force of the collision, but the wheel escaped with but slight damage, and after a little delay the Albatross continued her journey, and landed her passengers at the wharf at about half past 8 o'clock. There was a good deal of confusion on board both steamers at the time of the collision, but as soon as the exact nature of the accident became known tho alarm quickly subsided. The damage occasioned to the stern of the Arawata was comparatively slight, but the paddle-box of the Albatross was almost carried away, and the steamer had to be laid up the following morning for repairs The s.s. Arawata on her last trip from New Zealand brought a very valuable shipment of 21 Lincoln rams and two ewes for Messrs Robertson Brothers, of Colac These sheep, which are of a first class description, are now on view at Jones sbontledstores, South Wharf Included in the number is tho champion ram of New Zealand this year, being first at C)i istchurch, Oamaru, and Dunedin and the two ewes are likewise first prize takers at the same shows The) were bred and shown b) Mi ahornas Sutton of Sutton Brothers, Southland Iho 20 shorn rams were picked from the flock of Mr JohnGngg Ashburton, Canterbury Our Jika correspondent writes -" Tho strongest indignation is being expressed by the inhabitants of South Preston m conso quence of a letter having been received from the Government intimating that the pro miaed water supply for that district woull not be laid down before April next, as there _._ ?- - - ---?--^-^^^ I deputation from tho residents waited on I authorities about six months ago the res being that sev eral officers visited the diatri and promised that the work would be co menced forthwith but notwithstanding ti ironuae the work was postponed until Tar arj next and is now further postponed un A] ni on the plea that there are no suital 1 ipes nv ailable and further that the wo will necessitate nn expenditure of £1 TO winch the council will have to guarantee return of Oper cent before the work will carried out as it is stated by the departme ti at the retnrn is not likely to excee 1 2 \\. tent When the application waa fn mnde for the water it waa lomt out that the return would fully amou to 0 j cr cent if not the council won guarantee that amount in order to have t. v ork conn lcted before the i resent suinim A number of persona have been obliged leave the district which has caused aacrio depreciation m propertj Hie following casca of accidental injii were jesterduy admitted to the Alfr Hosjital -A child named Isabella Cilio' w ith a sev ore lacerated w ound caused bj fall on broken glass and a boy nann OÎMCI resi lui], at Prahran who fell whi trjmg to walk on a fence and sustained i ternal injuries lenders were opened by the Railway d lartment jestcrday for the undcrmcntioni vi or] s and the following were announced be the low est -Supplj of six li ton weit, bridges Vrthur IIoj e ii 110 19s points ai crossing?
