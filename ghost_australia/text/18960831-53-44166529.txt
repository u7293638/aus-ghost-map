THE CHURCHES. Baptism by Immersion. THE services in the Beryl-street Baptist Church yesterday were of unusual interest, owing to a man and his wife being baptised by total immersion, in accordance with the tenets of the church. The sermons were preached by the Rev. Ellis JonesÂ¿ who in the evening held a special ser- vice on the baptismal doctrine. There was a large congregation, the building being packed, and the liveliest interest was taken in the proceedings. The rev. gentleman took for bis text pas- sages from Romans and Colossians, and quoted many authorities to show that the Greek word from which our word " baptize" was taken meant immersion. The celebrated Greek lexicographers, Liddell and Scott, defined it as "to dip in and under water," and this was followed by the most celebrated classic scholars. John Wesley and Dr. Chalmers were of opinion that it meant immersion. The Baptist view of tbe ceremony was that it was intended to convey the idea that as Christ was buried in the earth so we must be buried in water. It was to be remembered that Christ was baptised by immersion and not by sprinkling. The ceremony was then performed. A sort of large bath waa arranged on the platform, and the candidates separately took np their positions at one end of this, suitably robed. The rev. gentleman then pronounced the words " I baptise you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," whereupon the Candi- dates fell back into the water, from which they were immediately assisted out by the officers of the church. The service closed with the benediction.
