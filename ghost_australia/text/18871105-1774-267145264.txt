The Approaching Canonizations. It is on the 6th January, 1888, the Feast of the Epiphany, that the Canonizations which will mark the Papal Jubilee of Leo XIII., will take place. The Saints who will receive the supreme honour are : three members of the Society of Jesus, the Blessed Peter Claver, the Blessed John Borchmans, and the Blessed Rodriguez ; and the seven noble Florentines, who, on the Feast of the As sumption of Our Lady, in the year 1233, founded the Order of the Servites of Mary. This first great ceremony will be followed,, on successive Sundays, by the ceremonies of the Beatification of several servants of God. These are, firstly, the five Venerables whose cause of Beatification is complete : Louis-Marie Grignon de Montfort, Founder of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Daughters of Wisdom ; Egidius Marie de Saint Joseph, of the Institute of St. Peter of Alcantara ; Clement-Marie Hof bauer, Redoinptorist, of Vienna ; Felix of Nicosia, Capuchin lay-brother; and 1 vez de Beninganim, Augustinian, of Spain ; and afterwards, a large number of holy men and women whose processes of Beatification or Canonization arc at present under examina tion. In order that the Canonizations and Beatifications here spoken of may be con cluded in J an nary next, the Pope has com mended that all other causes be suspended until after that month â€” Go.fhotic Tinies.
