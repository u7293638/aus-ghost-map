The first portion 01 the programme consisting 0f a Christy Minstrel entertainment, in which the; Tomahawk Minstrels made their appear ance. Their repertoire included the usual songs and jokes provided at minstrel per formances, the jokes being of a somewhat threadbare character. The choruses by the company were well rendered, and Messrs. Sando, Limb, Abbott, Hosking, and Lloyd were successful in pleasing with their con tributions. Some step-dancing by Messrs. Gordon, Guidi, and Pine delighted a section of the audience. There were two farces,, one before the interval, entitled ' A Smart Youth Wanted,' and the finale denominated ' A Ghost in a Pawnshop.' Mr. Warner's ventriloquism was a success, and the enter tainment was creditable to those who got it up and should net a good sum to the club funds. The orchestra deserve a word of praise for their contributions to the evening's pleasure.
