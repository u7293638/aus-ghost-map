IN THE HEART OF ULSTER. (From An Occasional G'oiiiinsroNnKNT.) HANDALSTOWN, COUNTY ANTRIM, Oct. 27, 1895. A few weeks ago a public meeting was held in Dublin, and was attended by all sorts of leading people, for the object of promoting touring in Ireland The burden of all the speeches was that while tourists scour the uttermost ends of the earth in search of health, beauty), or pleasure the neglect Ireland, although it is one of the healthiest, prettiest, and pleasantest countries in the world line was attributed partly to ignorance, partly to prejudice, and partly to the want of proper railway and steamer arrangements, and reso- lutions were passed calling upon all concerned to reform in these several respects and to join in making Ireland as popular a place of resort as Scotland or Svv Sterland This has led to a good deal of discussion in the papers on both sides of St Georges Channel, not all of it favourable to the object which the promoters of the meeting had in view The railway companies have shown clearly that they have made extraordinary efforts to attract and accommodate tourists, with very inadequate results 'They have piped, but the tourists have danced off to other countries The) have offered not only to carry them safely, swift!), and comfortable), but also to board and lodge them on ridiculously easy terms, to provide them with amusements such as golf and sea bathing, and to secure than the free enjoyment of the most picturesque and delectable spots in the island This is true It is cheaper to make a tour in the North of Ireland, at all events, than to stay at home The railway) companies find you in everything except liquor, tobacco, and clothes, for 20s a week, including first class train fore Contrast this with the tat ills of the merry), merry Si issl On the other hand, a good many people have written to be) the) have tried touring in Ireland, and found it it soon) failure He) have gruesome tales to tell of bad roads and worse hotels, of dirt and I beggars and t extortion and not a few of them boldly declare that the boasted scenery of Ireland is very much over praised and that the so called notices of interest are mainly mythical On the whole, probe!!), the effect of the agitation as far as it has gone, has been to deter tourists rather than to mv ate them. There is a good deal of exaggeration on both suit of this discussion, and the truth Ina midway between them and some distance off the main line of argument Then are parts of Ireland which are not only an interesting but intensely depressing, and where board, lodging, and travelling would be dear at any price All the BtiniCi there are other parts of Ireland where no such draw hicks cutt, where nature affords an ample harvest of beauty to quiet eyes where all sorts of quaint and moving associations cling, and where the people are attractive by their surplus ity, and honest), and unfailing courtesy) The North of Ireland, especially at some little distance from the sea is well wooded and abounds in lovely) and varied scenery), and it has, besides, that peculiar charm that is also found in Scotland, bvvitrirlnnri, and the North of Italy, of a numerous and the pig population, pushing their industries with billiard and muscle in the midst of the fairest of rural landscape s llandalsloun, so called after some bone Lands!
