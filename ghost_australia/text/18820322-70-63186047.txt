SPORTING. Wo have just got through the autumn meet ing of the Victoria Racing Club, and a brilliant meeting it was in every sense of the word. The stakes were large, the total amount paid away being nearly £10,000. There were im-' mense fields, and some very close and exciting contests. The Hurdle Race was won by Mr. Martin Loughlin's horse Handy Andy, by Panic,' carrying 11 st. 2 lb. The Port Phillip Stakes resulted in a victory for Progress, by Angler. He seemed much above himself, but as the pace was slow he got fairly on his legs, his indomitable pluck bringing him home a head in front of Bathurst. The Ascot Vale Stakes was a gift to that wonderful two-year-' old Navigator, a son of Robinson Crusoe and Coquette. The performances of this colt will make the Derbies of next year intensely inte resting, and Segenhoe, thohero of the spring, will have his work to do to beat him. Sweet William, a three-year-old, carrying 7 st. 31b., won the Brunswick Stakes, beating seven teen others, running the mile and a quarter in 2 min. 10$ sec; PoTlio,' 5 yrs., 6st. 121b. second, Mr. Iiang's stable ran first and second for the St. Leger with Commotion and Pell Mell, the winner of the Derby, in the spring, Darebin, obtaining a, third place. only. The time was 3 min. 16 sec, and the winner is from, an imported mare called Evening Star, by Lord Ohifden. Each of these colts has .been since sold by auction for 1600 guineas. On the second day Sir Thomas Elder secured the Sire's' Produce Stakes with Guesswork by Gang Forward from Perad venture. Fortunately aflaw in the nomination prevented Navigator from going to the post. The stake was worth about £000. Sir Thomas also ran second with Bassanio, another of the uncertain tempered Gang Forward, who was an unfortunate pur chase to send to the colonies. Twenty two horses started for the Australian Cup over two and a quarter miles. The odds , were . 5 to 2 against Swet t' William, 10 to 1 Suwarrow, 100 to 8 Pollio, 100 to 4 Wellington. It was won by Pollio, 6st. 41b.; Wellington, 8 st. 121b., half a length away, and Sweet William, 6 st. 131b., third. It was a very fast race, only occupying 4 min. J sec. Bathnrst, 4 years, 9 st. 5 lb., beat Dare bin, 3 years, 9 st. 41b., by a head for the Grand Stand Stakes, a mile and a half. The First' Nursery Handicap fell to Solitude, 2 years, 9st. lib., beating a large field. This filly is by Robin son Crusoe from La Mousse. On the third day the Second Nursery Handicap was won by Mr. A. K. Finlay's Coulstoun by King Cole, beat ing a good field. Then came the Newmarket Handicap, six furlongs, for which thirty-seven horses came to the post.- The. odds were 4 to 1 Hesperian, 6 to 1 The Ghost, 8 to 1 Larpent, 10 to 1 Hyacinth,- who jumped from 100 to 5 in a quarter of an hour'; 100 to 5 to 100 to 2 others, and amongst .the number at 100 to 2. was Euclid. Hyacinth won by half a length, Euclid second, and Larpent third ; the two first favorites nowhere. It was a grand race, and a wonderful sight to see so' many horses racing- down a straight course, the major portion beincr in a line for over four furlongs, when the pace began to find out the soft' hearted ones. The six furlongs were fun in lmin. 16iseo. Another fine race was that for the Town Plate, two miles, weight for age, with penalties arid allowances. It was won by Commotion, 8 st. 7 lb. ; Wel lington, 10 st., second ; Progress, 9 st.' 7 lb., third ; Pell Mell, 8 st, and Darebin, 8 st. 10 lb., nowhere. The time for this was ' 3min. 34sec.
