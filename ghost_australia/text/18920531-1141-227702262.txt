An Emphatic Denibl. Mount Zeehax, Tasmania, 22nd May.— Sib,— -In your last issue of The Spobtbhan I notice that you have an account of a contest which took place here between Jim Baxter Melbourne), in which it says that Baxter had Stewart knocked out, and only " corners " saved him. As a lover of fair play, 1 beg to give that account an emphatic denial, for during the whole course of the contest Stewart was never in danger. In the first round, which only lasted one minute and a half by the public's watches, although the timekeeper called it three minutes, Stewart bad Baxter completely at his mercy, and but for the interference of the referee he would have given Baxter his " sleeping draught." Z wish to know if on yonr side of the water it is considered a foul when A is on tbe ropes for B to strike him, B being still boxing to the best of his ability. The referee mentioned seemed to think so, for he actually pu/tat B off the other man. Stewart is going to Sydney next week, and if Baxter thinks he can knock him out be will have tbe opportunity of trying his hand. I allow he ran against the stiffest " snag" that he wants to on this terrestrial sphere. I reckon that Stewart can box him to a standstill in two rounds. As for the contest in question, Baxter had never a ghost of a show from 6tart to finish. The weights were— Baxter, lOst I01b; Stewart, 9sl 41b. As for the man he knocked out that night, lie had not lately come from Mel bourne. I question if he ever was outside of Tasmania, of which he is a native. His weight was 1st 101b. Ip conclusion, I wish to say tb&t; Baxter could not knock Stewart out if he tried for a month. As a proof of this, I may say that during the match when Baxter bad not enough wind to blow a match out, Stewart was whistling a few bars ot "Bonnie Dundc-e." Hoping tbat you will make your account a correct one, and knowing that yon are always a staunch sup porter of fair play. — I beg to remain, yours, " Clave rhouse."
