GHOSTS UNDER THE CAMERA. A curious photographic experiment was made yesterday — nothing less, in fact, than an at tempt to photograph spirits by flashlight. The scene of operations was a room in a city building, adjoining a busy street. There is no need to de scribe in detail the furniture and fittines ud of the room, because, 'as far as the eyes of the spec tators could see, nothing appeared. The theory was, however, that 'what was hidden from mere mortal sight might be seen by the eye of ^the camera, and recorded upon the photographic - plate. The 'medium' — a lady of mature years, who wore a sombre costume — sat in full view of everybody, in one corner of the room, and along side a small table. The other persons present were: Mr. Blow, of the Crown Studios, who took the photographs; Mr. J ? , a believer in spirit ualism, who sat alongside the medium while two of _ the photos, were being taken; a representative ot this paper, who sat beside the medium .while the two photos, were snapped; .and a representa tive of another paper. The camera was- placed in- £he opposite corner of the room to the medium, and carefully foeussed. The green blinds of the windows were lowered, but daylight pervaded' the -room, and a flame (for the purpose of producing the flashlight) stood alongside the camera. The medium went into 'what she afterwards explained was a semi-trance, and gave the word as to the number and kind of spirits in the room and the proper moment to snap-shot them. Eight or nine ghostly visitants were present (so the me dium said), Including Mr. Blow's mother, who, by-the- way, is not dead. They were duly flash lighted on to three plates, but, alas? and alack — when the plates were developed the ghosts failed to put in an appearance. Chairs, tables, etc., were there, but no spirits. So once more the un believer chuckles.
