POETRY. AN AUTUMN NIGHT. The night is drunk with beauty; in the air is flooded with a mystic melody, And waves of music, ravishingly rare, Laro all the ambient space 'twixt earth and sky, from rippling deal of lustrous light, the moon Smiles with soft radiance on night's perfect noon. The glassy bosom of the limpid stream Reflects the timid light of myriad stars. Whose shadowy rays, as in some fairy dream, Cage halt the slumbering world in surer bars, And wears a gauzy web of silvery sheen, From not to tower, from spire to village green. All Summer scenes are hushed; the spicy breath Of Summer flowers comes not, for they are gone; But their last fragrance, 5 yielded up in death, Singles with ripe fruit odours, and is borne In clouds of deathless perfume far on high, And angels breathe it with a rapturous sign. A solemn silence rests on land and sea, Spirits and genii haunt the midnight skies, And gentle ghosts through every moonlit tree Gaze heavenward with sweet and quiet eyes. Nature is regal in this Autumn night; Midsummer's amorous eyes are not so bright. -Argonaut.
