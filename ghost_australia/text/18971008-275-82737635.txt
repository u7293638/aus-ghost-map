AT THE THEATRE, They told the' same old storios, Thoy sang tho aamo old airs, They sat in ancient costumes On very modern chairs. While paper snow was falling* They cooked green ears of corn, And 'tvmsn't fifteen ceconds Between the night and morn, The same old villain plotted, The same old lover sighed, Tho same relentless pareut His eager suit denied. Thoy wroto in twenty aeconds A letter, or a will ; They waved in air their glasses, Yet drank them brimming still, Tho thunder lacked an echo, The moon was palo and weak, And when the ghost was rioing Tho crank set forth a squeak, Ah ! yes, tho same old pooplo ?With nothing new to tell 5 And yet, I must confess it, Too soon tho curtain fell.
