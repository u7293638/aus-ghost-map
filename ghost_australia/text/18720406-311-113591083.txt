"THE HAUNTED HOUSES," IN STAMFORD STREET, LONDON. A great deal of public interest and comment has been created for a long period owing to the very extraordinary proceedings in reference to a number of large and valuable houses in Stamford street, Blackfriars, Stiowhill,' Newington, and otheT pans of London having, for a period extending now to nearly half a centuty, been allowed to remain empty, and suffered to go into a ruinous state, the rental value of the property being many thousands per annum, one house, in Stamford street, alone, at the corner of Hatfieldstrett, which was formerly let at £100 per annum, having beefc allowed to remain empty for more thon forty years. The various premises "ere generally known as the M Haunted Houbb."," end crowds have collected occasionally round the bouses, particularly in Stamford street, upon 'he repart that a " ghost" had been seen walking about some of the rooms. The real history of the extraordinary matter appears to be tliis— the property in question originally belonged ti> a highly respectalble solicitor, named Reed, a man possessed of a large fortune, and he, from a mere whim, determined not to let any portion of this property. He died some 25 years ago, leaving, it is said, strict injunctions to his widow to carry out the same course, fiis directions were religiously obeyed, and at the death of the widow the same injunctions were given to the daughter, who carrieil out the same course of proceedings until her death, which took place recently aud father suddenly; and, by this event, the extra Ordinary condition of affairs in relation to this property will, ia all probability, now be changed, and the estate will bs put to some useful purpose. The habits of the deceased ladv were moat penurious. She resided in one of tf.e houses in Stamlbrd street, her only tslablishment consisting of one old woman ; anil the residence Of the old ''miser," as Bhe was generally termed, coiiia be easily recognised by its dirty and decapitated appearance. Periodically the two old women would make a visit to the other houses in the street, the time chosen being generally evening ; and, With lantern in hand, they would wander through the different rooms of the large ruinous buildings. These visits cave rise, no doubt to the ghostly rumours that were rife, and were the cause of the crowds of people assembling to see the light glimmering from room to room Almost immediately after the death became known, it appears that the parties claiming to be the heirs-at- law of the deceased took possession of the house where she resided ; and among the extraordinary rumors that are afloat in reference to the subject is one, which is believed to be founded on fact, that a sum of money, amounting to nearly £29,000, was found hoarded in different parts of the house, and concealed in all manner of out of the way places. At first it was rumored that the deceased had died without making a will, but it has since been stated that a testamentary document has been discovered, although no one, of course, is at present aware of its contents, or how the deoeased has disposed of the enormous amount of wealth of which she must have died possessed. It will, perhaps, be recollected that a lew years ago some parties took forcible possession of one of the houses in Stamford street, but it was speedily shown that they had no legal title, and they were forcibly ejected by order of a magistrate, and since then the whole of the property has remained in the same condition as before. It is not at all improbable that this extraordinary affair, which will be ranked among the romances of London, will eventually receive solution in the Court of Chancery ; bnt it is not likely, under any circumstances, that this valuable property will be allowed to remain very much longer in the condition it has been for nearly half a century, as the actual loss in rent upon the whole of the houses must, upon a moderate calculation up to the present time, be considerably over £100,000
