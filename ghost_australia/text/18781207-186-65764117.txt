CORRESPQXDEXCE. TWV. ABDSE OF THE SUFFRAGE. TO THE EDITOE OF THE CAFRIOO&SIAN.; fin*, ? -The !?$** election for Bockhainptan furnishes tnajjjf for grave reflection and Mfwp regret on the part of all right-tiunkhig men. The result oE rii«* ^wntw«t is no doubt a sur prise, and possibly cause of regret, to many of those who assisted to bring it about ; and if the general expression of opinion can be relied OH, tt Was itf^fT *T**'**Trat'rfn Or wnrmn^n tint it should have been exactly as it is. However, as the majority has wiued thai it shall be so, so it must remain until an tie mischief brought about by the in judicious manipulation of the popular vote. This election is perhaps one of the most glaring casffi that has occurred of tie evils tfop. ffMwjiity as at p«?a3it pxprri*wd in the Australian -vJ/mi^«r Manhood suffrage — which, to aU iiiIj*«-» and purposes it is in Queensland — is q^l very well if exercised as in theory it seems it ought to be, but when reduced to fh? test of practice, it l^^rr^ a powerful and dangerous weapon in *^'* hanJc of dfstgnfng wifn, and oners the m^m^ for unprincipled ambition to vault into power and to TVt^nP demagogues to obtain a nosiiiou in fhf councils of the ^wintry, which, mwlffr oi.1-nT -??? i^ai mqtaiHTjw, neither the one nor the other -%niM have ever/ attained to. It cannot be denied, nor would any right ri»»nl^TWfr mm of mn^fratnfm object, that all men of »'*«*n»g»*ncff should have a vote, must also be conceded, that those men who have risen, by force of character, industry, ?*\t^ ability, to prominent TMF^ityi*1*8 in the capital and property, should be allowed some thing more rti«» jm individual and solitary vote. It is actually taking away from these men the power and tiie right to protect them nuwity are men reduced to each a democratic the political arena, of an election bv universal (suffrage. It is in effect giving to one may be questioned whether on that account the more desirable depositories of political power — the privilege of anpointinc whomsoever they will, to make laws and govern the oounby for their own purposes, and fjlring away from— or rather not granting — the other class, the power, or opportunity, to protect then* property or the position to which they have attained by hard work, and onremittmg industry. It is actually teBing men of superior intelligence, cultivation, re finement, and ability, ' We want none of you, 'you had better seek some other field more suitable for your exertions.'' In point ' of fact, and tliis fact is a startling one wben ? considered, it reduces tbe highest and most j prominent citizen in the land, one eminent alike, for virtue, talents, patriotism, and ability, to the individual level of the lowest loafer who has resided six months in one place, an-j who has spent every copper be coold get hold of, whether by work or otherwise, in dissipation and debauchery. This is tiie effect of the working of the suffrage as at present in operation in tbis colony. Truly, it should uot be cause for boasting on the part of any legislator who was in^tnirnpntnii] in rajit.mtr it npon the country in its present form. As stated above, I would not deny to the working man the right to exercise his privilege of voting. There are those amongst the so-called working men — which term, by-the-bye, as capable of recording their vote in an intelli gent manner as any ****** ; but unfortunately there are others, ana these probably the larger proportion, who have not the time or the not ? *' *'^ '» fa* T y concerning their own personal welfare or the welfare of their Jamflies. These are the men who are open to be in fluenced by specious promises, and hy plausible representations ; and go to the ballot box, probably without any actual ill intention — but record their votes in such a manner as to elect men who can neither reflect credit upon the community they represent, the legislature they sit in, nor tbe colony at large. The remedy for this state of things is, to give to those men who hare worked up, or attained to a position to justify it, voting power in proportion to the property repre sented by *hg«n They would tfw*n be in a position, to some ^T^mf, to protect their rights and privileges ; and these glaring cases of misrepresentation, would not be so likely to occur. It 'w*rnn quite evident that the electors have altogether lost sight of the personal merits of the respective candidates; party feeling has been aroused in no ordinary degree, and e!ass prejudices hare been dog oat of the ashes of oblivion, where they bad rested Cor a 4**»n f * ii at3 Mb time \ tjwspt operating tqgHJMT, with a certain amount of pressure, possibly, on some of our rofrf'''*^ and arlimiw. as well probably as a large ''n?W of labourers draw ing wages from Government sources and under Governmental inflngncp, have brought about an unfortunate result. Tbe 'T^n repre sented by these classes would be quite enough to turn the election either one way or the other; and there is no doubt also that* large number of voters represented by the working men (so-called) have been caught by tibe anbV «^i«tfor tickipt. which of all tin1 tfffcwti'jii'.pjriBg cries ib the greatest hombog and rot ;and it is a healthy sign to find your contemporary, the Bridbant Courier, writing as it occasionally tjfff« on fki*- question. Let thflsft anti-squatter gentry consider for a moment, where they and tiuar pet working saaa wonld be, if it were not for the *'**rf*rff'ng spirits who have done the pioneering of this vast *nrt**wnt not here only, but all over Australia. Bat to con fine ourselves to due colony of Queensland, how far, let us ask, would these stamping gentlemen and their proteges have been from tfaf coahti to rtw* day, and how -w«-^r land would have been occupied or sold, i£ the opening of the country bad been left for them. OV assuming for tiie sake of argument that these men would have braved the hardship, inseparable from pioneering; would they not have jonff the very —***- ^yag that, the present p'frnrwl lessees have done? And what is that, but to do as well as they could for fji*Tnpfll11'p*1. and endeavour to protect and (reserve tfaat «rhiA titty bad wotted hard to acquire ? Certainly there is ftff^th)p io their present lin* of action to lead de to oditve they would do anytibing else ; Emtmnch to induce us to assume that if they and tfwir Igajfffru f*»*i tiie poflrtifl11* and Tmin*t of tiie men whom they so senselessly abuse, tiwy would use it with far leas moderation ; and what makes tiie tiling more absurd is, tiiat these people who are most rabid and un reasonable in their abnse of the squatters, ate getting their living fay them, either directly or indirectly. Again, look at the men by whose means an election ench as tK^ one under consi woold be employed on railway works, either if it were not for tibe squatter. Woolda railway be wanted, or would there be a ghost of a prospect of its paying, if depen dent on fi** ^pM^wjf^irjl op Tnfiif'jT ''tjm'st? These wo! nltunately, no doubt, become of immense 'wrportm**^! and irtnVf* wort for our railways ; but we have to deal with the pre sent, and we would like Mr. Stnirp an'thin followers to tell us where all tbe goods go to, and where all tiie down teaific comes from, which at the present moment is fF|^1ritiy fchi^ Geutral fisHway pay in tiie **'ot't it is. Take away tiie tzafiic con may take away the railway too. And yet tiie mfln who have rntahlirf*^' this interest, and been tiie means of opening op tiie country in a rapid and systematic wmiiw^ are held np to contumely, atniBJI| and represented as obstructing progress and remmtrnt And why are they thns abased? Because some of frl^^ir number, by a fftrfr*™?^ ^^wtlii ^ ^j^-n of circumstances, make money - hnt nothing is said or 'leard of the unsuccessful ones — those who work for years and lire a very hard and weary life, and who, perhaps, by a conibinatvBL of wnfflrtffHtty ww^sfanw^ arc swept from the surface, and heard of no more. Tbe subject is no doubt threadbare, bat much might be said about tiie utter absurdity of the anti-squatter cry. lam, &-l, T.X.
