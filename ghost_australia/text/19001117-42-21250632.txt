STORYTELLER. THE IRON-HEARTED CITY. CHAPTER XVIII. By B; PHILLIPS. OPPENHEIM, Author .of :. " Mysterious ;Mr. Sabin-' Whether Rice's point of view and judg-<*> ment upon Emily de Rouss were prejudiced, or not, Douglas certainly passed from her influence into a more robust and inyigorat- fng literary life. He gave up bis. expensive chambers, sold his furniture, reorganised Ills expenses, and took a single room in a dull little street off the Strand. Rice, aid ed fay a few friends, and also by Doug las's own growing reputation, secured his admission into the same Bohemian club to which he and Drexley belonged. For the first time Douglas began to meet those •who were, strictly speaking, bis fellows, and the wonderful good comradeship of his newly-adopted profession was a thing giadually revealed to him. Ht made, many friends, studied hard, and did some brll~ Hants work. He abandoned upon calmer reflection the idea of going at>road,. and was given to understand that his position on the "Courier" might be regarded ns a permanency, lie saw his future gradually, defined -in clearer colours, it became ob vious," to him that his days of struggling were past and aver. .He had won his place within the-charmed circle of those who bad been tried and proved. Only there was always at the bottom of his heart a secret dread, a shadowy terror, most oft?n present when, he found himself alone with f?ice or Emily de Reuss. It seemed to him that their eyes were perpetually question ing him, and there was one subject which both religiously end fearfully avoided. 'He was popular enough amongst the jovial, light-hearted circle of bis fellow workers and club companions, yet he him self was scarcely of their disposition. His attitude towards life was still eerioue, he carried always with him some sugges tions of a past which must ever remain an ugly and fearsome thing. His sense of hunwur was unlimited —in repartee he easily held his own. He was agreeable to everybody, but he never sought acquaint ances, and avoided intimacies. More es pecially was he averse to any mention of his earlier days. -Speedwell, sub- editor of the " Minute," 'buttonholed him one day at the. club and led him into a corner. . ' > "You are the very man I wanted to see, ... Jesson," he exclaimed. " Have a drink"." 'I've just dined, thanks,*' Douglas an swered.. ."^What can! do for you V: • >: "I'm. giviirg some space in my rag,". Speedwell explained blandly, " to a series of memoirs on prominent journalists of the day,.and I want to include you." "I'm sure you're very kind/? Douglas answered, "but you cant. be in earnest. To begin with, I'm not a prominent jour? nalist, and I don't suppose I ever shali "Well, you're a bit of a miracle, you know," Specl'well interrupted. "Y(oii*ve come to the front so quickly, and you've a method of your.own—the staccato, ner vous style, you know, with lots of colour and dashes. I wish I'd a man on the staff who could do it. Still, that's neither here nor there, and you needn't think I'm hinting, for I tell you frankly the " Minute" can't afford large salaried men. What 1 want, from you is a photograph and just a little sketch of your early life—where you were born, and where you went to school, and that sort of thing. It mayn't do you much good, but it can't do you any harm, and I'll be awfully obliged." Douglas was. silent, for a moment. The whole panorama of. that, joyless yflufh of Ills seemed suddenly stretched out before him. He saw himself as boy,- and youth, and man, the village -school changed into the Sectarian University, where the great highroad to knowledge was rank with the \- weeds. of, prejudice. He saw himself back again at the farmhouse, he felt again the v.aigue thrabbings of that discontent which had culminated in \a tragedy. He ,"was suddenly white almost to the lips, a mist seemed to hang - about the room, and the cheerful voices of the men playing pool j, came to him like c dirge from the far ' distance.^ Speedwell, waiting in vain for ills answer, looked at him Jin .surprise. " Arent you.well, old chap V' he asked. "You look as though you'd seen a ghost." Douglas pulled himself together with an effort. -■•-•■ . ■■■.•". t r , . -.i ; ;«. " I'm not .quite, the thing," he said. "Late night last night, I -suppose. I'm sure it's very good-of you to think of me, Speedwell, but I'd rather you^d left me out." V You see:l'm really only a novice, quite a Deginner, and:i don't feel I've the right to toe includeV : ; "That," Speedwell answered, "is our. bucinees. You .didn't come to us—l 'came to you. All you have to do 1b to answer a few .questions,. .and . let me have that photo." '■■ •■■ , ' .."-'■ .-..'■'. Douglas shook his head 7 ' - "You must please excuse me, Speed well," he said. "It's very kind of you, 'but to tell you the truth there are certain painful dncident? in connection with my life before I _■ came to. London which', I am anxious to forget. I do not choose to have a past at all." "■ ."; - Speedwell shrugged his shoulders, and lit a cigarette. He wbb none too well pleased. ■ . - -.' v ','r-M'sb*?~ f " You can't expect," he remarked; "♦' to Become famous and -remain at the same time unknown. There is a great and grow ing weakness on the part of the public to-day for personalities. I suppose it is ijthe spread of American methods id jour- Tifulsin which is responsible jor it. Some day your chroniclers will help themselves to your pas.t, whether you will or not." . J)Qugla§ rose up with an uneasy laugh. ..4'lt will be an evil day for them," he aid, "perhaps fpf me. But at least I fill not anticipate.''. -'■He wandered restlessly from room to toopi $( the club, returning the greetings ql his acquaintances with a certain vague ness, lingering noWhere more than a mo ment or" two. Finally he took his hat from •the rack and walked out into the street. Wonting him wss the Thames. He leaned ; gainst the iron falling and looked out flCros'f the dusty, sun-baked gardens to where the river flowed down between the bridges. Something of the despair which had so nearly broken hi? heart a_ short while Blnce seemed again to lay torment ing <!lutches.upon him.-. After all, _was not a man for ever the slave "of his papt ? No: present •success, no ; future, triumph could raise him,for brie moment out ot the reach, of that merciless hour. As a rule Ills „ thoughts- {recoiled, shuddering from even the slightest lingering about it. To night there. swept in upon him unreslsted a crowd of vivid memories. He caw tne quaint old village, '. its gray stone houses dotted about the hillside, the farmhouse "Which !bad been bis- home, bare," gaunt, every thing" outside "and. in typical of tho man- who-ruled there..and over "the little neighbourhood, a tyrant and a despot. Out of the mist he too came, six feet and well set up for all his seventy years, with a face as hard as the ancient rocks which Jiltted out of the Cumiberland! {hillside, eyes as keen and gray and merciless as though every. scrap oj humanity y/hicft might. fever (have ' lain behind them, had long since died out. Neat in his dress, precise though local in his speech, he was feared T)y every man In Feldwlck, whether he stood over them labouring, or prayed amongst them in the little chapel where every Sunday he took the principal place,,-Just he may have been, but neither man nor woman nor . child had ever heard a kindly word fall from hlB lips. Children ran indoors aft he passed, women ceased their gossiping, men slunk away from a friendly talk as though ashamed-, If ever.at harvest or Christmas time the spirit of goodfellowship warmed the hearts of these people and loosened their tongues, the grim presence of Gideon Strong wbb sufficient to check their" merri ment and send them silently apart. Ho had been known to pray that sinners might meet with the punishment they deserved both in this world and hereafter. Douglas shuddered as he recalled more than one such outpouring, which had seemed to him rank and utter blasphemy. He turned from the railings at last and moved off Strandwards. From the bid man hi? thoughts had passed on to the daughter. He remembered above" all other things, one night when his guardian had brought her to him in the oak-wainscoted parlour, full that evening, it seemed to him, of strange shadows and dreary lights, ,and had called to him sternly to hold out his hand. Ay, even those words of his came back, cold, precise, merciless. " Nephew Doug las, this is the woman, my daughter Joan, whom I have chosen to wife'for thee. Take her. hand and let thy word 'be pledged to her." The very image of her father, she had looked steadily into his face without tremour or nervousness. Her features were .food enough, but too large and severe for a woman : her, wealth fit black hair wao "brushed flat back from her forehead in uncompromising ugliness. " Her figure was as straight as a dart, 'but without lines or curves, her gown of homely stuff and ill— shapen, completed her unattractlveness. There was neither Mush nor tremor nor any sign of softening, in her cold eyes. Then Douglas, in whom were already ., sown the seeds of a passionate discontent with the narrowing lines of his unlovely life, who on the hill side and in the still cold hours when Frederick slept, had taken. Shelley to his heart, had lived with Keats, and who felt his heart beat thickly to .the passionate love music of Tennyson, stood silent and unresponsive. 'Child of chartiy he might be, but the burden of his servitude was fast growing too heavy for him. So he stood there whilst the old man's eyes flashed like steel,~ and Joan's face In her anger seemed to grow into the likeness of her. father's. i "Dost hear, nephew Douglas ?" Take her hands in thine, .and thank thy ;Go* Who has. sent thee, a paUper and a youth of ill-parentage, and-tof no account, a •daughter of mine for wife.'' .'■:-• >'".r'. He remembered bow at last he had; found his tongue: ' " . - "Uncle," he said,. "there has^ been no Word of this. between-Joan • and myself. I am not old enough' to marry, nor have I the inclination." . Terrible had been the look flashed i?wn upon, him from those relentless eyes—flerco too 'the words of his reply, measured and slow though they were :— .. . " There 1b no heed of words between thee and Joan. Choose 'between my bid ding and the outside of my doors, this might and for ever/ '•' .Even then he might have won' his free dom like a man, and Douglas groaned as. he thought of the wonderful opportunity lost; But the old dread was too deeply engrafted. The chains of "servitude which lie in common with the whole neighbourhood wore, were too heavy to be thrown lightly aside. So he held out his hand, and Joan's fingers, passive and cold "lay for" a moment In his. The old marl •watched without any outward sign of satis faction. ■ :.; . " Thou hast" chosen well, nephew Doug las/ he said, ignoring the fact that Doug las had not chosen at all. "The people here next, meeting will elect thee their pastor. Thou wilt have., three pounds a week and Bailiff Morrison's ■-cottage-' free." Then he had gone away, and Joan and he had remained looking at one - another Douglas wondered, -with a grim sense of the humour of the thing, whether he had expected any lovemaking to follow so strange an engagement. He looked curi ously at her. There was no change in her face, nor any signs of softening. " I hope you will Relieve, Joan," he said taking up a book and looking for his place " that I knew nothing of this, and that I am not.in any way responsible for it."- Her ,face .seemed to him to darken as she rose and moved towards the door. J<l am sure of that," she said. "I do not blame you." . ■ He walked on, past the door of his lodging and round many side streets, grimy and un pretentious. His memories had taken hold of him. It was Cicely now who was walking "by his .side, and his heart was beating with Something of the old stir. What a change her coming had made in that strange corner of the world. Cicely, with her dainty figure and bright sunny face, wonderfully light* hearted, n spot of "brilliant colour thrown suddenly across their gray life. She loved poetry, too, the hills, the sunsets, and those long walks across the purple moorland. They had drifted into a wonderful com panionship. 'He was her refuge in a new life, which she frankly declared to be pokey and horrid. She was a revelation to him —the first.he had had—of delicate femin inity, lull ever of suggestions, of that won derful world beyond, of which as yst he had ionly ■ dared to dream. It was she who kindled bis ambltipn, who unconsciously bade him recollect'tois manhood, and.preach .cd to him, ever silently, but with convincing eloquence, of the glories of freedom, And all the while Joan, from apart,'was watch ing them. No words crossed her lips, yet often on their return from a day's rambling he caught a look in her eyes which amazed him. Gideon Strong went oh his way,.un-" :seeing, stern and as unlbending as- ever, [even to-his youngest daughter, but in thosV days there was thunder always in the air. (Douglas remembered the Sensation and shuddered. Once he had come across Joan and her sister together suddenly, and: had .found it hard work to keep rom a shriek of terror.' There was a light in Joan's oyea —it seemed to him that' he had seen .it there often lately." Was there another Joan whom he did not know ? 'He turned at last into the Strand. He would go to his rooms and work for a while. •But as he walked slowly down, Jostled by many passers-by, Btill not wholly detached from that phantasmal past, there came to him a shock bo sudden and so overwhelm-" ing that the very-pavement seemed to yawn at his feet, and his heart ceased to beat. Towards him two women were slowly walk ing, holding their own ip the press pi the crowd-rone with horrified eyes already fas tened upon' him—the other as yet "uncon scious of his presence.'Nearer and'nearer they came, and although every impulse ol his "body 'bade him fly, his limbs were rigid, and every muscle frozen. For the women ■were Joan and her sisteiy- CHcely...^ After all, it .tyk?-rihe woman whaTte£u£ht him who passed''him Tjy, her, iin,wijlih,g;\com- l panion who reco.gieed \ htipl^'i lSnte, in spite of his altered dross" and bearing,, -,They were swallowed u?| in the : . crowd ;-, before Douglas had recovered hitpge.lt-.*.1! Something in Cicely's terrified-g^ejlhad^instantly checked his first instinct, which prompted him to accost them, they were gone, leav. ing him alike speechless and bewildered. He staggered into a small restaurant, and sitting at an unoccupied table, .called for a bottle of wine. With the first draught his courage re curned, his mental perspective commenced to rearrange itself. Cicely and Joan were in London. Cicely had seen him, Joan had not. 'Prom the first he had realised ' thab there was danger to him in. this encounter. Cicely had seen him, but she had made no motion of recognition, she had obviously re frained from, telling her sister of his near presence. " From this he concluded that whilst she believed in him, and was still his friend, Joan was his enemy. He rolled a cigarette with nervous fingers and lighted it. Did Joan suspect that he was still alive ? and was she looking for him ? To the world in general Douglas Guest was dead. How was it with these two girls ? There were various small reasons why they might be inclined to doubt what to other people would seem obvious. He recalled Joan's face, grim and forbidding enough, almost a tragical figure in her black garb, as severe, and saftribr* as-a'country dressmaker could fashion it. He must get to know these things. He must find Cicely. He walked thoughtfully back to the offices of the "Courier/ where he found some work,, which, for the time, completely engrossed him.,,'; •.' -.• .-:; ;;v; ,;': : \,.;::"■,;■', - The next morning the following advertise ment appeared in most of the London news papers :— . ' "To C. S. I must seej1 you.: British' Museum to-day at 4." "■■:"?.""! For three days Douglas watched in;-vain. Oh the fourth, his.heart gave a. great leap, for a sombre little figure stopped 'out fronT" an-omnibus at the corner of RusselL-square,' and stood, hesitatingly upon the pavement,, looking in through the iron Ijara at the Museum. He came across the street to her boldly—she turned'and saw him. After all, their greeting approached the conventional. He remembered to raise'his hat—she held out her hand —would have withdrawn it but found it already clasped in >is. "Cicely! How good of you. You saw my advertisement?" : "Yes." .• ..

" Douglas," slle said, " I was sure of it, yet it is a great weight >from.; my heart to hear you say so. Now can you take me somewhere "where we can talk ? I aaa afraid of the streets. I will tell you Why afterwards." He" called a hansom and handed her In. -After a moment's hesitation he gave the address of the restaurant where he had first met Rice. «5 " It is only a shabby little place," he ex-' plained to her apologetically, " but we can talk there freely." " Anyway," she answered, " how strange it seems to be here—in London with you." I There was a sense of unreality about it to him, but he only laughed " Now tell me about Joan." She hesitated. " It will not be pleasant." " 1 do not deserve that it shouia lie," he answered gravely. " She has always been quite sure that it was not you who was killed in the railway accident. She even imbued me with that belief." • " Her instinct there, at any rate, was true enough," he answered. !. ; " She also./believes,"- Cicely, continued, more- slowly,-." that you robbed and. mut ;dered\ father." .

In a distant corner they found a table to them selves, and he ordered dinner. '. , , " Well, we are safe from Joan here for a little time, at any" rate/ he said, laughing. "Are you, living ,with her,, then ?'V, - . Cicely nodded.... '■' Ye?.

"I think I could manage that." she .said softly. TJouglas went off to his club ..with a keen sense of having acquired a new interest ia life. (To be continued.)
