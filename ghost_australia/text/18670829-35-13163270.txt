THE DISCIPLINE OF THE BODY. Good Words for June contains an article by the Rev. H. W. Dale, of Birmingham, on " The Discipline of the body, from which we give the following extracts " When the Apostles warned men against ' fleshly lusts,' there is no reason to suppose that they meant to require Christian people to live a life of discomfort and privation But that it is necessary, if we are to live a pure and devout life, that we should firmly control our inferior instincts and passions, has been the common faith of all saints and carelessness in the discipline of the body is, perhaps, the real cause of the miserably ignoble life of many Christian men They) have no strong and clear vision of God, no fixed anticipation of everlasting blessedness and punt) Their love for Christ shoulders like a half extinguished fire without heat, without brightness, without intensity fleshly lusts' unsubdued, are the true explanation of their moral weakness and spiritual sluggishness If a man is conscious that his spiritual nature has no elasticity, that his religious life is dull and heavy, that his prayers have no heart in them, and his thanksgiving no rapture, that his Christian work is feeble and mechanical, a burden to himself, and no blessing to others, let him ask whether the flesh has not mastered the spirit, and set himself vigorously to assert his freedom " I him ask himself, for instance, whether he would not be a better man if he drank less It is not merely men who drink till they are drunk that are guilty) of intemperance, there are many people who do what is perhaps worse than that I have heard able medical men give it as their deliberate opinion that a man who gets drunk once a month receives less physical injury than a man who never loses self command, but drinks habitually more than he ought w Inch buffers most morally it may be hard to determine Unhappily, drinking which does not end in positive intoxication is regarded as innocent The men who are guilty of it would resent oxen an implied censure on their excesses They think they 'have freely,' but that they are blameless Their friends become used to their habits , mere acquaintances say that they never seem very bright or actix e, but charge them vx ith no sin, their own n consciences are drugged into silence, but all moral nobleness and all left) devotion inevitably disappear from their character It will not do to speak of excessive drink- ing as a vice of which only the poor are guilt) No rank or culture exempts us from danger Medical men have assured me again and again that in houses where no one would suspect it, actual drunkenness is the real cause of apparently inexplicable illness Now and then I have been shocked at finding that women, educated women of good family, and occupying a good social position, ore guilt) of it. There are circumstances which make the temptation to this vice specially) perilous to women whose circumstances exempt them from the necessity of earning their own bread Take the case of a young girl whose home before marriage was a very bright and merry one She was surrounded with brothers and sisters and troops of friends, her mind was occupied with her music, her drawing, and her books , two or three times a year she made long visits to relatives at a distance , she was as free from cart as the allies that neither sow nor spin, or us the birds of the air that make the spring-time merry with their songs , her whole life was joyous, varied, and animated After marriage she has to spend the greater part of nearly every day at home and alone Her husband leaves her directly after breakfast, and does not return till night She has her home and servants to attend to, but to a bright clever girl the managing of household affairs is apt to become de- pressing She has children band by e, perhaps, but the society of children does not give her the intellectual stimulus and excitement to which she has been accustomed Her heart dies down She gets vx cary of the grey dull grey under which she lives, and the habit steals almost insensibly) upon her of taking stimulants to make her pulse beat faster and her spirits move more lightly If she does not break it off at once, she is lost Let her do anything that is at all innocent to escape from her doom Let her get to her music again or to redrawing , let her spend her time in dressing herself damage), or in manufacturing the gossip vx which is common at morning calls, better still she can let her give herself vigorously to some kind), womanly), Christian work for the poor in which she can but a real interest Anyhow let her get some colour, some animation into her life from harmless sources, or else she xxiii soon be ruined, unless she can (and health) excitement somewhere, the dulness, stillness, and sameness of her life will be her destruction ' "As for 'fleshly lusts,' which betray us into sin, the line of duty is simple and definite we must abstain from them Every) man must learn for himself xx here his own danger lies, and then must resolve, at vx latex or cost, to have done vx ith. his sin Our choice lies between yielding to the degrading bondage which has made us despise ourselves, and a life inspired with the Holy Ghost a. life of strength, joy, and blessedness It is of no use to try to pray, unless we abstain from that which makes prayer dull and heartless, and renders us incapable of receiving the very blessings we ask for It is of no use to try to meditate on the majesty and goodness of God, unless we abstain' from that which almost incapacitated us for lost) meditation, and which, it for a moment vx e are six ept upwards among the harps and songs of angels, sink us down at once into our earthly dust again For some men to rise to a noble life it may be quite as necessary to eat less as to pray more to spend less time over their wine as to spend more time over their Bible, to ride, to walk, to run, to bathe, QB to engage in regular and earnest Christian vx York We wait for the redemption of our body , but we must not wait for the Resurrection to liberate us morn ' fleshly lusts ' these ' xx as against the soul and unless the) are resolutely) resisted and subdued, the soul may be in peril of final destruction
