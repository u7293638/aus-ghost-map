NAT ASQUA. CHAPTER I. "THAT was twenty-five years ago, Dick. But there was a Becret in that story of your birth that I ken't puzzle out yet. Richard gave the boat an impatient jibe, " Let's call it a disgrace, and be done with it," he said, in his abrupt, dog matic tone. " A man's a fool that has any mysteries in his life nowadays. Like a cheap play 1" Old Inskip pulled up the center-board uncertainly, and let it down again. His fingers, with the rest of his spare old. body, had hesitated add deliberated fill through his tardy life. " Luff, Dick! 1 think I'd like to say a word or two to you before we land," Richard nodded, and steered the boat out into the channel. ' Be went on for a while, calculating silently how many eysters would be needed for planting next week, and then, glancing at the old man's anxious face, his eyes began to: twinkle. Usually he left his old com-, rade the two or three hours he required for the incubation of an idea; but this subject had galled the good Matured young fellow a little, and had better, he thought, be put out of the way at once. " There's no use of trying to put the word or two so that it won't hurt me, sir. That old story don't matter to me a wbit; not the weight of a straw. When I was a romantic cub of fifteen I used rather to hug myself on the idea of being a foundling. But I've no time for such follies now. I've never felt the needotfa father or mother:" Inskip rubbed his hairy legs with the palms of his hands. "Haven't you, Dick ?" He hesitated, looking at the other shore. " God knows I haven't sir 1" Heartily. Dick dapped his big hand on the otlter rnan'S shoulder, shaking every bone in His body. " There's not a young fellbw on the coast whose father and rttothef have done for him what you hare .done forme. You know that Now let's be done with that old matter. As for a father and mother that I never saw, they are not of bo much importance to me as -as this boat here. Sow could they be ?" Inskip looked at him doubtfully as Dick began to whistle, interrupting him-, selfpresendy with-'" What diid DeGonce j otter for the oysters ?" " Two, or two-twenty." The boat pushed along, muddying and cutting the fungus like growth of sea* weeds beneath. Boat or horse must go like steam express under fiichanrs guidance. He would have gpae post haste over the Sty*, good-naturedly inventing a better tiller for Charon as 'he went, and giving Him gratuitous hints in navigation. Inskip, according to his custom, sat watahtng him, looking, in his bare legs and arms, and leathery shirt and trousers, like a bony continua tion ofthe woodenbow. Nothing could be so' manly in his eyes as the boy's broad, bluff figure and decisive ftce, yet a vague doubt hung hazy in his br&tq; of: shallowness. Shallowness. Were oyster beds, and New York trade, and the boat, the real things after all? To the old fisherman, who had' never had' wife or child, the diin ghosts of this father abd mother;; the mysterious untold story of birth and death'; the inexplicable sweet danger of' lbve some day coming' to Dick, were the actual matters of: fife. Though, if you were to talk to Inskip-for years, he would serve you with no better matter than plans for fishing, or thin, pointless stories borrowed entire frofo his grandfather,, the sole contribution the Inskip family were likely to make to the world' of thought There was a necessity for him to speak to the point now, however, and at oncet as they were pushing papidly innbore. " I must go-back to thst'otd story once more, Richard." "Very well, .sir. Will yon- haul in that sheet?" "The woman who brought you here said your mother vnd father were dead. She did not tell even me more than that though she knew I would take you when she died; Three years ago I had a I letter, sending money. It was ftotn yonr mother." " What did you.do with iti?" sharply, " I sent-h back, Richard;" " Right." Dick began to -whistle again, to keep his tongue stilL He would not reproach Inskip. But, with his propensity for managing other people's1 affairs, it was hard on htm that his- own j should have been taken out uf his liands. He would have liked to deal with this woman who had' entaile.l her guilt on him at birth, deserted him till now, and was coming thus late to shame him. " There is something else, Richard. I had a letter from her the other' d»y. It was not dtted nor signed. It only saidl that your mother would be here this! summer, and begged that you would not i leave the beach." I Dick for a while silently pulled and! wound bis ropes. " If she comes, leave j me to meet her," he said at last, quietly. | He did not ask to see the letter, but I jumped on shore. "I'll go and settlei that job with De Conce," nodding good by, pleasantly,ashewalkedoff. This busi nesss of his motherhe had also settled and set aside. Inskip looked after hita with a queer, quizzical smile. Were love and passion, remorse, death itself jobs which j Dick could'attack with his shrewd eyes, and hat cocked on one side-sort, label, and clap on the shelf as-finished? The old man could not put his thoughts into words, even to himself,: but he remem bered vaguel) a carpenter he had seen once finishing off a lot of coffins, dis missing each .with a nod of satisfaction. He loosened the sail and drifted out into the current, while Dick's stout, swinging figure, in its sack and trousers of brown tweed, and jaunty cap atop, went steadily acros|the marsh, in sharp relief against the farliorizon. It seemed to have ab< sorbed into itself all the energy of the hot, sleeping landscape. The Natasqua hardly deserves to be called a river. It is one of those open ings into our rocky coast through which the sea stretches its groping fingers on the hills, and lays upon them the spell of jts own loneliness and quiet. Inskip. floated along the banks of red clay which edged the water; the wind hardly stiirpj the bit of blue tape hanging down froro his hat; the fieldB ,of feathery wild parrot belting the shore glared white in the afternoon sun; the brownish' l&dge;* of hills rose, tier beyond tier, shutting him in from a world of which- he never had known anything, and the . wfttefc ftft colored on the surface, and cold SIJjl brackish on the hottest day, gunk in sombre, impeneirtble depth* beneath him.

They stayed with Dick oddly; he fancied ihern steady and searching; weighing label ing him at his value. Richard hud met her once or twice since, and they had talked of the fishing and marl. It was growing dark when she tied her kelp into a bundle; the jelly-fish, in luminous blobs, rose here and there in the sheet of dark water, kernels of soft white fire. " I must go home," she said. It itemed quite natural to Richard to walk beside her, and he did it naturally, as few city-bred men would have the art to do. To be sure, she was not like the iaw4xmed women he knew, in their slea£y pink calicoes, but as for any difier ence of rank between her and them- it neveroccurred to him that there was any. : He was a man, and they were Women; -that was all (here was about it. ?

But the inferior orders of God's creatures also were made to be of use. The sheep gives us wool, the cow beef, and this young man-" " May give an advertisement," added his daughter. " Precisely," turning his glaring topaz ring leisurely in the sun. " What's o'clock, Romaine?" (To be Continued.)
