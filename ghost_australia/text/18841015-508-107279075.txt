Pepin wasftBtormyonetoboA. It«wa,»factyateag and eleepleaa misery. *I love him! Oh, how I lore him I' was the feeling that dominated every other sentiment of Bertha's souL ' How could I help loving him P TTo is all t.hnt is 0aod and noble---the one beinsr in the world that has ever awakened my affection -— the only one that ever can 1' For a few minutes at a time she would remain bo completely under the domination of this senti ment as to be oblivious to all others, now assur ing herself that the dark elouds would aeon be Bwept from her heavens, and that she would emerge into the sunlight of a glorious dayr-and How torturing heraeM with despairing fears to the verge of madness. 'But it is wrong to love him I' she would soon assure herself, with a desolation beyond expres sion. '? He is the husband of another ! Mj pro mise prevents me from telling him who i am, and for another to tell him would be at the least a great torment and scandal. He can never be aught to me, or X to him ! Then why should we torture ourselTaa with interviews which will only lead us deeper and deeper into a hopeless misery ?' The night brought her so little repose that she deemed it as necessary as proper, when the prince fcgaiu called at the mill, to send him word that fehe was confined to her room by illness. * HI ?' repeated the prince, as he gave his in formant—the miller's wife^-a look of the most searching and anxious description. ? Yes, Bhe is really ill, your highness/ declared the good woman, who was much distressed by the griefs of Bertha. * But I think your high ness is the best physician she can have. Were I in your place, I would enter, if only for a few moments.* ? Tell her, then, that I must see her— and in deed I must !' ' Well, pnoe more/ said Bertha, eadly, -when the message was reported to her, * But his high ness will only gira himself and me a great misery !' At sight of the countenance she turned towards ?him, upon his arrival in her presence, the prince fetarted violently, but not more so than did Bertha at view of the unusual pallor which had taken permanent possession e£ Pepin's features. * You, too, have suffered, then P* she murmured, as he took a chair beside the conch upon which she was reclining' ? I have not slept a moment since my former visit/ he returned. 'Can I forget the tried and desolate soul I left behind me f ' You do comprehend me, then, and pity me ?' ' You must never doubt it. That there is some fie between us other than we have confessed or diecusBed I cannot for a moment doubt. That there is to be some further tie between us in the future I will never for a moment cease to believe. But when will it be reoognised ¥ 'Perhaps in the great world to come/ mur mured Bertha. ' Do you not believe in the im mortality of the soul P' f If I did not, I should be the most hopeless as well as the most miserable of men/ replied Pepin, holding her hand in suoh a firm grasp that the pressure would have pained her but for the greater thrill of |oy it gave her. * He who really believes in the existence of any soul at all, at any time or plaoe, must necessarily believe in its immortality.' ' Then there will always be one hope between us, Prince, that no power on earth can rob us of, or forbid us to cherish/ She reflected a moment intently, and added s ? The promise which seals my lips is only for a brief season/ ' No, not even though it were to remain in force to the end of the world/ returned Pepin. ' This touch of hope we are permitted to ohenoh, and even this mnoh is batter than all else in existence. But to whom waa your promise given t ' Bertha was silent, asking herself if she could Answer the question. ?You promised not to shew yourself to your friends T queried Pepin, understanding the scruples that occupied her. ? I did, your highness/ 'And you also promised not to reveal your Hame and identity to any human being f ' The girl bowed assent. ? And is that all you promised F \- That is all/ * Then there is nothing in the world to prevent f ou from answering my inqsixy/ proolaimed Pepin, triumphantly, 'Ton oan aae this for yourself at a glance. Please tell ma, therefore, to whom you gave your promise/ ?Toft waggoner named Servis/ fQerns! The waggoner of thai name who came from SenUsf *? The very earne/ ♦ Why, the said Serwia baa been appointed to some post in the household at the request of my -wife/ eaid the prince, wonderingly, rl|any thanks for the information, Bert assured ttjat J shall on it very discreetiy^-^' The conversation was interrupted at this point t-y the entrance of the miller's wife, in a fluster of joyous surprise. 'The young man is coming}* she announced. * Indeed r ejaculated the prince. ♦Let aim come immediately to me/ innrmarad Bertha, with sudden animation, 1& sot go, Prinoe/ she added, as Pepin arose. *I wantfci introduce Dimon to yon.

'I suppose everything is explained and understood between you ?' * How understood between us ?' asked Pepin, in astonishment. ' Why, that you have -discovered who the young lady is, and ? * 'Excuse me/ interrupted Pepin, 'I haven't made the least discovery in the premises/ * What J Don't you know who she is ?' 'I haven't the remotest idea/ ?Indeed?* - For a moment Dimon was silent, looking startled and confounded. 'I have told his highness nothing about my self,9 eaid Bertha, ' nothing more than I told you, or as much.' Dimon looked from one to the other in a won dering amazement, and for a few moments seemed undecided as to his course. ' May I now ask you a question or two ?' asked Pepin, turning to Dimon. * Most assuredly, your highness/ ' Do you know who this young lady is V ' I do/ The prince turned pale at the declaration, it was so entirely unexpected. As to Bertha, she sank back upon her couch in wondering1 amaze ment, and gazed at Dimon in a sort of affright. ' What 2 you know her name — her history — all that concerns her ?'. continued the prince, breath lessly. ' Everything, your highness/ A wild cry, as much a cry of terror as of joy, escaped Bertha, as she clasped her hands and raised her eyes. ' I call Heaven to witness/ she cried, ' that I have not broken my promise/ 'Who is she ?' demanded Pepin. The eyes of both Bertha and the prinee rested upon Dimpn's face as fixedly as if they were a prey to some resistless fascination. ' It is not from my lips, your highness, that you must learn that secret/ said Dimon, gravely. ' I will even go further than that, and declare that the proper hour has not come for the infor mation to ba given yon. Has your highness faith in met' ' Every faith in the world/ was the instant re sponse. 'Why shouldn't I have? You are Di mon of Dimonville, are you not P' ' Certainly/ * Well, your ^ancestors and mine have fought side by side in many an honourable battle during the last three hundred years. I would trust you with my life at any time or under any circum stances/ ' Many thanks/ 'But why do you ask such a question?' de manded the prince, quiokly and earnestly. 'Because I am now asking you to put the greatest of confidences in me/ deolared Dimon. ' I want you to feel that I am doing right in withholding from you the secret of this young lady's identity. I want you also to believe me when I say to yon that a graver duty than that of learning her identity rests upon you at this moment/ 'Explain yourself?' ' Briefly, then, your presence at Herstal is now a matter of the gravest and most pressing im portance/ ' You have just come from there ?' ' I have, your highness. I have been in the saddle since midnight/ ' You saw the princess, I suppose ?' * I saw your wife, your highness.' * What -h you mean by that ? Is not my wife a princess V * It is not for me to tell you what she is/ said Dimon, arising. 'But if you love this hapless victim of wrongs that would cause an angel to weep/ and he indicated Bertha— f if you ever hope to see her again— if you wish to know who she is— and more especially if you wish to know what horrors have been and still are taking place in your palace of Herstal, then into the saddle at once, and ride like a winged avenger {* The prince was dominated by the words and actions of Dimon, even more than the latter had expected. ' You speak in riddles/ he teaid, arising quickly, * but I know yon have good zeasons for your con coct/ * The very best/ proclaimed i-imon. * Does not yonr own soul tell you that you and this young lady 'are both the victims of a gigantio and hideous wrong— a horror beyond compare — a vil lainy the most startling P All I can say is that yon have only to return to Herstal to read the B&tpage; of this great inigni&/ ' Enough, DimonJ I start m a moment.
