The Criterion. 'Captain Fritz' gains in favour as its simple ? beauties become familiar, whilst ' Tommy Atkins,' which gains a triple encore without satisfying the demands of the audience, is rivalling the success it achieved in London. Although the name part is the central and 'greatest attraction in the piece, there is much opportunity for the other members of the cast. Mrs. Walter Hill and Mr. Percy Brough make eVery ' ? ? point, and the manner in which the economic house keeper submits to the blandishments of Captain Fritz is highly amusing. The Sybil of Miss Dot :i Frederick is very charming and natural, and the in- 9 structions to rritz m singing and his effort to . actually catch the note make one of many idyllic bits in the comedy. Little Jessie Mead, the boy baronet, plays with much ability. . The bubble scene and song delight all heareis. Surely no ghost was ever bo pretty as the child standing in the rosy glew of the fire. The mistress of Vereku Chase, loved by one man who thinks himself too poor to declare his feelings, envied by another who wants her lands, and punished for her liking, of the pictu resque gipsies by insults from ene of the tribe and the robbery of her child, has a difficult part to play, and in her effort to be earnest is somewhat too gushing, whilst the impecunious and unscrupulous heirat law gives Mr. G. Lash Gordon good opportunities. The gipsy camp makes an effective scene, the hand some dog Carlo helping- in the capture of Simeon Slagg.' The music to the comedy is well written, aud the songs are excellent. '
