TUE ÃŽMERCOLOKIAL EXHIBITION. . them the Australasian, October TI.) MAtltlNKRT AXV lMrLPMBNTS. 1 Jiv departments of machinery and implements are, perhaps, the most important in this splendid Exhibition for in a country where manual labour is exceptionally high priced, tons rates by which it may be economised are exceptionally valuable Neither are these departments the least interesting There is a kind of interest in moving and working apparatus that the most beautiful and curious of altogether inanimate objects cannot boast, and we expect to find the north wing and the annexe become the favourite resort at least for male visitors, while the show continues and that much useful information will be required from observation of the machinery at work then. In noticing the machines and implements exhibited, it will be the most convenient arrangement to begin with the engines which drive the machines shown in motion There, are two of Clayton and Shuttleworth's portable engines, lodged under sheds in the north quadrangle One is of sixteen horse power, and its only task is to work a centrifugal pump wku thrown into the air a stream of water said to be equal to fifteen tons in a minute, which, falling into a basin in the venue of the quadrangle, is again thrown up by the pump, so long as the engine is kept in motion I hie pumping apparatus is exhibited by Mr Wright, of Little Bourke street Only five or six horse power is required to work the pump, so that the engine his an easy time of it. The other engine is of twenty horse power and by means of a driving belt carried through the wall, and driving shafts and drums cir need along the roof of the north wing it gets motion to the several machines to he described The two engines are shown by Messrs W dkie, M Rich, and Co., and the connexions were fitted by the artificers ofthelioilwo) Department and Mr Wright Entering the north wing, a fine collection of implements exhibited by Mr I C Christy, locomotive superintendent of the Victorian Railways, commands attention First, there is a room for weming lubricating pads for axle boxes of carriages and waggons, both the machine and its product being objects of considerable interest The room, which is handsome in design and highly finished, was planned and constructed in the railway shops, Williamstown, and it is in operation before the eyes of the visitor making a kind of plush web, something like Brussels carpet in texture, of cotton and woollen worn and cotton west The loom, its product, and the use to which the latter is applied, are all worthy of extended notice, but for that they must wait Next in order of the railway) exhibits is a seven inch self-acting screw cutting lathe, b) Whitworth and Co, which was yesterday seen in the act of cutting the spiral upon a male screw The cutting tool is not held in the hand of the attendant, but applied by the machine itself A twelve inch universal shaping machine, by the same bankers, is used for cleaning up castings which are to be used in machinery, and which must be wrought with the utmost precision This is a beautiful implement It can operate on either flat or curved surfaces, and indeed no casting, whatever its shape, comes amiss to it Beside it is a hydraulic apparatus for testing steam gauges up to 150 lbs, 130 being the highest pressure allowed on the Government railways Attached to it is a 5 Togo with colonial improvements, being a toll rate under bond, which records the highest pressure to which the boiler has been subjected, and which acts as a check upon drivers A machine for bending steel rings, by means of a long and strong lever, rather puzzles visitors, as they could tell by its look what the use of it is The rings so bent attain some elasticity, and being placed round the pistons of locomotive engines prevent the escape of steam b) pressing against the sides of the cylinder in their turn to unload themselves An important colonial improvement in those rings, and in their application, is exhibited Also black and slide -valves, in gun metal, a patent self acting lubricator, which comes into use when trains are on descending gradients, and there is no escape of steam to keep the piston rod moist, and an ingenious patent injector A nail making machine, exhibited by Mr Hart, Queen street we shall describe when we have seen it in motion Next to it is a machine, perhaps the most curious of any in the Exhibition It is a lathe, exhibited by Mr M lllisms, for turning axe handles on the American pattern, and everybody knows what unlike) subjects that are for a turning lathe Still, the thing is done quite simply), and was done yesterday to the great delight of many observers The process is via like that by which pictures are copied in outline, where in point describes the lines to be transfered, and a starting point, connected with the first, follows its ever) motion at some little distance, and so describes the desirous lines Ihcutldl) shaped axe handles are turned in something like the same way The father has two sets of chucks and between the upper set a model handle is taxed Beneath, a piece of wood of the proper size is placed, between the second pair of chucks, and as the shaped llanillo revolves, it so acts upon the cutting instruments, in contact with the piece of unformed wood, is to produce out of the second an exact copy of the first Even the square part of the handle, which fits into the head of the axe is thus turned into its proper shape This is an American machine and after see to it at work it is easy to understand how in that country shoemakers lasts and wooden dolls are turned in lights Mr I anvil, of Richmond, shows a skin splitting machine which performed yesterday) with great success 'The skin is dragged and pressed against a formidable cutting knife and being kept in its place by a revolving cylinder, the two surfaces are cut report "We saw a tanned (but still well) hide so split yesterday), and one half again split, with apparent cause and success It seems one nth charge of this pioiCis is that the piece usually shaved off by the gunner and lost, is by its means saved for use, in the form of a second sheet of leather from one hide A knitting machine b) Long and Co , Bourke street, and a frame knitting machine b) Howley and Penn, of Latrobe- street come next in order, and the latter attracted a good deal of notice, it is a stocking making machine, improved by the exhibitors on an American model, and in general appearance much more resembles a sewing machine than an old fashioned stocking frame A stocking was being made by it yesterday, the cotton being drawn from six races, three containing white and three coloured ) one So far as it goes, the instrument seen s to work speedily and well, but it can only make stocking legs, or rather tures of cotton, like largo lamp wicks Length enough for two stockings is knitted and then the web cut in two, and feet made out of the leg material Water engines next claim our attention, of which five are exhibited, in motion First there is a disc engine, exhibited by the patentee and manufacturer, Mr Wordsworth, of Swanston-street With is much "Yan Yean fluid as an inch and a half pipe can supply it with, it is said to be of about three horse power. It was yesterday engaged in driving a printing machine, and seemed to work pleasantly and well Mr Miva), of Collins street, exhibits a h) drastic reaction turbine, with patent reflectors and a small horizontal engine (three and a half inches cylinder) capable of being easy turned into steam from a water engine Mr Henderson, of Little Collins street showsahighlv our mental and even elegant turbine wheel, which with water supplied through a half-inch pipe will have something like one-horse power This turbine his three revolving arms, while Mr M Kay 's has but two Mr George Dunn, of Emerald hill, is Die inventor and exhibitor of a rotary water engine, which with a 12 inch water supply could, he informs us, be of four horse power It has 'n reversing motion, and was at work yesterday like the others Of printing machines and presses there is a tolerable collection, and the old wooden engine with which Mr Fawkner printed the Patriot in the early days of Port Phillip settlement, looks like a ghost among them A more remarkable contrast there could hardly) be than between this rude and primitive implement and the clockwork-looking machines of the present day, which almost seem as if they could produce newspapers complete with no other help than the turning of a crank handle Messrs Clarson and Massina exhibit a double demy machine by WA Lonsdale, which was seen in motion by yesterday, and much admired Mr T B Franklyn shows grasses and other material in some variety Messrs ! Purton and Co are the owners of an excellent little machine by Woods (an English maker), by which one man can print 1600 foolscap shoots in an hour (the work of about six men and six boys with a hand press) The machine is worked with a pedal Mr Calvert also supplies some presses and other materials But the gem of this collection is Messrs Sands and M'Dougall's railway ticket printing machine It is a really beautiful instrument, and seems to be as good as it is pretty It prints 10,000 tickets in an hour, numbering them in arithmetical series, and printing numbers on both ends if required A very pretty spiral crew arrangement gives lateral motion to one taking roller, b) which means the ink is equally suddenly) spread over the roller which comes into contact with the type It is self-acting both as regards feeding and flying, and if any irregularity occurs in the supply of imprinted tickets, the machine invites the attention of the attendant operator by nng egg a bell The numbering apparatus is simple and effective There are four revolving wheels, each of which has the numeral types from 6 to 9 arranged in succession on its outer rim, and every time a ticket is printed one of these wheels makes a tenth part of its whole revolution, and so prepares a new number for the succeeding card This machine was much admired An imported machine called a devil is exhibited by Messrs Tronson and Hill, of I Lygon street. It is used for grinding woollen rags for flock The rags are fed to the machine between fluted rollers revolv- ing towards each other under strong pressure Beyond is a 3ft 6in wooden cylinder, in which are 10,000 steel pins of about three quarters of an inch long by) which the rags are taught and torn asunder, the cylinder revolving at the rate of 1000 revolutions a minute V fan, revolving at the rate of 1800 revolve tions a minutes dm es off the dust Very considerable power is required to drive this machine, and it can dispose of four tons of rats a week A small hand comb making machine will be noticed it a future time Mr Selle, of Canning street, Carlton, exhibits a frame for making mould candles capable of making ninety six at a time Mr Matheson has some excellent masons and other tools, among which the most noticeable is a hammer for dressing bluestone, with eight faces, like a bunch of chisels Marsden p t ntl Bean show a case of well finished tools for modellers and ornamental plasterers John Grayson i exhibits a case of tools and knives tor gardeners, I butchers , saddlers , in , work, which appear to be of , excellent quality and finish Mr I ugton, of I Little Lonsdale street, has two machines which might very well have been done without, namely, a blow pipe for inflating meat, and a squirt for erecting melted fat under the skin It is to be hoped he will be disappointed in his expectations as to their sale Air Ditrmissen exhibits several specimens of cork and indiarubber engine packing the construction seems very ingenious, and we should not be surprised if this new picking were to prove tighter and more lasting than hemp and cosier on the piston rods than metallic packing It consists of cork or indiarubber, wire gauze, cotton and grease We have been informed that it is used) extensively in use Mr Henson show is a bullet compressing machine, and a collection of even thinking ample men's and materials A very highly finished threshing machine, belonging to Messrs Robinson and Co , attracts attention by the high polish to which l's wood and metal have been brought It is a peg machine, without anything novel in its construction A wooden model of an electro-magnetic engine and some washing Mid amalgamating apparatus are also in this department, as well as a useful looking hand apparatus for sawing timber, exhibited by the Hon Mr Anderson A machine for dressing New Zealand flax, by Mr 3 Feed, is, we presume, an experiment On the table in the centre of this wing are many articles not yet noticed ; among others several working models of steam engines, which would no doubt prove highly amusing to the public, and particularly to the young, if the exhibitors could obtain a supply of steam and start them. Some of the eve little engines are highly meritorious productions Leaving the machinery wing, in which no doubt there are many useful objects which we have omitted to notice, we pass to the annexe, and there we again find a fine collection of objects highly important in the industrial arts Messrs Danks, of Bourke street, exhibit a fine glass case full of their own brass castings, chiefly suitable for gas and water fittings, and apparently extremely well executed Mr M'Ilwraith, of the Melbourne Lead Works, shows samples of lead piping and sheet lead of various thicknesses Mr Coop of Little Collins, street, shows a fine collection of lead piping, from Hx inches down to the smallest (composition) gas pipe and , also lead wire Mr J Letcher, of Bourke street, has several samples of wire work on show , and it is highly creditable to colonial skill that in the last three named departments of industry the samples shown reconsidered by compttentjudgestobcas good as could be made The stills exhibited are only three in number, and all are constructed to receive c a charge of about fifty gallons of wine or wash The first is by Mr. Jaeschke, of Adelaide, a very elaborate affair, which scarcely explained itself, and which the owner was not near yesterday to interpret It has a great many vessels and connexions, and is in what is called by coppersmiths "dull work' The next is by Mr Gob), of Lonsdale street, in half polished copper, and tins the distilling and refrigerating apparatus in separate compartments This seems a useful still the third is by Messrs. McKay and Co Collins street, is of polished copper, and has two connected departments -the still below, and a recent gangland conducing apparatus above By this still the spirits can be brought up to an) required strength All three still we presume to be chiefly intended for vineyard n t 'the most prominent objects in this part of the Exhibition are the wool presses Messrs 1 nation and Shaw, and Messrs J Robinson and Co , show some really spit did ones, towering up into the roof and puzzling uninstructed observers As strong as wood and iron can make the air, and as gay as paint as I gilt can make them, the) form quite a feature in the annexe, but we do not observe anything novel in their construction, except in the case of one of Messrs 1 union and Shaw s, which we shall describe on a future occasion Mr Home, of A Beckett street, and Messrs Robinson and Co , exhibit some fine wine presses and grant mills and the first named shows a really formidable looking four horse power bone-mill Mr I region, of Lonsdale street, exhibits several useful in tides, among which may be here enumerated a patent sausage machine, w tile revolving block of Huon pine, and a lever by which the machine may be more chaste) stopped when that is required Also a road scraping machine of very light draught, its wheels being twine) inclus A sawing, planing boring, and morticing machine, by Briscoe, for the use of joinery is in Clarence and elegant machine In coopers work then on some very meritorious exhibits, among which some immense oaken wine casks are not the least noteworthy Churns English, American, and Victorian-born exhibited in abundance, but we shall now only mention one It is a barrel churn, with fixed dashers inside, but slung diagonally), as if the axle passed from the top of one end to the bottom of the other No doubt, this engine would agitate the cream entrusted to it in a very violent manner, it would be Moiently flung from end to end of the turn at every revolution There are many other useful and elegant farm. implements, which we can scarcely hope to describe at length to day Ploughs, harrows, reaping, and thresh ing machines, gram crushers, chaffcutters, 'vc arc plentifully exhibited A drill by Robertson and Co , may be just mentioned It is for sowing artificial grasses upon virgin soil (without cultivation), which it accomplishes by a row of trees, which make scores in the ground, into which the seeds afterwards fall, through tubes, to save trouble to future visitors, however, we must not omit to explain the nature and use of a very strange look and bulky object in the annexe, which even bod) stems greatly puzzled with. It is on unproved silk Hour dresser, manufactured and exhibited by Robert Doddington, of Queensberry -street, and though it looks outside like a twenty foot long meat safe of eccentric shape, it is a highly- li nish ed article In a she d beyond the annexe there is one of Mr E Chambers' stone-breaking machines, a very hand- some spring dray by Mr Stewart, of King street, and a few other articles. Outside there is another of Clayton and Shuttle, worth's engines, and a large wind power erected by Messrs. Robinson and Co MlMiUAT.Â« It was not an unreasonable expectation that in an exhibition, one of the main objects of which was to afford evidence of the natural resources of the Australasian colonies, the department of Mineralogy would be one of the most attractive of all to the student of the future Unfortunately, the plan of the Exhibition has not permitted the grouping together of all the specimens of rocks, ores, earths, plays, etc, which the various colonies have forwarded to prove their mineral wealth , nor have we been able to gather together in one court the minerals of our own colony. The arrangement observed in the first Lon eton Exhibition has been followed here, and thus it is necessary to traverse the great hall, catalogue in hand, to obtain the evidence which the Exhibition offers of the real natural wealth of Australia That evidence is of the most satisfactory character as to the future of this great island continent Some of the colonies of the croup possess in themselves resources of the greatest importance to a manufactur- ing and self reliant community and what they lack others have to offer in abundance Gold, as we know, is freely dispersed over the eastern colonies All of the group, including New Caledonia, are able to show ores of copper of more or less value , the rarer metals and! minerals are at all represented, and if Victoria, South Australia, and West Australs are able to make but a poor display of coals and shales, their comparative or absolute poverty in this respect is amply made up by the splendid display which New South Wales discloses, and by the evidence Tosuioina produces of the extent and in portREce of her deposits of coal Iron abounds everywhere, limestone is not scarce, and if building stone is scarce and of indifferent quality in some members of the group, all of them possess clays of the best class, and of every variety Glancing round the Exhibition, the eye is instinctively attracted to the pyramid of gold in the centre of the great hall It points at once, to the distinguishing fact, that Victoria is the great gold producing colony of the Australian and) The number and productiveness of our gold-fields have hitherto presented attractions to the miner which have almost withdrawn his attention from other kindred pursuits, and the magnitude of the golden pile as compared with that shown in 1862, is a proof that since the Exhibition in that a year the mines have well maintained their producer ences It informs us that from 1851 Uli the 10th of June last, not less than J 1,7J 139 ounces of gold had been raised, equal to a sum of Â£1.26,925,370 Large as these figures are, they are not astonishing when we find in the octagon another P) round of gold, which tells us that one mine alone on Ballarat-the Band of Hope which only commenced to give gold some two or three a years ago, has up to the 6th ultimo yielded gold which was sold for Â£387, 13S Not far from the pyramid is a case of auriferous quartz, exhibited by Messrs Latham and Watson, of Hustler's Reef, Bendigo, which affords satisfactory evidence of the productiveness of the reefs of the colony, and of what they are yet likely to do m supplement of the yields from the alluvial mines It contains a series of fine specimens, from the cap downwards so far as the reef has been traced, and cakes of gold obtained from the mine of the value of Â£10,000 There is a particular interest attached to this display, from the circumstances that the theory at one time propounded, that quartz reefs were not likely to be found rich in gold in the deep ground, came upon the quartz miners at Sandhurst at a period of depression Messrs Latham and Watson, however, were not discouraged, the perse- vered, and the result of their labours has been fortunate for the firm, and a very strong encouragement to quartz miners everywhere "A cairn of specimens from the various reefs in the district around Tarnagulla, a large and magnificent specimen from Show rings Reef, St Arnaud (which gave fifty eight ounces to the ton), a splendid case from the Whip Reef, Sandhurst and a block of a strange black quartz from the Eagle Company, Specimen Hill, Eaglehawk (which gives eight ounces to the ton), supply some evidence of where the gold represented by the pipe and came from, and that the lodes are still far from being exhausted St Arnaud contributes quartz coo taming both silver and gold and the mining department exhibits a remarkably fine sample of silver from the Friburg mine, prepared by Mr Masters, assayist. St Arnaud An ore of load, containing gold and silver, comes from the Clir)6olite-hiU, in the same locality) The Mining department contributes in a series of cases a collection of all the minerals in the colony, so far as they are known If it is added a choice collection of foreign. minerals, catalogued and indexed Tor this collection the public are mainly indebted to Mr Brough Smyth, secretary of the Mining department, to whom miss a cow e the mining and mineral statistics by which they are accompanied Extremely interesting now, this collection will be very useful hereafter, furnishing, as it will do, a ready means by which too prospector can ascertain something of the unions racter of the discoveries which he may make a private collection, by Mr Sydney Gibbons, is also valuable, exhibiting every known mineral is IT antimony found in the colony, and the uses to stray be applied, we have illustrations in the correction exhibited by Messrs Clarke and Co.ne Chemical and Paint Factory, Yarra Bank if) exhibit the case of antimony as it is home M'Iver and other districts, the pure regard to which they reduce it for the marks, the white oxide of antimony, the new point of commerce now made from it in tons of lead, and the red sulphate of antimony, or vernier tion of the painter A black paint cm also be obtained from this material, but it has not as a "*' produced here While speaking of this case, were) also notice the splendid soda crystals it comes mode of the some w work A much later discovery of this colony than that of antimony has been Tat 69 ores of copper These are found on the Thomas River and a case of specimens has been continued g by Mr W Pearson, on the part of the Gipps Land Copper Company, which should assist in removing from Mr Selwyn's mind the impression he somewhat hastily formed that there is not a copper mine where they were found They were taken about a month ago from a lode eighteen feet wide Dicke are nine or ten Mrtteties - black and red oxides, blue and green carbonates, yellow and grey ores, sulphurets, and native copper Some of the samples are of good size, and the display warrants the hope that copper ore, or copper will at no distant day form a considerable portion of the exports of Victoria A few samples of tin and tin sand have come down from the Ovens Ores of iron are exhibited with some specimens of the smith's work, made of iron from native ores These, we regret to say, do not illustrate a 1 ung industry, no attempt having yet tone beyond experiment to work the numerous and rich iron or of the colony of Victorian coal, the Exhibition cc stars no sample worthy of the name i A specimen from a 3 feet 6 inches vein of coal-of the nil thuknCFB of the Benches in the Mining De- portment , but, from obvious causes, the Cape Potter tion coal-field is unrepresented here, though small and stray samples have found their way in from outcropping veins in the Cape Otway district, the value of which may hereafter be ascertained Of fire clays and pottery clays there are numerous samples, and some excellent Chesterfield were from the pottery of Mr Guthrie, of Epsom Pigment days from the Beechworth district are the only days of this class we noted in the Exhibition, and though the colours obtained from them by merely wetting them are rather coarse, it is possible that in this small exhibit there is the germ of a future native industry " Of roofing slates we have specimens almost equal in fineness to these of North Wales from Gisborne, and from the Penrhyn slate quarries, near Smeaton From the latter there are also exhibited a good specimen of tesselated pavement, a well cut chimney piece, with brown marble inlaid, Campbell's Creek also con- tributes slates of a good and useful class of building clones the Victorian display is small and inferior Magnesite is exhibited from Strangways Turning to a less useful, but very interesting feature of the Exhibition we must notice, Dr Bleasdale a fine collection of colonial gems (in which specimens of the diamond are included), the collection of Mr Turner, of Beechworth, which embraces a splendid Borklyitc (or opaque ruby), some handsome cut Cairngorm, a variety of the strange yellow hollow crystals, containing water or oil, which have been found in one or two places only in the draft overlying the granite near Beechworth and Mr Denis s Mr Berry's, and Mr Hedley a collections of Ovens jaspers and other interesting stories Beechworth alone has furnished samples of those peculiar jaspers, and the whole of the collections from that district deserve attention Giving the right of first place among our neighbours to our French friends of New Caledonia i, we were gratified to find in their collection some excellent, though peculiar, specimens of copper ore, copper in quartz, chrome iron (which may compete with that of New Zealand), hydraulic and other limestones, and building stones of good quality There is also here a good specimen of greenstone or jade-not so dark as that of New Zealand, and not to pose as a stone of the same family which has been found on Diamond Creek New South Wales has made a fine display of her large mineral resources A trophy of coal has been exhibited, showing a section of a 12ft seam, but his of 30ft thick ore being worked in the neighbouring colony Beside this trophy (in the annexe) are other sections of seams, varying from 4ft him upwards The highly bituminous character of the coal is apparent "Yv c may remark that though this coal now bears a higher character in Californian ports than British coal for steam purposes, and nell's for more men), the mines were scarcely known abroad ten years ago At that period samples of Newcastle coal were shown in Wales by coal masters there, and as everything in Australia is supposed to have opposite characteristics from the British article, it was white in colour Black swans in place of white, cherries with the stones outside, animals that topped, but did not run, it was only in keeping that the cool should be white ' They know better now in sales Noir these trophies are two of kerosene shale The shale of the Western Hartley Company now turns out 6000 gallons of oil per week, iv while the works of the Wollongong Company produce 1600 gallons per week of naptha There are also exhibits of kerosene shale from Burragorang near Picton, and from Liverpool Plains, showing that a very wide spread deposit exists of this valuable material Jet coal, not quite so good as that of Whitby, is brought from Port Macquarie The copper ores exhibited are very rich They are chiefly from the neighbourhood of Bathurst, and from the Cadiangullong Company there is silver ore from the "Moruya mine, where some rich discoveries have lately been made, the presence of mundic in the stone having previously interfered with the profitable working of the mine The iron ore (brown hematite) from the Fitzroy mines, is a fine sample , the presence of other minerals in the ore acting as a flux, and rendering limestone unnecessary for that purpose Pig iron, face castings (including a pretty toy al coat of arms), and a bell, show the uses to which the produce of the Fitzroy furnaces may be turned Fire clay, soapstone, meerschaum, sulphuret of antimony, pottery clay, silicate of magnesium, red iron ore from Brisbane Water, assist in running interest and variety to this department Having been unable to discover the locality of Queensland in the great hall, we pass on to South Australia, where we find a very splendid collection of copper ores as might be expected from a colony where copper mining has been so long and so profit ably followed These are of all kinds, and purple ore is placed amongst them, which is stated to yield sixty percent of copper There is also a sample of silver lead ore, but none of bismuth, which has lately been found there Western Australia comes out very strong in copper, some of the samples being really good There appears to be a fine field for industry in this branch of mining in that remote colony Iron ore, sever lead, pipe clay, jaspers, mudstone, gypsum, bitumen (from Nicol Bay), and a small specimen of coal are also among the exhibits Ino las maman collection as a whole is varied, though not remarkable there are gold from Fingal, topazes from Flinders Island (of which Mr Crouch, Hobart Town, shows a handsome case), black sand, serpentine light coloured -variegated marbles, and lime stones that take a fine polish Of cool and shale there are numerous specimens, but all of them small there are specimens of the iron ore so abundant in the island, and solitary specimens of copper ore and lead ore from the River Leven Fire clays are shown in great quantity, and the mill stones are a unique exhibit The New Zealand compartments are still so incomplete that we shall defer a notice of their mineral contents till another occasion We shall only add once more, that the collection taking the colonies together affords a variety which is highly satisfactory, and which must powerfully affect in the future the prosperity of the Australian group I
