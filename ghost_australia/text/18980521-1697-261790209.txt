P O E T R Y . SO LIl'TLE DONE. So muoh to do, so little done! In sleepless eye* I paw tbe son; His beaming disk in darkness lay, The dreadful ghost of Yesterday. So little done, po muob to do ! The morning .shone on harvest new, In eager light. I wrought my way, And breathed the spirit of To-day. So much to do, so little done! The toil is pisr, the rest begun; Though little done and much to do, To-morrow earth and heaven are new. â€”J. J. P'ATf.
