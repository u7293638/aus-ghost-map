The genial and kindly Critic had seen, so many changes and met so many; people during his lofig and intimate connection with the stage, that his recollections were bountiito be extensive, and ascertain to be interesting.

That manner of life still retains a certain amount of fascination for those of a later.^ time, ? when conven- , tions ^are not so strict that they need be set at defiance ostentatiously. In these, vplumes, 'which consist for the most;, part of the diaTy kept by Mr. Bianchard from day to day, the curious in = such matters will find an inex haustible amount of information — the more -valuable because it as not ' written tip,' but recorded in the words prompted by the moment. The notes added by the editors, in explanation of the references in the diary, are hardly less interesting, and are evidence of ' the careful and conscien Meras manner in which they have addressed themselves to their task. It is hardly possible to extract any one part of the diary inpreference to another, but scat tered here and there throughout the vol umes are various good stories, a few of which will serve as samples of the rest. ?n his' early days, ' E.L.B.' had a hard struggle for life, and had to resort to many shifts to earn a few shillings. On one occasion he ventured to remonstrate with a newspaper proprietor on the small ness of his salary. ' I don't dispute it, sir,' was the reply-? 'You send me a great- deal of copy for 15s a week. It is small -pay, but so regular !'? In the early ' forties '—Blanchard was born in 1820 — he was induced by a small printer and publisher in Holy well-street, ? named Bos tockj tofl write him a novel. The venture was notoinduly lucrative. On a certain Saturday Bostock entered the room m which the author was hard at wort, and with a rueful expression of .countenance, said, 'I'm going to take a great liberty, but could you lend me. a iittle money? I only want J61. My paper-merchant wanfc3 something on account, and until I pay a trifle he won't send me the ghost of a quire.' The historian of Barnwell's perfidious doings informed Mr. Bostock that he was 'stumped.' 'Have mercy on me, Mr. Blan chard*! [} You don't know the straits of mercantile men. Ton'ie at, fork in your coat to jraise a few shillings on them. Sparks will soon, close his warehouse; and if I don't work to morrb^r{we can^t get the novel out next week, and I lifeve 'no paper at all. Your things can be taken out a-little after 6, as my boy, Ezekiel, is going to bring home some money.' The author took off his, waistcoat, and then Bostock hastily re marked, 'lam ashamed to make such a request, as you are so kind and affable, but could I beg your boots, tool With an illustrated bible up stairs ' and your things I can easily get the sovereign.' ' Have you a pair of slippers ?' ' No ; but there's an old rug in the next room. Can't you rest your feet on that ? I'll have everything: out at the time I've named.' ' Well, don't spoil the ship forha'porth of tar/' laughingly exclaimed the author. 'Mind, boots, waistcoat, and coat by -a quarter past 6, as I have to get up to the Yorkshire Stingo to hear Bob Glindon and Kitby Tunsfal} sing.' Bostock went away, and some time elapsed before he again appeared. His demeanor was miperable in the extreme on re-entering the room. ' Been a long time, Mr. Bostock. How have you got on ?' ' Awful, sir ; everything seems to. go wrong. Sparks took the sovereign which I raised, but Won't send any 'paper. Ezekiel has been dis appointed, and Fm without a shilling. Is there anyone ; you know that would advance a trifle? I'll go with pleasure, I want a trifle so bad.' ' Mr. Bostock, let us have no trifling.' Go and get some money arid let me have my clothes.' ' I could if I had; 5s. Things are awful to contem plate. If .Sparks had sent the paper some of it. might have gone for work. There's a man would lend me half-a-sovereign if I paid hini back a crown Fm in his debt. He lives in Newcastle-street. As a last resource, Mr. Blanchatd, will you let me have your trousers for 4n hour? Not longer. A crown will set me free, till Ezekiel comes back from Oripplegate, where he's gone for £5. Let me have the trousers for an hour ?' ' Do you think that .1 am going to . be played with any longer ? My difficulties have always been great, but I'm not going- to fight this ridiculous situation in a state' of semi-nudity. Go otttSand get relief somehow.' : The houra rolled on, but no Bostock appeared, and; the .-end of .the matter was that Blanchard had to pass the hot night in the printer's stufly little^ffice. A. fp^r years later Blanchard and another writer, .named Smith for purposes of dis guise^ vrere employed nn a weekly paper.

'. -v- - .' . 'Suffering from the pangs of impecunioBity, he accepted this alternative. . And here he must take up the narrative, as Blanchard would not pursue the adventure any farther. . ; , ' .-On arriving1 ata low house in Westminster, they were admitted into a passage dimly lighted by an oil lamp; the lady produced the fated coin,: and gave it a spin in the air 'for luck,' but as she did so it slipped, and disappeared between the interstices of the boards! Here was another dilemma! A mjin was called, who promptly wrenched up the floor, arid the coin was discovered, amidst the -dust. He was then dispatched with it to the nearest 'public 'to purchasea gallon of beer. ? , ...... _ s ..-.,_ . In a short time this individual returned full of strange oaths, and with the information that the supposed half-sovereign was a bad sixpence; and such was the indignation aroused that Smith was glad to escape with a whole skin. -. Although he w^as invariably. '.hard up' in those days, Blanchard was' never back ward in acts of hospitality and charity. Occasionally his generosity was allowed to be its own reward. .. . '?'- KIi.Bi vseSL **b: %&&\- wi^-'^^ieSt^i^lsb^^it' .story of an American, to whom he acted the hospitable cicerone througliout one day, en gaging a cab to drive about in and show him as much of London as could be seen in the time, lunching ' and refreshing him entirely at E:ll.B/s expense. The Ameri can had to return to Southampton v that, night, and so they. had to cross Waterloo Bridge, which was not then free. E.L.B. put his hand in his pocket for the toll, when the American stopped him, saying, 'No, sir, allow me; yon have been bearing the costs all day, if s my turn now/' and magnanimously paid the Id. \- His own money troubles, and the make shifts they involved, appear to have made him alive to the use of similar expedients by others : , : . ? At one period, during E.L.B/s residence at Eoshervile, he derived much amusement from a contemplation of the shifts used to carry on a neighboring hotel, which was financially em barrassed. This establishment had been started as a rival to the glories of Trafalgar and other well-known whitebait hostelries at Greenwich; but its antici pations were not realised; it had to fall back on tea and shrimps for the multitude, and even then its career was not prosperous. Occasionally a traveller of the- better class would stop and inquire what he could have for dinner, and would be answered — as if the resources of the cuisine were on the most lavish scale — that lie could have everything in season. When he had «rdered his repast, a timepiece, which was one of the few articles of any value which remained, was dis patched to a neighboring pawnbroker's, and out of the proceeds of its hypothecation the comesti bles were purchased, the timepiece being ultimately redeemed when the bill was paid. Despite the Hard struggle to make both ends meet, Blanchard was always cheerful and in good humor, and equal to saying a good thing. The following is an excellent specimen of the old-fashioned pun, now so wofully out of date : «.. % The coffee-room of the Tankard was frequented, by a number of theatrical celebrities, and at one time they used to hold a mutual admiration society, as a skit upon those then in vogue on the north side of the Thames. . Each member on his birthday was presented with a pen-and-ink sketch of himself, drawn by Alfred Crowquill (Forrester), one of the members. On one occasion an old actor named Dale was the recipient, and the por nait, accordntg~ ~td~ custom, was' placed on fhe mantelpiece early in the evening. Blanchard happened to come in, but found none of the regular society were present. There was a sttanger, however, who. made some observations about the exhibition of the portrait, and said it was very odd. Blanchard said,' 'Not at all; surely it is not unusual to find a mug of old ale in a tavern.' The volumes have, however, a more serious interest than that attaching to the many good stories, they contain. The diary and the notes together form an ex haustive record of the stage for the period covered by Mr. Blanchard' s active career, and have a value of their own for pur poses of reference. As Mr. Scbtt remarks in the preface, the diary ' bridges over the blank period of unwritten history between Macready and Henry Irving.' The book is, therefore, something more even than the story of a long life well spent in hard -work and kindly, deeds.
