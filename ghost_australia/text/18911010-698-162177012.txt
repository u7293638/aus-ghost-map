Sailing Notes. ? The first race of the Sydney Flying Squadron Yacht fl Club was sailed on Monday afternoon, for prizes of £5, H £2, and £1, being first, second, aud third respectively. ? The course, a triangular one, was from a flying start ? from a boat moored off Clark Island, round a fiagboat fl off Taylor Bay, thence round Shark Island and back 9 to fiagboat off Clark Island, three times round, a ? distance of about nine miles. The craft entered, I with their handicaps, were as follows :?— Kanna- ? nook, 26ft., Lottie, 24ft., and Regina, 24ft., scratch; ? Our Tom. 24ft. 2 minutes : Ghost. 24ft.. 3 minutes ? I aud Violet, 24ft, 3| minutes. The Foy system of ^M starting was adopted for this event, which is that the ^H limit boats are despatched first, and the others as ^H their time expire. With this club it is expected that ^M the competing craft shall carry coloured sails, but at ^| present they have not been obtained, with the excep- ^M tion of the Kannanook, which carried the orthodox ^| colours, and looked very well. With the exception ^M of Our Tom and Ghost, the others entered ^H came to the scratch. The boats finished as ^H follows:— Lottie at 4h. 31m., Regina at 4h. ^M 31m. 30s., and Violet at 4h. 32m. Thus the ^M prizes have been won as above, and the boats were ^M sailed by Messrs. C. P. M'Conville, G. Parrett, and B G. Holmes, jun., respectively. ^M A meeting of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron was held on Wednesday afternoon in Aaron's Exchange- buildings. Commodore A. G.

It is expected that the club 1 will open its season on Saturday next, October 10. j The first race of the Johnstone's Bay Sailing Club 1 for ihe season was sailed last Saturday afternoon. The j first prize is a trophy presented by Mrs. Mundy, the j club adding a second and third for those positions. The boats entered, with their handicaps, were as I f ollows :— Mantura, 24ft. (C. Webb), Lottie, 24ft. (C. P. M'Conville), Volunteer, 24ft. (J. Robinson), all scratch ; Carlotta, 2-if t. (J. Monk), 2 minutes ; Esmeralda, 22ft, (W. Mitchell), Violet, 22ft. (G. Fletcher, jun.), Portia, 22ft. (T. Leach), each 4 minutes; Victor, 20ft. (G. Fletcher), 5 minutes; Cynthia, 20ft. (A. E, Blair), Grace Darling, 20ft. (D. Hanson), each 10 minutes ; and Bettina, 20ft. (W. Wilthrew), 12 minutes. The course was from Johnstone's Bay, down round Shark Island (outside beacon and buoy), back round the starter's boat in Johnstone's Bay, thence round Fort Denison, and back to fiagboat. All the boats entered came to the scratch, carrying topsails, the wind at the time being very light from about N.N.W., with the tide commencing to flow. The Btarter (Mr. F. Donovan) effected a very good start, the various craft being well together as they crossed the line in the following order, viz. :— -Grace Darling, Esmeralde, Mantura, Lottie, Carlotta, Victor, volunteer, Cynthia, Bettina, Portia, and Violet. The latter, passing the boat on the wrong side, had to return and recross the line, thus spoiling a very good chance of a place. After a good race the flag-boat was passed by the Mantura at 5h. 18m. 59*., Lottie 5h. 23m. 7s., Volunteer, 5h. 24m. 26s.t Violet 5h. 29m. 16s., Esmeralda 5h. 29m. 34s., Grace Darling 5h. 31m. 40s., Bettina 5h. 36m. 7s. ; thus the Mantura takes the first prize, beating the Grace Darling by 2 minutes 41 seconds ; the hitter on time allowance beats the Lottie by 1 minute 27 seconds, and secures the second prize, Lottie getting third prize. The steamer Ivy followed the race (in charge of Mr. W. Garden), and was fairly well patronised. The opening race of the season in connection with this club took place List Saturday for a trophy (presented by Alderman S. Daniels) as first prize, a trophy (given by Mr. A. Birks) as second prize, aud a third prize of £1, when the following boats com peted : — Marvel (E. Longfield), scratch ; Gladys (F. Thomas), 1 minute ; Alure (J. Duncan), Isabel (W. D. Stephen), and Jack (C. Swinbourne), 6 minutes each ; Echo (W. Crouch) and Pacific (W. Goldsmith), 7 minutes each ; Young Fred. (C. Landenberger), 8 minutes ; Honeydew (S. Bagnall) and Chance (J. Timbery), 9 minutes each. The Vera, Flirt, and Ionic entered, but did not start. The wind was very light from N.E., and as the handicaps were given at the start, the limit boats were the first to be sent away, Honeydew being first across the line, Chance close behind her. Young Fred, of the next minute class, got away very nicely. Pacific followed a minute later, but her class com panion, Echo, did not get across the line till very late ; in fact, the six-minute boats, Alure, Jack, and Isabel, had got underway in the order named before she had crossed the line. The one-minute boat Gladys got away very well, as also did the scratch boat Marvel. The usual Botany course was sailed, Somethingwent wrong with Isabel's gear and aha retired. With a half gale behind them fast work was shown in the run back to the Botany wharf, Gladys finishing first at 5h. 16m. 0s. ; Marvel, 5h. 16m. 35s., others not timed in the order of — Alure, Young Fred, Honeydew, Pacific, Echo. Gladys, well sailed by Jack Grant, had a popular win ; Marvel, handled by Tom Colebrook, second ; and Alure, by Billy Duncan, third. A large number of ladies and gentlemen watched the race from the steamer Mermaid, which followed, in charge of the hon. secretary of the club, Mr. Ball. Mr. P. Clarke officiated as starter, and Mr. J. Sparkes as umpire. Jake Ikenstein : ' Bepeccs, on mein knees I im blorea you to be mein vife.' Rebecca Lowenkrantz : * ( Shake, git oop !
