CORRESPONDENCE. " Spondee" will see from the published corre spondenee that the objections are not based upon the-grounds he appears to suppose. Enquirer.—The only intelligible answer we can give to this question is the following:— £19 19s. llfd. x £a9 19s. ll|d. = 368601601 square farthings = 399-958334 square pounds sterling..

This method is founded on the well known theorem that the square of the difference of two quantities is equal to the sum of their squares, less twice their product,
