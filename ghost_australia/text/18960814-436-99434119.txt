SANDY GREEK. (FEOM OTJB OWN CORRESPONDENT.) It is reported, on good authority, that the re tiring Bhire councillor for tho Kiewa riding is not to have a walk-over at the coming election. His conduct re the exchange of reads at Huon lane ha? given great dissatisfaction to a number of the ratepayers. This subject has been a burning one for the past 10 years or thereabouts, to be trotted out at every election time and dis cussed for the edification of the voters and then shelved. It is not much over a year since the whole of the councillors visited the place and in Bpected and approved of a line of road through Mr. Beatty's property. The councillors repre senting the Kiewa riding were there, and as the; were all at last of the same mind it was supposed by their long-suffering constituents at Sandy Creek that at last the end of this vexed question waB near. Poor deluded Sandy Oreekers j Another election draws near aud what do we see ? The man who they fondly hoped would help them out of their difficulties suddenly dis covers that the road he helped to select will not do at any price. There is another route far better. It may be half-a-mile longer ; no doubt there will be two extra claims for compensation, which, with the additional fencing, will add a hundred or two to the cost ; but what does the cost signify? He has chosen this new route out of his own wise head, and strong in his position, and the wisest of the trio, he thinks he is quite man enough to keep his seat at the council, and mould the other eight councillors to his will. It is reported that those ratepayers who are dis satisfied have found a man courageous enough to represent their views, and oppose Mr. Mad dock at the coming election ; but it is said with emphasis by ' the supporters of the retiring member that Mr. Walker, the opposition cham pion, will not have the ghost of a show.
