MADCAP VIOLET.* BY WILLIAM BLACK.' A.UTHUB w A Prince** o?Tuulb,- T;iaaa FKATUE03. 3CC, &C.; : ' CHAl'Iflt XXI. — ' RAt.V, WlNH, ANI- Sl'EEI'.'— (COKTiat'KD). That luncheon was rathera deaporate, business r—ps Miss Violet had predicted on her round' of inspection. They were beating up the Sound, with aahortBtarboard tack and a long larboard tack ;. and as thclattor offered moro' continued quiat,- while tho vessel did not heel over quite so much, it was resolved that the should drop iolow a3 soon as the Sea-Pyot had her larboard taok aboard. Mr. Miller would remain on deck. - Ho wa3: not hungry. And very soon ho heard, through tho skylight ot the saloon, amazing shouts o£ despair and 3hriek9 of laughter^ wiih now;and again an ominous jinglo of falling platea and spoons. In fnct, the sceno below was. at fust: nothing but a wild scramble ; for no sooner .had' tho plates been got out from tho.locker and spread on-.the table tliantbo? immediately began to slide down to leeward, a stately proceasida' which' Was! joined by the ham, by a cold pie. and two doc'an-j jers. Of coutsa, thoro was a wild 'clutching at' thie objbet and that, 'all being secured oxcept the cruet-stand, wbich bad outstripped .it3 companions in tho race, and flung itsolf he'adiong, mustard,; vinegar, and all, iuto Mr. Drutrimond's lap, who wo3 not proparod 'for the 'charge, for he was cliuging oh to tho broad-plate. When he had re tired to chango hia clothes, and como back again to resume his plaeo, order had been restored by a skilful arrangement of objects, and luncheon wa3 allowed to proceed. ? ' Alas ! tho time lost could not bo recovered aud just as thoy were beginning lo consider that lifo on board a yacht had its compensations, thero was an ominous call above, ' Roady about !' Tho yacht fleemed to right herself ; tho tablo became straight. 'Thoy ara putting her about,' observed Violet, who had picked up some slight knowlodgo of sailing in her travels. But sho failed to rocollect' that tho ingenious arrangement of objects on ' the table ' had been successful with one sido of the table up ; now that sido wont down, and there was another wild stampedo on tho part of knives, bottles, dishes, and Ioavos. Nay, that was not tho worst. In the midst of theso things — with Mrs. Warrener uttering aharp cries of warning— an awful sound was heard in one of tho adjoining state-rooms. Mr. Drammond looked grave; 'You'd better go and see what it is, James,' his siator said, keeping firm hold of ' the pie until it should bo buttressed up. Ho wont and came back with a serious face. 'My gun-case,' he observed, calmly, 'has fallen on tho ewer ; tho ov/or lm boon pitched against my bod ; tho bed is swimming with water; and the ewer is broken.' ?-' Oh, James,' his sister said, 'didn't I tell you to put that groat heavy thing on the floor, or in the bed itself, and not on a shelf ?' ' Do you think,' said he, 'there would be muchchanceofgetting theblankotsdriedondeck ?' The question was not, so foolish as it looked, for when they went abevo again, thoy found that the rain had entirly ceased, the rain-clouds were withdrawing up tho hills, and. the great lonely mountains of Mull and. Morven wero being slowly revealed. What a desolate coast it looked in this sombre grey light I Tho dark and leaden sea broke in white along the gloomy rocks ; gaunt grey precipices hore and there led up to a silent wilderness of heather ; and across tho bare slopes of the hills the whito mists moved like great troops of ghosts— armies that met and parted, that mot aud mingled together in a silent'strife —oboyieg tho mysterious behests of the' spirits of the winds. Aud by-and-by a curious and ?' suffused light bagan to declare itself behind these moving veils of mist ; higher slopes of f he nioun- ; tains, hitherto unseen, became visible- in agbdutly j nshion ; the glow;6f light 'iucroased ; and then, j Ja3 the clouds parted arid passed ron,' the bright warm sunshine sprang down in thsir wake, and1 tho mighty hills shone in resplen lent greens and yollows. Tho decks of the Saa-Pyot soon dried up, waterproofs were thrown aside, and niw tho rolling waves bal dashes of blue in them, where they caught the color of tho opening sky. 'That is the way with this coast,' observed Mr. Drummond, who had lit his pipe, and con tentedly stretched out Im legs on tho white deck, ' the weather changes every thirty minutes, and thoBcenery overy thirty seconds. Miller, why don't you go below arid got something to oat?1' 'Thank you. By-and-by,' . wns the answer. ' Shall I go down and gel some things out for you ?' V-iolot suggO3ted. This was a kind offor, for the young la'ly had been, entrusted with the tiller — under the .'.super intendence of Captain Jimmy, who stoo J hard by —and she wast amusing hord'elf with various ? small experiments as to how near the wind the Sea-Pyot could sail. ? ' Oh, no ; don't you trouble,' he answered, ' Hero, Captain Jimmy,;the rape,'- she said. 'My arms can't hold out any longer. Come along, Mr. Miller : Duucan and I will get you something.' . , . , He could not very well re£u30 so : friendly a proposal ; and so at last he got up, threw off his waterproof, and followed her down the twisting companion-stairs, A small ''boll' summoned Dnncaninto the saloon. And now. Mr. Miller found himsolf tho object of those very attentions which, since his arrival in the Highlands, he had observed Violot pay to Mr. Drummond. She played the-pavt of handmaiden to perfection, and he could not do otherwise than appear grateful to her. And yet ho was dimly conscious that her manner towards him was not that ; she displayed towards Mr. Drummond. She was .solicitous about -his comfort, it is . true ;. but it was with ' a friendly half-' patronising solicitude such as an old campaigner, if bent oh kindness, might show to au inex perienced young person encountered by chance. - It wa3 in a very differout way that she treated. Mr. Drumiuond. With him sho was all meekneeB and aubiuisaioa ; she was .content to remain a silent listener so long a3 he pleased- to speak; suoh Iittlosor7ice3 as she could render him were all done in an underhand, unobtrusive ? manner, - a3 if she would rallier'not huvo them noticed. .; : ' Don't you wait down hero, Violet,' siid he. 'I am sure you would rather be up on deck.' 'Oh, no,' sho said, carelessly.; 'I have con-, atituted my3elf ? chiof cook and: steward on! boar.l, for I don't think Duncan is. up to much,; ami 1 musi see ever.yoojy piopeny ieu; as soon, as you ha70 finished, I- want the table. I mean; to surprise Mr. iDruinmand with an apricot-jum: pudding at -dinner; you .will' sae hi* look of wonder when that appears.'. ? ? : ' I should have thought so profound a philo-; sopher would not have cared for such trifles,' re-l marked Mr. Miller. : -????'.. ?

'It thoro is anybody in the vvorltl that puts littie store by e&ting; aud. drinking and such things* it is Mr. Drunimomi. Ho is not ono of tho men who live only to get good uinnova xaA a lot of mouay. He is tho most iu;n?orldl/ and un- | -flolGBh-man'I '?;-vocvl!i-s'oenor.lieaul-of.' Thoro was a little extra color in her'fac'o. Tho young man who was busy with tho cold pie did not answor— porhaps he was. afraid of saying all ho thought just at that momont. Violot rang the boll. ' Duncan, as soon as Lit. Millor has finished, will you clear tho tablo, please ? And get me tho flour and things, and an empty bottle if yovt haven't a roller. When will the mon havo their dinner ?' Duncan paused for a minute ; his English wa£ not fluent. 'I think, mom, whan we will got into Loch Sunart.' ' , ' Then I will mako a pudding for them, too ; and you can have that first, for we Bhan't want dinner till seven.' ' ' Very well, mem.' ' Would you kindly ring tho boll when you' have finished V sho asked, somewhat coldly, of Mr. llillor ; and then she turned and loft tha saloon, and went on deck. By thistime they had got well past Loch Salon, and right ahead of them lay the open Atlantic, ? with Tobormory lighthouse on their left, and oa their right the gaunt precipices of Ardnamurchan Point running out to the ocean. ' The saa waa wearing round to the west ; and a warmer light lay over the vast panorama of mountains; shoros, and sea. The wind had gone down a bit, too ; and Captain Jimmy was looking forward to the timo when, having got up to the mouth of Loch Sunart, ho should bo able to altor the course of tha Sea-Pyot and let hor run in before the wind to her anchorage for tho night. Mrs. Warroner linked her band within Violet's arm, and led her forward a bit, apparently tha better to command a view of tho opon sea. ' Violet, what have you been doing to Mr. Miller?' 'Nothing,' the girl answered. ' There is something the matter with him : you seo that.' 'Yes, I do, 'she replied, and then she said, . with proud indifference, 'I have done nothing to offend him that I know of. If ho chooses to mako himself unpleasant, how cau I help it ? Look at him now — reading a book and taking no notice of all this wonderful place. Wo may look forward to a delightful trip if he keeps on in that way.' ' Violet,' said Mr3. Warrener, gently, ' you ought not to speak of him like that ; you oi'ghfc to make excuses for him.' . :?? .' Why should I, auy more than anyone olso ? I wish to bo as friendly with him as with any one; but when I see him making this return for your brother's kindness in asking him to go with ' Ob, James doesn't mind. Probably ho doesn't seo it.' ' I wi3h I could believe he was sea-sick,' said Violet, rather cruelly. ' But it isn't that, for he has been smoking cigars all day. People say that on board a ship is a dreadful piaco for making people quarrel ; but wo haven't becu on board here long enough, .suiely. There u ouo thing, however, certain enough. A ship is a bad place to bottle up inflainmablo matoriuls in. If ho imagines himself wronged or hurt in any way, there will be an explosion— and that before long.' Sho was right in lhat conjecture, as events were soon to prove ; but in the meantime could anything bo more peaceful and peace-suggesting thau tho scenes through which the Sea-Pyot waa now gently .bearing them ? Thoy had turned aside from tho broad waters of the Sound, and wore now running bcfoio a light breeze into a long and winding loch (.hut lay between hills and mountains of singular beauty of form and color. Tho solemn evening li}',Ut, touching the higher peaks, seemed to add to the silence and foneli'riO3B of the shadows below, whore tho grey boron stood motionless under the binok rocki, and here aad there tho dark head of a seal appeared '.iu (ha smooth waters of the succeeding bays. ? It waa without a sound that tha Sea-Pyot glided past tho successive headlands; but- her arrival was' an nounced from timo to timo by the far call of tho ? cuilew, startling the silence of tho place, aud awaking answering cries from other sea-birdj along the coast. At length they sailed in to a solitary little bay, whero the water was almost without a ripple, and here the. impressive blili ness that reigned around was suddenly broken by the loud, harsh rattle of tbo chain, cubic as; the anchor plunged. The curlews whjstled their warning-note a3 they iled along the shoro ; tho sea-pyots screamed shrilly as they :- flow away across thelocb, skimming the water -in their flight; a single heron, uttering a low, harsh croak, heavily lifted his long wings, and disappeared in the gathering twilight. Then all was peace again; arid the darkness came gently ovor the mountains, and over the still bosom of the lake, until one could scarcely make out the shore. If the prosaic details of yachting had beon pro niinent during the day, they were no longer. so io the mystic silence of the night as the starj came out orev the hills, and the ripple against the s:dd of the vessel broke in a million sparks of °phos phoresceut fire.' Then ths njoon avo3e ; and tho shore and the hills h2?.xu to appear again in th'o growing light ; until another world stood revealed, cold and silont, and still. The rod glow of thb .cabin skylight wa3 tUo only yoiat of intense color ?in' all this, palo pivlure ; evon as in the yacht itself, where peuci and silence seemod to prevail, there was but one fierce ond hidden .firo — in a man's heait. - ?? : Chapter XXII.— The Magic MunOANSEa. ? At this point, and in common courtesy to lib readers, the writer of these pages conEidors hull* self bound to give fair warning that- tho folio Wiog chapter deals solely aud wholly witli tho'sh'bofcing of niorgausora, curlow3, heronsj -aitid-flUCu '??lite ifearlul wild ': fowl ; therefore-' tUoae ?'? who ' regard ? .such graceless idling ' with ' aVoriiou, ' Had ; '&& .'anxious to got on^with' tlie story,: Uhorild- at 'bnc\\- ' 'proceed to chapter twenty-three.' There' iis:'ix\i just reason, one might urge, why fictiotT slioald speak only of those days in a man's lifo in which something supremely good or supremely bad hap pened to him— jumping over the far greater num bw of daya ia wJiicU nothing particular happened to him— and thoreby lecorcling the story of hia life in ft jorky, staccato, impossiblo mannor. De3tiny is not for ever tnarchiug on witUmajeatic stride ;.ovon tho horrid Furies sometimes prit a iv ay tlieii ?? whips' ;' fitvo a utaa « gun, pfac.0 hifti on a HigLland loch on a etill day iu August, show julm a few dark specks swimming round tho dis tant promontories, and he will forgot that thero la oven hucIi a thing as to-morrow. To write out tho wholo story oE his life in tlr.;s fashion would, of couro, bo impossible ; for il would be twenty times as long as the longest Japanese drama in existence ; while tho death-rate among tho readers— say twonty-fonr in a thousand per an num — would interfere with the continued attcn ? tion demanded by tho author. But occasionally, in the briofo3t story, one of those idlo and tin momorable days ought to come in, just to show that the pooplo are not always brooding over tho plan o£ their lives. Anyhow, and this is tho long and the short of it— three out of fivo of tho pas sengers on board tho Sea-Pyot aro going in pur suit of morgansors, and the gentle reader is en troated to grant them this one holiday, which will be tho last of its kind. What olsc, indeed, could they do ? Thero was no v/ind to take them out of the beantif ul little Lay in which they were anchored. When Violet came up and saw how still and clear the water was— small fish, 'cuddies,' could be aeon at a wonderful depth — she immediately darted down ; again and brought up with her ono of the bottles out of tho cruot-stand. 'Did you ever see the most beautiful thing in tho world ?' she called out. When they confessed they had not, she emptied, regardless of expense, the contents of the mustard-pat into the sea, close by the side of the vessel, and immediately tho great shining depths beneath, them, were filled with particles of glitter ing gold, the sun gleaming on them as they slowly sank, and causing the sea to look as if it were bo inu^h Goldcnes-wasser from Dantzig. '^That ia a protty trick, Mis3 Violet,' re marked a tall gentleman standing there. ' Per Laps you will kindly fill that bottle again ?' ' Oh, yes, certainly,' remarked the young lady, with much coolness, as she went below. 'Now, Jimmy,' continued Mr. Drummond, turning to the skipper with whom he had been talking, 'you don't really mean to say that a seal flung stones at you — Come now — I will make every allowance for winter-time — and idleness — and the necessity of stories— but you know, Jimmy, that is a little too much——' 'I declare to yon, sir,' said the yellow bearded, brown-complexioned man, with some highland vehemence, 'it is as true as you. aro standing tlioro. Is it stones? Tain him, ho ' nearly felled my head off wi stone3 as big as your band, and bigger. For I was iu a boat when I ? shot at Liru ; and I sah he couldna get down to lie watter ; and I knew that I bad struck him. And when I got on the shore to run up to him, tarn him, ho began to fling the stones at my head, and he did not fling them as a man would' fling them, but backwards, with his head turned away from you, ami you should hef seen how he will catch the stones up with his fins, or his hands, or whatever it is. And there was no use waiting, sir, so I will run up to him as hard as I could, and I will fall on him then, and catch him round tlie head, and it wa3 no more stones he will fliug after! had the grip of him. See ! sir, seo !— there is one now — going into the weeds ? ' . About sixty yards off, making in for the shore, they could descry a round brown object, moving from side- to side. Young Miller, who had his gun in hid hand, instantly put it up to his shoulder; Drummond as quickly caught tho barrels and turned them aside. 'By the ashes of my grandfathor there shall not ba a shot fired at a seal while we are in these 'waters. What 13 the use? If you wound him he dive3 ; i£ you kill him, he sinks ; and if you' got him, what would you do with him? The skin 13 worth nothing. Then he is the most harmless . and gentle creature ? ' 'Especially when he throws stones at you.' ?' WoulJn't you throw stones, or anything else, at any one who had peppered you witli a charge ?of duck-8v'0i; ?'. . \- i'Tuen what are we to shoot when wp go out to-3ay?' inquired tho young man, with some re., sontment. ' You have got up a regular liBt cow of things that must not bo touched. If they only \- knew the birds and beasts might come on board here as a sort of sanctuary ? ' ' Well, I will tell you what wo must 'shoot. Firat of a!!, that abominable wretch, the curlew, for he is a screaming tell-tale, and he is likewise very gooil to eat. Then I believe thoso gentle creatures below are rather anxious to have some beron'd feathers ; you may shoot a heron or two when you got the chance— only they don't tu a rulo come and perch on the point of your barrels. But above all we must slay duck— wild- duck— the bird that looks inelegant in tho air, but beautiful on the table— him we must snizo by fair moans or foul, ehe we shall have nothing to break the monotony of mutton for days and days to come, and we may even run ehort of mutton, if we come to a place where the poswnaswr uamt been killing lately. Threo or four miles from here, up one of the side lochs, Jimmy saya the placo swarms with duck, and there will ba souia that aro flappers, I grieve to think oE destroying these young things beforo they have grown tired of the world ; but Jimmy eaya they are exceedingly good to eat. Of course, K these duck had any sonse, they would give up1 eating grass and fresh-water weeds, and take to aaa-weed, and syrup, and young jolly- fish, and so on, until they grew as fishy a3 a fine, old, rich flavored solan. Then people would let them alone.' 'But this in salt water wo have here. 'Yea.'',, ' Aud it ia salt water in tho loch we are going Op.' ?::- 'Certainly.1'.., 'TUen what are tho wild-duck doing here if .theyliye.,on fresh-water wcQtls,?'1 .. ?:.-.., ? .. 'I don't know. How can I toil ? I am informed ..Jshatiwild-ilucjc abound hero, ia great, numbora.; ;I have sean bird3 resembling -duct swimming in ,tue-;loch;I have, asked jf they, were widgeon —jao,; they are not widgeon : that is all I know.' ' Porhap? they come down from tho mountain streams to have a Bwim in the lsch.' .' Perhaps they do, Wo will shoot thorn, and ftsk tlseni for art explanation.' ^Itwas about ten o'clock that forenoen that the: Pi? w**. lowerO(1 and two stalwart young follows got in to' hand down the guns, cfirtridgc-biga, ' Inncbaon-liwkot, &c.; Just ;(3 Mr. Qootga Miller had taken his station at the! bow, tho raon on tho thwarts, and Mr. Diumniond at tho atom, as they wero about to bid ' Good-bye' to those left on board the yacht, it suddenly occurrod to Miss Violet that sho would liko very much to join this shooting expedition. Sho pleaded earnestly. Mr. Miller oped his oye3 wide, and eaid sho had hotter do nothing of tho sort. Mr. Drummond, looking up from his seat in the storn, said— ' Are you willing to have your ears dinned?' 'Quito.' 'Are you afraid of being shot?' ' Not if I sit near you : if I was 3ix yards off I should bo.' This insult wa3 too much. 'Give way, lads, give way,' ho called out. 'No ! Don't ! Wait a minute !' sho called out also ; and tho men stopped. ' Please, Mr. Drummond, let me go with you, and I shall bo most respectful to you tho whole time. You want somebody to bring back the story. You could not, your two selves, begin to tell all tho wonderful thing3 you did, Please let mo go !' 'Como along, then,' and he roso and handed her down into the boat, where she took hor seat beside him. Ia another minute er two the gig was well away from the yacht, making for a narrow channel in tho loch between some small islands in the* mainland. 'Now,' said he to his companion, 'you must preserve strict silence.' ' Very well,' she said obediently. Having placed this injunction on her, ho proceeded to descant on the quiok hearing and long sight of birds, on the cunning of savages in cctyturing wild animals, on the instinctive yearn ing in civilised life for a brief return to the freedom, physicial toil, aud excitomont enjoyed by the savage in his pursuit of game, and bo forth, and so forth. She remained absolutely silent : but thero was a demure smile about her. Iip3. It was not until he was proceeding to ox pound to her that the radical vice of the English political character was its contempt for parochial affaire — that every boy fresh from tho University was prepared to reform tho constitution, bnt would not stoop to learn anything of the local raising and application of taxes, and so forth, that she vontured to say— 'Do I speak nioie loudly than you ? How is it you have no fear of frightening away the birds?' . Just at this minute they were startled' by a loud whirring o£ wings and a shrill whistle ; and a large grey object was seen to fla3b along the. front of the rocks ahead of them. Bang ! bang ! went two barrels at the bow — the bird flew . on and disappeared. But now on all sides in this seemingly silent and deserted place a wild confusion arose. Half-a-dozen oyster-catchers flew out from the shore— their red bills and Iog3 shining in the sun — and made away up tho loch ; everywhere there was a calling of curlews ; a flock of sand-pipers rose and twisted about in the air exactly like snipe ,- two or three herons, with slowly-flapping' wings, and legs han'incr down, disappeared over the nearest pro montory. -. ?? ? 'Wbydidn'tyou shoot that curlew?' Drummond called out. The answer showed that the young man at the bow had been, nursing a silent rago all this time. '?.-(. ' I .should like to know how we are likely to shoot anything; bo long as you go on talking like that,' he said, sharply. 'And I knew how it would be.' - ' Why,' Drummond called out, good-naturedly, ' the bird wasn't thirty yards off when he roso ; you won't get such another chance at a curlew if you wait here twenty years.' ''? Well I think we may aB well go back to tho yacht.1' ' I don't think you can swim as far, can you? Nevermind, Miller, wo must keep quiet now. You needn't pull, lads : the current will carry us through those channels. Millor, keep a good look-out.' Thero was now no more about the instinct ot savages or the taxation of Camberwoll ; for the rising tide, producing, a strong current running up ths loch,' was carrying the cutter silently through certain' twisting channels between tho islands and the. shore. The shore was at this point both rocky and wooded— young ash and birch coming Sown in many places close to tho water ; whilo round the islands the tide was still low enough to display a broad fringe of brown sea-weed. There was therefore every chance of finding plenty of wild fowl about. Silently and stealthily thoy stole by tho successive promontories, sometimes catching a glimpse of a heron heavily flying away far ahead of them, and again Ibteniug to the distant call of the curlew. Suddenly Miss Violet touched her companion's arm. A heron had come right over head — flying from the shore it had discovered its mistake too late to turn right back— and was now making for the islands. -Miss Violet put her hands to her ears ,* but she still looked up. The next second her hoad was violently shaken by the report of the gun ; and a huge confused mas3 of feathers came tumbling down into the sea, some five-and- twenty yards off. When they rowed back for it against the curront, and hauled it on board, they found it was a very large heron, about three feet and a half from bill to claw, and in very fanr plumage. But they had scarcely got tho heron into the boat when their attention was called to a flock of birds that had risen from tho shores of an island near, and were twisting this way and that in the air, the flock showing white one minute and groy tho next. 'Surely they're snipe?' called out Miller; and ono of the ea.ilor.i- who seemed to . havo as much interest as any one in what wa3 goiDg on— called out in reply— 'Ay, they're snipe,, sir ; 'see, there thoy're coming round now.' ,.?', ? The flock made one of their abrupt wheels and swept by the bow of the boatsomo forty yards oil'. Mr. Miller firod both lm barrels into the thick of them— anxious to havo tho larder of the yacht 'supplied with such, goodly proy— and as the birds sheered off to the loft, Mr. Drummond sont a parting shot; aflor Iheni. Three fell. ' Only three after all that noise ?' callod out a young lady who had promiuod silence. But what was thoir disgust on -pulling up to the birds, .and hauling thorn in, to find that in; placo of tho covoled fl.nino.they werp only poor little saadpipors, wbews fatal resemblanoe to the mipo in their length of bill and manner of flying bad brought on them this destruction. The dis appointment of the shooters, however, was ns nothing to tho pity expressed by their gentle companion, who regarded herself as an accessory to this slaughtor of the innocents. ' You can eat sandpipers,' remonstrated Mr. Millor. ' You can eat thrushes and nightingales,' was tbo rotort, 'and who wants to do. that?'
