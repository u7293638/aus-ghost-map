SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALISM. THE Times has recently had a cot troversy on Science and Spiritualism As very little now could be said on the question, pretty much the same statements have been made, and facts, if facts they can be called, have crops d up, which have appeared in controversies out a sume sub 2 feet in our pages there also appear, 1 those parade without s, who is said t> bolero in spiritual) was have been pur- in it again and again - this is ten thousand times as many authors I would not be printed if necessary, against it lhiiii|,li 'ho control raw, in fact has been br m on results wo william reproduce from t i lane the following summary and comment to Main r usual i i for P wo four, will think we owe theiUBoiuo apology for opening our columns to a controversy on such a subject 113 spiritualism, and thus treating as an open or debatable question w but should rather be dismissed at once as all her an imposture or a delusion But even 1 impoMuro may call for unmasking, and popular delusions, however absurd, are often too in portant to be neglected by the wiser portion of mankind It is, we suppose, on those grounds we are told that " turn of science," instead of treating spiritualism with dension 01 contempt, ought to study UB phenomena with impartial attention, and prepare themselves either to expose deceit or to acknowledge foot On the other side, however, it is reasonably argued that before scientific men can he expected to im costs gate alleged phenomena, it must be shown that such phenomenal are real enough and extraordinary enough to deserve enquiry Thus, in fact, has arisen the question of " Spiritualism I Science," author which heading we have allowed correspondents of all shades of belief, or his belief, to relate their ex per lease or state their views Is there realty any case for scientific investigation in this matter p Would it have been allowable, for instance, to ask Professor Faraday to come and \ verify himself the ultra fastidious of Spiritualism, or would it have been an insult to unto him to any such absurdity p le there, in reality, anything, the lawyers would say, to go to a jury with? Well, on the other hand, we abundance of alleged experience which can hardly be called evidence, Find a few dispositions of a more notable and impressive character On the other hand, we have many accounts of convicted impostor, and many authentic reports of precisely such disappoint month or discoveries us we should be led to expect What, however, is spiritualism ? Wo oak that important question with little hope of getting a conclusive answer, for our i eudora will have soon during the last few days how very various are the impressions of spiritualists themselves Originally, no doubt, as the name itself implies, spiritualism meet a certain dealing through some my sterious agencies, with the spirits of the ded, which were summoned to communicate with the hung lines is nothing but the old theory of ghosts and apparitions reduced to a kind of practice, by which spirits, instead of appearing at their own discretion, and closed at will by the call of others Probably the believers in spiritualism as thus defined do not include many scientific men ; but other views of the matter have been placed before us One correspondent is content to observe that he has witnessed phenomena which could not be at! nbut ed to any natural causes Another expresses his conviction that certain phctiouuiiit are a really due to the operation of a force hitherto unsuspected, but entering into the agencies of nature like any other force As this is, perhaps, the least incredible of all the hypotheses, we may tss will consider it best, especially as the render of Lord! Lytton's novels will recognise in is a familiar and almost arts no two assumption It is said, then, that the force of the human will, which can put the fingers of the hand in motion at pleasure, can occasionally and under certain circumstances be exerted hot and the limits of the body, of it with such material effect IIB to move inanimate objects to an extent, at any rate, far exceeding the mo clinical force employed A number of persons being duly gifted, and in a proper state of " celebration, ' might thus, we are told, put in motion a heavy dining table and drive it over a considerable space Now, we must avow that for our own part, we do not believe the united " wills" of all the nine hundred millions of the earth's population could over be made to move a single wineglass, but the possibility of such a force may be imagined with less outrage to reason than is involved in certain other spiritualist theories, and can easily be brought to proof Ul is no other alleged phenomenon spiritualism it is difficult to speak with even this amount of gravity They are for the most part exhibited I under conditions either plainly suggestive of imposture, or clearly consistent with delusion Stipulations for a (lad!; loom, concerted ur rangements of furniture, and a company prides posed by credulity to the reception of Empire sports are not terms likely to criminated I homeolvcB to the students of physical into The phone mona IhoniEiilies, too, are mostly incompatible with any set tons concept um or spiritual level lions, and at the same time, exactly adapted to the purposes of human operators. Blips given under the table, chairs tossed about the rooms, strange horses, and mysterious movements have been the stock features of till such stories from the days of the Got k lunn Ghost to the present time Such tricks uri easily played, and the manifestations are easily magnified by a credit lous or imaginative mind When we hear from witnesses neither imaginative nor credulous that they have really heard or seen what they could not till how to explain, we may believe them without the least belief in the truth anomaly of spiritualism Exactly the same things have been said of Indian jugglers or Egyptian magicians When again we are told that Bpintuahsm,having existed for forty years, must have a basis of truth, we can only reply that angle without (the least busts of truth existed and was fully believed in for more than ten times that period, Its theory was perfectly simple, being founded on the belief, universally prevailing, that the elements were peopled with certain spirits or Buporhuman natures, which could, by the application of certain laws, be made to port farm the bidder's will Magical art consisted in the history of those laws and the command consequently attained over the powers of the air, the earth, or the Ben. J. be observance of certain farms, the burning of certain reserves, and the utterance of certain words called the spirit or the "gone" to the presence of the performer, and it is curious to remark how elaborately the study must have been pursued The Magician of Oriental tales, before exercising his art in variably consults his " books," and sometimes spends days in the investigation. We laugh at such prctonsionB now, but they were neither ridiculous nor incredible in times when the existence of the spirits concerned was never called in question. It was everywhere believed that nature endowed with more than human faculties were among the beings of the world, and from that conviction to the conception of an art by which they might be controlled the passage was only. But this does not touch the essence of spiritualistic pretensions We are told either that spirits from the unseen world may be called to communicate with living men and women, or that a force hitherto unknown may be exerted with material effect upon inanimate bodies, and then we are asked why men of science will not apply themselves to the investigation of such claims in the controversy which has been raised in our columns due allowance has, perhaps, not been made for the conditions of the problem; but a sufficient answer to the demand for a scientific enquiry is that the proposals must come in a less ambiguous or objectionable shape. The medium must be content with any apartment offered for the purpose, with an unbelieving audience, and with conditions generally devised to prevent even the possibility of deception or misapprehension The employer of " Psychic Force " must accept similar terms, which, indeed, in his case, as there can be no " susceptibilities" involved, should be readily welcomed We have been warned not to apply the features of an exact or advanced science to di coveries pOssibly just dawning upon mankind but that advice would be fit only an ulterior stage of the enquiry We cannot be too Sceptical, too scrutinising, or too precise in ascertaining facts, though it may be otherwise when we come to explanations. Let us first be positively assured that a spirit has been evoked, or that a dining-table has been moved by a mere ' effort of volition the part of the operator. When the facts have been once established Science may be fairly called upon to consider their import.
