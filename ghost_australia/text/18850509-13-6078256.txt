RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION I -?-"?" I to him iniToit 01' mu Aiiotm. SIR-Having been reluctantly induced to read the recent brother cot Judge Williams, I did so yesterday. I have no hesitation in pronouncing it a miserable farrago of effete object ions, which have been often urged and often answered It abounds In nBBer tion and assumption, spiced with ribaldry and scurrility. To reply seriatim would be simply open 1 open an pa decree waste one's time and trouble It will do no harm to any one, except, indeed, to the man who foolishly wrote it Judge Williams accuses Dr Moorhouse of plagiarism from Matthew Arnold and Stuart Mill, while he himself takes the whole tone, tenor, and treatment of his weak mutation from Channing and Bonar, borrowing without acknowledgment his Unitarianism regarding the Trinity from the former, and his Nestoriiimam regarding the Incarnation from the latter 'Thus does he verse), in his own person, the judgment of the metaphysical visionary Paul, who in the second chapter of his epistle to the Romans declares, "Therefore thou art index cusable, O man, whosoever thou art, that judges, for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself, for thou that judges does the same thing" My principal object in writing is to correct two primary and primary errors of which the learned but archeological judge has been guilty, and on which he has raised so many false issues, thus rendering his whole at tempted argument a mere paralogism In page 2 of the new edition of his little book he laid down categorically that "the most succinct and accurate statement of it (the doctrine of the 'I rusty), as held by the Church of Home the Church of England, and other Protestant denominations, is that the Godhead consists of three distinct and separate persons, each one of whom is God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost that all three are to eternal and co equal, and that all three are one God ' Now the doctrine as thus stated is neither "succinct" nor "accurate," but redundant, false and heretical I know it not to be the doctrine of the Catholic Church, and I be have it not to be the doctrine of the Protestant Church, for I have looked over her articles and found the orthodox faith ex- plicitly taught in article, one. 'the Godhead does not consist of three distinct and separate persons," for if they were separate they would exist in three distinct substances, viz., as three human persons, and would therefore be what Judge Williams falsely asserts the Gods 'The three divine persons exist distinctly as persons in the one inseparable substance, the divine nature, which is so essentially one, union, indivisible, inseparable, that the very possibility of division or Separation would destroy the very nature of God. Such a God, if possible, would not be God at all Jehovah-lain who am The three persons are the relation of origin in the divine observe that is eternal origin, coeval and co-existent with God himself these three relations are living active, energising persons, each ever acting and ever producing its own proper operation, I which, though proper to the person, is yet common to the one divine essence of substance Thus the three persons exist distinctly, but not separator), in the one divine nature How this can be is precisely where in the mystery of the Holy Trinity consists, und wherein we, are weak and blind mortals, must pay) the homage of our understanding to the revelation of God " They who search into mysteries shall be overwhelmed with glory ' It may be possible that Judge Williams does not see or cannot understand the difference between " distinct and separate ," for, indeed, I must agree with Mr Blair that the judge is not a metaphysician. Let me, then give him a very familiar illustration in his own person, in which I hope he believes HtsovviiBonl and body exist quite distinct one from the other, and yet they are not separate would even hope that they may not be separated for a long time yet, for I hardly think he is quite ready to go to heaven An analogous fundamental and fatal mistake exists in the judge s book regarding the Incarnation In page 42 he writes that 41 material Christ or Christ In the flesh never could have been begotten and if Loans existed with Co I from everlasting,, he could only have existed as an Immaterial spirit also, and if so, it is difficult to conceive how spirit could become flesh, or Imilla verbally become materially, or the infinite become quite I am forced again to fear that the learned judge is indeed not a metaphysician, and hence his false conception of the Incarnation " Not only is it difficult to conceive how spirit could become flesh, i.e., in the judge's idea of the matter, namely, by transmutation, but it is downright impossible, for the thing itself is not only physically but even meta physically impossible bplntmoj be changed into body or extended matter only in one way, by annihilation and recreation, which is not mutation, but substitution Now, if the judge know the mere elements of philosophy he would not have found out such a maze s nest In the mystery of the Incarnation, God was not changed into man, the spirit did not be come flesh, the infinite was not changed into the finite, but God the Son, the second person of the Holy Trinity, assumed, took to himself human nature, that is a body and soul bite ours, and that while he did find must, from his very nature, continue to be God, He added human nature to His divine pi resonant) in the one person of God the Son These two natures of God and man, though now inseparable are yet distinct and confused, each one having its proper operations ; the minute is still in Invite, the divine still divine, the immaterial still immaterial, with the human, the finite, the material added on How different this is from Judge YVilhnms's really ignorant misconception of the subject if he wants to know how such a wonderful monument of mercy was wrought for the redemption of Judge Williams, as well all other sinners, 1 warn him that he has here again to bow down his erring reason in humble adoration of the truth and the power of the great Adonai It is hardly worth while to take any notice of a footnote in the judge's little pamphlet But us there are two mistatements in such a brief sluice, it is better to correct them The judge states that " in a letter recently addressed by) Dean Slattery, of Geelong, to Hu Argus this text (the three wit- ness's) was cited, and the strongest reliance placed upon it This statement is not correct I quoted the text as I did all the others-and they were not a few-in its own place in the series, and made no special re- mark about it, did not give it any emphasis or accentuation He says also that "no one who entered into the controversy ever questioned the genuineness or authority of the verse " He seems to forget, either con veracity) or otherwise, that a courteous letter was written in) "Uncial" on this very point to which I sent a short reply in explanation and defence of the verse The reply was accepted without any rejoinder Such being the facts of this case, is it not really very coxcombical of the judge to give this false version of his as a proof of the ignorance prevailing on the subject ' I should be very sorry, indeed, and very much ashamed to have only the little false smattering of knowledge on this critical point exhibited in the same page of the pamphlet I cannot allow the strictures of the judge on the sacred Word of God to pass without protest I have never read a more disgusting agglomeration of Heart) It is a painful and a fearful proof of the lamentable conse qualities of reading the Bible by the dangerous and delusive light of private judgment How true that " the unlearned and unwary wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction " As a last word from one who has the in crests of religion and truth in his unworthy charge, and is therefore bound to protect them, I would offer one short word of advice to the judge if he wish to preserve any respect for him self and for the high and responsible office which he happens to hold, 1 would seriously exhort him to mind his own business" -Yours, ka, sister he uUi u a Lindum.
