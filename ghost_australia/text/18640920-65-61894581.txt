Betting, 3 to 2 on Tarragon, 6 to 1 each .against Volunteer, Tall Tall, and Ada^ ' This race was the race of the day, and Mr. Town,' who' had I pulled off the two previous races, was again successful. Notwithstanding the great weight, lOst. llb,," thát Tarragon ¡ carried, he was a hot favorite, and he fully justified the confidence of his ' laokers. There were many who, considering tho weights, thought the'field the better horse, and tacked it accordingly ; and although they lost their money, they found some consolation in the splendid ' finish of VoiuAteerl'vvho was nearly upsetting tho . pot. At the first attempt the.flag fell, and Junius rushed to the front with a speed which was too \- great to last, Tall-Tall being second and Lilla third. In passing tlie stand Junius led by several . lengths, and no alteration in the positions'of the three leaders took place till the Rocks were reached, ' \vhen Lilla\was reached and passed by some of those that had been in the. ruck behind. The horses began "ftKtail. off considerably along the backstretch; andTarrag«i, %ho had been making a waiting race of it, begunj^srlfcjy prominently ; tho pace, however, wasWas yet CTfcnparatively slow. Junius still maintainemthe premier position in pass- ing the Stand the seewd time, Tall being second, . and-Tnrragon third. Jurmis now found the pace too -fast , for him, and at the RockB-turn he resigned his pride of place to Tall Tall, who took up the . running, and led till about half-way along the back of the course, .where he was joined by : Tarragon, and a few, seconds afterwards by Volunteer. It was . now evident that the race lay between those three, .and there .were not -a few who anticipated that Volunteer, with suoh an advantage-in regard to .weight, would secure the prize. This anticipation was increased when on reaohing the Derby Corner Volunteer, amid the. greatest excitement on the stand, was' seen to forge his way to' .the front. * As ' -they-entered the roils Tall Tall fell off beaten ; while Tarragon, fat tho distance-post) went lip to Volunteer's" flanks. For a few ' strides the, two leaders were heck and neck, both jockeys adminis .' tering the whip freely. ? 'Hie favorite responded gamely, despite the weight on his back, and past the post almost a length in advance of Mr. Tait's horse, and beating Tall Tall for third place.
