WHISTLING BULLETS. IMUSIC OF THE IMAUSEPR A correspondent of the "Morning Post." writing from South Africa, says:--"Ever man in the way of fire has his own likes and dislikes. Some men always bob to a" bullet: others catch their breath at a. shell; others dread the patter of a Maxim. It is not a.question of timidity or of dead liness, but of personal antipathy. In fantry fire is, beyond all question. -most fatal, but many pay less heed to the whispered whistle of the bullet than to any other of the flying forms of death. There is a bird out here, a little brown bird like a brambling, with a note that exactly mimics the Mauser, and an un comfortable habit of fluting it in ugly places. The Lee-Metford's note is nearly a third lower, and the Martini has the dull buzz of a laden bee. Be tween the three there can be no mis taking, but the loers have four or five; other rifles harder to recognise. The Mauser's most melodious period is 1S00 yards; point blank it is nothing but a nasty nasal sneer. but one may be a poor judge of nmlody at close quarters. A flat-nosed or 'dum-dumbed' Mauser pro bably makes a sound which one attri butes to some unknown rifle, but the queerest note of all comes from a Mauser spinning the wrong way after a richocet. It is like the coughing of a sick ghost--Indescribably curdling. The worst and best of bullet music 3. that one always hears it behind one."
