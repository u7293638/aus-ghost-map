The platform it Castlemaine station was crowded, and Mr Vivicc met with a cord ii reefing from his constituent' J The Premier s fares ell speech was delivered at the Theatre Royal, which it is filled to its utmost capacity Councillor ( Hilton mayor of Castlemaine, presided Mr outvie who was received with cheers, band Mr Mayor and Gentlemen It is a. pic isant thing, to meet a friendly audience, and especially when one is in the position of retiring from public life instead of entering thereupon I feel to it I could not either out of courtesy a 11 of respect to you or out of respect to an self give up public life without first meeting my constituents in Castlemaine (cheers and I have come There more for the purpose of say on? Good bw at all events for a time than of in ii mu a speech Of course on on occasion of this sort something is always expected to be soil and in turning over in my mind the matter I in St touch up in at tins directs 1 gradually felt one thine, ocean white on the top of mother till I bis in to see; the time allotted on an occasion of this nature would be sufficient to enable me to say all I dear- to tell you I do not know whether the gentlemen at the far end of the room can he is mc distinctly because I am not in cot ! voice tonight I caught a cold last week, and although it has disappeared it has left me with my old enemy a relaxed state of the vocal chord" and therefore I feel so hoarse that I may have some difficulty in getting through the remark s I desire to make But I am sure I shall have your sympathy, and that you will endeavour to catch what I never without putting me to the danger of using my voice too much (Cheers THE JJlb'-OLUilON 01 1883 On Beginning of 1882 I returned to this colony after an absence of nearly two years, I found the Part ment in session had been adjourned for the holidays but that Parliament never met again asters are all attire bir Jury in 0 J other] the then Premier, be commenced His J Excellency to dissolve parliament before the House had an oppor- times of meeting after the adjournment One of the chief le sons even for the dissolution yy is put in a memorandum sent to the Governor by Mr Bryan O'Loghlen, that the House had been so obstructive that it was quite impossible that any business could be done in Ptrba meat and he lecoiinneiidcd the Governor to dissolve Parliament so that an appeal might be made to the country in the month of February that is barely two months about six weeks later my return to the colony I found myself on this platform soliciting. the suffrages of the citizens of Castlemaine and by your good help and sUpport 1 was returned on that occasion as one of your men here Having been away, for such a length of time I was entirely out of fettle and though I had been keeping myself as well inform ed us was possible at the distance of events in the colony yet many things had transept "ed of which I had only a faint idea I learnt, however, one thing that the period from the formation of the O'Loghlen Ministry up to the time of the dissolution of that Far liniment had been i p end of anxiety and trouble almost anarchy in a political sense, both in the House and in the country. In the House you had votes of no confidence every now and again, no business could be transacted measures of importance to the country could not be dealt with, and not one single line of the estimates was passed through Parliament in that session though it occupied, I think some six or seven months The estimates were afterwards passed by the present Gov- comment in the new Parliament which came into existence Well, I learnt sufficient then to know that the country was weary and sick of the state of turmoil and trouble that had been experienced for a very considerable time and that the whole people, from north to south and east to west, were longing to '"get into a haven of rest, of that the business of the country could be a matter of the proper place, viz, in the parliament of the colony When the new Paris ment assembled it was found the Government were in so small a minority that although a formal vote of no confidence was moved by me and seconded by Mr Berry, we did so without a single word and without my arraignment of li river, of the conduct of the outgoing Ministers "He put Routine simple and distim b footing-that the country had pronounced its opinion of the Ministry and that we had only to execute the wishes of the country, and therefore a. mere formal motion to indicate that the Ministry no longer possessed the confidence of the House because they no longer possessed the confidence of the country, was all that was required That motion was carried and the present Ministry was formed i in memory 01 am MINISTRY. That Jlmistri has been 1 down from the be- ginning and is still J known as the Coalition Ministry At the outset of the existence of that "Him to although, there is no doubt a majority of the country approved of the course which was taken by Mr Bent) and myself there were extremists on both sides of a ohticsvvho. predicted that the Coalition C Government would last no time, would do no good v oil and would, soon die amidst the obloquy of the t hole country but this prediction has not been fulfilled (Cheers.) shortly after it was create 1 the Government was confronted with various questions of a somewhat important character I think outside of legislation altogether one of the earliest the nips that the Government had to deal with it is the intention of the Irish informers You remember that wheat those informers were brought here from 3 England on board a steamer the whole country rose in arms against those men being introduced into the colony and the action of the Government at that time was cer- t fully felt to be in accord with the feeling? of the country, and had a great deal to do with giving, us our last hold upon the con- stituencies (Cheeta) Shortly afterwards the questions of federation and the annexa- t on of New Guinea and the other islands of the 1 critic arose and then followed the mention of the French Government sending convicts into New Caledonia, and the question of the New Hebrides which had hitherto been considered English ground, because occupied by 1 English missionaries, bein,, taken by France for the refuse of European countries The feeling expressed from time to time throughout the country by the local bodies of all sorts and in every quarter testified conclusively to the fact that the Ministry were thoroughly in accord with the whole people of the colony in dealing a with these subjects Here I would like to express my gratitude once and for all cape call) to the people of Castlemaine because during my tenure of office and the busy time I have personally had not only in dealing with questions of domestic policy, but also with questions of foreign policy, I have not been able to run up and see my constituents so often as I would have liked to do, and yet I have never found them wanting either by resolutions of public meetings or otherwise in strengthen in" my hands or the hands of the Government in de along with those important questions which affected the colony at large. (Cheers ) "Sort, I want to take a rather hist) faunce over two or three points which are perfectly familiar to you, and, therefore cannot be of very much interest, but it will serve to recall to your memory a little of the work we have done, and afford me an opportunity of it may he putting on the coping, stone of some of that work CONCORD IN a HE CABINEt! Before going into these matters, however, I ought to state that from its first inception down to the present, the coalition Government has been as much united in dealing with public affairs as any party Government that at existed (Cheers ) I speak now in the presence of the greater part of my colleagues, and I say there has never been an unpleasant feeling in that Cabinet from the beginning to the present time. (Cheers ) 1 here has never been a quarrel, we have had difference of opinion, and once or the ice, or a few times we may have had to count heads to see it Inch and) the weight of opinion event but as a rule we never even divided on a question I testify that on behalf of my) colleagues At the beginning it was perhaps somewhat doubtful whether the various members of the C Cabinet would work harmoniously!) together, because we met each other with this feeling that we came one from the east and the other from the west, and that he had to maintain somewhat of an attitude of antagonism (Laughter ) Atall eventsvvehndtotakecaie that our respective rights from part) point of view were not encroached upon 'there may have been some feeling of that 1 and at the beginning but it died away almost at once, and if there has been one feature of the Cabinet more prominent than another it has been the anxiety manifested from the very first that each member would treat the other with the utmost generosity and that one side would rather read some of their own feeling than ask the other side to yield In that spirit the vi halo career of this Cabinet now coming to an end so far as at present constituted, has been one of peace and unit), and their career in Parliament may be referred to with pride and satisfaction (Cheers 1 The testing n) of one of our bitterest opponents use the word in a poll tical sense entirely was to the effect that the Coalition Government had done at least one good thing it had destroyed all animosities-, and brought members of Parliament to recognise each other almost is friends (Cheers ) That was the effect in Parliament, and the effect in the country has been somewhat similar All those animosities which had been existing for years has died out. We have all been able to attend to our ott a business, to promote our own advantage and thus promote the interests of the colony, for the last three years has been a period of great prosperity to the colony at large (Hear, hear ) ABOLITION OF POLITICAL l'Ai UONAGJ' I will now with your permission allude to one or two points in the legislation of the present Parliament You will recollect in one of my earlier speeches to the electors of Castlemaine I spoke most strongly to) You about political patronage that was eating like a canker into the vitals of the nation (Cheers) Hold) on at that time that if I was returned to the new Parliament all my influence would be used to put an end to political patronage Now it till a view of bringing about the destruction of that patronage, the Government introduced the Umhin) Commissioners Act and the Public Service Act I regard those acts of e\cc0ilniL,It "rate importance, and I want to tell you strictly) how they have worked, and to let you understand what has got to be done in order to preserve the state of things that now exists Our friend Mr Patterson, the Ben lot member for Castlemaine, was the first set on before the time I am now speaking of to give the blow to political patronage when he was Minister of 1 rulings, b) saying, "I shall not make any more appointments , I will hand the patronage over to the engineer in chief, the secretary, and other officials who are to sponsible for the work of these men (Cheers.) Of course, that was the act of a single man, and the whole thing could be overturned by the next Minister who came into office If it is necessary the whole thing should be dealt with as a matter of I up Not only what lev cr there was a vacancy, hut where there was no vacancy, you found mern hereof Parliament running to the Railway department every day in the week, and every hour in the day asking for a billet for friend or one of their supporters Tlietlung became intolerable and on one occasion, Mr Patterson denounced the whole system, and said that before members went to sleep he had to look under his bed to see it anyone was there who wanted a billet (Jntigbtei) The thing became intolerable, not only in the interests of the country, because it was destroying the public service, but call mere belief Parliament, for they could not get away from the evil (Cheers) The first events of a member would come to him and Buy, Get this little application carried into effect for mi, and when the member Eaid "W li it can I do he was told Oh, go to the commissioner and put him in he is a clever j ming fellow, and you can do it The application was made, and he was put in (Laughter) Perhaps he was not wanted then, but in he went He might turn out to be a firstrate fellow, or he might turn out a great mail, but if he was in much the harder it was to get rid of him for it was impossible, if he committed a fault, to punish him The member, his friend of his people went to the Minister and said, "He is a young chap a mere be j, give him another chance ' and so it became notorious 311 the department that you had only escape Sufficient political influence, and all things were possible (Cheers i oil could get anybody in you bled and you could 1 keep him in as long as you liked It did not matter what happened and the ordinary rules of business were utterly ignored THIS RA I LU V. COMMIWOM US Not only was that the case but from the fact that the policy of the railways i is completely under the thumb of Ministers as they came in there was no continuity of the policy of managing the railways because every successive Munster find his own little fad (Cheers) One wanted to build a big she 1 and another to pull it down, or another desired to dig a big dock, and another to fill it up Thus matters went on one spending a lot of money, and another spending more on the top of a useless expenditure The handing of this depart- went over to the commissioners, not a poll recalled, but bodies experts has had the result that the continuity of the policy as well as responsibility in respect to railways has been preserved throughout. There was no responsibility before a Minister was in one day and out the next, and when in Opposition you could not attack him, but the commissioners are there to day and they will he to morrow, as if they do something to say which can in be complained of next week they are there responsible for their actions You will remember under the old system accidents were very fi present and very serious the loss to the revenue in consequence being very great We have had one or two accidents since the commissioners bookcases, but they seem to be dying out, and the thought never eat is our heads that there is a chance of a serious accident on the railway s In this respect and in many other matters immense improvements have been made To show how well tins butter Commissioners Act was thought out by the Government and how well it was drafted, when the commissioners took office the act was put in their hands and they were told There is your au shortly, and there are your instructions and you have to go by there and look to nothing else, and they have never once applied Since they took office, or have not required to apply, to the Attorney-General for an explana- tion of the measure They have seen it if it on Tay their own residing" like an As Cool That fact speaks very well for an act of Parliament which was passed to work with enormous machinery is our railways consist of Cheers.) Before parting from the railways I want to make one remark, although it is not quite appropriate to It hat I have just been saying The railways are a splendid national property, and are not proving friendly to day I would have the people of Vi toria to say that they will lay it down as a rule that blind not be deviated from, that these railways will be made to pay the interest on the national debt heels) and that as soon as they do that the Kites for passengers, as well RS goods, should be reduced If that rule be followed, I have no hesitation in saying that before many years are over you will have one of the finest properties that ever a nation possesses 1 Bijou adopt that principle, and let it he known that it is to be always Mien effect to the credit of Victoria will be surpassed by that of no other nation THE PUULlf SJ ItVICL ACI In respect to the Public Service Act, a great deal has been said by one or two newspapers vi Inch would seem to indicate that there is some sort of dissatisfaction in the public service with regard to the measure There is a Public "mice association in Melbourne and the racial era came to me as a deputation with their president Mr 1 her whose name will be held in honour and esteem It ing after we are gone for the great service he has rendered to Victoria-at their head The deputation his right under my) notice certain chances which they wished made in the net ) at the) prefaced their statement with the desire that the, act should be maintained in its integrity J he) did not want to injure the net and in that respect they will 1 that they) believed they were flanking the views of nine tenths of the whole of the civil so nice. a line is the cause of the constant "Tumblers that we have heard' First first let me point out that the act was based on the tan ament J principles-first and stated in the preamble that the entrance into the public service of \ let me should be by means of competan e culmination | and should be open to et cr) man and 15. in the colony vi who hail passed the civil service examination, and second, that a motion in the service should he b) seniority and merit. These are the fun lamented objects of the act and at all events in these respects it is working to perfection (Cheers.) No one has raised a voice expect one person when I said that I did not lab that any body should be injuriously affected by the act one young man wrote to me to this effect - De u Sir -I am one who passed the civil service examination on such a date and I stood seventh on the list, ino months after I passed I got into the Government are to) at a salary of 100 per minima 1 this quite content until I team d Some time after that the other chaps, who had passed at the same examination had got into the service at ISO a) tar, and I think it is very much that I, who stood seventh on the list should have a lower salary than those other persons who stood 1 ment). second and twenty third on it (Laughter) I thought that the youth was a little ignorance and blunt quite contrary to the general habit of the V Victorian South (Laughter and cheers ) Hoitever at the end of the letter I found this postscript -"Of course I know this has been done in accordance with the act because I am only 17, and the) are 10 (Cheers ) Unit in the point. The act provides that anyone entering' the service at the age of 19 shall start with a salary of £80 but in order not to keep boys out of the service, provision is made for then bom,, allotted to enter it alter the) reach 10 ) years on the condition that they take a reduction of £10 in their salary for at er) year under 10 The youth really was getting more than he would have obtained in a bank or a business catch sediment but still he was not satisfied, so I sent him back a letter as follows -' I am jorn that the other chaps are older than you but I be not think 1 TO in my way less) possible for the date of your birth Loud laughter ) that was one of the complaints made against the operation of the act, The only other complaint was fine one A clniicrsii) man had come to me, and said ' I want to get into the public service I said i on must pass the ex animation Look out for the advertisement and co throughly the same routine as other people he replied Must I he ex mined to which I E and Certain!) this response was 'Hut I have passed the matriculation, and I said, All right, but we dont ) ut iconic m see cause they hate matriculate 1 If that were done no he) could get in unless he had matriculate 1 and that is not our object We want the billets to be thrown open to ever) be!) ufterpussinç, a certain culmination If we made a university examination the passport there are a certain number of the sons of rich men who would pass it, and so keep out everybody else (Cheers ) We have therefore laid down that the principle of the law is absolute, and it meets every way the objects we had in view when we passed it. On these two fundamental points there has not been any difficulty What, then, has been the difficulty It has been where, in the desire not to press unduly upon any individual in the service, the provision has been made that if any man was found in a billet where he was getting a salary more than the work he was doing entitled him to, that work was to be classified and it it was only worth a smaller sum of money than was paid to him, the next incumbent was to get a lower salary. The object at first holding the position was to have the same salary as he received when the act came into force, so that no man in the community could have his slimy reduced except for some good reason In endeavouring to do this, the Public Service Board had to classify the work done throughout the whole of the establishments When I tell you that the Public Service Board set about classifying this work it is almost equal went to informing you that every man in the service classified his own work that is where the sorrow arose a very much valued his own work, and thought that he ought to be high up. He tried to compare his work with that of his neighbour whose work was el assisted higher than his, and you can tell perfectly well, when a in in has to value himself of the work that he does, that he will give a milk ciently high estimate (Lutcjliter ) There were a great many appeal- against the first classifications Some of them were made on just and reasonable grounds, others on mere speculation, and some of them out of sheer impudence I will give you a sample One or two officers who came before the commissioners were asked, ' What have you to say about your work' -You are not pleased" "No, was the reply, "we should be higher up. ' "What is your reason for saying that-'' "Oh, so and so is up, and we thought that we should be up too " " But have you any thing to say why you should be classified higher " Well," was the reply of one man "I saw everyone else trying to get up a peg, and I thought I would try to do so also" that is a specimen of the trouble which not only the Government but the Public service Board have been put to, and I must pay the commissioners the high compliment of saying that more industrious and intelligent gentlemen than they never worked for any Government (Cheers ) But I want to tell you (li it these little matters loss on the surface which you bear on arise from the minute blisters on the skin of those gentlemen who me in oflues-(clieeis) -und that they have nothing to do with the life blood of the act (Cheers ) I am certain that the people of this country would never return to the old system so long as they have the one now in existence, which puts everyone in this country on a fun, level, and equitable position. (Cheers) The act has been criticised in a hostile spirit by some members of Parliament, but their criticism, which was some times very old and very curious, was not considered of much value, except when the Government felt that they had to answer it, lest their friends outside should think it was unansw embie. TU- MALLEE! AND LAND ACTS, when I might remind you about the mallee Act a measure by which an area of something like twelve millions of acres, which had for centuries past been a howling wilderness, attempted to be occupied from time to time, but mvaiiablydeseited, and in which, at the time the act was introduced, all settlement was hanging by a thread. Two or three men were hanging on, having spent tens of thousands of pounds, and hoping to get their money back after the bill was passed. Almost the whole of the large area mentioned was occupied, will revert to the country, half of it in five years and the remainder in 20 years, a greatly improved estate, which will be of the highest value at all events to the next generation. I will next mention the Land Act which came in later on. This Land Act dealt with the whole of the remain mg lands of the colon) About 17 millions of acres that had never been utilised from the time of the first inhabitant taken up under lenses one half of which were for a term of five years and the other half for 20 years the seasons since then Into not been at unsatisfactory especially to sheep farmers but the settlers in the mallee country may hope for better times I am told this mallee scrub with water, would become the garden of Victoria that barring water it possesses el cr) thing, that could be desired and the whole area whilst now being 1 hat met this passed and now I am glad to ant has been found to work in mines) In a short time the whole of this country will be taken upon terms which are perfectly satisfactory) The leases are for terms of 14 years and at the end of that time the whole [ of the land equal to more than half of the whole colony. will come back to the people splendidly improved, and so valuable an asset that I believe the value of that fund alone will be sufficient to pay of the national debt In ape king of the burdens imposed on the _ con le of the colony, he must not forget the large asset we have to set against them though at the same time I do not wish to encourage the people of the colony, or of Castlemaine, to borrow too Inrfecl) on mortgage I think there is great danger in time OTHER is Mr vbUI J i I must rapid!) pass over some of the remains" neta tie passed, such as the Discipline Act which gave us a real army of defence there is no doubt that at the time the act was passed 1 the old volunteer system was practically defunct. The whole thing had fallen into disrepute and as) hon colleague the Minister of Defence introducing the act and earning it through showed a vigor and energy, which I have always admired, and rendered a great service to the people of the colony He give us a live aunt, and infused a spirit of made pendence and self help by the establishment of rifle clubs and cadet corns and putting the whole on a footing" which makes us feel that we have a live and) did not a dead v Hunter System Then there was the 1 and way) Construction Act I will only say) it provided for work sol "rent magnitude, which are rapidly being constructed 1 more so than at any former period the whole of the money required to construct these railways was provided by a loan act subse queenly passed, and it has only been the propriety) of not interfering in her) with the labour market of the colony that has prevented the whole of these works being undertaken at the present time It would be unreasonable and unsatisfactory to push on with those works too hastily, though at the same time, it would he is satisfactory to delay them too long There was another act which perhaps, did not interest Castlemaine or the country districts too) much and that was the Harbour Trust Act for ) years past there had been a title of bringing ships into a port of Melbourne VI c rk to effect that object has been going on intermittently for the last 30 ACRES and is now on the eve of being accomplished and that by) a body that has devoted the whole of its attention to its duties and w Inch has been responsible for the whole of the work it has done I suppose in another year and a half we shall have salt water flowing in the canal The Judicature 1 all was a measure of great importance 1 because it provided that the pencil should be full) manner 1, and that there should be an equity side to the Supreme Court. It abolished many of the tech- culties which hitherto existed, and provided for a variety of arrangements giving great advantages to the people of the colony which they had not hitherto possessed Then there was the Mining on Private Property Act for about 25 years a Mining on Pi iv ate Proper!) Bill had been introduced by successive Ministries but always failed to become law I think no fewer than six times the measure was sent up to the Upper House and in every) case rejected In Una case it was again sent up with certain models cities but at the same time providing for what I said in Castlemaine two years ago, was that I would make sure by the latter of this country that not one acre of the colon should be tabooed to the miner-(oncers) and that I would throw open the whole of the lands of the colony in that respect it has been said that there are hitches in that act and that it has not worked well The best proof that it has worked well is found in the fact that it is in use everyday that it has not worked so well as could be desired must be admitted I Hie Upper House made certain amendments in the bill which did not satisfy either the the Ministry or the Government We tried to have these amendments with hand but failed to do so and the question arose as was stated by the Attorney-General in the assembly- Are we to put the bill on the statute book as it is an 1 amen 1 it hereafter, or drop it altogether as has been done for the last 24 J cars We clip of what we thought the lesser evil We took the bill for what it was worth and there it is. Itbiswoiled well so far and it can be amended much more easily than was the introduction of the original measure (hear bear) I now come to two matters which have not been received with the same univers ii appro! ation I refer to the Licensing 'Act and the Factories Act These measures have been characterised as grandmotherly le stations Well so far as I can see from the tea Vncv of legislation not only in Europe but in America this grandmotherly least it ion is coming very much to the front and though no doubt many of the provisions of these bills interest country people less than they do those residing in Melbourne because the evils dealt with arise chiefly in the city yet I am sure that the country dis- facts do no wish to prevent Melbourne from liming such legislation as will make the inhabitants of that city as happy and prosperous as they can be IRRIGATION Jo pass away from what may lye calle 1 the enactments that have been made I may refer to one other question that has not yet assumed the shape of an act of parliament in the Full form we intend it should hereafter and that is the question of irrigation (Cheers ) I think I may appeal to the meeting as representative of the whole country to say that into no question that has concerned the people of this colony have the Government thrown themselves with so much vigour as into that of irrigation (Cheers ) After the last session but one of his liament was finished the Government sent Mr Deakin to America to study the question there may be brought back an amount of information that was absolutely marvellous to have been obtained in so short a time and he afterwards re ci ned well merited applause for the complete and picturesque v ly in which he placed that information before the farmers of this country (Cheers ) I wish to mention one important advantage that incidentally resulted from that trip of Mr Deakin s to the States and it just shows how important it is to have men in high places who have their eyes open, so that they may utilise for their own country the information they receive in other lands Mr Deakin when in America found that in that country they use sheet iron piping different altogether from that which was used in this colony We had always used cast iron mains whilst sheet iron was used and riveted together instead of wasting them in the mould Mr Deakin or "any ing this, brought the matter under the notice of the engineers here A careful inquiry was made and the result is that as far as the closest approximation of cost can be made instead of £100 000 as would be the cost under a contract which the Government were just on the eve of entering into for the supply of mains in connexion with the man can these mains will be great and will lost a great deal longer for the sum of 360 000 (cheers) -so that for that one contract alone of £100 000 one fifth of the amount has been actually saved When we look ahead and see the enormous quantity of mains that will still be required you can imagine the Bavin, that has been made by Mr Deakin simply having his eyes about him (Cheers ) HIL FINANCES With respect to financial matters I think I may refer, with some satisfaction, to the condition of our finances. we have had very difficult times to face in connection with the finances since the present Government took office. the very first time" I saw the treasurer was that I had to raise about 6,000 000 of money to within two years in order to pay off old loans Well that was a serious thing to do to go to the London market so rapid!) and that on the back of mother Inn for railway purposes The situation caused me I assure you the deepest anxiety) Hot ever the whole thing, was carried through in a manner that was satisfactory to the country. The colony was congratulated by the press from time to time as we were able to pay off our loans without any difficulty whatever Well! now we have for the first time for many years brought down the nominal ex premature on the 1 estimates within the nominal income on the Estimates in former years and for many c ara back had been the custom in some cases to vote but Ire Is of thousands of pounds more than the revenue of the year as shown upon the J estimates the Treasurer would say lean out) at six millions of money) but it out his M n can vote six and a half millions Of course that is not 1 business at all as set cr) one can see Still it was done and the resultant that great sums of money were voted for public works but not half the amount was expended an 1 instead of carrying out the directions of the House, which he could not carry out the House having directed 1 him to do with it he could not do the 1 treasurer had to dendewhit to works we are to be undertake on and he expended the money in such directions as he pleased The members for the vm tons districts brought pressure to bear upon him and it generally) h happened that the biggest beggar got the biggest shine (Laughter) Well for the first time we have managed during the last the years to keep the ostensible e perth time within the ostensible income with the result that the Treasurer has carried out the works as I armament directe 1 (Cheers) Under the old system members got votes on the 1 estimates and went home rejo cans but at the end of the year it was often found that the money had not been expended and had lap 1 into the consolidated revenue (Hear hear) There is an other plan ing feature which I desire to bring under your notice We have the largest Ho it nig balance at the band a that we have had for years and we have no anxiety when the hill year comes round and the late to and remittances of six or seven hundred thousand pounds to London (Hear hear) but the pleasantest feature of all is the rise in the value of Victorian debentures When the present Government to at once the debentures stood in the London market at £101 5s , but the latest quotation taken from a London circular which 1 saw to clay shows that the) stand at £10 > 10s and for the first time for many years they have actually topped the debentures of New South Wales (Cheers ) W c bland at the very top of the whole of the Australian colonies at least we did for a month or ten of ago and I have no doubt we shall resume the position again (Hear hear) These are points which the Ministry are justified in bringing under your notice (Hear, hear.) Another feature well worth mentioning is that when we took office we found at the tar JUS departments 4" i men of the unemployed working for di) values Lu her the Government for the years there has notbeciianiancniplojcduithuttia) (Cheers ) the Government do not take credit for all this but there is no doubt a great deal of the prosperity which the colony has recently enjoyed has been owing to the political quietude which has enabled every body to at tend to his business and the confidence w Inch capitalists have felt in investing their money in works which tend to promote the general progress of the country (Hear hear ) there can be no doubt that a nation at peace is a nation with prosperity (Cheers ) AND WIKPJ Avro 11 DI RYIIOV and not a few words as to the present position of the federation question the annexation of New Guinea and the importation of 1 reach convicts to New Caledonia was with regard to feel more tie are at present in this position that Ino out of the eight colonies in Austral asm have united and formed a federal council These five constitute a million and a half of people just above half of the whole of the Australasian colonies (Cheers) No doubt it is a matter for deep regret that the other colonies did not come in one from almost a pure accident and another from a mistake! in action on the part of one of its Ministers As to the third New South Wales, I dont know exactly what was he reason why she would not come in, and I won t guess, but it is a matter of great concern and regret that New South Wales is out. (Hear, hear ) My own feeling is that they will not remain long" but I see in this mornings papers there is something about the doings of German war vessels at Samoa which will be very startling" to our cousins in New Zealand 'They left that Sunioa ought to belong to them and they must be labouring under a misgivinG that it they had joined the union they would have been able to ex- refuse to far more powerful influence over Sainoun matters than they can possibly expect to do acting separately (Cheers.) Well, the first ended in Council meets at Hobart on the rath and Mr Barry and I have been appointed to be the first representatives from this colony No doubt it will be a very humble beginning, and we don't want to make more of it than is desirable, but it will be a fruitful seed Like the grain of mustard seed, it will grow into a large tree, which ultimately, I believe, before long will envelope the whole of the colonies. (Cheers.) Meanwhile, there is no reason why the colonies who desire to agree on certain things should not be at liberty to do so, and that is precisely what our 1 enabling Act permits us to do (Hear ) is with regard to the question of annexation, you all know how New Guinea Came to grief to a large extent, by the in action of the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, but I can t help feeling although it is the first time I have said it on any public platform, that the German occupation of New Guinea would possibly never have occurred but for the unfortunate telegram of Sir Alexander Stuart to the Colonial Office stating that the people of Sydney did not agree with the telegram sent by Mr Service urging the immediate annexation of New Guinea (Hear hear) that unfortunate tele | gunn fell like a bombshell among the agents general, unel disheartened them to an extent you can easily conceive, and, at the same time, it strengthened Lord Derby in his inaction, because it enabled him to say, "Oh, they are not agreed among themselves, why should I bother The result was that whilst the Coloni d Office was waiting aiidwhilstNevvSouth W ale was at ing through the action of its Premier G rmany stepped in and snatched away one half of New Guinea It will always remain a bitter remembrance, and future historians will write the story of this annexation of New Guinea with quite as much sorrow and regret as is expressed at the present time (Hear, hear.) The only thing" we can console ourselves with is that the Germans make good neighbours and are friendly to England, so that we are not likely to come to loggerheads we with them in these seas (fair, hear) but that is poor consolation in comparison with being the Union Jack floating over every island in the Western Pacific (Cheers ) We had a terrible fight against against the importation of French convicts into New Caledonia, and we went to this extent that up to the present time the French Government have never attempted to find a single convict to New Caledonia under the new law, and conviction in these seas appears, to have received its deathblow (Cheers) Nothing is to be done with the New Hebrides until Australia is consulted, and I look on that as seeing those islands taken from France for all time to come (Cheers BLAMED IN PARLIAMENT Let all the hard work which the present Government of this colony has had, has not saved them from blame Iarhiimentwould be of no use if it could not balances as well as praise us, but the Government have had no reason to complain whatever, for we have received an amount of support that probably no Government ever had before We have had an amount of consolidated support from what used to be both sections of the House, which upon are to me to be one solid phalanx of men anxious to support the Government in carrying on the business of the country (Cheers ) Man) of these members of Parliament have aided us more by their silence than they could possibly have done by any amount of talk and especially to those who sat behind the Ministerial benches' be once I more praise than if they had gabbled the whole session (Cheers ) Put then I say, there is a great deal of blame cast upon us-nil that has been done all the hard work we have got through has been too much-and tie are charged with doing it baal) Of course there are words and an) man if he can read can use words and can express ideas and it does not matter whether those ideas are correct or not the) pass current in Parliament You remember the case of Haman and Mortlecin Unman would not be complete so long as Mordecm set in the loin, s gate With the Opposition nothing could be done r gilt so long us Service hat on the Treasury benches (LnuJiter ) I don t find fault but I wish to my mind you that much of the work it to me said he had camped and rushed through and used our strength tyrannical to carry because we had the voting power behind us had to be rushed through, or it would not have been passed because these men wasted so much time in the earlier part of the session (Cheers ) One of the remarks which was often made was that the fort was too strong and that it was a bad thing for the country to have a weak Opposition I hat was repeated again and again by an ex Minister opposite, until one night I remind ed that the assertion had been uttered again and again on the other side of the House that the Government was too strong and the Opposition too to cal, and I added that I would ask them to remember the late Government when it was in power it had a very strong Opposition and I a id to the ex Munster How did you like it and how did the business of the country get on under it' You were in office for 20 months and did hardly any thing you did it pass a line of the 1 str mines and that was because you find what you are now longing for namely), a strong Opposition My opinion is this and 1 State it when I am going out of the racket at all events for a time, and so have nothing to gain nor to lose by Bpeal mg my mind that a weak Government is a curse to the country (Cheers ). It is most desirable, certainly, that there should 1 be no Opposition to scan una criticise fairly and properly but not to obstruct but that the Government should be always at the mercy of the Opposition is a thin- intolerable for the Government itself, and most disadvantageous to the interests of the country at large (Cheers) One great advantage arising from a strong Go i eminent being in office is that it can accept amendments from either side, and so the measure can be rendered more perfect by this very process than they could be if she Government had refused to accept alterations simply in order to show their strength, although such amendments might tend to improve the bill That is a point which, I think, well worth attention The people say that we will have to amend a lot of these measures, because we li it e passed them hurriedly) and have so hoped thern, but we are always amending acts Some of the best acts which have been passed here have been amended again in I again, and one gentleman who had said that we had passed legis I lition that we ought to be ashamed of has had his name associated it with one of the most part in bills that was ever introduced in this country I refer to the Mining" 1 ego lutions Act and yet that act has had to be twice amended An act does not break down when you amend it so long as the machinery of the measure works well and fulfils its purpose An amendment to a measure did not therefore show that it is., a s sniped act (Cheers ) It was just the same with the Torrens Act, which I introduced 10 years ago V\ e carried it through the house like a sack of coals Not a law) or would take the hill up and Mr Torrens and Mr Coppin came to me and nsl e 1 it I would take charge of it in the Legislative Assembly) said that I did not pretend to know anything about the law relating to the transfer of land The question however, was whether the country should wait until a lawyer was converted to the measure, iindvvcdidnotbing of tin sort We got some 3- members to sign a round robin the if they world not spen k a single word but that they would vote just as I told them and so we carried the half dozen clauses in the face of the most determined Opposition after we had got that far the oppositionists put on their huts and wal! ed away so we carried the bill through that night The measure was put on the statute book and then the lawyers came to help us, and put the actings but if we had had to wait for their help at first we might never have had the measure It is so with all other bills with regard to the administration of the Givenunent I think that I may claim that the country at large has recognised that the administration of the affairs of the country has been conducted in an honest and up right fashion (Cheers) That 19 to say we have not been charged with corruption (Cheers ) There has been no sustume charge of any sort brought against 113 No doubt if you often I 111 the Speaker s gallery you will hear a member attacking another with great earnestness, but members know whether he means what he says or not Strangers may be deceived but the members only say, Oh, that is very well put on (Laughter ) that is the advantage of not always sending new members to Parliament (laughter) that is one advantage of returning old hands who have served you well You can trust them and rely upon them and though I am out of it myself, I would have you remember that when the elections come on (Cheers and laughter ) API OIN IM) NI 01 Mr. JUSTICE Ki III LORD I have said that the present Government have not been charged with corruption but we have been charged with 0110 job and the biggest job ever attempted in this country I refer to the placing of the late Attorney-General on the bench of the Supreme Court I say that is the biggest job ever perpetrated because it was perpetrated by both Houses of Parliament almost unanimously J very one knew that the bill for the appointment of a sixth judge meant that Mr Kerferd was going on to the bench He was warmly complimented on the floor of the House by several members and when those compliments were paid to him they were cheered in every corner (Cheers ). If we had liked we could have put the name of George Briscoe Kerferd in that bill, and passed it through both Houses of Parliament Well, if both Houses could do this then it is a bad job for the constituencies because I think the last 1 armament stood on the whole as well for in tent and soundness of judgment as any you could get and if these men have all united together representing the whole colony to put Mr Iverfcrel on the bench and if this is a job where are will and where are we going ' (Unir, hear) Now a 106 in this instance implies one of two things either that mother judge is not needed or the person appointed to the vacancy 13 unfit for the position first, as to the additional judge not being needed those who are the habit of reading the papers regularly must have noticed in the first hit of the present year and down to August, that the press teems 1 with reflections on the Government because of the block in the Supreme Court There was a con turned outcry day after day and one of the leading papers, which does not approve of the job, H ml the existing block in the Supreme Court not only attracts but demands attention has was is late as July last, and about thutvaiysame time a deputation came to me from the bar It represented both branches of the legal profession and insisted upon the appointment of an additional judge Men like Mr Webb who was the chief speaker, Mr Purves one of the smartest practitioners we have Mr Moule a well-known senator, that two Davies, both Icatlin. hen, and Mr Duffy, a member of the Assembly-these men came to HIP law in Tub 01 in the beginning of August, and Spilsted that they could not get on without another judge The Gov- eminent never attempted to contend that there was no blood or that there was no necessity for another judge but promised, at the very beginning of the session that we would introduce a measure to better man the Supreme Court We felt a little ashamed of ourselves as being looked upon us the cause of the 1 local und resolved to put an end to it. The bill was introduced by the Attorney- General with the view to appoint seven judges to the Supreme Court four to constitute an appeal court and the other three us puisne ju Ages and a lesser number of County Court judges Hint was unfortunately brought in at a late period of the session and the changes proposed were so radical that Parliament had not time to discuss the bill which contained other important matters such as extending the jurisdiction of justices of the peace extending the time to sue for debt to the use a period under the Statute of Limitations and altering the procedure of the County Court. The latter provisions were of such an important character that one member of the House Dr Quick declared that he would not vote for the bill unless they were kept in it but in the bill as it was afterwards passed all these matters were struck out leaving only a preparation for the appointment of a sixth judge This was not done by Mr Kerferd but was done by my own direction desiring to carry out the wishes not only of Parliament but of the whole legal profession VV ell one morning one of the papers came out with the statement that there was no block at all, and that the appointment of a sixth judge was altogether unnecessary) line toll upon the G vernment hie a revelation It had been so drummed into our ears that there was a block and that it was necessary to get rid of that block However, the Assembly which had the 1 Ul before it did not choose to jump Jim Crow but simply 1 rushed at the remarks made and passed the bill When the bill reached the Council that body hesitated for a day over it and the law institute fearing the hill would not be passed I actually presented a petition pray ing that it should be pressed in the pubhcintcrest The measure was then passed by a large map city These are the facts so far as the passage of the bill is concerned As regards the appointment of a judge I have no hesitation in saying that the Government were justified in regarding that as a necessity , then the only question that remains is reg riding the appointment of Mr Kerferd There is nothing I hate regretted in political life so much as the out set is made upon a gentleman than whom no man in either I house has been so highly respected (Cheers ) He his been before the country now for 21 years and has been Alter) General for a longer time than any other man at all events as a law officer of the Crown He has been a law officer for eight years more than half the term of his 1 arba mentary queer Mr Kerferd is admittedly an apt scholar and a clever man and for eight years he has been studying law in its most diverse forms for man) legal questions come before the Attorney- General which have never come before the French or the liar The duties of the Attorney-General were far more varied, and of a much higher order than was commonly sup) posed and only a man of undoubted capacity was able to perform them (Hear hear ) It had been said that Mr Kerferd had not had much practice at the bar Well there are mail) practitioners able to win over bets from unwilling juice whom we would no more like to see on the Supreme Court bench than a certain per sonage who shall be nameless (Laughter and cheers) They were learned in the law and clever Bpeal ers but utterly in capable of performing judicial functions from the want of a judicial mind or an honest purpose general intelligence or patience all of which church tenstica belonged to Mr Kerferd in a high degree (Hear hear ) One reason vi by Mr Kerferd had not is id much court practice was that he Mr Higinbotham when he was law officer he would not take private practi- e but stuck to his official duties and the Attorney-General who did that got plenty to do, and Mr kerferd his done his work well again and again. He has had to send appeal cases home, and in every case as far as I can remember his opinion has been confirmed by the ultimate decision of the Privy Council The cases Mount Morris the Roto) its v the Harbour J I list, and the Oriental Bank failure, arc illustrations, in point The colony had 400 OOO in the hands of the Oriental Bank, and with the use of Mr Kerferd s advice and careful and astute management who recovered every penny of that money and half of the interest (Cheers ) Such a man is surely capable of giving the honest and upright decision (Cheers J I don't believe one tenth one twentieth of the people have any sympathy with the abuse that has been levelled at Mr Kerferd (Hear, hear) Law j era and merchants of high standing have said that they were disgusted at that abuse, and one of the most respected judges on the Bench voluntarily came to me and said, "I am delighted you are putting Mr Kerferd on the bench He will made an excellent judge (Cheers) Another judge remarked that he would be pleased to see Mr Kerferd appointed, adding " We know more case law than he does but he knows far more statute law than we do I mention these points to show you that the Government were not only justified in making the appointment, but we should have done grievous wrongs, having a vacancy at our disposal, wehadfuilcd to give it to the gentleman who, of all others most deserved it, and who had served the country in successive Governments with national advantage (Cheers ) It was a mistake to say the Attorney-General had appointed himself to the bench That was impossible It was a question for the Government, and especially to the Premier, to cause a new judge could not act until the Premier had signed his commissions. The Attorney-General was put on the bench by the unanimous consent of his colleagues in the Cabinet, and the all but unanimous consent of Parliament (cheers) and I venture to say that within a very short time the people will bay there never was a better judge on the bench than Air Justice Kerferd (Cheers ) I remember that about a year ago another gentleman was put on the County Court bench by the present Government some people in this country who did not care for the appointment, stated so but now it is admitted that the gentlemen who was selected is one of the best County Court judges who ever sat upon the Bench I have taken up, perhaps, longer time in dealing with this subject than I ought to have done, but as it is a job which is charged against us, the matter ought to be placed fairly before the country REASONS FOR UP TREMENs. Now baying dealt with the past, let me come to the present to the last moment the do vernment commanded the confidence of the House, and I venture to say that on the great bulk of the measures it has passed we have commanded the conti dence of the country This is the case also to a very large extent with respect to our administration The Gol comment would be fairly justified in saying that if they had gone before the country in a solid phalanx, and if they had asked the country for a renewal of its confidence in them, they would in all probability have got it, and would have come back with a sub stunt ia! majority That however, is not to be, so far as I am personally concerned When I returned to the colony, as I told you three years ago, I did not come fire with the view of entering political life the state of health of mi aged reli tive was the reason why I returned, and I therefore 1 had formed no plans for the future When I Jins suddenly pitchforked into political life I had no idea of having such a long arm of office, because ministries here are notoriously short lived I therefore looked forward to a return to England probably at the end of the present Parliament In fact, I left England a year earlier than I had intended, and I then laughingly gave a promise that I would be back: in London in the exhibition year Howey or, all these things were in the future and had not concreted, as it were, into any Bobd determination But call) in the be ginning of last session I found that the strain upon me was becoming more than I care 1 well stand, and after my budget speech in) voice went away for a month I never entered Parliament House, and from that day until now I have not attempted to make a substantial speech There may be some people who are glad to have three fine years of office, but I am one who must at work with all my soul, and if there is no work, I make it The strain of office life has probably, therefore, been more heavy upon my shoulders than it would have been upon those of many other people. The work that had to be done during the last three yours has, however, been of a charlie ter that has never been dealt with before All this foreign policy, federation, the Pacific Islands, and the convicts had to be faced, and no one on earth, except my worthy private secretary), Mr Thomas, who is now on the platform, will know the labour thatwasgonethrough in connexion with it I must say here, and I know that Mr Thomas will not be pleased to be so publicly referred to, that he has been my right hand, not only) as an amanuensis, but as an officer, to assist, consult, and suggest matters to me I therefore desire to take Una opportunity of acknow leilgmghis high merit Then I felt as the session went on, and in the state of health I then was, that it was utterly hopeless for me to attempt an election campaign That and some other things gradually brought me to in ii of up my mind to withdraw myself from public life, at all events at the on 1 of the last session, when it was found that Mr. Perry and Mr Kerferd would retire MR GILLIES 10 13s NEW LEADER. At the same time the question arose as to what was to be done The Queen a Government must be carried on until Parliament again assembled It has been said that we hate dictated to the country as to who should succeed IIB Me have done nothing of the sort M. e merely do that without which the country would have a right to dictate to us, and say that we are not doing our duty if means were not provided to carry on the business of the country until Parliament had an opportunity of expressing its opinion we were, therefore, bound, in contemplating a retirement of this sort to consider what advice we should give to His Excellency the Governor as to who should succeed us After all it depends upon the Governor as to who it shall be, and if he chooses to disagree with our advice he has a perfect right to do so that being the case, who would suggest themselves to our minds more naturally than those who have been working the ship with us all along ' Is it not something that there is one among those colleagues whose capacity is equal to that of any man in the House, who has been attentive to his duties, and who has taken part in public affairs for many) years' I ask, who else could we turn to when we nominated Mr Gillies to take the helm of the interim Minister), for of course it can be nothing else a All Ministries are interim Ministries until the) secure the endorsement of the country' Therefore, I say the Government have no right to be blamed for indicating that, in their opinion, Mr Gillies is the proper man to take the helm in Una interim fashion I will say nothing about the future, only that the Government are not doing what it in their bounden duty to do We 1 now- ill about the capacity of these men we know their policy), and that at all events while this Parliament is in existence they will not get case the policy which the country has so far endorsed Vic- leave the Must). to carry on the business in the way in which it has been carried on until the constituencies have a chance of speaking out I will go further The question of education comes up at every election, and is there anyone in the colony who is better able to carry out the national policy of education than Mr Gillies, who was himself one of the authors of the act Then, as to irrigation, which is of the greatest interest at the present time, who is a better authority than Mr Deakin ' we have an analogy in the course copied by New South Wales the other day in dealing with the same thing Vi then Sir Alexander Stuart and Mr Dalley went out of office, they handed the reins over to their colleague, Mr Dibbs (Hear ) There is no other way To have gone to the country, declared our policy, and then resigned as some have said we ought to have done, would have been undignified and unworthy of any Ministry (Cheers Jltuouldhavó been playing with and deceiving the country, and we should have been open to the charge of acting under false pretences, of having some sinister reason, or desiring to help some of our colleagues or our Slip I potters to Parliament (Hear, hear ) Such a course would not bear examination (Hear, hear ) I should like to have been able at the next general election to assist the members who have supported the Government so heartily, but we have taken to the only straightforward and manly course open to us (Cheers ) CONTINUE Till COALITION A word as to the future the question has been raised Is this coalition system of go by eminent to go on, or is it to come to an end ' It is for the country to say I have looked upon it not as a coalition, but as an amalgamation-(cheeis)-and I ask is there any thing in the interests of the country that demands that this state of things shall come to an end ' Has this coalition \- or, as I call it, amalgamation - of political parties been productive of good to the country or evil' Is it desirable we should call up the old party cries that we should try to resuscitate the evil days of the past In my opinion, and I am now going perhaps further than I ought, because I am speaking of the future, and I have no future politically but if you are going to resurrect the old parties, let me warn you that they will be only the ghosts of their former selves , way, they would be in worse than ghosts, for you will resurrect not the ghosts, but the putrid corpses of the old parties and the old cries which would be offensive to the sight, the smell, and the touch of the whole people of Victoria. (Cheers ) A row in this colony cannot benefit the country, although it may benefit a few politicians who are anxious to get into office These men will not wait to receive a portfolio in a fair way, but they look for a squall, so that they may use on the wings of the tempest into office There are always a few of these stormy petrels looking about, and they are on the rampage now, and it is a question now after having three years of quietness w 15 under the country will go back to the old state of things There is nothing in the House or country to divide the parties when the real cause of strife mises then is the time to enter into it, not when that cause does not exist I say cursed be he who stirred up strife (Cheers ) Dl.CENIRVLISAlIOX I had intended to make a few remarks upon the decentralization, but it has got so The that I am afraid that I will be unable to touch it (Cries of Good ) I will say a few words upon one or two other matters which I have prepared notes upon, as it will give others the opportunity of following and allowing whether I am right or wrong It will also indicate to what extent this question has been justified by the course which has been taken up so far as the town became the country, or the country tennis the town is concerned I do not like to see the cry raised, but, if the facts justify its being put forward then the facts are to blame, and not the persons who start it As a country member, I am therefore prepared to take up the cudgels on behalf of the country, but what struck me in connexion with the lctigiuTwus, that it seemed to me to be a ball got up platform to begin with (Cheers, and cries of 'No') 'there has been a good deal of trouble to make the platform (Cries of " No ' ) Let me tell you one or two facts I know that one gentleman went to Ballarat and declared with reference to the Electoral Bill which was thrown out that an evidence that Melbourne and the metropolitan districts were preferred to the country, was shown by the fact that our full nm. is "even new members for Melbourne and the suburbs and only three for the country. The fact really was that there were five new memoirs for the country and five for the metropolitan districts. I saw that another gentleman in Ballrratsaid that one of the planks of the league should be that the merchants in the country should have the right to possess bonded stores, it struck me as being very remarkable to me to a plank in a platform a prit allege that people had had given them for a dozen ) years. past (Cheers These and other things looked as if the league were looking for a plank. However, I have some figures here to show us that the facts are The league should have got figures to start with for it they had done so they would have been on the solid rock, and everyone could then say that he was a leagues The platform has been altered twice, it not three times I have got the platform as Imall) agreed upon at ballarat and, so far as I can see, it is one that anyone can sign and approve of, but it is so vague that I do not see what practical result can come out of it. There is only one question which has been dell miles) entered upon, and that is the matter of the workshops at Newport That is definite enough but I think that is the only definite cry the) have, and, as I told the deputation to night, they do not bring facts to bear out even that cry I shall not go into that question, but will good state treats of the expenditure during the last 10 years from all sources so far as they can be worked out It must be remembered that the present population of Melbourne is to the population of the colony in the proportion of rather more than one third On works and buildings there was expended in Melbourne during the 10 years the sum of £1,705,000, and in the country £16000 That shows apparent) that the country had not received its fair share The next item, however, is that of diamond drills, £87 000, and that was expended entirely in the country, as was also the prospecting vote of £50 000 Agricultural societies have received in the Melbourne district £7,000, and in the country is!) 1000 Tor scab prevention £80,000 was expended entirely in the country , chant This institutions, Melbourne fOl'i.OOO and country £037,000, school buildings £28 000 in town £1,070,000 in the country, maintenance of schools £873 000 in town £3 520 OOOmcountr), building of free libraries £000 000 in country' municipal giants, £122 000 in town") 211,000 in country Then, in the Mining department, £20,000 has been expended in the country in cutting tracks, Kc Country mail services cost £000,000, as against £120,000 in Melbourne. For water supply in the country £1,127,000 was expended, and for the Van Veen, £001000 The Inn Yean is paying interest on the whole of the money expended The total expenditure for Melbourne is £4,018 000 and for the country districts £12 121000, making a grand total of 217 10)000 If the town had its share, Over 139 per cent would be spent in Melbourne, whereas only 25. per cent had been spent in town, and 7, J per cent had been set out in the country The expenditure in Melbourne, therefore, fell short of its proportion li) oft r £000 000 In answer) expenditure the country has had by far the greater activity The expenditure in Melbourne it is £5 10 000 and in the country £22 10 ) 000 I here p tion was therefore 17 per cent in town and 7s per ant in the country) 10 per cent being set down to tell" stock, As.
