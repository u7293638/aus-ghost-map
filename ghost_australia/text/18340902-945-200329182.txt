Publicans' Licenses. Yesterday, the Justices met to con- sider the applications for Public-house Licenses in the Hobart Town district. There were present, Messrs. Hone, Moodie, Forster, Moriarty, Sorell, Ma- son, Gunn, and Simmons. Mr. Sorell was voted in the Chair, and the whole proceedings were open to the Public, until the arrival of the Attorney Gene- ral, who did not come in until their Wor- ships had gone alphabetically through the list down to M. Mr. Stephen, imme- diately on entering the room, moved that the Court should be cleared, on the consideration of every case requiring dis- cussion, which motion was carried. Messrs. Forster and Moriarty only voted for open doors. The Ship Inn was li- censed without any opposition. It is still a mystery for what cause the license was withheld last year. Most of the new applications were reserved for further considera- tion, and a Committee appointed to make enquiries. We were much pleased with the conduct of Captain Forster through the whole of the business, his objections were all good and reasonable. There was a good deal of discussion on the case of P. O'Mara ; we understand he is a near neighbour of our esteemed friend, Mr. Mason, and his Public-house is said to be haunted by the ghost of the wretch- ed Greenwood!! We will give the list of the Town Publicans in our next, the certificates not being issued until 12 o'clock to- day.
