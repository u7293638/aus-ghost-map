THE NOVELIST. [COPYRIGHT.] TALMUD; A Strange Narrative of Cen tral Australia. FOUNDED ON NATURAL FACTS, BY IVAN DEXTER. CHAPTER XXII.—(CONTINUED.) "Now that I was getting familiar withtheir (aces I did not have the same . repcllant or repugnant feelings towards them. When I sat down they began to converse in a language which was : even more, strange and unfamiliar to ;me than themselves. . „ , '."" It sounded more* likcThc chatter ing of Hindoos from the Himalayan slopes than anything else I can compare to it It was not, of course, possible that I should understand the words, hut the gestures which accompanied them told me I was the subject of the conversation. •_ " The bearded man motioned me to lie down, ami then his companion pro duced what I rightly took to be food. Placing a small portion of it in his mouth he handed me the remainder. It looked like ground seeds and was contained in a shallow vase of what I thought was glass, but which I after wards found was a beautiful flake-rock crystal The mixture was perfectly white and ground like flour. " I ras undoubtedly hungry, and as I ate the food the thought occurred how I could have existed so long supposing the period was as I believed since my wound—without food. The quantity given me was very large, but I eat the whole ol it and felt very much belter. " From something resembling a bottle "of white glass I took a drink of water, and afterwards the tall man gave me a small fragrant of herb, or rather he placed it close to my nose, and as I in haled the scent it had a somnolent ef fect As I dropped off to sleep my visitors departed. " When I awoke the first man whom I had seen was standing beside me, and he commenced talking in the same strange language which I had previously heard. He several times pointed to wards the spot whence he and his com panion used to enter and depart. I gathered from his actions that he was inviting me to accompany him, and sitting up on the couch I signified my willingness to do so. " I felt perfectly strong now, and was indeed glad of a little exercise. Lead ing the way like a ghost 1 saw that at the side my visitors entered and de parted there was a small exit. It was so arranged that it could not be no ticed until mostly on it From this a number of huge steps led downwards. There must have been nearly one hun dred, and when the bottom was reached an immense space stretched out " A dull light penel rated the place, though how or where it came from I did not at the time know. It seemed to me that we must have gone about four miles through winding passages and vaulted caverns sometimes down wards and as frequently ascending, when almost without warning save for a queer noise I heard we came on the shores of a great subterranean sea. I was utterly astounded at the extraordinary sight. The waters sparkled almost as if the sun were shining on them, and even to my unaccustomed cy2s vision was easy for fully a couple of miles around. " A low beach ran round the water)' expanse and the sands glittered as the slight waves rolled in ujwn them. As I afterwards saw, the beach was entirely composed of disintegrated granite and the bed of the buried sea was of the same material. The cup of my as tonishment was, however, filled when I noticed that on the sea were numerous fantastically shaped canoes—or rather boats—like Malay proas, or the canoes used by many of the South Sea islan ders. Some of these had one and others two or three occupants, who were clad in a light-fitting brownish costume." ' " When we first saw you," exclaimed Stanley, recovering from his surprise, " you were dressed in the same manner, I think!" "Yes," continued O'Mallcy, "the : garments you saw on me were similar to those I noticed worn by the boatman an the strange sea, for afterwards I spent most of my time—as befitted one lirouplit up to the sea—on the subter ranean ocean, as I called it. " I looked in vain for the opposite snores of the water, but as far as I rmild sec it stretched further stilL Walking down on the sands, my guide led the way to the nearest canoe—or rather he accompanied me towards it— for I was eager to know what its occu ]iants were doing on that buried sea. As we reached the water I instinctively filled the palm of my hand with the fluid and tasted it. Guess my surprise to find that it was perfectly fresh." "I can quite understand that If it were not for some vast underground bodies of fresh water existing on the continent how could we get our artesian supplies," Mills remarked. " But in these artesian wells the j • waters rise 'without being pumped. How do you account for that ?" inno cently asked Stanley. 11 Because the reservoir from which it flows is on a higher level, of course," come the answer. " But how can such a place as O'Mal ley describes be on a higher level than the surrounding country?" persisted Stanley. "It is quite possible," Mills replied. "The place described may be under neath a high range—or rather midway in the mount—or it may be that such exists on a slope many hundreds of miles away from the central depression of the continent If so you can under stand what the fair would bi, and how a bore sunk at the lower level would overflow if it tapped a stream which' had its source at the high level further back the slope." "Another proof of these subterranean fresh-water lakes is the fact that in some of the fe<v artesian wells yet sunk small fish have come to the surface of a sjiecies never before seen. They have been nearly white in colour and almost blind. When exposed to the action of the sun they have changed colour like a chameleon," Strangway added. " I have seen that with my own eycb,' 1 the squatter emphatically added. " When I put down the well in the horse paddock at least half-a-dozen such fish came to the surface. They were |>er fectlyblind, so far as we could see, but that would be accounted for l>y the pro bability that the narrow channel from which they travelled from the main re servoir would be quite dark. There arc a couple of them over there," he continued, pointing to two dried pisca torial specimens on" the "manilc-pieca " We had them preserved." "That btings me to a remarkable point in my narrative, and which I will detail to-raorrow," concluded O'Malley.
