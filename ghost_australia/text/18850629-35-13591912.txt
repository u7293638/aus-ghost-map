CYCLING RACE MEETING. A meeting, comprising bicycle and tricycle races, and styled an intercolonial meeting, but which can hardly be said to be so, took place on the Association Cricket Ground on Saturday afternoon, under the most favourable circum stances, both as regard weather and attendance. There must have been, at the lowest computation, about 7000 persons present to witness the very excellent programme of events prepared by the promoters, Messrs. Bennett and Wood. The grand stand and the lawn were densely crowded, there being no sitting room left in the former. The ladies mustered in strong force, and there were many very handsome toilettes to be seen on the lawn. Not the least attractive feature of the afternoon's proceedings was the excellent music discoursed by the Naval Brigade Band. A competent committee superintended the carrying out of the various events, and they merit a word of praise for the highly satisfac- tory and punctual way in which they discharged their several duties. No sports meeting could be better managed, though the parade of bicycles absorbed so much time as to prolong the preceedings until nearly dark. There was some very exciting racing, but everyone regretted that C. W. Bennett was so much out of form, and consequently did not shine so prominently as usual. In the great event of the day, viz., the Three Miles Intercolonial Handicap, he was completely outpaced by C. R. Wood, and gave up after going about two miles after Wood. Foulkes, from Vic- toria, with 200 yards start of Wood, kept ahead until the last lap, when Wood brought into force his reserve power, and, putting on a spurt, gradually passed the Victorian, and won a good race by about 15 yards. Fry also rode a good race, sur- prising everyone by the improvement he has made. The time in this, as in all the other races, was not fast, owing to the heavy nature of the turf. The most exciting contest of the day was the Sydney Five Miles Scratch Race, for all riders, C. W. Bennett and Wood exceptcd. Foulkes rode splendidly, and, stalling off every challenge that was made to him by Thurlow and Isles, eventually won by 10 yards. As each of the local riders went up to the visitor, and were unable to overtake him, there were deafening cheers from the crowd for Foulkes' plucky efforts. The One Mile Tricycle Handicap served to show how much Bennett was in want of condition, for he had not the ghost of a show with C. R. Wood, who won easily. The final heat of the Mile Handicap was productive of a wonderfully close finish between Passau. Quirk, and Watson, whoso three bicycles would have been covered by l8 inches, Passau winning by 6 inches. In that race Peers and Pearson collided with one of the flag-posts, and both re ceived a nasty shaking. The contretemps occurred during the last lap, and, but for the unlucky circumstance, no doubt they would have run first and second. The parade of cyclists is considered to have been the best witnessed in Sydney, the clever manoeuvring of the Suburban Contingent extorting the admiration of the onlookers. They were awarded the first prize, with Sydney second. Altogether there were 87 machines, out of which number the Suburban B. C. furnished 32. The meeting was a financial success.
