MR. JACOBS' NEW STORIES. "Sea Urchins" (Heincmann's Colonial Library), forwarded by Georgo Robertson and Co., is a col lection of short tales by Mr. W. W. Jacobs, whoso signature Is always welcome as flowers in May. Taken as a whole, "Sea Urchins" Is not so good a hatch as "Many Cargoes," hut some ot tho stories, which are collected generally from magazines, havo tho old sparkle of fun. "Choice Spirits," In which a sailor and hoy take their re- vongo upon a skipper who feeds his crew badly by hiding themselves in the hold, after writing a letter to say they havo committed "soolcide," la very funny. Hunger drives tho "aooleldes' out at last, much to tho eklpper's amusement, who, after somo worry, has discovered the little plot, and pretends to bcllevo Bill and Tommy ara j ghosts â€” nnd ghosts, of course, need no rations. , "Dinner?" said tho skipper, In surprise. "What : do you want dinner for?" 1 "Eat," said Bill, eyeing him reproachfully, ; "Eat?" said tho skipper. "What's the good o' giving dinnor to a ghost? Why you've got no where to put it." j By dint ot great self-control Bill smiled In a ; ghastly fashion, and patted his stomach. "All - air," said tho skipper, turning away. ; "Can we havo our clothes and things, then?" . said Bill, grinding his teeth. "Nod says as how you've got 'em." "Certainly not," said tho skipper. "I M10 'em home and glvo 'em to your next-o'-kfn. That's tho law, alnt It, Bob?" "It is," said the mate. Cutllffe Hyno's now story, "Tho Adventures ot Captain Kottlo," which comes to hand from Georgo Bell and Sons, in Georgo Robertson and j Co.'s latest parcel. Is an excellently told story ot tho rollicking, daredevil order. Captain Kettio makes an attractive hero.
