LUMINOUS PLANTS. Near Simla, in the Himalayas, the grassy hills are, during' the rain, illuminated in patches with a ; strange pallid light, which gleams tremulous as will-o'-the-wisp. It has been found to emanate from a grass whose botanical name is '"Anthisteria an- aritheia." Not every plant has this strange luminosity, perhaps one in a hundred, but even this is suffi cient to make the whole hillside glow here and there with this beau tiful phosphorescence. Another plant, also Himalayan,, the " Dictamnus fraxitella," has ah' even stranger property, for from its leaves a volatile oil is distilled in such quanti- ties that, on bringing a lighted match: near to it, the whole shrub is enveloped in a transient flame, which will in nowise injure it. On the dwarf palms of Brazil grows' a beautifully phosphores- cent fungus, whilst another Austra- lian toadstool emits a soft green light so strong that a few pieces of it will enable one to see print in a dark room. Australia also produces a luminous moss which gleams like a whole nest of glow- worms from the dark recesses of the rocks. The root of certain orchids life, wise shines when moist, and though quite lustreless when dry, renews its light as often as it is again thoroughly saturated.
