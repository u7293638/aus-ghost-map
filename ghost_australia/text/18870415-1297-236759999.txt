The amendmcn;. cm bodies a simple cxpn.-.-jjion of opinion, to the elTret, that land should con tribute il -i fair shaie to t'he revonuo of the country. We do not know how the Government, intend to Ileal this Hani: move ment. Any lone speeches in reply, however would be obvioii dy out of place, To tin; mere assertion thai property should bear its legitimate Miaiu oT taxaliou and j'Hsist, labor to provide the expense of Government, the an.r.ver is ..imply, " Who f.ai'.i it. Mwuhl not The la it pci.ii we recollect lo have heard sawnp no was Mr. Ileydori, speaking as the accredited mouth piece of t lie )ruteel iouist jiarty, of which .Mr. Gopcland hay .si nee become a. member. Mi'. Meydoii ti«ed to candidly say that llie manufacturers would never succeed in their hseai aims until 1 liny convinced llie property own- r; that it was their bt'xt policy to side with them. It was only by protection ii?lil.ii>; side by side wilh landioiTlimi he contended that it. could ;ciiu As end and put t lie whole revenue burden on the bach of Llie Woj'hinc-man. We believe that Mr. Ileyduii is presideuL of the Troteel ioni t Union t«j this duj, and if Mr. U«»pc!and, as a neophyte, will apply to him for in-! rue- lion in t h<Mu:'.v doctrines lie bus espoused, we have n-jiloubt he will lie fold that ho is promulgating downright heresy. Acconlinij to t.he hi;.jh priest, of Mr. Copcl.md'-i new political religion, a man who ai->erU that land or property should pay anything towards the expenses of Government, is a ' public plunderer" and ' stoekimr- footed burglar." Mr. Waddcll went up to liourke 1 <> ipend the Krister holdayrf in the bosom "if Ids con stituency. He lias not relumed yet, and it is not. (jiiile certain thai he ever will. Hi? has 'y)t into tlm hands of a newly-ll"d:.:<;d political party up there which has bej'uu fu catechise him on his ti.ical principle. Their second was worded as follows:-- "Are y.'U prepared to sacrilicc our native in dustries for the purpoit: of propping up the umrcantih) and shipping interests of Syil- noy y' Mis answer we arc told whs " Can didly, mi!'' I'clhaps he did not "candidly" thiul: t lint "mercantile and shippiny in terest! of Sydney" could Very well 1» propped up by merely vacriJicin;; tbc native iu'liiviri" ; of Ihuii'l'.t?. What arc the native industries of lliurke, anyhow.' Nil !5 »juei- tioii was perhaps uioic abstruse still, ruis- niu;.' as follows : — "Are y«»u of opinion tbaf. t he number of unemployed no a' walhiiry the country in a starving eoiiditinn is counterbalanced by the number of ships aud sailors employed iu our freclrude put / ' These iiimi were not joking either, they were " advancing thii cause of protection." The latter question proved to Mr. Waddell what Mr. Swivcller would cull " an inscrutable and unmitigated staggerer." Ife simply puve up the ghost, and the subsequent pro ceedings are not yet reported. Next, how ever, -we would not bo surprised if his caleohists were prepared to ask him what in his opinion would be llie political equivalent of a crystalised codfish suspended by chain lightning' from the keystone of the demo cratic arch. Whether Mr. Waddell lias come through this extraordinary ordeal dead or alive is a matter of some 'anxiety, and a feeling uf general roliefjwill be experienced on seeing him buck safely from Mourkc again. After Mr. Walker's perfonmtnee lust night tlm House had no heart left to proceed to business. Mr. ObSullivnn thou took the floor, aud amongst other things demanded Lo know " what public life iu Nuo South Wales is coming to /" What indeed ! When a financial debate at a crisis in our history consists of three "orations," one from Mr. Thomas Walker, one from Mr. ObSuliivuu und the other front Mr. Melville, it. becomes quite time to ask the electors what public life in this colony is coming to. Mr. O'. Sullivan has gut hold of a new protectionist argu ment which lias been donated to him by Mr. lUicluvnan, who tried it qu notnc years ago and found it a hopeless misfit, liore it is. Buy a plough from Kngland at and the national ledger shows a plough on the credit side and £0 on the debit sido. Now, manu facture the plough in Parramatta, and the Imlancc sheet would bo credit a plough plus £\j and debit nil. Net gain on the latter runs action £0, How is it, then, thub wo do not make the dough? No law prohibits anybody from embarking in this highly lucrative enter- prise. 1 C under these circumstances we only succeeded in producing half a plough for £L» wo would gain £11 on every one turned out. Kuvcly that is protection enough for uiiyoiic. It is loo good, however, to be true. While the men are making the £0 plough they cannot very well be doing anything else. All they produce, therefore, is £0 worth. If the plough Is worth £(i, this Is the fullest extent to which the colon)' is enriched. The money which the colony would have had tu purchase the dough had these men not been employed iu making it has not been enniud, that Is uli. A plough has been earned in stead. Tho question is : Can they produce mom by making tho plough or by producing something to exelumgo for it,' Wu do nut, of course, expeel Mr. O'SulUvuii to see this. Then came Mr. Melville. Mr. Melville posci as "an awful example" of the effects , of freetrvie. Ill-; own iiit'Hirlal enterpitee, hi say., hai been blighted by it. Hts bui;- n we under-numi, i tii.it au under- take:.
