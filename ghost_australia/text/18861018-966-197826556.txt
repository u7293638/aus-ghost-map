THE VICTORIAN AMATEUR TURP CLUB MEETING. Second Day. Melbourne. October 17. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] The sixth Caulfield Cup was decided on Saturday under most favourable circumstances. The weather was fine and bright during the morning, and the attendance must have ontnumbeied any previous record by some thousands. The promise of tine weather held out in the morning was hardly lulfilled, as it was very cold and threatening during the greater part of the afternoon, and rain fell before the last race. The racing was of a very high class throughout the day, and there was a great excitement over the Cup. The victory of Ben Bolt gives the ring the hardest knock they have had since Chester won the Derby and Cup nine years ago. From the time the weights came out the Queensland horse has been constantly backed, and the leading portion of Kelly's stable won nearly £25,000, while a few other backers won heavily, and thousands of pounds go to Queensland throngh Ben Bolt's victory. The bookmakers seem to have been just as prejudiced against Ben Bolt as they were against First Water in 1883, and their dislike to the horse must have cost them a nice sum. The public as a rule shared the unfavourable opinion of the ring regarding Ben Bolt, and did not profit by his victory, but the cheering was loud and long when O'Brien weighed in "all right." The racing began with the Selling Race, for which Honora was the first backed, but the owner of Toronto supported his horse very heavily before the start, and he went out first favourite. Honora ran well to the distance, but she could get no further, and Toronto won easily. Hortense was tbe fancied article for the Nursery Handicap, and she should have won easily, but getting off badly she failed by a head to concede the start obtained by Lady LovelL A splendid field weighed out for the Caulfield Stakes, and as Milua stripped big and well nothing else was backed with any freedom, Unfortunately for '.his backers Mr. Inglis elected to ride Malua himself, and instead of waiting and making that brilliant run for which he is so celebrated the favourite was in front half a mile from home. Isonomy challenged at the turn, and getting in front at the distance Quinn took care that Malua, who was ou the rails, should not get clear again, and Mr. Inglis ceasing to persevere at the finish Mr. Locke's horse won easily. The Nun ran well, and so did Sheet Anchor, but O'Brien was unable to get him through in time to hare a chance. Little John having been scratched at eight minutes to 11. and Maroney withdrawn on the course, the field for the Cup was reduced to eighteen. The majority looked well, and the feature of the latest betting was the ran on Britisher, who was freely backed at 5 to 1, after opening at double that price. Silver Mine kept his place as first favourite, and the_public still pinned their faith to Boolka, while of the outsideis Lesbia and The Levite were in most demand. The parade was soon got through, but they were a long time at the post owing to Millstream being so unmanageable. When the flag did fall it was to a splendid start, and passing the Stand the lot weie wonderfully well together. The fall of Jim Cane caused the field to spread out very much at the first turn, and Boolka and Bonnie Doon keeping close in, they went up the hill well clear of everything. All round the back Boolka was prominent, while a deal of use was also made of Britisher, the other favourites, Silver Mine, Recall, and Ben Bolt meanwhile keeping "a nice place at the heels of the leaders. Five furlongs from home it was all over with Boolka, and when the turn was reached _ Britisher, St. John, Levite, and Silver Mine looked like providing the winner, as Power had been hard on Recall for 2 furlongs, and Ben Bolt was some distance away. Once in a line for home Silver Mine deserted tbe Levite and went after Britisher, while O'Brien brought Ben Bolt out on the hard going in centre of the course, and went in pursuit of the leaders. Siluer Mine caught Britisher at the distance, and quickly dealing his measure, the favourite's friends thought the race won, until Ben Bolt, with his immense stride, suddenly swooped down upon _ the black, and caught him just in time to win by a short neck. There was tremendous excitement over the finish, Ben Bolt not being seen in the race until just at the finish. People at the turn say he was only seventh entering the _ straight, and O'Brien's judgment in pulling out on to the old ground probably won him the race,as the new-going, on which Silver Mine and Britisher finished, is much softer than the centre of the course. The winner was cheered again and again as he weighed in, the public appearing delighted at a horse backed for such a large stake proving successful. The Steeplechase was run at a tremendous pace, the lot keeping well together until a mile frotn home, when Contingent, Lady Carrington, and Blackthorn drew away from the others. Lady Carrington, who struck two fences very hard, was the first beaten of this trio, and Blackthorn easing up when Corrigan saw it was no use chasing Contingent, the places were filled by The Irishman and Havelock. The winner had plenty in band at the finish, and cantered borne ten lengths in front. William Tell was favourite for the Windsor Handicap, and he ran a great horse, but the weight told at the finish, and DJU Giovan beat him cleverly. The following are the particulars of the running:—= SELLIXG EACE, Of 100 sov8. The winner to be sold for £150. Special weights—2 yrs., S st.; 3 vrs., 9 st. 7 lb.; 4 yrs. and upwards, 10 st 7 lb.

Honora cut down Ariel when they entered the straight; but at the distance Toronto went to the front and won easily by nearly two lengths. Tichborne was a bad third. Time, 1 min. 42 sec.

Retort, with Sheet Anchor and leonomy following. All along the back Malua, Retort, and The Nun Nnn were WPIV prominent, tirimiinanf with u-Ifk Highland Chief and Isonomy next, but at the far U:.L turn Highland Chief and The Nun drew away, and Isonomy joined Malua. While racing alonf the bend Grace Darling became prominent. At the sod wall Highland Chief retired, and The Nun came on just clear of Grace Darling, Isonomy, and Malua, who were abreast to the turn, when Malua, on the inside, took command from Isonomy, with The Nun next well dear of Grace Darling and Sheet Anchor. Entering the straight Malua was in front, but faonomy tackled him at the distance, and after racing together for a few strides Malua cracked and left Isonomy to go on and win rather easily by three-quarters of a length. The Nun came with great run at the finish, and was only half a length from Malua, with Sheet Anchor, Grace Darling, and Huhlaud Chief next in the order named, and Retort last. Time, 2 min. J sec.

Britisher, 7 to 1 Boolka, 9 to 1 Recall, 10 tol Ben Bolt, 14 to 1 St. John, 20 to 1 each Lesbia and the Levite, 25 to 1 Millstream, 30 to 1 each Zeno, Tarpeia, and First Consul, 50 to 1 each Remus, Burrilda, Mentmore, and Jim Cain, 100 to 1 Bonnie Doon. There was a delay of ten minutes at the post, caused principally by ill temper on the tart of Millstream, while The Levite indulged in an exhibition of kicking, which caused him to be left with .a clear berth to himself. At last Millstream was placed iu the middle of the field and the signal was given to a splendid^ start. Islander, Boolka, St. John, and Levite appeared to be the first to move, and at the distance St John and Boolka on the rails, with Lesbia, Zeno, and Levite iu the centre, were the most prominent, with Britisher aud Ben Bolt clear of the others. The lot came to the Stand in very close order, find passing tbe Judge's box Zeno, Invite, Boolka, &na; St. John were dead level, an J a length behind them were First Consul, Ben Bolt, Tarpeia, Jim Cain, and BonnieDoon, while Islander was last, but there was not more than six lengths between tire whole field. Directly after this Jim Cain came down in the middle of the field, and caused a deal ot confusion, all the leaders with the exception of Boolka and Bonnie Doon running out very wide at the turn, and losing a deal of ground. Boolka led Bonnie Doon and Mentmore up the hill, the three beiDg closely attended by Britisher, with Recall and Lesbia at the head of the others, St. John, Silver Mine, and Ben Bolt being well placed at the head of the main body. Passing the miiepost Boolka on the inside was stiil to the fore, with Bonnie Doon and Mentmore at his girths, and a length off Britisher, and Recall juBt headed a ciosely packed bunch, while Tarpeia was beaten off. Along the back the colours of Bjolka were beiog carried just clear of Bonnie Doon, while Britisher had headed Mentmore, aud bshiad the Mordialloc horse came Recall and Levite, with St. John and Silver Mine next, and Bsn Bolt heading the others. At the far turn there was very little change, Boolka and Bonnie Doon leading Britisher two lengths, with Mentmore, Recall, Lsvite, and St. John next, but when they reached the 5-furlong post Boolka had dropped back, and Bonnie Doon was leading Britisher and Mentmore, with Levite, Recall, Boolka, and St. John next, while Silver Mine was moving up, the only others in the race being Remus, Lesbia, and Ben Bolt. In the next furlong Britisher joined Bonnie Doon, and at the bend Levite^ St. Jobn, and Silver Mine were following, Boolka quickly dropping behind Lesbia Recall, and Remus, while Ben Bolt had still a lot of ground to make up. Britisher was the first rounding the turn, with Bonnie Doon, who was rapidly compounding, just clear of Levite, and Silver Mine next, a ad then came St. John, followed by Recall, Lesbia, and Ben Bolt, this lot being on pretty close terms. Entering the straight Bonnie Doon and The Levite retired from the fight, and directly they got in line for home Silver Mine took second place, with St. John and Recall heading Lesbia and Ben Bolt, the latter being pulled out on the bard ground in the centre of the course. Before reaching the distance Silver Mine caught Britisher, and the Ballarat horse offering a very faint resistance to the favourite's challenge he quickly loBt his place, but Ben Bolt now came upon the scene, and passing Lesbia, St. John, aud Recall in qnick succession he caught Britisher at the beginning of the Stand, and striding along at a great pace he overhauled Silver Mine a few strides from the post, and won cleverly by a short neck. Britisher was half a length behind Silver Mine, with Recill close up fourth, Lesbia fifth, St. John sixth, Remus seventh, Boolka eighth, Levite ninth, tbe last three being Mentmore, Millstream, and Tarpeia.

When the word was given Blackthorn, Sir Samuel, and Terang together led over the first of the treble, with Irishman, Ltdy Carrington, and Havelock next, and they kept much the same order over the palings and logs. UD the hill Terang led Sir Samuel and Blackthorn, with Irishman, Brown Eagle, Lady Carrington, and Havelock next, the pace being very fast. At the back Terang, Sir Samuel, and Brown Eagle were just clear of Carrington and Blackthorn; but on the hill Carrington and Terang were leaders. The mare hit this fence, and at the sod- wall the order was Terang, Sir Samuel, Brown Eagle, Blackthorn, Lady Carrington, Lady Ashton, and Havelock, all being well together. At the treble Blackthorn and Terang were in front, but coming to the logs Lady Carrington rushed to the tore, and led them over in splendid style, Terang and Blackthorn being next, while Sir Samuel fell, and gave place to Contingent, with Irishman and Lady Ashton next. On the hill Lady Carrington and Contingent jumped together, and these two led along the back, Blackthorn, ;Havelock, and Terang following, and there was little change to the sod-wall which Carrington and Contingent jumped just clear of Blackthorn, with Havelock and Irishman next. Between here and the last fence Lady Carrington begain to fail, and she wasnearly down at the last, Contingent clearing it a length in front of Blackthorn. The latter was done with directly they landed, and Contingent went on and won by ten lengths from Irishman, while Blackthorn iiulled up and allowed Havelock third place, Lady (jarrington fifth, Moonlight sixth, Terang seventh, and Brown Eagle eighth.
