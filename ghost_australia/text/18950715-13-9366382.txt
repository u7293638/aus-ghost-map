MONDAY, JULY 15, 1895. " As the generations of leaves, so are " the generations of men the wind " earthwards pours the leaves, but the " woodlands blossom and renew them, " when the springtime reappears, so " do the generations of men renew " themselves and parish " Thus sang the poet of the old Greek heroes three thousand years ago, and still in endless succession the sons of men upon., are borne earthwards and replaced by the crowding striplings How short a time it seems since we thought of Have Yas one in the prime of life and intellectual powers, yet the subtle subaqueous flash has told of his passing away at the yet early old age of three score and ten how now remain among us of that band of master minds who made the nineteenth century enter with so pronounced a swing upon its second half Hero and there a veteran remains, not lagging behind as supernumeraries on life s stage but full of the honours of lives well spent A ItuskiN, a Si LNci R, a VIRCHOW still remind us of the intellectual fervour that awoke in the forties and gave its brilliant!) to the world in the busy fifties It is the great distinction of HUMEY to have been foremost in that band of scientific workers whose charm of literary style could carry home into the heart of the people a living interest in the truths of nature 13 vital m was but little girl told with skill of expression, SPEND R is always dry and unproductive in style, but if the one was the prophet of evolution and the other its philosopher, HUMPY WON most assuredly its fiery apostle, whose sole quence gave to its views on acceptance which the more innate force of truth would have been slow to gain He was the first and on the whole the happiest of that class of workers unknown till the present century, but including Hi WHOLE, RAYMOND, and HAECKEL, TYNDALL, CLIFFORD, and Gi IMI, who, upon a foundation of great original research, have been able to rear the airy superstructure of a finished literary style these foundations were laid by HUXLEY deeply and solidly first the most brilliant of scientific tom ses which London University offered in the forties, not the eager acceptance of assistant surgeon's position on board that slow, clumsy little frigate the Laltlemakt, which under Captain HOBSON had compiled the chart of Port Phillip long years before In 1846 it sailed away on a four years'' cruise, full of possibilities for the youngman, who from his twenty first to his twenty fifth year lived in closest intimacy with the captain, OWEN SiANLin, elder brother of Dean ISIANII Y, a noble and ardent soul, also with MACOIIIIVIIA'I, one of the greatest of ornithologists who was permitted to accompany the ship as naturalist J her life was full of discomfort, charting the Great Barrier ice off the coast of Queensland and the shores of Torres Strait, the frigate was now dead, tim clinintointo]ornblo_nndthoonly relief was the yearly trip to Sydney Harbour for I refitting During the last of those trips, BIAKLKY was found one morning dead in his berth, victim to variety, hailstorms, and climate But amid all discomforts Huxu Y had been zealously at work, dredging the sea bottom, and collecting marine life from the conti Reefs So earnestly did he play his scalpel and his microscope that the papers he was able to send to the Royal Society in London procured him on his return heaped up honours from the w 01 Id of biologist experts At six and twenty a fellow of the Royal Society, and next year its gold medallist, at eight and twenty professor of natural history at the School of Mines, and two years later accorded the additional professorship of the Royal Institution the young man who had left unknown, son of a poor assistant teacher, was now the associate of the leading men of science He and his colleague, IINDATL, were fast friends, and wrote a book together, but naturally he was more peculiarly drawn to the devotees of biology, and it was an honourable day for him when he made the acquaintance of DARWIN, then deeply respected in the inner world of experts for his many no searches DARWIN was at this time busy on the Origin of species, and his views constantly came up for debate Huxn A was by no means favourable to them. He had become a firm friend of HER nuts SPINCLR, and had suffered much preaching of evolution based on those speculative grounds which are always more than a tulle exasperating to a scientific man whose whole training and instincts bid him make absolutely certain of one step before proceeding to the next OWEN had in 1857 uncle an effort to secure the classification of man far apart from all other animals, dividing him by a huge gap from the highest apes QUALITY was busy in connection with his School of Mines lectures in compiling all the mammal types, and he had reached a den conclusion that there is no such gulf, the main differ case in sue of brain being more a detail than vital distinction HUXLEY therefore was divided in opinion, and himself tells us that when with the older naturalists he argued in favour of evolution, when with DARWIN 01 Si TNCi R no opposed it But in 1859, when the Origin of Species appealed, all this indecision was at an end IIUXLTY read it a first time, and ungraciously perceived in himself signs of conversion He read it a second and third time and was convinced there was no other theory in the field that explained the facts , this had its difficulties, but it gave to whole realms of biological knowledge a new and satisfactory meaning It was now that his great faculty of eloquent exposition became of use MURRAY, the publisher, had sent the usual copy of the book to The J Davies for review, and the editor, not having in those days a scientific man on his staff, passed it over to Lee vs, the " handy man " LUCAS had to confess that a few chapters of that amazing mass of facts and infor once earned him utterly beyond his depth, but having some acquaintance with HuxiiY, he looked into the School of Mines in Jermj n street to get a little coaching in the subject HUXLEY sug gesture that it would be easier for him to write the article, a proposal which was accepted Lucas wrote a couple of introductory paragraphs, and so a week later the English public was startled by three and a half columns of masterly delineation of D VRWIN'S loading arguments expressed SO authoritatively, so felicitously, and at times so wittily, that in a few days all educated circles in London were discussing the new views, and taking sides for and against Many went to the book itself for the sake of of controversy, who would never have opened it for the sake of truth Reams of scorn and ridicule, or actual vituperation, now began to pour on DARWIN from reviews and range Ames He was too mild a man to have any fighting proclivities lluxLii bogged Ins venerated friend to go on quietly with his work and leave the conflict to him, and for years he stood out as the champion whose sweeping weapon was to keep clear a space wherein the sick old man might pursue at peace his momentous avocation In a letter of those early times, DARWIN writes to him -"There is a most " cutting review of me in the Quarterly, " Gon knows whether my strength and spirit will last out to write a " chapter in reply I do so hate " controversy, and feel I shall do it so "badly" Hut HUXLEY relieved him of the necessity, and during a quarter of a century his eloquence, his knowledge, his dialectic skill were displayed in many a crushing rejoinder In 1860 a memorable battle was fought at the British Association meet me, when Bishop WILL theater, using all sophistical arts, insinuatingly throw discredit on the new theory Turning to HUXLI Y before an audience of a thousand people, he asked whether he (flux Y) was related to on ago on his grandfather or his grandmother s side HUXLEY replied that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his ancestor, that if there were an ancestor whom he should feel shame in recalling it would be a man of restless and versatile intellect who plunged into scientific questions with which he had no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric As the outcome of this meeting, HUXLI Y wrote for the Natural History Review a paper " On " the Zoological Relations of Man " with the Lower Animals" This he expanded two years later into his greatest work, Man's Plate in A nature, in which he gathered a crushing weight of anatomical knowledge to support his friend and for ever defeat the halting schools of OWEN and AGASSIZ from that time forward scientific books and papers, all connected with anatomy and physiology, flowed in constant succession from his busy pen But his great influence in England arose much father from his frequent magazine articles and his fine addresses delivered from time to time in the last twenty years of his life he took a profound interest in place sophy, and his account of the career and doctrines of DAVID HUME is by far the best in existence

Kitchen and Sons and Apollo Company) Limited, which has been paying dividends in these depressed times, sent a circular to its shareholders stating that they need only pay income tax on part of the sum distributed, less proportion of the profits of the company were derived from sales outside the colony As far as can be learnt the mining members intend Hupportmf. the reduction in the duty on candles to id if they cannot secure its abolition, was one of them proposes to move They recognise that if the materials used by miners can be cheapened it will lead to the development of the mining industry 'Hu Premier is anxious that the House should make quicker progress with the tariff than it has, and will accordingly ask members to forgo small businesses Wednesday, and to sit late on Thursday It is always interesting to hear about the railway finances The revenue for the past financial year from the treasurers point of view has already been explained to be Â£2 585,140 'Uns amount represents the money that has actually him paid into the Treasury, exclusive of ill 000 which has to be set aside for the Accidnet and, and embraces a portion of the earnings of the former year The returns of the actual business done during the 12 months supplied to the commissioners, show a revenue of Â£2 587 815 or 1.12,185 below their estimate of Â£2,000,00 I he working expenditure for the 11 months was Â£18 DOO less than for the corre- spondent, period of the former years, and altogether the commissioners reckon upon a saving of Â£105 000 The expenditure for 1891 I was Â£1,0.15,110 and, deducting the amount of savings, ^,5%,-il!) is brought out Comparing this amount with the revenue of Â£2,587,815 the net profit on working is found to be 6107 390 as against Â£1,000,710 for merly Making allowance for uni expended loan money to the extent of Â£1 000 000, which is deposited with the banks, the interest to be met is calculated d until SARGOOD and deducting the balance to credit the de Helene) is made out to be Â£372 000 as against Â£170 10) for 1893 4 These figures are not absolutely correct, but approximately so 1 arilT difficulties are continually upsetting the equilibrium of the Customs department. The other day the Swiss consul waited on Dr Wollaston with what looked like an octagonal shaped bottle of liquor in his hand. The worthy doctor put himself on his guard to withstand all seductive influences, and was really astonished when informed that the article in question, though hollow, was really a glass brick designed for the conStruction of conservatories He was more surprised when informed that similar bricks may boiled for the erection of dwellings of an i legune, healthy, and imperishable order 'The object of the consul a visit was to assert tain whether snell bricks, which are certainly not likely to be manufactured in the colony, could be imported from Switzerland without being olut bid by any tentacle of our octopus tariff To his disgust he found that they would have to be taxed as glassware, at the rate of 16 per cubic foot, so that their imports lion is out of the question A circular has been issued by the score tary of the Public Board, by dirt action of the French or, to the bends of the Government departments asking that in to furnish him with a list of Hit surplus officers in their departments Mr 'turner wishes to make use of the information in his Budget statement 1 life is the next beat lent to making use of the man in him Ives "Struck Oil is the keynote of a coin momentous receive by the Minister of Mines on Saturday) bearing the running of five pinions most of them have, Inrmnn narnia, one of which somewhat resemble a Stofel 'Hit discovery of mint ral oil within our territory would li a good 1 lliniL, for this colony had perhaps an unfortunate occurrence her And rica and hints Mr Foster was pi as 1 to receive the letter referred to though he was Ultima is to doubt the alleged dutton r) after reading in the At out of 1 Friday last that the Govt minent e, COLLIS of South Arm trade had reported unfavourably on it I am emollient state that they have pegged out about one square mile on the south west coast of the colony, between two and three miles from the South Australian border and adjoining lands pegged out by James Parks 'Hit) assert that on receipt of forms and instructions from the depart- incut they are prepared to pay necessary fees, and to carry out the regulations.

Open Handicap Hurdle Race, the winner of which turned up in Sylvan Prince, who was let loved home by Hippie and Pivot. In the Lawn Handicap Mr. S.

Two horses were killed in the first race, and there were several falls in the other jumping contests, but the riders in each case were not seriously injured. The Mildura Trust Hill, of the introduc- tion of which the Attorney General gave notice a fortnight ago, is likely to be postponed for some little time. The settlers and Chaffey Brothers Limited came to an agreement amongst themselves, and embodied that agreement in a bill, which they asked the Government to put through Parliament for them. The Attorney General found, on go nig carefully into the measure, that many of its clauses would, if given effect to, loosen the hold which the Government have over the Messrs Chaffey under the indenture embodying the agreement entered into between the Crown and those gentlemen when the land was granted to them 'The Messrs Chaffey ask that, in consideration of certain works being handed over to the control of the settlers, they shall be relieved from further responsibility to supply water to the areas covered by those u oils, and the settlers considering this to be a fair proposal, agreed to it. The Government, however, will not concur, as it takes away powers which the Crown now possesses under the indenture, and he contends that they ought not to weaken the indenture in answer) the Attorney General is now preparing bill incorporating all the unobjectionable clauses of the settlers' bill, giving powers to establish a trust and collect rates, but at the same time priserv nig Linnet the rights of the Crown, and leaving to Parliament the responsibility of re taxing the provisions of the indenture should it be so disposed He has informed Mr Glyde, the settlers' delegate III Melbourne, that his intentions are to assist the" settlers, preserve the rights of the Crown, and keep faith with all parties. As it will now probably be toward" the end of the car before the bill becomes law, it has been decided to renew for six months the rating clauses of the present net, so that spray irrigation can be carried on, and to await the result of the Government pro- posers 'The settlers, whilst much dump pointed at the delta, are glad to have enlisted the active aid of the Attorney-General and the assistance of the Government in adjusting their difficulties, and it is proposed to leave matters in their hands without further interference. 'The Messrs Chaffey) express their desire to do all they fairly run to bring about a settlement, provided the numerous interests which it is their duty to protect are not unduly hampered. A final settlement of all matters in dispute between the land- owners and the Messrs. Chaffey is in the interests of this promising settlement much to be desired, and is now within measurable distance of accomplishment. The Attorney General's proposal to keep faith with all parties " is certainly the right way to bring a satisfactory and permanent settlement about. The Government analyst had little trouble in making up his mind as to the unwhole- some character of a consignment of brand which was recently challenged by the Customs department, he found it largely in originated with us late, and has furnished a report stating that it is unfit for human consumption, The consignment, consisting of five cases, has therefore been banned over to the Health department for destruction. It appears that before this brandy was brought to Melbourne an attempt was made to place it on the Sydney market. It was labelled " Vintage Year- The life brand-Julia Jlour don and Co. Cognac." Rabbits may yet save the country, The secretary for Agriculture has received a letter from Mr. Herr), of the Agent General's office, stating that it is expected during the coming st mean that the price of rabbits will be from 10d. to 11d each. 'The charges for dock dues, cartage, and commission at London are about 9d. per rabbit, and to Hall or any other manufacturing provincial cities about one penny extra. Jit adds - "'there is not the slight doubt that very large trade indeed is open to Victorian rub bits in the great manufacturing districts, such as Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield, where all the members of a family work at the mills and therefore have not much time to spare for cooking (rabbits can be easily cooked, and that accordingly much lay ores by mill workers, and it is no unusual thing when rabbits are cheap for them to be the sole local meat food eaten by the family during the week," He strongly urges Victorian shippers to take a small profit in order to assist in pushing trade in rabbits in these districts. Recently Mr. R. Ann) urge, ex-MLA A. for Grant, wrote through the Premier to the Minister of Agriculture from Home, stating that he had had a conversation with several Italian gentlemen upon opening up of direct trade between Italy and Victoria. The Italian Minister of Commerce and promised to assist in developing such a trade, and Mr. Armitage added that he had been requested to have forwarded to Home samples of Victorian wool, hides, leather, wheat, i.s. Mr. Taverner has had suitable samples sent to Italy, and hopes, with Mr. Arm) urge, that it may not only lead to direct trade in wool, but in other Victorian products." Dr. Cresswell, the chairman of the Board of Health, having informed the Minister of Health that all the available ground in the Melbourne General Cemetery will be sold within the next 18 months or two years, Mr, Taverner intends visiting the proposed sites of Frankston and Blackburn for a general cemetery for the metropolis within the next few days, and will then recommend one of them to the Cabinet as the future metropolitan necropolis. Some months ago a committee of the Legislative Assembly inquired into this matter, and sug- gested that one of these sites should be adopted, the majority of the committee favouring the Frankston block, it being Crown lands, and may be connected with the Frankston rail way on an expenditure of about Â£8,000. The site at Blackburn is private land, and it would cost about Â£12,000 to purchase. After reading evidence taken by the committee the Minister is inclined towards the Frankston site, but will not come to any decision until he has inspected both. He has been informed that, should the Frankston site be determined on, a portion of the Â£30,000 which the trustees of the Melbourne General Cemetery have in hand could be utilised in erecting a fence round the land and laying out the ground, while the Government couldI set men to work making the branch railway. the Minister of Agriculture has written to the managers of several of the leading butter and cheese factories stating that the s a Menmuir will leave for China and Japan during the second week of next month, and, having a cool chamber, will be prepared to rain ama!! consignments of dairy produce to test the markets of the Mass. It is also the dean of Mr Taverner that a trial shipment of a few live stock should he made to Japan at the same time, and he is in communication with some of the Black and station agents with the view to arranging for a con RiMimcnt of ten or twelve head of cattle The freight on farm) produce will be Iel, per lb It has frequently happened when land has been thrown open for selection the applies lions for it recommended, and the survey fees paid, that the mining boards raise objections to its alienation (generally one of the results in such raises is that the survey fees, which the department hands over to the surveyors, not lost to the applicants, who necessarily) complain at losing both the prospective fund and the fines us well 'lite Minister of Mines with the object of alley lifting the trouble, has set, gi sled to the Minister of Lands that in (nature and number of (hemming board Iromtlielotahty should be ex- chew a member of the Inn I heard, so that if there are any mining objections to urge against the ultima tion of the land they will be made at the land board I of in mi) applications an recommended Mr loafer has also suggested that the municipality in which the land is situated should be communicated with and round of the sitting of the land I em rd, so that a municipal officer could attend and Billinudgel irons on behalf the council a li) the land should not be dispuse 1 of 'the Hawthorn railway station presents a seem of 1 may activity of tin [rea nttime. ext nsw e alterations having been coming need by noting of workmen As the station so far as the service to t Camberwell is concerned, has in the past been a semi terminal on, three lines of rails have been laid down alongside the island platform but for the future only three It trains are to be run to ( tinioerivell, so that the set of rails used for shunting mains will not here street Hits sit as to lit removed and the island platform interest On th Ki W line a local service is to be introduced during the greater portion of the du) loane unhinge, and kew pussy ugi rs i x pt at the busy periods when through trains to Kew will is run, will have to change trains at Hawthorn line in order to do away with thciieeissit) of tin signal box at Picnic by tion windiwnsnccessirv topreventaetidenta between the Camberwell and Kew trains when the latter in the main line, what is known as a double junction is to he constructed at the line The station by this means, when the points are set for a Kew train to join the up line to Mel (bourne m) risk of a (Ja in to quell tram on the down the cutting into it will be avoid ed by the latter being turned on to a st put it, in At present ( and tram II trams an often blocked at the picnic station waiting for Kew trains to get on to the main line at 1 tin new or continent will avoid such things in the I future, at the same time providing,;
