"When Xi became' her." friend Ir was fifteen years old. I lived in Eontgrane. Every day I went to the parsonage to take a lesson hr L atin from the Abbe Bestourbes. The Abbe "was a kindly teacher, a lover of VngiL whom he: re- cited "wijjji devout intonations,' like a prayer. Irma, his housekeeper, adored me, and would haye made" Tue eat or drink every hour pf the day. As to the parsonage, an ancient building, whose .walk; dated from the Roman epoch, it was, with its ruined arches and ite"thick -walls, a delightful retreats- cool, in sum- mer and warni in winter, and always perfumed with an odour of incense and of wax. _ ' r~ But what Vas best in the parsonage was - Lizotte - Lizotte Deátourbés-;tne little niece or the Abbe,'the daughter of the Destourbés of Agen-he who kept at the corner an important establishment of fruits and candies. Lizotte was seine months older than I. She loved fun like a child, and none the less did not disdain from time to time' te play the lady, a> she paced "along the' sidewise on Sun- days, attracting much attention from' the young fellows.

The Church of Fohtgrane had taken on the special holiday aspect of the "season. The crucifix, the pictures, the devotional .statues were covered^ with violet serge, yet this semi-mourning bad nothing saddening about it-in the first place, because outside the joyous spring- tide was already announcing its triumph ; and, second, because the coming Feast bf the Redemption illumines with hope" even the sad days that precede it. .. , Lizotte'and-I were enjoying a holiday on the plea that we had to attend to the decorations.i \ I dined pleasantly enough. i.

That evening was deUcibus and' temblé. .Masters bf the parsonage and of the church; as tvie were,.and familiar with every recess and corner, we could'walk around in the utter , darknes . without danger of a misstep. Such was the strange diversion which Lizotte deter- mined upon. Taking' me by the hand, she drew nie into thé interminable Tvind lpg corridors pf the house, then intó the ; cool solitude pf theäiaye. She whispered into my ear "' at the'' same timé" awful' ^tories bf ghosts', whose fatoiii'ite'seasonJ as is weU:kuowu,' is Holv Week " for[_ en- : joying.thenlselves in consecratedAspóte.'.' ! Suddenly'she hurst oiit into1 song, her fresh -young 'voice accentuating ' the Vowels in* the Languedoc fashion. But when she ceased the church answered fcp her voice in such horrible : TeverbbratoiyEchoes' * that we madly i fled back through thé sacristy and. the [ long winding corridors to .the dining room of .the parsonage, where we fell into chairs, affrighted aud laughing at our fright. ? ?"' - ? Then, as the Abbe De3tourbés did not return, Lizotte enumerated to me ali the presents she Lad received on her birth- day, which, fell that year on* Palm Sun- day-what her father had given her, and what her Uncle Dalidou, and ber Aunt Combes, and-Mme. de.B.ancagnas, whose daughter was, studying. with. her the Catechism of Perseverance. Every time the creaking of some of the ancient woodwork gave me a thrill, or one of the mysterious sounds that occasionally issued from the neighbouring chui*eh startled me, Lizotte would pinch my arm tb recall me to reality At.last, the sub-, ject of presents having been exhausted, my little friend, who was never, taken unawares, and never suffered from a scarcity of ideas, rose from her chair and went on tiptoe to open the buffet of the; dining-room ;, She drew from it a box .of ..white wood, which she laid Cautiously on .the table. >. ~ This box was a present-which. Lizotte had brought from..jbestouvbéi d'Agen to , his brother; the cure. A hundred pf che finest prunps,wer&aiTanged.-side; by side in layers of twenty, «pou beds of laced palier-.... -Xípu must not . forget, that Agenais is paivexcellenee ia the. country pf prunes. ..

After the harvest, which takes place in August, they-are stewed, they" are put. away iu boxes, andéheve^'axe your prunes ready for the whole year. The prunes which Lizotte had brought.were phenomenal ones, large;/meaty, bursting with juice, . and lusfe'ous and perfumed. He who i has jost seen " such primes has seen 1 hotíbing;' The' girl' was .right : in the ,pride with which ¿he. displayed these ; products , of *thi¿ 'patél'naí business? As to toéyl should.haye wished to. com-oare ,ttHeir taste; >t: ' once"- ' with .' theL fine appearance.",' Btgfc alasTrtUe' 'slightest theft,'"would be eksy to;" discover The' prunes / fitted"in one against the other .like the^tbnes in a mosaic, and (doubt- less because such luxuries were inter dieted in Holy Week) the Abbé had not yet touched them. After a long and contemplative silence Lizotte said ? " --. " If I let you taste one of these prunes " what would you say ?" I readily acknowledged that^the ex- periment would be very agreeable to me. The little minx made that gesture which signifies in every language " Wait a moment*-don't stir." She delicately lifted out of ' the box, first, the upper layer of prunes, then the second, each in its bed pf paper, took a prune from the third* carefully replaced the two layers that she bad taken out, then closed the box and put it back in the buffet. All these manoeuvres were executed with an ease, a perfect mastery, which filled me with admiration. But now Lizotte had returned to me, holding between to fingers the stolen Erune. She began by appropriating to. erself at one bite the exact naif pf the This seemed to me entirely equitable. Then, just as people offer sugar to a lap- dog, ene tendered nie the other half m her red finger-tips, amusing herself by withdrawing iff as soon as I approached my mouth to the moi'sel. A pretty game! My lips caught with- out retaining sometimes her.naUs, some- times her brown fingers, and sometimes the fist of my little friend ; " .". and how" shall.say .iii .

Sheepishly I picked 'up' the sacred objects, the Holy 'yirgins,- the "Saint Josephè, "and replaced them Iii the; breviary.
