:?:?: OUR; MELBOURNE LETTER -. -:;? .! (From our 'own 'Corresp'ondeiit.S ^'- ?'- ?: ????? ? '?? ?'??' ' ?'' Melbourne. Juno 23; '?'?' The political crisis has been averted ; indeed Mr.' Berry has very aptly described the recent difference of opinion ; between Mr. Francis' and Sir Bryan O'Loghlen ' aa 'a duel fought with blank cartridges.' Up to : thevery .moment that' the House ?-auw. ? u*»' j. uuuuuj ? AWOKj IV TTCtO till bLUlfJtHjOU that Ministers would-remaih firm in the position i that : they' had taken up, and would. refuse to: view the amendment pro1 posedby the hon. member for Warrnam bool in any other light than that of a direct want of confidence resolution. These anticipations, however, proved in correct, for when the House met the Speaker unexpectedly came to the rescue ot the Cabinet, and ? Ministers gladly availed themselves of his assistance. Mr. Lalor ruled that the amendment should bejitaken in committee, and a debate on.' this question occupied the- hon. members until the refreshment hour. Before the House assembled again the Premier and Mr. Francis met in the Ministerial rooiri, and when the debate was resumed the' member for Warrnambool agreed to accept the Speaker's suggestion, and, Sir Bryan intimated that in that case Ministers' would not regard the motion1 as an un friendly i ' : one. . These announcements were hailed with satisfaction by : a large1 number of members,! but disappointment was visible on- the- countenances of the baulked office seekers who occupy the' front opposition benblies^and ^section of the Consitutional'party do -not seem sat isfied .with the unexpected termination of the crisis.-,' The .-actual-result of -the- nego tiations I have mentioned is that the Go vernment .will riot propose ?'? the remission ' of duty, on tea;, they will bring in apostal 'bi]JJ;to;reduco the rate to^theld standard,1 but the: reduction- will r not take effect until the lst:Julyyrl883,.-:so' that: -the1 fi nancesof the year will notbe interfered with ; the tobacco duty, which expire3 on the 31st.prdx.,'\wilLbe continued1 as a jjaiiiiiiiioub; jiupuat, ? uuc me aucy on. ? oeer, which expires'.on ithe .'same date, will- be [allowed to Ilap'se; ! i ?

'?; But: those,::i who :ihaveV- observed- ': the recent^.shameless 'scramble^ '.'for'1 bftice, and who . have unfortunately' 'been obliged. : to ./witness'- i-th'e-'! most disgraceful scenes that havo1' boon enacted in the Assembly 'during, the 'past- -week, must bq! convinced that the;Asse'mbly: has outlived its season of usefulness,-- :and:that responsible government ih' its' true sense is not atpresent enjoyed iin! ViotPria. It is ih the .utter obliteration'-of -o'lil party lines and the subdivision of the recognised sections of the House .? that ^Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's real1 ?security. ? rests. At present we have -five or six parties in a House of 86, i members. . There- is the Francis party, the remnant of the old Constitutional section... , .There is the Gillies party^small, compact, and clever. There is the Kerf erd party, fierce, and irreconcilable, and ? dreadfully hungry for office; ? ! There is -the- 'Berry party, quite out in the coldj. ? and consequently moodyj. and grumbling. ? Arid . finally there is the Mason-Oum- Woods party; the party of ^reconstruction, the virgin spirit of Loyal Liberalism, the coming: tornado; Under such' circumstances1 1 -think that the Premier has acted wisely in1 departing from the ethics of party rules, evidencing a spirit of, concession 'and -recognising his duty to the community as a higher object than could be obtained' by any parliamen-' tary victory.': ?? , Discontented ^members appear determined- to' hamper the Premier at. every -turn; and' unless1 some1 wonderful ' change comes o'er theiscenej the;- preterit session islikely toioutdo all;itB'predeces-' sbirsin political'larrikihism'i 'C' ''-i'!'^' .; ; iOne of the' most' lextraordinary'' con-' tributionS' to vTuesday ?. evening's'' deba'te' was;the;speech ofSir'-CharlesMacMahbrij. the ex-Speaker. -Violent mlitsHone,::arid; displaying 'persoriali'bitterriess-Yassailiijg alike ^Minister's' and 'the ?pleader'' 'of ?'?

An endeavour is being made to start an -entirely, new ,, political party which shale set aside old lines and old lenders and be known as the Victorian party. Mr. Hickmati Molesworth, the well known barrister, is likely to oppose Mr. Lorigmore for Ripon and Hampden at tho next general election. I do not forget that I am writing to you on- the anniversary of tho settlement of Tasmania by Lieut. Bowen in 1803. It has hflnn fcrnlv stntnrl t,1in.li Tusmimin. ia the garden of Australia — the Italy of the Colonies j and I have before mo one simple passage from the work of a well known author which fittingly expresses all that I could desire to say of the land 1 lovo so woll: — 'It is the Capna of tho Australias. Tasmania will never become a second Rome, but it will occupy the same relation to the other colonies as Pompeii and Buitu did to tho Italian mo ; Sir Charles MacMalion advocates tho introduction . of the South Australian Bystem, under which members accepting office are not obliged to seek ru- olection. The Knight points out that the best men are not selected for Ministers nowadays, because it is necessary that those should be -. chosen whoso re-election is certain. There is some. truth in this statement, but still I should bo sorry to see the pre lont system altored. If we are to; havo jovernriiont by the people, it is only right ind proper, thattho electors should -have idirect voice in tho selection of Ministers, ind be able if: necessary to vendor void an ippointment which, . however advan ageous it might be to a party, would ibo prejudicial,to:the public good. i-Bryant, alias 'De 'Beaumont, has been jom'mitted for- trial, .upon -a chargo of Eorging and.'Uttering a cheque signed D. ? 3yme arid-Go; ?

He. speaks of,' his own dear Lizzie,' whom: he describes as---'-the clearest creature upon earth.' Oh woman, woman, was there ever, a swindle or deception in which you did not take a prominent part ! I have no doubt that much; of tho money that was obtained from confiding tradesmen was lavished on this angelic Lizzie. , . News from Glenro wan and the Benalla end of the Mitta Mitta valley, known as the.

It isiawith rdeep:f regret1; that -I-have to record; ,the'dea'th of- Mr.t Richard 'Armesley Billing, .^Q.G^Ji.orie'-.'off.tKe'imost'distin-' guishedhmembers: of'-'theiKVictorian bar; ! who 'has just; completed- his first circuit as' a.Cpunty Court judge., ; -Mr. Billing, who was 68 years of ;age, returned to town, on tho Thursday before last,' much exhausted by: continuous travelling' in tho western district. : ; He was seized with a fit of serious apoplexy on the following day,; and tin's was followed by paralysis. His Honor died the night before last. Mr. Billing never took any part in politics, but ho was .for many yttars law lecturer to the Melbourne University, and was engaged in some of tho most important Jaw cases tried in this colony. Gordon tells us that ' the sea is wanton, the sea is wilful,' and a sad vorilication of these words came to Melbourne yesterday. The ship ' Black wall was towed into Hobson's Bay dismasted, bringing with .her two men named Geo. Williams and D. M'Dermott, of lhe wrecked ship Bul wark. Whon thoy wore jjicked up they had been nine day.i in one of tho ship's boats. Thoy woro in a dreadful con dition, their legs being so much swollen, that their clothes had to bo cut oil'. One of these men brings a lettor from the second officer (who w«s su ill that ho was confined to his bunk whon the bulwark wont down) to his mother in England. The faintly traced lines would bring t. ars. to tho eyes of the possessor of tho stoutest heart, but it'evid^ncea with what resignation and calmness tho British sailor can face death. The libel case of Dowie v. Walker was tried at the County Court yesterday, and caused no little oxciteniont. Tho plaintiff is a minister of religion, and the defend ant is lecturor to tho Victorian Association of Spiritualists. Damages wore laid at £350. Tho cause of action was an advor tisemont containod in this Aye and Daily Teleyraph of the 22nd April, last Mr. Turors was employed by Mr. Walker, and this in itself was sufficient guarantee that the case would be a spicy one. After hearing a quantity of the evidence, the Judge suggested that the action should be withdrawn, and this course was adopted, each party paying' their own. cos's. And now one word with regard to Mr. Thomas, Walker's Free Thought Lectures at the' Opera House. I have never professed to' belong to' the '' Goody goody' school, but I confess I was shocked to see at 'one of these free lectures a large number of young women of an Impressionable age, and little children, too, listening to an oration in which the Saviour was spoken of 'with' levity, his miracles' burlesqued, and that good old book, which after all is the safety valve of society, ridiculed. Earnest and conscientious Mr. Walker may be, but I wonder if he ever thinks of the responsibility he incurs. To buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest is said to be the secret of successful trading, and there is an in dividualin Melbourne, who certainly has implicit faith in this axiom, though the mariner in which he practices it is slightly open to question^ For some weoks past residents in the suburbs have complained of extensive robberies from their gardens and hen roosts, and the tracks of a horse have been plainly discerned close to their premises. These thefts have always taken place prior to market day, and thero is little doubt that this entorprising wader, taking one suburb ac a time, quietly goes roundand fills his cart and drives into tho market arid disposes of the plunder. The detectives would like to know his ad dress. It has been estimated that, tho amount that the Kelly Gang robbed in Victoria was £4000, and most of this was paid away as hush money. The money for the outlaws' defence was obtained by sel ling the houses- of the family. I told you in my last that the leases of the Royal and Princess's Theatro had ? been secured by Messrs. Williamson, Garner,; and Musgrove, and the monopoly thus' established is viewed1 with some ap preciation' The ?' Black Flag' is the last standard thatwill be hoisted at the R'iyal by Coppin and Co.
