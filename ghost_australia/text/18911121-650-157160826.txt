NEWBRIDGE NOTES. This evening quite a gloom was spread over Newbridge by the death of Peter McGuire, a fettler on the line. The gang was working in the station yard some time before, and poor Peter was in great humor, bandying jokes with those near him. He was suddenly attacked with a fit of coughing, which caused a flow of blood. Little notice was taken of it till he was heard to make the remark, ' My God ! have I burst a blood vessel?' Immediately he stag- gered into the arms of a person close by, aud it soon became apparent that he had 'yielded up the ghost.' He was a married man, and leaves a wife and three young children to mourn their loss. Deservedly popular was poor Peter, and greatly will his win- ning smile and good-natured joke be missed. In fact, he was a general favorite, all friends and no enemies. He was a Good Templar, and took great interest in the works of the lodge here, which can ill-afford to lose the services of such a sturdy member. Influenza is still raging, but not very seriously. The weather has broken, and to-hight tliere is every appearance of a heavy downfall of rain. November 19.
