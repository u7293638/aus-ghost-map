NEW SOUTH WALES. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) SYDNEY, Nov. 20. We have not yet learned to imitate the Victorian plan of having all the elections on one day, and the consequence is that we are undergoing a prolonged excitement It is perhaps one advantage of our system that we get, with the aid of the telegraph, a general inspection of the view a of the candidates who are on each day posing before the public, and the decision of the electors upon them So far as the elections have gone hitherto the Government cannot be said to have met with any enemies, no pronounced opponent having been returned In fact the East Sydney election is the only one that has as yet had any defi nite political significance and this was in consequence of the determined attempt the Catholics made either to throw Sir Henry Parkes out, or, at any rate, to put him lowest on the bat of successful candidates If he had stayed at Canterbury there would not have been the ghost of a chance against him but it was known that he wished to we pipe out his former defeat at East Sydney, and to get from that constituency a repentance election 'Hub gave the Catholics just the chance they wanted they are pretty strong in East Sydney, and they resolved upon an organised attempt to wound his pride To have put up a Catholic candidate, and to have plumped for him, would not have answered the purpose first, because it was doubtful whether he would have got in, and he would not unless he had been a man sufficiently popular on other grounds to catch a great many Protestant votes and secondly, because, even if he did retain, this waste of the Catholic vote over one man would have allowed Sir Henry Parkes to have secured the pride of place at the head of the poll It was resolved, therefore, to give up all idea of plumping The four most popular candidates next to Sir Henry Parkes were chosen, and the Catholics were instructed to vote for these four, who were Messrs Renwick, Reid, Dangar, and Roberts There was a little hitch in the arrangement, as some were either pledged or determined to vote for Alderman Moore But in the main the voting went as ordered, and being a solid vote of about a thousand, the plan was very effective These four candidates were of course, lifted relatively to Sir Henry Parkes it was impossible for his select friends, who had got an inkling of the in structions issued from St Mary a to meet the attack otherwise than by plumping, and this course was adopted, especially in the morning But for this be would probably have been thrown out, and, as it was, he was onlyfourthonthepoll Ofcouraeitwoswound ing to the pride of the Premier to be put so low down, and only to beat by 500 votes a corner public house man It was especially unpleasant, considering that he was appealing to his old constituents to make the amende honorable , but, of course the greater the wound to his feelings the greater the pleasure to those who had laid the plot Both sides profess gratification the Premier at having beaten his enemies in spite of the worst they could do, and they at having deprived him of the wished for pleasure of boasting of his entire rehabilitation in the affections of his old constituency The fight however, has for the time more widely than ever alienated the Premier from the priests He had often had the Catholic vote on previous occasions, or a good part of it, but if ever he gets it again there will have to be a good deal of forgiveness, or else a very strong motive to pretend to it. The election for the new constituency of South Sydney had no political significance at all, and was mainly an aldermen s struggle for legislative position Three of them got in, and the electors chose also one plain, sensible man, who is not an alderman, and who has been a contractor The West Sydney election will have some interest in connexion with the protectionist controversy, because Mr David Buchanan, the new convert to protection, has left Mudgee to court the electors of West Sydney, which, as a treat working man's constituency, is supposed to be a stronghold of protection The working classes, however, are very much divided on this matter A good many of them see that the colony has been under mably prosperous under its free trade iLgime, far more so than Victoria has under the opposite policy In fact, it is a very common remark that the free trade cause in this colony owes a good deal to Victoria having worked out the fiscal problem before us Mr A Cameron, who is a working man's candidate, avows himself a freetrader, but while leaving private per- sons free to go to the cheapest market, urges that Government should not do so, but should get its own work done in the colony A great many of the working men and most of the candidates have fallen in with this programme, and their cry is, let trade and commerce be free, but let the Government encourage local production by giving its own orders for colonial work The freetraders are quite willing to unite in this demand on the ground that the action of the Government does not hamper the action of private buyers and sellers at [We have since heard by telegraph that Mr Buchanan was defeated, and that two absolute freetraders and two candidates of Mr Cameron's views were elected ] At Balmain, Mr Garrard, a working man's protectionist, has been elected, for the iron trades lean a good deal towards protection, and they are in force at Balmain, in which suburb Mort's dry dock is situated Mr Sutherland, the ex Minister for Works, who has been returned for Redfern, is also a protectionist, but at present their number is very small, and the general preference for a free trade policy is beyond all dispute The elections hitherto have been remark- as)) orderly), and there has not even been much personality The Catholic candidates have all avowed their acquiescence in the Education Act, and it is now beginning to be understood that they do not wish to interfere with the present law, but to supplement it by another, giving payment by results They are disposed to surrender the idea of denominational schools of the old type, which were subject to state regulations into which they had to admit Protestant children, and in which, accordingly, they had to relegate the religious teaching to fixed hours and they are going to give their preference to exclusively Catholic schools, for which they propose to demand payment by results The) will leave the national system to stand as it is, but they will set up their church system side by side with it, and they will ask that the state shall pay them for their work. This will somewhat shift the form of the controversy, though not its essence. Sydney was all ready to burst out with bunting and blue ribbons if Trickett had won, and the news of his defeat was dismally depressing He himself had been confident of success, and had persuaded his friends to back him, which they had done pretty heavily Colonial enthusiasm had indeed tempted many people to bet altogether beyond their means, and I have heard several instances which seemed little short of a. mild form of insanity. Of course Trickett has been abused his well as pitied by many of the sufferers, but all who know him best believe that he has rowed a thoroughly honest race, but that he was overmatched, The late arbitration between the coal miners at Newcastle and their masters has not settled all differences, for there is a dispute now as to what the arbitration award means The masters have tendered the back money due under the award, and the miners say that the award gave them more The master,) propose to refer the dispute to the arbitrators, and to ask them to state more precisely what they did mean , but to this the men demur Meanwhile the A A. Company a miners have managed to get up a separate quarrel They laid the pit idle for a day to attend a mass meeting, in spite of the refusal of the manager to grant the holiday The consequence was that when they came back they found the pit locked against them This matter however is likely to be adjusted to day by a better mutual understanding for the future The Wallsend Company's miners too were fined by the manager is a ton on the business lost by the company during the day on which the men knocked off work without notice They refuse to pay so that is another little quarrel added to the list
