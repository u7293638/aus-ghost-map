THE SEASON AT OSTEND. I should think that the journey by express from Mechlin to Ostend is, at this time of year, about the most unpleasant bit of railway travelling in Europe. The heat is something to remember. The unhappy voyagers are mercilessly packed together, eight in a compartment, like freshly caught Borioboolans in the hold of a slave dhow ; the train, from the moment of its departure till within a few hundred yards of the terminus, is enveloped in dense, blinding clouds of dust ; there is nothing to drink save warm local beer in the intermediate stations (the use of ice appears to be unknown in the interior of Belgium's peach costs sevenpence, tsvopenno'rth of which is dust ; if you keep the windows closed, you may die either from apoplexy or suffocation; if you keep them open, you are buried under a simeon of sand, which fills your eyes, nose, ears, mouth, lungs, boots, and breeches pockets in rather less than a minute, re- duces you to a condition of gasping despair, and makes you have your neighbor as yourself. Supposing you make up your mind to endure the dust plague for the sake of the draught (which, however, brings but little solace for the air itself is feverishly hot), by the time you arrive at your destination you are so thoroughly dis- guised not in liquor, oh no ! you wish you were, for then, perhaps, you would be less keenly conscious of your miseries-in dust, that your nearest creditor would not know you. You might pass fearlessly under the searching glance of your mother-in-law without fear of recognition. For your face, hands, garments, and temper are as black as Erebus ; your tongue is furred, your throat parched, your skin violently irritated ; you can't bear the thought of looking after your luggage : " Confound the luggage I want my tub and a brandy seltzer !" You are snappish with the inspector of baggage, and vicious with the porter and if an angel were to come down from the realms of bliss in order to offer you a pass ticket through St. Peter's wicket, you would probably make a very unpleasant remark about the apostolic gatekeeper, and send the angel to the day for a tout. Your torments, too, have been seriously aggravated by the inconsiderate conduct of your fellow travellers, who, instead of bearing their miseries as you, a true Englishman, bear yours, in gloomy silence, have been, for the last forty miles, incessantly bewailing their hard lot in French, German, Flemish, and Walloon the last two idioms being peculiarly offensive to you, because you do not understand a word of either. Flemish is, I believe, a regular, out-and-out, written language ; it sounds like drunken Dutch, and is full of such terminations as " silk," " pluck," and " sloop," flowing and euphonious. Walloon is not a language, so far as I can gather; it is not written, and, when spoken, resembles no other arrangement of sounds that I have ever heard out of a farm-yard. It is the sort of tongue that Swift might have invented for the people of one of his newly-discovered countries. Or I can imagine it to he the common language, or lingua Franca, of the animal kingdom the mutually intelligible jargon in which a crew and a dynamo, for instance, would chat together, if they met by a state on a sum- iller afternoon. It has been asserted that the Prince of Darkness understands Latin, and I am far from doubting the fact ; but I think he would find Walloon a teaser, with all his learning. I asked an intelligent Belgian, in the interval between two peaches and a ham sandwich, whether any- body not to the manner born ever learnt Walloon, and his answer was pretty conclusive. " It is a dialect, monsieur, that you can never acquire and when you have acquired it, it is not worth knowing." I *' There must surely have been a dash of Irish blood in my Belgian fellow-travellers j veins. Walloon is said to consist mainly of old French-very old French, indeed, I should say, of the Pepin period at the very latest. You should have seen the face of a portly Frenchman, " voyaging for his pleasure," and proud of his nationality, when some one let fall the assertion in question, Walloon being at that very moment spoken with distressing rapidity at the farther end of the carriage. He raised his eyebrows to where the roots of his hair ought to have been (and probably were some years ago), listened attentively for a minute or two to the extraordinary gibberish alleged to be the ancient tongue of his " belle France," and then, leaning over towards the person who had imprudently made a statement to that effect, remarked, " Monsieur, I pray you to observe that I seek not to impeach the value and correctness of your information ; but me, I am a Frenchman, do you see and I give you my word of honor, the most sacred, that, in that intolerable jargon which one speaks over there, there is not one word, not one single word, monsieur, which has any detectable affinity with that beautiful language which makes the joy of every cultivated mind. Pardon, monsieur, that I address you the word. Poof! quaile chaffeur abominable " The man thus in- perpetrated was too much overcome by the dust to defend his original assertion, and so the French gentleman sat back, panting, but pleasantly conscious of having settled the question. At last the cruel journey was over and done. The big omnibus of the Fontaine, paragon of seaside hotels, had rattled us rapidly through the long narrow streets of the old town there was a proud and 'haughty count with us, by the way, so utterly subdued by the horrors of the state railway that he meekly allowed his servant to stuff him into a corner of the plebeian conveyance, as though he had been a common mortal-and presently we were discharged at a friendly portal, gaily lighted up, and lined with fresh flowers, where M.r, whose jolly countenance bears promise of comfort and good cheer, received us with cheerful sympathy, and proceeded to anticipate our wants with the kindly promptitude of a good Samaritan. Here the count plucked up a little spirit, and tried to assert himself ; but it was only a patrician flash in the pan and I beheld him swept upstairs between a waiter and a portmanteau, in a manner as unceremonious as you please. I crave permission to draw a veil over the capture of the next half hour. It is my intention, at some future time, to write an ode to the tub yo which received my aching limbs, and to immortalise a certain cool drink that shall be nameless in a series of essays But let that pass All I know is, that when the work of restoration had been changed, and I strolled out on the magnificent esplanade before the Kui said, looking far, far away over the calm moonlit sea, a great peace and contentment came over me, and I was too thankful for the great joy of once more contemplating the mighty regene water to remember the tortures I had en dined in traversing the land of the same Lion The bathing here is about the lu chest thing out, and the beach of a morning i refreshing and instructs e sight I would not counsel persons of pi udish nature to contemplate the daily exhibition is in a plate and yet I don't know people of that sort generally enjoy anything verging on the delicate rather more keenly than poisons of mere average morality The fact is, that there is very little nine indeed about the fair habitations of Ostend beach, and the Mother 01 more handsomely formed they are the less pat ticular are they to a nuance notes less of liberality in the exposure of their chaims Men and women, children and nursemaids all bathe together in the same precincts swimming, bobbing floating dancing, and otherwise disporting themselves in company and, whilst the costume supplied to men is all that the most rigid decency could exact, that worn by the majority of the ladies is, if I may say so, full of incident The chief characteristic of the best looking girls and young married ladies here whilst in the water, is-not to put too fine a point upon it-a naive carelessness about sitings Buttons are not so much buttoned as they might be but stunsail, in nine cases out of ten, left untied The effect is pleasing to the philosophical spectator and I should like a few of those some gentlemen who criticise modern humanity and manuel in so Bcntliing a way, and who bitterly assDittlmtw woman now a days is a creation of the milliner, sailmaker, and chignon main pictures, to come and bathe for a few days at Ostend If they did not see a good deal that is real genuine and natural-not to say exuberant-I should be considerably surprised There is a small ship of sea, some distance from the promenade that is worn 8 to 19 like a sea nymph s haunt Aston float by it 01 swim through it, white arms and feet flush by you, of the long, dipping han of some laughing girl sweeps your shoulder, you feel like Actaeon, over whom, however, you have the twofold ad s anl√§ge-fiistl}, that you are not changed into anything particular by a goddess s width, and, secondly, that the lovely bathers do not vanish or dispose at join appi once I saw an entirely new method of water locomotion put in practice this morning names, one of the most beautiful gems in Europe floating on her back and being pulled along the surface of the water by what do you think?

the throne of Peter and therefore have been advanced to the supreme government of the whole Catholic Church and to its administration which has been entrusted to us in Divine fashion by Christ Himself, our orders have judged it fitting to summon before us all our venerable brethren, the Bishops of all the world and to combine them in an ecumenical council, which is to be celebrated next year in such a manner that with those same venerable brethren who have been summoned to take part in this the subject of our solicitude, we may be able to adopt all the most opportune and necessary

and affectionate bond of union which unites those our same honorable brothers to our person and to the apostolic see, and who have never ceased at any period of our pontificate to give to us and to the apostolic see the most striking evidences of faith of love, and of respect, we truly hope that as it has been in times past with other general councils, so it may be in the present, and that this ecumenical council convoked by us may bring forth, with the help of the Divine grace, the most rich and most fertile fruits to the great glory of God and the eternal welfare of man ' Therefore, in that hope, and instigated and encouraged by the charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, who laid down His life for the salvation of the world we cannot forbear on the occasion of the meeting of the next council, addressing our apostolic and paternal word to all those who, while recognising that same Jesus Christ as our Saviour, and rejoicing in the name of Christians yet still do not profess the veritable faith of Christ, or follow the communion of the Catholic Church And if we do so it is before us!, to warn, exhort, and supplicate them with all our zeal and all our charity to consider and son ouBly examine if they in truth follow the path prescribed by our Lord Jesus Christ, and which leads to eternal happiness In fact, no one can deny or doubt that Jesus Christ Himself, in order that all future human generations should enjoy the fruit of His redemption built up here below His Church in the person of Peter, that is to say, the Church, one, holy, catholic and apostolic and that He granted to him all the necessary power, in order that the faith should be preserved intact and entered, and that the same faith should be transmitted to all peoples, to all races, and to all nations in such a manner that all men should be able to be united in His mystical body in baptism, and always to preserve in themselves until the entire development that now life of grace without which no one can ever mont or obtain life eternal, so that the same Church which constitutes the mystical body shall remain, until the end of June, firm and indestructible in its own constitution, developed in vigor, and furnishing to its children all that is necessary for life eternal "Now, whoever wishes well to consider and examine with attention the different religious societies divided among
