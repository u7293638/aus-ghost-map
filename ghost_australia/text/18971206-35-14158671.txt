THE TEST MATCH. THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN. RIEBEN STILL REFUSES TO PLAY. Messrs F. A Iredale (New South Wales), H Trott (Victoria), and J. Darling (South Australia), the selectors of the team to represent Australia against the Englishmen, met on Saturday morning, and after a brief consultation decided upon the following eleven - SOUTH AUSTRALIA G Green J Darling E Jones C. Hill J Lyons. VICTORIA : H Trumble H. Trott NEW SOUTH WALES S E Gregory F A Iredale T R McKibbin J J Kelly. The first emergency is C M M'Leod (Victoria), and the second H Donnan (Every South Wales) For many days past the personnel of the team has been the engrossing subject in cricket circles, and speculation was rife as to who would form the combination to uphold the credit of Australia in the opening contest of the five that are to decide supremacy in the cricket field The team, so far as the original play cu goes, 13 generally admitted to be a strong one, but, as was anticipated, and which would occur with any team selected, there are many who would have preferred to have seen others in The preponderance of opinion is, however, in favour of the selectors It was generally admitted as early as the opening of the season, or indeed since the visit of the Englishmen was on established fact, that the certainties, provided all were in good health, were-U Giffen, F Iredale, H Trott, J Darling, C Hill, H Trumble, S R! Gregory, E Jones, and T R M'Kibbon and J J Kelly The question as to eleventh and twelfth positions was, however, a very vexed one Towards the close of last season 011 his then form Noble was looked upon as almost certain for a place There is, however, always a doubt in consequence of the winter break as to whether or not a first season per- former will maintain his form during the following year From his display in the recent New South Wales v. England match it must be admitted that his batting was a disappointment It lacked the brilliance and confidence that were the characteristics of last year, and which was probably the most successful effort of any first-appearance batsman in the history of intercolonial cricket It is true that he performed well in the bowline departmentrecently,but it was his maiden effort in that direction, and it would certainly he unwise to select anyone for so important a contest on one success Probably it is the close attention to howling, rendered necessary by the deficiency of attack 111 his own club, that has caused him to fall off temporarily, it is hoped in his batting At the same time it is the fortune of cricket that the best of batsmen are liable to be disposed of for next to nothing, as witness Iredale s non- success in the opening of the listAustraban Eleven's campaign in England, or, to come nearer home, Darling s recent failure in Adelaide another thing, and one which no doubt has a lot to do with Noble's lack of form, is that he has not recently enjoyed really good health, a condition that 13 an absolute requisite above all things in so great a trial of nerve, dash, and staying power as are called forth in a test match The others who had claims for recognition wro Lyons, Donnan, Mackenzie, and M'Leod, while another who was mentioned was Bruce, and in a lesser degree Worrall-the last two because of their performances against the Englishmen The difficulty of the selection was here particularly evident Two first-class matches have been played in which Victorians and South Australians took part, and New South Wales has played but one Trott and Darling had seen the form of the Victorian and South Australian candidates in their two engagements, but had not seen any of the New South Welshmen, though, of course, they could not have been in ignorance of their successes On the other hand, Iredale had not had an opportunity of judging the form of those in the other colonies in future contests this difficulty will not be met with It is hardly likely that the voting at the meeting will be divulged, but it needs no ghost to come from the grave to say that the selection must have been a majority one Notwithstanding this, it has been gathered and in this case there is no need for secrecy-that Giffen was the first man chosen, although it was felt that he would adhere to his determina- tion not to play-a decision that has since been confirmed! On Saturday morning the following telegram was despatched to him on behalf of the team -" We unanimously wish you to play in the test match The team is with you in the matter " The latter clause shows that whatever the difficulty between Giffen and the promoters of the English tour is-it is stated by the South Australian contingent that it is not a money matter the sympathy of the whole of the Australian team is with Giffen He replied as follows -" Out of no disrespect to the Englishmen or to Australia I decline to play With all luck " When the unwelcome news was voiced abroad in the pavilion at the ground on Saturday afternoon it was received with regret by those present, who had hoped for a favourable reply The selectors, recognising that they had no thing to do with matters outside the selection, wisely included Giffen. The general feeling is that the South Australian's (or, as the London is Sportsman" says, " the race of Australia ") absence considerably lessens Australia's chance. Iredale states that the team is very anxious that Giffen should play. As M'Leod was nominated as twelfth man with Giffen in the team, he will take the latter's place, mainly for the reason that he is claimed to possess the twofold qualification of being a batsman and a bowler, but it cannot be said that his inclusion has given as much satisfaction as Donnan's or Noble's would have done M'Leod's bowling, judging by his want of success in the two matches played by Victoria, would appeal to have become lost to him. Against the Englishmen his captain could not have had much confidence in him, for he was only tried for four or five overs at a cost of 17 runs without success, and was somewhere about the fifth bowler tried surely a low position for one whose claims in that department have been considered for an All Australian team. Then, again, in the second innings he secured one wicket for 27, and was evidently again the fifth bowler tried. Against South Australia his figures were none for 54 and none for 17. Therefore his only qualifications are, in reality, batting and field- ing His performance with the bat this season are 69 and 14 against the Englishmen, and 6 and 44 against South Australia He has given ample evidence that he possesses a great heart, his best efforts having been shown when things were going against 1m Side. There are, however, others who have also exhibited great determination-notably Donnan, Mackenzie, and Noble. 'The first-mentioned, by his past and present performances against the English- men, should be easily selected So far as the opposing bowlers are concerned, he has 133 for once out-run out 104 and 20-and no one can question his work in the field. As it became a question of a bowler taking Giffen's place, Noble's selection would have been justified prior to M'Leod's. It is, however, quite in accordance with the chances of cricket that he the wisdom of whose inclusion was doubted might come out of the ordeal with distinction The inclusion of Lyons is a highly popular selection. He is regarded by almost everyone as a " match winner." He is reported to have played brilliant cricket in the two matches in which he has figured, scoring well against the Englishmen, and women opposed to Victoria he compiled 79 for once out. Trott and Darling say that Lyons this season has shown better batting than on any previous occasion during the past three years. With regard to the selection, it must have been a very close go between Noble and M'Leod for the eleventh place in case a bon Her dropped out, while it is evident, from the fact that Donnan is thirteenth, that had a batsman alone retired he would have been called upon to till the vacancy. Trumble, M Leod, near Lyons are to reach Sydney on Tuesday, and will attend practice in the after - noon It is the intention of those now here to go to the ground on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, an i indulge in hard work On Thursday morning the final " gallop " will be held, and in the afternoon the team will rest On Saturday morning H Trott, in writing out the teams, inadvertently omitted Darling's name from the 11, and as a result it was posted in several places in town that " Darling was left out " Before the mistake was corrected many bystanders were wiser and sadder men, for there was much speculation thereon The team was the one topic of conversation out at the Cricket Ground during the after' noon, and when Mackenzie and Noble went to the wickets they received sympathetic cheers ADELAIDE, Sunday Lyons left by Saturday's express for Melbourne en route to Sydney Giffen is not going to play in the test match There is a strong feeling in Adelaide that one of the reasons why Giffen declines to play is that he has not shown any form in batting, and in fact appears right off owing to a severe attack of influenza, which he had some months past The general feeling in regard to the team is favourable, although there is a strong impression that Noble should play instead of M'Leod, who, it is he has not been successful with the ball for the last year or two
