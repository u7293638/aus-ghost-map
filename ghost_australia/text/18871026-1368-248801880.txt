Amusemcnts. VICTORIA THEATBE. After being closed for some time-on account of the counter attractions of the rink, the Victoria Theatre was opened on Saturday night, when Turner and Cremar's Christy Minstrels give a very mirth provoking enter, taioment to an appreciative audience. Mr. Geo. Turner, the double voiced balladist* sang "Angel Mother," and brought the house down. The second part of the entertainment included the comio sketch 'â€¢ Am-u-let," and the whole concluded with " A Ghost in the Pawnshop." The attendance was smaU, no doubt owing to the fact tbat the publio had got out of the " run of the thing," and now that the energetic manager, Mr. Hesford, is going to keep the theatre open regularly he will, we are sure, soon obtain good hocses.
