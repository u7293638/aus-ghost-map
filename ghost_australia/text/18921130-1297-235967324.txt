Having orders for Adelaide she made a start on .September 21. Between 40deg. ami 41deg. south and 2iAk-g. to lldcg. of west longitude she passed through quite a number of icebergs, sumo of which were of considerable size. The weather at the time was thick and foggy. On October 15 she passed tho meridian of the Cape in 43dcg. south, aud shaped a course over the easting in 47deg., with bad weather prevailing, and a predominance of east wiuds. Oil November 18 she fell in will a hurricane of wind, with a low barometer, and the Gtnrm was so furious that the vessel was scudding for a time tinder a gonsewing topsail, 'lhe gale commenced at north-east and veered to the west ward, finishing up at north- west.

The steamer Southern Cross, which has arrived at Alelhourno from London, and is expected to couie on here in a day »>r two, belongs to the Australian Mutual Shipping Company, and is described iu the largest steamship of her description that lias ever been seen out here. Borne idea may lie formed of her carrying capability from tiie fact that she has n deadweight capacity of upwards of 73CO tons, exclu sive of bunker space for 620 tons of coal. She can thus absorb cargo which would lie allotted to tlireo decent-sized sailing ships. It. should also be men tioned that tho steamer has been constructed spceitdly for the Australian trade in its latest de velopments. Prominent among these is tho con veyance oi frozen meat, for which there is extensive insulated space on board. Tho builders, -Messrs. Workman, Clark, and Co., of Belfast, have ecriainly been enlirMv successful in turning out a finished specimen of the enlarged enrgo-earriorof the present day. Tho bull is built of mild steel, and is con structed ou the three-deck principle. It is also double-bottomed, for the storage of water- ballast, and is partitioned oil by seven substantial water tight bulkheads. Four of these arc forward of the on'Mnoroom, and three are aft. Tho Southern Crovs measure.-; in ImiRlh 403ft. and 4-lOths between perpendiculars, her beam being 48ft. and l-10th, and the depth of hold from keel to upper deck is 54ft. moulded. This gives a gross measure ment of 5048 terns, ami a register of 3311 tons. The command of the Southern Gross lias been given to Captain Alfred Child, formerly of tho steamship Bavloy. Hellas had experience of largo steamships in this trade as well as elsewhere. Thesteamer was fairly well tested on the voyage out, in fine weather and infoul, mid Captain Child has no hesitation in Gpeaking warmly in praise of her. The engines also worked splendidly throughout, and gave entire satis faction to the chief engineer, -Mr. (J. J. Adamson, who was neucBHurily anxious that their initial per formance should bo of a creditable character. The best day's run was 302 miles. Strong head wiuds were encountered in .'.teaming through the latter portion of the south-east Hades, and hurricane weather prevailed between Lhe Croze ts and Ker- guelen. In passing the Cro/ets the weather was comparatively line and dear, ami Captain Child hum:»iu-lv took the opportunity of making a dose a'nd careful scrutiny to ascertain if there were any en-lawnys visible, 'lhe .Southern (To-s steamed within tluvu miles of the north-east Apoatle, but with the exception of countlci.3 Hocks of Peafowl there was no indication of life. Possession Island ami East island were passed tho same day but thev were equally devoid of maniKsUtiohs of shipwrecked people. The southern Cross has 3500 tons of cargo lor Sydney.
