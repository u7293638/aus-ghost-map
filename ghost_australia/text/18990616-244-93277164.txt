It cannot h. said that we of this prosont tiay tiie as ntonscotitons of tihe oritical nature of the epoch through which we are passing. 'lThe idea Ihas been conceived of ai science of hi-tory, antd leat'rned tun philosophite ahout the portogres of civilization and seek to apply to history thet rinciples of evolution and the nown phenotmena oif organitc' develop mtent. It is retaltkablet how ovtry thinker appears to he conlfident that we are int at periClod of transition. The' clover I)r. Max Nordanu lp'ns his curions book called " Detgenerraion," by iractilarly altnnottcitg, " ( I.n. epolh of listoryV is ttunuistakably in its decline, ald another is ltnnonnling ls .approach." Mr. Ilhnjamtin Kidd, in his " Social Evolution," is mor'e definite as to the niature of the chtlitti?ge. 11i says (p.p. 1't-;,t), ' The period thront?gh which we ltu patingt iv pT-i ther renilarkahli ran In the history of our eivili:,atiuti is ctutilung to a closte amongst tilth mol' advanced peoples. We i're enterting on it linew ett. ''Thl political etnfratcue?it'tetent of the masses is well nigh aeetmplished ; the prtocess which will occupy the nbxt period will beIi that of their Social enfranchisement. The peoplh, have been at last admitted to equtial political rights ; in tihe' next stage they imust applarently he admittedI to equal social opporttunities. When the nature iOf thie tran1itiolt is perceivetd, It beotletls tclear alsio that the (ii s tions arounid which the conflict of social forces lutist celiltte iin the illlttt dialte future, are just tlhose quo>tionts the Socialist itnvl\utinent has tbrought ilntAl prominence, tnatuely, those afiect. ing the 'xiisting rights of capital, and the present ilistribution of wealth." Soute of the l"rench littt'rattteiurs andi artists have even deliberately adopttled a style which they call the s0tyle of deIdtenelte; Ilciause they sayi art is arrived at that extreme point tof taturity which is prodluced hy thiuse civlilizatitone which are grotuw ing oll. These gentlemen setiml to think thiat the decay of ant ua. Oif civilizatint in volves a decay in individual nertvous organisationi. itand seeik to stimulat,, tated palates by extratvagant and in artistic devices. This t'conceit lttout the itptrtittnie of our own titntos hla? been treatetd as a distinct mental malady, and hits Iben neatly clahsitied and liaelled, like any new insect, l.iv a Gerrman proh,-..or, under the hig i sountding title tof " Akrochronistm." But since I conceifel the ideta of this eassay I have fttnd that iia thinker so accuraite anld scnpulousti as the l-te ? ... rJ P]'ilzjaiitt 's Sti-tiih-n ri-giur,.lduth Its t lfa ::` -ia.in tihe history of thu world--a stage more ntomenttds even than the stage dealt with by Gibbon ill his history ; and it coiets to lue s a ct n. firumttion of miy fanctey that hie Fees a strong analogy litntt-en oIit tilrtie altnd the time when the liltuia inpilre wuits consolidated. " The proem,"'' he sayvs, " which has been crrited oi n it a rapidly progressive ratie sim'e the French revolution, of throwling the whole civilized worldiu ito one vast colnlltiluity, anillnat, d by much the muie spirit in stearch of the :uamtl ori similar objects, and rtecoglnising lon the-whole thlte seattite moral stantldard, is lmuch like the proce-s: which nmoulded atll the Inations rtutld the Mcditerrantttn into a single great body, of which itRomen waits the heart." !lELItIOUlS 111iiEI-.S. Our titne resit.ibles that of the Csuars in particular in the disinte gration of what have long tibeen re garled ast tlthe foundattions of Society. " Therue is nut," says Matthew, Arnold, "a creed which is not shaken : notL an accredite-d dogltti which is not shown to tbe queilistionablle : not it received tradition which tdtie not threaten to dissolve." This is ai for tnidable assertion, but it is only too true. Nothing like the preselnlt posi tlon of beliefs has Ibeen known since the time which I have referred to its the time of the Ca-sars. (If courtie, it by no means follows that the creeds, and dogmas, and -trladitions which have been so fiercely attacked, will all suticcutbt; it dote not follow thati thu sceptical and thtstructive spirit will win all along the line. It may well be that the winnowing fan of criticism will titettly retiluVe all liiulst, atnid huttntatt ntetth, ]htiL the resulttbhtice , Jetwt!enthe two lLerioda i(l thia des' (ructive k-tittlcy will b' t1ltlareltt at a glance.
