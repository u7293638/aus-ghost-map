PENSIONING A " WIDOW." Sir,— -At the time of the Snowy. River rush, Mr H Seekamp, formerly editor of the Times, Ballarat, was in a newspaper paragraph, which was largely quoted, reported as dead. A few months subsequently, Mr Frazier motioned in the house for a select committee to enquire into the case for compensation of Clara Seekamp, widow of the late H, Seekamp, as to some pro- perty destroyed in the Eureka riots, Ballarat. After the usual delays, reports, repetitions of; motions, re-considerations, and amendments, Clara Seekamp was awarded £500. Now, I am not legally but I am morally and inferen- tially certain that the implication of partial des- titulion conveyed in the word 'widow', operated, vastly in favor of the fair claimant. And mark you, now arises the most painful part of my duty, which egotism, vanity, or the genious of scandal would never make me prohulgate were there not a damning evidence. th«$-- , vtiso" than ft'ed from a bad' suspicion.
