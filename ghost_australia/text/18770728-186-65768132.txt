May 26. A small detachment of F««pi«n eouiers, com nilmlrfl TitT iTrnrmnjitTni1-MirbTff ' lrrniinmiiniT by die commander of the EoamKnan Botina, Major Mnrgesen, left (he norchern shore of the Dannbe in a nnmber of small boats, and proceeded towards the post Feba.

Daring the firing; several of 4m Busaan soldiers, under the direction of lieutenant Ddbascunt, plunged into the water. Swam silently to the hull of the ironclad vessel, sod placed tbe deadly torpedo m dose contact with the bottom of lie monitor. Ate me destructive machine had been securely fastened, and the wire of an electric battery bad been accurately adjusted, the men retired to the neighbouring shore of the river, and at balf-past three in the momins the monitor was blown into the air, with all the officers and crew. The explosion was terrific; and ss nothing is said of the crew being saved, it is supposed that all on board perished with tihe vessel. The cool detenni natum with which thie fearful enterprise was successfully carried out speaks for itself. The fate of toe second Turkish monitor already sent to tiie bottom of tins Danube, with all on board, shows tow futile is the expectation that gunboats can imintoin tie mastery of a river lined wiHi hostile batteries, fined wia enemies -as resolute as tiie men whose deeds are re corded above.
