\- / , FOR THOSE WHO FAlL. ' All honor to him who shall win the prize,' The world hag cried for a thousand years, But to him who tries, and who falls and dies, I give great honor arid glory and tears. Gi ve. glory and horior and pitiful tears . To all who fail in their deeds sublime, . ? Their ghosts' aire many in the van of years, They were b'ortt with Time in advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater many and many a time, . Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword, undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine ; But thie man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo ! he is, the twin-born brother of iiiine. ? ?
