PUDLIS?ED DAILT VWEDNESDAY, JULY 14,'1886. IN Tasmania the inauguration of cadet corps in connection with the defence forces was loft to private enterpeire, and, probably b:cause the movement did not originate at the capital, th.lo Launceston Cadet Corps has received but scaCt recdg nition from the Goverenm?nt. Had it not been for the support accorded by the public the present corps. would not even be furnished with uniform, and the weapons supplied by the Defence Depar. ment-naval Soiders, which are heavier then the 'Martini-Henry rifle-are evidence of the lukewarm interest taken in its progress. Yet there exists at the present time a compact and well.disoip lined company which during the past year supplied between 20 and 30 recruits to the Rifle Regiment, an I now numbers 930 members on its roll. With a little encouragement a secoid company could be formed, as two companies of 50 or 00 cadets are rmich handier, and more manageable than one of 90. The Defence D rpartmnont, however, do not even recog: nisb the 93. The official streoglsh of the Launceston corps has been fixed at 75, and all over that number receiveo no capi tation grant, and the expense of their uniform; etc., mrust be borne by private subscription. The value of this Cadet Corps in training future members of our Defenceo Forc is appalently not reiog nised by our military nothorities. In both Vi.toris and Now South Wales a different view is taken of the cadet system, which was inaugurated in the former colony by Colonel Pargood, the then Mlrinister of Defence, only in the early part of last year. At first the movement made but slow progress, and the first ca-let corps was established, not at the capital, but at Sandhurst. .For a short time the oadots were managed by the military staff, after which the system was placed under Major Suee, who was appointed commanding officer of cadets. He entered eontusiastically into his work, and the system rapidly exteonded, the formation of corps in various parts of tihe colony being so rapid that he had a wreat deal of for.ed travelling to do in order to inspect them prior to their formation. The system is purely avolunteer one, the bsys being under no discipline act, though, of course, they are under a strict supervision. Boys of all classcs have readily joined the ranks, Master Loch; son of hin Excellency Sir Henry Loch, boing'ameobher of the Church of England Grammar School corps. An idea of the popularity of the system may be gained from the fact that at the present tinme there are no fewer than seventy six corps throughout the colony, representing nine battalions, which embrace 2500 boys, and other corps are still in course of formn tion. The Government have lent liberal encouragement, and recognising that mere drill is worthless witlhout practical train ing in the use of the rifle, have ordered a special class of light weapon for thes cadets. Their course of instruction in cludes musketry, infantry drill, and field movements, in each of which branches every encouragement has been given, and a very healthy spirit of emulation has been aroused between the various corps, which helpsl to keep them up to a good standard of excellene.. O thie 26th ultimo the second ofli:ial inspection of the ctdot corps was hold in Albert Park, when close upon a thousand cadets were present, Itheic parade beaing watchled by seons live tlhounsud spectators. The e appearance of the various corps was creditable, and the elthusiasms with which the lads entered into'thpir work gave gratifying promise for the future. A contemoporary, commenting upon the review, says-"To the boys theomalves this training will be of inestimable value. As his Eocellrcy; s poinlted' out in the sympatehetic address delivered by him, .theyare learning the two important lessons of obodience nol disciplioe. Feo:n an educational point of view alone, the cadol system amply repays the expenditure upon it by tlohe a irablo inlluence it brings to loer in forming the character of those who pass throogh it. But beyond t!ius tIllen is overy reason for the hope thSat. the system will justify its establish. ment from a military standpeint, and will ilereaftr prove a great source of strength in msaintaining our small army in the highest state of tfli:iency. W\e mnoy reassnably anticipate that most of thoso who have underdone the cadet training will, as tli y emerge into miauhood, pass into the ranks of thle Imilitis, whicih thus will receive a constant influx of trainud and intelligent recruits. Every sen cesragenment should bJ afforded to our boys to make themselres thoroughly competent." Every reason above urged in favour of the Victorian cadet corps will apply with equal force to Tassmania, but how dilferent is the action of our Defenca Department. 1, cannot be denlid that this colony has very little to show for the large sumsn annually spent for defonce purposes, and the defect lies in the adminiistration of the departsment. Unsder the pretent sye. teons, swhich irritates and discourages bothl ollioers and mail by' formal routino and useless rod toapisim, by needleas delays and a lamentablo absence' of busoeisrs capacity and even conmmon sense at head quarters, lno improvement can be holod for, and an incroeased expenditure wnoul only incan increaso'l muddlo. Wlhat is re quircd is a reform that shall enEurOe nmo bmore marked degr?e of ellinioncy and more practical results for the money expended. At the presunt tinm oven if our On lot Corps had proper rifles they have no range to practico at, and though our readers were informed some montlis ago that a mtcst suitable site for a no.v rifle range hod beein secured by the Government we may state the ipurchase has never been comnpleted, the necessary conveyances not ,lheving been yet prepared by the Solicitor-General's office. Wo sincerely tiust that amongst the new members who will represoent Launceston in the coming Parliament some will be found to enquire carefully into lie position and require. Smneats of our Defnene Force and bring the real facts of tie ciao before" Parliasniunt in a matmlor that no representativeo ias ever yet undertaken. VoLONTEE?

Kemp, t Acting Police IMagistrate, and Mr. H. o Weedon, J.P., two cases connected with s the Government Railway Department Were 2 heard. In the first case, the defendant, e iTenry Devlin, wan charged with having, o on Juoe 25, wilfully paid for travelling in a railway carrilge from Launceston to St. Leonards and neglecting to leave the train at that station. In the second place he was charged with having paid his fare from Luincestem to St. Leonards anud wil- f fully proceeded on to Formby without first having paid the additional fare. Mr. G. T. Collins appeared for thel prosecution, and iMr. R. Byron Miller for the defence. . From the evidence of 1 Leonard J. Dowling,. Daniel Hart nett, S:muel J. PadIlin, and Ephraim Ford. itappeared that on the daylnamed in the information detfedant was a passen geor by the 8 a.mu. train on the Western line, andl he purchased it second class ticketo to St. Leonards, proceeding to Formby without paying anything addi tional. On alighting from the train at Formby, defendint hunded his ticket to tlhe guard, face downwards, when the fraud was discovered. Tihe ticket col lector told him to see the stationmnster and settle the matter, but defendant I only walked up to the o!lle, and threw the ticket in the window, alleging that he havl p id'ills 41 at the Launceston station, and then he walked off. For the defence rMr. Mliller contended that a mistake had Sbeen made by the booking clerk, nnd the defendant had put down 11s 4l for a ' Formby ticket, and the clerk in the hurry hI ad made a mistake, and given him a ticket for St. Leonards, instead of for ]Formby. The Bench said there was no reason whatever to doubt tihe evidence for the prosection, it being so very distinct. r Had defendant paid 11s 4d at tihe Launccs ton station, the mistake would haIve been found out when the booking clerk was making np his cash, but suchll was not the f case. They considered defendant guilty, and fined'him 10s and costs. hMr. Collins applied for professional costs, which were Siallowed, while an application for witnesses' expenses was refused. The second elhrgo Swas withdrawn, on the understanding that Mr. Collins was paid .$1 is in that case for professional attendance.
