A BBOKEN-HEARTED - OABDENER. TO THE BDITOB. Sir—Will you kindly insert the following for the information of those whom it might concern. Most of my neighbours know that I have gone to a great deal of trouble in getting a bit of a Srden in this town. On several occasions oowb ve got in and done a fearful amount of damage; but the oow that got in last Tuesday night beat everything that had gone before. L oan scarcely say what damage the brute has done. The Tines seemed to have first'struck W fancy, for most of them are eaten down to the stump. The stocks came in for a very liberal share of her cowship's favours; and as for a large bed of peas, ■well, all I can say about them is, that the place which knew them knows them no morej for yon «night as well look for nuggets for as even the ghost of a pea-stalk. Neither did the brute neglect the almonds in her search for dainties. I conld^have forgiven the beast had she acted jteJittle bit Christian-like, and confined herself to 'fchefruit, but the voracious creature must swallow branches, tod. As for the flowers generally, they seemed, I suppose, in her ladyship's estimation more pretty than* palatable; and actuated .by a degree of malice that I shall not easily forgive, the ungenerous creature trampled them" in-the earth. I know the owner of this cow, and he- knows that she has been in my garden. I shall not lay an information for this; but I warn him that if his or any other person's cow plays such tricks in bit earden -again. I mar not be so merciful. I am, Sir, &e.;, H. B. HAWKE.
