MAYORS AND “GRIEVANCES”—BEN- DIGO, EAGLEHAWK AND EOHUCA. There’s been a little flutter lately in civic circles because Mr. Sternberg, one of the Governments representatives on the Courntry. Fire Board, having laid the memorial stone if Bendigo’s new central fire dejiot, inspend if the- mayor. Echuca,aho lias a grievance, and Eaglcliaivk,. too, if it pleases, can have i grievance likeiv.isOv all on the very, some important civic .subject. The . fun of the •riling is that the three "grievances’’ are all ; ntor-roratod. The case was'unofiici-iny 'ex plained to ilr. Sternberg by a private, dc mtstion', in these 'words.’ • "You m«de a mistake' over that , foundation vt one;' or ioc aorial stone of whatever you call ii. "he old mail's grievance is a genuine one. By prescriptive riglit* by Jhe ancient unwritten laws of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the bailies and provosts of “Scotland,' fnice the memory of man mmietli not' to ’ the contrary, any. little, thing of tliis sort jde volv.c on the mayor of tho place. ;- Nine tenths of the people of the place would gladly, see you in the -mayoral chair.-. 'Then they know that you’d give us spmetliing cheerful and livoljr of a suinmer- evening in the reserve. You'd liven up the sombre and deserted old Town, Hall (in the cellars of which the Bayne street-ghost has taken up his undisturbed quarters), whilst the. dis mal old dilapidated coprfc, house you’d make joyous again with the nimble feet ami‘tlie, bright merry eves of dancing'men ing women wolfing the ball suppers. You’d every now and then be ipviting desirable Melbourne and foreign visitors to 1 Bendigo and its reefs. You’d oven, perhaps, be giving a general picnic to' tho youngsters of the district. ’ Whatever is ceftaiit/"one thing is certain that when your mayoral year was over, you wouldn’t have' -much of 1 -the £3Q0 a year left to carry home. : ■ People would, therefore, be only too 'delighted-to have you as mayor, and laying as tmany foundation stones os would> servo i for mile posts from iiere to Melbourne; • "Put thaf don’t'got over .tho. fact thab the mayor is• iuayor*. and : Mr. Stofnbefgy 'it therefore' follows that until you are mayor that mf course you can’t bo mayor.” '; J Those were tho very, words bf the “dbpu-. tatjon.” I heard them myself, and have now transcribed them/, , In the mayor’s room; a week' later they selected Gr. Ilyani to move the protesting resolution. • They ; should themselves hav.b moyod ifc when the mayor first mentioned the subject, blit somehow they forgot. Bet terj late * than; never* however,; the rights, dignities and observances r o£ all past, and futiirc mayoi-s of Bendigo were vindicated. Now, Or.
