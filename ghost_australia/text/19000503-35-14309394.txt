THE PROTECTIONIST CONFERENCE. . III SYDNEY, APRIL, 1906. By. EDUARD PILFOLD, M.L.O. In November last two conferences were held in Melbourne in the interests of protection One was a conference of delegates of protectionist bodies, the other of delegates of Chambers of Manufactures, and each conference adjourned for a further meeting The protectionist delegates have now had their second meeting, this time in Sydney, and their official report appears in the " Herald " of Friday last This report includes the one published after the November conference, together with certain new matter which is largely, to say the least, of a peculiar character It seems that the delegates agreed upon the details of a tariff, and also that they withhold them from publication. " AN ILLICIT SCOOP " The defence which they put forward for this action is as follows " For reasons which are manifest the details of the draft tariff cannot be promulgated without defeating the end and aims of all tariffs, which are to prevent undue importa- tion and to conserve revenue This was quite understood in the Federal Convention debates, when the danger was pointed out that the New South Wales importers might half destroy the Federal customs revenue of the first year of the Commonwealth by indenting under a free tariff, and thus evading the duties which would otherwise go to the Federal Treasury The freetraders are fully alive to this, and are endeavouring to gain a knowledge of the protectionist proposals with the object of making an illicit scoop from the Federal Customs revenue " Here are two explicit statements, each of which troubles to bits when examined The first statement, or charges rather, is that for the first year the Federal revenue might be half destroyed by " New South Wales importers " bringing in goods before Federal duties were imposed, and afterwards sending them all over the Federation It appears quite obvious that the delegates are not aware that a clause was inserted in the Federal Constitution Bill under SA Inch for a period of no less than two years imported goods cannot pass from one State to another without paying the Federal duty, if there be one, unless it can be shown that the duty was paid in the State of import The clause is No 92, and that there may be no doubt on the subject the exact wording of it is here given - " Notwithstanding anything in this Constitu- tion, goods imported before the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any State, or into an) colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two years after the imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less any duly paid in respect of the goods on their importation " This clause makes it clear enough that the alleged danger does not exist The second charge is that " the freetraders " want to know what is proposed, in order that they may make an " illicit scoop " out of the public revenue With a view to show the public the character of the argument for withholding the details of the proposed tariff, and not with the view of defending freetraders from a change in itself too ridiculous for notice, attention is drawn to the fact that the present writer in an article on Federal finance, appearing in the " field " on September 15, 1897, drew attention to the risk of a leakage of revenue when the uniform tariff came into operation, and the remedy was suggested which, as just shown, was afterwards embodied in the Constitution by the Convention It is strange that the delegates who suggested and approved of this " illicit scoop " charge do not see how it records on themselves, for it the protectionist delegates possess knowledge which would if possessed by other people allow those other people to make " an illicit scoop " thon thoy-the protectionist delegates are themselves, as the sole possessors of this knowledge, the only people likely to make this " illicit scoop " If, therefore, they have dug a pit, they have certainly fallen in it As we proceed it will be easy to show very good reasons why the delegates wish to keep secret their proposals-the reasons actually put forward are more than childish THE PROTECTIONISTS TJNINTENTION ALLY REVEAL THEIR PROPOSALS In the very same report as that in which they claim to have for meritorious and public-spirited reasons withheld the details of their draft tariff, the delegates have unintentionally " let the cat out of the bag." We have only to read between the lines to see clearly all, or nearly all, that these gentlemen want In every tariff in the world there is a " free list " If a man is given the free list, then OF everything else is dutiable, he can easily compile the dutiable list, and being told the amount of revenue required, and whether it is to be collected on protective or non protective lines, he can soon arrive with some close approxi- mation to accuracy even to the rates of duty Turning again to the report the following is found -" there has been a special endeavour to preserve as far as possible the extensive free list that is embodied in the Victorian protection tariff In fact this course has been deviated from only where the industrial requirements of other colonies made protective duties necessary It is to be noted not only that there has been an " endeavour," but that it has been a " special " one, and that it has been carried " as far as possible," not, it is to be remembered, to make a free list that can be vaguely spoken of as satisfactory, but to make a copy of the Victorian one, and with emphatic clearness the due is given to the " only " deviations that have been made from that list If a man has three daughters Rose, Lily, and Violet, and he is told that a certain desirable young man is in love with one of them, and that the one is neither Rose nor Lily, he won't be far wrong in expects "-a proposal will be for the hand of Miss Violet "hero is a nega- tive way of putting a fact "which answers equally with the positive " The art of putting things " was the title of an interesting paper written some years ago by that well known writer " A K II li," and the " art " is one not unknown in political life Probably it is not far from the truth to say that the delegates know that the word " free " has a charm for the taxpayer, and they felt driven to give him information on the " free list " subject, and that they forget that having named the sheep the taxpayer could pick out the goats It is not the least use for the delegates to beat about the bush any longer and pretend to be holding a great secret locked in their patriotic breasts The murder is out If they can have their way they will let Australia have tree of duty those articles that are free in Victoria, and they will put duties, on a protective basis, on everything else, us Victoria does Certain alterations are proposed, but substantially the delegates have the Victorian tariff in their thoughts, and they tell us that they are " satisfied " they have reached the " high-water mark of scientific protection " Well, Borne of us have heard of an Australian colony from which, since the last census was taken, the people have been departing at an average of about 15,000 a year, and as the departing ones have been mostly men, the last official estimates of population showed that fewer men than women were now left in that colony a state of things hitherto unknown in any Australian colony " Scientific protection " has not done much good to that colony Would it be likely to do much for Australia ? Certainly it does not look as if the V Victorian tariff for Australia " could be a very popular election cry If the basis of the delegates' dream of " scientific protection " could have been hidden, the protectionists prospects might have been brighter, but they have made a conspicuous failure of their attempt at secrecy THE DELEGATES AS FINANCIERS We need not stop to consider the revenue called protection-that manufacturers would be able to collect for themselves from " the high- water mark of scientific protection " embodied in the tariff of the delegates , but it is as well to consider how far the revenue that would flow to the public Treasury would reach Australian requirements The report says " The conference has gone to much pains and some expense in making a minute inquiry as to how much revenue would be yielded by its draft tariff " Apparently the delegates have satisfied themselves that they have provided for plenty of revenue for the public treasury, for they say that if it is found they have provided too much revenue they " will be quite prepared to suggest revenue duties that may be further remitted " This is very encouraging , but all the same, in view of what the delegates have let slip, it is easy to show that they are entirely mistaken in their statements Possibly the delegates have made a slight error in the addition of their figures and oTewt#ied,üia m^,nm^y%*ßsfiy^9ai. As they will not allow any profane freetrader to inspect their calculations, it is impossible to say exactly what has happened But just as they were good enough to " let the cat out of the bag " in regard to the articles they proposed to tax, so have they Ken good enough to tell the public quite enough to make it clear that they could not make revenue and expenditure meet by a few millions In the first place it is well known that the protective system in Victoria is higher than is generally approved by Australian protectionists, and that in fact about five years ago the Victorians reduced many of their duties Therefore it is clear that we know the very worst that could happen The delegates have made it plain that they want what they call " adequate " duties, that is duties to give protection rather than revenue, and therefore they want rates on manufactured goods which in Australia will not give the Treasury relatively more than they now yield to Victoria. It is a well ascertained fact that the abolition of duties on interstate commodities, as far as Victoria and some other States at any rate are concerned, would mean that were the Victorian protective system adopted a shortage of revenue would result, and that it would be needful to raise further revenue by means of duties on articles of consumption This being the position, what do these gentlemen do who profess themselves anxious to " con- serve the revenue 'V The) propose to make ducks and drakes of the great revenue-producing items those items which under both protective and freetrade tariffs are looked to as the mainstay of the Treasury They propose to make the duties on tobacco and cigars ' more effective, for they consider Australia can " grow and manufacture tobacco equal to the best in the world " This means that this splendid source of revenue is to be played with, and that it is to be made " more effective " not for the mass of the people in the form of greater revenue, but for the select few who grow and manufacture tobacco The report proceeds -" On wines, too, both still and sparkling, an increase is proposed, and the same may be said of spirits " The duty on spirits is the largest revenue producing one to-day in every colony in Australia, but, in view of the principle on which the conference has acted all through," the interest of the distillers is to come more to the front, and the interest of the public is to be hustled to the rear Then a scheme is proposed for dealing with the tea duty It is that a rate of 4d per lb be imposed plus 10 per cent on the value. It is stated " this would make the duty on low priced too about 1 5d per lb and on the higher-priced teas from 3d to 4d per lb, according to value The report adds " The conference strongly recommends this settlement of the tea duty as one that will serve two useful ends-first to conserve the revenue by an impost on an article of universal consumption, and secondly to make the poor and the nob pay more equitably on the respective values they consume ' Turning now to the import returns it is seen that in New South Wales in 1898 the aggregate imports averaged a value of about (yard per lb Probably this fairly represents the imports of all the colonies Ton per cent on this figure is less than 4d, and with the Id makes less than 1 3d per lb This means a proposal for throwing away a very heavy amount of revenue The talk about rich and poor is misleading, for it is the poorest people who are the most dependent on tea, it is their luxury, and why the finer qualities should be put more out of their loach is hard to explain At any rate, it is clear that the proportion of high grades of tea imported is small Sugar This article the delegates put at an excise of £3, which clearly is a low rate, and cannot yield any substantial sum Having regard, therefore, to the course suggested in regard to the main revenue-producing items, it seems clear beyond dispute that the delegates have prepared a draft tariff which would leave a deficit of simply enormous proportions In addition to throwing real revenue away right and left, the delegates have a big scheme for using up revenue " The conference feels that the system of bonuses it recommends may very profitably entail an annual expenditure of a considerable amount We believe the tariff we have framed has made provision for all these requirements ' Of course what is meant by a " considerable amount " must be interpreted by what is proposed there is the list of industries proposed to be granted bonuses Iron, steel, essential oils, vegetable oils, perfumes, hemp, flax, cotton, other fibres, and raw silk It would appear to be a very easy thing to spend all the money realised by duties on tea and sugar in bonuses in the directions indicated Looking calmly it the matter, it may be said that any further details of the draft tariff are quite superfluous The public will be satisfied with what has been put before them, and will be neither surprised nor disappointed if they never hear any more on the subject. THE FARMERS It is easily seen that the conference has been spared very considerably by it having been shown conclusively that the farmers' interests lie entirely with the freetrade policy It is now proposed as a sop to make reapers and binders duty free The most significant sign, however, of alarm in this direc- to iii is the following " It was further resolved by the conference that a proposal made by Mr A Forsyth for an export bonus on wheat should be referred to the Federal Council " Of course there is not the ghost of a probability of 1 such a proposal of or being agreed to No such thing exists in any part of the world, and without coming to much per bushel it might involve a million a year. The delegates know very well the proposal is an impossible one Even they have not adopted it, but " refer " it somewhere or other It is just dirt thrown out to blind the eyes of the farmers That the delegates have been driven to allow so wild a suggestion to appear in any form is significant "BUT IN EVERY CASE" It will be remembered that in their first report it was shown that the delegates had resolved that duties should be based on the relative cost of goods in Australia and abroad The central showed that, as many goods cost as little or less to make as to import, the resolution precluded duties on such goods, a course which it was suggested was not in accord with what the delegates wanted The point has evidently been considered, with the result that the following significant addition has now been made to the original resolution " But in every case the duty should be such as to favour the domestic production against the foreign ' This makes the position clear and puts the delegates in accord with protectionists the world over They want power to charge more for their goods, quite irrespective of whether the goods cost them more or less than the imported They ought to have admitted this fact lit first In conclusion, it may be said that the report cannot fail to prove every useful to the freetraders, and probably they will do more than the protectionists to keep it alive
