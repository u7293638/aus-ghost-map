The pleasant day enabled all to enjoy themselves thoroughly, and the excursion was a decided success, in the evening the steamer brought the excursionists to their homes. i ORANGE INSTITUTION.-Yesterday, the members of this institution gave a grand picnic to Chowder Bay. " Between I two and three thousand people were present, and joined in the amusements, provided. A band was in at tendance, and at one time the number of dancers was so great that it was found necessary to ( leave the pavilion and dance on the grass. The weather was all that could he desired ; the visitors were well-behaved, and the steamers which plied to and from the ground were speedy and punctual. During the day many*visitekij|tho i fortifications at George's Head, and enjoyed the admirable prospect from that elevated and extremely picturesque spot. Whilst one of the steamers was leaving the bay, late in the afternoon, an accident occurred which might have been attended with serious consequences. Owing to the number of persons congregated at the extremity of the poor, the woodwork suddenly gave way, and a number of persons I (amongst whom were some ladies) were precipitated into the water. Happily no great harm was done beyond a very disagreeable wetting. The parties were all promptly I rescued from their unpleasant predicament, and went away with the rest of the people to Sydney. As one of those I stumers approached the wharf,, at the Circular Qua a another accident occurred. The vessel gave a sudden li' yes I and a young woman fell " overboard-the deck being r athel I crowded at the time. A young man, whose name came. not j transpire, instantly jumped into the water, and bravery 80. 1 named. the ten ified girl until a boat came promptly up and I took them both ashore. It' was reported in, town, last night, that a woman had been drowned through the of calling of shops at Chowder, but the above appears to horses I root statement of the facts of the case, which threw a ' damp upon the festivity at the Orange, Picnic, I J ATHOL GARDENS. An excursion took place to Athol Gardens in aid of the funds of the Roman Catholic Mission, of Paddington. A steamboat left the Circular Quay at is a ovals throughout the day, and was tolerably well patron item- some hundreds of excursionists visiting the pleasure groin, ds. There was an Irish piper and a band of music in the pavilion! met with their aid dancing was kept up, the young fulksprcscnt entering into the sport with great eagerness. Tie on)' passed pathway, and the holiday folk were landed in the city before dusk. BALMORAL.-- This place of entertainment was visited yesterday by a very large excursion party, under the aus- rites of the Australian Brothers of Temperance. Three steamers plied from the Circular Quay during the day, and it is estimated conveyed from two to three thousand persons in their various trips.' The committee of management; made excellent arrangements for their numerous patrons and the proceedings of the day were characterised by good feeling and order. Besides other music, the Artillery Band was on the ground. In the pavilion dancing was carried on vigorously, and other games were engaged in. Sous took advantage of the occasion to visit the fortifications on the North Shore. The excursion financially must have been a success, judging by the crowded steamers. WATSON'S BAY AND MANLY BEACH There were so many excursions and entertainments to attract the people, that those old but beautiful seaside resorts, Watson's Bay and Manly Beach, were less patronised by holiday folks than usual. Several steamers were, however, kept pretty busy in conveying excursionists thither. Both places possess sufficient attractions in themselves to secure always numerous visitors ; there are so many picturesque spots where picnic parties may enjoy themselves, and the rocks and beaches afford delightful walks. But one of the principal reasons which influence pleasure seekers to visit either Watson's Bay or Manly Beach is the delightful trip across our magnificent harbour. No other trips affords such a complete view of the beauties of the port is that to Manly and from no other spot, than from the high ground overlooking Watson's Bay can such, on extensive panorama of natural scenery be witnessed. The above watering-places will therefore over proTofavonriter retreats for pleasure parties and those who visited them yesterday must have spent a thoroughly pleasant day, as the weather was extremely fine, and the atmosphere was emperedby the cool sea breezes. SCHOOL OF ARTS A grand operatic and ballad concert was given at the School of Arts yesterday evening. The principal performers were Miss Ryall, Mrs. Conduit, Mr. R. L. Skinner, Mr. B. Leveson, and Mr. J. J. Ryall. The performance was thoroughly satisfactory.
