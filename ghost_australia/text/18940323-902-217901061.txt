A 'Ghost' Betrays Himself. A landed proprietor and farmer at Kraffohls- dort, in Germany, recently was subjected to much annoyance by a mischievous 'ghost.' First of all, the mysterious visitor removed the chains which bound the cowb in their stallB. The boraeB were let loose from the stableB, and the barne&s; and stable utensils were scattered over the place, and a pitchfork was hung at the entrance to the stables. In tho dwelling-house the furniture wbb turned topsy-turvey, the pier-classes were torn from the walls, and fruit and onions Btrewn over the carpet. The 'Spuk' then helped itself to a savings bank book and thirty marks in cobIi.- This laBt act was suicidal, for the 'Spuk' gave up the ghost when he tried to realise the contents of the book. The disturber of the farmer's peace was his only son, a youth of 13 years. BMBMBBBBCBBBan
