OUR FIRST ARCHBISHOPS. Angnsiaie. the first Archbishop or Canterbury, was little more than a mis fionary As he and his. handful of followers landed on the Kentish coast and walked in a slow procession, hearing a cross and singing: chants, to where i King Etb elberf sat under an oat tree, a ren* humble insignificant body they ap peared, 110 Jonbs. And yet among them were two men, the one destined to I occupy the see cf Canterbury as the first Primate of England, the other, PauKnus, to be singled out by the Pope for the position of Archbishop of "York, a title j which., owing no doubt to his incessant' labors in tee northern province, has often been imstaberiir accorded to him. The duties attached to ttie archiepiscopal sees were, in the «iarlv days of the Church, arduous and didicnlt, and the responsibili ties and dangers great. The issues of life and death lay in the hands of a successful primate, v.-hereas. if he failed, his own life niiglii pay the forfeit. To Arch bishop IVurliaiu is due the most perfect vKtrwe possess-of the diocese of Canter ban* previous to the Reformation, for he not only made visitations of it in loll, hat he laid a debt on all posterity by recording what he saw and heard. The subjects upon which the archbishop's opinion was solicited and obtained give au interesting idea of the scope of his ecclesiastical and personal authority. Thus we learn that at the Priory of St. Sepulchre—a foundation of nuns—the ] prioress, who was eighty-four years old, was charged by two of the sisters (who were x«ast eighty) with defaming their character to the great scandal of their Lease. The archbishop, with con summate tact, admonished both accnsers and accused, telling the prioress not to ase iicentanieHous words," and ordering the asters to be obedient to her rule, as required by their profession, thus no doubt preventing a serious breach, which the espousal of one-sided views might po<ribly have brought about. A record is given of the heterogeneous array of complaints laid before the archbishop by the monks of St. Martin's, at Rover. These included the curious grievances that they had ** linen instead, of woollen sheets." and no one to 44 teach them grammar.'' "We should imagine that these are the most remarkable re- I quests of such a nature on record. Alany of the colleges and nunneries, notablv those of "Wye and Dariiigton, p^*;- excel- I lent examinations, but at Taversbam the 11st oi complaints is so formidable that 1 the mind of the reader quails before the picture of domestic discomfort it reveals. For example: the food is not properly senecL" the saciistaii is " contumelious,* the hatler ill-mannered," the cellarer is | accused of spoiling the food for the re fsctory, which was inanifestlv gratuitous interference. his own duties being the proper decanting of wine. "Whether xras done by deiuoralisiiig the coot is not stared, bat it is certain that the meat came up "* half-boiled." and that for some occult reason the cellarer and not the cook was held to be the culprit. The a.~chbishop was severe: possibly he was ** half-boiled " meat, but of this there is no record. Unfortunately at the Priory of Deeds no better state of affairs availed his grace. One of the monks lays petition before the archieplsecpal "riritor which i< full of unspoken, vet ^ridenfiy insulted, dignity. He begs that. 3i minre the prior may not be allowed **to lay hands and feet" £J) on big kefiireK. Granted. The churchwardens too are allowed their say daring this tjor or inspection. One of these gentle— tser solemnly complains to the arch fcisaop that his chorehyard is " haunted "—though it dees not appear "riietner this statement implies grazing 0r ^ghosts. What could exceed the Pathos of the following return by wardens ased to describe the condition of their parish—4* Desperate " r The parochial clergy too appeal to the archbishop. A ricar complains that a canon (who had \--•pneinly received his education at the monastery where no grammar was taught) and addressed Trim as follow: Hwrbelt tLou beareth thee bold, and hisrituted by my lord of Canterbury ; ie hath nought to do here, for we are trenpT frotu him, so tell him." Another piest is interrupted by an irate pari during the solemnisation cf the sendee. It is evident th«.r fh. of wedding festivities felt by not directly concerned is not a -mug of to-day, for we are told that this suddenly shouted to the officiating -^yuiaii who was patting the neces ^ Questions enjoined by the rubric, htboa ax them any more here I will A sidesman states than when tempting during service time, to get z Tr=ridnoner out of xmhliohouse to ^d^vorslrip (was tins one cf their that person offensively, but ^what emginaticalI3-, told the officer shahe^his eara." The peace ^dents of Keucington parish may ^ \- surprised to learn that a former ^daaoner, named Richard Ricards, ^ateiied, la the 3'ear 1511, to slay his cases of insnbordinatioi* gjiemoreincomprehensible when it is * -inhered that humfiiating penances, ^uiioanication, confiscation, torture. ^ "T burning, were punishments, j -iu out by the authorisation of the pre- ! ts 01 the flay.
