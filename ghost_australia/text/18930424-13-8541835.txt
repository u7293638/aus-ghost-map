THEATRE ROYAL. " LIFE FOR LIFE." "An entirely original romantic and sensational drama, in four acts entitled "Life for Life, was written by Mr George Darrell, was produced at this house on Saturday evening before a very good audience, by the more demonstrative section of which it was extremely well received It is so eccentric in its construction that it is not always easy to follow the thread of the story, especially in the first act as here a sufficiently long interval of time is supposed to elapse before even the BUiftmgof one scene and its replacement by another to admit of two criminal trials having taken place Romantic and sensational the drama certainly is, but its originality consists rather in the ingenuity with which a number of dramatic incidents and situations, such as are the stock in trade of the play wright, have been pieced together than in the devising of anything new But the difficulty of discovering anything of the kind that has not previously been hit upon and appropriated must be acknowledged to be very great indeed As to the dialogue, it is such as we have been accustomed to hear from the lips of the heroes and heroines of melodrama from the days of The ball do»vn»varrts, and the moral sentiments expressed are those which never fail to be echoed by the applause of the gallery The virtuous characters are persecuted for a season, and wickedness triumphs, but each meets with its appropriate reward at the end of the piece so that people leas e the theatre with the comforting conviction that justice has been v indicated all round The scene opens in the matron's room in the hospital at Dunedin-a room with a sliding panel half way up the wall facing the audience, and when this is withdrawn, and the rest of the stage is darkened, you are allowed to see what is taking place in one of the wards, containing an old miser who has got £2,000 in a pocketbook under his pillow Isabel Gower (Miss Bland) is the matron of the institution , her father, Giles Gower (Mr G P Carey ), a disreputable old drunkard, is its dispenser, Dr Richard Crosby (Mr A E Greenaway ) is the senior physician of the hospital and the evil genius of the drama, Dr Montrose (Mr Inman) his junior professionally and his moral antithesis Both are in love" with Isabel, who judiciously prefers the good young man Old Gower and Cromby both know of the old misers treasure, and resolved to possess themselves of it So they drug his medicine and then we have a clinical scene in which Montrose administers the composing draught union status of its having been tampered with, and the miser entrusts his pocketbook to him, with a testamentary letter, and presently dies As soon as his death is known Cromby and Goyy or tax Montrose with having murdered the old man for the sake of his money, the police are called in the pocketbook is found on his person and he is taken to prison He is tyy ice tried, and on the second occasion is convicted But an old friend turns up in the person of Samuel Soutar (Mr. G. Darrell), an irrepressible newspaper reporter, who obtains access to the prison, exchanges clothes with the convict, and enables him to escape In the second act the scene shifts to the diggings in the Hokitika district, where Gower 13 keeping a store and grog shop, and where St. Patrick's Eve is celebrated by a ballet, and a mysterious personage turns up in the shape of a dumb old man, who is wandering about New Zealand seeking for his twin brother. Need it be said that this brother is the miser who was poisoned in the Dunedin Hospital ' Gower sees the dumb man, mistakes him for the ghost of his victim, and is so troubled in his conscience that the secret of the murder is learned by his daughter Isabel, who has become the wife of Crombj, whom she loathes, in order to save her father from ruin Montrose is discovered on the diggings and is re- arrested. In the third act he is being conveyed to Christchurch, when the gold escort is stuck up by a party of bushrangers, and by the aid of the ubiquitous Soutar he is enabled once more to effect his escape, and gallops off behind Isabel Gower, who is mounted on horseback, amidst what the play - bill calls "a scene of unparalleled excitement " But these documents do exaggerate now and then. In the fourth act old Gower dies of alcoholism, but not before he has made and attested a confession of the murder in which his daughter's husband was his con- federate. Then we get back to the ranges, to which Cromby has carried off his wife, whom he shuts up in a shanty, which is the hiding place of the bushrangers There is a roll up of the diggers to hunt them down, and the mounted troopers appear upon the scene to capture the outlaws. They fire the hut, Isabel is dragged out of the building in a fainting condition ; Cromby is shot, and the presumption is that Montrose will marry the widow, while Soutar will become the husband of her sister Lilian (Miss Herberte), and a similar arrangement will unite the conn couple of the piece, humorously represented by Miss Jennie Lee and Mr A E Poulton. The acting is quite up to the level of the drama, the literary quality of which never rises above the common- place ; but the rapid succession of sensational incidents imparts the necessary briskness to the performance, and two of the calls-those after the second and third acts were spontaneous and hearty. It would be unjust, however, to omit to mention the two scenes in which Mr. G. P. Carey exhibits no little dramatic power, if somewhat crudely expressed that in which he mistakes the dumb man for the spirit of his murdered brother, and that in which he is a prey to remorse in the presence of death. Both were artistic, if rugged, and are likely to become more of the former and less of the latter with each repetition of them. "Life for Life" will be repeated every evening until further notice.
