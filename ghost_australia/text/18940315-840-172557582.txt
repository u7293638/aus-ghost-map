Wolseley and Thirteen. Viscount Wolseley, in declining an invitation, wroto tho following letter, whioh wall recoived too late to be road at tho moraorablo salt- epilling, tnirror- breaking banquet on January 15 (says tbo Home Hews) : — " Tbo Royal Hospital, Dublin, January 14, 1894\. Dear Sir, — I have to uoknowlcdgo tho receipt, of your letter of tbo 30th ultimo, and to request that you will be good onougb to convoy to tho committee of the London Thirteen Club my upxireciation of tho great honour they would confer upon me. I wish I could accept this flattering invitation and bocome an honorary member, but I could not honestly do so. I not only believe in many superstitions, but, 1' hug them with the warmest affection. They link mo, if not with a spiritual world of which I know nothing, at least with a glorious and artiBtio and picturesque past, of which history has told me muoh. I boliovo in ghosts and in amulots ; I have worn out the rims of soveral hats sinco I have been in Dublin through my salutation of single magpies — that myotic bird abounds in Irelnnd — and I would hot on any account walk under a ladder, &o.;, in fact, J am prono to adopt any super stition I am told of whioh I find others believe in. How, therefore, could I express sympathy with tho objeots of your club ? I could not ; but I can thank you and all your members most cordially for your kind invitation, and wish you many very pleasant mcotings. I am suro they will bo so, although you all have the misfortune to rejeot suporstitions which aro tho salt of life to yours very gratefully, Wolseley."
