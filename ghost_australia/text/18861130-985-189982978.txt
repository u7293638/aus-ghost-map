He wasnetnn itini to Iter, it is twe, bathe had never bees tender. Homed line was fond of iter, but she must ignorant end snperstt tious; sad perhaps the must confetti** companion Margaret had ever had, era* a vetf strange one. A woman, no longer yoang. evidently s hard-wortiag person, yet as evidently by birth s lady, who had flwt I«r once in the woods, when she vm * little child, and had asked her for a hist, and who ever since had, new and again, crowed her path in aoine lonely place, - •ttd talked to her as no one dsn ever did. She had asked her name once, and the woman had said " call me MarUia.n *" Martha was my mother's name," said the child ; "she died before lever knew her." Then suddenly she was strangely moved. " Oh, if 1 only had a motherV she raid. And the woman kissed her again, and two team dropped from her eyes. That was years ago. Margaret was now It, yet still she tnct the pile fair woman with her hard-worked hands and high-bted face, her common dress and lady-like movements, in the woods, by the little spring, amidst the gray rocks in the pathway that led from the orchard to the highway, and wane or twice in the - orchard itself." That wee when her grand father was array. And the had .never spoken to htm of this lady, fie never allowed her to have any friends. Onoe she complained to the woman of this, bat she only-answered; ** tow grandfather Is viae ? obey him. j Yoor quiet life is a safe viae, at least. You do not know tha world's dangers, my child." Of late, however, Margaret had had « tittle secret of her own, one that she did not tell her friend any mote than her grandfather. Some one else had met her in the woods. Some one else had told her, as this woman had raid, that she was beau tiful. Yes, some one tdae had kissed her also with a kiss that thrilled her through and through. She had a lover of whom die knew nothing, rave that he was hand some, that he praised her, that he said life was unblest without her. Perhaps she might have told Martha all, hut like the others she seemed to be lieve her without friends, and Margaret knew by instinct that mention of a lover would horrify them all. Yet she could not forego the one happiness of her life. She knew her grandfather would put an mat to the pleasant meetings if he guessed at them v and Ralph Hariand had also told her so. " A strange old geoQcnu, your grand- i fether," he had «ud; "4 man who, I though doubtless deserving of respect,' has 00 sympathy for other*. Wen I to go to the home «nd mk permission to visit you, though he knows me well enough by reputation, he would drive me | &*» his door. We must many first, and then nk his forgiveness. We ogi do without It if he refuses it, I think." And Margaret felt that so she had but her Ralph for her very own die could do without all else. What lad her grand father ever been to her f She laved her friend Martha much better. *1 Have you ever loved any one ?" she: asked that poor woman at this time. And a ted flush rose to the pale cheek. i ** The woman who has never loved is yet unborn," she said. "And was not that love the greatest joy of your life?" asked Margaret. "Even though it is past—as I suppose it is, for you seem very lonely—does it not give you happiness to remember it f" The woman clutched her by the arm. *• Margaret," ehe said, "love is wo raanh life ; it is sometimes her eternal blessing—oftener her eternal curse. Mine cursed me. Happiness! Ah ! good Hea ven 3 could you eee my bleeding heart I Child ! child ! beware of love ! Shun it 3 flee from it !" And Margaret pot aside the fancy she had had of confiding in Martha. * - They are all alike," she said—"all alike. No one ever loved as Ralph and I love. They cannot understand us." That day ehe kissed Martha fondly when she left her. She had promised her lover to leave home with him that night, and she knew that they might never meet again.

She had pte | pared her little bundle, and placed the tiny earn of money she possessed in the pocket of her drees. She had written a note to her grandfather and laid it on her unrumpled pillow. And now that the home was all still—even Jane, in spate of her terror, aeteep In her garret room— the girl crept downstairs and out into the orchard. The moon shone height; the path to the road was clear. She crept down it and opened the gate. A little way beyond a dark figure stood amongst the trees. It hastened forward. " My darling I" cried a soft voice. It was Ralph; all Margaret's terror va nished. She was with her lover ; she was safe. " A carriage stands at the foot of the lane,**he whispered. "'We will be be yond pursuit in an hour. Come, tny darl ing." But as she placed her hand in his and lifted her lips to his own, another figure, crouched until now in the shadow of the great pear tree beside the gate, arose and glided like a ghost between them. A white hoe turned itself toward Ralph Hariand, a white band waved him back ward. " Demon!" said a low, clear voice. " Black-hearted demon ! leave this poor girl, and go !" " Who are yon, who interfere ?" said Ralph. H Her mother 1" said the woman. Margaret screamed, in the white moon light, her head uncovered, her face pale as that of the dead, the face seemed that of a spirit. She did not recognise Martha, and, overcome by terror, fainted in her arms. And Martha, clasping the girl to her heart, repeated the command : '*Go !—leave her!" When she again opened her eyes, she was alone with the woman. She knew her face and voice now, and angrily shrunk from her. " Where is Ralph 1" she said. " How dated you interfere? How dared you pretend to be my mother ? Oh ! Ralph ! Ralph!" Bat the woman, tenderly bending over her, answered : " Ralph, as you call him, has gone for ever, I hope, if he has gone to his wife, he has done well, for he has one. And I interfered to save yon from destruction and disgrace, and, child, I did uot utter falsehood. I am your mother. Years ago, I left my lather's home at night, with one as had as Ralph. We were mar ried, and six months afterwards I learned that he had another wife ; and he finally fled to escape the county gaol. I only re turned to place you, my child, upon the step of the old homestead. On your lit tle breast lay a note . "Father," it said, "this child is Martha's child. She is named Margaret— after that blessed woman, Martha's mo ther, and your wife. May she be more grateful for your kindness, more dutiful, a better woman every way, than her wretched mother." " After that I worked honestly for my bread in a farmer's kitchen, but I could not refrain from seeing my child. Of ] late, I have seen the new hope that had f sprung np in her heart, and out of my j bitter experience grew fear that all was I not well. E have saved yon, darling. ] That man has a wife already. Under stand what I have saved you from." And Margaret sobbed upon her breast. " Yon must not leave me, mother," she Baid. And the woman answered : " I will go to my father and say—* Fa ther, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.'" En the dawn two women knelt before the old man, and he was not stem to them nor cruel; his lips pressed Mar garet's forehead, but he took Maltha to his heart.
