' Tbe heat was exoassive, and. the dust and glue trying to the strongest. Graham's health, shattered by his long ill ness, and by the terrible mental shocks which he had received, almost gave way under the strain, and one day about noon, just before the halt which generally took place at that hour for luneh, Graham fell' fainting from hisVlittle Arab horse. ', ; When he recovered consciousness a group of officers were standing hear him, and among them Graham recognised Major Despard. The doctor who had been attending on Graham helped him to rise, and ns he did so, Despard went forward and addressed .him: *,.So you have had a tumble?' he said. Graham smiled faintly. '',,..' ' Tlie heat is so terrible,' he saidi '.You don't look -oyer strong,' continued ? Despard, fixing h'felight grey eyes with a look of curious interest on Graham's face. Despard himself looked quite strong, and the long march hadan no way injured his splendid physique. His oomplexion-was tanned a dusky red, but otherwise he was sot changed, and seemed in.perfect health. 'He will never .see England again,' thought Despard, scanning Graham's, pale features, and noting how haggard he had grown, and the weary and desponding ex pression of his face. ' ' This idea brought a rush: of joy 'to Despard'a .heart, and in a light, almost Jeering tone, he now alluded to Katharine. 'I wonder what the. good people, are doing at this moment at Castle Hill,' he said; ' sitting cosily by -the, fire, I. dare say, while we are being broiled in the wilder ness!' * It is certainly a great change.' ? All life is full of change— it would not. 'be worth living forunless.it ware— and bo ?you would like to be back .now, Mr North, ?sitting by the fire at Dillford.?' M do not say bo,' answered Graham ?almost sternly. For there was a mocking ring in . Das tard's voice that jarred on Graham's ears, ?and a look of defiant joy in his .eyes. ?? It would be more luxurious than' this at any rate — especially if a man's conscience ? -were at ease enough to enjoy it, eh, Mr! Horth?' .';' . ? A: burning flush passed over Graham's face. . ' i . ' . ,. ' That pricks a fellow, even on a couch of ? down;' continued Despard, in the same: tone; 'and the memory of our evil deeds is a bad companion to stalk beside us in' the desert' ' ' I do not understand you,' said Graham, looking steadily in Despard'a face. ' Despard shrugged his broad shoulders. 'I should have thought you would,1 he said, ' my riddle ia easy enough to read— I . am coached up in scandals and tragedies of the Dill.' ? ' Do you mean to insult me, Major Des pard?' ? 'Take it as you please,' answered Des jiard; and fie turned away, leaving Graham full of tbe deepest indignation.
