MR. JOHN HAYNES. Wellington ' Times ' prints this dialogue about Mr. John Haynes : A. Then all this blatherskite about Norton going for a Sydney constituency is untrue ? B. Of course : John Norton will not decide for Wellington until he sees the iequi9ition. John Haynes, they tell me, says that he will give Norton a catting up. A, Yes, so I hear ; bat John HayneB iB blnffiDg again. He is all very well when he e left to himBelf. but John Nor ton is the boy to make the anti- federal Haynes sit np. JB. They tell me John Haynes is opposed to Federation. A. S' he is, and the reason is this, if we get Federation, John Hayoea, instead of being a member of Parliament, will have to content himself with contesting a municipal seat oat on the Namoi, where only blacks and chinamen vote. The people wonid not stand John Haynes at any price, look where he got in the Federal elections, somewhere at the bottom of the poll. B. John Haynes never expected to get into the Convention. He knew he bad not the ghost of a show, notwithstanding that he told us in Wellington that if he bad been out a week or a for might earl ier, aod bad been able to get all over the colony, that be wonld have been returned at the head of the poll. Just fancy â€” John HayneB being retnrned at the head of the Federal poll. A. Why, the man was bb mad as a March hare, or else tie thought the people were, when he tried to staff them with euch an opinion of his own ability. Where did that 8,000 votes from New castle come dn, which he said he was goiDg to get? Why, if he got 80 votes there it was as much as he did, and then half of them were given in mistake by electors who just missed having their voteB made informal.
