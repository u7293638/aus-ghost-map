THE SALVATION ARMY. TO THE EDITOR, Sir-Numerous correspondents are con tinually harping on the liberty of the subject and the great good done by the array, and I think that there cannot be two opinions on it, but why should the liberty of the subject be infringed by having his peace and that of hi3 family disturbed by music and other noises outside his house for which he pays rent. If a 1'unch and Judy show or an organ-grinder comes he can call a constable and have them moved on, as I myself talking with several others was once courteously asked by a police man, as he had "to obey his instructions. Then, I ask, why as a religious body ought the army not to be law-abiding citizens? and why should they be allowed to defy the law ? They certainly have a right, the same as the Police Band, to march through the streels, and no light-minded person would object to that. -1 am, &c.;, CI VIS. May 7,1SS7. Mr. F. M. Poulden writes-" The facta re lating to 'Fisher's ghost,' as told me by a reliable friend who hailed from New South Wales, are as follows:-One Fisher and another were many years since in partnership ns sheepfarmers in that colony. Suddenly Fisher was missing, and, on enquiry, it waa explained that he had merely taken a trip to England. Subsequently a belated buahman, who knew the parties well, when riding by the head station, saw what he thought was Fisher sitting on a rail fence; but presently the apparition got down and disappeared in an adjacent lagoon. The bushman reported accordingly, but none would credit his tale. Months after, however, a mounted trooper witneaseda similar phenomenon, theresult being that the lagoon or swamp was drained by order of the authorities and the remains of Fisher were discovered in it. The murderer waa duly convicted, confessed his guilt, and stated that he had deposited the body in about the same spot where it was found. The records of the Supreme Court would of course show whether my informant was wrong or not,"
