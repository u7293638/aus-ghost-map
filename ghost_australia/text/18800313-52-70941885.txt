Cricket. THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN. BY AH EHQLIBH CRICKETER,,. TUB cricketers who, for tho second time, or« about to represent at home the progress of the noblo game tn Aus tralia, have played thoir last matoh but one ut the land of the Southern Cross. A very remarkable matoh it proved to be. Bad weather and bad grounds have reduced most of the contests of thc Australian team to tho lovel Of "bowlers* matches," and in tho present case batsmen fought against every disadvantage. The ni&toh; was post poned for a week, on account of rain, and when the ooni batants did appear cn floe field of battlo they found a very moderate attendance, onda very disgusting wicket. Under the cirouuistoncesit is creditable that tho Eleven made tho rospeotable soore of 2C2 in their first innings. The bat ting was well sustained throughout. Eight ployer» got into substantial double figures, tho honours of the day, as often happons, being carried off hythe two batsmen who wara loatft "fancied." Palmer's 81 were well got, and Slight's 40 embodied % specially noticeable display pf patient and ecientífle cricket. 'Would that he wore always thus. Mr. B. B. Coopor committed, a pardonable error of: judgment in Banding life Cppononts to the wickets. He waa ia h«pe» -that tho wickefctepuld improve, whereas it steadily deteriorated throughout' übe match. But for Hor;m, Torry, and G rori bc the score ol tito Tif teen munt havo been rl<U culouê. Horari*.8 62 waa,tie best display of batting in tho match, eave perhaps Slight's first innings. However, Mr.-Cooper had bia revenge. H. tka.^ioJieV was bad for the Tliteen, it was worse for the Sloven when thoy eqmnionced their second essay. It {developed, ir crin a icoist swamp into a remote eonutry road very rqnen oat of order. Tho best batsmen of tho ie-. presebtr.Wve team went down Bie ripe corn be fore ttm.rçapcr. .Boyle's St, and ll sundries, , saved tho pCKW BC«W -oi CO from absolute non-entity. Tho fine wea ther whieÄ l»et«d. from Saturday evening urítíí Monday moraine' only in^c» p > rt iu.1 improvement an lijo eondition of the turf : 'Afti-r tibe f-'5.) and Tobin (I5)'had been diapoftsd of, the ?« t.-t loll KO rapidly na to cause tho .gravest doubts aii ti. whether the requisite' total (Wi) wonCi bo leached. Tau midest excitement prevailed when tho thirteenth wicket fell and half a seor» of russ were required in order to win. The best batsman was -Horan, who apparently displayed moro indiff¿renos to. tho fate- of tho match than any other individual present, tte was sean sauntering ontsido tho boundaries in,a very easy wajr, when n group el admiring friends tnd Gympo thlseraBÍizéd npon him. He was conducted to tba wickets. In a f ew nita he won the match Adherencoto tho strict law would have saved the Eleven, for Horan oertoinly did not " como np to time." But in waiyingtUe letter of th« law tho Eleven showed a cricketing spirit, which will make them inony friends. 'Hie game wa« finely played throughout, allowing always for the faot that the State of tho ground was inimieisl to batting. Tho field ing of thci Elovon, especially towards, tho dose of the second innings, was trpleodid; and tho bowling of Spo'ûorth, when all seemed lost, waa a sight to see. A defeat by a.single wicket dous not »mount to a rout. Tuero wau not a man in tho Flftetui for whom an average English county would not bo thankful. The Eleven who ore proceeding to England include the two Bannerroans, Murdoch, Boyle, Blackhaui, and Spofïorth, who formed part of tire memorable team that firr.t visited England. JX Gregory, Horan, Garrett, Allan, ona Baileyuxe wanting. Midwinter has becomo on English cricketer, and it is cot to bo supposed that ho can ropresont GlonceBtershiro and Australia at tho samo time. Reviewing the new team ono is struck at onco with the immense advantage thoy will derive from superiority of numbers, i Tho " Eleven " aro. in fact, thirtoon. Every' cricketer who followed tho movements of the first eleven must know how seriously they woro hampered by. thoir limited numbera. Illness tried ono or two mem ber* o' the tenn, and ovorwork tried them all. Hence, whenever tho Eleven wore unable to niustor tho regulation number from legitimate sources, they had to supply vacancies by means of odds and ends, BU ch as Hy slop, a third-rate county man, and Mr. J. Conway, who asBurodly had enough on bis shoulders iii tho shape of busi ness management. This kind of mÍ3tako will not be re peated. The team aro taking with thom an adequate reserve for all piobablo chances. This is an immonso ad vantage, which must tell throughout the campaign. Aa regards the new men, Garrett muv bo considered us fairly represented by Alexander. Victorians licit) that the second is " worth any two" of tho first, but colonial patriotism is generally hyperbolic. It is trna that Alex ander ia hnirrovmg, whereas Garrett has made no advances of Into. IE the Victorian perform in England, u3 well ns did tho Sydney player, tho OUCCOBB of tho Eleven will not suif of. Palmer may fairly bo paired elf against Allan. Tho latter is not tho bowler that he wat", whilst Pal mer bas recently made great progress in all departments of tho game. Jarvis is a satisfactory substitute for Bailey, and his admission to tho team extends the area ot repre sentation. On this ground, it in a pity that tho Tasmanian could not take part in the new venture. M'Donnell or Bonner fairly rex-resent D. Gregory an a bateman, and his plaoe aa captain has boon taken, hitherto not unworthily, by Boyle. Two losses are irreparable. The C. Bannerman who now apnears on oricket-gronnds is only tho ghost of tho player wo used to know. It.is to bo hoped that the health ol this admirable playerwill soon be so tar restored aa to.eaablo him to do justice to him self. Of the prosent generation of oriokotors wo might mention sevt ral who surplus him in style, but not one who i escola him in moults, except Mr. W. G. Grace. Horan is not going with tho team. Victorians claim him as the first of Australian batsmen, and it is clear that at present tho championship lies between him lind Murdoon. His absence from the team ls a misfortune; but as ne performed' only moderately in England, it is thought that ho will not bo missed. We fear ho will. Por two or three «easons past the weather in England has beon very unfavourable to bats men. As it is a long Inno that haB no turning, wa may fairly assume that 1830 will be a run-getting year ; ana should such be tho case, tho services of a player like Horan will be greatly wanted. Tho opinionu that havo been mooted respecting tho reception tho Eleven will meet within England are wide of the "-ark. Cricket in England is, of all national pas times, tho most unselfish and tho most rational. Tho notion that a number of strangers will be treated with discourtesy, booauso a row'took place at Sydney lat which only four of tho new team woro prosont), is simply grotesque. Tho mei'i.J of thc' fracas aro not worth consider ing. It is forgotten, but tho lessons; that tho visit of Conwnj-'s Eleven tanght EugliEh cricketers still linger in their minds. Boyl/j and his friends wiil receive every consideration, and (what is more) groat paius will bo taken to bring against thom the best men that are avail able. A oavot-r of success-except, 'perhaps, against the most powerful elevens ot amateurs-may safely be pre dicted for them. But ono delusion they must guard against. They will not moot with tho reception accorded to Con way'» team ; they will bo triatett ascriekoters. The first team was looked upon as a social phenomenon.
