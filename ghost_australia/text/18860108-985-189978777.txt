" They undoubtedly will be murdered/' replied Marie. " If only Paul—" She stopped abruptly. Did he accom pany Charette, who still was fighting victoriously ?

He held out, bis arms to her, and had folded her in .a fervent embrace. Ma dame de Turgis was .nearly distracted with joy; her son was once more with her. She ordered Henri to barricade all entrances to the eastle, so as to guard them from every surprise. All her fears were now allayed.

Some of our soldiers held Fort Penthievre, on the Peninsula of Qui beron. The terrible contest at the foot of the fort lasted four days.

Having arrived there, she longed to see Paul once. more. She stepped out on the balcony and softly ap prbached Ids windows. The ,curtains were drawn back. Her brother knelt beside his bed. His hands, were clasped above his head, as if muttering a paa-y sionate prayer. Maxie listened intently; she heard d^ep-drawn sobs. At last he raised himself ; his'face was deadly pale.. He set a small alarm clock and placed It oh the table: His Bister did not dare to disturb him. She returned to her room. As'soon as she entered there was a knock at the door, and Henri, the old Ochvant, appeared. " ; , " What is the matter'? What has hap-' pened to my brother ?" she asked in a half-stifled voibe. ■"Oh, mademoiselle, yon alone ckn' save him ; you alone can keep him from going; you—so dearly loved—*' • "*What is it ?

Oh God, why did you not spare us this f* While the old man was thus lamenting, Marie's face flashed, her fignra seemed to grow more erect. She surveyed herself in the opposite mirror with something skin to pride. Then she said qnietly— " My brother must not die; he shall not die. Do not awake him—everything will be well." " I will do just as you say, mademoi selle. What would your mother do if she did not possess him V Henri left her. His fears were al layed by the tranquil words of bis mis tress. Marie felt that there was butone course left. Yes—she would suoceed. The moments were precious; it was al ready past midnight. She seated her self at the table and wrote a few lines, leaving thdm unsealed. She cut off her heavy mass\of dark hair and placed it beside the note.

Id deadly terror, for lt was already day, he sprang from his; conch. His- cloak andhis uniform were gone. He seized an old'hnoting suit, dressed; himself quickly, and har ried oat of the room. Henrirushed up to him with upraised hands. 1 " What time is it ?" Said the young mandesperately. "It is too late/' the old servant an swered, tremulously. "Miserable man, you know not what that is to mel" :•:•'• ; " I- know it "j it concerns your life." "It concerns my honour, and that is hiore. Scarry and get1 any ' horse. I most go away without disturbing any? one. I wished to see them once more. This • wae the reason of my coming. I nave given- my word to retprii in time. Now, -a«ay, away!" . • At that moment Madame de Tnrgis came rushing up to him. Although they had spoken in hushed voices, she bad heard part of their conversation. She was extremely agitated. " What is the matter? What have I heard V' she gaBped. ' "Keep him bade; the prisoners, of whom he is one, will be shot this morn ing." " My bob ! my son! Yon must not die 1 Your death will be mine !" She d&sped; him in her arms>asif to draw him from-the brink of a precipice. Inthemeantime Henri hurried to Marie's room, hoping that Paul could not withstand the united entreaties of mother and siBter. He knocked again; Btill silence reigned. He took an old ser vant's privilege to open the door. He hastened hack to his master, who tried to free 'himself frpm Louise's, embrace, add who also had been aroused from her ,. ff Marie has gone; her bed has not bpen touched." One thought hashed simultaneously through their minds. They rushed to her room. Paul was the first to see the note. It contained the following : " Dearest Brother—Yon shall not die, and your , honour will.be saved. , Live and comfort onr dear mother. Tell ber not to grieve for me. I gladly give my own life for yours. Farewell my be loved ones! In heaven we will meet again. Mabib.'' " And shall I let my sister perish 1" cried Paul, wildly. - He rushed-away. At the foot of the stairs'stood his groom, who looked as if he saw a ghost. " "Is ifc-reaSiy- master ? - Who waa then the victim who wore your uniform ' rT-t -waa mjr sister! Oh, unhappy mortal that I. am ! She haB sacrificed herself for me." He pressed both hands against his breast, all the blood seeming suddenly to stagnate about his heart. He felt as though life and senses were forsaking him, and then, struck as it were by a flash of lightning, he fell senseless. Ma dame de Turgis, despite her inexpress able grief, felt that she most do every thing to save her son. She almost blessed the unconsciousness that had come over him. After the swoon was over he was raving with fever. Often he cried: " Panl de Turgis—here," or " fire !" Then again, " Keep her back, keep her back!" The name day, Louise, disguised as a peasant girl, and accompanied by Henri and their groom, went to Vannes. The dead, over seven hundred, were still awaiting their burial. After an hour's search they found Marie. Her glassy eyes still betrayed the restless look with which she had scanned the distance, fear ing to the last her brother's arrival.
