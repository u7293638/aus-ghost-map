The Church and Science. It is becoming daily more evident that the investi gation of physical forces has not yet produced re sults which could shake a reasonable man's belief in revelation. The argu ments, which a quarter of a century back were re garded as powerful indictments against the Church, are now being shorn of all their original force. Men are no longer made infidels by discoveries which show an apparent, but nota real, divergence from religious truth. A better understanding of both science and revelation has conduced to this result. Perhaps the best example which might be quoted is that upon which all such controversies used formerly to turn—viz., the teachings of Genesis. Every Catholic child now knows that according to the Sacred Book the world was created in six days. But geologists have shown that the world has existed for a very much greater period than a literal accepta tion of the Bible would lead one to be lieve. It was subsequently found that the "days" were not in the original Hebrew text days of twenty-four hours' duration, but were periods of indefinite length. This discovery, by the way, was not a nine teenth century one by any means, nor was it, strictly speaking, a discovery of scien tists. St. Augustine had already men tioned it, and in one place says, " All things may have been created instantane ously, but only potentially so created. During long intervals of time the various forms of the world may have arisen slowly out of potentiality into actuality." and so on with many other discoveries. The church has never claimed infallibility in matters of science—all theologians admit that. But where a supposed science had an important influence upon religion, in fact where it by erroneous doctrines tends to undermine faith or morals, then the church steps in with her infallible teaching. Catholics have thus the advantage of a teaching power which has been promised the spiritual guidance of the Holy Ghost till the end of time.
