and nickel s up, at los a week nnd food , for shoaring 18s per hundred wera paid, aud as a first class shearer can dip eighty sheep a day, tho average hand can do about fifty or sixty-the earnings of each mau would bo from 9s to lös per day, tho men finding themselves At the stations thoy eau purchaso meat and flour at about cost price, and sleeping room costs thom nothing It is gratifying to notice an improvement in the shearers as a class many of whom aro far mers of small means from Victoria, and soma of thom have grown up sons, and thoy possess drays and bullocks, so that m each shearing season m Southorn Riverina a farmer, with two or three sons and a team, could earn £100 while his crops are growing Thus ono interest supporta an other It must bo very short Bightod per sons who would preach that the squatting and farming interests aro m any way opposed to each other The chargo for convoying tho w no1 to tho tormmuB of tho Melbourne and Murray River line at Echuca from Coree, a distaneo of about 100 miles, is 80s per ton, with a bonus of 5s or in some cases 10s per ton, if tho wool is delivered within ten days Each dray can very well tako from twenty to twenty four bales of 300 lbs each, or, Bay throe tons of wool, and by industry, with perseverance and sobriety, four trips caa thus be mado, notting about £a0 eaeh team for the season Tho o3,000 sheop at Coree (tboro aro 14,000 lambs-theso are not to bo shorn) aro expected to turn out about 150,100 lbs weight of clean wool, or roughly estimated at 67 tous, and as each fleece is expected to bo wo-tk 5s at least -making a total of £13 250 for tho season's clip The amount paid for shearing would be £.177, to which may bo added about twenty per cent for assistants, of (say) £600 and tbo car- riage would
