AUSTRALIAN PROGRESS, THE WEALTH OP THE COLONIES COMPARED. [The Rtvieio of Beyieies.'] \ A SECTION OF THE EMPIRE. \ Australia is a country of magnificent distancés, and yet how little tljie Australian realises how magni- ficent these distances are, or how great in mere scale and spaci ousness is the land he inhabits, yet it is only when Australia is men-t sured against the old and crowded lands of tho world, or the rest of the* Empire itself, that we can get any adequate idea of its scale. Australia is more than 26 times as large as the ; United Kingdom, more than fifteen: times as large as France, more than half as large again as. Russia in Europe, or to the United States of America. The area of Australasia is con- siderably more than one-fourth of the whole ¿ of the British Empire. It is clear we have geographical room in Australia for a dozen great Powers. But the realisation, ot' the generous . distances and magnificent area of our island continent brings with it . a Bénse of how tiny the Australian himself is. It is possible to.^plot on tB'e map of Australia the whole .of Europe (omitting Russia) representing a cluster of countries that carry a population of 250,000,000 people, and still leave thrëe-fifths of the map uncovered. And yet Aus- tralasia, with twice the area of country, carries a population of only 5,000,000 people. Again, while the continent forms, in area, more than a quarter of the Empire, Australian people number ' only about one seventh pf its total popu- lation. It is only necessary to pic- ture the population of any one colony set in relief against the spacious background ot its hun- dreds of thousands of square miles of country to realise, most vividly, how vast Australia is, and how tiny the Australian himself seems. It is pleasant also to note that not alone is Australasia advancing in population, but the rate of advance itself is rapid, as compared with the rest of the Empire. Sir Robert Giffen, perhaps England's greatest statistician, in a paper on thé " Growth of the Empire," shows that the population of Australia has, during the , last quarter-century, easily outstripped in its rate of increase that of British . ^ North America and of India, till it now represents nearly one-tenth "of the English-speaking peoples of the Empire. It is with satisfaction and a decided increase of self-respect that the Australian reads Sir Robert Giff en's report of our revenue and trade as compared with the rest of the Empire. These are' shown to have increased in like proportion to population. And when, finally, the Board of Trade in London credit Australasia with a revenue just under £31,000,000-equal to' a third of that of India itself-the Aus- tralian realises in some degree, and regards with a certain amount of complacency, the part these colonies play in the Empire. . POPULATION: OP THE COLONIES. The respective population of the colonies in 1897 were : New South Wales..;....,....... 1,323,400 . Victoria...;..:.;.1,176,205 New Zealand. 729,058 Queensland. 484;700 South Australia....;.. 303,014 Tasmania ...'..;. 171,710 West Australia .................. 161,024 Since then there has been a net increase of about 70,000. New South Wales has 250,00 more inhabitants, and the other colonies-except Victoria and West Australia, which have decreased-have shared in the rise. Victoria's population has only increased 1500 since 1893 ; but while she bas now 16,100 moré females, she has lost 14,600 of her male popula- tion. The population of west Australia, on the other hand, :ad vanced by leaps and bounds till 1897,' but for-1898 shows a decrease. THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE COLONIES The total area of Australasia is 3,16i;458 square; miles. . West Aus- tralia could accommodate close on twenty " Englands," South Australia could set several " England's .' playing hide-and-seek in her terri- tory, . whilst levon Victoria, with England's area deducted, could supply land for a kingdom or two of the size of Switzerland or Den- mark out of the surplus. The only colony smaller than England and Wales is Tasmania, whose surface measurement" is 26,219 square miles. WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE. Whilst an equal division of land would give every West Australian 3,840 acres-a. fair-sized station-the Victorian would receive .a mere cabbage-garden of some forty-eight acres as his portion on the roll. : An interesting point in the distribution of tho people is that, with such a vast area at their disposal, very nearly half of them are found in the big cities. Thus in 1897 the capital cities alone held 1,249,617 of a popu- lation, numbering 4,410,151, the detailed population of each city being : Melbourne .;. 458,010 Sydney. 417,250 Adelaide .I."140,125 Brisbane..105,734 Wellington. 44,007 Hobart. 30,172 Perth. 38,020 THE TRADE OP AUSTRALIA. The value of the trade of each colony in 1897 totalled £138,099,106. These figurés, however, are expres- sive of the value of the imports and exports, and not the actual products or manufactures of the colonies. Thus West Australia has a trade of over £10,000,000-equal to about £69 per head of the population-but her enormous Customs revenue shows that a great proportion of thia sum represents the imports of the neces- saries of life. IMPORTS AND EXPORTS £132,089,037 N.S.W..£43,405,422 Victoria .:.£32,194,152 South Australia .£14.317,836 New Zealand.£18.072,216 Queensland.-.£14,520.748 West Australia.£10,358,663 THE TOTAL. PRODUCTS OP THE YEAR. The number of dry seasons which have followed on each other's heels up to the end of 1897, and have been so. general throughout the continent, have seriously handicapped the increase of Australian products. Almost every interest has been affected ; sheep have died by the million, cattle by the thousand, the very wool has suffered in quality as well as in the quantity, grain harvests have shrunk, and, in some districts, disappeared for seasons, lin spite of this drawback, however, ,ihe total products of Australasia amounted to 114i million pounds ííterlingin 1897. New South Wales leads the other colonies with products, valued at 33f millions sterling, but Victoria, , with her steadily increasing gold resources, makes a good second with over 30 raillions. New Zealand with an area of country very little greater than Victoria, and a population half that of'Victoria or New South Wales in sjze, is third, with the splendid record of 21j millions sterling. Queensland, South Australia, Tas- mania, and. West Australia follow in ttfp order named. Queensland has, during 1898 and the first quarter of the present year, shown a decided increase in several departments, rand has improved her position in the list. \It is interesting here to compare What might be called the1 square mile productiveness bf the various colonies.

Products.£114,460,000 Of course the immense stretches of practically valueless land in West Australia and, Queensland naturally bring, down . their average ; and, indeed, it is a striking fact that the scale of products per square mile pf the colonies is exactly the reverse of that of their area, as follows :-.

With the exception of Tasmania and Western Australia, the pastoral industry ranks first in the sources^ of wealth of each of these colonies. The people of the " Golden West," of course, have been strenuously deve- loping and exploiting the immense mineral deposits of the colony, the tale of whose richness and scale has made men's mouth water - indeed, often , gape-the world over. It .is not to Tbe wondered, therefore, that the agricultural and pastoralist interests of West Australia are still only partially developed. The total return from pastoral pursuits in Australia in 1897 reached £46,000,000. From 'the table printed herewith it will be seen that the mother colony contributed no less than one-third of the total sum. The exact figures are : New South Wales...£16,240,000 New Zealand.............;.... ... 0,080,000 Victoria. 9,050,000 Queensland '. 7,000,000 South Australia . 2,800,000 West Australia. 1,001,000 Tasmania......... 822,000 ',' ' ' ? (To be continued.) F PAPAL CORONATION.--The celebra- tion of the twenty-first anniversary of the Pope's coronation took place on April 16th at St. Peter's. The procession passed up between a double line of troops around the high altar to the throne, on which the Pope sat, with the sacred college in front of him., On the right and left when his' Holiness appeared, carried on a sedia gestatoria, there were cries of "Long live the Pope and King," and cheers, mingled with the martial music, went up through the vast edifice, irecheering with a mighty roar of thousands of voices. It was a grand and impressive sight, a magnificent note of colour being contributed by the nobles' guard in gala uniform, and. canons, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals in their robes. While mass was being said the bells all over Rome wore rung. The golden chair came into view as if floating toward the altar with the Pope sitting like a pale shadow, like a ghost, many whispered, when his face over-shadowed by the glittering triple crown, became discernible. His dark eyes peered from their deep sockets, his hands trembled visibly, and a sad smile played on his colourless lips. With his left hand he waved sad greetings, while with his right he did his feeble best to mark the act of blessing. . Turkey has been engaged in wai thirty-eight years bf the present century, considerably more than one-third of the time ; Spain comes next with thirty- one years of war ; France has had twenty-seven years; Russia, twenty-four ; Italy, twenty three; England, twenty-one ; Austria, seventeen ; Holland, fourteen ; Ger- many, thirteen; Sweden, ten; Portugal, ten ; Denmark, nine. Much of this is for reckoning of the First Napoleon. . .Revolution in the Tobacco Trade. Vf. D. and H. 0.'
