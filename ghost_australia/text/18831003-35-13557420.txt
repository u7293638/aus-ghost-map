TEN NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET ASSOCIATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-As an old cricketer, and one to he occupied the position of a representative of one of the leading clubs in connection with the lion South Wales Cricketing Association, I cannot but say that it is a matter for very much regret that a HUSO is alleged to exist for a reform to be brought about in the manage ment of the Association Cricket Ground It appears to me, and I think it will appear to in very large portion of the crit feting community, that the decision of the president, in so far as the local interrelation of the trust deed is concerned, gives the trustees absolute cost -of or on the ground, and to interest some of the members of the association may think of the arbitrariness of the provisions of the deed, they cannot shut their eyes to the fact that the trustees are not exercising the powers conferred upon them it should not be overlooked that at the time of the granting of the ground much dissolute it (ion tins shown at the way in which cricketers were alleged to have been treated by the tiiauaf,ciiient of the Albert Ground Company, and, as far as I know, motor-cars is raised against the conditions of the reservation of the accelerator control of the Albert Ground by gentlemen if he had always manifested the 1 ghost interest in entitling affairs, until the organization of the clubs necessitated increased accommodation We know then it hut followed 1 lim Albert Ground Company seated in line arran till i interference, and disposed of their interest in a manner quite uncongenial to the tastes of their assailants. And are we going to have a similar occurrence in connection n til the Association Grow day I inn ready to admit that the constitution of the management of the Albert Ground Company this very different to the constitution of that of the Association Ground , nevertheless, the action of the members of the association in the matter of interfering with the leg till constituted body, and the curtailing of their representation may be fairly regarded to be a proceeding calculated to seriously interfere with the progress of society in this colony. Iheremnvbo some details in the management of the ground values require attending to somewhat differently to the way in which then have been attended to in the past, but who can for a moment think that the trustees have not born alive to the discharge of the duties they have voluntarily taken upon themselves to perform, when they compare the Association Ground ad lib the old Civil and Military it Bupoidcdid ? the present ground is admitted to run for the finest in the world, and that fact alone, I think, should he one of the strongest recommendations for a continued reposing of confidence in the trustees. But supposing the representation no much coveted by the association was practicable, what benefit would it gain if it was taken advantage of of Whatever pecuniary gum is experienced through the playing of cricket it is laid out in the improvement of the ground, and both the cricketers and the patronising public enjoy the benefit of it. If, however, I a diminution of the proofs he sought for the enrichment of competing clubs and the impoverishment of the ground exoneration, then the desires of the association TV would be gratified at a cost which would lead to difficulties the character of which in only in the parcel by a fog the comparisons between cricket and athletics do not improve the situation, and if Von serious unpleasantnesses are to be avoided and market generally advanced, it would be well for to sink the present differences, and work amicably together I hope it will be so. I am, eve. JOSEPH COULTER. Itandwicfc, Sept. 21. V
