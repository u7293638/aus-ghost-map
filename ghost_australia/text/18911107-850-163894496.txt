Death of Mr. Arthur O'Keefe. We are sorry to record the death of Mr. A. O'Keefe, of Loganlea. Mr. O'Keefe was one of the earliest settlers on the Logan Reserve in 1862. He arrived in the colony by the celebrated Erin-go-Bragh emigrant ship under the auspices of the late Bishop Quinn and the Rev. Father Dunn of land order fame. Mr. O'Keefe was a native of the county of Cork and was brought up at the foot of the celebrated Galtee mountains, the abode in those days of fairy tales, of ghosts, the midnight prowlers, the White- boys and the Blackboys. He was a most sincere believer of the supernatural, and could delight a patient listener with stories quite ahead of Mrs. Bessnt, Madame Blavatsky, or the modern Madame Bur- lesque. He needed no Koothoomi to waken up the most wonderful and mar- vellous stories from the folk lore of the South of Ireland. And he firmly believed the stories himself. Irish-like, how- ever, he knew the difference between the hard solid matter of fact life and work of a Queensland farmer, and the amusing romances of blustering and empty blowing. He carefully and rigidly stuck to milk and butter ; and, until lately from old age, was an active worker amongst his cattle. He realised a fair share of comfort and died near upon his 80th year. He was interred in the Catholic Cemetery yesterday at the Logan Reserve.
