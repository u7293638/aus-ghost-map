( :o: ) ' MACBETH. '/ Mr. Thomas Kenny, a clever cssay- \ ist, and who has written most ably on ( the subject of " Macbeth," characttr- ) ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime \ and terror relieved by the most niag- / nificent imaginative expression," .yet ) marked with great simplicity oi general J design. The date of the produciion of ( the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6, ) and "we may. take it for granted," \ says Kenny, " that it was written in r the time of James the Firet, who ascended the throne March, 1603, as it V contains an evident allusion to that ( monarch in act iv, scene I, and also a ) complimentai-y reference to him in an- ' other part. Tire material for the play / was. found by Shakespeare in HoHn- ) shed's Plistory of Scotland, where the C story of Maciieth is told at page 168." / The Macbeth and Duncan are rejire- 1 sentcd to have been cousins,; the. first ( a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- ) sition, and the latter "so soft and \ gentle in his nature that the people t wi.shed the inclination and manners of ) the two to have been so tempered and » intqrchaiigcably shared betwixt them C that Avherc the one had too much of ) clemency and the other' of cruelty, the J main virtue between these two extrc- f mities might have reigned by indifler- ) ent partition in tliem both. The play \ all along keeps close to the line of / Holinshed, varying from it in scarcely Y iiny particular except in the non- ' appearance in the banquet scene of the ( murdered Banquo's ghost." » This tragedy has been presented in f. Melbounie we believe oflener than any / other of Shakespeare's works. The \ late G. V. Brooke, Charles Kean, f Charle.s Vincent, in their time essayed / the part, and we have had other repre- \ sentativcs, fiom the burly McKean Buchanan and James Anderson to the ) little dapper J. B. Howe. But few \ artists have made their Melbourne debut in the o'Sle of the Thane of Caoc- ) dor. Of those who have, we now call \ to mind Mr. C. W. Bari-y, at the The- ( atre Royal, July 2, i860, Mrs. Charles POple.supporting him. as Lady iMacji'V lyatlv, MA Henry Edw'ardi As'llacd%0,li \- Irs.
