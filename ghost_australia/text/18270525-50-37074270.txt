REFINEMENTS OF THE VULGAR—A great change has taken place in the language and manners of the mob within a few years. Our populace, which used formerly to be re markable for their brief and too significant forms of speech, are now distinguished for the pre-eminent finery of their expressions ; they used also to scoff at aristocratical distinc tions, and make jests even of the names of respect, which they now adopt and bestow on each other with an air of grave punctilio inexpressibly droll. " Man" and " woman" were the terms of address of old among the lower classes ; but they have given place to 'gentleman' and ' lady.'— Our mobs are now composed of gentlemen and ladies. St. Giles's swarms with gentlemen and ladies. If two chimney sweepers are taking their friendly glass of gin at the door of the public-house, the landlord, when he hands the liquor to the one, will be directed by him to "help that gentleman first," meaning the other sooty personage. The same po liteness of address prevails amongst the fish-women, bar- row-women, char- women, basket-women, &c.; they are all ladies. It is "this lady," and " that lady" with them, not only in their amicable communings, but often even in the heat of battle. Thus we have heard of a virago who ex plained, in the Parliamentary language, thus—" It wan't you, ma'am, what I called b—b—, it was t'other lady what I called b—b—.' The gentlemen too, as they never deny the title to each other, are extremely jealous of any appear ance of its being denied to themselves. Thus, at a police office, the other day, when a witness, in giving evidence against a thief, used the expression, "and so I found him out," the rogue's pride taking the alarm at the familiarity of the pronoun, he stopped the deponent in the midst of his story, to remark, "found him out, indeed ! I think you might as well have said gentleman." The fellow did not care about being proved a thief, but he could not endure to be described in other terms than those of a gentleman. As all our ragamuffins are gentlemen, so- they are of course all Misters. Some time ago we asked a ragged, vagabond' ur chin, what his name was ? and he gave a gracious permission to address him by his style, in these words—You may call me Mr. Helas.' At the public meetings of journeymen and labourers, all the speakers are Misters.' There was a time when these honest fellows would have spurned at an assump tion which did not belong to them ; but their ideas have un- dergone a change, and instead of making jest of their bet- ters they seem now content that their betters should make a jest of them for their ridiculous pretensions. The language of the mob is as aspiring as their titles. The lower we de scend in life, the more lofty we find the style of the collo quy, the finer the expressions, the more circuitous the phrases. Certain common words are.completely exploded among the vulgar. The Maritornes at an ale-house does not ask the guest whether he will have any thing to eat or drink, but whether he will take any refreshment. Eating and drinking are quite out with our gentlemen and ladies— they refresh themselves, with onion and Cheshire cheese, and gin and beer. Their ideas are now so fine on the subject of diction, that it is a perilous thing to speak before them, unless we dress our discourse in the very grandest articles in our voca- bulary ; for if they suspect any default in elegance or pro priety of expression, or correctness of pronunciation, they pick us up without mercy. We once asked a boatman at Southend, whether there was not a cart to carry one ashore over the long sand that runs but there ? The man looked at us with considerable contempt ; and, thinking it of more consequence to correct our speech than to satisfy our curio sity, echoed and then amended our words—' To carry one ashore! A carryWAN you mean, Sir:'' 'This was one of those emendations that, as Johnson says, raise the comment tator, above the author ; and our critic lost none of the ad vantage of it, for we never from that moment could get him to treat us with any kind of consideration. He looked down with too much contempt on the ignorance that could allow us to talk of a cart to carry one, instead of a carrywan. The gentlemen of the newspapers; like the gentlemen of the mob, delight in roundabout phrases and fine expressions. Nobody, ever sees the word lightning in a newspapers-it is always the electric fluid. The sea is in entire disuse— At is always, in defiance of geography, ' the briny ocean,' even in the Straits of Calais'; or, in defiance of fact, ' unfathom able deep.' Thanks to the careless natures of servants, and the combustible natures of our houses, fire is the subject of five or six paragraphs in every journal ; but who ever sees so vulgar a thing as fire mentioned, beyond the heading des criptive of the event?— when we come to the particulars, we, find, that all the mischief has been done by the " devouring element.' Dancing used formerly to be mentioned, being considered a sufficiently expressive word ; but now nobody dances in newspapers—people "trip it on the light fantast tic toe.' Does the party break up at daybreak'? No ; they did not formerly, but now, in the paragraphs, they break up when "Aurora, with rosy fingers, unbars the portals of the East.' Ladies were, of old, with child; this phrase gave place to pregnant ; then they were, by a further improve- ment, "in the state in which women wish to be who love their lords; ' now they are neither " with child,'' nor "preg- nant,', nor are they " in the state in which women wish to be who love their lords,'' but, they are enceinte— that is the last refinement. We never now read of thieves—they are depredators, and the young rogues are juvenile delinquents. Cut-throats at the foot of the gallows are the unfortunate men ; and any crime short of murder, if committed by gen teel persons, is termed an affair. Murder itself cannot be considered' in a very serious light; seeing that the perpetra- tors of it are only unfortunate—people to be pitied rather than blamed, when they come— not to be hanged— such a coarse phrase is unknown, but ''to suffer the awful sentence of the law," and to be " launched into eternity." The commonest things are sublimated too, like the worst subjects, by poetic phrases, or the substitution of the des- criptipn of their sufficiently notorious qualities for their mere names. Meat we saw,; the other day, described in a print, as "that very nutritious article of food." Strong beer is " the intoxicating beverage;" wine is never now mentioned —it is always " the juice of the grape." Drunk is a word of unseen vulgarity ; a fellow, roaring and reeling drunk with gin, is represented in the newspaper as one ''flushed with the Tuscan grape." Some of the leaders of our journals, in their anxiety to steer clear of those extraordinary refinements of the vulgar, run into a familiarity and boldness of expression which is often as amusing as the other style is offensive. The leading articles of the Morning Herald are sometimes uncommonly familiar in their style. A short time ago that paper exhorted government to 'stir itself about'— ' Why does not go- vernment stir itself about ?' The phrase conveys very odd ideas and conjures up images by no means savoury. The Times, too, whose style is at once plain and pompous— like a warm man, who, dresses himself simply, but bears himself proudly—now and then startles us by a queer phrase ; such, for instance, as this—"they (the country journals) dare not wog a pen?' 'When the general style is inflated, these sud- den descents into familiarity strike one as ludicrous. But when many columns of a paper are filled with those fine flourishes which we have noted the journalist, in vindication of his own taste, perhaps, thinks. it necessary to show that he is not ashamed to be homely on occasion.—(London Paper.) The annexed letter is a curious sort of thing, and purports to have emanated from some of the prisoners who joined in the late mutiny at Norfolk Island. It is their statement of this affair; and true or false, it is what they have put forth, and we give it to our Readers — worth little or worth much. To the Editor of The Australian. Sydney gaol, May 7, 1827. HONORED SIR,—I humbly hope you will pardon the liberty we take in addressing you on this subject; but it is with a view to give your Honor a full statement of the late mutiny which took place on Norfolk Island; which, as we were some of the principal actors in it, you may depend on having it verbatim. In the first instance, it was in contemplation for upwards of three months — during which time, we were in a state of actual starvation; and although there was the greatest abun- dance of every sort of fruit, vegetables, pigs, goats, and every thing necessary for the support of man, yet we would not be allowed to touch even a single grape. If we were only caught a quarter of a mile from the camp, we were sure of being punished. Seeing we were dealt with such severity, we were determined the first opportunity to take the settlement. Two men took the bush, and the Commandant ordered out the military in quest of these two men. (I un- derstand that it was communicated to you, that they were in quest of meat, which is utterly false.) When we found that there was only twenty men in the garrison, we immedi- ately commenced the attack on the morning of the 24th. All those prisoners whom we thought any way suspicious we confined in a hut; we left a guard over them, and proceeded to the town guard — and after getting possession of their arms, we confined them in the gaol. We then marched to the civil officers quarters, where we found six pistols and two muskets. We confined the civil officers in the gaol. We then held a Council, in which it was debated whether we should proceed to the garrison, or wait until the Commandant came down to examine the works — when it was agreed to wait for his coming down; but in the interval, four soldiers were seen coming down from the garrison to the hospital, which lay between the town and the garrison. Four men were then dispatched to make prisoners of them, when a scuffle ensued in which, one of the soldiers attempting to wrest a pistol from one of the prisoners, when the pistol premiscuously went off, by which the soldier was unfortunately shot. One of the four got away, and alarmed the garrison, when the Commandant sent down a party of men with a Lieute- nant at their head; when we seen them we gave three cheers and advanced to meet them — at the same time we sent a party of unarmed men to make an entry into the garrison on the back. When the Commandant seen these, he shouted for them to come back, which they did, but not before they fired several shots at us. He then ordered the bugle to sound for the men who were out in quest of the two men who took the bush. We having only eight stand of arms, and only a very small quantity of ammunition, thought it the most judi- cious plan to get the boats launched, and put provisions and stores into them, and make for Philip's Island; this we done in the sight of twenty armed men and the Commandant. We left the few armed we had to protect the embark- ation of the prisoners and stores. When the last boat put out they all came down and poured in several shots on us, but never hit any of us. We brought all the mechanics with us with the view of being able to rise upon the three boats, and of being able to effect our escape to some other part; but leaving one boat behind, which we thought was disabled, by a hole being stove in her bottom. The same night they got her repaired, and put off in the hopes of finding us all in a state of intoxication; they being informed we had brought away a cask of wine — but in this they were disappointed for when we landed, we hauled the two whale boats upon shore, and moored the launch; and we ordered the tradesmen to commence making masts, and rising upon the boats. In the morning, one of our centinels reported that there was a boat in sight. We all ran to launch our boats and meet them, but owing to the tremendous surf which broke on the shore, we were not able to effect in time. We then determined not to let them land; but after an hour's successive firing from twenty-five armed men, and our poweder being ex- pended, they succeeded in landing. When some of our men seen that they had landed, they preferred being drowned before they should fall into their hands — and one man actu- ally leaped into the sea, with a musket in his hand, his name was Thomas Lynch. And another man by the name of Loumos, leaped into the sea at the same time, and one which was shot during the engagement. They then took fourteen men prisoners with them; and the rest of the pri- soners took into the interior of the country, where they lived on goats, fish, and the production of the island. In ten weeks they returned, and made a prisoner of Gough; and some of them they left there for six months. They brought away one man of the name of John Wavers, who was in a very weak state at the time, and put him for one day into the hospital, when they took him and put him on board of the brig, where he was not an hour before he gave up the ghost. Just a few seconds before he died, he wished the Almighty would be pleased to prolong his life until the arrived at Sydney, that the might die with his fellow prisoners; but the words were scarcely out of his mouth, before he died. There was one villain tried before the Commandant, of the name of Gorman, and fully convict on eleven evidences of an --------- crime, and was broke from being overseen. Honored Sir, it is not with a view to extenuate any thing that we have done, that we give you the particulars, but the hope of your taking the most essential part, and giving it a place in your highly respected Paper. We hope you will gratify the public with the full detail of how every thing originated. We remain, Honored Sir, With all possible respect, Your unfortunate, humble servants, JOHN GOUGH, WILLIAM MOORE, EDWARD WATSON. I hope Honored Sir, you will excuse the style in which this is wrote, as it is done to the best of my abilities. JOHN LYNCH.
