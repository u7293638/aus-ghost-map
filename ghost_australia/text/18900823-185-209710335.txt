SELECTED POETRY. AFTER THE CURFEW. Oliver Wendell Holmes. The play is over While the light Yet lingers in the darkening hall, I come to say a last good night Before the final exeunt all. We gathered once, a joyous throng; T|,e jovial toasts went gaily round; With jest and laugh, and shout and song, We made the floors and walls resound. We come with feeble steps and slow, A little band of four or five, Left from the wrecks of long ago. Still pleased to find ourselves alive. Alive! How living, too, are they Whose memories it is ours to share . Spread the long table’s full array— There sits a ghost iu every chair! One breathing form no more, alas ! Amid our slender group we see; With him we still remain ‘ the class Without his presence what are we ? The hand we ever loved to clasp That tireless hand which knew no rest— Loosed from affection’s clinging grasp. Lies nerveless on the peaceful breast. The beaming eye, the cheering voice, That lent to life a generous glow, Whose ever meaning said ‘ rejoice, We see, we bear, no more below. The air seems darkened by his loss, . Earth’s shadowed features look less fair, And heavier weighs the daily croBS His willing shoulders helped us bear. Why mourn that we, the favored few Whom grasping Time so long has spared, Life’s sweet illusions to pursue, The common lot of nge have snared. In every poise of Friendship’s heart There breeds uiifelt a throb of pain— One hour must rend its links apart, Though years on years have forged the chain. So ends ‘ The Hoys ’—a lifelong play. We, too, must hear the prompter a call To fairer scenes anil brighter day. Farewell! I let the curtain fall.
