WOMEN ARE STRANGE. [BY F. W. RomisoN.] CHAPTEt ?L?UI.--VISITORS TO TAVISTOCK BTREET. When the Colonel and Ernest Arch atone went downstairs together that day they. might, have.. been taken .almost for friends;" Clara Darrell's promise had re moved a weight from the mind of the old soldier, and he was more amiable then his wont. \- ?A"You can come in and smoke ia cigar iitalim', if- -y ; like," said the Colonel gruffly. Ernest Archstone did- like. He was Sanxious to deepen the 'good impressign 'which he thought he had made. He wps ..on his very beat behaviouir. ,The two gentlemen sat down facing each. other, and.the:elder of the' two began. business Simmediately their cigars were lighted, . "'You told me the first time we met that'you had no 'i'ttention of giving; ip ;your stage, career, Mr?. Arehstone,"' said theColonel.. "I have no intention of doing sy, Colonel,". was the reply;' "it is the one pereuit in which 'I could possibly take interest.', '. I "'°So stage-struck as that " .

"Surely you are not begiinning to doubt it?" "', f loubt everything when you are at 6er "elbow,' .said .the. Colonel,. frankly and .uncivilly. ' You are hert" oracle -and you will tempt her to, act again." *"On. my' honour-No! ' answered Ernest. "Is that, true? asked Colonel Darrell. ,:ffYou must not be too suspicions of everythig, and everybody,'` Colonel Darrell, cried the younger'man. "Iam afraid that has helped to shadow your'life, 'as ithas mine. .I am ashamed.to confess that I do not wish to see. Clara on the stage .after. her marriage.- I am too jealous and irritable a man. I shall',be glad that it all ends with her .single life -great actress though she is, and great loss to the profession as she will be, assuredly." "Hers will be the gain," replied the Colonel, "for she will gain that happi ness in life which the stage would have never been able to secure for ,her., ln her married home-not that, sahe 4.going to.marry'.you all in a hurry,'"he Iadded O"l I air. .."Idoh't know thatI like iyi'Uany better than I did," remarked thi Colonel, " and it strikes me you are confoundedly coiiceited; but you are in a state of pro bation-that's all, please touinderstand." ':'Very well. Thank' you,' air," ans?ered the actr, beaming with sailes. ".I.am sure you'll like me presently.".. '"You are aware that your father has threatened to cut you off with a shilling if you marry an actress " said the Colonel. ".Shoe will, iot be an actress after Splatterdab'sii benefit," replied Ernest; "And, besides- and I -am not sorry to confess it in this instance-my father seldom means what he says." "' "Perhaps ho did. not mean to be so ferocious as he was at the. ioyal Hotel, o6ioM weeks ago 1" said the Colonel. "Iam sure he did not."! : L ' . "' How do you know? asked the older man. '"!He.has toldme so himself,", was the reply. :."JYour.fathernhas " ' "Oh ! yes-we are the best of friends now, and ho is extremely anxious to seB you again," said Ernest. " Be told me only'yesterday thai he had never met:in hits'life"s 'genhil and hearty ashd out spoken a gentleman as yourself.". ' ' '"Then- yo"ur faither is 'trying to humbug, the two of us," replied the . Colonel; '"afd, 'you .. ,may.i tell hiih" 'froin me that I .:have .never m~et sich a hot headed,:pompous old--.

" That if the match could be arranged before the next attack, which, keepse.the most regular timeo--nce ; .every.. four months--itmight save many grave mis. understandings. " When your fatherj calls ?upon. me in one of those amiable moods to whioh .you are constantlyreferring, .sir, I: shall.,be able to minake up, my2mmind upon many things." Ernest Arohatone looked At his watch. "He 'will be here in five minutes?"' he said. '.' " " What I-your father 1" . "Yes. He.assured me he should .call, upon you at half-past.eleven this morning -in fact, I said I would wait for him here,' said Ernest. ' " Upon my word you appear to arrange' matters very .nicely, I must say," the Colonel remarked.' "I am anxious to see you both friends," said- the actor meekly. " You willlike my father very muiich." " I am' not'quite so sure." "And here he comes rouod Wallitiiton street;eand'a:lady with him, toob. That's dd'" 'said Ernest Archstone, with his face vera close to the windowrglass. "I don't kriow' the lady. What an old-fashioned guy,"to' be sure. Who can she be ': .The Colpnel looked over. . Ernest's shoulder. .. "Cdnfound. your impertineince," he roared out ;"" that's my sister!1fartha" : "Your sister ? Oh ! I beg ten 'thousand. pardons, Coldhiell" cried the confised tra gedian. "lihad not the slightest idea." '(I dol',t suppose you had," said the Cblonel'sternly, "or I should have a little more'to say about.it. And she does look old-fashioned in that bonnet," he mut tered; "I wonder where she got the thing from 1" '. . A minnte or two later Alderman Arch. ,tone and the Colonel 'ere face to face once more-the.former gentleman suave and bland, and with a broad smile upon his face verging on the imbecile. "Colonel Darrell, I am very proud to have the honour of a re-introduction to you," he said, "for we met the first time under adverse circumstances. You were hasty, and I was an invalid and - How do you do, eir "' 'I un very well, thank you,. Alder man," said the Colonel, shaking hands and looking from his sister Martha to the civic dignitary; "but I was notaware you knew-my sister."............. ..`' I have called once or twice at the hotel, in the hope of. seeing ,you," the Alderman explained. '!"was anxious, to give you every opportunity to apologise for that harsh manner towards'me--" , "$iri" " And to apologise myself for anirrita bility of demeanour which was not natural tome in anyway," added the Alderman ; "and I have had the pleasure of meeting your sisters whilst waiting at the hotel yesterday and the day before." " Why did you wait there 1" " You wrote to us you were coming on both days, Ieonard," explained the sister; "'arid I told Alderman Archatone that we expected you every minute. 'And you never came near the place." "1 said I would try and look round." 0'I am afraid youdid not try,Leonard," said Martha Darrell. "And, as we were 'getting'anxious about Clara, I came on here ; aindMr. iArchstone has been kind enough to take the trouble to escort me." " It is no:trouble, my dear madam, I assure you,"replied tbe Alderman, with. alow bow; '"it has been a very great pleasure to me also .to have had., the honour of listening to much instructive and earnest conversation.from your lips.' . -" Oh! Alderman, you flatter me;" said MarthaDarrell, actually simpering, to her. brother's surprise ; but the Alderman protes'ted against .the .charge,: and' once more began bowing most elaborately. . "This old man's next'dooi't6o an idiot,"' muttered the Colonel' to himself. "I'm sure of it." : ' What , a charming gentleman,!' said :Martha to lier.brother when there,was an .opportunity to say a word, " and this wais when Ernest 'Archatone had drawn his. father' asidd to whisper to 'him- cobfidei "That is your opinion, is itl".said the' Colonel: S" So - franl--so-so chivalrous-so -in telligent, Leonard," she whispered ; "you will be surprised.' Ya Yes-I shall be presently, I have no doubt. ' .. '.:!He.is anxious to .talk .to, you, about the engagement between'hiseson -and' our Clara-' to settle' imatters satiskaotorily' at last! He is," she added in a' lower tone, "very rich. I have'made every inquiry. I'have " "Made yourself over-busy as ;usual, Martha," interrupted the Colonel ;' 'and that's like you." "Leonard 1" ' There, go upstairs and talk..to your niece-and let her, understand that you and your sister were not quite the Gorgons she thought when she ran away, from home, poor child. She will iee you now." '!.Will. her health: permit -..-'. . " Everything,/' he said dryly, and with a.glance at Ernest Archetone; " she re ceives plenty of company." "'I'shall be glad' to see Clara," said Marth'a, rising. "Upstairs,, did you say.'." ?!.Yes-upstairs," he .answered ab sently. .He 'did not say which floor, or which room, and Martha Darrell having beeii "aware from her last visit .that.'the,'next floor was in: the 'occupation of Mrs.i M'Alister, andi, dreaming not of. other rooms on.the same level, went innocently and' incautiously "upatairs to the second floor apartments, wherein.Mrs. Cuthbert drew the, faint breath of life that was in' her. . It was . Mrs. Outhbert's voice that said ' Come in ?" as she' knocked, and it was so like 'Clara Darrell's in its :tone that the sister-in-law turned the' handle with out a supicion of the secret on the, other side of the door. OHAPTER ? XIf. --APPIROAC?ING A ORIaIS An" hour afterwards Martha Darrell entered her brother's sitting room again, and startled 'him by her ghastly ap pearance. He was alone then, the inter view between the alderman and himself was' d''veir, and "Havey Grange" had 'taken his father away. Colonel Darrell was sitting in an easy chair by the fire-side, with his arms folded 'across his chest, ' and 'his countenance very grim and furrowed. "Thinking it over" had not conduced to .any great satisfaction of mind, judging by a peculiar scowl. : He looked up as Martha Darrell 'appeared. " Oh ! I hadt forgotten: you," he said ungraciously. "' What 'a time you have been I And--what's the matter7?" he added'with a start, as. the, peculiar pallor of his sister's countenance struck him' for the first time. " You haven't been going it again,' after all my warnings, have you ?" "No, Leonard-Clara and.I have been very, good friends, and understand each :other.at last," was the reply. '"That's all right: There's nothing like a fair explanation, but-don't you feel well?" he asked. , Yes-I am very well thank you," she said. " Please give'me time." ,"Those stairs are a little' trying t'. people of your age," the" brother remarked, " and you are not so young as you, used to be." ." "I don't find stairs inconvenience mie in the least," said Martha quickly ; "uand after all, Leonard, I'm :only four years older than you. You, need 'not taunt me with my age." " You are out of breath with some thiig or other, at any rate," he'. said, " and you're as white as a sheet, anti look ia 'hundred and four, at. least." '' Do 'I indeed l' said. Martha, iron ically now. "I suppose you' have not seen 'a ghost 1" asked the Colonel. S"Yes I have-perhaps I have," cried Marthal with 'sudden' excitement, and evidently disposed to burst- into tears; "but you will wait till Olara comes down stairs, ani-if 'you willirefrain fromd ask ing me any more 'qiestions, Leonard, I shall be very much obliged to you.' 'Clara is coming. down this morning, then?? S"Yes,'almost immediately." " That's well.' How rapidly she is recovering,i thank Heaven," 'he said. '?,?ie did you .think she was: looking'? She was a more girl when she left the three of you in Derbyshire-sh li has grown a fine young woman; has abshe not 1", Marther Darrell nodded twice, but declined to answer any more questions by word of mouth. She sat down inma chair by the door, and folded her hands in her lap. After a while she said, with. a heavy sih h . I wian Lnoeccs nan comre wiLn me. I am always lost without Rebecca.' .We have been so many years together." ' " And Selina, too-don't you want Selinda" her, brother said, 'a little acrimoniously. This last question. the sister conde. acended to answer. It helped to chaugo the conversation also. "I don't miss Selina very much," was the reply. .. She is a poor sufferer, and has not been my companion as Rebecca has. : Aid she differs from me in so many ways, that' she often reminds me of. your own lhasty,' overbearing' .self, Leonard." ".Oih, indeed." , ' HHns the Alderman gone ?" she asked. f"Yes." "What do you think of him now, Leonard 1" Martha Darrell was anxious to keep balking, after all, 'so that it.was not about herself or niece. 'I think he is an inconsistent old tool," said the Colonel,: tiistirig himself uneasily in his chaii. "I dont like the man at all. He's elther a raving lunatic or a self satisfied sillikin, according to rcumstances.". "Sillikin-what a vulgar expression I' exclaimed his sister. " He has talked to me of nothing but his infernal City business, and City influence, and City dinners and dignities, iand ~hemoney he has imade in the City, till I am positively sick," gro.vled Colonel Darrell. " But he is a pleasant, good-tempered -gentleman, is he not ?"-said Martha. "The more's the pity.-yes," replied the Colonel., "I tried to put him out by; 'sneering at City trading, and by boasting of the Norman blood of the Darrells, and .what aheap of money weohave got too, but it did not succeed. z His son' kept interfering,, or. I might -'" He looked askance, for a minute at his sister, who, with hands crossed together, had fallen into the deepest thought,: and then he broke short the threadbof his discourse, -and shouted, -"-Martha!" in such stentorian toied'that'the lady, taken off her guard, leaped from her chair in dismay.... "Good gracious !" exclaimed his sister, relapsing in a half prostrate "condition into her seat again. . What "do yo mean by rdaring at, one ike that 1 ,What isitl" ." ; , - " - : ' "What is it!"; said the- Colonel, springing up, and. beginning to stride, along the room, -" Thattis what Iswant: to. know. . What is the use of my; talking. it you will not listen to a word I am saying ? What the deuce hai'happened -upstairs ? You know something has happened-and that'you have distressed my daughter "by some of your waspish remarks, 'aid, you want her td take tiimie to recover. That's; it, Vsuppose'; and if you have 'aist'irbed heriind, back you go to Derbyshire td. morrow-you shan't stop in London to" iworry hbr and deceive me.

' What.ie:no fault of yours - i. -But Martha Darrell had .broken down, andi'was.. now weeping and -wringing her hands.: .. : I' Ohi! wait' till Clara "comes - pray wait till Clara comes," she entreated; "1 shiin't-wait, the Colonel shouted. " I am stiure that - Oh ! here she is:i Butt it was'not Clara Darrell who had entered the room, but 'Mrs. MS listger, looking very grave. She bowed'tithe brothier, and the sister said. at "once-= "Has bhe sent you 1" "Yes " Mrs M, Aliater replied. .. The Colonel looked-in alnild way:from one to the other ; the facts were confused ,and beyond his comprehension.-. Olara, his .daughter Clara;, over whose .rapid .convalescene he had rejoiced only that moriing, was ill then-she 'hadhbeen struck down again; after all... ' There- had been a relapse; a~ndthis 'was the end' of-it! He stood ' with: tii hand upon "'thi mantel-piece for support. S"You bring me bad news, madarm," he said in a trembling 'voice. "' Break itUt1 me as gently as you can--I am niiot i's striong to-day. s I could wish." ., "I am inot quite certain that I'bring you bal news, Colonel Darrell,"; replied, Mrs. M'Alister thoughtfully,;i:, . f'Not quite dertain?"' :.he -repeated interrogatively: ".My. daughter Olara -she---"' S' She will be here presently."... ' ."Yes-but. why presently?" :he an? swedred tetchily. ;' "That'is ;hIt I cansiot understand. Why''.does' she keep"fromi me unless she is ill ?" "' She is taking leave of'a friend." " Taking leave of-whom '?Z: ' " She purposes returning at once with you to the hotel.-even' to Derbyshire, if you think she is strong enough for. the journey," replied.the.old actress. " Has she quarrelled; with young Arohl stone again 1" "She has not quarrelled with any body," said Mrs. MlAlister. "She and your sister have made up their minds that it will be better.for the daughter to got away from this close, dark house of mine from an enervating, ' rtificial sentiment whichl has spruifg-ii-pin-it a'gaiin'a i wills, and very strangely too. ., But then we are women , and 'women: 'nare strange !?"

"It is you who seemed afraid of it just now," was thereply ,?'Yes-yes-that'satrue,?' he answered. But you are beatiqg ibout the bush' for some reason or other, which 'aggravaties me.

What friend' is shei takiiinSlabe of 1" .' Her ' mother," ' answered.. Mrs. M'Alister. OHAPTER XXIV-OLARtA BIDS OOD BY TO HER MOTHER. Leaving Mrs. M'Aliater to explain the position, so far as it was in'her power," to Colonol Darrell, let us see for ourselves what is going on in that upstairs room to which we have more than once, somewhat unwillinelv. conducted our readers. "All that has preceded the revelation to the father need not be dwelt'upon here ; it will be sufficiently shadowed forth in this meeting between mother and daughter to which we now stand witnesses. They are together-two strange women enough, or our pen has failed to depict their idiosyncrasies. The -crisis has ar rived, and'they are face to face; for the lasattime this-that they'willever exchange words again, little as they reck of it, -for all the reproaches of one, the resolutioi of the other. ' ' Mrs. Outhbert-we will call her by her stage name to the end of'oirbirief chrona 'icle-ia sitting up, with inore animation in hei' manner than we have witnessed hitherto i and ClaraDarrell is by her side, sitting on 'the edge g the same couch, and holding the thin, hot hands in hers, until they are torn away from her. The eyes--of- the elder- womari are full of wrathful. fire; the , fate before her she meets with some 'amount of courage,,if this be not bravado, the mere histrionic blap-trqp born f 'eaily training in the art dramatic. . "It is all 'a plot I" she cries.. ".You sent the, woman here-you and'. that father of yours-I'm sureof it." "I did not know she was in the house, until she' came from.you to'me. 'I 'did Snot expect her," is the daughter's answer.' "Ah ! it is all very fine to, say so." "You do not believeme, .then ?'?' "ho-I do ;not ..believe ydu," replies the mother. " Who;are' you; after all that I should take yodi words forgospel? What have I ever seen of yo;tl '', £inOt. muol.. U1 s.iu5na; .paa. noLs Deon my fault." , : .i ''; .' " Oh I that's it-taunt away !" she cries. "It's very fine to fling' my weak noes at me, not'knowing the hard life, the hard words, I, have had '.t put up with from your wretch of a father. I hate him -I curse him-there !" Mrs. Cuthbert- is excited in' good earnest now; she raises the hands, which she had torn away from her daughter's, high in the air, like a witch prophesying evil;. her:frame is trembling very much; the decanter at her elbow is empty of the spirit'it contained. S" He has 'been a good father, to me; he would have been to you 'th best of husbands," says Olara, shuddering.. "He is so generous, so kind a man." S"Ihavirtold you I'dbn't believe aword you say,"'the Imother.answers quickly and defiantly. " . . . ;i '.. '" Some day you will, I hope,"responds Clara sadly. " Aid now tell- tnb what you want with me " , S" Nothing I" is.the sullen answer. ".You sent for me...Aunt Martha bade me come at once," Olpra Darrell says. " ShosV.aks the truth,' tihough she is a Darllrel plies Mrs .Cuthbert. "She htells me of the misery I shall be to yp? of-the unhappiness I am prepring fors you-of the easy task for me to, say' ' Good-by' lest.the father should be set. against the child.

Why'!" asks the other curiously. "Just. because . she is my- mother= that's.all,'' is the mournful answer. -. Mrs. Outhbertdoes not reply.to-this at sohce. She sits and stares at herdaughter for a while. Then she covers hlier face suddenlnly with her hands, and moans like 'a dumb beastifinr direful agony: ' When Clara Darrell leans over her and attempts 'to to'ich'her, she wrenches herself side. ways from her, and then with the effort 'inks .back prostrate on the couch. "'.Tell ,me I can do. good by staying," Olaua urges; ' that I'may be of use; and I will ask him to let me remain. .I will stop, ifyou wish.

"Good.biy,'then. ;Let nmeikiss!?you, mother, now.". But the hands are held very tightly over the face,:and Olara cannot get them from it.; She kisses the long bony fligersain stead, and whispers something in her ear that is of 'prayer and promise both, arid th4ln passes away with much sorrowf it her 'heart. ' She has made her choice wisely, despite of all those vain regrets. , Martha Darrell has, after all, taught her where her duty lies. Between 'tho father alone in the world and the mother who left him alone, there is no real or honest choice.
