[?] BERTIE. n\\* HMMA AIjICK iwowni:. Drop tlio blind, and draw tho curtain Closo about tlio lattice sill ; How tlio Norther wnils and clamors, ; And the night is black and shrill! Thoro aro ghosts abroad — the spectres . Of tho happy long ago : ?Wraiths that riso to haunt mo over Whon tho dreary north winds blow, As in winters long ago. Hark 1 was that the wild rain falling In the dark, deserted street ? Of tho fitful pit-a-patter Of a baby's restless feet ? Was that cry a gusty murmur . ' Of the wind without the door ? Or a childish voice that calls mo From the distance evermore Whon the rain is at tho door 1 From the hollow darkness reaching, Tender arms my neck entwine, Baby ringlets brush my worn check, Baby lips are pressed to mine ! Nay, 'tis but a haunting memory Cheats my hungry heart's despair ! ' Yonder stands his 'shrouded cradle, And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair ! ? Yet ho comotli to me ever Whon the night and darkness fall ; When the wild winds shrill and clamor, Arid the rain is over all ! While I count my hoarded treasures — Precious trifles dear to riio ! — Sunny curl, or half-worn garment j Rioh with cunning broidery — All of him that's left to me ! Battered toys and baby's picture, With ' Our darling' scrawled beneath. And his rosy coral, dotted With the prints of little teeth. Oh, tho dainty, scarlct stocking ! Oh, the tiny silken shoe — Worn threadbare, where I so often Kissed tho pink toes peeping tliro' — Baby's'first, enchanting shoo! So with loving hands I take them From their secret hiding-place : Turn them o'er with lingering touches — Kiss the chubby pictured face ; \- ' _ While the salt- tears, slow and bitter, : Wrung from motherhood's despair, Fall upon his shrouded cradle : And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair !
