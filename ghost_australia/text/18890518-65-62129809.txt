A Mesmeric Evangelist. CONSIDERABLE excitement is being manifested at Langley (says the Birmingham Daily Gazette), owing to the appearance of the "llev. Dinock," from Berkshire, who is going through some extra- ordinary performances at the Primitive Methodist Chapel in that locality. Crowds of people are flocking to the place nightly, most of them out of cariosity on account of the wonderful stories that are abroad. No one knows much of the antece- dents of the rev. gentleman, who seem to combine the preacher, mesmerist, and spiritualist all in one. After the ordinary service, at which he holds forth at great length, a limited number of persons are invited to enter an ante-room "to receive the Holy Ghost." By performing a num- ber of mesmeric passes, and apparently calling to the spirit world for assistance, he makes a number of people fall from their Beats on to the floor and roll nnderneath the benches, apparently uncon- scious ; during which time the rev. gentleman declares "that the Holy Ghost haB entered into them and taken possession of their whole being." More mesmeric passes and antics follow, after -i which the individual operated upon suddenly recovers mysterious consciousness, and is said to have become converted. On Monday evening last no fewer than five individuals were lying on the floor at one time, and the benches had to be removed before they could be restored. On Wed- nesday night an indignant mother, whose son had been operated upon by the reverend gentleman, was clamouring outside the. chapel- door, with a poker in her hand, and it took a number of people to prevent her entering the building and commit- ting an assault. Since then the " rev." gentleman has ceased to " convert " the people of Langley by the methods indicated, but he explains the matter to very large audiences. A number of Bimple people put great faith in this itinerant evangelist, but on the. whole he has not been well received, and he intends closing his mission at Langley.
