Insurance and Suicide, The Supreme Court (says the S. A. Re gister) has reversed the verdict given in the case Wood v. the National Life As sociation of Australasia, Limited, and the Insurance money which the man Ernest Neville endeavoured to secure to his creditors by the strange device of com mitting suicide, will not be paid by the association after all. It will perhaps startle some people to learn that the Su preme Court possesses the power to re verse the verdict of a jury upon a ques tion of fact, aa it has done ao in this. One of the chief matters to be decided was with the regard to the insanity of the in sured, a point which the Attorney- Gene ral contended was amply proved by his having professed a belief in spiritism, in dulged in the practice of drawing strange pictures under the influence of some hal lucination, and asserted that he had seen a ghost. The jury found that the evi dence proved Neville to be insane, and the judge had therefore directed a verdict for the plaintiff, who sued for the amount of the policy. His Honor the Chief Jus tice said, in reference to the action in which the Court is now taking, that it ap peared to him that it was not overriding the Supreme Court Act, inaamuoh as the proceeding was sanctioned by the rules of Court, and these rules, according to the Act of 1878, are entitled to have the force of law because they have been laid ou the table of both Houses, of the Legis lature, and have not been disallowed by them.
