THE MISADVENTURE OF A GHOST. Aix amusing scene took place at the Royal Aquarium, London. A spectre of the orthodox sort is introduced upon the stage at that place of public ontor tainment, and one of the charactrs protends to be so frightened that he rushes about the boards omitting frantic yells. Unfortunatoly, the next set of performers happened to be a troop of coolies, trained to show their life-saving ability at a fire, who were placidly waiting their turn in the wings, and on hearing the shrieks they became excited, and with one ac cord jumped on to the stage and tore after the astonished ghost. The phantom did not show the proper ghost-like contempt for more material assailants; he did not appear to re gard the 'vain bites' of the dogs at all in the- light of ' malicious mockery,' but he leaped, hastily on. to a table, and, amid the inextinguishable laughter of the audience, implored somebody to save him from the howling pack.
