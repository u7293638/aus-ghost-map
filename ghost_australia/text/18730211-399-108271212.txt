SELECTED POETRY. THE ENGINE-DRIVER TO HIS ENGINE. Put forth your force, my iron -horse, your limbs that never tire! The best o£ oil shall .feed your joints, and best of coal your fire ; So off ire tear from Easton-square, to beat the swift south wind, As we rattle along the North-west rail, with the special train behind:— Dash along, crash along, sixty miles an hour! Bight through Old England flee! for I am bound to see my love, Far away in the Korth countrie. Xiike a train of ghosts the telegraph posts go wildly trooping by, While one by one the milestones run, and off behind us fly; Like foaming wine it fires my blood to see your lightning speed— Arabia's race ne'er matched your pace, my gallant steam-borne steed ! Wheel along, squeal along, sixty miles an hoar! Bight through Old England flee! For I am bound to see my love, Far away in the Tforth countrie. My blessing on old George Stephenson! let his fame for ever last; For he was the man that formed the plan to make you run so fast. His arm was strong, his head was long, be knew not guilt nor fear ; "When I think of him it makes me proud that I'm an engineer! Tear along, flare along, sixty miles an hour! Bight through Old England flee! For I am bound to see my love, Far away in the Korth countrie. Now Thames and Trent are far behind, and eveniug's shades are come, Before my eyes the brown hills rise that guard my true love's home; Even now she stands, my own dear lass, at the cottage door, As she listens for the whistle shrill, and the blast pipe's rattling roar. Boll along, bowl along, sixty miles an hour! Bight through Old England flee! For I am bound to see my love, At home in the .North countrie. —Blackwood.
