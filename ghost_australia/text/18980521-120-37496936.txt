A GHOST IN BUSINESS. An amusing oase of spiritualistic impostÂ» I turo has lately been tried before the Lands j gericht at Hamburg. The aoonsed, who was an apprentice 19 years old and an adept in ' spiritualism,' had a friend of the name of I Kaiser, who informed him that he was 70 marks to the good in his recipts, and how this money got into the sate he had no means j of divining. The accused at once explained this surplus by his own dealings with the spirit world. It was Onkel Ernst, his de- ceased relation, who had conjured the 70 marks into the safe, and who would shortly . require them back, spirits being apparently lenders rather than givers, but being gene- rous enough to forego the interest. Kaiser, who also played wita spiritualism, accepted the explanation, and his belief was confirmed later on when he received a dooument written professedly by Onkel Ernst. It said : ' Re- pay at once the 70 marks 1 advanced. My faithful medium to receive them.' Kaiser complied-and fonnd a few weeks later that the surplus had no ghostly souroe but waa simply due to an item he had overlooked in his accounts. Tho firm took the matter up, and tho prosecution proved that tue writing; of Onkel Ernst was exactly the same as that of his faithful medium. The Oourt deoided to protect the nephew from the influence of his business-like uuole by sentencing the faithful medium to six months' imprison- ment.
