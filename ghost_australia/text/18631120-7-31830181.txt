An American Sensation Hotel.—The following is positively an extract from "Inside Out," an American novel, of which the New York papers speak highly. It most be admitted that the Britishers cannot compete with this sort of thing:— " A reverie coursed through their frames, and fondled, with a gentle toying, the rich energy of latent exul tation. Dreams swayed the plastic mind, and, with them, in an atmostphere of epirit-dew, the cloudless regions rolled back falsity and revealed truth. Now came, in the attire of simplicity's sweet offspring, the fresh blushes of a modest love-birth ; cooing homage and expressing charity in spotless raiments. Come anew the rarest evidences of concealed humanity, clothed in the cobwebs of a silken, virtue. Come once more, in passive silence, the emotions of a filial sacrifice; no longer chained to earth's dull rounds, but mounting in exalted purity the throne of rap turous reward. . . Threatening rice proclaims a battle, and the waif-like menials burst rude cares, and lash on desperately lagging fiends. A brimstone moment flashes sacrifices and derision mocks at truth. Sepulchral ghosts hog madness with a scrawny power. Bones leare flesh and crimp the vitals. Hag? suck blood and mark fresh game. A yawning chasm laps pale agony, and lunatics grasp, clutch and stagger under frenzied influences. . . Back stagger dungeons! Tamp the flame with hill tops of volcanic ashes. Sour, stale, sad eilence scara sorrow, and o'erleap the heaviest evidences of unknown sardonic Samsons. Crush hope, stamp villany, sway existence." Geeek Fibe.—The term " Greek Fire," as applied to the substance which the Federals are pouring into Charleston, is strictly a misnomer. The secret of the manufacture of the original Greek fire has been lost for nearly 950 years, and it is probable that it will not again be found, seeing that modern chemistry suggests agents quite as dangerous, and perhaps simpler, than the original. Its modem representa tive, although intended for the same purpose, is dif ferent in character, more portable, more certain, more terrible. It is a fluid substance, is cheaply made, keeps for years, and is produced bo quickly that the ingredients of which it is composed may be put together at the moment when the compound is re quired. In using the liquid it has to be enclosed in a shell which shall burst at a given point of destina tion, and allow the fluid to be distributed. The con struction of modern liquid fire is based on simple scientific principles, and more methods than one may be discovered for producing it. The old Greek fire is supposed to hare included asphaltum, sulphur, and nitre in ita oompotitum,
