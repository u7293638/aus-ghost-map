CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM. The Bishop of Perth has, in a lecture, been giving expression to some admirable sentiments in regard to what is somewhat nebulously known as Christian Socialism, and has come to the conclusion that selfish ness was really the root of the whole pro blem. Possibly it may be said that it did not need a ghost from the dead or even a Bishop from Westralia to tell us this, bu.t it would be interesting to know how tho lecturer would apply his remedy of getting at the individual. That is just what social reformers have been trying to do for ever so long with apparently little success, and at all events it appears to be a tedious pro cess from which the existing generation can hardly hope much. Whether Socialism, Christian or other wise, will prove the medium for improving the lot of the majority of the toilers still seems very much in doubt, chiefly because j its own advocates appear to be unable to agree on any ' practical method of putting its principles into operation, and also be cause many of those who profess a belief in its efficacy are the last to give its doc trines effect. It is easy enough for a bishop, for in stance, to hold a theoretical belief in So cialism of any kind so long as he is not called upon to sacrifice anything on its be half ; but one can imagine the conster nation which would seize upon the average church dignitary if asked to sell all that he had and give the proceeds to the poor. The only kind of Socialism which can by any possibility benefit the masses is that which will secure them a larger and more equit able share of leisure and treasure than they at present possess, but it- is very questionable if the doctrinaire believers of the principle would countenance any or ganised movement to effect such an object. Even a Colonial Governor who talks glibly about the responsibilities and the oDiiga tions of wealth is hardly likeiy to be pre pared to personally give effect to his teach ing, and yet it is one of tho anomalies of modern civilisation that one man shall, without effort or exertion, be the owner of thousands of broad acres and have the com mand of every luxury, whilst thousands of others have to earn their daily bread by strenuous toil and suffering. Unless So cialism can equalise conditions of this kind it is a mockery to advocate it, and yet how many of those who mouth its virtues would consent to apply it in such a direction if they hod the opportunity Z
