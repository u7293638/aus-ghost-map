THE MARCH MAGAZINES. The Nineteenth Century opens with an " Ode to March by Mr Swinburne, the meaning of which is somewhat hard to seize imitate maze of words in " A Pleading for the Worthless," Cardinal Manning m investigated the causes of the social wreckage which exists in Great Britain, and defines them to be the destruction of domestic life by such numbers of persons being inhumanly housed, the drink trade, and the absence of moral law, the latter being connected with the fact that it is materially impossible for one half of the population of London to set foot on Sunday in any place of Divine worship He asserts that the worthless are what they are because the society of to day) has wrecked them, andhedemands that society should redeem them. One of the most remarkable phenomena of our own times-the swarming of men-is the theme of an article by Mr Leonard Courtney, MP, which is calculated to suggest some very serious reflections in the minds of statesmen for it points out pretty clearly that in all thickly peopled countries there exists the perilous possibility that the multiplication of the means of life may, locally at least, bear rested, whilst the multiplication of men continues, and the latter proceeds most rapidly among the classes which are most numerous, least provident, and at the same time most prone to social or political revolt in periods of distress and suffering The most prolific sections of the population in the mother country, at any rate, do not as Mr Courtney remarks, recognise practically und habitually their responsibility for their children's start in life, and therein lies the danger for the future."

" the difference between the hereditary and the elective 1 Exceutive and Upper House,' he observes, is the most obvious to the general eye, but is after all principally a difference in the form and machinery of government. 'He monarch reigns for life, but does not govern , the President governs for four or eight years but does not reign The systems are not interchangeable each is best where it is Neither country would tolerate a substitu- tion of the other system for its own The fundamental distinctions between the two Governments are to be found in the existence in the United States of a written instead of an unwritten constitution, of it division of sovereignty between the Federal Government and the States, of a peculiar combination of checks and counterpoise among the various departments of government, and in the preponderance given to the judicial power as the interpreters of the constitution, and for the protection of personal rights," MISS M Hill gives a detailed statement of the average weekly expenditure of a mechanic, with a wife and four children, earning 8s a day, and Mr. Roberts does the same as regards a clerk by 4th a salary of a guinea a week, 'the concluding article Is by Mr John Morley, M P, and is a vindication of himself from the imputation of being the St. Just of the English revolution, in 3/uri day's Magazine, Mr. Lewis Morris makes another bid for the reversion of the Laureateship by some graceful versus on the silver wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales or Vincent Gaillard, who signs himself representative of British bondholders at Constantinople ' takes a tolerably comprehensive survey of the position of affairs in Europe and expresses his belief that the probably lines are in favour of peace chiefly because the out and out revolutionary war party in Russia is not strong enough to force the Czar's hand that the military war party does not consider Russia sufficiently prepare 1 for war and that the coalition of the Central Powers and their probable allies is aggressive, and sufficiently strong to keep the aggressive powers Russia and France in check Mr W M Acworth succinctly narrates the history and describes the administration of the Midland Railway the service of which is one of the fastest the chesnut to the passengers and the most convenient in the world.
