It was even said as a matter beyond dispute that the inmates of a monastery which was built near the Black Cliff, and could .be seen a.,|ong distance to seaward, were in the habit of hanging a lantern out at. night to entice voyagers to destruction. The good monks Jof bourse inaiMained that the lamp was hnng -out as . .a;signal of danger to keep mariners away. Thit might be, but t^ere could be no disputing the fact that the religious brothers claimed and received their full share of the wreckage that was plundered from the ill fated vessels lured oh the rocks.

' THE TEENOWETH ? g.: Almost as old as the hunlet of St» Columb itself was the TrfenoWeth family. • ' f Tradition set them down as being of memorable antiquity, but whether the ancestors of John Trenoweth traded with the Phoenicians, or whether a later generation fitted out a ship and fought with Drake against the Spanish Armada is of little coneern to this story. ' . , ; There was little doubt that the family was of ancient lineage, and it was also certain that the " Wheal Merlin " had been owned and w,orked by the Trenoweths for many generations. John Trenoweth knew this to his cost, for in the year 1830, when his father died and left him it as his only possession, he found that t^e living to be obtained from it was likely, to • be a precarious one. ....
