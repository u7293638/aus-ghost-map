MONEY-MAKING- MEN. Kut;u ¡u Memoirs and Diaries, it is V ily wonderful what a volume of recollec f /ms and ststcrrents there are relating to City . ways und City life. Every one. of course, conics to London, and is more-or less con- nected with that great hive of industry and enterprise known as " the City." One of thc latest anecdotes is the following, relating to the origin of a great City house, to which in- these Scraps we have before adverted : "On the 1st of January, 1818," writes Mr. Macaulay, " a new tragedy was produced at Covent Garden. Thc author, John Dillon, a very, young man, was the librarian of Dr. Simmons, of Paddington, fumous for a very splendid collection of valuable books. With great promise of dramatic power, as evinced in this his first essay, he wisely left the poet's idle trade for the more lucrativo pursuits of commerce, and became partner in the well known firm of Morrison, Dillon, and Co. This play was called ' Retribution,* and thc chief weight of which-in a very powerful character, Varanes-was on the shoulders of O'Neill. Charles Ketnble, Terry, and myself were his supporters-thc villain of thc story falling, bf course to me." In tho person of Mr. Prank Dillon the urtistin taste pf the mthcr has proved itself to bc hereditary. Another moncy-multing mini wus thu foun- der of thc Baring family. Thc origan of them in England is to bc traced to John Baring, sou of a Lutheran pastor in Bremen. Johan, when still ti lad of sixteen or seventeen, came to England, engaged for u few years in clerkly duties, studied hard, amassed u little money, and finally Bottled dowu as a cloth -merchant and manufacturer in a little village near Exeter. He had four sons; und the third of them, Francis, bom 17*10, came to Loudon where, after finishing his education at Mr. Fuller's academy in Lothbury, he set up in business as au importer of wool and dye-stuffs, ulso acting as agent for the I original family cloth factory." Starting, writes Mr. Frederick Martin, " with a fixed , determination to become rich, and having u , fair "mount of money to begin with, he WHS uniformly successful in all his designs. Nothing fulled that he uudertook, and what- ever he touched became gold. Having amassed a fortune by dealing in cloth, wool, mid dye-stuffs, he resolved to ([tiintuple the furtune by den I in g in money itself- that is, to bc a banker." As was natural, the successful mun became also thc honoured mun -' a leading director of thc East India Company, und the friend and adviser of thc Premier, Lord Shelburne, who invariably y followed his counsels in mutters of linaneu. ,| After obtaining a scut in Purliumcut for J Exeter, thc son of Johan Buring wus made a "baronet, under patent of May ¡JO, 1703, hy William Pitt, Shclburne's successor in the Government, after thc short interregnum of the Duke of Portland.

Nathan, / so thc story runs, was leaning one duy, carly .in thc spring of 1821, against his favourite pillar in thc Royal Exchange- long known us ? " the Rothschild Pillar "-his hands in his pockets, when his cousin Gompers ran up to I him in a high state of excitement. " Vat ish k dc matter ?" queried Rothschild. Thereupon ? he other recounted in gosps how he had been Btpplying for the vacant actuuryship of a large insurance company, «nd had been pcaten in thc competition. Though being ,admittedly thc best candidate, on account of his religion thc directors declared they would Miiive no Jew. Now Nuthon, too, got excited. " Vat I" he cried, disengaging his hands from his pockets, and laying hold of his brother- in-law by the shoulders, "not take ivou pecmise of your religion I Mein Gott! ?Den I will mnkc u bigger office for you than PSiy of 'cm."

And, aa it turned out, Johnson was correct in his sur- mise. . ' The name of Gideon is now little heard, but at one time most assuredly he was one of the ^ merchant princes. I refer to Simeon Gideon, who knew how to make himself the friend of Robert Walpole, who was tolerant enough to avail himself of thc help*of a Jew in those financial complications in which he was ne- cessarily concerned. One of the principal sour- ces of revenue for the State were lotteries, and it was thus Gideon made his money. But ho made his masterstroke in 1745, when thc grcut Jacobite insurrection threw thc British world and thc mercantile public especially, into the wildest consternation. Thc panic on 'Chango was universal. Thc funds fell with incredible rapidity, and men wanted to sell at any price. Simeon Gideon was almost the only man who did not lose his head. Instead of selling, bu spent every penny he had or could borrow in buying. This was in the mouth of November. During the following month, he oscillated between hope and fear. At length, at thc end of April of 17<16, the news arrived of the battle of Culloden, of the complete defeat of tho insurgent army, of thc flight of the Pretender, and of the triumph- ant suppression of the rebellion by the Dultc of Cumberland, lt was then Simeon Gidcou began to sell, und found himself in possession of something like a quarter of a million-a sum which in thc course of fourteen or fifteen years quadrupled itself. Gideon's ambition was to found an English house.' He was too old he said, to change his religion, but he had his children baptized; and, through Walpole's instrumentality, his eldest son was made a baronet in his eleventh year, lt was hard work for Gideon père to make a christian of the Iud. "Who made thee ?" on one occasion he asked thc boy. "God," was tho proper reply. "Who redeemed thee ?" was the next question, to which the boy replied, "Jesus Christ." Then came a third question, which thc i'nth er hud unfortunately forgotten. " Who-who," he stammered j and then no- thing better occurring to him, he asked, "Who hus given you this hat? " The young catcchuuieu is reported to have confidently replied, " The Holy Ghost." Gideon senior dietl in thc faith of his luthers in 1762. He left behind him as heirs ol' his immense for- tune a sou and daughter, and legacies am- ounting to 100,000 thalers were to bc devi ded equally between Jewish anti Christian benevolent societies and thu poor. Wc reud in the letter of a contemporary -"Gideon is dead, and his whole inheritance is worth moro thau the whole of Cunaun." Another »tar which dawned in the com. twrcial world about thc same time was Aaron Goldsmid. Ile came from Humubrg, and established himself in London as a merchant in the middle of thc lust century. The house arrived nt its highest prosperity after his death, under his four sons. At thc head of thc business were then two brothers, Abraham mid Benjamin, men of ack- nowledged integrity, und allied in friendship with Newland, thc head cashier of the Bank of England. He also was a self-made mau, who hud risen from a baker's shop to his enormously intluentiul position. By means of Nowland thc brothers Goltlsmid were brought into connection with the Govern- ment, which the year 1793 had been compel- led to have recourse to continual loans in consequence of the Continental war But it was not only through this that they made their money. It was their cleverness and knowledge that saved them from losing money when all over Europe great mercantile houses were breaking. Une of thc most notable character- istics of Benjamin was, we are told, his astonish- ing knowledge of linns, which was not con- fined merely to England, but embraced the whole money murkct in or out of England. He I valued with a certainty bordering on the mor I vellous every mime on thc buck of a bill. In the panic year of 1700 the house only lost .£50, when ruin swept away many of thc chief firms of England and abroad. At thc beginning of the present century there was no house greater or more universally esteemed. And yet the end wns tragic in thc extreme. Ono morning in April 1808, Benjamin Gold- smid hung himself in his bedroom. In 1810 the elder brother Abraham, in conjunction with thc house of Haring, embarked in a Government loan of J?14,000,000. The busi- ness failed : thc house of Baring survived thc crash, but Abraham Goldsmiü shot himself, when he found how true it was that riches take to themselves wings and fly away. Here is u story of au alderman, extracted from " Malonianu." When the late Mr. Viii, or Alderman Beckford, mude n strong utluck on thc late Sir William Hillier, alder- man ol' London, ellinging him with having nuult: tm immense stun by a frautluleut con- tract, he gol up very quietly, lind gained the House to IUB side by this short reply : " The honorable gentleman is a great orutor, and hus mude a long and serious charge against me. 1 nm no orator, and shall therefore only answer in two words-Provo it." Having thus spuken, he sat down, but thcro was something in his tone and mininer that satisfied the House that thc charge was a culttminy. In 1736 there wus-us I dure say there is now-on old Mr. Collier in thc city. He lived in Essex, and his daughter-BS is generally tho case with thc daughter of rich, city men-soon got married. It was thus the Hov. Dr. Tnvlor. of I«leworth. in 1788. described tho wedding. " Old Mr. Collier wiis n very vain mnn, who made his fortune in thc South Sen yenr j nnd having been originally a merchant was fond, after he had retired to live upon his fortune, of a great deal of display and parade. On his (laughter's wedding, therefore, he invited nearly fifty persons, and got two or three capital cooks from London to prepare a magnificent entcrtaicinent in honour of thc day. When other ceremonies had concluded, thc young couple were put to bed, and every one of the numerous assemblage came into thu room to make these congratulations to my father and mother, who sat up in bcd to re- ceive them : ' Madam, I wish you a ver*y good night ; Sir, all happiness tu you, and a very good night,' «nd so on through the whole party. My father, who ' ' hated all parade, but was forced to submit to the old gentleman's humour, must have been in a fine fume ; and my mother, who was then but seventeen or eighteen, sufficiently embar- rassed.'' It is as well rich citizens don't in- dulge in such a display on the occasion of a marriagr- in the family in our time. I don't fancy even a Lord Mayor, however fond of autiquity, would feel himself justified in anything so ridiculous now. But then it was the fashion for a well-bred youth to address his father as " honoured sir," and not as now, as " governor."- City Press.
