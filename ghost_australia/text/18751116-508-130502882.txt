The Circular Quay, A month ago there was another upheaval of the old and oft discussed improvement difficulties. The time since elapsed has been quite sufficent to " lay the ghost'' once more, and matters are going on in the usual miserable routine. What are the authorities about to permit the composite floor of the old goods shed to remain where it is fifteen inches above the level of the roadway, and quite as great an obstruction to traffic and storage as the store itself used to be. A few men and two or three drays could remove it in less than a week.
