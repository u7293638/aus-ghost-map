fully believing that I in his son Glan and him an orphan, though what with on offering since he took a taste for it and him and the Major making locomotives out of parasols broken iron pots and cotton

Rolling stock and the Per inanent'Waj and all the rest of it (the whole kept upon the Major's sideboard and dusted with his own hands every morning before varnishing his boots I notice him as full of thought and care as full can be and frowning in a fearful manner but indeed the Major does nothing by halves as witness his great delight going out surveying with Jemmy to go with, carrying chain and a measuring tape and driving I don't know what improvements right through Westminster Abbey and still believed in the streets to be knocking every thing upside down by Act of Parliament As please Hear

Mentioning my poor Limper brings into my head his own youngest brother the Doctor though Doctor of what I am sure it would be hard to say unless I liquor, for neither Physic nor Music nor yet Law does

gentlemen that I should have judged to be in the feather-bed trade if they had not announced theirs so fluffy were their personal appearance broS your chains sir, says Joshua to the littlest of the two in the biggest that, "river on an) fetters' Imagine my feelings when I pictured him clanking JP Norfolk street irons and Miss M o/euhnni lookup out of window ' "Gentlemen I says all of a tremble

thing and to look about as it suspicious of the goods being gradually removing in the dead of the night by a back door is another, over it long you have no control but suspecting is voluntary Allowances too must ever be made for a gentleman of the Major s warmth not relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth, and while I do not know that it is more suitable to my own feelings to have a low crowned hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still I can appreciate the Majors, besides which without bearing mallee of vengeance the Major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always was with Joshua I in oper So at last my deal the M yoi h m wait for Mr Buffle and it worried me a great deal!

it in his hand ' Major here's Old Moore's Almanack with the his rough pine complete, for your opinion ' It took the Major a little longer to read than I should have thought, judging from the copious

carry on to that degree that Isovs ' If you two children ain't more orderly 111 pack you both off to bed " And then they fell to cleaning up the Major s telescope to see France with, and went out and bought a leather bag with a snap to hang round Jemmy, and him to carry the money like a little 1 Fortunatus with his purse, If I Indu t passed my word and raised their hopes, I doubt if I could have gone through with the undertaking but it was too late to go back now to on the second day after Midsummer Day we went off by the morning mad And when we had came to the sea which I had never seen but once in my life and that when my poor 1 Ripper was courting me, the freshness of it and the deepness and the airiness and to think that it had been rolling ever since and that it was always a rolling and so few of us minding, made me feel quite serious But I felt happy too and so did Jemmy and the Major and not much motion on the whole, though me with a swimming in the head and a sinking but able to take notice that the foreign insides appear to be constructed hollow than the English, leading to much more tremenjous noises when bad sadors But my dear the blueness and the lightness and the coloured look of everything and the very sentry boxes stripped and the shining rattling drums and the little soldiers with their waists and tidy gaiters when we got across to the continent-it made me feel as if I don t know what-as if the atmosphere had been lifted off me And as to lunch why bless You if I kept a man cook and two kitchen-maids I could it get it done for twice the none), and no m jured young women a glaring at you and grudging you and acknowledging your patronage by wishing that your food might choke you, but 60 end and so hot and attentive and every way comfortable except Jemmy pouring wine down his throat by tumblers full and me expecting to see him drop under the table And the way in which Jemmy spoke his French was a real alarm It was often wanted of him, for whenever anybody spoke a syllable to me I says " Noncomprenny, you're very kind but it's no use Now Jemmy ' " and then Jemmy he fires away at cm lovely, the only thing wanting in Jemmy's French being as it appeared to me that he hardly ever understood a word of what they said to him which made it scarcely of the use it might have been though in other respects a perfect Native and regarding the Major's fluency I should have been of the opinion judging French by English that there might have been a greater choice of words in the language though still I must admit that if I hadn't known him wherîe asked a military gentleman in a pey cloak what o'clock it was I should have took him for a Frenchman born Before going on to look after my legacy we were to make one regular day in Paris, and I leave you to judge my dear, what a day that was with Jemmy and the major, and the telescope and me, and the prowling young man at the inn door (but very civil too that went along with us to show the sights All along the railway to Paris Jemmy and the Major had been frightening me to death by stooping down on the platforms at stations, to inspect the engines under neath their mechanical stomachs, and by creeping in and out I don't know where all, to find improvements for the United Grand Junction Parlour, but when we got out into the brilliant streets on a bright morning they gave up all their London improvements as a bad job and gave their minds to Pass Says the prowling young man come, 'Will speak Inglis, No3 So I says "If you can, young man, I shall take it as a favour, ' but after half an hour of it, when I fully believed the man had gone mad, and me too, I says, " Be so good as fall back on your French, sir, ' knowing that then I shouldn't have the agonies of trying to understand him, which was a happy release Not that I lost much more than the rest either, for I generally noticed that when he had described something very long indeed, and I says to Jemmy, " What does he say, Jemmy' ' Jemmy says, looking at him with vengeance in his eye, "He is so jolly indistinct and that when he had described it longer all over again, and I says to Jemmy, "Viv eil, Jemmy what is it all about Jemmy says " He says the building was repaired in seventeen hundred and four, Gran Wherever that prowling youngman formed his prowling habits I cannot be expected to know, but the way in which he went round the corner while we kid our breakfasts and was there again when we swal- low ed the last crumb was most mory callous, and just the same at dinner and at night, prowling equally at take the sure and take inn gateway and the shop doors when webougkta trifle or two and everywhere else but troubled with a tendency to spit And of Paris I can tell you no more my dear it than that it is town and country both in one, and carved stone and long streets of high houses and gardens and fountains and statues and trees and gold, and immensely big soldiers and immensely little soldiers and the pleasantest nurses with the whitest caps a playing at skipping-rope with thebunchiest babies in the flattest caps, and clean tablecloths spread everywhere for dinner and people sitting out of doors smoking and sipping all day long and little plays being acted in the open air for little people and every shop a complete and elegant room, and everybody seeming to play at everything in this world And as to the sparkling lights my dear after dark, glittering high up and low down and on before and on behind and all around, and the crowd of theatres and the crowds of people and the crowd of all sorts, it's pure en chantment And pretty well the only thing that grated on me was that whether you pay your fare at the railway or whether perchance your money at a money dealer's or whether you take your ticket at the theatre, the lady or gentleman is called up (I suppose by the Government) behind the strongest iron bars, having more of a zoological appearance than a free country "W cil to be sure when I did after all get my precious bones to bed that night and my young rogue came in to kiss me, and asks, ' "it What do you think of this lovely Pans, Grand says, "Jemmy I feel as if it was beautiful fire works being let off in my head and very cool and refreshing the pleasant country was next day when we went on to look after a) legacy, and rested me much and did me a deal of good So at length and at last my dear w come to Sense a pretty little town with a great two tow ered cathedral and the looks flying in and out of the loopholes and another tower atop of one of the towers like a sort of stone pulpit in which pulpit, with the birds skimming below him, if you 11 believe me, I saw a speck while I was resting at the inn before dinner which they made signs to me was Jemmy, and which really was I had been a fancying, as I sat in the balcony of the hotel, that an Angel might light there and call down to the people to be good, but I little thought what Jemmy, all unknown to himself, was a calling down from that high place to some one in the town the pleasantest situated um, my dear' Right under the two towers, with their shadows a changing upon it all day like a kind of a sun dial, and country people driving in and out of the court yard in carts and hooded cabriolet and such like and a market outside in front of the cake dral, and all so quaint and like a pieter The M for and me agreed that whatever came of my Legacy this was the place to stay in for our holiday, and we also agreed that our dear boy had best not be checked in his joy that night by the sight of the Englishman ii he was still alive, but that we would go together and alone For you are to understand that the Major not feeling himself quite equal in his wind to the h eighth to which Jemmy had climbed, had come back to me and left him with the Guide So after dinner when Jemmy had set off to see the river, the Major went down to the Mine, and presently came back with a military character in a sword and spurs and a cocked hat and a yellow should belt and long bags about him that he must have found bacon ement And the Major says ' the Englishmen still lies in the same state dearest madam This gentleman will conduct us to his lodging ' Upon which the military clime terpullcdoffhis cocked hat to me, and I took notice that he kid skin ed his forehead in imitation of Cape tion Buonaparte but not like We went out at the coin t) area gate and passed the green doors of the cathedral and down a narrow High street where the people were sitting chatting at their shop doors and the children were at play The milk tar) character went in front and he stopped at a pork shop with a little statue of a pig sitting up in the window, and a private door that a donkey was looking out of When the donkey saw the military elected he came slipping out on the pavement to turn round and then clattered along the passage into a back ) ird So the cost being clear, the Major and me were conducted up the common stair, and into the front room on the second, a bare room with a red tiled floor and the outside little blinds pulled close to darken it. As the military character opened the blinds I saw the tower where I had seen Jemmy, darkening as the sun got low, and I turned to the bed by the wall and saw the Englishman It was some kind of brain fever he had had, and his hair was all gone, and some wetted folded linen lay upon his head I looked at him very attentive as he lay there all wasted away with his eyes closed, and I says to the Major ' I never saw this face before The Major looked at him very attentive too, and he says ' I never saw this face before When the Mayor explained our words to the military character, that gentleman shrugged his shoulders and showed the Major the card on which it was written about the legacy for me It had been written with a weak and trembling hand in bed, and I knew no more of the writing than of the face Neither did the Major Though lying there alone, the poor creature was as well taken care of as could be hoped, and would have been quite unconscious of any ones sitting by him taken I got the Major to say that we were not going away at present and that I would come back to morrow and watch a bit by the bedside But I got him to add- and I shook my head hard to make it stronger-"Weugiee that we never saw this face before ' Our boy was greatly surprised when we told him sitting out in the balcony in the starlight, and he ran over some of those stones of former Lodgers, of the Major s putting down, and asked want it possible that it might be this lodger or that lodge. It was not possible and we went to bed In the morning just at breakfast time the milk fat character came jingling round, and said that the doctor thought from the signs he saw there might be some rally before the end So I says to the Major and Jemmy, " You two boys go and enjoy yourselves, and 111 take my Prayer Book and go and sit by the bed So I went, and I sat there some hours, reading a prayer for him poor soul now and then, and it was quite on in the day when he moved his hand He had been so still, that the moment he moved I knew of it, and I pulled off my spectacles and laid down my book and rose and looked at him from moving one hand he began to move both, and then his action was the action of a person groping in the dark Long after his eyes had opened, there was a film over them and he still felt for his way out into light But by slow degrees his sight cleared and his hands stopped He saw the ceding, he saw the wall, he saw me As his sight cleared, mine cleared too, and when at last we looked in one another's faces, I started back and I enes passionately " O you wicked wicked man ' Your sin has found you out' " For I knew him, the moment life looked out of his eyes, to be Mr Edson, Jemmy s father who had so cruelly deserted Jemmy's young unmarried mother who had died in my arms, poor pender creature, and left Jemie) to me " You cruel wicked m n . You bad black traitor ' ' With the little strength he had, he made an attempt to turn over on his wretched face to hide it His arm dropped out of the bed and his head with it, and there he lay before me crushed in body and in mind Surely the miser ablest sight under the summer sun " O blessed Heaven I says cr) mg, ' teach me what to say to this broken mortal of ' I am a poor sinful creature, and the judgment is not mine As I lifted my eyes up to the clear bright sky, I saw the high tower where Jemmy had stood above the buds, seeing that very window and the last look of that poor pretty young mother when her soul bright ened and got free, seemed to shine down from it O man, man, mon ' I says, and I went on my knees beside the bed, in your heart is rent asunder and you are truly penitent for what you did, Our Saviour will have mercy on you yet ' As I leaned my face against the bed, his feeble hand could just move itself enough to touch me I hope the touch was penitent It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak to close , I lifted him back upon the pillows, and I says to him " Can you hear me He looked yes "Do you know me ' ' He looked yes, even yet more plainly ' I am not here alone The Major is with me You recollect the Major > Yes That is to say he made out yes, in the same way as before " And even the Major and I are not alone My grandson-his godson-is with us Do you hear" Aly grandson The fingers made another trial to catch at my sleeve but could only creep near it and fall Do you know who my grandson is 1 " Ates I pitied and loved his lonely mother When his mother lay a dying I said to her My dear this baby is sent to a childless old woman He has been my pride and joy ever since I love him as dearly as if he had drunk from my breast Do you ask to see my grandson before you died "lies ' Show me when I leave off speaking, if you correctly understand what I say He has been kept unacquainted with the story of his birth He has no knowledge of it No suspicion of it. If I bring him here to the side of this bed, he will suppose you to be a perfect stranger It is more than I can do to keep from him the knowledge that there is such wrong and misery in the world, but that twas ever so near him in his innocent cradle, and I have kept from him and I do keep from him, and I ever will keep from him For his mother's sake, and for his own He showed me that he distinctly understood, and the tears fell from his eyes "Now rest, and you shall see him So I got him a little wine and some brandy and I put things straight abouthisbed But I began to be troubled in my mind lest Jemmy and the Major might be too long of coming back A hat with this occupation for my thoughts and hands, I don t hear a foot upon the stairs, and was startled when I saw the Major stopped short in the middle of the room by the e) es of the man upon the bed, and knowing him then as I had known him a little while ago there was anger in the Major s face, and there was horror and repugnance and I don't know what So I went up to him and I led him to the bedside and when I clasped my hands and lifted them up, the Ai nor did the like O Lord I says "Thou know best what we two saw together of the sufferings and sorrows of that Minni, ireetur now with Thee In this dying man is truly penitent, we two together humbly pray Thee to have mercy on him The Major. says Amiens and then after a little stop I whispers him, Dear old friend fetch our beloved boy And the Major, so clever as to have got to understand it all without being told a word, went away and brought him Never never never shall I forget the fair bright face of our box when he stood at the foot of the bed, looking at his unknown father And O so like his dear y owing mother then ' Jemmy I says, "I have found out all about this poor gentleman who is so ill, and he did lodge in the old house once And as he wants to see all belonging to it, now that he is passing away, I sent for you Mr ] poor man ' ' says Jemmy stepping forward and touching one of his hands with great gentleness ' My heart melts for him Poor, poor man' the eyes that were so soon to close for ever turned to me, and I was not that strong in the pride of my strength that I could resist them Aly dalling boy, there is a reason in the secret history of this fellow greater, lying as the best and worst of us must all lie one day, which I think would ease his spirit in his last hour if you would lay your cheek against his forehead, and say ' May God forgive you ' O Gran says Jemmy with a full heart, "I am not worthy ' But he leaned down and did it Then the faltering fingers made out to catch old of my sleeve at last and I be save he was a trying to kiss me when he then 4 4 is 5 4 There my deal ' There you have the story of my Legacy in full, and it is worth ten times the trouble I have spent upon it if you are pleased to like it You might suppose that it set us against the little French town of sense but no we didn't find that I found myself that I never looked up at the high tower atop of the other tower, but the days came back again when that fair young creature with her pretty bullet hair trusted in me like a mother, and the recollection made the place so peaceful to me as I can t express And every soul about the hotel down to the pigeons in the court yard made friends with Jemmy and the Major, and went lumbering away with them on all boats of expeditions in all sorts of vehicles drawn by rampaging cart horses-with heads and w ithout- mud for paint and ropes for harness-and every new friend tires ed in blue like a butcher, and every new horse standing on his hind legs want ing to devour and consume every other horse, and every man that had a whip to crack crack crack crack, crack cracking as if it was a schoolboy with his first As to the Major of) dear that man lived the greater part of his time with a little tumbler in one hand and a bottle of small wine in the other, and whenever he saw anybody else with a little tumbler, no matter who it was-the military character with the taps, of the inn servants at their supper in the court yard, 01 townspeople a chatting on a bench, or country) people a starting home after market down rushes the Major to clink his glass against their glasses and cry-Hola' Vive Somebody' 01 Viv e Something as ii he was beside himself And though I could not quite approve of the Majors doing it still the ways of the world are the ways of the world varying according to different parts of it and dancing at all in the open square with a lady that kept a barber s shop my opinion is that the Major was right to dance his best and to lead off with a power that I did not think was in him, though I was a little uneasy at the Barricading sound of the cries that were set up by the other dancers and the rest of the company, until when I says What are they ever taking out Jemmy Jemmy) says " they're calling out Gran, Bravo the Military English Bravo the Military English which was very gratifying to my feelings as a Briton and became the name the Major was known by But even evening at a regular time we all three set out in the balcony of the hotel at the end of the court ) and looking up at the golden and rosy light is it changed on the great towers, and looking at the shadows of the towers as they changed on all about ourselves included, and what do you think we did there My dear if Jemmy had t brought some other of those stones of the Majors taking down from the telling of former lodgers at Eighty one Norfolk-street and if he did then em out with this speech ' Here )ouoieGion' Here you are Godfather' More of em ' 111 read And though you wrote em for me, Godfather, I know you won t disapprove of my making em over to Gran will you " N of my dear bro) says the Major ' Everything we have is hers, and we are hers "Here even affectionately and devoted), J Jack- man, and J Jackman lumper, ones the Young Rogue giving me a close bug " Very well then Gocf father Look here As gran is in the Legacy way just now, I shall make these stones a part of Gran s Legacy 111 leave em to her What do you say Godfathers ' J J " Hip hip Hurrah ' " says the Major "Very well then" enes Jemmy all in a bustle "Vive the Military English ' Vive the Lady Lix riper ' Vive the Jemmy Jackman Ditto ' Vive the Legacy ' Now, you look out, Gran And you look out, Godfather, 111 read ' And PU tell you what I'll tell you what I'll do besides On the last night of our holiday here when we are all packed and going away, I'll top up with something of my own " " Mind you do sir " says I ? x Don't you've afraid, Gran " enes Young Sparkles . "Now then' I'm going to read Once, twice, three I and away Open your months and shut your eyes. and see what Fortune sends you. All in to begin Look out Gran. Look out Godfather !" So in his lively spirits Jemmy began a reading, and. he read every evening while we were there, and sometimes we were about it late enough to have a candle: burning quite steady out in the balcony in the still air. And so here is the rest of my Legacy my dear that I now hand over to you in this bundle of papers all in the Major's plain round writing. I wish I could hand you the church towers over too, and the pleasant air and the inn yard and the pigeons often coming and perching on the rail by Jemmy and seeming to be critical with their heads on one side, but you'll take as you find.
