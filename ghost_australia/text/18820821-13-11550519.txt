THEATRE ROYAL. MISS POMEROY AS HAMLET. The announcement that Miss Pomeroy would appear at the Theatre Royal on Satur- day night as Hamlet attracted a full house The comparative novelty of the argument and the arduous nature of the task for a lady naturally made the occasion one of interest and Miss Pomeroy's representation of the melancholy Dane was watched with unflag- ging attention from first to last. It would appear that her audience were in nowise disappointed for she was called before the curtain at the end of each act. The plaudits offered as a tribute to the cleverness of the artists were fully justi- fied, but Hamlet, with all his many- BidedneBB, feveriBh perplexities, and vacil- laming infirmity of purpose, is distinctively virile, and no woman can represent character without robbing it of a great deal of its fascinating interest Miss Pomeroy has a very intelligent conception of the part and she does not obtrude any new readings. Though not letter perfect in the text, she is surprisingly accurate, considering he extreme length of the part, and the few occasions on which she has played it Dressed in a sable suit, with flowing yellow hair, on the Fechterian pattern, she looks a delicate handsome, and graceful young, Prince But. the absence of the tragedian's personality is a serious drawback in a character which is all tragic earnestness, and is often torn by storms of pallor Miss Pomeroy s reading of the text was marked by good elocutionary ability and correct emphasis That she has bestowed Borne study on the work was shown by each little incidents as turning away from Polonius, and giving the report about kill- !ng ' so capital a calf, as an aside so that the coarse sarcasm did not reach the cour- tier's ear But she did not succeed in depicting the abiding gloom of an overmastering grief nor was she suffi- ciently impersonal to make any deep im- pression in the highly wrought, patheric scenes All the soliloquies, with the ex- ception of ' To be, or not to be which was marred by an imperfect rendering of the text were given naturally, with a self communing air, and a complete avoidance of any appear- ance of declaiming to the Italia The advice to the players was also a very favourable instance of Miss Pomeroy s elocutionary abilities. The address to the Ghost in the first act was impressive It was marked by the deepest awe and filial reverence Hamlet falling on his knees as he pronounces the word father, and the variety of attitude and vocal inflection throughout the whole of this interview with the apparition gave point to the successive revelations of the spiritual visitor In the scene with Ophelia, in which the King is observed in concealment there was a great want of power It was underfelt and feebly executed This enigmatical out- burst on the part of Hamlet should be full of tenderness, despite the " wild and whirling words, and the admonition " To a nunnery go, should be given in the broken accents of grief. There is a great opportunity for an actor of pathetic power when Hamlet, talking at the concealed liBtenera.diBguiaes his love for Ophelia in the terrible language of a madman. The play scene was arranged with the players at one side of the stage instead of at the back dB IB more customary The audience had in this way, perhaps, a more complete view of the episode During the performance of "The Murder of Gonzaga Miss Pomeroy plays with the manuscript of the mimic tragedy, and when the trick has accomplished its purpose She bursts into the quatrain, " Why let the stricken deer go weep with exultant joy and rage The interview with the Queen, where Hamlet, wrought to the highest point of emotional tension, reproaches his mother in words full of tender pathos and the most exquisite grace and sweetness, was rendered in a matter of fact way, and was wholly disappointing When the Ghost emerged from the painted panel, however, Miss Pomeroy was again impressive, convey- sung by pictorial geBture what she cannot command by physical power The duel with Laertes and the killing of the King were both well managed The death of Hamlet was also pathetic, and not overdone In the last moment all the Prince a thoughts are with his heart friend Horatio, and he makes a motion with his hands to draw his head upon his breast When Salvini played Hamlet he kissed Horatio as Nelson took leave of Hardy Miss Pomeroy a Hamlet judged as a whole, is a performance which is creditable to her intelligence, but it is not Hamlet Its defects are those of want of intensity, pathos, and tragic power The Same amount of ability and industry applied to a feminine character would be followed by more satisfactory results. Female Hamlets are provoking absurdities, and should be banished from the stage. The Queen was carefully played by Miss Carrie George, a painstaking actress, who has long been absent from Melbourne Miss Annie Mayor appeared as Ophelia, a trying part, in which a success is but rarely recorded Miss Mayor made a favourable impression, and will undoubtedly improve on this representation There was nothing stagy or unnatural in her detraction. She has sufficient sensibility to comprehend the touching incident of the young girl a mad near, and she gave the wild, rambling fancies, the Snatches of old ballads, and the rest of the pretty bubble put into the mouth of the " Rose of May" with girlish simplicity, if she did not impress her audience deeply with the reality of Ophelia a derangement The Ghost of Mr H H Vincent was a very intelligible if rather human apparition Mr B N Jones, who enacted Polonius, dressed the part for an old man, but preserved the vigour of youth in his manner and walk. As the character is an illustration of wisdom falling into dotage, it is desirable that its benefits should be well marked King Claudius, in the hands of Mr Carden, was a truly bar- baric looking potentate He did not present the appearance of a monarch who would be troubled with many qualms of conscience. Nevertheless, Mr Carden was effective in the prayer scene. The practice of excising the passage where Hamlet breaks in upon the King at prayer, and determines not to take his life at a moment so favourable to his soul's peace, was adopted on this occasion Miss Pomeroy also adheres to the custom of omitting the irreverent terms Hamlet applies to the Ghost, when the sepulchral voice rises from beneath the stage at the moment his friends are being sworn to secrecy, though they are significant of the Princes disordered state of mind. Mr Elliott's Laertes was over acted. He would have accomplished more had he attempted less. Strong feeling can often be more ef- fectively represented by repose of manner than by melodramatic action. The First Gravedigger, who jests so glibly on his grim calling, and into whose mouth has been put the admirable satire on legal learning, was enacted with phlegmatic humour by Mr G P Carey Mr. Appleton was cast for Horatio, the student friend of Hamlet, who occupies so much of his thoughts, but who, in the acting version of the play, is cut down to a nonentity "Hamlet' will be repeated tonight and during the week until next Saturday, when Mr W E Sheridan will make his first appearance as Louis XI.
