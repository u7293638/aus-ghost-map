HAUNTED BY GHOSTS. vIt is not generally known, in connection with Rudyard Kipling's early life, that to be haunted by a terrible apparition, which took the form of a grandmother's ghost, was almost the constant plague of his existence as a boy. . One day the ' guardian of his youthful years' discovered him in the garden dancing wildly round a small tree and soundly belabouring it with a Btiok. In reply to her anxious ienquiry as to the reason for his strange conduct, young Kipling assured her that she was trying to thrash his grandmother, who was for ever appearing before him in an awful shape. \- Then the good woman took Rudyard's place and Rudyard assumed the role of the bush. He saw no more grandraothera that day at least. Still, as time went on this habit of ap paritions developed in the boy ? who com plained again and again of strange figures being seated in chairs or standing before him. Eventually an oculist waa consulted, who recommended a particular kind of apectaolea, with the result that the apparitions were effectually and per manentlybanished from hia presence.
