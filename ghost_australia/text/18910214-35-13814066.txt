N O WA RA ELIYJ, CEYLON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, Novara Elly is the principal sanatorium or hill station of Ceylon, and is in an undulating plain at an elevation of 3000ft above sea level there is a lake, with a drive six miles round it, upon the plain, and said to be stocked with brown trout, I was told that some had been caught 20in long The climates generally cool, and sometimes there are frosts, and at the time of my visit I noticed the thermometer went down to 18' at night, although It stood about 34 in the day seven years ago Nuvvara 1 life was not easily noces able, for there was a long, tedious uphill drive of indefinite duration, that was too fatiguing and rough for the average holiday seeker of a cool retreat, but now there is a railway to Nanuoya, which is 128 miles from Colombo, at an elevation of 600ft above BOH level, and from the railway station at Nannoyaisn good load to Nunora, Lliya, a distance of five miles by conveyance, running between the two places 1000ft , but the original road to Nuwara Lliya was through European and the Rum bodor Pass, and had its origin in military necessity for after the Fund an King was doped- In 1845 and his dominions invented in the British Crown, the chiefs kept up a guerilla warfare against the rule of strangers throughout the hill country, and for more than a year they defied every effort of the British In ISIS The chiefs were captured and the country became tranquil, but Sir Edward Barnes, in order to transport his forces to any part of the mountains, had a nnllUirv road made through Gampola, a residence of Singalese royalty, and while Nuwara Eliya and no doubt, being pleased at finding a cool retreat after swamp, and hint of Colombo, he erected a residence for himself there, still known as Barnes Hull, now the Grand Hotel It appears that Sir I- Burns took a considerable interest in the place, and not only in side a good road to it, but by living a portion of the year there drew attention to it is a sanatorium, and bud barracks erected thereon for the use of the military men. Most of the Oovornoraainco have resided a portion of every year there, and there is an official residence erected for their use Most tourists when in Ceylon pay a visit to Nuwara Eliya, and the scenery both to it and when there can- not be surpassed, for not only are the mount una bold and lofty, but the valleys are filled with the richest vegetation, with beautiful varieties of colour. The place has a certain amount of interest from the fact that Sir Samuel Baker and his brother started a large farming establishment there in 18.1 the j position of the farm was near the end of the lake, towards Hiikgata, and adjoining the road to II iron Plums, but I saw, in a description of it that I re id- Though the effort did not meet with the success which the energy and enterprise of its promotors deserved, It can hardly be said to have been barren in results since it has produced two of the most delightful bor les of travel and may nature that are to be found in the new enormous repertoire of such literature." The books referred to are " 1 levin Years in Ceylon," by Sir b V Barker, and "RIllo and Hound in Ceylon," by the same author The plain of Nuwara I'llja IS surrounded with tops of mountains, for being elevate 1 already 1200ft. and the highest mountain being 82i)<>ft , there is only 2000 more to climb to the highest I idurutilagulu, abbreviated to Pedro, is the highest mountain in Ceylon, 8295ft, and 2000ft. above Nuwara Lliya the ascent is easy and a bridle path goes up all the way the distance being about five miles from the Grand Hotel On the top there is a grand view of mountain scenery, and includes all the principal speakers Ceylon Adam's Peak, In the Maskllya district, compare, nour Horton's Plains, and Niiuiunakula, in the Uva district Persons going to the top of Mount Pedro should go early in the morning, as the mountain mists come on later in the day and obstruct the view There is a very nice drive to the Rakaia Experi- mental Gardens, which are 300ft below Nuwara Lliya and 200ft above sea level they are distant about six miles , the gardens are very good and well worth visiting, but considering the climate, soil, and position, I think much more could be made of them, but probably they are stinted for funds From a portion of this garden there is a very Una view of the Uva district lying thousands of foot below, and also the distant mountain peaks and ranges The IIiiLgalu Mountain (600ft ) and rooks ore away above the gardens at some considerable distance, and it is said that large V andura monkeys are frequently to be seen jumping from tree to tree in the jungle out top of and round the rocks, but I did not see any monkeys or even the ghost of a monkey , but perhaps they only come there in the summer, and I was there in the winter I noticed at Nuwuro Eliza, and all around in the mountains a great quantity of rhododendrons growing in all directions, being a dark crimson flower They are in- digenous plants, and I saw some that were probably as much as 300 years old I observed that they disappeared altogether at about GOOCH level above the sea Now, it seems to me to be an interesting question as to how that species of plant cane at that elevation, for it will not grow at a lower level in this slim etc, and is a, plant of a different species to any in the lower levels The rhododendrons are mountain shrubs in their natural habitat in all countries, although of different varieties, but, did this particular rhododendr m develop itself by natural selection for the place it now occupies, or, if not, how did it get there. I will leave this for others to decide for I do not pretend to know, and it certainly is a difficult matter to solve As however, we have no memory native rhododendrons in New South ".Yii]CB, and the cultivated sorts do not thrive in the low lands of the colony, it is possible that the rhododendron might be cultivated, or grafted with European cultivated kinds and produce a plant that would suit our climate, and there are tens of thousands of young plants to be got bore The eucalyptus and different species of mimosa flout Ish at No wife Elly, and there are some fine trees in that locality The eucalyptus is often planted as a break wind on tea plantations, and as boundary lines, which answer a double purpose of a break-wind and making the boundaries Tea plantations are to be seen around the plain of Nuwara Lliya in the various mountain sides up to about 7000ft above sea level, and cinchona trees in the rests of the slopes and among the tea plants I noticed miles of hedges here formed with spires shrub planted close together, and forming a good rose hedge, willett must look exceedingly well in the spring, and it must be a mass of white blossom A few miles from the Grand Hotel at Nuwara Lliya ara the Elk Plains, and also some few miles further the Horton Plains These are very elevated, the latter being 7000 feet above sea level I did not travel over those plains, for I thought it could not be particularly safe if what was said about the wild animals inhabiting those plains was true, being informed that there were roaming about these plains wild elephants, the elie, red deer, house door, wild boars, largo squirrels, wild cats, the leopard, burns, and the jungle fowl I was also informed that if I took some coolies and camped out I might shoot on elephant, but as I had not been in the habit of shooting elephants had no ambition for such large game as elephants and leopards and sol sluiced at the hotel and read the newspaper, wherein I saw an advertisement offering; Xi reward to any one who would destroy a rogue elephant in a certain district On inquiry I ascertained that a rogue elephant was one who had broken away from the herd and had got vicious, and would kill anyone he happened to meet and knock down the native huts and fences, and so was an awkward customer to meet in a narrow road, and BII I determined that I would check my sporting proclivities on this occasion until a safe opportunity offered There are some very nice drives at Nuvvara Lliya, one round the Moon Plains, eight miles, so called because of the moonstone found there by the natives, and I was assured by some persons who had a great quantity for sale that those Blom ore coming into fashion, and greatly sought after There is also a very fine drive over the Rambodda Pa is the road to Cambodia, the pass being OOUOft above the sea, and the view of the plains below and the numerous valleys and mountains well repay a long journey to see, Nuwarra Eliya, which means " City of Light " in the native language, has several hotels, a club, Governor residence, two or three churches, a general's resi- fence, post and telegraph offices, hospital, low court, police station, gaol, lawn tennis club and cricket club, bank, reading room, council chambers, general stores, and natives bazaars, so that the City of Light, if rather e wanted among the clouds, has all the comforts of civilisation, as well us grand scenery for welcomes its visitors I am, c, JOHN YOUNG.
