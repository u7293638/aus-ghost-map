A Candy Loving Ghost. From the Council Bluffs Nonparbil. A very singular circumstance is Baid to have occnrred in a family in this city, a few duyB ago. It appears from what information we have, that the family was silting in what is called a circle, and were supposed to be holding communion with tbe inhabitants of the other world, when a little girl formerly known by tho family, who had died some time before, came, and as she had promised, piaced in the hand of tbe head of the family a piece of enndy , In their circle this girl had frequently been a visitor and had often said that she wou.d bring him some candy, but had never done it before until the oceasiou above mentioned. The candy was pronounced genuine, nnd. is still preserved and shown as evidence of the fact, together with tho word of the family that it came in the manner described. It is in the form of a piece of stick candy. What is iÂ»os: remarkable, it is asserted that when held in the hand and thereoy subjected to animal heat it ischanged in shape to a perfect representation of a rose ; that when the animal heat is withdrawn it returns back to its original shape. This wonderful phenomena, we are told, has been witnessed by a n amber of our citizens whose testimony would not be questioned by any ono on any othor subject hosidestbatof spiritualism and phenomenon of what is termed materializa tion, We have not bud tho opportunity of HGfeinp tho fiiindv ntir<plinq. unH dnn'f. otp poet to, but give it to onr renders as a cif- cumstance which we h ive been informed by a number of persons is correct.
