THEwordsof parting, "Adieu," Farewell," " Good-bye," express the gamut of our sorrow on a friend's departure. " Adieu" is somewhat frigid and ceremonious. It is like a graceful bow. With "Farewell" wo despatch on his voyage a trusty friend just as we grip his hand on departure ; but in " Good-bye" lies hid a whole volcano of feeling. Translated into action, it expresses the impassioned embrace of the lover, or the long, steadfast gaze in a dear friend's eyes as we press his hand before he leaves for years, it may well be forever.
