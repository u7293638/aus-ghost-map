A RETURN PICNIC TO MESSES. E ' E,ICH AND CO.'S EMPLOYEES. .- , : .After the recent picnic .given ,hy Messrs. E. Eich and Co.'s employees, many of Chose who had accepted their kindly hospitality ex pressed tiiemselves an desirous of giving a return. Accordingly several ladies and gentlemen took the matter op .and set to work to bring the idea to a happy conclusion. They were, however, through uuforseen circumstances, Iseset with many difficulties, one of the most serious being the faptthat the steamer could puit. be /Obtained on the day' selected. -Itwasfomid.iiiatthe picnic must be held on Sfiturdayiast nor ; not at all, and consequenay^ionly &' fewl days time was auoxred in. which to provide everything. However, -y working early and late, this was accomplished, and through the' generous aid of many of the business townspeople, all the necessaries .were obtained in astonishingly quick time. The ladies, fpver whom Miss Neil superintended, did the ghosting, cook ingaad roasting, and Mr. W. Braithwaite assisted by others, made all arrangements with ihe: business people, and spent much ?time and labor in obtaining the hundred and' one tilings required for the day. Friday last was an extremely .hot clear day, and the jmany.picnicers, especially the fair eex^ pre pared for ainilar weather on Saturday. ;But 'Man proposes and the Clerk of the Weafcher disposes,' and ono may judge of the general aisappointment when Saturday morning broke with a southerly gale, blowing clouds of dust, with dark ?ominous looking clouds overhead. Many, who had looked forward *6 a pleasant day's outing, simply- garo up the idea, and others held themselves ready in case the enn should make ids appearance: Nothing daunted, however, the promoters determined to have the day, and, Mr. Brailhwaite collected Ms men, wno Tery Boon, had everything stowed on board the e.s. ' Uxcelsior, wMch Vessel had been kindly lent by Messre. E. Eich &Co.; for the occasion.! Captaia Grundy assisted in every way,'and shortly after 10 o'clock flie steamer left for ^ the ground. The cargo 'was quickly deposited on shore, and by the time 1iie first load of pic nioers arrived, viz. 1.30 p.m, ?«veryt3ung was ready and in apple-pie order. The spot choseu was a beautifully green one, about five miles down the river, and although the wind was still blowing strongly, there was no dust. The vessel returned to Bonrke for those who had been unable to leave business earlier than 2 p.m., and then a piece of bad luck was ex perienced. Just before the steamer arrived at the wnart a. smart shower of rain fell, and many who had once more ventured out after their first disappointmect, returiiecl toine again. The consequence was that instead ol 400 people beingpresent, little more than half that numbor wore counted. Before the last ^p*^vl|^'-Si»ntid^r^\''wMfiwlsItei^.^m/ the sun shone out brightly, and the gale sub sided into a pleasant breeze, and one of the most pleasant ifternoons ever experienced in \- ;iflJt'.3ffllfrpa8't» two o'clock dinner was served, andifctlid one good to watch how the Victuals weretnade scarce. The sharp wind ?of the inorning had produced wonderful appetites, which gave the presiding ladies and gentlemen something to do to satisfy Th^:w^^pnghaM:3)Jenty for all, how ever,* and tS' ^he^'iragments 4efe . were the historical ?« twelve IjastolB fvOl.'
