Official Insolence \+ — to the editor of the sun. Sir,— A few days ago I lost three of mv valuable Irish terrier pups through poisoning. The breath was barely out of the last one which died nien the Boulder Health Inspector came round to lit T? QnAU flfln m A -J ""vpj muu iu u Ultiurtbvlldl LUUC tbreatened me with prosecution if I did not bury the unfortunate canine forth-, with. I explained to him that it had just " given up the ghost," and suggested that as he was on the spot — literally in at the death— he must have had some idea of the perpetrator of the dastardly deed, and I asked him to give me the mis creant's name, so that I might put the police on his track, and have him pun ished. The Inspector's reply was a round of abuse, with the parting shot that "he would see me in hell first," My object in troubling your readers with tbis purely personal grievance is that writing to The Sun is my only redress, as a complaint to the Council abont this par ticular Bumble would only result in my being snubbed for daring to complain about one who, in their eyes, can do no wrong. — Yours &c..; R.
