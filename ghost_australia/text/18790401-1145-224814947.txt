THE QUEENSLAND NATIVE POLICE ENGAGED TO CATCH THE KELLY GANG. - Page 56. ine pictures are engraved trompnotograpns, and our readers are so Avell aware of everything in connection Avith the Kelly Gang, and the various methods , suggested for their capture, that we need only say . that the Queensland black trackers have been engaged to track the Kelly s, and it is supposed that if those worthies. only give the trackers half a ghost of a chance to see their track, a capture will be easily effected. Unfortunately, although the. blacks can track Avhen going at full gallop on horseback, the anti pathy shoAvn by Ned and his folloAvers in the matter of leaving tracks has so far resulted in Lieutenant O'Connor and his savages being Avhat may be termed in bush parlance " Up a tree." Nobody knows where the Kellys are. They may be in the Strathbogie Ranges, in Victoria, New South Wales, or they may be " out on the ocean Avave " en route to America â€” who can tell ?
