SATURDAY'S CBICKET. THE only first eleven match was that in the Gtaxdens -Alberts verms Unions for the Prentice Cup* The scores stood, Alberts first innings 14 runs ahead, second innings four for sixty-two with Dixon not out 27. Remembering the total of 60 for two innings made by the Unions in their Stanley match it looked a soft thing for the senior club, especially when it became known that the curly bowler was too ill to play. But you never know what may happen in cricket. The Union skipper which put himself on to bowl and got two wickets first over. Nobody knew he could bowl: it was an artful surprise; most folks, how ever, don't know it yet. However, he was successful. Toller bagged two more pretty easily, and the Albert innings terminated (Shield being sick and Street down too late), total 74 runs. The Unions commenced with the Captain and Bertie. They were not separated till 50 was made, and the requisite number of runs were hit off with the loss of four wickets. White played vigourous cricket for his 33, but was let off three limes. Bertenshaw's 21 was a much better perfor mance. Pretty wristy play without the ghost of a chance. Tb e emergency Street got 3 wickets out of 4. The Toowong ground was occupied by the second elevens and the result was reversed. The Unions made 46 and 9 for 70 to the Alberts' 57-one day match. Top scores, Phillips 28, Perkins not out 24, A. Walsh 20 and 11. At Petrie Terrace the local club defeated'the second Carlton by 47 runs.
