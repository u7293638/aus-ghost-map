POPULAR SCIENCE PAPERS. SEEING A GHOST. ••••• Br DK. AKMlEW WI1.50X. Is tins matter-of-fact age of oars, there arc . to be found, I fancy.few believers in ghosts. : The spectre of old was, to niy.-way of thinking, rather a fiesli-.intJ-Wood kind;.r,f:visitant./.

Still, r^pposeghoste' of old, were facts to our forefather!--. They peopled tliat world of the Jm^jna&iy.-xhiuliij; jor many persons even 111 our own day, borders on the wolld of waking • life, and onthc. stern realities of- existence;.. In 1 the olden times, science, besides, was by no means of an . ad-, vanced nature.' indeed, in so far as the details of the nervous system were concerned,.isciehc.e' might be said to have sc&Tcely;, been bora'hal£a century or so gone by. - • To-day, thc ghost has . mostly gone 1 he way. of aU—ivell, it would liardly suffice to say "flesh :" but it certainly represents an idea which has Jargely f ramslied- Jrom sober humau-afiiurs; .dispelicd;;lifce : tbe.. lnorniug xdoads.by the light of. the ;poming;day. Science.has exorcised tlie ghostsand'-spectres of the past into a- notbmgnes:: on the one band, while,-on the other hand, KheT ti'elevated the study of spectral illusions into: .somewhat.; fascinating branchof mind- philosophy. It-may therefore be interesting, if ..we Jen'deavjim, ;t0': discuss, as pbiulv and exactly as may be possible, what 'science. hastosay on the subject of; ghosts aad-gliost-seeing.'-- : ;Y ;- The beginning of the study is really fonnd in alnowledge of how we see and hear, and exercise our Eenses at. large. 'When our eyes., light on an ohject, we really see it, not Willi the organ of -sight, but -with the ,biuin. ;' "Seeing,. like bearing, or any. other sensory wpik,- after. all .is said and.done,, is truly'a work-of the luind. The knowledge of what avesee, is .the' result of .an intellectual exercise. I-: Eye mid car merely supply details on whicli the mind-acts? and forms its judgments ; and, be' it remarked, these judgments are often, great mistakes and obvious failures. The eye thus plays the part of a- receiving olhce" fer tile-(bi-ain.-^ lt re ; ; ceivcs the rays of light which pass through its pupil, and impinge upon its- leases. ;-Itinbdifies : these light-rays; parcels aBd assorts thorn out. and fits them for travelling along tbe ::ojpticiierv.e' (or that 01 sight) to the part of the brain which rules and regulates the tense iu question._-. The; close approach, to .a kind of-ocular photography, which takes place in the jinrple-colour of the. eye, thus shows us that seeing is first of ;all a. matter of collecting, fixing, and tr.niitir.Itfiii,.; pictures of things. that these pictures iii ftiru Sre sent, m one shupe or another, loibehrai". It, is only when the " sensation " of sight, as we term - it, -has been • received, and; registered in and-by the-braw,-that we really can ba said to. •'see. 1 ': iWith-thc ear, .-the ;,case is identical. Waves of sound are assorted, tested, and finally modified, so that the brain-parts which deal with hearing may- determine their .true nature.. When we: listen to. au orchestral sympboiiy, the multitude of harmonies is, only appreciated when the brain's work an hearing has .been duly performed; and bow'intricate that work, and also the labour of the ear, umst. be, may be better imagined than described. - , ~'rfi: ! -% Nowif, as I have shown, :ldiere is.: aj-per- Jietual passage o£ messages or sensations from eye, car, and other-sense-organs, inwirds to the: brain; gmng rise to:®e couscidiisncssipf things seen, heard, felt, aDd eo : fortlji- itis "iioiie'She less a fact,: that occasionally this process is reversed.: -Sensations -of sight and sound and Eniell and taste, are known: to.4e capableof being-seat outwards lnstead..b£:invvalilB.•-.In' place of these sensations -or messages 'coming from the-outer-world to thc; brain, ttcy.JMy: come back-from.the brain, along the nerves of .sense, to .eye, ear, ..nose, or tongue.. •; Itjsas if the bram had the power of .projecting.forwards. the messages it once received from <the outside world. Perhaps it may actually originate such reversed messages or sensations;-but it is safer to assume that the common state of things represcnts thereversionof messages originally received from the outside. What, it may be asked,is the .efiect upon the eye and car of these returned sensatious-^.-I.reply/they.'producV.'in the individual who isiihe 1 subject.of them sen 1 eations. of .sight and "heanng. The : pereon " sees " or " hears':.—that is, imagines he sees or bears—things and .sounds -which, have ;no. .- existence outside himself..- This is what science.: scalls subjective sensation ; and this.is how. tlie "ghosts " of oui daily life aTe raised JExample will illustrate the matter more poirerfuTly than precept. WhenJMacbeth. sees & -dagger before him, the weapqn iis be^elOn' hiB "mmd's eye," to quote ihe words df another Shatesperean • hero. He sees the dagger; to others it is invisible. • It is a 'f edili-" age of his bram-" to put the 'msitter -poetically. •; it is a subjective sensation, to -put it': scieritifically; at is the-"ghost" of adagger, to piit it practically..".
