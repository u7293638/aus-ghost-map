V.B.C. SPRING MEBTING. OAKS DAY. IBy Telegraph.! [From our Special Reporter. I Flemington, November 5. The off-day, generally the most pleasant of tbe Spring Meeting, wa3 attended to-day with disagreeable weather, a high wind blowing, accompanied by clonds of dnst. The atten dance was small in comparison with other days, and the racing was very poor. Several hot favourites were beaten, but there was not mnch betting on the Flying Stakes and Steeplechase. An accident occurred in the last race, through which three horses fell in front of the Stand. Fortunately none of the riders were hurt. The horses which fell wereDoncaster, Grace Darling, and King ship, and the former was tilled on the spot. Only four went to the post for the Maiden Plate, and liberal odds were laid on the New Zealand colt, Winchester. The race was run at a very slow pace, the favourite leading all the way, but Derritt very nearly threw the race away through easing Winchester up in the last few strides. Few of the bookmakers would field against Acme at any price, and this was fortunate for backers, as the boy could not manage her at all, and she was never in the. race. Blairgowrie and Maddelina were always in {front, and the Sydney colt won easily at the finish. The time was very slow, owing | to the horses having to face a gale of wind. Sixteen numbers were hoisted for the Spring Handi cap. At the finish St. John was made a hot favourite, but Ceriseand Blne, Lantern, Chuckster, and Lesbia were heavily backed. Lavington made the pace a cracker from the jump. At the home turn there were only five in it, but the severity of the race just suited Cerise- and-Blue, who, steered by her light weight, had no diffi culty in going to the front at thel.distance and winning easily by two lengths from Velo cipede and Lavington. Only five weighed ont for the Royal Park Stakes, and oddawere laid on Trenton. The race was only run in the last aix furlongs, but even at this handicap Trenton had no difficulty in settling the opposition. First Chester and Isonomy both cut up very badly. After the second race Joseph Thompson was brought before .the Stewards for using abuBive lan guage to a gentleman in the paddock, and the Leviathan was ordered to apologize, the Chairman at the same time informing Thomp son that if he came before the Stewards again he would be warned off the course for ever. The Ring were content to take 2 to 1 that Urallawent down in the Oaks, but Hales took the mare to the front, and sailing along from end to end she won in a canter by two lengths. The Steeplechase was an amusing farce. The presence of Denmark frigh tened the owners of Bob Cooper, Lady ABhton, and Meander into scratching their horses, andjmly the very moderate Trickett and The Banker opposed the crack, Den mark led them over two fences, and then down he came, and made for the sheds. Even then he would have had time to win, bat after being caught he came aa far as the Stand and fell once more. About the same time Trickett and The Banker both fell. The former was the first up, but his rider stuck to the straight instead of coming prade and jumping the last two fences. The Banker in the meantime was caught and completed the course, with Denmark second. A protest was at once entered against Trickett, and the race was awarded to The Banker. A large field went to the post for the Veteran Stakes, Britisher, Cerise and-Blue, The Agent, Metal, and others being freely supported. The Btart was a very bad one, and after they had gone 100 yards Grace Darling fell and brought down Doncaster and Kingship, while Comet collided with one of the falling horses and got rid of his rider. Cerise-and-Blue, The Agent, and Britisher were the first into the straight, and after an interesting set-to Britisher won by a length. The following are the details:— MAIDEN HATS.

Directly the word was given Winchester took up the running from Parwan and Cyclops, and made play round the torn at a very slow pace, Percussion bringing np the rear. Along the back the order was the same, and no attempt was made to go to the leader until coming to the turn, when Cyclops moved up and entered the straight on Winchester':) girths, with Parwan and Percussion also closing. At the distance Winchester had the race won, but Derritt eased np before reaching the post, and Sandersjseeing this made arush on Cyclops, who was only beaten by half a neck. Two lengths oS Par wan was third, with Percussion last. lime, 2 min. 64J sec THE FLYING STAKES. A sweepstakes of 5 sots, each, 1 ft, with 200 added.

The favourite got oS very badly, Maddelina, Blairgowrie, and Chesham being the first away, and as [they came on Acme was seen to be swerv ing all over the course with her tiny pilot. At the tan Blairgowrie and Maddelina were in front, and as they came to the course proper Acme took third place, but she immediately cut in towards the rails and lost all chance. Blair gowrie was now left with the lead, and he held ic to the end, winning easily by two lengths from Mad delina, who beat Chesham three lengths for second place.

They were kept at the post some time, but at last Mr. Watson was successful in dropping hia flag to a splendid start. Velocipede, Camerine, and Laving ton were the first to begin, and Lavington at once took np the running from Camerine, with Veloci pede, Chuckster, Cerise-and-Blue, and St John heading the others. At the bridge LaTington was going on from Camerine. Velocipede, and Cerise and- Blue, with fct John, Chuckster, and Lantern at the head of the others, Merman being strung out in the rear. Lavington was leaoing a full three lengths along the back stretch, but at the 'abattoirs Lantern and Cerise-and-Blue drew nearer to him, the others being headed by Velocipede, Gratitude, and Came rine. There was no change passing the sheds, and Lavington led to the turn, but Cerise-and-Blue eanght him entering the straight, and Velocipede, St John, and Herrimu were the only others left with a chance. At the distance Cerise- and-Blue was well in front from Lavington, Velocipede, and St John, and the lightly weighted four-year-old going on at her ease won by two lengths from Velocipede, who beat Laviagton by a neck for second place. Then came Merrimu fourth, St. John fifth, Camerwe Birth, with Meiman last all the way. Time, 2 mm. IHE SOTAL PABK STAKES. A sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, 2 ft, with 200 added.

No attempt was maJe to increase the speed until passing the abattoirs, when Dunlop Trenton, and Isonomy took close order, and entering the straight Trenton went to the front.

Denmark went to the front and led ovar the double, but at the next fence he fell and bolted to the scraping-sheds. Trickett then went on with a long lead of Banker, and they got on safely enough until a mile from home, when Doth fell. Denmark, in the meantime, had been remounted, but at the second of the quadruple he fell again. Trickett was remounted, and eventually Banker was got coiDg, while Kilduff was quickly in the saddle. Trickett then had matters his own way, but his rider went the wrong course, thereby miss ing the last of the fences. Banker jumped his last fence safely, and cantered in a hundred yards in front of Denmark. Time, 7 min. 25J sec A pro test was at once entered against Trickett, and he ?was disqualified.
