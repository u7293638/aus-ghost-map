Indeed, the (\King himself noticed as mucli when Hokosa made.the: customary formal application to .him to HHiictiou the expedition, irr-.« So be it,' he said ; ' though myself I have lost faith, in such rites. , Also, Hokosa, I think-it likely that although your.v" w'ife goes out with córapahy, she.will return alone.'., í;.í Why, King1!' ask«<d Hokosa.

Save for your sake I - do not sorrow thereat, for, to speak truth, I, grow very weary,'and he snailed sadly.' Hokosa went home .alarmed and full of bitterness, for he had' never 'guessed that the 'seivant of the Messenger,'as he called Nod weiiiîo,' the Kin«, knew so much, about him and Iiis plans. His full was hard to him, and to be thus measured up, weighed, and con temptuously forgiven was almost, .more than he could bear." it. was the white prophet who had done this thing. Ha had told Nod wengo of his, Hokosa's, share in the plot to murder the late King Uni su ku, though how lie carne to know of-that'mattHr was beyond guessing. He hitd watched him, or. caused him'to be watched, wheti he went forth to consult spirits in the place'bf'' the dead ; he had .' warned Nodwengo. against .hihi. .Worst. bf ? all, he had dared to treat him with . contempt, hud pleaded for his life and safety, sb that he was spured as rash spare a snake from which, the charmer has drawn his . fangs, . When they met àt the gat» of the King1'«houseyouder, this white thief, who had stolen his place and power, had even smiled upon him and greeted him kindly, and doubtless while he smiled, hy aid of the- magic he possessed; ' had read him through and gone on to tell the story to tho King.1 Well, of this there should be un end.' ' He would kill the ? Messenger or him self he killed. When Hokosa reached his kraal he found Norna sitting beneath a fruit, tree that/grew in it, .idly employed in ..strinuiug.ibeadsj for the work of the household ,. she . left to his other wife,-Ziriti, an old and homely woman, I who thought more of the browing of the beer and the. boiling of the porridge than of re ligions or politics, or. of the ¡will . of kings.

AH he stood thus ho «aw a woman advancing towatd him, who carried on her head a Small,basket of fruit, and know.: her for. one of.those whoso hnsinoss it was to wait upon tho Messenger in his huts, or;'rather,! in, his -house, for br now-ho hud Imilt, himself a house, and noar it a little chapel." This woman suw Hokosa also, and looked at him sideways,, as though she would like to stop and::speak to him, but feared todo so.. '. . . . : : 'Good morrow to you . friend,'ho said, f How goes it with your husband and your house ¥ '?' Now.Hokosa knew well that this woman's husband .had taken a dislike to tier and driven her from his home, tilling her place with-, one younger, .and niure attractive. At tho question tho woman's lips began to tremble,. and her eyes swain with tears.- . ' Ali, great dootor,' she said,, ' why do you I ask pf my husband.) Haye you not heard that he has.drivon me away, and that another takes iriy place V ., . Do.I hear all the gossip of thin towoi' asked Hokosa .with a .smile, ' But come in and tell me the story. .Perchance.I may he able, to help you, for I have .charms, to com pel the fancypf siioh faithless pues.',,-, : The woman looked round - and seeing that there was no one in sight she slipped swiftly through th» . gate of the kraal, which, he closed behind lier. * Norna,' said Hokosa,.' hero .is one., who tolls uie tliHt her husband has deserted her, and who comes to seek my counsel. Bring her milk to drink.' ' There are some wives who would not find i that so great" an evil,' replied Norna, mockingly, as she rose to do his bidding. ~ ; Hokosa winced at the sarcasm, and turri t to his visitor, said : Now tell ine'yoúr tale, but say first, why 'ou sb frightened. / uni frightened,, master,' she answered, hy should, haye.seen.mo enter.here, for heoome u Christian, and the Chris .e forbidden : to, consult the witch as . we wera wont to do. For my 1 to set it out,' broke in Hokosa, 'and. .'.I see it written on your husband has put you away and woman, your own half sister, ught up from a child.' you haye heard aright.' * eard, I look upon you and I I not a wizard? Toll me ng dust into his band, he this way and that, regarding ?' Yes, it is so. Lust night . - '^cirtf^ longer,. and ^revealed yourself, . upbraiding them. Then your rival taunted you and stirred him up -with bitter wordB, till "? at length he took a stick and beat you from the door, and there is the mark of it upon your shoulder.' ' It is true ; it is too tote 1' she groaned. ' fes, it is true. And now, what do you wish from me f 'Master, I wish medicine to make! my husband hate my rival and to draw his beare 1 back to be." 'That must bo a strong medicine,'said Hokosa, 'which will turn, a mau from one who is young and beautiful to one who is past her youth and ugly.' ' £ am as 1 am,' answered the poor woman, with a touch of natural dignity, ' but at least I have loved him and worked for him for twelve long years. ' And that is why he would now be rid of you, for who cumbers'his kraal with old. cattle? - . ' . 'Abd yet-at timos they are the best, muster. .Vrinkle' and smooth skin seeuv strange upon ont» pillow,' shu added, glano-: ing at Norna, who came from the hut carry ing a bowl of milk io her hand. ' '? . ' ? 'If you seek counsel,' said Hokosa,' quickly, ' why do you not go to .the white," man, .that Messenger, in whom you believe, and ask him for u potion to turn your hus band's heart?' ' MaHter, I havi» been to him,"-and rio is very good to mo, for when I wes driven out he gave me work to do and fond/ But ho told me that he had no medicine for mich cases, and that the Great Man in the sky alone could soften the breast of my husband and cause my sister to cease from her wicked ,'neBs; Last night I went to see if he would i do it, and you know what befell me there:' ;. 'That befell you which befalls all fools ;wh<> put their trust in words »lone. ? What I will you pay me, woman, if I give you the medicine which you seek V Alas, Master, l ani poor. I have nothing ito offer you, for when 1 would not stay in my husband's kraal to be a servant to his new wife he took the coiv and the (ive seats,. that belonged to me, UK, I being childless cording to our ancient.

'Yet, hoeause I have pity on you, I will ho content with very little. Give me that basket of fruit, for my ?wife has hoon sick, and loves the tasto of it.' ! ' J cannot do that, muster,' answered the woman, ' for it is sent by my hand as a present to the Messenger, and he knows this, and will eat of it after he has made prayer to-day. Did I not give it to him, it would bo discovered that 1 had left it here with you.' ' Then begone without you medicine,' said Hokosa, ' for I need such fruit.' . . The woman-rose and said, looking at him .wistfully : ' Master, if you will be satisfied with other fruit . of the same sort, I know where I can get them for you.' When will you get them V ? , ' Now, ? within au hour. And .till I re turn I will leave these in pledge with you,' ?but these and no othor t must give to the: Messenger, for he has already seen'them, und might dincovei" the difference ; also 1 have promised to do so.' , .As you will,' said Hokosa. . If yon are here with the fruit within an hour the medi cine will be ready for you, a medicine that shall not fail.' " TO-BE CONTINUED.' -
