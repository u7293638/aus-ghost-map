BABY NICHOLLS' COMPANY. The Baby Nicholls' Tourist Party gave an entertainment on Monday night at the San Remo Shire Hall. The programme was very lengthy and amusing, the singing being both comic and sentimental, and was well appreciated by the audience. The programme consisted of two parts. In the first part thfc company entered on (the jstage at once, including the corner 'men, the tambourine and bones.. Most of the songs included a. â€¢ or&ushed; up with a chorus, when ae~la<Ees of the company were encored on every occasion. Besides the songs and dances there were two amusing farces, "The Ghost Walks" and '.'-Wanted a Servant Man," which suited the children, and sent them hoine talking of what they had seen. The entertainment was not so largely attended as it might4iave been, as on these dark lights people"cannot get about. It is to be hoped when this troupe again visits us it will be moonlight, as those who were not present missed a treat. The same performances were held at Grantville on Saturday night and at Bridge Creek on Tuesday night.
