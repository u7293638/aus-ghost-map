????? ^''V ??;.?. ??'? .ROME. ?'?x.'r:-^--\\\\- ? , , HOW AND WHEN THE POPE; MADE DR. WALSH ARCHBISHOP. At nine b clock on Sti, John's Eve (writes the Roman; correspondent 'of the i Dublin Nation, July 4) the' Pope was giving audience to the Secretary of Propaganda; for Orientar;Rites. No question touching the Latin Church has place at this audience, and '?. as a rule .none is i ever touched. The Holy Father, however, on that occasion, interrupting the business of ; the even ing, desired the secretary to inform the authori ties at Propaganda that they could proceed to expedite the necessary Bulls, 'for We have nominated an Archbishop to Dublin.' ' And the name, Holy Father?' Taking a pen, the Pope wrote on the back of a document before him, ' Walsh.' 'We desire also,' said his Holi ness, ' that Ireland should have the first intima tion. Tell the news, therefore, to no man, ex cept to the Cardinal Secretary of State, the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda; who will for ward the. information, and. if not too late, yoo may go, to the Irish College. No doubt Monsignor Kirby would wish to give early notice to his friends.' And so, before the fires of ; Saint John had died out, the President, of Maynooth was officially invested with the authority and jurisdiction :of Arch bishop of Dublin. Ad imdtos annosl for the good of faith and fatherland, with due praise and thanks to the faithful Irish members who by overthrowing the Gladstone : Cabinet has tened, if they did not bring1 about, this happy result. What will the pious Cawtbolic ladies of Dublin do now?â€” they who used to toss their heads, throw up' the' whites of their beautiful eyes, and tremble 'for' the Church in Ireland if those vulgar Nationalists' got their way ! They used strong language, which repeated now would be blasphemy. Bishops are apppirited by the Holy Ghost;, it ...will.: be interesting to watch . how thisdoctrinei is appveciated bj the unsuc cessful minority.' :'_,,-
