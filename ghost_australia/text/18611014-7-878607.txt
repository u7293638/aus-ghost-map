POETRY. THE COMET, 1861. .Ã® Terroresque in cole, et signa magna.' '-S. Lue. xxi. I. Whence art thou ? sudden comot of the sun ! In what far depths of God thine orient place 1 Whence hath tbj world of light such radiance won, To gleam and curve along the cone of space ? II. Why comest thou ? weird wanderer of the air ! What is thine oracle for shuddering eyes ? Wilt thou some myth of crownleas kings declare, Scathed by the fatal banner of the skies? III. Or dost thou glide, a seething orb of doom, Bristling with penal fires, and thick with souls, The sever'd ghosts that throng thy peopled womb Whom Azrael, warder of the dead, controla ? IV. Throne of some lost archangel ! dost thou glare After long battle, on that conquering height? Vaunt, of a victory, that is stiU, dispair, A trophied horror on the arch of night ! v. But lo ! another dream, thou starry god ! Art thou the mystic seedsman of the sky 1 To shed new worlds along thy radiant road That flow in floods of billowy hair on high. vi. Koli on ! yet not almighty : in thy wrath Thou bendest like a vassal to his king : Thou darest not o'eratep thy graven path. Nor yet one wanton smile of brightness fling, VII. Slave of a mighty master ? be thy brow A parable of night, in radiance pour'd ; Amid thy haughtiest courses what art thou ? A lamp, to lead some pathway of the Lord ! R. S.
