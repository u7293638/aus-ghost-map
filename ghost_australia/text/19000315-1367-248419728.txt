& t fMmk's THE SHAMROCK, AND THE QUEEN'S ORDKR. THE Shamrock! happy emblem of the Trinityâ€” Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one Divi- . nity. St. Patrick turned the heathen by its simple aid; The blessing of the trefoil then and there was laid. And now our Queen has ordered all her Irish ranks To don to-day the Shamrock, expressive of her thanks ; That her Irish soldiers for Queen and Empire fight 'Gainst stubborn Boers heroically, in the world's full sight. They're shedding their blood like water, storming cv'iy hill, And anywhere and everywhere ate fighting with a will, Led by Irish generals, whose glory and renown Is that they are leaders upholding England's Crown. Then glory to the Shamrock, and glory to the men Whose deeds of daring valour win praise from ev'ry pen. And glory to St. Patrick for this glorious day ; And glory to old Ireland that bred such sons, I say. Tangmangaroo. WILFD. A. WALSH,
