Three Figures: in Shrouds. Probably few persons would be suffi ciently strong-minded to pass a solitary night in a room said to bo haunted with out experiencing some disagreeable nerve shocks. Lady Burton tells a story of a friend of hers (Winwood Reade, the author), who put tins tact, to the test. Read was a man of strong nerve and undoubted courage. 'While travelling, either in Africa or India, Jleade wns told that a certain bungalow was uninhabit able,' as it was haunted by the ghosts of three surgeons who had died there of cholera, and who, each midnight, entered one of the rooms (wliich had glass doors opening out into the compound), arrayed in their winding sheets. Wishing to test the truth of the story, the author took up his abode in1': the .'haunted room one night, armed with a gun and plenty of lights and books. His native servant absolutely refused to enter the bungalow with him, but consented to remain out side on the roof, also armed with a gun. Reade occupied himself with -his books, and all was quiet until the stroke of twelve, when, ' with a loud noise, the glass flew open, and' three figures, in white shrouds, stepped into the -roOm.' On Lady Burton's inquiring if. -the spec tator had tested if. the apparitions wore' practical jokers or supernatural visitors, Read candidly replied, '.''To tell you the truth, I fainted dead off, and dropped tnyrgun j ' and, as ssoon as- I came to myself, I called the boy down from the roof, and made off as fast as I could.'
