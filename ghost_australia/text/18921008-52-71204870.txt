Mind Pictures. The uses to which the power of mental pictur- ing is put are (says Professor Hirschfelder) most interesting, lt is, as a rule, well developed in painters, some of whom are able to paint a portrait after seeing the subject but once. Dor√© for one possessed this faculty. His memory of anything he had once seen was marvellous, and he seemed to work at night as if the scenes he had made note of during the day were still before his eyes. After once driving through Windsor Park, he knew by heart every tree he bad glanced at, and said that he could draw all from memory. Chess players of note have the faculty of visualising the board in their minds, and are thus enabled to play many games simultaneously blindfolded. One of the great chess players could play 12 games at once, without seeing a board. He expressly stated that he had before him a per- fectly vivid picture of each board, which altered instantaneously as each move was made, and this remained printed on his mind till another again changed the situation. Some persons see men- tally in print every word that they hear or whicn they speak. One statesman assured Galton that a certain hesitation in utterance which he has at times is due to his being plagued by the image of his manuscript speech with its om inal erasures and corrections. He cannot lay the ghost, and he puzzles in trying to decipher it.
