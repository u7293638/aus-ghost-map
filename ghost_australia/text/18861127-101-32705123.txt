A Funny Ghost Story. An amusing ghost story is told of a crip- pled tailor in Scotland. In the Highlands, as elsewhere, stealing is a trade to which young people are often apprenticed. Donald Macwhirter, who was an old thief, took as his apprentice a young lad named Duncan Macgraggan. Donald wished to try the met- tle of his apprentice at the very beginning of their connection. So Duncan was told off for stealing a sheep, while Donald himself stole vegetables from a kitchen gardenâ€”a much more dangerous job. Their place of rendezvous was to be the churchyard, as they were least likely to be disturbed there. As was to be expected, the experienced Donald was first at the place, and, while waiting, he amused himself by thinking over the treat in store for him. That even- ing several neighbours met, as usual, in a tailor's shop, and oddly enough, the conver- sation turned on ghosts, and especially on the one which was said to haunt the neigh- bouring churchyard. One little crippled tailor said, " I don't believe in any ghosts, and if I had the use of my legs I'd go this very night, and stay there, to show you that there are none." " Well," said Angus Mur- ray, " if you'll go there, I'll carry you on my back." The poor tailor could not escape from the dilemma with good grace, and so consented to go. As Angus, with the tailor on his back, was entering the churchyard- gate, Donald, who was sitting on a stone, mistook them for Duncan with the sheep on his back, and, in a low, hoarse voice, said, "Is he fat?" " Whether he be fat or no," said Angus, "there he is for you;" and so saying, he threw down the tailor, to whom fear supplied legs; at least, he was back at the shop as soon as Angus, who had run all the way.
