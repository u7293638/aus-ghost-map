THE WINTER EXHIBITION AT B URLINOTON-HO OSE. (FlIOlI A LONDON CORRESPONDENT.) No. 77. Before I pass on to the foreign pictures in the twenty) fifth exhibit on of old masters at the Royal Academy, I have to mention the solitary example of the work of a painter born in England during the 17th century This is Hogarth's "Wedding of Mr Beckingham and Miss Corbett ' (in hill-)) and it is rendered interesting, in addition to the fact that it is the only Hogarth, by the particulars which Mr Stephens gives us in the Athercrum respect- ing it. The small picture, which produces a strange mingled impression of doll like stiffness and also reality, has not, we learn, " been seen till now in a public gallery, or engraved or even mentioned in any of the catalogues of Hogarth s works A few such pictures have turned up from time to time They belong to that period soon after his marriage in 17-1, when, as he said him self, he commenced as a painter of small conversation pieces, from 12 to 15 inches high, which, having novels), succeeded for a few years. His the quaintest picture ; the dull brown interior of the cold rapt) looking (and feeling) brown church, the ' pen as Mr Stephens very aptly calls it, in which the officiating parson, the type of an eighteenth century vicar, stands, the prim group of kinsfolk and friends all the ladies in powder and top knot plumes and all the gentlemen in the long coats and powdered wigs of the period, and the true touch of grace and interest which sets apart the figures of the bride and bridegroom (neither is remarkable for personal attractions) all these features give the quiet little picture a charm like that of a portrait of someone well known, thoughneveraeen Mr Stephens believes that Hogarth never saw Bishopsbourne Church the scene of the wedding and adds-" Where the picture came from and how it escaped notice till now are matters we should like to hear accounted for The charm of its colour is delightfully idea that 111 the pearly hues of the dresses of the bride and her groom, and in the sound and bright fresh painting The general design 11 mixture of humour and quaintness in crop nently Ilogartluaii and so on the troup cf chubby Cupids floating in the air above the happy pair, and emptying over them the substantial contents of 11 hues cornucopia, and the prim proprieties of some of the lookers on In the Hurd Carter) are two large pictures by Bernardo Bellotto which are of singular interest being two news of Dresden, with the tannins bridge over the Kill, one view looking down, the other up the river in the first the old bridge is in the right fore ground, in the second it occupies the centre, so that the two form a complete, picture of old Dresden and allow us to see the harmonious di sign of the beautiful bridge, the gr and buildings (some in course of construction tile busy bee of the city, and the cos turns be strange to our unpicturesque time in the first view the Royal (or electoral) Palace IS conspicuous, and a coach elegantly) shaped, but on a kind of platform drawn by six horses, preceded by outriders and followed by mounted grooms, is proceeding towards the bridge The occupants (who are saluted by the spectators) described in the catalogue as "two persons of rank, are, of course, royal I do not know the date of the picture, but conclude that it was painted during the electorate in that case the princely personages are the 1 lector and Electress of Saxony An markable feature 111 the picture are the " running foot men who sped along the road in aid of the lumbering coach with tin Ihetiuss of the Chinese cb labourers of to day These pictures are very fine works of art, the Hki a and the atmospheric effect bring especially noticeable There is but one Raphael in the Academy Exhibition and I have heard its authenticity questioned a point on which I have no right to an opinion but if it be a genuine work of the glowing and genial mast r it is not a pleasing example, for the anonymous Senator is a commonplace person, half h rib, lull me, in black and white robes and a Hat black cap, whom only body might have painted Among, the Queen H contributions is a solitary example of a master none of whose works I know it is " 1 Federigo and Guido Baldi, the first Dukes of carbine' referred to in one of my letters on the exhibition of early Italian art at the New Gallery), b) McKone do both One of the critic has described this as " the ghost of a picture but I think that gives too much prominence to the injury which time lins conflict d on a most interesting work for after all, the lifelike portraiture, the purposeful expression of the figures, the mi lining and character of the scene are preserved, the fading the efface I mint rather in some parts is of colour only With a deeper interest than that aw likened by the beauty of the painters art we contemplate the chief figure in this curiously composed work for each of those figures resuscitate for us in his habit as he lived, two of the great personages of

made a Knight of the Carter b) L Edward IV , the second is that of his BOH, Onido Baldo (as a youth) who succeeded his father and even excelled him at a learned and munificent patron of letters and

before alluding to the rich muster of the Low Countries The Uotticelhs- Scenes from the sale of an Zenobie lent by Mr Mond are panel pictures exquisitely beautiful their di licite und vivid colour is all glowing with smooth freshness I believe these works date from 1110 The consecration of San Zenobia as Bishop of Florence and the baptism of his father and mother are the chief subjects of one picture The grouping of the numerous figures the grace of the draperies the colours-chiefly sky blue, and that rare bird called by ns ver nation but which no modern colours can reproduce and the translucent white that must surely be the white of the robes of the saints of the Apocalyptic vision which were sent with a message of peace -aresobeautilul that were most pardon the rhapsodies of the professional panel rests of this great painter At any rate we feel that we could pardon their enthusiasm were it not for their insufferable affectation The second picture quite equal to the first in execution, is not quite so delightful although it is more curious and of the same vivid and seemingly immortal lustre of colour, because there is a touch of the ludicrous in the realism of that portion of the work which represents the saint casting out devils realism that was perfectly in place in the painters time three miracles of Sin Zenobie form the subject of the picture Those of raising a sick child and healing a blind man are exquisitely treated the c sting out of devils with little black imp issuing from the mouths of the possessed years upon one s incurably modern sense The loveliest sacred picture in the exhibition is the third Botticelli, a Virgin and Child with St John The inexhaustible subject has not I fancy, been more beautifully treated than in this immortal picture where we see the mother maiden in her flower like pensive beauty with rippling corn-coloured hair and lowered, darker eyelashes seated on an Italian balcony her figure is thrown out against a straight Screen of gold brocade and her drapery is rich and simple, the lines of absolute harmony on her lap is the gleeful almost dancing beautiful child, leaning to wards the little St John-as lovely as a Murillo, but more refined-who kneels on one 1 nee with clasped hands, and an amazing look of adoration without fear or distance in his face A very fine Mantegna the only example of this master, treats the same subject in a curious way, with the artist's richness of detail In this picture the \ Virgin stands in a majestic attitude behind a marble balustrade she wears a white head dress fastened in front with a lustrous jewel and she holds the Divine Child who is seated on a book lying, on the balustrade, the Childs face is raised to her there is a rocky landscape in the background A. peculiar feature of this picture is a festoons of leaves and fruit which hangs above the Virgin s head, and has ft sculpture que effect that is very Btnkm" 1 he front of the bales trade

Venice a second in the A Virgin and Child so highly prized by the great connoisseur and expert Dr Richter who is its enviable owner the third is a superb St Jerome seated in a cave reading a book which lies open on a stone beside him.
