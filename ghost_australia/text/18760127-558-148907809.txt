THE' CHILWELL GHOST. TO T1IE EDITOR Sir, — The ■ inhabitants of the " model borough" are just now suffering from an unquiet spirit. It is reported that the ghost leaves the peaceful shades of the Eastern Cemetery at a certain hour nightly, marches into Chilwell, prowls around until just before cook-crow, and then mysteri ously disappears. If so, the trustees of the cemetery should look into the matter. They have an able- bodied curator, whose duty it is to preserve order there; and it is Iris duty to see that none of his charges are absent without leave ! ! Let him see to it. It is further asserted that the visitor is the ghost of an elector who committed the crime of " plumping" for Peters at the last election, and who—having died before he had time to expatiate the offence—is now undergoing a punishment similar to that inflicted 011 Hamlet's father. I would, however, sug gest a method of "laying" the ghost. Let the inhabitants of Chilwell send for Mr Burnett—he is a decided enemy to spirits of any kind—and request him to re-organise his singing hand, and perambulate the streets. If that does not lay his ghostship. I'll " eat" -I am, &c.; The Witch or Endoci.
