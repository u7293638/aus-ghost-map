Confirmation at St. Luke's. ? a* Oa Tuesday evening last Dr H. H. Montgomery, Bishop of Tasmania, paid a flying visit to Zeehan for the purpose of administering the Holy Rite of Con firmation. Despite the somewhat abort notice as to the time sf holding the service— owing to the delay through roogh weather of the steamer — the chirch was well filled when a few minutes after 8 o'clock His Lordship entered the chorcb, accompanied by Rev F. G. Copeland acting-chaplain, and Mr J. C. Collings as server, the choir and congre gation singing that well-known hymn, 'Soldiers of Christ, Arise.' In a few well chosen words His Lordship pointed out to the candidates that it was no mere formal ceremony that they were about to take pat t in, but one of great solemnity, in which thev would, as it were, take upon themselves those tows -that bad been taken on their behalf by their god parents at Holy Baptism, when they were received into Christ's church here upon earth, after which tbe candidate— seven male and fire female — were pre sented by the Rev F. Q. Copeland. Before the Benediction was given tbe hymn, 'O, Jesus, I have promised,' wag sung, followed by the ' Litany of the Holy Ghost.' His Lordship, after bidding good-bye to the candidates, left the church daring the singing of the ' JTunc Dimitis,' which brought to a close one of the 'most impressive services of the Anglican Church.
