UNUSUAL CAUSES OF DEATH. " I have interested myself somewhat in looking up unusual causes of death." said a well-known physician, " and have met several well-authenticated instances where fright was the cause. The English Surgeon- General Francis tells of a drummer in India across whose legs a harm ess lizard crawled while he was half asleep. He was sure that a cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves, and he died. Frederickl., ot Prussia, was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she escaped frcim her keeper, and, dabbling her clothes in blood, rushed upon her husband while lie was dozing in his chair. King Frederich imagined her to be the white lady whose ghost was believed to invariably appear whenever the death of a member of the Royal family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever, and died in six weeks. But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth century. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some deaths' heads and skeletons for a picture he intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell asleep. He was aroused by bonuts dancing around him and the skeletons suspended from the ceiling ciash ing together. In a fit of terror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused the commotion among his ghostly surroundings, he died in a few days in a nervous tremor. I could cite many other cases where the shock to the nervous system which we know as fright has produced death.
