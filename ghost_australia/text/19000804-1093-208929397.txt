SUNDAY READING. MAKE SPKED TO idKLF (By J. G. Whittier.) When joys are joys that words transcend; When griefs have shut the heart; When we, who at the altar bend, Can only pray in part; When angels, both of joy and grief, Strike priests at prater-time dumb "Pis then, with Thy Divine relief, Thou Comforter dost come. When we with words of Scripture pray, And do not, cannot know The meaning full of. what we say In praying Scripture so By Tliee, in meaning full, "before The Throne, the prayer is brought, Whence we receive exceeding more Than we have asked or thought. When joys are joys unspeakable, That rise all thoughts above, And earnest souls with rapture till In the silent heavens of love As babe soft mother's arms upraise, Thou Dove on Thy white wings Dost bear lis up, on God to gaze! Far down the angel sings. And when our griefs deep buried lie Beneath all utterance dumb, Into that silent agony Thou with Thy help dost come. Then, with the unutterable groans, Is intercession given, That makes, above all trumpet tones, Our silence heard in heaven. Oh, Holy Ghost the Comforter, All speed to help us make; Our hearts with griefs they cannot bear. With very joys they break; Blind yearnings after God, dumb cries That ne'er their aim could reach, Didst Thou not give their blindness eyes, And make their silence speech.
