A Theological Fallacy Revived. The rhetorical agnostic who lately asked what the Church had ever done for the world, and then, as an answer, enumerateid some of the horrible crimes and pernicious errors of historical personages, revived a senseless objection, once common enough, but now relegated to the limbo of theologic ghosts. It has taken the Protestant world almost four hundred years to understand that the failings of fallible men in no way involve the infallible Church of Christ. The answer to all Mr. Ingersoll's rhodo montade is the simple statement that the Church inculcates neither cruelty, ignorance, nor immorality ; and the famous personages whose conduct shocks the vir tuous advocate of free love and suicide acted not in obedience, but in disobedience, to Catholic teaching. The moral of Mr. Ingersoll's historical citations seems to be that just as soon as everybody obeys the Church there will be no more bad people. In that case the Cole nel will be obliged to become a good Christian or to follow his own counsel and commit suicide.
