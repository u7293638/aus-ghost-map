SIGHTLESS FISH: A correspondent wrote a abort time back asking if there were such things as sightless fish. In Knowledge for September there is a paper describing several kinds of fish, all inhabiting caves or sub terranean waters, which have no : eyes. * By far the most celebrated among these is the well known blind-fish (Amblyopsis spelaea), which has been taken in both the Mammoth (Kentucky) and the Wyandotte (Indiana) caves, as well as the intervening subter ranean waters. This fish is the typical representative of a small family allied to the cypjrihodonts, which are themselves relatives of the carps. It is quite destitute of external eyes, and its body is com pletely colourless; but its sense of hearing is extraordinarily deve loped. In the typical form this fish has a small pair of pelvic fins, but in some examples (which have been referred to as a distinct genus under the name of Typhiicbthys) these are wanting. The maximum length is 5in. Professor Cope writes that if these fish * be not alarmed they come to the surface to feed and swim in full sight like white acquatic ghosts. They are then easily taken by the band or net, if perfect silence is observed for they are unconscious of the pre sence of an enemy except through the medium : of hearing. This sense is, however, evidently very acute, foÂ£ at any noise they turn suddenly .downward, and hide beneath stones, &c.;, at the bottom. They must take much of their food near the surface, .as the life of the depths is apparently very sparse."'
