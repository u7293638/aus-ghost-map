' l?jl 1.7,-7: — V THE PHANTOM BOOMERANG. If you travel, my children, some eighty-four miles In a steamer or ship when the deep ocean smiles — If you travel down south, at that distance you'll see A town on the side which the sailors call " lee," (That is, when the wind doesn't come from the shore, But blows from the place where the big billows roar) ; ! This town that we speak of is close to the sand ; | And if you should happen before it to land You will find it is known as Kiama, a name Which first from the language of blackfellows came. By the side of its harbor there is a steep hill With snakes in its bushes for schoolboys to kill ; And the end of this hill is away by the seas, Which about there are swarming with big stingarecs , And flatheads, and sharks ; and, then, under the slabs Of the rocks, you may count upon whoppers of crabs ; And there's jolly good bait at the foot of the cliff Where the conjevey sticks in a way pretty stiff ; And still further on, like a Blunderbore's grave, There goes under land, for a long way, a cave. Away from this cave, which is awfully dark, The stingaree swims, and the starfish, and shark ; But up it there rushes the stupid old Sea, A nd comes back as frightened as frightened can be, With its head torn to pieces, its body all white ; And it hides itself down in the sand out of sight : For the end of this Cavern that darkens the coast Is haunted, they say, by a Blackfellow's Ghost Who was killed in the time of the warring and woe By his brother, two thousand moon-ages ago. And his brother, more dreadful, more wicked than Cain, i Made a fire on the ridge, and then roasted the slain ; But God saw it all ; and His thunder with shocks Clove a hole through the cliff — made a cave in the rocks ; Then, swiftly, His ocean came up by His will And dashed through the hollow and broke up the hill, And gripped in its clutches the slayer and slain, Then sprang like a lion back homewards again, But left there behind it a yawning abyss Which has stayed in the hill from that moment to this. And this fearful abyss and this horrible cave, (Through which there are heard, with the shriek of the wave, The moan of a Ghost, and the cry of a Tiling Which they say is the Fiend with his hoof and his wing,) Are called the " Big Blowhole " by those who don't know What happened two thousand moon-ages ago ; For nothing remains that can point to the tale, Save the rainbow that spans in the time of the gale That thundering gulf where the terrors all hang — The Ghost of the murdered maris last Boomerang !
