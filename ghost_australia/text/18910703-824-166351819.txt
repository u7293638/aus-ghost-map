HUNTING HALLOOS. A southerly wind and a cloudy sky was the order on Saturday, with rather more cloud than wind until after the run was over. They then began to blow considerably. It was a pretty run to see, and all appeared to enjoy it, from Mr. Hugh Chambers with a dashing pair down to Mr. R. Beck with a rat and trap. Falls were more numerous than the occasion warranted, Frearson receiv ing rather a severe shaking off Black Diamond. Mr. A; J. Barker had again to take commandv on Cardinal. Mr. A. Ross stood on his . head; he knows the Secret. Mr. F. Cornelius was clouted off Rollo (Quiz saw him roll over). Mr. D. Connor and Dragon got mixed with wire, Mr. A. Thompson parted company with his old racer; Harry Esmond and Mr. A. E. Braund are rather green — they want more schooling. Palmerston distinguished himself with Mr. D. Beck; Mr. A. Hill nearly extinguished himself with Tornado. Barbed wire separated Opal and Mr. W. Fergusson. Mr. P. McM. Glynn was on Whalebone, Sportsman's ghost. By-the-bye, where is Sportsman, Duffy? Kaulbars keeps Mr. P. Hill well_ up to the front. Mr. F. Braund and old Victor plod along. Mr. C. H. Williams has a wonderful horse in Lep ; he ought to be embalmed. Mr. J. Love on Cleveland, Mr. H, Laughton on Chris, and Mr. C. L. Moorhouse on Lottery appeared to get along alright. Kingfish went fairly well with Mr. F. BL Downer. Professionals included Donaghy on Parnell, Spinkston ©n Sailorboy, Spinkston (2) on Scamp, Mullins on Rabble, Fenton on Buck, and Ledger on Excelsior. Collins rode Kildare and the boy Clansman. t It is rather peculiar that whilst the mighty JSimrod thought a brother rider came to grief, he did not apparently have time to notice his own fall, which was real.
