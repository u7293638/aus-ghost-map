FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1891. Ministers deal with the assumed deficit in a theatrical manner for land tax purposes. Their method of flaunting their somewhat wild guess before the public is unfair and improper. ' They use the possible debit at the year's end for the purpose of of making the public believe that their taxation scheme must be carried whether it is right or wrong in order that the colony may pay its way. Mr. CUTHBERT, who evidently knows nothing of the financial part of his subject, spoke on Wednesday from his brief, and under instructions he went as near as Mr. TURNER had gone on a previous occasion in suggesting that if the Taxation Bill is not passed there may be default in connection with the July interest due to the British bondholder " We have exhausted the trust " funds," said Mr. CUTHBERT ; " the " revenue is insufficient ; we have to " remit £900,000 to London by the 1st of July." These are simple but startling sentences. They are well calculated to have a great effect upon people who are not in a position to look into the figures, and who recognise that not a breath of suspicion should rest upon the punctuality of our payments. These good people can scarcely understand thatMinistorsshould play with the credit of the colony for party purposes. But so it is. The sensational statements in question belong to that dangerous class of falsehoods called half-truths, and so the public has been told by responsible experts in the Assembly, and so the experts in the Council will have to make clear in their turn a little later on. Why mention the £900,000 at all, except for theatrical and mislead- ing purposes The guess deficit is only ¿£500,000, and if it were not provided for it is not the British bondholder but somebody else -some local obligations- that would have to bide a wee. But the great point which the public mind has to seize is this-that whatever the amount to be remitted to London may be, it cannot possibly be provided for by money received from the now taxes. The bulk of the sum expected from the new taxes is to come from the land impost, and it is not feasible that a highly complicated and an entirely novel system of valuation should be brought into existence, that assessments should be made, and that appeals should be disposed of by March or April, as Ihn Treasurer requires for the purpose of his London remittances. So much Mr. TURNER stated when he made his Budget speech. He said that no matter how quickly the taxing bills might be passed he would not be able to get in money under them for his ordinary Treasury purposes, and consequently, he said, he proposed to issue Treasury bills in anticipation of receipts - these Treasury bills to be sold to the public, the proceeds to go into the revenue, and the bills to be met as the now revenue came in. In other words, Mr: TURNER said that there would have to be a small short-dated local loan pending the adjustment of accounts. This was the official, unsolicited intimation of the Treasurer to the House. Treasury bills, the House was told, must of necessity be sold early in the new year, those bills to be met by such new Treasury receipts as should be arranged for. The Government having, therefore, to proceed by way of Treasury bills for which there is an eager demand the Houses are perfectly free to decide upon what method shall be adopted for retiring those bills. Thus the question at issue is entirely different from the question which Mr. TURNER, Mr. CUTHBERT, and other Ministers continually put before the country in order to silence criticism on their inept schemes. It is not "how shall we pay the British bondholder V J it is " what arrangements shall we " make to retire the local Treasury | " bills which we are about to issue V The importance of this variation is | evident. If there was trouble about the British bondholder, why, we should have to take any stop rather than risk default. But the British bondholder is only dragged in by Messrs. TURNER and CUTHBERT and other Ministers as a bogey. It is highly improper to drag him in. It is playing with edged tools to suggest the idea of default, and on I patriotic grounds alone all this (danger- as special pleading by Ministers should be at once abandoned. We have told our London friends before that the Turner talk is; merely partisan, and is not entitled to a moment's serious consideration, and we tell the Victorian public the same thing. No doubt there is need for wise and determined action by the Legislature, prompted by a resolution to stop a deplorable and dangerous drift into debt. But the Legislature is not driven into a corner. It is not compelled to grasp any ox point no matter how the remedy would militatoasagainstthorovival of prosperity in this colony. The situation, as a mater of fact, is incomparably better than it was in 1892, when there was a difference of £1,800,000 between revenue and expenditure, when the trust funds were exhausted, and when the same Loudon remittance had to be made, and when much heavier local claims had to be met. To-day the public account as a whole is heavily in credit, is in credit to a far larger amount than any contingent liabilities that the Treasurer can be called upon to face; if the Treasurer were driven to it there are trust funds on deposit at the banks which he could utilise, and the community is only anxious for the chance of snapping up Treasury bills at a high figure. We recommend no emergency use of the money at the credit of the public account ; we have opposed the indiscriminate use of the trust funds ; but we mention these points to show how gratuitous is the talk about a possible default-talk which is afterwards duly copied from The Argus into London papers and duly frightens weak holders of Victorian bonds. The situation is, as Mr. TURNER put it in his Budget speech, that Treasury bills have to be issued, and the question is how those local and short-dated bills shall be met. Mr. TURNER and his friends say that a tax levied to depreciate land values and to embarrass the struggling and logged institutions is the best possible way of meeting those bills. We say that it is the worst possible way that any of the other expedients that have been suggested are better than this, one, that the tax is a cruel tax and an impolitic tax, and is to the most likely of all to tell against that revival of prosperity which when it occurs will at once pull the Treasurer through all his troubles. At any rate let us have no more of this nonsensical and theatrical talk of a possible default in the payment of in- terest-talk which deceives no well informed person here, but which may be turned to profitable account by " bears " in London. Talk about the municipal endowment occupied the Legislative Assembly Hourly the whole of yesterday. A common sense course was taken by overwhelming majorities, that of reducing the endow- ment, which once stood as high as £'450,000-from £310 000 to £200,000, ] but leaving the division of the money as the scheme stands to-day. It was easy to cut the vote down, but to frame a new scheme of distribution which would satisfy all interests would have been well nigh impossible It would not be fair to abolish this grant at once. What is rather needed is that a committee of the Cabinet should go over the list, should note what amounts the various shires and boroughs have received, should drop out those that have received enormous sums, and should leave on the list the new districts which have received but little and in which the work of development has yet largely to be done. Shires that have received Ray £10 per bond from the state have received enough, but a shape that has only received 10s. per cent should not be abruptly cut off. Air. TUCKER and othortown members took the opportunity of snyingsmartthiiigs about the reluctance of some country members to part with the subsidy though they oppose the land tax. Of course these country members oppose the aboli- tion of the grant. The fact we have mentioned of some shires having only received 10s. where others have had £10 shows how inequitable a sudden stoppage would be. But the tone of the debate made it evident that a bona-fide offer of the Government to stop the land tax contingent on the subsidy being reduced to £100,000 per annum for the power and poorer shires would meet with an overwhelming support. The case was put unfairly from another standpoint. There was it constant assumption that the money is taken from the ordinary taxation, and that consequently Melbourne has contributed enormously to the fund and has received very little in return. But the fact is that the subsidy was started as a payment out of the land fund. The gross receipts from sales by auction and from selectors' rents and from grazing licenses were subject to this deduction. And as the heaviest fund receipts come from the now districts it is but just to continue the payment there. If the Government will drop the tax on land values there is, however, an economy of £100,000 possible in this direction, and so the required total to do away with the obnoxious impost could soon be made up. The result of the Chrozior infanticide trial shows that the machinery of the law, cumbersome always, proves sometimes absolutely unworkable. It has been inadequate in the present instance to the punishment of anyone concerned in a piece of business so ghastly and atrocious that the details are unpleasant even to refer to. The dead body of the infant was found terribly mutilated ; there can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable person as to the maternity of the child or the circumstances of its birth.; and what purported to be a detailed confession as to the murder and its instigators was extracted from one of the prisoners young gin,. ' With all these materials the law has been power- less to do more than pronounce that one and all of the four members of the family charged are not guilty. No one in fact is guilty in the eye of the law, although a deed of peculiar monstrosity has been committed and the facts laid bare to the public. No doubt the law was laid down by the Chief Justice is good law, but the position is none the " loss anomalous. Some of the witnesses were too young to testify on oath, or unwilling to testify truthfully when the time came. The damning confession of the youngest prisoner could not be used against any of the accused not present when it was made, and the older prisoners having been discharged, the jury felt naturally reluctant to convict upon her own admissions the 19-year-old girl who was left alone in the dock. Especially seeing that if her statements were true she acted under the tutelage of others older and therefore more criminal than herself. If it had been practicable to call the girl as Queen's evidence, her testimony, although she confessed herself the actual perpetrator of the crime, would have been admissible against the others. But this the Crown for obvious reasons did not do. No doubt the procedure was carefully considered, but it has led, never wholesale, to a complete blocking of the wheels of justice. It is not particularly consolatory to reflect that while under the French criminal law such a result would be virtually impossible, under the British it is not even uncommon. It has been said that the battles of England have been won on the cricket held, and certainly we can realise the force of the remark. The iiilevimtioiml milich just called sided in Sydney, which after the second day appeared to be a gift to Australia, was pulled out of the time by as magnificent a display of courage and skill in a game as the race need wish to see. We do not say that with equal luck Australia would not have won handsomely, for it. is clear that but for the rain at the last the issue would have been in our favour. But looking at the whole position the splen 1 club recovery made by the visiting champions in the second innings is the most striking feature honours lie mainly with the professional members of the tent, which is often the case in such circumstances, and is to be explained, no doubt, by the fact that cruel ot is their motion Generally speaking, the professional mind is best man omoiKonoy, and though in cricket the difference between tim it toms and professionals is usually slight when there is a stiff uphill game to be played, the latter in nimbly ato most trustworthy Mr SioDDAitr, having won when the match tions were all against him, may well take be fit for the coming Test matches For the Australians there is nothing but praise, and once again the prowess of (mUN comes prominently into view The world to day his no compeer for that extraordinary player In every department of the Prime he is great, and his batting in the first innings was invaluable When the first two wickets had

Year's Day Given equal conditions, which I really means good weather throughout, the Australians should win, because Australian players are more at home on Victorian wickets than are the English To what extent the constitu- tion of the home team should be altered will be matter for keen discussion If BROU and TRUMBTT are able to play there will be a general feeling the room should be found for them It will also be sincerely hoped that BLACMIVM. will have sufficiently recovered from the injury received in Sydney to enable him to again lead the Australians ï/ie^lrfli« will be published on

minutes whether it would sit at nil For some five minutes after the President had taken the chair there was a thin House, and no attendance of Ministers, and Mr Jti-itl was in the act of moving an adjournment then and there over the New Year when Mr Cuthbert entered An effort was made by the Government to get the Stiinilnril of 'lune Hill passed through all its stages but this was blocked by an objection from Mr Melville, and the Council spent an hour or so instead in introducing one or two minor amendments into the -emit Profession Practice Bill which was recommitted for the purpose the only alteration of any moment brought forward was an alarming suggestion by Mr M eh able to admit lady students to the profession, but hon. members were too shy of this subject even to discuss it Shortly before 6 o'clock The Council rose, and will not meet again until January 3 the Legislative Assembly, on the conclusion of the sitting yesterday adjourned until January 8, and if history is a guide the Ministry is doomed Almost every Government that has failed to close the session before Christmas has succumbed soon after words 'The business yesterday) was interesting Mr 'Turner moved the second reading of the Municipal Subsidy Reduction Bill and members discussed the motion until after -4 o clock Among other amendments proposed in committee was one by Mr Fink to taper off the subsidy

lose, the bill providing for the stoppage of the endow- ment to cities, towns, boroughs, and first class sin ross Mr Wheeler next essayed to keep boroughs on the list, and he also was beaten by a combination mainly of Ministers, city and town representatives, and shire men But Mr Outtrim joined nil farces "oil), town, borough, and first-class shire, in a proposal to omit the clause, excepting those municipalities from the benefit of the act He defeated the Ministry by an overwhelming majority to 2b-but us Minister had previously secured the reduction of the vote from _¡)10,000 to £200,000, they did not care who got the balance The only other business was the passing through all its stages of a bill to authorise the construction of the Jumbunna to Outtrim line, a distance of two miles and a half The House rose at 11 o'clock, after the Premier find wished the Speaker the compliments of the season Mr J Turner did not occupy much time in moving the second reading of the Municipal Subsidy) Reduction Bill, by which the muni- cipal endowment is reduced from £J10,000 to 2.00,000 He said he did it with extreme regret, but the necessities of the colony compelled the retrenchment the reduction would be graded so as to fall lightly on the poorer municipalities the subsidy would be wholly) withdrawn from cities, towns, boroughs, and first class shires, which at present received 132,050 amongst them The second class shires would lose £15 059 by the reduction , the third class £39,330, the fourth class, £1,190, the fifth class, 1943 whilst the sixth class shires would receive £1,072 more than at present Mr by men admitted that there might be individual cases of hardship, but these could only be met by a reclassified tion of the shires, and that would be taken into consideration during the recess A lengthy discussion ensued, in which every member admitted the necessity of a reduction but most were prepared to show cause why it should not affect the municipalities in their electorate. The Speaker raised a mild protest against the discussion of detail on the second reading, but members quietly ignored him as usual and the Hood of particular in stances poured on A number of members protested against the total withdrawal of the grant from the cities, towns, boroughs, and first-class shires, and claimed a j o rate reduction the Premier offered to drive the method of distribution an open one for the committee if the second reading were passed, but members were talking to their const tuencies and they took nearly three hours to unbosom themselves the second reading was then agreed to Members of the I above party do not con suit each other as to their schemes of reform, possibly fearing that their ideas might be 'jumped The consequence is that they are usually advanced in haste and with drawn in confusion Mr Pendergast interposed on the first reading of the Jumbunna to Outtrim Hallway Hill yesterday with a stiL,L,cstiou that it clause should be inserted to compel the owners of the coil tunics to which the line is to run to refer disputes with employers to arbitration Mr Maloney chit red the suggestion confer OUKI) but Mr Trenwith road, and whilst in ferring with the greatest possible deference to the principle is a principle, he pointed out, with great respect to the hon. member for North Melbourne, that conditions with regard to 11 our pulling could not be inserted in a railway construction bill Mr PrentUr just looked crestfallen, but Mr Malone) ex idea he) could not understand the point raised though the speaker had previously declared discussion at that stage irritable, in Spring to his feet t I really must stop this discussion said the Speaker Mr Maloney set down shouting, Some men can do it and some men can I do it on ina) as will turn are out of the House and he hurled him notice paper for our him in a lillimur IIH petulant as it was disrespectful The Ililli Heene turned to distinct acts mine from the id) not at putting down to which Mr. Irin hi toast had been subjected 9) his is in ii- Mr inn«ith often snubs this particular in miner when the Munich) as 'will they deduction bill got into a minute i Mr Irvine intends Hint it should It dated back to October 1 instead of July 1 Mr I timer came out with nuntin r dear races against members who sought to deprive him of taxation and at the same line and scoured to cheek his retrenchment policy He told the House gravel) that unless his proposals were accepted he would abandon the work of setting the finances strntLjit the curbing of Mr Irvine's amendment would mean that the Treasury would lose £55 000 Mr Irvine asserted that the loss would only be £27,500 The committee decided against him 'then Mr India who has been singularly silent Intel j, showed commonplace cunning by moving that the subsidy should be abolished, on the understanding that the land tax for which ltd hall consistently voted was dropped Members could not quite perceive where the side of this movement came in seeing that the land tax, which Mr Tucker supported, though disagreeing with had passed beyond the control of the House the corporate sense! of the Chamber is against paltry tricks Mr M'Intyre, before accepting Mr 'tucki r B challenge to nutt land taxers to show their sincerity by voting for his proposal, asked the Premier if he would arrange for the endowment question to be held in abounds until the fate of the land tax had been decided Mr 'turner merely smiled 'Hiemembers whom Mr Tucker thought to trap In his silly and transparent action declined to be caught, and his motion was incontinently thrown out They were not going to be such fools as to abolish the subsidy with the risk open of lies mg the land tax imposed The incident served to confirm the statement made last session that the 'tucker party is a party of one Mr Graves is the tender flower of the Assemble His organism is so delicate and so pure that it has to be vigilantly guarded lhntiB why Mr Graves is always mulling personal explanations in his own protection In an oil hand interjection Mr M'Coll jester play suggested that he " ran away from the responsibility of voting on Mr Wheeler's motion against the land tax a few weeks ago Instantly Mr Graves threw himself into a wild tantrum, which convinced members that he was perturbed by an uneasy conscience He began a personal explanation, which was a long "rigmarole" to the effect that he was in the precincts of the House just before the division, but his nose was bleeding, and so he did not come in to vote, as he intended, for the Government. Mr M'Coll very adroitly " withdrew the accusation in terms which left no doubt that he stuck to it all the same, and as he sat down he casually glanced at the press gallery Mr Graves saw this and literally screamed, "You needn't look at The Argus, it will have everything in 'the House roared lo yard to some extent this prophecy we may add that up to the day Mr M l«.en?ie moved his amendment on the li Jillet Mr Graves persistently stated that his constituency was on fire against the land tax, and that he would certainly vote against it His intentions underwent a sudden change on that day, and when he is next in an explaining mood he might enlighten the House as to the reason 'the resignation of Sir Frederick Sargood as Minister of Defence was accepted yesterday by the Governor in Council, and the Premier was appointed to that position in his place.
