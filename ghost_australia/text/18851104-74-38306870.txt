F.E.C. SPRING MEETING. (bo OUR OWN REPORTER) CUP DAY. MELBOURNE, NOV. 3. Each year Cup Day seems to increase in attraction, and to-day was one of the most successful Cup days yet held. Tho weather was perfect, and just as good as last year, and everybody made the day a holiday from the earliest hour of the morning. The course was largely attended before the first race was run, but as Cup time ap proached the concourse was tremendous, and it was estimated that quite 10,000 more persons were present than last year. The grandstands were quite unable to accommodate those who wished to procure seats, and hundreds of ladies had to stand all day in the blazing sun, which was very trying during the afternoon. The scone on the lawn and in front of the grandstand was brilliant even to a greater degree than usual, but it was noticeable that the dresses were of quieter shades this year, cream costumes prevailing. Sir Henry and Lady Loch and suite, the hens. Wnm. lobinson, and Sir Fredk. Brown were present. The scene as the horses drew into line for the start in the Cup race was very impressive, the thousands on thousands of spectators straining in eager expectancy to get a view of the horses coming up the straight, and the five minutes thus occupied was the quietest period of the whole day. Wlhen the horses had passed the judge's poest there was the usual rush of spectators to see them led in, and the course for nearly the whole of the straightrunning was a moving mass of people crowding forward from all directions. The judges caused some confusion, as in the Derby, by hoisting Blink Bonny's number instead of Grace Darling's. There was a good deal of cheering over the victory of the Ballarat horse, and his party won about £60,000. Grace Darling was also well backed on the strength of her gallop on Monday morning. The bookmakerslad a very good time over the Cup, as the hon. J. White's pair, Trenton, Liverpool, Brown and Rose, Acolyte, St. John, and Cerise and Blue were all very largely backed. Mr. W. A. Long, of Sydney, bought Maddelina, the winner of the Kensington Stakes, for 020 guineas, of which all but 300 guineas goes to the club. The railway arrangements to-day were more satisfac tory than on Saturday, when so much growling was indulged in. The course was in good order for going, being firm and hard. The Railway Stakes brought out a field of five, and Isonomy was installed a good favourite at once, and won without any difficulty. IMaddelina was the favourite for the Kensington Stakes, and pulled her admirers through in a very easy manner. The Hurdle Race followed, and the South Australian, Brigand, steered by Corrigan, was made a favourite, but did not succeed in gaining a place, as another South Australian, Ruby, a daughter of Lapidist, won after a fine race from Ravensworth, and Gasalier third. The great event of the year followed, and attracted a field of 35 to the post, the largest on record for the race. They were .a well con ditioned lot, and Nordenfeldt maintained position as first favourite and started at 5 to 1, while Trenton, Despot, and Liverpool were next fancied. The favourites occl pied a good place during the race, but Sheet A: uchor came in the straight, and despite a great effort which was made by Grace Darling, who ran a great mare, won with not a great deal to spare by about half a length, in the fastest time ever made in the southern hemisphere. The winner was not much the worse for the race, and the owner and trainer were warmly con gratulated. To the very last the stable fancied Britisher in preference to Sheet Anchor, but he was never dangerous. The winner was backed by the owner for over £20,000, and Britisher was backed for quite as much, if not more. This is the second Cup winner bred by Mr. John Field, the premier thoroughbred breeder of Australasia, and the success may be put down quite as much to Calstock marves as to St. Ahlbans. Mr. Jno. Lord, another Tasmanian, is the only other breeder who has bred two Melbourne Coup winners. Sheet Anchor was pur chased by Mr. M. Loughlin from Mr. R. G. Talbot sople months ago for .1000. A fewof the Tasmanians who are over here have wou, but they would have been better suited by the success of Blink Bonny, on account of popularity of her owner, who is a thorouKhly good sportsman. Still the triumph of Sheet Anchor was by no means begrudged, and his trainer, who by the way is a Tasmanian also, is to be complimented upon the manner in which he sent the horse to the post. There is a splendid yearling filly by Lapidist outof Queen Mary at Calstock,but the old mare died a couple of weeks ago. Trenton ran a good horse, although he pulled up lame in the morning, and Grace Darling, whose toilet was supervised by Paddy Gill, the winner of many races in Tasmania, ran a great mlre ; but Nordenfeldt, who occu pied a good position all through, was not dangerous at the finish. The winner was steered in excellent style by that well conducted jockey, Mick O'Brien. After the excitement over the Cup had abated, the Nursery Stakes followed, attracting but little attention, and the favourite (Yellow Jacket) defeated the field easily. A large field came to the post for the Yan Yean Stakes, and Merrimu, who was well supported, won by a neck after a fine finish, with Chuckster next, and Lavington third. The ring say that Sheet Anchor is not ua good horse for them, as he was constantly supported until about a fortnight ago, when Britisher beat him in a trial.

Remus and Winchester being scratched, left a field of 35 in the great event, which is the largest that has ever started for it. MIr. Watson got them away within five minutes of the hour of starting, und as they came towards the straighet Trenton, Promethous, ?Brown and Rose, St. Johte, and Thlunderbolt hleld the leading positions. After these came First Cheoter, withl Liverpool in his rear, and Yellow ialemoer already apparently out of the race. Nor denfeldt was in the ruck. At the beck of thie course Prometheus, Nordenfeldt, iSheet Anchor, and Grace Darling were occupying prominent positions, with Thunderbolt leading, and Voelecipede and 'Trenton next to him. As they entered tho straight Trenton and Brown and Rose were seen at the head of affairs, closely attended by Sheet Anchor, Britisher,Grace Darling, Minervh, and Nordenfcldt. Thunderbolt had hero fallen behind, and Liverpool camh well forward. There was a desperate race up the straight, but a Ihundred yards from home O'Brien was seen to feel himself pretty comfortable, and lie finally landed Sheet Anchor thle winner, by ahalflength in front of Grace Darling, who lhad run a splendid race and just amssed her mark, Trenton being third, less than half a lcnth behind the Caulfield Cup winner. Nordenfcldt, Minerva, Lesbia, St. Lawrence, and Dunlop followed; then came a cluster of horses with Thenderlholt and Blosworthl whipping in, and Yellow Hammcr righit ouet of it. Neither Liverpool or Delspot had ever Ibecen dangerous, but Norden feldt held an lhonourable place through out, considering his weighlt. Time, 3 mins. 210scc.
