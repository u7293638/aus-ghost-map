The Advertiser MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1880. YESTERDAY the Australian cricketers re- <*> turned to these shores after a most success- <*> ful tour in England, They thoroughly merit the hearty welcome which they will assuredly receive from all classes; (or whether initiated into the mysteries or the game or not there are way few edoniab of either sex who have failed to follow their movements with Interest or note their vic tories with pride. When they left us there was a very general impression that the successes of the pioneer cricketers were not likely to be repeated, but it is gratify ing to record that in spite of accidents which the former team were happily spared they have accomplished as much, and in come respects achieved more, than their predecessors. In the 1678 tour the Australian Eleven played thirty-nine matches, seveuteen against elevens and twenty-two against odds, and of these eighteen were won, seven lost, and fourteen drawn. During the tour now closed the Eleven have played thirty-seven matches, of which twenty-two were won, four lost, and eleveu drawn. On this occasion there have been fewer first class matches against County, University, axd representative elevens, but there has been a great deal of good play and a vast amount of hard work. To play through a " cricketing week" at home is reckoned a fair test of endurance; for the principal professionals and leading amateurs to play for their counties week after week through a season is found by moat of them to come pretty near to making a toil of a pleasure, even though as a rule they may have their deep unbroken and be ready to come up fresh to the scratch every morning. In very many cases, however, our Aus tralians had to travel all night in order to reach the scene of their nest daye engagements, and even in these days of comfortable sleeping cars, a night's ipuniby of 300 or 400 miles is not the test preparation for a hard day's batting, 4JeWine,^aud bowling. This feature of endurance in connection with the late toor IB hardly appreciated as it ought to be by those of us who do not know the distances traversed. Taking the ten days between the end of the great match and the com mencement of that fit Bradford, we find that the team played three matches, and journeyed from London to Glasgow, from Glasgow to Brighton, from Brighton to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Brad ford—a distance in all of about 1,599 miles—so that it is little wonder if in the concluding games our champions felt a little stale and somewhat glad that the end had come. The quality of the play shown has been extremely good, and the notices of the English press have been with rare exceptions kindly, appreciative, and ulti mately even enthusiastic. All have done well, but the members of the team them selves will unite in ascribing much of their success to the wonderful bowling of Bpof- , forth before he was injured and to the rare batting form of Murdoch, which, in the words of an English critic, " it was im possible to surpass." Better even than their play individually and collectively has been the manner in which our representatives have sustained the reputation of Australia for courtesy and good conduct. The possession of the former quality by the Australians was doubted in England in consequence of the Sydney fracas, and sooth to say, courtesy was only very sparingly manifested by Englishmen themselves on the arrival of die strangers. The coolness with which "our boys" were received most have been i excessively galling to generous spirits, but it was met and overcome in the manliest And most effective manner. They went on the even tenor of their way—playing it down, and living it down—and in the end they had their reward, and the hatchet was happily, buried on the Oval. That great match -witt never be forgotten in the cricket ing record* of dther land; all tbe incidents of it are familiar to every Australian schoolboy; and—without speculating as to what the result might { have been if Spofforth had been "in" it—with the magnificent cricket displayed, and with the complimentaiy speeches delivered at its close we may well be content to per" mit tbe initial discourtesies to drop out of mind, and "let tie dead past bury its dead." The English people have been curious to Jtnow the secret of colonial skill, and some wild conjectures have been hazarded there anent. No doubt climate has something to do with it, for in England cricket can only be pursued for about five months in the year, and even then is liable to frequent in- ; terruptions. v Our boye" in both their tours bad considerable experience of changeful skies, eloppy wickets, uncertain foothold ' for bowlers and fielders, and pitches treacherous from alternate sunshine and shower; and undoubtedly opportunities for practice are greater here than in the original home of the game. At the banquet piven to the Eleven si Leeds the Mayor expressed his desire to know from the Eleven whether there was any thing peculiar "in their twining, their habits of eating, drinking, and sleeping- He was anxious to know whether in relation to cricket, champagne or Bass's beer was an advantage or disadvantage." Tbe Aus tralian captain in his reply said they had j no special course of training, but "they kept early hours, bad no heavy dinners, and there was very little champagne drunk. Tbe secret of their success bad been their steadiness ever once they landed in England/" So acting they have done credit to themselves and to the colonies. If there have been any exceptions to this uniform steadiness the matter has not at least been made public, and the general good farm ■ shown by the Eleven under such fatiguing circumstances is the best proof fiat temper ance in all things has been tbe order of the campaign. Considering the solicita tions and temptations to which they have been exposed, this says much both for the youcg Australians who have upheld the reputation of the colonies, and for tbe colonists of whom they are a sample, and the example they have set is one which risingcricketerEwould do well to follow, for it is certain that no youth gives to excess will long retain a promuent -place in tbe ranks of tbe champions of the bat and balL It is a carious coincidence thai on the very day on which we welcome tbe return of onr cricket champions^ oar aquatic hero is to try conclusions on the Thames for the rowing championship of the world. As vet our Adelaide youth bare not the same meens of gratifying Heir taste for aqua tics as the park lands afford far cricket and football, but when the Torrena Dam is completed a great impetus will, no doubt, be given to the fceaUM ul sport, and in time we chall be abte to «f4 o§r KeJleif and. our v fours" and * eight*'' to compete witk Victoria and New South Wales on the Yam and Paramatta, As ft is, however, the interest taken in the 6port is ereat, and the success of the Sydney man will be a« warmly welcomed in South Australia as in tiie other colonies should he manage to poll through to- day. His pluck in going to seek Hanlan when Banian would not or could not Come to him dttaprros niffM^ ftn j fating a line from Lsycock's recent victories he has a fair chance of achieving it It is true that the betting k slightly against him, and tome of the sporting papers which profesB to know maintain that if Hanlan choose 8 Triefcett cannot get within half a dozen loat'6 lengths of him. That will soon be tettled now, but there appears to be some uncertainty whether the race will really be run on its merits. So far as Trickett is concerned be will do his best No one, at least on this side of the equator, doubts that. But Hanlan is a slippery customer, and his Canadian antecedents lead us to believe that his exertions will greatly de pend on the state of his friends' betting books. However, besides the struggle of to-day there is also the proposed contest between Trickett and Wallace Boss; and 1 the series of races nest week for the j Hop-Bitters Company's prues, in which j Trickett and Laycock will meet the best of England and America. If they | win it will be another leaf for Australian athletic laurels; if defeated, we hope and believe they will not ba dis graced. It really appears as if there w*re no English sculler who can face Australia's be6t at present, aLd it may be that pro- i fessiouai rowing has pasted ite palmiest days i on the Thames aud Tyne. The calling of the waterman, from whose ranks the chiioipiiin *t'u!l<Ts used cliieflj to be drawn* is btcouiiug a thing of the past. The time i bas long since gone by when the wherry was the principal lack conveyance of the metropolis, sad when tbe races between the rival watermen were conducted in die werf boats in which they earned their living. In those days the professional waterman waa in constant training and there were larger numbers to choose from; now there are only a few who follow the calling, and these do little in their <j*ily em ployment to develop their staying or sculling powers. Their calling gives them small advantage now, and just like other men they have to give, up their avocation and go intotouning in a. different kind of boat and with a different style of rowing before they have a leasonaUe chance of success against a carefully trained opponent. " Landsmen" and amateurs an thus not so heavily handicapped and ban a chance of coming to die front Joseph Sadler was originally a chimney-sweep, and Elliot began life as a miner; the oU style of watermen are panning away and there is not sufficient inducement to bad others to pay such constant attention to rowing as to attain the lost standard of professional excellence. The interest taken in the doable event of to-day — the return of tUe Eleven and the decision of tin boat race, shows how wide-spread aud deep* rooted is the love of athletic sports in Australian youth. It is a good sign, indicative of tbe stock from which we are sprung, and of die healthy spirit which is fostered under sannyskiea. Of coarse ttd? pkature in athletics may be carried to excess, and a writer in the November num ber of the Fictorum JRttwvthutk«tfcat iti? co. Amt^thedJsajTpeablecbacac^Bristics of the coming Australian he finds *«n in ordinate love of field sports," and a "grievous dislike to mental effort." He alleges that "Hie no exaggeration to say that out «f every ten native Australians* nine spend all their leisure ia tie practice of either cricket or lootfcalL* Ifthfewere even approximately true there it i^ht be some foundation for the threnody which titia* writer sings over die intellectual barren ness of A«rfj?Kf« youth. .But then is exaggeration, and it is not the case I that moderate love for sport? destroys the desire for mental impwroeafc.
