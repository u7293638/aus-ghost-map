A HYENOUS AFFAIR. SIR,—Your Tantanoola correspondent's sea-serpentine yarn of last week, in which he drags the poor old tiger up and down your columns and brings hint out at the end of a long yowl as a hyena, is moonshine, or square- bottle, or strong tea, or bull-ant bite; or something serious of that sort. In the first place a hyena does not howl or cry, he laughs; and the only excuse for the state- ment that a hyena's call is like the cry of a child is that a hyena would probably wail miserably if let loose in the area of the ordin- ary newspaper correspondent. Nor have the trappers deserted the commonage. One of them indeed wants a monopoly of it—pro- bably he likes hyena. Once, when a whale was found on the beach near Port Mac- Donnell, a fearful ghost was invented to keep visitors away from the vile-smelling carcase and the valuable perks that are to be found in a whale. If rumor is correct the hyena- tiger story, in respect to Tantanoola Commonage, was invented for much the same purpose.—Yours, etc., SODA AND LIMEJUICE. Tantanoola, 13/3/99.
