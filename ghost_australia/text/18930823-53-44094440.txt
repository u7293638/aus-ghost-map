THE SULPHIDE PROBLEM. TO THE EDITOB OF THE BARRIER MINER. SIR,-In your leader of yesternight you alluded to the three stages through which every , reform must pass. Well, sir, -the great reform of this diàtriet, or whatever name we may choose tb give .it, is the so-called sulphide problem. Is it a problem ? I know men in Broken Hill .who, if they had a little hard cash to back them up (not thousands, but a few hundreds), would easily and cheaply bettie the whole .business,» and .that * on .an; economical'scale, too ;. but; they cannot .work without the necessary money to assist them. * But I think that if these mien were approached with the offer of, say, £1000, if required, tb erect the .necessary plant, and a promise of a liberal: guerdon in : case of success, it would not be many weeks ere the much vexed question would be set afc rest. I see also by your paper that a gentleman from; Adélaïde intends visiting Freiberg to consult the expérts on this problem. Don't you think it is a great waste of money ? We some time since had a great expert here experimenting on the ores; but with whatnresult? A voluminous report, and the matter still " as it was." Why not try to encourage and develop local talent?; But 'I fear the old John Bull habit of consulting foreign talent to'the exclusion of its own sons is rampant in Australia. Consequently, no one outside a certain social cliqué has the ghost of a chance to do any- thing for the good of. the district. Now is a good chance for the formation of a small syndicate to raise the above named amount, and with sufficient influence to guarantee the reward if successful, they, of course "standing ia" Pm sure they, would not repent it. Will some one take it up? He will be a benefactor to the district. Tam, «fee., SPES. Broken Hill, August 23.
