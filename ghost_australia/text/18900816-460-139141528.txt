'ihe handicaps for the Al.C.O. tournament have been freely discussed, and, as 'a rule, give satisfac tion. It is a pity some more of the players who are deemed fit (or the intercolonial team are not taking part, so that the public rnizht have something more than hearsay to judge the merit of the Tarious players. There were two matches of very great in terest in the first round, but tbe play was cood. It is hard to say Who will win ; but whoever does there will l>e some hard work in froiit ol hiui before the end is reached. Shuter and Green meet In the semi-final for the 'Varsity championship, and the winner has to play A. Oiticer. In the doubles the winners of Green and Officer and A. A. Chomle.r and Hutton luve to play Shuter and 15. Balfour. The intercollegiate matches are to be played next week, and should result in a (Treat fight between Ormond and Trinity.

South Melbourne are at the head ol affairs in the third doss; but Kew are now playing so well that they will take a lot of beating, and the same may be said cf Gratis-park, which olub is now playing for its first season. The championship of the world has been won by Hamilton, the Irish champion, who defeated Barlow in the semi-final, and W. Renshaw in th? champion ship round. America, Ireland, and England were all represented.
