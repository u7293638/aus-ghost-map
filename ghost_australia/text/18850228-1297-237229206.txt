A HEADLESS GHOST- a headless ghost has made its appearance near Ejihrata, in Pennsylvania, where, it excites considerable curiosity and alarm. There is no doubt whatever (writes " rit. James' Gazette," of January 17), aB to its being a veritable ghost. It was first seen by the Reverend Daniel Witner, when returning home ono evening from the school-liouse in Manor township, whero he had been preachings Mr Witner had gone but a short distance when fie saw coming towards him what he supposed to be a man carrying a lantern. On the nearer approach of the object lie was, to use his own expression, " almost paralysed with horror " to find that it was a moving body with out a head, His terror was still further increased on seeing the head carried in one of the hands, " The fearful object," he says, " took its place by my side and accompanied me to my very door. How 1 managed to retain consciousness and reach home I don't know. It was the most fearful experience I ever had, and I hope I may never have the like again." The reverend gentleman's statement is fully corroborated by two ladies and a Mr Kaufman, who from a distance of about a hundred yards saw the ghost meet Mr Witner and walk away with him, but were too appalled by the spectacle to interfere. The ghost has since been seen several times, and the nerves of (lie inhabitants of the district are described as being in "a frightful state of tension." It is somewhat refreshing in these days of vulgar " spiritual manifestations " to hear of a good old- fashioned gliost without a head, of whoso blood curdling qualifications there is no mistake. These headless ghosts were ouce common enough in this country, but have of late years become almost ex tinct. Perhaps tliey have all gone to America,
