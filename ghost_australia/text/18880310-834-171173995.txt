If'(-; j.ifc of tlio Past. Keep out SI tho past ! for its highways , Ai-o ramp with malarial gloom ; Its gardens are sore,' and its forests aro droar, And overy whnro moulders a tomb ; ; - Who scoks to regain its lost pleasures Finds only a roso turned to dust, , And its storehouse of wonderful treasures is covorou ami coaiou wicu ruse. Keopout of tho past, it is haunted,' ' Who in its avenues gropes Shall finfi thero tho ghost of a joy prized tho most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopes. In placo of its beautiful rivers \ ' Lie pools that aro stagnant with sliino, ' And those graves gleaming bright in tho phos phorous light . Cover dreams -that were slain in their priino. Keep out of tho past ! it is lonoly And barren and bleak to tho view, ' \- Italh-OB have grown cold, and its stories aro old, \- - Turn, turn to tho present, the now ! To- day lends you up to tho hilltops, That aro kissed by tho radiant sun,* To-day shows no' tomb — all life's hopes in bloom.' And to-day holds a prizo to bo won. .— Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
