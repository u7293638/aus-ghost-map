What was the motive o£ the two old gentlemen in resuscitating the ghost at the* recent meeting Of the Prince Alfred Hospital P Were they actuated by senility, garrulity, ov bigotry,, or by the three characteristics united P Whatever may l*m«~*i Vinswi $-Vi^in ♦virif.i »ri* $*.Vimv A t nf.rivV nr] f*vif? rln$'.fw/?l version of the lamentable occurrence at Clontarf 23 years ago may be credited by eome of the generation that has grown up since then. To prevent ouch a calamity I would suggest that the evidence sub mitted in last Saturday's Freeman talc en from the daily papers o2 March, 1868,, should be printed in pamphlet form and distri buted broadcast throughout the colony. A special copy should be sent to every professor and student in the University., where Sic William Manning is Chancellor. I am willing to give my mite towards the expen-.e of publishing euch a pamphlet. Toura faithfully p A VOLUNTEER IN '68. March 24.
