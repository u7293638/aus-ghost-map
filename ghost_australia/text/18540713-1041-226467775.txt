POETS' COllNISR. FRANCE AND ENGLAND. We tnako no boast of Waterloo ; Its name excites no pride in us ; Wu hnve no hatred of tho French, No scorn of Yankee or of Rues. The or.oitv that our fathers gained In bloody warfare years agonc, And which they tplk of o'er their cups, Gives us no joy to think upon. In truth, we rather love tho French, And think our fathers did them wrong ; Anil sometimes blush whon in tho streets, Quitu out of dato, an ancient song- Ghost of a prejudice— comes hack, And tells us how, in days gono out, The host of Englishmen was ho Who put a dozen French to rout. Wo havo no foolish thoughts liko tlieso Of France or any other land ; An.l jcalousios so poor and mean Wo'ro somewhat slow to understand. We'd rathor with our frionds, tho French, Encourago kindliness of thought, Than gain a scoro of Wutcrloos, Or any battle ever fought. And in-Xhis yoar of ' forty-six, Wu rising men in lifu's young prime, Aro men who think tho French liavo done ' The world good service in their titno. And for thoir sakes, and for our own, And freedom's sake o'or all tho earth, Wo'd rnthur let old feuds expire, And cling to somothing better worth. If thought of battles gained by us Disturb or gall them, let it rest ; Napoleon was a man of men, Hut noilher wickedest nor best : Neither a demon nor a god ; And if they. will adore a king, The honest man who rules them now Deserves a little worshipping. ri o be at slrifo, howovorjust, ' Has no attraction to our mind : And as for nations fond of war, Wo think thorn pests of humankind. Still, if thera must he rivalry Betwixt us and the Fruncb, why, then' Let earth behold us, while we show Which of tho two aro better men. We'll try the rivalry of Arts, Of Science, Learning, Fruodom, Fame— We'll try who first shall light the world With Charity's diviuest flame — Who. best shall elevnto the poor, And teach the wealthy to bo true— Wu want no rivalry of arms. Wo want 110 boasts of Waterloo. C. M. Dally iVcitij.
