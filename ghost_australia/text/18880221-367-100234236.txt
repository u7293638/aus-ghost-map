*EEP OUT OF THE P.AST. , KEEP o0t of the past I for its highways Are damp with malarial Rloom, Its gardens are sete, and its forests are drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb, Who seeks to regain its lost pleasures Finds only a rose turned to dust, And its storehouse ot wonderful treasures Is covered and oateJ willh dlst. SKeep out of tile past I it is Ihaunted, He who in its averonue gropes h8ball find there the ghost of a joy prizoed the most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopea. In plaeo of its beautiful rivers Lie pools that are stuagnant with slime. And those graves gleaming bright in the phosphoruh light Cover dreams that were slain in their prime. Keep ont of the past! it is lonely And barren and bleak to the view, Its fires hato grown cold and its stories are old. Torn, turn to tie present, the now! To-day leads yon up to the hill.tops, That are kissed by the radiant ans; STo.day shows no tomb--all lifo's hIope in bloom And to-day hIolds a prize to be won. -Chclsgo Tribune.
