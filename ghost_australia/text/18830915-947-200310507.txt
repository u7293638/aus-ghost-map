TO THE EDITOR. '. Sir,— -Your issue of this morning contains a letter from Mr. Pearco on tho above water racos, to which I orave roply as a mattor of simplo justice. Mr. Poarco's statoments are bo utterly absurd, and, to use a mild expres sion, so very inacourato, that they hardly de serve a reply, but if riot replied to, porsons not convorsant with tho localities might accopt thom as faots. Mr. Pearco says that the Boobyalla Com pany havo applied for 45 heads of water whore there are only 12 heads available, as statod in caso Banca v. Aikonhead. Poor in nocent- Mr. Poarpo, if thoro should be only 12 heads running in the driest season of the year, 'might thoro not bo during tho winter months more than 45 heads, and for a great, portion of tho summer 45 heads running ? And ?if the Boobyalla Co. had only applied for 12 heads, ,thoy could only tako 12 heads, no matter how largo a body of wator might bo running past ! Don't you wish th'oy had ap pliod for only 12 heads ? ; . Again'Mr. Pearoostatos that the Tasmanian Company-will havo triple tho supply of water the Boobyalla. have. Only yesterday, two prospectors, . with . an intimate know ledge 'of the Boobyalla Rivor, and having no interest in oithor raco, andwoll acquainted with the 'point from whioh each raob takes its' supplies, state that the Boobyalla Company havo, during tho driest seasons, always a largo body of wator ruuning paBt thoir intake, and that the Tasmanian Company, during tho dry months, havo little or no waior running past their intako, giving tho following rqagbns :— '- That up 'to where the Boobyalla Company tako theiri water tho rivor is' confined, and littlo oxposod'to tho^sun; ;but at some distance bolow tho river falls-very, considerably, and then opens out into marshes, whioh, duripg tho summor .months,1 absorb almost all tho water coming down; They also statod that, the creeks ' arid tributaries (of ? Iwhioh Mr. Pearoe rnakea. so . muoh) running ;into the, Boobyalhi bolow tho Boobyalla Company's' intake' are, during the summer months, with orio 'oxceptiori, dry_,' arid . in any case of no praotioablo valuo ; it being a difficult mattor ?-?':', !.-Y.r .f :'i.' ?-? !.::' .viO'i'!'.-Ie -c'l vi-'-.-i '?' ? oven to got a drink from thorn. I am also' informed that tho lato manager of tho Banoa Tin Company, situated bolow tho Boobyalla, .Company, kopt a rocord of the water running' , past tho claim, and that during tho dry. .. -months it was praotically nil. Again, Mr. Poarco says : tho Boobyalla.; prospoctus speaks of two routes. It doosnot. . It says tho route can bo Rhortonod by eight, miles. It if) tho sanio routo, and tho distance is saved by thoir securing a largo rosorvoir ; , into which tho raco omptios, instead of1 fol lowing round tho hills. I am also informed that a Govornmont survoyor, woll- known at Mount Camoron, whoso name I sond you,'-' positively asserts that tho point tho Tas* ? manian Company tako thoir wator from is. littlo, if any, higher than the point they in- '_ tond taking it to at Mount Cameron; .' .

Main Line Railway. Why does not the Government' at- once abdicate in favour ; of the manager of that Oompany ? It matters not what absurd scheme may her ' | propounded by Mr. Grant, it will be seriously considered by Ministers, and in. - due time submitted to Parliament. The ' country has already incurred the expense of erecting telegraph poles between : Hobart and Launceston and of affixing two wires ; what on earth should prevent a -third wire from being stretched upon - them ? We should not be surprised to learn that the Company's polea are nearly ; dpne for, and that the' present scheme is '?'? to get them renewed at the cost of the colony. .??-.-. New Norfolk Hospital for Insane. — The report of the Commissioners of the Hospital for the Insane, New Norfolk, for- ' the year 1882, which liaa' been recently ? presented to Parliament, shows that 341 i patients were treated during the year as' '? compared with 318 in 1881. The per centage of cure3 during the past year was 38 -4, and the average for the past ten v years 37 '5, whioh is considered satisfactory. . There have been no accidents during the \ year, but unless additional buildings are : soon provided, immunity from violence ? cannot be expected to continue, as, the- space available for separating the violent . ' patients from the quiet is restricted. The deaths during the year numbered 27, or- ' 7 9 of the'inmates. The cost per pationt reckoned on the net expenditure was 6s 8Jd per week; which is smaller than in ; the case of similar institutions elsewhere; The want of a library is to be regretted, but this could be readily alleviated if' ; newspaper proprietors and others would . send to the institution such papers, peri- ' ' odioals, etc., they may have no further use for.. The Superintendent and ; medical officer report that during the' ' year 52 patients were admitted, and of - these four recovered; 20 recovered/ \ ! patients were discharged during the year. ' 'J The total amount received from all sources; was £1744 r^Lls 3d, and the gross cost of ''': the institution was £7726 63. ' '?'''' \ .

Henri Conscience, who, we learn from Men of the ,Kiim, wns bdrn at Antwerp of French parents on December 3, 1812, and to gratify his avidity for reading became a private teacher, and was thus ong'aged when the Belgian revolution of 1830 broke out. He entered tho army, and served six years as n. volunteer, the active military life having a wholesome effect on his dreamy disposition, and he became the poet of the army, his French songs, full vi puuib uuu BjJUit, uuiiiy vviy pupuiai amongst his comrades. He was discharged in 1836, with the rauk of Sergeant-Major, and having quarrelled with his family became by turns a working gardener, an employe in the archives of Antwerp, and clerk to an Academy of Arts. After quitting the military sorvice he allied himself to a party that had in view the establishment of a Flemish literature, in opposition to tho French literature of the 18th century. To this task he devoted all his powers, and his first work, 'The year of miracles,' published in 1837, con tains a series of brilliant picturos of the Spanish rule in Flanders. It was received by the public with ravour, and tiirougn the kindness of a friend he obtained a small ' pension from Leopold I., and 'in 1845 obtained the appointment of Assistant Professor in theJJniversity of Ghent, where he had to instruct the.' Royal children in the Flemish, language and literature. M. Conscience has pro duced a variety of interesting sketches of Flemish life and manners, such as ' The Tihri nf FlnndnrB.' ' Evening Hours.' ' The Executioner's Child,' 'TlwNew Mobe,' 'The Conscript,' 'The 'Poor' Gentleman,' 'Jacob Van Artevelde,' 'Blind Eosa,' and several other works, which have been translated into English, German, Danish, and Italian. He pub lished his memoirs in the jRcuue Content poraine in 1858, and in 1870 once more' gained the prize for literature, given ?very fifth year, by his romance, 'Bayo on Lieveken,' which may. be ,. classed among his best works. In this work, as in all his writings, M. Conscience con trives to insinuate the gravest and best advice under the most amusing forms, and according to his wont, pleads the cause of virtue by proving that after all itte the best policy. , Pkesbntation io Mb; G. Oiivbk.— a complimentary tea was yiven Dy ine members of tho Wesleyan Church Wed nesday to Mr. G. Oliver, on the occasion ? of his retirement from active connection with the church, after a period of 40 years' service. The tea was held in the Wesleyan School-room, Patterson-street. Theattendance was very good considering the inclemency of the weather. The tea was followed by a public meeting; Rev. J. G. Milford osoapied the chair, in the absence of Rev. G. T. Heyward. Tho meeting was for the purpose of presenting Mr. Oliver with a handsomely illumi nated and framed address. An address' was given by the Chairman upon the fol lowing points : — To love thyself and neighbours, and showed that in doing so they cultivated the love of God and doing the right ; and secondly! taking an interest in things around ; and, thirdly, spoke upon honour being given to whom honour Is due, alluding to the guest of the even ing, ana speamng upon nis many gooa qualities. The Chairman in presenting the address stated that a purse of 102 \- . sovereigns was in the hands of the Rev^ Mr. Heyward for presentation to Mr. Oliver, who would receive them upon a future occasion. Mr. Oliver in replying said he was quite taken by surprise. He would keep this testimonial for tho remainder of his life as a memento of the treatment he had received. The choir then sang several hymns. Addresses were delivered by Messrs. Matthew Tyson, F. Stanfield, F. Tyson, D. Cocker, and Captain Wyrill, of the bark Berean. The pro ceedings, were wound up by prayer. ivA Stbange Recovery. — A few days ago an expensive silver-mounted walk ing stick was brought up in the dredge, working at the Market Wharf. The stick was obtained by one of the men on the. wharf. While out walking with the stick shortly after, he was stopped by a gentleman, who identified the stick as his property. He stated it had dropped through one of the cracks between the boards of the wharf, about a fortnight before It was recovered. It is needless to say that the stick was at once delivered up to its rightful owner. -Demonstration at Evandale. — A Grand United Friendly Societies' Demon stration, will be held at Evnndale on Wednesday, September 26th, to celebrate the anniversary of the Loyal Clarendon Lodge, I.O.O.F., M.U.
