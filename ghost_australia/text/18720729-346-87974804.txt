They were to i;.vc in the country at her father-in-law's, where she was welcomed as a pet. Her ambition was to live in Paris; she was a prey to a mania "to appear in society." iter husband knew nothing of a city life, and having no ocupa tion, quickly fell into the vines of the capital. Pending tho war the Counttfss lived at Geneva, while the husband. .jQiued the Mobile* pa a captain. After tlie poaue siie \Vas delivered , tf Kcr only child, and subsequently came to Paris for mcdical advicc, where she remained.
