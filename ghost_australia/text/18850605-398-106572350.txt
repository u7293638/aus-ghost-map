A Hen oil lier Eggs. An I c-.h I this time I've got, I think, just five, White as the moon upon an August night. I long to see the contents well alive, For those chicks, still unborn, are my delight. My eldest egg—now let me pause and eee: He'll be a valiant rooster-bird, of course, Having the grace » f the ailantus tree, A linnet1- voice, the brute streii&ih; of ahorse. My fcccoiid, I must very fondly a ream, Will bs a poulc delettres, and very ivi.so; She in linguistics will be held mpn-ne, And fhe will learn the idiom o£ i i<: ilies. The,! third, delicious, speckled egg ol mine Will bring me forth the handsomest of make, With military genius, I opine— A fowl the foe of garden slugs and snaila. That ether there—that dotted little dear— Will cause my poor maternal mind regret; For she will be, I positively fear, The waysvard Cleopatra of my set. But, ah ! the one that has a beauty mark Eight on the top, from Duty ne'er will quail; She, Christian-li!:c, will suffer in the dark And be the chickens' Florence Nightingale. So saying, the hen clacked loudly in her joy, And waved her wings upon the unhatched eggs; Bui tben appeared a stalwart poultry-boy, With squinting eyes and odious crooked legs 1 He seized lier offspring right before her eyes, Took the three best, the ones she prized the TB03t. And, to the mother's infinite surprise, Vanished around the corner like a ghost! And, while she hurried after him to say, " Spare, spare my children, and be ever blest !" A weasel, who bad seen no food that day. Happened to trc:np along, and suck the rest. —Cupid, J^oncs.
