Christmas. Voices. ·---o-- · · So Christmas is here again : While the house sleeps quiet as death, 'Neath the bright moon comes the waits shrill tune, % And we liaten and hold our breath. The Christmas that never was On this foggy wintry air, 'With clear pale gleam, like the ghost of a dream, - It is painted everywhere. The Christmas that might have been It is borne in the far-off sound, Downthe empty street with . the tread of ..feet That lie silent under ground. The OCristmas that yet may oe, Like the Bethlehem star, leads kind: Yet our life slips pnast, hour by hour, fast, fast, Fow before and many behind. The Christmas we have and hold, With a tremulous, tender strain, Half joy, hall fear-be the psalm of the "1 rlf passes, blessings remain!" The Christmas that sure will come, Letus think of at fireside fair When church bells sound o'er one small green mound, \vbih the neighbors pass to prayer. The OChrisatmas that God will give Long after all these are o'er, When is day nar night, for the Lamb is our Light, And we live for evermore.
