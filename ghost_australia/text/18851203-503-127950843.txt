'I really did not notice hor,': said Stornfeld, in his lifeless way. The major and five of his officers mado thoir visit to Castlo Lancut. Tho Countess ISlsa and hor aunt Odcscali recoived thom charmingly.

'As a widow,' said tho Countess Elsa in farowoll, I havo no reception day, but I hope whenever you aro riding by you will come in for half an hour when you havo the time to spare — and as many of you together 11s possiblo.' There was a charming aiv of command aboub hor lasb words. As a soldier's daughter and a hostess, sho wished to be on good terms with all tlio officers' but to . none intimately. .

But she did nob ask tho question for the sake of any answer, for Madame Odescali'3 liveliest means of expression was an eternal, gentlo siuilo.

But one chance threw hor with him. f. Ib : was on the. high road. ' A lovely ..summer : daj' wits changing into a disagreeablo afternoon of angry wind and dust. Tho Countoss Elsa was sitting in alittlo pavilion at tho park gatos_, whoro she had brought ?lior work, and now sho loso and leaned ovor tho balustrado to watch a littlo caravan that was boing swept along -tho road. It consisted of a boarded Italian carrying a little child 011 his back ; beside liim ran a littlo boy with throe'pots,- and a tiny girl wrapped in a coarao cloth, like a scarecrow, and tho rear was brought, up by a young man with a hnss viol, a violin, and a bundle of clothes. 1 They trotted by, poor childrbu of bho soubh, driven forwartl. by tho raw wind ot tho north, antl biio Countess Elsa's eyes followed thom with tho shadow of tears. Ono moro came after ; but 110, I10 did not belong to tlicm, this tall man in tho faultless military cloak, : and cap pulled far down ovor his brows. His eyes and hers met so directly t-lirib he could nob but pause and bow. 'Did you see tho poor people?' she askod, as she leaned ovor tlio railing.! Tho pale officer ncared tho/givtcs and. . rested one foot on tho lower stop of her pavilion, but sho did not invito him in. 'Poor pooplo?' I10 inquired, as if astonished. ' I. saw 110110.' ' Oil, you aro up in tho clouds !' cricd tho countess. ''Thoy woro just in front of you, and at first I took you for ono of thom.' Ho did nob smile. Such a tiling seemed impossible for his quiet features. ' Oh, you mean tho Italian musicians. Why do you call thom poor? They aro. two, they liavo children with thom. I call , thom rich. What does your tendor hoorb find to pity in thom Thoro, was slight iron}' in his tone, not tliab of a dosire to wound, lmb that which springs from a bibterly roused heart. . 'Do you nob seo that they havo no mother, and nohorne ?'cricd.tho countess. 'Home? Why, they havo the loveliest in the world— Italy.' . . - 'Italy!' bIio oxclaimod, angrily. ' Every man has tlio land of his birth, L suppose.
