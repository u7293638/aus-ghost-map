POETRY. Beyond Kerguelen. Down in the South, by tha vaste without Mil n- u Far from tbe sone of the blossom and tree " Lieth, with winter and whirlwind and wail en it Ghost of a land by the ghost of a Â»ea. " ffeird is the mist from tbe summit to base nt t. Sun of its heaven is wizened and grey, Phantom of light is the light on the face of It Never is nieht on it, never is dav. ' Here is tbe shore without flower or bird on it Here is no litany sweet of the springs : Only the haughty harsh thunder is heard on It Only tbe storm witb a roar on his wing ! Out to the south and away to the north of it 8pectral and sad are spaces untold ! All the year round a great cry goeth forth of it Sou of this ieper of lauds in the c -ld. C. Kendall
