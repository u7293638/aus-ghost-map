THE PHANTOM "COMPS." In an ancient German city, In a narrow, gloomy lane, There stands a mouldering dwelling With many a broken pane: The mildewed walls are crumbling, And the Spirit of decay, Like a black, ill omened raven, Broods o'er it night and day. They say at blackest midnight, When wise folks are abed, 'Tis thronged with spectral shadows, And filled with sounds of dread ; The form of Faustus hovers High in the ebon air, And at his awful summons The phantoms gather there. They are the shades of printers Who lived in olden times, Doomed to pick ghostly types up, In penance for their crimes For drinking and for swearing, And other sins, not few, That in this "moral age" ev'n: The "comp.s" addicted to ! They throng that spectral dwelling, And seize on rule and stick, And, like the beat of seconds, Resounds the ghostly "click"; With lightening speed they pick up-- No "whip" this south land boasts Could even "hold a candle'" To any of these ghosts. 'Tis said that they are setting The black and damned scroll Of witchcraft, for which Faustus To Satan sold his soul. And wayfarers belated Who chance to wander nigh, With limbs that scarce support them, And hair upstanding, fly ! But where the cock's loud clarion Thro' the morning air sounds shrill The phantoms quickly vanish, And all again is still : Through broken pain and doorway Streams in the sun's fair light, And looks upon no vestige Of the phantom deeds of night !
