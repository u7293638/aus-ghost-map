fiDiocellaneoute. Grandmother Gray. Br Mns. N. L, RiArns. I THINKs Tommy Gray fully appreciated the fact that his bisad was buttered on both sides for when he got into a street riot with Charlie Wilson, who threatened to toll Tommy's father and get him an "all-fired liekin'," slaster Tommy just ran off saying: "Dasen'tl I've got a grandmother tow home." Tommy's grandmother was the kind of a woman who is all fire and flame in youth and all ashes.of-rose in old age. BSie had been a beauty once, but there was nothing to show for it but "the tender grace of a day that was dead." Wrinkles had taken the place of dimples, her eyes had burned themselves out, her cheeks were shrivelled, and as for teeth she had only two in her head. "But, thank the Lord, they are opposite t'eash other," said Grandmother Gray. She had a lap for the children, too-most grandmothers don't have any lap-and she sung them to sleep every night. Tommy had made her promise in an unguarded moment that she would rook him to sleep until he was 21\. She seemed in a fair way to do it, but she reposed hid overgrown feet and limbs on a chair and fondled the curly head till be had just "awakeness" left, after his grand matin vespers, to enable him to steer straight to bed. The songs she sung were very funny ones, or very sorrowful. They were either of the" ti rooral-to-loo" order. or like " Hark, from the tombs a dseoful sound." What Tommy liked most was the Scotch ministrelsy. He never tired of "Over the water and over the les, And.over the water to Charley. Oh, Obarley loves good ale and wine And Charley loves good brandy, And Charley loves to hiss the girls As sweet as esugar candy." Tommy thought there was an eduaestional difference between him and Charley, but he made no comment for fear of being deprived of the music. On Sundays she sang: "I'm wearin' awa, Jean, Like snaw wreath in thaw, Jean, I'm wearin' awa To the land o' the leal." "An' what is * the leal,' grandmother?" Tommy would ask. And the aged woman would fix her sad, tired, patient eyes on the blue beyond and make auswere in her loy, quavering voice: "It's oye to be true, ms boy, true to your king, true to your God, and ower true to yoursel'." The old lady had some quaint ways. One of these was always to attend the grandest church in the parish, where a celebrated divine preached in tbhe moderh vernacular of \- -ha theology. " Why do you go to hear so amoeu a preacher?"" someone asked the old lady. "Do you understand him ?" " Na," she answered, "I dinna hear a word that he says." " Then what pleasure can yousget out pof his sermons." "Child I" answered the old lady re verently, "can't I see the holy wag of his head?" "Is there a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, grandmother ? " that graceless Tommy wouldaask. " Aye, child." "And does anybody find it? " "Aye, many. And they go far first. It's not in the fleshyou'llfind what lies hid at the end of the rainbow." She could tell time by the flowers and the sun. She had seen a ghost. BShe could find Job's coffin in the sky. She had a charm for bruises and cuts. It was like entertaining an angel unawares to have this dear old lady with them, for, under her little superstitions, lay a grand soul. One day she counted her years and said " I'm getting old." "Nonsense, mother," they laughed at her. " You are only a girl of 80." "I remember when I was 18, and had roses on my cheeks," she said. "I wonder when they will ever be there again." One night the children went into her room. tobe rocked. She eat in the twilight, and the lamp was unlit. She sent them away, first kisio them all around. She kissed Tommy twice he looked like his grandfather whose likeness she hadworn in a breastpin for forty years. "I'm expectin' company," she said to them. "Gang your ways, and God's blessing go with ye." It was Tommy who jumped up in the night from a fearful dream and ran into grandmother's room for comfort. She still sat in the window. At least her figure was there, but Grandmother Gray had gone away with her company.
