SPORTING. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. Melbourne, October 10. [By Telegraph] [From our OWD Reporter.] Saturday morning was nne enough to induce a splendid attendance at Caulheld, but before the racing began there was a heavy shower, and later in the afternoon it came down very heavily, Fortunately, this was after the Grand Foal Stakes and Guineas had been decided, so that the results of the principal races were not affected by the weather. The racing was good, the Guineas being a most exciting set-to between Maddelina, Volcano, and First Consul, and the latter ought to have won, but be seemed to run unkindly until thev got into the straight, and then he just failed to make up his lost ground. Both the Guineas and Foal Stakes winners were bred at Morphetville, and the result of the day's racing will still further increase the reputation of Sir Thomas Elder's stud. A large field weighed out for the Maiden Plate, and Newmaster, an outsider, won cleverly from the lucky Highland Chief. The Ballarat people served Huntsman up very warm for the Hurdle Race, and after'a good race with Bonnie .Lad he landed his backer's money. Fourteen saddled up for the Foal Stakes, and the Sydney people declaring in favour of Yetman he left the paddock first favourite, although Epicurean, Sumatra, and Hortense were all backed. The Lockleys filly got the best of the Btart, and having the race in hand all the way she won by four lengths from Perhaps and Yetman, who r<tn a dead heat for second place. The stable did not profit much by Hortense's victory, her unlucky defeat by Mistletoe having rather damped their ardour. The Guineas came next, and with no stable money for Maddelina and Blairgowrie, the other Sydney representative, Volcano, went out at even money and odds on. The start was not easily accomplished owing to First Consul and Maddelina refusing to toe the line. The favourite got eff well, and appeared to be running over his field u^til Maddelina tackled him, when he speedily lost place to the mare who led into the straight. At the distance Blairgowrie bore down on the leaders and looked all over a winner for a few strides, but he died away again and left Maddelina and Volcano to struggle on with First Consul in hot pursuit. In the last 100 yards Maddelina began to stop, but she just squeezed home by half a length, while First Consul, who came with an extraordinary run in the centre of the course, was only half a head behind Volcano. With the exception of First Consul the field were all span out at the distance, and had Power been able to get Hortense's brother going earlier he must have won easily. On returning to scale Hales protested against Colley for boring him on to the rails, but after hearing the evidence the Stewards dismissed the objection. When the horses were weighing for the Hunters' Cup the rain began to come down in torrents and the start was delayed some time. Charcoal made most of the Tunning until he slipped-up on the flat, after which he never got to the front again, and finally fell at the last fence. Union, the favourite, was always in a good place and led into the straight, when Mr. Inglis, who had ridden a very patient race, sent Goldfinder to the front and won cleverly. Hogmanay and Middlemarsh were the only two backed in earnest for the Toorak Handicap, and the latter won cleverly at the finish from Richworth and Hogmanay. The following fs a description of running :— the MAIDEN FLATE. Of 150 sovs., and a sweep of 3 sovs. each. Special weights—3 yrs., 1 st. 7 lb.; 4 yrs., 8 st. 5 lb.; 5 yrs. and upwards, S st. 8 lb.

At the home turn Crown Brand was done witiv and Newmaster entered the straight, with Yule Cake next and Highland Chief coming fast. The latter made up a deal of his grcund from the distance, but failed to catch Newmaster, who won a good race by a length.

The whole lot were well packed at the heels of Revenge as they ran along the back; but after rounding the far turn several dropped out, and half a mile from home Revenge was just clear of Huntsman. In the run home, however, the former retired, and Huntsman won a good race from Bonnie Lad. Yet Again was a bad third, Ocean fourth, Sinking Fund fifth, and Fusee last. Time, 3 min, 58J sec.

After some delay at the Dost, caused by the fractiousness of Albert Loddon and Abydos, the flag fell with Hortense well clear of Yetman, Rattler, and Perhaps, while Abydos, Nectarine, and Albert Loddon were left at the post. Hortense came striding along the bend, with Perhaps, Epicurean, and Yetman in pursuit, Sumatra being at the head of the others. Entering the straight Epicurean made a run, followed by Yetman, but the result was never in doubt, Hortense increasing her lead in the run home, and winning in a canter by four lengths. Yetman and Perhaps ran a dead heat for second place, with Epicurean a <*ood fourth, Lady Lovell fifth, and Sumatra sixth. Time, 51 sec. WINNEItS or THE GREAT rOAL STAKES. Yr. | Owner. Horse.

When the signal was given Volcano and Retort were the first to show, with First Consul nextj and Volcano settled down two lengths clear of Ghesham, who was followed by Blairgowrie, while Maddelina was bringing up the rear.. Coming to the G-furlong post . Chesham ran up to Volcano, and a little further on he headed him, while Blairgowrie, and Gadfly drew np, First Consul falling back a little. "Volcano and Chesham raced past the half-mile post abreast, the favourite going easily, while Blairgowrie and Gadfly were - at their heele, and Colley putting the whip on Maddelina, the mare began to run through her-lorees at a great pace. Before the turn was reached Maddelina had caught Volcano and Chesham, and she led Volcano into the straight, Chesham, who was badly beaten, giving place to Blairgowrie. Coming to the distance Maddelina had Volcano in trouble, and just then Blairgowrie made a dart at the leaders, but he collapsed again and left Maddelina and Volcano to fight it out. .Volcano answered very gamely and was catching the filly again, but he was shut in on the rails, where Hales could not use his whip, and M&ddelioa; won by a short half-length, while First Consul, who came with an extraordinary rush at the finish, was only beaten by half a head for second place. Blairgowrie was fourth and Gadfly fifth. Time 1 min. 46 sec. Yr. I WINNERS OF THE CA0LF1ELD GUINEAS. Owner. Horse. sire. Time m. s. 18S3,Capt Osborne Wheatear _ Epigram 1 49 18S2 W. Pearson..
