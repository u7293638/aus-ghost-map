THE WAGES OF LABOR. In the Edinburgh Review there is a re markable article on this question. The writer says:—“ In our view the future of the working class is practically secure. The growth of capital, the additiou which capital makes to the value of his labor, the cheap ness of the necessaries aud comforts of life— all these are gain to the laborer. It rests with himßelf to make a wise use of . his op portunities, and we have every confidence that he will. Nothing was more remarkable in the recent strikes than the scant atteutiou which the Socialists. received as compared with those who held up realisable ideals. The very leaders of the movement lost half their recklessness- by contact with the real working class. Already the friction between employer and employed is far less than the friction • between the various classes of ex changers. There is no ground to fear that the laborer will be tempted to push his demands to a point at which capital will leave the country or individuals cease to accumulate it. He is far too shrewd, far too well grounded iu the conditions of the problem, to indulge in such rashness. He has gained self control; he has gained discipline. If he still leans to measures which savor of boy cotting, it is n mere ghost of the Sheffield outrugee, which still haunts the scene of industrial strife. But if he is to reap the full advantage of the richness of modern life, his character must be strengthened by self-reliance, not weakened by spasmodic sentiment; his intelligence must be trained aud his life brightened by a greater variety of general aud special knowledge; he must learn to rise, through tile self-effacement which combination implies, to a sense of the responsibilities which rest upon the citizen of a great industrial community.”
