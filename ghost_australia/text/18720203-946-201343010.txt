. .-llALI.AB.il V. NOBTK TASMANIA. VA, match between eleven of Ballarat aud an even number of Launceston was played on the Launceston Cricket Club Ground on Thursday, wickets being pitched at 10 a.m;, the Ballarat team goiug into the field; Messrs. Hogg and Martin ap pearing with the willow for Lounceston to the bowling of Gaggin and Hunt, Hogg receiving the first ball from Gangin and opening the score with a light cut for.' one ;,a little play by Martin and he fell a victim to Gaggin, who was bowling in fine style. First wicket for 7 runs. W. Glynn joined Hogg, and Hunt's third over took his bails. * Two wickets for 14 runs. At this, stage of the game many persons thought that Launceston stood a very good chance of being defeated in the same manner as Hobart Town, but : John Arthur, who succeeded Glynn, by a very carefully and skillfully played iunings of 87.' altered the state of the game ; his score comprised 2 fives, 8 fours, and 9 threes, the remainder being made by twos and singles. At first Mr Arthur was very stiff, on account of having ridden 40 miles, and being also in a very delicate state of health, unable to do any mischief, but he gradually warmed to his work. After Mr Hogg had placed 13 to 'his credit he was caught by Mann off Gaggin. ' W. 'Collins joined Arthur; tho - two went to work in earnest, and the 'score rapidly ran up from 22 to 83. Pampliilipn succeeded Hunt bowling but with no effect, and Cleverly relieved Gaggin, his1 first ball being a wide, when Collins gave MeKenzie a chance, which ho was only too glad to get, and Collins retired hav ing played a capital innings for 35. Fuller next appeared, and another' change in tho bowling — Kilner going on at Hunt's end, and Gaggin at Painphilion's. Two maiden oVers followed, Fuller playing Gaggin's in fine style, the fielding during tho over ' being the best in the game Fuller then drove one from Kilner to log for'oue, which was beautifully handled by Ballantyne, ? the telegraph showing, amidst a round of applause, 100. After one or two more had beon obtained, Hunt went on at Gaggin's ond with the slows, and Fuller's life ought to have' ended, but Mann missed it, although tho ball camo right to his hand ; after a few more had been obtained by Arthur, Fuller was caught by Kilner, having made 11. 5 wiekets for 124. T. Barrett now joined Arthur, and in a very short time the telegraph showed 150, although Hal-,' lantyne with slows had gone on at Hunt's end, Gaggin going on again at Ballan tyne's end and bowled a maiden, and then gave up to MeKenzie, who bowled a maiden, which Barrett tried very hard to spoil, but the fielding was too good; Another change in the bowlers— Wynne going on nt McKenzie's end, the tele graph slowly but surely creeping up un til it reached 181, or one more than the Ballarat team ' put together in Hobart Town. Ballantyne again went on with the slows, and Arthur gave Norman a chance, which was willingly accepted, it being the only one he had givon during his long innings, the score being 22 when he. went in, and before ho could be dis posed of, with tho assistance of Collins, Fuller, and Barrett, it had reached 195. Dr. Maddox made 11, and be was the only one of the others that reached two figures, the innings closing for 214, Bar rett carrying out his bat for a fine played 54\. Hunt and Pamphilion immediately showed at tho wickets for Ballarat to the bowliDg of Hogg and Fuller, and 22 runs were quickly made, when Pamphilion was finely caaght by Martin. Cleverly was next, and Hunt being finely caught by Hogg, he was joined by Kilner, who, after having made I'd, was run out. and Wynne being bowled: by Hogg, the board showed 4 for 43!. Ballantyne came next, and cut the first ball for two.- which was rather clumsily handled by W. Sams. W. Collins then went on . at Fuller's end with the slows, and BaMantyne drove the first to leg for 5, and; was caught very neatly by Daly at point in the next over off Hogg's bowling having made 14, the top score for Ballarafc ;: the others made no stand, and the innings closed for 67;, or 147 be hind Lanneeston, who decided' ou putting them in again on the runs. 'McKenzio and Kilner being first, Hogg and Collins bowling, but they and' JYorman were quickly disposed of, the tetcgraph mark ing 3 wiekets for two. runs,. Pamphilion and Ballautyne got togot'jer and rapidly ran the score tip to 84. -fvhen Ballantyne gave the ghost of' a chance, and Fuller after running nearly 3'0 yards, succeeded in terminating his career. This -was decidedly the fine'jt catch in tho game, and wa& loudly applauded. Gwynno was next, but \ras caught by Arthur, making ewickots for 46 runs. . Hunt and Cloveriy now got into the run of the bowl ing, which, \hej punished very severel; and in spite of several changes, at 7 p.m., when the stumps were drawn, had managed to run the score into three figures, and the innings with 6 wickets down closed for 102, Hunt having con tributed 36 (in which there was one' 5 and 3 fours) and Cleverly 27. Mr J&; . Douglas stood umpire for our eleven, during their innings, and Mr G. Collins and afterwards Mr Wingfield for Bal larat; Mr Cowlo and Mr Spicer scoring; An excellent luncheon had beon provided in Mr Talmnge's usual style, to which the players did ample justice about 2 p.m. There was a good attendance including many of the fair sex in the afternoon. At the close of tho game, an adjournment to tho pavilion took place, where a nice» dessert was laid out and Mr W. Collins tho captain of the Launcestonians pro posed the. health of the Ballarat team, coupled with tho name of Mr J. L. Bal lantyne their captain. Mr Ballantyne in a short speech said ho had heard it whispered about, that his men were out ot condition, having been travelling alt day Wednesday, but he did not wish to tako advantage of any excuses. He said they had met bettor men than they antici pated, and on the part of the club he begged to return their sincere thanks for tho very handsome manner in which they had been received, and to present the captain with the bat which no acknow ledged they had fairly won by superior cricketing. Both clubs drank the healths' in three times three, and after the um pires and scorers had been duly honored the company returned to town.
