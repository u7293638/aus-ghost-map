MOUNT G-AMBIER BEET SUGAE COMPANY (LIMITED.) {To the Editor of the Border Watch;) ' Silt.-I observe in' last Saturday's Border Watch a notice from the Directors of the above Company that all shares on which the allotment call is not paid with interest will shortly be for feited. Now, Mr; Editor,. I cannot cpnceive the reason why the Directors wish to force the un fortunate shareholders to pay, more money towards a project that lias not the ghost of a chance of success. Perhaps they * want a fresh proof ,of the confidence of the shareholders in the shape of continued payments, hut I think the poor deluded country shareholders have payed enough already. ' At the Company's iialf- yearly meeting recently held, the Directors-told the shareholders that unless they could sell eight thousand pounds worth of shares they could not commence, the factory. Now, Sir, I have not heard that any shares havebeen taken up since said meeting, and under these circum stances I am at- a loss to know; what do the directors waut further payments forseeing, as tliey must see, that the project must inevitably come to the wall. One thing that strikes ine now for the first time as remarkable is, that some of the gentlemen wlio were at the beginning of the affair, and who used all'their persuasive powers to induce others to buy shares, took good 'care , they did not invest, heavily themselves. And now, Sir, I will only add that unless I see a better prospect / of the Company making a start, I will pay no more calls for the reasons already assigned. By\insertingj the foregoing you will kindly oblige, . , Yours, &c.f; . A SHAREHOLDER. .Mount GamFier, August 19, 1872. '
