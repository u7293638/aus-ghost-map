CURRENT LITERATURE. SIR HENRY PARKES'S EARLY LETTERS in Emigrant's Home Letters By HeArtY PAiures With Preface and Notes Ivy Annie A Parkes Sydney Angus and Robertson lSOfi the historian of the future home will miss the interesting story of Australasian development will go to public documents for his facts, but it is to smell modest title volumes as the one now before us that he will turn for the human interest and personal colour with which he will endeavour to invest the few remarkable figures flint move across its horizon At the risk of borne; misunderstood, it may be said that the career of Sir Henry Parkes, historic ally considered, will be found to belong to the earlier phases of what may be called modern Australian history He it as a type of the colonist that came hither it in the early forties, and though lit war-time one of the most influential figures in our later political development, mo must return to that fact for the key to his political career in this little book, which is published as a tribute of filial respect by idjutrktei who has given many evidences of devotion, we get familiar glimpses of the personal and domestic character of lit my Parkes at a time and under circumstances which leave no doubt of the book's authenticity is a veritable human document " It consists of a number of letters written between the years 1913, when the water was in London prop ring for his emigrant ver ago to this part of the world, and 1811, by which time the severity of his earliest struggles as a colonist may be said to have been over They are letters written under such circumstances of domestic confidence that one might almost have a temple in reading them, even in this printed firm, if the spirit in which they are edited by thoughts daughter did not it lRsitro the reader They are presented almost exactly nothing left the writers hand " They were given to me It Francois bridge early in the eighties b) my aunt Mine," says the editors, "and it was her wish, and my father's also, that I should publish them after his death " Most of them are addressed to his eldest sister, who died in ISbl during her brother's visit to Line md In a brief introduc- tion Miss Parkes describes the circumstances under which Henry Parkes and Clarinda Varney were married at Edgbaston, a Birmingham suburb, in 1830 and. how, " after a bitter struggle for existence," they decided on emigrating to Australia There is a note of pathos in the preface which will hardly fail to strike the most unsympathetic reader, where a daughter pleads that her father will not be judged by the years between 70 and 80 "The mistakes, the errors, and the failures of the last j c ire of his life," we read, " will be wiped away as one would brush dust from a beloved dead face " A hope is expressed that some may learn a lesson of courage and patience from his life "By' the glorious nuns, by the li gh hopes, by the great author of meats, and the singing clearance of his grand manhood, will be be judged," Miss Parkes writes here, "and when Australasia takes her place among the great nations of the world, his name will be meet bed in golden letters upon the annuls of her history " The book is just what its title describes, a collection of letters, and it would hardly be fair to the publishers to extract their matter in a row less notice But it may be said that the writer gives a graphic picture of the early vicissitudes of his wife and himself both in London and in Australia Tram-way oiling in England now is different from what it was in the late thirties, when Henry Parkes and his young wife of went up from Birmingham to London in a second class carriage, through the windowless sides of which for 60 miles the rain and wind heat with such bitterness that, says the traveller, " I began to think we should surely be the subject of a tale in the Penny Storyteller,' entitled 'The Weather Slain " Even in those days there were imaginative touches in his speech, echoed later in life in his speeches, as when he writes of the locomotive as the ghost of a devil that dragged us " But most of his talk is of practical matters, as of engaging a room in Hatton Gardens at 6d a week, of turning a few made-up goods into money so that he can set up a lathe and of Ina disappointment with London " It seemed as if there was no place for me among the countless multitudes of its inhabitants, he writes, and " in) thoughts then turned to emigration " He writes of his preparation for the voyage, of his books, his few chattels, of his little dog " If you or someone belonging to me," he writes to his sister, " could keep him when I am gone I should be very glad, for that little mi - happy animal seems a very part of my unhappy heart " The letters convoy a depressing picture of the emigrants prospects in the old country " However I may fare on the other side of the globe we find him writing just before Christmas in 1838, "I do not think it can much more darken my prospects of the future " When he at last got work in London it was at turning twine bow.es for tradesmen's counters work so heavy, he says, that it almost mastered him He writes to his father in terms of strong filial affection, and now trad then we got reference to his early literary attempts at verse His description of the voyage, of his arrival in Sydney, of his early struggles here, are all interesting reading He gives a description of his life as a labourer on the estate of Sir John Jamison, near Penrith The earlier experiences were most discouraging, but as matters improved a more hopeful tone comes into these letters The birth of his first child at sea gave him and his wife a companion who helped to lighten the burden for both , but Henry Parkes seems to have thought of returning to Europe and visiting Java, Manilla, or India on the way He is perpetually giving an account of the books he is reading, and which appear to have been a constant solace and encouragement In 1842 we find him writing that he sighed for a permanent home " It may be fried in the immense wilds of this wonderful country," he says, "or amidst the native haunts of the New Zealand savage , or it may be in the beautiful and fertile island of Otaheite, or in Chili, or Peru, or it may be among the settlements of Malacca, or in South Africa, or the United States of America, but I am sad to think that it is not likely to be in my native land, though I still must hope to lay my bones in old England" In 1841 there is written what he calls a " love-letter to his wife," and in an appendix are some early biographical particulars from an old friend, and some of Sir Henry Parkes's early verses We understand that this very interesting book is published for the benefit of the editress, and, although produced by observe tion, it on sale in the ordinary way Uwe We Made Rhodesia By Major AurHTra Girl, leEONAED London Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, and Co., Limited, 1896 The writer of this book took an active part and interest in Rhodesia during the years 1890-91, when, as he says, that latest addition to the Empire was coming into existence Formerly attached to the Second East Lancashire Regiment, he entered the police service of the Chartered Company, and he claims in the course of his duties to have " come into close contact with everybody, from Sir Henry (now Lord) Loch and Rhodes down to the tramping prospector with his swag on his back the sundowner of South Africa " Major Leonard must have had some intention of utilising his experiences, for he seems to have kept a careful diary and copies of letters written by him during these years He dedicates his book to Cecil Rhodes, the Company, Jameson, and the men who made Rhodesia, as a memento of the work they were engaged in, and he evidently holds justly vigorous opinions about the clear heads, cool hearts, and strong hands of those men of action adventurers, as he says in the true spirit and literal sense of adventure Major Leonard, it seems, received by cable the offer of a troop in the Company's police from Sir Frederick Carrington in March, 1890, and was at Cape Town within four weeks His descriptive touches begin at once, and as the writer is an Irishman, and writes like one, he has a good deal to say for himself and all that happened to him " The prevailing ignorance of the country and of all things in general is, astounding is one of his early observations Khama struck him as a man of intelligence and humanity, a natural gentleman, and king by the divine right of his own striking individuality He found a son of Moffatt the missionary, Livingstone's friend, postmaster at Pilapwio Leonard's troops turned out to be a most heterogeneous collection of ox-lAfe- guardsmcn, ancient mariners, sprigs of nobility, hairdressers, ex brokers, but of excellent trials an a body, and all ranks grit to the backbone The extraordinary prices paid for everything and the still more extraordinary methods of business are too reminiscent of Australian conditions in the early goldfield days to read strangely to us, but not down here as they Struck the fresh eye of this observe! they make graphic reading enough Incidentally, Major Leonard has some hard things to say about the way in which British policy in South Africa has shaped itself The loss said of it the better, he says When the history of the Queen's reign is written it will appear as a blot on the record, he thinks, and writing as far back as August, 1890, it is interesting in the light of subsequent events to read that Cecil Rhodes was about to infuse vigour and masterly activity into that policy, and that there was more in the most 1101 th towards the Zambesi than was apparent on the surface Ali cody he notices a tendency on the part of the young men among the Matabele to got beyond the King's control and strike out on their own lines and then, in the course of one of his discursive anecdotal passages, he talks about a comrade who was able to assure him that Charles Let us never wrote one of the inimit- able names to which his name istt.fliT.cd The real author, this informant desired, was Lea of a brother, who was carried to the story-tellers father, and prevented by his cloth from putting his name to those rollicking tales Towards the end of the year leonard came into personal contact with Rhodes, who at first dis- appointed him. But he left an impression of great moral strength and capacity, of dogged determination and desperate tenacity, but with an inclination to petit] may if he could not have his own way On the whole Leonard says the impression was more powerful than pleasant But the book is full of racy description, of shroud observation, and of reflected enjoyment of the life the author led in South Africa It is often 1 it ed to give a good idea of the conditions under which Jameson and his comrades trade Rhodesia, of the class of men they were and of the peculiar I difficulties that came in their way. It gives a good idea of the robust apt Undo of Englishmen 'for the rough work of colonisation, and in many ways is an indicating contribution to an m foresting chapter in the history of the country Two additions to as many series published by Messrs.
