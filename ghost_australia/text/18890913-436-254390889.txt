A RUTHERGLEN GHOST. Rutberglen (says the Sun) has always been noted for having its ghosts. Several years ago one of these individuals used to make occasional visits about the bridge across the railway leading to the churches, generally appearing when children and ladies were passing, thus avoiding detection or capture. During the past three months his gbostship has again made his appearance, and a few Saturday nights back gave a fright to two young men while going towards tbe railway bridge. This success evidently made his gbostship very bold, as he suddenly appeared the other evening at one of the windows at the dwelling of tbe late Samuel Benjamin, and luckily the occupant of tbe room was a stalwart young man, who was not to be intimidated by the appearance of the white vision outside the window, quietly armed himself with a paling, and suddenly opening the window, sprang through, seizing his gbostship with one hand, and made free use of tbe paling with the other across his ghostBhip'B back, which quickly brought forth the ejaculation— " D—n it, I am not a ghost; knock off, it is only a lark." These sweet appeals found no sympathy until his ghostship began to smart severely under the blows he received, and upon the tablecloth being removed from his head revealed the form of a well-known sapposed gentleman, following the respectable vocation of a clerk. It is to be hoped now that this party has been revealed that thesp night pranks will be brought to a close, and we compliment tbe young man who unmasked him, but think he lacked a duty to the general public in not taking his ghostship to the horse dam at the lower end of the town and giving him a bath.
