The Weird Bird of the South Atlantic. As the craft bowls along in the Son i Atlantic a new world seems to open on ti ¡ voyager. The constellation of the Southe: , Cross has scarcely become familiar to hi before he begins to see animal, or rather bù i life altogether new to him. One of tl greatest novelties of this kind that can evi impress itself on the mind of man is tl albatross. 'Some morning the lounger wi reach the deck and, casting his eye in tl wake of the ship to judge her speed, will s< a speck just above the horizon far aster: Growing larger and larger as it approache it finally develops into a gigantic bird, an the old sailor coming to the helm, will gruffi suggest the fact that it is proper for the iyr to wet his first introduction to an albatross There is something inexpressibly weird abou the bird itself, as well as in its manner o flight, and it is a matter of little wonder t those who have seen it that a brain such a Coleridge's should have hit upon it for thi text of his Lady of the Ancient Mariner Without a beat of wing, without motion o: the body, the bird will, by long, easy goinf tacks, swoop up from astern until it geti within easy watching distance from the shij it chooses to follow. It will then "lay too," at that respectful distance, and after taking thorough stock of the stranger that has in- vaded its domain, will, with no apparent effort, swoop past the ship to port or star- board, as the case may be, pass it by several cable lengths, and then, laying to on tho opposite hand to its advance, allow the ship to pass it, and will then once more take np its post as rear guard to the procession. Nothing can be more ghost-like than the action of the albatross in thus passing or being passed. No stroke of the wings occurs, and all the motion apparent, except that of the almost unintelligible cleaving of the air, is the half-turn of the bird's head toward the ship, made as if to see what manner of beast this was that had come to bother it. Though sailors are over probe to superstition, they seem not to be very particular as to the sacredness of the albatross, and will always assist in a capture, in spite of thc curse Coleridge associates with its killing.
