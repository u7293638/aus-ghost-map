THE HUMORIST. CARL DUNDER. THE STOBY OF A BOY WHO BELIEVED IK DBEAH8. Shildren, I shall now tell yon der ehtory of der poy who pelievee in some dreams and eigne. Bis name vhaa Hana Dunderwetter. nnd he life mit his folks shut at der foot of a big hill in Shermany. I haf seen dot hill my self, and eo I kno w dot ehtory vhaa pooty true. Vhell,vhen die poy vhaa abondt 8 years old he goes oafer to ahtay all day mit an old womans, and she tells him all abondt bears nnd ghosts nnd dreams and signs. From dot time he Than a ehpoiled poy. If hie (adder litre him to go do wn oellar he vhaa afraidt of spooks. II his mother like bim to go oop shtairs he vhas afraidt of bears. I like to say to yon right off dot no ghosts vhas eafer known in any country. A ghost vhas a white sheet hanging on der paok of a ahair, or some bed-spread left oat on der fence in der night. Dere vhas some bears aronndt. bat dey doan* come in der house to pite yon. In eoooh a place like Detroit yon may go all oafer und yon doan' see one bear—not one. He vhaa afraidt to come here. If he does he vhas dead in two ruinates. Und so Hans he always peliefs in signs nnd dreams too. If he dreams dot he fall down a shteep hill he doan' get ondt of bed until 10 o'clock. If he dreams dot he vhaa a fish, he vhas scart und hides in der baro all day. If he sees a crow fly to der north dot vhas a pad sign, nnd Hans don't shop any wood dot day. If he sees a white eow go along mit a red horse after her, dot vhas a sign of money, nnd he goes oat and walke 10 miles for to look for some pookethooks in der roadt. He vhas nogoot to Die parents, una eierypoay else makes fun of him und says he vas soft mit der headt. Vhell, ehildrens, Hans vhas growing oop inabadtway. If der moon vhas oafer his left shonlder he doan' hoe ont some cabbages nor work mit der potatoes. If der snn goes down oafer his right elbow dot means he shall go to town und get a letter in der post-office. Between dreams und signs he vhas no goot for work, nnd he goesabondt in rags like he vhas a beggar. Hie fadder liok him more as fife hoonered times, und his mother ery more aBh two barrels of tears, bnt it vhas no use. Vhell, all dis goes on until Hans vhas 16 years old. Den one day he Bees two hens on der fence, while two crows fly oafer. At der same time somep^dy shnoree in his schleep, nnd der bucket fall down der well. He took dot aeh some awful eign dot he muet go out in der woods nnd get some bark from a tree doc vhas hit mit lightning, nnd if he make some tea from dot bark he lif to be 90 years old. Away he goes, und party qaeek he meets a wolf, who says "Ah!—yum !—how pleased I vhas! Der wind blows my tail to der left side hut night, und dot vhas a sign dot I eat a poy for sapper 1 I meet yon on top of a hill, and dot vhas a sign two more wolves come oop!" Vhell. children, all dot vhas trse. Dey find dot poy 8 bones in der forest, nnd ahuat vhen dey pick 'em oop a coon runs oop a tree baok end first. Dot vhaB a eign dot somepody'a horse vhas in danger, and der peoples runs home and find dot Herr Denderwetter's pig White horse vhas shoked mit an apple. Doc vhas all my shtory. I like yon pelief some of him. If yon pelief dot anybody who eees ghosts—dot anybody who peliefs in dreams— dot any person who vhaB guided by eigne vhas soft on der bead, like pumpkin pie, yon bit her right nnd needn't oe afraid. I oan pnt all der ghostB nnd shpooks in my ear, nnd ash for signs nnd dreame yon vhas more apt to fall und preak yonr nose dan to peoome rich.
