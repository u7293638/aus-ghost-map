" Dr. KELYNACK responded. He said he was not aware of the exact basis of the new association which was gathering together those from that western soil which they all loved so well.

Further, be imagined they desired to remember in this way all that was best in it, all that was true and noble that they might exemplify those same qualities under those Southern skies. (Hear, hear.) There was no intention also, he believed, on the part of the association in some way who who knew not of, to stretch out its hand across the seas to help the struggling and the worthy as occasion might altered, from what was often a hard grinding lot to one in which the conditions of life were more easy and more conducive to well-being. (Hear, hear.) While it aimed at that he trusted one further object of the association would be to hearken one another as Cornishman in their loyalty to the great duties which belonged to this great new laudation, hear) -a land that opened up a sphere to everyone in which their ambitions and strength of character might combine to make it a home to compare with the one they left behind, and to which they so tenderly thing. (Hear, hear) He referred in warm terms to the picturesque beauties of Cornwall, and to the characteristics of its people. The Cornish type was one, he said, which could not fail to comment the respect and esteem of all who were brought into contact with it. The country had brought forth sons and daughters who worthily accredited her in the old world and did not dishonour her in the new. Many eminent instance I might be eil d of distinction, won by Cornish mon-of men like Simmy Drew, of Opie, the painter, and Humphrey) Davey, of men who had fought in their country's cause and had died upon the battlefield, of men who had of night upon seas which were crimson with their blood, and yet again, of others in different aph rest of life who were equally worth), having con- st (rated their which intelligence, BCll-sscrifico, and labour to speed the causes of humanity and religion. (Hear, hear.) He said that much to doniiinnfrato to them that they were connected with an illustrious brotherhood, and to urge upon the in the duty which arose from such an association that they must PI ck to cultivate worthiness in themselves. (Hear, hear.) if they only caught the best traditions of the dear old land, imitated us best examples. and reproduced its spirit of unswerving devotion to duty, in that way they would beat attest their attachment and fidelity to all that was best in the old home, and most ably discharge their duty in increasing the purity and power of the new one.

Like the Scotchman, the Cornishman was not or at home except he was. abroad. It had been stated that there were 32 Cornishmen In our Parliament, and he replied that, if the burn- ing eloquence and keen wit of the Cornishman were more frequently heard in Parliament it vfru d be the better far it (Hear, hear.) He did not intend to make reflections, there were at least Cornishman enough to form an association, and a very respectable association even to start with Why should they not have an association? As a rule our associations were got up in the interests of trade, but here was one established for mutual help, for intercourse, and for keeping up the memory of their childhood and their Home. (Hear, his sr ) It was a long time since some of them left the old home, and many chances had happened. The railway had got there, and the giants, the ghosts and the skins had gone. He did not know that it was a bad thing after all to keep up racial associations. He liked the cosmos less, but the cosmopolitan lover was frequently a very poor thing.

A Cornishman innocents n was a very natural thing. Say what they might there was a separateness, and a distinctiveness about the man w his car could not be denied, 'they had lost the Cornish parliament and language, but they still retained the Cornish brogue, the Cornish temperament, and the Cornish blood, (Hear, hear.)
