MR. MASKBLYNE. the well known con- juror, and Dr. Weatherly are evidently of opinion that things are growing serious in the world of miracle. They have accord- ingly laid their heads together to produce a sort of counterblast against the marvel- lous in a volume which they call "The Supernatural " (Arrowsmith) with a note of interrogation at the end. It is not a moment too soon. Every day brings forth its exhibition of abnormal powers, and-London has become one vast lecture- room of the Salpétnère. ln one estab- lishment they are hypnotising people in battalions, in another they are holding heated debate on the possibility of grow- ing roses with a wave of the hand. Elsewhere two or three strong men are breaking chains or lifting weights by the ton, one against the other, as " abnor- " mally " as the rest, for their muscle is as much out of the common as a Mahatma's brain. Lastly, a delicate woman is putting even these giants to shame in feats of physical strength, andin her case it is only the touch of an electric hand. The doctor and his conductor have evidently not put pen to paper a moment too soon in the interests of public sanity. One of them ia a human witch finder-that is to say, a finder out—and he may be regarded as the hand of the process of exposure ; whilst the other iis the brain. Dr. Weatherly expounds the philosophy of illusion and hallucination, Mr. Maskblyne shows how the thing is done They have chapters on spiritualism, chapters on dreams. Ghosts receive the hardest meseure from them. They will hold no terms with phantasme of the living; and for Theoso- phy in the occult department the severity of their language in only the just measure of the intensity of their contempt. They, have nothing new to say about these things, but they repeat the old things for the purposes of warning. Dr. Weatherley holds that natural emotion is the origin of all supernatural seeming. All our phantasms, he says, are either illusions—that is to say, cases in which having some fixed idea in our minds, to connect it, through the organs of sense, with a wholly fanciful image without—or hallucinations in which we reverse the process. In the latter, we work from without inwards. We see something—the need of a turnip outside of us, and it im- mediately suggests to our disordered innerssa* the bead of a ajana*.
