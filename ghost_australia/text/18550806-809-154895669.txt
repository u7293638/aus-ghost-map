, COPPIN'S OLYMPIC. ? ? Miyurooice appeared for a second time in (or . on) His Last Legs on Saturday evening ' diffu sing amongst a crowded audience , ? ' Mirth:that:wrinkled care derides - !, And Laughter holding both his sides.' By way of- thoroughly exhausting the risible ' power* of the public, . Mr. Coppin followed ud the Irish farce with that droll absurdity the Wandering Minstrel, winch includes, as every body knows, the interminable son c of ?' VilHInn. and his Dinah,' a composition that appears to admit; of unlimited expansion and a manifold variety of choruses, each of the latter being fur- ' tlier susceptible of expressing all sorts of emo tions proper to all kinds of people, whether substantial entities or shadowy ghosts. ' How often it was encored, how often the 'wandering ininstrel' was compelled to return to the foot- ^ tights and 'cliaunt' another stave, how he .! raced the posthumous adventures of the suicidal lovers _ through every phase of .possibility and ; impossibility, and how thoroughly the .audience relished the information that, the bottle of poison was /.labelled ' colonial beer,' may - be safely 1 eft to. the imaginations of those; who were not r,iere and the ' recollections of those who were ? ? there. _ ,. ., ' ,.. ..' , . If there is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous, ; we suppose the converse 'of the ^ proposition holds good, and we take that step ' when we mention that this evening Mr. Brooke appears in the character of Othello.
