A FAIR BRIGAND. .. BY GEORGE) HORTON. CHAPTER XXX._(C0JJTINUED.) Mrs. Williamson was seated on a sofu with her arm about Kyriakcula'a 'waist. Noticing that the girl, was seized with slight spasms of trembling, she pressed her waist gentiy and paittcd her Cheek In a motherly wity. Kyrlakoula nestled closer, smooth and warm , us n young lioness, and cast a glance at her thai secured half gratitude, half despair. "Her eyes are actually black," mentally ejaculated the director's wife. "How eurl- . ous 'Mint I fold the Countess yesterday, they were brown!" "I'm beginning to receive ui0 proofs of my book," said Bayley to Dr. Brown, as sooii ns the two found themselves together "They're sending thorn In very fast. I got a ivad this morning that kept me busy pretty nearly the whole day." . . Brown was greasy, excited. "I must see your hook Uminediaitely. I eanmot go on- wltli mine until I learn what Importance you as sign to Arglvc influences on Attic bronzes.!' "I'll tell yon plainly, doctor, ' I " assign none at all.," ... "None at all ?" , "Plahiiy, no. I do net find among nu my Acropolis bronzes u single one whose orna mentation cannot be traced either to local or to Ionic influences." "But I cannoit "let such a statement go without a systematic and. If I liilght iisc the term, official rebuttal. When can' I' get the first copy of your book? I have always at tached great 'importance to your . studios, Mr.-: Bayley, "and do yet; but I can coiivlnee the world— I do net despair, of convincing' even you— that yon are now on the wrong track." % , : "Oh, I say! That's" putting it rather" strong. If I didn't ltn.ow what a crank yoii arc on Herieum bronzes,' I should call yoiig language almost nnpnofosSlbnal." , - "Now." don't ' be offended, my doav Mr/ Bayley.-' If I .didn't lcuoav the . importance attached 1n learned circles to your opinions, I should mot deem it so necessary, to refute them When they are mlslefadl'ug. .If- you will pardon the suggestion, your error hois arisen from the Met tha't you-havo 'nolt given realised that the motifs of the Arglvc School Had you spanlt foiir yonns, as I ihavc done, studying .Ilermum bronzes, you ..would have renllstfd that the nreflfs of the Arglve Sshool liave had 'a Mr "reaohlng Influence, ami can be recognised In the bronzes of ninny other regions. Such is 'the ease, for instance, hi the Act'opoiis bronzes. .1 hnve not studied those so deeply' as you lmve do-ire, but l't Is sufllelcn't for into .to .cast, my eye over the eolieet'lon to detect the rfamlltor ear merits of Arglve mOtlf." "If you wish 'to attack, my book," lifter- rnpiteil Bayley,, "yoii shall Iih'vc the pro'ofs Immediately; There Is a mall to London- let nre see!— 'the' day after bo-mrorrow. Yon elrall havc' the 'proofs early in the 'nrorning. I would , not Impede your, valuable re-' 1 Bvarolies 'for .moment. If the scientific world knew that I had kept ft waiting for anything, front yon, I should become tiio most unpopular .man on cai'bh." Dr. Brown did not understand tire, irony. A Napoleonic tlreaan had taken possession of hint lately. He was already the greatest liv ing Authority' on Argivc Bronzes, If. health and life were -spared to klin, might he not after ten, perhaps twenty years, of unremit ting .toll, come to be known at The Authority on Antique Bronzes? Not. "the greatest," simply "The," as Sappho Is called "The Poetess." " . "I must hhvo 'these proofs' of Bayley's be fore I put pen to paper again," lie reflected. "In sustaining any awiu theory I'll show so great a' knowledge of his speciality that I shall beat lilm on his own ground." "Didn't the Turks attack the Consulate?'.' Inquired the -Brltljh elergynnan. "No,", replied Mr. Greanier, "they did. not, although ,we slept wltli .rifles besides us, mo mentarily, expecting a siege. . T did a nice piece of work right there.
