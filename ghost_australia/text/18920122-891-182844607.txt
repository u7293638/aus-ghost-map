T^e entry w very poor, but only what might he expected from "the narrow, exclusive con ditions of the race The ''local" hrecder, in whose favour-the " local-" restrictions-are im posed, does not seem to appreciate, or, may be, appreciates too justly; the Townsrille Turf Club's liberality. Spleudide went down last week to Sydney, and will probably, run in the Challenge Stakes, J mile, and Turf Club Handicap, 1 mile 3 fur longs. at Randwiek, on Tuesday next, 2fith. Charlie Brown wired: up from Victoria-for Krtmlin and Bronzcwing to join hini in ITcl bounte this week, and the pair sailed by the Gabo on "Wednesday for Bobson's Bay. Tho Quesnslaml Riidng Calendar for Decem ber ar.d January was published this week, i At the Breakfast Creek races on Saturday Harry Edwards was disqualified for six months ! for foul riding in the Roma Handicap. ! Yesterday afternoon (says the Sportsman of Tuesday, the • 12th. instant)^ the V.R.C. Com mittee met at the offices of the club, and after serious debate, determined to fire a red-hot Vnot into the camp of their opponents—the un registered racing clubs. It has been for several .days pa.st rumoured that pronounced action was j.to be taken by the premier club against their lyoung rivals, and. for once rumour has not proved "a lying jade." There is no need •for us to descant upon this action, for 'the' phraseology of the subjoined motion jspeaks loudly enough for anything. Of course, it is hardly to be presumed that the minor clubs will remain inactive in the matter, and, accordingly, we may expect them to retaliate upon their seniors in some way. The pro nunciamento issued by the V.R.C. yesterday, reads as follows : " That-a copy of following notification be sent to every jockey, trainer, and bookmaker, licensed or registered by the Victoria Racing Club, and be also published in the ' Racing Cak-»dar' and the public Press, namely: ' Notic. 13 hereby given that any jockey, trainer, or bookmaker, licensed or registered by the Victoria Racing Club, exercising bis calling at or in connection with, or being in anywise interested in the racing or the running of any horse at any race meeting not registered by the Victoria 'Racing Club, thereby renders himself liable to have his license or registration forthwith revoked.' " Sacdgate acceptances on Tuesday last were Satisfactory, and leave ample promise of inter esting racing there on the 26th, Anniversary Day. Anticipations will be found along with the acceptances, and entries for the Selling Plate, in another column. Breakfast Creek Races, for Saturday next, filled fairly well, considering the counter attrac tions at Coorparoo. Results may be as under: Maiden Plate, Silverstream, or Tabooba. Bodondo Handicap, Diamond or little Jack. Hurdles, . Lord Dovel. or Bernice. Do run da ^Handicap/JJhggio Lauder or I^nra. Wodonga Handicap Dam or Cowboy with. a start, .otherwise 3foonlight or Lmu. Galloway 'Handicap, Kildaro or Laura.. Entries for the Q.T.C. Clajfidd Handicap, Hmile; and Eldernell Handicap,1J- mile; to be decided on February 27 and March 1. closed on Tuesday with 13. nominations for the un popular distance, and 17 for the mile, 30 all told, or seven less than for the same handicaps in 1891. And, perhaps, considering''the times, the reduction is not as great as might have been expected. At all events some of the best horses now in Queensland are among the liominutious. The Coorparoo entry for Saturday next is rather disappointing, considering the literal amount of added money, hut there is good class in lieu of • numbers, and the meeting promises well. Anticipations:—Maiden Plate.—Lottio or Brownlock. Flying Haudicap.—Lily S. or Forester- Moretou Handicap.—Levant- or Piora. Selling Pace.—The Swell. Handicap Trot.—Jess. South Brisbane Handicap;— Levant or Lionel. "Weights for the Newmarket Handicap and Australian Cup. to bo run at Flemington on February 27 and March 1, were declared on Monday last. Mr. Dakin has not been beguiled by tho wire pullers, and though 10 st. 4 lbs. in a lump of weight, it is not an ounce too much for Bungebah in the sprint race. Titan, in with 9 st. 7 lbs., has just 3 lbs. more than I antici pated, but tbe extra will make little difference; if he is back to his teat form it will not stop him. and if he is not, 9 st: 4 lbs or even 8 st. • •1 lbs. would not give liim a show; Strnthmorc, 9 st. 4 lbs., is • pretty well anchored, at 0 lbs. more than the brilliant Cronbrook carried to victory in 1 min. 14 V sees., but perhaps he is not really asked a severer question than was pnt to Mr. White's colt, who met a more brilliant field all round in the New market of 1SSS. Paris is fairly treated, and, over the distance, Stroznboli . might be at. least as good -as- Strathinore at a concession from Mr.- Wilson's colt of 4 lbs. Between 9 st. and 7 st. 13 lbs. there arc some terribly fast cattle— Tekram, Lord Hopetonn, Zalinski, Pigeontoe,. the New- Zealand Florrie, Ynrran, Oorsican.

Sfcrathmore at 8 st. 10 lbs., or 10 lbs. over his w.f.a., can hardly be considered well in for a three-year olu, albeit a Derby winner, and a placed horse for the Melbourne Cap. I like Gnaroo, Oxide, Portsea,. Zalinski, Florrie, Steadfast, and Albemarle better at the weights. Governor,-,, at 7 st. S lbs., hasn't the ghost of a show on his TattersalTs. Cup running. Ronald could not win with any weight on his back, and Governor 'was never 8 lbs. a ^better horse th3t Ronald (7 st.) Wandsworth has 0 st. 12 lbs. Splcndide landed safe and sound in Sydney on Sunday, says a telegram to her owner from the trainer, who is at Randwick. Mr. W. H. Brown tells me that Kremlin and the galloway Bronzewing left by steamer Gabo on Wednesday for Melbourne, where " Charlie," is travelling in search, of health. The Raker, Sir Oliver, and Godolphin, who were under sailing orders for Melbourne, were stopped in Sydney ?n rcuie by wire from the owner, who sent them into permanent quarters atBosehill. | Tho well known Queensland galloway, Totfcde, won the Sorrento Handicap, uo so vs., 1 milo and half a furlong, at Hoonee Valley, Victoria, on Saturday last. Orrnoud's namo is beginning to travel round the world like New bold's.

The going was heavy. The prin cipal events resulted as under : Corinthian Plate, A. "Williamson's b.g.

I "Veno " 'says-: Tho riders .ac a recent race I | meeting' held at Derby ("West Australia) appear | I to have had a rough time of it.. The Times I writes that tho meeting was a very successful one—no dearth of*" speculation, fair" fields ! i throughout, andtheracing good on, the whole. Unionist, wiuuer of tho bigmoney, wasbredover on the Queensland side, near Camooweal, and i is owned by Mr. Kennedy, -whopassed over-, land some time- hack-with, a mob-of horses.. The horse is a good.one, but a trifle*" giddy, •' uudcr certain ; circumstances. When called upon for -his preliminary canter, Unionist bucked his rider off, and cleared for home; but lie was secured again by. Mr. Kennedy, and brought back to the course just iu time .to start .with the others, and*.win all the .way. The four-mile- preliminary was just a pipe-opener. In another race with only two starters,: Mr. Kennedy's Safeguard also threw his rider, and ; left the-course, thus-- producing ; a walk-over. Br-the-way, this sportsman's horses, all seem to have acquired mi,, ugly habit of bucking, directly a; rider touches them on* the neck • with Ins. hands. Towards-, tho close* of the ; meeting it was difficult to secure-a jockey that wasn't maimed in some way; ouo horse .was steered to victory by a rider with a broken collar bone. At the termination of the fun the sporting fraternity looked like an infirmary out j for an airing. j After a most exciting " go1* for the premier- ! ship position amongst English jockeys M." Cannon was at the head of the list at the close of the season, the figures being:— Mounts. Lost. Won. M.Cannon ... 609 472 137 G*. Barrett .. 071 53S • 133 J. Watts .. .. *133 369 1U J. Wbodburn .. 505 416 90 R. Clialoner ... 501 425 70 Since " Moray1* Cannon and Gsorge Barrett passed Watts in the race for the premier jockey ship (says an English-paper) they have been j running neck and neck for the position of lead- I ing jockey. At Warwick they were level, but i when the curtain fell at Manchester M." Cannon ; was left at the head of the list with a record of ; 137 winners, against 133 wins by- G. Barrett. . J. Watts is third with 114, J. Woodburn j fourth-with. 90, and ;R' Chaioner, who only : won 17 races in 1890, is fifth with J 6. Among the amateurs Mr. " Ahington •"* stands* out almost alone with-a record of 29 wins out of 37 "j monnta. George M*Laugblin. the well-known jockey, was wonderfully successful at the late Bunda berg and Gynipie meetings, winnings no fewer than eight races 'out of eleven, mount?, and getting second placeiu-the remainder. This is a great- record. "The executive of the North era Racing. Asso ciation.have* Miggestcd the dates for-all the associated clubs during-:thc current year, but whether they wiil be adopted by the clubs or no remains to be: seen, The- Towers winter, meeting, is put down for Juno 23 . and* 24, and that of- Townsville for.July.7 and S.

At Raudwick on Tuesday the Sydney Turf Club meeting will he brought off, racing com mencing with the hurdles, in which the only Quecaslauder. engaged is General Gordon, handicapped at 9 st. 9 Ibi., to the top weight's (Satyr) 11 at.; and as the latter is probably the best class among the 17 entries, the impost won't stop him if ho be wanted. Australasian is at the top of the tree in the steeplechase, at 12 St., conceding Grafton only - C lbs.. Singleton has 10 st. 12 lbs.; Caledo nian 10 st. 3lbs.; and Clarence 9 Rt. 3 lbs.; und of the 17 nominations I like Singleton s as well as anything. The Challenge Stakes, x.inile, w a very open race. Trideutine and Alchemist can have little show, however, and I' fancy the winner will come from.the following: Prelude, TTlric, Rivula, Babel (if well), Arquebus, and Sham* rock. If Bungobah and. Paris could ba trusted to do their best, one of thera would win the Anniversary Handicap} for they hto handi capped below their form in very* moderate company.; but bigger game is probably their, dart, and I shall look elsewhere for the winner —namely, to Ethel bert, Affiance, Helene, Sun shine, iiiliiloe, and Rebel. To a finer point I will not attempt to bring down my propuesy. Sandgato races, on Tuesday next, 26th, promise moro than averago sport.

The following very pertinent and forcible criticism is from the same pen:—"The cummittce of "-the Queen's ^Birthday Racing Club, (Charters Towers) :havo recommended the issuing ..of .a programme of about OOOsovs., for their next meeting, to take placo ou'iMay!.24 arid 2G. May 24 falls on a Tues day, so that in this case the nsuul half-holiday would be used for the second day, and this ar rangement ^should-prove a* satisfactory one. In 'drawing* out tliia and other big pro gnunmesforihe coming 'season there is one Tuatter'Which I have frequently 'referred to,' ahdlwill'do so-again, that is, the desirableness of publishing the -conditions early, and closing, the'entries 'for. the two principal handicaps earlier;arid 'distinct from thcother-events on the programme, as by doing this we are sure t-o get a large number of visitors from other places, *bbth north and south. Where rich prizes are to be won, a'horseowner will often enter before he.has .really .made up his mind whether.he will- go to tbi* or that place at a certain.TimOjvbut'-whcn- he has seen his weight in-.the -big.races,-and supposing that he.is satisfied,.heidecides to come, .and afterwards enters for-such races-as-may suit him, on the. day-of general entry. . If,.however, he has- to enter straight away for eight or nine races at a time-when-his going a tall is only problematical, it is a decided deterrent, and prevents a good j many.from .nominating .ut -all .who would | otherwise .do so, .and perhaps afterwards" bring their " horses. It seems . that the coming .season is . likely to be more than usually attractive, as pretty well all the lead ing clubs are going in. for extended operations in the way of added money, and between the Queen's birthday, and the first week in July, that, is, .up to and including .the Towns ville annual meeting, thero will certainly be upwards of-itf.OOO to be run for within an easy radius. The dates of closing of stakes aro of but little importance to owners on the spot, but to make I suitable, and to give timely notice to those at a^distance, who are likely to become visitors, should be the aim of every committee in.pre |*aijfg-their, programmes." A report ot the annual meeting of members' of TcttersaU's .Club will be found in, another column of the Week. It has been published in the Telegraph. The report uud balance-sheet, which may be regarded as very satisfactory,. wcro adoptcd nem. and the new rules of betting, which are almost, but not; quite,' identical with those of the Victorian Club, were passed practically without amendment. "Bules ' 15, 16 • are not in force in Victoria. L If the ^former means* that double bets, deter mined when the first event is'lost, must he paid; on settling' day, before the second event is run, the rule is a bad one. An Irishman must be, rc.sponsible'for tho grammatical construction of the-latter. Bule No. 20 should-'have" been embodied 'in .the -rules-for the'guidance of members. It is a rule of * the club, and not a -rule of betting.
