Art and Artists. Queensland National Art Gallery. Two new pictures have been added to the collection in the National Art Gallery. "York Minster," by Harry Hine, R.I., is the gift of Mr. J. Godwin King, of Stoneland, East Grinstead. It is a beautiful picture in water-colours, showing the magnificent old minster to its best advantage. Owing to the Dean and Chapter having caused some of the old houses which surrounded the cathedral to be removed, Mr. Hine has been able to choose a point of view where most of the building is visible, the west front forming the centre of interest. A group of old red brick houses In the right hand corner enhances and gives value to the fine atmospheric effect. By the clever drawing and the beauty of the soft shadows on the lower portion of the buildings one may easily realise why Mr. Hine has made a name for himself as a painter of Eng- lish cathedrals. This generous gift is sure to be much admired and appreciated by the many visitors to the gallery. Mr. Godwin King, the donor of this picture, is a son-in law of Mr. A. M. Francis, P.M., lately of Sherwood. Mr. Henry Reilly, of Glen Aplin, Stanthorpe, sends as a gift his pic- ture of "Ghosts' Gully," which was ex- hibited some years back in the Queensland Art Society's exhibition. Local scenery well depicted is sure to be an attraction. Mr. Reilly is very truthful in his work, and shows to his best in the way he paints the Australian trees.
