? Tales a&dl; 8fc©t@&©s THE MYSTERY OF THE BLACK HEAD. V?'M'-' Morthen was very quiet when I paid i,t my usual visit last autumn. It.wasiqiiite late in the season, and the little seaside, village was almost deserted. Kind-heartecl' motherly widow Peters, who keepa^the^ Mertlien Arms, welcomed me with almost more than her usual cordiality. Her son Sam, active and willing, was in immediate attendance. .. . On, hisjbroad shoulders my portmanteau preceded mo to my 'chamber — the pld familjarjroom, clean and sweet, smelling 'of 'lavendar and of the salt sea ak,thatrpoured i,n. through, the ..open. .win- dbwr^-^I^soon unpacked' my 'traps arid settled my domestic arrangements* to my liking, and then I descended to my J' sit ting-room— in neatness and sweetness ?and cosiness the' counterpart' of: tne chamber above?— to find my meal awaiting me. Widow Peterssaid'' Yesilshe had had a good soason. A full house and plenty of visitors. ': The gentlemen : and ladies who came first had been kind and had liked the, place,' -she* supposed,'!; for they ? had recommended* others;' This was important to Mrs. Peters V- 'Not longbe f ore; , -I she .. had- metamorphosed - ? the tiny inud-walled ^brown-thatched' iinri I had known from my boyish days into a fairly large and convenient modern hotel/ It was a home for. her, tindit would be Sam's after she. was gone.' :; Now the quiet time; -had come. 'You have '.the house -to yourself,; sir,' she said, ' and I hope you willbe comfortable. : We always do our best to please you, and I hope if you want anything you will ring the bell;' with, ?which:: prosaic conclusion; the ? excellent ?woman benignly,8miledupbn-me;'arid de parted, closing the door behind 'her. .

The scene. -y as a wonderfully impressive one, and at any other time I . think two. of us at least, would have, been almost facinatedby the strange .weirdness of our surroundings ; but for the moment 'we felt rather humiliated than impressed,' for it seemed as though we had embarked, ori a fool's errandj ? and that'Sarii^who, by the -way, appeared; dreadfully pleepy — would have the laughing side of us.'.
