SHOULD WE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS P It is difficult to determine whether the ' onirht' of your query implies an ethical or a scientific obligation : and I am afraid the one as little admits of a final answer as the other. The present writer remembers a lady interpolating in tbe midst of a disonssion on the snbjeot of ghosts the following highly original objection : — ' Oh ! bnt the Bible says there may'nt be ghosts!' This, of course, was beside the mark, even though the lady was prepared to quote chapter and yerse— whioh I doubt. And some one, I remember, immediately hoisted her on her own petard with the oitation of the Witch of Endor evoking the spirit of Samuel from the bowels of the earth. There seems nothing in the existence of ghosts actually at variance with current religious notions. To concede their existence is to postulate im mortality or. at any rate, aperiod of life of Borne sort after death. Though,, on the other hand, it is possible to hold with the Bishop of St. Asaph in his opinion that ' such means were unworthy of the Deity to employ' — ' such means ' referring to the referring to the ohildish, capricious, aimless and knavish tricks whioh characterise the recorded aotions of the majority of ghosts, proving them to be possessed of a far lower intelligence than our own. The claimB ot Soienee are no less difficult to determine. If we accept unconditionally tho enoimons accumulation of evidence and observation, we are bound to believe that ghosts exist. On the other hand, none of onr senses is infallible : things are not always what they seem : and there is a vast difference between untrained observation and the soientifio observation of phenomena (though it 'is generally impossible to analyse the char acter of ordinary observation with 8ny approach to finality).
