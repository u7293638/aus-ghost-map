§0dr?. . BETWEEN' JOT AND SORROW. Bbtwben joy and sorrow, Ao 'twixt day nnd morrow, I lay for ftBpnoo ; ; . And I heard, ao lying, ' . My old Grief sighing, ?« From hor far-off placo. ? . ? ,1 said, ' Thou art over; *? And where drrams hover ? ,-s . Thou hovorcst now j In tho land of tliy dwelling What wators are wolling, ( i . And blossoms what bough ? , / i Old tears aro its rivors, i . Tho 'wind that thoro qiuvors . ' i v . Is breath. of old sigha ; . i Wreck-strewn uvo, the shores thero, i Andjsimset endures flwro , ?? ' Through inliuito skies. : . ' * . i Bat all thero is quiot ; Thero no -wave makea riot' Ou tho -waif-cumbered coasts, . J Whero thou movest banished, But not quite vanished — A ghost among ghosts.' — Philip ilourkc Marston in iho Athcnceum.
