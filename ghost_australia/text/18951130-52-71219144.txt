A Glimpse of Charles Dickons. When Charles Dickens lived in Tavistock House he developed a mania foi- walking long, distances,: which almost assumed the vform of-a "disease. He suffered from lum bago, and I have always thought, writes Mr. Hollingshead, that this was.brought on by monotonous pedestrianism--the deter mination to do a certain distance every day, generally from 2 in the' afternoon to 7 in the evening, one. mile every, quarter of an hour, measured by^.the milestones. . He did his literary work mostly in- the morn ing, from 9 till'about' 2, and usually wrote his letters at night. When he was restless, his brain excited by struggling" with in cidents or characters in the novel he was writing, he would frequently get up and walk through the night over Waterloo Bridge, along the London, New Kent, and Old Kent roads, past all the towns on the old Dover High-road, until he came to his roadside dwelling. His dogs barked when they heard his key-in the wicket-gate, and his behavior must have seemed madness to the ghost of Sir John Falstaff.
