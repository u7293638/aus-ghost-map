The Bogan. [PBOH A COBBESPOKDENT.] This oat (July Sth) four months it began to rain here; ever since we have been more or less subject to floods. The Bogan is now falling, and will X dare say be erasable for teams in the course of a few days. The -jrater is fast drying up on the plains, aa from their very level nature the water cannot drain off, a&d;^miut iBher evaporate or absorb. Whit a country' for a railway 1 At 'Buddabuddah' (oh, what a name ! it took two of us to spell it) the new public-house is pro gressing very slowly, and uistead ot oeing opened on the first, as was intended, the foundation and posts are only to be seen. All was flooded. There was only one dry spot on the Bogan that I know of, and that was near Byan's house, although the house itself was nearly covered. Mr. Balf e had to quit his house, although he thought (poor man!) that he had it built oat of the reach of floods. At Ihtndaloo, Mr. Martell had to fly in the dead of night to the sand ridges, and all his stores and furniture were more or less injured. Some of the most valuable furniture was raised ou benches ; but, how ever, the water did not remain long so high, as it began to solmde after the second day. Our mailman is seriously ill, I believe, from being so long exposed to the wet. The continual wet-ood boggy state of the country has left the cattle and sheep in a 'very low condition. StSl Mr. Browp': lambing at Mulla Molls is progressing very favourably. Mr. John M'Nevin's sheep on the Myall Cowell are doing very well, being high and dry. The report so falsely raised of that enterprising gentle man's death by drowning its, I am happy to say, most flatly contradicted by him putting in anything but a ghost-like appearance at Cardington. Tbe squatters are once more busy, and drafting and branding goes on even on the Sabbath, as if a flood or any other visitation of Providence never visited the Bogan. July Sth.
