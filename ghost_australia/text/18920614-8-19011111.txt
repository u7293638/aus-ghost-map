Honest Ghost. I A ghost story, of the only authentic sort, comes from England, and is related by Wilbert Beale, in his "Light of Other Days/' A young man, Mr. A., one night left London to take a trip into the north of England, and had for a companion in the railway carriage but one man, a stranger. Mr. A., addressed some remark to his fellow traveller in starting, bnt the maa took no notice of it, and began to read a newspaper with great dili- gence. Presently Mr. A. went to sleep, and on awaking, after an hour's nap, found the carriage empty. No station had been passed, and yet his fellow-passenger had vanished. He was puzzled, and believed himself to have been the victim of an apparition or a dream. Twelve months passed, and again the two trav- ellers met, under precisely the same oircnmstances. Mr. A. resolved that this time the mystery should be solved. But he had had a hard day's work, and in spite of himself, fell fast asleep. When ho awoke, it was to find that his companion had mysteriously vanished. He now began to suspect that this second illusion might forebode some disaster, and joined his friends with a heavy heart. His sister, noticing his depression, urged him to accompany her to some neighbourhood merry-making. He consented, but on entering the hall, started violently. " There ! there it is again !" he exclaimed, with a terrified look. " What do you mean ?" whispered Mb sister in alarm. " The phantom !" he gasped, pointing to an ad- vancing figure. .' I have Been it twice, in my jour- neys up here, and each time it vanished into air." " How absurd !" said shs, relieved. " That is the owner of the Harold Park. The railway runs through his estate, and he has a private station, at which the train stops whenever it is signalled. He is deaf and dumb.
