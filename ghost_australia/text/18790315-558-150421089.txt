A GHOST STORY. The following strange affair is' reported from MacDonnell Bay in the South Eastern Star of March 7th:â€”"An extraordinary supernatural occurrence which is said to have taken place on the coast between here and Kivoli Bay is creating a ' great sensation here. Walter and William Carrisonhavebeeri at work for some little time obtaining oil from the whale which was stranded on the beach. The other day they were out shoot ing in the vicinity, and did not return to their tent till after nightfall. Just at the twilight William Carrison was loading his gun for a last shot, when all at once he heard a hideous yell, and turning his eyes in the direction from whence the sound proceeded, he observed what appeared to be a man of rather unusually tall stature making towards him. Carrison looked with a fixed gaze at the object, and it appeared so weird and un earthly that his blood began to chill and his hair to bristle. On it came, and a3 it ap proached yelled again. Carrison then put a cap on his gun, and taking aim, fired at the j object, which appeared to sink into the ground out of sight and left no trace behind. I At the same instant Walter Carrison, who was about a mile from his brother, saw a similar apparition, and, having his gun loaded and capped at the time, fired. That object, too, appeared to have felt the Ehot, and melted into thin air.; The people here believe the ghost or ghosts are those of some person or persons who have been murdered near the spot where they were seen."
