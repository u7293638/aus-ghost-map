"Toad, 'o"Wais a Womlder.' All early writers attribute wonderful qualities to toads and frogs and thil vi rious parts of their bodies. Piiny be=' lieved, for instance, that if a todci was brought into the midst of -uniobor other large and umnlmy conconurs of .people "silence wnould instant?y preail' " A small bone found in the right side of toads "of the proper age"' v-s also be lieved to have powers over the various elements. "By throwing this bone into a vessel of boiling water." says PIiny. "it will imnmediately cool it, thle water refuesing to boil again until the bone has been removed. To find this bone, ex pose the dead load on an ant hill. When the ants liave eaten her all away except the bones, take each bone separately and drop it into boiling water. Thus maythe wondrous to:u ihon be discovered." This antiboil bone of course had its op posite. In another portion of his work Pliny says: "On the other hand, again, in the left side of this reptile there is another bone which when thrown into water has all the appearance of making it boil. The name given this bone is 'apocy lon,' which signifies -dog averting.' because it has the power and propertyof assuaging the fury of the fiiercest dogs.' It wa! also a sovereign remedy for love 'and other trouble, would conciliate es-. tranged friends, and if water in whicih a "toad bone" had been steeped be-used mixed withlumb's tallow as anointmen[ "the person using. the same might with i out the least effort see ghosts and divers spirits both ..by the -day arid by the night."-St. Louis itepub?lis,
