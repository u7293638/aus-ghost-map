A SHADOWY STORY. A TALE OF THE IRISH REBELLION OF '98 (From Chambers' Journal.) CHAPTER V. Miss Decroy turned as pale as death; as did her sister; who sank into a seat, apparently overcome by the shock ; but Madame Decroy said in her firmest, nay sternest tones: 'Search, sir! I ask no immunity for my house. I wait the day when it shall be given to the flames, as have been so many houses in which their owners dared to find shelter. Your chiefs have been patient longer than I expected.' Kate turned her pale face and scared eyes appealingly to her mother, as if to remind her how unwise it was to irri- tate a soldier; but the look was un- heeded. Merely bowing in answer to Madame Decroy's remarks, Westbury addressed himself to the sisters and hurriedly explained what he proposed to do. On the information he had received he was compelled to search the House; he had no alternative; but he wished to do so with as little incon- venience as possible. The House was broad and deep ; it stood upon a large square of ground; but it was not lofty, nor had it many apartments above. Nor were there any underground kitchens or cellars: Westbury said he would go up with no one but the sergeant to examine the rooms, and that upon their return his men should go into the rooms and offices beyond the hall. No assent was given, but no objection was made to this plan, which was forthwith carried out. The two malitia-men again 'stood at ease' at the door, so that the front of the House was efficiently guarded ; and as has pre- viously been explained, the sides and rear were also under surveillance. All was silent and dark above. Not only was there no one to be discovered but there were no signs of any one having recently been there; no chair was out of place, no bed disordered, as would have been the case had any fugitive been disturbed from his easily broken slumbers. In fact, Dickles spoke for both when he said: 'I don't believe there's no one here, sir.' Relieved more than he cared to show, Westbury descended, the men rousing themselves when he appeared, as though they felt that now indeed they should be wanted. 'You will take the men with you, Dickles,' said the officer, 'and go over the rooms at the back. - Shut the door, men.' The door was closed, and the men came forward.. .Now, the great stair case spoken of sprung from one side of the hall, and at its foot a passage ran straight to the back of the house; but half-way a strong door shut off the rear of the premises, and this door, either from habit in the troublous times, or for the more prosaic reason of its keeping out the draught, was always kept shut. Of course it was now open; and the sergeant, still bearing the light, led the way closely followed by the soldiers. As the last man passed the door, Westbury advanced to close it. The great lamp which swung and flared in the hall, threw its glare upon the staircase, and upon the door, as Westbury swung it to. 'He pushed it close, but as he did so, recoiled with an exclamation of momentary surprise and alarm for the shadow of a man, huge and distorted, as shadows often are, fell upon the door just in front of him. It was gone in an instant. For another instant the Lieutenant, re- covering himself, thought the startling shade was his own; but at once he knew it to be impossible, and glanced swiftly round. The group was still at the. stair foot, and as Westbury turned his face, with a now stern expression upon it, he could not help seeing a wild look, a look of consternation on each of the faces which met his own. Again was the bue of Miss Kate's cheeks pale to ghastliness; and as the officer threw a rapid glance around the hall, their eyes followed. He approached the ladies. ' You will remember that I have not yet searched the dining room' he said, (This was on the side of the hall oppo- site to his little sitting-room) 'I must do this. You can see that I have no choice.' Madame Decroy bowed without speaking, then moving forward, herself threw wide open the door of the chamber. There was a light burning there, but the room was empty. No living thing was to be seen or heard within it. After a brief but close search, Westbury came into the hall baffled and not a little disconcerted - the women eagerly watching his every movement. Presently, upon hearing the return- ing steps of his men, he glanced upon the broad stairs, as if hesitating whether again to ascend them or not. In fact, he was upon the point of doing so when a short gasping exclamation startled him, and he saw Miss Decroy reel as though about to fall. She hadi fainted; and Westbury, springing towards her, caught her in his arms, just as Dickle's and his satellites re- entered the hall to report that all was quiet at the back of the house. This incident led to confusion for a time. Westhlury carried the insensible girl to the dining room, an act which enlisted the sympathies of Madame Decroy and "Mrs aClaridge ithi shehet"Hlls16VnTd fain h nelingoredi?lnugoswetristhem,' but duty comip.llriy hini to witridrawI for the purp.osof iliiaisning the men, ficjlei liti i ciltoiik Hi Mii conictioit that O'Flynn,wm asa as ad a Mllany, and that~ SquiriI Decroy had not bean within a day's, march of Boreen for a .month past; and that in point of fact h must h"bo in I "rance as'onery one lhsd a the outr door swung after his subordinat, Westbury, turned- and hmoved i reoltely to?iards liis, sitting rom tho;nlancing across the hall, nuolaehiu g that fhn? ooirof the dlimog room was opeon, ,?he'iustered up .sui; eip courage,, to 'inquire after Miss ecrojy: He found her sufficiently re covered to.sit up.
