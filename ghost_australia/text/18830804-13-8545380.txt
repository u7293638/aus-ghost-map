Mil. JUSTICE HIGINBOTIIAM ON SCIENCE AND REUQION. Br AM KCLEOTIO. It waa to many of us a matter of great in- terest when wo were informed that Mr.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8545380/266268# Justice Higinbothom had undertaken to dehicr a lecture on the relations of modem science with tlio Chnstian churches We Knew well that wc should have a discourse "hloU_whatcYer it might bo in other Kesnccts-would bear the" impress of n free, iaiwindividuolitj, and the stamp of a strong mid lofty character Speaking for myself, 1 may say that I looked on to the address with fur more interest as a rev elation of a hitherto little known side of a remarkable man, than as n contribution to the phdosophy of the subject abo subject is ono on which it is so diflicult to sa) much that is pro- fitable, BO cosy to say much that is very unprofitable. We have-many of us-rcud whole shelves of literature on this subject during the last few years, and but few of us think that wc have derived much tow arila the clarifying of our thought, the settlement of our difficulties, the dmen tangling of our perplexities, out of itali I wus not sanguino enough to hope to gain much in tina direction from the discourse of Mr Justice Higinbotham, To mo tho most mtcrcsting clement in that discourse was not the subject, but the speaker Tho highest mi.! most interesting study of mankind is not science, or religion, or their relations to e ich other- matters in regard to which it is ias\ to lose nil ]>oints of reckoning, and to drift into intellectual chaos-it is man, ond tins becomes doubly interesting when tho saumon studied is ono possessing such du erst y its und stich a naif facult) of self inelution as Mr Higinbotham And it Bi i ms to me that w c could not receive a more ititi resting pieturo of a large, strong mind, in full and i nergetic nctiv ity, trying to grapple ii subject which ever eludes ita grasp, exlnbit in all the. might and skill of a trained (.l.lmtor inn struggle with a phantom, than mis illoideil to the mental vision by nn utteiitite perusal of that discourse I est any reader should think that I unduly ikjiK cuite the substantial value of Mr Iligin h ith nu s lecture us a guide to tho lntcllec tu ill) perplexed, let me bneflj recapitulate \t lint sei m to nu its essential points Nothing, Iioinciic.iouldbc more impressive than the pi. tun dniY.li bj the speaker of the present pisitton of the churches towards the activo thought of the da) The churches are, ac couling to this description, lights which have ce ist ti to enlighten, guidcB which no longer pwle, teachers who find few listeners and no dis ipili He "takes it to be certainly truo that tin intellects of the great majority of elaiatedand thinking la) men at this dnj ho ti hull) outside the influence o£ the ni tcllcctunl teaching of the Christian clergy " As lor the elerg), they "display more and mure unwillingness el cn to allude in their ii.Micssis to the luity to the intellectual li isis of religious truth and of moral obh fcition Where the) exhibit any conscious puqiose at all, they seem to aim at resolving n )i"ion into a mutter of sentiment decorated b) ort All this " waning influenco " of the c1, rjj has not come from any moral defect t n ihcir jiart, or from any want of _eal and atlitit) Laymen on their aide exhibit a tn it mil trotting interest in the discussion of the hiLliestand largest questions of morals »ntl lehgion And )ct, between the two there H au ever deepening, e\er widening chasm ' J lie cliuos of creeds and the babel of strong tongues in the Christian churches leave us," said the lecturer, " ignorant and untaught," muí his audience at the Scots' Church M arm!) applauded the assertion There is in fettend forms "irreconcilable variance lancen inotlern science nnd the doctrine of the ( hristinn churches " The churches still ntttmpt "pertinaciously to force upon tho eli r") and the laity, dogmas winch, as Borne of jim, 1 doubt not, know from bitter per suiiul ixpcrience, are revolting and odiouB to the natural conscience and to the under- standing of man, ' and ugmn the audience i xjircssed by cheers their agreement with tho speaker All tliishiiscoraettboutfromthefuct tlut (lie churches have id ways "been the most il.in^erousandmsidiousenemiesofthereligion olUmsfc' As a remedy for all this, inasmuch ns it i. hopeless to look for reform from the churches, it is necessary for laymen to take mutters into their own hands, and to " com- bine to cast out from their ow n minds and from tlio Uins-iim churches the spectres of . lil an 1 nott discredited fallacies " Were thnt iltrac tie should have "God revealed anew to the intellect, and also to the responsive huiinn lu art, as the Eather, the Friend, tin I uik, und the Support of our race, and ufttpi) number of it, m the simple but

'Hie polemic against the churches Masnlini piece of oratory, full of the forco ami tlie lire and the vii vivida of Mr Higln I utlmn in the da) a when his oratory was a .1 iiiiiiuiit jKnter in our community The j it (ure of the perplexities of modern thought h turen, ou one side, the aggressive, growing n "lit of scientific philosophy to which it shrink, from toiumittmg itself, and the m llui

profoundly pathetic It »us full of deep human feeling, and was nu mlctjuate exjircssion of the forlorn desolation m ti Inch the intellect of the time finds itself wandering, astray, estranged, despondent, but resolute- whatever comes-not to return to its starting point But if we look at it not as oratory, but as thought and phdosophy and what other mental phase is there from Hinch weean to any purpose discuss the re lotions of science and religion save that of philosophy, «bat other arbitrator is there which we tun call in?-then I think that it 1\. wholly deficient in the " light and leading" winch us the speaker admitted, is our real want nt the present time Hie root of the whole evil, Mr Bjgin hotham tells us, is in the churches 'lins úia_iio_is has a tendency to remind the rutiler of the)outhful ethical philosophy of tSbelley in Queen Mab, where he triumphantly wiled the problem of tho existence of evil la uscnbiug it to langs and priests The churches, but what aro tho churches, and »hat are the "hostile creeds" which share it ith the churches the blame for what has occurred? What nro they all but mere ex ptessions of the mind of man brought face to face with tho riddle of existence' Mr II iginbotlinm exonerates the laity from blame, he even presses lightly on tho clergy, but on the churches" he pours without measure the vials of Ins wrath But what are the churches after the clergy and the laity are eliminated. Mr Higmbotham thinks that beneficial consequences would result if the compulsory subscription by tho clergy "of »I creeds, articles, and standards" were abolished 1'erhapa it might But surely ino old questions would remain, though we ?UKI suppressed the guesses offered as answers to them What drove men to reli »on was not the need of discovering a rule °t life It was the craving instinct which «ought answers to the problems suggested by a fearful sense of mystery m an inexplicable »ona YVould not this continue to haunt ttcmuiilof mankind, though all the churches °i Christendom and elsewhere had concurred "i declaring that the questions admitted of no answer, and that it was folly to demand Coleridge, m a passage in which he dis caaes the attempt of the most richly gifted «English b,shops to solve the im story of sin, oDsenes -'"lins most eloquent treatise may ue compared to a statue of Janus, with the one lace, which we must suppose fronting the Ulvinistie tenet, entire and fresh, as from «le master s hand, beaming with life and onT ,Wl"yscom°n the bp, and a brow at once bright and weighty with Batisfying ïr*! ,°th«> looking toward thS something to be put m ita place,' maimed, tçatureless, and weather beaten into an! «moat vuionury confusion and indistinct- ly I .

But when ive turn to consider the remedy ho proposes, we can hardly escape a sense of the absurd in MOW of its strange inadequacy and impracticabilitj Surely the union which he suggcstB, of clergy and lny mon, willing to discard creeds and nrticles, and to accept the central religious principles of Christianity as he formulates them, would but form one church the more, und ndd another to tlie "hostile creeds already in existence What would its creedlessncss be but a creed in another shapu * ï he proposal is only intelligible Bave on the assumption which it seems to involve, that every really reasonable and sincere person would at once accept the new faith and join the now church But this assumption is entertained by tho foundci ot every new church und the promulgator of every new faith Weean, many of us, remember the insnrmount able difficulty which Mr Higinbotham used to experience m ti) ing to under stand how any man could fail in poll tical matters, to take the same view us he took. He seems to havo the sumo difficulty m the sphere of theolog) Cardmnl Novvman, once reasoning with a similar frame of mind, observed-" Bo large minded enough to believe that men may reason and feel very differently from yourselves How is it that men, when left to themselves, fall into such various forms of ichgion, except that thero aro various types of mind among them, very distinct from each other î 1 ancy the Bad smile with which tho great subtle minded Oratormn would listen to Mr Higinbotham s rough and ready but somewhat crude proposal for the extinguishing of all religious difler cnees, and for harmonising religion with science by putting down churches and nbo fishing creeds Merging Ins personality in the existenco of Ina antique historic church, mid speaking m her name, ho might, like the l'ope s Legato in Browning s Souls Irayedy, who had "seen twent) four leaders ot re volts, calmly Bil), "I have seen mnny founders of now churches before to day To w horn could Mr nigmbothum go more confidently for support in his scheme for getting nil of all theoloaical difficulties than to other men sharing his stiong religious feeling, conscious of the same confusion, and desirous of finding a remedy ' Surel) nmont them, if anywhere, the new church which is to be no church, with its creed which is no creed, would find sympathy and perhaps disciples or cv en apostles Let us suppose that he carried Ins scheme to Mr Matthew Arnold Ihat able thinker, the delicacy and refinement of whoso intellectual processes contrast so strikingly with the straight blunt methods of Mr Higinbotham, has also con tended that w e must reconsider our religious beliefs, and unhesitatingly cast away all which cannot bo verified And in the attempt to corr) out this principle, which is at any rate a, scientific, not ii merely arbitrary one, as Mr Ilitmbothams seems to be, he linds it necessary to cost overboard a good deal which Mr Higinbotham says we could keep After testing one by one tho articles of religious faith, and rejcclmg nil that would not stand the ordeal, Mr Arnold finds only one left lhnt is a great and pregnant one-it ia, he holds, sufficient for all the moral and intellectual guidance of life It is, as ho formulates it, the principle that thero is in tho government of the world a power which makes far righteousness 'Ibis is a religious creed reduced to its lowest terras Many would regard it as but the ghost of a departed creed But how would Mr Higinbotham and Mr Arnold settle their outstanding differences ( Would tbey not represent two hostile churches, two warring creeds, and would not the whole vast problem, with all its attendant difiicul ties and perplexities, exist between those two nearly related thinkers m as ample mea sure as it does now m the world at large ' How wholly Mr Higinbotham has studied his subject from the inside rather than the outside is shown by tho cireumstanco that he seems never to have asked himself how it is that wo have such a multiplicity of opinions on religious matters as compared with other objects of inquiry lind he dono so, surely he would have seen the answer to bo that this condition is inherent in the nature of a subject l)ing in the twilight region between the known and the unknovi n, a retion in which shadow is mistaken for substance, and Bubstanco for shadow, and which presents a different aspect to thooe of overy v isitor Had be calmly asked him self how it is that these differences of opinion not only characterise the " churches, but are exhibited m all thinking free souls who devote themselves the attempt to read the insoluble riddle ot life, ho would probabl) have seen reason to doubt the eflicney of his short and easy modo of reconciliation Had ho asked how it is that where such earnest seekers after truth as Mr Matthew Arnold, the late Mr W It. Greg, Canon Tnrrar, tho late Mr Maurice, our own Mr Charles Strong and Mr Higinbotham himself-but why should wo not extend the list, and include the late Mr Mill, Dr 'Ijndall, and Mr Huxley, and even a high souled Mussulman like, sa), Abd el Kader, or a great religious reformer like the Hindoo teacher KeshubChunder Sen î -eachhaslnsown answer, more or less nnper feet, he would have seen how hopeless it would be to acquiesce in the impromptu creed which he öfters them as sufficient for all practical purposes W hat, indeed, have practical purposes to do with this matter' Iho practical ends of life aro seen to be secured under all creeds, they ure seen to be Bccurcd without any creed at all On the other hand, what is tho ground for this demand for an unattainable unifornut) of belief? Experience has shown that m reh gious matters uniformity has been the con comitant of stagnation and apathy, and that earnest independent activity of thought has alvvajs brought tho diversity of result which so shocks the mind and vexes the soul of our brilliant lecturer I come back to my Blurting point I have, with great interest and s)mpathy, studied a strong confident mind grappling resolutely with a world wide, world deep problem Mi Higinbotham, viewing the matter rather as politician than as philosopher, and looking down on religion and BCience from the elevated standpoint of a practical reformer, suggests a ready way of sinking all their differences by drafting a sudden creed, which only has to bo accepted to composo all disputes and reconcile all dissensions Iho spectacle illustrates at once the com prehensiveness and the limitations, the strength and the weakness of the lecturer, and certainly does not lessen our respect for his intellectual power or his moral weight aud earnestness But it throws no new light on the subject, supplies no guidance, suggests no remedy, save ono winch breaks doun in the stating, but only presents tho problem, and leaves us with it face to face as wo were before
