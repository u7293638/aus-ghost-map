THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN AT WACGA WAGCA. [By Onb of Tubu.J Wackia Waokja, 9th March. Wo loft Sydney by tho 9.45 traiu on tho morn ing of tho 6th instant, and though it was our laat look at tbo city, for somo months honco at anyrato, only fivo gontlomon wore preaont to witness our departuro, and tboir number did not inclado a 'solitary crickotor of Now South Wales, or a ropreaontauve or mo Association, dub mm is not in tbo least surprising, for thoy bavo shown us tho cold shoulder from tho start. Lato ia tho evoning wo reached tho railway torminas at Coolamundra, and stoppod thoro for tho night. But wo might just as well have procoodod on oar journey, for wo couldn't got asparo room in any of tho hotels, and had to carap on tho floor, or any spot wo could find. What with roughing it in this mannor, and tho worrying wo roooived from flics und insoots of all sorts, wo bad quito a livoly tirao of it, and woro vory glad whon daylight appoarcd, and tho coaoh oamo round for ub. About two hours aftor leaving Oootamundra, a place which wo wero not sorry to loso sight of, tbo rain began to fall In torrents, and kept up until wo arrived hero about duak. Thoso of ub who had outsido aoata woro wot to tho ttkiu long boforo tbo lournov had ended, and when the coaoh drow up in front of tho Criterion Holol; whoro wo aro atoppiug, tbo appearance of tho Elovon altogethoi' was nut calculated to imbuo an onlooker with a favorablo improehion. A good Bbowor bafcli,bowovor, with a sound, rubbingdown, noon sot Ibo droncheu ouoa right, and wo all folt in p,ood fottlo for tho innlob, wbioh conimonood yostorday.on tlio Wagga racocourso, which iB«ald to bo ono of tbo bent in tho colonial. ' A wiokot was nrovidod by outtlnjr away tlio frrais and lovolling tho baro earth with a heavy rollur, nnd it playod fairly all through, Tho captain of the twenty- two, Mr. Orokor, won tlio tosla fromUrcRory, audoloo'od to bftt,tl)ofirttro|ironontalivoflof Wagga to aniioar boinu MoHsrH. lllakonoy aud Jusopb, to ? tho bowling of Allan aud Uurrott.

Grogory ?ma ncxti and tho Tasmaniaa commenced the partnership by hitting Tompson splendidly to tho off for i. Tho bowlera 'werej -well on tho spot after ithat hit, and tho iuns^amo in singles -only! fox Homo time. ?

Gregory now kadGarmtt.ua a partnor, and wLontimowaa called tiioy. wore still thoro, tho captain having 86 to hianamo and Garrott 20. Ob resuming to day Gregory waB caught off the first ball ho ro ceivod irbrn Tompaon, and the register was 5—30-^98. Murdoch and Garrott made a lengthened stay, and caused any amount of changes dnthoi,bowling, bat a separation could aot bo -tiffffCted until Garrett became quite reek* less, lotting out at everything, aud at last his doom was .sealed, Douglas catching him at for ward caver off Harris.. Garrett played brilliantly tor his score of 73, bat he gave three or four easy : chances. C— 73— 202. Blackham succeeded, and Jut the first ball for ft brace. Murdoch here* aboutfl hit Troy to sqnaro-leg twice fox 5 in one over, which caused tho captain to bring on a new bowler, -whom Murdoch also slated to squaro-leg for 5 shortly afterwards. Blackham's time had Dow come, Crokor holding him easily at point, and. tho Victorian keopor of the sticks retired for a merry innings of 14. 7—14—253. Boylohad 'only tune to look about him when Murdoch vas bowled off bis pad by Nelson for a grand innings of 93k' made without tho ghost of a chance. 8— 93-^260. Allan was caught off the first ball in endeavoring to save his head, and tho innings was ovor for 260, Boyle carrying out hia bat for 2. Kendall twisted his neck and could, tot bat. Tompson is a very fair left banded bowler, with an easy roundhand de livery, and he varies his pace a good' deal. Douglas bowls fast over-arm, but, though ' very straight, was hot particularly effective. The fielding of the twenty, t wo was pretty fair. She twenty-two in thoir second innings made 71 against tbo bowling ofBoyle and Blackham (slow underarm). Thorno played good cricket for 15, asf. -did Willans for'; 10, but none of the others' troubled the scores much. Boyle got eleven wickets for, 26, and Blackham, whd seems to be developing great all-round ability, .- secured nine for 39. Murdoch kept wicket well, and the fielding of the Eleven was good at every point. The weather was dull on the morning ?f the first day, but in tho .afternoon the nun shone; pleasantly, the heat being tempered fey a -contle wind, and the second day was really delightful. Daring the two days about lGOO-pcraons, inclufling a good muster of Ijdiosj visited the ground, and they appeared to enjoy the discomfiture or their representatives considerably. To-night Mr. Fitzhardinge pro eented Murdoch with, a neat trophy for obtain ing tho highest score in- tho match, and, in, doing so took, occasion to allude to the great cricketing treat that had been afforded to the lovers of the game in Wagga, and Irnsted that thej?layers would take a lesson and profit therefrom. ! Mr. Croker proposed tho health of .the J21evon in [a few well-chosen words, and Captain Gregory appropriately Tesponded. After Mr. Conway had proposed the toast of tho Swentytvro.andMr.Orokorhadreaponded, several songs were sung, and the evening's entertainment wound up in a yeryjolly fashion; i Wo have met ?With a splendid reception from the residents of Wagga, and jhalLal ways have a good word to say for: that prosperous and historic town.
