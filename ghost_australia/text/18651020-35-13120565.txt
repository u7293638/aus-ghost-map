THE ATLANTIC CABLE DR RUSSELL'S DIARY {From the Times, August 19.) As our readers are aware, an earth cable on Mr. Varley's plan was laid from the telegraph station at Feilhummerum, on Friday, the 21st of July and on Saturday, the 22nd of July, the thick shore end of the Atlantic cable was carried ashore from the Caroline over a bridge formed of twenty-five fishing yawls of the district. The Caroline, veering out the cable in the track buoyed out by Lieutenant White, in charge of the Coastguard of Valentia, dropped the end twenty-six miles W.N.W, of Valentia, at 10.30, and stood by the buoy all night. A despatch was sent to the Great Eastern in Berehaven. Although it was near midnight when the message was received, the Great Eastern got up steam and anchor with such diligence that her arrival, attended by her Majesty's ships Terrible and Sphinx, was signalled off Valentia harbour at 7.45 next morning. The weather was most favourable. The end of the main cable was next passed on board the Caroline from the Great Eastern. The terminus of the shore end was also hauled up und got on board with the assistance of boats of the men-of-war, and the operator of the company began the splice, which was subsequently subjected to rigid tests tor some hours by the telegraphic staff, and found to be satisfac- tory. It was also ascertained that the insulation of the shore end had been greatly improved by its im- mersion in the water. The Hawk left Valentia harbour soon after 10 a.m., and came up with this flotilla about 1 o'clock. At 4.50 p.m. the testing of the splice was finished, and the Great Eastern got in readiness for her course to the west. As she steamed slowly ahead, cheer after cheer were exchanged between her and the Terrible and Sphinx, and at 7.16 p.m., the first fathom of the cable glided slowly over the stern and sunk into the depths of the ocean. The paying out machinery worked with the utmost ease and regularity, and after a while the speed of the vessel was increased from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2, and ultimately to 6 1/2 miles an hour. At 10.47 p.m., Greenwich time, 50 miles of cable had been paid out and up to midnight the paying out proceeded without impediment, in calm weather, with favouring wind and sea. Monday, July 24. ---At 3 o'clock a.m., when eighty four miles of cable had been paid out, the electrician engaged in signaling to the shore per- ceived an aberration of the index light, which showed some singular cause of disturbance in the current. After testing the cable tor some time by signals to and from the land, it became apparent that there was 'a fault, as it is technically termed. The paying out was discontinued, and the efforts of the staff of elec- tricians were directed to the discovery of the place where the fault had occurred. It was finally resolved by Mr Canning to cut the cable, having first secured it to hawsers made fast to the bow, and then to take it in till the fault was discovered. It was cut at 9.50 a.m. The strain varied from 22 cwt. to 36 cwt., and when the machine began to work the utmost care and nicety were needed to prevent the cable being sub- jected to injury as the ship rose and fell in the sea over the 400 fathoms of iron and copper wire which hung from its bow to the bottom. Mr Saunders, one of the staff of electricians, arrived at the conviction that the injury was not more than ten to eleven miles away. In the evening Mr Canning sent a message to Mr Glass, the managing director at Valentia, to dispatch the Hawk to the Great Easter.n The work of picking up the cable was continued very cautiously and slowly during the night. At midnight six miles of cable had been hauled in, and the fault was still overboard. Tuesday, July 25. ---At an early hour in the morning the Hawk was observed coming up from the eastward, and at 9.15 Greenwich time 9 1/2 miles of cubic cable had been recovered from the deep. At 9.45 a.m., when a little more than ten miles of cable had been picked up, to the great joy of the ship, the fault came on board. The cause of all our trouble, anxiety, and delay, was a piece of iron about two inches long, rather crooked and sharp at the end, as if cut off with a nipper from an end of wire, which had been forced right through the coating of the cable and the gutta percha till it came in contact with the wire. Preparations for making a splice were at once commenced on deck. The splicings and jointings took some time to make and test, and meantime the Hawk returned to Valentia. At length the Great Eastern put her head to the west, and the cable, at 2.50 p.m , once more ran over her stern with satisfactory indications that insulation and communication were perfect. At three o clock, when somewhat more than 1 1/2 mile of cable had dropped slowly over, the shore end became mute, to the consternation of the opera- tors. At 3.15 p.m. the cable between the tanks was again cut and an examination was made of the end of the various wires to ascertain whether there might not be some mistake in the communica- tions. Once more preparations were made to transfer the end of the cable from the stern to the bow. But while the aching eyes of wearied and worn watchers were straining through the darkness of the little chamber in which was the apparatus, the faint light which had so long vanished from the index began to steal like a ghost across its prescribed track. All our fears are groundless. The signals increased in strength. The exchange of currents between ship and shore become strong and regular, as if they were only a few miles apart. The ship proceeds on her course through the night at the rate of 6 to 6 1/2 knots an hour till after midnight, when the wind and sea rose a little, and it was considered prudent to diminish the speed to five knots an hour. Our position at noon, latitude 51.58 N, longitude 12.11 W; distance from Valentia, 68 1/2 miles; cable paid out, 74 1/2 miles. Wednesday, July 26. ---During all last night the cable was paid out uninterruptedly, and at 8 a.m. the good ship was 150 miles from Valentia. The loss of cable paid out was 7.68 miles per 100, making a total distance of cable laid of 161 1/2 miles, including shore end. The morning was hazy, and the wind from the N.W., with rising sea. At noon our course was W.N.W. 3/4W., with the wind strong on the port bow, thick all round with drizzling mist. Our position was latitude 52.18 N., longitude 15.10 W.; our distance from Valentia 180 miles; length of cable paid out just 192 miles. As the cable was paid out in deep water, the insulation improved, and the transmission of signals to and from the shore which went on inces- santly as usual gave most excellent indications. Thursday, July 27. ---In the night the wind came round a little. The ship's course was N.W. by W. and 1/2 W. At 8.30 a.m the total distance run was 302 miles; from the last splice, 235 miles, showing in average speed of 5.87 miles an hour of cable paid out, total loss of cable in direction from straight line 9.32 per cent., on the whole distance, 8.3 per cent Hie cable continued to run with the most perfect regularity m a depth of 2000 fathoms, striking the water at a dis tance of 213 feet from the stein At noon the result of observations giv e the ship s position latitude 52 3 Í "V longitude 19 1 W dist ince run since yesterday 142 miles whole dibtance horn A alcntia d20 miles ïridaj, July 28 - VII during the night the woik went on smoothl), the msnlatiou increasing Course, N W i A\ , wind, "\\\ N "\\\\.

such circumstances, and at 6 p m it was calcu Jated we had run ¿0 miles At that hour the ship's couise was altered so as to let her bear down on the buoy and she steered nearly NMi towards the 1 embie which was in sight, lying to bo as to give rise to the hope that she w^s banting as near bur missing sea mark as was prudent At noon our posi tion was latitude 52 29 30, longitude 39 6 the i embie, m repl) to our signals, said she did not see íoonUvy'^but bi;lleved it to be SSL of her At 12 iu the Great Eastern was abreast of the lemble and altered her course to S Tjy E ] E , and both ships, with look out men in the tops, renewed their scrutiny of the heaving watos at some dis t nee apart Suddenly the much sought foL llig stnfi oi the buoy wab discovered frou the Graa. 3 tsteni At 140 pin the

gradually ran itself down lhe woik ot pro j nr ition went on busilj, and at night the decks were light el up with iorge lires and quivered under the blows ol sledges as antils rang and iron glowed for the work of to morrow Thursday , August 10 -Soon after dawn we came down on buoy No 1, whien guided us to buoy No 2, and tor some time both ol them were in sight from the deck At 10 30 am, Greenwich time, the grapnel touched the bottom, and the Great Eastern, with fore and aft canvas and topsails set, Blowly drifted and forged ahead for a point about a mile west of the last grapple The strom on the grapnel line varied from 40 cwt to 45 ewt , but at 11 am, ship's time, it mcrcascd to 50 cwt, and tho ship s head showed a disposition to come to the north Sail was eased, but she soon came away again, and proceeded to drift southwards and westwards Her head varied from W and by N toN W and by N , the buoy bearing SE At 1 p m the strain rose to 60 cwt, and the Great Eastern came three points to the north, but the check was momentary, and at 3 p m it was plain she had drifted over the spot and had failed to catch the cable The only thing to be done waa to take up the grapnel and renew the attempt to recover the cable next day All the afternoon and all the evening the anxious but monotonous labour of dragging in the grapnel taxed the energies of the engineers and cable men, but at midnight 1400 fathoms were safely coiled on board the ship Friday, August 11-The long struggle is ovei at last, or rather it is suspended No one accepts the result os a final and conclusive defeat But there are no means left of continuing the contest, and the passive resistance ol the enemy has for the moment tnumphed At 5 20 am the grapnel was hauled up on deck, and it was discovered that the chain to which the shank was attached had taken half a hitch round one of the flukes, so as to have prevented the instrument catch ing on the bottom It appeared from the length of wire rope covered with ooze that there was not more thon 1950 fathoms when it was down A giapnel with a shorter stock was selected for the next trial All the damaged tope was rejected and repaired, as far as the means at the disposal of Mr Canning per- mitted A lme consisting of 1600 Iathoms of wire rope, 220 fathoms of hemp rope, and 510 fathoms of Manila was prepared, and carefully examined, of which 1760 fathoms were pronounced good, the rest being rather lUBpieious Ino ship's head being W by S , and the buoy No 2 bearing E by N , about two miles, the grapnel was let Do at 1 56 p m , Greenwich time The wind being S W would dnft the GrcatEostern toN E , right across the cable, and lore and aft canvas was set to overcome the current lhe grapnel soon touched the bottom, as the new machinery enabled the men to paj out the rope at the rate of 50 fathoms in a muiute loi some time the ship drifted onwards, but at J 50 p m , ship's time, the strain on the lope rose to 00 ewt as it carne m over the bows,
