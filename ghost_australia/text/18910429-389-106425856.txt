IT is just twele'years sineO:I .ivas appointed to the commandof a Sub. altern's Guard at Fort IHoliry, bie' of theo outworks of the fortress of Gib. raltar. On a cold December night, a few weckSagftdr m. appointment, while lounging in miny armni.clhir, 1' was'sud denly alarmed by hearing a loud noise outside tihe door, and immediately aftcrwardls a soldior, fully accoutred;, burst into the room, gave an agonising shrielk, and fell senseless to the ground. I raised himn. An indolinable terror was depicted on every feature of his coun tenance, his eyes *rolled hideously in their blood.shot sockets; the right hand clutched with a powerful grasp ai loaded musklet, wvhilo thile left pointod at some invisible object in: the airm. I recognised him as the seitilill?wioni ~t had stationed in an archway leading from the cells in which some Guerril, las were confined on a cshargde: oft murder. ' Totally unprepared for such a scene( and entirely ignorant of its ciause, I naturally concluded that some dreadful catastrophe had happened, Are thorn Spaniards in the fort1 . Is there an in surrection among the peoplel 'Have the prisoners escaped These were the first thoughts that rushed through my excited brain. At length I per; ceived symptoms of returning consci ousness in thie man ; the dimness wliici' had overshaded his eyes gradually dis. appeared, his rigid hand slowly relaxed its tenacious hold, and then, oponilng his mouth he cried out: "The ghost I the ghost I I" Relieved from tile suspicious which had at first suggested itself to my mind, I put him under guard, and summon. ing tlid vwatch, marchod out lest the! prisaoers might escape during his absen??o.P,.ontrary to my antidilpations, the prisoners were still secure, so 'I left one of the men at the deserted post, .ad .as. leisurely walking back when~hnihilek of terror ourst froum tlihe' new sentinel. I turned quickly round, and saw him level-- his musket for a mombmit;,'but then, without firing, he fled, accompanied by his comrades. Wondering at this strange conduct -as I deemed it-I looked about in ext'rdniom'topidntion, for the frightoned looks of the hitherto undaunted 'vete rans had completely astonished me, My eyes naturally sought tile place to which the fugitive sentiunol.had, pointed his musket, and never did a more fear. inspiring' object meet the human' vision than that on which my terror'strulck gazewas, now rivetted... The moon, as it s!one brighiti 'into the passage, showedma hunlman, form, self-sustained in the air, the', arms of which were strotlched outas if to onfold me witiin:their:grasp. , It was clad in a shmcr" fi'io of trans''pareit' whto, which sowed' greatly in contra't iwith the darkness behind.
