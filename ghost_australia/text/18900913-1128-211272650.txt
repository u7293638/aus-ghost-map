AFTER WINTER. Not yet the infant Spring Hath changed her russet gown for robes of green, But lieth slumbering, Hid in the covert of a wood, unseen; Folded in shadows deep, Ethereal visions flit across her face in sleep. Like memories of tho dead, Winter revives and fades, mid days of blue, And thrusts his snowy head Upon the landscape, whitening all the view ; "With shrilly voice and thin, High singing o'er the downs the chilly breezes spin. Here, by the sharp blast switched, The ruddy drifts about the road arc swayed, Dancing like sprites bewitched In whirling somersaults, of light and shade ; The hollow forests ring, Shuddering with leafless music as the lank boughs swing. Upon the cottage wall The Jasmine lingers in a listless dream ; . O'erhead the sparrows caii; And twiLter out the day in dolorous theme ; Whistling u sober tune, The ploughman drives his team the long dank afternoon. Far o'er the marshy fen .The vaprous ghosts worn travellers waylay ; In dale and dike.and. glen The brittle leaves of autumn waste away ; The snowdrop, bowed With grief, Broods iike an angel o'er its chastened leaf. Not sorrow, nor yet scorn, _ Nature wears on her face, but calm distress ; . Like to. a child new-born The year's dim senses grope for consciousness ; Through all the stilly wood Stirretn the soul of being, bursting blade and bud. . Soon shall the violet bloom Beneath the hedge, and scent each sheltered nook ; . \- The primrose gild the gloom Where pale anemones poop o'er the brook, And laughing waves shall swell Of golden daffodils in every mossy delL Hasten, eweet birds of song, Wing oer the waves, and fill the woods with voices; \- Spring tarrieth, slumbering long, She wakeih not, but iu her dream rejoices ; Quicken thou magic sod, - .Burst to a sraof flowers, "and . greet the priests ' The_Cornhill Magazine. \- - ' - ' >"-" mictefic
