CHAPTER XXXIX. During the fine weather it was Mildred s cuatom to rise v er} early, and take a long walk before break- fast She had sev eral proteges among the poor people of Faurwater, whom, in these earl} rambles sim some- times visited. The morning after the interview between Sir Ru- pert Athenr} and George Allen Mildred og un en countered tbo latter She had been as far as Peakton, and on returning, saw the supposed beggar- woman perched on a bank by the path leading through the rock} v Ulej She aro«e as Müdred approached, and addressing her, as on the previous dav, m the assumed tone oí an aged female bade her good morning ' Good morning," returned the } oung girl with a pleasant smile " ^ ou'ro not ashamed to st>eak to the old beggar then '" "Of course not," replied Mildred, promptlj "But "she added, "I think, at} our age, it is not right that 3 ou should be dependent on the uncertain resources of chance charitv I should prefer to see }ou difforenth situated Have j ou no relatives "" The dt&guised; mau did not answer the question, but, dropping his assumed croakj voice, said in I113 natural tone * Look here, my girl, it's not worth while to waste time in a lot of useless palaver l'v e been deceiving you Im not a beggar, in fact, I'm not even a woman " He seemed to enjoj the intenso amazement ex- hibited bj his hearer nt the sudden and astounding disclosure She stepped back a pace or two, with her beautiful ejes dilated and her lips apart regarding the speaker with a mixture of wonder and alarm " You needn't bo frightened of me, nevertheless," he continued " Pro done you a good deal of harm one way and another, but I wouldn't hurt } ou now Don t stand there like that Here'sa labourer coming along, he 11 wonder what is up I must put on the beggar again bul he s past " And re-assuming his shrill treble George allen began to whine forth a half intelligible lament, which he contmued tdl the man alluded to had pa^d somo distance bejond them Meanwhile Mildred stood looking at him in sheer bewilderment, undecided whether to run awaj or to remain and fathom the mjsterj She did not feel exactly afraid of Hie man His object coiüd scarcelj be to rob her, for she wore no jeweller} and he could not suppose that on a morning's ramble her purse was ver} weilfurnibhod, if ha thought she earned one at all "I know what j ou are thinking about Miss Hughes (Mildreds astonishment increased at the mention of her name) lou aredebating whether you shall rush after that clod-hopper, and ask his protection But 3 ou wont go, j ou re too inquisi- tive about me " Mildred could not help simling at the man's egotism. How came you to know m} nome " she in- quired, rather timidl} Ila' ha' that's good" he laughed, eudentlj greatlv tickled bj the question ' How carne I to know jour name eh»* Well j 01111 find out bj and bj, perhaps lou're sure it is jour name he added, m a peculiar manner ** I hav e every reason to believe so," was the re- sponse " Umph ' And I have every reason to behove dif ferentl}/* rejoined George Allen "Would }ou like to know }our history?' he added, abruptlj ' I believe I know it well enough," returned the girl "Then you believe wronglj," was the bluff retort " There 13 only one person m this w orld who knows your real story-that person is mjself " " Indeed 1 " exclaimed Mildred, with an incredulous smile She began to think that the man was one of those swindling impostors known as "fortune- tellers " But though he did not aspire to this dignitj, George Allen appeared gifted with a wonderful talent for reading people's thoughts " I am not going to ask }ou to cross mj hand with a bit of siTv er, miss," he pursued jeermgly, re- garding her with an amused smile Rut ira silly to stand shilly-shallying like this " And his manner changed again to that of business- like gravit} " I have crossed your path intentional!}, j oung lady, and with an object in view I hav e something to impart to } ou, but I cannot do it verbally, I will write it First, I must inspire you with some confi- dence in me, m fact *ell you who I am You had a relative in the United States ?" Mildred replied m the affirmative, not a little amazed at the question " I am he," continued George Allen 51\. The young girl looked incredulous. " Of course, I do not expect you to believe my simple statement," proceeded the other, " but I can substantiate it with proofs Firstly, I will tell vou a few things connected with yourself'that, unless I am the person I profess to be, I could not be ac- quainted with." He then proceeded to mention divers incidents m relation to her childhood and her deceased parents, to which Mildred listened with an astonishment that ma} be readily conceived * If s aU correct, is it notp he concluded She responded in the affirmativ e. " Now read that " Whde speaking ho had taken from an old leathern gocket book'a soiled, ragged letter, so rotten that, as e opened it, it almost dropped piece from piece This he presented to Mildred. "You may not remember the writing,' he said, " but 3 on will recollect the circumstances mentioned in it First glance at the signature " The girl obej ed It was * Afar} Hughes " "My poor mother's'" she exclaimed, regarding the faded cliaractera with an expression of affectionate regret fhe epistle began, " Dear George " then went on to describe a poverty and miserj which were too vividly stamped upon the orphan s mind to need to be recalled b} the aid of that tear-blurred writing It waa a lotter which poor Mar} Hughes had written to the " brother in America," when in the last stage of her sore distress. * Do you believe me now p" asked Mien, as he re 1 ceiv ed back the paper "Yea but why are you disguised like this5" " Well, I don t think j ou would care to be satisfied on that point, it is rather an unpleasant subject, and may as well be dispensed with-at any rate, for the present 111 teU you this much-I m m danger, and the least indiscretion on} our part might be attended with most disagreeable results to me "i ou must not mention to any one a word about this meeting Pro- mise me this." " I promise " " Good. Let me pay j ou ono compliment, my girl I believe you are truthful. " Thanks for your good opinion," said Mildred, with a smile " Now let us come to the point," proceeded George Allen "Time is getting on, and this road will be infested with labourers m a few minutes, going home to breakfast It won't do for us to be seen talking together in this waj What time will j ou meet me to receive the papers I referred to '" ' Whom does the information concerns' asked Mildred, doubtingly " It concerns a great mam, but chief!} }ourse!f," was the reply " Now will } ou follow my direc- tions?" " First tell me what they are," said the girl, cautiously " You are a prudent woman, 3fi!dred. Had jour mother been as sharp,} ou might be differentl} situ- ated at the present moment Mj request is that} ou meet me at the old tower in the lane at nine o'clock to-night 1 dare not-venture nearer the village, for fear of encountering some one I hate strong reasons for wishing to avoid." Mildred hesitated. Meet ft man, m a suspiciou disguise, at nightfall, in such a lonely spot' The idea rather terrified her " You do well to be prudent, as I said before," con- tinued he, " but you may overdo the thing Why should you fear me ? I would not hurt a hair of your head. I have held you in mj arms, and nursed you on my knees, before you were a fortnight old. What object can I have in harming you ? I have gi\en you good proofs of my claim on jour confi- dence." [ Mildred certainly thought his arguments reason* able enough, " Sinel} I maj trust him , he is m> uncle," she reflected And she anally agreed to keep the ap- pointment Since coming to Tuirwater, Adrian Catania had tstabliMmda dangerous mtioiacj with his ' cousin's" prett} maid-dangerous for her, as her vault} and want of principle rendered lier unable to resist the fascinations of such a tempter, and too eager to behevo m tho insidious flattery by which the un Íinncipled } outh sought to ingratiate himself in her avour lie had been keeping an appointment with her They had rambled about the most secluded parta they could find for some time, and he had gono as far as ho dared towards homo with her Then intending to prolong his own walk, thit his return to Great Lodge might not follow too closely on that of Caroline, and excite suspicion on the part of Cecilie or the servants, he directed b13 steps along a winding lane which led to the nuned hunting tower mentioned in an earl} description of Fairwater The moon was shining brightly over the surround ing meadows, but tho lane waa overhung with large trees, and shaded by thick hedges Adnan appeared reflective on this particular occasion, and wandered on farther than he had intended He was about to retrace his steps, when lus eye caught sight of a dark female figure moving rapidly across the moonlit sward, m tue direction of the tower, which now, like a huge spectre, stood grim and wild about a hundred yards before lum Curious to ascertain who the female was, and what the motive for her late Msitto a spotwbich aftei nightfall was general!} avoided bj nearlj all the inhabitants of I" mrwater, Adrian determined to witch her movements He cautiously advanced till witlnn a few }arda of the ruin, then, crouching down in a dr} ditch under the tall hedge, awaited the arrival of the lad}, whom he could distinguish, through the openings m the hedge, steadily advancing Suddenly he fancied ho recognised the figuie, and as it drew nearer he became certain that he did so It's apparel-the gra} waterproof cloak and gip*^} hat, forming Mildreds garden coatume--nas too familiar to nun to be mistaken Adrian stared at her in utter astonishment ' Could it be possible that Mildred-the prudent, pure-minded Mildred-was mixed up in any in- trigue r" was the thought that first occurred to his corrupt heart, and it was accompanied by a feeling of malicious gratification To have discovered a flaw in this delicate pearl, a black speck on the fair beaut} of this pure flower, would have given lum pleasure ' \li ' my sweet aignon'" he soliloquised, "}0u little think who is watching the movements of tho^o prettj feet, tripping so datntilv, over jon dewy turf ' But where 13 jour cavaliei ? It is time he also ap- peared " The unconscious object of his sunedlance issued from the field b} a gate not five yards from where ho had stationed himself She walked straight ne«oss toward the old tower, and disappeared behind a fragment of broken wall At the same moment a low whistle, which tho Italian concluded emanated from a small ivor} call used bj Mildred to summon a pet terrier, echoed through the ruin AWth stealth} movements the spy gained the point where the jounggirl had disappeared The enclosure bejond the wall had probablj once served asa court}ard, but the pavement had long Bince been broken up, and it was now overgrown with weeds, brambles, and wild flowers People often asked Gabriel whj he did not do away with the ruin altogether, and turn tho space it occupied to better account He smiled quite agreed with them that it was use- less, but said he was not in want of the ground for any particular purpose, and that it might as well remain How much is there that the world calls useless winch, in the po^ssor a ej es, is of priceless "v alue ' It is association, iuemor},that constitutes ita worth , nota computation of pounds shillings, and pence In that old tower Gabriel bad played when a boy, in itsgrrss-grown courtyard had his v enerated mother gu en her children many a little treat at liaj making time, whan the j oung amateur labourer», flushed and tired with their noisy frolics, had made it half way house for the enjoj ment of a pic- nic duiner Oh ' say not it was useless, when the memory of a mother's gentle fice-1 face whose brightness was carl} dimmed in death-hovered about its rough walls' Peeping round the broken masonrj, Adrian Catania perceiv ed the j oung girl standing near an archway in tho basement of the edifice The moon shone full upon the court} ard, while the spot where crouched the Italian lay in deap shadow In a few seconds ho perceived what he supposed to be the figure of an aged woman issue from the archway Tins was not quite the sort of person Mr Catania bad expected to see, and he felt rather dis- appointed, for he began to think that, after all, Mildred's usit to the rum was to listen to the fables of some old fortune-teller This impression was, however, speedily removed, and his amazement, curiositj, and interest increased tenfold In his hand George Allen held a small, clumsil} - sealed packet " Here is the information I promised," bo said " You will find that the importance attached to it has not been over rated Itissuffieientl} comprehensive to allow meto dispense with all-verbal explanations, therefore I will not detain you unnecessarily I need not impress upon sou the importance of guarding the contente of this packet with the utmost care, but one thing I would most solemnly urge upon 3 ou -tliat } ou do not neglect to carry out its purpose It is a dutj which } ou owe to the innocent and in- jured, and which it devolves upon you to execute bj the most sacred of earthl} ties " He placed the packet in her hand, whence she immediately consigned it for greater security to her bosom " I don t suppose we shall ever meet again," con- tinued the fugitive " To morrow I leav e England I have marked the last hours m my nativ e land with perhaps the only act of justice that baa for moro than twenty j ears distinguished my life You are a good girl, I think, and deserve it I told } oil this morn- ing that 1 had wronged } ou, but the reparation I oner is not too late to be of sen ice to you. Now go home and read those papers Good bye " "But why shall we never meet again9" asked Mildred, who could not help feeling a degree of in- terest in one whom she believed was cTooelj con nected with her "lou will learn all from that packet," he replied " Besides, mj morements are nothing to j ou I hav e misled j ou m reference to my being a relative " " Then j ou ire not my mother's brother after allp" 4nd Mildred s voice assumed a tone of reproach " I never said 1 was," responded George Allen, resolutely " There now," be interrupted, " don't worrj me with any more questions GohomeandBatisfy>our curiosity at j our leisure Once more, good bj e " And without e\ en shaking the hand which Mildred hesitatingly extended, he turned away and re-entered the archway The girl stood for a few seconds as if bewildered , then, with a frightened, hurried step, left tho pre- cincts of the tower and proceeded homeward Re- turning she took the lane for her path, while the Italian followed some distance behmd bj the field I When near the house, however, he contrived to get in advance of her On entering, he found Mrs Ravenhall sitting m her drawing-room, reading It happened that Gabriel had gone to attend a benevolent meeting at M- * " Where is Mildred supposed to be -*" inquired Mr Catania. " Star-gazing in the shrubbery, I believe," replied Cecilio, without raising her ejes from her novel " She told me she was going to take a walk by moon- light Ine\er saw amone so ridiculously m love with the moon m my lue For my part, I don't like it, its ghostly light always gives me the blues " At this juncture a peal at the door bell announced Mildred's return. " Don t saj a word, Cecilie, about my having only just come m," said Adrian "Whynot5" "I have a reason for wishing J ou not to do so, which I will explain at another time " Mildred, who always threw off her garden attire m the hall, was not many seconds m making her ap- pearance in the drawing-room, where she found Adnan, to all appearance, half asleep over the news ar e yawned and rubbed his eyes as she entered, with every symptom of weariness "It is late, Miss Hughes, for a young lady tobe abroad unattended," he remarked " lou should have allowed me to be your escort" " Oh ! one can hardly be otherwise than safe in the neighbourhood of Great Lodge," replied the young girl, coldlj " I do not think your moonlight promenade has done you much good," put m Cecilie " You look as white as if j ou had seen a ghost" Mildred did look rather pale, a natural conse- quence of an adventure such as she had met with " I have not felt very well all day," she said, eagerly taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the remark to prepare for an escape to her own room " I shall soon wish you good night if you wal excuse me " And after remaining about a quarter of an hour longer in the drawing-room, she gladly retired to her bed-chamber Immediately after securing the door, she proceeded to examine the contents of the mysterious packet They consisted of a number of slips of note-paper, covered with close, cramped writing, within which was folded a smaller package, beanng an intimation to tho effect that it wa« 00t to be opened.
