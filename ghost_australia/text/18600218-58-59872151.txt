THE MANAGER'S METAMORPHOSIS. I Bold Thingumce, tho great lesseo, peeps through tho cur ! tain groen, : Where in the pit nine people sit, and up aloft thirteen ; With fury hot he counts the lot, a short hut odious job "Go! call tn mc," says Thingntneo, "sagacious Thing- umbob 1" " It's quite s wreck, the fol. In Spec, the Drama in this age. (Thingnmoc's grammar hos been spoiled, thongh writing for the stage.*) The Rritlsh public's quite loft off" bringing its wives and daughters, To Ben our idiots, ghosts, and gags-our thieves and Tr av√≠alas. .
