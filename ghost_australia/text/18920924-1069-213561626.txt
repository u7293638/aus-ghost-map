GHOSTS. Dear, is the night-time done so soon ? Is yon pale gleam the dawn ? call it a glint of the ghostly moon Through our curtains closely drawn. More lights, more wine ! Let the music chime put the feast again begin ; With song, with kiss, hold back the time When day and the ghosts come in. For there in the dawn are the spectres two That will not be charmed away : The ghosts of two in the night time slain, But they only walk by day. A fair white girl and a man with her, Like a murdered king and queen ; It is only the woman that once you were, And the man that I might have been. Arthur R. Ropes.
