I The Balmaiu Kegr.ttta yesterday was one of the most I successful aquatic gatherings that have yet been held in ] Port Jackson waters, lor which, the. public hava to thank I those members of the committee who actually worked ; I and the hon. secretary, Mr. Fletcher, who wasindcfatifrable j ia his endeavours to kriiiff off the' meeting- with success, j Through the courtesy ot Messrs. Gilchrisc, Watt, and Co, and Captain Ghest, one of the finest vessels trading to this port, tne H.IiI.S. Australia, was placed at the disposal of the committee as flagship, and during the day she was crowded with visitors, including a larsre number of ladias, who took a lively interest in the results of the viinous events. The bind of the Balmain Coldstreams was stationed on the bridge, and played a. capital programme of music, which tended very considerably to enliven the scene. The Australia was gaily tirsssed with flags, uaa was the pink of cleanliness tmcl good order Irom stem to stera, reflectingcreditin the holiest degree on Captain (ihest, Mr. Bannerman, hi6 chie! officer, and ti*e officers and crew, who throughout the day were constant in their endeavours to mate matters pleasant for their visitors. The waters of Iron Cove and Su^r Loaf JSay were covered ivith sailing craft o£ all sorts, from the tiny cocStleiliell to the larger yachts ; but the wiud, a light north-easterly, was scarcely sufficient to show them off to the best advantage. Captain £{eitcnstein had the Vernon handsomely dressed ; and Ms youngsters were loud in their applause as tiie competitors m the different events passed the .vessel. The shore from iong Nose to White Ilprse Point was crowded with spac tators wherever a view could be obtained; ana at Biloela a large number of visitors had gathered. eho,rtly after noon his -Sscellency the Governor, Lord Augustus Lo.tus, arrived on board, and was received by Captsin Ghost, his Worship the Mayor of BaUruiin (Mr. Cameron), Messrs. Hutchinson and Ganard, il's.L.A., Captain Kroouifield and several uiem tiers of the committee. His E-cellencv. after a tour of the flai-shin. was conducted to the capcaiu's cabii-, where champague was opened aad the prices were inspected. After somp cou vernation his .Excellency said that ue couid not take leave oi' the com mittee without proposing ?' Success to tiie Baimaiu Ke gatfa,' and in doins so said that he was gratified to find that they had the same grand hospitable ship for flag vessel taiit they had last year, lie was at all times plad to . participate in t3ie enjoyments of the citi zens, more particularly at such a timo when they were marking their loyalty towards the Queen and the heir to the Throne He could assure them that he had it from die lips of H.H.K. the Prince of Wales that he was anxious to visit Australia, but wasp /eveuwci by the almost impossi bility of making such a prolonged absence from England. He still b.oppd,'iiowever, that li.li.H. would visit them, and that the visit would be made during his own term of office. His Eoyal Highness took a deep interest in all matters re lating to Australia, and he {the Governor) was anxious that he should see -what a magnificent country it really was, what its fnture was likely to be, and witness the industry and enterprise of its inhabitants. His Excellency then dwelt on the progress of the colony as instanced in the weekly communication now established by steamers, and reminded his hearers that he had on a previous occasion advocates a matrimonial uuion between the shores of tho harbour. He was not altogether in favour of a high level bridge, but thought that a low-level swing bridge from Bal main to Goat Island, theace to the nearest point of North Shore would be the means of great benefit to the city, and for a certain number of years, at least, it would Eunice for their trade and commerce. He hoped, before his term of office was over, that it woul d be his duty to lay the first stone of such a bridge. The toast, having been duly .honoured, his Worship the JSlayor of Balmain expressed the pleasure the committee felt at the visit of His Excellency, and he hoped that as it was not the first, that it would not be the last timo liis Excellency would, be amongst the residents of Balmain. Hearty cheera were given for his Excellency and Lady Augustus Lof tus, and the company separated. AT LUKCHE03J, 'Whicu was laid out in the handsome saloon, and catered for by Compaguoni,his Worship the Mayor of Balmain (Mr. Cameron) vrcsided at the committee table, and, after appe tites had been satisfied, proposed the toasts or the ' Queen ' and ' H.B. ti. the Prince of Wales,' which were loyally honoured. Kenext proposed the ' Parliament of New South Wales.' In response, Mr. Oeorje Merriman, M.Ii. A. , said that he hoped that the measure they had now before Parliament — the Land Bill — would be so passed as to settle all differences between free selectors and squatters, that it would be dealt with without party consideration, and he made accept able to the country generally. Sir. Garrard, Jl.i..A., also replied. Mr. W. A, Hutchinson, M.L.A., was also called on and expressed the great pride he felt in being connected with the executive of such a capital regatta, and at witnessing so large an attendance. Mr. Buchanan proposed the health of the committee, 'and cordially thanked them on behalf of the public for the excellent programme they had orovided. Mr. Thallon (hon. sec), in reply, said that he was glad to find that their efforts had met with success, as that was all they needed to spur them on to future efforts to promote the advancement of Ealmain. Captain Broomfield also expressed the gratification lie felt in finding their efforts appreciated. The rowing races that day had been ably contested, and he was pleased to see their old champion once more a. victor, Mr. -Elfcington, in proposing the toast of ' Captain Ghesi and the officers of the Australia,'said that placing that fine vessel ex, their disposal especially helped to make a success of the occasion, and in wishing ^Captain Ghest all health and prosperity in bis new command, ho sincerely hoped that he and Ms officers would be iopff connected with the trade of the port of Sydney. Captain Ghest having replied on behalf of himself and his owners end agents, the com pany separated to witness the racing. OP THE RACING The greatest interest was shown in the bona fide amateur race in waaer boats, for which it may be said that, with- one exception, tiie Lest amateur scullers in Australia competed, the Victorian competitor, Mr. Fittes, carrying off the laurels from some of our best men ; while Mr. Sbarland, of Tasmania, was pliced third. Both men have wonderfully improved Bince their last visit to Sydney ; and, judeing from their rowing on this occasion, the race for the Krug Cup, November 17, should be a most exciting contest. The M.K.C. crew won the Maiden Sours in capital style, their boats being first and second. The All-comers was a great race between the erstwhile champion, E. Trickett, and W . Beach, the former winning pretty easily. The sailing races were devoid of much interest from the fact that thero was not nearly sufficient wind to enable the boats to travel on. The following is the result oi the different events : — BOWING KACES. Bona-fide Amatenrs, in wager boats.
