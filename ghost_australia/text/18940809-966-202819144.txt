New Books. "THE WINNING SHOT" AND " AN ACTOR'S IJUBL."â€” We have reoeived from Mr. G. A. Lyne, of King William-street, an advance copy of a book containing these two stories, by Conan Doyle. The "Actor's Duel" is a not strikingly original theatrical story dramatically told by a tragedian driven mad by sorrow, the result of a great wrong which he avenged upon the perpetrator by stabbing him to the heart in a duel scene in " Hamlet." The " Winning Shot" is a weird conception, well wrought up, and based on the supernatural. The villain is a mysterious foreigner with ocoult powers, who consummates a ghastly revenge for a well deserved blow by conjuring between his enemy and the target at a rifle match the ghost of the man himself, so that when he fires his bullet pierces his counterfeit presentment and causes the death of the eriginal on the instant. There is an unpleasantly original idea in she vindictive foreigner's tale of a castaway at eea cutting off and eating his own ears to save himself from starving. This is an improvement upon the imprisoned oat who eat himself up to the baok of his head, and only stopped there beoauBe he could not reaoh.
