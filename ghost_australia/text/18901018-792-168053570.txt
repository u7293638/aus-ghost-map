A SOMNAMBULIST LOCKED-UP IN FITZROY. IN SEAECH OF *' TELEPHBNE ACCOMMODATION." 1 SHORTLY before midnight last night Con* stable Tregoning, whilst on hiB beat, had a strange experience in Brunswick-Btreet, Fitzroy. As he approached the intersection of that street with Kerr-street he saw a white, ghost-like object approach him. On coming up to the spectre^ he found' a middleaged woman, dressed in her nightgown, minus her boots, peering into the corners of shop doors, as if in search of something. " What's up, missus ?" asked the oonBtable. " I am in search of telephone accommodation, sir," she replied. " I am quite satisfied with my lodgings; they are as good as what I could get at Menzies', but the telephone accommodation is very bad. Can you tell me where I can find a place that would suit?" Tregoning only knew of one plaoe where lodgings ana telephone accommodation combined could be found, and that was the watch-house, so he took the lady there. She appeared to be in a daze at the time, but after sleeping a little while gave her name and address. The officer went to her house and prooured some clothing for the woman, and this morning brought her before the court on the elastic charge of insulting behaviour. She told the Benoh that she was subject to " somnambulism." She was discharged with a caution.— Herald, Friday evening.
