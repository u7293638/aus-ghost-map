THE MECHANICS’ INSTITUTE. TO THE EDITOR OE THE STAR. —Yours, &c.;, 7th September. A SUBSCIUBER. SIR, —I see that two of your correspondents in this morning’s issue sign themselves “A Member.” The one to whom I wish to refer is the gushing admirer of the Rev. W. Henderson. How funny some folks are when they admire!;'l think it is'then the national character' shows itself to__perfection. There is no mistaking where your corraspondeut hails from. The brightest aide of his blarney-stone is held forth to view. The, way in which he butters and blames the rev. gentleman makes one scarcely know whether to admire his impertinence or hisfulaomeness the more. The secretary of the Mechanics’ seems to have a few supporters, but they. are ; very lame ones. They remind dhe of crutches. Of course it was to be expected that there-would be admirers of Tommy Dodd and legs. The secretary has' made the’ institute into a kind of mongrel, a cross between a mechanics’ institute and the old casino or singing-saloon, the latter predominat ing. I would suggest that those members who are in favor of the.casino go into the business properly. Let them take the Alfred Hall,’ make the admission six pence, to bereturned in liquor. They could profess it was a fine arts exhibition for the benefit of the Mechanics’, la that" basilicas the . secretary would be a treasure. The respectable members of the institute -would a°t then be compelled either to withdraw their patronage of be constantly annoyed at the absurdity of the posi tion. A mechanics’ institute forsooth! Poor founder of mechanics’ institutes 1 His ghost must be terribly perplexed in the spirit world.
