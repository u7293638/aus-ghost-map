TWENTY YEARS AGO. 1858-1878 PUT down your swag and rest, old man, The night will be damp and chilly ; Just light your pipe—I shan't be long A-slinging on the billy. Let me look again—why, bless my soul! I'm never talking to Joe That worked with me upon Jackass Flat, Some twenty years ago ? " I'm blowed if" I'd ever known you ; What has changed you so—was it lush ? Why you're not the ghost of the cove that went To the first Port Curtis rush; When you punished Billy, the native, Till you forced him to cry * a go," In that muss about Polly, the barmaid, Some twenty years ago. " Ah, yes ; your hair is grizzled, Your step is not so light; And the road we've got to travel, mate, No longer seems as bright As it once appeared—and few are left Of the pals we used to know, When you and I were younger, Some twenty years ago. " You tell me Billy got married, And went back to the Sydney side ? Who'd have ever thought such a chap could be To a woman's apron tied. You remember him in the shanty On the road to Bendigo, Where we spent so many jolly nights, Some twenty years ago. " And where's long Jim, the gaspipe ? Cleared out this many a day; I heard he went in for politics, As a liberal M. L. A. They say he's turned a howling swell, And doesn't pretend to know The folks he used to loaf upon, Some twenty years ago." * * * * * Well down the stream we're bound to slide Whether we swim or sink— You're not a Good Templar ?—then, by jove, This meeting will run a drink. And though we're both old buffers, We still might stand a show, Could we find a slice of the luck we had Some twenty years ago.
