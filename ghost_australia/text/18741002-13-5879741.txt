THE MAYOR'S FANCY DRESS BALL. The fancy dress ballThe fancy dress ball—the great event the anticipation of which has agitated the circles of society for days, or even weeks—has come and gone, and can only now be ranked amongst the pleasant memories of the past. Attracted by the example of several of his predecessors, our present mayor (Councillor M'llwraith) determined to mark his term of office by bringing together in the Town Hall one of thoso brilliant assemblages which form such an agreeable change from the run of ordinary balls. Nor had he to go back long for a precedent, if such were needed. It is little more than a year since his prede- cessor, Alderman O'Grady, gave an enter- tainment of the kind, which waa successful beyond expectation; and carrying our memory further back, we can recall the splendid ball which, under the mayoralty of Councillor Amess, inaugurated the opening of the Town Hall; and the equally magnificent entertainments which preceded it, held in the Exhibition building in honour of the visit to our shores of Prince Alfred. Colonial society is everywhere noted for its readiness to join heartily in every form of amusement, and its desire for this particular class of entertainment is by no means satiated. Fancy balls appeal with far greater effect to our sense of pleasure than the mere evening dress ball, which in comparison is as the glimmer of a farthing rushlight to the bright glare of the gas. The one embraces all the enjoyment of the other and adds new pleasures of its own. It excites our imagina- tion, delights our sense of the beautiful, developes the latent romance which lies dor- mant in our nature, and affords us oppor- tunities of gaining the admiration which we crave. The allurements of the fancy dress ball are felt not only by the young, but act with un- diminished influence on those of riper years. The ravages of time may be concealed, and the staid matron, who otherwise would never think of triumphing but in the success of her daughters, allows again a pardonable feeling of personal vanity to spring up within her breast as she cons over in her mind the dresses which best would suit her style. And then, what opportunity is afforded to the young ladies, the belles of to-day, for display. Their difficulty lies in the choice of costume, and great is the perturbation of spirit and discussion until each one is suited to her liking. Nor are the male sex less in- terested. The man of business forgets his money-making for a time, the barrister his briefs or his brieflessness, and the politician his desire for office, and with all the question is, "How shall we go ?" The result of their decision we shall see later. There are few buildings more admirably suited for a fancy ball than the Town hall, and though the picturesrque appearance which tastefully arranged decorations have given to the Exhibition-building are wanting here, still the accommodation afforded and the thousand and one conveniences provided in anticipation of such purposes render the Town-hall the place par excellence for these gatherings. T'were useless to describe at length the preparations made for the accom- modation of the guests. Suffice it to say that nothing was left undone which could add to their comfort and to the enjoyance of the evening. The Mayor exercised his hos- pitality right royally. Invitations were sent to nearly two thousand guests, and accept- ances were received from almost the entire nnmber, for fancy balls are comparatively rare. The guests commenced to arrive be fore 9 o'clock, and the ball-room soon filled. The out-door arrangements were very perfect, and by the aid of the email body of police under the command of Sub inspector Mont- fort, all confusion was avoided. The crowd which gathered around the entrance, eager to observe the coming visitors, was well-be- haved. Each fresh arrival afforded sub- ject for their amusement or admiration, and their comments were sometimes not lacking in wit. A apace was kept clear around the steps of the Town-hall, so that the carriages could drive up, and discharge their living freight without difficulty. For the conveni- ence of walking guests, a lane through the crowd was kept open. After 9 o'clock the arrivals followed each other in rapid succes- sion, and the hall soon presented a crowded appearance, but the stream of guests continued to flow on long after, until with wonder one might ask where room was to be found for all. But though there was, of course, unavoidable crushing for a time, this difficulty soon wore away. Some took up their position as wall- flowers, content to watch the gay scene with- out joining in it, whilst others, from the bal- conies, gained an unimpeded view of all the brilliant pageant. To say that the scene was one never equalled in that hall would no doubt be an exaggeration. The special circumstances attending the opening ball rendered that one not likely to be surpassed for many a long day, but the gathering last night, regarded as an index of the prosperity of the colony, might well be viewed with complacent satisfaction. His Excellency the Governor arrived shortly before half-past 9 o'clock, and was received in state by the mayor and councillors, and conducted to the hall. The signal for the commence- ment of dancing was immediately given, and partners were chosen for the first quadrille. The opening set consisted of His Excellency and Mrs. M'Ilwraith, the Mayor and Mrs Cohen, the Attorney-General and Mrs. Stanley, and Alderman Cohen and Mrs. Fitz- gibbon, Major Pitt and Miss Cohen and Captain Machell and Miss Service, Captain Bull and Mrs. Fellows and Mr. J. Hopkins and Mrs. Machell. One word as to the musical arrangements, These were under the superintendence of Mr. N. La Feuillade, who had a very efficient band under hiscon- trol. The music was well selected, and the lively and seductive strains of the galop and waltz rendered even non dancers anxious to join in the whirling dance. Let us now for a few brief moments observe the bright and busy scene in the hall, and watching the gaily-dressed crowd ever changing in the movements of the dance, give ourselves over to the glamour of the hour. Unhampered by any perception of the hard facts of reality, we will trust to imagination only for our guidance, Reason shall vacate her seat, and imagination mounting to the throne, shall throw aside the controlling reins, and give full play to fancy. As in the magic mirror of a wizard, we can mark the passing pageant, and can recognise old friends familiar to us in the pages of history of tho drama and of romance. But, lest wo break the magic spell, not a word must be uttered, or tho brilliant picture which fancy creates will vanish like a summer mirage, and wo shall discover that the vivifying spirit which has given life and animation to the scene has departed, and that instead of beholding, as we in blind unreasoning faith have ima- gined, the characters themselves in propria persona, 'tis the dresses alone which have formed the foundation of our vision. But ere our awakening comes, and our pleasant fancies are dispelled, let us examine more closely the scene before us and note the passing visitants. Among the crowd here assembled are included visitors from all times, from all countries, and from all ranks, for in the domain of fancy time and space are annihilated. A Roman emperor, clad in Imperial purple, marches past accompanied by a lady of the court of the Grand Monarque. A Neapolitan peasant, in no wise daunted by the exalted rank and stately demeanour of his companion, the illustrious Semiramide, exchanges with her laughing badinage. Here the Queen of the Fairies, freed from her mis- placed love for " translated " Bottom, glides | merrily about, enjoying to the full the plea- sures of the evening. There Sancho Panza, with proverbs, the distilled essence of wis- dom, dropping from bis lips in ceaseless profusion, excites the amazement of Dominie Sampson, who exclaims, in wonder. stricken tones, "Prodigious!" In the far comer of the hall we may observe the roguish, the wicked Don Juan, the centre of attraction to a bevy of laughing dames, " with large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands " While the guileless Haidee recking not bis absence, with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks listens to the soft vapoury nothings whispered into her ear by the redoubtable Don C.aesar de Bazan The jovial Falstaff, too, is here, "a good portly man, 1' faith, and a corpulent." but alas, ad- dicted to the consumption of an intolerable deal of sack. He relates again the story of his prowess against the men in buckram, unmindful of the plain tale that can disperse Ins romancings to the wind His partner Medea renounces for the nonce her tragic air, forgets her wrongs, and dismisses the remembrance of her fickle lover without a sigh. Hero Romeo and Juliet meet together under happier circumstances, and Lady Macbeth, as before ambition fired her heart to deeds of blood, can join merrily in the gaiety Shylock, no longer intent on Antonio's pound of flesh, passes by arm in arm with the sweetest doctor of laws in all Venice, forgetful of the time when the same wise Portia turned upon him the tables of the law in such trenchant fashion Next our eyes light on a vision of loveliness Psyche-whose unrivalled charms enchained even the god of love himself Her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, her shapes, her features, Seem to be drawn by Love's own hand-by Love him- self in love And numbered among her admirers is the mad melancholy Prince, who now, unmindful of his father s ghost, finds here metal more attractive. And can Cupid himself, the immor tal urchin who plants his arrows into every heart, be absent from such a scene as this ' No a fancy ball without Love would be like a body without the soul. Invisible though he may be even to the eye of fancy, still every where by infallible signs his presence can be noted. The blushing cheeks and side- long glances of the damsel who is listening to the impassioned whisperings of the en- amoured swain at her side, show that love is not absent Figaro, the lively barber of Seville, flies about the room ready to join wherever mirth and jollity prevail, whilst Paul Pry's unwelcome countenance and ceaseless iteration, "I hope I don't intrude," breaks up a many a merry meeting Here the Ancient Manner holds with his glittering eye an unwilling listener, who, cursing bores in his heart strives to stop the story of horrors which befell the impious man who with crossbow shot the bird of good omen General Boom with waving feather, and triumphantly bearing the sabre de mon pere, demands to be informed "Where is the enemy and on discovering the attention of his intended partner monopolised by that scoundrel Fritz, declares with emphasis " That he is a disgrace to the service " Madame Angot's daughter, too, finds better employment than quarrelling with her old schoolfellow and quondam rival about tho affections of a " sorry scribbler ' The piquant Rosina, with arch looks and laugh- ing eyes, carries on in the language of love an animated flirtation with a Merry Andrew, and wrings the heart of her amorous and suspi- cious guardian Dottore Bartolo Here Marie Stuart unhappy name in history, meets on friendly terms her great enemy and rival, Eli zabetb, and the sagacious Burleigh communes on affairs of state with Cardinal Richelieu Brutus, the noblest Roman of all time, un- bends the majesty of his aspect, and con- descends to join in the many windings of the dance Norma brings to our mind sweet memories of song, and that enthusiastic votary of Terpsichore may well be Preciosa, whose graceful movements charmed even the ascetic souls of Romish cardinals Fifine, in page costume, as at the fair, see " here she fronts us full, with pose half frank, half fierce ' But to depict all the changing phases of the scene, to particularise every member of the brilliant crowd, would be indeed a hopeless, an impossible task Shepherdesses, fairies nobles from all lands, vivandierieres, Spanish señoritas, Greek slaves, allegoric representations of Twilight, Sunset Morning, the Seasons, may be counted by the score, and their picturesque costumes lend variety and colour to the enchanting spectacle All is light, life, and gaiety. Here are all the allurements of the ball " The music and the banquet and the win", The garlands, the rose odours, and the flowers, The sparkling eyes and flashing ornaments, .the white arms and the raven hair-the braids And bracelets; swan like bosoms, and the necklace, An India in itself yet dazzling not. The eye like what it circled;, the thin robes Floating like light clouds twixt our gaze and heaven, The many twinkling feet so small and sylph like Suggesting, the more secret symmetry Of the fair forms which terminate so well All the delusion of the dizzy scene, The false and true enchantments-Art and Nature But even fancy's visions must have an end, and dismissing the thought that we can here make acquaintance in the flesh with the vivid creations familiar to us in books, we can view the scene from another aspect and still obtain amusement and pleasure Some of the characters were well sustained, and their movements might be watched with interest. His Excellency wore his official uniform, with the order of St Michael and St George The mayor also was dressed in his robes of office. But these dignitaries having been dealt with, we must now be mindful of the order place aux dames and indeed one of the moat remarkable dresses in the room was worn by a lady. Visitors to former balls will recognise the character of The Press sustained by Mrs Butters The dress was a magnificent one, and notable alike for the originality of the idea, and the completeness with which the idea was given effect to The dress ex- hibited copies of all the metropolitan papers with the names of the country papers inter- spersed, and printed on white satin, bound with gold A gold coronet surmounted with stars bore the inscription, "Liberty of the Press " As formerly, Mrs Butters carried her model gold printing press, and dis tnbuted during the evening slips of white satin ribbon, on which were printed the following historic and appropriate acro stic - M elbourne Town hall its portals opes once more, A glittering throng to welcome as of yore C onvened as formerly at Mayoral call, I n fancy costume to the Fancy Ball , L ike Mayors of olden times-Smith, Cohen Bayles, W 1th right good cheer the Citizen regales R oyalty comes, and Butters leads the van, A gain he comes, and Mowbray is the man, I n civic splendour Arness opes the Hall, T hen Fenwick and O'Grady make a call H urrah for Macilwrath, the last of all ! There were numbers of ladies attired in beau tiful dresses, but scarcely distinctive enough to recognise at a glance the character which they intended to represent Ladies of the courts of Queen Anne and the Georges with powdered hair and cheeks marked with the beauty spots after the fashion of the time, to show the political party to which they be longed, might be seen conversing with gay caballeros from Spain, brigands from Greece, or bewigged cavaliers of earlier days Chilperic, in kingly costume escorted the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein around the room Night and Morning, half white half black, engaged in the dance with a lovely cantiniere in appro priate costume The doughty town clerk, clad in a suit of complete steel, appeared as a knight ready to enter the lists on any occa sion The Earl of Leicester in magnificent costumoe attracted many glances But the crowd is so great that it were impossible to mention all worthy of notice The military and volunteer officers, the represen, tatives from all the navies in the world, the fresh water sailors, the monks and frars of orders grey, the cavaliers, jockeys, peasants, and the barristers and students, whose more sombre dresses relieved the brilliancy of the others, and, above all, the ladies, with their varied and elegant costumes, combined to form a spectacle to be remembered. To seek by words to give a picture of the scene would be but to court failure At midnight the signal was given for supper, and a general move was made in the direction of the lower part of the building As on previous occasions, the courtyard had been covered in, carpeted, and decorated with flags, and by this means transformed into a roomy pavilion sufficient to accommo date a large number of guests The caterer was Mr Gunsler, who gave every satisfac tion, und the taste shown in the arrange- ments of the tables was generally admired The mayor was seated in the centre of the table, having on his right His Excellency the Governor and Mrs M'llwraith, and on his left Mrs Francis, the hon. the Premier, and the Hon. E. Cohen. After supper, the usual loyal toasts having been disposed of, the mayor proposed the "Health of His Excel- lency the Governor." The toast was drank with enthusiasm, and Sir George Bowen, in replying, said that although he had been left here in an unhappy state of grass-widowhood, jt would not be for long, as in a few months he would be going home to fetch out his wife, whose health had necessitated a visit to the old country, from which she had been absent 15 years. Before separating, ho desired to propose "The health of the Mayor and Mrs M'lrwraith ;" and ho considered that the Mayor's munificent hospitality was only equalled by his generous support of the charities of the city. (Cheers.) The Mayor, in reply, said he was glad to see those pre- sent, and hoped they had enjoyed them selves He would ask them to again drink to "The health of Lady Bowen, and her speedy return to the colony " Sir George Bowen briefly returned thanks. Dancing was resumed in the large hall, and the swift passage of the hours was scarcely noted. But like all festivities the end was reached at last, and the guests departed, acknowledging with warmth the hospitality of their entertainer THE COSTUMES The costumes at the ball were both diver- sified and elegant there was an absence of the nigger element, which absence was not a matter of regret to those present There were not so many striking costumes as at previous fancy balls, but the dresses seen in the room were in character, and when the hall was filled with dancers, the coup d'eil was one to be remembered Among the principal dresses may be men- tioned the following -The Mayoress (Mrs M'llwraith), as Kathleen Mavourneen, wore a magnificent costume of pink satin, richly trimmed with silver fringe, and orna- ments, consisting of lyres, stars, and cres cents , the hair powdered, head dress com- posed of marabout feathers and silver ornaments ; handsome necklet, bracelets, and brooch of silver, completing a most perfect representation of an " Irish Lady " Mrs Fitzgibbon, as Marguerite Duchesse de Joyeuse, temps Charles IX , wore a robe and tram of white satin, richly embroidered with gold and pearls, sleeves puffed, underskirt of cloth of silver, bodice of white satin stud- ded with diamonds, rubies, topazes, garnets, and emeralds, hair in powder, with ostrich plumettes and pendants of gold.
