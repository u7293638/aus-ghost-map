NEW SOUTH WALES V. BALLARAT. ,..;.: .;-, [S'KOM: OUK OWN REl'OItTER.] ? : i ... ! The Now South Wales cricketers, having ac cepted an invitation 'from tho Ballarat Cricket Club to.- play a two' days' match against the picked cricketers of tho golden city/proceeded oh Monday by the' evening train to play on Tuesday and Wednesday. There was a slight alteration in the New South Wales team, Park haying been .substituted, tor tlie demon , bowler, Two-, penny. .The game commoncod on Tuesday, about ; half -past; eleven 0 '.clock, in the pro sonco of about 300- spectators, which in creased during the afternoon to upwards of 1000. Tho weather was delightful, being neither too hot nor jtqo .cool for the exhibition of good cricket, and an excellent pair of wickots had been pro vided for the occasion, and it must be said, though lato in the year, they roflected, tho greatest credit , oii tho local curator. Laurence and , Sweeney, the respective captains, having tossed, the lattor won and elected to go in to bat, ?sbndin'g in Figgis and Bennett; to the bowling of Laurence and Thompson. Tho second and third balls of tho former's- first over resulted in Figgis and Bennett being caught in the slips. Gay, who. : appeared next, made eighteen before, ho was: dis posed by a splendid bailer from Nat. Thompson.' With the exception ; of . an easy, ;catch at the early: part of thegame,'his innings was a good one. The innings of Watson was the chief distinguish-, ?ing feature of .the '/Ballarat batting : he mado' forty-two/ saw four or five men out, /and exhibited some ? splendid 'dofenco' against the f ast, bowling,' ? and played the slows with good judgment. Next in point of merit was undoubtedly- Sanderson's' innings of twenty-three, not but. ,! Hirst played a neat innings of fourteen, as also did jovial Tom Morres pno'of eleven. It may be mentioned that Huddlestonc, who had promised to mako ono hundred at Ballarat, only made six. Tho Bal larat innings closed for tho respoctablo score , of 130\. Tlio bowling and fielding of tho Sydney men lacked tho' energy which characterised their oxcrtions when pitted jirjainst the Victorian eleven; nor is it to be wondered at, considering they ;avo rather cresliillcn ? after thoir -; recent defeat. On behalf of, New -South Walds. Jones and Laurence appeared at tho wickets, whbn tho latter, after making two, ,w;is splendidl.y.caught 'at '.tho wickets by tho veteran . Dan Sweeney. II owitt followed, and iiftermakihg a rapid twelve, fella victim to a good 0110 from Sanderson,, whoso bowling was first class. Park then joined Jones, and mado twelve, and was had at long leg by a very woll judged ? catch by -Hirst. Shoridan. became Jones's . next partner, and iimdo -: a good stand, which was not disturbed . .until .ho ainfortunately put his leg where his . bat ought to havo been. . Ho mado thirteen in his usual patient manner. Nat Thompson and Jones now became confreres, and soon after Jones skied one to long-on, when Huddlesfcono duly landed it. His innings of iifty-ono wa3 an excel lent display of batting, combining dofouco with vigorous hitting. Grogory, tho top scorer in. tlio great match, came next, whonhe.lost his matey Thompson, who was bowled by Morres. He made nineteeen, and was not _ at all up to tho mark. Gregory soon followed his example, after making ten, being, out leg beforo wicket from Gay. D. Gregory and Coates wero the next batsmen, but the lattor retired almost as quickly as. ho went in, being caught in long field by Huddlestone, for nil. Teece.came next, but Tom Morres administered such a snorter that he split tho bail in twain, before he allowed the batsman a chance of scoring. The three last wickets fell for no ? run,- and the innings closed for 14£ ' The fielding of;Ballarat was very 'good- particularly that, of Sweeney and Huddlestone ; the' former seems to keep wicket better every day of his life. ThebqwlingqfGay, Sanderson, and Tom Morres. was particularly effective, The following is the score :— : , '..'?.'? ?. .'? BALLARAT.— 1ST INNINGS. Bennett, c. E.Gregory, b.

The above match was resumed about eleven ; o'clock on Wednesday, -in the presence of a .tolerably fair sprinkling of spectators, who,: from the good stand the local.players had made on,the previous day, were quite' prepared to see' the eleven cricketers from New South Wales defeated. Tho weather was again beautiful,, but slightly warmer than on the first day, but not in _the least degree too warm for cricket. B. J. Figgis and Sanderson were tho first ? representatives of Ballarat to appear with bat /in .hand. Tho former player, after haying, made a leg hit for five and a. single, allowed Nat Thompson to disturb the perpendicular position of, the stumps, having just before served Sanderson in a similar manner for five. Ben nett came next and was joined by Huddle stone, the hero of the promised hundred, but.he declined the honor of scoring, and so retired with ah appended ' duck's' ogg ; ' ho; was caught by Laurence. W. A. Figgis now became Tincy Ben nott's partnor, and soon became busy with tho fowling, which at this stage of tho game was of the most . ? excellent description, - Nat , Thompson appearing to bo in rare trim. , Bennett,- after playing a neat innings of twelve; was smartly taken at short leg by Oliver. Dan Sweeney came next, and with Figgis played some good bowling, when Nat Thompson bad tho veteran caught off a little one at short leg. C. Wai son, tho highest scorer of the previous innings, followed, but had tho bad luck to lose his matey ; who was clean bowled by a ball from Thompson, which pitched outside his leg and took tho \ off stump. His! score of twelyo was carefully: obtained.; Theiplay of the rcmaindor of the Ballarat team need not be particularised if Watson be excepted,. as none of them exhibited any marked brilliancy twenty-nino, not out, is deserving. of every praise for his display, as ho' received' some excellent bowling, and played in a manner which drew forth favorable comments from his- opponents, and repeated applause from-tho spectators. He made two splendid log hits, well worth recording.. Beyond a doubt he is the finest bat in tho Bal larat club. Tho second innings of the Ballarat team closed for ninety-eight, showing a decrease from their former scores, but this may be mainly attributed to the excellent bowling of Nat Thompson and E. Gregory, combined with tho splendid fielding of D. Gregory,- Oliver, Sheridan and Hewitt. Two sharp catches by 'HV Thomp son and Oliver arc worthy of record, the former a smart one in tne ? sups on- &. ureguiv, and tho latter a fine catch at short leg winch disposed of Dan Sweeney, . i After a short adjournment, Laurence . , , and D. Gregory ai)pearcd to do battlo on behalf, of New Soiith Walqs, having eighty-seyon runs to mako to win the game. D. Gregorj', after making seven runs', was beautifully caught by Sanderson at long-leg off Morres, a splendid hit, one 'almost worth half a dozen. E. Gregory' now joined Charley Lau rence, who up to 'this timo had 'been playing very streaky, having given threo chances in a very short space, of time. Tho appearance of E. Gregory upon the scene seemed to have a bonefi ,cial efl/cct. on the Now South Wales . captain's play, as hp after this, with his partner, made it extremely warm for tho Ballarat bowling, and -brought up tho scoro to tho three over tho i required number ' to .win,, amidst not the ghost of a cheer for the1 success of the visiting team. The hitting of ? the champion scorer of the New South Wales men. in the Inter colonial was on this occasion even better than ;his hitting, at Melbourne. , /The match having concluded, at about four o'clock,,, a singlo.wickot ma,tch was got up to occupy tho remainder of the. afternoon, but it did nptproye a .very ?interesting/ affair, from the ' fact that the best men on each?, side did not take part in it. It was reduced, siriiplyt'o a throwing match in the bowling de partment between David Gregory and the inevi table Tom Huddlestone, which tho lattor won in a cantor, as Gregory, though shying, can disguiso it very woll with a tolerably fair dolivcry, while Huddlcstone's shying is open and palpable. It may horc be stated that it is thought, from thecomments passed by the public regarding tins, infringement 'of rule 10, that n ;;voafc blow has boon struck in Ballarat -to. the already too 'prevalent unfair bowling.
