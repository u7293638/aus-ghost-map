It ia to be regretted that before reflecting on Sir Thomas M'Dwraith for the peculiar interpretation be pitt upon the word " honest, " Mr. Morehead and others did not indulge in a little philological research. Sir Thomas him- self might bave done eo with advantage. A reference to Jamieaon'a "Dictionary of the Scottiah Language " shows that " Honest " ia used aa synonymous with " honourable, be- coming ;" " respectable and commodious ; aa ppoaed to what ia paltry and inconvenient." " Honeatlle," " boneatlike," and " honesty " are all used in the aenae of implying respecta- bility, honour, and decency. Samples of their use in that sense are given. Burna certainly did not mean mere respectability when he spoke of " an honest man being the noblest work of God;" and perhaps Sir Thomas M'üwralth would not care about any deroga- tion from the dignity of the word as used in the couplet : " Auld Ayr, ivham ne*er a taon surpasses, For honest men and bonnie lasses." Still he nae* the word frequently in what may be -taken as a modified sense. Shakespeare tnakea frequent employment of the term, othello dwells upon it in Ida reference to " honéát lago," and his " exceeding honesty." Hamlet «peaka of the vision aa "an honest ghost" In " Much Ado About Nothing " we nave Benedick exclaiming to Claudio, " Do Í'ou question me, as an honest man should do, or my simple true judgment." Shakespeare uses a great many words only to be found now in Lowland Scotch ; and the expression oocumnein the above passage seems to be the «olloqaialiaui Sir Thomas Mcilwraith referred to. 'i
