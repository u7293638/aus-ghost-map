' WHO GOES THERE?' An army is guided by quite a com plex arrangement of watchers, who are so placed as to make it impossible for the enemy to bring artillery within 4,000 yards of the camp without the warning being given. The army being encamped, say 20 miles _ from the enemy, it has its 're- serve outposts' from one to two miles away. These are very strong bodies of men, and capable of opposing good re sistance to sudden attack. Still further out are smaller bodies of soldiers, called 'supports.' Outside these egain, are smaller but more numerous bodies, called pickets. And, lastly, in the most dangerous and lonely situations of all, ore the sentries, sometimes in ones, gome times in twos. It is impossible to conceive the mental strain endured bv a sentry when close to the enemy. He must not walk about. He must not show himself in any way. He must not smoke. He must not whistle, or even whisper to himself; Every leaf that Falls, or breath of wind blowins- over fhp grass, or note of a night-bird, startles him. He does not know at -what mo ment he may not be sent to the other world by tne bayonet of someone trhc has crept up in the dark, or perhaps he may be overwhelmed by a bi-r force of the enemy. And no matter how nn;Ch afraid he may be of ghosts or fairies, or wild animals, there he has to stand or lie till his time is up.
