At tho close of tlio plaintiffs case Mr. O Connor moved for a nonsuit on tho ground tliat thoro wie no rase to go to tho jury Tho orders which tho plaintiff received in no way compelled lum to got into the posi- tion m which ho ««HU hen tho nccidont occurred It mis »aid that thero was ovidoiico of negligence on the (art of the defendant's foroman, but ho contended ¡hatthere wasiio euch ovidonce. Tho ovulonoo was (hit ill o hoii'-es w ero being built, and that O'Brien waa ra cliargo of tim wholo of them, and it could Mnllj bo contended that ho was responsible if nnv uncle min on tho work f «led to do his duty. It must be negligcm.0 of something wlurh a porson waa rnsonably hound to do, a«, foi instiwo, seeing that tho chain v.ni nil light from timo to time. Coming to tho other quostion, ho submitted (hit tho maxim, tofc»/i nott ¡it winna, ap- plied « " man voluntarily chose to incut a {nk in certain employment which ho happened to bj engaged ni if he know tho risk of tliotomploymont The endenco n as th it the risk w Inch was incurred nt tho time ^ns equally knuwn to the plaintiff and the defendant, and tho fornior continued to do tho work with the risk nttiched to it. Ho also submitted that there was not a tittie of evidence that any complaint »kout tho stato of tho ding was made by plamtiff either to defendant or his foreman. His HON on declined to nonsuit There were in tho cato as it now stood distinctly questions for tho jury which ho could not determine, and ho thought it was jost as well that ho should not oppress an opinion ¿pon thom, although ho might point out to tho jury what they'»ero Ihoro was first of all the question »aether tho shngs woro safo or unsafe Assuming that tho jury after hearing tho ovidenco on both gdc* came te the conclusion that tho modo of lift- ing tho stono was unsafo, thoy would theo have tho further question to considor, whether it was not the duty of tho defendant to have somo person always on (ho spot to givo tho mon warning when this operation cf raising the stone was proceeding the evidence it present being that the doginan in point t( fact had nnothor duty to discharge, namely to go up to the top of the building as soon as the sling was loided, in order to rceeivo tho stonos The question was vi hother there should not have beon («?person other than the dogmnn employed for tho puposo of warning the mon, and who wonld remain at (bo slings to pre\ cnt persons running into danger »hilo this opcntion ot lifting waa bouig earned on 7he<0 weio questions for tho jury '»Inch it was opossiblo for him to tuko upon himself. Tho first witucss called for the defence was George Junes O Brion, a stonomison, who was foreman of (he works nt the tuno of the accident, and ho said that it ra tho dury of tho dogman, when the stones wore hang hauled up, to order thomeu to stand ch;ar That »ouldbo «hen tho stones woro uliout to go up, and the dogman would then proceod to the top of the budding: to recorvo the stones and unlock the slings Witness had himself spoken to plaintiff on several «rasions about kocpmg out of danger, and ho had often told tho mon that ho w ould discharge thora if thev would not do what tho dogman told them , ho remembered particularly speaking to plaintiff, as ho would not stand out of tho way whon the dogman told him , w hono\ or tho dogmnn gavo ordors to stand clear no ouo was ullowcd togo under tho slings if ho saw lum the plaintiff was ongnçed st tho tyne of tho accident dressing "shoddies," and with tho assistance of a labourer, putting thom togethor in tho slings ho was on tho top of tho building when tho stono was being raised, and ho heard the dogman call out io the mon to stand clear while tho stones were coming up ho noticed that two of thom v» oro slipping, and ho immediately rushed to tho Bide of tho w all and called out, " Stand from under," or "Look out down below," one man jumped away, but plauitiif romamed whoro ho was, mid he SUM rum looking up Jolin Try, birdder and contractor, stated that tile best method, m his opinion, of lifting " shoddies " was bj a sling, and in Ins ex penenco thero ?» as goncrally a man to warn the men to keep out of dangei wnilo tho Btono was being raised in man) cases but not in all, ho wont up with the load to tako the chain off, in somo cases he re- mained below until tho trune chain came back, and if he saw something fulling ho would naturally waru tho mon to got out of tho way , but it was not his special duty to do so, as a rulo stonemasons worked under the stono as it went up, as it was not considered a dangerous practice. Portman, tho dogman, said that his duty was to seo that tho stones vt ero firmly slung, and that they went np properh Tho sling would bo np about 7ft. or 8ft. before he would leave if Ho also corroborated tho foreman's evidence as to warning the plaintiff.

About two years after the cohabitation thus bogun tho first of two children was bora to thom, and m 18bl the respondent married tho petitioner lu Melbourne, the marriage being kept secret in order not to expose tho fact that up to that time thoy had been unmarried. At the time of their being so niornod it was sworn that both the parties believed tho respondent to be a widow, as they both behoved ber to be nt the timo of tien ¿cstiaUiaacy.

that tho making of such declaration is a condition prece- dent to tho performing of a valid marnago ceremony Tho Act, it will bo observed presentios no fonn of murringo ceremony in the caso of persons

statute oxpressly ouacts that it Bhall invali- date Buch contract, and thoro are no w ords in tho Act declanng that a marnago without such preliminary proceeding shall bo invalid The first part of tho section simply doclaros tho marriages hy tho persons alono authorised to marry to bo valid, and the hitter part of tho section accentuates that by providing that no marnagos porformod by other jiorsons than thoso authored shall bo valid except those of Jews and Quakers tho main object of the Act evidently hemp; to jiromoto the publicity and lcgulanty of marnagos by insisting on the performance of tho ceremony by rocognisod ministers of religion and Stito officials, and so to protect tho commuuitv from all the miser) nnd uncertainty attaching to clandes- tino maiTiagcB performed by po-sons whoso capacity to celebrate a marnago so as to bo binding in law might bo doubtful That tho Legislature clearly recognised tho possibility of thoro boing a valid marriage contract though not ono conti acted accoi ding to tha requircmonti of tho statute is clear from section 6, which nins -" Provided that no marnago in fact shall be avoided by reason only of the samo havuig boon

cloarly showed that it did not intend to invalidate a mnmago, if ono luid reilly takon placo even though tho chief objoct of tho Act was dofoatod in ita main revision-that marnages rhould only bo celebrated y regularly licensed clergymen How much moro impossible is it to suppose that it conldovcr havo been nitouded that a marnago Bhould bo mi ululated morel) bocauso a preliminary prococduig form- ing no part of tho marnago ceremony had not boen gono through na directed by tlio Act The object of section C being to protect nn> - one honestly boheving that tlio porson performing tlio coromony was a regularly officiating clorgyman, though in point of fact ho might not bo a clorgyman at all, and would in that case bo incompetent to take tho presenbod declaration or to marry, goes to show that tho LeglBlaturo mtcndod to recognise marnagos m fact ontorod mto by parties believing that thoywnro contracting a vidid marriage and a fortiori it must bo assumed that the Legislature novor intended to invalidate a mam igo where tho parties were under no disability to outoi into the contract, and whore tho porson officiating at tlio ceremony was legally com- petent to do so, Bimply bocauso a preliminary proceed- ing forming no part of tho ceremony was not observed As pointed out by Dr Lushington in tho caso of Cattonill v Sweetman if would como to this, that "a marnago wholly deflciont in ceromoniobj would stand in a profqriblo position to a mnrnngo w hore ii part only of tho presenbod fpnns was omitted ' ' Tor tho foregoing reasons I havo como to the conclu Bion that tho Legislature had no intention to invali- date and has not invalidated, a murnago coromony which has not beon proceded by tho de- claration proscribed by tho fourth Boction lu thus conung lo the conclusion that not only did tho Îiarties intend to marry whon the coromony was por ormed by tho Reverend Father Kiely, but that it vvus whon porfonncd by him, a valid marnago, binding njiou both
