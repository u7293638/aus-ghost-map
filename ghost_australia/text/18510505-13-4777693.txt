The magistrates dismissed tho caso and recom- ! mended Scott to be more guarded in future. There cm bo no doubt that the grossest pen- ? jury has boen committed in this case by somo of I tbo witnesses; but whether it has boen done | with a view to victimise Mr Scott, or relieve him from tv sonous charge, is not easily ascei tained. In rofereuce to the written statement sent to the bench, I think the magistrates would act wisely in such cases, by refusing to pay the slightest attention to such documents, unless the party would como forward and state publicly on oath what he know of the matter; such underhand proceedings are only opening the door :o the chamber of abuse anti tyranny.
