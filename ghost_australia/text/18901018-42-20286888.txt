AMUSEMENTS Manager Mugger's Treachery. "Pretty woman, Helen Bellasis!" "Uncommon, uncommon!" remarked the other man. "And what a lucky fellow Forsyth is!" "Luoky! lucky isn't the word. She's an angel, sir; Helen fiellasia is an angel; and if ever a woman saved a piece, blue-eyed Helen Bellasis has saved hey husband's drama to night." And then they swallowed their whiskies and rushed back to their stalls; for the entr'acte bell had already begun to ring. I knew the men—dramatic critios both of them, Mole and Nipper. Everybody knows Mole (Mole's ••Modern Dramatists"); and as for Nipper, yon can always tell Nipper's stuff—it's so tre mendously technical. He talks about the auditorium and scenarios and protagonists. Actors hate him; he has such a retentive memory. When Garper, the tragedian, played Hamlet, Nipper persisted in giving the public his reminiscences of Garper, at a small pro vincial theatre, as Guildenstern; then he said he liked Garper better as Guildenstern than as Hamlet, and spitefully added that he thought there was more scope for Garper in the provinoes. Nipper is honest, bul offensive. As for Mole, he and I are as thick as thieves; we are the only two men at the Cannibals who play five- card cribbage. I always heat Mole; when we sit down to play five-card cribbage, Mole is to me as clay in the hands of the potter. I don't take much interest in theatrical matters generally; but I've been in love for the last ten years, as most of us have, with pretty Helen BeUasis; and I was depressed to know that she was the wife of another, and that the other was Forsyte, of all men in the world: Forsyth, a ohattering windbag of a fellow; a man who was careless about his dress; a man who stutters, and wears an eye-glass from necessity; a fellow who never even played at five-card cribbage: what could Helen—l mean, Miss Bellasis—l mean Mrs. Forsyth—see in him ? I had " pegged out" as usual, and I pocketed Mole's shilling; and then he told me the history of the Forsyth marriage. "Jack married her out of gratitude, you know," he said. "Till •Ethel's Sacrifice' came out Forsyth had never done any original work; he was only a 'ghost'—what the lawyers call a 'devil;' he did the work, other fellows got the money and the reputation. But Forsyth was biding his time. The business of his life was to attempt to plant 'Ethel's Sacrifice.' Lots of fellows had read it; every body said it wa9 exceedingly brilliant, and it grew smarter and smarter every day; for For syth used to carry about a type-writer's copy of • Ethel's Sacrifice' in his pocket, and whenever he thought of a good thing in it went. ' Ethel's Sacrifice,' as you remember, was a four-act drama; there was a strong man's character part, which, as Forsyth used to say, would have suited Mugger down to the boots; but Forsyth couldn't get hold of Mugger. Mugger wouldn't even look at 'Ethel's Sacrifice;' he was in the hands of his literary adviser, and that gentleman's principle was to go to the top of the tree and pay the top price. Mugger had actually played two pieces of Forsyth'9 without knowing it; for Forsyth was devil to Topper, and had written every word of Topper's two last successful dramas, Topper's contribu tion being to change the names of the charac ters. You remember Grace Featherleigh," said Mole, " ' poetry of motion,' and all that sort of thing; of course you remember her. They had had her at the Frivolity for ten years, where she was one of the Vestals engaged in tending the sacred lamp of burlesque. They had got rather sick of her at the Frivolity; she was getting 'majestic;' and where majesty begins, as a rule poetry ends. So Grace Featherleigh determined to go in for drama* Mugger waa squared with the loan of £3000 • and all Grace Featherleigh had to do was to get hold of a strong part specially written for her. She sent for Forsyth; and this is what | she said to him:— •' • Mr. Forsyth,' said the Featherleigh, • I've heard that you've got a little play for sale; something about an injured wife, I believe.' Then she bit her lips, rolled her eyes, hoisted that big .smile of hers, prossed her chin on her knuckles, and looked up to heaven; just as she does in her photograph, you know. •Do you think I look like an injured wife ?' said Grace. : " Of course he immediately administered the ' necessary dose of flattery. ♦"Oh, Mr. Forsyth,' said the oharmev, ' you shouldn't—'you really shouldn't!' " And then they went to business. •• • There's nothing Mr. Mugger wouldn't do for me,' said the artless Grace. ' You take the thing to him, Mr. Forsyth, and say I sent you ; and Mugger will do it for my sake;' and then I she Btruok the attitude again. " She didn't take the slightest interest in the play; she trusted to her friends and her good looks to pull her through; she meant having her dresses from Paris, and all she stipulated for was that a minuet was to be introduced. " 'If they don't como to see your play, Mr. Forsyth,' she laid, ' they'll come to see mj minuet.' "Forsyth put his pride in his pocket and ' hurried off to Mpgger. " Now Mugger was no fool. He didn't cam one straw for the Featherleigh, or for Jack Forsyth and his drama, for he could get any amount of dramas from Topper; but Mugger oared very much indeed for the three thousand pounds that Grace Featherleigh could pat in his way. So Mugger agreed to read Jack's piece; and when he had read it he found that the great character part in it did suit him down to the very boots. Ho fell in love with tho part at once, and then he sent for Forsyth. "•The thing's right enough,' said Mugger; • but I don't see how it's to be done. There are sixteen " lengths" of dialogue for Ethel: the Featherleigh couldn't remember five, if she were to be burnt alive the next morning. But she'll have to play Ethel all the same; and that means " damnation" sure and certain— there isn't a doubt of it. Still it'll have to be be done.' " They signed an agreement; the piece was read to the company of the Parthenon Theatre within the week, and Grace Featherleigh wai cast for Ethel. She was grand, sir, at re hearsal, where she always read her part—the part of which she didn't know a line. She ordered the Paris dresses, and every seat was booked for the first night. " Of course she had an under-study; the under-study was Helen Bellasis ; she had the thing at her fingers' ends; and she used to prompt the Featherleigh from memory as the rehearsals went on. •'Now Mugger is particular. He doesn't stand any nonsense from anybody; and he had a rule, from which he never departed—that everybody was to be letter-perfect in their r6lea at the dress rehearsal—for Mugger always in sisted on a dress-rehearsal. They began aot 1. There was little Bellasis putting all she knew —which was a lot, you know—into the pert lady's maid. I sat in the stalls and saw the whole thing—for I'm a friend of Forsyth's; and towards the middle of the act in sailed the Featherleigh as Ethel, gorgeously attired in Worth's costume number one, book in hand, my boy—book in hand. •• • I beg your pardon, my dear,' said Mugger, as she began calmly to read from it after the first dozen lines; ' but you'll please to put down the book.' •♦ ♦ Me, dear boy!' said the Featherleigh; and then she hoisted the great smile, put her chin on her knuckles, and looked like the photo graph. " But Mugger was adamant; he didn't mean to be 'defied'by Grace Featherleigh, not he. «Ml hold it for you,' he said retj quietly, as he took the book from he* hand. "«Don't chaff, Mr. M.,' said Grace angrily; • ii ain't a time for ohaffiog.' " Bu"t Mugger didn't answer her; he merely gave her her cue—• Ethel, you're looking oharm fngl' She couldn't take it—;Of course she couldn't; she was just bursting with rage. • This is a planned thing I 1 she hissed. ♦ You've insulted me before the whole company, Mr. M.; but you shan't do it with impunity. 1' "'Oh, nonsense,' said Muggor.. 'Ethel, you're looking charming,' he said, as he gave her the cue the second time. But she didn't attempt to take the cue, and she didn't look charming in the least. The woman was mad with rage. Two groat strides brought her up to the astonished Mugger, and she boxed his ears in the most scientific manner; and then she began to scream and shriek with forty woman power, and before be knew where he was she had dropped into Jack Forsyth's arms. "«if you don't go. quietly, ma'am,' said Mugger, whose ears were a bright puvple, *I'll send for a policeman.'  : "But she only drummed on the boards with her heels; and Forsyth and two carpenters carried her to the Btage-door and popped her into a four-wheeled cab; and she and her maid drove off to Fulham, vowing vengeance. -. - " • Now,. Nelly Bejl&sis;," said Mugger, whetf" he got back to the stage, after having; seen the Featherleigh safely off his premises, ' let's see what you can do with it. Ethel, you'rt looking charming, he said ; and off thoy went without a single hitch. That little chit o%a thing, sir, brought tears into my eyes.. Sfte had her chance, and she took it. She didn't rant, she didn't pose; but she played the injured girl-wife to the very life; and Wlgblock, the fellow who did the juvenile lead at the Pantheon, proposed to her the same evening. Sharp fellow, Wigblook, bht," said Mole; "he saw there was money in the girl, a> we all did. " Well, she was even better on the first night than she was at the dress- rehearsal. The fact is that the thing had been planned between Mugger and Forsyth, and the Featherleiph was their victim. She's Lady Numskull now; if she hadn't married young Numskull she'd have gone to law with Mugger; as it was the thing blew over. Nelly Bellasis made Jack Forsyth's name. He fell over head and ears in love with her, and she with him. They've been married ten years now, and the Ethel of ten years ago has six sturdy young ' sacrifices' running about their charming house in Beliord Park."— St. James's Budget.
