WHY WEDDINGS IN MAY ARE UNLUCKY. It has been considered unlucky to be married in May ever since the days of Ovid. In ancient Home there was held in May a festival called ibe Lemuria, or feast of the Lemures, which was a ceremony in honour of the speeches of departed souls. It became the Roman* what we should call "bad form" to have matrimonial feasts at the season of a solemn ritual, being, no doubt, thought to be an insult to the dead to marry at such a. time. From this a number oi stories grew of the revenge made by the outraged ghosts upon those who dared to disregard them, and if anything unfortunate happened to a couple wlio had been married in May it would, of course, have been put down to retribution. So the tradition of ill-luck arose, and its influence has lasted ever since, even to our time.
