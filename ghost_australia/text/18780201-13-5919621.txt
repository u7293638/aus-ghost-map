A LAW AND ORDER LEAGUE. (FROM THE HAMILTON SPECTATOR, JAN. 29.) The country will have profited very little by the recent " confessedly illegal escapade; of the Governor in Council, if it has not by this time learnt the lesson out of the nettle danger to pluck the flower safety ' We have seen what a few desperadoes may have the impudence to attempt by the aid of a little organisation, and it is quite time the gang were met with a display of their own weapons There are supposed to be 180,000 electors on the rolls for the Assembly), and a peri. ] acetic mob of 700 are made to do duty for the whole Melbourne, Ballarat and Geelong constitute the base of operations, and from these three points, whenever a political meeting is to be held, excursion trams are run at nominal fares to transport Major Smith s regiment of Ballarat roughs, or Mr Mirams contingent of Collingwood boot honors, or the Chief Secretary's own body, guard of Geelong fugleman, to take possession of the platform and fill the auditorium of any public room where the meeting is to be held On these occasions a blue shirt and a bludgeon are the passports which insured to their possessor a return ticket between Ballarat and Geelong for 35 if he has the money to pay, or the chance of a free pass if he is impecunious, with a couple of fife and drum bands thrown in, just to keep the "boys together and facing its then marching to the desired spot This mob of 700 men form what Sir George Bowen calls "the vast majority of the people of Victoria that is to say, they make more noise than all the rest put together and being apparently ubiquitous, they are able to manufacture public opinion smoking hot in any locality where their chiefs may desire it, or they can swamp and intended demonstra- tion initiated by the other side Now although we counsel the law and order party to organise, we do not go to the length of saying they must emulate the tactics referred to above, nor could they do so if the wished, because unlike the Government, they have not the command of the railways to be used for political purposes What we do desire to see, however, is the initiation of a league or association for the preservation of law and order and the maintenance of the Constitution, so long as we are permitted to live under a constitutional form of government As for public meetings, the action of Mr Berry and his friends has made them a by word and a reproach, insomuch that it is now generally recognised that such gather, ings are "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing " The real public opinion of the country resides in the ballot boy, or, as the late fair Robert Peel said, " the battle of the Constitution is fought in the registration courts ' To see that every man has his name on the roll, and exercises his vote when the times comes, is of far more importance than i mining up and down the country trying to gag hostile candidates, and it is of vastly greater importance that every well wisher of his country should know his duty and remain at his post Let it be admitted on all hands that public opinion declared itself very freely and unmistakably on the 11th May, when it returned such an overwhelming majority pledged to impose a land tax Let it be conceded with equal candour that public opinion was also positive in asserting its altered character when afterwards it seated Mr Gillies for Rodney, Mr Mackay, for S Midhurst, and Mr Murray Smith for Boroondara, in the face of the most strenuous opposition the Government could bring to bear Let it be allowed that Mr Berry is sagacious enough to detect the " handwriting on the wall when he resorts to such extraordinary shifts to get Sir Ince seated for Barwon, and thereby prevent the electors putting in Mr Rev ten , when he has such a wholesome dread of Mr Francis coming in for West Melbourne, that he changes his Attorney-General to induce the only man who has the ghost of a chance to contest the seat, and when he entertains such a honor of appealing to the country on the question of payment of members, although declaring all the while that the country is with him We affirm that the country is not with Mr Bent now to the extent that it followed him on the 11th May he Premier has done too many foolish things since to have been able to retain the conn dence which was then misplaced in him Without any attempt at exaggeration, we shall be believed when we say that public opinion has been on the turn for some time, that just now it is pretty evenly balanced and that it only requires the carry - nig out of a few more Ministerial threats, such as have been fly- ing about lately, to con- sign Mr Berry to the limbo of ohv ion Hitherto the most estimable of our citizens have been far too apathetic in the exercise of their public rights and duties it has actually been a boast with many of them that they take no interest in politics, while a coursing match or a race meeting Inn o possessed greater attractions for them than an election for the Legislative Assembly 1 or want of proper organisation among the, many an election has been lost, and because the constitutional party lune never put forth their full strength or have divided their votes amongst a plurality of e indicates the stonewall clique, by concentrating their efforts, have been able to put in their man malthouse he may have polled only one fifth of the votes on the roll We trust this will be changed in future, and that all honest men who have anything to lose will see the propriety of uniting in the present critical juncture of the affairs of the colony 'there is plenty of material to work upon The 30,000 electors of the Legislative Council would alone form a powerful phalanx to begin with, and we presume there is not a man amongst them who would refuse to join a law and order league they ought all to be canvassed individually, and a low rate of subscription would produce a considerable fund to pay expenses At any rate, there would be very little fear that the organisation would be unable to pay the, rent of a room in which to hold their meetings, as happened the other day to the Liberal Reform League when their landlord, Mr Sturt so warmly denounced them for their shabbiness the suggestion only requires to be taken up with spirit, and a healthy change will soon become manifest in public opinion If the Melbourne people show any backward- ness in taking the initiative, there is no reason why the men of the West should not protect their own interests, by forming an, association with branches in the country districts Late events have demonstrated that some of our leading residents are beginning to throw oil" that insouciance winch for- mercy characterised them, for by petitioning the Legislative Council, and addressing; the Governor, they have testified that they are not improved spectators of what is going on It would indeed be wonderful if they were not by this time awakened from their lethargy, seeing that property of all descriptions has been greatly depreciated in value, that capital is leaving the colony, that acts of Parliament are overridden by illegal orders in council, that attempts are making by superseding the audit commissioners to place the Treasury at the mercy of a lot of needy adventurers, and that after working all the mischief that can be brought about by suspending in turn every function usually under- taken by Government for the protection of life and property, it is contemplated by the party in power that matters may then recipe for severing the Imperial connexion In this programme so very enticing that reasonable men can be found to throw up their caps in favour of it, or is it sufficiently repulsive to induce them to combine for their mutual protection against an organised band of communists eager for plunder?
