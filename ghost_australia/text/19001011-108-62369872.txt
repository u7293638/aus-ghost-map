WIIIEN SENTRIES DOZE The hour of 4 a.m. has something mysterious aboutit it. Cocks cro'w, pcople on the bril k of death give tup the ghost, ecvryone who is aslkep sleeps sounder, and even thle watchful sentry can't always keep his cycs open. At this hour people are in th ir weakest state, and, if life is just (.n the flicker, it is not surprising that it goes out. Many a man's life has bceen saved by a spoonful of bar.dy and ammonia administered just when the clock strikes four. The period of deepest sleepl varies from three o'cleck to five. An hour or two after going to bed you sic, p very soundly; then your slumbler grows gradually lighter, and it is cagy enough to waken you at one or t?o o'clock. But when four o'clock comes you are in such a state of somnolence that you would take no notice of the end of the world. Military men are well aware of this curious fact, and they often make sudden assaults on camps or cities between three and five, for they know that at that time the most wideawake sentry is liable to doze. Strangely, at the corresponding time in the afternoon, most people feel a bit done up. Whether it is due to the electrical condition of the atmos phere, or to the position of the sun, no one knows. But it is a fact that the nervous system, brain, and lungs are most vigorous from about ten or eleven o'clock (night and morning) to' twelve or one, and at their lowest ebb between three and five.
