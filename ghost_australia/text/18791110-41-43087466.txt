CRICKET. THE OVAL — Satckdxt. 2fbvzxBKK & Saturday last was a day for tall sconns on tae OnL The North Adelaide team made 157 nias against the Kensingtons, and in the other match tbe Hindui&rah; men were at the wickeu all tbe afternoon for 241 TUI1&. .in ii:t- s&iije; j:ia-cu t»k luc -i uiuau cuu ui nit: Oval the North Adelaides wore flrrt at tlie wicket*. They began well, the first wickot realizing 25 runs, the century was passed when only h*lf Uie wicket? were down, and die general dui-Iny of bstlinj: w:u excellent. W. Slight obtained top icore, bnt nn donbtedly the best innings of the Aiy was played by Kobin. who made some sweet drivej, and never coir., milled a ghost of a iiiistake till ho tJUowetl liigaad to level his stumi-s. His 25 includtd 3 fourers. He ns at the wickets about an hour, and when he retired the fieldsmen, as well as the spectators, gave him a hearty cheer. W. Slight played particularly well towards the end of his Innings, when, unfortu nately, he was given run out. He is very unlucky in thii respect, and in this instance there seemed to be a general impression that Mr. Smith had made a mis take in his decision. We mention the circumstance, and also the nnirritten law that where there is a reasonable donbt the batsman shenld always have it Norman's innings was a first-class one, and Phillips and Hill played well tar their highly creditable scores of 26 each. When these two batsmen were disposed of the end soon came. The total had reached H7 before the eighth wicket fell, but the last two or three men did not trouble the scorers much. Sevan got his 7 tuns by two very pretty bits, anil Hill also made the ball travel lung distances. The innings closed for 357 runs. The Kensington team, with an excep tion or two, fielded well Gibbs, as usual, set » grand example to his team, bat their bowling was weak. Caterer once more came off with most wickets and best average— * for 36. Fire tioadlers were tried, and about a dozen changes were made, hut the North Adelaide innings did not close till 5 o'clock. The Kensington batsmen did cot open their performances well. The first wicket fell for 2 runs, tbe second for C, and thu third for 14 ; and the only man who made double figures had three lives given him by A. Slight, the wicketkeeper, who missed two chances given by Lucas in the first over, and another one of stumping him afterwards. Stow also gave an opportunity of stumping, bat young Slight, who otherwise took the bail very smartly, declined to seise it. Just before stamps were drawn for the day Gibbs had a very narrow escape from being run out, as he wag at mid-wicket when tne ball, luckily for him, was thrown dead against the wrong wicket. The North Adelaide bowling and fielding were good, Mitchell coming off best as a trundler. Scores:— NOKTH iLDKLAJDK. Captain, Mr. E. G. Phillips ; Umpire, Mr. Philip Sansom. P. A. Kobra, b.
