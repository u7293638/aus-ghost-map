I:.:.::. '. PORTFOLIO. .WHIT4SUNDAY :I do not think, we can have a better guide for our thoughts than the collect for this day furnishes. In it we call upon God, who did as at this time, teach the hearts of His faithful people by sacding to them the light of His Holy Spirit, and pray that by the same Spirit we may have a right judgment in all things, and ever more rejoice in His holy comfort. Our Lord had spoken to His Apostles of the coming of the Holy Ghost. He had told them of a Comforter who would abide with them for ever ; who would lead them into the knowledge of the Father and of Himself, testifying of Hinm, and bringing all his past teaching to their remembrance. He had called the Comforter who was to come to themn the Spirit of Truth, and had promised that He would guide them into all truth. I need not now go into the way in which this promise was fulfilled. We 'have heard the account of its fulfilment to- day. We know how, in the strength which this new gift conferred, the Apostles wenlt forth everywhere, testifying the glad tidings of the grace of God, and baptising tmen in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. But they dared, and we dare not limit this gift to the first ages of the Church. Whit-Sunday by its yearly recurrence testifies that men in the Ninteenth Cen tury have as great an interest in that day of Pentecost as they had in the first. The promise-" That He may abide with you for ever"-- trancends the limits of the time during which those to whom it was spoken lived. It holds good now. He is with us note as the Spirit of Truth to guide ee into all truth.-" ChArchmml's Mtaz:ine,."
