THEATBE ROYAL. JIAMLGT. Mr Warner's Hamlet betokens careful study, a watchful attention to detail, a just apprecia tion of much though not of all that is compre hended in the character of tho philosophic Dane, and a steady progress in histrionic art. The chief fault of the rendering of Iiamlet by Mr Warner is, that ho makes the character more demonstrative than speculative, deals with its superficies instead of with its depths, esprit of the reflective and retrospective Prinje. I Most actors are tempted to do so, for white the artistic delineation of delicate and subtle shades of character (such as the analytical and scholarly mind of Maeveady qualified him to discriminate and pourtray) arc often unheeded by the audience, a sonorous burst of energetic declamation, oven whero it verges upon rant, is pretty certain to command applause. In liis colloquy with tho ghost tho awe in spiring influences of the scene were well marked, both by the tone and gestures of the actor. Tho play scene was meritoriously wrought up, and Mr Warner's gloating scrutiny of the King's faoo while the player poured ' tho lep'rous dis tilment' into hi3 sleeping fellow's ear, very welt expressed the exultation of the Prince at having 'caught the conscience of the king.' Power, imperfectly disciplined, but replete with pro mise, was manifested in the closet scene, aud throughout the drama, the frequent plaudits of the audience rewarded and sustained the actor in his arduous part. Mrs Thom, as Ophelia, acted with equal ' fervor and prettiness,'' and warbled those wild sweet snatches of song very feelingly and charmingly. The tragedy might bo played moro closely tvith advantage, as one or two scenes dragged heavily, and the whole of- it occupied nearly four hours in its performance ! This evening wo are promised a repetition of the merry travestie of Macbeth, which, if it stood in need of a second' title, might be called ' A Cure for tho Heartache.'
