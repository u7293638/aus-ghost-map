Covering Mirrors After Death. This custom is well known in Scotland, but its origin is seldom understood by those who practise it. To find its explanation we have to look to the beliefs of uncivilised races. The following account of the custom is given by Dr. J. G. Fraser, in his ' Golden Bough ' (vol. i., p. 146) ' We can now explain the widespread custom of covering up minors or turning them to the wall after a death has taken place in the house. It is feared that the soul, projected cut of the person in the shape of his reflection in the mirror, may be carried off by the ghost of the departed, which is commonly supposed to linger about the house till the burial. The custom is thus exactly parallel to the Aru cus tom of not sleeping in a house after a death for fear that the soul, projected out of the body in a dream, r may meet the ghost and be carried off by it. In Oldenburg it is thought that if a person sees his image in a mirror after a death he will die himself. So all the mirrors in the house are covered up with white cloth. In some parts of Germany after a death, not only the mirrors, but everything that shines or glitters (windows, clocks, &c.;), are covered . up, doubtless because they might reflect a person's image. The same custom of covering up mirrors or turning them to the wall after a death prevails in England, Scotland, and Madagascar.' The statement in the last sentence regarding the custom north of the Tweed is confirmed by the la'e Mr. James Napier in his ' Folk Lore in the West of Scotland.' On page 60 of that work he says, ' After death there came a new class of superstitious fears and practices. The clock was stopped, tke looking-glass was coveted with a cloth, and all domestic animals were removed from the house until after tbe funeral.' Mr. Napier does not attempt to explain the practice, but the reason given in Ihe ' Golden Bough ' is quite au adequate one. â€” J. M. i M'Kinuly, F.S.A. Scot. 1
