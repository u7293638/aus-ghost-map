A LECTURE ON SWELLS. 1 Mr Pope's promised lecture on " Swell*" was deli vered on Wednesday evening in the hall of the Mechanics' Institute before & large audience. Mr Lug, die president, took the chair, and introduced the lecturer to the audience, ? The lecturer began by imploring the patience of his audience while he "said a few words before he b^gaa," by way of dry preface to his exposition of the science of swell*. Kan's -wants were few. Skins for clothing, berries or the produce of the hunt for food, water, a cave or a hollow tree for-a dwelling, and his wants were met. This at least was the rudimentary . state. Civilisation, however, made man advance stage by Btage, as the men of genius led cm from one discovery to another, oar age being especially practi cal, and society full of '. puddingologists," who tested every new scheme by its use in * money orlnxury getting sense. Among those who followed the legi timate leaders of society were those "who saw the leaden, were more honored than they, sad iAs caD' eluded, therefore, that the best thing for them, the only resource for them, in fact, geting they frere not clever in reality, was tb~ become swells or images, shams, ghosts, rimulncra of the really devatar leading man. This they became by dresupg, epouting, scribbling, or anything nnder the sun that would answer tfaa purpose. And as som6 of the decencies and most «f the luxuries of. life were brought about by what might be ailed BweffrBhrfflw, and as tbe prod notion of Bald decencies and luxuries gave employment to a large portion of tbe human race, the lecturer trusted that a disquisition on swells: . would.be both interesting and useful : He therefore tmbenittod Jub .^Hematology or discourse on. swells p>' the judgment pnd criticism of the PuddingologiistB.;' As he intended to ppjl » ft spsde, and some of the things to be mentioned were Bot- yeiy sdmjraliRi tb#y would not be called by pretty names, hut 'be trusted notjiiog peally offenBive to his hearers WftjM bpptill.

In conclusion, : the lecturer followed -ap his eatiricaUy bumbR>us iddress by , iaying, that as' it was absiird to suppose' the - 'world could be governed " "by the dangerous minority of Hiinlnqg men/ we irere shut up to a choice of government by the body, the emotions, or the clothes. If by the body, we should not want btdlot boxes or electoral addresses, but only weights and scales, and in the bouse a ring to test the best man or strongest side, [f by the emotions, we should havear^htE-of-woman government, with pork- pie hats ahd extended pave ments for crinolines, for the ladies beat ua in the smotionaL Now, as neither of these would do, we ivere shut up to a govetjment of clothes, ahd the Eashionable swell must .rule the roast. Ujit to be serious, the lecturer hoped, that^ as .ctfl these ,things irould not' make' us happy, the time would come srhen all.the, Ewells in the world would be exlin raiBhe l, when humbug, quackery, and puffing would be swept away, and goodness and virtue be the only things aimed at, and man be whiat he was intended to be., If he hid amused the audience he was content, i and as he had done his very best, it rested with them 1 to say whether he should now say " Adieu," 4>r only " Au revoir." The lecturer resumed his seat amid loud cheers, his address having been frequently applauded during | its delivery. .. , ,. _ Mr Lang, in thanking the lecturer for his address, BxpresBed the hope that he would Boon give another lecture. This sentiment, was loudly seconded by the audience, and Mr Pope having . briefly returned j thanks, the proceedings closed.
