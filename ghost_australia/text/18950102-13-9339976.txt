THE MYSTERY OF BALWYN- HOUSE. A MELBOURNE DETECTIVE STORY. BY LEWIS FINDLAY EAST. Sydney Graham was a colonial, and to say that is to say that he was not superstitious. This everyone will admit. Australian history does not date back to the ages when a belief in supernatural phenomena was almost uni- versal, when the weird legends of ghostly visitants first look shape, to be handed down from generation to generation, and to become almost inextricably interwoven with the truth in the literature of those credulous times. Many of these legends have died with the years, but there are many more which, even in this age of enlightenment still obtain currency and credence in the re- moter parts, and leave their traces, the smouldering embers of a dying fire, in the many superstitious customs and beliefs of even the most advanced of the races of the old world. But superstition cannot live m a young country. Syd Graham ridiculed the idea of Balwj n house being haunted Hie story was this Some ten jears ngo a successful old gold digger bad built the plane, and for a conple of years had lived in it with bia onlj daughter, a lovely girl of eighteen 1 he old man simply worshipped his child nnd was never happy but when in hercompanj But nias, idols of clay aro easily broken In the car!) hours of one Christmas morning, just after the breaking up of a pnrty, he soight her to give he his goodnight kiss and found her l)ing upon the drawingroom iloor, Btill and white, with a dark blue mark upon her temple-dead ! V hen the servants carne into the room they found the old man holding tho dead girl s head upon his knee, with wild, unBcemg eyes, moaning out the grief bo could no more express in words-the old man was mad The awful shock had hurled his reason from her throne and left lum it gibbering idiot All throut.li the long days of the summer he wandered through the garden and the empty rooms of the house seeking someone w horn he never found and moaning as if in pam Sometimes he would pause, listening intenti), tbenuglad look would steal over his face, as though be heard the voice of his loved one, and trembling with joy he would raise his quavering voice and call, "Canna! C-inna I But when no answer came the light would die awn) out of his e)es, and ho would lapse into his old listlessness And when the autumn leaves began to fall the old mun laid bim elovvn, like a tired child, and passed gently nwa) Then Balwyn house was shut np and deserted for no one would live in it And lolks said that on every Christmas Eve a ghostly light might be seen shining from the windows of the silent house mid then flickering from oue room to another And mingling with the moaning of the wind among the trees mifcht be heard the old mans voice calling Cirina!
