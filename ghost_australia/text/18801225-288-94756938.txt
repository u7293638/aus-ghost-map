CAPTIJEffia A GHOST. Paul Cheney sat at his. desk in the schoolroom of a rural district, says the PliUodelphia Press, where he had^ been teaching (to use a well-worn adage) the young idea ho w_ to. «hooti His present task was that of writing a letter to a chum in his city homei u- - i ' No doubt (he wrpteyyou , imagine I am dwelling, in a sortof ^ruifat Arcadia, and just as far ^ as physical nature goes- lam, for there can be nothing more green than the hills, nothing more clear, cool or ^Hmpid, or musical than the brooks tiiat everywhere ribbon the : valleys. Paradise itself could not produce mere life-giving breezes, and yet my life ; is, a burden, because the girls (arid they are greatly /ilie. ma-* jdrity ,o:f my pupils) are |uch wlae-awake,. ' mischief-loving, tormenting beauties as' were'' never befPre given io one person to manage. They will have their own way, and com- ; pletely demoralise the schoor; they tease, coax, and wheedle me out of my most im portant rules, and when endurance ceases to be a virtue cast upon me such reproach ful glances and put up such porting, pr,etty lips that a fellow is tempted to seize his hat and * vamose the ranch,' as they say West, But in spite of my complaints don't imagine me subjugated. I have at last issued positive command for the students not to range off during study hours, ss has been the practice. ;4- A sort of gipsy encampment is located ne^ar an isolated* nook among the hills. Ainong the tribe is an old fortune-teller, aiid of course the pretty heads of my female scholars are completely turned, and i. have not only laid down the law against visiting the camp, but fixed a. penalty thereto.

Of all; the scholars, Sue Was the prettiest, most lovable and most trying. She laughed his most serious and just reproofs to scorn, and when she found he was really wounded, her great 'black eyes would flash up to him through tears and appeal to be forgiven. And somehow his Toice always tuned itself lower when he addressed her, and in spite of himself she managed to throw upon him the solving of all her most difficult problems. She would come up to him with such a pretty pleading pout, with ' My head aches so,' and protest she could not do her algebra unassisted ; or ' Might I not be excused from writing that dreadful composition for jtist this once, please ?' And proriiised to dp anything else lie wished; arid she Iodised, so winsome, pretty and bright. wTien lie yielded, that she usually carried the day. | So, when the master, in aliard, cold voice, commanded the young ladies who were late to school to leave their seats and take ^places . before, his desk, to His surprise, Sue said; something in a whisper to her companions, and came giacef ully and quickly forward alone,, and leaning her white arms upon his desk as. for.

' Yes, sir, if you please,' rnurmui'ed Sue. ' Well, if I don't please? I think.you have sins enough of your own to. answer for, without shouldering those of others.'! ?? 'But really and truly,' pleaded jjshe, with tears in her glorious eyes,; ** I am, alone to blame.

'I will,' promised Sue, but she grew deadly pale to the lips, as he extended his hand to receive hers.
