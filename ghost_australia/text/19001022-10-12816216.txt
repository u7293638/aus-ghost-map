" THE GALVESTON DISASTER. j DETAILS OF THE DAMAGE. J SYDNEY, Tuesday The British Columbia mails, which arrived by the Warrimoo to-day, contain long accounts' of the terrible disaster J at Galveston, but most of the par- J ticulars have already been published The estimates of the loss of life vary, but the majority of the authorities agree in placing those who perished at about 8,000 Between Stawell and Bolivar a relief party found 1,000 bodies lying in the water and on land, mixed up with the carcases of animals, and all decomposing in the heat The property destroyed was over 2-),00Ã¼,000dols The highest portion of the city was 4ft or off under water, while in the great majority of cases the streets were submerged to a depth of 40ft To leave house was to drown, to remain was to court death in the wreck- age The life-saving station at Port Point was carried away, the crew being swept across the bay) 14 miles' to Texas city Might ocean steamers were torn from their moorings and stranded in the bay The Kendall Castle was carried over the flats to Texas city. The Norwegian steamer Gjller was stranded between Texas city and Virginia Point An ocean liner was swirled around through the West But crashed through the bay bridges and was left lying in a few feet of water near the wreckage of the railroad bridge It is safe to assume that one-half of the property of the city is wiped out, and that one half of the residents have to face absolute poverty For 10 miles inland from the shore it is a common sight to see small craft, such as steam launches, schooners, and oyster shops There is hardly a habit- no house in the city, and nearly every business house has been badly damaged Grain elevators were destroyed, one of them containing 1,000,000 bushels of wheat All three railroad bridges and the county bridge across to the main- land at Virginia Point were swept away, and the bridge tenders and their families drowned The work of rescuing the wounded and dying from the ruins of their homes un- covered some terrible scenes Screaming women, bruised and bleeding, some of them bearing the lifeless forms of children in their arms, men, broken-hearted and sobbing bewailing the loss of their wives and children, the streets filled with floating rubbish mingling with the bodies of the victims of the storm, were some of the sights witnessed down the coast from Galveston The town of Dickinson was laid waste , the towns of Alvin, Alta Loma, Texas City, and Brookslure, were wrecked, Richmond was so badly stricken that it will require weeks to clear the town, Missouri City and Stafford, just opposite, were entirely demolished, Cay City, in Matagorda county, was wrecked, with much loss of life Bolivar, Point Quintana, Sugarland, Belle- ville, Wharton, Fairview, Missouri City, Sartartia, Arcola, and El Campo were all heavy) sufferers in point of property destroyed and lives lost The most rigid enforcement of martial law was powerless to suppress plunder- ing by negroes and others. Over a hundred coloured men were arrested, tried by court-martial, and ordered to be shot A wire from Houston states that it is now the haven of many unfortunate people of Galveston Trains have al- ' ready brought in between 500 and 1,000 | survivors A motley crowd they were men bareheaded, barefooted, castles, with swelled feet and bruised and blackened bodies and heads, were numerous, women of wealth and refine- ment, bathes, shoeless, with gowns in shreds, were among the refugees Sometimes there would be a man and his wife and a child or two, but such cases were rare Nearly all of those who came in have suffered the loss of one or more members of their families Their faces were drawn from mental and physical anguish, but there was no complaining A reporter telegraphed from La Porte a fearful story of robbery and mutilation of the dead in Galveston The ghost-like looters were holding orgy over the dead The majority of these men were negroes, but there were also whites who took part in the horrible looting Some of them were natives who had been allowed to go over from the mainland under pretence of doing "relief" work Not only did they rob the dead but the) mutilated bodies in? order to secure booty A party of 10 negroes were stopped returning from a looting expedition They had stripped the bodies of the dead of all sorts of valuables, and the pockets of some of the looters were bulging out with fingers which had been cut off from dead hands because they were so swollen that the rings could not be removed This I gang of looters were all shot down, and it was thenceforth determined that all found in the act of robbing should be summarily shot Not only fingers, but ears were cut off from corpses in order to secure jewels of value The few Government troops who survived the cyclone assisted in patrolling the city and private citizens also endeavoured to prevent robbing of the dead, on several occasions killing offenders singly and in twos and threes Over 50 offenders were thus shot down All attempts at burying the dead at Cal- weston had to be abandoned, and the bodies were disposed of in the swiftest manner possible A few scores were buried , hundreds were taken out to sea and thrown overboard , but it was found that large numbers of the bodies thrown into the bay were washed back upon the shore. The situation was rendered worse than before, and the corpses were taken out in barges and thrown back into deep water It will now never be known how many lost their lives No list of the dead has been kept and it is utterly impossible to formulate one now. The Mayor of Galveston, Mr Jones, states that the dead amount to 5 000, and others place the mortality as high as 10,000
