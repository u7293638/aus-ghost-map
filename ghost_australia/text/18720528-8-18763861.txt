ELECTORATE OF NEWCASTLE. THE NOMINATION The nomination of candidates for the representa- tion of the electorate of N ewcastle to fill the v acancy caused by the acceptance of the office of Postmaster General by the hon G A Lloy d, took place y ester day at the hustings erected in front of the Court House at .Newcastle There was a tolerably large gathering of electors, although not quite so large, and decidedly not nearly so noisy as on the occasion of the last election a few months ago The RBTUBNDÍU OFFICER, Mr J J Shaw, opened the proceedings by reading the writ, and requested that the usual fair hearing would be accorded to each of the speakers Dr BOWKEB nominated their old member, the hon G A. Lloyd as a fit and proper person to re- present the electorate. Mr DAVID GOW seconded the nomination Mr H J BROWN nominated Mr Darnel Mac- quarie Mr JOSEPH GREER, seconded the nomination There being no other candidate proposed, the RK TURNXNG-OFFICKB called upon the candidates to address the meeting The Hon. G A XLOYD who was recuved with loud cheering, commenc-d his address with the re- mark that they had had a Jones m Sydney, and they had bad a Brown ra newcastle, and they only wanted a Robinson to come forward and the opposition to the present Ministry would be composed of Brown Jones, and Robinson (laughter) and he hoped the electors of Newcastle would estimate the value of that opposition according to the character of those three men [Mr CREER Their character is much better than yours. Don't y ou say anything against their character] If Mr Macquarie had sought throughout the whole of Newcastle for two men the most capable of damaging his election he could not have been more successful They knew the old saying that if a lawyer had a bad case he abused his opponent, and that was what Mr Brown had been trying to do, but instead of dome injury to him (Mr Lloy a) it appeared to him that Mr Brown had 4one him the greatest possible good (applause) He bad been told that tins celebrated Mr Brown was the very man who had succeeded ra dis franchising some sixty men whose names were on the roll, through «ome legal tech nicality That wss what Newcastle had to thank Mr Brown for-for taking off the rell the names of some sixty men who were perhaps as capable of exercising their rights and privileges properly as Mr Brown himself was. Mr Brown, had told them that a surgeon sometimes outs off a diseased limb in order to save the body-buthe (Mr Lloyd) had never heard of a surgeon cutting a healthy limb off a sound body , but that was what Mr Brown wanted them to do for .Newcastle He (Mr Brown) had told them that he treated with some contempt the opinions of those who had black faces ra the crowd before him He (Mr Loyd) wondered that Mr. Brown had not the sense to Know that a black face so metimos cover» an honest heart Who was there more honest than a man who earned his bread by tûe sweat of his brow * What mattered a black face if it covered the honest heart of a man who worked hard to support his wife and children ? Mr Brown and his follower-he replly did not know the gentleman's name-had found fault with the Government because they had given an opportunity to their employes and to the Civd Ser- vants to come there and vote-for Mr Macquarie if they liked The Government had not asked those men whom they would vote for, but had given them an opportunity of being present and of hearing what Jar Brown had to say in favour of Mr Mac quane, and of hearing what Mr Macquarie had to say for himself, toen having heard all this the Government gave them an opportunity of exercising their own judgment, and of voting for whom they considered the best man (cheers) Mr Brown had had the impudence-for he could call it nothing else-to tell them that he (Mr Lloy d) ? was placed ra the wrong position as Postmaster General, because he would have ra that capacity the opportunity of getting the earliest information Mr Brown knew very little indeed if he really be- lieved that any man would prostitute so high an office for such an unworthy purpose (applause) He could not but think that Mr Brown had measured lus corn with his (Mr Brown's) bushel (bear, hear) He would now pass from Mr Brown to matters more important He had been before them twice m tlie past and notwithstanding all the influence brought to bear against bim he had been twice elected their representative. He had now come before them again--(_A voice We 11 send you in again, j-He had not the slightest doubt but what that lady bad said was correct and they would send him in again. He came before them again for the third time It waa now two years and six months since they first sent mm ra, [A voice tar too long ] After représent- ons thom for nearly two years be came before tbem and gave an account of his stewardship ra the School of Arts As they would remember, there were nearly eight hundred electors present wh»had re- corded an almost unanimous vote ra his favor (cheers and cries of dissent) After that he had received a letter from the Borough Council of Newcastle, which he had read to tbem before, but it was not very long, and he would read it again - [The speaker here read a letter addressed to him by the Newcastle Borough Council, ra June 1871, thanking lum for his services in connection with the Special Audit Bill, and complimenting him upon his attention to local requirements generally )-That letter was signed ** James Hannell, Mayor * (Cheers and interruption It was only eighty-seven day s since he came before them again, and since they again pronounced a verdict ra his favor, conferring upon him the honor of being their representative by a respectable majonty " Cries of ** forty-two ") What had he done in those eighty seven days, be would ask, to forfeit their con- fidence? Was it that he had had the high honor of being offered a seat ra the Cabinet, and that he had accepted that offer'* If that was the era he had committed it was a sin that every person ra that borough ought to thank him for committing He need not go into details ra these matters, but Mr Brown had said he could not find his (Mr Lloyd's) polio , Lutif he read that very re- spectable paper the Pilot, he would have found there something like three columns of it, but be supposed Mr Brown was too prejudiced to look at that -The last Governmen, as they knew, when defeated went to the country, and asked the country their opinion, but the country pronounced an unmistakeable ver- dict against them. As Dr Lang had said, the other day there never was an instance in which a Government was so smashed before, and there never waB an instance ra which a Government so much deserved it (hear, hear) Many of the members of tile Government, as they knew, could not get back atalL When the question was put to Newcastle, Newcastle expressed the same opinion as nearly the whole of the other electorates did-an opinion ad- verse to the Government, and in favor of a change Mr Macquarie came before the electors in the interests of that Government-[Cries of "No, no "J-If not why did he come at all * [A Toice To oppose you ]-He repeated that Mr Macquarie came there in the interests of tile past Government and they thrashed him as nearly all the constituencies of the country thrashed that Government, and as they would on Wednesday thrash him again (hear, hear) Well, the Parliament met but as soon as the Parhamont did meet the Ministry resigned. The Governor, as they were aware, then sent for Mr Forster and he tried hu best bat faded to form an administra tion. The Governor then sent for Mr Parkes -the man whom the country had pointed to-and he waa not very long ra formmg a cabinet He need not go rato the details of these matters, be- cause he had gene into them before, and he believed they knew alfabout it, he would only say that Mr ¿'arkçs ¡tent for bun, and asked bim if he would ac oept the office of Postmaster General Ha consulted eeveral of his friends who told lum it was the office of ali otherd for which he was best fitted He had therefore accepted the office, and he waa conse- quently now before them to seek re-eloctlon He found he was to be again opposed and by the same man who had opposed him before He did not know, however, why that opposition had been brought forwird It wia not he (Mr Lloyd) who w,u opposing Mr Macqmrie it was Mr Mucquane who waa opposing him (Mr Lloy d) He was in pos- session of the held, but it w is the supporters of Mr M icquarie who were trying to put him (Mr Lloyd) out ox the position which he bad honestly earned ( hear, hear), and with which they had entrusted him over and over again He would say that the opposition raised up against him was not the opposition of Mr Macquarie-that gentleman was a mex^ tool in the hands of others (interruption and applause) Mr Macquarie was a mere stick stuck up ra the hands of other people (interruption) The opposition was the opposition of the late Ministry and it waa lone by them to get Mr Macquarie m as a supporter He thought they would show by theo* votes on Wed nesdajy next that they would not stand such nonsense as that (applause and expressions of dissent) He had been at some trouble to try and find out what Mr Macquaries principles were, he had read Mr Macquaries address very carefully, and all he could find was that Mr Macquarie was the owner of a Patent Slip, and he had two ships upon it That was all he could hud in that address -it was an advertisement of the Patent Slip from beginning to end. Mr Macquarie did not go on to tell them that he would never have had these two ships on his Patent Slip if it had not been for two of his (Mr Lloyd's) supporters It would appear that some friend of Mr Macquarie tqld him that this address would not do if he wanted to get elected, and that he must give some better rea- sons than that Mr Macquarie then came out with an address which was certainly very creditable to the man who wrote it whoever he was, but he (Mr Lloyd) had very strong reasons for ballev rag that it was not Mr Macquarie who wrote it, and that ra fact Mr Macquarie could not have written it (interruption)-[A voice Mr Brown wrote it]-Well he did not think Mr Brown wrote it if his speech that day was to lx taken as a specimen of his ability He was now going to read to them two or three of the leading princmtes. of this address put forth by Mr Macquarie. That gentleman baid he would give to the present administration such support as he thought they were entitled to WeuVthat was just what he (Mr Lloyd) intended to do Mr Macquarie went on to say he waa ra favor of Raüway Extension So was he (Mr Lloyd) Mr Macquarie »aid he was in favor of telegraph extension and increased postal fucdities. That was exactly what he (Mr Lloyd) was in favor of, but there was this remarkable dif- ference between them, that with regard to these last two nutters they were ra his (Mr Lloyds) department, he was Postmastei General, and Mr Macquarie was not (applause) Mr Macquarie said he was in favor of Iree trade on the Border He (Mr Lloyd) was ra f ivor of that also ou the basis of a satisfactory arrangement with the \ ictorian Govern- ment Mr Macquarie was in f&\ or of re-casting the Navigation Act of 1871 So was he (Mr Lloyd) That Act had been passed ra a hu-ry (Oh')-it was passed ra three days. It required amending, and it should be amended (hear, hear) Mr Macquarie wLi the u he was opposed to indiscriminate immi- gration, and he (Mr Lloyd) was also opposed to it He would like to know in what Mr Macquarie t> i sentiments were different from his (Mr Lloyd's), because he had been trying to find out from I that address, and he could not The fact WB» that Mr Macquarie found that the old policy would not do, and that he would nave no hope whatever of being elected unless he came forward and advocated the principles and the policy of the present Govern ment But there was no need for the electors to go | to Mr Macquarie to have those principles earned out they had their own member, and he was in the Cabinet, i where he would have every opportunity of getting thoseprinciplescarnedout Theotherchargebnught I igatnst him was that he was not a local man. and . Mr Macquarie thought he was going to do a great stroke becaiuo he was a locil man and he ^Mr Lloy d) was not Perhaps Mr Macquarie was a little I more of o local man than he (Mr Lloyd) was, because Mr Macquarie bad got a Patent Slip, and he (Mr Lloyd) had not His (Mr Lloyd's) claims to be considered as a local man were these - it was now more than thirty-eight years since he first came among them He had «pent several years. oi his hie at Hinton where he built the first house that ever was built there He bad established the first Suuday school in Morpeth He had taken a wife from the b.ick of Newcastle He had land all around the country He thought he uiijïht nay be had more hundreds uf acres than Mr Macquarie had acres. Mr Macquarie had perhaps as much land as would bold his Patent Slip-[A voice That doesn't belong to him.]-but he (Mr L1o\d)had as much land as would hold a thousand Patent Slips His son waa working hard among them to support his wife and family on the Liverpool Plains. He, himself, had been try rag to do his duty to society he had been married thirty years, rad he had got twelve children (laughter, cheers, and interruption) He thought he had spread his roots pretty deep-there was one of them there (pointing to his son) He appealed to them all, and especially to every young woman m I Newcastle, whether he was not as good looking a | young fellow as any in the county (cheers and laughter) In addition to that, lie (Mr Lloyd) was , a grandfather He had not only children growing up, but ho had grandchildren growing up-and all of I them natives If that did not give him a claim to localism, he did not know what would (cheers and laughter) But Mr M icquarie, when he put his hat on, his roof was shingled (laughter)-he could be off at any moment But he (Mr Lloyd) before lie could start, would have to pull up the roots of the great oak tree which had been exposed to storms and tempests for many years past He would hay that this ques- tion was ra his favour, and if they wanted to study the interests of Mr Macquarie, they should leave him where he is Mr Macquarie hod got his Extent Ship, and it waa no donbt a very good thing but if they wanted it to succeed-as it seemed that Mr Macquarie had the credit of having buüt it-let bim hav e the merit of stopping there to manage it (cheers and interruption) It they sent 3Ir Mac quarte into Parliament he would have to either neglect his Patent Ship or his duty to his constituents Let them remember too that members of Parliament are not allowed to take Government contracts, so that if they elected Mr Macquarie he would not be able to construct their roads and dredges If they bad any regard for Mr Macquarie they should du their best to keep him ra Newcastle, iad not send bim into such au improper position as he would occupy if ho were a member of Parliament la his speech at the last election, after the declaration of the poll, Mr M icqiune attributed his defeat to the railway euiploves, to impersonation, ¿ad to other unfair means He thought, however, that Mr Macquarie had done his best to pay the railway employ es out far it Either Mr Macquarie or some of his supporters had called for an investigation into tlie circumstances connected wath the late eltction An investigation because tha wives of some of those working men had chosen to decorate ?hem by putting a bit of ribhon into their button holes Whoever it was that made it, a charge was made, which resulted m the Minister coming down there, and holding a solemn inquiry into it \ greater farce than that waa never per- petrated in this country, and a greater insult was ndi¡er put upon Newcastle The minister perhaps had never thought of the consequencs that it was likely to put the wives and children of some of those men in dif- ficulties from want of the means uf support, and he (Mr Lloyd) would say that the mm who did that-who made those complaints-ought to be tarred and feathered, and never allowed to show hu> face in Newcastle again But his (Mr Lloyd's) friends had got into office now, and it was no use for the followers of Mr Macquarie to deny what they had done It was only necessary to go down to the office and look over the papen, and it could br* se»n at once who did it (in terruption and applause) They had only got to go to the office and turn over tiV papers, and they could give Mr Macquario all the particulars He would say that the man who would call forth such an in- quiry as that deserved to bescouttd m such a city as Newcastle He could not understand the present opposition to him, unless it was raised by the siunt of vindictiveness He would pledge his honour that all the Government employes in Newcastle might go and vete for Mr M icquarie, and wear hu col irs if they pleased, and he would never bring a charge against them, and that there should not be one single syllable said against them for so doing (cheers) As he had said before, the opposition against him in Newcastle was not so much directed against him as against thB pre- sent Ministry, and he wanted them to dis- tinctly understand the importance of the question Other places had had the same question before them, and they had the result m two instances-he believed he had ra his hand also the result ra other places In the first place, the Prime Minister, Mr Parkes, against whom every in- fluence was used, but the result was that the intelligence of East Sydney sent him in by a majority of 1470-the largest majority ever polled ra the colony (cheers) That settled the question as for as the Prime Minister was concerned, and that ought to have settled the question with the rest At the last general election Mr Parkes beat the then Premier by a majority of 1197 votes, and now he had beatea the man who was put up by the same party by 1470 votes (applause) They knew also that Mr Sutherland was returned unopposed for Paddington (cheers) He had given instructions before he came away from Sydney on Friday night» to have Bent to him the re- sult of of the proceedings going on ra the different places where Ministers were being nominated that day, he had now those results in his hands, and for their information he would open them and reid them He wanted them to under- stand that Newcastle had some interest in this, because if the Ministers were opposed in the other places it would not be so bad for Newcastle to oppose one of them, but if the Ministers were not opposed elsewhere, then it was a shame and a disgrace if Newcastle allowed their Munster to be opposed and defeated The first tele- gram (which Mr Lloyd now opened J stated that Mr Innes was re-elected at Mudgee without oppontion (cheers) They had thought he would have been opposed, but Mr O'Connor, the gentle- man who had contested the seat with him at the last election bad written to the papers stating that Mr Innes occupied such an im- portant position that instead of opposing him, he would go down and vote for lum (applause) Now, if Mr Macquarie had had the good taste to do that it would have been something to his credit (cheers and dissent)-The next telegram was from the Hawkesbury, and stated tliit Mr Piddington was returned without opposition (cheers) The tbird telegram he 8uppo<*ed was from Mr Butler _\o, it was from Mr Piddington himself, stating that he was re-elected without opposition The elections might be considered all over now, for he was happy to say there was no opposition to any member of the Ministry except m Newcastle Mr FarneU's election would come off on the following da\, and there was no fear but what he would be returned unopposed Why should Newcastle be intuited by iir Macquarie coming there and ask- ing them lo stultify themselves by voting against their member simply because he had become a Ministerr1 Was it because he (Mr Macquarie) wanted to stop the march of progress ? Or was it because he was so ambitious himself that he could not stand up and s<e any other man go ahead " But it was not him (Mr Llovd) that Mr M icquarie was opposing it waa the people of Newcastle (in erruptiou) If they listened to the voice of that charmer, charm he never so wisely, they wiuld never regret it but once, and that would be for *\ er afterwards But he did not believe they were so blral as to lisan to any sucl* nonsense as that He would now no briefly into the pohcv «f the Ministry, which he lud already "on*1 into fully, as they would find in the columns of tho Pilot With regard to the Border Duties the present Ministry had not betn in offioe more than two or three days before they sent a despatch to Melbourne, with a view to having the matter satisfactorily settled. Of course he was not at libertv to communicate to them the contents of that desp itch, but he behevad that the matter would bo settled upon a fair andstraight forward basis (hear, hear) With regird to the employment of labor, the post Government had dealt with this question ra a way that deserved great reprehension The present Government however, would endeavor to set that question right Their opinion was that the Go- vernment should have the very beat men that could be got, and that in order to do so they must give them the best pay Tiley would not be justified in giving them higher wages than private firms were paying, for that would be interfering with the rights of capital, but, on the other hand, they would not be justified in paying less than private finn*, for that would be interfering with the rights of labor (cheers) Their principle would be to pay a fair day's wages for a fair day's work Then with regard to the Civil Service for many years past it had been a refuge for the destitute, men were put into offices through the influence of members of Parliament, who were utterly incompetent for the positions they were placed in The endeanour of the present Govern- ment would be to make the civil Bervice a profession for persons to enter at an early age, and ra which they could rise step by step to the very highest offices They would endeavour to prevent such tpporatmenta being made as they had seen for some time past He had heard an anecdote of a person who opposed Mr Parkes, because that gentleman had not pro- vided for his fainüy and friends, whereas on the other hand Mr Robertson had not a son, nephew, >r other relative that he had not provided for ra the Civil Service. " That," said the person, "is the sort of statesman for me " (Cheers and laughter ) The present Government would endeavour to make the Civil Service what it ought to be, a profession for hard working young men to go into, and raise themselves in it He need say but little upon tlie Land question for Mr Parkas had brought forward a scheme which the Ministry would endeavour to put into such a shape that it would give jpportunities for people to have freehold home- steads for one generation at least, and which could not be taken from them by action of the law He ueed not say anything to them with reference to the question of Education, they might be sure that question would be carried out ao that every child should have the chance of being wiser and better than its parents Those ivere gi eat points, and they must now talk firs little while upon some of the smaller points They wanted a new telegraph wire, for their tele- grams sometimes took four hours to go through to Sydney [A voice Half a day ] H-« believed the Government would carry that out ra a short time, ind that within two months they would have that vire in operation He had a scheme ra his head for the extension of the penny postage to all the uumcipalitics around a city, and Newcastle would >i course come in for that They wanted their Boat Harbour put to rights, and he would do what he ould to have that put to rights Then with regard to the Tonnage Dues, he had given evidence of what be intended to do by putting a notice on the ?juainesi paper of the House, on the very day that the House met t° repeal those duties tie had there in his hands a speech made by the celebrated Mr Brown upon the tonnage dues and as it contained one of the few sensible things that gen tleman seemed to have said, he would read an ex- tract Mr Brown pointed out that it would be uecesbary to go to the Premier with a petition, and he (Mr Lloyd) quite agreed ra that opinion, and he would further remind them that if one of the Pre- mier's colle iges was their member, they would be mr more likely to succeed in getting the jray er of their petition granted, aud the tonnage lues ultimately abolished (hear, hear) No doubt their chance of succeeding ra that object «viuld be greatly increased if they returned .13 then* member a colleague of the Premier lhere bad been an article in the Chronicle recently, point- ing out that six ships had lately had to pay large Mims of money ra consequence of these tonnage dues, and giving the figures that would have been «ved if the tonnage dues had not been imposed. But not one of these ships need have paid pilotage lues if their captains had taken the proper steps to * jeeome exempt masters, and had been towed n by the tugs If they had done this, tuey vould have had ¿¿40 less to pay He would ?tay fu-ither respecting these tonnage dues, that ast year a resolution had been passed at a jiteting held in Melbourne, thanking him for the iction he had taken for the benefit of the port of ^ewcasllo and other porta. Paasiug on to other «ubjicLs he would remind them that ho waa ra, favor of the Permissive Bill, and had voted for it ?vhen it was before the House., he was in favor of the Eight-hours BiU (cheers) and when that matter .vos brought before the House he had v oted for that, uid he would vote for it again. But they knew *hat his opinions were, and he need not detain them The colony had arrived at a state of prosperity, every thing was increasing in value and in quality, wool was increas- ing in price, and the tin mines, the tin .nines in that great district, were sending to Sy d ney not pounds of tin, but hundreds of tons, gold mmng was become so important an interest that iozens and dozens of companies were being floated, lud the money, instead of lying idle in tho banks, vas brought out for expenditure upon these mines, ind » ould thus be circulated and tend to enrich every man ra the community, our copper mmes were beginning to show their wealth and their value , the wheat harrest had been so prolific that we had no need to send elsewhere for the supply of the sUff of life, while ia New- castle, in tlie »oil under their feet, they had one of the greatest interests of all, the L.oal-niining interest That was an interest more important than all the rest, for their gold mmes, for instance, could not be worked unless coal were ^applied forthe wants of the machinery In England the coal-raining interest was one of the largest and uost valuable ra the conntry, because it was pro lerly managed, but ra Newcastle a suicidal policy vas pursued which prevented it from attaining its Jue position (hear, hear) There was no reason vhatever why coal in Newcastle should not be sold it ten shillings per ton -It wa» sold at six -een shillings ra England, where labour was auch cheaper-and then the competing com- panies would be able to increase the wages of heir miners, and all the locality would prosper, vtthout the constant grinding down that now goes JO No one wants tiie pnce of coal to be kept down, and everyone would be satis itd to pay ten shillings a ton Now the ínsti ution of good government would lead to bring about JI change ra this respect and at the presont moment Newcastle waa on its trial, the electors were asked to decide whether they would consent to have a mern ber who was also a member of a Ministry, and who lad been spending the past two years and a half in lualifyrag himselt for that position. Would they íave a man who bad raised himself to the position ie (Mr Lloyd) then occupied, or anew manlike Mr M icquarie" It was only reasrnable to expect hat Mr Macquarie would require twelve months jefora he knew the ropes (cheers and laughter ) He would have everything to leam and it would take him a long time to learn it and then, too when any important question was coming on for discussion, they would probably find Mr Macquarie it the North Shore, Newcastle, ra the neigh- bourhood of lus patent slip, mate id of in ay dney, looking after their interests (cheers ind laughter) He (Mr Lloyd) stood before them after having been proposed for the third time by one of the moat popular men amongst them, Dr Bowker (hear, hear), and he stood there having been seconded by Mr Gow, who had on two previous occasi us seconded his nomination He had therefore the confidence of these two gentle- men, and he believed he had also the con- fidence of the majority of the electors, and they would return him by a splendid majority (Hear ) In addition to the support of the two gentle- men he had named, he had also the sup- port of Mr Tighe, as they would see if they would read ra the Newcastle Pilot, a speech equally worthy of Mr Tighe's head and heart Mr Tighe nad seen no justification in this opposi- tion, and could uot understand how it was brought about He (Mr Lloyd) would ask them to endorse Mr Tighe's opinion by returning him at the top of the poll (cheers) They were dealing with rai portant interests, and the opponents ta lus return were strong aud determined, and would not leave a stone unturned to keep him out, they would enlist every one in their service whether living or dead (laughter) The friends of Lloyd must not give the other aide a ghost of a chance, and he hoped that those who had an in- terest ra Newcastle, and a desire to see the coun- try advance, would not be misled by anything that might be Baid, any statement made in the dark, and which could not be sub- stantiated, but would come forward and re- cord their votes for him on Wednesday He would conclude his remarks in the lan- guage of Longfellow [Mr. Lloyd then re- peated some verses of the ' Psalm of Life," and re tued amidst cheers ] Mr MACQUARIE carne forward in the raidßt of a storm of cheers, groans, and confusion, and an under tope of interruption prevailed throughout his speech, rising sometimes into a tumult of uproar which drowned the speakers voice even for the reporters who were close to him He said that be come before them that day to ask them to return bun as their candidate He had been accused of being the tool of others, he threw that átateme nt into the teeth of those who dared to utter it (cheers and confusion) He was not the tool of any man or of any party (cheers), from that platform he had told them on the occasion of the last election, that if Mr Loy d returned to Newcastle for re-election ho weuld oppoBe him again He stood there, that day, therefore, ra fulfilment of that promise, and he chal- lenged any one to deny his right to stand there (cheers and noise) He challenged any one there to tell them what Mr Lloyd liad done for Newcastle (cheers and uproar) He (Mr Lloyd), had said he hod land ra the district (hear, hear) He would endeavourto deal with Mr Lloy d's speech from the end to the commencement Mr Lloyd said he hud land at Lake Macquarie, but what had lie done for Lake Macquarie -1 Had he not tried to open a coal raine there, so as to destroy if possible, the trade of NewcastleJ (uproar ) That s what Mr Lloyd would do for Lake Macquarie if he could accomplish it What had Mr Lloyd said on ' the hustings at the last election 9 Had he not said that the tonnage dues could not be collected -that the law could not force them to be collected13 let the law did come into force , tlie dues ore collected, and the people of Newcastle have to pay for it» Mr. Lloyd told them now to raise the price of the coal, and that such a rise in price would be better for the interests of Newcastle But what would be the result if they took Mr Lloyd's advice? Why ships would go to Sydney for their coal, and Mr Lloyd's friends who nave coaliuues in the South would benefit (Cheer* and uproar ) He tried to b imboozle thuu into raiding the pnct. of co Us in order that his friends in Sv dney might reap the ad vant ige and he had leagued himself with a mm who had avowed tb it he was in favor of reducing the wages of labourers (uproar and cheers) and he wonld now help th it gentleman to cirry out his policy, the sutuc pohev that he (Mr Llovd) had expies-ed when lu introduced his bill for immigration , the only thing he had done ra the House, too and it cer araly did not redound to Ins credit (gre it uproar, and cheers for the speaker) Mr Lloy d h id promised togetthemabo it h irbour,but the prisent bo it b »rbour had been in the hame disgrace ful átate for two or three years past, and Mr Lloyd hod never moved hand or foot to have anything done to it His promises had been m ide to hoodwink the electors, but he h id not done any thing, and when he (Mr Macquarie) a private individual, had made representations to the Government about the disgraceful con- dition of the barbour, no reply had been sent for several nion'hs. and finally an answer came to s iy that nothing could be done, Now why_ had not Mr Lloyd done something in this matter ? [Woice He was not in a position] Still they must judge of Mr Lloyd by what was put He (Mr Macquarie) came before them an independent man, he had in tere» ts to protect and rights to assert which were identical with theirs (confusion) it was said that he had no parliamentary experience, but had Mr Lloyd any experience when brst elected?
