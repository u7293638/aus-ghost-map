« GHOST" AT WICK. ELSTERN- Considerable alarm has been experienced in the Elsternwick district for some time past by the unexpected appearance at night time in lonely parts ol the district of a fignre clad in white and with a strangely illumined face. Several well authenticated cases, in which persons have seen the perj e^rator of this m's- •chievoos and dangerous freak, have been reported to the police. Efforts have been made to capture the culprit, but have proved unavailing; as the person is astute enough to keep dear of any men, and only appears before unaccompanied women or girls. The subject was re- i ferred to at Wednesday's meeting of the Caulfield Council. Councillor Sharp mentioned that a number of women had been seriously frightened, in fact one lady had died partly owing to a fright is wife and a servant had also seeu the ghost,' and the lattér bad become seriously ill in consequence. It -was eventually agreed to offer a xeward -of £10 for the attest, of the cnlprit •. ' '
