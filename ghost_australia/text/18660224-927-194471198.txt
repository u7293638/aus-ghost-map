You know what I mean i' 'Of course: swinging with hooks fastened in their flesh.' 'Precisely. Nay, I have heard, but will not vouch for the fact,' continued Mr. Bowman, gravely, ' that on ouu occa sion, a worn-out I5lackw\ll omnibus was purchased at Aldridge's Repository by a number of Hindus. Can yon guess their object, Mr?. Miles?' ' I can,' I answered with a shudder — ' for a Juf gomaut car.' 'Just so,' said Mr. Bowmau. 'The massive figure-head of a condemned East Indiaman served for tho god ; while the omnibus, crammed with yelling devotees, was driven up and down the confined spaco of that backyard. To depict such a scene, with ita combined elements of grotcsquerie and horror, would require the pencil of a Fuseli.' Compared with this exciting conversa tion, how tame and prosiac sounded our neighbours' dialogue ! 'The only real opposition proceeds from Jackson,' I heard Mr. Gage say. 'Everybody else has beeji bought off. ?We've offered him a station close to his park-gates, if he likes, but he wont listen to it,' ' His ideas must be very old fashioned,' observed Julia, quietly. I forgot to say that Mr. Gage and Julia were lovers, and that this was their way of courting. When I think of my dear George, and remember bis romantic senti ments, hia cbivalric enthusiasm, so accord ant with my own feelings, I cannot be too thankful that— but I will say no more on that subject. For a wonder, there was no dinner-party that night, and wo passed a very pleasant and quiet evening: that is to say, Sir Peter dozod comfortably in an arm chair by the fire, with an antimacassar over his head ; Lady Peckover examined a formid able pile of red-covered tradesman's books; Julia practised choice morceaux from iiirella on the pianoforte ; and I composed a delightfully long letter (four sides of close -writing and crossed) for dear George, in exchange for his shabby little epistle of ten lines, which was all occupied with the description of a gigantic pike which he had captured. About eleven o'clock, we all went up stairs ; but I sat up till twelve brushing my hair, and reading a choice packet of George's love-letters — models of manly devotion and — but I forbear. My fire had begun to bum low, as a hint that I had better go to bed ; and I had just folded up the last of these be loved letters, when suddenly I recollected that I had left my work- box down stairs. I did not like to leave it there till morn ing, for it contained a bracelet which was George's first present, and I could not have slept quietly if it had not been in my own keeping. It was very provoking, for at the Peckover's house there is nothing but gas burned — gas in the kitchen, iu the sitting-rooms, and in the bed rooms. If there had been a wax-taper in the room, I should have lighted it, of course ; and if there had been a box of lucifers, I should have taken them with me ; but there was no taper, and not a single match in the ornamental box placed on my dressing table. I did not care . to carry a lighted allumette in my hand, for fear of setting firo to Sir Peter's beautiful carpets ; so I determined to go down in tho dark. I remembered exactly where I had left the workbox : it was on the left-hand corner of the Louis-Quatorzc table in the break fast parlour ; I felt that I could lay my hand on it at once. My heart beat a littio quicker than usual as I descended the stairs, everything seemed so preternaturally quiet ; but I reached the breakfast-parlour in safety, felt about for the Louiu-Quatorze table, discovered it, and fonnd my work-box. I was just about to quit the room, when I heard a slight noise outside, which startled me terribly ; it was as if somebody had dropped two or three spoons and forks. I felt half inclined to fkinL, and opened the door as noiselessly as possible. My attention was immediately attracted by a light, -which streamed out from under a closed door in the passage. 'Perhaps, after all,' I said to myself 'I have alarmed myself needlessly. I remember now that that is the pantry-door; and no doubt Mr. Jeakes, the butler, has sat up late to-night gossiping, and is now counting his plate.' Tho thought had scarcely passed through my mind, when the door opened slowly, and a figure appeared, bearing is one hand a kitchen candlestick, in the other a plate-basket full of silver. Was it the figure of any person in the house i If it had been, my knees would not have trembled under me, nor should I have sunk down upon the floor in a semi-unconBcioua swoon. At length, by a strong mental effort, I recover ed sufficient strength to raise myself up ; and nervously clutching my work-box, I made my way slowly up stairs. As soon as I entered my room I locked and bolted the door, and then sat down in a chair to reflect The fire had gone out, but the gas, which I had turned up to ita highest point, made the room look bright and cheerful. I looked at the clock — it was past one. I must have lain for upwards of an hour in the half -fainting state. It was too bite now to alarm the house. The mischief was done ; and the perpetrator of the deed had doubtless long since departed with his spoil. Besides, to tell the truth, I did not dare venture oat into those long dark passages again j so I crept into bed. CHAPTEE II. 'This is a most extraordinary story, my dear Isabella,' said Lady Peckover to me, as she slowly and majestically descended the stairs on the following morning. ' Neither Sir Peter nor I heard anything, and I am the very lightest of sleepers. Nor did Bunce [this was the lady's-maid] report anything wrong when she came in with the hot water. However, here is Jeakes ; we will question him.*' Mr. Jeakes -was a portly person, with a bald head, a reddish nose, and a most formal style of address; in fact, the very beau-ideal of a butler. 'Jeakes,' said Lady Peckover, 'were the doors all properly fastened this morning ? ' ' I've beard no complaint to the contrary, my lady 1 ' ' None of the plato missing 1 ' ' Dear me ; no, my lady,' answered Mr. Jeakes, with almost an injured air. ' I count it overnight, and again erery mom ing regular Jit height o'clock.' ' There, Isabella! ' said Lady Peckover, turning to me ; you see, my dear, you must have been mistaken. It wa-s most likely an attack of nightmare.' 'I assure you,' I began. But Lady Peckorer gave me a meaning glance, as much as to say : ' Speak no mora about it in the presence of the serrants.' When breakfast was over, and Sir Peter had gone to the City, and the servaut3 had left the room, Julia said : ' Mother, what is this mystery between yon and Isabella I I heard you talking about it as I was coming dowa stairs.' ' Merely, ray dear, tbat your cousin dreamed she saw a thief last night stealing the plate.' ' Dreamed ! aunt ? ' I exclaimed. ' The proof that it Was only a drwm, my dear Isabella,' answered Lady Pc:k over, ' is that the plate is in perfect order. As soon as I had beard your account, I felt it would be satisfactory to Jeakes that he should count over the spoons and forks in my presence. He did so, and none were missing.' ' But what was your dream, Isabella ? ' asked Julia, ' It was nn dream at all,' I said, quite pettishly, ' but a real occurrence. I went down stiirs about twelve o'clock to fetch my work-box, and saw a man come out of the pantry with the plate basket in his hand' ? ' The curious thing, Julia,' interrupted Lady Peckover, 'is, that Isabella persists in saying he was a black man with a turban on his head.' ' I can explain it all,' exclaimed Julia triumphantly. ' He was like the crossing sweeper in Gormandy Square, wasn't he 1 ' ' Yes, very like,' I replied, ' An excellent illustration of the theory of dreams ! ' cried Julia. ' You were talking to me about the crossing-sweeper yesterday, and I beard that silly Mr. Bow man telling you a number of apocryphal anecdoteB on the same subject. You possess a vivid imagination, my dear Isabella — I envy you tho gift — and the result is, that your waking thoughts form the subject of your dreams.' ' Really, cousin, you are very provok ing,' I said vehemently. ' I suppose you won't believe that I came down stairs at all hut night.' ' Of course I don't,' she answered. ' I believe your dream visited you when you were snugly in bed.' At these wopds I rang the bell. ' Why are you ringing toy dear?' asked Lady Peckover. ' Because I want Mrs. Bunco's evidence to support mine.' ' I am particularly anxious not to make a fuss about this,' said Lady Peckover. ' We shall end in making all the women servants so nervous that they will be giving me warning.' 'Bat, my dear aunt,' I. replied, 'I want to clear my character. I cannot bear to be looked upon as a silly school-girl, magnifying a mere dream into a real occurrence. Now, Julia, you don't believe that I ever went down stairs at all lust night — I say I did ; and as a proof of if, I could only find one of my slippers when I got up this morning. I then remembered that when t swooned, one of them came off, and as I was in too great a fright, on coming to my senses, to look . for it, I hobbled up staias without it Oh ! here is Mrs. Bunce.' 'Bnnce, said Lady Peckover, 'where did yon find ono of Mrs. Miles's bedroom slippers this morning 1 ' ilfc' The housemaid found it, my lady, the first thing this morning, in the breakfast parlour. 'Now, Julia,' I exclaimed, 'will you believe that I went down stairs f ' ' I begin to think there is more in this than a mere dream,' said toy couBin thoughtfully. ' I am doubting whether it may not be a case of spiritual . manifes tation.' ' Fiddlestick !' cried Lady Peckover. 'Isabella,' pursued my cousin, 'pos- sesses just that susceptible sort of organi sation to which the spirits love to render themselves visibla' ' Nonsense, Julia 1' said Lady Peckover sternly. ' You are frightening Buuce ; she is growing quite pale. What's the matter, Bunce V ' Nothing, my lady,' answered Mrs. Bunce submissively ; ' only I hope Mrs. Miles haven't seen the ghost.' 'The ghost!' exclaimed my aunt an grily. ' What nonsense is this, Buuce V ' The ghost of the Black man, my lady,' said Bunce, rather unwillingly. The lady's-maid's words took us all aback. Nobody had disclosed to any of the Bsrvauts the nature of tho appearance. which I had seen, yet Mrs. Bunco had at once guessed it correctly Even Lady Peckover looked rather uneasy, while Julia seemed pleased, as if she expected some confirmation of her spiritual theories. ' What is this story, Bunce 1' she asked. ' Well, miss, IVe never seen anything myself, and Mr. Jeakes and John Thomas the footman told us women-servants to say nothing about it, for fear of frightening the family ; but as Mrs. Miles has seen some* thing, I don't mind mentioning what Mr. Jeakes told me. He says : ' Mrs. Bunce,' says he, ' I should advise you as a friend, being a lady of delicate nerves, not to go down to the basement story, nor, indeed, on the gronud-floor, after the family's abed.' ' Why not,' I says, ? Mr. Jeakes J1 1 Because,' he says, ' the Black Man ia re puted to walk.' And then he told as this story. The first tenant that occupied this house was a Colonel Colpeppcr, a terrible passionate gentleman, as I've heard is the case with most Indian gentlemeo, always excepting Major Miles, who is the sweetest tempered of ' ? ' Never mind my husband, Mrs. Bunco,' I said. ' Go on with your story.' ' Well, miss — ma'am, I should say — the the' colonel had a black servant whom he treated very cruel indeed. Nothing came amiss to throw at him, -when the colonel was vexed. Paper-weights, dish-covers,' books from the circulating library, any thing. Ona daj he threy the clothes brush at him. The ]-oor black m.in took ti) his bed, and died. An inquest was held, miss, as was only right and proper ; but tliu colonel who was rolling in iuoney( bribed the parish beagle, and he sum monsed s [lacked jury, composed entirely of retired civilians, who returned a verdict of Hunstruke, caused by the peculiar effect of the British sun in January on the Hindu constitution. And now, as Mr. Jeakes says, his spirit goes perambulating about, demanding justice.' ' What became of Colonel C'ulpepper ?' askeil Lady Peckover. 'Took ill directly after, my lady,' replied Mrs. Bunco in an awful voice ; ' and died in a state of taving madness in tho Charing Cross Hospital, with a strait waistcoat on, and two medical students holding a feather-bed underneath the win dow perpetually, for fesr lie should leap out.' As soon as Mrs. Bunce had concluded her story, and retired to her own domain, Lady Peckover said : ' It is extraordinary how superstitious uneducated people still arc ! Bunce tvidcntiy believes tins absurd tale.' ' I am inclined to believe it also, mo ther,' observed JuJia. ' These phenomena, singular as they may seem, arc in strict accordance with natural laws, if we could but ascertain what these laws are. I am only surprised that the colonel's spirit does not manifest itself as well as that of the Hindu.' ' 1 should bo very much surprised, Julia,' I commenced quietly, ' if it did, considering that Colonel Culpepper is still living.' ' Still living !' exclaimed iny cousin. ' Yes — at Cheltenham. He is an old friend of my mother's family, and though a little impatient in temper, one of the kindestaof men. I believe Mrs. Bunce's story to be a cruel libel, and for the sake of Colonel Culpepper's reputation, I am de termined to find out the truth of this affair. — You cannot help allowing, my dear aunt,' I said, ' without agreeing in Julia's supernatural view, that there is something more in it than a mere dream ?' 'There is,' answered Lady Peckover ; ' and I assure you, my dear, it makes me feel thoroughly uncomfortable.' 'Then I shall insist,' I said, 'on George's coming back to town at once, and assisting me to ferrit it out' CHAPTEE III. George was a little unwilling to leave his pike- fishing and his clergyman (I confess I felt rather jealous of that clergyman), but he is such an excellent self-denying crea ture, that he was as amiable as possible when he returned. He had been away for nearly three weeks, and it was so pleasant to feel my hand once more resting on his arm when we went out sight-seeing, instead of being dependent on Julia, who really wears such preposterous skirts (al though I try to impress upon her that the, fashion is changing), that it is difficult to get within a yard of her. George listened most patiently-to my account of the ghost stor)'i and I could perceive a clever sort of twinkle in his eyes when I had finished it, as much as to say ; ' Trust me for unravel ling tho matter.' Then my dear husband spoke thuB : ' Write a letter to Colonel Culpepper, detailing tlio lady's-maid's story, and ask for an immediate reply. Don't let the servants see the letter, but drop it into the pillar-box at the street comer.' I did as my husband bade me ; and three days afterwards received the follow ing reply, brought by a commissionaire of tho Oriental Club : My dear Isabella,— I certainly did not expect 'that the first letter written to me by you since your marriage would con tain an accusation of 'aggravated man slaughter,' but so it is, and you will perhaps be surprised to learn that I think the charge sufficiently grave to require my presence in London for the purpose of re butting it ; so I have come up from Chel tenham; and if your husband (whose acquaintance I wish to make — I knew his father during the first Burmese war) will give me a call at the Club this evening, I think our two wise heads may devise a scheme which will effectually absolve me from having to sign myself the 'con- science- smitten murderer.' Ferdinand Cotipepper. When George came home that night, he whispered to me : ' Dbn't say a word to uncle, aunt, or Julia, about Culpepper's arrival. And now, Bella, would you like to sec the ghost again V I shuddered slightly, and answered: ' Dear George, I think I would rather not.' ' Because I have a notion,' he continued, ' that it may walk to-night . Culpepper is coming here to try and get asight of it. I am to let him in quietly at the front-door about half-past eleven.' ' Do you know, George,' I said gravely, . ' Colonel Culpepper's conduct makes me feel, very uneasy. I cannot bear to think it of such a nice old gentleman, and yet I can't help fancying there is some founda tion for that dreadful story of Mrs. Bunce's.' . George's reply to this was a burst of laughter, which ho checked suddenly, and then said in a hollow voice : ' In good truth, there is a very serious foundation for that story.' ' O George,' I exclaimed, ' you make me feel as if you had put a cold key down my back ! ' I am getting quite ncr .V0U3. ' , ' Then you had better not stop to see the ghost, dear Bella. Go up stairs, and get ready for bed. But don't make your self thoroughly deihabillee — I may have occasion to summon yon and the rest of the family between this and morning.' After imploring George to be careful, I crept unwillingly up stairs, waving my hand over the bannisters at each successive landing, until the dear fellow was - no longer visible. I then entered my bed room, and sitting dowu in the easy-chair by the fire, pretended to read a book. It was of no use ; I could not read, so, in stead of reading, I set my door ajar, and listened intently. The Peckovers are early people when they have no company, and by half-past eleven the house was perfectly qniet The French clock on my mantelpiece bad just chimed the half-hour, when I heard the front door opeued in a very stealthy man ner. My femalo curibusity could resist no longer, and I stole dowu stairs, hiding my self in an especially dark angle near the drawing-room. I heard Colonel Culpepper's j well-remembered voice ; I also beard ! George whisper to him : ' Better take off j your boots, Colonel. Here are a p3tr of j list slippers.' From the smothered merriment which proceeded from the two gentlemen, I judged that the Colonel had seated him self in one of the hall chairs, and that my husband wa3' acting a3 bootjack in ordinary. There was ;i long pause after this, during which I had gradually descended still nearer to the unconscious ghost-watchers. Presently George whispered : ' Colonel, d'ye see that light over the kitchen stairs ? He's come '' At these terrifying words, I fled up stairs, three steps at a time, with n horrible dread that some skeleton form was clutch ing at my skirts. I did not feel safe till I had put a double-locked door between myself and the supernatural world outside. More than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when a series of rapid footfalls were heard in the passage ; and Something began to twist the handle of my door ; my heart died within me, and I had only strength to murmur : ' Who's there ?' when my husband's voice said : ' Why, Bella, are you asleep. Open — quick.' ' I believe I said : Why didn't you knock, ducky ?' and almost fainted on bis shoulder. ' We'fe managed matters capitally down below, said George ; ' and now I've roused up uncle and aunt, and Julia, and Jeakes, and Mrs. Bunce ; in fact, the whole house hold. Put a shawl round your shoulders, and come down to the breakfast-parlour as soon as you see Sir Peter and ray aunt march forth. I've told everybody that they needn't hurry — that it isn't fire, and that they can make themselves look as elegant as they please.' At length we all assembled. ' George,' said Sir Peter, rather surlily, as he sup pressed a yawn, ' I hope this is not inten ded as a practical joke.' '0 uo, sir — nothing of the sort,' replied my husband. ' I have invited you all down stairs in order to shew you the celebrated Black Man.' I glanced round the room at these words, and observed with some surprise that while the countenances of all the others expressed merely curiosity or aston ishment, there was a look of guilty appre hension in the face of Mr. Jeakes, the butler, and of his subordinate, John Thomas, the footman. ' Before proceeding further,' continued my husband, ' you must allow me to call an important witness into court — Colonel Culpepper. ' At these two words, pronounced in a loud tone, the door was opened, and Colonel Culpepper entered, bowing gravely and ceremoniously to Sir Peter and Lady Peckover. ' Sir Peter,' said the Colonel, 'you must pardon my intrusion into your house at this unseasonable hour ; but I wish to clear my character from a stigma that has been cast upon it. I have been accused by your butler yonder of having died in a state of insanity, after murdering my Ben galee man-servant, Bamchunder. The story of my death is manifestly untrue. If you, Sir Peter will have the kindness to unlock the pantry-door, you will be able to decide on the remainder of the allegations.' At these words, we all crowded into the passage, where George had turned the gas on brilliantly. Sir Peter unlocked the door, and disclosed to view the trembling figure of the crossing-sweeper of Germany Square.' ' Now, ladies and gentlemen,' said Co lonel Culpepper, 'that is Hamchucder, whom I was forced to dismiss from my service for making too free with, my spirit chest, as well as for other irregularities. Speak English, Kamschunder, and say if that be not true.' ' Iss, sahib,' answered Bamschunder, joining his hands together, after the im ploring fashion of Asiatics. ' And now, uncle,' interposed my hus band, ' I will tell you what we found this worthy gentleman doing ; we found him doing the butler and footman's work — cleaning the plate and brushing your clothes.' ' Is this true V demanded Sir Peter magisterially. -' Is3, sahib,' said Bamschundcr. ' Mas'r Jeakc, he said he very much tire ; Mas'r Thomas, he say he very muck tire too ; He say : 'You nigger, I give you two shilling a week to do my work.' What could poor Ramchunder do! He very bad off now since leave good Colonel Sahib : sweeper's trade bad now, plenty March wind. Gentlefolks say : 'No dirt now — no copper sweeper give.'' ' Well, Jeakes, what have you to say to this V asked the master of the house. ' I don't deny it, Sir Peter,' said Mr. Jeakes with a dignified suavity of manner ; ' but I can't 'elp asserting, Sir Peter, that you brought it on yourself by the non providing of a boy in buttons. Me and John Thomas will not demean ourselves by vulgar work, such as plate cleaning, knives, and clothes ; and we thought we was doing a hact of charity by employing this pore benighted heathen for such hinferior occu pations.' It is uot necessary for me to state who was dismissed and who was not ; it is enough to say that the house was never afterwards haunted by the Black Man.
