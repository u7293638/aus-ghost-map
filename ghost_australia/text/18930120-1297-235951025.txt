to the editor of the daily telegraph. Sir,— Seeing the interest you take in pass ing events is my excuse for trespassing upon your valuable time. AU sorts of schemes are mentioned, and in all conscience our 44 in- cubus " of a civil service fairly invites attack ; but of course we are not likely to see a Go vernment who will dare to apply the pruning knife. Wholesale savings could of course bo effected in all departments, and many of our departments could, with advantage to all, be swept away entirely, even though a legion of paupers and hangers-on — for whose solo benefit whole departments were created— should be left to work for their living. Pay ment of members, running of night trams, bonuses to pipe and candle makers — but, no ! I must not enumerate, the list is too long. I read your remarks in yesterday's paper about our Stato schools ; this is, I know, a sacred subject, which can only ho men tioned with bated breath, lest the Kiuma ghost should 44 appear," as he often did, when tho pet 44haot" hits been in danger. For years it has been evident that tho weight of this iniquitous measure would drag it down, and surely now, when public dislionor is staring us iu tho face, we should look at the matter from a common- sense point of view. The system costs now about £1,000,000 yearly to educate about 50,000 children— say, £20 per head, and it is well known that our wealthiest people edu cate their 44 curled darlings" at our high schools; even our 44 poor working-inau," if he could do with less beer nnd tobacco, should pay for tho education of his children. We are making paupers of our people, and. what is worse, the whole scheme was started in avowed bigotry or hostility to one section of our people, and since then it has, with the Kiama ghost, been fastened on us to our utter disgrace. — Yours, etc., JOHN SMITH, Cougewoi.
