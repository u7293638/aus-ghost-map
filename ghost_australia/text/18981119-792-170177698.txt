CLOSING THE BIBLE. Bombay Catholic Examiner.") We fully agree with the remark of the " Church Progress " that Protestantism has -closed the Bible to its ad- Jierents ; for ,lt has rejected the teachings of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost's interpretation of His own •words, and burled the Written Word of God deep in the mire of its own evil traditions, so that the Bible 5s as effectually taken away from the victims of 'the Protestant madness as if jtTVere blotted out of existence. Prot- $&tautfl; read the New Testament as the Jewish Scribes studied the Old, with scales on their eyes and a veil on tlieir heart; " lest, they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and tho Lord should heal them." The sectaries possess only the mutilated letter, the broken shell of the Holy Books, 'l'ne spirit, the meaning, the essence of them has been lost. Thev think that they caii find the meaning by study of the documents, in the original languages, with the aid of the latest critical apparatus; but empirical science can no more find the truth in the Bible than it can find the soul in, the body. " God Is his own interpreter;" the only way to have the Bible opened to one's understanding is to read it In the light of faith. Only those who possess the faith of tho Apostles and Evangelists —In other words, who are Catholicscan understand their words. To true Catholics the words of inspiration have always been the most precious of all words, and the books of Inspiration the most precious of all books. Before the Protestant Revolt learning was far more esteemed than it is now, ami the masses of the people were far more cultured. Those were the days when Bibles were kept chained in public places, so that all who passed by might refresh their souls by perusing the sacred oracles of the New Covenant.
