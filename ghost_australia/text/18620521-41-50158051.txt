CEMETERIES BILL. TO THB EDIXOE OF THE EEGISTER. Sirâ€” Surely your ghostly correspondent of this morning does not mean to affirm that it is a violation of religious liberty for the Govern ment to renuire that where taxation is gathered from all tbe object to which the tax is applied shall be imperatively open to all; or, on the contrary, that it would be consistent with liberty that an Episcopalian of either the Roman or English communion should receive a grant of land from the public and ' then exclude from burial all but those of hb own sect. Exclusiveness can only righteously be main tained where private funds have purchased and private funds maintain a cemetery. Surely the ghost has been eo long a ' dis embodied thing of air' that he has forgotten all his former mundane experiences. Yours, &c;, PRESBYTER. Adelaide, May 19, 1S62.
