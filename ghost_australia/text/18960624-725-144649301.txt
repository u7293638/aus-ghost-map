Unfortunately, sherry is forbidden me by my doctor i but my don oonddecs It very fine. I should like your opinion on it.' ' He poured out the sherry* and Bryant drank it. He said tiiat' it was exoellent, ; because be' did not Very well know bow to say . anything else, but privately he did not like it. It was a strong, full-bodied, dark colored wine, , but there was an after-flavor about it that struok him as disagreeable. * TO1 you joitt me in the ^ttden wiUi a cigarfinqalied Mr. Kirby. ' ^Thanks. t never smoke till tiie evenmg. H you will allow me, I will go to my room to wzHe'a letter.' Aa he left tbe room by one door Mr. Erby went out'by another, and Bryanfs eyes met Enid's. ' j He read their meaning, and, after a lew moments' delay in his room to make sure ; that bis host had left the house for & stroll in ^ the garden, be oame.down»ptdn again and went into Ibe library. ' I will be there in good time,' he thought, with a certain vague tremor of excitement ; but the room was empty, so be Sat down in a comfortable-looking arm-chair to wait for her. v And then and there a most curious' and unusual thing happened to bim. He became ; overpowered by an ever increasing sensation I of numbness and of lassitude. For some moments be fought againBt it, but soon a delightful dreaminess stole all over his limbs ! and be struggled no longer to reset it. He seemed to be asleep, and yot not aeleep, for all the time he was conscious of being still in , the libraiy, and he could see the table by whudf be 'was' seated, -with the. books an-L papers upon it, and the ftiokering fire in the grate; yet everything seemed in be -dim and tar away, like objeots that are Been through' ufog.. ' '' '? ' r-''' Then some one whose volbe sounded faint and distant like tho sound of muffled bfills Geemed'to be speaking to him._ 1 1 am the most wrotohed woman in the whole world !' murmured that voice, dimly. * For God's sake rouse yonrself and listen to uie. I have no one . on earth to help me. Forpity Vsaketry and understand.' These Bentenoes seemed to go .brokenly for sometime; thai they died: away into a sort of throbbing nothingness, and he heard them no longer . ? - - , Absolute ' peace, And absolute silence. Then* after what might bave beeiL whole years of utter blankness, &ere; oan&middenly; a rushing noise in his earsv and a'tingling sensation in. all bis veins, then the jarring soundof laughter close beside him. He sat up inbis^chair. Mr. ESrby stood ? oppbritetomm, laughing heartily. * Ha, ha, ha I Awake at last !' he oned, ^M^Jod gracious I What has happened to | mef etammered Valentine, bewUderoily, | paraifig his banda over his ^brow tf&d; ey&s; -'i ~ VKotiutog at all.

As she rose from the table she looked at 1 bim, and her eyes seemed, to bis excited fancy, to be full of reproaoh aud sadness. A few minutes later, regardless of his host, he ro4e aud followed her into thf» drawing-room. She was standing on the hearth- rug, gazing absently into the fire. Bryant mide a couple of quick strides to ber side. He had left Mr. Kirby looking up the wine in the oellar ette. It w«b now or never ; he had nn time for flowers of speech and oeremony. *1 failed you to-day,' he said, in a rapid whis per : * you oan't think bow sorry I am. It was not my fault/ 1 1 knew you cOuld not help it. It is all a piece with the rest,' she added, enigmatically and 'almost despondingly* 'If I coula only understand,— if you could only explain,' be said, in a .puzzled way. The ghost Of a smile played over ber [ features : * I tried to to-day, but you were' | past ' bearing me, and : now the qbanoST' te I gone.' And she glanoed -norvoutly' towards j die open door. ' ' Then he remembered tbe pleading voioe in his dreams,— the voice which bad entreated bim to listen and to understand. Was it no d roam-fancy, but a living reality, then? And it was Enid, who bad spoken this iu vain? With a passionate intensity born of the horrible feeling that he bad been trieked and outwitted, he caught the slender band that was hanging idly at ber side, and pressed it earnestly. * If I can serve you or help you, I entreat jrpu. to command -roel' be-eald, almost, breathlessly. ' ' ' She looked up at bim swiftly; ber whole -face became lit up, hgr; eyes 'shone: her lips smiled, .there was hope and gladness in every radiant feature. 4 Do you mean it. really, really P . Will yoa ~be my friend f Promise it, quiokly 1' * I promise it — I swear it, upon my honor!' he snswerod; fervently. Her hand drom-ed out of bis ; ber face re sumed its normal pale and almost hopeless apathy ; her eyes glanoed beyond him .fo rwards the door. *1 will remember,* she said* almost in* audibly. (Imay want a friend soon, very soon* Then she crouched down and wanned ber bands at the fire. At this moment Mr. . Kirby joined them. ^ . CHAPTER IE. One evening about a week later Bryant found himself standing, precisely at eight 6*blobk, npon the' ' door-step of ^o. 26. Hsilkin Street, Of all the m&ny; Jionses at wbioh be was aooustomed to dine, there was -ndhd at which it gave bim greater pleasure to present himself as a guest. Mr. andMra. Challenger were .the greatest friends he bad iu the world, and Mrs.' Chal lenger was certainly the only woman iu his life whose society gave him any real plessure. ; She was the dearest woman on earth, be Was wont to assert, and her house was the very nioest in all London. v She had everything? that could recommend ber to his esteem and appreciation. She waB a smart, well-dressed little woman, with a sufficiency of good looks to render ber attractive; ber conversation was clever and: I original, her views on all subjects were broad : and liberal ; and above all, and over all, and. far beyond aU these other baser recom mendations, ber cook was absolutely perfect, and her dinners ;the best that' oonld be imagined. To sit at ber pretty table in the coeey dinmg-rooui of her charming house, and to partake of those varied and wonderfnl entr6os, those soups and roasts, those savories and sauces, was enougli to make the daintiest epicure render thanks to Heaven for the satisfaction of being alive to feast upon them. Our friend ^Valentine, was ; most keenly gratified by these refinements of the gastro nomioai. art.

Challenger and tbe cook used to cudgel iheir brains .together for hours in order to invent new dishes for his deleot&tion.; 'But is was not wholly for the dinners that Bryant liked to come to ibe bouse. The com pany pleased him quite as well, and bis lellow-fpests were always well chosen and harmoniously arranged.
