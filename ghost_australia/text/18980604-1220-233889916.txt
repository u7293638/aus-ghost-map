[?] A GH03T IN BUSINESS. An amusing ease of spiritualistic impost- tare has lately been tried before the Lands- gericht at Hamburg . The accused, who was an apprentiee 19 vears old and an adept in ' spiritualism,' had a friend of the name of Raiser, who informed him that he was 70 marks to the good in his reoipts, and how this money got into the safe he had no meanB of divining. The aeonsed at onoe explained this surplus by his own dealings with the spirit world. It was Onkel Ernst, his de ceased relation, who had oonjnred the 70 marks into the Bafe, and who wonld shortly require them baok, spirits being apparently lenders rather than givers, bat being gene rous enough to forego the interest. Raiser, who also played witn spiritualism, accepted the explanation, and his belief was confirmed later on when he.received a document written professedly by Onkel Ernst. Is said : ' Re pay at onoe the 70 marks 1 advanced. My faithful medium to reoeive them.' Raiser complied â€” and found a few weeks later that the surplus had no ghostly source but was simply due to an item he had overlooked in his accounts. The firm took the matter np, and the prosecution proved that the writing of Onkel Ernst was exactly the same as that of his faithful medium. The Court decided to protect the nephew from the influence of his business-like uncle by sentencing the faithful medium to six months' imprison ment.
