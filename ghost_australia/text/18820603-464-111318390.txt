Sir Henry Parkes, after he had raised the; Kiama ghbst,vras out of power, almost hppeleBBly. A crisis occurred, and Mr. William TForster was Bent for. He had, almost; single-handed, fought for Oafcholiei over the Kiama' Qhost; affair, and ?whan aboat formiag his Ministry lie asked Mr. Edward Butler to join him;' Tour brother, Sir, refused^, .unless Mr. Eprsfcer invited Sir Henry Parkes, alsotp, join them.,- .This Mr, Forster de^ olinecl to 90! arid'.'he' failed to form a Ministry.

I admit that if you believed tlieri -s you preach how, thata politician should have religion arid religious considerations alrfrie present 'to 'his mind, then your support of the Par'lces-Butler alliance wag wicked.

In the briefest possible way we shall notice Mr. Heydon's letter, and dismiss its subject from any further encroach ment upon pur columns arid; our readers' atten tion..', 7.'77 .-?? -'-.',; j , ' .. '?; ' '.'''? : 1: Qt.ouri alleged ignorance or recklessness in regarding ''Black Wednesday ' as anti-Irish and Catholic, we prefer the convictions of the Catho lic people of Victoria— the fact that Catholics the moat distinguished by intellect and service were VuthlesBly sacrificed — to the unsupported assurance of Mr., ' Graham Berry's friend, and publie panegyrist, Mr. Heydon. We prefer the, evidence' of our eyes when we daily pass in the street the ; greatest architect perhaps out of England in any part of the. Empire, whose only offence was that he : was a noble specimen of a^ loyal Oatholie gentleman.. We are not concerned in mitigating the atrocity of the con duct of individual Irishmen' and Catholics who supported the iniquity, if what Mr. Heydon says of them be. true. : But we believe it is not true. 2\. It ia not true— itis indeed a'somewhat immodest ?ppryorsion ,of the truth— that ' Mr. Forster had almost single-handed, fought for Catholics over the Kiama Ghost affair.' Mr. Eorster in that ?? as in all public matters behaved with a calm in trepidity, 'manifested a. fine spirit of j UBtice , and scorned the cruel imposture of which the. people of the country (and especially our Irish- Cathblic fpllpw- bitizeris) were the victirias. But there was at ; least phis' Oatholie who, from the first mojpent that the' slander, was.utte red till it was exposed andde-. stroyed,' never ceased day and night by speebh and' peri, 'by1 mockery and deriunciatipn, on plat: formsi in the 'Press, in Parliament, to denounce the- whole' ?;? business ; as a gigantic burlesque' of truths !and desency and fair play.

'- ; j 3.;iIt isnot'true^thatatthe MaBonic Hall or else yherfifjMr.palley made any; allusion to the con cluct 'of ;thiB journal in bringing about the alliance of Sir Henry Parkes with Mr. Edward Butier. A ebpy'pf his speech is before u& at this moment, of ; which speeeh twenty-five thousand copies 'were published at the time it was spoken. It has been already mentioned in these eolumno in the noble letter of Dr. Forrest in our last iooue. It does not contain a word about this journal or its public conduct. It clearly and courageously foretells that that allianco would end in trotiehory. But at that time Mr. Dalloy v/au tho only Oatho lie, who dared ao to opeal: in public; it v/no ?felt that hio personal contempt for Sir Henry Parkes prevailed over his judgment, and many persons felt that his language vms indiscreet. At all events he stood alone. 4\. We plead guilty to tho charge of being un able to find anything favourable lo say of Mr. Heydon's address ; and we are eq-oa?ly ramble to understand the mystery of his allusions to our enmity.^ iHe is doubtless qualifying himself for a Byinpathetic support of the chiefrof the Ministry of'.whjiph'tieaVowB himself a follower hy emulating in a; .jmall way the accompLishments of that 1 mystery monger. It is- a ;grt»at part 6f! the\'latte'r's Tpplioy to perpetuairj1 poBe aa( a r'nia'E^ of suffering atjd a. victim, of. per secution. It is an easy rdh; has proved 9, pra fit- able .'one, and has led to place and power. Nei& can wp apologise for the. alleged impertinenp.o^qi '] our allusions to Mr. i- 'Heydon?s ? friend ^and,;. chairman, Mr. Nfniari Melville. We are perfectly aware of thb-geritleman's eminence, both- political and; municipal, .and did not,, require . that', , Mr r. Heydon should furnish us with so complimentary a'; biography of a man abydistiriguished ? and so well jknown.7 .He has not gained upon our esteem or dazzled pur imagination by presiding over Mr.- Heydon's meeting or offering a nationoj welcome to Mr. Heydon's Victorian friend, Mr. Graham Berry. J5;\\-In publishing this second : and (in these columns) last letter of Mr. Heydon, wo may say in answer to his postscript, that tho publication inifull of the paragraph in his provioua commu nioation was essential to prevent on Mr. Hoydon'a part an intentional or accidental emaooulution of; our meaning by his extracts. 6\. Mr. Heydoc commits himoelf to a Dtato ment, as to the truth or falsehood of which he could possibly know nothing, when he nayo the Freeman's Journal is indebted to tho daily papers for its reports. Wo aro prepared to prove that, at all the celebrations mentioned by him, our reporter attended, and not only so, but that he furnished several of the reports in connection with these celebrations that appeared in the daily :paperi.- . -.!.-.? ':.???? . . .''?.- ?7. We. havo not one word to say of Mr. Heydon's Catholicism in politics. His views are (to judge from his letters) precisely thoso of the Administration he is about to support. They say religion is no affair of politics, but of the liome ? arid the conscience, and on this they found thoir education policy, and vindicate its continuancu Mr. Heydan says precisely the samo thing. With this we are not in the least oonoorned. Ho is by; far too unimportant a parsonage as yot to ocoupy a very large share of public attention ; or to make his utterances or opinions the subjectn of either public anxiety or apprehoneion. V/hon in a ministerial oombiaation of hio ovra gonius with the culture of Mr, Lucas and feho modqofcy of Mr. Melville he alters the fieeal polioy of tho country arid perhaps may even meditate availing himsolf of the luxury of Bome of Mr. Grahao Borvy'c most famous oontrivaneos for extinguishing ware of creeds aad establishing true politico, v/e any advert to kim again. But in the intoresto of our reader's (for whose benefit, by the way, he has manifested a quite superfluous anxiety) wo shall try and forget him till that period arrives. —Ed. .F.J-.]
