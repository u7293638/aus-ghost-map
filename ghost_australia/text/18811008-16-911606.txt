Mr. Yates's Benefit. "Hamlet," was played last evening by Mr Frank Cates, was a performance marked by exceptional talent, conscientious study, and a high appreciation of dramatic art The occasion was the benefit of Mr Gates and, to the infinite dis- credit of Brisbane playgoers, a comparatively thin house assembled to greet an aspirant for fame in Shakespearian drama who buln fur to make an enduring mark in the highest range of his profession Consistent as a whole in conception and performance, it is not matter for sure is that it was somewhat uneven in parts Considering it as a first performance of the part, Mr Cutts may feel j is said to have achieved a legitimate triumph There was in the interpretation presented to the audience of last night no slavish following of the modern BLot of Shakespearian actors, who So often, in their efforts to effect naturalness, achieve commonplace , nor an utter avoidance of the examples of the leading, car events of the old school which it is now a days too much the fashion to call unnatural and stage AMIEU pourtraying the hopes, the aspirations, the terrible mental conflicts, the hunger for revenge, and the pitiable lost hope of love and purity that break the life of the royal prince, Mr Cates proved his appreciation of Harold advice to the players ' But use all gently for in the very torrent, tempest, and, I may say, the whirl wind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smooth ness " Curiously enough, this very speech from which we quote was the least sucvcfeBful passage in the performance Not from want of appreciation but lack of ease This time will soon repair to a young actor want of physique in a part like Hamlet is in some respects a serious drawback since it is often an easy matter to conceal ignorance of art, or sudden nervousness, by a timely exhibition of lung power Mr. Cates does not fill the stage with noise, and as a pleasant consequence he must necessarily trust to legitimate art. Once only at the end of the play scene did he essay to split the ears of the groundlings, and it was a harsh variation of the previous harmony Yet, amid so much that was good, it begins almost ungenerous to point out such blemishes but these Throughout the play Mr C ites distinguished himself by the excellence of his interpretations, Boine being quite new to a Brisbane audience, as when, re turning to address the Qht st, he makes the sign of the cross so he utters the line " Angels and ministers of grace defend us " So, too, there was a world of meaning in his parting injunction to the layers " Follow that lord and look yon pick him not" At the end of the third act Mr Cates gives a very effective interpretation to the last line Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind, by raising the arms and gazing upon the dead body of Polmins The scene is th the Queen was a wide departure from the tortured >x, and did not suffer from the able nee <f In aid voiced passion that nsu illy mara it, will? not withstanding some obvious di (Utilities, the last see e was effectively rendered, and the curtain descended upon a performance that Tiny be chronicled as a Bingul in success considering the calibre of the coup by the fair Ophelia found in all respects a fitting exponent in Miss Annie Mayor, whose reappearance after her rest. ent illness was hailed with gre it cordiality Mr Hetfordpli yidthoparts of the Ghost and the he is, md t- julie the text with exactness and discretion , but why the lying in "Hamlet should always make up like a pirate of the Spanish main who had usurped the crown of Denmark we are at a loss to conceive Mr Thynne furnishes a pleasant surprise by the performance of flotation difficult part, which he played with modesty and discretion As Polonaise, VIr Forbes was disappointing, but it was but fair to say he was evidently suffering from a severe cold Mr Sam Poole was quaintly humorous as the Giaicdijacr, and Miss Blanche Gray will do well to avoid in future the part of the Queen I see (writes " Tiidymion ) that my friend of the Gregory objects to the education vote, and especially to the teaching of music and drawing a what he calls "charity schools He even went so far as to suggest, in the case of a school teacher on the Barcoo said to have been insane that probably music teaching had something to do with his insanity Oh, Gregory, Gregory, I thought better of you ' How came you to be among the Philistines ' A shopkeeper, a man who deals out raisins and calico, a being whose mind has been narrowed by brick walls and closed in by streets, a mere Queen Streeter in short, might scorn the arts that develops the soul of man like you, a favourite of the Muses, win so sensibilities have been preserved in all their pi is fine freshness, whose life has for so many years been spent far from the contamination of towns, in sweet communion with Nature, I am surprised it you Have you no music in your s ml-has not your ear been attuned to the soft lowing of your herds, the blessings of your Rocks Have you not been often lulled by the gentle pipings of your shepherds-Barrett h twist, or was it colonial you gave them '-in the Kosky dells of Thornleigh, or on the rolling plains of Avington ?

The second stack was then set alight, but was not allowed to burn much longer than the first one and this was also extinguished with equal rapidity, the liquid being thrown from two small hand-pumps, and not more than from twelve to fourteen gallons of the compound being expended This fire extinguishing liquid is called the "Securities," and has been patented by Mr. Charles June mann The cost of the compound is said to be exceedingly trifling Whether it be thought worth the while of railway directors, managers of collieries, insurance and dock companies, and chiefs of fire brigades to bestow some attention on the "Secuntas," I do not know Perhaps some millions of pounds.' worth of property might be saved every year if we discovered that some other agency than water might be advantageously used in subduing what the occasional reporters call, without the slightest ex- aggeration, but with an eye to an additional word in their copy, " the devouring element."
