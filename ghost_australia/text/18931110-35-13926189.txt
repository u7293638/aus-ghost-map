and will thus he independent of all precedent its income hers will not hold themselves aloof from their recognised party obligations became they act together in regard to certain matters affecting the interests of the colonies which are outside, the limits of ordinary party ties and because they hope to be able to excuse in this capacity a useful and app embie influence on its course of Imperial legislation to-day's meeting, indeed, is but a recognition of the continually growing importance of the i offering of interests of "Greater Britain as a whole, and of the impossibility of pursuing a parochial policy when the nelf roof a a world-wide Empire isatstaVo It marks an import into stage of progress along the lengthy load which must be tray of sed before we can reach that Imperial Federal tion which did immense majority of British subjects u whether born at home or in the colonies, regard as theoretically desirable, though many of them are inclined to look upon it as practically almost linens ble of attainment There are it may be readily ad mitted, innumerable difficulties, and it is not easy to forecast, however vaguely,, the method in which they are to be surmounted It would be, in fact merely an effort of the imagination to attempt to trace, step by step, the process by which the Imperial unity of the Tin fish lump sum will eventually be accomplished, and to explain the means by which tariffs will be brought into harmony, and contributions towards a system of defence national in the widest signification of the word-will be assessed llicto arc prejudices to be overcome there are needs to be resolved and it is conceivable that only after having passed through the crucible of some gigantic struggle for national existence shall we obtain the pure metal of Imperial union -Luflish men are sometimes too much inclined to talk nail the federation of the Empire were a matter which can be decided by the mother country alone Those who have given any attention to the subject know that this is not the case, and that in more than one of the colonies there is a party which believes that local interests would not be served by a union upon n 17 tons of federation with the United kingdom We believe that such sentiments will (Its appear before the progress of events and The establishment in the House of Commons of a group of members belonging to both political parties, but recognised as watching in a special manner and with expert knowledge over the interests of the colonies, is calculated to arouse a certain but tumut of mutual interest, and t bear,? the mother country and her dependencies into closer relation Otu self governing colonies in all resolve themselves into three great groups, elm North American, the booth African, and the Austral ian The first is already almost united Australia will probably be federated ina Short time-as tune is counted in the history of nations and a formal recognition of a unity of interests in South Africa cannot be long delayed if the organisation which will be created to day contributes towards persuading these three groups of colonies that, as portions of the British Empire, they have in many respects ldonthulm forests, and that a policy of conciliation, and of the subordination of accidentals to essentials, must be pursued in order that the welfare of all may be achieved, it will accomplish most valuable work Piece are two fundamental points to be home in mind in regard to any scheme 1 is establishing a closer relation between the United Kingdom and liar st If governing colonies the essentials of a united Empire are of a twofold character in the was one of the committee of the Imperial Federation League, over which Lord Brassey presided, and which could certainly not be accused of any partisan bias, they are that the voice of the Empire, in peace, when dealing with foreign Powers shall be, as far as possible the united voice of all its autonomous parts and that the defence of the Empire in war shall be the common defence of all its interests and of all its parts by the united forces and resources of all its members' It has been suggested 1 that some of our colonies regard it as a burdensome risk that they should be involved in the consequences of an quarrel which the mother country might think it necessary to undertake Wo fleeing to believe that such a theory finds many adherents, but those who believe of in tt should remember that if it were not for the might of I England they would Bpeoddv 1. annexed by some other Povv ei and that as a colony

interested in its efficiency I his is one of the matters which must come more prominently to the fore as the colonies increase in strength, and the possibility of an Imperial tariff standB<upou a similar footing The settlement of both questions bristles with calculator and it would be absurd to attempt it off hand Everything however, which brings the mother country and the colonies into closer
