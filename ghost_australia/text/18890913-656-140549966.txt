With s^idcr-webbing tattered In travesties of lncc, 'Aiid treasures yoars bnvo shattered— Onco miracles of grace— Imploring Timo to Bparc it, * with rusty tongue of steel, Behold it in tbo garret— Auot Martha s spinning-wheel. With alow and ponsivo fingers I wipe tbe webs away, * While loving Fancy llngerd. ' To paint an oldon day. : When youth and beauty crowned ft What gay songs used to peal ! . Now crickets wail around it — ' Aunt Martha's spinning. wheel. T softly touch tbo treadle ; It fcivca a plaintive squeak ; 'tbegs ino not to meddle, la mormure sad aud meek. ' Alas! the feet that litbely— Once twinkled through tbe reel, No more shall pat it blithely — Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. How oft its noisy turning Hath served a lover's need, . And kept Age from discerning What only Youth should heed 1 'Twould drown both vows and kisses That lovers love to steal ; A dear old treasure this is — Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. For fear of house adorner In search of bric-a-brac, Far in tho garret corner With sighs I put it back : And there, just us I found it, I leave for woe or weal With ghosts to glide around it, \unt Martha's spinning-wheel.
