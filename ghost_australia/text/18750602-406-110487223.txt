WON IN A BAEELE! THE EDITOR OF THE WALLAE0O TIMES.) SIB,-W ill you permit me-more for the sate of the Good Tom Hood, deceased, than to myself, to explain what I said at the " Oddfellows Hall," Eadina, on Wednesday night last, touching the estimation in which I held the candidature of Mr Madge, but which you did not catch from so great a distance-judging from your report. "TheCourt ship of Miss Killmansegg " was running through my mind while Mr Madge was endeavouring to set forth his claims, and our duty to make him a Legislator. The ghost of poor Hood would thinl? me a very miserable parodist should he meet with it in the prosaic form put by you, what I said was this:-" If Mr. Madge were re turned-' We Bhould have as little cause to re joice as if we had won the man of our choice at an Electioneering raffle."' There, now, that's better, isn't it ? -I am, sir, *&c.;, THOS. AlfTHONY. [Is it correct to say " Won " under such, circum stances ? If so, we would prefer to lose.-ED.]
