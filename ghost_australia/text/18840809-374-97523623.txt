THE VISION OF CHARLES XL The following vision was belield by Charles XI of Sweden, the father of Charles XII so celebrated as a royal warrior. The apparition was seeli by the King and his attendants and is so well authenticated that this ghost story has become a matter of history One evening the Swedish monarch when attended bjr Count Bralie and his physician Baumgarten perceived a state saloon in the palace lit tip and procuring the keys of the gallery, he entered and to his astonishment found the walls draped, iu black. ' Wh 3 has given orders to drape the room thus ¥ asked he in an angry tone.. * Ho one that I know of sire,' an- j swered the porter in alarm,' and the last time this gallery was swept, it was panelled in oak, as it lias always been. Assurely these black draperies have not been brought from your Majesty's : repository.' While the porter was still speaking, theKiug, with rapid strides, hadaiready approached the end of the gallery. Tbe Count and the door-keeper followed him closely ; the physician Baumgarten being somewhat in the rear, hesitating between the dread of being left alone and that of being involved iu the results of an adventure which had commenced in so strange a fashion. * Proceed lib further, sire,' exclaimed the porcer. ' On jny soul there is sor cery within. At this •hour—and since tl e death of the Queen, your most gracious spouse—it is said that she walks this gallery. May God protect ' us'' ' Let us enter,' replied the monarch, in a firm voice, stopping before the door of the igreat chamber of state ; ' and do j'ou, porter, quickly open tliat door,' He struck it with his foot, and the sound echoing tlirgugli the vaulted ceilings, ! was sis though a caution had been dis charged. The porter trembled to such an ex tent that the key rattled in the lock without effecting an entrance. ' An old soldier >vho trembles!' said Charles,' shrugging his.shoulders. Conie, Count, open the door.' ' Sire,' replied the Count, stepping back, ' let yonr Majesty order me to face a Danish or German cannon, und I will obey without hesitation, but this is bell that you wish uie to defy.7 The Kmg snatchedtbe. keys froln thfe hands of the porter.
