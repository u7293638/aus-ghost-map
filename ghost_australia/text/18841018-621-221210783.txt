The Victoria Amateur Turf Club Meeting. T&e; great spring racing earnival was inaugurated on Saturday, at Caulfield, when, though unfortunate in the matter of weather, the votaries ol the turf met with some compensation in the racing treat | placed before them, which, as a whole, was I much superior to what could have been ex- I pected under the circumstances. The first | race of the day— the Maiden Plate— afforded I those horses whose public appearances had I hitherto been unsuccessful an opportunity I of at least paying for their winter's oats. I This honour was allowed Norfolk, wBo beat I Duration rather easily for first place, while j Vasco had to be content with third position. Owing to the treacherous nature of the I course, the Hurdle Race was like to prove I interesting, if not injurious, but fortunately | of the numerous field that faced the j starter, only two came to grief— Skobe off and Ditto. The winner turned up I in the outsider Sinking Fund, who was well ridden by W. Harden. The Great Foal Stakes, which followed, was the subw ject of considerable interest ; consequently various candidates were subjected to con siderable scrutiny. Some of them were very handsome, notably Sir William Clarke's representative, S&uvignon;, Mr. J. Mitchell's Merry Xm&s;, and Mr. J. Wilson's Ring master. The latter indeed worthily endorsed the good impression he created in the pad- doek by passing the winning-post a length in front of the field, his nearest opponent being Mr. W hittingham's handsome chest nut filly Ocista, while the New South Wales .representative, Umbra, secured third place. The chief interest, of course, centred in the Canifield Guineas, which was the next event on the programme. The contestants were, indeed, a handsome let. Rufus, who, on the merit of previous per formances, was installed first favourite, had a large circle of admirers, while the beau tiful South Australian filly, Helene, bad second call in public opinion. The dangerous " blue and white " stable had a solitary representative in Tre- mando, while, if the favourite was to be overthrown, many good judges selected David as the horse "to do the deed." The winner, Sandal, received little or no notice; much to the ultimate gratification of the metalliciaus. The contest was a very open one till the turn home was reached, when Sandal, Gratitude, and Helene were seen in the van, and a good struggle resulted in the rather comfortable victory of Sandal, the three horses finishing in the above- mentioned order. In the contest for the Findon Harriers' Gold Vase a very large field of hunters saddled up. As the leaders of the scattered field entered- the straight run home, victory was seen to rest between Abdallah and Ghieftain. Then for a moment the gallant old grey drew to the fore, but Chieftain would not be dehied, and a fine struggle resulted in the latter's favour by several lengtbs. The Toorak Handicap was the last race on the list, Meteor securing the largest share of public favour, but once again the general opinion was wrong, as a distance from home Precious Stone came with a rush, and scored an easy win ; the favourite was second, and Prodigal third. While the horses were at the post for the Great Foal Stakes, Norton, the rider of Phaon, was disqualified for three months for disobedience of the starter's orders, and several other jockeys were fined for a similar offence. Maiden Plate, of 100 sovs., added to a sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each. For maiden horses, S yrs. old and upwards. Special weights— 3 yrs-» 7st. 71b. ; 4 yrs., 8st. 51b. ; 5 vrs. and upwards 8st. 81b.

Noaring the sod wall, Capri commenced to work his way to the front, but Vasco still held the pride of place, with Polestar aud Norfolk- oU' his quarters. Entering the straight, Norfolk and Vasco were still to the fore, while I Peut-etre also, commenced to creep up, - but I Poles tar cried, content, and : retired rapidly to the rear. At the ? distance, Dlirallnn maJa a. determined effort to deprive Norfolk of the !ea»i, but the, effort was futile, as the latter, stalling off his rush, won comfortably by half a length.

Along the | ba.«rir Sinking Fund was eased,, and Yately, j pulling double, raced away in front Gf Tanta- i !i»er and Sinking Fund. Passing the sod wall j the grey was still in front, closely pressed by Tantaliser and Sinking Fund.

Ringmaster was very fractious at the post, and delayed the start somewhat. When the fta fell, the colours of Cloth of Gold were the first to show in front, but almost immediately afterwards Naroween supplanted her, with Umbra, Ocista, Phaon, and Merry Christmas well up. Rounding the turn Naroween retired, and Ocista, Carew, and Merry Christmas were in the van. Entering the straight Ladj> Adelaide fell when holding a central position. At the distance Merry Christmas and Ocista j were together in front, but about a hundred I yards from- home RingmaBter came with a! rush, and, quickly disposing of the leaders, j won easily by a length and a half from Ocista. I Umbra came very fast at the finish, and de feated Merry Christmas for third place. First Prince was next, Sauvignon fifth, Naroween next, and Lady Adelaide, riderless, last. Time, 55 i see.

The customary _ parade did not excite the n6ual amount of interest, and, owing to the state of the going, only the mildest of prelimi naries were indulged in by the dozen competi tors ere the lot took up their positions at the starting post on the hill, round the first turd. Without any delay the flag fell to an excellent start, Gratitude at once going to the front, with Rebus in close attendance. The latter soon gave place to. Sandal and Helene, while the favourite held a rearmost position with Le porello and Pilot. Along the back, Gratitude increased her advantage, but Sandal and Helene still followed in her wake, with Tre mando, Merrimu, and Sirocco next; in a bunch, and Pilot and Leporello still acting as whippers- . in. Passing the sod wall the line separating the first and last horses was more pronounced, but still Gratitude held command, with her countrywomen, Sandal and Helene, follow ing on ber heels. Turning into the straight, Sandal challenged _ the leader, and get ting on terms with her below the dis tance, quickly disposed of ber, and without being really called upon, ran home an easy winner by a length and a half from Gratitude, who was just clear of Helene. Sirocco was fourth, and David fifth. Then came Tremando, Bohemian, Merrimu, Rebus, and Leporello, in the order indicated, with Pilot last.

The running for - this event may be de scribed as confusion worse . confounded, and owing to the close resemblance of thft colours, it was _ impossible to distin- guish many of thp riders, jiust before the: start rain commenced to faff, and the "shower" j continued throughout the race.. .On the. signal being given, the South Australian representa tive, Yankee Grab, took the initiative, and led over the brush obstacle in front of the stand, followed by Barcoo and Banyenong, the others charging the jump almost in a line. At the fence on the hill the field was considerably re duced 4 by several of the competitors coming to grief. Yankee Grab, however, held selfish possession of the lead, with The Laird, Chieftain, Syphon, and Abdallah I following. Yankee Grab showed the way over the obstacles in front of the stand, attended by Our Boy, Abdallah, Chieftan, Banyenong, and Antelope. Much' the same order prevailed round tne turn and along the back. Nearing the sod wall, the lot closed up somewhat, and at the last fetaee Yankee Grab and Syphon fell, leaviilg- Abdallah and Chieftan at the head of the field. The pair raced together tb-; the entrance to the straight, where the last/ named drew away, and won comfortably by about five lengths. The Clown was an in different third ; Oar Boy and Barcoo together next, and the others straggling all over the course. Time, 5min. 56sec.
