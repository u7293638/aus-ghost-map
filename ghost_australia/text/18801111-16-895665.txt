Mr. a. Rooms, in seconding tho resolution, nlso referred to tho way in which religious matters wero troatod by thoso in authority, ex- pressing tho opinion that the Church generally had not so much to four from thoso without its pal« as from those who occupied high positions within it, mid lent their countenance to those who wero its enemies. The resolution was put and passed. Mr. C. M. Foster moved, and Rev. R.

Two deaths, attended with circumstances of a peculiarly distressing character, occurred last week (says the Aramac Mail) on the back track between Aramac and the Speculation Hotel This track, we may mention, is about fifty miles longer than the coach road, and several teams have travelled that way of late in order to avoid the long dry stage between the Speculation Hotel and Greyrock. A teamster from Emerald, named Pacey, accompanied by his wife, a son about 14 years of age, and a child, took this route on his way out west He was attacked by fever and died on the waggon The unfortunate widow waited for three days by the side of her dead husband in the hope that some traveller would pass. None, however, came, and she was compelled to remove the body from the waggon and bury it herself the poor child then fell sick and died. No assistance came, and she found herself obliged to bury it likewise with her own hands. Shortly afterwards she was enabled to obtain a man to bring on the team, while she found means for returning to Rockhampton. This track is on the Alice Waters, and therefore in the Blackall police district. Our local police, however, having heard of the man's death, were about to start to make enquiries, when word was received in town that the team was coming on and that the unfortunate woman was on her road to the coast. Further action on their part was therefore unnecessary.
