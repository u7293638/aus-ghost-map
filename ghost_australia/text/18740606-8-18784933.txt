Â« THE RELIGIOUS AWAKENING MOVE- MENT IN GREAT BRITAIN." On Wednesday evening t e third meeting of the senes, arranged to publish particulars of this move- ment in GreatBntain, was held in the Congregational Church, West Maitland There was a large attend- ance The proceedings opened with singing, the reading of the scriptures, and prajer. The Rev R T HILLS, pastor of the Church, said that, lest there should be in the minds of any a mis apprehension, he would saj a few worcis, which would appear to most of them superfluous Those who were to speak that night held conversion-the renewal of the human soul, its deliv erance from sin and danger-to be exclusively the work of God The Holy Spirit was the Divine Per-on who operates upon the human soul, and turns the current of the will and the affections The truth of God is the instrument the Holy Spirit uses to produce this effect It was quite true that a man might be said to be converted by the truth, or converted bj the agency of another, but, stuctly speaking, neither the truth nor the human agent couverted the soul any more than a fanner grows a harvest The farmer can plough the ground and put in the seed, but God fives the seed, and God only can make it grow he farmer was only the agent or instrument in God's hands Theiefore, just as in material nature God creates and promotes growth, so in spiritual matters God sanctifies, renews, and causes spiritual progress And such spiritual progress is the work of the Holj Spirit. They also believed that God was not only working m this waj generallj around them, but specially in England, and other parts of Great Britain It was to receive information on the subject, to stir up their hearts, that the meet- ing was held that ev ening. The Rev J BENVIE referred to the work of God in Scotland as one which was open to all possible in- spection and the freest criticism It was admitted b> the highest minds in the country to be a genuine work It bad a remarkable aspect, as having taken place in a conservative church, not given to excite- ment, but in the habit of reflecting upon ev erj thing calmly It was a church having a fixed theologj and fixed habits of thought Such a work bad been a recognized work in that church for hundreds of years, and was a recognized work now In- stances of the work in the present day had been given at previous mee'ings, but many more might be given [lhe speaker related particulars of a revival movement in 1839, which commenced at Kilsaitb, a town about twelv e miles from Glasgow, and having incidentally mentioned that there was strong excitement, sobbing, and cry- ing manifested in the congregations at that place affected, proceeded] The work of God did not necessarily require these manifestations But if people should be excited, and burst into tears, who can blame them 9 If people under a sense of sin, and conscious of having rejected the grace of God again and again, are at once smitten with the thought that they have been living a life of sm, and crucified the son of God afresh, could there be anv surprise that they should cry for mercy, and burst into tears. Some people might think it highly improper to be disturbed about sin, but people could not be restrained from showing their feelings, and it was better to have a congregation earnestly aroused than an indifferent and stolid con- gregation [The speaker alluded briefly to the tes- timony of Jonathan Edwards, whom he charterised as one of the most remarkable metaphj sicians that had ever lived, respecting a great revival in New England, USA, m 1735, and anticipating an objec- tion aB to the possibility of sudden conversions, went on ] Why should people be surprised at sudden conversions ? Paul, the Philippian jailer, the thiee thousand on the Day of Pentecost, those who were added to the church daily under the preaching of Peter and the Apostles-were all instances of sudden conversions. There were several wa) s in which God works in His church His influences were some- times like the dew, which required perfect silence, complete stillness, in order that it might be deDOSited And there was also a way like the tongue of fire, like the mighty rushing wind showers and tempests and not dews of His grace These were all Scriptural symbols for the minner in which He earned on His work But all conversions whatever were sudden The people of God should first pray for them It might be asked what should people do who were under serious concern for their souls 9 First they should seek God in prayer, alone They should pour out their hearts at the Throne of Grace Secondly, they should learn what God bad to say to them, and should consult his TV ord There he spoke both to the sinner and to the believer Thirdly, if doubts and fears arise they should while taking them to the Throne of Grice for solution and re- moval, also remember that God's ministers are his instruments, and they want to be consulted upon just such matters Fourthly, they should repair to enlightened Christian friends In the fifth place there must be prayer, much pray er That had been the characteristic of the present revival in Great Britain, as of all revivals Pray er waa a means of promoting His Kingdom which God had fixed, which was open to all and available by all If prayer were resorted to now in Maitland, they might rest assured that sooner or later those who are Christ's now would reach a higher and still higher platform, and that those who were strangers to the Cross of Christ would be brought to subjection under it A hymn was sung and prayer offered The Rev J C M'DOUGALL remarked upon the encouragement arising from the large meeting, and from the profoundly interesting informa tion which bad been published respecting the revival movement at home But while they only sat to hear these reports their respon- sibilities were greatly increased For everj thing that should affect us beneficially and arouse us to greater diligence, faith, prayerfulness, and effort for God, and does not have that effect, increases our responsibilities We aie unmoved by influences which are calculated and designed to move us There was in Maitland abundance of room for a re vival of the work of God-room for work in the hearts of God's people, and reason for looking for and desiring a deep awakening in the church of Christ. That was a work which must be done before hundreds and thousands m this town and district could be saved There was a work for the Church to undertake, and a work which all the churches might enter upon, notwithstanding the differences of opinion and of organization, so that the Lord might be glorified in the in-gathering of hundreds of souls And if they would, individually further the cause of God, they must observe several things They must confess Christ-declare their allegiance to Him They must confess Him with the heart, the ups, and the life The confession must be spontaneous, not forced, and it must be sincere Their confession of Christ, if it were open, sincere, and a glad recognition of the honor of wearing the badge of discipleship to Him, would be greatly valu- able ID advancing His cause in the world It would give the servants of Christ increased power for use fulness There should be resoluteness in making the confession, in defiance of all difficulties, and not- withstanding all hindrances There should be a confession of Christ by constant attendance at the ordinances of the Church, and by an openly ex Sressed sympathy with all religious movements hnst should be professed before the world as well as before the Church The world looked to profes- sedly Christian people for an example, and such an example ought never to be wanting There was a great danger attached to shrinking from the confes sion of Christ If they were unwilling to confess Him now the time would come when He would deny them There was an opportunity now of declaring for the Lord's side They -vould be doing what hun dreds and thousands in Great Britain had done Tbey were asked now to become loyal servants of Christ In the examples of revivil work in Scotland and England they should find encouragement They were urged to come forward and to seek They would assuredly find the Lamb of God who taketn away the sins of the world, and would take away their BUIS After a hymn had been sung, and prayer offered, The Rev GEORGE LANE found cause for gratitude and encouragement in the intelligence given at the meetings which had been held, and m the large at- tendances at these meetings And the practical question then came-What was to be the issue' They believed that a revival was possible m Mait- land. Should thej pray for it ? Should the) take measures to secure blessings for themselves in accordance with God's will? There was reason enough to ask for an outpouring of God's spirit, the church of God was not in these da) s so powerful for good as she might be That was freely acknowledged bj men of modern da) s They had scholarship, and wealth, and culture, and numbers, and respectability in the Church, but they needed something over and above all these There was a need of genuine piety in the church, of the presence of the Spirit of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost When the heart of every member of a Christian Church, and of overy preacher of the Gospel is filled with a divine love and a holy zeal, Bud with the power of the Hoi) Ghost, there would be a widespread and a mighty revival of the work of God Such a thing was possible The means weie clearly laid down in the Bible Should the) use them p It was remarkable that all great rev IV als had originated from obscure men, the most scholarl) and prominent and renowned men had not first of all been concerned m them They had arisen from the earnest pleadings of men who, perhaps for years, had been supplicating God in secret and alone for a manifestation of His power They should remember now that God was still a prayer hearing and a prayer-answering God, that He was willing to give them all blessings, if thej were willing to ask He urged them therefore to unite m asking for the revival of the work of God m this land A hymn was again sung, and The Rev R T. HILLS addressed the meeting by way of special exhortation The proceedings closed with praj er and the bene- diction. "The culture of tobacco and hops," wnte3 the Gipps Land Times, " is now beginning to form a distinct and important feature in the category of our local industries In the neighbourhood of Bairnsdale alone, nearly 60 acres of I ind have been devoted to the growth of tobacco during the past se ison with very satisfactory results, and we have heard of one gentleman in the same locality netting the not in- considerable sum of Â£600 from eight acres of hops Other plantations m that neighbourhood have given equally satisfactory results, but we have not heard the exact figures " We regret to hear that the Rev J Maitland Ware met with an accident near Deniliquin on yesterday (Friday) The rev gentlem in was thrown out of hi3 buggy and is not able to hold Divine Service at Wanganella or Deniliquin on Sunday next The buggy came in contact with a stump, the rev gentle- man was pitched out, leaving Mrs Ware in the buggv The horses then bolted, and coming m contact with s tree, severed themselves from the etude, leaving Mrs Ware unhurt therein Her escape was something miraculous Mr Ware had some ribs broken, but is doing well in the care of Dr Noyes, who is also crippled from a fracture of the collar bone -Pastoral Times, May 30 QUICKSILVER MINK -Another important industry which we Gympieites fondly regard as being full of promise is this week prominent by an earnest of its results, Â¡f allude to the Gympie Cinnabar Company There js now on view at the Bank of New Souih Wales about a hundredweight of quicksilver, the produce of the above company's mine they say there is any quantity more where that came trom all that is wanted is the needed application of labor J to extract the valuable produce,-Queenslander, '
