HAUNTED. One day, alas, I lost my youth, I know not when or now, know I had it once, And cannot find it now. But sometimes in the winter I feel it in the air, And when the snowflakes kiss my face It seems to touch me there. With warm caresses laden, Seek youth upon my mouth That make the roses blush — they stir my blood and linger To bid my wan cheeks flush. My youth? I lost it long ago, But of this fact I boast — It may be dead, but, surely, I Am haunted by its ghost. -EDWARD VAN ZILE.
