BLUE AND GOLD. Oh, see her pick her pretty steps Between the heaps of hay, And see her dimple, blush, and smile Whene'er she looks my way. Oh, never since primeval days, The days of Eve of old, Have there been eyes of such a blue, Such locks of clustering gold. But sometimes still my heart misgives, My truant thoughts will stray ; How can the fairy life she lives Fit her for life's hard way % At other times in wandering dreams, Like beckoning ghosts that glide, I see her e'en in fifty yearsâ€” And still she is my bride. Those eyes are faded in their blue, Those locks are silvery white ; But still she is as sweet to me, As fair unto my sight. For T have proved that tender heart, That generous, healthy mind, And well I know that I have won The best of womankind. Kurilla.
