Thee are certain events in our lives which appear to .e now so shadowy and unreal that we can bhardly persuade ourseelv they are other than mere a visions, sometime pleasant ano rome times nightmares. Ihe last few anys I spent' in India 'ow look to me rather . a dream than as a reality. I had made my rrnergements to leave osta camund, spend a day at Trichiuopoly and Madura, proceed leasurely to Taticorin, giving ample time to see all the sights on the road. BtLI received a telegram from the agents in Toticorin tbht the steamer '= would leave earlier than ber.appotted date. is I therefore bad-to' bhrry on, leaving Trlotlii -opoly unvisited. What I saw. of that r town and fort i .tbe t distance made me regret exceedingly *that I had not 'time to stay, .but I consoled myself with the reflection that one Scnnot see everything in this world. We most be content to leave many thbing Sunseen we fain would see, and many things undone we fain would do. Life i. full of a. irocmpleteness, whether it be the splendid 1 career of world reforming wbich we fully t* intended to carry out when we were twenty e one, or the day's work in which something is omitted or left undone,. b ever shall I forget my -vist to .the t famous Madura temple. It is the ghost of Si memory rather than a memory itself in vision, a pbhatmamagotla, or any ,d other term you like- to- 'express-a ,: strange treoubled dreamhbardly troubled, at hbt---' wild. .. urelt." g?otesequoe; -1' t anived ai- Madura a ui before 10 o'loca t t attght,aidas aT wrist lea,.a Ittle bierfoe 5 o'loeck the next morning, the leiorablle necessities of cstcblng the steamer.ccm. n; pelling me, it followed that I traust see the Is, temple at right or nct at all. My resolutiot was soon made. Hiring a gbarry, I drove i firtof all to Ibe postmaster to inquire about to an urgent telegram. Jodging from the noise .Y requised to bring him to the front, be bad be evidently been sleeping the 'sleep of the I righteous. I felt ashbamed at distubing . him at this outrageously unoaficial hour; ii but he received me with the utmost courtesy, end what was better, banded me Is. my looked-for telegram. He was evidently rn greatly tickled at my expressed intention of re vishting the Madura Temple at night; and I wsa n ot"' sure bit he was getting be off a sly eiarastic joke' at" my expense when be infoimed me that at this hbor It would be a very remarkable sight indeed, if I could see it. This double meanirg phrase, "If I octld see it," routed er apprehensirns in my mind, but in five ie 'minutes afterwards all these apprebentions e bhad disappeared. We drove through a as targle of streets, when lol in the od starlight of' the eight there loomed up D? before my eyes the walls end gopuras, or 'Itowers, of the most famous temple in d. SouthernrIndia. I could only dimly see the k, strange elaborated carvings of the lower part, Sand I lamented greatly that the upper part was bidden in the darkness ; nevertheless, 'attentively regarding- the lower portions, be and following the olearly out outlines, I saw -e bow wonderful' the work was as a whole' at 'even hough the de'a 1n were lidfltinguish? id able. 'If, however, the outside pat of the' no temple was a disappolntmeret,the insade wea d not. I can honestly say thatif I had to see the interior again, and had to choose between of seeing it in the daytime and seeing It in the of night, I should tertainly select the niht. Among all the wobderfut things ,that' I had 1w seen in India, nothing was more wonderful than this sight.' 1 could nottell which way m, we went, for I was being guided by a most as affable Hidoo. I:. could not give any i elaborate 'de cription 'of'details, for they in succeeded one another in such bewildering rapidity, :bt the broad impression left upon ar, my mind was thati ever in mylife hadleaen anything so strange or so wonderful. We a't walked through long avenues. of pillars of tal almost every shape and form; -we passed by to the groteequest gods of any I had seen in ns Idla, not even excepting those of- the be avs. of Ellorm We entered at bthe great " main entrance, pl aing through a's" cofueo of ithre were few persona 'to be'seen, but long' Ig, rows of lighta, dimly illumining the oorrl h, dore and arches. Thtee were gradually extin. im gulthed ea we proceeded onwards. The ligh a became dimmer and dimmer, the shadows deeper. and deeper, until the only _ light we had was that given by the wretched e' little oil lamps we' carried in our hands r 'They lit up the huges ptllh close at hand;, er whilst behind us, beside' us, and before nu ou, was black darkness. 'Our own volcer be sounded strang.ly ssathey re-ecboed among at the pillars about as and from the roofa above ad us, which were lost in the blackness over. head. 'The sounds, of voaice afar off had S:esomething uncanny about them, until 'at Isat I begn 'to 'feel a curidus:tenalon of irenerves, which: I take it is :closely allied to i the sauperatitiol' fears of men walking er tbrodgh huirobyirds,' or 'visiting the cryptr irk and vaultof ian old oathedral about the hour he of mid.-fight.
