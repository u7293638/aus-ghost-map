WEALTH AND WOE. Died of Starvation. " I don't see how it can be prevented,'1 said the coroner for North-east London to the jury who had found that an old ladvhad died of starvation. Tho coroner may be right (says an English paper). . Sarah Miller was pnysioally weak. She could not do tho hard Work of domestic service, and the sale of her household goods- did not keep her in food for long. She, unfortunately, no doubt, -had tho virtue of self-respect, 'and, "after ' answering "hundreds of advertisements" with no succbsb, preferred to starve rather than enter tho workhouse. Sarah Miller's very virtues may have made it ' impossible ; even for the: good. bouIb who patronise Mr. Arnold White's improved system of charity-giving to save her life, but her fate is an object- lesson which pooplo may well think about The lesson was completed a ' day afterwards, when tho announcement of the opening of a clnb in Piccadilly called tho Cercle de Luxe was made.' Thero one may " loungo in all -the luxury and beauty of the environment whioh man can contrive for himself," tnsto of' tho good things served by u monsieur of European reputation a3 a chef, introtluco ladiee, and part with money as if it were dross, .We know not in what realms narah M.ller's ghost, if there, bi such a thing, may ho seeking the rest of useful work, hut to keep the door of the Cerole de Luxe is befitting the shade of one who died of starvation. The enormous superfluities and the blunted sense ot duty of- those who make such clubs possible, are the. weights in one scale whioh require as a balance slums and starvation in the other.
