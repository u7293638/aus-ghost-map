WHEN 18 THE POPE IN ? FALLIBLE? The Rev. S. M. Brandi, of the Society of the Jesuits, contributes to the North American Review an article in which he attempts to explain just when the Pope is infallible. He points out that in Catholic theology the infallible Pope does not mean one sifted with insnira tion or commissioned to reveal to the Catholic world new dogmas. 'The special assistance of the Holy Ghost is given to the Pope for the only purpose of preserving, explaining, and defend ing the -.revelations already made to and through the Apostles. An in fallible Pope cannot be said to be 'one who can never err in his private con versation or teachings, or who cannot make any mistake in politics,' govern ment, &c.; -For the gift of infallibility, as held by Catholics, belongs to the Pope only in his official capacity, as supreme teacher of the 'Church, and only when, in virtue of fab apostolic power, he 'defines a' do6trin6 that be longs to faith or morals. .This and no other is 4iie subject-matter of die Pope's infallible teaching.'
