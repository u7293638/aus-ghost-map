A QUADRUPLE EXECUTION' AT- . .1.1.'.;! vrto'.tit BANGKOK. :t ' v vThe culprits were four â€” an incendiary, sentenced to have his Hand cut off ; a murderer, to be ripped open-'; the third, a political oftender, to be' delivered to wild beasts ; the fourth; a-blasphemer, to have his head burnt off. The -executioners made full speed,, gr,inding-the/axes and sabres, .dre.ssipg the furOace',' and preparing the bellows. The incetidiary came first .and 'tendered his wrist; !!and his hand immediately was seen flying in 'thei.ai,L! / This muti - lation did not Seem'to affect ;him much, 'for- he went amongstjhe crowd to'witness. the following execu tions."' The "murderer next take's a seat on a stone, and:whilst('they. 7are cutting' into . his' abdomen :he keeps biting a 'banano ; .the.sufferef,.ib/ gnash his teeth, and, under horribje convulsions, loses'the banano ".and" sinks to' rise ' no' rnore. ' The traitor to .the king, meanwhile .is .looking down a den -8peaking to the tigers, and recommending them to' sharpen ffieir appetites.. The ; executioners seize him,-, pass: a rope under his arms, ; and lower him slowly into he horrible hole, after which they slowly, draw- the rope up. - Then we (hear, says Mr Chulnes, an eye-witness, something like muffled crepitation ; from tithe to time a human form is seen jerked up ; the breaking of the skull'and thigh bones/'is; distinguishable; \ -The ' wild . beasts" are roaring all the time, but no-human cry is audible. As for the sacrilegious crimitial, /the -executioners tied him on a plank, and placed his .head between twor coal- pans. ! They then worked the bellows, and directed jets of flime on the culprit's head, whocontinues singing what is supposed to be an impious or blasphemous song. His -temples are blistering under the darts of fire, and yet he con tinues his psalmody. Meanwhile his body writhes in awful convulsions, his eyes are bleeding, his bones cracking, and finally h gives up' the ghost, with a fearful yell. '
