Letters to the Editor. IMMORTALITY" AND To the Editor of the HEAVEN, Journal. Sir,—Mr T. J, Tanner, throngh your columns, asks two questions, one on man hav immortality connected with him in his present state, and the other respecting going to Heaven at death. To my mind the following answers are a sufficient reply to the questions .-—First—John viii., 61— " Verily, verily, [ say unto you, jf any man keep My sayings he shall never see death or as I take it, the soul of the believer shall never die. John x., 27—My sheep hear My voice, and I give to them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of mj hand." Second question—John xiv., 1—Jesus is comforting His disciples with a hope of heaven. In My Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for yon, that where I am ye may be also." Acts vii., 55—We have the dyia\r testimony of St. Stephen," but he being full, of the Holy Ghost looked up etedfastly anto, Heaven, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God," and (59), " Lord Jesus receive mj Spirit." I do not wish to enter into any public controversy, but I have tried to answer these questions to help any who are seeking after truth, besides, if we deny the immortality of the soul we are denying one great tiuth of scripture, and if we bejin to doubt there is no telling where we shall end.
