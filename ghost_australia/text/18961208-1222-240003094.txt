. Is Typhoid a Preventable Disease? With the approach of the summer season the following from the " Hospital " should he of interest to our readers : â€” Typhoid is not now a mysiery 10 me man or soienoe ; 01 that we are sure. It is on the con trary, a well understood and entirely manimeable and preventable malady. Dr. T. E. Hay ward, medical offioer for health for Haydook, Lancashire, tells his parish in- his annual report not only that it is preventable, but also by what preoise and simple means it'may he prevented. Dr. Hayward states in his " Principles of Typhoid Prevention," as made publio in his report for 1895, " Typhoid is a pre ventable disease." "It is a ' disease of filth, and especially of the filth of human exorement." That is to he taken as the beginning of the know ledge, the A.B.O. of typhoid preven tion by the unsoientifio. The next step is equally easy. Typhoid is q disease of baoilli, typhoid bacilli; and the baoilli we find in human exore- ment, and in drinking water fouled by suoh exoreraent. It is probable that no man or woman ever takes typhoid except by swallowing some typhoid baoilli. They may be swal lowed as wo have said, in drinking water, or they may be flying about in tho air in the neighbourhood of of typhoid excrement, and may be swallowed with mouthfuls of air. What, then, is the first and last oora- mandment of typhoid prevent P "Cleanliness ; personal and publio cleanliness. It is all there ; if we keep premises clean ; if wo keep our selves clean ; if we keop our closets and our drains, our kitohens, sculleries, garden, streets, and town entirely olean, typhoid will be pratioally as great a stranger to mo3t of us as is the ghost of King Solomon.
