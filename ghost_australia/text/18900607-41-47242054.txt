CAMP FIRE REFLECTIONS. I bear tbe night winds sobbing, it is the midnight hour, And in tne fire the embers filow with ever sparkling power : Ana. round me faintly wmspermg the voices of tbo past. Lite ghosts of daya departed, their sorrow3 o'er me CdBt. Their shadow; forms tbat linger aie Vke the evening star, Their robes of airy vesture as white as lilies ate, And with tho wandering ghost-forms from that far land so fair I sue the fire-lights gleaming among their golden hair. Their silver wings around rce waft all the songs of yore, Sweet words of comfoit, too, of peice for evermore; i know that from them cometh the words of cheer ing truth— They tell the deathless beauty of lore's eternal youth. The firelight gleams so brightly ; ah, it reveals to me The forms I loved in childhood when my life was (oil of elee. I wander cow amongst them as in those far-off dayp, 'Wnea we Rather' d golden wattle and haud the tongstei's lays. Their eoft sweet voices linger, and bring me back the spring, When life was full of promise, a better, purer thing. Our lives were then so happy, but night winds softly stray, They whisper in my ear— those joys are far away. The fire is gently smouldering, the embers Iosb thbir plow, The breath of sleep is wafting oblivion to and fro ; The Southern Cross above me I know will gently keep A vigil where I'm slumbering hi Lethe's arms asleep.
