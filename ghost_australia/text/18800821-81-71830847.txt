! PBAGMENT FROM AN OLD LATIN ODE. A Duxii (loop pain ia at my heart, My oyes aro wot with bitter tears, That gosh from thut still ailont fount Tho raomory of bygone yoars. Oh ! that within tho iron gatos Whoro. (loath rcooives tho trembling ghost, Some spot wero found-Bomo quiot nook Whero wo might converso with tho lost ! Whore, for from lifo and light, and pain, In that still shadow of tho tomb, Our souls might moot with theirs, and they Fill in our hearts tho vaoant room. Oh 1 kingdom rioh iu oonquorod spoils ! Oh I land whcnoo nono ann o'er return 1 Tho soul is shut and harrod in thoo Even as tho dust within tho urn. -Jam O. StmjpiQi).JÂ¡ i
