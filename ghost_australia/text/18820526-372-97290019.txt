MOTfi-SONG. ' What dost thou here, Thou dusky courtier,. Within the pinky palace of the ro Here is no bed for thee, No honeyed spicery, — \- But for the golden bee, And the gay wind, and me Its sweetness grows. Eover, thou dost forget ; . Seek thou the passion-flower Bloom of one twilight hour. Haste, thou art late ! Its hidden savors wait. For thee is spread Its soft, purple coverlet ; Moth, art thou sped? — Dim as a ghost he flies Through the night mysteries.' — Miss HtrrcHiNSorr. DEF!
