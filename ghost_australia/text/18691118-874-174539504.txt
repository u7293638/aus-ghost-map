A LODGER'S LAMENT. I CANNOT sleep, there's such a noise-- That horrid man with "saveloys," And whistle shrill, and pies all hot: I wish his ghost at least was shot. Then comes the rowdy muffin's call, And after that the oyster bawl. Not yet enough, with all this slang The Chinaman puts in his twang. * * * * * * * When morning comes at last say I, "I'll have a snoozeâ€”at least I'll try." * * * * * * * Now milk-carts tearing past like mad Are followed by the "rattling cad." And then the odious "Fish, oh!" cries, Deprive of rest your weary eyes; Whilst Arab hosts with Babel tongues Thus early ventilate their lungs. So now, my friends, a caution take If you don't like to lie awake; And look before you leap--into The whereabouts you have in view; Else should you wish to be demented, Take lodgings where 'tis most frequented.
