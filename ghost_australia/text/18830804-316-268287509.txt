' The .winter race meeting of the Sale Turf-Olub was 7 held on Thursday on ' the Greenwattle cpurse and passed off very successfully; notwithstanding that the attendance was hardly so large as anticipated^ which was rather to be wondered, at, considering the beautiful weather -ahd < the fact that the day was a general holiday.^' This was the 'first wiiiter nibeting held'under the auspices of the Sale Turf Club and the' propriety of holding it' wis ! first broached at the time of the last races, when .it .was rightly judged a pity that soi admirable a course as the Greenwattle should only be utilised .on one, occasion during the yearl It was" ' therefore earnestly hoped by all sportsmen that the winter meeting experiment would be so far successfiil'as to result in -its establishment as an ^annual affair;...".An excellent and numerous- list of nbmiriati"ns was received 'for? the.,various'.eventsV and the meeting then promised to , be a most attractive one, but the acceptances, : trjei». unexpectedly few^ and therefore interest dwindled.slightly in the,;ineeting,| and the comparative paucity-of entries.was .doubtless the : reason that a Jarger-number of metropolitan, sportsmen. ,did no.t avail themselves of the excursion fares to pay a visit to the Gippsland capital. In spite; of lliese .drawbacks, however the .meeting was a successful one, being favoured with most magnificent weather. The sunshone brilliantly- throughout the day, and as a considerable number of ladies were present the scene was a very, attractive one,'; but the sombre,hue. of their .attire,;as a;rule,.- lirevented thex;*ourse from having the'same bright and.varied;appearance as at another seasonof the year. NotTOithstanding the recent dry weather the cpurse was hi magnificent order, indeed its condition could not have been improved upon. Inside the paddock there was a.fair ambunt of speculation but the number of bookmakers was rather ini excess iof., that of .backers, and their business- did aot : appear ..to : , t(b very brisk. The members of the ring appeared rather dissatisfied kt^ having^•••&> pay £1 in .order to be ' permitted to ply their avocation in.the paddock, and thought that the payment of £2. at the last meeting should have given them the right! for the; year.' On the fiatmatters were.very lively. There was a large attendance-of the. class who always congregate'- oh n racecourse, sharpers iof almost every-description, and they plied their various traps for the unwary., with ^great spirit. • The police, however, kept a sharp lookout on their" vagaries, and ruthlessly prevented . the. three card trick men from playing their little game, upsetting their tables when- ' ever they, perceived, a man about to commence the swindle Every attention was paid to the'requirements'of the visitors by the various/caterers. Mr Malone,.. of'the Swan Hotel, Latrobe'Bridge, had charge of the inner booth and luncheon room,, and in spite of-.the heavy Btrain put upon his the occasion, /and his catering gave every satisfaction to hiB numeroua -ciistomers. Mr Finegan had "the outaide booth .aid luncheon room, and Messrs' Bailey and Millettalsoprovidedlunchjandbothappearedt(6 be extensively patronised. . -The arrangeinentsiegarding; theraceaV admirable, : punctuality being strictly observed, aud great praise is due to the secretary.-and;the:;;yarious officialB for this -very satisfMtory prder;ol,.ffi , 7 ' I Although the fields in mbst of the, races s were notfarge, itill the racingiitself was capital , The Handicap"Hurdle Race was the first event of the card, for which four horses faced the starter, the few competitors in this and the Selling VjKirdle' 4lace'ftheing'- -a source ,pf .disappointment to; the .public, who generally have a preferencefor jump/ l>y 'winhuig;:pretty-t' esteily.-; sTattle?- {ran rourid- thte firstihurdle- ahdMiBB Lautawas soon after done with, and the race resolved itself' into ,a trial bf strehgth 'between Devilshopf and Miller.
