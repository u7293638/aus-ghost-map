? ' BT BOBERT P.' WHITWB^THC. i WE live this life, travelling over a broader or narrower ledge, between two vast abysses—-the past and the future. Of •the past abyss we kno w something, what' we "are iiaught, not of our own knowledge or experience; of the future abyss, nothing. Is the present life the be all and the end all? Is it, as religion teaches us, a mere precursor, a state of probation- to. another: and "a never ending life? Or is it,, as the ancients taught, one step m the never ending staircase of . time, one rung in the ladder reaching to "eternity ? Who knows ? .Let schoolmen argue as they may, they are [stQl no nearer the great truth. -. Aud yet, for the better comprehension- of the somewhat marvellous r story I am about to tell, it is : Was it^ii dipam ? i Neither :at ihe time whtoJthe|Sneidents I shall relate took place,. nor now, do I know. 1 never could remember dreaming such a dream.
