MR G. K. COUTTS AND THE EM- PLOYEES’ DEPUTATION. TO THE EDITOR. -Yours, &c.;, G. K. COUITS. SIR,—As this is the first time I have ad dressed you in reference to the half holiday question, I trust it will be sufficient apology for taking up a small space in your columns. First,' I desire to' put the Courier right in referencelto my replies to the gentlemen who honoured'me .as a;deputatidn on Wednesday It is a,, strange circumstance that the Star should - state'-.one -thing and the Courier another,, the, former was . near the truth, but did not exactly convey , what L stated. But in the latter - the - deputatipn either. got mixed, or the Courier saw a-ghost. Now, what I did say. was this :—-“ Gentlemen, ’you have come to interview me:about the half-holiday, as you wish to j get information from ;me as president of the Master Tradesmen’s Mutual Protection Association,’’ They answered "Tea.” I replied “ I must bo guarded in what I say, as the association have-already spoken. But if you have come to see.me as plain G, K. Coutts, I; will give you jny opinion,frankly and freely. .Personally, I am in favour of the half-holiday, providing all in our trade close; but I think it very unfair for shopkeepers in the centre of the city and town to close when'the north and south wings are open for business." .Friday is "ah inconvenient day for grocers, but.l would adapt myself, to circumstances, as I have done, if no other day could be chosen.” It is very unfair to me to be misrepresented and blamed while,only doing my duty aa president of the M.T.M.F. Association, a position.whichil con sider it an honour to hold, Mr David Fitz patrick, vice-president of the JSmployis Union, and the ocher gehtlamen-.of [the. deputation, can bear testimony to the above facts.
