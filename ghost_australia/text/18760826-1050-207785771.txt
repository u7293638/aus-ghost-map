' The nun addressed, the nurse of the house,' unlocked a closet, and Father Murphy helped: himself to an opiate, which he; put into a wine-' glass.

Father Murphy coolly surveyed the, contents, made the glass with the opiate half' full from a bottle of wine, and then reading the labels of the jelly turiiblers took down one marked to his taste and returned to the refec tory. He put a spoonful of jelly on a saucer by the Superior, and calmly began eating, the remainder from the glass himself, as he stood near her. Such a sinner as I am, Father, should have none of the good things of this life," said the Superior, eyeing the jelly as if it were an. infernal machine. (" I see terrible ghosts all! the time." " Such frequently arise from an empty stomach," said the matter-of-faet Father. " I must atone for this refreshing of the body by vigils to-night," said the nun. " You must drink that opiate and go to your pallet," said Father Murphy. It is needless to atone for what I bid you do." The nun had finished her sapper. She took the wine-glass in her hand.
