DREADFUL MASSACRE. A '(?UTTER ATTACKED. CAPTAIN AND FOUR NATIVES MURDERED. A CANNIBAL FEAST. Sydnev, .September 4. Another story of the greater portion of ;i ship's crew being massacred was brought to Sydney yesterday by the steamer Moresby, which arrived from New Guinea and island ports. About a month ago a 10-ton cutter, the Sea Ghost, was dis patched by the owner, Mr. Tindall, of Shortland Island, on a trading cruise in the Solomon Group. The cutter was UD'ler the command of Captain (.'olohorn and new the German flag. When approaching the island of Nusa, near Bogainvillc, the captain was in the rigging on the look out for reefs, and he did not notice that the natives ' who hud ptlt off in canoes as usual, had clambered on board in large numbers. Captain (.'olohorn was descending the rigging when the natives made an attack. He was surprised and being unarmed was soon butchered. Four of the native crew made a desperate fight, but the odds against ?them were great and they were overcome. The other two na tives of trie crew were taken prisoners, but afterwards managed to escape. Meanwhile the Sea Ghost had been run ashore, and having been looted of everything valuable was subsequently destroyed. The captain's body was thrown overboard, but the re mains of the four murdered natives were taken to a village for a cannibalistic feast. The German -warship Falke will in due course proceed to the islands to punish the natives.
