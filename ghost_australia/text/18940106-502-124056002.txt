B3arveHBons MeDbouvne. The alleged sales of Molb. properties theso times aro a mirthless fareo. Every now and then some distracted boom-bank reaolvc3 on a specnl effort to got rid of a fow dozon or a fow hundred suburban allotments. Accordnmlv. an exnemiive catalogue is printed, a lot of-odvertising ia dono, tho reserve price3 aro fixed at a minimum which makes the ghosts of tho old boomers weep in their graves, and tho salo oomes off. But nothing ia over sold. Nobody dreams of offering anything even distantly resembling tho resorvo. A small' crowd gathers and looks at tho auctioneer with a despondent eye, aud that is all. The other day, by way of a bol- experiment, the Freehold Investment Co. decided to auction a few properties with no reserve at all, but ouo such experiment is likely to bo enough. Land that fetched £10 a foot three years ago went for 20s., and ground valued approximately at £100 an aero was sold with great difficulty at something like £9. Tho theory that vacant land in tho Melb. suburb3has fallen 50 per cent, was knocked on the head thero and then ; it has fallen 90 per cent., and oven tho romaiuiug 10 per cont. looks shaky and uncertain. ?
