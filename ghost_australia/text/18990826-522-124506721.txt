A Gliost Yarn. A TRAVELLER wa8 very tired ono day and coming to a country inn asked (or a bed for the night, but tho landlady said that the place was full, and no room for anybody, but he was very pressing and said "you ean make room for me in some corner,"and she said, "Oby-thc-bye thore's one little room upstairs where there is a ghost, but he said "ghosts be hanged,they don't trouble me,give me the room." So he had his tea and went to tho haunted room where a barber had committed suioide, and bad just got into bed and pat the light out when ho heard somo very pe culiar sounds such as wh-iz wh-iz. He listened,but the same noise came again, BO he lit the candle and listened again, when he thought he would open tho window,, and to his great surprise found tbRt a liinb of a tree was rubbing up against the window and making that horrid noise. In the next room were a lot of men gambling, and there was plenty of money on the table so be thought he would let them see the ghost. He got a big sheet and put it right over himself, got the tooth powder and rubbed it on bis face so as to whiten it well, and when bo was fixed be marohed out of the room and opened the other door,marching boldly,in, and said in a very peculiar voice"I wants ter shave yer,"and in two seconds there wasn't a soul to be seen in the room, so he just poc keted the money and went off to bed again. In the morning he came down stairs and met the landlord and lady who soid to him, " do you really mean to say that you're alive this morning?"and ho said"yes, why what's the matter?'" "It's a miraole that you're alive," and hp said "why man what's the matter ?" the landlord replied that tbo.ghoBt came and turned all the men out last night, but he said "ghoata don't come to honest men like mo, give me somo break fast and let me go." ? , ? ,
