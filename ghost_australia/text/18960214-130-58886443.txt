An Irving Btory. When Sir Henry Irving was in Dub lin he met a very enthusiastic admirer of the Lyceum productions. Irving had asked him what plays he had seen. "Well," he replied, "I saw 'Romeo and Juliet.' I thought it was simply fine. Miss Terry was simply splendid as Ju liet, especially in the balcony scene you remember the balcony scene, don't you?-where she-" "Oh, yes," replied Irving; "I remember it very well. You know I played Ro meo." "Yes, yes; I remember. Then the nurse-wasn't the' nurse very good? Who is it played that? pat-oh, yes; Mrs Sterling, wasn't it? And the apo thecary-I thought,,h $w erys?&ot; dldn't'yOU-"'" "wVell, what other plays did you see?" asked Irving. * - "Well, I saw 'Macbeth' for one." "Did you like it?" "Oh, yes, especially that scene where Lady Macbeth comes in with the taper, you know, and looks at her hand. How is this that goes? 'Out, damned spot! Out, I say!' And then something about 'the perfumes of Arabia.' And then there's a fine scene between her and Macbeth, where she tells him-I forget, but it was very good. And Banquo was awfully good, don't you think so?" "Well, did you see 'Hamlet!' " asked Irving. " 'Hamlet?' " Oh, yes. Polonius struck me as particularly good in that. Do you remember where he is giving his advice to Laertes? Give thy thoughts no tongue, nor any unproportioned thought his act: Be thou familiar, but by no means vul gar. Those friends thou hast, and something something tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel. "I forget how it goes on. HIoratio was very good, too." "Well, I played Hamlet in that,you know," ventured Irving. "Oh, indeed? Yes, to be sure; I re member. But who was it that played the ghost?" Irving gave it up when it reached this point. Six of the newspapers now published in Germany were established over 200 years ago, the oldest being the "Frank furter Journal," founded in 1615.
