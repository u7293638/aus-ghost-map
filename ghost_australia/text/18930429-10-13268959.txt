LAUNCESTON. FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] Friday. At the Police Court to-day Maud Phillips, for throwing stones through the windows belonging to Henry Graham, was fined £1 or 14 days in gaol. Alfred Mancey, on a charge of forging an order with intent to defraud, was further remanded. H. Wilson, on a charge of stealing some paint brushes, was ordered to enter into recognisances for good behaviour for six months. The ghost of the Ward question having been plentifully sprinkled, exercised, and laid yesterday, a now matter of Municipal management cropped up. Yet hardly a new one, for the complaint that the Council are making too much profit out of the water supply is by no means a new one, but it is becoming more active, especially in these times, when every penny of outlay has to be considered. The trouble is with the water districts outside the city boundaries. Those within have the pleasure of knowing that if they help to make up a profit on the water supply it comes back again to them in the shape of better roads and paths, and lightens the general rate. But not so those outside the charmed circle They were strangers, and the Council kindly took them in," Of course it was at their own request, and while the suburbs were thinly populated the rate of Is. 6d. in the £1 did not total more than a fair rate of interest on outlay and proportion of first cost, now things are different, and the request made is a reasonable one, for the contributions of the outsiders makes a handsome donation to the city funds. There is a good prospect of a concession being made, as most of the City Fathers are of the opinion that the rate is too high.
