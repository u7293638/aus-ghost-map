EARTH'S STARVING MILLIONS. Fight not with ghosts and shadows ; let us hear. The snap of chain links. Let our gladdened ear Catch the pale prisoner's welcome as the light ?? Follows thy axe stroke through his cell of night. Be. faithful to both worlds, nor think to feed Eairth's starving millions with the husks of Servant of him whose mission high and holy Was to the wronged, the sorrowing, and the ?lowly, , Thrust not his Eden promises from our sphere, Distant- and dim beyond the blue sky's span; Like him of Patmos see it now and hereâ€” The new Jerusalem comes down to man.
