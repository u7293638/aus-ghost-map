A recital of the well-known ' " Christmas Carols" of Dickens, ' which have been selected by many eloquent exponents for production in iiublic, was given last night in the Mechanics' institute by the Rev 6. Percival, of Albany, in aid of the funds of tho Wesleyan Church. The Rev H. K. Hutohisou had a seat on the stago ; also tho Mavor. who was announced to preside. and after the latter had made Beveral appreciative comments upon tho themo, he introduced the entertainer. There was a fairly good attendance of the public, and much applause accorded dur ing the recital, which was an enlivening and talented one. The stage was left clear to Mr Percival, who, on coming to the front, was greeted with much applause. Having a clear, flexible voice, it was perceived from his manage ment of it that he would give a realistic repre sentation of tiie sordid, miserly, misanthropic, Scrooge, and this ho did with much ability. This was the foregruund of thu representation of tile first portion of tho story, which Mr Percival divided into parts, having between each musical selections by Mrs Racks! raw, Miss Parker Mr J. W. Ircdnle, and others, These consisted of 3uarlettes and solos, Mr Pcroival rendered rjsmatically tho various characters introduced by Dickens into his Carols, Old Scrooge had to he frightened into ordinary human goodness by apparitions ; Marluy's ghost, Scrooge's nophow, Mr Plump's sister, Boh Cratchett, Tiny Tim, and Old Ferzwigg. These were all graphically portrayed. Tho terror of Scrooge's, tho jollity of Cratchett and his family at the Chriatmas dinner were strong parts. Pathos and comedy had alternative play, and both were felicitously represented by Mr Percival. With the recital and thu music tho audience was well entertained. At tho close, the usual complimentary votes of thanks were passed.
