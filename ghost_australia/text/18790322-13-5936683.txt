BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL noujEs. IN STEPS OF CRUSADERS. Br J. H. No commendation of early rising ever came from the First The habit there is of the climate, and all folks are early astir, as old folks are everywhere because no further sleep can be got As naturally as possible we are all out and about at r a m, and by half-past 6 breakfast 13 over, without a newspaper to help its digestion Our camp tents and boots and small and night troubles are told in place of news of the day The two sleeping tents are down, and with their contents packed on mule back by time the table is cleared The cooking tent had similarly disappeared before we were all in the saddle and even the breakfast tent was don 11 and packed before we were fairly on the way It looked magical work 111 its expedition, but I recalled that it was done by Arab hands that had packed tents from childhood, as their forefathers had done for all time These Bona of Ishmael have the knowledge of this tent pitching and removing so ingrained in their nature that, with the requisite number of mules to help them, they would clear away a tent township in half a day, and have it fixed up again twenty miles away. by night fall After that morning I Bit at breakfast where I can watch their movements and see how to rope a tent, rope it around its pole and have it strapped on mule back in that shortest of time known as a differ I see now the meaning of a modern poet a metaphor The cares that oppress the day Shall fold their tents like the Arabs And as silently steal away And so in a straggling string we leave old Moppa and its steep and narrow streets In one of these I notice over a ramshackle looking building, the words " Hotel of the Twelve Tribes, sufficiently reminding me of the land that I am in I don't think I would change tent life for the probable accommodation there. It looks altogether as if a slur teenth tribe, and perhaps a fourteenth would be about that would make up in their activity and attentions for any of the rest twelve Two tents with their addenda of poles ropes, and pegs, stuffed out also with all sorts of tent furniture are carried by one mule He is quite lost amid the load that so sticks out all around him Another 0110 carries two heavy chests of two hundred weight Swung on each side of him, in which the canteen is packed. Antoine, our cook, J has a mule to himself, on which he squats, Seemingly cross-legged, with his tent and large array of pots, pans, and kettles all around him It is something novel to me to see the work that can be got out of a mule I have now infinite respect for him, as also for his heels, in which there is shown a great reserve of power, neat and small as they are, when he flings them out A mule fetches in Syria six, times the price of a horse Great strength and sureness of foot are primary recommendations, but his powers of abstinence and endurance are hardly to be called secondary ones I was about to say that these powers were quite super human, and so they are After fifteen miles of jog trotting in a hot sun, with four hun- dred weight on his back and hanging to his sides, I see him cross a brook at full jog trot, never staying tower his lips is one of our horses-nor their riders, for the matter of that-are self denying enough to follow the example A mule always keeps a shut mouth, and therefore a moist throat From what I noticed of the scattering power of a mule s heels, he could, I think, be made more useful in warfare than the horse or the elephant Backed gently but firmly into a mob, however riotous he would disperse them quicker than policemen or grape shot There was a mule with us that-from what I saw of him looked likely to have kept the Booian bridge equally as well as Horatius or the dauntless two that aided him This ignoble animal never falls be the road ever so bad, and it cannot be worse than 111 Palestine He jogs on at a Chinaman's trot over sand and shingle, and also boulders that are the size of melons for mile after mile at his one unvarying pace and up and down hill sides that we, all unburdened, find troublesome He beats the camel in such work That "ship of the desert 13 good over sand only and for going long between his drinks CK or stony ground and muddy ways he is nowhere with the mule, and in positive danger for himself His feet, large as washbowls and sponge like play out as he steps, and are only in place on the sand for that alone nature made them He slips down in muddy spots, and his fall 13 generally final His legs are too apt to break His burthen is in that case removed, and he 13 pierced in the neck as is a sheep and left for the vultures, who are always hovering in the East, though they may be as they generally are, out of sight of human eyes A camel s face is a compound of that of a sheep and of a monkey in spectacles The effect is mild and comical until one gets used to it. He lets his under lip hang down man untidy manner not pleasant to the sight I never saw a clean looking camel and conclude that they are never groomed Their hair either grows patchy, or 13 worn off in all sorts of places The general look of their exterior is that of a worn out sheepskin mat of ancient date The young camel has a painful appearance of deformity He is all hunch back, and has, to western eyes, an unnatural appearance A stately march is the only place I ever saw them at Anything seems to come welcome to the camel in the way of food He goes beyond the mule and the ass in eating thistles as he feeds often upon hedgerows fenced with a cactus that pricks through one 3 boots Thedromedarj is the running animal of the camel species He 13 trained to that and kept for saddle and not for burden Some dromedaries have their lunch divided in youth, as I saw doing by liga tures bound tightly round it A hen BO Ben ed, there IS a space between the divided parts for a saddle-the parts of the hump before and behind serving for supports At a distance a camel or dromedary would but for his four legs, resemble an emu His neck is similar, he looks as ragged, and has the walk and movements of that denizen of the Australian desert As Jerusalem is upwards of forty miles from Joppa, a night's stoppage is made on the journey We had started in advance of the baggage, piloted by the dragoman, and made but poor progress It has been Easter week, and we find the road full of pilgrims on the return journey from the Jordan camels mules, and donkeys are packed up with riders and their baggage The seat for women and girls seems to be a mattress doubled up and laid on the animals back It is Chaucer s Canterbury Pilgrim pro cession shifted into the present time 3\. here was no Tabard Inn unfortunately, to make halt at, which served to show how uncivilised things are here Camping out under the rocks, and any tree that could be found, had to suffice for Tibard accommodation One does not need go far in this country to realise the meaning and the blessing of " the shadow of a great rock in a weary land in the way that I have had no pilgrimage forced upon me by a creed, I am glad that I am of the country whose prevalent faith requires none These pilgrims that stop our way are of the Greek Church, that requires baptism by thrice immersion, and they prefer the Jordan as sacred water for that purpose The Catholics, Mahomedans, and Hindoos have also their long pilgrimages " To many a shrine, By faith and ages mode divine Pilgrimages such as these are no rosewater affairs, and require no peas in the shoes to make greater the sufferings of the pilgrim Other reward than such being accounted unto one for righteousness would be all too slight It says much that compels thought that the ground that we shall tread for the next two days was that trodden by most of the cru ยก saders Of the eight expeditions of those famous church militants send soldiers, am robbers, the majority want this way on their march to Jerusalem for the world changes There 19 the same cause now as there in from 1090 to 1250 for these expeditions to rid the land of the Cross from the curse of the Crescent, but religious enthusiasm does no seem to run to warfare among the present J European representatives of Christendom Every thing can be debited, and it is 1 likely as not that all great movements depends for stimulus on one earnest soul and subduing spirit Another Peter the Hermit may be all that is wanted for the preaching up 0 another crusade That the pen is mightier than the sword 13 not more true than that the tongue of the enthusiast unsheath the sword as that of Peter did every side wielded in that long warfare The movement he so began leading to 1 king leaving the throne 0 England and forgetting his kingship to join in the third crusade, is but an instance of the prodigious power that religious enthusiasm once exercised in Christendom Though the rule of the Crescent over the land of the Cross and over all other lands for the matter of that should be extinguished, it is perhaps as well for the world that such cannot be again done by religious enthusiasts, or those so calling themselves Vi hat there is of road is too narrow in its practicable path for our going otherwise than 111 Indian file fashion It is just as well, because much attention is needed to get out of the way of the sharp corners of the passing baggage Calculations had to be nicely made as to that and the swing of the camel from side to side in his peculiar walk duly included in it, as otherwise our heads and knees got often punished It is best I find, to let the horse choose his own path he seems to know the road well, and has a knack of finding the best parts of it that has been acquired by birthright and perfected by practice Bridle tracks are what the roads of Pale tine really are, and all the loose stones about in the land seemed to have drifted into them The horses are shod with planes that not at the bottom of their feet Such shoeing prevents any of the many stones being picked up by the hoof, but affords a poor foothold among the loose boulders all about A stumble looks very probable, and a broken arm or leg to follow There is no surgeon near to give assistance nor any decent place handy in which to he up for the necessary month or more Such thoughts will come when the horse's feet slide about much, and they do that too frequently A sort of a Sheik s head dress is super vised by us in the shape of a handkerchief so tied on the head that part of it hangs over the neck and ears Such is found necessary in addition to the umbrella, but I make it a substitute for that covering, and so follow the dragoons fashion, and welter along in the sultry air until noonday, by which time we have been a long five hours in the saddle and feel as if we had been fifteen The miserable pace, the barren looking country, and the state of the atmosphere, all contributed to that feeling The stop that we have now come to is at Bamleh-supposed to be the old Roman and Arimathea of the Scriptures an ugly, wretched old place, that jet looked like Paradise to our half baked eyes Outside the town we camp on the side of hilly ground, under shelter of some trees Near at hand is the broken arch of what seemed to have been an old church A glance at the old stones lying about tells the truth Vie are stopping in a churchyard again Among old tombs we eat our midday meal, as we had supper and slept and breakfasted among them at Joppa On one side can be seen in the distance that Lydda from which Peter came to raise Tabitha from the dead lins midday snack has been carried along with us by an Arab, whose duty such is to be henceforward and whose water bottles we often trouble It is a very frugal meal, in its way but we had no idea that any fruit could taste so du finely as those Joppa oranges did to our parched tongues The begging lepers beset us as we enter the gates of old Ramleh, a town of Greek Christians and Mahomedans, Bomb three thousand in number The lepers carry this tied to their wrists, which we perceive, as they protrude them towards us, 13 necessitated by their hands being fingerless part of the fearful ravages that this old scourge of eastern countries had made upon them The dragoman had not told us of these people, but the information was not needed What they were seemed to dawn upon one naturally as their wretched state was regarded They beg at the gate of every town much as they did in the olden days, and will in the days to come Ramleh has a Greek and a Latin convents the latter a very fine one Outside its gates is a walled cemetery, on the door of which I read' Ccmetanum de taste Sancho The town itself is an old fossil, having two dirty lines of squalid ' bazaars, the articles in which look as if they had been there since the days of King David The streets have apparently not been swept or washed down since his day in some spots I caught my self holding my nose, but I was as yet green in Holy Land travel, and soon learned to drop such squeamishness as nose holding It got so used by the sun before the next day was over, and was then too tender to be so squeezed As we got back to our graveyard on the hillside our baggage mules came jogging by on their way to our camping place for the night That will be seen in every days programme VAe leave them behind packing up in the early morning and they pass us at the mild day resting place The bells round the neck of the mules make a pleasant clatter- partly needful as their little unshod hoofs cause no noise to intimate their coming Every thing even a camel clears out of the way of our mules that carry the two big canteen chests and the tents which would otherwise have knocked anything short of an ele 1 liant off its legs Our travel after wards is not at a rate that enables us to catch up with our household They are not seen again until the camping ground for the night in reached, when the four tents will be found pitched ready for us with English and American flags flying at their sole heads Ramleh has an ancient white looking square tower which makes a landmark for miles around, standing amid the ruins of an old mosque A good view is got from its hundred and twenty feet summit, which is reached by a winding staircase We see from here the long snake like path that stretches across the plain that will be part of our afternoon a pilgrimage for another long five hours We have already come to the conclusion that a little of our kind of travelling goes a long way the way of thoroughly satisfying one Our dragomans business in the matter may make it pleasanter to him, but his way of life is not one in which any of us are likely to start in opposition Although these are our early days of Palestine experience we have seen enough of the country to make us hate for ever the Turks and their mode of misgovernment Very little land is cultivated here, and for the good reason that the agriculturist would be only working for the tax buyers and collectors An eighth of every thing is popularly supposed to be taken for tax, but the taxes to be collected in Syria are sold at Constantinople The buyer resells districts at a profit and those buyers resell again, so that the last purchaser has to collect or rob nearly everything that a taxpayer has in order to get round again Those who may go into Egypt and Syria for however little distance and short a time will we wonder why England and her statesmen should pet and pamper the Turk in the way they have done He is the bad son of the European family, and yet gets stuffed with British money and pampered with that support from England but for which Turkey would, in the order of nature, have long since fallen to pieces from sheer decay The condition of this Ttukiah governed Palestine shows to the most casual of observers that the system of government is to rob the people of all the profit of their labour, and to do nothing for them or their land in return The curse fell indeed upon this land when the Turks became its masters On a hillside we pass what remains of the once royal city of Gozir, that was given by one of the 1 "j plum Pharoahs to Solomon 13 a marriage portion with one of his wives the dragoman could not tell her name or number Further on is all that remains of Latron, a place considered sacred from being the traditional birthplace of the Good Thief Though the remains of an old castle are there to be seen, with other curios the attractions are not enough to take us off the track Vie are kept awake over the sultry plain chiefly by the necessity of avoiding the coming camels, which are loaded up like furniture vans They come swinging along, with capacious wooden and a wicker baskets to their sides in which are women and children lately baptised in the Jordan-a washing the life of which is not likely to be got by them formally a month And here to the north of the plain has Isaiah, that was of some size and importance when the crusaders passed this way. It is the furthest east that Richard the first ever made in Palestine He went no further than here on his way to Jerusalem, on that third crusade in which he joined Cour de Leon here gave second and best thoughts to the matter, and returned to Joppa made peace with Saladin, and remembered that he was King of England, and was wanted there and not here The lion hearted one gets much of that title by favour, and in the way in which the First Charles is called a martyr In j out h I believed in both of them, and used to much admire Coeur de Leon, in coloured prints fighting Saladin on horse back in a battle axe combat of two that never occurred Not one of us but thinks that he did quite right here in turning back, and would perhaps do likewise, but our courage is superior to our opinions, and so we go further into trouble Emmaus 13 next passed, on a hill side It could not have been much more than a v i large at any time, and is nothing now but ruins, as also a remembrance of that memorable walk that was taken thither of which we are told in the last chapter of Luke It is the recollection of such like things that alone gives interest to heaps of old stones ages ago left to the jackal, the lizard, and the scorpion We now descend into a valley to which a little village on the opposite mountain gives a name It is Ajalon, and the valley is more famous than the village from the miracle by which it is made memorable In this valley is our camping place for the night. At six in the evening, as we go down its side, we can see our four white tents already pitched, and the light smoke of the sticks that are lighting the charcoal cooking fires The camp, with the mules tethered around it, might have been standing for days by" the look of it, but it has been there scarcely thirty minutes As these tents will be our home for the next five weeks, we begin to regard them with proper feelings They are pitched in this instance close to a well, appropriately named after Joan In a valley remembered only by Joshua, great deeds this well commemorating his great fighting successor seems quite in place Mount Gibson is among the mountains of Judea to our left as we face towards the Jerusalem road The valley of Ajalon runs away to the horizon on the right We all get biblical at once, and forget the coolant, dinner altogether The tenth chapter of Joshua becomes of absorbing interest We read how the five kings of the Amontes laid siege to the great city of Gibeon because it had leagued with Joshua and the Israelites and how the Gibeonites sent for Joshua and his fighting men to come up from Gilgal How Joshua came upon the besiegers suddenly, after a nights march, slew many and routed the rest, who were pursued by the Israelites, and also by a hail storm, the stones of which killed more than fell by the sword. HowJo3hua desirous to complete the Amontes destruction by day light, bade the sun to stand still upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon How he was obeyed by those three names until the enemy was destroyed, and Joshua had. found the five kings of the Arno rites hidden in a cave, from whence he took them and hanged them all The record tells us that " there was no day like that before or after it, in which supernatural power was BO given to man The moon is visible to us above this Valley of Ajalon as we look up from our reading, and gaze all round upon the scene of such miracles Joab s well has stone walls to two sides of it, on which a large stone, with a bucket hole in the centre, form a roof It is fully fifteen feet in circumference and thirty in depth The water to our thirsty throats is cool and delicious, as, indeed, we found all the waters of this country After drinking pints, we caused our roasted heads m buckets of it, and filled all our water bottles A creek runs through the valley, in which our cattle found good drinking Our dragoman could not say in which particular battle of King Davids great captain this well had got his name, but promised to be posted up in it against our next visit The reading and the talk that we had upon the subject of the scene that evening followed us in our sleep, which, in this valley, was as much disturbed by fleas as it had been by snails the preceding night at Joppa I dreamt that there entered to our tents the ghosts of the slaughtered Amontes, whose captain spoke for them, asking who we were that pitched warlike tents in that valley flying flags that were to him unknown Came we to right their wrongs that their ghosts might at last find rest' I asked what troubled them that they could not rest and let others do likewise I was answered that they would not rest until justice was done to them that they had gone out to fight men and not supernatural powers, and had been unfairly fought against and murderously slain ' Could we assist them-we that flew strange flags, and encamped in their grave strewn valley ' I explained that the flags were those of England and America, two nations to which all the people of this land were but as handful, and which had now given up fighting battles -referring their differences to arbitration, conferences, and congresses for the settlement of all claims and damages, direct and consequential Something very profane about arbitrations seemed to be said by the captain of the Amontes in reply , but I was awakened just then by a flea bite deeper than usual, and so missed it I gave up further attempt at sleep, and went out into the moonlight, and sat upon the slab that covers Joab s well, and so let ones sleepless fancy off the chain We dont go to Palestine to eat drink, and sleep There is no land that has so little that is pleasant to the outward eye, and so much that is visible to the optics of the mind As there were no fleas about here however, fatigued nature got a fair chance, and I went again, to sleep The dragoman who woke me afterwards in the early morning, said that sleeping in the moonlight was most dangerous in this country Moonstruck folks, however, though often spoken of, I have never yet met, and have come to think of such as but myths talked of but never seen The camp servants drew water and soused over our flea bites, and we breakfasted and started on our third day a stage that would bring us to the walls of Jerusalem In mounting we found our legs would not go over the saddle as briskly as on the morning before Our joints got out of order for some days in our wretched style of travelling, in which it seemed impossible to make much of a break to relieve the monotonous jog trot We pass through from the plains of Sharon, of which the famous roses seem to be but mere wild flowers and crow the India called the mountains of Judd These were 01100 clothed with trees, but the necessity for fuel has helped, aided by the ancient curse and the modern Turkish Government, to desolate all the land of Palestine there will soon be no a tree in it. It seems a pity that one of the dominant religions that have been in this land had not made it an article of faith that a tree should be planted where one has been cut down It would have helped to save Priceless sterile stony Sistrom its present barren state On our right is now i pleas inter looking old village than usual It overlooks a valley, and is I noun as Ixirjath Jearim Just before reaching that our dragoman points out a brook s bed that we cross as being that from which David took the pebble that brought Collah Lou Vic- don't question its identity, as we are glad of anything that gives a reason for a rest and so stop to pick up pebbles and gather the roses of Sharon lins Kirjath Jearim was where the ark was lodged for twenty years in the house of Abinadab in the hill It was taken thence by David to Jerusalem and somewhere on the way we are now treading went that grand procession that we all now turn to read of in the sixth chapter of the second book of Samuel Our pocket bibles are always in use We pass a ruin on a ridge of the mountain that has a most conspicuous minaret for a landmark Its name is now Samuil but it was anciently called by that name of Mizpah which some modern rings so commemorate Descending now to the Valley of Elah, we look to the left down n glen in which are to be seen some attempts at cultivation credited to the Convent of St John there situated The road now leads up a tedious ascent, that is made worse by its stony character, the iron shod hoofs of our horses ringing at every step The hot sun now poured down its rays most powerfully for fully half an hour we were all too serious to talk, but our silence was the more elo- quent. Toiling to the top of this range we have come upon a table land, and our dragoman calls a halt and a rest for the horses It is midday, but we are not to dismount there as at the same time on the day previously We are to camp shortly for our midday meal and a weeks stay under the walls of Jerusalem That city of faith and fame is there in the distance with its minarets and domes glittering in the sun, and the greater dome of the Mosque of Omar particularly conspicuous We pass along to it through some suburban which is the strange light of some newly finished buildings and others in progress TotheleftisthecathedraloftheGreek Church, built by Russia, and on the opposite side a building which I was told was that of " German deaconesses something of the convent sort, I supposed Over its gate I read ' Tahtha Fund We now pass the Damascus gate, and pitch our tents some little distance past a house in which I shall daily see Holman Hunt engaged in painting "The Flight into Egypt Hassan, our dragoman, improves on ac quaintanceship He knows five languages, and speaks and writes good English He has accompanied nineteen distinct Beta of pilgrims from Egypt. to the Holy City His contempt is great for all books, in which respect he is as an Arab and a true country men of that Caliph Omar who destroyed the Alexandrian library He has a neat way of satisfying doubts and quelling scepticism He heard us at Ajalon discussing, the question of the sun's standing still and made the matter clear at once that it did so and the reason why "You say that the sun stands still now ' To which he was answered affirmatively " Well, you read that Joshua stopped its course but is it anywhere said that he ever set it going again'' Such answer was conclusive and saved a world of argument on a subject on which there should be none I had that right feeling on such matters even as a child, when a zealous curate vainly endeavoured for half an hour to prove to me and half a dozen other Sunday school children that Jacob was nothing to his father in saying that he was Esau An elaborate essay followed to show that it was a deception and not a lie and that deceptions were justifiable when the end was good, and that it was to the good of Jacob to get what he did by deception ' I lost the run of that curate, but I have good hope that he became ultimately promoted Ave thereupon thought of referring all matters of similar doubt for Hassan's clearing up, but as such looked too much like helplessness, we took counsel together As differences about matters of belief have caused more bloodshed and bitterness among men than anything else in the world, we come to an understanding with a view to avoid squabbling One of us is a good Catholic or High church man, another a strict Presbyterian Strong upon the Sabbath and swearing, a third calls himself a Low church man, and another a no church man In such a medley of beliefs and no particular belief, it was difficult to hit upon any course that would please all and insure a truce for thirty six-days' After that time we might quarrel as we liked and return to those cherished ideas that are ingrained and ineradicable with most of us. The matter was discussed during the mid-day rest, and again brought up in the after dinner hour Divers vain efforts having failed at any result, the difficulty comes at last to the knowledge of Hassan, who thinks he has that in his pocket book which will suit us It is a relic of another party similar to ourselves whom he had once conveyed The rules they had drawn up had been given to Hassan, when signed as custodian or trustee on behalf of all When the journey was ended, the delivery up of this document had been overlooked With a trifling alteration, it was much like what we wanted, and served our turn, though I kicked at the conservatism of the second clause of it Omitting the signatures There copy it, with apologies to those who years back had come speed it, should they ever see their for gotten rules for peace and quietness thus 111 1 rint - Resolved in the spirit of conciliation and not of criticism "1 That as we are travelling in a country under JIahomeddan LOV eminent, the peculiar respect paid by that faith to all records shall be shown by us to those of this land 2 That we travel for the confirmation of our beliefs, whatever they may be 3 that's appearances are deceitful, they shall always be so treated, and our senses never trusted when at variance with preconceived ideas ' 4 That as matters of fact fiction, and faith are here so interwoven, the three "shall be counted as one D That where every authority differs all shall be deemed right ' C That it shall not matter if they are all wrong ' 7 That as a final refuge for vexed minds on any difficult subject, it shall be, as the old lady said of the sermon, presumptuous to attempt to understand it SOME experiments have recently been made in the Navy yard at Brooklyn with a view to utilising petroleum as fuel instead of coal At a very trifling cost an enormous degree of heat was easily attained, estimated at 5 000deg,bj which iron was melted in 10 minutes, instead of taking, in ordinary circumstances, two hours, and glass in two hours instead of 10 The petroleum was prepared for use by mixing the crude oil with pitch The mixture was placed in a reader v ear, from which it was forced by a jet of super-heated steam into the already lighted furnace, arriving there in a state of spray, when, fed by the oxygen contained and carried in by the steam, it burnt rapidly and with great intensity Further experiments are to be made with a view of perfecting the system of utilising petroleum as fuel The process is a development of the method adopted at the oil w ells of Petrolia of utilising the refuse produced in the refining of the crude oil, where the bituminous matter, re Rcmbhng pitch, yielded in the early stages of refining, is afterwards used as fuel for the engines employed at the wells
