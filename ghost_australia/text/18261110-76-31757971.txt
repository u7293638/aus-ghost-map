SELECT POETRY. MOWBRAY CASTLE. . THE full moon shone on the foliag'd trees, Which gently wav'd in the evening breeze ; And the distant hills caught her yellow light, As rising she chas'd the darkness of night Oh! bright and fair was her lovely beam; And it left a trace like some sweet dream; For the soul was calm in that peaceful hour,. And passion was lull'd by her soft'ning power; Which so mildly stole on my languid heart, That I fondly sigh'd from the scene to part. All around was still ;-but the solemn bell, From its gothic tower, echo'd thro' the dell; Where proudly stood, in the days of yore, A mighty pile which is seen no more: And nought is left to tell of its fame; And all that is known is the lo'ty name Of the warrior chief who the fortress own'd. Now all is mute, and the grassy mound Abides on that spot were shining shield, And glitt'ring spear, gleeni'd o'er the field; And beneath the ground the sounding cell Gives a mock response to time's dread knell. Great Mowbray's ghost there stalks o'er the site Of his ruin'd towers, by the misty light Which Luna casts on the fading spoils : Where time with unceasing ardour toils, To crush what remains of the buried tower, And leave but its name to speak of its power ! ! \+ Which once reared its lofty battlements at the town of Thirsk,. Yorkshire, but of Which no vestage remains at the present day. G, Y. HARRISON.
