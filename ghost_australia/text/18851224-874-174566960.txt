NUMEROUS DISSERTATIONS ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS- BY THE BARON. No. I.—PLUM PUDDING. THE derivation of this word is envolved in mystery, as are often the ingredients. 11 periodically makes its-appearance, like the Ghost of Banquo, at the festive board. It is subsequently brought vividly to the remembrance by a nightmare that lavishly distributes the bedclothes to the four corners of the room, and finishes up like an earthquake. Beyond the knowledge that it is brought from the kitchen, nothing certain is known of the birthplace of the gay plum-pudding. Its destination is expedited by rapid consumption. It was first invented, or dish-covered, by Captain Cooh, at Feed-ye (Fiji). By-the- way, talking of plum-puddings, and other musical instruments, it is an annual custom to pour brandy over it, and ignite the ardent fluid. As the great merit of a plum-pudding consists in its being light, probably this is done with a view to make it lighter. Strict'. etiquette prohibits a second helping of anything, policy does the same for plum-pudding. Here is a recipe for its manufacture— Lay in a plentiful supply of currants, pills, etc. Take plenty of milk and flour, taking special care to distribute the greater part over your clothes. On no account remove the stones from the currants ; and put the citrons in exactly as you buy them. It saves trouble, and delights the consumer. The sagest advice we can bestow is " save thyme." When the pudding is a little more mixed than these directions, set aside to bake. Wrap it in muslin and tie with silk. When the pudding is done—but we anticipate. If you ever get anyone to eat it they will repent, and so will you. Time of baking—from ten days to a week. Cost of material—a severe headache. Sufficient for three nightmares and a fit of indigestion. Serve up cold, taking care to provide a tomahawk.
