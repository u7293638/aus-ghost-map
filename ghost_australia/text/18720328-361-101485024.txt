About twenty years ago he (the doctor) stated that the times mentioned by Daniel, and also in the Apocalypse, so far as he could see the solution of a sub ject confessedly difficult, would expire in the year 1868, and that those who lived to that year, would see, perhaps, these phenomena all upon a scale, and with a splendour, a majesty, and subl;mity unpreccdnted. Some of his hearers said he was rash, whilst others whom be had conversed with since had admitted.that he was right. Ho had predicted that by 1868 the Papal apostaey should be broken \--tbat the kings of Europe who for a thousand years had supported the Pope and been his champions and apologists, instead of assisting, encouraging, and defending him, would, in the language of the Apocalypse, oat and drink as with fire, and the whole states of the kings of Europe would be revolutionised. lu1868 -the very year-the Pope summoned an (Ecumenical Couoncil, ind the question. was put to him why he had not included in the invitation to the council the crowned heads of Europe, who were always at previous councils. The anoswer of the Pope was that the middle age of Europe had gone, and lie bad not a single crowned head who was then his friend whom he dare invite to be present at the (Ecumenical Council. It was decided at that Council that the Pope was infallible, a thing never before impersoated in a single individual, and in the words of Archbisbop Manning, " What the Pope speaks upon dogmas, poltics, ethics, morals, upon doctrines, lie is as true as God Almichty could claim to be," and hence the Tablet hal the following words: -" The Churoh that dares to assert that the Pontiff is infallible is either speaking by the inspiration of the Devil, or it is the very mouthpiece of the Holy Ghost;" in other words, we must either accept that Church as the inepiration of the Devil or the mouthpiece of the Holy Ghost, What next took place? It was strange, but nevertheless true, that if the Pope blessed anybody, suhob a person was sure to come to grief, whereas if he cursed any. body he was sure to prosper. The Era. peror of Austria, for instance, warred against Prussia and befor he he sot out Ihe and leis army were especially blessed by the Pope, the blessing resulied in Sudowa The Queen of Spain received the golden rose, and the Pope's special blessing ; but eearcely had the blessing settled upon her head than she was fugitive from her coon. try. Mlzxitilian received the blo'sing of the Pope, and was murdered. The Ppe cursed Victor Emmauuel in the most terrific terms-in terms which even uneducated people would stignatiso as course invective. What followed the curse? Victor Emmanuel is now King of Italyl His son is King of Spain, and his daughter is Queen of Portugal. All thre/weroe ursed by the Pope, and all throo/are among the most eouviable Sovoreigns in Europe. Wherever the Pope's blessing fell there thorns and briars seemed to spring up. Had any of the prodiotions rcoorded received that fulfilmuot which would justify them in believinig that proplooy was oeasing to be prodiotion, and was being translated into living. and actual, history? Ilo main. tained they had. Takeo for instance, another one in theo 24th Matthbow-'' To Gospel shall be preaceod in all tbo world for a witness, nod then shall the ond of the ngo be." Had the Gospel boon proiohed to overy one?
