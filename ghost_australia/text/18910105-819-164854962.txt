A STRANGE GHOST. As we sat round the table, covered with a red cloth, as a contrast to the green dishes, and lighted with wax candles, in old-fa6hioned brass candle sticks, our hostess told us how once the house was overfull on the occasion of a wedding, and how she had had to put a couple of girls in the ghost room, thinking there would,at all events be safety in numbers, and one would protect the other during the short hourB of the August night. " I shall never forget the girls when they came into our room," said she, laughing, "for they tore in in the middle of the night, and told us they had heard a succession of shots in the next room, followed by the falling of heavy drops of blood on the floor. I must say I felt a trifle squeamish myself ; but Tom got up, and he and I went in, and sure enough we heard the blood dropping too. It was a very still night, with the harvest moon just over the house yonder, and it shone in, so we didn't want any candles; and as we stood there listening it had rather a gruesome sound ; but all at once Tom said,1 There's naught but your jam closet there, misBus ; there's no room for either pistols or blood ; and in a moment I knew what it was. I'd been bottling gooseberries some weeks ago, and put 'em in thereout of the way, and the horrid things had fermented, or something, and gone on working, until they had popped out the corks, and the blood was my nice ripe red gooseberry juice falling down on the shelves and creeping out under neath. For there! I'd forgotten the best part of the story, which was that the girls wouldn't call us until they saw the blood actually coming into the room—a sight they showed us naturally enough when we came in with 'em. I can tell you they were laughed at, and they don't like being offered ripe gooseberry tart even now! If you'll come with me, I can show you exactly where the ghost was."'— J. M. Panton.
