SPORTING. V.R.C. GRAND NATIONAL MEETING. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, July 19. The Grand National meeting of the V.R.C. took place on Saturday at Flemington before a large attendance, including His Excellency the Governor and suite. Owing to rain during the night the course was very heavy, and falls were numerous over the big jumps. The racing was first-class, large fields being the order of the day. The Maiden Hurdle Race was the first event on the card, for which no less than fourteen animals weighed. Ilip pogriff, the favorite, cantered in an easy winner, followed by Sea Breeze and Duration. The Maiden Steeplechase saw seven horses at the post, Reticent being a firm favorite. He justified the go*! opinion nf backers by winning easily by ten lengths, Lady Ashton being second, and Kulkyne third. None of the others got round the course. Ten weighed out for the Grand National Hurdles, the public fancy being Sheet Anchor, the odds apainst him being 5 to 4. _ This pot, however, boiled oxer, as the favorite was never in the race, the winner turning up in the South Aus tralian horse Agent, who started second favorite. Guardhsh led twice vouud to the abattoirs, where Agent overhauled him, and won eventually by two lengths, Cockboat being third. Croker, the rider of Tantaliser, sus tained concussion of the brain tlirough a severe fall caused by Star cannoning with tbe firat named horse. Croker was taken to the Mel bourne Hospital, where he is progressing favorably. Only fourteen horses were left in the Grand National Steeplechase, but as they contained the pick of the cross-country horses of Australasia very great interest was centered in the event. The Ballarat horse Morven was established first favorite at fours to one, while his stable companion, Wymlet, and Governor wore next in demand at a point wore. Den mark, Progress, Forester, Sailor, and Leo were also well supported. The race -was a chapter of accidents. Of the fourteen who started only three passed the judge's box after going the course. Wen mark and Native alternately led till near home, the hitter coming down at the double near the turn. This allowed Sailor to show the way into the straight, closely followed by Denmark. At the carriage paddock Wymlet came away and landed his owner's colors six lengths in front of Sailor, a similar distance Refloating the top-weight Denmark, who ?\\-w third, from Sailor. Notwithstanding the number of falls, none of the jockeys were severely hurt, although Scobie and Air. H. Watson got severe shakings. Leo so severely injured himself that he had to be shot. Tbe programme was concluded by the Selling Hurdle Race and Flat Race, the former being won by Student and the hitter by Ghost, who was followed home by Plausible and Hi bernian* VAIDKN tirRDLKO.
