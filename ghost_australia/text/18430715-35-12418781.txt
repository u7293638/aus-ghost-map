MUTTON HAMS.-Among other bene- fits _ arising ii0111 the present method of boiling; donn sheep for the tallon, will Lea large supply of mutton hains, the legs of sheep containing so small a propoition of fat that it is not woi th while to boil tliem. As every one is interested in the success of the expel 1 nient now being made, we would recommend gi oceu and provision dealers to provide them- selves with a supply for sale ; and as there is nothing like- icciprocity, those who have the names ot scltleis on their bonks, should ad- vertise their willingness to take mutton hams in payment.

'Ihe school is iiicteasiug in luiinbeis, but the accommoda tion is wretched; towaids building a "now school there is a reserved fund ol'¿158, and a memorial to the Governor has been prepared, soliciting a grant of land for the erection of a schoolhouse ; and should his Excellency com- ply with the request, the school will be commencedforllm¡th, ondaspecial collection made on account of it,one gentleman, to »horn the Church in that parish is much indebted, having promised to give timber to the value of £!>ü so soon as it is required. Mr. Walsh pointed out the necessity of the most strenuous mid continued exertions being made, as there is a piobability that at a not veiy distant day the support of the Church will be entirely tin own upon its members : he also remarked, that notwithstanding the commercial de- pression that has existed, moro money was collected for Chuicli pulposos in the jeal ending June last, than in any previous year. Soveial gentlemen spoke in reference to local matters, and uftcr the usual routine business had been gone through, the meeting was closed, as it oponed, with player. The new . Church, ¡tis expected, will be ready for con- secration about the month of Juno next. _ JAMBEROO ANO KIAMA ROAD.-A proclama- tion in yesterday's Government Gazelle de- clares, that " whereas Trustees have been ap- pointed for a road, known as the Jamberoo and Kiama Parish Road, in conformity with the provisions of the Act 4 Victoria; and the trustees so appointed have in accordance with the twenty-first section of such Act certified that the said Parish Road is ' in a state to permit and allow the safe and uninterrupted passage of the public, with their carriages and other vehicles, and horses and other cattle and stock,' and that the length of the said road, commencing at Hyam's Fence, and terminat- ing at the township of Kiama, does not exceed six miles; and it has further been made to ap- pear to the satisfaction of the Governor and Executive Council, that a sum of not less than fifty pounds sterling for each and every mile of the whole length of such road has been ex pended thereon;- Now, therefore, I, Sir George Gipps, the Governor aforesaid, in pursuance of the authority vested in me by the said recited Law or Ordinance, do by this my Proclamation, appoint and direct tolls to be demanded, levied, and taken, upon the aforesaid Jamberoo and Kiama Parish Road, and at the rates specified in the Sche- dule hereunto annexed; and further, that the Tolls so to be collected or levied upon such Parish Road, shall be paid to the Trustees thereof, to be by them laid out, em- ployed, and expended for the purposes stated in the aforesaid Law or, Ordi nance, passed in the fourth year of Her Majesty's Reign, of which, all parties con- cerned are hereby required to take due notice. -Schedule of tolls to be demanded, levied,and taken upon the Jamberoo and Kiama Parish Road : For every sheep, lamb, pig, or goat, 3/4 d, ; for every ox, or head of neat cattle, 1d. ; for every horse, mare, gelding, ass, or mule, 2d. ; for every cart, dray, or other such vehicle, with two wheels, drawn by one horse or other animal, 3d.; ditto, if drawn by two horses or other animals, 4d. ; ditto, if drawn by three horses or other animals, 5d. : ditto, if drawn by four horses or other animals, 6d. ; for every horse or other animal above four, drawing a cart, dray, or other such vehicle, with two wheels, 1d.; for every wain, waggon, or other such carriage, with four wheels, drawn by two horses or other animals, 8d.; ditto, if drawn by three horses or other animals, 9d. ; ditto, if drawn by four horses, or other ani- mals, 10d., and for every horse, or other ani- mal, above four, drawing a waggon, or other such carriage, with four wheels, 2d. ; for every gig, chaise, or other such carriage with two wheels, and drawn by one horse or other such animal, 6d. ; ditto, it drawn by two horses, or other animals, 9d. ; for every coach, chariot, or other such carriage with four wheels, and drawn by one horse, or other animal, 9d.; ditto, if drawn by two horses, or other ani- mals, 1s. ; ditto, if drawn by three horses, or other animals, 1s. 3d. ; ditto, if drawn by four or more horses, or other animals, 1s, 6d."
