THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the tiling you do, dear, It's the 'thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting of tihe sun; The tender word forgotten, The lefcier you did not write, The flowers you might have sent, dear, Are your 'haunting ghosts to-mig-ht. The stone you might have lifted Out of your brother's way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time or thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These Jifctle acts of kindness. So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels, WMoh even mortals find â€” They come ii night and silence, Each mild, reproachful wraith, Where hope is faint and nagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And eorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the th^ng you do, dear, It's 'the thing you leave undone. Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun.
