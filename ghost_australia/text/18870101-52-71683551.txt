Tho pas senger faro bßtweon Launceston and Molbourne is '£1 17s, and tho manager wants to know whethor itho. association can expoot anything loss than that. .Added to thia, there, is, of course, the fare by train be tween Hobart and Launceston-a distance of 135 miles. 'The match between the north and south has boen fixed for j Boxing Day, in Hobart. Mr. 0. W. Hock, who was selected '. to play against the Australian Eloven in England,' will ploy with tho north. This will greatly strengthen the northern toam, and aa tho southern eleven this year is rather poor compared with those of previous yenra, tho north stands a good chanco of pulling off the match, Thé south has boan so often victorious, that very few people .will grudge tho viotory to tho north, oven if tho north .win.
