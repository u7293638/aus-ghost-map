Horrid Ghosts. OUR own revered Jerry at a Tasmanian banquet "deprecated the hard things that were said about public men." Gentle Jerry, public men should not do hard things; they should not commit Black Wednesdays for instance. Then, gentle Jerry, hard things would not be said about them. Gentle Jerry, you would fain wipe out the past now you are sober, but the past has got a habit of not allowing itself to be wiped out. It stands there as a monument to shame its creator.
