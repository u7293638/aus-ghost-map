VIccronAl RAnoEas.-The movement to establish a compaoy of Vi'oorian Rangers in this town is not proceeding as rapidly as could be desired. At the same time there are quite a number who aver they are willing to join, and these would much facilitate matters by signing their names on the papers in the possession of either Mesasrs, J. A. Row, R. S. Mathe son, or Sergeant- Major Egan. If there is the inclination to join the movement that appears to prevail, the sooner it is put into definite shape in the manner above stated the better, and we trust that during the next week the list will be added to very considerably. In a recent issue we referred to the existence of a de. sire on the part of residents of Bridge. water to have a detachment of Mounted Rifles established in their midst, We were slightly in error, it would appear, for a resident informs us that it is the Rangers that the Bridgewater boys wish to join. It will be re membered that Lieut.-Colonel Otter stated that a detachment at Bridgewater was not feasible by reason of the difficulty of obtaining an instructor. We are now informed, however that the difficulty can be got over, and if such ,s the case the success of the Portland company of Rangers is assured, for Bridgewater could supply a contingent of at least s0 men of as fine physique and as smart as any to be found in the colony, Bcrren FAcronr.-Elsewhere a corres pondent suggests the advisability of calling another meeting for the purpose of taking steps to establish a butter factory in Pocrtland, with creameries at different places in the locality. Our correspond. ent appears to be proceeding on the assumption that the Bridgewater pro. posals will lack fruition, but we believe the committee appointed are workig up the matter and that the prospectus will shortly be issued. At the same time no harm can come from ventilating the matter, and our Bridgewater friends may still prefer that this town should be the centre of operations. Hamilton is show. ing the spirit necessary to bring such a movement to a successful issue in con nection with the decision to establish a factory in that town, DIsTarcT WonRss,-The drainage works at Condsh Swamp are to be pushed on more vigorously in order to find work for the unemployed. Foa Paovross..--In our last issue the shipping intelligence chronicled the ar. rival of a schooner. We have since learned that the visitor is the Lsabel, and that she put into this port for provisions, The schooner is bound from Ulverstone to Adelaide with palings. The Isabel is still at anchor in the bay. BoAnD or ADVICE.-Mr, John McClin. took has ben appointed a member of the Board of Advice for the West Riding of the Shire of Portland. EL.cloas' RionTs.-To.day is the last day for being enrolled on the supplemen. tary lists for both Houses, All those who have not obtained rights should not fail to do sb, as a general election appears to be looming in the not far distant future, Lausss ArrPnovx.-Hugh Cameron. 319a 3r 30p, parish of Heywood; William Smith, 214a 3r lip, parish of Glenelg. A Bio Fuze.-A very extensive fire broke out in the premises of Messrs. James Serviceand Oompany, of William and Collins streets, early on Tuesday meoring. Nobody knows how it origin. ated, Damage to the stock amounting to Â£50,000 was caused. This amount is covered by insurance. Two firemen had a most exciting and perilous experience. They were at work on one of the walls, and the ladder by which they ascended was removed to enable men to mount the building at another point, Im. mediately after the ladder had been removed the flames shot out towards theose men and they stood in great danger. They did not lose their nerve, however, but the utmost anxiety was felt for them by the crowd of spectators, and a cry ,"They'llb killed" wa sent up. The fears for them were intensfied almost imniediately, as clouds of smoke and steam surrounded them and hid them from view as the 'en stationed below directed water on the fiames. The ladder was qniakly replaoed at the spot where it originally was fixed, and the men de. scended in safety, and amid the cheere of the crowd.--Herald.

Mr. John McIntyre, on behalf of the petitioners regarding the recent appeal for the remission of the portion of sent- ol ence relating to whipping passed on h Timothy Ryan in connection with the a Ardno scandal, has received the follow. ing reply:--"Crown Law Office, Mel. bourne, 27th May, 1892.

A protest has been entered by the Caster. ton team against a man named Kane playing for Coleraine, Casstertcon claims the match. The protest will be decided this week. PORTLAD Comamon.--We mentioned in a previous issue that the Lands Depart ment had granted the application for an extension of the Portland Common. We would temind those interested, however, that no managers have been appointed, and the Department is enquiring what steps have been taken in this direction. The sooner a public meeting is called, and managers appointed, the better. SoCIAL EVENING.-- ,e are informed t that the members of the Rer.

It is not stated what the maximum points obtainable were. A General order from head quarters stated 100-50 each practical and theo retical, but it is now understood that between 80 and 1100 were the maximum points for the theoretical.

A SOIANGE CASE.-The SVarrnambool a correspondent to the Herald wired on Monday:-At the coroner's court this t morning an inquiry was held concerning t the death of a girl, named Elizabeth Brittain. From the evidence it seemed t that the girl had been examined by two doctors in October last, and both said t that she was suffering from cancer. Last t February the father of the girl called in a man styling himself "Professor" George Burgess, mognetist and herbalist. Burgesl said he had a gift from the Almighty, and could cure the girl, He treated her for some weeks, and alleged that he obtained worms and in. sects from her shoulder. The parents became dissatisfied with Burgess's treat. ment, paid him, and dismissed him. The girl died two months afterwards. The medical evidence given at the inquest showed that death might have been I accelerated by the treatment resorted to by Burgess. The coroner summed up in his favor, but the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter, and Burgess has been arrested. TIaRrBL. STBRE1 ACCIDr.NT.-A terri. rible incident occurred in Melbourne on Saturday evening, whereby one man was killed and another very severely shaken, through the breaking of an electrio light. ing cable, and their ignorance of the danger they ran in meddling with it after. wards. The cable snapped during the thunderstorm whicli visited the city at about 8 o'clock, and at the same time, a blinding flash of lightning illumined the heavens, leading to the supposition that the lightning struck the wire with suffi. cient power to fuse or break it. The dangling ends emitting sparks soon gathered together a number of the curious and some of the more venturesome pro. ceeded to handle the wires, but were cautioned as to their danger. Two men r who arrived on the scene, namely Gharles henry Andrews and Hubert Wells, de termined to coil one end of the wire up and put it out of the way, but the former I managed to catch hold of the end which ' was bare of insulation, and received the full force of the current-2000 volts. Seeing his terrible position, Wells ran to t his aid, and had no sooner caught hold of a his wrist than he also received the force of the current, which immediately had fatal effect. A bystander, with great promptitude, severed the wire with an axe, and released Andrews, who was in great agony, but alter treatment in the hospital.Andrews recovered suflioteulty to proceed to his home. a TAsat.?.is sples by the Aroadia sold in London at from 9s to 4I per case.

RECOVER IN A VOLUNTEER'S KIT..-. somewhat novel case came before Traral- gon Police Court, when Colonel Price, as commanding officer of the Victorian Mounted Rifles, proceeded against George Hower, of Glengarry, formerly a member of the force, for non-compliance within order to return his kit, as laid down in the regulations of the service. It appearad that the defendant was discharged from the C Company M.R.V. in March, 1889, and since that time the colonel and other officers had repeatedly applied for the return of the kit, but every demand had been ignored, and registered letters had been returned. The defend- ant at times promised to com- ply, and did return some of the artlcles belonging to his equipment, but others be stolidly refused to give up. The prosecution now sought to have a fine inflicted, that the case might act as a deterrent to others, as the offence was said to be somewhat prevalent. There was practically no defence, and the ac- cased admitted that be had not returned the articles under the impression that he had become entitled to them by long ser- vice. The Bench were of opinion that it was necessary to make an example, as the defendant had had ample opportunity to comply with the order of the officers, whom he had simply to set at defiance. They accordingly imposed a fine of Â£1 and Â£2 2e costs in the hope that it would hase a salutary effect and be a lesson to any other delinquents. flow THE MIoNEY Goxs.-A return with reference to expenditure in the Railway department, applied for by Mr. Gordon, was presented to the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. It showed that a sum of Â£146,561 has been expended on the new railway offices in Spencer street, and that further sums, amounting to about Â£10,000, have to be paid to the contractors. The cost of furnishing the offices to date has been Â£4,410, the work having been done mostly by tender. The expenditure on the Maryborough station, including furnishings, has been about Â£24,800, and further sums amounting to about Â£1,400 have yet to be paid,
