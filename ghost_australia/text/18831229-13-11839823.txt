LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Nov. 19. I always wondered why great advertisers of ho spend their thousands a year upon our new papers, and even our dead walls, do not go to the comparatively small expense of getting their announcements written in good English My only explanation of their mar- vellous compositions is that the proprietors write their themselves We may not be literary gents," I think is their collection, "but we at all events write something which shall obtain the honours, and much more than the usual honours, of print, and if people don't read it, the) must be blind " Well, there is something in that an honourable am bition deserves to be gratified Dear charitable Leigh Hunt used to affirm that there was great excuse for the people who write their names on objects of public exhibition statues and the like, it was a humble effort after immortality. Lotus betender, therefore, with the great advertisers , only I think they should stop somewhere and when they attempt Latin and Greek they should surely call in professional assistance, In mining cases, however, it is clear they don't, mind classical advertisements are now so common Di ch m Charles Mathew's day they had begun, one remembers " Oh, what a town I what a planned metropolis I tradesmen common 1 polish scorn to write or speak Bond streets a Forum, Cornhill s an Acropolis heavy thunder s in Latin, but what is in Greek ' And only yesterday I saw cheap funerals advertised with "ad captandum vulgus" the top of the announcement I wonder whether the adv cruiser thought he was put mg the public a compliment What the public thought, I know I asked one of them whether he would be so good as to tell me what "ad captandum" meant, and he said it was a funeral " matter" addressed to Roman Catholics only-an impression which I am sure it was not the intention of the adver tiser who was only Catholic in the sense of unity ersatz produce I am afraid Mr Matthew Arnold is a little like this excellent undertaker in addressing people over their heads Of course his intentions are the best possible, but his meaning is not quite clear to everybody , he, too, advertises as it were in Latin His latest notion, which a keen sense of of humour, I suppose, induces him to proclaim in the United States of all places), is that the majority are always in the wrong If this be so, the whole system of trial by jury must be rotten, the government at home should be republican, and that of America monarchical, and the verses of Mr Matthew Arnold himself be pronounced in tenor to those of tin poet Close For my part with the exception of "'the Hydrostatic Paradox' ("which nobody can deny ) I do not believe in any paradox whatever Of all the pitiable creatures upon this earth, or its waters, I suppose a stowaway is the most miserable In the first place he goes to sea, which of itself is misfortune enough for most people, secondly, he is compelled to do so, either from fear of unearned ill-treatment, or from the vengeance of the law, thirdly, he must needs voyage in the worst part of the vessel, in the hold among the hits, or near the engines, where he is half stilled , lastly, if he has any imagination, how depressing must be the reflection that his presence in the same ship with so many fellow creatures is unknown , if he is seen, he is taken for a ghost at best, or, what is more likely, is recognised for what he is, and treated like a dog and worked like a horse for the remainder of the voyage . A very sad case has just occurred to an unfortunate of this kind, seeking to escape (a natural impulse enough) from Hamburg A young man hid himself among the bales of merchandise of a ship he supposed to be bound for England, taking with him a piece of meat that would have supplied line for such a voyage 'The ship, however was sailing for the west coast of Africa, on arrival at its destination, and its cargo being unloaded, his body was found "completely blocked in bales He had been evidently starved to death What agonies must have been his through the long watches of the night, and worse, in the day time, when the sailors worked and snug above inn, and he had no means of making his presence known to them " A stranger both to crew and passengers, he is described , yet someone had known and lived him, doubtless, and his age, about 10 Poor stowaway ' A provincial mayor is not quite the sort of person whom one would expect to follow Mr. Carlyle s advice to discard all formulas , ' nevertheless, a candidate for that office lately announced his intention, if elected, to dis- continue the use of the mace ("take away that bauble ), and to hang up the municipal gown He denounced them as relics of the dark ages As nothing would induce me to take office anywhere under any possible circumstances, I don't feel called upon to debate the question, but a mace I have When I was a boy, and tortured by nightly terrors of ghosts and goblins, I went to stay in the house of a relative, who happened to be mayor of the town in which he lived On looking under my bed to make certain as usual that there was not a coffin there, I found one. It was in reality the case in which the municipal insignia were kept, but its shape and size, and the brass plate on which my relatives name was engraved, gave it a most funereal appearance, and almost made it corpse of me It is one of those little experiences which, unimportant in themselves, one never forgets Just in time to save Mr. Homersham Cox, the I signal County Court judge, from being burnt in < Ihgy in Wales, for denouncing the general practice of perjury in the "rineipuhtv, comes the utterance of Mr Horatio Lloyd to the same effect, he is also a County Court judge in M all is, but a W club on "'There has been a good deal of talk about w he felt r or no there is a jury in this country,' he says, but if those persons could see what I see, they would have no doubt about it A p are asked to make examples of the offenders, but if 1 committed one half of those who come before me, the gaols would have to been largely ' This is plain speaking with a vengeance If this gentleman was a Scotchman, he would never have let on about a national vice , if he had been an Irishman he would have been shot for doing it As matters stand, unless he suffers from the local weakness himself, I am afraid we must believe him At the Manchester assizes juryman requests 1 to be allowed " to affirm, ' since it was of " no religion " Mr Justice Den- man bade him leave the box since there was " no provision for such jurymen ' line from a letter in The Times last week, which this as how those who are on the panel at the Old Bailey mc treated-shut in a box too small for Hiern, exposed to draughts", and denied sufficient refreshment-it seems there is " no provision made' for jurymen even when they have any religion In October next, oh joy I the Claimant will be liberated on ticket of leave c I his friends have promised to then rally round him and set him up in a public-house This is as it should be, for a sporting car is just the place for him My conviction is that in this position he will attract enormous!), and make almost as much money as if he had contrived to get the estates to which he once aspired. His Inn is to be called the Tichborne Arms. If nine tenths of the BO called Nationalists in the House of Commons could be similarly accommodated it would suit them down to the ground, and be a most appropriate termina- tion to their career It is very seldom that one has to complain of the literature of journalists, upon the whole they are goodnatured, and when h) a paucity of views which they hate as nature abhors a vacuum they are driven to compose works of imagination, the) in general do their spiriting very gently Some individual, however, " connected with the press," Ima recently act going a statement that the late Mr. Dutton Cook, whose widow is appealing to Government for an allowance from the "Cry of list" was "in the enjoyment of Â£2,000 a year from his profession, and never made any provision for his family)," with some well worn tag about the known extravagance of literary men This "par," for which I suppose the writer got perhaps 2s 6d , is false in every particular, and calculated to do a deserving lady a great deal of harm Mr. Dutton Cook made only a very moderate income by his pen, and lived in a very homely and modest fashion the finest example of the misdirected zeal of partisans that has been exhibited for many a day was on view last week in the columns of two of our evening con- temporaries " No 1, a conservative organ, quotes the stars in their course s," c , as having been a phrase originally used by the late Lord Beaconsfield and as belonging to his extensive repertoire of remarkable say- ings But No 2, a political adversary), while admitting the poetry of the observation, urged that tribute should be given where tribute was due, and pointed out that the statement in question fell from the lips of Mr. Gladstone I And co this is a Christian country ! Political writers, however, know at least as much about the Bible as the public at large know about literature in general A novel is now passing through the columns of a well known serial in which the recording angel is alluded to in the act of dropping that one would have thought pretty well known fear of his, and the editor tells me he has received numerous letters objecting to the introduction of the li A m fiction, as being a blasphemous novelty To a very large class of persons, I suppose, not only is seems unknown, but the term "profane" is applied to literature in a very lavish and unexpected manner, but this really beats everything Why) is it that the illustrated papers are always the worst sinners in the way of snobbish ' It was in the (h sprite, I think, that "Icebergs as seen by Prince Leopold, ' were reproduced for the benefit of the Vulgar ] }e, and now its pictorial rival is favouring us with details of Prince Albert Victor's life at Cambridge, which are not, in ordinary cases, thought to have much public interest Conceive the portrait of an undergraduate After rubbing, being made the subject of a full page illustration Moreover, it is not every one who knows what "rubbing ' moans, and many ladies are under an un pression, derived from this interesting print, that young gentlemen at Cambridge bathe with their clothes on An ungenial German with the euphonious name of Mummcnholl has been fined 10s for knocking a boy over the head for whistling, a practice it seems which annoys him. he magistrate very properly said that even though a boy may not do it in tune whistling is a sign of lightheartedness, and should therefore be welcome to all but morose persons But it is evident that he forgot the story of Gabriel Grubb and the goblins, or he would certainly have made it a text for his action in M '1 his Mummenholl of fiction was It gr ivedigger, and got very justly punished for calling a boy sing- ing upon Christmas Eve 'The tale occurs in Put merit is told at Dingley Dell by Mr Wardle-and contains the germ of all those genial and generous thoughts that afterwards found expression in Dickens's Christmas books There are many tales in the same book, which having in it was nothing to do with the mine stor), have dropped out of recollection , it seemed, pro bull), at the time, a convenient channel through which to introduce them to a public which had up to that time been indifferent to the author s productions, and it is my conviction that they were amongst his very eurhcBt compositions No one, I hope, grudges Sir Moses Montefiore the harvest that the good deeds of his long and well spent life have reaped and it is quite fit and proper that they should meet with public recognition Nevertheless there is something to my mind rather distressing in the noise and stir that have been made around the peaceful retreat of the "ood centenarian There is something william incongruous in that blare of trumpets in the ear of excessive old age to receive "deputations in one's own bed room, from which ers and weakness forbid one to move must be after all you) business And, he was sure to happen, the cause of all this well merited congratulation has "given opportunities of best display to others who me by no means so meritorious Imagine the intrigues and warships that have taken place in forming committees and giving prominence to this and that absurd individual Morcourt, the most laughable things have happened, and to the last degree inappropriate to the occasion Some railway directors, for example, have presented Sir closes with a life pass worked in gold in testimony of their admiration for him. The idea of giving a railway ticket to a gentleman in his hundredth year, and who has not left his own roof or a quarter of a century or so, would surely never have occurred to anyone with one grain of humour' If it was the object of the donors to present a gift which, while apparently a handsome one, is in fact the very cheapest that could be imagined, they have succeeded What amazing things people will buy in the way of " relics " The effects of the late executioner, Mr Marwood, have recently been sold by public auction, and, as might have been expected, some of them excited great interest If I cared for such things at all (which I do not I should consider that the rope actually used in his trade went cheap at 5 10s But why should "repair of his old stockings have fetched five shillings, and "an old necktie and calls" eleven' His dog Nero, I read, was "run up" to thirty shillings which seems a very appropriate expression indeed.
