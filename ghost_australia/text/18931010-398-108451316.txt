HEADING IN BED, The Globe begins an article with the words " Of course we are all agreed that reading in bed is pernicious" My dear old Globe (comments Dr. Gordon Stables), we are nothing of the sort.

This keeps the mind on an even keel till the waves of sleep begin to waft the soul to dreamland. Let him, just before this, put out the candle and a good night's rest will be his guerdor. To think in bed is self-murder; to read in bed is life. In this advice lie sense and science combined.
