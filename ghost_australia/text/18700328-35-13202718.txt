To the Editor of the Herald. Sir,—There are few persons to be met with who are intel- ligent enough to state anything like a reasonable cause for the singular phenomena which we sometimes read and hear about—such as showers of fish, shells, and frogs, do. Last night, at 12 o'clock, in passing down the hill to Rushcutter Bay on my return from Sydney, I beheld, in quantity, large pieces of phosphorescent fungi, bespattering the valley to the right, the road, and even the roofs of many of the houses. These fungi shine as bright as the lightning that flashed at intervals, and, judging from the manner to which they were broken, they had evidently fallen from a great height. If any of the readers of your widely- spread journal can inform me the cause of this strange phenomenon, they would confer a favour upon Yours. &c.;, AGARICUS. March 25.
