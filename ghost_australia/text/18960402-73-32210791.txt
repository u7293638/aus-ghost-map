Original Poetry. A SEA MEMORY. [BY L. H. BRINDLEY.] Beyond that ridge of sandy hills, In one long line of foam, the sea Breaks with a sudden roar that thrills Thoughts of a time long lost to me. Days when my fancy, like the wing Of seabird, chased the flying spray; When life, I though', and everything Had not a harder task than play. I know not how I changed, or when, But as I dreaming stand today, I feel niy world of serious men Could find no harder task than play. It flies this phantom of my brain, Not boyhood, but its cheating ghost, 4 That leaves me nothing but a pain, B.A keener sense of what is lost. Still o'er the sandy ridge I hear The deep low murmur of the sea But in my time-dulled heavy car The meaning's but a memory.
