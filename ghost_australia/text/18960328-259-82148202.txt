It stands therefore escdly ha'Mvay betwern tl.e abodes of poverty ami wealth Afc tlir time of the occurrcnce herein to bo rvl&frrf;, it was kept as a lodging am? bourd iti^-place f<T men by Mrs. Junes Prowitt, whose long rlpen inco bn^ made bur keen and wary. H« guebt* were of all cbtGiaea itnd do ceriptions, men rising from the lower street frequently meeting at Ucr tabic t1»ose who were deaocnditig from the gentility of the Avenne. One Octobtr morning a young man applied to her for a rocra. She set ber fHtle grey eyes sharply upon him, as w&a; her habit, but saw nothing out of the commonplace. She always divided ber patrona iito three clasiy-e-those coming up from negr thrRty.thosesinking from the Avenue, anjl the stationary middle- class. She nbrewdly plAred this one among the sreond class,'but that made little difference to brr. He was medium in size, with a frank face and a manner which gave b< r the imprcston that he knew what be was nbont, ai d waft exceedingly wide-awake In doing it He said he was a* travelling mnn could furnish good references and gave hit n*mn hh Harry Mulford. .' My third-fleur front ia vacant," Mrs. Prowitt said, " but I usually get fifteen dollars a month for it." " This ia entirely satisfactory," Mulford replied. 44 The price is nothing to ma, although I sbiill not occupy the 700m more than ooe night a month But* 1 shaft waut It kept teidy for nra, tbongh you are at liberty to use It any night, ptovidnd /ou do not receive word of my coming liefore sir o'clock. I shall pay you in advance, sending you your money by mail m the last of *«ih month," He drew 1 Dut his /mrse, counted 15 dollars npon his knee, and tdded, " Hern is the first month'a rent, provided yoa r/IIl I«t ints have the room." Mro. Prowitt was too keen <0 let such a cUanco and ahn quickly olosed (he trans cation. Her requirement of references had alwjya be<m a men form-often a rose to get rd sf an unprcuirtng applicant. 6he did not, therefore, aak M'?ff*rd far his, cousideriog his money saffitfent fcvdnjiccment. .* It ii «pf^otf^Ue1(,, said Mulford, as he de livered the in-jrcy and rose to leave, " that t1 ahall not reappear for «<overal months, and if you , do not receive fifteen d )llar« from me near the first of arf -ttcrctb, you «ill be at liberty to let! the room. It fa likely that I may «ond some 1 one occasionally to occupy (bo room, but he will always bring a note frora me." This piece of lirek *>%» fc"o good for Mrs. Prowitt to keep to herself, aid it was sooa a matter for general diacipsior, arouad her tables* A mau who could affrrt t>« pay for a room with* oat occupying it WAS a rarity at No. 4313, and Mulford bocama a mystery. The flrat month pawod, and the third-floor front was unoccu* pied, execpt when Mr*. Prowitt quaiterod a transient. On the last d«y of this month a reg* istered letter was delivered to her, from which she drew three crisp five dollar bills and a note from Mulford, slating that he would soon send a friend to take porsi ssion of the room. But when this and 1* era! mot* moutba passed without other sign or representative of tyullord than the regular letters inclosing the oills, the rental of the upper chamber boraxe a sensation. At last, however, ono <!&riy; December after* 9000 a littlo old man «ppt»ir*d, *ripgi.sg froin MaJford a note which «taced aia wish that Mrs. Prowitt would place in bit tooia. fcfce article that the bearer would deliver, and 50 halve the apart ment kept ready for occupaacy. The little oK man was quit* odd. He was much 06nt a?d very grey. His teft *ye was blind ; but the right, rratle«v and winkling, together with his .whole countenance,maie Mrs. Prowitt think he could ten a great deal, 'S minded. He was not «o minded; hr.wiver# and her questions elicited, miy amnse£.cnc; to which his blinditia lent th» appearanec of cintiruaS wtrfaing. The atlicl$ he brc&^hc war a large, three . fold Japanese acrcrn, highly decorated wi*.h gilt birds, reptiles, and animals disporting (hnsi* st-lves on a table ground. After the little c(n mau bad gone, and Mrs. Prowitt had set the screen in Mulford's room, she went down to the tables to expresn her opinion that a Japanese Qoreoti was a ^urer article for a yt-ung man ito *end, and tha 4»ArAcrs agreed with her co Ctrongly as to repair to the apartment to icepftf it.

Mrs. Prcwitt made these observa tions distinctly, as was her habit, but later oo< curreocefl inde nted them in her mind. In re. lating exactly how Aie old lawyer entered the parlour, how he talked, and in deaciibing him, ?he always bad difficulty putting one fact into word*. 1 " Somehow," she always said, " he made me croep. He eat right in front ot mo and he seemed to be thirc like any other mau, but there was something or other about him that made him acem unreal,a kind of strange shadow of arjchold man 1 had S'.enupontheAvrnuc.Hts voice,too, sounded kind and unnatural »some thing like an rcho of a real voice apcaktng away oD aotfiewbere. 1 thought at Orat that he was only absent-minded, but the more 1 loaked at him the more plajuly I paw that there was some* thing about him 1 could not explain, and can't B9W. He gave brr a note In Mulfml's band, mere ly introducing him as the fiit-nd who desired to occupy his room for the night, and he would couflider it a favour if Mrs. Prowitt would make him comfortable and kt him have all he might wish. " Is there anything you want me particular* ly to do ?" Mrs. Tronitt aeked him. She has always laid great eti cfs u|ion the fact that she observed everything that occarred that night accurately, and has bren unvarying in lya'nar rathre. " Is there a table in the room f" the lawyer asked, absently. . " y«; Mr. Mulford requested me to pat one ia for him." 41 That is well. Then all I wish is to be «n tircl7 andistarbed.

Mrs, Prowitt has Icen unwav ering in this statement, as well as in doolaring that DO one was hidden behind the scrstii or elfwwhere in the room when she admitted the lawyer. It was only a few minutes after nine when she left (he old man intetiliy on paged over his papers. On hor way downstairs she Btopped ID Mr. Baylor's rooa to tell him that Mulforda Iriend bad come Sbo did so, sbe bas said, not because tboy had all looked fur him so JflDff, hut because tbe tn&n; bod gii'en her a qu?ejr feeling of dread that eho could not throw off* bbe naturally wondered what could have I brought so rich l lawyer to her house ; but it I was not this query that made her oneasy. ' She told Baylor of this strange impression, and ot tbe fact that, while witb the old lawyer in (he room, sbe had a creepy notion that sbe was en tirely alone, although he had been plain to her eyes, She noticed that he walked vigorously, but his steps had been surprisingly faint, and the p«pers bad not rattled when he took them from the bug. Sbo was very nervous. She did not believe in ghosts, sbe declared, but certainly this was the strangest lodger sbe bad ever had In her bouse. Sbe was afraid some thing dreadful might happen, and sbe askej) Baylor to keep bis door open and to walk up the stairway occasionally and listen. He promised to do so, and sh« left bib. At 11 o'clock she hurried back and said j .. Would you mind going with me to Mr, Mulford's room and listen outside the door? I 'ant to know whether that old man is eJrep ing. 1 dee from tbe pavement outside that ho Las turned the gas out.* " That cannot be," Baylor answered, excited* ly. " I wafkad up the stairs not more that five minutes ago And aaw bis light shining through the trausoun'* " Saw his light P* echoed Mrs. Frowitt, in an awed whisper. 4,It was just about five minutes ago that I looked from tbe pavement outside and bis windows were dark. Are you aura you aaw the light f " Yes | but I could not hear a sound Inside the room." ** Mr. Baylor, there is something terrible in the air kwilgbt, and I out* tell what it is. Let us go up there and tfsten." They Ascended to ISnlforifi room. Bright light wis «hining through the transom. Mrs. Vru-vit* knocked three time*, but received no answec. Then she eaUed,bat tbe room remain* ! ed perfectly eil«aifc. E wound like you to look over the transom, Mr. B aylror * sbe sail There is something ! *a/at^nocs here." Baylor Drought to ths door two chairs that w®* standing fin Obn haft and, stepping upen one, looked through Ob? transom. He started, and asked Mrs. -Frowitt to get upon tbe otber end look. They asw the oid lawyer still sitting at the table with bundles of IsgaJ papers bafoxd hits, de was too deeply engaged to notice that h!s long grey hair had slipped down ofot 1 Ms forehead and almost o*arhang his eyes. As J they tooked from his peaceful faoe to the dara metf a before him;. Mrs. frowitt started violent ly, caught Baylor* arm, and aald : &ook; at bis hands. He is making the motions of writing, tot dare is no pen in ids hand. He Bhe faltered from fright, »nd Baylor satd t " He is a madman, Mm. Frowitt." '* No bf. is worse than that. He is not a real man. Something awful is going to happen U> tight, I did no*, quiie trust thbt «an Uulford *rom the rtart. Why should he have rent*i tfcis room *nd sot rocopled it, 'if everything Had been right.

The room was dark and sliest,. No moan or sound ot death>struggllng same from the murdered pan under the table, " A match, Mrs. Frowitt," he said ;" for Ibe love of heaven* let as bare a light here !" '* There is a match-safe over the wash-ffiand in tbe corner," gasped the landlady. For a few moments Baylor groped In the Uscknen for k match. At last he struck one, and the gas puffed up. He shrank back againftt tbe wall by tho Aoor. The room wa* entirely deserted; Ibe lab)© war.b*ruof papers; She Screen stood ic 21* place near thi window ; and there was no body of a Aiur* Oered man upor the ilonr, nor soy blood r.r other trace ot bim. The room was precisely as it had been before tbe lawyer came. In the midbtofen animated discussion, at Mrs. FrowiU's table next morning, of (he strange nrime, one of the boarders, wbo b«d already breakfasted and gone out, rushed back with a paper, which, under display hcad-Anrj^ .told of the brutal murder of Abel Chrt3tian«ea, one of the city> noted Itfvycr*. It detailed how he had been sitting in the study at hU home on the avenue, going over some valuable papers in the matter of a vast estate in litigation. Tho murderer had entered through a window, had crept upon Mr. Cbristiansea under oovrr of a Japanese screen that stood behind his chair, and had struck him to the heart with a dagger. Tbe assassin, who had escaped with all the papers, was supposed to b6 ooe of tbe heirs to the property and one of the most dangerous Criminals of tho stums. About 10 o'clock on the same morning the . little old man wti brought the Japanese screen 1 *p|>fy<rid at No. 43X3, Buying that Mr. Molfor.l Iih.1 *1 n< him for it. " I dou'l know I Lit I ought to let yon bnv« < it," *aid Mr-*. I'mwitt. " Why not fr " osko 1 the little old man, with . quwr twinkle of his unl>lindc<l eyp. " Then* was a terrible murder on th« Avenue ]«>«t night by * mau who Ktubhcd . lawyer from behind a JapnneAe screen, And f and on« of my lodgm sriw (bo vihion of a man come from be hind Mr. Mulford's screr.naiid hill a strange old mnb wtio had conic as Mr. Mulford'a friend." 41 It is certainly remarkable," said the little old man, winking bia blind eye ; " but you cer tainly won't keep Mr, Mulford's ecieen just be cause you saw a vision." " Go up for it, then, for I won't touch it," 6&id; Mrs, Prowilt. .. I will be glad to hare Che terrible thing out of my bouse. If X wasn't afraid of ft I would not let you have it," Ween tbe little old man reapj.-eared, carrying tbo screen. *he s&M; r " If ! could see how thero coold be any con nection between this screen and the one on tbe Avenue I would kerp yuu hem and send for tbe poJiuo.'' ** X don't see what possible connection thnre could bo,*1 said tbe little old man, ducking jbis head sidewise and squinting at her quizzically. ** If I could 1 wouldn't ask you for the ccr*en. But X will ask Mr. Mulford, and if there j«, of course 111 come around and tell you. By tbe way, he says you need not keep the room for liini any longer.** And picking up the screen he briskly walked away.
