WAS IT A GHOST THEY SAW ? — • — — _ _ Mrs. H. H. JENNINGS lives at No. 211, Main btreet, Bridgeport, and Miss Minnie Parrot boards with her. The house is an old one but in good order. One night early in December (1891) the two women locked all the doors and went to the theatre, leavinc not a soul in the house. They left the gas burning, however, in the front parlour At about half-past eleven they returned, and entered the house laughing and talking But as they went into the parlour the merry humour died out of them in a second. Right in the middle of the room stood a dark man ot gigantic stature. The upper part of his face was concealed by a mask, his eves gleaming through the holes in it. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, and in one hand he carried a long old-fashioted pistol. The women fled screaming from the room, and when Mr Jennings came in five minutes later he found no one in the parlour and all the doors and windows securely locked. What was it the women saw ? ' " During a recent period of ill health " writes an American friend," I had slept badly for several successive nights. On the fourth of these nights about two o'clock I was suddenly aroused from a dose by what seemed like the calling of my name land at the foot of the bed stood the image of my mother just as she looked live years before as she was leaving home to go on a journey! on which journey she was killed in a railway disaster. I screamed and fainted. I was foolish enough to tell of it, and the local old women gossip said it was a summons and I would never get well. Yet I did and am in perfect health now. I believe that vision came of my weak nerves, for I've never seen it since, and it is more three years ago now No doubt it was the nerves. Why, there's no end to the tricks the neives will play on you when your system is out of condition. In March, 1890, ft was, that Mrs. Jane Foster of Darracott Road, Pokesdown, Hants, wrote us as follows :—" I was so dreadfully nervous Jcould not bear anyone in the room with me yet I did not wish them far away in case I should call out for help. This was in June, In? *J T 7 and in the morn- 15 fe * fc u llttle ^e better for having gone to bed. There was often a severe pain in my head and over my eyes, and I was sick most of the time. My skin was dry and yellow, and the stomach and bowels felt cold and dead. By-and-by I had to lie helpless in bed. t lhe doctor said he didn't know what mv complaint was I took nothing but liquid food, and could not retain even that on my stomach By this time I was nothing but 5 -i n 4 an i ^u 6 , , M y memory completely I?' led - My head ached so dreadfully I thought I should lose my senses, and mv friends agreed that I would never get better UP 811 w h °P e > when one day Mrs West, of Bournemouth, called and asked what I was taking. She told me she was herselfoncejustasbadly off, and was cured by Mother BeigeVs Curative Syrup. As she seemed to have so much faith in this medicine, I tried it, and in three days 1 was able to walk across the room, and by the end of the week I went downstairs. Now I am as well as ever. I can eat and digest my food and all my nervousness has left me" The malady Mrs. Foster suffered from was indigestion and dyspepsia and nervous prostration. The original cause was grief and shock at the violent death of her hus band, by accident, and the system rallied only when the Syrnp had given new vigor to the digestion and thus fed and toned the nerves. Whatever may be your opinion of the -Bridgeport ghost, it remains true that most nncanny visions and sounds mean nothing more or less than a set of nerves all upset by indigestion and dyspepsia. Ghosts come Horn the inside of the person who sees them and when Mother Seigel's Syrup does its' work the eyes and ears entertain only what is natural and wholesome. gQ^f
