Pugilistic. The great glove contest that is to come off early in April between Georgie Powell, of Brisbane, and Mulholland, of Sydney, is exciting a great deal of interest in sporting circles, more especially as it is known to be a genuine affair. Georgie is down at Southport with his trainer, bathing and doing good work. A gentleman who arrived from Southport on Monday last says that he looks the picture of health, and is very confident of winning the " century." If pluck and straightgoing can do it, his backers need have no fear. Mulholland is aLo in heavy training, and will no doubt prove a tough antagonist. He is very quick both in hitting and getting away, and from what I have seen of his boxing, is a scientist of no mean order. " Ruddygore, or the Witch's Curse," is the. some what startling title of Gilbert & Sullivan's new opera, which bids fair to achieve a success equal to ; their former productions. The curse is as follows " Each Lord of Ruddygore, Despite his best endeavor, Shall do one crime, or more, Once, every day, for ever ! This doom he can't defy, However he may try; For should he stay His hand, that day In torture he shall die " In one of the scenes the ancestors of the Lord of Ruddygore descend from their! picture-frames and sing a chorus round him, after which one of them sings what is described as the "finest thing in the opera," namely, " Song of tue Ghosts' high-noon." The name of the opera itbelf appears to be considered" the worst thing in it.
