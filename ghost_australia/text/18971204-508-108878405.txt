GHOST SHIPS. To the Dutchmen we have to look i or the original of phantom ship tales, which form about the mast familiar of eea legends. The famous phantom sMp that remains off the Cape as the harbinger of wreck and woe is a Dutchman, whose skipper dresses in yellow, weans a nightcap, smokea a short pipe, ana is aiways Kino, enougn to neave jd sight wnen a vesasl is going to founder or run ashore. There is, however, another spectre that haunts thest waters. Years and yeans ago a ehdp was home ward bound from the Indies, with a cargo of specie and spices, but in consequence of fever breaking out, at no port of cali was t*he allowed evea to enter quarantine So she cruised about until flue crew all murdered each other, and .now she is dcomed to cruise about for ever, manned by the ghosts of the defunct mariners. Then there is the story of Baron Falkenberg. One day he was invited to the wedding feast of 'a long-lost brother, who returned (home suddenly with a pocketful of coin in order to marry a gentle village maiden upon whom Fal kenberg himself had his eye. It was annoying, but still, the baron thought it better to be amiable to his brother, bo be wen$ to the fsast, then rowed off to the ship, from which he has not landed, for 600 yeais. On wild winter nights the pnantom ship is constantly eeen in the German Ocean, heading for itne north, but without helm or helmsman. She is painted grey, has colored sails, and flies a yellow flag. . Upon tier deck the passing mariner can plainly see the baron sitting alone, playing dieÂ© for his soul, while about the masthead a blue Same can be seen flickering.
