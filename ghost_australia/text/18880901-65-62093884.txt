Another Protectionist. CONVERTS to Protection are being made every day. One of the latest is Mr. ANGUS CAMERON, the Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Assem- bly. His conversion is attributed to what he saw in Victoria during a recent visit. That convinced him that the fiscal policy of New South "Wales is not calculated to promote the prosperity of the colony, and therefore lie resolved to abandon his belief in it. A year ago Mr. CAMERON was accus- tomed to speak as disparagingly as Sir HENRY PARKES himself of Protection. Some unkind people attribute CAJUEBON'S conversion to his con BcionsneBS that the PARKES Government are played out, and that if he sticks to Free-trade he will not have the ghost of a chance of being Chairman of Committees in the new Parliament. People will say these things. If CAMEBON has allowed him- self to be influenced by this consideration, he has changed to no purpose, for the Protectionist party will take good care to place one of their own sup- porters in the Chair. MB. KETHEL, one of the members for "West Sydney, is another legislator whose faith in the Free-trade sjBtem has been shaken ; but hehas notyet declared in favour of Protection. He has, however, expressed himself strongly against the PARKES Government. They have, he considers, failed in every respect, and are not likely to improve. Mr. KETHEL says he is sick of Parliament, and will retire from politics at the next dissolution. Probably a good many more of the members will follow his example. Those of them who have important business to attend to, have realised that the honour of being a represen- tative does not provide sufficient compensation for the loss oÂ£ time involved in attending to their Par- liamentary duties.
