LIMITED LIABILITY. (From the Daily Telegraph, May 29.) YESTERDAY me Master of no holds bad, in his list of causes for the day, no fewer than twenty two petitions relating to the winding up of public companies The fact is not only an alarming symptom of the present financial embarrassment, but also some criterion of the Limited Liability Acts The question forced upon us by passing events IS this-ought the policy of those Acts to bore considered, modified, or abrogated s If a single Judge is called upon in one day to entertain twenty two applications for judicially determining the existence of joint stock enterprises formed on the "limited" plan, we may be sure the long predicted hour of trial for that principle has moved lush calamities are continually attributed to it, and disasters now succeed each other so rapidly, we may almost say " that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker " Among the latest examples is the fall of the Consolidated Bank, which was formed by the amalgamation of three previously established businesses, two of them being the old London firms of Hankey and Co, and Heywood, Kennard, and Co. The stoppage of the Consolidated is attributed, partly to a chancery suit, in which the course taken by the directors IS impugned, and partly to the failure of the Bank of London. It is now a matter of common observation, that the unstable under takings lean upon one another, so that the fall of one indicates the fall of several We have, in fact, arrived at such a pass that a winding up is regarded as the most probable and natural event in the history of " limited " companies This conclusion was not intended by the Act that first esta wished the principle on which those associations are based t provided an apparatus for arranging their affairs in the event of their dissolution, but it did not contemplate insolvency and sudden death as normal incidents of their career When the Legislature, ten years ago, authorised the establishment of partnerships in which the responsibility of each partner or shareholder should be restricted to the amount of his shares, it was supposed that we had reached a new and happy era in the history of commerce Limited liability was to inaugurate a mercantile millennium It was a peace that was to cure all the epidemic diseases to which the financial world was most liable Every one who disputed or doubted the expediency of the new doctrine, or wanted to have it fenced round with precautions and limitations was an old-fashioned, prejudiced opponent of reform, a protectionist in disguise, and an intolerant defender of inveterate error We have had a decade of experience since that time, and the pears sung on the triumph of limited liability have now given place to some thing very like a wail of defeat, the legislation on the subject has not been followed by all the delightful and happy consequences which were prophesied ten years ago The complete liberation of commerce from her old letters has not introduced a reign of financial felicity The parties, crises, and failures are quite as frequent as they were under the old system There was a grand crash of abortive railway schemes in 1847 and 1848, but in the aggregate the troubles of the new limited companies are quite as great They fail so fast that the Court of Chancery, which acts as executioner, cannot kill them quickly enough to satisfy the public vengeance the " Chamber " of the Master of the Rolls and the Vice Chancellors are almost choked up with this kind of business, their courts are besieged with petitioners, who clamorously demand the dissolution of the ill fated partnerships, and distribution of their property So strong is the reaction that it has become undiscriminating, and we are by no means sure that a considerable amount of injustice will not be committed merely through contagious terror For the " limited ' companies are not all unsound, and their peculiar statutory privilege is not the sole cause of all the disasters which have overtaken the financial world Probably it will be found, on examination, that the failures are due, not to limited liability, but to the abuse of it. The principle in itself is sound enough-it implies no more than that persons may trade on the understanding of their not being individually liable as heretofore for partnership debts, each man to " his last acre and last shilling That was the old law, and the Act of 1856 simply declared that associations of more than seven partners need not be bound by it unless they liked But then they were to give the whole world notice that they did not subject them selves to the ancient rule of unlimited individual responsibility for air is The world "limited,' which is always annexed to their name, is a clear warning If, after such a warning creditors choose to give credit why should they be prohibited from doing so F With respect to them the Act was simply permissive, it did not compel them to deal with the new companies unless they pleased But, in truth, the hardships of the recent legislation have fallen, not upon the creditors, but on the unwary shareholders We speak of their In bility BE limited but oftentimes the " limit ' is so wide that it might almost as well be abrogated The more recent undertakings are regulated by the ' Companies Act 1862' in the associations formed under it, " each are mier undertakes to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of the same being wound up during the time, that he is a member, or within one year afterwards, for pay a ends of the debts and liabilities of the company contracted before the time at which he ceases to be a member, and of the costs, charges and expenses of winding up the company aid for the adjustment of the rights of the contributions amongst themselves, such amount as may be re- quired, not exceeding a specified amount ' It is true that his responsibility is restricted, but he cannot be out of it for twelve months after he has ceased to be a shareholder and within that period there is always a risk that he may be called upon to contribute towards the payment of an theorists contracted by the company For such debts the actual shareholders are primarily liable, and past members are not to be called upon unless " it appears to the Court that the existing members are unable to satisfy the contributions required to be made by them in pursuance of this Act." Con M quer t'y, if a share has press d through the hands of a | di zen holders in the course of twelve months, every one of these persons may possibly be required to make contribu the. subject always to thin Important limitation, that none " pball bt require d from any member exceeding the amount, if any, unpaid on the flinn n in respect of which he is liable as a present or past number " But, even as thou evil fired, the danger is often terrible The warning is trite but it must be r<p>a'cd again and again till the Rippon is more perfectly understood by the inexperienced j ear us who are most likely to suffer, that the art of giving a company an appearance of fictitious strength and respect Hbilily liHB been carried to consummate perfection in modern times. There are wonderful an iota who devote their nlvtp exclusively to the purpose, just as there are practitioners who can give to old age and decrepitude the appearance of juvenile vigour. The establishment of con i unless isa profession in itself. What chance has the out pidir-the widow with a small tower, or the country parson picking a profitable investment for his modest savings against the cunning, long- headed'. City " gentlemen who are ready-most ready-to receive money in exchange for shares? If the cupidity of gain did not blind inexperienced investment seekers to the most obvious warnings, they would perceive that they have not a ghost of a chance in the unequal contest with their practised opponents. The game in more legal, but not a whit more equal, than that played by skittle-sharpers against the rustics who show their money in London public- houses. No legislation con absolutely prevent goals from being duped ; still, all that is possible e right to be done for their protection and in the in cereal s of legitimate commerce it is desirable that the law of limited liability should be, not abrogated, but accompanied by additional provisions against abuse. In France, we believe, companies are subject to a strict preliminary examination by proper officers of the Government before they are established. In England any seven persons can get up a new association without such an ordeal. They have simply to register certain particulars, which may easily be so described as altogether to mislead the public with regain to the real financial position of their enterprise. Until the law in this respect is rendered more stringent until associations are compelled to produce adequate credentials before obtaining authorisation and registration the evil of " winding-up" will continue to be general and chronic.
