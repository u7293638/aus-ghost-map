The privileged public election meetings have taken place, and no one is sorry that they are over. The law demands that an interregnum of five days shall take place before the ballot commences— two days are prescribed f orthis operation, -so that -on —Monday ' evening next the curtain will f alL and the new French Parliament will be elected. It is a longtime since - France has witnessed so deadly a party struggle. It is simply. between theEevolutionarr party, backed up by the Orleanists and; Legiti mists, and the Emperor, supported by moderate thinking men. ' Order and liberty., with the Emperor, is the cry; from pne camp.' Reyoln., tionand itschances,,that from the other.' Now tp the mind of every reflectiye man, what!

No one denies- their right tojthjem, but many question their ^present fitness: to' possess: them.
