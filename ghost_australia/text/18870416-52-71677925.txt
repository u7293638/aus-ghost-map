Fatalities among Cattle. j The cry ot' poisonous pasture has hean raised again-fortunately, this timé, to reoeivé speedy I contradiotion. Fatalities arnon? a herd of. cattle having occurred in the Jamberoo district, the cause was immediately alleged to be poisonous herbage which the oattle had oonsumed. Now, &a; we have several timeB pointed out, this question of poisonous grasses, or herbage in Australia, is very like that of the existenoe of ghosts. No one of course doubts that there are such things as ghosts, yet nobody ever seos them. Of course there are poison plants itt Australia ; but, somehow or another, no authen ticated instance of horses, oattle, or sheep, having been poisoned by them oan be discovered. After the dronght broke up, it will be remembered that the papers were for a time full of deaths of stock ; caused, it was alleged, by poisonous herbage having been eaton. Eut in all oases it was fully proved subsequently that the deaths were caused in another way-most generally by the Bndden trans ference of Btook in low condition fromvory poor to very rioh pasture. That has now been discovered to be the case in the Jamberoo distriot, as far as poison ons herbage ÍB oonoerned. The official investigation ~ . puts the fatalities down to the change from poor to rich grasses. Another authority calla it " Cumber land disease ; " but the poison plant theory has. been given up. ?
