(Dedicated to the Mayor and Council of Melbourne.) With the crown of Miasma, it spreadetk Its wings like a spectre supreme. 'Tis the Demon of Dra n and of Alley, And its face is a horrible dream. The breath of its nostrils is fever, With Sickness 'tis darkly arrayed. Its presence is sappiiyr our lifesprings The Ghost that ought to be laid. The dwellers in city and suburb Are pale from its poisonous breath ; It looms over beautiful Melbourne. A terrible herald of Death. But where is our wise City Council ? Does it sleep f is it blind ? or afraid To lay with its pestilent minions The Ghost that ought to be laid ? Lo, its wing6 are the Ieaden-hued Typhus, And Cholera livid and black; Like the shadow that passed over Egypt, It floats with the dead on its track. Its story means human berearement, And sorrow that cannot be stayed; But they that have power, they lay not The Ghost that ought to be laid. How lone Trill the ci ty be burdened With this incubus 2 Councillors, say. Is Plague to be suffered to wither The youth in us day after day ? Go, shake off your apathy, masters 'Tis time that the effort was made To drive from our streets and our thresholds '1 he Ghost that ought to be laid.
