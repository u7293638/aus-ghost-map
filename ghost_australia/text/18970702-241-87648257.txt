The speaker is a man who buys, reil estate when someone hIrs to soll;, aiil sells when someone is anxious to bity. "By sheer chance, I hippened toq be on the ground when a new agency was being formed, and found employmelit: There was a reign of: terror then :be cause of burglaries and. hold-ups,l just as there now is in many cities.. qOn a certain evening one of the wedlthliest men in the country was robbed b ? foot pads. and I was put on' tli case. :": found his watch in a pawnshop, and watched patiently there till' thei thief appeared with a gold match si, if'set with diamonds. "Bent on doing the job alone, I shadowed him home, with a view to get ting the rest of the plunder, and corral the rest of the offenders, if there hap pened to be a gang. My man did not make a bluff, much less a fight. He gave up the pawn tickets, surrendered most of the money taken, and declared hlimself nmy prisoner. As I was about to slip the cuffs on his wrist, he asked lme to step for a minute into the next rooim. There was a womaln that looked about as substantial ls aL ghost. alnd Ihree little childrenl ill rags, crying for soncethilg to eat. Not a word was said, and when we were back in the main room the man extended hisihands for the wristlets. I took his right hand. gave it a lea'rry shake, and told him to provide inl some honest \way for those in the other room. "O'n the way back to tih :agency I was stopped by a revolver at Itlie end of lsy nose. alld the money I ha11 recall tured was takeni froln me.
