The crew were taken off at daylight, and the cargo is being removed. The Glaneuse is an iron vessel of 642 tons, owned by A. Dom Hordes, of Bordeaux, and has been out twenty-five days from Charente for Melbourne and Sydney. The cargo consists of wines, spirits, and general merchandise, and is valued at £30,000. Those on the Glaneuse say they signalled for a pilot, and the pilot schooner acknowledged, but did not come. In the mean time the vessel drifted. Those on the pilot schooner say, on the other hand, that they signalled, but the Glaneuse took no notice. The position of the vessel is sufficiently precarious as to cause anxiety as to her ultimate fate, but there is every probability that the whole of the cargo will be saved.
