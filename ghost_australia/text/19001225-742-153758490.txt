Cexsobed Play in London'.â€” Ibsen's play ' Ghosts,' which was to have been produced at St. George'6 Hall, London, has been vetoed by the Lord Chamberlain. The representation was to have been in Germau. under the auspices of the German Dra- ; matic Society, and considerable surprise ha6 ; been manifested at this decision of the j censor, as ' Ghosts' was some years ago ] Htouurau in England m i'.ngiisti. i-ut on that occasion it was merely a private per formance. for which no license waB needed and, when permission was applied for. Mr Piggot, who then occnpicd thc posi tion of Censor of Plays, refused. His view, which is supported by Air G. j, Redford. his successor, was that '? Ghosts 7' waB an immoral play, which had been repro bated in every country. As a matter of fact a license was not formal^ applied for by the German Dramatic Society, but Mr Redford was approached informally and asked whether he would sanction the performance. He replied in the negative. Mr Redford's decision has created con siderable dissatisfaction among some of the members of the German Dramatic Soc:etv, who point out that the actions of the State Departments are hardly consistent when one prohibits 'Ghosts ' and another permits bo much vicious French literature to be pur veyed in Soho.
