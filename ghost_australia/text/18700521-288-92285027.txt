He stated that a large number of Church funds and properties were in the hands of Trusteesj who. would , be very willing to give them over to a properly authorised body; suchas an incorporated Synod would be. lie believed Synod should- be incor porated. It had been in existence many years, and it was not likely now to fall through. Synod represented the whole body of the Chnrch, and dispensed the Church property. He believed if Synod was incorporated it would give it greater strength, and make all the funds more simple, . :. ? . :. - Dr. Fobsteb seconded the motion. Bis LOBDSHIP stated that in 1861 Mr. Fenn's opinion was taken upon the subject of incorpo ration, and, he gave an opinion favorable to such a step. Then steps were taken to obtain . an Imperialmeasure, but the Duke of Newcastle referred them to the local Legislature, aad that ; appeal was unsuccessful, as the local Parlia ment would not pass a Bill of Incorporation. , Mi-. A. J. Ebmonds thought it undesirable that such a subject should be1 proceeded with that night, seeing the large number of .new members present. - - _?-? \- . Dr. Weld asked if the other colonies had an incorporation. The Rev. Canon Fabb said. he would point, out a few of the. objection's: which liad been taken to incorporation '.The difficulty felt was, that the Synod . was defined to consist of the; Bishop, clergy, and. laity. ' If there was no Bishbp there would be no Synod, and the Synod had not the power to continue tbe Bishop. The continuance of the Bishop depended on the Crown. -- If the Synod had thepower of electing their. 'own. Bishop, this difficulty would pass away' and then the Corporation would be a per fect Corporation. As long, however, as Synod had not the power of electing a Bishop, they would havemo legal certainty of continuance. Another thing was that the action of the present Bishop would not bind hii successor?. A future Bishop might say lie would not assent to. the compac t his; predecessor had made. In view of . this difficulty he did not think Synod would' be a Corporation such as would be recognisedby - the Courts. In order to place things in a proper state, it would be a wise step for tho Synod to have the power of electing the Bishop. He saw & difficulty in the way of going \inder the pre Bent Act,* and he should be very loth to go to Parliament for a special Act. He had no doubt, however^ as to the desirability of incorpora tion. ' ? ?' -^ ? ? ? ?.'.-? ? ? - ; Mr. A. J. Edmunds took objection, under the Standing Orders, to this question -being: pro ceeded with that night. The objection was overruled, and it was resolved that the debate he continued. ' ? . - : After the adjournment the debate was re sumed. Mr. Thbupp pointed out .the exceptional position of the Synod in not having the ap pointment of their Bishop in their own hands.' He referred to the measure which it was at tempted to pass in the local Parliament, but which Parliament, would not help them over the difficulty. It was very evident, he said, that they covsld not obtain a special Act of In corporation, but there was an Act in . existence under which, any religious body might be incor porated. There was, however, the risk that any future Bishop might decline to agree to the compact entered into by bis predecessor; and the question for Synod to coosider was whether it was well to become incorporated with that risk. He thought it was well to do so, and he had little reason to doubt that any future Bishop would be appointed subject to the Synodal compact, so that there was apt much likelihood that there would be a hitch in that respect. He recommended them to incorporate Synod only, and -not the ChuTch of England. Besides this, he thought the - incorporation of Synod would get over some of the -technical difficulties in the Act. For all these and other - reasons it was desirable that if they- wanted incorporation -they should incorporate . Synod only. He thought it highly desirable to in corporate, in 'order that the Endowment and. other Funds might be handed over to the in corporated Synod.. He stated, in reply to Dr. Weld, that in'Victoria the Church had a special Act of the local Legislature ; but the Bishops in; New Zealand had felt the difficulty very keenly. His Lobdship explained, with reference to the Irish Church, which had been referred to by Mr. Thrupp, that the effect of Imperial legis lation on that subject was to. hand over the national property of the establishment to. a body organised with the assent of the Crown. Here, however, they never had any property of ' the Grown nor. any benefices, and. he. believed if the question were raised it would have been impossiblsfor any one to move for.a writ of scire facias to know whether these letters patent were not improvidently issued. He believed they ' were so issued, and they would not be issued again. The simple exercise of the Crown in the appointment of the Bishop would be to permit -the Archbishop of Canterbury to con secrate the individual selected for the office. He stated this from what he heard when in England, after being . in communication with the best authorities on this subject. ; He there fore stated his belief that there was no danger' that the Crown would interfere with . their proceedings, because the Queen's supremacy was only over the Establishment, and there was no Ktabjishment here. He admitted, how ever, that the question had never been. decided, by the Courts of Law. There was a practical, objection also, and that was that-e very member of a Corporation 'was 'liable for a misuse of funds, and by this the Bishop would be liable to- an action, although he had given up his', power of veto in monetary matters, . : ? The motion was then put, and carried unani mously. ; DUTIES OF OHUBOHWABDBNS. 1 Mr. F. Wioksteed moved — ' Th%t a Select r Committee be appointed to frame rules de fining the duties of Churchwardens, and a form of acceptance of offioe (the adoption of these to be at the option of Vestries) to report, when prepared, to Synod, or, if out of session; to the 'Standing Committee, who shall have power to ? ; adopt,' print, and circulate such report or such : forms.'

The Bishop promised to give a formal answer next day. PEW BENTS. The Rev. S. Gbeen moved— ** That a Select Committee be appointed to consider how far it is practicable to abolish payment for sittings in churches in this diocese, and to forward their report to the Standing Committee.' He argued that churches were God's houses, and it was a wrong, thing to charge ? people, to enter their Father's house. The question might be asked how should they support the. clergy? but he believed a much better system could be adopted than by taking payment for sittings. At pre sent the poor people were often repelled from God's house by the charge made for sittings, and he strongly advocated the system- of volun tary: offerings. He. believed if the Committee ? were, appointed a better .system . could be pro poped.- .His Lobdship pointed out that any clergyman could ? dispense -with sittings if he chose to do so. Dr. Weld, Messrs. S. Toms and W. Bishop opposed the abolition of payment of sittings. The Rev. Canon Dove spoke strongly against the unchristian nature of the system, which he earnestly denounced. The Rev. E. EL Milleb, the Dean, and Mr. Collet spoke. in favor of the Committee of Enquiry. The motion was carried, and the following Committee was elected by ballot: — Dean Rus sell, Eev. S. Green, Canon Farr, Messrs. . Hawkes and. Colley,- Canon Dove, Archdeacon Marryat, and Messrs; Young -and Thrupp. .:. . ST. GEOBGE'S, MAGILL. jt ThefRev. S. Gbeen asked what arrangement '^ had- been made for the celebration of the Holy Communion at St. George's, Magill, during the absence Of the Incumbent. 'His LosbsHD? ex plained that the Rev. Mr. Neville had been away on sick leave for four months. Mr. Bath had undertaken to supply services there, but . these were discontinued on Sunday last, the period for which Mr. Bath promised to act having expired. Mr. Neville had relied on re ceiving assistance from his' brother clergymen, but circumstances had arisen which prevented them giving such help as they would otherwise have done. THE ASSESSMENT FOB STNODAL EXPENSES. -The Rer. S. Gbeen asked whether the Standing Committee had found that the assess ment of Churches for Synodal expenses had the effect of separating Churches from communion with Synod.; It was stated by His Lobdshd? that ne instance was : known in which the assis tance had had this effect ? : ' INDUCTION OF CLEBGTMEN. The Rev. R, W. Webb asked whether His Lordship had been able to make any arrange ment for the induction of -clergymen into their cures. His Lobdship thought it would be very desirable to carry out Mr. Webb's idea, but the size of the diocese was so large that the ex pense incurred would be very great. MB. COLLET'S PAPES AT OLENELG.
