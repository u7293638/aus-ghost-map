The Sydney University got advised of a grand windfall when we were there. An old Sydney merchant, Mr. Challis, who had made his motjey in New' South Wales, died at home, bequeathing to that institution the munificent sum of £100,000. Invested at 5 per cent, interest this will exactly double the usefulness of the University. The Government endowment being only £5,000 per annum, the chancellor and senate have been unsuccess fully endeavouring to get it increased or dpubled, and here the thing is done at 6nce for them from an unexpected source. It is impossible to over-estimate the good their acquirement of such a sum will enable them to do.
