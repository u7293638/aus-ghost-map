The Separation Threat. TUB ghost of a past agitation for separation on the parc of a section of the residents of the Graf ton-GIen Innes district was raised by Mr. Moore, M.P., during an interview which the Premier accorded an important deputation organised by the Clarence River Railway Construction and Harbor '-^^Improvement League. Mr. Moore's incantation was to the following effect :-" It must be evident .Â«that the question to be decided is whether this proposed railway from the Clarence River to the tablelands of New England is to be carried out, or whether these distriots are to be made into a Bepar- ate colony." In replying to the deputation, Sir Henry Parkes did not forget to lay Mr. Moore's spectre. First he was unkind enough to refer to it as an absurdity, and then as " a childish outcry for separation." " Separation," he said, emphati- cally, "was impossible, for the Government of New South Wales was the only power that could consent to the disintegration of any portion of the country, and he trusted no government would ever arise sufficiently recreant to consent to the slight eat portion of the colony being divided from the other. Of coarse there was no knowing what a movement headed by Mr. Moore might do, but de- pend upon it such a movement would very soon resolve itself into its own discomfort."-Daily Tele- graph.
