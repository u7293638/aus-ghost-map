The grass has a nice green hue, and the showers of rain that have fallen will give it anotherstart. Hot drying winds set in,; and- have: been succeded by refreshing showers of rain. _ j Stock is everywhere in grand: - condition, and the herbage, especi ally about Matong and Boloco ia looking splendidly: ? ;. I AM glad to say thai Mr. Paddy McFadden, the maintenance, man. here, has been putting the Buckleys and Boloco road in good repair, Snot' lie iB now busily engaged on $he. hill near the Woolwey crossing^ which was getting into a dangeroua condition with ruts and gutters.; The strike now going on in Syd ney has not made things wear a gloomy aspect, even in this out of the way part of the country. It is almost the only topic conversation^ The silver line to the cloud has been seen, however, in the news that the shearers have returned to work ag.'iin. Summer weather has com menced, which reminds us that shearing time is fast coming on, but it is expected that shearers will be a scarce commodity this year on account of the delay in shearing operations down the river. Some of the inhabitants are com plaining that it costs them 3s for registering their dogs, being 2s 6-L for each registration and 6d each form. We are now left with only one guardian ot the police, Constable Overton h ;ving left for the Metro polis to assist the peace orders dur ing the strike. The new Land Act has been causing a little life or stir in labor circles, such work as the erection of fences being anticipated and ia hand. It is thought that as the need of a butchery is mucn felt, that one won Id pay very well. The greatest difficulty is often felt in setting supplies of either beef or mutton^ without travelling many miles for it. Lambing is still continuing and the results all encouraging. The proposal for the fencing of the church ground seems to havft gone dead, or else there is a dearth, in the exchequer. If the required sum had been subscribed no doubt tenders would have been called' for ere this. A very pertinent question is asked — If it is right to build jpig- . geries near a public road. In the first place such things are uup'lea^ sant to nasal organs, and horses are not partial to Sir Swine. Their presence ofisn cause discomfort, and sometimes accident. - /' A Peculiar Accident.— A' feer ious accident occured at Kian)a last Monday to a man camping at East (??
