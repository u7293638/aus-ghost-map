Exposing the Spooks. Mr. Maskeltne has been .telling the. public how he fiist began to dabble in' the business of exposing spiritualistic impostures. ' " It was during my apprenticeship. Adjacent to our place of business there resided a man and wnL man who professed to effect cures by mesmer ism. About tlmt time table-turning became n fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the "Cock-lane Ghost.' Well these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritualistic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop . what she called a surgical appliance to be repaired. It consisted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As yon may suppose I entirely failed to see what -kind of surgical appliance this thine could be. and was curious to discover its lenl use. Having repaired it, I devoted a few minutes to experi menting with it, and found that by bnckling the strap of the short lever ronnd. the left ankle, and that of the long lever round the leg just below-: the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projection at the side of, tho short lever the long one could be jerked up and made to strike the under side of a table. Accordingly I booked it as a table-rapping apparatus, and the bill was sent in â€” " Repairs to table-rapping apparatus, Is. 6d.! " This Mr. Maskelyne, al though he thought it smart at the time, admits was an ill-judged move, as the lady was put upon her guard, and no table-rapping was after wards essayed.
