THE BALLARAT "GHOST" SCARE. On Wednesday night the residents of Alfred- ton thought they had captured two of the "ghosts" that have latterly been seen in Ballarat and the suburbs. Captain Sanley Low, A.D.C. to the Commandant, raised the alarm, as the intruders were in the grounds of his father-in-law, Sir Henry Cuthbert, but when the police arrived it was found that the supposed phantoms were two Indian hawkers in gorgeous attire. At the City Court the dusky pedlars were each fined 7/6 for trespassing on the grounds of the Solicitor- General, but they said they had no money to pay the penalties, and they were removed to gaol. The death is reported at Collector, near Goul- burn, of Jas. Simmons, reported to 105 years old.
