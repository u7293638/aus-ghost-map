THE OLD AND NEW YEAR. To-day, on entering upon the first of the New Year, a glance backwards may not in appropriately he taken. The colony, or rather, we should say the metropolis, which represents nearly one-half of tile colony, has 1 has boon in thO Hallow of a wave, but already there arc signs that it is slowly but surely rising again, if not to tho very crest of pro sperity, then to the happy medium that lies between an inflated .boom period and ono of more'stable if loss showy opulence. How largely Melbourne is taken to represent Vic toria is exemplified in tho fact that though there has been no sufficient cause why tho country should have been depressed, the gold yield having boon fairly maintained, tho re- j turns from wool up to tho average, and tho I grain harvest likewise, It has been by mony I thought that the country is irt a very bad way | generally, because certain financial institu tutions have boded .COuitng to grief, either through Over - trading or through being managed 'by knaves. But the insolvou oies for tho colony have not boon larger than »8ual,and it is vOry’prdbablo that land outside of that metropolitan area is just ns valuable to-day as at any period during tho last throe years. This shows that tho depression which has been »o much spoken of during tho year is local, .rather than general. Melbourne cither directly or irtdireCtly Used to got tho lion's share of thd Idan njonoy dnd supplies frdm this Quarter having DCdn cut off, tho cir culation of ono or two million pounds loss in the course of tho year would have an ap preciable effect even on a city of tho wealth and size of tbo metropolis. It is unfortunate that thoro should be Stich a Congestion of population add likewise Centralisation of wealth in tho metropolis, for tho story has that the whole colony is in a rather bad way, whereas it is chiefly in cer tain- over-speculative Circles and amongst thp victims Of miaphlced confidence that any real ! dr'serloiis depression exists. When, tho coun try has boon producing up to its average returns and not consuming more than than its average requirements it is safe to conclude that the average of prosperity has been and is being enjoyed. The Melbourne papers miss tbo revenue from tho land boom and company promoting advertisements. Then everything wont fair with thorn, and the country was on tho royal road to fortune. Now that tho newspaper percentages have ceased to come in on this species of gambling, trade, it is bewailed, is not increasing, and tho world is not going well. Color, however, ; has also been given to tho doleful story, in , consequence of tho prdsont Government hav ing been loft a legacy of debt by their pre- ! dcccHsors, Thoro would havo been no debts ; Whatever if tho former Government bad net made constituency-bribing and packing tbo civil service, tho loading features of its policy, but, as it was, tho unpaid liabilities more nearly resembled those of a rich man with a trifling bank, overdraft than tbo same party with ono which nobd cause him concern. During the year there was one serious strike. It was mainly confined to Queensland, but was conducted ia such a violent manner that for a while it looked as if there were going to bo civil war in tho western wilder nesses of that groat colony. Much harm was wrought by tho shearers' strike, as coming so soon after the maritime strike of tho preced ing year it was beginning to bo feared that this state of affairs was to become chronic in tho relations between capital and labor in tho colonies. But both Strikes failed signally, and] tho loss and deprivation caused by them wore so widespread, that taken in conjunction with the slack state of the labor market, the strike fever died out, until, as at present tho occu pation of tbo professional agitator has gono, and it would bo quite as bard to invoiglo a -number of men “out" in any of tho larger ; industries, as it was not so -very long ago to ! induce them to listen to reason and ‘keep to their employment. Tho strike wave has op parently passed over, and wo nood not ex pect a return of it till the lessons of the last couplo of yoars have been forgotten, or till a youogor generation of workmen comes on tho econo who will have to gain in tboir turn to gain those experiences for which their seniors paid so dearly. Relative to Bendigo and tho immediate dis trict tho past year has boon a fairly pros perous ono, and the outlook for 1892 is brighter than it has boon at this season. for n long while past. "Whilst there has been a talk, of .depression elsewhere our citizens who bare, joined in it havo, it may bo surmised, merely done so to bo in tbo fashion. Ono of tho best crilcrtons of tho condition of a town or city is tho number of unoccupied houses. On some of the smaller goldfields,and in not a few of the older agricultural townships tho | census taken in April last showed that tho ! proportion of houses for which thoro were no [ inhabitants ranged to' as high as 1 in 7. In tho metropolis it was 1 in 15, whereas in Bendigo it was only 1 in !8. And as will have been soon from tho articles in this jour nal during tho last couple of days, building and improvement is steadily going on, a suro sign that people havo “come to stay,” and that they are tolerably sanguine that tho prc-‘ j sent mining and commercial prosperity will be continuous, F.oukth Pack.—Tho following additional reading matter will b'o found on the fourth pagoMining Nowa and Notes, City Police Court, How to.

The Mutinous Fihbmbk.-—Tho conduct of somo' of tho firemen of tho Eaglohawk Briagdo who on Wednesday evening, though the fire-ball was ringing, and tho glare of flames could bo scon far and near, refused to take tho reel from tho depot, was much com mented upon yesterday in the borough, as also in firemen’s circles in Sandhurst From further enquiries wo learn that there must have been a secret agreement not to tarn out for fires, as there was no rush of members to tbo depot, as is usual whoh tho bell is tolled.
