High and Jjow <Jknreh are aoaaewhat haokneyed expressions, yet they convey to the orthodox Anglican more than ordinary signifioanoe, and to advance one at the expense of tiie abasement and suppression of the other seems to our view tiie lead ing idea of the devottt Ohurchman of the day. Of Archdeacon Dove it may be said he is the very essence and type of the High (ZfhureThman—in appearanoe, education, Sianner, style, accent) all you could esire or wish, and yet a priest into whose soul is burned the words uttered by tiie .Bishop When he bowed his head to receive the episcopal blessing, and the words of consecration " receive the Holy Ghost" for the work of a priest, " whose sins thou dost remit they axe remitted, and whose sins thou dost retain they are re ihined.*' The rev. gentleman is tar above the ordinary type of mortals. His in-' eight into character and his acquaintonee with human nature we should put down to uncommon, "to know thoroughly his congregation in their various shades of ifaemg and faith, he appears to have mas tered the inscription leading to the hea-: then city, -'man, know thyself." His onmmand of himself waa only equalled by the command he had of his audience, and both proclaim that a master spirit throbs in his breast. Hesitancy in style or the slightest approximation to ner vousness was nowhere to be seen. Arohdeaoon Dove is the master of his position; yet though the rev. gentle man, in demeanor and notion, evi dently istt Jjimself the priest of God— '^ip?gh his voice was sweet, if not musical, yet jpharp. wa. a strange softness, an effenunacy almost . mechanical in his every nation, word, and entire bearintf'/ tiiat we oould not avoid mentally tbAnk-' ing "Sod that he had no power over City' Sketcher; and we should certainly have regarded oar cases* hoi-deos had we to receive absolution at his hands—our moral weakness, like tiie leprosy of *NsAmsn—-the subject of the Artmdeaoon's discourse--would certainly haveoleavei' tons for ever. The ray. gentieman fa, indeed, High CShuroh---06ry high. There is salvation for poor m-iners nowhere outside the pale of his otmimunity—no mfataking -the object of his preaching—the reatoxstioa of ths Church to her pristine glory. We felt ss we listened that tiie old shout .of, the-Judean.- anthnsfaats. waa re-eehoing hers. **>The tnmpfa of the Lord are we,"' and in-onr jhenrt tiianked God that onr viewa of Cmriatian truth, and the nispnpr of Cmristisn worship, were not quite so elevated as the Church at Welk?rville. The Ohuruh is the centos—tiie Alpha and the Omega—the wnauffl bonum of tbe rev. gentieman.preaching,snd the ritual bf wprship all tends to this. Clraaes, bowings, flexions, and. genuflexions are tiie order of. the. day. And what is the hnal sim, the ultimate goal of all this! to history to repeat herself, and are we to have again in our churches the humbug and fe)oliMmeas of the age ofCon?toAtmel or are we to regard tiie doings of Dr. Piisey and hfa school of theology as an attempt to drive home the wedge and* shiver our Protestant pmitionbf fosedom'' of ik?uskt,-and worship, toAtoms.

Cromwell, entering the Houses of Par liament after one of nu hard-earned vic tories, commanded, concerning the roses, " Take away thatbauble.'' And did Aroh -deaon Dove break away from the tram mels of High-Ohurchism—sweep away its many forms, and remove this cosily bauble—aa imposing ritual— -few me?, aery fern, would figure ao prominently in £?
