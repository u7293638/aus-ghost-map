Parted. Morven F.BENNETT. I sit within my western home As tristful as a ghost; My body exiled, yet my mind Is with thee on the coast. Once more I troad familiar ways*'. . ' t)nce more beside tbee stand; Once more I.btash. beneath thy gu% .: B> Onoe'more caress thy hand. And, half with laughter, half with t«ar% . O My eyes, grown misty-wet, '-' ' Bear witness that m* heart at least Refuses to forget. • - • ■■ The tear has dropped upon Urn page That trickled down my cheek; For when the heart is brimming full Mere words are cold and weak. I sing to many an alien ear The songs that were thy choice, And warm to him whose tones recall The sound of thy dear voice. •The breeze that stirred thy blinds at morn Hath crossed the miles between, And here, out west, at nightfall stirs My bedroom window soreen. In undertones it seems to bear Tby message, low but clear— •• Though absent in the body, love, In spirit I am here." Farewell t Tis bat • little while; Our hearts, now lone and sore, BhaU yet onite their sundered ways, To part, I trust, no more.
