THE ECLIPSE. -THE INDIAN EXPEDITION. From Indian papers we learn that the ex pedition was successful in every way. For full accounts of tho observations mado and the additions to astronomical science effocted, we must wait. But Mr. Lockyor's brief telegram is quito enough to show that much of what ho said astronomers would be willing to wait ! for cen turies to ascertain is already solved! There is significance in tho ono great fact that the constitution of tho corona turns out- to bo nebulous: It is, therefore, allied to the comets arid meteorites, which may bo de scribed as tho ghosts of tbo solar system ; almost immaterial and yet occasionally visible, to tho terror of tho ignorant. Captain Hogg, R.E , who presided over tho photographic department, ob tained six good photographs from which great results are expected, ho having succoedod in pho tographing tho corona. Tho crowd of natives, round the Bjlfry Bastion, on tho Esplanade, 'was very great-; they sot up a meat hideous bowl directly totality commenced, fancying that tho end of tho world was at hand. They wero under the impression that the whole 01 tho expedition with assistants and all here dur ing the eclipse were going to got into a balloon aud off to the sun and not return ; how disap pointed they must have been when they found that the observers hod not taken their departure to that celestial orb. JuBt before totality it was intensely cold, and all the birds could be seen winging their way to the troes. It was not nearly so dark during totality as had been expected. The report of the expeoi-ion will, on their roturn to England," bo laid before the eclipse comroitteo in Loudon, and tho right Hon. tlio Secretary of State, when it wiil doubtless ba published.
