I BY TEÏ,EG"A1'H. | (IOM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THE V. R. C. AUTUMN MEETING. FIRST DAY. MELBOURNE. SATURDAY. The Autumn Meeting of the V. R. C. was inaugurated under circumstances not quite so favourable as Usual, as the heavy rain which continued far into Saturday morning made the running ground heavy, and fast time was not to be expected. The conditions were more akin to those of the winter steeplechase meeting than a race day at this period of the summer. The hill and flat were well patronised, and the grand stand and reserve were pretty well occupied. His Ex - cellency the Governor attended, with his aides-de-camp and private secretary, and arrived on the course just before the first race; but Lady Loch was not present. The general attendance was so satisfactory that the receipts actually were far in advance of those of any previous year, despite the unpromising nature of the day. The defeat of Malua was in some degree excusable, for on his return to the paddock, those who had backed him for the Champion Stakes were dismayed to find that the stiffness of a few minutes before. had developed into decided indications of lameness. From the start in the Ascot Vale Stakes, right down to the upper stand enclosure, Monte Christo seemed so palpable a winner that people accepted his victory as a matter of course. He galloped hard held, with his mouth wide open, and appeared to have any amount of power in reserve. The rider of Uralla appeared also to have accepted the race as a foregone conclusion for Monte Christo, and it was only on finding himself close to the colt that he set to work in real earnest. Uralla answered in a manner which destroyed all doubts about her pace, while Monto Christo's style conveyed just the same result in the opposite direction. Whether it was that Hales, who has barely recovered from a severe illness, was unable to ride the colt with sufficient energy when the crisis came, or whether Monto Christo had gone off, whilst Uralla had improved, are open questions. Uralla, however, won by half a length easily. Mr. White's pair were together, several lengths in advance of everything else, and the race was a sort of match between them. There was a good deal of hooting from the hill, especially when Wales came to weigh in, and an answering cheer from the bookmakers and other better disposed people in the enclosure in no way allayed the fooling about the race. The Hon. J. White's friends and stable were just as sorely disappointed as the general public, the bulk of their money being on the colt. The time for the Newmarket Handicap was the slowest that has yet. been recorded for the race. The owners and con- nections of Coronet as well as the general public are heavy winners over the result. ESSENDON STAKES. mile. Hon. W. Pearson's Commotion, by Panic Evening Star (Power) 3 Mr. J. O. InsHs'Malua (Robertson) 2 Mrs. S. Uartln's Reginald (Boase's Hon. W. Pearson's Plausible (Wood) ... 0 Mr. J. Wilson's, jun., Off Colour (Moore). 0 Mr. if. Jacob's Metal (Nicholson)... 0 Batting ; 5 to 4 v. Commotion, 6 to 4 v. Malua. On coming home to the straight. Commotion moved up rapidly to the front, with Off Colour and Reginald close behind him. Robertson moved earlier than usual on Malua and had the whip busy. When half-way up the straight the Cup winner came with one of his characteristic rushes ; but the effort was only sustained long enough to carry him into second place, and Commotion won comfortably by five lengths. Malua was two lengths in front of Reginald. Time, 2 minutes 47 seconds. ASCOT VALE STAKES, Colts, 8st. 10lb. ; fillies, 8st 7lb. } mile. Hon. J. White's Uralla, by Chester Moonstone, 8st. 7lb.

Mr. M. Jacob's lady Claudia (O'Brien) 0 Betting : 6 to 4 on Monte Christo, 4 to 1 v. Uralla, 6 to 1 v. Dunlop. When the flag fell the bright green jacket of Antonio was conspicuous in the front, with Lady Cbmdia, Monto Christo, Dunlop, and Buttress next, and Uralla last. At the tan crossing Monto Christo seemed to have a slight lead of Lady Claudia near the rails, and Dunlop on outside, both of which were close upon him. Uralla came up very fast, and half way up the straight Mr. White's pair wore the only two in the race. As Monto Christo was still pulling hard, his victory was hailed as a certainty, but Uralla came very rapidly from the end of the carriage paddock, and there was evidently going to be a race for it, when Uralla got on terms with the favourite; but he seemed to be incapable of effort, and thus the filly won by half a length. There was a gap of eight lengths between Monte Christo t ted Dunlop. Time, 1 minute 21 seconds. The following is a table of winners of the Ascot Vale Stakes.

Nearing the turn for home the horses closed up in a heap, all four still galloping well within themselves. Silver King led into the straight, and there seemed a prospect of a grand race between Silver King, David, and Mozart ; but at the distance the favourite drew out and won a slow race with ease by a length and three-quarters.

Coningsby, Town Moor and Surrey 25 to 1 v. Topaz and The Bohemian ; 40 to 1 v. Middle march and St. John. Some delay was caused by two false starts, and when the leg droppedVolocipedo remained at the post and lost a lot of ground, Mistake also getting away badly. The horses went some distance all in a hue, those who appeared to be quickest on their legs being Duenna, Mascotte, Sir Garnet, Hannibal, Prometheus, and Westbury. At the tan gallop, Prometheus went back, and was never afterwards in the leading division ; and Lavington, Blink Bonny, Battailous, Amelia Victoria, and The Ghost held good positions, up to this point. approaching the lower end of the carriage paddock, Mascotte had a lead of Blink Bonny and Batt unions, and the next division was made up of Sir Garnet, Amelia Victoria, and Middlemarch. Coronet up to this point had been in a good position close to the rails, but at the upper end of the lawn he swerved right across the track. Talbot's pair were both amongst the first batch at the half distance, but here Coroner, who had been fairly steadied, was called on by Cracknell for a final run, and coming away from Midd'lemaroh, won by three-quarters of a length. Sheet Anchor was half a length behind Middle march, Battailous fourth, The Ghost fifth. Leporello sixth. Garnet seventh, Blink Bonny eighth, whilst the colours of Prometheus, Lavington, Westbury, and Coningsby were prominent amongst the succeeding division. Mistake and Velocipede were the shippers in.
