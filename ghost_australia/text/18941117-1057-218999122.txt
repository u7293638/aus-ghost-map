Tho Q.T.O. Mooting shows what a good horso Battalion is, and I hoartily congratulato Mr. Eastaughffo on his possession, and Mr. Callaghan on his brooding. Only a soloct fow know that tho Dalby gelding was so good, and I boliovo thoy throw in for a good atako. The Queensland Oup this year is evidently going to bo a " star " raco, tho best over seen in Queenoland. There aro no loss tlpm OS entries, and in addition to tho local horses the following Southern crocks bavo boon nominated : — Patron (tho Molbourno Oup winner) Harvostor (Dorby winner), Portsoa (Champion winnor), Buccleugh, Solanum, Dreamland, Nads, Pilot Boy, Nobloman, Thoo- doro, Havoc, Pilatus, Tho Trior, Question, Tho Enohantor, Ballator, The Dauphino, &o.; What is bringing all the borsos up 7 Not the Queonsland Oup of 200 sovs. suroly. No — no. Tattorsall's 100,000 6s. consultation. You soo it is vory likely to fill- If so tho drawor of ono , of those cracks can afford to lay tbo owner £3000 to nothing against his horse. Ho would not como for £200, but £3000 is worth coming for. But how aro thoy to be handicapped over uiv uap ouiancc muesj r now bring Patron and Sybil togethor, Portsoa and Jealousy, &o.;, &o.; 7 Ono connpt poBsibly put 13st. on a raco- hone in a flat raco liko the Oup — but how bring them togethor.

I am very ploased to loarn that Greyfriar is all right again, and I boliovo Stone will win a big raco with him yet. A correspondent, writing from Bange's Bridge, Macalister, furnishes " Battler" (in tho Courier) tho podigroo of Battalion, the winner of tho Frmco of Wales Oup and Southport Handicap at tho late Q.T.O. Mooting. Nancy Till, tho dam of Battalion, is by Drum Major (imp) from Betsy Martin, by Tamerlane from Lollypop, by Free trader, and is owned Dy Mr. M. Callaghan, who bred Battalion. Tho Cap winnor woe foaled on tho 16th December, 1889. Mr. Oallaghan has two full brothers, ono throo yoar old untried, and one twoyoars, and also a yearling sis tor. iv anoy xm is visiting Battailous again this soason. The third and fourth day's racing at the Y.B.O. meeting resulted liko tho first two day's in some surprises. On the Thursday Walluco setonishod his best friends by running away with tho Flying Stakes and cutting outtbo sovon furlongs in lmin. 27jsec. Evidently tho son of Carbine — Melodious is a "star" galloper, and if ho can stay will give trouble next season. I fanoy he will take a lot of watching in the next V.B.O. Derby. Quivsr ought have won the Oaks in a canter, hut Moore kopt her at the post, and did not Start. His license was immodiatoly withdrawn, and quite right. Begins won easy. Fortunatus astonishod evoryono by coming out and winriifis tho RoyalPark Stakes (14 miles) w.f.o! Dreamland and Pilot Boy filling tho places, and Buenalf finishing in tho ruok. Dreamland carriod a 101b. penalty, and was close up in 2min. 39Jseo. This proves that his Dorby form was all wrong- Bessie McCarthy won the Veteran Stakes from Lady Trenton and Warminster. On the Saturday Preston came out and won tho Spring Stakes (If miles, Dorby weights), boating Malachite and Enchanter. Dreamland and For ward wore unplacod. Form wrong again. Quivor showod what a " soft thing " the Oaks was for hor by win ning tho V.B.O. Handicap (If milos) in 3min. 4socb., Loyalty and Straight- fire finishing second and third, with Nada, Tim Swivollor, and a host of other good ones in tho roar. Harvester showed what a good colt ho is by win ning the Canterbury Plato (2 milos w.f.a.) beating Carnago and Ohostor- ynan, while Malachite, Question, and T.n.4y Trenton woro unplacod. limo, 3min.

A maro originally yclopt Jano, hut now obscured undor tho incognito of No. 139, of tho Dry Dock, East Broad way and Avonuo B. railroad lino of Now York City, is tho possessor of a luxurious, silky, curly, and blond moustacho, fully 4in. in length. The appoaranco of this on tho noso is de cidedly freakish, oven more singularity boing; added to it by the stable boy occasionally waxing the ends of tho hirsuto appondago. Young Horace Dawes, who rodo "Patron. tbn nrinn/ir nt fnlVimivnrt Oup, is a son of Harry Dawes, bettor known as "Ohifnoy, a fino cross country rider in his day, and who him self, when scaling only 6st. 4lb., won tho Molbourno Cup on Banker 31 years ago.
