AUSTRALIAN NAVAL DEFBN . Sin,—With the exception of the Royal Arthur, the Australian Fleet is more ornamental than useful for fighting purposes, comprised as it is of a miscellaneous oollection of odds and ends ( n m ; ships, etc.) picked ont by the Home authorities % of no account as a help to England, but goodenOBgb to make np an Australia Squadron. W hy shouldn't Australia have warships for the defence of her “ longwash " of eoastline commensurate with her wealth and importance a s a coming Federated Nation t Even the small Republics °f Cbiii aod Peru hare warships <4 a calibre capable of smashing the whole Australian Squadron into smithereens, and in an engagement with either the Chilian or Peruvian battleships, the unprotected cruisers, MUdura and Karrakatta, etc., would not have the ghost of a show. My bumble opinion is that the feverish anxiety exhibited by the several Premiere iu despatching contingents was done with an astute eye to the foture—a sprat to oatch a mackerel—so that Australia could depend more then ever on the assistance of England to defend the former's shores. Although the writer Is sorry to say chat he baa known many each fellow fie loaf on the old folk os long as poccibm for a living and protection. I t looks rather mean for a vigorous young country to hang on to the apron strings of the Mother Country—an old burdened mother a t that. Already the Home p aten are discussing the dpoadenoe of England sinoe she undertook the Roar war, and who can foretoll that England will hold the sea supremacy fora future lengthy period P Both Germany and Franco will have a big try to deprive England of h«r naval lead, and Australia should be *up and doing, shifting for herself in the m atter of defending her own oolonies, and not for* eonicription would be the best days* worl Australia ever did | providing a sore remedy for the Australian curse of lariikisism. A smart drilling would be the salvation of host* of our young fellow* now wasting their spare time smoking cigarettes and expectorating at the street corners.—Youw, truly, BRITON.
