TUE BASK QF DEATH. In Fancy's warld a valley lies, Of dark and fearless hue. Where, noiseless, viewless., vast of she, A river oozes through. Across that river, to and fro, A baik still gliding keeps ; Yet stirs it not the wave below, In si euee drear that sleeps. »For, spectral as a cloud by night, That bark appears to view Nor can the form that guides its flight Be seen the darkness through. 'Tis Death ! a shadow huge and dim He sits to pilot o'er Enfranchised ghosts, recalled by him Froia- Time's sprite-haunted 6hore. Oh whither glides that spectral hark ? Far 'rind the gloom 'tis gone! A gait, through vista long and dark, It comes-w>th Death alone ! Once more to Time's o'ershadowed coast It speeds!-Once more appears, Surcharged with many a silent ghost, And towards the Future steers. And thu«, while. Time's dread course shall last. O'er that dark river's tide, To fill the Future from the Past, Death's bark shall ever glide!
