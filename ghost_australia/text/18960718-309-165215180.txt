, A Difference of Opinion. 1 What constitutes the point of a joke is largely a matter of opinion. A German one day expressed himself as being souie vrbat offended because an American gen tleman had asserted that his Teutonic countrymen could not as a rule appreciate American jokes. ?-? 'Try one on me!' said he defiantly, and the American accordingly told him tbe etory of the tree 'out west' which was so high that it took two men to see to ths top. One of them saw as far as he could, and then the second began to look at the spot where the first stopped seeing. The recital did not raise the ghost of & j=niile upon the German's face, and the other said to him: 'Well, you see, the joke is lost on you. You can't appreciate American humor.' 'Oh, but.' said the German, with the frankness characteristic of his country men, 'tbat is not humor — that is one lie:' —Tit-Bits. ?
