THE FEDERATION OF LASO VU. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-The circular emanating from the General Labourers' Union of Australia, Wagga Wagga branch, issued to the members there is a valuable document in more respects than one, and should be welcomed by the public as such, notwithstanding it is so largely made up of strange contradictions, ill considered assertions, v ague, covert threats, and a pro ended discovery of a conspiracy to crush unionism, and the usual abuse of the employing class, intended, doubtless, to show that the labour To ideas of Wagga Wagga do not intend to relinquish their hold upon the minds and bodies of the bush workers while the ghost of a chance remains of retaining it, Still the document is a valuable one, and 18, considering its source the most encouraging one that I remember to have are id as emanating from Australian in cream, and if carefully read between the lines it points clearly to the beginning of the end of an era or folly and the dawn of a clearer vision At the same time I do not suppose for one moment that the authors of the circular referred to intend it to be so understood, but it cannot be helped The copy of the circular is before me, and it plainly tells bush w omen to accept work at whatever wages obtainable, and to avoid strikes as they would the Evil One and wait for better times This is just the layers of the advice usually tendered by labour leaders to their following and is, in fact, just the same that would be tendered by (say) the National Association, and by all who, like myself are opposed to non unionism, believing it to be an institution existing only for the benefit of its paid officers and Parliamentary representatives, at the expense of thousands of unfortunate men who have reduced themselves and families to poverty at the bidding of others who were talking and agitating more than working All the same, such is the advice given and we may inquire. Why this change of front ' The reason is not far to seek, and may be found in their own on chair to mean that it iflgi.idu.illy dawning on their minds that they have been standing on untenable found in short, that the value of labour, as of all else, is governed by the universal law of supply and demand All real friends of labour will be glad to know of this conversion, and will only regret that the discovery was not made before the late maritime strike Most certainly had they been as wise before as after the event, Sydney would not be invaded as it is by an army of professional beggars It cannot be too clearly demonstrated to wage-earners that, allowing there is no demand for their labor on account of a falling market, no combination of workmen can keep up what is termed the current rate of, or prevent its further decline There is no case on record where such result has followed If I am wrong in this contention the army of labour leaders can take this as a challenge to produce evidence to the contrary Unionists have a right to be shown where they have benefited, and to what extent is the colliery districts the miners have for yours recognised the principle of the market value of what they produce as governing the rate of wages which are regulated by the selling price of coal, and although in the case of the colliers a fixed minimum was arrived at beyond which it is desired wages should not sink, there can be no doubt that should the price of coal fall below what would pay that minimum wage and still leave a profit, wages must still further decline, or the output of coal cease There is no escape from this under existing commercial conditions, and wage owners ought to try to see the matter in that light before it is forced on them by still harder lessons, otherwise that certainly will be the case In this connection it i is worthy of remark that the labour leaders believe, or pretend to, that their failure is due, not to inability of the employing class to pay more in wages, but rather that the union of labour is incomplete " " Once get all labour under one banner," they say, I " and the rest will be easy " Oh, the pity of it 1 That thousands of men should be so easily fooled There u absolutely no evidence to support such a belief, even if all men who work for wages were enrolled under one banner (which is very unlikely, because all men do not think alike, and never will, and never have), neither is it desirable that such should be the case, for obvious reasons But that complete unionism, or what is termed the federation of all labour or wage-earners acting under the control of a labour executive could not possibly succeed in its effect, follows as a natural sequence of what has gone before No intelligent w workman can fail to see this if he honestly tries to follow my line of argument, because I shall only state facts that must be within the knowledge of every workman, especially trades unionists, as it is in mine He has only to exercise his memory in connection with the history of unionism during the past, say, seven years, or before the Trades and Labour Council took a very prominent part in labour matters, to discover that union successes or failures were not of a character that jeopardised industrial enterprises, since they aimed only at advancement in an equal ratio with the general progress, and were not political, and sought not to dominate And although friction sometimes occurred, the business of the country was not seriously interrupted Up to this point it may be said the public were in sympathy with trades unionism Then commenced a new era in their history New unionism sprang into existence, and federation of labour began to be talked of, and everything was to be made subject to the will, of trades-unionists, dicta- tion became enthroned, and mind was to be governed by matter, and Parliament was to exist only at the will of and to carry out the demands of T U a social upheaval was to take place, in which everything at the ton wanto bo coat to the bottom and vice versa, and labour was to be lord of all disputes that were more or less amicably settled by employers and their workman, were now to be undertaken by a small army from the Trades and Labour Council For instance there might be a dispute in the printing trade and it was sought to settle it by the inter- v cution of a shearer and a wharf labourer Breaches that might easily have been healed became w idenod , w workmen in one trade got into trouble with their employers, and all other trades that could be reached by labour agitators became involved also Now unionism was determined to go the whole hog strikes followed each other in quick succession, all claiming to have the support of the public (as is now the boast re the Broken Hill strike; Ali in turn met with a humiliating defeat, or else the com- promises were of such a oh tractor that the volume of employment became lessened, and one defeat differed from the other only in degree, the last being more complete than the former, and just in proportion as the strikes were part her reaching, including more trades and more people To put it shortly, just in proportion as they have reached nearer and nearer to complete unionism-if greater numbers and more trades involved mean that-so each effort in turn has been beaten back, crushed and mutilated, and thousands of pounds of their savings squandered, which might have been used in so many other ways for their benefit, because society had discovered what was the re- ii aim of unionists, and co existent with the growing strength of unionism, crew stronger also, opposing forces of resistance which ought to have been foreseen, and doubtless would have been, had labour leaders been men of ability The Newcastle district has not recovered from the strike of four years ago. The maritime strike has called into existence a powerful shipping interest all seafaring men know how they have fared in consequence Then come the employers association, and later the pastoralists, as the result of the aggressive action of the Shearers' Union, and then again the National Association, with whose objects aflore familiar Now the logical sequence of these series of defeats is that were all unions federated, and all workers joined the unions, there would spring into existence a counter federa- tion of all who were opposed to their demands the country would be divided into two camps labour on the one side and intelligence, enterprise experience, and responsibility on the other With the knowledge of all that has gone before, can any reasonable person doubt how the matter will and when those two parties came into conflict of IN No one, I take it, but labour leaders, and they will ever continue in doubt till the Australian workman, strong in his acquired knowledge for which he has paid so ably rises up and hurls them from their position as blind leaders of the blind.
