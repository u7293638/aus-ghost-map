REVIEW OF TRADE. , Wsdncsdav: Our local money matkot during tk«paat .waak has beon inactive owing to ths holidays. The ysar opens in somewhat depressing surround ings, the prospect of a good harvest having been materially interfered with by nns.ason.bls waather; still the steady development of our export trade, and the opening np of new sources of trade, with ooonomy at home, should do muok to plae. matters on a better footing. How tlia coming wool sales in London will open is aquestionof oonsiderahle interest to the money market, but tlio disappointment experienced at the closing sales of 1894 has effeotnally checked any very sanguine expectations of improvement. It is, however, hoped that later on tho American demand may become more pronounoad, and tlii, Bhould liavo an improving iniliicnee on prices. Owing tojihortjupplies of frozen mntton from tho River Plate this market has sensibly im proved. An extensive demand for small merino carcases is experieneod from Glasgow, nnd it is expected to ooutiiiue. Tiiis will be reassuring to shippers, and doubtless onoourago the expan sion of trade, from which muoh is expeotsd in the future. Tho London wheat market is also better, and the improved prioe, if sustained, may in somo degree compen sate for tli smaller yield this season. Our gold yields for tho paet year imlieata that the milling industry is sound, and further developments aro looked for in the current year, whiob, if realised, will tend to increase our looal wealth. Our butter, cheese and fruit exports are to bs supplemented by timber being added to the list, and the outlook for all is promising. On the other hand, it cannot he overlooked that political as well as individual financial troubles arc' at the raomont boforo tho country. The d.siro to avoid the latter has led to suggestions being made again in connection with the consoli dation of banking interests with a view, not only to reatore confidence in tile future, bnt to lift tho immediate burden of onll paying, which presses at the moment so heavily on tbe groat majority of tho population. The timo is opportune for tho discussion, as there is no present pres sure in any direction. The new banks arc in no way conneotod with the obligations of the old institutions so far ss their present business is conoerned. And lienoe customers and deposi tors need be under no apprehension of surprises being sprung upon tliem. As a a fact most of ths institutions hold gold against every sovereign received from their present customers, and notiiing can ocour under ordinary conditions to disturb this state of thiugs until 1898, so that practically there is quite sufficient timo to work out quietly and safely any arrangement which it may be found desirahlo to make. If it is decided that something shall ho done in the way of consolidating intcrosts in any direction, the sooner it is taken in hand the quicker will general confidence be restored.
