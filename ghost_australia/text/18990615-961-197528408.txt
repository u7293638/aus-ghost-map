MUNICIPAL SOCIALISM. STARTLING FIGURES. A. M. Thompson, in the ' Clarion,' thus writes on -Municipal Socialism :— 'Already the ' reproductive under takings' of our municipalities have cleared and paved a long stretch of road towards Socialism. A return fur nished by the Local Government Board at the request of a reactionary M.P., ?who thought to find it an argument against municipal trading, shows that a capital of over eighty-eight millions is invested in public gasworks, tramways, electric plants, markets, baths, -&c;, and that the average annual income derived there from is close on nine millions, of which no less than £3,613,668 represents the ; average annual nett profit to the com munity — profit which, but for municipal enterprise, would have gone to swell \the fat paunch of private Capitalism. The return is in every way gratifying and encouraging. As the following table indicates, every single department of municipal trading shows a profit : — 1 f OO N O 00 H 00 -N IQ M _ BC»C(|OI- i«t-iOiQ rt^ji co'c^ «3 cq O) oo^ . o^eo 10 eij^ -?'...' c'S'o eft'** ocni^mrff os'co't-^'*' eta 8 ^Trooww* r-i Nr1 , ' - HlH- ?

'Manchester derives an annual nett profit of £203,000 from waterworks which cost six millions. It makes £105,000 -per year from gas, £30,000 from markets, £20,000 from trams, and £'2(£000 from electric lighting. No wonder that the Corporation are asking for power to borrow half -a-rnillion for further electric undertakings, and that the Chairman of the Electricity Com mittee declares it 'impossible to say how much more money will be required in the future.' ? ; ? The municipalities of other great towns are pushing ahead in the same direction —concentrating private capital in public hands, proving to the people that they can do their own -work much better and, much more cheaply than any capitalists, and training a great race of public ad ministrators and public captains of in dustry in readiness for Socialism. Dear Old Tocsin,— Great Scott I how old . you are (for a Labour paper), and yet how vigorous. How many of your contemporaries have given up the ghost ere they counted half as many Summers as you have done. You have a herculean task belore you, and many dangers to encounter, the chief of which is, to my mind, the political quagmires which have engulfed or contaminated so many hopeful ventures. Your great strength lies in the voluntary spirit which seems to pervade your staff of writers, and the healthy, robust style adopted by .them, Many of the articles stir the blood like a trumpet call, and appeal to all that is natural iu man or woman. I am real glad to see that you are trying to- combat the mercenary spirit in the ranks of labour ; indeed, this evil spirit is a real hindrance ; the man or woman who is dominated by_ it becomes a ver itable prostitute. Up here, in this land of sun and sorrow, the labourites have had a great victory, ha; ha . ; ha ; pardon me, comrade ; the idea of social salvation through saviours has for many a year appeared to me sublimely ridiculous. Only the cultivatfon of the spirit of independence in the masses can bring about the establishment of liberty. There are a lot of political chain makers up here just now busily forging Federation fetters. Their blast is strong, their tools efficient, and the iron pliable. This damned civilisation kills me, I must get out ' back.'— Yours, &c;, Philosophic Savage.' The Town Council of Tarnopol, in G-allicia, Austria, recently decided to operate a munici pal bakery and sell .the bread at .cost price to the people. It also appropriated'' £200 for the free distribution of. bread amongst the necessi tous pooi1.
