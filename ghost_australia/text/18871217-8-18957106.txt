PUBLIC OPPOSITION BETWEEN PEEACHEES. i 'le the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.) Sir -Believing your journal to be read by some thirty five to forty thousand adults, und that such lectures as are In your issue of 3rd December cannot but be sowing strife, confusion and enmity in the hearts of young persons incapable of forming an exact opinion upon the merits of such .'public opposition between preachers," allow me to draw your numerous readers attention to the oanonical obedience eaati licensed ecclesiastic voluntary assumes on being ordained deacon and priest Canon S3, of London National Synod, A D, 1603, clearly delines the episcopal duty "Because," says the Synodal decree, "uponsuoh public dissenting and contradicting much offence and disquietude must grow uato the people, the bishop shall not suffer the preacher (bo orTending) any more to occupy the position which he hath once ¡.bused, except he promise laithlully to forbear all such manner of contention, until the bishop shall with all convenient speed take lurther orders thereon." And the reason and reasonableness of such canonical judgment obviously is this, " that God is not the author of con- tusion, but ot peace, in all churches of the saints ' Aud Canon 49 equally nliirms that no unlicen ed "preachershall take upon him to expound within his own curacy or elsewhere, any scrip- ture or mutter of doctrine,. for the confirmation of the true faith in Christ, and for the instruction and edification ol the people " And feeling quite sure that Bishop Pearson, who is absent for painlul causes in Eogland, on the one hand has never authorised such "publio opposition and contention," in Maitland in particular, or his Vicar-General, on the other hand, for the whola diocese ol Newcastle Allow me a small space to comment on such heading as the " Diocesan Branch of the AsBociation of New South Wale-, In Newcastle " terminat- ing with " the Church in this diocese will again have pease within her borders," yet not bearing the signature of an> one In ecclesiastical authority pertaining to such diocese in par- ticular, not one name pertaining to the episcopal function held by the grievouBly ufllfoted Bishop Pearson It is briefly very shocking to witness. and such evil-doings cannot but multiply and cause great joy amongst "recusants, "as enumerated alsoin Canons 06 and Gb of the same Holy Synod of 1003, in other wordB, rather than convert any from errors, Buoh contumelious eonduot is far more likely to harden all perverts aud make them embrace " infidel sentiments ' preferentially to conformity to suoh disputants Two of the solemn vows made by any English churchman in holy orders arc the following -" Will you reverently obey your Ordinary and other chief ministers unto whom is committed the charge nnd rule over you following with a glad mind and will their godly monitions and submitting yourselves to their godly jadgments? Answer I will so do, the Lord being my helper." And another vow is this " Will you diligently main- tain and set forward as much as lleth in you, quietness und p»nce and lovo amongst all Ohrlstlau people, und especially amongst them that ar« or hereafter shall be com-mtted to your oharge'" Ag«In the man ordained a priest anawereth, "I will so do, the Lord being my helper " Speaking from an expenenoe in matters ecclesiastical of half a century, and no npathelio spectator of the great evento in English history throughout Her Britannia Moje-ty a benelioent reign, the proceedings enaoted in your great town ara elmply horrible I I do not remember to hare read or heard of any similar misdemeanour by ecclesiastics-and such " publio oppo- sitions" must enormously add to the anxieties of lhe Primate Barry Before bia departure to Loudon, in conséquence of the Illness of his spouse, his Lordship openly stated that the m itiation of a puDlio agitation against uíb ruling g reatly oppressed him then a fortiori how much deeper aud gravir must be uíb anxieties on reading of an " organising seoretary' going about and seeking to swallow up thousands or yuuna people willing to contribute towards payment for himself of ¿500 u year and travelling expenses Did Paul thus uot when disputing wfth the schismatics at Corinth, or did Appollos olaim n license to do and say what he pleased, nnent the mysteries of the King- dom oi God11 Not one man in holy writ can be named as an ODonfomentorol strife and debate amongBt Christian people at a retaining fee or permanent salary, paid by tUelollowers of JeBUB our Lord 1 , But some caviller may Bay, " Oh, but we have not here any Ecclesiastical Courts as they have in Lnglund and Wales, wo have not here any dlooesea defined und legalised by Parlia- ment we hove not hero any Synods possessed of powers of ex- communication, or any bishops in number sufficient to go about and put to rights matters provocative of indignation, and so on " To which vaia word* let me respond bv asking if that does not make " Canonical obedience," i e submission to the solemn vowe above recited, so much the more obligatory on men of faith and prayer and charity ? Tor surely an obedience based on fear of temporal oonsequeuccs ia not to laudable *' in all Churches of the Sainte," as that which springs out ol love to God the Saviour of ull tue faithful and charity towards all men' " Give no offenoe, neither to the Jew nor to the Greek, nor to any of the Church of God ' cannot be made more obligatory or imperative, because the wilful and deliberate offender has thrown i p a quasi paroeliLl charge, or because he despises the dominion of any diocesan, or because he laughs at heresies and eoUisma " Better that a millstone be round the neck of such an offender, and that ho drown himself in the deep ocean, than he should cause any lambs (£« young people) to forsake Christ's Hook " It must needs be that uflenoes come, " Yea said the Holy Ghost," by the lips of the same followers of Christ. "Out of yourowu selves will some arise and say Derverse things to draw awoy disciples after them " Surely suoh £500 a year and travelling costs had far better be paid over to the Centennial Fund thun to any travelling preaoher - I have, etc, DANIEL j».
