A Catholic Navy. i-noM THE Ave Mitria. During the late—the latest—war one heard a good deal about " converted cruisers," but the term ought henceforth to be reserved for a new navy, which our missionaries hope to float in South American waters. A priest of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost laboring on the banks of the Amazon wrote last year to his superior unfolding an ingenious missionary plan and suggesting that he could carry it out with less than 2000 dols. Curiously enough, at the same time the superior received a letter placing at his disposal " the sum of 2000 dols. to be applied to any mission whatever, even, if need be, to that in the country of the Amazon." The missionary then went forward with his plan. A little steamer was bought in Philadelphia and fitted out as a church. It was then sent down to thread the innumerable rivers of Amazonia, bearing priests to preach the gospel and administer the sacraments to the natives, who throng the river banks. Thus the two great drawbacks to missionary work in that region—the scarcity of priests and the difficulty of travel—are removed at one stroke. The new " converted cruiser" is called,the Christopher or "Christ- bearer," and the fcyssionary to. whom it owes its conversion ttyiis-.writes of it in the Annals of the Prppnyatioif the Faith : "'*\ijDught we not now to be satisfied? No, not We njed a flotilla of Christophers, but abovejill f ''wuliaut missionaries to travel ofi'•".' ffieiij^n/r evangelize the populations scattered^lefig the borders of these immense rivers. One may readily judge of the good that can be done there from the following figures given by Fathers Parissier and Cabioiier as the fruits of their first cruise: 521 baptisms, .S30 confirmations, 101 marriages, with a corresponding number of confessions and communions." The worthy priest thus submits a motion for the enlargement of his navy, a motion which we heartily second.
