'i DID NOT MEAN TO KILL HER.' .\' It was not long after the encourage ment given by her amilo that Lisabeta, as she followed the footmen, who were with difficulty lifting the Countess into, her carriage, saw the young officer dose; by her aide, and felt him seize her hand. Before' she could recover , from hor »ur priae:he was gone, leaving a note in her palm, which she hastened, to conceal in her glovo. During the whole of the drive sho neither saw nor heard anything, ? answered every question at random, and ' was sharply rated for, it by the countoaa. When she returned home, she flew to her ' chamber, and took out the note. It was ' not sealed, and consequently it waB im possible not to read it. The letter con tained a1 thousand protestations of love. ''It was tender and respectful, and trans lated, word for word ? from a.

J | Every day Lisabeta received a fresh' letter, which reached her sometimes one, way, sometimoa another./ ,He;no longer sent her translations from the German, . .but.wrpto under, the influence of iavi616nt ' passion,: and spoke a language which was ; that of her own heart. L-She now reoeive'd his lottern willingly, and soon replied to them. Every day-her answers became longer and more tender^ rT-At length she threw, out of j.thelwindow tlie following note :— ... f , . .''.This'dvening ' there? is 'a-J ball' 'at-Hhe French Ambassador's^ .The .CJounteas.is going, and we shall remain1 there rill -'two o'clock.

'?' - ' '. \- Horrcann stationed himself that night at.hja post as early as ten o'clock. It was a terrible night. The winds were let loose, and the snow fell in heavy flakes. The lamps shed only an uncertain gleam, and the streets were quite deserted. Though ho wore only a light frock, Hermann was not sensible either of the wind or the snow. At last the carriage of the countess made its appearance, and he saw two tall footmen lift tho infirm spectre in their arms, and deposit her on the cushions, wrappodi' up in an enormous pelisBe. Immediately afterwards, LiBabela leaped into the carriage, wearing a short mantle and her head wreathed with flowera. The door .'was closed, arid they drove' off heavily, over the soft anow.- The1 lightB in the windows of the firaffloor, were soon.' extinguished, and 'silence reigDed in the hotel. ' Hermann .walked up and down ;. he drew near one of the lamps and looked at his watch, it wanted about twenty minutea.* to eleven._ :? He .planted . himself against the lamp-post, and with his eyes fixed on the hands, impatiently counted1 the minutes which remained. * Exactly as the clock struck eleven, ' he ascended the steps, opened the street door, and entered .the ?vestibule, /which he found,. lit. up, j IJuokily, ithe porter was riot there. ' With! a firm ; and ? rapid ; step he cleared the! staircase iri the twinkling of an eye, ari'dj reaohed the 'ante-chamber.. There .Ee| Jfourid'a footman' asleep ;on a ?'dirty 'old I sofa.' Herman passed by;him ;o'ri':tip- toe! and crossed the dining-room. arid drawing-: room, in which were ,rio lights ; but thej lamp in the ante-chamber was a sufficient! guide. At last he arrived at the bed room, where a golden lamp waB burningi before a.cabinet filled with the imageB^of ' saints.v;;i Gildell chairs and' 'diyana of faded oplours,' '.jfiiH' large '.soft'' cush'ipri'sj were symmetrically arranged round' the rooiri, the iwalls of which i were hung'.with Ghina| silk.1 Two- portraits, were .in the'. roon-.,l puinted by Madame Lebrun.
