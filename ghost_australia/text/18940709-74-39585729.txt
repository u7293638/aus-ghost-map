TAMAR-STREET CHURCH. There was a good c ngregation at both services at the Tamar-street church yester day. That of the mornicg was conducted by the Rev. D. Brown, of Latrobe, who delivered a forcible address on the " Old order and the new." The text chosen was Acts of the Apostles ii., 17 and 18. He pointed out that Pentecost was significant as marking the birthday of the Holy Ghost in the sense that Christ's natal day was His birthday, and that having come into the world the spir;t had come to stay. This fact needed to be more cleirly and fully realised, as the cffects of such would be an increase in the moral and spiritual activity of the church. Pentecost also marked the abolition of the old order and the introduction of the new. The rev. gentleman then went on to show the chief points which the outpouring of the spirit indicated.
