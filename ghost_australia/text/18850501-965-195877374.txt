A letter from St. Jote's Wood stated that for a whole fortnight ihat neighbourhood had been. favoured with Spring-heeKd Jack's attentions; hie sometimes ^appearing as' a bear, and sometimes clad in mail.

'/ ; ':•:"'' Thinking, perhaps, that ha ha3 done .as much harm as he.desired»in the other parts of London, for a whole month Spring-heeled Jack devoted.himself to disturbing the peace, of mind of the dwellers in the East End of the metropolis, the neighborhood of Bow being .particularly..patronised by. him. One gross outrage came . before the police-magistrate at Lambeth-street,. and capsgd considerable attention. . • •. A young lady, named Alsop, living with her parents, in the vicinity .of Bow, stated that at about a quarter to ziine o'xslock on the evening of February 2h s 183^,. she heard a violent ringing at theiront gate of the house, and on going to the door to see what was the cause, Ehe .eaw a-man standing outside, of whom Ehe-enquired what was the matter. The person instantly replied that he was a policeman, and said: " Por God's sake bring me a Jight, for we have.caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane." She returned into the hpaee, and brought a candle and handed it to; the man, who was- enveloped in a large cloak. The instant she had done so, however, he threw pS his outer garment, and applying -the lighted-candle to his breast, presented a most hideous, and fri^itful appearanoe, and vomited forth a quantity of blue and white flame from his iqouth, his eyeB resembling ted balls of fire. Prom tiw hasty glanoe which hex fright enabled her. to get'at Ins person, «bis observed that he ^ore a large helmet, and his dress, which appeared to fit him •very tight, seemed tocher to resepible white" oil-skia.

Three ladies were oros^ing the heath at about six .o'clock, when th^foddenly eame npon a monstrous figure betOre; iBiem,> and as the lamps had been lit some titn^, they had a good view of it. The imohBter, they said, had a phosphoric lustra, shoved tremendous long ears, horns, and tail like Jfapse of a bullock. One of the ladies fell Sown in ~a fit, and the other two had resort to 3hat potent weapon In tho female armoury, < a good scream, which promptly brotight tt policeman to their assistance, and bnms boldadvance the apparition threw itself over Ms head and disappeared on the heath, "diini»g' which gymnastic performance, it yttaj&S;&i; the hooks, or springs, on ins heels weao itefihetly visible.

' Li a third booklet he appears as in halfarinour, with hdtnet, etc., his nether limbs being clad in a spieeies of fox-hunting costume, a huge cloak adorning his back. . Having sdarmed'the -dwmlers on the south lide of the Thames, s* as nearly to deprive them of their seises, he again crossed the water, and appeared to a party of people near Holldway in the gmse of a bear. Here, however, he met with j^r^raption he hardly contemplated, for theje being a brickfield, handy, the men of ihe party treated him to a shower ' of bricks, a srodjs of treatment which he by no meahB*elished, and whioh induced him to beat aspeedy retreat. One evening, near Lord Holland's gate at Kensington^ a gaunt figure accoutred like [Don Quixote and covered with spikes, was Been striding along the road, and, after staring in the faces of some labouring men, dieappeared in an instant. These men, it is said, Iwent into a beer-shop in the vicinity, and; then relating what they had seen, they i^gain -went to tho place where the figw bad appeared, in expectation of its return; Pcnvever, they did not meet it, but they Baw an unoonth monster, having the shape of an enormous baboon, playing its antics beneath aome trees which overhung the road. As the^ approached the creature sprang up on the braBches aad disappeared, Spring-heeled Jack, of .course, being credited with this my8terieits occurrence. Haokneywas fayored with an extraordinary vision of tfris ^naoy-®haped intruder on the public peace, for he appeared, so the story runs, in the shape o;!! a lamp-lighter walking oa his head. andl hartds, and carrying his ladder betwebn hls feet, to whieh was suspended a lanternoflarge dimensions, amply lighted. 'And thia curious creature, on being approached, xo^saulted so high that these who saw it weife* utterly astonished. But this; eorely, is^r%ther more than even the moat creduleus ouglit to fee expected to -swallow, and the o|oiy must have been manufactured to feed Jthe public taste for the marvellous. - ' 'Another glimpse Of him WAs had on the road to Woolwichj Vhcn a blue flame issued from his mouth^and a girl who witneseed it fell into fits. H^a ^dress on this occasion is described ae that a gentleman, with the (somewhat" staxtjing addition of a wide strip of scarlet do'Wn the back of his coat. Being pursued, lie sprang over the fences as usual, and was out of sight in an instant. Still lingering in Kent, he was found the following night at Dartfop?, where he was clad in a bear-skin, and axrtysed himself with the mischievous trick of putting out the town gas and leaving the streets in darkness. The ubiquity of the fellow was something wonderful, and tended, of course, very much to enhance bis fatnfl; no sooner was he heard of in Sent than ha turned up at Hampstead Heath, springing over the furze-bushes and somersaulting oyer the gravel-pits. So numerous were the tales told of Springheeled Jack that a good many must be supposed to be true ; vrtiilBt, on the other hand, great allowan^ must be made for credulity, some people not being content with the marvellous as they find it, but being only too happy to add thereto. As a final specimen of the nonsense circulated about Ms appearance; perhaps the lolloping is about the best: A -wonderful eight, it was said, was witnessed oh Primrose Hill 6ne evening. On the summit appeared a huge figure of a man, in a flame of pale blue; it then assumed the bulk of a massive elephant, then of a windmill in full oper&tion;, and lastly, in lessening its dimensions, it became a luge ball of snow, wMch rolled down the hill, and escaped further notice. What Spring-heeled Jack had to do with this dreadful'appearance is not at all dear, but it was-attributed to him, neverthe- less, nioh was iQie hold that he had obtained over the public mind. '' Whether too much attention was beginning to be paid to him with a new to his capture, or whether his love,of mischief had died out, cannot be told, bnt oertain it was that nothing was known publicly of this singular being after April, I838, havin'g kept London in a ferment of excitement and terror for about w % six months. : The foregoinga« only a few of the stories, .veracious or omerjvise, that were related of him, spaoe not permitting any more detailed account tohegiveiL ..The notonety. tbls fellow had obtained rain's W^ have'had She eftect of making many silly youngmeneimilous to enact the ruffian in a small way, considering it the height of cleverness to frijjhten women and children out bf their wits, under the belief that Springheeled Jack was jattaoking them. Many cowardly assaults oh women were reported in various parts of the metropqlis, under the impression, doubtless] that it wac all a " lark;" but it was a joke flie jrietims hardly appre- (dated, aB^jihocdd lhey scream out in their terror, their unin^lly assailaiits did not hesitate to strike th^i with their fists in the mouth, in brdertQ|i!esce them. ; One.of th^'inutations of Jack, a young footman, irho ha^' lKpt the inhabitants of S^lburn in oonnderable alarm by sallying out Ql^ them ^gni^^ as a ghost, in a white sheet and MdeouB mask, from which depended a long beard, iras, captured and fined £4, whioh, eeems hardly an adequate sentence for the pfience, >e|ihg how seldom these —- 1 — gave justice a chance of punishing |n a i^tt'j^M^liw " A&," 0* Vbucb 11, 1638, is found a recipe wr the apre of " spririg-he^s " in 4,^iakB.

We are happy in having the best opinion that no person afflicted with' Spring-heeled Jackism' can withstand the effects of .this treatment of his nervous system." . Undoubtedly, If -tins prescriptibn had been followed extensively in its entirety by the inhabitants of London, there - would hot have been much more heard of the pranks of these cowardly fellows, whose only redeeming point was th at they abstained from plundering those who had been weak enough to ba frightened by their appearance.
