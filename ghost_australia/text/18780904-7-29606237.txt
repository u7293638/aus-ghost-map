The House adjoaraad at 10 minutes past 9 o'clock till ata*<£y! *^ Since by an oturwhtJstting Baa|ority th« people's renreeeatativee in the Assembly decided to repeal the Sviday-dosi?g por tion of Nock's Act the friends of that anea aure in Tmrioos parts of the colony have been ex«rtinjr tbeaiselves to get op an appearance of a popular demoastratioa in iv favor, in order to induce the Legislative Council to reverse the decision of the mem bets of the Lower House, who hare been just returned by their constitaefits after having declared their views upon this ques tion. Nock's Act was passed in the third session of the last Parliament, when there was no warrant whatever for supposing that it was in harmony with the wishes or feeling? of the community. The new Hoase has, by a majority of about two to one, con demned it. Sneh legislation as Xock'a Act should be reprobated even when imposed by the majority upon tae minority; for nothing canjustirya hundred persons in dictating to ninety what beveimgea they shall drink, or how they shall spend their Sundays. Were it proved that rioting and drunkenness to any considerable extent arose from the «s> isting state of the law, there would be some fair ground for interference with personal liberty to check such evils, but nothing of the sort has been ahown as a justification of Nock's Act, which seems to be simply founded upon the principle that it is wicked for persons to drink beer in or fetch it from a public-house on Sunday evening, and that the State should stop such profanation of the Sabbath. In fact the object of the Act is far less to promote temperance than to force FwAhataria?iam upon the people, and this the speeches at the gather ings in favor of the Act abundantly prove. One thing noticeable in connection with the recent meetings ia opposition to Mr. MorOock's BUI is the profound i&difterence; with wbich the colonkU generally seem to regard them. A foreigner dropped sud denly among as might suppose that the almost unanimous voice of South Austra lians was opposed to the recent action of the Assembly, aad woull be rather tar prised if he wen told that at the general election a few months ago the ekcton ex pressed the greatest antipathy to Nock* Act, not only in districts which retarafti ■nan pledged to tapes! it, bat in others whan from local causes, personal predr- Wtiow, or the scarcity of candidates they ebon aa timr nyn—Uliwi atea who j www* their jatoatfca to wifwl ft.

The t ;audn prmoplee upon which the Bill is to L: 1? framed have been .affirmed; the details ; . muet/nec?Ssarily require the moat patient : and careful Icpnslderetion. • --Ths Bill-for the and preserva : rfemof Mimtae.colony was read a second ■ /isjua?odnasEed tiirougli Committee in the \:' T^tg^P^ Coupcil on Tuesday, September. , - ;S; Q3je tneasurej which is eert?jnly a much :; naeded tme nnd Mkelv to prove of really. \-- pfactical iitflity, met "with «arcely any ' : -oppoeifioni except, from Mr. Hogarth, who :. .^experienced the' same difficulty that em- U iiutaa^ealii?L, with regard to many useful 'measures in perceiving the necessity for ■ «ny legislation on die sabjeot.

BiH, eUhough it consists of «ie«ome ' "what faamdable number of 24 dauses, is -' in reality & simple one. Its main features *' -are fie prohibition of the use of improper "^ . fishing unplemfints, and of dntgging on } / 3and nets;., containing fish.: The utter j£nc&t;? hu, it iswell known, produced a ' port injurious effect in England, where it 3B nowstzictly prohibited, as neta must ■. TMCBBEarily enclose fish unfit for sale from ■xiot ibeing fully grown, and these by being: •_ en shore an killed, whereas if tbe : net ay emptied in the ptoper aianner in ■shoal water such young fish can be pre -aerred unln|urt)d^::^!^e'"peualties for using improper vwl nets «SBore la fixed -at Jiot less than £2 nor man than £30.

UteKll renders the use of dynamite or any ■ "for tin 'purpose of destroying fish. & felony, ' pnmsh&Ue; by imprisonment with hard , 3abor . for any term, not exceeding -. four, years." This may appear a \- aomew&at; severe enactment, bnt tJie fxactk? which it is intended to pre- J vtinl is one deserving severe punishment. =Some discussion took place over the eighth , ■rinufle, which, enacts that any person taking, Selling, x>r exposing' for sale, or being inpos ' session of fish, of certain kinds named in the \- below a certain specified weight ; 4&uall; be liable to a penalty of twenty pounds. The clause is copied from the fisheries Act of Victoria, and has not been found to work oppressively in that colony. J The chief objection was made to the -words • speaking of mere possession, and Sir Henry ; Ayez? drew a harrowing picture of cook- I maidei dragged off to the Police Court when . xetuming from market, and of elderly gentlemen coming back from Glenelg bear \- xcsj bomewards a tommy-rough for tea, ' I'pp'g rnthlessly collared by an energetic Fish Inspector far being in possession of £sh of; fllgg«l weight and duly mulcted .in a penalty of by Mr. Beddome \- on the L following morning. As was pftnw?n fin t" hfi^ffwm^fj lie Ttwirt hiiiih fixed for the -various fish is Buch that if of «o small a size they are unfit for food. The iactffithat the possession of such diminu tive fish must necessarily be made the eab ject of punishment, as it would,be sometimes Trnpoftahlfi to prove wben the fish were taken, and by whom, however euspicioua tbe *?iwjimu^MTi"?« might be. The clause j mB finally agreed to without amendment, «nd on the motion of Mr. Fisher a clause ; ■jxcfaataig tbe Northern Territory from tie '- «peratibn of Hie measure was struck out. : *Baee application of such a law to that por • fion«f tbe province is rather premature, \- canaidering Ac insignificant population there. : The Commissioner of Public Works will coove in the *—■■"Hy on Thnrsdav, Septem- : %er 12, for leave to jntoadaoe a Bill for the for cnation of a faflway from Bivarton to Clare via In the lVegiaWive Council on Tuesday ' next Sir Henry Ayers will move for leave to ' introduce * Bill for a railway between the township of the Grange and VToodville.

A young man named Thos. Fielding, of ' Valkervflle, died suddenhr at his nuaA^^ oa i!ona>y,September 2. He had been siting for Hia past fortnight, but had had no medical ad vice. H6 U supposed to have suffered from ieart disease, pp. jtfclntyre, who was called in after .deajft, could not, however, certify as io tie cause. The Gardner was communicated with, and an inquest will behejd on Wednesday. Witt Eeferenoe to the notice which fans appeared in tie papers stating that gentlemen Attending the ball at Government House to morrow are expected to appear in full dress, we understand gome .misapprehension exists. We suppose it was taken for granted that private civilians woold appear in evening eos tmne, bnt the intimation was intended to apply to person* having the right to wear military uniform, end to Civil servants who are not members of the legal profession. Barristers should wear Q.C.'por other legal costume Dsaally: worn at dress .evening parties by members of the bar. It will be seen by tbe acceptances for the &A-J.C.; Spring Meeting that the name of Bluet Anchor doe* not appear as an acceptor for tbe Steeplechase. We are informed that this is owing to an oversight on the part of his owner. ' who forgot that Monday was the day of general entry and: acceptance. There is some talk of .owners, of the ojher horses agreeing to let Sheet Anchor in, bat it is hot improbable that Mr. Stirling will be content to keep the grey for tie Hunt Qup, as he would stand a good •how of carrying off Mr. Ban Bmirh's gift, l—iitfl oeported to lie in, excellent condition. A fire broke out in Messrs. Stevens and Co.'s Cordial Manufactory, Currie-street, shortly after 6 o'clock on Tuesday evening, September 3\. Mr. J.

Newman, who was under the influence of liquor, got into the Strangers' I Gallery, and shortly afterwards made some j remarks. When remonstrated with by the I constable in attendance he began to swear at tii.w_ and. was a£~3once bundled out. All this was dene quietly, and many in the House were not aware that the man had been ejected until his voice was heard from below the Chamber. He violently resisted removal, and lifted up his j voice to such an extent as to interrupt the di«- i eussion which was going on in the *T«"i<"? The i debate was an the Government proposals for I taxation, and it was suggested by Mr. Bray that j the gentleman who was making the noise was an I opponent to the Government scheme, but the I Treasurer denied this. Mr. Bray then said pro- : bably he was a supporter, bat this was also < denied by the Treasurer, who evidently consi dered that it would not be a matter of congra- ■ tulatiou to have such a supporter.

On this occasion he visited the ketch, ■ which was lying in the Stream, for the purpose . of taking away bis clothes. He bad his be- \ longings in a bag, and in stepping over the side of the vessel for the purpose of getting into a '. boat he slipped and fell into tits river. He , was seen to fall by a man named George , Stepbenson, who was passing at the time in a beat, but he was unable to reach , the spot in time to render the poor fellow any assistance. Blanche straggled in , tbe water for a few moments before he sank. , Information was given to the Police, and Ser geant SoUtvan aad several of the Water Police j were soon on the spot, and dragging was kept : up with two boats until late in the evening, . but without success.

The fourth of a series of lectures now : being given by Or. J. D. Thomas on "Elementary Physiology,'' in connection with ■ the Adelaide University, was delivered to a fair ! audienoe on Tuesday evening, Septembers, in 1 the Stow Lecture Hall. The subject dwelt on , principally during the evening was the compo sition of the various parts of the body- (the i bricks and mortar, as the toctuter called them;, i Tbe various tissues and cells were classified and j described in a. very lucid manner.

At a meeting held at Woodchester to consider the necessity of erecting a bridge across the creek on tbe Strathalbyu and Cal liogton main road, Mr. Stanton, Chairman of die District Council of Onaunga, took the chair. Mr. Smith informed the ""^"g of the o^iniyp previously tflr^*p in the matter, and ex plained that it was on account pf the strong grounds shown in the memorials that went before the House of Assembly, both front tbe inhabitants of Adriaide whose traveOecs used this road, as Well as from lie surroanding dis tricts, when tile vote for the Junction Bridge was obtained, that the Government of the day were induced to place tie road on the schedule of main lines without further solicitation. This bridge was part of the same scheme, and he had been frequently asked by |he representa tives of those gentlemen in afl«il«i^? srho had signed tie memorial, when tie creek was to be bridged over, as it was about the worst place they had to cross in their journey. It was proposed by Mr. T.Williams and carried—"That this meeting consider it ad sisabfe io take steps to endeavor to induce Ui3 Cental Board of Main Roads to putabridg: across lie place in questton." Proposed by Mr. B. Sanderaudearried—"That a deputavtion be nnminated from this meeting witi power to get nnanyapemorial tiey may consider requisite, and to obtain the 00-operation of tie Btrath sJbynandauTroundingDWtriotOoaneQs.'' The following gentlemen were nominated for Onaunga:—Messrs. Benjamin Bandars, Barry, Smith, and tie Chairman. Messrs. Bell and MacFariane, who attended as a deputation from trie Stzatialbvn Corporation, spoke of tie great neoessity that existed for a bridge, and stated that they bad no doubt the Corporation of Strathalbyn, which entirely concurred with the movement, would appoint some of its members on tie deputation. A. preliminary meeting was held in Trestnil's Auction Mart, Olare, on Friday afternoon, August 30, to take steps to protect Nock's Act. The Northern Arms states that "there were several residents of the town and neighborhood present, and the Bev.E. Mitchell was voted to the chair. The Chairman thought that Nock's Act should have a. fair trial, for ao far it had worked well, and i^nm^j^tA aaA active means should be oaed to throw out Mort lock's Amending BilL The fiev. O. T. Newman said he had received copies of a petition against Mortiock's Bill, and tibat were they to appoint canvassers they conM gat the ps&tams; nume rously signed, and tie feeling of the people oould be had that way bettor than at a public m***jw,[. He considered that Nock's Act had done good. The streets had been much quieter on tie Bahbath Knee it came into operation, drunkenness had been Issssnod, and tbe pro moters of the measure felt that it wasaauc oaw. The publicans' interest wit at work to have it repealed, and MortlooWs Amnodms; BUI had passed its second reading in flu Assembly.

Mr. Thomas Moyaes aeoonded the nssjataon, which was carried unanimously. Boane arrangements were made in reference to the canvassers, and a vote of thanks to the Chairman brought tie meeting to dose." A large and influential meeting of tie residents of the Hundreds of Angas, Begot* and North Bhine was bald at Mr. ZsobonA wheat store, Sedan, on Friday, August SO. to take steps to co-operate with other districts in securing tie passing of a Bill for the compulsory and afannl taneous destruction of rabbits. Mr. H. A-Fie biger was voted to the chair. Mr. R. Start pro posed—" That, in view of the alarming increase of rabbits in this neighborhood, it is desirable that steps should be taken to urge upon Par liament the necessity of pasnini; an Act without delay for tie simultaneous and compulsory destruction of rabbits throughout the colony." He aaid be was quite able to oope with the nuisance on his own property, but when his neighbors did not alaotake action his efiorto to save his crop were useless. Since completing sowing operations he and his sons bad been almost continually employed killing rab bita on the adjoining travelling atoek reserve, averaging about 400 per week; but as no action was taken on the opposite sheep ran the animals killed were replaced inune dia ciy, and if he coasod killing them his crop would be totally destroyed. Mr. Boyalaeoonded the motion. He stated that since last February no less than 2jooo rabbits were killed without any decrease in their numbers being noticed, fast season be estimated that he lost 50 acres, of wheat, but feared that this year his loss woold reach 150 acres. He believed that unless ■ measure wm fasssil eoapslling every landholder to ex temunate tbe rabbits on his land, wheat grow ing would have to be given up on the Murray flats. Mr. J. Rocking supported, and BBfitiimr-1 that he extracted out of one warren on the travelling stock reserve 111 rabbits. To saiv his crop be was compelled to waste most of his time in tbe destruction of rabbits and their warrens on this reserve in place of working on his farm. He feared that if the continual influx from tb* opposite side of tbe reserve waa oot checked a portion of his crop weald be destroyed despite bis efforts to save it. Mr. A. Payne also sapnorted the motion, and considered that in datricta wben rabbits an numerous the dog tax should not ha en forced, for than farmers might toepaaaeadam for tie purpose of kilting the pasts. Mr. Hoff man concurred. The motion was put, and carried unanisooaaly. Mr. Boyal proposed "That a deputation be appointed to wait upon the Hon. the Oommissioner of Orowo Lands urging the necessity off pasting a cosspalsory measure for tbeeztarmittation of cabotta." He said that by that stop those of the member* of the Legislative Council who were instrumental in rejecting the last Babbit Bill would be able to sea that tbe course they adopted waa wrong, aad that if the farming interest was to be protected and simnltsneons action was naoes sary to exterminate the evil. Mr. Payne seconded the motion, which was carried unani mously. Twelve genttamen were appointed by the meeting to form the deputation. A meeting for tbe purpose of supporting the Government in constructing a railway into the Hills by the cheapest and best route is to be held at Nairne this evening. Persons desirous of supporting or oppos ing tbe Government proposal for taxation are invited to attend a meeting at tbe Alma Council Chamber this evening. Bainford'e Ghost Company met witi a very discouraging receptioa on Tuesday evening, at White's Booms, there being only about 100 ' p—"■?« present. The programme was tbere | fore slightly curtailed. i The annual meeting of the South Ade ! laide Cricket Club was held in the Draper ; Memorial Schoolroom on Tuesday evening, \ September 3. There were present about 20 snembers, and Mr. B. Crouch, sen,occupied the { chair. The following offioers were elected for l the Misning season: —President, Mr. B. Cooke, j MJ.; Vice-Presidents. Messrs. B.Crouch, sea., | 8. Allen, J. A.BUery, W. Holland, Q. Calyer, ; W. Sketbeway, and Blades; Secretary aad Trea surer, G. Sharp; Captain, Mr. T. M. Cole; Com mittee, Messrs. Cole, Usher, Sharp, Kingston, j Thurgarland, Wallace, Jones, and Doonell; j Association Delegates, Messrs. Kingston and GartrelL It was resolved that the proposed | alteration of the constitution of tie Association ! should be leftto the discretion of the Delegates. I Several new mwnhm were elected. These was a very fair attendance at the Theatre Boyal on Tuesday evening, September 3, when the favorite old Adelphi faice of " The Spitalfields Weaver " and Mr. Famie's musical extz&Tagansa;''Nemesis" were putoathe beards. In tie farce Mr. Owen made a very com mendable fliwunniuii^ and Mr. Beyaolds was I efficient as Brown, while Miss Knight acted : with Tpneh archness and taste as Adelle. I "Nemesis" is an adaptation of a French ' vaudeville, "Lbs Deux Noces de Boisjole," | and smacks strongly of the Palais Boyal and the Arnhign Comique. The fun of the piece turns on the love adventures of one Oalino, a thorough of the Tsi tin Quarter, who is always on tie verge of bigamy. There are the rival brides and rival fathers-in-law, and numerous other personages, who fall out and Misunderstand each other in the most perplexing way. Mi&6Hbwarde confirmed the favorable impression eke had f^ft in v Ivanhoe * by h«* acting and smging as fiosalie, and Miss Fischer —*?g pleasingly as her rival, Pauline. Mr. Owen and. Mr. Martin, as the irate fathers-in-law, were of course in tensely funny, and tbe former was encored for his ■*wi^**«"g of an fffluffing topical song. Zidore, tie friend of Catino, w£o finally is the AlATMijlgr who unties tie knot of his matri monial difficulties, was very nicely played by Miss Knight, and she well deserved the encore she obtained for her graceful and agQe dMirjng, Mr. Beynolds acted with « rin* lucalfiss Oalino, and sang witi taste and expression; and Miss Grace Hatiaway produced gniirJi amnsement bm a {adorn virgin of forty summers. The music is bright and sparkling, and there is plenty of fun and bustle in "Neme?s." but last night it waa somewhat too much prolonged for enjoyment. This defect will, however, doubtless be remedied to-night. ♦
