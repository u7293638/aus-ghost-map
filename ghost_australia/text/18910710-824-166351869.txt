An ingenious New Yorker with a wife who insisted upon wicker rockers with dainty head rests, and small tables with blue china, and who frequently had to get up at nights for the paregoric, went out one morning after a night's groping for the match box, and brought home a pot of phosphorescent paint, which he daubed on all corners, points, and edges of" those darling little rockers and sweet tables, decorating the match-box and bed-posts, the gas bracket and door knobs, determined upon avoiding the shoals and wreckages of the midnight cruise. And now at night the room looks like the ghost scenes from " The Flying Dutchman." The phosphor escence gathers light all day and lets it loose all night. Madame Richard was singing "Le Prophete" in London recently, and was just commencing her anathema of " Les murs d'un cachot," when , a wall of the prison obligingly fell across the footlights and opened up an un expected way of safety. The stage hands raised their mellifluous voices, another wall showed signs of collapse, and Madame Richard turned and fled. The curtain came down, but after a decent interval it rose again, the flats were " jined," and after midnight the opera ended.
