Kergunyah. j The concert and ball held at Ker gunyah on Friday last was about the most successful experienced for a considerable time. The school room was well filled for the concert, and afterwards the accommodation was considerably taxed by the lovers of terpsichore. Mr. M'Conochie acted as chairman at the concert, and it is needless to remark that he fulfilled, his onerous duties to the satisfaction of all. The singers who acquitted themselves creditably were Miss ®ri£gs, Mr Keegan, and Mr Murray, whilst Miss Brown gave a humorous J recitation in good style. The musical j portion of the entertainment was not the success it might have been, as there were oneortwodisappointments besides which most of the singers were suffering from severe colds. Mr. Loftus, of Sandy Creek, was absent on account of the illness ot his mother. The want of a piano for accompaniment purposes was also j felt. The farces, ot which there 1 were five, weie successfully carried I out, Messrs Murray, Roxby, Hadley, and Barnes taking part therein. The first farce was ' Buying an elephant' which caused no small amount. o£ amusement. Then followed two or three other short scenes, the whole entertainment being brought to a close by a farce entitled 'The Ghost.' j The ball was a most enjoyable one, j music beina: supplied by Mr Thornley, j and another local fiddler whose name ? we could not ascertain, and Mr T. j Barnes on the symphonium. Re- : freshments were provided by the ladies, and after a short interval ! dancing was resumed and continued i till daylight. The proceeds of the i concert and ball were in aid of the 1 Cricket Club, and sufficient money | was raised to place the club in a i good position.
