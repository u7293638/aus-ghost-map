Mr. Florestan came in a meteor-like manner at the beginning of last week : took tea with mother on Tuesday afternoon while I waa miles and miles up the river with Cyril, yawning myself to death over a silly novel, while he threw his fly for trout, and seemed to do nothing but entangle his line in the willows. When I went down to dinner that' evening mother informed me that Mr. Florestan had done me the honor to inquire about my health-as if I were ever ill!-and, farthermore, that he was to leave Fountainhead early next morning on his way to Scotland/where he was to spend the whole of August and Sep tember.

Mother had.mis understood him about the date ot hjs journeyer, else he-had changed bis mind. : At - any rate he. had only gone to, London to. see about guns- and fishing, tackle for the autumn ; and there,he was yesterday ^ morning at ll o'clock coming suddenly between me and the light, as I sat reading alone in the summer-house in the shrubbery. Cyril bad left us by an ¡ early train for a two* days' visit to a Manor House near Guildford, in religious observance of one of those college friend ships which. young-men esteem so highly.^ His friend had telegraphed to him urgently, "Come," and he went;, having carefully ascertained first that I did not mind. .

In.the midst of ijhese vain and foolish dreams, he whose image had mixed.itself with all of them, stood , suddenly before, me. . 1 looked up and saw-him standing there, mute and serious. My guilty, conscience sent the blood up to my lace in a great waye.of crimson. I could not speak, nor I think could .be just at first. ¡'I thought you were in Scotland," I said, at last,, and I really felt as if it was a brilliant re mark. '.
