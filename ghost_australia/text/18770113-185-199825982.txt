THE REFORM AND THE TRUNK LEAD COM PANIES, HADDON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR. — Yours, &c.;, INDEX. 11th January. SIR, —The writer of the letter in to-day’s Star over the signature “ Suum Cuique"—which I will inform him means “To each his own,” for I doubt his own knowledge of the meaning—says he has “too high an appreciation of Sir Rogerson’s services to consent to any reduction in hia' salary.” Sir, I. believe him; services rendered to himself .of course; he cannot surely mean to the company,- v Your correspondent further says, “ Mr Rogerson ably-dischargea the joint duties-of legal and mining-manager.” -My answer to that as sertion Is,-that “ Suum Guique.” is quite incapable-of judging.- But- why ■ did. he- >not. ; inform you ,that Thomas had three shafts, to, Jijok after and Rogerson only one ? Where* is the_econoihy nb w ? As for the remainder of hisdetter,.few,Collins street orrsnd boys would have written.such stuff, and I doubt very much whether t . the author—X. don’t say the writet— has even the ghost -of ft scrip in the world.-
