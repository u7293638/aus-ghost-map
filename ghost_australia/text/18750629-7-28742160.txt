To believe some statisticians, the increase in the consumption of tobacco is mathematically proportioned to the aug mentation of the cases of I insanity. Hence the war against nicotine. It is a fact that the tobacco which produces vertigo and aiakness is that containing the least percentage of nicotine; for example, the Lmdrii cigar has but 1 per cent., of nicotine., and Turkish tobacco less, yet both affect the head, the heart, and the stomach of many. It is the par fame, the aroma, the ««?nn*j«i oils that do the mischief, and to which one must become aeoastomed, as eels to be skinned. TTxe case bf a sitlpker being killed by nicotine is as rare as a man disappearing by spontaneous combustion. ' Itrequires no ghost to prove the rapid revival of trade and commerce in Paris.. There is a marked increase in the number of those shops devoted to the sale of the delica?Jes of season, as wall ** of ■ Warerooms devoted to new furniture, the ,laf ter of very beautiful a&d; rare designs; In industrial arVlae French are becoming more and moia incomparable. .. This re mark does not apply to pictures, which, however, are largely produced, like razors, to sell tosoidtasen who barte their ofiers on the average price of room paper. A lady once observed to saa " A ture?ign of prosperity of a people w not tlone in the number of its milliner's shops, bat in the variety of the shapes, Ac., > exposed." Judged by this standard, Paris must be the most thriving pUb^ia'the' world., ,A leu testhetical index a that! daily before my eyes ; the number of barges and tugboats that ascend and descend: the tive| laden with cargo is dorible 'what it was but year. The lilac has nearly gone ; aching of beauty is not in every case a joy for ever. To this succeeds those pretty flowers,',of young girts dressed in white, engaged in the duties of confirmation; they are more numerous this year also. People perhaps are becoming more devout; if «o, so much the better; or the population is increasing, which also merits felicity. Not only the races, but the concerts in the Champa ElyoSes, are capital places for ib«asuring the well-being ot^ari?. Both, as the omnibuses signal, are ay complei. Theeoncert in^ueaiionisstill traditionally correct; no black sheep are ever allowed to enter there; it is not that ladies are called upon to show their marriage certificates before being admitted, bnt there is a janitor at the gate, whose judgment never fails in drawing the line between virtue and vice, and who has served hia apprenticeship at the Jardin MoblHe—the beat of diplomas. The annual fete of Jeanne d'Arc has been celebrated withail honors at Orleans, and the selected preacher demanded from bis hearers to have only the simple faith of *he Maid—for her country and for hferQod. Something ought to be done tb make the Bishop of the diocese move more quickly in completing the pre liminaries for her canonisation. Mgr.
