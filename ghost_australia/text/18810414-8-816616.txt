LUMINOUS FUNGUS. (25 the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.) Sir-Your correspondent Mr. Plumb mentions a luminous fungus of the species Agaricus. I have not had the pleasure of seeing a luminous Agaricus, or mushroom, but I have seen in the Brisbane Water district highly luminous laminated fungi, growing from trees and old stumps, like a number of brackets, one above another, tier upon tier, upon the south or sunless side of the tree or stump. One of these the size of a man's hand will give light enough to read a newspaper by, or to tell a person's features when held close to the face. Seen in the brushes at night, the butts of some trees up to a height of six or eight feet look like columns of pale fire, strange and un- earthly from its motionless nature. The luminosity is present in certain conditions of the atmosphere only, and not ordinarily. JOHN SHAW. St. Paul's, W. Maitland.
