OUT IN THE SNOW. — Louise Chandler Moulton. Snow and silence came down together, Through the night so white and so still, And young folks, housed from the bitter weather — Housed from the storm and the chill — Heard in their dreams the sleigh-bells jingle, Coasted the hillsides under the moon, Felt their cheeks with the keen air tingle, Skimmed the ice with their steel-clad shoon They saw the snow when they rose in the morning, Glittering ghost of the vanished night, Though the sun shone clear in the winter dawning, And the day with a frosty pomp was bright Out in the clear cold winter weather — Out in the winter air like wine — Kate with her dancing scarlet feather, Bess with her peacock plumage fine. Joe and Jack with their pealing laughter, Frank and Tom with their gay hallo, And half a score of roisterers after, Out in the witching, wonderful snow Shivering grey beards shuffle and stumble, Righting themselves with a frozen frown, Grumbling at every snowy tumble — But young folks know why the snow came down. — Louise Chandler Moulton.
