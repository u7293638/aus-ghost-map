The other morn ing he and Evan Williamswere eating break fast, when, by a preconcerted 4greement, they began s dialogue something like this, Sam leading off " Curious, ain't it, that Sullivan took water from that Dutchman ? " " Yes, indeed ; I was quite astonished. He seemed perfectly cowed." , " Well, I don't bhlme him. Hens is a big tnan and strong as a bull, and I guess he can lick any two men in the world, John in cluded." "Phat's that, Mister Jones ? " broke in the domestic, who had been hovering about the table, "a Dutchman link John" Sllivant Are yez crazy or dreaming, Mister Jones?" " It's a fact," said Williams. "Hans â€¢ "Meyor, forman of the No. 2 orosscut, Grown,' Point, deposited 500 dole. forfeit to meet Sullivan, and when he saw our man he weak-, ened and let the money slide." The domestic dropped a china plate on the floor, and stood speechless. " He breaks all his rook with his fiat," broke in Sam, "and runs the steam drillb7 hand. We pay him 12 dole. a day just for the steam he saves. Sullivan happened to come in when he was making birdseye porphyry with his fist, and I'm blamed if he didn't turn pale as a ghost." "Mr. Jones, if Mr. Evan Williams says this I'd belave him, but as you say so it wouldn't go. There must be some miahtake about bia bein' a Dutchman." "He is a .Dutchman," said Williams., gravely, "or else I don't know a Dutchmani when I see him." " Thin, gintlemen," replied the domestio, drawing herself up a couple of inches highe, "all l've got to say is that John L. Sullivan'. no Irishman, and don't spake of him as one in my prisence."-O-0oron (Ne.) A peal.
