THE LATE FATAL ACCIDENT AT THE RAILWAY PIER. The. Rev. R. Rogers. preached an -impressive .sermon to a numerous audience on Sunday even ing last, in the United Methodist Free Church, Williamstown, with special reference to the young man who was drowned on the previous Sunday night. , The following is the substance of the reverend gentleman's discourse, .the .text ,being from the 2nd Samunnel, 18th chap.; and 32nd verse, "Is.the young man Absalom- safe.':- - " The young man of whom this anxious 'question was asked,.was the third son of. David, king of Israiel, ind heiiipresumptive to the throne. He ws comely'in his werattrctive in his ad 'dress, wicked in his condiuct, aiid tirgic in his death. The learhed Calmet says of him, " He was ,a bold, violent, revengeful, haughty, enter prising, magnificent, eloquent and.popularprince; he was also rich, ambitious, and vain of hisper sonalacco niplishifents." 'Absildoni fixed his heart upon tlihegal bower-tdo which he 'saw no hitid rance-after the death of his brother Ainmoh' and for.this'purpose.he maiutaineda large estab lishment, sought the hearts of his father's people, and attempted by n exteinsiv; rebellion to take 'thi crown from his pareint's irow arld thdeoccptre frmin his'hand.
