TOLD BY A DEAN. A well-known Dean nw deceased was in the' habit of telling" the following humorous story : A couple of frogs-one' a pessimist, the other an optimist-took a stroll into the country, and in the course of their pere grinations came to a dairy, On the floor of the dairy were some pans of cream, into which the frogasfell. The pessimist swam and struggled and struggled and swam, but was unable to get out, so he gave up the ghost. The optimist, too, swam and struggled. But, unlike his fellow.unfortunate, he kept a good heart, and swam and struggled and struggled and swam until at last through his exertions the cream was churned into butter, and he sat on top of it !
