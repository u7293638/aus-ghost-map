SCI;ARENCEF TOWN. Our highly respected townsman, William Johnston; Esq., J.P., and late mAmber of the Williams, has at lash consented to take his stand as a:candidate for the county of Glouces~er,' aftec a great deal of persuasion from his numerous friends. Those who ought to know something of affairs state with confidence that the other candidates, although being in the field long before him, will not' have a ghost of a chance, now that lie has come out. We congratulate the citizens of .New castle upon ;the good taste and common sense exemplified by them in electing two respectablegenrlemen of meritorious worth to represent them in the new Parliamont. Surely the proud and often vaunted elec torate ofEast Sydney must for the future take a back'~place in the.standard of honourable, and relinquish her laurels in favour of Newcastle, as far as reputation is concerned. Mu. H.. H.aBRowN, as many of your readers are aware, has quietly been re turned for Durham. fe seems to be very popular throughout this electorate, which, to a great:measure,' accountns for no opposi tion candidat :with sufficient courage to contest thollectiozi with him. Tar. WEATauER.--Vo are having beauti ful weather here, blessed with refreshing showers, day after day, intervened with warm sunny hours, which forces everything to grow luxuriously. The grass will soon be up to our knees. Indeed everything portends to a plenteous season. 8th December, 1882.
