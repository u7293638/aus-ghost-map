Alone With Conscience. I eat alone with my conscience, In a place where time bad ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I should have to answer The question it put to me, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face— Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thou'hi of a-far-away warning, Of a sorrow (hat was to be mine, In a alnd that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking, Of the judgment day to be, But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave; But no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past iife Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming,. And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday." And I pray I may not forget it, In this land before the grave,. That I may not cry in the future. And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson. Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learnt it by dr«aming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with uiy conscience, In the place where the years increaie, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soever it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will bo judgment enough for me. —SPKTATOR.
