TRADE AND PINANCE. Yesterday was another quiet day, both in financial and trading circles. The various bunks were making about an average turn-over, although it is to be noted that accounts in the banks which have suspended arc daily drifting away to tho leading institutions. Ilcnce it is im portant that the proposed reconstructions should be carried into eii'ect as rapidly as possible. At present only the Commercial of Australia lias completed its arrange ments, and it is to be hoped that the other suspended banks will push forward their plans somewhat faster than has as yet appeared to be the case. Yesterday Sir George Dibbs proposed to move the suspension ol the stand ing orders in the Legislative Assembly to permit the passing of tho Bank Issue Bill without delay. It is evident ; that the measure has not mot with ' general approval, either here or in I England, where the faulty character of the j basis accorded to the legal tenders was at | once recognised aud commented upou. As j it stands the bill will empower the Go- < vernuieut to declare the notes of any bank legal tender up to the amount of its re serve fund, except in Sydney itself, where gold can be demanded for them ; but it does not require the banks to retain the requisite supplies of gold, aud the possi bility might arise— though it is impro bable—that the gold might not be forth coming. In such an eventuality gold would go to a premium. We do not be lieve that this undesirable outcome is at ail likely to arise. The banks are too care fully managed. But the community will be trusting to the good sense of the banks to keep legislation within judicious bounds, not to legislation to keep the banks straight, and this is a remark able inversion of tlio rightful positions of tlio legislators and " the legis lated." It has beeu suggested by some bankers that a proportion of the securities held in the colony (say one- eighth) should be taken as the limit of an issue of legal tenders. Such a limit would be more stable than the average reserve fund in times like_ these, and it would empower a bank to issue notes according to its standing in the colony. But it is a faulty limit all the same. A bank might have the bulk of its securities locked up in laud, and sucli a lock-up is 110 adequate safeguard for a note payable on demand. Tiie French found thut out when they issued their assignats. We have expressed the view that the only proper basis for a legal tender is gold, plus a proportion of Government securities, which could bo realised in case of emergency, and we have done so because it is desirable, especially at a time like this, to show the world that tho position of the legal tender is im pregnable. It would be a material dis advantage if events were to happen which should raise tlio ghost of a suspicion that the legal tender might he depreciated. It may be interesting to furnish a short description of the Canadian legal tender currency at tjie present time. Canada has 110 gold currency of her own, the American eagle beiug a legal tender for $10 aud tho sovereign at $4'86|. Canada, however, has her own silver cur rency of 50, 25, 20, .10, and 5 cent pieces and a bronze 1 eont, all of which she orders to be struck 011 her account in England. The chartered bauks do a con siderable business, but the proportions of their deposits payable 011 demand and their discounts are larger than is the cubc here. Their notes are limited to $5 (£1) and multiples, while the Canadian Government issue notes for $4, 2, $1, and 25c. — respectively 16s, 8s, 4s, and Is. Bank notes are a first charge 011 all assets, and bauks are compelled to hold 40 per cent, of their cash re sources in Government notes, and nro further compelled to encash at least 60 per cent, of their notes iu Government notes, if such are de manded. Thus, tho Government legal tenders play a very important part in the currency, and largely displace tho frac tional silver currency. The Government notes in circulation are about £4,000,000, and tho Treasury holds about 20 per cent, of Bpecie against them. Beyond this, tho followiug regulations are enforced : — " The capital stock of any incorporate! bank shall be not less than $500,000 iu shares of $100 each. "Five hundred thousand dollars must ho subscribed, and $250,000 paid to the Minister of Finance, and a certificate of permission obtained from tlio Treasury Board, before business can be commenced. " No dividends or bonus exceeding 8 per cent, per annum bIkiII he paid by any bank, unless, after deducting all bad and doubtful debts, it lias a reserve fund equal to at least 30 per cent, of its paid-up capital. " The amount of notes of any bank in circulation at any time shall not exceed the amount of its unimpaired capital, subject to penalties varying with the amount of such excess. " The payment of notes issued by any bank for circulation shall be the first charge on its assets in ease of insolvency, any amounts due to the Dominion Government shall be the second charge, and any amount I due to any Provincial Government shall be the third charge. " Every bank deposits with tho Minister of Finance a sum equal to 5 pur cent, of tlio average amount of its notes in circulation, such sum to be annually adjusted according to the average amount o! circulation during the preceding 12 months. Such amounts form a fund called ' The Bank Circula tion Redemption Fund,' to be used, when necessary, 011 the suspension of any bank, for the payment of the notes issued and in cir culation and interest. All notes in circula tion shall bear interest at 0 per cent, per annum from tho day of suspension until re deemed. Payments from tlio fluid are to bo without regard to tlio amount contributed. " No bank may lend money 011 its own shares or those of another bank, or upon mortgage of real estate, or 011 the security of any goods, wares, or merchandise except as collateral security. "Except as required for its own use, 110 bank shall hold any real estate for a longer period than seven years. Any rate of in terest may bo charged aud allowed, but not more than 7 per cent, shall be recoverable. " Monthly returns, signed by the chief accountant, the acting president and the manager, shall bo made to the Minister of Finance within tho first 15 days of each month, subject to a penalty of $$0 for each day's delay, such returns to ho made in the form provided by the Act. -Special returns may bo required by the Government at uny time. " No person may use tho title of 'bank,' ' banking company,' ' banking-house,' ' banking association, or ' banking institu tion,' unless authorised by Act of Parlia ment." These regulations are, it will be seen, exceptionally stringent, yet the note issues of the Canadian bunks reach about £5,500,090. The crisis lias had the effect of increas ing the sales of Government 4 per cent. Funded Stock, of which £126,000 has been sold during tho current month. The English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank directors appear to be working 011 tlio plan of making every arrangement with their British creditors before summoning together those in Aus tralia. This would do a comprehensible arrangement if the British depositors were as largo in proportion as they are in tho instances of tlio other banks which luivo ' suspended. But they are not so. The E.S. and A.C. owe under £060,000 in Great Britain, against £2,500,000 in Vic toria and £1,460,000 in New South Wales, and the adhesion of tho Australian depositors is therefore a matter of greater importance to them. The Government Statistician points out that the figures recently published re garding the wool trade of Australasia do nut bear the interpretation which appears to have been put upon them in some quarters. Tho Customs returns of all the colonies show au apparent export of 855,765,9711b., but as part- of tho New South Wales clip is dispatched by way of Victoria and South Australia, aud some Queensland wool reaches the port of ship ment through New South Wales, the trade returns also show an import of wool equal to. 126,070,5591b. weighed in the grease. The net or true report for 1892 was, therefore, the difference between these figures— viz., 729,695,4121b., valued at £24,243,168. These figures wero pub lished iu our issue of 15tli inst. The net export for each colony is given below. It will bo understood tbat tho weight is taken a3 if tho cl in were entirely in grcaso ; Avhero washed or scoured wool was ex ported an equivalent in grease has been allowed : — KKT KXI'OKT OK WOOI,.

Theso : averages agree very avcII with tho ex- i perienec of the colonics named, ami show that the Customs returns as compiled by tho Government Statistician must be very close to tho truth. Some days back tho Australian Mort gage, Land, and Finance Company, Limited, announced a dividend at tho rate of 15 per cent, per annum, as compared , with 20per cent, at this time last year. It was stated at tho meeting that tho com pany had £80,000 on deposit in the Australian banks, including £15,000 in the Australian Joint Stock ; and as there may be possible losses on securities held, it was decided that, pending tho reserve being recouped the amount withdrawn to cover them, tho dividend should not exceed 15 per cent. On 'Change yesterday there wore a fair number of dealings in investment slocks. Amongst, hanking companies there were sales of Bank of New South Wales shares at £50, and for the rest, although there were a fair average of quotations, dealings were limited to Mont do Pietii and Mortgage Guarantee, while the only noticeable change in quota tions was that United Insurance shares were offered at 2s reduction.
