I " A NEW COCK-LANE GHOST. | (From the New York Times, May 3.) p TitLKPhovc recently been doings in Wayne County), Ohio, as marvellous as any) that ever frightened Cotton Mather, or mystified Dr, Johnson In the little city of "N easter there lives a quiet and respectable family, named Hoffman, which for nearly two searches been haunted and tortured by malignant spirits The persistent demands cannot be entreated or exercised ima) and their proceedings bear a Uko CIOBO resemblance to those of divers familiar imps conjured up by modern spiritualists, and to those of the famous Cock Lane Ghost of a century ago the mysterious pranks that afflict the Hoffman family were begun in June, 1868, while the family lived in Millersburg, Holmes County, Ohio At that date by way of keynote of prologue to the vi and drama to come, Mr Hoffman one day lost two dollars from his purse He did not at first attribute this to any Satanic or super- natural agency, although he felt subsequently called on to do so Prudently resolving to hide his money) more carefully in future, he went his way But put his loose cash where he might, die cunning depreda- tors speed it out and relieved him of it The poor man soon found out that it was absolutely impossible to keep an) funds about him at all, and this was only the beginning of his woes Articles of food and of dress began to disappear in the same unaccountable way Crocker) fell from shelves without the aid of human hands and was smashed to pieces Stones, eggs and other small objects were tossed wildly about the house, and now and then the unseen tricksters got up a little shower of gravel and sand, which would be playfully) thrown in the faces of the inmates The family were at first very naturally surprised and annoyed afterwards they got alarmed, and having unsuccessful!) tenderer) means that occurred to them, both to discover the cause of these visitations and to put a stop to them, they resolved to quit their home Mr Hoffman took another house for his wife and three children the latter being aged 20 17, and 15 respected clean the town of Wooster, at some distance from their former abode , while, with the discretion that appears to characterise him, he took up his own temporary quarters at a mill where he was employed His family now hoped to remain unmolested , but he) soon found to their chagrin how trivial were the impediments of space or locality to their matches attendants The prudent Hoffman, indeed, escaped further attentions , but his spouse was less fortunate that lady and her offspring being domiciled at the house of one Snooks in West Liberty) street, Wooster, now became the victims of an extraordinary series of prosecutions the clothes of the mother and eldest daughter were first abstracted and then returned in fragments, having been cut and slashed to pieces Sometimes the garments would be Stuffed in out of the way places One day, for example, most of the linen of adelaide was discovered carefully packed in the mouth of the cellar dram Another time a silk dress was found under a wood pile and skirts were dug up that had been deliberately buried in earth or sand A fresh feature was now added to the entertainment, in the shape of notes that arrived, none knew from whence, although they some- time appeared to be thrown from the cellar These missives contained various threats and admonitions One of the number advised Mrs Hoffman, in a friendly way, that if she would come down the cellar stairs backward on her knees, at a specified day and hour, she would find a box containing 2000 dollars The worthy lady was anxious to clutch the glittering prize, but, being afraid of bodily injury, was dis BHoded by neighbours from making the hazardous attempt It occurred to her, not unreasonable), that the task might he more wisely undertaken by her husband and she therefore repaired to that cautious person at his mill, and induced him to go with her to Wooster The spirits, however, at this juncture, promptly transmitted another note to the effect that no one could possibly get the money but herself, and we are not surprised to hear by the latest accounts that it has not yet been secured B) way of amends for this disappointment, the concealed powers have begun a new and lively round of diversions Poundings are heard on the walls at night, stones from the size of pebbles to that of a man s fist are pitched through the doors and window B, dishes rattle, and " a general rumpus is created, as if mines were holding high revel) ' A bold young man, a visitor, having said something disrespectful of the unseen agencies, a red hot stone was dropped on his head and on taking out his pocket handkerchief, he found it was cut into shreds All sorts of modifications are practised Mr Hoffman, for instance, answered one of the spirit notes, and put his reply in the cellar, but just as he got up stairs into the room above his own note dropped on the floor by his side-all his family being present " The family are now quite impoverished by the thefts and other ravages of their demoniac tormentors MTB Hoffman and her daughters have no clothes Save those worn by them daily on their backs , while the husband and father has only a single worn old working suit left to him Nearly all the domestic utensils, such as plates, cups and saucers, and even the table cutlery, have been either broken or carried away Of course, the obvious suggestion is that all this mischief has really been wrought by cunning mortals, and not by spirits at all, and that, as with the artful William Parsons and his family in 1761, discovery, if long averted, must be certain at last The local press declares that most careful watch has been kept, and that hundreds of men and women have visited and inspected without being able to suggest any clue to the mystery Several clergymen and physicians have investigated it, and a circle of professed spiritualists have likewise essayed to do so, As yet no light whatever has been thrown on the, matter, and, so far as the postponement of detection goes, this Ohio ghost must certainly be allowed to surpass in cunning his predecessor of Cockrane, who so marvellously perplexed the wise heads of last coats, tury' _Â«_____^_______
