FOOTBALL GOSSIP. BY PUNT Never in the history of football in Ballarat did a season open under more auspicious circumstances than the present one Hitherto one or other of the clubs has shown itself so supeuor to its iiaals that it did not reqmie a great amo mt of judgment to spot the piemicr club foi the season But this season promises to produce a senes of surpnses in oui local in itches The season opened with a close and exciting finish botw een the B and laiat and Ballai at Impend, on which it was almost imposoible to say victoiy would rest with until the tinkle of the hell, which h uled the weareis of the tn color victors by thiee goals to two Then followed the exciting match between the South and Imperial on the Eastern Oval, for which the South weie made such warm favontes Veiyfew out side the ranks of the tncoloi cnele would have the temerity to dispute the superiouty of the South to the Imperial Yet in the face of the successful caieei of the South and then appnent nn nicibility, I w is the only critic bold enough to say the South of last year and the South of this year weie vastly different, and g vve it is my opinion that man to man, the Impeli il was i superior team, and if the “ pot did not boil over,” I would be very much siupused 1 hat the pot did not completely boil over on that occasion the Impelnilists have them selv es to blame ow nag to leav mg their places to jom m the general jncler which ch aiactensed the list quarter’s play Then, again, on Saturday, whin the weareis of the “ led ami w lute” f iced the South, the issue w is looked upon as a foregone conclusion— the Ballarat had not the ghost of a show 1 w ooi three go ils w ei e offoi ed freely against the Ballnat, md suppoitersof the “ led and w lute” w ere fv en shy of those liberal odds It was thought by many that the Ballai at could not stay, md that m the list h vlf they would he quite at the mcicy of last yen’s premiers Not being influenced by even a lulf mown wager and hiving no mteicst m either club, beyond a d»sne to nnpiovo the game, I did not sh ne m these opinions I have watched both te mis at prvctice and m in itches, and the conclusion I ai lived at vv is that the B vllarat te nn was not inferior to the South individually, but m playing together, playing an uuselhsh winning game, the “ led and blue” were undoubtedly supeuor to the Ballarat As to the st lying powers of the B illai at, I had no doubt v hatever, and I stated m my contiilmtioii of Finlay- that if I were convinced that Ballarat would play together—pi ay after the unselfish mannei of the South—l would not hesitate one moment in my choice Hie Ballai at team did play together—play as I have never seen them play—and the lesnlt must have convinced them (if my feeble effort-, failed) of the sm cidaT nature of their pi iv m the past It is not my intention to entei fully into Satin diy ’splay—l will leave that duty to yom representative The winning of the toss give the South the advantage of the wind, which did not av ail them much, ns no sooner w as the hall sent to the Ballaiat goal than it vvas speedily- returned by the reliable Bal lar at h acks, who wei o oa cr there w hen w anted The game was fast and rough fiom start to finish, and although Mi ihewlisb, m a stuct and impiitnal m innci, eude aaored to carry out the i nles of the game, his efloi ts wi re not always successful, chiefly owing to somepliyeis, who at times lost then tempera and mdnlgid m imiglmess that m calmer moments they would never diearn of There was some giand play, however, notwith standing some imneeessny roughness To J Hogg, of the South Ball irat, I must give pride of place, foi Ins play from stilt to innsh was a treat worth witnessing His elicits weie ihly seconded by lobiT and Cle ary, w ho shone out conspicuously amoiigat the South contingent Qnmn and Nleholls, too, did some ’good work, but the play of m any otheis was lather disappoint mg, and the South captain will certainly have to mike some eh mges Among the small but stnidy lot theie ue some weak spots, winch cannot have escaped such a keen oboervei as Hogg, and no doubt he will speedily lemoae them The roapponauee of Reece Bodyeomhe on the football arena affmded much s itisf action, and theie can be n> doubt th at his appe n nice alone, to say nothing of the cxcellt nt service he icndeied his side, put moie th an the oidmviy amount of pluck into the weareis of the “ted md white ’ The B ill irat to am pi ay ed such an unusually good game that I haidly like to single out any p articnl ai pi ly eras desci a mg of special mention,
