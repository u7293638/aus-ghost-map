TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1886. If Mr. SERVICE could take an oppor- tunity of saying a few last words as to the finances of the colony, it would be well. Or a memorandum handed to the press might be of use. Some extra- ordinary misconceptions are abroad, and the most is likely to be made of them during the approaching contests. Mr. GILLIES was unfortunate in the way he stated his case as Echuca, for he felt called upon to draw a comparison be- tween the expenditure of the pre- sent year and that of the year 1881, and to include in the expenditure of 1885-6 a number of recoups, which nie mere bookkeeping items, snelling the appai ent tot al enormously Tho noun »al exi>cn.ditnro of the yew is nearly £7,000,000, and the leal oulla) from revenue is only a little o\cr £6,000,001) And of courso in examining the growth of the expenditure, no should toko the year with which Mi Su MI i stilted, ind not two yeal s befoie, tlmt is to say, lbS*. and not 1881 As Mr Ginns made an error, it is not von derful that the ladicil oiatois aie bur lesqmug it-aie piling on the agon) Consequent upon this pi ocedm e, no shall soon have a good many people as sum nig that Mi SERVII J , as a ni ittcr ol fact, actually mci eased the nation ii cxpeiiditmo by ¿61,500,000 pel annum -just as there aio candidates x\ho lie gom¿ about repeating an a^seition which they father, lightly or wiont,]), upon Mr Mm VMM, that tho countr) is spending £07,000 per annum on (joveinment-house No fiction is too outiageous for election purposes, ^o could o illato figuies which would'.how tlie .issumption that Mi .LRUei in creased tho expendituio fioni taxes by ¿l,r>00,000, or by ¿1,000,000, or by _L)00,000 per annum, to be utteil) euoneous, but it is bettor for the statement to be official V> li it li is happened is that the reieimo In' llounshed, and that, as a mutta ol com se, tlieïieasuiei has spent it b) In) lngitoiitlothebestadiantage Jiuttliiia has been no increase of taxation dm mg the pact ino jeara, foi if tho spins duties ha^o been added to, Sir HM ^ OLoouLi x peimitted the beei duty to expne And it maybe ínterestin.,'to note that Mi Si R\ ICL closed his financial ?\eais in each instance with a sur plus - Cn .plui 1RS! lib. 112 IbM It I m 1S>. II I 000 And a Iieasuier following upon the Sei vice lines will probably lia\e a surplus in 1886 We may bo quito suie that the Prcnnci himself ^°uld have ended with a ciedit balance on the 30th of June next. Extraiagunce consists of i tinning mt" debt Lconomy consists m 1 ecpuig within bounds, and in spending Hie money wisely and well-in getting full Tlue foi tho outlay It is not wi.t lor any 'lieasurer to lay up a laigo sin pi t? An extiavngant successor will assuredly utilise the fund íor his own emla, aud besides, os Mr. DEAKIN justly argue*, there ere always public -works m a new country such as this, on which money can be spent with the utmost ad vantage. Our opportunities are only restricted by oui means. W7hen the chance occurs for Bpendmg ?with more than usual liberality on public works, it should be judiciously availed of, and when the means fade away the additional outlay can and must end also The underlying idea of the financial critics of the day is that when the revenue is elastic the Irea surer should hoard, but the claims of important public works aio so gieat, the pressure on their behalf is so stiong, that, even if hoarding were AVISO, still that couise, as a matter of practical politics, is to be described as un possible What we havo to look to under such circumstances is that the lreasurer does not add to the permanent etpenditurc of the country -that which cannot bo reduced Avith out a dismissal of olhcers and a reveisal of policy The permanent expendituio on the defence force has been mci eased, no doubt, of lato, but AVO must credit the Government AA ith repressing enthusiasm, and with keeping the outlay in moderate bounds, m ordci to lessen the inevitable recoil, and the certain aftercharge of extravagance, with an accompanying clamoui for reductions As it is, any cutting down piojects can be resisted as sure to lead to costly panics m tlie futuie The salaries of the liailwaj Commissioners nnd the Public f-ervice Commissioners will bo amm adverted upon, no doubt, but common sense will tell the public that where pounds are spent in these cases, lura ttieds are saved Tor the rest, tho additional revenues which prosperity biought the ben ice GoAeinment has been wisel) used in votes that could bo discontinued should the receipts fall oil again The bat- teries and forts at the Heads foi instance, are piecisely that class of woiks which should be proceeded with v/hon moneA is abundant Then, when dull times occm, the tisk has been done, or nearly done and tho special outlaA eithei diminishes or ceasps f-o with mining piospecting Tho Service Government spent twice as much per innum m this duection as did any of its predecebsors If we have the money to spare, well and good If otherwise, Ave can drop back upon tho uoimai oulla) Tho heavy votes to countiy watei trusts constitute another item of this class It is a pleastuo to voto such money out of abundauce A temporary suiplns could not be better applied But, of couise, if the revenue were to contract foi a tuno the countiy districts could not look for the assist- ance during the period in question, but Avould require to hire such capital as they needed The ciy of bid financing and of ev-tiavagance ceitaiuly comes Avith an ill grace from those who i aise it It is another [illustration of impudenco in certain quartet 3 iheso critics should kindly recall vvhat happened Avhen then party, with its cuuous financial ideas, had charge of the Treasuiy, but as it is hardly piobable that the. will trouble themselves with the task, it may be well if we mention the disagiecablo facts ourselves as a waining to the counuy ]\Ir 13i URY took olhce with a suiplus of £200,000 That nil vanished Aovv taxes wete imposed right and loft The land ta\, the taiiff taxes (1877), tile tariff taxes (1679), the stamp ta\, the tobacco taxes, the ) i o tem beei taxes, do not exhaust the list And such ignominious efforts as tho wattle bark tax and tho redgum tax need not bo dwelt upon, as, after doing a Avorld of mischief, they had to be re pealed Put the net result was, that neal tho end of his term of oihco the íadical Ircasuier had to announce a deficit of £1,000,000, and half a million of monej had to bo borrowed m the local maiket m older to meet current expenses When the country looks upou this picture and upon that, it has every reason to bo content with tho financing of tho constitutional leader, and its net result of a suiplus at the close of every j ear Hie " living sacrifice of a child to a delusion shaied in by its mother and sisters is a revolting incident, which might a few j ears ago hav e been siniplj classed with the freal s of dangeious lunatics, who manage to remain at largo because unsuspected But tho gi owing political and social influence of people suftenng from acute ldiopatluc mama-or the increase of acute ldio pathic mania among people of political and social influence-makes it unsafe to lgnoie such incidents altogether It is pet hap. advisable to study instead the true bearings tf the Coburg tiagedv, so as to forecast what the people sußering under ncuto ldiopathic mama are likely to do to ns bj and by , m fact, whenever the) slightl) out numbei tho remainder of their unfor túnate fellow citizens One of the most staitliug discovenes on tho very threshold of this investiga tion is that, judging by tho canons ot cnminal inrisprudenco laid down b) some medical authorities, the vvietched mother and dau0hteis at Cobuig vieio not íeally mote insano than some of their betters Di I UKI, who is an acknowledged exueit, tells us that Hie renl distinction betuecn religious mama and religious enthusiastic excitement consists not in tho form ot the ide is for which parallels mi"ht be found in sunny nnd msniiiti-but in the . n mltiui manner in which it ia sought to cuni those liena into action m the leaving out ot

"gioups' of reformers in this colony say that it is no harm to rob a bad man. moieover, when their talking and writing men address the public, how often do thev tell the truth, if a fib will help "the causeV ' The link" which, from ür 'PURL'S point of view, pi events the sane religious enthusiast from committing murder-the " precept " of Ins faith," which, unless insanely lost sight of, nover could allow him to commit murder- is the sixth command mont Does habitual contempt for the eighth commandment, or, again, for the impending lake which buiueth with fire, ¿te, indicate acute ldiopathic inania or notl We should be sorry to dogmatise on the deplorable tragedy which has shocked and bonified so many Melbourne citizens The obscure and long de bated topic of tho responsibility of the half insane before the law appears to bo again mulei discussion at home Theio has long been a re action against the easy immunity which at one timo was gia ited to malefactors m Great -jiitam (and to a far moie scandalou« extent m the United States) who could get a medical expert to swear that they weie not quite sane. Lord Bil _uw ELL has published m a lecont English magazine some views on the treatment of caminal lunatics, which would have been considered brutal a few years ago The matter of fact report of the delusions entertained by the unhappy family at Coburg, which has been furnished to the Melbourne press by one of the medical men in attendance, throws no new light on the matter Hie daugliteis seemed to have devoured all the sensational and semi indecent lubbish printed by the sensational and semi indecent Melbourne news papers nowaday s, and they went cra?y on that subject, as other people with a similar hereditary tendency have gone cra?y about geneial elections, or l.uio pean wai s, or great public calamities Tho poor creatures beluned that "for " many months they had all been under " the eontiol of a seciet influence, the " nature of which they were unable to " define with any accuracy The in " fluenco was that of a secret society, " posbosing many and powerful mein " bers, w ho fui

this Coburg business One of our coiitemporanes, we perceive, attempts to deduce somo useful lo.sons from the tiagedy applicable to eui rent tópico " There is," it says, " no dwel " ling place foi the
