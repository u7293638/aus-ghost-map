THE FIEST SPIiRXT. Mrs 3Foye here requested perfect silence •for a few-momentsj-to enable the ghostly procession ; to find -its way into the lmll. The audicnce had,not long to wait. As. has been said, for-some Teason oroiher^ the spirits are partLeulaTlyhvelyatpresettt, ' and in a few momenta, they came trooping mto the, hall by: platoons, andtlief mediums at: once had'iheir hanlis. full.' Mrs OuinimngSj.a pleasant looting hitlq woman m a straw •>.bonnet . witji-puik nbbons, was the firstto get under control. She said that one of ;her spirit guides ;W£S present; ^ho ?was:puttuig-into vherimouth: a piece of poetry • to j recite, which she fi once proceeded to dom a creditable manner.: After that she said the spirit of a lady had appeared slandin? by a :gentl«- man in the audience. She said the gentle-. 1 man was her son, and she called his nam Henry. The gentleman turned an ashy palor, and his iron-gray hau: stood up on end as he .faltennglv admitted: that ;his name was .Henry. . . He .was a stranger to the mediumi'and this was regarded as : AK EXCELlBNT TEST. Some on* m the audience liere inquired if Sirs Cummin53 could not make the test more complete, by describing. the spirit. Ihe lady said she -could not, but another iady medium popped ap and said die could. She did so, and "Henry'!, acknowledged that the picture was sperfeot. The same lady also saw several little children, • but * none of these wsis recognised. Mrs Staley, an elderly lady,. who is" said to be a tine medium,-here jumped up and said that there sras a spirit in the room named Frank Stevens, and that ha: died off Cape Hattel-as. ' A gsntlemta in the audience, who^was-said-to have but a slight acquaintance with Mrs Staley,.iustantly recognised the name as belonging to an old friend of Jus, vrho was washed overboard from a' steamer off Oape Hat teras several years ago. The gendeinan had scarcelj 1 - thought of his friend m years and not a soul in California kne^v anything about him, lie said. This was.also considered by Mis. Foye a TeSmatkable AKOrHEK.
