' It is Appointed Unto Man Once to Die.' Western Christian Advocate. i How momentous an event is. death to man t To leave all with whioh he has bo long been familiar ; tojhave done with what has so largely ocoupied his thoughts and influnoed his feelings ; to sever his connec tion with the material world ; to change all for things spiritual — ordinarily the mind can form but a dreamy oonoeption of this wondrous change. The imagination oan paint it but in the faintest colours ; but the Bober judgment tells men the ohange must be great. What, however, gives the ohief significance to this change is the faot that it oloses man's moral probation for a state of eternal retribution. The importance of this fact can be comprehended but in part by any finite mind ; but to such as will give it thought, enough may be comprehended to teaoh all that the ohief end of all should be to make the most of life in preparing for that future. Three great ends should be continually kept in mind — pcurdon, j-urity , and a useful life. All have sinned, and must |be forgiven, or suffer the penalty of God's violated law, which is eternal death. All are corrupt, and must be cleansed, or never see the face of God in peaoe. So by lives of usefulness all must glorify God in their body and spirit, whioh are his, or fail of the heavenly recompense nf reward. Pardon is only through repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; purity through the washing of regeneration and the renew ing of the Holy Ghost ; and a useful life only through a new creation — 'oreated anew in Christ Jesus unto good works.' Reader, are you preparing for this great ohange which is awaiting you ? Have you sought and found forgiveness through the mercy of God in Jesus Christ ? Are you consoious of a purity that will permit you to see the face of God in peace ? Are you glorifying God by a well-ordered life and Godly conversation, thus doing good to all as youhave opportunity ? — Rev. Frederick Merriok, D.D.
