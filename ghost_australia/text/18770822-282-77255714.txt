Cross-examined by Mr, Gould: He had not walked is frith his swag that day from Howe's Valley, ajid if lie told nny person to it was fain;; lie was dressed in private clothes nt the time ; the door -was. shut and the hotuve closed, and then asked hitu Jf any body was iir : they asked him for- a drink of . water, adding; that they bad walked ra tint day from Howe's Valley, hi* mate tflso. add ing t\i?t they were goinp: to walk oir to Maithind. Witness asked defendant if them was: any wood about the place with which a lire conld hte made to boil the billies, and de fendant suggested that they should stop nt K? house, ami he would, make them com fortable nutil morning, when they conld go on comfortably by the train; witness, said they were too bard up to pay their .fares; both wttuess and his mate made defendant believe that they were a couple of travellers from Howe's ?Valley, which is a considerable. distai.ee away ; the swags were not very . targe, and they had only been carried from c Singleton, ont to defendant's premises. "Wit- , uess asked ScUnlon how much the wine was, and. placed Is; into- his hand in payment for it. after which they had departed ; tbe i whole of the _,tatemc_ncs made were .fabrica tions, made with tbe intention of seeing whether Scanlott would sell tbe wine er not. iVhen $can!on produced the wine -witness , did not snatch the buttle up, throw a shilling on the table, and then leave as quickly as j /possible.

After the sale took place witness ami bis mate -re mained about two minutes before leaving; defendant thimked'.them on, receiving pay ment. They were in plain clothes, and had I been. Bent on tlieduty by the e_enior serpeant. I Mr. Gould, in defence, animadverted, strongly upon the mode of procedure that I had been taken to obtuiu the. conviction, and. , nsked. that if any penalty were to bo in- | flicted, it should be merely nominal. | The Bench eii-piiied whether anything | was known as te>; the diameter of the d?s- , fendant's I Tlee senior-sergeant unlet tliat he knew n , good deaVwhen I Air.' Gould submitted that the case should stand on its own merits; fend other questions might not. be entered into. Mr. Brooks said that there was no' doubt a breach of the Act had taken place, and * strict supervision certainly oaght to be kept on such houses. Ho would inflict H fine of ?Ills-, with G?. fid.' costs, to be recovered by levy and distress. He would decline to order a penalty. OCSCESE XAKCOAGK.
