Say, ruined walls, Ye ivy-clad and mouldering arches, say, Where are your ancient inmates ?— '1 hey are ; gonel In the lone cells, where erst the voice of prayer Was hourly breathed, the night-wind whistles chill! "Where erst the -vesper hymn and matin cliaunt Were wafted cn their own sweet wings to heaven, / . ; The wild bird builds her nest, and, warbling there, Trills her sweet lay, unmindful of the past. But, O, how fresh is nature!— e'en from thee, Sad monument, the wild flower draws its birth, - I, ike budding childhood slutnb'ring on the breast - Ofhoary-headed age; the bright green leaves, The dewy herb, spring round thee as of yore. The gentle moon that know thee in thy pride, jUnlike too many of the world's false iriends; -Melhinks sheds softer light upon thy fall. Thus ever are the works of God renewed, Fresh as when liTst from nought he fashioned them. Whilst man's frail deeds, like to himself, are dust. And what a chaos of unnoted things Are in the searchless, dark abyss of time ! For each short moment adds its viewless store, To give another atom to the past. And centuries roll on— and short- lived man, Like dew-drop on the mighty oceaii-wave, Sinks on the sea of time. Still do ye stand, fair ruins ! like the ghosts . Of friends departed, monldring to decay. O would that ye would warn us that, at best, Frail are our deeds, and frailer still ourselves— That, like the rainbow of a weeping sky, Wc rise, we shine, we change, and pass away. How bright, how blest, bow glorious were our end, If, as arises that bright rainbow's arch, We rose on wings of light, from earth to heaven ! '
