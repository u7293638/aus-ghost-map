Luminous Fungi. TO THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY MAIL, Sir, — In answer to the inquiries of your correspondent, respecting the above, I may state that I have found this fungi growing on living trees near Manly Beach. The luminosity of it was so great, that when placed by night in a dark room, objects for several feet around could distinctly be seen from the other end of the room. Feeling curious to know how long the luminous matter would last, I placed several pieces on a sheet of paper. In two or three days I found the whole of them reduced to the consistency of bran, amid which was a living mass of maggots. How came they there ? — the fungi showed no sign of this when taken from the trees ; it was hard, and quite firm to the feel. Then the season seemed to be too far advanced for it to be caused by flies. I gave it no further thought beyond consigning the whole to the flames, as the smell was anything but pleasant. This Fungi was from six to eight inches long, three to four inches broad, and nearly white in colour. Frequently they may be found much larger, caused by one growing out of the other. But when so found their luminosity is much diminished. There is no difficulty in finding the place whereit grows. There is a pathway leading over the narrow neck of land at the northern end of the outer or Cabbage Tree Beach : this leads to a small beach, with a stream of water flowing down to it, by following up this stream from the beach for a few hundred yards, on the right hand side of it, you come to. a well-shaded spot, with a thick undergrowth of ferns. This Fungi could be gathered here in abundance ; in April and May of last year, on the surrounding trees. I have often thought that this spot would be worth a visit on a still and dark night, as the many luminous bodies on the trees would have a singular effect. I have not searched for it this season, still I feel confident it will be found there in plenty. G. S. M.
