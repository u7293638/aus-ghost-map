SPORTING NOTES FROM HOME. B* Robin Hood. LONDON, March 28. The racing season has commenced, mid we are in the very middle of the very busiest week* in the year, and 1 therefore. shall by this mail only be able to send details of three of the leading events, and shall in my next as usual go through the week's racing. The Grand National will be run only Bome two hours before the mail closes, but I shall arrange to get details, 1 hope, in this letter. A race that will, perhaps, interest my readers more than any other was the first race of the week j in it Hie Australian horse Plutarch made his first appearance in England. Hi« advent was looked forward to with much interest, as he is the schoolmaster, if not actually the trial horse, of the Derby colts. Plutarch looked fit and well, and was ridden by Bowes, bnt be carried a 101b. penalty, for. having wen £500 in Australia. This was not generally known, as he figured in the programme aa carrying 9st. 41b. As a fact, however, he had the crasher np ot lOst. 21b., aB the following details will show THE TBI At PLATE) Of 150 so vs.; weight for age,' sc.; second received 5 bo vs.; entrance, 3 eovs. about a mile.

Betting.—Oto 4 agst Bobbin, 100 to 60 esrst Nor mandy, 4 to 1 agst Plutarch, and 100 to 8 each agst SdsD, iUn Ada, and Manilla celt. Notwithstanding the weight, there was a good deal of money for die old hone, and he ran tor a long way more than respectably. The weight, however, told when half the journey'had been got over, and he fell back, and was at .once eased by Bowes, so that he finished last. The race terminated with a splendid finish between the out eider Manilla colt and the greatly-fancied Normandy. The latter, however, jnst stayed the longer, and won by a short head. It Beems to me to have been doubtful policy to run Plutarch with such a cruBher *, but doubtless Mat. Dawson had his reasons or instructions. I heard 18 to 1 offered against the Derby colts conpled as soon as Nor mandy's number went up, but there has been no bet recorded on the Derby during this whole week, as both layers and backers have been too full of Lincoln and Liverpool events to pay any heed to an event so distant as the Derby.. Meantime, the colts continue to do good work at Newmarket, although Narellan (to physic) waa only walking a couple of dtys last week. Both galloped a mile and a S quarter to-day. The big event of the week at Lincoln was, of course, the Handicap, which result^ in a win for a horse which had been well backed when the weights came out, bnt had latterly, owing to want' of support from the very clever division owning him, gone bhdly in the matket, and Btarted at the price which will be found against bis name in the appended details. Rejected, trim very easily by a length and a half, with Shimmer some three lengths ahead of the despised outsider Lord George. Time of winner, limn. SOsec.

The ring I think loBt by the ancceas of The Rejected, although I think hia owner only threw in for about fire thousand, butthe public made the boree a strong fancy when the weights appeared, and as far as I can gather the ring were losers as I have said. The other events at Lincoln shall receive full attention in my next letter. 2 may say that Colonel North began the year well by winning the leading two-year-old race at Lincoln with Simoniau, a son of St. Simon and Gironne, for whom he gave 4,000 guineas as a yearling at the Doncaster sales last ! year. The following ate brief details of the Grand National, run for, as I have said, almost as the mail is closing GRAND NATIONAL STEEPLECHASE, Of 2,000 sovs. (luelmlve of a trophy value 100 sore.), by subscription of SO aovs. each, 16 ft. and 6 only if declared; the seoond to receive 200 sovs. and tho third 100 sovs. from the stakes.
