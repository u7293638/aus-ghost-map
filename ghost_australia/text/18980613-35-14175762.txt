In justifying himself in going to Milton to deliver an address the Premier and the fresh air of that country would braces a man up for the had atmosphere of Parliament House. Mr. Reid says the newspapers have suddenly discovered that he is possessed of all the evil qualities which the worst sort of politician could have developed in tho course of a lifetime. As a general rule, Mr. Reid says, a politician does not place himself go that he is almost sure to satisfy nobody and almost sure to draw upon himself fire from everybody and everywhere. But the course which he took was sure to bring about that result. Mr- Reid says that rather than vote against and kill the Commonwealth Bill he preferred to stand up to be shot at from both sides of the hedge in order to give the measure a fair chance of being accepted if, he said, he had gone round the country and tried to shut the eyes of the people to the defects of the bill be would have been the dear old George Held" of early days "What is the fan minded way of regarding the vote on the bill P " Mr Reid asked the people at Milton, and one of them answered " That majority should rule " The Government has, the Premier says, come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to go to the country with any hope of convincing a majority of the electors that the bill and nothing but the bill he said be passed into law Not a single member of the Cabinet, Mr Reid says, regarded the bill as being so satisfactory a measure that they could use their influence to cram it down the throats of the people of New South Wales Mr Reid says the heads of the other colonies might very naturally be sore when he asked them to begin the federation matter over again. The Premier of Tasmania has wired to Mr Reid in terms of indignation in reference to the proposal to amend the Commonwealth Bill Mr Reid told the people of Milton that Tasmania had the grandest slice of the federation compact Mr End has declined emphatically that it is his desire to make substantial alterations in the bill When the Government goes to the country it will, Mr Reid BBJH, stake its position on the necessity for getting the bill improved in some substantial rcBpoets before it accepts it Lord WOIHOIOJ, Commander-in-Chief of the British army, is motvUonod as the probable successor to Lord Aberdeen in tboGovornoi-Gcnurnl ship of Canada and Sir William Macgregor is mentioned as the next Governor of Tasmania The belief is gaining; ground that an interven- tion the part of the European Powers in the war between America and Spain is approaching Germany desires that an international conference should be held to dull with the question as to the future control of the Philippines America is establishing a naval b is at Gunn the line the inhabitants of Santiago do Cuba are in a starving condition silex and ammunition for Cuban insurgents have been landed by the Americans Strained relations am reported to exist between the United States and Germany because the United States Govermment will not give assurances not to occupy the Philippine.)

It is to, he observed that in this deliver- ance the Premier becomes more and more anti-billite and anti- foderationist. He recapitulates the old objections, but with increased shrillness. We find him descending to explanations which are unfair, and to statements which are inaccurate, Take his reiterated assertion in these words :-" You can see any number of hills ; but once this becomes an Act it is done for over, and you can never alter it," . . . "A bad Act of Parliament can be altered, but acceptance of this bill means scaling a document which binds you, as well as generations to come, for ever." Mr. Pond is one of the trainers of this bill, and he must know that, so far from it being unalterable, it is capable of amendment far more easily after adoption than before. "We have shown this by recapitulation of the constitutional machinery of amendment provided by the bill and by a consideration of the immense, difficulties in any attempted revision of the bill by conferences of Premiers and the like difficulties which Mr. Reid is now finding out for himself. It is by this time obvious to those who think at all that it is misrepresentation to assert that the federal constitution is as a law of the Medes and Persians for Mr. Reid to make this misrepresentation is inexcusable, Then again we must remark the scornful language used by him towards other Premiers, notably Sir Edward Braddon. This kind of language employed towards one of the Australian Premiers, who at all events lins loyally observed the honour of his, word and his colony, cannot facilitate the new movement which Mr. Reid takes credit for inaugurat- ing. Things like this indicate a contro- versialist fallen into bad company and into a bad way. We can anticipate little progress and little credit from undertakings begun with tactics of this nature. The matter at issue is not escaping an election difficulty, but dealing with the free people of Australia. It is right to have a sense of our importance in the Australian group of States ; it is unfederal, to say the least, to flaunt our strength and bid all Australia await our pleasure and accept our decision. Mr. Reid now says the three other colonies hold on to the bill because they have the best of the bargain. Why, then, did he retain his place in the Convention to the end? Why did he tell the Town Hall meeting that he would vote for the Convention Bill ? Perhaps we may find the explanation in his remark that " thousands and thousands of voters never took the trouble to vote against it" because they felt that the 80,000 statutory minimum would kill the bill. Mr. Reid says the raising of that minimum was a mistake but the responsibility of that is his. Had he wished to have the minimum of 50,000 retained he would never have permitted some chance private member to rush a bill through for breaking faith with the other colonies. The more Mr. Reid explains the less satisfactory does his federal attitude appear. All his new tactics point to delay, to distrust, to defeat in detail for the federal cause as far as it is in his power to undo the will of the people. One thing is every day becoming more clear, that from Air. Reid nothing federal can be expected. The distrust of the other Premiers is but one way of putting the feeling of the 71,000, the tricked majority of New South Wales. Nothing that Mr. Reid has said or that he is likely to say during his expedition to Moruya can alter for federalists the central and fixed point of the situation. This is the necessity of concentrating and organising their forces in readiness for the coming elections. The anxiety shown by the leaders and members of both the existing parties in Parliament, as illustrated in the Premier's speech, to shunt the federal issue from the elections affords the measure of the importance to federalists of making this the issue on which the elections must turn. We are enabled to realise this importance if we consider what would be the position of federation were it not that general elections are immediately pending at which the people will be able to give their decision on the question. The assertion of the foes of union that the Commonwealth Bill is dead and buried would in that case be strictly true. The conspiracy of Ministry and Parliament to defeat the decision of the people and to give the victory to the minority over the majority would then appear without any attempt at disguise. Those would be no attempt then to secure or even to affect a desire to secure, amendments in the bill which a majority in this colony and three other colonies have accepted. Parliament would assemble, federation would be dropped as a dead thing, and political matters would go on in the old way with sham contests over freetrade and protection, reform of the Council, local , option, the referendum, local government, and all the elements of that barron strife about superannuated political stock properties with which the people are so familiar and of which they are 60 weary. That this is not done now is due solely to the fact that the question of federation in its entirety must come before the people within a few weeks. It must come in a form far more formidable to the politicians than that in which it was dealt with the other day. The question whether the issue of of federation is to be determined by the majority or the minority of the electors must be fought out anew as a distinct issue in every electorate. It is hardly to be wondered that every effort is, as Air. Force announces, being made to shirk such a contest, and that many members would willingly see the bill pass in any form rather than face the electors as the advocates of the right of the minority to defeat the decision of the majority. Just in proportion to the eagerness of Ministers and members to maintain that .' federa- tion has nothing to do with politics " must be the determination of federalists to secure that this issue must during the elections and also in the coming Parliament take priority over every other. It is simply endeavouring to delude the people to pretend that the question is one of amending the present bill. In say ing this we may also say that every true federalist in this colony would be glad if it were possible to get the bill amended in such a way, if that were possible, as would remove the objections of any genuine federalists, if there are such, who are opposed to the measure. But that work to be genuine and effective would have to be done by the friends, not by the enemies, open or covert of federation, it would have to be undertaken for the purpose of securing federation, not to destroy it. But coming from the sources it now springs from the proposal can only be viewed with deep distrust and suspicion. The authors and supporters of the scheme are those who have during the late contest and on all former opportunities striven to make Australian union in any shape impossible. It is obvious to everyone that no practicable amendment of the bill could in the least degree affect the objections which were for a couple of of months urged against the measure. The objections on which its opponents mainly relied were objections to federation. The characterisation of the other colonies as " wolves " and " thieves," the assertion that we in this colony are not ripe for federation, that we cannot afford its cost, that by uniting with Queensland we should destroy the sugar industry on the Northern rivers, that by removing the border duties we should allow the trade of Riverina to flow to Victoria-all these and many more, which every reader readily recalls, are objections which, if they are valid at all, are valid against union in any form in which it can possibly be attained. And now we have those who for weeks have urged these and similar anti-federal reasons against union with the other colonies calmly telling us that if they could secure a few amendments, and especially if they can bring in (Queensland to effect the ruin of our sugar industry,. they would be quite ready to accept the bill. Surely it is impossible to see in such a policy anything other than an attempt to hypno- tise the attention of the people till the general elections are over, when those who now profess such zeal for union would promptly cost union, their contemplated amendments, and their late objections into the waste basket of oblivion and set themselves to the task of moving the puppets of freetrade and protection, local government and the political referendum, to amuse the people for another period of three years. The ro iiioiiMbility it. cast upon the leaders and nienioN of the party of Australian union a" making. such a course as this impose ' It is apparent to all who have dis passionately considered the question that in our present political situation even the great cause of federation has become a matter of secondary importance Or rather it derives much of its importance from the circumstance that it is indissolubly bound up with the cause of the self-government of the people. During the last twelve months our governing institutions have resolved themselves into a great conspiracy to defeat what it was feared in advance would he the will, of the people on the matter of federation The two Houses of Parliament, which in a moment of unwonted patriotism and loyalty to the popular will passed a bill referring this decision to the people, speedily realised the dangers with which this course was fraught to the interests of the individual politician From this change of feeling sprang the perfidious Enabling Act Amendment Bill, which cast asleep strain on the public honour of New South Wales. It did more, it struck a deadly blow at the principle of rule of the people by the people. It did so by substituting in its place rule of the people qualified by the superior authority and interest of the professional politician This insidious design has so far effected its purpose by allowing a minority of the electors to determine over the heads of the minority But in producing this result it has entailed up in its authors the responsibility of going to the country to defend the principle of minority rule, and to maintain the right of members of Parliament to disregard the decision of the people when it runs counter to the personal' interests of the politician in the coming elections the principle of the self government of the people as expressed by the vote of the majority will be bound up with that of the attainment of Australian union fence both the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition, in disregard of the votes even of their íosrieetue electorates, have cast in their lots with the party of minority rule, the cause of union and of the government of the people can only be safeguarded by a new party being sent into Parliament to make the recent decision of the people effective It is satisfactory to know that the task has been confided to trustworthy leaders, who are not likely to think from the duties asked at their hands Among the suggestions of the Committee of Inquiry in the Town Hall none is more indamilly important than that for the reform of the low n clerk's department Without laying too much stress upon the committee's report and without note creating the notion of the Council there upon, it must be evident to all who have followed the slow course of this inquiry that the administration of the Town Clerk's office was offered morn for impure mont J ¡io Town Clerk of a city like Sydney of right to be a strong and capable man, he ought to have had a business and municipal training in farm import cant place, he ought to be, if not a solicitor 01 Teamster, a man of legal knowledge and the legal mind 'J the duties of this situation are most varied, and all of them important also is the due executive officer of the motion polis 'through his hands should pass every transaction of the Corporation, with the Government, with other corporations, with private citizens He is required to know the law as it affects all the hundred and one interests of the municipality To him the Mayor and the aldermen ought to look for information and advice UCCOE stay to decision upon the consent of the city To him all the staff of the Town J fall ought to be responsible, and through him, as the chief officer of the Corporation, all business ought to be done That is a bare outline of the functions which in other great cities are discharged by their town clerks , but it would seem that in this city either an unenterprising: officer has lost many of these tasks slip out of his hands, or else success five aldermen and Mayors have not given the Town Clerks of the day his due place in civic work flow fail the blame is to be shared is not at present the question, nor are we going to to view the manner in which or the men by whom the office has been filled during the period covered by the report What has to be said, with more regret than hesitation is that the city his not lately had such a man in the position of Town Clerk as that position required If we turn to two other Australian cities we shall find that a great measure not merely of the smoothness in working but of their general SUCeSS in administration has been due to high ability in this office The City of Melbourne lies in many years been a well governed city in its municipal ruins 'The Corporation of Melbourne does not, perhaps, exercise a large number of functions than does the Corporation of Sydney , those stuck transit is mainly till

within its range the city of Melbourne has long enjoyed the respect and confidence of late papers, the approval of visitors, mil till i output of Victorians "Much of that esteem and success it certainly owes to a man of great personal force and ability, Mr J 6 1 FitzGibbon, for years the Town Clerk of Melbourne, now chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works He was not at all times no easy despot in the Town Hall low public men in their day had little opposition and criticism than he, but his i uni employers, the citizens, and his nominal masters, the Council, know that he had but one object, the ad*, auctions of the city, and he had both the ability to form a big plan and the resource to execute it in a less striking but not a less effective way, the late Mr Thomas Worsnop, of Adelaide, did splendid service to that well managed city Every branch of corporate. work had the personal attention of this zealous and capable man-, and as he was supported by the Council through a long term of office, just as Mr PiUGribbon was in Melbourne, he was able to render the most important services to his city In those two cases we can discern the value of the personality of a good 'Town Clerk While Mr FitzGibbon was a masterful servant, and Mr Worsnop a more diplomatic one, while the former overbore opposition and the latter fore stalled it, they equally benefited the cities they served They became a moulding influence, and as theirs was a continuing tenure of office they persuaded successive councils to one farm, continuous policy The Town Clerkship of Sydney is now vacant, and the opportunity exists for putting into the office a man of a strong type The interests of citizens would gain by this being done Of course it will be cheaper, easier, more popular with aldermen and the Town Hall officials to put in a more outcast, a gentleman who will disturb nobody and nothing, will keep everything smooth, and take his orders and his salary peace abl) The affairs of this city want some thing more than this kind of town clerk A bold stroke is now called for. If the aldermen would show that they are superior to false economy and feeble jealousy, they will take the opportunity that now presents itself for appointing as their chief executive officer a man who will be a source of strength to them Such. a man would hold the reins firmly at the Town Hall, which is apparently much needed, he would conserve the interests of the city, and would be a powerful influ- ence for economy and efficiency Mon of this type are not to be picked up. The offer of a liberal salary, a fixed engagement during good behaviour and a defined sphere of operations would be necessary to attract such a man as is wanted. The municipal business of this city is already very large, and is constantly growing, and the order of talent required to assist the aldermen and Mayor is always higher, A strong, judicious Town Clerk would immensely simplify the routine work which aldermen have now to discharge, he would do a deal of this work himself and do it better, leaving the Council from for its proper function of control and direction, and in this func- tion the Council could not fail to be helped materially by a zealous and able men The Mayor the other day told a story of absorption in civic affairs, which, though creditable to him, is not creditable to the system, The Mayor of Sydney is not a chief clerk, and we cannot every you expect to elect a man who will spend from 10 to 5 daily in the Town Hall for weeks together It is not so in other cities, even those loss important than Sydney, and this Banfather reason for urging the City Council to weigh very maturely the proposal of its committee about the Town Clerkship Viox-iiLaAL NEWS -Lady Hampden will this afternoon open a sale of works at the Victoria Barracks, and in the evening will attend a meeting of the Melanesian Mission The PjiLMii r AT MILTON The Premier in his speech at Milton lnuicaUil the attitude which it is intended to of Government sholl maint tin with regard to federation Respecting the com truce with the Premier, Mr Held stated that in view of the refusal of Tasmania, South Ans train and A\ es ern Aus' rulla to join in any conference it was now hopeless to expect that such a meeting would tiKo plate He had, however, I owed an intimation from the Premier of Queen s land expressing his willingness to confer, and Mr Reid during the course of his speech dwelt with considerable force upon the necessity for the inclusion of the northern colony in any federa- tion of Australia A conference thus being regarded as being; out of the question, Mr Kell then dealt with the proposal which has been made to decide them ittor at the next general election by returning a Paris inn at pledge 1 to amend the Act of India ment requiring 80,000 affirmative After He distinctly decline 1 to pledge the Government to any) such course No such attempt, he intimated would be made by the Government, and if it was made by others The Government of the colony would do its best to arrest it The Government was omg to the country upon the ground that it was necessary that the Commonwealth Bill should be improved in some substantial ri Bpeots before it was accepted An in tim union was made flint no far as the 1 renner know that we is the determination of the whole Cabinet as not one member of the Government considered the bill a satisfactory measure It is understood that in his other speeches the Prime I will deal with local politics and will indicate the programme for the next session He will also urge upon the electors, as indicated in his Milton speech, not to fight the next election solely upon the " federal ticket " IltlHOVID TRAMWAY SKnMCL ON THE COOMA LINE -The Railway Coininu-hioiiers have for some time past been considering the nd Mobility of unproved Q tram services on the Cudgee line, and have had the traffic closely watched Recently it was decided to bring about improvements, send on and after Monday next additional trams will run during the business hours of the day, on leaving Randwick at b 15 am to the city, and others from Bent-street to Randwick at 150 and 6 20 p m Tills provides a quarter-hourly service from 9 am to 6 15 pm On Saturdays an additional tram will leave Bent-street for Randwick at 12 50 pm This will provide a quarter hourly service from II J i to 1 55 p m Till' liAOoiui -HMS Royal Arthur, with the Commander-in Chief on board, yesterday arrived in Toms Bay from New Zealand, anchor- ing at ') 4 'a a in 'The flagship will remain for a day or two and came thence to Sydney ALLORA.
