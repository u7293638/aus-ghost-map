Of course every one knows now what horse won the Cup; The only thing every one does potkribwis'howit was done; arid, before en tering upon the description, a few biographical potes as /to the hero of the hour, .Nimblefoot, may notbeamiBs. Heiirsfc displayed his. foot in Tasmania, several years ago, as a youngster ; and people Baid he would ?have, done, great things had he been properly, handled. Mr. Joseph Thompson, book- , piaker, bought; him somewhere about . the ; commencement of the year 1867, whereupon great things were prophesied of him, for th with, , but his ill-luok was linvinoibje during the.next Autumn season oh the Vic torian ,turf, and' for other, seasons that he was perseVered with. ; The lafei Mr. 'Walter Craig,: of Ballarat, fanoiod the horse much, and boughf hirii,! but did nti, better than Mr. Thompson. However, Jtr. Craig ,was neyer., easily put, off his likings, as a succession of osses with half a dozon of his pets will, amply evince; To Nimblofoot he stopd niore firmly than to any., ! He 'determined that ;he horse sh,ould have a last chance by pay ing a visit' to his native isle, in order to recruit and - come over again fresh from its bracing air aiid evergreen pastures. So Nim blefoot was shipped away to Tasmania riibre than atwolVemontii ago ; and, after a liberal, allowance of time to kick up his heola, ;he was shipped back again to. go into training; or the Melbourne' Cup. ; Several months ago « Mr._ Craig diedv but befprb his death he had a remarkable dream, whioh will assuredly be ' horicefoicward'the'.moBt wonderful tradition; of the Victorian turf., On the night before , his -death, Mr. -Craig dreamt that he saw : Nimblefoot; wiri the Melbourne Cup, carry- ; ing ihi8,weU,kripwn color— yiplet-— but with , a pieceof crape 6n- the sleeve, whereby he .1 concluded that the eveqt would take place after, his death.

This was as far. inerely aa -Melbourne. ; They were emptied into Bourke-street, arid from- ithere they, : sought, their own modes of progression On- : ward^.

Unlike those who patronised the road, their journey, once commenced,, was .utterly uneventful ;: i but 'then it had; the merit, of being brief,- and, on the whole^ not uncomfortable; . Ybt, after all, there was some excitement iii ^travelling by. the rail; There! was!- the glbrious scramble at the tioket seller's window, and the: delightful uncertainty when' you got there whether you woiild. not be swept away by tho im petuous pro wd ere you succeeded, in obtaining ! \ ypuv ticket. This obtained, !then' came ;!the! equally exciting, task of! obtaining a.^at^a work of some little diffi culty as, the, Hour of, noon drew on. Train followed \ train in ! rapid; succeasion, each crowded with its. thousands of race goers, and yet the number on the platform seemed scarcely thinned. The arrangements of the department were on the whole capital, and not the slightest hitch occurred in tho despatoh of the trains the moment they were full. Yet the resources of the depart ment were tasked ? to their utmost, and were only sufficient to meet the public require ments. Everywhere in the neighborhood of the station !things wore an unwonted' air Of anixnation. 'Cabs arid private carriages dashed up, to the maiii entrance and deposited their living freights, while .unbroken lines bf pedestrians from alldireotions. converged towards ihe Speiicer-street terminus, proving that thousands had decided [ that theii* trip! to Fleiniugtoh ' should' be' made behind the iron horse. Round the1 ticket windows there, was a 'scene of ?bustle and ex pitbment. Hero Patbrf a'milias '.' waS ; strug gling to proouro tickets for solf arid' olive branches, while an excitable' Gaiil of diminu-V tiyestatuve was gesticulating wildly in his endeavor to, distance his Teutonic neighbor . iu'roaohirig the tiokefc window. ; Horsey men, and pyeh fair ladies,1 wero to be seen mixed' in tlio struggling crowd, swaying hither and thithor to pr ocurp that which .might have been seoured at their ease elsewhere by the ^xcroisQ of a] little forethought. Now for a ?moment . tlie crowd thinned, and then again: it incroftaod; arid sp, till the afternoon was far . advanced, and tli,e Cup race' had bebn run, !th'e changing scene Was reproduced. ,'. It woTild be difficiiltto say,-vliefchdr tho passen- ' gbrs or tho rattway officials 'evinced the greater amount of e'xeitomeht. Evorywhcro there was a crowd bf fashionably dressed pleasurers, and every where a. buaz of ex cited conversation was heard. Train after train runs in, and in less time than it takes to notea.bet, are filled and, speeding bri their way. Hundreds are. left behind, and ere another train is^ shunted into its ulace, tHe platform 'saems , as; densely, packed as before. As hour. by. hour passes, thou sands are despatched to their destination, ' and the- cry is still they come.' Good, humor however prevails everywhere, and in due time all were taken to their destination as.rapidly, as half a dozen trains could take them. The precautions taken by the de partment to prevent . crowding worked ad mirably, and it is saying something 'to the credit of all concerned wherilt is stated that between 15f»000 arid -14, 000 ?passehgers wiere carried to the course, without accident, i in itw.p brief ?hours,:andthat without, interfering (with the ordinary traffic of the line, which jamounted to oyer 4000 passengers. Of the return journey it is scarcely necessary to speak. All that could be done was done.

The field was , therefore re duced to twenty-eight— the largest field that bver started for the Melbourne : Cup, or for any other race . in any portion of Aus tralia. The two first' ? races only served as/ whets to :the appetite for the great event of the day, the easy victory of Romula; fbr'the Maiden Plate having the effect ' pf making liapdbg an even better favorite for the Cup. ' Owing to some mis take, the Railway;' Stakes was' not started uritil'two o'clock, a delay which somewhat diminished the time for saddling and weigh ing the Cup horses,; and gave, those of the jpublic i who haddeclined to back their ppin'ioi until they saw theii- favorites strip, m order 'first; t'or make up their minds and ihen't6r get bji/;th1eir: money, all their work to do. . Mr. De Mestre's , pair, Trump Card and Tim Whiffler, looked the .picture of health, and cenditiori., THe big bay was in 'every' respect the ' finest horse bri ' the ground,', 'and ? notwithstanding his crushing weight; his 'admirers .would persist in seeing him arid him only in the race. Thb public were very sweet upon Trump Card after; his victory in the Essendon Stakes on Saturday,1 but the best judges declined to admit that the running upon that occasion was '. true,' 'and maintained' that Croydori held all the Sydney division safe. Mr. Winch was very confident, and told every one that his horse was in rare buckle, and barring accidents would repeat his victory in ihe Metropolitan; that his severe run ori Saturday had done him all the good in the, world, and he would run a great horse, -Grlericoe looked magnifir cent j never in his -most palmy days did the gallant chesnut Btrip better, arid his con dition showed that Lang has done wonders during the last few months. Warrior did iabt please iis. He did not seem short of work, but there was a sluggishness about Kim which, could not have been found a year jagp. Lapdog did not look the horse he turned but to be, and judging from appear ances ' he would not have been backed for. a shilling. In- private .trials he had .dbrie excellent tiirie, but it was generally believed that ihe was a rank cow&rd;, arid that if ever collared he would shut up. Pr&tor; seemed to have im proved upon his Saturday's appearance, but, likeiriost of the horses trained in Melbourne, bis chances would have been better had the Cup been run for this day month. Barbelle, although 'pink,' was not fancied, as it was known that the stable, money .'had been put upon her companion Barbarian, who, despite his alleged unsoundness, had a warm and select circle of admirers. The Utter want of form shown' by Pyrrhus made the usual fol lowers of Mr. Tait*s stable pause before they touchedeithertheEarl or Pearl, although the latter has improved very much since his last performance in public at Rand wick. Sir William, seemed all to pieces, and the distance was too short for poor old Strop, who seems as if time had dealt gently witn him. The Monk's coriditiori was good, but hie quality is scarcely of a description to enable him to repeat.his lucky fluke of last year ; and the Flying Dutchman has ceitairily jiot improved by his yiBit to Ballarat. The judge's crack Sir Joliri is 4 great horse, , and his backers were, ^vithbuB/ariy apparerit reason, very ' sweet upon hirii ; while'- the D.uke bf Montrose division kept remarkably quiet, perhaps because they had a very much better thing in Niniblofoofc, who riiust' have proved a second Bundof Hope toBallarafc, and -yill, quite' retrieve the waning luck of the metropolitan 'gold- field. Palmorston was a picture)' but such a fine weight-currier seems out of place in;a handicap.- Paddy's Land had a host bf partisans (why we obuld 'not', 'disco-; ver ), : : arid . ' Freetrader was not iiltogofcher friendless, .although his party were not :so Banguino as they had been, owing to tho course being, bxoept in one small .'spot, in excellent ^condition. ? yalentirio was never mentioned after' his defeat on Saturday ; arid Mischief, although running in ?Wilson's colors, vir'as known, tobe luany'poutu'ls ?worse, than 'Lapdog. Saladin, Huntsman, and (Patience; aro vixsoful for suburbari and .up couiitry riieotihgs, ' but they dicl not seem at ;all at .home in tho Cup. Tho preliminary :catiters made no alteration in public opinion, 'save that we did riot think Warrior's stylo of 'going qnite^what wo should have liked ; . and peoplo had scarcely settled into their places whdri tho cry was raised that they were off. Thp dense crowd was so still that tihe dull heavy ^thud of the horses, could plainly bo hoard as they galloped by-^all so well toge ther that it was almost impossible to nay which led past .the stand, although Barbelle had perhaps a Wight advantage :— 'They camo like the rusii of the Southern surf on ! ' tho shoros of the storm bound bay, ' ? ; And like muffled drums on. tho sounding turf their. I , hoofatrdkes echoed away.' ;,, ', .. ,,; But by the time the old stand . was passed, Lapdog, Nimblefoot -. and Valentine had a decided lead; Croydon had got through the ruck, and was full' of running ; Glencoe Jiad. settled kindly to his work, and Old Tim was beginning to creep up gradually. In a few mpre seconds Glencoe had fallen back jeaten; The Duke of Montrose went through his horses,, and for a -few- seconds looked iangerous, and it became quite apparent ihat\Croydon could not .get; any: closer, to the ; light weights. At; the. turn to the . straight running, . Lapdog, arid [ Nimblef oot . had obtained a: decided lead, which; they increased every stride, and when the straight; running : was. reached they.were the, ' only two in; the, race. Insido the distance they were neck and neck ; at the.stand it looked like a dead heat, but, young Day managed to c land;'. Nimble&ot; ; ;a, ', winner .by a' short, head/ Valentine , third, Croydon fourth, Tim ; Whiffler fifth, arid the. Duke of Montrose, - whose rider had broken his saddle, and thus, lost his chance, if ever he had any, sixth; The time was 3 minutes 37 seconds, being the fastest two miles ever ;run in, the. colonies/ For some minutes i the greater number of the spectators thought I. it was a dead heat; but all doubts vvere set at rest when Bob Hamilton was seen riding along side Mmblefbot, arid his number was put up on the telegraph. . . The . winner, . who was ridden with crape, was the property of the late 'Mr Craig, who bought him in 1866'from Joe Thompson, .the well-known bookrnaker, who, had purchased him in Launcestbn, immediately .after ? the Champion' .Races, and entered, him year after year for all ..the great events with almost unvarying . ill success, ; Nimblefoot is by Panici who ran second for the Cup in Toryboy'syear, out of Quickstep, brie of the competitors in the first Champion Race ever run in Australia. ; ? ! THE COCJRSE... . . . But, road or rail, whichever was selected as the means of transit to the course, was at best but a.means to the end ; and the excite ment arid incidents connected with the jour ney by either, served, but as preludes, to the anticipated sport. It was ,on the cours9 that the enjoyment of the day was centred, and all else served but to while away the tediunl of the time till that desired goal was reached. Betimes the 'thronging thousands' pouring in from all directions told that the meeting would be the best attended which had been, held for years ;,but it was npt till approach ing the time for,. the starting of the first race ,that any adequate ; idea, could bo gathered of the true magnitude of the vast assemblage which thronged every; portion of the course to witness the great. national ^ace of the year. Indeed, even then it was difficult, except ,f rorii very exceptional posi tions, to obtain a general idea of the immense concourse. In many situations the immc 'diate crowd was so dense that it was impos sible to : estimate its numerical strength, while iri other cases only a portion of the course was in sight. There was one spot, however, . where a general view could be obtained, and where all the de tails were at once . grasped by the mind, and contemplated as one magnificent whole. Away on the banks of the Saltwater River, down among the small boys and fagged roughs who had located themselves in this spot, known familiarly as ' the river turn,' was the spot referred to. Standing here, away from the more reputable,portions of the gathering, the whole scene appeared like a vast panoramic picture before the eye of the gazer, who, if of an at all susceptible disposition,; must have felt his.spirits exhi larated at the mere.sight. In the immediate foreground of the picture, which was such as would have delighted the heart of Frith, were the assembled thousands who affect 'the Course.' To speak of them as a crowd would, be incorrect; they formed a series of crowds, the margin of one just impinging on; that of ' the; next. Like all Victoriai gatherings of the kind, it was conspicuous for being a well dressed, orderly assemblage, fully bent on enjoying the sport, and thoroughly, knowing how to do so.. An ever changing mass of bright colors and a moving sea of heads indicated to the eye the bounds of the upper - side bf the course and the line of the '' inner running,' while the , white picket fence beyond defined the bounds of the reserves. Beyond the course the grand stand and lawo, crowded with their fair occupants, shone out like a garden of flowers of the rarest hues :. like a bright, a precious gem, set in a worthy setting. At the distance individualities ?ivere merged into generalities, and this por tion of the. course with its ever changiug play of form and color, imparted a constant animation to the whole. , To the left the busy scene in the saddling paddock engaged tho eye and . attention, while to the ' right tho bustle and excitement of the oarriage reserve fairly balanced; the picture.. Still, further right, the gleaming canvas of the booths of the outer paddock served as a background against which the thoitsarids there assembled stood out in bold relief, while be yondi th,P . eye became . lost, in the . vast assemblage of carts and vehicles of every degree, from the omnibus down to the prison van, which obtruded its hateful presenca prominently in a portion; of the picture, where its- absence would have : beeu prefer able. Away still further right (where tho gleaming spires of tho. city' agaiust a summer sky formed' a splendid bjaok-ground, and brought the air - of calm-' repose into iuime ciiato contrast- with the, busy scene be fore), the road was marked by an unbroken line of vehicles and pedestriaus all pouring in one direction. Above, tho busy stir of arriving, and. depai'ting trains arrested tlio attentionfbr an' iastant, and then tho bye swept towards /the- lef b again. :Thej outer hill seemed black with the moving mass. The upper : stand! 'appeared; 'at1 the; ;di8fcauca a confused sea of faces ; and above alJ, tlio hill towered up, a very pyramid of human heads ; so densely was the .crowd packed that i-carco a body could be ecou. As a 'whole, the sight was grand; while the ? murmur, of conversation from tho iui rnouse concourse swept toAvards tho river, striking the ear like the roar of distant , wave's' dashing bri a rocky shore. Such, was the scene as observed from the river. ; i; THE LAWN. : ; Of all the concentrated attractions of the la\vri, or ' at least ' its fair occupants, who shall speak ? Shall ' superlatives be piled upon superlatives, till comparison -, Sickens at the task,' in praise of the as sembled beauty, youth, and fashion of the southern metropolis, or shall the task be abandoned? It would be paying the fair patrons of . the turf but poor homage to their charms to meanly shrink from the bbvioua duty of chronicfing their triumpha. Therefore, conscious of the impossibility of doing them substantial, justice, an attempt, at least, must be' made. The lawn and stand never on any previous oc-' casion presented so brilliant an assemblage. The fair sex predominated, and added beauty to_the scene by the gay hues of their spring toilets. Of the triumphs of the milliner's and modiste's art wnich were achieved, who can! speak with becoming confidence? Sufficient to , say, white was the prevailing color, pink and blue also being well repre Sented iri silks. As to the styles ignorance must be {pleaded, but one thing is certain ! that, whatever they might bo, they became their fair wearers to admiration. To this add. the bright smiles, the animated conver- .', satipns, delightful promenades, innocent flirtations, and : the hundred other little etceteras which go to form some bf , the chief attractions of the . lawn and the ladies' stand, and the materials of a very animated scene are brought into a focus. It . r was delightful, to witness the interest mani fested by the ladies in the result of the . races, and the innocent way in which they staked . gloves and handkerchiefs , on their favorites, often for no better reason than that they admired the color of ! the rider. - His Excellency's box was occupied . by H. R. H. Prince Alfred, his Excellency the Governor; and Lady and Miss Manners Sutton, his Excellency Go- . vernor. Ducane and lady, and their respec tive suites. Baron Jochmus was also present during the day. THE SADDLING PADDOCK. The saddling paddock was, as usual on Cup. days, the centre point of attraction with the frequenters of the grand stand, and, it is almost superfluous to say, was crowded. The notice boards were anxiously watched lest some favorite should be scratched, and when the saddling bells gave their warning tinkle of preparation, there was' a general move made in. the direction of the boxes of the favorites. . The ring was present in force, but on the whole not demonstra tive according, to its wont, and the individual that wanted to 'lay agin every thing, bar nothing' was almost non est. On the other side of the lawn the carriage; paddock was densely packed with vehicles 6f-i every degreej from the four-in-lio-ncl to the ; ponychaise.\: : The number of ca,magca exceeded any previous meeting, except tho ' Prince's Day,' showing that the fashion of driving down in good old style is once more, coming into vogue. ? Of the ani ination observable in this part of the ground there is little to be said, ex- ? ' ceptiihiit when the company adjourned for lunch, carriage picnics were more numerous than they have been latterly. THE HILL. On the hill the scene so oft described before was repeated on a grander scale. There was the usual ready enjoy ment and hearty fun which is the characteristic of the place. There were betting tables in abundance, ? and a very plethora of drinking booths and itinerant shows. Punch, and Judy courted public patronage, and a 'Sable baud of Ethiopia Brothers,' as they designated themselves, discoursed questionable harmony, but didn't seem to find it pay. An enterprising proprie tor of a shooting, gallery had set up his establishment, and, jumping with the times, surmounted the whole with the Prussian eagle, but it .didn't go down.. The gentle public had come to enjoy racing, and wore bent on nothing else. Though the as-. semblage on the hill numbered between 15,000 and . 16,000 persons, . there was . little or no drunkenness, and very few cases of any sort requiring the. intervention of the \ police. A few individuals were handed over to the tender mercies of the authorities for giving effect to their predilections for games not accounted honest, but, beyond this and some pocket-picking, there was no crime: reported. THE OUTER PADDOCK ; For robust jollity and a determined in tention to enjoy the racing on its merits, commend us to the ^ frequenters bf . the course — the rough-and-ready, sort, who know something about a horse, and like to see him go. True, their patronage of the noble sport is humble, but then if they do nothing else they support the national pastime by according it' their presence, and vociferously cheering the. winnor who ever he may be. The attendance yesterday on this part of tho course must have numbered something like 10,000 persons. Far away towards the abattoirs a dense crowd marked . tho line of the course, ? while in the neigh borhood of the winning-post cue of the largest assemblages ever seen on the course was massed in. acorapacfc crowd. JEven tho two trees which remain in the centre of the course were tenanted with.: their scores of anxious spectators, while the fences and hurdles provided, seat accommodation for hundreds of others. Capital order was kept during the day... ,. , ; THE RUNNING. : Maiden Plate.— A sweepstakes of iisova. each, with 150 bovs. added.

True Blue was very fractious at the start, giving both her rider and the starter -some very unnecessary' trouble, and as usual losing considerably by her antics, but when the lot were fairly' under way, Pyrrhus was in the vanguard/ With Topper, Jewess and Bribery, the rear, being brought up by Romula, ThePawn and Hoyden. On the river 'side Bribery took charge of affairs, with'Pyrrhus, Jewess and Topper. At the same time The Pawn was seen creeping up, and before leaving the river was fifth, Eomula being in close proximity. At .'the. old ?' ' stand Jewess ran into the second place,' and ?' almost immediately ;,after\vards The Fawn became third. When approaching the abat toirs Komula emerged! from her seclusion, and soon was seen on The Pawn's quarters. The lot then passed the sheds, andfora'few moments the leading horses closed^ wh'eh' black jacket and white ? cap1 ' were observed coming to the fore on the, outside, and shortly after Rorinilaj had a clear lead, : Bribery being se_ cond, Jewess third, and Pyrrhus' 'fourth^ Bribery then fell . back, as also did the\ Jewess. On rounding the last turn The Pawn made an effort to reach; Romula, but failed to get beyond her girths, Pyrrhus, ; Bribery, Jewess, and True Blue being toge ? ther. The race was now virtually .; over; Romula galloping in a clever winner', followed by The Pawn, True Blue, and Pyrrhus, Bri bery being fifth Jewess sixth, arid Hoy- - den seventh.

Amethyst then moved forward and had very scion es tablished a clear lead, and although running as wide and unkindly as it was possible for hertodo.it was patent rto everybody that she must win. At the last turn she fan nearly over to the off side of the course, and had she been steered by a lad, as on Satur day last, she must have lost the race, but Kane stuck to her and finished under the judge's box, Foam passing the others in the run home and coming in second, with Wis dom third.

Twenty-eight horses came to the post, and, considering the num ber, gave the starter but little trouble. When they were once fairly in view, Barbelle held a slight lead, with Sir John, Pnetor, Valentine, and the Duke of Mon trose, Croydon being in the centre, and in this way, like a charge of cavalry, did they pass the grand stand, when the second and third last horses were recog nisable in Warrior and Tim Whiffler. . Up the river side Barbelle still held the sway, the Duke of Montrose pressing her closely, with Sir John, Sir William: and Croydon immediately behind, who in turn were succeeded by Valentino, The Pearl, Prietor, Glencoe, Trump Card, and Barbarian, Lapdog and Kimblefoot as yet remaining with the ruck. ' In this way the lot ran to- -the old grand' stand,' where Prostor, the Duke of Montrose and the.two Baronets were beaten. Between here and the abattoirs Giehcoe's colors were borne con spicuouslyin the front rank, whilst The Pearl also made ah effort , to reach the leaders, , and was occupying a good position. It was here that Nimblefoot began to move forwards, and Lapdog might be discerned p assing various ' beaten horses, Tim Whif fler at the time being about eighth in the race, the only favorite who had not succeeded in parking with the ruck being Trump Card; who was already out of the race!r Barbelle Had resigned' the lead before the abattoirs were passed, and on leaving the1 sheds some half dozen horses alone appeared to b6 left in the race. At the half mile : post Nimblefoot '? went to the front and: Glencoe ; dropped i back. Lapdog also put on extra pressure; and; took second place/ Glencoe and Valentine being next together. -Then came ' Croydon, while: Tim Whiffler was rapidly coming up; - Rounding the 'last; turn- Lapdog !got on terms with Nimblefpbt arid held a ^trifl ing lead for'1 a^'few' yards, '- when: the pair set to : work; together and raced home head and heady cleanaway fxomlthe rest of the fields Nimblefoot being declared the win* ner by, a short headj: after a most determined finish, Valentine a;|bad third, -some four lengths away, Croydon finishing fourthj -.' about 'half a: length before Tim Whiffler, Ulericoe cantering in next two lengths from Tim.
