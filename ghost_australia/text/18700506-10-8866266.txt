PASTORAL OF HIS LORDSHIP THE BISHOP OF HOBART TOWN. We have been requested to publish the following Pastoral of His Lordship the Bishop of Hobart Town " to the Catholic Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Hobart Town," written from Rome, and published in the last number of the Tasmanian Catholic Standard - Di any He sorry Bmiiiri near an audience of the 1 foly I tiller which I had the honor of receiving on the 31st of January last, and in which their Lord ships of Buslinie, Goulburn, Adelaide, met Armidale assisted, I had the pleasure of presenting your address and Peter's Pence (212) His Holiness most grief ously accepted both, and promised to honour me in due course h Uli i v, nilen reply to the address On looking over this latter which 1 unfolded before him, he expressed his admiration of its beautiful execution, and when informed that it was the work, not of professional artists, but often a young gentlemen, natives of the Antipodes of Rome who thus employed their leisure hours, he seemed deeply affected, and placing his hand on my life said " I must get you some mementoes of mc for these good young men, who in such a remote part of the world have shown so great devotion to my person and office ' He then left me for a short time, and, having gone into an inner room, he returned with two beautiful cameos of the Blessed Virgin set in gold, which he asked me to present to them with us so ci it is same Struck by this unexpected and extraordinary condescension on the part of the Supreme Pontiff, and by that sweet affa highly which claims all who approach him, I received on my knees, and not without considerable emotion, those precious gifts which I shall take care to have safely conveyed to their fortunate owners One would naturally think that, occupied as he is with the varied and weighty concerns of the Ecumenical Council of the Vanean, he would scarce have a thought beyond that all important event, but it is not so with Pius the Ninth His paternal he tri, great as it is good, has the kind word and the kind act for everyone who does him the slightest service Mr Leventhorpe Hill and Mr Kelsh will no doubt appreciate the honor thus conferred upon them, and which I trust will augury for them a bright future which I cordially wish them both It is also in the fulness of his generous disposition and considerate ness that the Holy 1 athel has provided of his own cost princely accommodation for many of the 1 athel of the Council, whose limited means would not allow them to defray the expenses of a long journey to Rome, and of a pi it acted residence in the Eternal City, thus placing those who have availed of this generosity) amid a deep debt of gratitude to him. It has, Dearly Beloved Brethren, given me great satisfaction and contributed to complete that happiness which a residence in Rome at this juncture is calca heed to confer to learn that ) on ne availing yourselves so generally thoughout the Diocese of the blessings of the Jubilee You could scarcely be occupied on any work more acceptable to God and more conducive to human happiness than that of assisting by your prayers and other good works the great Council of the Vatican, engaged as it is in dev using remedies for the city pation of infidelity and indifferentism, and for the greater extension of God 's kingdom on earth Nor, you may rest assured, will this great Council, guided and directed by the light of the Holy Ghost, disappoint the hopes reposed in it by the Christian world It may be safely said, that never before as may Council was the Universal Church so amply represented as it is in the General Council of the Vatican, fur excepting the very few Bishops indeed whom illness or other grave necessity has caused to he absent, the heads of the entire Catholic Church are now congregated within the majestic walls of S. Peter's. The thousands of the faithful of almost every clime and colour, who have had the good fortune to witness the assemblage of the Fathers of the Council robed in full episcopal costume on the day of public sessions, have ! acknowledged it to be the most interesting and impos- ing spectacle which the human imagination could conceive, or the human eye rest upon. Nor, Dearly Beloved Brethren, is it for any slight cause, nor could it be by any other earthly potentate, save the Vicar of Christ Pius the Great-that so many rulers of God's church- Cardinals, Patriarchs, Primates;' Archbishops and Bishops, could be assembled together, as they are, from every part of the inhabited globe. There is no nation, no people, no tribe, from pole to pole, and from the rising to the setting sun, that has not its representatives here representatives who are as remarkable for ability and learning, as they are for zeal for God's greater glory. The object, Dearly Beloved Brethren, as you are already aware, for which this Council has been con- asked, is to extirpate the fatal errors of the day is to put forth in stronger light those eternal truths which the enemies of religion are endeavouring to obscure, nay even to extinguish and to reaffirm and inculcate those principles of justice and christian morality which form at once the basis and prop of true c'tviluution, and by which alone modern society can be saved from degenerating into a state of barbarism. These vitally important subjects are receiving the most patient consideration of the Fathers.. They are discussed in all their varied party and minutest details with that freedom and earnestness which a conscientious desire of promoting the general good of mankind could alone inspire. Four hours every day during four days in the week have been thus far employed in this work by the general congregations of the Council. Every one who chooses is not only allowed but invited to express his opinion with the utmost liberty, and to give the benefit of his knowledge and his experience to his assembled brethren. The Latin tongue, long since adopted by the church as her own, and perfectly understood by all, is alone used in those discussions and so eloquent are some of the opinions delivered in that ancient tongue, so pure and classic the style, such the fluency, and so powerful at times the effect produced, that one occasionally fancies he is hearing a living language, and listening to some celebrated orator of the Roman forum. When the subjects under discussion are exhausted, the opinions of each speaker on it are taken down by reporters, and referred for consideration to a deputation orcommitteeof Iwenty-fourmcmbeisclcctcd by the Council itself from its own body, and whose duty it is to shape them into canons and decrees, which however, before they can acquire the force of [ law, must again be referred first to the Council and faintly to the Pope, to obtain their approval. I do I not know of any assembly so admirably regulated nor 1 better calculated to achieve the object it has in view I and hence, whilst it is the source of hope and conti I deuce to the christian world, it is the source of few and a butt for calumny and misrepresentation to the enemies of religion, whose inventions are such as nothing but inveterate hostility to all that is good and holy could devise. It must be a source of sincere pleasure to all men of the Irish race, whether at home or abroad, to know that among the Fathers of this great Council, there is no nationality, save that of Italy alone, more numerously or more respectably represented than our own. Some eighty Bishops, Irish born, or of Irish parents, testify by their presence to the undying and wide-spread faith of their fathers and I think, I do not err in saying that scattered though they are over the face of the globe, whether serving God's church in Ireland, in America, in Australia, or in Africa, they yield to nobody in zeal for their flock, in profound and varied knowledge, and in thorough and devoted attachment to the See of Peter, and to one of the most illustrious of his successors, the great Pope Pius the Ninth. Throughout this work, which is now two months in operation, he enjoys the best health and spirits; and let us hope and pray that he, who has so auspiciously inaugurated this Council and surrounded it with unrivalled splendour, may live to bring it to a successful issue, and witness its beneficial results. Finally, Dearly Beloved Brethren, knowing as you do that the Holy Father has been sacrilegiously robbed of the largest and most flourishing provinces of his dominion, and seeing that he has been thus deprived of the means necessary for supporting the dignity of his position and providing for the efficient government of the Universal Church, you will, I am quite assured, when the matter is placed before you, form yourselves into well organized associations for an annual collection of Peter's Pence. This is an obligation which I feel we owe it to ourselves to undertake as faithful members of the Church and loving children of our Holy Father ; nor is this obligation of such a nature as to press heavily even on the poorest member of the flock, for all that is required of each one, is to contribute but one penny in the year. I therefore take this opportunity of intimating to the faithful pastors and people of my Diocese that a Peter's Pence Association will be established among them on the Feast of S.S. Peter and Paul, the year of grace 1870, and that the proceeds will be transmitted to Rome by the end of the year. For the rest, Dearly Beloved Brethren, whatever things are true, whatever modest, whatever just, whatever holy, whatever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think of these things, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. Philippians 1 v. I \+ DANIEL MURPHY, Bishop of Hobart Town. Given at Albany, near Rome, February 9th, 1876.
