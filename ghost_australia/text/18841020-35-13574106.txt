SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. ? i VICTORIAN AMATEUR TURF CLUB. SECOND DAY. BY TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR. SPECIAL REPORTER,) MELBOURNE, SUNDAY. Although the weather had a threatening appearance on Saturday, the sky cleared as the morning wore on, and a fine cool day made amends for the unpleasant weather on the previous Saturday The numerous trains were well crowded and excellently managed, whilst the road was patronised by vehicles of every description, and before the flag was lowered for the great event of the meeting, the crowd was the largest that was over seen at Caulfield The grand stand was not able to accommodate half its intended patrons, and now that the club has taken its place as the second best in the colony, Mr Bond must not lose time in having it extended to at least twice its present proportions His Excellency the Governor and suite were present, and the attendance was one of the most fashionable that has ever assembled in the colonies The excellent catering by Mr H Skinner reminded one of the days of yore at Randwick, when genial host O'Brien used to attend to the comforts of the inner man, and the luncheon could not have been improved upon Warnockio's military band discoursed a doleful selection of airs, but it is located too far from the grand stand to give the occupants a tendency to mel intholy-the Cup race did that most effectually Later on the Press box was rushed, and the reporters had to take their notes as best they could Miles and Tumult were the most noticeable withdrawals from the Selling Race, for which Stone Broke a brother to Ringmaster, and the in and out-running Castaway were most in favour , but Mistake, who Is by Dante, and was bred on our side, working his way to the front early in the race, won easily Ontario and Dawdler were scratched for the Hurdle Race, and GaBaher was installed first favourite, while several, guided by the scratching of Ontario, followed his stable companion Hazard, and so landed their money The some idea gave a line about the Nursery Handicap, for when Ringmaster was scratched, affectionate eyes were cast on his stable mate, The Teacher However, Violet had the honour of holding the favourlteBhip but failed to got a place, and The kicker, Wolseley, and Dusty finished a rattling race with only heads between them The J eachor w is trained by James Wilson, jun and is by Gang Forward from 1" tully Tints ful (imported), by Lecturer from Lydia, by Lacydos from sister to Stafford by Young Melbourne, and was bred by Sir Thomas Elder in South Australia. He is a good looking colt, and when a three year old, will be pounds better than anything that started The 28 numbered on the card were saddled for the Caulfield Cup The sun shone out brightly as Boolka, who was the first to leave the paddock, stepped on to the course, followed by Flying Jib Then followed a great stream of bright colours, and the two favourites were eagerly scanned Colstoun

on the Hat Malta's performance in finishing fourth was a great o o, and must put him in the Melbourne Cup a t r long way Martini- Henri and Despot looked well but the former had a w rming bandage on his lot, which did not encourage confidence Hastings Jtiapid, Claptrap, "lately Lord Wilton, Helene, Lavington, Jjnttftloun, Yernet, Privateer, Blink Bonny, and Ringwood were not in good form and

Battnilous but the grey had run himself out when half-a-mile from home, where Lavington Battalions and Rapid were also in difficulties Blink Bonny, who had held a good position all the way, ran to the front at the entrance to the straight, and turned into it with the race in hand while a great roar from the crowd proclaimed the fact that the fail notes were out of the battle, for the colours of Fryingpan, CoUtoun, Martini Henry.,, and Hastings were lost in the ruck! and little % orgy was the only one of those that had been heavily backed who hold anything like a dangerous position Unee their

However, the men in all shapes, and the victory of this the greatest outsider that has come to the front for many years was most welcome to the bookmakers whose gains must amount to tens of thousands Very few laid on her, and who was generally regarded one of the least likely to win V ht-n she returned to scale there was only a faint cheer except from the men, who truly roared, not because the
