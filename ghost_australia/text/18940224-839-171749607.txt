So, we stared into each other's faces, half dead. with fenr; the air was suddenly filled with., the sound of laughter, and a voice from besidojus exclaimed — ., '.|fDa,ughtt!r of earth, the Indian holds many s ^rotainhis breast, tho reMiit of many lives ; ir.i I tho .astral body is not as tho earthly bo.'.y.

''Hallo,- what the douce is up now? You women look as if/you'd seon Lady, Muoboth's own speciiil ghost.' ? ' Oh, George,- such a dreadful man in tho garden — an Indian — and I believe ho's the same who came; to our housu in Tasmania tho year poor Will ran oit' to Melbourne;' and thereupon bugnn a duet betwoen my mother and 1110 as we.; tried to relate tho wonderful thins; to George. Ho. sat up and said : ' l'hew ! By Jingo, the same old card who told me I should soon be his, though how I cannot say. Certainly lie's a rum specimon — ugh! (looking round) I feel as if tho beggar was hero now.' A soft sigh from tho corner by the piano made us all three turn towards that part of room, when a sardonic laugh and — ' Good- night, my friends, remember tho magic of India isnot dead or impotent so long us her sons livo on tho fiic.e of tho earth. Rest. I go now. When next I coino you will know more. Good-night.' For once Georgo throw bis arm around mo in a kindly way. ' Awful, old girl, isn'titf If that fellow's not the devil himself be is his chief officer. No wonder you both look scared. By Jove, I'll linvo to take a glass of brandy myself bo fore I gut the sound of it out of my cars.' After this mother was in a continual fright aud worry, so obeyed my father's summons home all the more readily, for she -was a wutuun whose watch- word was ' duty,' and well did sho carry it out to the end. Two years piwseij oyer in utter misery and constant humiliation for mo. Prinking, swearing, gambling, racing — fast »\ every way, George led the life he loved best, and soon got through what money he had from his fctfier.

Ho turned aud acowlod, but noror a word. Honoo forward my lifo ran smoothly. I had a fow frionds— my books, my piano, my pamt-box, and last and ehiufest joy of all I had my blessed boy. His sweet voice cheered nio ; for him I grow merry again ? for him' I sans; and danced over tlio houso and up and down tho garden paths. I was his com panion and playmate ;. hisfriond and adviser, later on, and, ho— -. Ah, ho was my .inmost oy ! Infinitely more preoioun tlmiijiny own lifo was this 0110 which drow -all its jlifo from nio, '?vvliioh- was 'so fascinating in its dinging, helpless dependence on ine^— nay, I could not hAvo lived 'had it not been' for, the infinito delight and euro my boy was to mo. ? '-? '?''.?? ?- .??:?? .-. :] So God gives us women mother-hearts, 'and m.tuo oxpenunco thus gamed teaches us liis great truths aud lessons and draws us ovor up ward and onward' towards :that spirituaUifo which so nearly siu- rounds us. I tried to learn all I could of- that lifo ho that I niii,'ht bb tho moro fitted to lead and teaoh my son in all goodness, purity aiid holiness, and so tho timo passed on. , My mother was now living with me. Dear soul, she had: gone, through much. A few mouths of ter my Gcoil'ry .was born my father disappeared in ;n most uncanny way. I bad , been on a visit to Tasmania and was there at tlio time. An Indian hawker canio 0110 day mid my father lifted his whip to strikoihiiii' for daringto pester tho houso with his wares,' when tho Indian lifted his hand and littered 1 sentence in a foreign laiiguag'e. My father looked scared and turned iiwiiy with a curse, liid fur several days afterwards walked about looking half duzud, spoke gently oven lovingly to my mother, undone day, after kissing her jently on tho cheek, saying : 'Lio down and rest, Agnes wifio, whilo.I go out with tho dogs for a bit.' ? '?' He wont out, and though search was liiado far and near no ono has ever heard of or seen liim sinco. After waiting for nearly a year, lioping against hope, mother camo over to mo and my boy, und of all thu households in Akaroa ours was, I am sure, tho most happy and restful, save when tho memory of tho In- ; diuu's awful und mysterious words or the faint echo of tho ill-doings of the scapo-graco husband uro wafted to us ; no cloud dimmed our sky; all was peaceful and eabn, and I wondered and wondered how any woman could every deem tho lovo of a man of liny consequence, especially when she has so sweet a gift as a little Heaven-sent soul with its snowy purity to lovo and to train. So ends the first part of my story, com mon-plttco enough. Hundreds of girls marry without loving men whom they loiitho in tho intimacy of daily lifo ; hundreds of wives are ill treated ; hundreds deserted ; hundreds havo baby boys or girls to love, and the common, overy-day lot of womankind comes to them and is a crown of joy or a crown of thorns, and no ono cares, for women benr and suifer in silcneo — their timo is not yet. ? . I havo suid little about anything but the circumstances moro intimately . connected with my own lifo. I havo said nothing of. tho death of tho old man, Barton, who, long bofore bis death, recognised how baso and cruol bis son was and what n wretched sneri fiuo hud been made of mo. Tlio old man died in my arms, blessing mo as his only comfort for years, and his last words woro a whispered prayer for forgiveness. Ho had that for givoncss, and ho knew that it was from my heart. ? — ?'. — . I have said littlo' of my poor brother who ran the race of wickedness and brought sor row and disgruco on us all. Sorrow and diu» grace are not subjects wo lovo to dwell on, and if they haro to be painted it is not by tho hand of ono that has to bear thu load. My share of sorrow was great, but the dis^raco was not miuo, though I shared in it. What a different world would it bo if wo weromudo responsible for tho -deeds of- our own hand alone ! CHAPTER X. ALICE CONTINUES HEB NABItATIVE. ? Tlio years glided quietly by ; littlo or no thing occurred p) disturb the oven tenor of our way. Then my sjyeot mother wont tf- her rest and her home, but she promised mi- she would always guard and watch over her child, which I know she does. Life became quieter, and would have boon for mo infinitely lonely nnd sad had it .not been for my bright boy, Geofi'ry, now twelve years old ; s.o fhpughtful und companionuhln ; so strong and s# merry, and not the sjmiileijf. of his virtues in his mother's eyes-^tho fact of his entire devotion to thai mother.
