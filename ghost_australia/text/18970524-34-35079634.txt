A.R.C. QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY MEETING. A SUCCESSFUL OPENING DAY. BRILLIANT WEATHER, GOOD AT TENDANCE AND EXCELLENT SPORT. CITY HANDICAP WON BY THUNDERER. Once again have the Adelaide Racing Club scored a genuine success on the opening day of their Queen's Birthday meeting, and much as rain is needed throughout the colony at large the patrons of the turf were pleased to nave it fine on Satur- j day, and it is needless to say that the secretary and committee of the club were also glad to J find the afternoon so favorable for a big gathering and genuinely good sport What was particularly noticeable on Saturday was that visitors continued to arrive as they reached the city by train or tram from the suburbs right up to the time of starting for the City. Handicap, shoiriojr tuat trben tiro big events are combined, like the Handicap and Cup, great numbers of people have an interest in them. Another thing, too, timt is having a marked effeetupontheattendances is thefriendly rivalry between the metropolitan clubs, by which large sums of money are being annually expended in improvements. These are of such a nature that they not only add to the com fort and convenience of visitors, but elicit their admiration also. ..The. Old Course is known also as "the people's, course," because it is actually the property .of the citizens; and. a, very valuable asset it will be to the corpora tion when a few years hence, at the expiration of Mr. Bladder's lease the club will be paying £800 a year rental into [ the city cotters. By that tune also a new members' stand will iiave bees erected and probably a pavilion or pagoda for the ladies on.thexmter Uwn. - The place will in fact be-^-as one' of tbe committee men described it on Saturday—a pleasure garden for the citirens,. ..-The general public have no idea of the time: and attention that is absorbs! from members of^ the committee in the work of running a racing club, md where tbe^denelopmenSeareso gradual and so per manent as those which axe now taking place it behoves the committee and secretary to well consider their plans beforehand, and then to see that they are well carried oat The most critical visitor could only be pleased with-what there was to;be seen on Saturday, and'the fair box were 'nostintmK'm their ex pressions of approval at what had been done tor them jn beautifying their retiring rooms and providing them with a spacious marquee for their afternoon tea. From the improve-' mentsat the members' entrance gate theeyefell, upon a most inviting picture, tbe variegated' flowerbeds and liordersvtteiflg alive with color and the lawn itself conspicuously green and fresh. "Owing to 'the intense dryness of the Beaaon tbe centre of die course was compara tively brown and dry, but the running track -was in capital order. In the unavoidable absence p£ the Governor Captain Waflinprton represented the viceregal party, and wnonga* the visitors were the Hon. C. E. Davies, M.L.C., of Hobart, and Dr. Smith, and Messrs. Skinner, Reynolds, and Samuels, of Melbourne. The -caterer, Mr. Purvis, provided a capital luncheon, and the afternoon tea was a pronounced success. The grand stand and Derby enclo sures were well patronised, but die atten dance was hardly-e^ual to the same <Jayt>f last year, many persons being "engaged in (tec-, tioneering. The sum of £12,609 went through the; totalizator, bein* £2,000 lessSthanon the corresponding afternoon ot last year. The biggest dividend of the day was £13125^ paid by the winner of the City Handicap. The only icasaaJty during tbe'afternoon was the downfall of Havelock in the Hurdle Race. The %or6e~never rose strain, and it is supposed that his neckvfas broken. Luckily his rider, Arnold Ferry, escaped unhurt. Mr. Ferryl only purchased the-jboise about a week ago for ! 70%u$s6aSj ',ao that^it fiprrjriily bail luck Ito lose'4nm--befo£e %c -ifeS %fme to win a'race. ? i During the intervals the Locomotive Band, j with Herr L. popfj R.CALL., as conductor, ' performed the foUowrog selections of music :— i March,, "VPsur la i patrirf' ) (DpatJ;, ovenure, "Italian! in Algieri^ (Rojsmij; valse, "Estu diantira" >(WildtieM);.^p<?lka, -<*Paul and VKgmia" iJtoood); .selection, "BitKaletto"] march,- JMWasniugtonpostn^SoaQsa);' "God save the - Queen."

' \- ? - {ByMmoriL} The A.S.C. ? were favored -with glorious weather for the opening of the Birthday meet ing, a day on which cumbersome wraps could be dispensed .with, ?nd with -no sign of the long-looked for rain which has since fallen. With the Adelaide Cup such ateoentevenband so many charming frocks on view there it was hardly to be expected that even Fashion's most ardtnt devotees wogld have a double array again for , the. Birthday fixture. Nevertheless the lady patrons of the. sport presented a well and elegantly dressed'spec tacle on Saturday. The committee, with a due consideration for the^fair sex, -base ex tended the lawn considerably, and the flower beds were in beautiful order. The pot plants and artistic arrangement of greenery at the end of the stand,, too, Ind iah unsightly corner. Bat while thaukimr the ener getio .secretary on behalf of my fashion able ..sisterhood for all the forethought bestowed on us for our comfort, may I first whispers, word, of; one mace improvement yet to be made, And one which by the way appeals in a small measure to the sterner sex too. This is tbe horribly dusty condition of the seats both on the lawn and in the stand. They are always coated pretty thickly with dust, and as each new frock comes along it bears all .too apparent traces of this little defrtrtin the- minor-arrangements-of the club. I'm quite: sore if Mr. Heaeltine could only, hear one half of the anathemas poured down on his 'unsuspecting head he ?would rectify this little fault White on the subject of fashion I am pJeaaeS to note that amonetb* " superior" ?ax there is a growing favor towards the orthodox frock coat and tall hat. Tfiey certainly are a much more fitting accompaniment to the pretty rracka of "their sister and their .cousins and their aunts" than the every day sac coat and straw or felt hat.- However, I fancy they are slowly bat surely {growing into popoUrity. though the masculine mind on a racecourse is usually occupied with more serious questions than that of fashion) and-it does-not clsim a large amount of their attention. Bat 1 must not deal at too great, length with, the subject with the Cup so-near at fund, though judging by the steady downpour of rain which wears enjoying whilelwrite my descriptive powersdo not stand in danger of beur severely taxed over Monday's events. But dear as the display of her frocks and millinery is:to -the fenuatine mind, we are all quite willing to forego that' display and enjoy th? rain.

THE RACING. 'The afternoon's racing opened with tbe Auction Stakes, for which 15 runners went to the post The Melbourne party selected Golden Fleece as a good thing-, and backed the 'mare very freely. She was in a galloping; humor, and just succeeded in getting borne by i a sose in front of Kaae, Cigarette being a: length away third. The favorite paid tbe small dividend of £2 18., and on bong sab jnttted to auction thero was some spirited bidding for her. until she was -knocked down to the nod of Mr. Alec Nicholson for 70 guineas. The winner was ridden by H. Holmes, and Hodgkins on Kase made the! mate's supporters *'quake in their shoes" as the competitors were coming on to the winning post At tbe start Maid of: the . Mist broke through the barrier, while Lord Melbourne on the contrary would i not face it, and was left behind. 3> -would-be as well if netting were placed in the ropes, the same as at Flemington, and then the horses would not be able to get through. The-Bardie race brought out a field of 8 runners, and in die betting Jack Sprat, Simu lator, and General Gordon were almost equal favorites. Two noises came to grief at the second jump, Nalpa and Havelock falling. The former was remounted, but Havelock was kflled. General Gordon and Jack Sprat made most of the running just in advance of Simu lator, who ran very gamely an a weak leg? and answered his rider's call on the hill, but the pace was made too strong for him, and be gave place to TJ.Z. whom Howie brought up -with a strong ran in pursuit of tbe leaders, and be cat diem down in the straight, winning by half a length from EiroboTton who came np strongly at the finish, Jack -Sprat being half a dozen lengths arway third. The Catrinetoc-street stable seems to be ouf. of luck lately, but not from want of .condition, as Jack looked very well when be went out Mr. Stock's U.Z. has proved his usefulness and value on several occasnmsnow and be paid his supporters on Saturday the handy dividend of £1118s. For the big erent/rf.the day, the City. Handicap, the- scratching board dis played only one absentee, thepen having been pat through the name of Boyal Admiral. This left 18 runners to go to the post, and: their condition was eagerly scanned by their respectise supporters as they .were undergoing their 'toilettes in the paddock beneath jthe trees.

Queen Consort, the dam of Thunderer, was bred in rengl*?* in 1875, got by St Albans, her dam Queen Elizabeth, being by Autocrat from Bay Rosalind, by Orlando from Elopememt, by Velocipede from j Scandal by Selim. Unfortunately for Mr. Bladder Queen Consort died a season ago, but Thunderbolt ia still in the height of his success as a sire. Mr. Purvis refused an offer of 2,000! guineas for Thunderer some little time ago. The Adelaide Stakes brought out a field of six runners, only,, and Orpah was selected as a better thing than Thunder King for this event i The winner, however, turned up in our selec tion, Mr. David James's TaJiesin, ?rhom Matron steered home to victory, with Thunder King and Firelock in the positions.' Mr. James's colors have not been been first past the post for some time now, and his victory was therefore all the more gratifying. The backers of the gelding received a dividend of £5 19s. There were eight competitors in the Selling Steeplechase, Evanstoo Being established a strong favorite. Tbe speedy StockineE, however, was in a jumping humor, and had no difficulty in keeping in the. van when once the straight was entered for home. Tbe son of Hamlet's Ghost, by the aid of J. Kain in the saddle, won very comfortably, and when submitted to auction his -owner had to pay. 100 guineas to get him hack. He paid a dividend of £4 &. The places were tilled by Evanston and Lubra. During the | race Tbe Oak and Wilpeoa fell and Deburg stopped, but their riders got off with a scar or two and a, shaking. The Farkside Stakes created some interest in the I meeting of the* Melbourne cracks, and Lieutenant was installed a somewhat better favorite than Acton. The latter won, how-; ever, with Lieutenant and Loyalty in the places, with Staffs, fourth in frpnt of Response.
