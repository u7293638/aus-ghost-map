ARRIVAL or THE Be( LISE MAIL. By the RMS. Cartilage, which armed yesterday morning, we have our London correspondence and lies to the 23rd March. The following are portions of our correspondent's latter . TOPICS OF THE WEEK. fjrUOM QtW OWN OOBJUBPONIJILNT ) LONDON, MARCH 23 The week has been marked by a new sensation. The attack on Lady Florence Dixie, of which you will have heard by wire, has since Sunday passed through all the downward stages from that which is terrifying and alarming to that which in merely curious and ,*.,er»»t¡u« What was originally represented as a murderous outrage of the most shameful and cruel character, and the work of the Fenian conspirators, has now almost passed into the realms of fable. The friends of the lady and the lady herself are not on. naturally indignant at the more recent direc- lion of popular opinion, which Gnda accurate reflection is a chapter on " Female HaUncnia tions yesterday published in the British JUedicalJoumaL. There is no desire to an pate to Lady Dixie u want of bona fides It is evidently of the essence of an hallucination that the truth of the circumtances should be firmly held by the vestry, and there is no bad faith in affirming; the absolute reality of the occurrence imagined, or in Bin king to it when the thing is questioned So much must be conceded in favour of Lady Dixie She has antecedents which help us to be generous. The lady herself has ridden through the wilds of Patagonia on horseback, and told the story of her adventure!) in that remote region She proceeded to Zululand and took up the case of Cetowuyo, teen clsitimiK to be restored to his native kraal I and latterly she went to Ireland to help the ~" Land League Here her offers of alliance were rejected!, for what reason is not very clearly understood, and since then she has had sheen revenge in commenting upon missing sum of £150,000 "lost in the Land League accounts in other ways tina active lady has achieved much notoriety, It is said of her that she once horsewhipped an innocent gentleman found fishing on her domain At Windsor, and it is on record that she withdrew from the Court of St. James's because she quarrelled with the Lord Cham berlin as to the portentous question of wearing " plumes," which were not to Lady Duff's taste. The Douglas family have all of them made a name for eccentricity. The Marquis of Queensberry the head of the house, and the brother of Lady Florence Dixie is a great patron of the noble art of self defence ' He is by profession an " agnostic," which the plain Scottish people call an atheist, and only recently he was deprived of his seat in the House of Lords by the Scottish peers. Since then he has appeared at the Globe Theatre to denounce the Lanreate's " Promise of May, in which the opinions of the Free Outlier were, as he said, held up to vulgar caricature His lordship's brother is at the other pole on theological matters, having Viorne years ago gone over to the church of stone This gentleman has also somewhat of a name He established, and has since engaged, in the interests of his church, a home for boys at Paddington. On the area Eton of taking the foundation stone of the chin of the home, certain of the inmates were sprinkled with water from the holy well of Lourdes, and one, who was an epileptic in a had state, as it was represented, immediately began to walk A miracle was declared to have been wrought, and but for the intervention of the doctor of the institution, who wrote to say that he had been expecting the boy to walk for days previously, this event might have been added to the other unimpeachable funds of such circumstances. Quite lately elder sister of Lady Florence, who had been engaged in the management of the home with her brother, took it into her head to marry the boy baker of the establishment, to the (great scandal of "society," and to finish up the story, it may he recalled that the Dowager Marchioness of Queensberry was years ago remarkable for the pecuniary B88i3t since and the gushing letters and regularly sent to certain the patriots" of the old school It is to matters of this kind, as much as to the absence of evidence of the perpetrators of the supposed outrage, that popular opinion concerning this event is due While on the subject for me say briefly that we have no intimation of any discovery which would throw light upon the perpetrators of the outrages in Whitehall and at The Times office in the former case the experts have given it as their opinion that some 10lb of dynamite was used, that it was enclosed in a metal case, and probably in ted by clock work, the explosion having taken place on the stroke of 9 at night. The explosive matter found at 'Jli' Times office has been subjected to careful examination, had has been declared to be of foreign and not of English make. This last mentioned fact Mvea point to the statement that the police are convinced that the foreign refugees of the socialist type now in this J country are in some sort privy to recent out' rages It has been noticed that within the last week there has been much hurry-scurry in the socialist quarters here, and that close communication has been maintained between these and the Fenian rendezvous It is understood, moreover, that a gang of some 'half dozen desperadoes had latterly arrived in London from the United States A few strokes of the Irish Crimes act would be a valuable adjunct to the powers of the police at the present moment, the detectives being paralysed by the necessity of keeping within the strict letter of the law in the circumstances the Government have obtained the course of some of the most experienced men of the Dublin police, and the whole strength of be land yard is at work to reach the con Biurators Parliament h as been for the Easter Mon day)?, and there is consequently little to chronicle in that direction Last week's time will have given you some account of the remarkable encounter between Mr Gladstone and Mr Forster on the Transvaal debate, which is still unfinished Mr Forster made a powerful plea for the protection of the Bpcuhnim chiefs, and accompanied it with such an attack on the Government as roused the Conservatives to a pitch of the wildest enthusiasm The reply came from the Prime Minister III a speech which will be cometh beted even among some of Ina beat It was in every sense a remarkable effort He refused point blank to undertake another military expedition in South Africa, and was particularly severe upon " the manor war who was at the same time Quaker and a man of peace Mr Gladstone adhered to the announced intention of the Government to pension and find a new loud Son for such of the chiefs as could be considered to have a claim upon us but beyond that he refused to move in the slightest degree It is unfortunate for the Opposition that. they have no alternative policy to offer, and that the country is against any warlike proceedings such as Mr Forster demands as to the late Chief Secretary he has done himself considerable harm with his friends and his chance of being again included in the P'Mimt Cabinet is fading fast The resignation of the post of President of the Council by Lord Spencer was taken indicate that the Government were at last school to listen to the cry of " the country tall, and establish a Ministry of Antient here Something of this sort has indeed was fine, though in a partial sort of fashion Anyhow Lord Carlingford, whohaaaueceeded Lord Spencer at the Privy Council office has "an charged with all matters concerning the »««.ultoral interest [We have had lately Rence by cable that a Department of Agri- she has been formed with the Right Hon J G) Dodson as Minister Another project for creating a special department for Scotch stones has not been so favourably received, iMURh the matter is still for decision in connection with the appointment of a Lord Privy Seal in recent in to Lord Carlingford Lord Spencer is now a Cabinet Minister without portfolio The steady refusal of the Irish Executive to institute relief works for the peasantry suffering from the prevailing distress has brought down upon them answering the letter of certain members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, published this week, is as gross a misrepresentation BE any that have J recently come from across St George's Channel to any the Government seek to drive the suffering poor from their homes by the alternative of starvation or emigration to smart epigram, but it is not accurate seeing. that the workhouse is open with me the slightest restraint, and that there is room for 1 BOine 40,000 persons in the arena of the various districts If we are to be here the bishops the peasantry will neither emigrate nor migrate, nor go into the workhouse That is to say, they will not do any of these things if the bishops can help it Kcoigra'ion is the horror of the bishops, for reasons which do not stand in need of explanation, and the suffering ratepayer, who has done something in providing a system of poor law, must fork out still further for relief works It is a significant commentary on this attitude of the bishops, that whilst we. find them thus pleading the CABS of the poor -and their own-we see them appealing for subscriptions to the testimonial to Mr Parnell, which after some days has reached the magnificent figure of £500 ' But surprise does not Uniah bore 'the Irish bishops are credited with many virtues and with deep religious convictions Mr Parnell, it is true, is not of their fold, and it may be urged that in supporting his claims to the gratitude of his countrymen they are showing a generous and kindly toleration Neverlbele s, one would naturally suppose that they would revolt from a movement which called in to the assistance the most formidable enemies of their church Just now Mr Parnell is passing his holidays in the company of Mr Clement coan and Rochefort, who have promised, and already given him help We may probably trace this assistance in the release of' Walsh, the founder of the Irish Invincible Society at any rate, we know what influence the French Radical leader has with the Government of the Republic Our demands for the extradition of the Fenian conspirators some people speak of them in other terms-have failed all round, and it is understood that the Government will not pursue further the claims put forward Meanwhile we have another illustration of the way the " political murder " steadily works, in the investigation now being conducted at Belfast "The Patriotic Brotherhood which have been the terror of the < minties of Armagh and Monaghan was founded by an Irish American named Burn now probably quite safe in New York just us Walsh is said to have founded the " Irish Invincibles " Mr. Parnell has given up his projected visit to the States The abandonment of this trip may be accounted for by the statement that the managers of the Philadelphia Convention to which he was going have determined to proclaim the " existence " of the Irish Republic Mr. Parnell is a member of the House of Commons and has sworn allegiance to Queen Victoria' The libel suit instituted by the Messrs Chamberlain (brothers of the President of the board of Trade) against Mr Lennox Boyd, a member of the Reform Club, has fallen through. The defendant, proceeding by de- murder, objected to the trial of the action on the ground that no damage had been, done to the plaintiffs that could be assessed. This strategic "move" has succeeded, and the Court of Appeal has upheld the decision of the Court of First Instance It will be remembered that the Messrs Chamberlain, being candidates for election to the Reform Club There, were blackballed Previously, the defendant (Mr Boyd) had circulated in the club a story told him by Mr M'Cullagh Torrens, to the effect that in Adelaide the Messrs Chamberlain had conducted themselves in such a fashion that a movement had been started to expel them from a club of which they were members This was the libel complained of. The Chamberlains contended that it had got them blackballed at the Reform Club, whilst there blackballed at the Hot on oath, whilst most people regarded their rejection as the revenge of the Whig members of the club on Mr Joseph Chamberlain, the Radical pro- moter of the "caucus" In fairness to the Messrs Chamberlain it ought to be said that so stout a Tory as Lord Justice Brett (one of the judges who heard the demurrer) told them that they might well be content with the result of the matter, since the man who proceeded by demurrer made a distinct confession that he was unable to substantiate his libel The extensive military preparations of the French Government, and the arrest by the pi lies of some half dozen of the leading Gre brands of Paris, completely prevented the intended demonstration of the revolutionary party on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Commune M Jules Terry now occupies a position such as no other recent Prime Minister of France has been able to achieve Sir G JOÍBBI, who died on Wednesday, was perhaps the most competent lawyer on the English judicial bench He was a Jew, and the best of his race who has sat on the bench of the Supreme Court in this country in the last days of his career at the bar his professional income averaged from £20 ODO to £23,000 a year THE DYNAMITE EXPLOSION Easter has come upon us with winds the coldest of the year Parliament has adjourned for a brief recess, having accomplished little more than the preliminaries of its work The chief question of the hour is still how to cope with the conspirators who have chosen dynamite and the diggers their weapons There is the greater difficulty in solving it inasmuch as the anarchists of all countries have a natural affinity, though their special aims may be different, and they unconsciously stimulate each other in action On the Continent they have shown a fanatical courage, and repeatedly risked death to achieve their object, here our safety seems to lie in the fact that they prefer to strike in the dark and to gloat in security over the destruction they may bring upon innocent people The subtle connexion between the extremest factions may be seen now in Paris, where Mr Parnell has been interviewing M Rochefort as well as M. Clemenceau and others by whom he has hoped Ki influence the French press There probably IB U considerable gulf between these men and the brotherhoods" WIIOBP outrages have startled the world, but the tendencies of their policy are III the same direction, and dangerously affect the conspirator! below them M Clement of her age to another grade , he is now forming a league to compel i remain of the constitution, in spite of the late Ministerial declaration and the subs quent vote, and his ability morUs him out HE a responsible leader of the future , he has moreover denounced anarchism, jet the ascendancy of ma policy would go far toward bringing in a revolutionary era The excitement caused by the explosion in Westminster has quickly subsided But no one can walk through London after dark now without observing the increased a: lance of the police There was H certain sense of security in our streets to a stranger who might notice the gradual abandonment in Home chief thoroughfares of the old fish boned system of shutters and the substitution of thick plate glass with hart, through which the savages within were almost us rntiBpiaunus by night and day But now the wayfarer himself will he scanned if he approaches any public building and he will see policemen stationed at every point commanding the adjacent streets and especially where the trade of the houses fall thickest The metropolitan police force in view of this divergence is to he immediately increased by "60 men, and a certain number of Irish do textiles will be brought over that London may have the advantage of their special knowledge Meanwhile the military authorities are lending assistance Precautions also have been taken in other towns, espy dally in connexion with the barracks and powder magazines The Government has offered a reward of £1,000 for any information which shall lead to the apprehension and conviction of the perpetrator of the outrage at the office of the Local Government Board I A young woman has come forward who states that she saw a man in the act of stooping down near the stone balustrade where the dynamite was exploded, and she has given a description of his appearance, but this Blender and uncertain ' clue ' is all that we hear of. The motive for attacking the Local Government Board in particular has not been made clearer ; it was thought that the building was perhaps mis taken for the Home Office with which the obnoxious Sir W, Vernon Harcourt is and stated, or that mischief was i ire, null s designed against the Premier's roi evidence, which is close by in Downing street, but the most probable explanation is the obscurity of this part of Charles street, which, though almost facing the police station whence the House of Commons is supplied, afforded shelter and opportunity to the i sp rator A most careful search was made among the splinters of the spot which had caught the full force of the explosion for traces of the vessel which contained the dynamite or its equivalent An export holding a horseshoe manner, nearly a foot long, knelt among the rubbish passing the manner close to the ground, but Lairds and forwards over every inch of open o within the immediate Brea suspected as likely looted the desired result Carefully, cautiously presently, the man of science tried and tried, slowly accumulating, little by little, atom of evidence stronger than that of an eyewitness the powdered lime, the fragments of masonry, and splinters of wood gradually) gave up microscopical Fragments of iron It may be said, with a near approach to certainty, that the explosive which did all this terrible mischief was held in a canister of tinned iron, and set free by a time fuse " Small pieces of the < inmates have since been picked our from the debris at the corners of the windows and from the stone- work above Professor Abel calculates that the maximum quantity of dynamite used was 201 h The attempt to blow up Ihr 'J'miei' office on the same evening has also been the subject of inquiry Professor A bel has analysed the contents of the box which was found, and reports that the material is precisely the same as that used in the explosion some weeks ago at the gasworks in UlnsEOW sheet-iron bandbox like cases were need in both outrages and the authorities have come, therefore, to the concliwontbat the attempts at both places were the work of the same organisation During the present week several alarming rumours have been very u lated as to other discoveries, but they have proved to have but slight foundation ATTACK ON LADT'ÍL'IRKNCE DIXIE No small sensation was caused, however, by the report that Lady Florence Dixie had been attacked near Windsor. She was struck down, it was alleged, by two assassins du guised as women, and armed with daggers or knives, and saved only by the intervention of a very powerful dog which she had with her Surely this is the war of dastards, was the first thought of our general public, followed quickly by wonder as to what outrage might next be tried This feeling was so lifted by later accounts The lack of confirmatory circumstances caused a doubt as to the actual facts, and alarm was succeeded by curiosity Nor can it be said that the mystery is yet cleared up In this state of affairs I cannot do better than give Lady Florence Dixie's own version of what occurred, as communicated to The rinse Let me premise that Sir Beaumont and Lady Florence Dixie reside at the Fishery, on the Berks shore of the Thames, two miles and a half above Windsor- The particulars are short, and I can write little because my bands are cut and painful I was out walking near the Fishery last evening about half-past 1 when two very tall women came up, and asked me the time I replied Miss I had not got my watch with me, and turning, left them Opening a small gate which led into the private grounds of Captain Brocklehurst, of the Blues, I made towards a idle and was just going to get over when I heard the gate open behind, and the two women followed me in Some how or other I felt all was not right no I stopped and leant against the rails, and then, as they came on, went to meet them One on the right came rapidly forward and seized me by the neck when by the strength of the church I felt it was no woman's power that pulled me down to the ground In another second I saw the other would be woman over me and remember seeing the steel of the knife come straight down upon me driven by this person's hand It pt nick through my clothes and against the whalebone of my stays which turned the point merely grazing the skin The knife was quickly withdrawn and plunged at-me again I seized it with both hands, and shouted as loud as I could, when the person who fired pulled me down managed a large handful of earth into my mouth and nearly choked me TURN" US the knife was wrenched from my hands a very big and powerful St Bernard dog I had with me broke through the wood, and the last thing I remember was seeing the person with the Life pulled backwards by him 'I how I heard a confused sound of rumbling of wheels and I remember no more When I came to myself I was quite alone from what I saw of the knife I believe it to be a dagger and the persons were undoubtedly men They were dressed in long clothes, and were unnaturally tall for women The one who stabbed me had on a thick veil reaching below the month, the other was unveiled, but his face I did not notice much This is all the information I can give. My head is a . indians and *-,a,,,f"1 earl T flf-nonf the, very confused and painful, and I expect they J must have stunned me. This is a wretched scrawl, but my hands are very much cut, and | it pains me much to write " The dog-keeper who met Lady Florence i Dixie, when she was making her way through the plantation, after regaining consciousness, I has made The following statement;-" I was coming to the garden, when I suddenly saw her ladyship walking along the plantation. It was about half-past ?!. Her mouth was a ranged with mud. I did not notice her lady. ship's hat or clothes, nor did I perceive that the gloves which she wore were out and her hands bleeding. I do not recollect that her ladyship said anything beyond remarking, I Two men have been trying to do for me.' I myself was so frightened al- her condition that I did not ask her for any details of what happened, but confined myself to getting her home as fast I could. She was in a very ex handled state-was trembling, and could I hardly lift her feet from the ground. Her ladyship looked no whit as a ghost, though usually she has plenty of colour in her face. I also noticed that her mouth, where the dirt I and appeared to be on sided. I got her indoors »n quickly no I could, she taking my [ arm during the remainder of the journey. When she entered the hall, she sank into a chair perfectly exhausted." Sir Beaumont Dixie say. that he first saw his wife in the hall on her return from the plantation on Saturday afternoon. She was so pale as death, and trembling from head to foot. He was perfectly satisfied that what she had described took place, for when she came in she was "all to pieces" H.e noticed dirt on the back fit her head, as if she had been on (the ground. Whether there was any mould on the dress he could not say. When Lady Florence was first brought into the hall there was no perceptible pulsation of her body, nor did her heart beat. He went the next morning with a superintendent of police to the spot where the struggle took place. There were traces on the ground. For in stance, he distinctly recollected noticing the : imprint of one foot, a large one, which was evidently that of a man, going around the | bush. The boot was nailed all around There were evidences that the ground had been disturbed. The imprint of the dog's paws could likewise he seen. At that point the ground rose slightly. The imprints of the feet would be about a quarter of an inch deep. It was only at the end of January last that he received a latter threatening him that if he did not keep his wife quiet he would have a hole through his skin. He had previously in Ireland received several threatening letters, and now whenever he went out he carried a " BIX shooter about with him Sir Beamont thinks the explanation of the assault u that it was intended for intimida- tion. Edward Aldrich, the butler to Sir Beaumont Dixie, made a statement to the following effect " On Saturday last, between 3 and half-past standing on the steps of the hall door, I saw two women, in light, loose clothes in the plantation They were stoop and apparently to back the primroses and violets to be found there but I noticed at the same time that they were constantly looking towards the house They stared very hard I noticed them there for fully five minutes They seemed to be rather stout and elderly The dresses which they were seemed to be a bit loose about the upper portion of their bodies They appeared 1 In ha crawling rather than picking up flowers They were both dressed oaks, but I cannot say that their garments were don's al That was the only occasion on which I saw them, but I should state that on the 19th of February I saw a man in the plantation picking flowers while there was a woman in the roadway walking abreast of him I fix the date by particular entries in my diary of expenses which I disbursed on that day She had a dark bonnet on, while the cloak was a dark loose and shabby one " As primroses and violets are in great request in the London market at this Benson, the facts of UM deposed to have in themselves no significance Apparently more to the point is a statement of Frederick Rowe a butler of Colonel Harford who was passing near the plantation He stopped to set a dog, when he suddenly saw within 100 yards of him two persons who looked to be women's some what extraordinary phrase, by the way They appeared so suddenly as to surprise him Looking round again, he saw that they were big women, and they were then close to the small gate leading to the spot where the attack was made On the other hand, the authorities are perplexed by a statement which has been made by Groves, the gardener in the employ of Captain Brocklehurst, of The Willows He alleges that at the time in question he was engaged in potting per annum) and other places at a distance of not more than 50 yards from the spot, but heard no sound whatever from the direction of the fence, and certainly saw no persons struggling on the ground Indeed, it was not until some time after that he became aware of the outrage that had been committed within so short a distance of where he was working. Mr. Pennicott, the proprietor of the burly hall Hotel were like wise on his premises at the rear of the house about a quarter to 5 The grounds slope gently down to the bank of the Thames, and from the point at which he stood he states that he could easily command a clear view of the spot who e the assault was made He too neither heard at by come nor witnessed 01 struggle had) Florence's mail has described the attack in b co she found her mistress when called to her and she was white as death , there was much on her face and on her teeth and gums The articles of clothing including the gloves which Lady 1 Florence Dixie wore have been examined at Scotland Yard The gloves are made of a very stout material and are used in addition On the right hand glove there is a big as cut nearly an inch and a half in length at a point where it would cover the fleshy side if the palm of the band the peculiar form for about the cut is its width in the ceniri-prohnbl) the seventh or e the of an inch and the irregular and jagged incision-the reverse of a clean cut such as one would expect from a sharp in si minent that the dagger has made On the inner lining of the glove blood stains are to be plainly detected, though not to such an extent as to justify the expression ' earn rated ' Judging by the appearance of the lining, the flow of blood must have been very slight indeed In the case of the left hand glove with which Lal) Florence says she first seized the descending blade, there is a fur cleaner cut, somewhere about three quarters of an inch in length In this case, too the cut occurs in an almost identical place in?, the fleshy part of the palm The lining of the left hand glove also reveals traces of blood, though to a somewhat less extent At the time when the outrage took place her ladyship had on a heavy blue serge dress The first stab in the area is to be seen high up above the bosom There is a salt fully two inches in length The weapon penetrated through the under linen in which the cuts are discernible, and apparently striking with some force against one of the steel ribs of the corset The point of contact IS marked by the tearing of the cotton on which the steel is encased The blow must have been one of considerable violence as the life after breaking the upper part of the army glanced off and struck the corset on the opposite side of the fastening The signs of the second stab that is said by Lady Florence to have been given are visible three inches and a half below the upper one, and in this case too the blade seems to have penetrated close to the fastening of the trees There are two distinct cuts quite close together The weapon seems to have passed through the dress, penetrated the linen beneath again struck the steel of the corset, and glancing off once more would seem to have gone in an oblique direction, making an incision in the flannel jersey which her ladyship wore beneath the corset and slightly grazed the skin The cat in the jersey is very clean one, and is fully half an inch in length Between the upper and lower out one of the buttons belonging to the dread has disappeared, while the edge of the dress very near to the place where the button should be is slightly torn' Lady Florence Dixie is unable to account for this year, and it is also somewhat dijKult to conceive how the blade, when it arrived off the corset at the second state, travelled as it did and pierced the jersey at so low a point Not the faintest trace of blood IS discernible on the jersey It were useless to disguise the fact that the whole story, as thus far tested, is regarded with very considerable incredulity So far has this gone that the British Medical Journal publishes an article on "Female Hallucinations," giving some authenticated illustrations and pointing the public to their application The subject is so personal and delicate that it cannot but be discussed with a certain reserve, yet it is necessary in the public interest that the actual facts should be known The police are perplexed, if not sceptical for they can get no clue to the advent of these two women in the neighbourhood, and supposing that the legume was donned in the fields, might not the men who carried it have been tracked' But then, too, man-, outrages have been perpetrated and no clue found till long after Would two murderers go so far, and not complete their bloody work' Might not Lady Florence have fallen, and been frightened . "She had brought a BONOUS accusation against the Land League might she not have feared the revenge of its miscreant friends ' Might not the Westminster explosion have quickened this feeling, and her reason suddenly have reeled under a false alarm ' But then what of the cuts in her dress All these questions and others have been debated nth more or less publicity It this affair be an attempt at anosssination, it is far too grave to be allowed to be forgotten Suppose there were any ' hal inclination anywhere, it would yet be one of the most remarkable COHOB on record Lady I lorance Dixie, though she has declined to see any doctor-" doctors she never sees' persists in every detail of her statement The eccentricities of the Rev. members of her family some of which have been recalled as psycho physical evidence must not be of use in) pressed against her Her own marked originality has been shown in many ways ; she is a woman of unusual intellectual power and courage In her first statement she bitterly reproaches the authorites for not doing, more to discover her assailants and declares her com action that they were not demand the theory that intimidation or a coarse practical joke was intended rather than murder save? the mystery of the circumstances almost as great Lady Florence Dixie went to Ireland some time since to study the land question She saw reason to distrust the I engineer and subsequently published a letter in The Times on the subject of the sun's named by that body Collecting from the Ft cents 11 Jam nal all accounts of moneys received and spent she obtained a total of £277 332 18s of which no less than 122 088 195 I remained army counted for the receipts of the league itself being £112 023 17s am and the scknow lodged expenditure only £17 13 0s 1d It is not implied accesories that there have been defalcations but if the money has been spent on legitimate objects why is not the information given Her ladyship s action in this matter might it was thought have made her enemies who now sought the peculiar reverse of the bastard ' brotherhood I Bhoi Id add that Lady I Forence is the youngest sister of the Marquis of Queensberry The Queen sent several times to inquire after her health the Prince of Wales wrote and hundreds of letters have since poured in on her expressive of sympathy, with some few of a threatening character COLONIAL TOPICS As the Victorian Government have agreed to the suggestion of the War Office to grant a salary of £1,000 a year, irrespective of the rent of a residence and forage allowances, to the Imperial officer to be selected as commandant of the colonial forces there is some prospect of an appointment being shortly made It is reported in military circles that the choice of the department is not unlikely to fall upon Colonel lyons of the Royal' Artillery, a distinguished officer who was selected to represent Great Britain at the French camp on the occasion of the army rant reverse of last year There are, however several applicants (or the post The construction of the torpedo boats is proceeding somewhat slowly, owing to the delay caused by the necessity of having the work the roughly inspected by the Admiralty off says Mr William Robertson, M L A has under gone a serious operation, which, it is be hoped, will lead to his complete restoration to health It will, however be some time before he will be convalescent The buildings for the International Fisheries Exhibition, which is to be opened by the Queen on May 12 are now completed They almost cover the southern half of the Horticultural Society's Gardens at South Kensington Such of the colonies as exhibit or grouped in the east and west annexes Every effort is being made to tender the Exhibition a success A model bah market covering about half an acre will be held in connexion with it Although it has been officially announced that the Amsterdam Exhibition will be opened by the King and Queen of the Netherlands on May 4 Some fears are entertained that a postponement may be necessary Mr Levey has not yet obtained possession of the Victorian court, but hopes to done by the end of this week Fxbibitore experience considerable difficulty in cows queues of the promoters of the Txbib tion nellie inclined to regard the undertaking too tulle as a money in skins concern For in stance one firm monopolised the right to a part all the goods inside the building, and of course charge pretty) well as they like Mr L?, A Proctor is now re delivering, at St J In case Hall, London the course of let tures on astronomy which he gave with so much success in the United States and Australia recently Mr Warrington Wood had just executed the portrait bust of the Right Hon H C E Childers for the University of Melbourne. He is now at work in his studio in Rome on a replica of this bust for Mrs Cmluers LONDON COLONY! AT WOOL SALES The first Bones of colonial wool sales terminated on March 21st, there having been 26 sittings and the daily average of' wools offered was no less than 11 2.00 bales The quantity catalogued amounted to 292 000 bales, about 105 000 bales were taken for export of which b 500 were on American account, and some 23,000 bales are held over for future realisation The chief characteristics of the sales were the comparative steadiness of the market and the great re seniority in values The demand from all quarters was fairly good, and indicated that the past half year's supply, whilst sufficient for the requirements of the trade, had passed into consumption without difficulty Foreign buyers were well represented amongst them for the first time for several years being come from the limited States and Canada the slackening tendency observable towards the close of the auctions is attributed by Messrs Balme and Co to an indisposition on he part of consumers (who at the opening of the Hales were ill provided) to stock much in excess of actual requirements Messrs Jacomb, Son, and Co state that the market has maintained a firm tone throughout, fluctuations in value having been within a narrow compass, but for most da scriptions, and especially for short, poor wasty, and faulty wools, the rates secured during the first half of the sites were not fully maintained during the latter half In comparing prices of individual clips with those of last year, allowance must he made for the far inferior growth and condition of very many Anatrnlanim brands this year The general result of this series has been a fair tnititit»iianifl of the average currency of the end of 1882 with here and there in poor stapled and inferior produce chiefly, a turn in buyers' favour The heat scoured merino parcels, and good Lambe', as also the finer class of crossbreds, have sold rather better than in November last Messrs Charles Balme and Co report that the November scale of value has been exceeded only in the case of scoured wools, which have proved in unusually scarce supply, and good lambs' wool, free from fault, the demand for which has appreciably expanded , otherwise good, sound, well conditioned merino staple has maintained its value, while poor, open, tender, or faults produce (the proportion of which became increasingly con Epictetus with the progress of the auctions) has gradually lost ground, and at the close stands a full id and in not a few instances as much as 4d per lb , under opening rates The finer grades of crossbred staple have commanded throughout full prices, while the coarse classes, after opening at a decline, have since recovered the quotations of the preceding peace Messrs. Williams, Overbury, and Co. state that an improvement of J i and in some cases of 4d per lb in scoured Australian and New Zealand merino qualities, a decline of like extent in AuUnilian medium greasy merinoes, and a fall of about 15 per lb on greasy Cape and Natal wool, comes into the chief deviations from the closing rates of the previous sales. Other fluctuations of a temporary character occurred no doubt particularly in crossbreds, for which the competition from time to time sued weaker or stronger, in sympathy with the tone of (the Bradford market ; but the final result leaves prices practically unchanged. Extra superior flocks have been comparatively neglected. Mews of those in the grease were very heavy, and below the average of former years ; only for a few brands of especially fine quality, and in superior condition, were full rates realised The demand for lambs' wool of good quality, and fairly free from fault, has been active throughout, and values of these grades have advanced 1d per lb. Faulty parcels have been less wanted, and towards the end sold with considerable irregularity. Messrs. John Hoare and Co. report that sound Australian descriptions, whether washed, scoured, or grease, have met with a quick sale; but as regards faulty and ordinary sorts, the market has somewhat flagged. Port Phillip and Sidney produce of the heavier and inferior growths has ruled slightly Mow the rules of the November series. Limb wools have sold very readily, and prices show a slight advance on last series. Messrs. Helmuth Schwartze and Co. state that prices ruled on a par with the closing rates of last series. For some ports, such us good scoured and washed and scoured crossbreds, which rely chiefly on the home demand, this level has been maintained, and partly even improved nunn. But greasy wools, which formed the bulk of the supplies, suffered from the reserve which the French trade again showed on this occasion, and prices in their case receded gradually until at the close they must be quoted as. to Id. below opening rates, Messrs. Dunn Brothers report that the losses which commanded thshestcompetition were greasy combing, PortPhillipond Sydney, from 13d. to 153. and good shaft? scoured, prices for which were fully up to and not un- frequently in excess of former quotations. Superfine wools of the best brands sold hardly as well as usual, partly owing to the fact that there is less demand for this class just at present, and partly to an inferiority of growth, many of the best known marks coming forward either tender or wanting in that high finish for which they are so favourably known. In medium and inferior gressr there has been little change, the heavier Adelaides being sometimes rather in favour of borers. Speaking generally of Australian merinoes. it will be seen that, although rolling on the whole with great regularity., the on the whole with great regularity., the finest as well as the lower sorts barely reached their former level, whilst in' good sound medium wools were rather higher. Crossbreds opened rather flat, but the finer grades shortly improved their prime. tion ; this was in great measure attributable to the American competition, many of the best lots selling at 114. and 15d. per lb. The coarser descriptions also fetched more money after the first week. Lambs'' wool was good request, and may be quoted B to 10 per cent, dearer. THE NEW CLIP. Speaking generally, remark Messrs Willans and Overbury, the new Australian clip, though suffering in many instances from the effects of drought, is sounder and of better character than the first arrivals had led the trade to expect. The shipments of new wool from New Zealand appear to be about an average both in quality and condition Messrs. Balme and Co. state that the first representations of the superfine Australian flocks of the new season have been offered during these sales. In point of soundness they are not in oversea up to the standard of the clip of 1851 1852; and the unwashed wools are certainly-, in general, heavier in yolk The New Zealand wools appear sound, but vary a good deal as regards condition, though they are, for the most part, somewhat heavy. Messrs Dunn Brothers remark that with regard to the present season's production from Australia, although estimates differ considerably as to the extent of the diminution, there seems to be little doubt that there will boBomo falling-off from last year's quantity say from 2 to 5 per cent. The second series is fixed to commence on the 16th of May, the new arrivals admissible being limited to 350,000 bales limitation which will probably result in the quantities for the two last series being about equal to those offered at the corresponding auctions of 1882. As regards the future course of prices, there seems reason to expect a maintenance of the moderate range of values now current THE, WH THAT MARK KV Though very variable, the weather on the whole continues favourable for farming operations A spell of Eovsro trott served to retard vegetation, sable It facilitates the working of the carnival End, so that more what has been put in than a few weeks ago was considered possible Under the influence of more or courting reports from the country, the corn trade has become very Inactive ; speculators have entered to operate, and mark a new rule in favour of having Millers, Mr rule, do not hnM large fiwitttahle feat ks but as there is plenty of wheat coming: first and from America.
