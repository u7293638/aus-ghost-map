When they came to the pond they saw the crea ture, and Pfister fired at it. It turned out to be only a stag which had gone into the pond for coolness. As the harm was done, the body was cut up and di- i videcj, and the village feasted. However j tta authorities heard of the story and | Pfigter was prosecuted for a breach of the game la the shooting season haviDg closed. An advocate who defended bim called attention to ? the fact hat on the same .day . as that on which the offence had been committed, the Prince Imperial had shot a stag in the forest of Fontaine bleau, that all the journals had recounted the exploit, and that no judicial proceed ings had been instituted against his Im perial Highness. The advocate did not desire the application of the law against the Prince, but only asked for indulgence in conseauence of the coincidence. However, the tribunal was properly im pressed with the difference between a Prince and a farmer, and condemned | Pfister to 50fr. fine, and the payment of costs, ordering also the gun to be confis cated. Under the circumstances a ghost wonld have been the more satisfactory antagonist. ? .
