THE TOWN OF BABYVILLE. It's the dearest town, the fairest town, the pret tiest town to ine, Of all the towns in all the landE, this side or 'cross the sea; It's sunshine there,"and moonshine there, and starshine all the time, And it's never cold, and none get old, in its lovely summer clime; There's never a ghost or a goblin there, and sin was never known, And no one ever felt a pang, or heard a neigh hour groan, And the birds sing aiway, night and dayâ€”in fact, they're never si ill," in this airy, fairy, darling place, the Town of Habyvilie. The shops arc full of sweetmeats, and they're sold foi just a song, The hobby-horses in (he streets are free the whole day long; The hand plays every afternoon, there's fireworks every night. And all the babies toddle out to sec the glorious sight. Yon kiss them as you meet ibem, and I hey kiss you when you go, And clap their hands, and laugh with glee, to see you at their show; The doctor died last summer, and is resting o'er the hill, For none get sick, they haven't time, in the Town of Bahyville.
