A REAL LIVE GHOST. Yes, I have seen a ghost, a real live one. I was a soldier, and on guard duty at Windsor Castle. Several young soldiers had been scared when on sentry at the midnight vigil inside the cloisters of St. George's Chapel, and had quitted their posts; a most serious military crime, entailing exemplary punish ment. . Determined to elucidate the mystery, I secured the confidence of the sergeant, and was detailed to take over this parti cular post at the witching hour. In a secluded part of the cloisters (a most gloomy place, een in the daylight) was a door leading to the private apartments of one of the resident clerical officials. Taking up my station on the shady side of this door, I waited with bated breath, for the ghost to appear. Presently the door was stealthily opened, and a figure emerged entirely draped in white, and 'walked with ghostly strides towards the place where the sentry is usually posted. Quick as lightning I s!lut the door with a loud, slam, and the ghost, giving a frantic scream, flew towards it, .and throwing off the white tablecloth, dis closed the bewitching form and. pretty features of Mary Ann,.the housemaid of the said clerical official.. It is needless .to add that "tum" was the word,, and since some years h have elapsed-no harm can be done by .the re cital of how I laid, the ."Ghost of the Cloisters."
