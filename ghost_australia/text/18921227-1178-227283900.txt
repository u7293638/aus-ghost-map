The Union Co.— Expenditure op £S20,000. — At the annual mooting of the Union Steam ship Co. of 'New Zealand, at Duncdin, tho other day, tho chairman, tho Hon. Geo. M'Lenn, in referring to 'the balance-sheet, mado a most interesting statement regarding tho cost of conducting the company, and tho amount expended in wages, &e.; Tho balance- sheet showed a profit on the working account for tho year, after making provision for depreciation, of £53,606 13s. 5d. Tho clmrgo for interest on debentures and other liabilities, and exchange on remittances, amounted to £17,453 Us. lid., so that the available profit only enabled a 6 per cent, dividend to ho declared on tho capital. Mr. M'Lean regretted that liis expectations of improved trado during tlio year had not been realised. Tho volurno of trado had not only not boon maintained, but there had beon a tendency to reduction of botli passenger and goods rates. Twice during tho last four years fares had boon reduced in the liopo of inducing moro people to travel, but tho sacrifico on tho company's part had not been met by a correspond ing increase of traffic, . Continuing his remarks tho chairman said: — "In order to give you Bonio idea of tlio extent of our operations, I may tell you that our expendi ture for the yenr" for the working expenses of tlio steamers and their repairs has been some thing liko £820,000. Out of this amount over £320,000 goes in salaries nnd wages paid directly by the company, that is, without counting tho wages which are practically paid by tho company through tho medium of tho tradesmen who supply tlio various commodities required in connection witli the fleet. There are no fower thnn 1500 men omployed afloat, whose wages in tlio year nomo to £180,000, while no less than £100,000 has been paid during the year in day wages to laborers and meohanics. This is ail average of fully £1900 per week, and taking tho avorngo wages of each man at 42s. per woek, it means that steady employment has heen provided for 900 men. When, therefore, wo include office staff, and permanent outdoor iinilds at tho various branches, I may say wo liavo directly dependent upon us no fowor than 2600 men ; and when you come to take into account their families, tho nurnbor sup ported by tho company must bo at least 8000\. I have only quoted the wages paid direct by the company, but in addition to these, through tho medium of our tradesmen, who do most of our repairs and supply us with stores, &c.;, we indirectly support a good many more. Tho total sum oxponded during tho year in provision supplies for our crows and passengers amounts to £89,000, the principal item being meat, of which I find wo have consumed no less a quantity than 2,486,2551b,, at a cost of £25,646. This is equal to 1110 tons weight of meat, or 41,400 sheep of 601b. each. Tho average consumption of meat per man per day Kir passengers, officers and crow ox- ceeds 2Mb., so my English friends who will road the remarks I am now making will seo that tho reputation colonial peoplo get of boing largo meat-eaters is not ill-founded. Tho year's expenditure for vegetables alone amounted to £5500. On fruit there was a similar expenditure. For fish tlio expendi ture was £3000. Of bread no fewer than 181,160 loaves were consumed at a oost of £3700) in addition to the bread baked on beard tho steamers. TJio consumption of eggs was 33,000 dozen, costing cluso upon £2000. Poultry and gnine wore used to tho value of between £1000 and £5000. In addition to those itoms thoro wns also a largo expenditure for butter, milk, ice, potatoes and general groceries, bringing up tlio total cost of provisions to the amount I have already named. Our coal consumption in tlio Htunmera for tho yenr reached 179,800 tons, of which about half was New Zealand coal. Then wo hnvo expended no less than £32,000 in harbor and light dues in the various colonies, while, of course, repairs ancl renewals como to a very largo sum, ns also do marino stores, lighturngo of cargo, advertising, tele grams, and many other charges which go to make up tlio sum total of the disbursements in connection with tho running of steamers." In view of theso figures Mr. M'Lenn naturally made a strong appenl for local support for tho Union Co. The Konoowabha.— Tlio Howard Smith steamship Konoowat-rn, whoso arrival was re ported in yesterday's Star, brought tlio follow ing passengers f rom Adelaide and Melbourno i — Mesdames Thornton, Patterson, Holmes and 2 children.

New Coastal Steamer. — The steamer Banks Peninsula, which lias been added to tlin New South Wales coastal fleet under tho flag of Messrs. Ghest anil Jewett, arrived in harbor yesterday from Hobart, under tho command of Captain R. C. Ghost, formerly of tlio R.M.S. Zealand ia.

Tlio vessel, which is to be commanded by Captain 0. M'Cooe, is to leave to-day on an excursion trip, and to-morrow will enter on the trade for which she is intended, to Capo Hawko and the Manning. Homeward Bound. — By the departure of the steamship Ardle on Saturday for Dunkirk a very popular shipmaster bade farewell to his brother eoumiandors for a lengthy period. Captain Tnggart arrived in Sydney 18 months ago to fulfil an engagement with the Ardle in tlio intercolonial trade, and for which tho vessel proved herself eminently adapted. During the performance of this service in tlio Sydney, Newcastlo and Now Zealand trado Captain Taggart made hosts of friends both afloat nnd ashore, and it was with cxtroino regret that farewell had to bo said to him. The vessel, it will bo recollected, was chartered by Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Co., and loaded with wool for Dunkirk, whence she will proceed to her port of registry, Dundee, so that Captain Tnggart will meot his old Soot friends and have tho pleasure of inform ing them that lie was delighted with his treat ment by tho Australians, nnd that his vessel had the honor of being one of the New South Wales wool fleet. Don't do it Again. — The Melbourne Court of Marine Inquiry in giving its decision in tho ohnrgo of misconduct brought against Captain Patrick for his navigation of tho steamer Hygeia on December 7, when a collision was narrowly averted between her nnd the Flinders off Queonscliff, found that tho charge had been sustained, but that as it did not amount to gross misconduct his certificate would not be dealt with. Tho court, however, severely censured him, cautioned him to bo more careful in future, and ordered him to pay costs amounting to £9 9s. The Waiirimoo.— The New Zealand and Australasian Co.'s steamship Warrimoo sailed from Auckland for Sydney on Sundny, and is due hero somo time to-morrow or early on Thursday.
