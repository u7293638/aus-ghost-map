The Congregational Union. The first of tie New South Wales Congrega tional Union meefciu/e took place last evenirg in the Pitt-street Church, Sydney, when Divine service was heW, followed by a united com munion. ' The Eev. Wariow Bavies, M.A., con ducted the former part of the service, and preached from Acts iv. 31, ' And when they had prayed the place was fibaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they epafce the word of God with boldness.' After some introductory remarks the preacher asked, 'What then was the import of this phenomenon to those who witnessed it, a_d what message does it bear to us to- night ?' Jn answer to the latter part, he enlarged upon three leading thoughts — 1. It teaches the sacredness of the Ctirisfeian Assembly; 2. the possibilities of prayer; and 3. the nearness and sufficiency of God— they were filled with the Holy Ghost. There was not a large congregation, but it represented largely the ministry and deaconate of the churches. The service of praise was led by the Point Piper road choir. After the administration of the Communion the benediction was pro nounced. The first business session will be held this morning, when the new chairman (the Bev. Geo. Rayner) is to, be introduced. The official address will be delivered this (Tuesday) evening at 7.30, in the Pitt-street church, by the chair man. ? -
