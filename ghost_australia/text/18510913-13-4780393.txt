south bourke. We have not the honour of the acquaintance of Mr Patrick Turnbull ; but if he were the nearest and dearest friend we had, we should give him one piece of very candid advice. We should recommend him to retire from a contest, where he has everything to lose, and nothing to gain. When a gentleman is satisfied that he can do no good, the next thing at which he ought to him is, that he do no harm. Now, after the display at the nomination for South Bourke, we enter tain a conviction that Mr Turnbull has just as much chance of entering the Legislative Council during the present election, as he has of bi cakfasting this morning in the Crystal Palais c. It would be a far more dignified course, then, and one which will much better bear reflection hereafter, that he should quietly make the best of a bad job, than that, by persevering in a hopeless pursuit, he should not only add ridicule to his position, but very seriously injure the cause with which he professes to be identified. If we believed that Mr Turnbull had a ghost of a chance, we should not speak like this, but as certainly as the does not chip his morning egg under twenty acres of glass, so certainly; if he reject this piece of homely, but friendly advice, will he go home on Monday evening, Living his nails, under all the vexation of a humilia- ting defeat.
