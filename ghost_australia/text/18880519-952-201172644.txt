I a oiraiotis ^ DETECTIVE CASE. (New York Sun.) ',:; ...?.-. -! j During the first three years- of mj' career1 as a detective I had some singular J jobs given to me to work on, and the nianher in' which one . of them was worked, and1 the' developments of the case may interest the ? reader. : ? .,,.,- .i\C:'( ! About three miles outside the limits' pfja large city in Pennsylvania stood -.a: large, farm, house. . There had been a : murder committed there, and whisky had played; navoe witn an, heir, and the house:'had: stood vacant for three years before I saw ? it. The farm had passed into the hands of a ;New Yorker on a mortgage, and he seemed to have forgotten all about it. Natiirally' enough the. cry of 'haunted house', iiwos. raised, and presently you. could not have ' hired a neighbor to enter the house in i the daytime. There were people. living Jwithin. a quarter of a mile of the place, and by arid; by they began to tell some queer stories. Oil two occasions parties of three or four went;out from the. city to stop in the house' all night.but. in, each instance they, were: driven away by strange noises before mid night. ,1 lived in-a town forty miles from, the haunted house; and consequently heard nothingof it. : ; . k-.\\., ??- il had a case against an absconding trea-. .surer. He had the funds of a- large and prosperous'lodge in' his hands, and got away with 3000dol belonging to it. : He furtlier mpre borrowed about SOOOdol of hi? friends',' arid got DOOdol more on a forced '.,draft,' This occurred in a town about thirty -miles' from the haunted house. The defaulter had bought a railroad ticket for Chicago,' arid had left behind him, as if by accident, a parcel addressed to a party in Garden City. It ought: to have been reasoned that .this, party was he under another name, and that; he: had gone to Chicago as fast as steam' could carry him, but I reasoned just the opposite. - He 'had gone without his trunk or clothing; but ,when I came to overhaul ;his ithings, his landlady figured out that; two clean, shirts, several collars,' a stout pair of boots, and an old suit of clothes; ?were missing from the house. ^The. boots and old suit had belonged to a boarderrwho died months before. . . Is :i i'i ?-'? ..:'. There! wore three highways: leading out; of .the town. I worked two of' them without (Success. ...On the third I. soon found-a farmer , wlio had seen a' foot traveller resembling; ? my man puss on: the evening 'he1 .'had' ? abTc6nd^ed'-Five'miies further .on I became positive of; - his ; identity.' ;l ': He l walked' all that-riight with only 'two;brief halts' before midnight/ to' inquire 'about roads, but once on his trail 'I soon 'picked 'up 'plenty of pointers.

He had a light felt hat, a black felt 'hat and. cap,' and about once in ten miles 'he exchanged, his head-gear.' He -was a- smooth-faced irian, but he had provided ihims'elf with a' goatee arid side- whiskers. ' I thusheiird of him; oncers a smoothfaced man Svearing a cap, and'having one nrrii in 'a 'sling; next' as a: youngish' man with' a goatee and a' black hat;;; again as a full-whiskered man with a ?light ? hat.

' He was', then smooth faced, and ? wore : a- cap,1 and claimed, to be an' agent for- a windmill 'company whose: rights had been infringed ori,1 and who were takirig stops to collect royalty,'- ' ''' \ ??? ? When; Kelly entered -the 'kitchen, for dinner,- a hired boy of : color, who was 'not perniitted to eat with :the family,' wris left in the sitting-room; His curiosity regard^ ing the contents of the :valisewas aroused, and' he 'picked: the lock .arid overhauled them.- 'He was 'careful/riot to' say anything of''thisÂ«tb :the: family,; but.wheri I came along1 on1 my errand -T 's'oon.'discoyered 'that he had'a!secret: ' The siglit'of a silyerpiece loosened his1 tongue, arid he, told me' of ' the hats and false whiskers.

That, night, 10 , o'clock, accom panied by a local, detective,' I visited the place.- It was 'a'ramblingbig' farm house, situated twenty rods' from' the highway,' and the ? ground around was ! grown' up W; weeds and bushes.1 ' All' the windows' were broken,' and- some of the- doors' 's'to'pd1 open,' and 'a more gloomy place1 1 never'saw. ; Wej entered by a rear'door^and'found'the'dbors' rotting away1 and 'the plastering : cruinbling; ;off.
