BRASS BANDS AT SPORTS 1 MEETINGS. To the Editor. Sir—Brass baads at sports' gather-, ings are in dee i a very expensive " tuxury, for seven or eight tunes they demand a sum equal to £5, or, for anything Wesleyan, iree. I can truly say—^- " Oh keep away from the band, I say, And give them lots cf kid, &c.;, &c.; If they were professionals, or could even play a decent tune ^ would not say anything about them, out as they are only " amateurs" and very poor at that. ( why they would not be toler ateu in the gutto elsewhere) it is ti^if to give up the ghost. 1 am, &c.; A SPORTING MAN. Edithburgh, March 22.
