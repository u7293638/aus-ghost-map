AMONG THE MEMBERS. By ITHURIEL. "Ithuriel with his spear touched lightly." Once more does federation overshadow all local and party issues, and the prospects are that the session will be tranquil and brief. "Officially" members are glad of this, but actually they are growing very tired of living at such great altitudes, and they long to return to those levels in which they draw their political breath more easily and natu- rally. Under ordinary circumstances ther would have been a great deal of criticism before the Address in Reply was passed, but "What's the good" is the prevailing at- titude of mind. "Let us get it out of the way, and have the federal issue disposed of, and then something may turn up." The young ardent spirits and the old and wily stagers are equally weary of political peace. ihey a» mt then share in the good tilinga that are going ' When um I to ha» e a smoke '" asked the 'lttli boy of the big bo) who I ept pulling away at the cigar which, the» had contributed to punhase ' ' Oh, you shut up I ni the chun man of tins com pan», and you re onlv a shuiholdei You can spit ' Hitit is the piinfnl position Hu cigar of the Victomu Legislature, as we know it, is ucarl» all pnlfed aw a), and so man» ha» e not h id ti single driw Ha\e the» not good cause to be tiled of merely c\pcct oiating' No doubt the Government lins blundered s nil» in connection »vith the Mtddciibyme affair, but, then, it his blundirtd over neurl) evei y personal milter it ha-t touelii.il, yet it survives 'Hie election of c»|.cii a, the giant to fair Giuliani Berr), the diction of Lhtiirmuii of Committees, were ill examples of tactless flouiidenng Hie Midden prosecution xvül rim un us nnothei shocking example of ' How not to do it " and that xvill be all The felling iguinst the Government is ver) strong, iv en on the Ministerial side, and the rcve lations as to ho v the commissioner was np pointed hay o sticngthened it A careful whip will be made, and if the Government finds it is strong enough to win on a party issue it xv ill fight it out on that line I£ not, it will announce that in deciding on its own pi iv lieges the House should have .i fice hand I he rock will not upset the Ministeiuil coich, but ivhat wretciied dnv mg it shows on a load so smoothed by the federation roller that lhere should not ha» e 1 con oven ii íolt In the first instance it avis recognised tint though the voice wus St hilda's »mee, Ait the hand »vas the hand of 1 ssendon W. hen, in the presence of tito most hostile House he has e»ct faced, the l.emiei announced that he intended to tal e the Madden Symo matter up the »oleo of Lbsendon »»us the only one to iheei in aii-wci to the angry shouts Min) a tuno since then has the Piemier »v ishcd that he bid left it alone Hut, hav int, gone so fal to rctreit »»is »\orse than to nd» ailie Hie ghosts of nil those dead and goui Ministers and officers carne to lum fiom-Collins street, and «aid in scpul ein il tone», "I ook hore, if » ou don t go on now it will be said that jon dare not, bo eitise the einiges »\eic true" Theie »vero some members of the Cabinet who were not so sensitive about aillent rcpulutions, and do not believe in ghosts But m v un they in gi d Wl at if it tempt vou toward the tlooel ni) lord, Or to tit- dreaelllll summit ol the elilT Sn Gcoige w is superstitious, and he- foJ lovvid the siipernntunl dircition If liidcly piessed b» curious and sccptml niimbeis is le. lus dcihngs with the fcliost, wi nny i «.pelt to hear linn sa» ioucling 1! is vaalon li rt It is an honest 11 ost ti tit let me» toll jou I eir lour el -sere to I nove xx li it is botivttn u O erin liter t ¡as vc ma) Hie chronic diKonlcnt m the labour pint) li is once mole leached an acute st ige \ meiting is lo lie held and there mc gieat muttanit-s and iambling« wlueli ne understood to foietell the explosion that is tu t il t pine Signs of tin mutiny have not been suppressed in the House.
