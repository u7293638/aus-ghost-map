COMMERCIAL NEWS. THE TRADE CIRCULARS. We" have received numerous Trade Circulars by the last mail, and give the following : MESSRS. STABLES & CO. Our report of shipments during the month of August again shows a decrease on the aggregate value to all ports of £52,178-the values for past month being £791,21 fi, against £816,394 in July (inclusive of late entries). We exhibited last month a statement of exports for corresponding periods of 1858, showing at that date a decrease on the business of seven months amounting to £19,015 ; we have, therefore; the satisfactory assurance that we have this month increased the" deficiency rather than the redundancy of shipments ; still the difference in question is so small that it may be made up at any time by the clearance of one or two large ships, and we suspect, from the considerable number of vessels now almost ready for clearance, that we shall hardly have so favorable a view to present next month. We beg to call attention to a Blue Book published as a report of the Commissioner of Customs, where, among other plans for the attainment of more correct statistical information as to our exports, they recommend that a fine of £20 be levied on all parties who do not within three days after the clearance of any i vessel, so amend their entries by withdrawing all shipping bulk of goods which have been shut out, and correcting all weights and quantities shipped, that the entries remaining shall then correspond with the cargo book. If these regulations be insisted on, a great benefit will arise to all those concerned in shipping, and it will be an advantage also to ourselves, as thereby saving us a vast amount of trouble in tracing out duplicate entries and goods which have been shut out. To Melbourne and Geelong we have, for August, shipments amounting to £489,973, against £552,223 in July showing a decrease of £62,250. There is no marked variation in the quantities of piece goods exported, or of millinery or hosiery. In haberdashery we have a considerable decline ; apparel is nearly the same as last month ; but in wrought leather, notwithstanding the large amount in the Champion of the Seas, we have much less to report than in July. In general hardware we have a falling off. Bar iron remains within a few tons of our last amounts. Galvanized iron and nails are somewhat below last month's statement. Sheet lead has gone freely. Slates are still moving in considerable quantities, as also sawn wood. Linseed oils and paints are beginning to slacken. Woolpacks and bushel-bags are also more moderate. Of brandy and geneva we have very moderate shipments, but of rum a quantity which we think considerably in excess of the requirements of Victoria. Shipments of beer, in bulk and glass, are about as heavy as they usually are at this time of the year. In provisions we have a large quantity of cheese, and an enormous array of butter. Oats are about as in July ; while of malt, and bacon and hams, our report is very much curtailed. In our last report we gave a heavy amount to the column of salt fish, in pursuance of an entry in the manifest of the Rhea Sylvia to that effect, which ought to have been butter. We had great doubts at the time about the correct copying of our manifest at the Liverpool Custom- House, but, as it only came in the evening before publication leaving no possible time for en- quiry we did not venture upon the responsibility of altering the official document. The amounts are now altered in their respective columns in the account of previous exports, making the amount of butter shipped in July 10,186 firkins. Shipments of salt are decreasing ; but soda and soda ash are going as freely as ever. Oatmeal and peas are also in great abundance. In candles we have to note a very brisk movement, both in British and foreign-the quantities of the former during the past month amounting to nearly one-half of the whole shipments of previous seven months. Some large shipments have been made of soap, an article which has been much neglected for some time. Currants are going again very heavily. The Royal Bride, screw-steamer, went round from Bristol to Cork, where she took in 1,635 firkins of butter, and 472 sacks of oats. She took in addition, 134 cases of bacon, 3 ditto hams, 42 barrels pork, 5 boxes preserved provisions, 40 sacks and 67 half barrels oatmeal, 15 hhds. and 50 qr.-casks vinegar, 60 small casks whisky, 74 bales cordage, 1 case books, 1 ditto cigars, 27 casks machinery, which we cannot place in our tables, not having been furnished with the respective details of any of these articles. There particulars, when we obtain them, will be carried to account of previous shipments in the next month s Circular. The Black Eagle, which sailed from the Clyde, 14th May, has put into Rio, leaky. SrnxEY.-The value of British Goods exported in August amounts to £221,661, against £200,485 in July, showing an increase of £21,176. We have an increase in many of our columns of piece goods, especially cottons, woollens, worsted, hosiery, and haberdashery. Of apparel we have no Very large amounts, but in wrought leather a heavy Increase. In j bar iron we have a diminution of the heavy shipments of JuU also in sheet lead, but in galvanized iron, sheet iron, and nails, we have a considerable increase. Of linseed oil we have less, but a fair amount of rape and olive oils. Brandy and rum continue upon a very moderate scale the same of Geneva and British spirits, both case and bulk, wines and beer in bulk and glass. Cheese, butter, bacon and hams, oatmeal, and chicory, continue to be shipped very moderately. Of candles rather more than usual have gone-of dried fruits less than the quotations of last month, MORETON BAY. But little has gone direct to this port during the year-the Shackamaxon being only the second ship we have had. Some variation from our last may be found in the delivery of spirits from this vessel, as some of the entries describe only " foreign spirits," leaving us to conjecture what sort they are. ADEL SIR-We have only one ship from London, one from Liverpool, and one from Leith. Their cargoes amount to £36,855, against £64,267 in July showing a decrease of £27,412, HOBART Tows AND LAUNCESTON We have two ships to report for each of these ports, whose cargoes are valued at £39,548, against £29,419 in July showing an increase of £10,129. Our passenger-list from Liverpool gives as 1,642 as the number of steerage emigrants to all ports. The Herald of the Morning took 415 ; Champion of the Seas, 268: Matilda, 20; Norwood, 11; Greyhound, 213 total, 927 for Melbourne and Geelong. The Shackamaxon took 330 for Moreton Bay, and the David McIvor 385 for Adelaide. MR F. W. OQSENS'S CIRCULAR. Since the issue of my last Monthly Report nothing calling for particular comment has arisen in our wine and spirit market, brandy excepted, which maintains its upward tendency. Rums firm. Clean common sherries have realised improved values. Good sound medium ports have improved in value since the last advices from Oporto. Galls, Craik, Wineimportedinto the United Kingdom for seven months, ending 31st July. 4,306,315 Wine taken for home consumption . 4,208,574 Wine taken for exportation . 1,240,411 5,448,985 Excess of consumption over import... 1,142,670 Throughout the wine- producing districts of Europe the present vintage is not likely to prove at all a favorable one this is much to be regretted, as it will completely check that tendency towards moderate prices which would have probably resulted if the yield of 1859 had been equal to that of 1858. Taking this into consideration, in connection with the reduced supplies of the last seven months, the probable movement in the wine market will be towards enhanced prices. In the event, of higher prices, there will be one redeeming feature, which did not exist in 1857, viz., the improved quality of the wine to come forward from Spain and France and probably from Portugal, should the 1858's prove as good as some report them to be. WINES. Sherry There is now no reasonable doubt as to the result of the vintage throughout the Sherry district ; the yield will fall far short of that of 1858, but the probable quality is highly spoken of ; of course no positive result can be reported until the fruit has passed through the wine press. Prices of medium and fine qualities are on the rise at Xerez ; shippers, however, purchase cautiously, feeling that any serious advance would tend to check the present steady demand for actual consumption which has existed for some months past j besides, the result has I proved that when prices are forced beyond a certain limit a reduced demand is the immediate consequence. Since the departure of the Yenikale in January last, no direct shipments of sherry are reported from Cadiz to any Australian port. Port Sample casks of the vintage 1858 have appeared in our market, and the quality is reported fair-the wine thin, dry, and of little body. Several of those shippers who have far years secured a reputation far vintage wines decline to ship 1858's; it will probably result in our receiving a few thousand pipes of fair medium wine. The present crop is not very favorably spoken of the disease having appeared with great virulence in many parts of the Alto Douro. Since the Kite, no direct cargo has been advised from Oporto to Australia, In other wines nothing worthy of particular report . SriBITB. Brandy. The upward movement, in the brandy market continues, and Martell's 1858 is reported to have reached 9s. free on board export ship. Should any considerable orders come to hand by the mail to be delivered to-day, prices will probably rule much higher. Many of the cognac shippers decline, to' name a price. It is estimated the produce of the forthcoming vintage will scarcely reach one-third of an average, aida tecks in! France are very low, the present upward tendency of prices may thus be satisfactorily accounted for. Rumney very steady demand has for some time existed, and fine Demerara's remain firm at quotations. Geneva, lessee quotations, Wines are quoted as follows: Sherry, per butt of 108 gallons, £40, £45, £50, £55 ; choice and old, £60, £80, and £100. Amontillado £60 to £100. Port, per pipe of 115 gallons, first brands, is tG, £52, £60, and £65. Champagne, quarts, per dozen, 25s, 36s, 40s, and 40s. Claret, 15s, 20s, 25s and 30s, to 50s.

Australian hides have been in good demand the last few days, and prices may be quoted 3d per lb. higher, with an upward tendency. The sales since 6th ult. comprise 26,804 salted hides 1st heavy, in to 593 lb., 5d to 5d 1st lighf¿32j to 4d lb., 4d to Sid ; 2nd class, 4d to 4d ; 3rd class, 2d to 3d per lb. Import since 6th ult., 15,142 hides. Present stock, 23,536 hides. TALLOW The market is now in a very peculiar position, for whilst the price is nearly 7s per cwt. higher than at this time last year, our stock consists of 10,000 casks more. Upwards of 70,000 casks of tallow have also reached St. Petersburg from the interior, but they are being sent forward very slowly at present, which will be the case until after the 12th inst., when the time expires for the delivery of the 60,000 casks said to be bought there by the speculators. Afterwards, it is anticipated, supplies will come forward more freely, and future prices will, no doubt, be regulated by the total quantity that will be shipped to this country. The deliveries during the past month have been again small as compared with the same month last year, viz. 7,418 casks against 9,655 casks, and the stock of all descriptions consists of 19,979 casks, against 10,287 casks at the corresponding time last year. The home supply is good, and the present market value is 55s. 6d. per cwt. nett cash. AUSTRALIAN TALLOW -"We continue without any stock of this description, and the present nominal value of good mutton is 55s 6d to 57s, and good beef tallow 24s 6d to 55s per cwt. DYSTER, CALDER, & CO. HORNS, CC, have sold freely at about late prices ; 75,194 have been cleared, average 15 to 16 oz., at 47s to 50s per 123; average 116 to 14 oz., at 29s to 6s per 123. 155 tons bones and hoofs realised £10 2s 6d to £18 per ton for shank bones ; £8 53 to £9 7s 6d per ton for boots £4 10s to £4 12s 6d for common bones. SHEEPSKINS continue to meet a ready sale at full prices. STREATFIELD, LAWRENCE, v MORTIMORE. The leather trade has become much more animated within the last month, a large clearance having been effected of all descriptions. Prime goods may be quoted fully 2d per lb. dearer within the past week, and in several instances supplies have proved inadequate. It is anticipated that the market will be very short of stock in a few weeks, as tanners generally have curtailed their operations throughout the year on account of the high prices ruling for the raw material, and buyers until recently have confined their purchases to immediate requirements, consequently no accumulation exists either with farmers or dealers, and prices may therefore be regarded as tending towards increased firmness. WOOL CIRCULARS. We have to acknowledge receipt of various wool circulars. H. P. Hughes's, which gave a good resume of the market, we published at length on Saturday. Messrs. Hazard, Sons, and Caldecott say that many of the Sydney and Port Philip flocks were much troubled with burrs and grass seeds, which considerably damaged their sale. The same firm supply the following comparative statement of the imports of wool into England The quantity of wool imported from Europe in 1844 was3S,079,624lb3., and in 1858, 20,632,555; from British Colonies, including India, in 1841, 22,565,243, and in 1858, 85,035,571 ; from South America and other parts, in 1844, 5,068.894, and in 1858, 13,070,597 lbs. Total, in 1814, 65,713,761 lbs., and in 1858,126,738,723 lbs. Thus, in 14 years, the supply from Europe has declined by 9,447,069 lbs. ; the supply from the colonies has increased by (¡2,170,328 lbs. and from other countries by 8,001,703 lbs. ; showing, that for the chief increase of our supply, we are indebted to our possessions abroad, which are generally becoming larger every year. Two thirds of last, year's importation alone came from British possessions. Messrs. J. T. Simes and Co, publish the following table of quantities of wool imported into and exported from England during the first seven months of 1857, 1858, and 1859, respectively : 1857\. 1858. 1859. lbs. lbs. lbs. 34 19.25) 31,621,043 39,103,280 5,766,416 6,873,777 6,056,665 7,848,233 6,974,837 5,488,973 Total Colonial imports 47,309,908 50,469,656 5(1,618,920 Foreign.20,390.792 17,617,018 22,915,051 Total Import.67,700,690 69,088,674 73,563,971 Exports - Colonial.16,037,740 12,176,616 10.072,714 Foreign.3,035,19t 1,722,945 5,928,738 Total Exports ... 19,072,934 13,899,561 16,001,452 Residue Colonial ... 31,272,163 38,293,040 40,576,206 All sorts imported ... 48,627,756 54,187,113 57,562,519 Export of Home Growth 9,905,453 8,371,404 6,086,790 The same brokers report as follows: German wool has been bought cheaply this year, and helped to fix a standard, which, though it may be remunerative, has no doubt kept Australian wool more moderate than otherwise it would have been. No fears are at present entertained but that present rates will be supported ; indeed there appears a general confidence in a still- further advance before the close of the year. Buyers have fearlessly taken an ample supply and gone beyond immediate wants ; speculators to a moderate extent have appeared, and merchants have in some instances withheld part of their imports, estimated at 6,000 bales, in the hope Of finding their account in holding over. About 8,000 bales fresh arrivals have also come in since the opening, which forms a nucleus for the October sales. We have been much assisted by our foreign customers, though they do not appear to have taken so large a proportion as on some former occasions. We estimate their present purchases at 15,000 bales. We also note the following remark : Lambs' wool has maintained an active interest throughout, and some New Zealand wool with grease has reached a high relative value. Greasy Adelaide has been more steady ; it is frequently very earthy and stumpy. I THE VICTORIA THEATRE. There was an overflowing house on Saturday to witness Mr. Holt's performance of the beautiful but difficult character of Hamlet. The expectations of the audience, founded upon Mr. Holt's previous representations of Shaksperean characters, were not disappointed. It was indeed a masterly performance. The soliloquy " To be or not to be," &c;, and the instructions to the players, from which it occurred to us some of the corps dramatique might derive some useful hints, were beautifully delivered, and the scene in which Hamlet describes the points of the piece bearing upon the murder of his father, and introduced for the purpose of touching the conscience of the King" was very fine. His reproach of his mother was also a splendid scene, and indeed it would be difficult to point to any in which the ideas of the immortal author were not fully realised. Mrs. Holt sustained the character of the Queen with great ability and dignity. Whilst paying due homage to " the stars it would be unjust to overlook those of less magnitude, and we must do the whole company the credit to say they did their best to "play up to " their gifted leader. Mr Creswick was compelled to " double," personating not only the King but the Ghost, and very creditably did he acquit himself. Mr. Sefton, a very careful and improving actor, Mr. Wood, Mr. Musgrave, and Mr. Squires, are also deserving favorable notice. Miss Marie Nelson admirably sustained the character of Ophelia, but it occurred to us there was a slight error in the east, and that it would have been better had the character of the Queen been allotted to this lady. On the whole, however, the piece was extremely successful, the principal characters being honored with a hearty, call at the fall! of the curtain. " The Dumb Belle,"" in which the principal character was sustained by Miss Marie Nelson, concluded an evenings entertainment with which the audience appeared highly gratified. H.ISTRIONIC. A meeting of the Histrionic Class was held on Friday evening, Mr.H.L.Durieu in the chair. A resolution was passed to the effect that the Histrionic Class should perform on an early occasion, in aid of the Special Widow and Orphans Fund of the Order of Forresters. The pieces selected for performance were "Lend me Five Shillings," "The Mummy,'' and "Cool as a Cucumber," A SIXOHJLAB CmcuMsrAXCE.-On Saturday last, we were shown a bullock's heart, completelvossifieôî. The whole substance of the heart is turned" into the hardest bone of the finest grain ; it is in fact as. solid and heavy as would be a mass of ivory of the same size. This curious object was found by Mr. William Murray, some three months ago, when that gentleman was surveying upon Mr. MeKirlane's run on the Murray,.. The heart was found inside the skeleton of the bullock to which it had belonged. This skeleton was in good pre starvation,' and the opinion of the finder is, that the animal had died of the disease known in " ossification of the heart." We believe that this physiological curious by may be seen at the Ship Inn, Currie-street.
