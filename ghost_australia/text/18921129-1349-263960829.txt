The idlers on the blufts 1 I! depart by twos and threes. A broad 1 1|| yelJowTmdon lifts its luminous tace over HI the waters. A few large stars peep ffp silently .put. At last Mr. Dimisdale stands aibhe on the white cliffs, with the Hp hush of the summer eve about him. The BHi packet steams majestically on towards Bp: the wharves that cluster about the little K|||; city beneath him. lip" he V£$sel has been delayed, and he is veryAnktdus, very nervous, as he stands E|i there and watches it grow bigger and Mm bigger as it draws near the shore, and it Bill is positive relief to him when the pilot Bfjp bell clangs, and the people sivarm 111 eagefly .(down the wharves below. The El || long W is ; oyer, and very briskly he HI find joins that noisy throng, ji || The packet touched the landing ; the 1| cables were made fast, the gang-plank IS i was lowered, and then came the black H || string of passengers swarming from the HIP vessel's side. £: Mr. Dimisdale stood a little apart from B| thedWohlilnd waited Royal Karslake's coming. The crowd parted a little ; a Hp "'v drooping figure came down the gang- Hp plank, a deal of silver in the hair that H! used JiAhegdark, . a restless sadness in the HP eyes M| |s|dbto be/ so bold, a quantity of cl<WwA4etAljoufithe stern, imperious Hf lips of old ; and the ghost of the man Hffi' who spoke to Charlotte Dimisdale that H|l night on the yellow sands at Long Branch Hf came through the noisy throng and took gg| hw':kaHl|p|56iPfer hand. B " y<l?C«&;carned out my plans?" H "To the very letter, Royal. We stop at the Lord Warden Hotel to-night, and Biji at noon to-morrow we leave for Hp London." Ly/ H| This very Singular greeting was all that Hp/ passed bCTWfisft them, and turning away, K; Mr.jEarslakr Hiimmoned a cab to drive Hp. thenTtoTTHe hotel . HI'. He was exceedingly calm and collected HfV as be stepped into the lumbering old HI. vehicle and sank back in the dingy Hf cushions ; but Mr. Dimisdale was very Hi!! pale and very nervous, and his kinsman K noticed it. K " You seem agitated, John," he said, pi; In a solicitous voice, Has anything H I disturbed you ?" H| Mr. Dimisdale started a little, looked H confused, and finally managed to H stammer: H|, " When we have supped, there, there is K . something I wish.to show you — something H |: I cannot. thoroughly understand." Hf Mr. Karslaxe made no reply. What- Iever the cause of his kinsman's singular agitation, he knew he should learn it at 4 the allotted time, and sinking back in the H i:; faded cushions of the cab, he maintained Hp a meditative silence until they drew up H | before the doors of the Lord Warden. H |> Mr. Karslalce deposited his effects with H ft the burley porter and passing into the HI' hotel, the two gentlemen were conducted H |i to their suite of apartments. Supper was H I ordered and served in a little parlour, Hf| whose broard airy windows opened on Hj| ' the channel, giving a view to the moonlit Hfff waters in the distance and a glimpse of HH «!»' M'arM. oiv nf the fortifications of p.c .ur.M|ue old Dover. Hi Mr. Dimisdale's nervousness seemed r| to increase-as the meal neared its close, Hfm but Mr. IKarslake was cool, and calm, Hi and collected to the very last He, pushed back his chair when he had finished, rarig for the waiter to remove the remainder, walked calmly to the window, and stood looking out on the moonlit Chsnnel until the fellow had retired. " Well ?" he said, i i a questioning tine, wheeling round and facing his cousin, when the door had closed behind the waiter ; and Mr. Dimisdale, verv pale, very nervous, got up and faced him. " Don't be agitated at what I am about to show you, Royal," he said in A wavering voice, " .For God only knows what this mystery may mean. Come to the light a moment. I want you to look at this picture." His trembling hand slid into ail inner pocket as he spoke, and the photograph of a woman came ouc in the quiver ing fingers. " Tell me who looked like that, Royal, he said, as he put it it in his kinsman's palm ; and Mr. Karslake's eyes fell on the pictured face. One look — -only one — then with a gurgling, gasping, soul-sickening cry, he let the picture fall, and staggered blindly back. (To be continued).
