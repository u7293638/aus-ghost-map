THE HOER WOMAN. H is natural ami proper that a woman should'Hdniire and lore the country of lier adopt iou. At Hie same time thal is no reason why she should hate another people. 1 wonder What we have done some time or other to Olive Schreiner? In thc mouth of one of her sweetest characters she makes Napoleon the First a great hero, chiefly, it would seem, because he was beaten and im- prisoned by the English. Whatever we did she would hate us. Though she loves Gcr , many, and typifies all that is .lovable in the Fatherland in her South African stoiy, she forgets that Germany had any hand in the overthrow of Napoleon.

She sat on a chair in the great front room. . with 'her feet on a wooden stove, and wiped .her flat face with the corner of her apron, and drank coffee, and in Cape Dutch swore that thc beloved weather was damned.
