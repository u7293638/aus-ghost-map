THANGSGIVING SONNET. To God give thanks ! From every hill and plain The fruits of autumn crown the dying year — The ghost of flowery summer hovers near As if reeretful for her shortened reien. The harvest of the year revolves again — The wine of life is in the atmosphere For those to whom health holds her chalice clear, And healing comes from breath of ripened grain. Now o'er the gayly-decorated land The granaries are filled from base to brim ; The frost-sword strews the leaves on every band In combat with the sunbeams' rapiers dim : And heard throughout earth's scenes of beauty grand The grateful toilers chant their harvest-hymn. Dexter Smith, in Everywhere.
