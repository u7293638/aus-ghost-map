John Fenton; A ROMANCE OF THE SOUTH SEAS. VI. IT VV or not altogether in such peaceful ax oca tions as were described in our last issue that Renton's existence was spent The placid tenor of such a life was frequently interrupted by more stn ring incidents To all intents and purposes Renton had become to the savages as one of themselves He accompanied them on their of riding voyages in their wives, visited with them fi lendly v villages, and even in times of peace penetrated with them to the settlement of bush tubes, where at first he was still regarded as a sort of curiosity, a feeling which luckily found expression in most cases in his being made much of and ordered the host of every thing, especially in the way of eating In like manner he took part in the funds of his to be and accompanied them on more sanguinary expeditious Among these people, separated as they are into countless tubes 01 communities, peace was a very uncertain community Ever) action of their lives was pounded by their superstitions, and in no faith is the doctrine of the atonement of blood more prominently held or more practically carried out Yreiy telling circumstances might involve what, according to their beliefs, were awful and serious effects

were not to be appeased except by the death of some one, not a lesson day, however, the offender himself the idea of mentions sacrifice was a natural outcome of these ideas A man might find himself

and the witness of the village would take to those moons and set out on an expedition for no other purpose than to kill somebody, and thus i hey c then come side of the celestial displeasure

After a while it made its wavering way out of the hut, and flitted away through the village and out over the water, increasing in magnitude till it assumed the brightness and Bomblanco almost of a star As it quitted the body and flitted through the village, the watchers silently followed it, can barking all their canoes, and grimly paddling after it into the darkness of the night Where ever the light might go, further they would follow, preserving all the tune perfect silence It might take them to 11 village miles away, or it might circle round and bring them back to the very but they had started from, but in any case it would settle at last on the roof which sheltered the criminal Armed there, its form would again after and it would spread and swell till the whole but roof would appear as if throwing off tongues of pale and livid fire The avengers would await the conclusion, coining noiselessly as near as possible and before long the supernatural presence would affect the sleeper, who would be heard to moan and cry out in his sleep, oppressed with a nameless terror, bathed in sweat, the han of his flesh arising, and sometimes awaking with a start to rush out and bury himself in the bush, or fling himself into the sea, as if chased by some bombie thing Whatever might at that moment be his fate, the avengers would perhaps return to their homes IIB silently as they had quitted them. The man's fate was none the less decided He must die ! And thus another war would originate YVn do not propose to enter into speculation as to the amount of facts contained in this man ation, of the foundation for so extraordinary a superstition Renton himself did not profess to describe it from obsorvation,butmerely to repeat the accounts he received from natives Of the existence of the superstition, pretty much in the form in which he has given it, we have no doubt Although Renton is an intelligent and smart young fellow, we do not credit him with capacity to invent so weird a story Among communities which gave acceptance to superstitions so ticklish in their nature, it is apparent that constant feuds must unavoidably break out A little impulsive cursing might at any time cause the individual banned to feel under a necessity to take somebody's life, and the slaughter of a member of another tribe and a stranger would for obvious reasons be sacrificed would at once involve entire villages in open war It was well for Renton that he had time to become fairly naturalised among his captors before any troubles arose, as the com- em ence of knocking a friendless stranger on the head, in place of undertaking a perilous expedition in search of a native Melon, and of having at forwards to sustain the reprisals of his kindred, would undoubtedly have been too tempting to be withstood As it was, he chanced to fall into the islanders during piping times of peace" he easily formed an idea, however, as to the or dura y condition of affair s The v lllago worked o he lived was surrounded by a i unions and decayed breastwork of logs, the remaining tokens of a Home to siege which his enter tamers and mules gone What was the original cause, " the dire ful spring, of the "woes unnumbered which fell upon this South Sea Ttoy he unluckily did not gather Some trifling matter became aggravated by reprisals, till the inhabitants of this particular village found themselves threatened with the combined attack of an overwhelming force of other natives They had, however, sufficient warning to enable them to prepare for reSistance, and worked desperately cutting logs and rafting them from the mainland to their village, and meeting the solid and lofty breastwork which still i creams in places to testify to their labors They had their wooden tamping coin placed in good time, and shortly after its completion then foes, in countless canoes, swooped down upon them. The breastwork served its purpose by preventing the assailants from taking advantage of their superiority in numbers and storming the village according to the story, they did try to break through the weaker parts of the defences once or twice, but were repulsed, some very pretty fighting taking place on those occasions Foiled in this direction, they did just what any European army would probably have done much similar eiictunstancos 1 they now rested the place, and settled down to all the formalities of a regular siege and blockade the besieged found this i athel a serious matter They wore cut off ft out then water supply, and in default of fishing and turning became rapidly impo yet shed, especially) as they had to consume their national wealth in the form of pigs, Yt last, some desperate expeditions by night managed to slip through the circle of blockading canoes and bring back supplies of water in the same as in but 'for for n hopes of tlnsdoscnp riots became such desperate

Testament plan How over the) word successful in obtain- ing terms by HUH enduring to the enemy the lessons of one or two individuals who had been prominent in the troubles which originated the war With these expiatory offerings the besieging others were content, and forthwith raised the blockade and returned to their homes Una struggle was remarkable chiefly on account of the duration of the resistance offered and of the extent of the forces engaged Renton's acquaintance with this sort of business was not fated to be gained from hearsay only he took part with his tribe in various was like expeditious and also days On one occasion the inhabitants of a season i extended v village at Boitte distance had given his f i lends some gi IOV oils offered the first was declined past forgive ness, especially as it was considered that the gods had by the same matter, whatever it was, been insulted , from which it would appear that these savages are as ready as civilised people to discover that anyone who does anything distasteful to them at the suite into certainly insults Providence A Sudden uni against the offending village was consequently determined on, and just before dawn one morning

facing his pursuers, and diverting with the bow he held in his hand the allows whites were shot and the spires which were launched at his head So desperate was his aspect, that although twenty pursuers had dashed in after him, he held them at defiance and stood at bay, none during to attack him hand to hand and face to face At last, however, his fate carne A cunning walnut rind unobserved

habitations on the main island, close to the beach This raid was not quite so successful as the previous one The time of an i iv a] oQ the scene of action had not been so judiciously arranged, and the threatened tube saw the gallant warrior approaching, and incontinently Hid into the interior Burilad of then play, the invaders made the host of their disappointment by setting fire to the abandoned huts, and, as is the manner of gallant warriors of all nations, in effecting a reasonable amount of loss and Biiutung where they were unable to murder As they bustled about in the enjoy ment of this occupation, they were disagreeably interrupted on a sudden by a rapid succession of views falling among them, discharged by a single hero, who from the wing of the bush times resorted their proceedings According to Renton, this solitary patriot was in a state of mind much akin to that Ylalay a much that is to say, excited to a point approaching mama, and utterly regardless of his own life At any rate, he continued to shower his shafts on the men who were engaged in destroying his beloved home, regardless of the fact that a strong detachment of skirmishers had been detailed and wore rapidly cutting off his acts oat, and approaching him from behind, closing their ranks as they neared him He continued wildly to shoot his arrows, even when his enemies closed upon him, and was fitting another shaft to the string when a dozen weapons simultaneously clashed upon his skull, or were plunged into his body A few moments more and his carcass was mangled in a fearful manner, every raw lad on his first war expedition being eager to Flesh his maiden weapons, in order that on his return he might boost in the village how he had struck a mighty man of war Ultimately the headless carcass was heaved high in air on the points of a score of spears, and flung upon the blaming roof of the hut, the destruction of which its life had been thrown away to revenge In recounting these exploits, Renton, so i e cently removed from native influence and savage ideas, could not help warming up a bit, and his quickened utterance and flashing eyes showed that he had not yet dissociated the recollections from a sentiment of glory and district in SilenT man to tall man " Now, thin, look shy o, Harry !
