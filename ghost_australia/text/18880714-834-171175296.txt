Spoken in Anger. 'Twas hut a little word. in anger spoke, While proud eyes flashed through bitter burning tears ; : . But oh, I felt that fatal word had broken Tho cord of lov«' that hound out hearts for years. Tho tortured face, that long, wild look of sorrow, Like some pale ghost, must haunt mo while I live; And yet, hoiv bright, how full of ioy the mor row, j! fHnd I but breathed one simple word — ' Forgive !' I did not hear tho tonrter voice appealing, Nor marked thy anguish when I cried, 'Do-purt!' Too blind to seo thy pitying glance, reveal ing' The generous promptings of thy noble heart. How could I know that faithful heart was yearning, Though crushed nnd wounded to its inmost core, To take ino back, like a weary bird return ing. In fear and trembling when tl1)') storm is o'er. ' Remember, love, that it may bo f.orever; To Bee my face no more by night or day. Be calm, rash heart, think woll before wo sever, Recall the nn'rry word and bid mo stay.' Dead silence f el 1 ; the song-birds bus hed their singing. , ? ' Enough,' I nroudly cried ; ' I cl aose my ??' fate.' While oven through my maddened brain kept ringitg Tho death-knell of my love — too late., too late! ' Forgivo, forgive,' I wailed, the wild tears streaming, As, 'mid tho moaning trees, I stood alon e; ' Love, let thy kisses wako mo from my .dreaming.' . ' ?
