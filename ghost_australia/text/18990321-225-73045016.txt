INSULTINC A CONSTABLE. A NOMINAL FINE. At thelorsham Police Court-on Friday James Crick was charged, on the informa tion of Police-Constable Baudinette, before Mr. Rowan, P.M., and Messrs. Hocking and Zerbsr, J.P., ; with having behaved offensively within the hearing and light of the public. The accused was defended by Mr. Power. The constable's evidence was that about' half-past seven on the morning of Friday the 10th March, the defendant, to whom h previously had had to spcak s to hisbondncE, was behaving rowdily in front of the Far. mer's Union Hotel, in Wiltao-street. When remonstrated with, Grick went into a private room in the hotel, waved his arms over his head, and in a land and aggressive voice defied witness, saying, "Get out you long ghost, I can defy.you now." ' Later on in the morning Witness again surprised the defendant behaving rowdily. Mr. Power, for the defendant, said the ease was one that a more discreet constable would not- have brought. He asked. that no conviction be recorded, but that the de. fendant be canutioned not again to address police-coneattbles lightly. Mr. Rowan thought the charge should have been one of esing insulting worda rather than of offensive behavior. Police Sub-Inspector Charles contended that a man who had called a police-con. stable, in uniform, a "long ghost" had acted offensively. Mr. Rowan said the peace of the neih borhood mast be preserved. The defend ant was a inan who should know better than to have behaved as he had be haved. To let him off without pun. ishment would be, to establish a bad precedent, and would not be fair to the plice. A small fie would be imposed, the bench believing that fineb him at all uld e suflicoient punishment to a man A Sne of 5. was imposed. A. Arnott is a cash buyer for horsehair
