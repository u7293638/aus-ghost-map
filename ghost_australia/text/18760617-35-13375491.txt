Of these 14,195 were books (new or fresh editions) and pamphlets being an increase of 278 over those brought out in 1874. Of music, 4th sheets, books, or puts we e printed, being 304 more than in 1874. In the department of prints, including map and photographs, 2666 were issued, exceeding by 470 the number of the year before. ENCOURAGEMENT OF HEADING. The public reading-room of the National Library was used last year by 51,000 personS. There is another reading room, large and splendid, to which access is only obtainable by a card, the number of readers being about 5000. Great efforts are being made here to encourage a, dinner, to which the French, as a nation, are much less addicts d than he English and Germans. The Fairies of three of the arrondissements of Paris have recently founded popular libraries, and their example will, doubtless, be followed by others. Societies have also been formed for founding free libraries in all the towns of France and in all its garrisons. And in connection with the subject of leading it may be mentioned that an enterprising carriage-builder of this city, has begun to turn out carriages with a large pane of ground glass let into the top, so that those who '* ride " in them may " read," an inven- tion the' has already been adopted by some of the professional men here, who, being obliged to spend much of their day in driving about between their patients and clients, are glad to be able to read as they go. The vehicles thus fitted up are very light inside, and have a blind to shut out the light at pleasure. CAUSE OF THE AURORA BOREALIS. An interesting paper has just been read in the Academy of Sciences, from M. Plants, describing experiments made by him with a view to prove that the au t ora Borealis is caused by electricity. To this end he takes vessels, half filled with salt water, into which he introduces the electrodes of a powerful battery ; the positive one dipping deep into the water, and the negative one either above it, or skimming the surface, or dipping an inch or two into it. In the first case we see its extremity is surrounded with luminous particles forming a sort of garland; in the second, the water is depressed all round like a hollow hemisphere, darting luminous rays all round in the third case, the depression is still deeper, but jagged and irregular, or waving like a piece of c oth flapping in the wind, the phenomenon of fiery rags existing all round. M, P ante states that, owing to the salt water, the dominant colours of the rags are you own, purple, and violet, similar to those of the au ora Borealis (which, however, is more often rose-coloured or deep crimson in nature in the two latter cases, where depressions are made in the water, the latter is constantly tending to fill up the empty space ; thus new radiations are produced, closely imitating the darting of rays so characteristic of auroras. The obscure circle or segment caused in the latter by the haze or nebulous veil that the electric stream encounters in nature is represented in these experiments by the w every circle which surrounds the electrode, and around which the voltaic current ex- Bands. The water is violently agitated by the electric last ; whirlpools and luminous rings are formed by the shocks of electrified waves against each other, and, if we operate with but a small quantity of water, a luminous ebullition is finally generated, answering to the fluctuation of light that is also a characteristic of polar-auioras. LUNAR INTLUEXC-. The violent plunge which we have just made into a new winter (saying but little for the perspicacity of the swallows, as whom, however, only a very few showed themselves, and for a day or two only is supposed to be due to the disastrous influence of a line coarse (the red moon), so called because its night frosts redden the buds of trees, and which is considered here as the most mischievous month of the year in an agricultural sense. The popular belief in the influence of our pale satellite, usually scouted by the learned world, has found a defender in the well known writer on scientific subjects, M. de Carville, who says that when the air is charged with water in the shape of clouds, a small increase of temperature suffices to re transform the clouds into vapour. The moon transmits to us a certain portion of the sun's rays ; most of the heat received by the me on from the sun is absorbed by the clouds ; but we get, say learned astronomers, from each ray of moonlight, about as much warmth as we should get from the flame of a candle at a distance of 33 feet. Small as is this amount, Made Parville argues that it would suffice to dissipate the clouds that float in the atmosphere at altitudes of from 5000 to 6000 motVrs. Our atmosphere, besides, is in a state of compression at the time of the full moon of April and this, also, tends to clear- away the clouds. From these two causes, combined, he argues it is by no means impossible that the moon may really have something to do with the sudden return of cold which always occurs about this period of the year. It is, in fact, on the nights when the air is free from clouds that the most destructive of the terrible ''spring frosts " usually occur. RAISING THE VANGUARD. The body of French engineers is naturally much pleased that one of their body should have been selected by the British Admiralty, among 450 competitors for raising the wreck of the great in clad, the Vanguard. The plan proposed by this gentleman is certainly ingenious; as he will employ several thousands of iron balloons, that is to gay, hollow spheres filled with compressed air, they will give a floatin-'-powei of several thou- and toss, and he will be att ched by books to the body of the vessel Vi" the trio a d of li -> Heating j over thus obtain and, the huge mass is to be ra s d fr in its vi a ' i y i ed, and t w ed it the all. w water, is near will be taken into a d y dock for repairing All the air engineers of Europe are latter said there had in the matter, and will fail in the infest us aft mast of the successful pi mp titor with the union t attention and will visit The value of the sunken vessel is estimated at £100,0.0 MUSICAL LADIES.
