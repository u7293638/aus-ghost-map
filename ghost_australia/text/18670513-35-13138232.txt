MR. PICK, THE GOLD MINER. LETTER I. tfYuir. the Sydney Mail, May 11.) Mr'. lIC. Ol'KNf- 1915 SUBJECT. I am the holder of a miners right Well, what can well make out of that And let us ideal, let me tell you it makes a gentleman of me, gives me it once the genuine stump of a legitimate taxpayer, and makes me a landed proprietor, and owner of half an acre of ground wherever I uni choose to peg it out Talk of your free selector, why he is nothing compared to the miner, who can go, for ten bob, upon any Crown land, root about for gold and peg out his half acre for residence there 8 no fear of his being brought up under the Vagrant Act, for there he is with his occupation, legalised by Government parch- ment, and his place of residence given to him as his own against all corners by Act of Parliament Its my opinion that we find not the lawyers, ought to be called gentlemen by Act of Parliament It don't always follow that because a fellow has a miner's right that he 6 a miner I've known it takes its i blind many a time by chaps who have been on some other game-making gold without the trouble of digging and washing for it Well you see it knocks the police into a cocked hat, when they pull a fellow up for he is only got to show his bit of parchment and he is all right He is an authorised miner, has a local residence, and is owner of half an acre block if he likes to peg it out I can t one of these sort I'm A miner-that's the fashionable term now a day although a bit ago, we went t too proud to be called diggers I like that name best It seems to speak out more for a feller, and to say, are hardworking chaps, and sin t aft and of si) ing so 1 began digging on the Melbourne side, and have worked on a most all the diggings there I was kidded over here to the Sydney side by that precious Rocks rush, and since then I've been at all the rushes as ever set in from here I was victimised at Rockhampton, made a pretty good haul it Kiandra , dropped into a pretty good claim lit Tipperary Gully, after coming to 1 Lambing Flat got cleared out of every cent I had at the I lachlan, and sunk six. du flers at Emu Creek 1 didn t go to the Burrier, though I find everything picked up ready for a start, and should have loaded up old Is suggest that is my horse-on the Tuesday morning, when your paper came up to the Creek, saying it was all in here, and there was no gold, So I did it go And this just puts me in mind of a thing 1 in ty is well tell you, the miners always have a go in at your paper Perhaps its because its best established, and because men don stare about abusing what isn't really firmly fixed Perhaps its because its come to be considered the thing to abuse your paper, as every body) goes at it in turn, and of course we follow suit -But with all our abuse we don't read any thing she and what is more, we don t pay attention to any thing but what we see in the Herald and Vate, for blow them up us we may, we know that the have always the latest and most reliable information Y eil, now, truth all my) journeyings and rushing, you may) reckon that I've seen a good piece of Australia, and had a look at most of the diggings in New South Wales If I hadn't been pretty tough I couldn't have done half I have done I must have caved in long ago I fine I must be a kind of mixture of quartz and ironbark, conglomerated and case hardened, to have gone through all I'v 3 had to face I've been floored by dysentery, bunged up by blight, and laid on the broad of my back by colonial fever Ive tricked me) back, smashed my leg, dislocated an) arm, and broken my ribs Ive been carried two miles down a flooded river, Ive been closed up in a drive by the shaft caving in I've been snowed up and frost-bitten I've tumbled down a thirty-foot shaft, and me and my five mates fought it out underground in a drive with ten or a dozen lips, in the dark, with picks, shovels, and quartZ nuggets-and kicked 'em too I've stood a deal, as well as seen a deal, and if I ain't pretty well marked and tattooed, it's a caution "Why, there in t n mark or a man on me that hasn't got a butor) I lost and a history that it wouldn't hurt none of my) fellow miners to heir, is perhaps it might give cm a winkle Then I don t travel about the country, in any chaps do with my eyes shut I look pretty) well about me and, putting this and that together I fancy) I can la) cm on to a thing or two, and that a 1 how I come to write to you knowing m how my brother miners read your paper in preference to nil) other reel I should like them to see who it a fellow li is footie through in his time His decent shave ever I had Seas that time when I was block 1 id up in Hu drive I was working it the for cial that saved me Two of his) mates were at the bottom of the shaft, drawing out the vi ash dirt and sending it up by the windlass The man at the windlass mew the earth giving way in the shaft and called out to them to take care I he) bolted into the eli ive, but they el no sooner got there than a large patch of the shaft caved in making down with it a beat ten or a dozen feet of the roof of the drive M) two poor mates were but ltd under the fall of earth and lived the life crushed out of them before they could so me "If this groan At all events I heard no sound from cm I heard the rush and the dull thump of the earth as it fell, and thought they hooked on the dirt bucket badly and let it come down smash So I sung out "Now, then' "N hat the leases are ye up till I looked round and the heart came into my mouth and the last words I had used seemed suit in tk to me in mockery for they hung about my ears a if unable to get money There was no gleam of light to be seen, and I held up my candle to see what was the extent of the damage I saw the earth totaled at one spot' I went towards it, cleared away the dirt, and saw a hard working convulsively I seized it and gave a pull thinking I might perhaps clear the poor chap Ricas you, there were ten or twelve tons of earth i top of him for immediately after the first fall of faith there was a second and third that brought down the windlass and stage, and all but filled up the shaft Of course, I didn't know this, but I began to take stock when I found myself shut up, and the first thing I did was to blow out my) candle I knew I should want every) bit of the num- the drive without letting the candle consume am of it. It was a very pleasant sitting there in the dark for I could do nothing but I had to put up with it the worst of it was that with those two poor fellows lying there, crushed and dead within a few feet of me, I couldn't help fancying that I should soon be with 'me How - ever, I plucked up a bit when I heard cm at work clearing out the shaft there was no want of help A thousand men would have been in and at it if there had been room enough for them to work he) did work, and no mistake, as I was afterwards told "me at it as only a digger can, and relieving each other every quarter of an hour or so we all heard era commence at work, and heard em go on and go on, until at last it seemed to me they were going off further and further from me, and then I felt a queer kind of feeling, not altogether unpleasant and then there was a sound like little tinkling bells, and music like that make b) harps, and then I suppose I dropped to sleep or something, for I recollect nothing until I found myself in my tent, with my mates as were left and a long ghost of a doctor standing over me ' 'house had a close shave, said the doctor, with a grin all over his face and looking is he wished there d been no share at all in the matter, but that he 'd had the cutting of me up, and the two guinea fee for the post mortem is When s fern and Dill I asked, but I knew precious well in my own mind that it was a settler with them the) re laying out there by the side of the shaft. The Commissioners going to inquest cm og soon as ) on are right "Right!' says I, " What is wrong with me and I tried to jump up, but I staggered like a drunken man when I got to my feet, and should have gone over like a cock if my mates had not laid hold of me Id been six hours under ground and was nigh upon smothered folks said as they wondered how Iel pulled through, and its my of Union that I should have come out of it is I did it 1 el have let that candle burn another minute longer Whatson of mv experiences and I'll give you some more of cm is I goon besides telling you a bit r two (if what I've seen at different places and de curbing some of the coves I've met with Rare rum e large ters I have come across it times people of all sorts miners squatters squatters men and officials, swagmen and bagmen letters, cross coves, and high way men I've seen a little of all of em and if I can only kcepmvsclf it it, as I mean to do at present, though there is no knowing how long I may continue in the some humour, I 11 see if I cm that out a few sketches for you, to let the people of Sydney know what the life of a digger really is and that its ideal besides gold that he gets and that when he makes a haul he generally) has to pay pretty dear for it Your obedient servant, PETER PICK.
