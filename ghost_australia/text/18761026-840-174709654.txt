I belicvo was £5)000 or £6,000, and this proporty, I have hoard, has been added to since to tho extent of 293 acres, at, I think, a conditional valuo of £300 or £400, as tho books will show ; I therefore fail to seo how John Harris can stato that thoso properties wero Becured to tbo trustees of Mrs. A. A. Biddlo in 1867, whon thoy wero only vested in him in 1871 and 1873; and I fail to understand by what process ho arrived at £500 boing tho market value of a freehold estate, -with very conBidorablo improvements, and a largo quantity of suporior agricultural land, and consisting of 1,GG3 acres, oxelusivo 'of resorves and roads on tho islands, that has cost £7,000 or £8,000, and that ho bought from tho firm at a coBt of £5,000 or £6,000. This closed the examination by Mr. Hely, on behalf of tho official trusteo. Tho coso is still proceeding. (
