THE NOBLE ART. BY THE GHOST OF BURNS. Is there for British bravery, Talk o' Prize-fights an' a' that, The Ring's but brutal knavery, Men can be brave for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, "Auld English sports," an' a' that, "Champion," is but a bully's boast, The man's a brute for a' that. What tho' they frien'ly like shak' han's, Talk o' fair play an' a' that— Ca' bulldogs by what name ye like, The brute's a brute tor a' that. For a' that, and a' that, Their hideous smiles an' a' that, A manly man will fight a foe, But nae for gowd and a' that. Ye see yon blackleg on the sward, Wha laughs, an' swears, an' a' that, He's—tho' Bell claims him for a lord— A baptiz'd brute for a' that, For a' that, an a' that, His bluid-won bets an' a' that, An' Englishman wi' noble mind, Wad loathe gain got by a' that. The Ring may mak' a belted man, A braggart rich, an' a' that, But manly men it never can, They ruffians are for a' that. For a' that, and a' that, Their "noble art"—an' a' that, The brave in heart, an' brave o' han', Nae fight for gear an' a' that. Then let us sing, down with the Ring, Its bluid an' gore an' a' that, Auld Englan's might for Englan's right, Will bravely fight for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, Their science, belts, and a' that, Englishmen, aye, at honours ca', Will heroes be for a' that.
