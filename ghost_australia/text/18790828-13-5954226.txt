ST. PAUL'S WRITINGS. The Bishop of Melbourne delivered the fourth of his series of lectures on "The Development of Doctrine in the Writings of St Paul, in St Pauls Church, yesterday afternoon There was a very large congrega- tion The Bishop said in my last lecture I brought down the history of Christian doctrine to the period when, for the first time, the Gospel had been preached to the Gentiles while in the church of the circumcision there had been produced by the special interference of God a reluctant acquiescence in what had been done The position of affairs then was briefly this in the Church of Jerusalem, as Reuss has well put it, " there slept as yet as in an infant newly born, not only the various phases of thought and influence which might one day manifest themselves in forms of heresy, his also the consciousness of a high destiny, and of the possession of the power which was to subdue the world, not by patience only but also by action and progress In the Gentile churches, on the other hand, there were springing up, sporadically, germs and beginnings of a new life, so bright so strong so promising that if only the right leader or leaders could be found it promised to grow into grand and astonishing proportions A new world was quicken mi, and coming to the birth All it needed to make it start into full and glowing life was the electric touch of a mightily stimulating enthusiasm Where was the man then to be found who was worthy to become the organ of this great work ? Christ found him arrested him, subdued him, on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus About this matter there is no dispute We have authentic letters of St Paul, which have extorted the admission from Baur himself that at any rate the apostle believed himself to have seen Jesus Christ, and to have been suddenly taken captive by Him This admission can be shown to involve the concession of a miracle But for my purpose the admission itself is enough A great work was waiting to be done For the doing of it two qualities were needed-first the power to kindle a quickening life, and, secondly, that to quell a rising opposition for the first there was needed a passionate engrossing enthusiam [for spiritual things, for the second, a large and learned acquaintance with the principles of the antagonists combined with a practical con- vision of the worthlessness of their methods Such a man it would be hard to find in any og- Luther was such a man feeling as a Christian the need of renewing grace, knowing as a monk the uselessness of ascetic practices to win it Paul was such a man-feel sing as an Israelite the need of a new birth knowing as a Pharisee the uselessness of ascetic formality to gain it Christ needed him, and Christ called him (as the apostle always felt and confessed) by grace divine By Barnabas who knew him, he is now summoned to throw the whole strength of his wonderful mind and heart into the work at Antioch The grace of God visibly a A mightily helped him Believers multiplied, and as light increased and love of souls and the sense of power to do great things, the to e of the Saviour was once again heard, arg is in its might-' Go and make disciples of all nations But who should go' Through those to whom God had given piercing prophetic insight into the hearts of men the Holy Ghost said Separate me to this work Paul and Barnabas S^'f-uwly with prayer and fasting, they set apart these dedicated souls, and as they went forth, two obscure and boI story Wayfarers, into the dark places of heathenism a new chapter was opened in the religious history of mankind To stand on these lonely heights at the spring and outbursts of these incalculable forces almost takes away one's breath How "can we observe with a quiet eye when the windows of heaven are opened and the fountains of the great deep are broken up' And yet if for a moment we can overcome at excitement, and ask ourselves quietly whether the first recorded sermon of the Apostle Paul contain the sharpcompleted out lines of that Gospel which 12 or 15 years later he embodied in the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians we shall be constrained to answer that they do not The fundamental thought is there, the inspiring conviction that by union with Christ forgiveness and life are brought near to Jew and Gentle But how this is to be-how the death of Christ is to be the life of the world how grace is to take the place of law, and faith is to justify instead of obedience-this is not made plain Two sermons of St. Paul on his first missionary journey-one to Jews, and the other to the Gentiles are reported to us in the Acts of the Apostles Only the former can help us to answer the question What were the apostle s views at this time on the place and functions of the law ' This sermon to the Jews at Antioch inPieidia is a very interesting one Mainly it pursues the same line as that followed by St. Peter on the day of Pentecost. It connects the Lord Jesus with the seed of Abraham, cites His resurrection as a proof that He was Messiah and further proves from the Psalms that such a resurrection ought to have been expected But the words which specially con- cern us are some which occur towards the end of the sermon (Acts xi , 38 39) These words strike a new note St Peter had declared that forgiveness of sins should come through Jesus Christ, but he had not said one word about the insufficiency of the law for anything that St Peter advances to the contrary a Christian convert might still continue to be as zealous for the law as before his change St Paul denies this and here, in this denial, we have the first unmistakable note of the Pauline gospel A voice out of the inner life of one who as he shows us in Bom who. had striven and striven in vain, to do as the law bade him The law could command but, as he had found, it could not enable If any soul of man were to become just before God. it must be through a union with Christ and not by the death" of the law But, how through union with Christ' How was Christ's death connected with many forgiveness How was Christ's resurrection connected with man's life ? To such questions as these there is as yet no explicit answer St Paul knew, as a fact, that through faithmChnathe passed into a real mystic union with the Saviour, and that through this union he had gained strength and inward peace He states the fact clearly enough, but about the manner of it he says nothing as yet Baur endeavours to account for the peculiarly intermediate position of this speech by the assumption that as the author of the Acts had made St Paul talk long enough in the manner of St Peter he must now make make him say something specially Pauline (second Works of Paul, vol I , p. 100 ) Even PUeiderer, willing as he is in general to admit the truth 'alness of St Luke a narrative, complains that here the more precise sense in which Paul regarded the death of Christ and justification is not to be found (Pauline, vol II p 246 ) Now, on what does the force of these objections depend Clearly on the assumption that at the beginning of his career fat Paul had definitely formulated to himself all his doctrines that he not only felt in general that his living connexion with Christ had come into the place of legal obedience but that he had stated to himself in definite terms the manner in which this living connexion availed to him ASSume that as our popular teachers too often do-and there is no answer or at any rate no satisfactory answer to the criticism of Baur But deny that deny that doctrine sprang into being in a moment in the full maturity of its logical form-and the whole compact mass of this criticism is disintegrated and falls to the ground by its own weight Thus when it is objected that the teaching of St. Paul in this Sermon occupies a position intermediate between that of St Peters sermon and that of the later Pauline epistles, the answer is precisely so because at this period the mind of St Paul was in that position He had got beyond St Peter for he put a living connexion with Christ into the place of the law as a means of justification , but in respect to the manner in which the cause led to the effect he had still something both to learn and teach Affirm development, and you have here a proof of genuineness Deny development and then, as Baur argues you S"r"?.BU?geBtlon of, invention You will see hereafter how completely the spear of adverse criticism is shattered to pieces this sS te,kevelTCei'\alcmg tt»wholB -ne of at rate "nTet£ïî)mE9n Boh001 assume, with fl?*E"".orthodox, we are entitled to look for the whole gospel in every epistle and part of an epistle But their conclusion in different Instead of saying, if we fail to find it we will import it, they conclude if we fail to find it we cannot admit that the passage is Paul s It is time, however, to proceed with main subject of our consideration in the Eenod we last reviewed the primitive church and before it this truth Jesus Christ has pa8sedintothe hearts of the Gentiles therefore they are our brethren It was hard enough as we saw, for Jewish Christiana to admit that But now in the teaching of St Paul they were confronted with something far harder-that man could not be justified before God by the law of Moses If so, they felt at once and they felt truly, the supremacy of the law is gone If, through his connexion with Christ, a Gentile could be justified without the law, the same must be equally true about the Jew, and circumcision, with ltaprivilcgesandtradition, with its learning and prescriptions, are already things of the past It is easy for us to think these things But to an Israelite of the first century, whether believer or unbeliever such a sentence would sound like the crack of deem it meant to him the passing away of a world, the surrender of beliefs which had been his soul a shelter since childhood, of thoughts, feelings, and prejudices which had been built into the very structure of his inner life And remember all these feelings and beliefs were quick and strong To cast down Paganism was to cast down a dead thing, a thing which had as little real hold upon the human heart as a stone idol had on the earth upon which it stood But to cast out Judaism was to tear away that which had struck living roots into the very substance of a Jew b life, it was to lacerated his spirit, and to leave him bleeding and half dead It was in such a state of feeling as this, that now for four or five years the statement that a man could not be justified by the law of Moses had gone ranging from end to end of the Jewish world-from Jerusalem to Press, to Alexandria to Babylon In every syria gogue, every church of JewishChnatians the effect of it was much as if we heard to day that the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Pope of Rome had declared that a man could be justified without it It was an awful desolating negation Everywhere Jewish Christians rose in arms In Jerusalem especially a party was organised to offer opposition. St Paul, they knew, was preaching at Antioch that a man could be justified without the law, and if any man, then a Jew They therefore sent emissaries to confront him with the counter assertion no man can be justified without the law We care nothing about the case of Cornelius, nor of any other Gentile The Spirit may have been given to such men, but not less is the law necessary to them Every Gentile must keep it every Gentile must be circum creed An opposition so direct was felt to be irreconcilable Feeling ran high Parties were formed The whole future of the church was in peril, for these emissaries from Jerusalem claimed to speak with the authority of the apostles Only one resource remained to refer the whole matter in dispute to Jerusalem Barnabas and Paul went to re- present the case of the Gentiles, that of the Jews needing no special advocate But here another critical question emerges Had these Judaiaera the right to plead the authority of Peter and James and John for what they Bald ? V, as it a conflict between Christian truth and Jewish reaction, or one between apostle and apostle * Strange to say a conflict has raged in modern times around this question only less v violent than that which the apostles met to consider Baur and the Tubingen school affirm that the Judaisera were justified in their claim, and that the conflict was actually between apostle and apostle They bring forward in proof of this position such alleged contradictions between the accounts of these transactions given in the Epistle to the Galatians and in the Acts of the Apostles as are sufficient to invalidate the authority of the latter and to overturn the conclusion therein suggested, that there was no quarrel between the apostles Baur a arguments are shortly as follow -1 In the Acts we have an account of a public meeting, while in the Epistle to the Galatians note word is said of such an assembly, the Apostle only speaking of a private conference with those who were of reputation Cer family, of these accounts refer to the same meeting, the variations in them are be considerable as to constitute a serious difficulty I think, however, that the slightest examination will show that they do not refer to the same meeting From the Epistle to the Galatians we see that the apostle a mission was the occasion of serious disputes at Jerusalem He tells us of false brethren unawares brought in who came to spy out his Christian liberty, and to insist upon it that Titus should be circum creed The same disputes are referred to in the Acts There St Luke tells us that " there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying that it was necessary that the Gentiles should be circumcised, and should keep the whole law In short it is apparent from both accounts that St Paul found himself face to face in Jerusalem with his old adversaries Clearly, then, an opposition be public as this could only be publicly met and overcome Whether there for, St. Paul tells us of a public conference or not, we know that such a conference must have been held But why should there not also have been a private meeting between St Paul and the other apostles ' Did not the circumatances make such a meeting necessary ? Could it be hoped that a peaceful conclusion would be reached in a public meeting without some previous understanding amongst the leaders ? And plainly the very words of St Paul point to the calling of such a meeting For what was the subject of his communication He made known to them the Gospel which he preached to the Gentiles So frank a communication was absolutely necessary to the apostles But it had neither been necessary nor wise in the existing state of public feeling, to make so open a disclosure at the public conference And accordingly St Luke tells us that the Apostle Paul declared in public, not the doctrines which he had taught, but the work which he had done But then it may he asked, supposing there to have been two meetings, how is it that St. Luke tells us of the one and St. Paul of the others Plainly, the purpose of the writer in each case determined his choice of materials St Luke is writing a brief history of the church, and of course he would refer to that meeting which, by its public decree, had a visible influence on church history St Paul on the contrary in the Epistle to the Galatians, ia vindicating his apostolic authority against the attack of the Judaisera, and refers, of course, as naturally to those con- ferences with his brother apostles, in which it was shown first that they had nothing to add to the truth which he taught no any thing to take away from the apostolic authority which he had exercised I have gone carefully over every objection started by Baur and Pfleiderer and I can honestly say that the result has been to confirm my belief in the truth of St Luke 8 account down to the minutest particular But suppose it otherwise suppose that we had to abandon the Acts of the apostles, and to rely only on St Paul b account of these transactions what evidence is forthcoming from the Epistle to the Galatians that the false brethren had the countenance of apostles for what they did ' There is absolutely none This foundation i (stone of the whole fabric of Banr s criticism re1- s simply upon an unsupported hypo i insane Not in the whole region of scholarly criticism did I ever beheld by imposing a I structure resting on such weak founda tions For what are Baur s arguments'' 1 We may conclude that St. Paul had to do with apostles and not merely false brethren, by the earnestness with which he defends his gospel As if it were not enough to make a man earnest to have to fight against the ablest and most energetic men of the Judaistngparty, backed by thecreatmassof the church at Jerusalem 2 But if urges Baur, the apostles of the circumcision agreed with St Paul, why did they not join him in his mission to the Gentiles The reasons are plain enough Some of the apostles must undertake the work (at that time the most extensive) among Jewish Christians St Paul could not because he was unpopular amongst them He saw too clearly the opposition between grace and law to be able to preach a gospel of conciliation The other apostles, on the contrary, while agreeing with St Paul s essential principles, found the work among Jewish converts congenial to them They could preach, they desired to preach, less polemically And thus with the deepest wisdom the work most congenial to him was assigned to each But again, asks Baur, if St. Peter had been convinced of the merely relative value of the law could he have been guilty of such double i dealing towards the Christians of Antioch answer that this fault of St. Peter is the strongest possible argument that in the main he agreed in doctrine with St Paul For if not, if in that lamentable scene at Antioch St Peter had merely been carrying out his own principles how could St. Paul have charged him with inconsistency, and upon that ground have administered to him severe a rebuke? Baur s argument, I say without hesitation breaks down along the whole line, and by the careful examination to which it has driven me, has served more than all the orthodox commentaries I ever read to convince me of the absolute trust worthiness of the Acts of the Apostles In what position, then, let us ask did the council of Jerusalem leave the question we have been examining' Did (t offer a final solo tion thereof Iii no means It left the question of pr ciple exactly where it found it Its decree was a compromise. The Gentiles were not to be circumcised But Jews might be Grace, without law, was enough for a Gentile But there was no positive affirmation of the logical conse office first Pauls Preaching, that it was equally sufficient for a Jew Nay, by the concessions which it recommended to Jewish prejudices in the mixed congregate of Syria and Cilicia it rather favoured the opposite conclusion, that circumcision was at least innocent for the Jew Was it without valuable result then? By no means By its wise and loving consideration for prejudices which it could not remove it delivered the church from a deadly danger It averted schism with all its bitter and narrowing influences It bridled self will It rebuked the insane licence which would destroy the church to get its own way Above the rising clamour of bigots ready to fly at each other 8 throats, it made its Divine Master s words to be heard, " A new commandment give I unto you that ye love one another '* Orthodoxy may be much, but love is more. True, it was not able, nor did it desire to stop the course of spiritual thought, advanc- ing slowly but surely under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to its destined goal ; but, by reminding the Christian Jew that he was nearer in heart to tie Gentile who loved Christ than to the Je v who hated him, it seemed that the stream of doctrinal development should flow quietly within the banks of permitted opinion, instead of breaking all be kinds of love and unity to desolate the plains it should have enriched. To indicate the further course of that stream, I must now forsake the region of history, and betake myself in my next lecture to that of prophecy and doctrine
