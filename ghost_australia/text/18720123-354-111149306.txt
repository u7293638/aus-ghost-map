Either thecotony we live in is very badly off for political leaders of the right description, or ihe'eK6tors 'irrusi be -aWrt -tlwrirost dfntcdltfcdr please under the sun. It would, indeed, be hard to find any .country, where responsible government exists* that, fot repeated changes of administration, caii compare with New South Wales., Session after Session has been wasted while the ins and outs have been doing, battle:' 'the people meanwhile waiting. for the; practical legislation that came not The fag *nd i-( the sittings of Parliament 'have 'alone be^,devpU;dv.toJl^.cx)widexfttion.ofcmd.ean(l!. ill-digested measures, resulting in imperfecti. and unsatisfactory statutes, assented to. by '-at portion of their representatives only. 1 Now,' as 'the electors differ 'not' materially) yvith their' fellows' in other lands, and as' we, find the latter, content to let .certain' mini^triesi abide for years, we feel justified in concluding khat the fault does not lie with' the -people.; !WitH their leading men then must be the failing, and we are greatly supported in, this, ? view by the. records of the past, which shew, unmistakeably how wanting we have been ini statesmen of the right stamp. One thing, however, we must not overlook, . and that is . the absence of any really great questions. on which .politicians could well, divide ; issue having, invariably, been taken on minor mat ters,- more suitable, as a rule, for. the decision of a vestry meeting than of a representative' assembly. There has also been notable absence of new talent. The various administrations when examined as to their component parts; showing a mere ringing of the changes on 'several well-worn names, or, when at any time an outsider has been admitted into the charmed circle, it has been generally discovered that he has received the entree at the last moment, in jthe vain hope that his 'adhesion might help id : uphold a doomed cause. The, .reason for all '. this is obvious. . Talent and ability we have in abundance— to doubt this would be to insult the whole colony— but it is unavailable, as our. talented and ab^e men' have either a dis-* taste for public life such as we know it; to be; or are; deficient of, the .wherewithal neaes-, sary to support them independently whilst at* tending to their parliamentary duties. Thus,'; ignorance and presumption too often' sit in the' seats of our representatives, and men,' not measures, are the test, of fitness for our rulers. We are, in a measure, forced into this line of comment, by that' which we have both read and heard since the election of Mr. Parkeg for. Mudgee. Prior to his return for that- elec- torate he was almost universally looked upon as the only man who could, giving a spirit of unity to the Opposition, enforce a : dissolution of the, Jipuse by successfully'; 'attacking the present Ministry. Hope beat high. At last there was a' prospect of the days of the Unholy Alliance being numbered. There was one coming who ,^tnew^r;sO;- t'was. said, how to draa all their' deeds of. darkness into the broad flight ;ojt ?'.';4s3ft: ^^d ;co4 found their evil machinatibns ; who'- would drive them from the /seats they/were Isd un worthily occupying, and . expose the shams with which, for awhile, 'they . had succeeded in deluding and dupingiheir supporters. No sooner,, however, had, his constituents returned him by ' au! overwhelming majority than, we - are gravely assured, that, should he succeed in his avowed, determination of ousting the present occupants-' ffom oJBce, .weim&y; possibly have, as before, 'a 'Ministry an3 a policy j' in other words, th'e'couit'try1 shall biWbette'r underlie ofte tha^ the other.
