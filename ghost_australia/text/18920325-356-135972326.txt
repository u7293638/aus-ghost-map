A WOULD-BE STOWAWAY. The Tlalatta's Whost DuRING Wednesday night the watchman on board the ship Thalatta, which was lying loaded in the harbour, ready to sail for San Francisco, received a shook to hia nervous system that will take many a long and strong pull of diluted aqua to bring him back to a state of composure. It seems that when patrolling the de-ke he perceived a de moniacal-l)oking visage present itself5sboro one of the hatches, woth glaring eyes fixed. towards the heavens and a huge mouth wide open, as if ready to swallow anything from a gnat to a camel. Ient being desirous of penetrating into the affairs of what he took to be a visitor from the lower regions he, with a quiver about the knees, and a thump thump in the left side, notified the captain, who, after arming himself, pro. coeded to the spot, but nothing was there to be seen. However, the hands were called out and the hatches battened down. In the morning Senior Wator-Police Gonstable Harrison was notified of the strange visitor. He smiled as the tale was told, and soan after arrived on board with a search party and a couple of lanterns. The hold was scoured, and right afe, lying on the coal, an .able bodied stowaway was discovered, thus a - ravelling the mystery of the Thalatta's ghost. On reaching the deck the man gave his name as Sweeney, and stated that he had gone on board lost Sunday with two loaves of bread and a German sausage, on which he had subsisted since then. As he could get no work here he wanted to go back to the States, hence his appearance on board. On reaching the lookup it is needless to say that the feed of bread and water disappeared quickly.
