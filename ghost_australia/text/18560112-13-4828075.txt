From papers received by the Clasmerden we make the following extracts :— THE WAR IN ASIA. (From the Times, 27th Oct.) There can be no doubt of the importance of the events which the next few months will bring to pass in Asia. It is one of the advan- tages of the Allies in the present war that Russia has plunged into hostilities at a period of her aggrandisement when her outlying conquests are defended by no strong lines of frontier, and bilon lui own communie ttions with them han bun bioufeht to piiliitiou Alicuinfioling oiatbibtliall assimilated tlioy lie easy of % iss to an mi udor « ho comma ids the sea while the

Attei the îcview the Empi-ioi inspected the «oiks of the fortifications which arc b-'ing constructed between the Ingoul and the Bug. Dining the morning ol that day (Oot. fi) intelligence was îcceiveJ b} telctjiaph that the cuemy'b fleet, consisting of 74 iessels, had appealed off Odessa, and had aucboieel at 3J miles fiom that city. On the 9th of October the Emperoi pro- ceeded m a steamer to the village of Maliiia Koienikha, situated on the opposite bank of the Bug, and inspected the fortifications which aie being constiucted theic. TURKEY IN ASIA. The following intelligence also appeals in the Invalide Russe : Gcni'tal Mouiavieff announces, under the date of the 80th of Septeiuboi, tlint having boen infoimed the Tuikish tiOO]is Lad îeceived leinforcements in tho iieinity of Btitoum, and that the enemy pio posed to nitike a movement upon the Gouiiel iiutl Akhaltbyk, and at the same time advance fiom Eizeioum upon Kais, he lesolved to at- tack the lattei foiticss on the 29th. Tinco columns weie selected for this opeiation, the fust inidci the comnund of Lieutenant Gencial Kovalevsky, tlu bccond undei Majoi-Gcneral Maydel.an I the thud under Majoi - Gencial Count M}tod. In addition, an inteimediate column was foimed, commanded bv Gencial Piincc Gagaiino, as well as a geno l.il reserve, confided to Lieutenant-Geiiural Biummci. Finally, a detachment, led by M i ,101-Geueral Bazinc, was intended to act ac coiding to special ordois. The columns marched to the attack in the gieatest order ana with the gioatest intrepidity. The attack of Majoi Gcncial Bazinc was even crowned with succcsb; but. unfortunately, almost at the beginning of the engagement bcveial ol the eommandeis and the superior cfiicois mulei their oidcis weie killed oi wounded. The lesult was that the unity of the openitions was bioken, and the inostbi il liant efforts, duiing a bloody conflict, ulrich lasted several horns, could not restore it. General Mouravicff having convinced himself of this impossibility, ad lanced the íescrve, and under its piotcction the assaulting columns effected theil ietie.it. The obstinacy with which oin tioops fou*ht is above all pi aise.

There is one peculiar feature in the political career of Sir William Molesworth which does not seem to have attracted its full inceel of j attention. He was one ot the first among { those statesmen of our time who have under- j stood the importance of the press as an ele- ! mont in political nfl'airs. Throughout his i career he has more or less been connected ? with periodical publications-in this respoct j showing his good sense and penetration, that j the general opinions of his party, in their more philosophical acceptation, could only in the ¡ nature of things at first be fully comprehended ¡ by comparatively a few, and that their pro- j pngation could not, therefore, safely be left to the action of the ordinary law of literary supply and demand. It was in pursuance of j this view of the mission of the press that Sir ¡ William Molesworth, whose wealth permitted i him such hazardous indulgences, established ¡ the London Revino, a publication which, j while it lived, was distinguished for talent of a very high order, and which certainly diel its I appointed work. Sir William Molesworth, of course, himself contributetl to its pages, assisted by James Mill, Charles Buller, John Mill, George Grote, and other less known celebrities of the literary world. His line of conduct in Parliament did not hdie his reputation for fearlessness as a Re- former. On every question affecting the rights and liberties of the people, or which involved the propagation or the arrestation of Liberal opinions, be was ever found staunch to his colors and uncompromising in their defence. At last, by the commencement of 1837, he had openly and deliberately committed himself to an advocacy of free-trade, triennial Parlia- ments, the ballot, a very considerable exten- sion of the suffrage, a wholesale system of re- trenchment, and the abolition of the property qualification, required fiom members of Par- liament. Such fearlessness met with its na- tural reward. Notwithstanding his strong claims on Cornwall, the holders of the elec- toral right there were not able to accept his .' extreme opinions :" and at the next general election, that of 1837, he lost his scat, chiefly because be had spoken so strongly in favor of abolition of the Corn-laws. This defeat, how- ever, was the kind of fall from which a man of courage and energy derives now strength. As a Cornish baronet, sittlngin right of family influence, Sir W. Molesworth, in spite of his ac- knowledged talent, was not of so much specific political weight as when, a short time .after- wards, bowns elected for Leeds. He now be- came-like Brougham just before the Reform Bill, and Cobden at the epoch of the abolition of the Corn-laws-the representative of a principle on which a large portion of the nation had set its heart. At the commencement of the Session of' 1887, as we have already said, he began his career as advocate of the rights and interests of the colonists, the Government of the day having, through Lord John Russell, applied coercive measures to the legislation of Lower Canada. Events proved that, as regarded the principle involved, Sir William was right, and tho Ministry wrong. Towards the clo3e of the same year it was, however-in the month of November-that Sir William Moles- worth first stamped himself as a practical reformer. His celebrated speech in denun- ciation of the evils of the then existing syBtem of transportation led to the appointment of a committee, whose labors ultimately re- sulted in the entire abolition of the system of transportation of New South Wales, atitl its alteration in other penal colonies. About ten years later, we may observe, Sir William Molesworth resumed the question, in a speech still more ripe with information and political philosophy, which has laiel the foun- dation lor ti gradual but total change in our whole system of punishment for crime. In this respect Sir William appears moro as the philanthropist than oven as the politician : mid, long after the party questions of thj hour shall have lost their exciting interest, his name will be associated with a noble and a successful effort to reclaim our criminals, and, at the same time, to purge our' laws of their revengeful element. As early as 1888 he had Called the attention of Parlia- ment to the state of our colonial possessions, by moving a vote of censure on Lord GleneU, then Colonial Secretary. In the Parliamentary recess of the year 1840, when M. Thiers and Louis Phillippe threatened us with a war, Sir William Molesworth in no slight degree con- tributed to save both countries from that calamity by calling- a pro-peace meeting at Leeds, which gave the tone to public feeling throughout the kingdom. At the next general election-when, in 1841, Sir Robert Peel ciinu in at the head of the Conservative reaction Sir W. Molesworth was not returned, and during four years he remained out of Parlia- ment. During the interval of his public political labors he collected, edited, and pub- lished the works of Hobbes, at an expense, it is said, of .£0000. It has been stated, also, that he has left behind bim a MS. life of the "philosopher of Malmesbury" very nearly completed. Nor should ive forget to re- cord his well-known, but not publicly avowed, connection with the Westmimter lieview and some other periodical pub- lications. From the very commence- ment of his career, as has already been ob- served, he appreciated the value of the press as a source of political power, and availed himself of the assistance it afforded him in the propagation of the opinions to which he was so sincerely devoted.

If the Allies, ne- we hope and trust, shall prove themselves to be more skilful than he is, and hean him round so effectually as to make lils resistance criminal, by rendering it insane and useless, the ox-acuation of the Crimea may bo cheaply purchased. It wants but a week to the anniversary of the great battle of Inkermann. Before that daj--if the indica- tions of the approaching events which we gather from every side do not prove illusory the world may expect to hear of auother vic- tory, more creditable to our Generals, though not more glorious to our soldiers. The next victory will lie more fruitful in results, and willbo pregnant, notwith future battles, asthat was, but with the great object of all just and generous warfare-PEACH. Already the abettors of the war, who had Îieace in their mouths, but war in their îearts, have given indications of a chango of policy. The German Governments, xvho, not being xvltli us, were against us, arc beginning to turn. They find that the Czar Nicholas xvas a bad man, and that the Czar Alexander is xvorse,-for being unsuccessful. The rats aro leaving the sinking ship ; and the asses of Germany ure lifting th ;ir legs to kick the unhappy lion who is caught in the toils. France and England would at one time have boen glad of German aid ; for, if loyally offered, it xvoiild have prevented the war. Thenceforward the Allies can and will do xvithout the Sox-ereigns of Austria and Prussia, and wish them no worse fate than a satisfactory reckoning with their own sub- jects. A Ve trust their approaching fate and the friendless condition in xvhich they find them- selves will be a warning to such pub- lic men amongst ourselves as have pur- sued in their own little way the same little and mean policy. The Peace Party iu England hax-e been among the principal abettors of the war. They gaxre the late Czar the luckless notion, that such as they were all Englishmen xvere-that .we were a self-sustained nation, xvho neither understood nor cared for Continental polities ; that we, like Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright.hacl uo creed of the duties which nations owe to one another, or that, if we had, the ISnglishnian's idea of a Frenchman in the nineteenth century was the same as it xvas in the eighteenth : and that we taught our children, as our great iuandfathcrs did ' before tis, to '" hate the French," because, as Olix'cr Goldsmith said, "thev were a nation of sla\\-es, and woro wooden shoes." The world will perhaps never know the full extent of the mischief done by well-meaning religionists like Mr. Bright on the one lionel, or by presumptuous and con- ceited philosopherliugs, like scores xve could name, upon the other, in degrading the namo of England by the delibeiate and pertinacious adx'ocacy of a policy of acquiescence in any amount of wrong xvhich a powerful Sovereign might choose to inflict upon his weak aud unprotected neighbors. Happily for the na- tional character, those men have only proved that we were a free, and never that we were an effete, people. Liko the Sovereigns of Prussia and Austria, they fomented war in the name of peace ; and like them-though in an infinitely smaller degree-they will have to pay a penalty, sooner or later, to the public opinion which they hax'c outraged. The world will enjoy Peace- but it will not hax-e to thank its misjudging friends, in England or in Germany, for the inestimable blessing. GENERAL SIMPSON. {From the Illustrated Kens, October 27.) It is stated on authority that the Govern- ment has accepted the resignation of General Simpson, and that his successor has been already appointed. The name of the new commander has not transpired, and xvill not be announced in this country until the telegraph from the Crimea shall notify to the Gox- orninent that the command has been accented ;by bim to whom it has been con- fided. Public opinion has already designated the man : but, as public opinion may hove made a mistake, xvo shall abstain from mentioning names until the official an- nouncement of tho fact. Thus much is already known-that the nexv General in-Chief is already in the Crimea, and has shared tho perils and the glory of the army. In justice to General Simpson-now that he is no longer in the high position for which his own avowal declared, and subsequent events proved, his unfltness-we trust that he xvill not b3 allowed to retire without honor. Though not possessed of the genius, or the youth, for supreme command, ho lins proved himself a gallant soldier, and worked his xvay upwards to his late position xvithout the adventitious aids, of aristocratic connection, minis- terial favor, or court favor. He rose by flow degrees, and in a perfectly legitimate' manner.- His career is-sufficient to prove that merit may work its way in England without having recourse to undue influence to back it: and that the sober, sttad.v,hard-working man-lox-ing his pio fiFsion. and sticking to it through evil as well ns good report-may como to the top, if ho ha fortunato enough to In i sufficiently long Wo should rejoice at any inaik of honor which Hie Goieminent might feel disposed to 1 cbton upon tin mun who held, even tcmpoiunl} such i command md nhetliei the iccO£,m!ton nue in personal 01 in pioftssional piomotion-in his eleva tion to iiceiage 01 to the licld Marshals haton ulong with Loids Combcrmeie Straf foul and HttidinDe-the coutitiy would not bcgni(l0e the honoi 01 think it ill bestowed Tin new Geneial ivhoeici he may be will lune i task of no oiclmii} difficulty to ac coniilish foi he n ill have to heal the wound inflicted upon the bensttne feelings of tho mrav b} the gicatci gloi} which the I lench acquncd m the captuie of Se I istopol hot that oui ¿allant soldiers envy those of Tianco an} aloi} which the} may gain but that they hope when gloi} is to be {.ct then leaelei s will give them a chance of competing foi a shale of it Oui men had not sut h ti chance m the captuie of Sebastopol \ and it mil theiefoio become the duty of the j now Comniauclei to see that the British army 'fehnll baie the opportunity of sluumg to tho fullest extent the haid ii orl. the dangot and consenuentl} the gloi y of the geneious allies ivith ii bom it is then pnvilege and pleasmo to he united AUS IRÍA AND SARDINIA No soom i hn 1 the Neapolitan stoini blown ovei foi a time than a now quand begins ni anothci coinoi of Italy Those fainiliui with Court gossip aie awaio that diplomatic lelitions between the Sardinian aid T iibcaii Gov ei nments have 1 een foi some time bus) ended 1 he cause lb of a pi îvate natuic but the dispute has aheady become simons and may have important icsults Tho histoi} of the affau may be told m « few woids A certain Count Oasati cmi0iatcd iiom I ombaidy m 1848 and l ecume a baulinian subject His son entered the diplomati beivice and was foi about i icai Attache to the Legation at Constantino i le He was thence tiansfencd to Floicnc hut not before the Maiqms Sauli.

PATENT SLIP AT WILLIAMSTOWN. Mr. RIDDELL, according to notice given, «sited the Chief Secretary whether the arrange- ments for leasing á piece of ground at Wil- liamstown for-'the purposes ol' a patent slip ?liax'o been carried out; arid/'if not, what steps aie bein« taken by tlitf Government for secur- ing to Ibis port so desirable a xvoi'k.' The SURVEYOR-GENERAL rose to answer the question. The site1 for a patent slip lind been advertised, and the lease was taken by a company. 'Under the fourth «luuse of the" lease the lessees were obliged to expend in ' the " construction of th works in the ' ensuing'' twelve month-, a hum of £25,000. ? He xvas assured a fexv days since by a person xvhö was chiefly intereste I in the lease, that plant to the value of J£12,000 or£13,001) was already in the colony, and active' steps would at once be taken for the construc- tion of these xvorks. ' ' '" "" IMPORTATION OF LIVE STOCK Mr. WILLS, iii pursuance of notice, moved - Ï hat » seloi-t committee liu «pnointoU to lu<miic into and incertain the be-t mcthouof collecting infoi iii¡itli>:i ¡i, to tliu number und description of live itock jmportcil into Vlitoiu from Now, bouth Wale- an i South Australia: auch loniniîUuo to con^t oí tlu .Attornoj-General, Mr. Tiijlor, Mr. 0'.Shauas->v, Mi Knallt, -Mr. Uruevet, Mr. MpllMóii,and the laov'jr. On making this motion he would state, that lie had boen informed by a member of the legislature that not less'than 1,000.000 sheep -» cio sent lo this Colony annually from Sydnev «lone, not to speak of large herab of cattle. Mr. O'BIUEN èecomled the motion. Mr. TAYLOR moved;1 as an amendment, that the inquiry be refci'i'èd'to the Committee on Agricultural Statistics. . Mr. GRIFFITH supported the original mo- tion. It was very desirable that they should adopt some means to ascertain the consump- tion of live stock in Melbourne"aiid Geelong. This could be got at with very little trouble, find would form-a datum'-from which they t could average the consumption thuuighout the country. It xvas desirable, because, as the land questionxvouldsoon be'iindei-'cousider ation, it would gix-e the'Legislature som idea of the profits of the holders of Crown lands. The amount of xvoöl produced could, of course, easily be ascertained. The quanti- ties of live stin k entering might be obtained from the tollkeepers around 'Melbourne and Geelong, 01 Iroin' tho'large agent'-, selling to the butclieis. . ' ?" '?">? Mr. WILLS could not assent to the amend- ment. The Committee on Agricultural Sta- tistics had nothing to do xvith this subject. Mr. TAYLOR then withdrew his amend- ment, and the original motion,wa-5 put au«! carried. > ¡ i tv . . i.' ..<? . LAND GRANTS 'AS MILITARY . REWARDS.'

" ,' '. - ' He moved this resolution without the'slight- est doubt that the«,House was prepared iu I every xvay to reduc&to; practice its feeling of sympathy with« -the-'British1 army. That sympathy had already been expressed by an address presented1'by'>'the lfduse ; and he hoped that.-'i" although thev wore 10,000 miles disfcant<from the Scene of action, they would remember'that this colony w.is iu fact an integral portion of the 'British em- pire-that its inhabitants hadtllbsarrie blood, the same feelingS! anil the same iuteicsts AS Englishmen, iindthe-sameiiittirest iu-tho war which was progressing in the East, and on which depended the libertó of Europe, the cause of constitutional government, and the position of the British «.empire in the' world. With the British empire they were essentially connected, and though they had a light to independence indocal mattere," they liftd'still duties topcrform-TheBritishcolouis'tsofNorth America uad voluntarily provided subsidies for England, and last session that'House had voted a sum of money for nthe relief of the willows and orphans of 'those who fell in the war. This, however, only embraedd a specific . object-and although this . coiouy was not in a position to render any direct assist- ance in the xvar xvhich was going on, or to give any pecuniary -aid which would bo efficacious, she had still gieat resodices in the unoccupied lands. The colonists were not numerous enough to occupy the whole of the land in their possession, and in his opinion t hey could not refuse from these resotti ces to do something to the assistance of the mother count ry. The question arose-in xvhat way could they carry this into effect: ntul the way he xs-ould suggest xvould be to eneouiage, by rewards of land, meritorious sei vices of mem- bers of the British anny, thus stimulating them to gi cater exertions / while fighting on behalf of their i country. They could only eend a trifling contingent of men to aid Hie English anny, and monty at present thev could not afford, and theie only re- mained the way he had suggc.-tetl. That hi.s proposition xvas a practicable one was shown from the fact that it had been adopted in other colonies, xvhero gratuities of land were »warded to officers for a certain lenuth of ser- vice, under certain régulations* and the value of the land so axvardecU varied fiom £200 to ¿000. This had boen donci in time of pea'ce i and during this , war, he asked, in justice to the British anny, that what had been done for the officers might be done lor the men. He asked the House to sanction this system of land rcmission'for the Biitjsh army gene- rally. The Emperor of Russia, they heard, had gix'en extraordinary rewards to thon- who defended Sebastopol; and was the British army, then, entitled to ,no consideration from tlieir countrymen? Should tbciy withhold the« rewards fiom the British soldier, who, ;i(ir excellence, lind gained , the victory in this gieat struggle, rather, than any genius of the officers? Ho, thought not, and theieibre he asked the House to extend this remission system to the army, foi a special object and for a special time, extend- ing that time for every year of actual warfare, He xvould not fix any paiticular period of service, but reward all services of merit, how ex'er shoit a period the soldier had been in the army. It might be objected to this scheme that the endowment of soldiers with land had in other cases proved a failure ; but that wa-> when the endowments were indiscriminately awarded. Ile proposed, however, that only the best men should be selected for the en- joyment of this high privilege. Ile thought that the introduction of a little of the mili- tary element into this colony by such lucius would be highly advantageous, and th -X, if these men wore piopeily soient ? I, they would confer considerable boiicii'; «nu the colony. It should be remembered that v hile in the mother-country there wore none of tho evils of conscription, there were none of its advantage«» either, and these grants would operate tis a strong stimulus to joiu -the army, and xvould thus render great service to the mother-country. i . i Mr. FAWKNER seconded the motion, lie quite agreed that it xvas desirable to hold out some rewind to those forming the British army, both officer and men. , He did not, liow'ever, tliink it could be done by the abso- lute gift of a quantify 'of, land. He had scon lumdreds of these men who, had had both hand and houses given to thom in Van Die mail's Land, and hardly one out of a hundred piospered from the accommodation they thus received. Many of them sold their pioperty and dissipated the .proceeds in drunkenness in the .course of a few weeks. Such a system might piospcr if they in forced the) Maine Liquor Law, but not othei wise. There xvas, however, much in the resolution of which he, approved, and a plan might be devised to'make it practi- cable. This land could bo sokl or, lot to such of these men, under certain ' conditions, as were willing to cultivate ', or place ?stock upon it. In this way he did not caro if 10,000,000 acres were set aside'; and indeed, he was willing that 10,000,000 should lie thus re- served. They, as Britons thcmselxres, were bound to do something for those xvho, to pro- tect theil country, were enduring all the hard- ships of war in au inhospitable'climate and under great difficulties. He pegged to sup- port the motion. Colonel ANDERSON saul that ho, had been much giatifled at hearing the motion, and rose to support it : but ho differed from tho lion, member xxdio had moved it on one point only: but that point was an , .important one. The British soldier . >, required no stimulus to make,bim do his, duty. It was not the sixpence a-diiy'which gave the Biitish soldier his courage-it .was his love of country. (Hear.) He thought it, xvas the duty of this colony, now enjoying all the privileges of peace, to carry out the motion, not as a re xvard for, but as an acknowledgment of, tho Bei vices of these good and faithful soldiors. He maintained that this motion was quito practicable, notwithstanding the obserx- ations of the lion, member'for Talbot, He bowed to the lion, member in many things, but not in militaiy knowledge, although the lion mem 1 cr pos'scMied a higher rank than ex-en he did. <A lauïb.) This motion could he carried out iinilci- careful regulations; and, amongst others, it should be understood, that it should not bo as a matter of course that those who . had done their duty should have their' tervices acknowledged in this manner. It diould be decided entirely by the soldier's conduct previous to the - time of his discharge, and his physical fitness or unflt ncss to carn his own daily bread. Eveu after thiB grant had been made, if the soldier did not conduct himself as be ought to do, or indulged in intempeiato habits, the grant should be withdrawn. The soldier should re- ceive the lancL conditionally, and should not ' have the option of Belling it, but it should descend from him to his next heirs, and so on for a certain time. He would, moreover, in- troduce a clause into the grant, that if he did not make a proper uso of his land, or bring it into cultivation, he,should forfeit it., He thought that _ this> would be, a very proper acknowledgment by tho colony of the services of the BritiBh army, and lie cordially sup- ported the motion. M)l' II Mr. HUMFFRAY, supported the motion. He believed that the British soldier did not need any stimulus to do his duty, but he cer- tainly deserved some, reward for doing it effectually and bravely, The CHIEF SECRETARY said that it was not his intention to throw any impedi- ment in the way of this motion, but ho would call the attention of the bon. memberito the fact that the time had not yet arrived for Wm to carry out theso views. He quite agreed with the first part of the motion. It'was their duty to.prove their sympathy with the British army, and he was glad, to hear so general an expression of that sympathy. It mußt be remornbered, however, that they were a joung colohy, ¡, many of those present had brothers and sisteis, and even fothers and mothers, at1 homeland so long us those tiei existed a very strong sympathy >,must exist between this 'colony, and England. Those ties, however, would , weaken with time ; and though no doubt a sympathy would always cxiBt, it would not be so powerful as at presont. Whatever ivorc,theso,synipathies,now,howovor, it wns not in tlie power of that House to accedo io the views of 4he bon. member. It would only be in fthe power of' the Legislature which was to follow them, and, he was sorry, therefore, that; they could do no more than express theil' approbation of the motion brought forward by the lion, member. Mr. GRANT said' that it was not desirablo to occupy tiine with a fruitless discussion, and he should therefore move the previous question. H . ., Mr. CAMPBELL said that his motion only went the length "of asking the House to ox picss an opinion, in order that its viows might thereafter be! carried out at as early a period as possible. ' The previous question was then put, and carried. THE ESTIMATES FOR 185G. Dr. GREENES rose,'pursuant to notice, to move- i 1\. That a soloot commlttoo bo appointed to tako into consideration tho estimates for 1850, wlthavloir of equalising halarlos mid economising expenditure for tlio purposes of government. < > 2\. That such commlttco conslbt of tlio Chief Secre- tary, tho Treasurer, ,Mr. Nloliolson,, Mr. Mlllor,iMr. 'Strachan, Mr! ltykç, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. O'shanassy, Sir. M'.Çulloch, and tlio mover. -He might state at'tjkê outset that ho did not iiring the motion forward as a. party measuro, for he thought that, considering tlio political circumstances of the country, ,if ever thora i were a time when' such a motion should bs unanimously agreed to at was the present. .It ' was admitted 'on alb;hands, that tlio country was in a transition state with regard to its financial arrangements. The estimates that would do for 1851 would not do for 1852 or 1853, tho change which had taken place in f hose years was great andimarked. They were, however, now settling down, and the time had arrivée! when the Council, should go fairly to work nnd endeavor ,to put the expenditure of the country upon' a satisfactory basis. Every head of department would admit that there existed in his own, and between his own and other departments, various discrepancies as to salaries, and this caused great dissatisfac- tion and jealousyr." Now, when the Council went, as usual, into,committee of the wholo io consider the estimates, every member, no doubt, desired to], economise, but the con- sequence of treating the estimates bit by bit and in detail ivas, íhat results quite opposite to the intention of the House were attained. Tor instance, lost' session there was a unani- mous desire to economise, hut from tho way in which they went to work, bit by bit, they actually voted £26,000 or £20,001) moro in tho way of salaries than was originally in- troduced into the estimates. That was, however, hy no means a novel ocourronce. l'or instance, there was a great deal of dis- cussion as to what would be a proper salary to fix for the heads of tho departments, and, after a few divisions, the sum of £1200 was fixed. Tho result bad hoon that tho Deputy Registrar-General received £2110, and th.i Anny Surgeon £1780. It was only fair to observo, however, with regard to these two officers, that a portion of their receipts was Îaill by the mother country; but had tho louse been aware of the results of its owa X'otc, it would never have established this .enormous discrepancy. The sum of £1149 only Nwas voted to the Deputy Registrar, independent of his allowance. There weie various other instances, with which, however, he would not weary tho House. For instance, there was a great dis- crepancy between the salaries of persons filling analogous situations in different do- pai Iments,-these differences not being regu- lated apparently by the sendees rendered to the Government. It,was only right and just, mid would bo the means of pievcuting jealousies that these salaries should lu equalised. There were some other inequalities hy the press!-that their different branches had in those estimates, which he could not avoid pointing out ; indeed, he could not help suspecting that the imputation thrown out been drawn up by heads of departments, had never been submitted to any central authority, but had stood as the estimates just as they weie, and were so placed in the printer's hands, had somo foundation in fact. For instance, in the office of tim Registrar-General, fuel and water amounted to £6 4s. per head per annum, while in the Customs the cost was only £2 per hoad per annum. It would seem to bim that more fuel and light would be required in the Cuhtoms department than in the Rcgistrar Gcncral's office. What would the House say, however, when they learned that the cost ¿f fuel and water per head in the Chief Secre- tary's office was £18 per annum? These BUIM wore apparently not very large, but the dis- crepancies required consideration. Another dificrepancy was, that in the Treasurer's de- partment it was proposed to give those who weie mere bookkeepers larger salaries than iho gentlemen in the gold department who were responsible for handling the gold. The sum of £10,000 was put down for the detective police force, without the specification of a single item. It was a great evil that in this colony the system of îating clerks was, not adopted. lfowcvor long a clerk might remain in the service of the Government, he got no increaso of pay except by being placed iii a different situation, nnd it would be admitted that an clliciont clerk might not be competent to highor duties, and thtit it was therefore haid to do pilve him of increased pay for lengthoncd soi vice. The adoption of the system of luting would remedy this evil, und put a stop lo tlie mode of voting salaries from personal considerations, which he regretted to say ha 1 attained to some extent in tho House, Thj money should in no case bo voted to the in- dividual but to tho ollice he held. Now, comparing the expenditure of go- vernment of Victoria with that of the adjoining colony of Neiv South Wales, he found that in the latter place thototaloxpendituiefor the administra- tion of justice, including the amount reserved tinder the schedule in the New Constitution, was £38.800, but iii Victoria, exclusivo of tho sum reserved, it was £102,490, and the llouio should remember that the populations of tlicoc two places was very nearly equal, anti for the purposes of debate might be iissumjil to be equal. The' penal establishments of "Victoria cost her £12G,2GC a year, while thoio or New South Wales cost only £34,5UJ. Tlia military and naval'expendituic of Now South Wales was only £21,001), while the sumo ttoni in Victoria was £147,800. The medical de- partment in New South Wales cost £113,417, in Victoria £24,200. These were enormous discrepancies when1 the, population of tho two places was nearly equal, ¡mel the necesn ricsof life nearly the same in price. In Making this motion he had ho Idea of rofe rring the de- cision of the estimates to the commitlcj, but merely the consideration of thom. Tits committee would investigate the discrepan- cies to which he had alluded in a coniprohen eivo manner, and their report would enablo the House to deal with the, estimates in a far better mode than the ordinary one of taking them in detail. Mr. MILLER seconded the motion. The CHIEF SECRETARY said that it would be a matter of Indifference, so far as ho was concerned, whether the , House adoptod tho course indicated by the,bon. member instead of adhering ;to that usually adopte I with regard to the 'dsti'mates., With regard to one of the objects of the hon. member, tint of equalising salaries, he could only Boy that ho would be glad, to rgoelvu any assistance in bringing ¡»bout s> desirable an object. The Governmiut hail not been insensible to the necessity of S'.'LP'1"?. ou.t those views, but thcic were croît difficulties in the xvay. it xvas difficult to xM'ighthe claims of the different officers in the service of the Government. Every man viewed his own position favorublv, and miny considered that-their servicis did not me -t xiiththo reward xvhich they were entitled to. He did not xvish to cast any reflection upon any gentleman in the public service-he ba lievcd that they all did the ¡r best, and carne I tin« salaries they received. Gentlemen, how ix er, were not always satisfied with their sa- laries, and it was a difficult matter lo rn^et all these objections, so that he should fe 1 much indebted to the bon. member for his as ! «stance m dischaiging a difficult task. With regard to economising the expenditure of the country, it xvas a common object on both wiles of tho"Hoi|se, and if the expenditure «mid bereduced in anyway ho should feel very glnd. He did not think that he could be charged xvith, extravagant e during the laät session, ne xvas chhiged with the opposite quality during'the-recess; but he was ready to go even further if it were required for the public service.'' He xvould leave the motion to be decided by the House. ' Mï. FAWKNER would x'ote in favor of . this committee of retrenchment ; but he could , have wished ? that 'the House had been in ionncd how this retrenchment was to bo bigun. If the gentlemen named discharged the duties they undertook to do, a groat ser- vice xvould be dobo both to the Govcrnmont and to tho country.' ne should, however, wlitelrthis committee, and see if they ful- filled the1 pi omises they made, and really effected any good in reducing the expendi- ture of the country. Mr: HORNE'moved the suspension of standing order No. 34, in oidor to increase the number ol the committee. The number named. 10, was not, in his opinion, sufficient to represent the different districts, and he in- tended to move that it be increased to 14. Mr. HUMPER AY seconded the motion. Mr. GRIFFITH objected to appointing so numerous a committee, that it might dictate to the House. This xvas an evil which they noxv felt in the construction of the New Con- stitution Act. ' Mr. HORNE persisted in his amendment, and the House divided, when there nppoarod Ayes ,. 29 Noes .r ... 10 Tho amendment xvas tbeiefore cat ried Dr. GREEYES said that he had not desired a large committee, and he thought that oven ten xverc too many. , Rather than the com \- mitteo should be increased as prdposod ho xvould xvithdraw his motion. The motion was accordingly withdiawn THE BALLOT.'' Mr. CAMPBELL rose to move- ' ' ' That it is the opinion of this Ilouso that, under ex- isting circumstances, tho public interests of tho colony leiiuiro that'thd question of the ballot Should not ba introduced into the ]iroscnt Electoral Bill, but should be postponed mitil the,mooting-,of the now Le/risU tine. , , i ? , The SPEAKER said, that on the 19th of December the House had arrived at the fol- lowing resolution :-" In the opinion of this House any nexv electoral act should provide for the electors recording their votes by.secret ballot." 4j The lion, member was, therefore clearly ¡out of di'der in introducing this motion. Mr. CAMPBELL said that he had risen for the purpose of,withdrawing his motion. The motion was,accoidingly xvithdrawa. POLICE COURT BUSINESS Mr. FELLOWS moved- ' That ali address ho presented to his Excellency the , OiHcor Adinmibtoring the Government, pnulnir tint his XWcelloney will bo pleased to cause to ho mid upon the itnlilo of tills Council a 'return of tho num- ber c r vases dlsposod of in 1865 in ovory Court of Pott) Sonloiy. iu «|iieh tlioie is a stipendiary or police niaitfslrate. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL had no ob- jection to these returns being furnished. Mr. SNODGRASS moved that the return should include the number of hours of attend- ance of each magistrate, and the district iu which each court was situated. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that it would be impossible to obtain au accurate return of the bom's of attendance. Mr. SNODGRASS withdrew that portion of his amendment, but retained tho latter. The motion, as amended, was agreed to. INFLUX OF CRIMINALS. The CHIEF SECRETARY moved for leave " to bring in a bill to continue the act l8 Viet., No. 3, to Prevent the Influx of Criminals into Victoria." Leave was givon, and the bill was brought in, read a first time.' and ordered to be printed and read a second time on Tuesday next. ASSESSMENT ON STOCK. The CHIEF SECRETARY moved "for leave to bring in a bill to authorise, for a limited peiiod, an Assessment on Stock." Leave xvas given, the bill xvas brought in, read a first time, and ordered to be printed'. The second reading xvas fixed for Tuesday next. BEECHWORTH POST-OFETCE. Mr. CAMERON moved That mi addiess ho presented to lils Excellency the Officer AdminintoringthoGovernment, prayiiiirtliatliU, Excellency will ho pleased to causo to ho laid on tlu table of tills Council copies of ali correspondence between the 1'ostinaster-Goncral and tho lato Post jnnstor ut Hecchworth, relativo to tho establishing of branch or district post-oflioes in the Ovens district and of any suggestions accompanying such corre- spondence. These suggestions,recommended the cstab. lishment of ceitain branch post- offices whick xvould have entailed, x'cry little, if any, ex- pense to the countiy, and yet no attention had been paid to them by the Government. The CHIEF SECRETARY had no objec- tion to the production of the documents. He might say that a petition had been presented in 185-1 from the inhabitants of Beechworth and the Buckland, two places very far distaut from each other, in favor of the establish- ment of certain branch post-offices; but as there had.been no population located to any extent between these two extrem J points, the Government had not thought it nccespary to accede to the prayer of tho petition. There were now, however, other places between these two spote, at which poisons weie located in considerable numbeib, aud as lhere xvas now a sum of ¡C2800 on the Eslimutes lo be devoted to country post-offices, he would undertake tj say that the Ovens district should not bj overlooked. Mr. CAMERON observed that his motion made no reference to the petition alluded to. The motion was put, and passed. GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE. Mr. O'BRIEN moved- , That an address ho presented to his Excellency the Oillcor Administering tlie Government, praying tint his Excellency will cause to ho luid heforo the Council a return, signed by the head of each department, show- ing tlie amount actually expended or incurred hv such dopartmoiitduringtho jour 1855, distinguishing salaries from contingencies, and stating upon nhoso requisi- tion the expense was incurred, mid whether the amount spent Is in oiccss or otherwise- of tlio amoa it voted liy tills Council for tlie service of the icar 18D j, together with any explanatory remarks that have boon made hy the henil of each depai tment. He considered, that it must bo manifest to members that such a lctuin could not be other than most useful : and he, therefore, thought it unnecessary to detain the House by going into any,, lengthy explanation. The CHIEF, SECRETARY rose to state that he had already taken steps for procuring for his own use the infoimation required by the bon. member, in order that he might bee whether any, and what, saving or ox cess had occurred in the expenditure of the different departments. He had not yet re- ceived all the information, but anticipated that it would be before hint very shortly, when he should be lumpy to communicate it to the House. -. , The motion was put, and carried. JAMES LONNIE. ' Mr. CAMERON, without remark, moved That tlio petition »f James Lonnio and otlisr | »mien, of the Ovens district, presented hy him, ho icforrcd tu tho soloet committee now sitting on the powers til'lho Local Coutts. The motion was put, anti carried. VICTORIA "INSURANCE COMPANY. Mr. MILLER moved That the hill to enable tile Victoria Firo and Marine Insurance Conipaui lo sue and he sued, bo now road a second time. ' The lion, member explained that the bill merely enabled< the company to sue and be sued in the name of their chairman for the time being, and would thus be a convenience to the publie as well as to the company ; it further allowed the company to hold pro- perty. t. Mr. FAWKNER- opposed the second lead- ing, because thoibill had been introduced by an lion-, member who was the chairman and hngest shareholder in the company, holdln1,', . ¡ib lie had been informed, nearly one half the share's in the company. He also alluded to the proceedings', in select committee, which he considered to.htivc been most improperly conducted. ? He found also, on looking through the bill, that everything was made its hard OÍ- possible against any person pro- ceeding against the company, and as favorable as possible to the company in its proceedings I against others; and this requited lookingnfter. Again, he htiw that no provision was made for securing to tim public payment from the ? company of any amounts which the company might have pledged themselves to pay. He I understood that the company inserted in their policies a clause by which thoy ra stticlcd their liabilities to paitics insurinj in such a way that should the companysuffor greater losfcs than they anticipated thjy could pay insurers only just what they liked. He should move that the bill be renda second time that (loy six months; whilst, if tho second rea'liiig were passed, he would try to make the bill ns safe for the public as, it now was for the company. The amendment not being seconded, fell to the ground. , The motion for the second reading was put and caí ried; the, bill was read a second time, and committed. ' Mr. MILLER took that opportunity of answering some of the remarks made by the lion.member fqr,TaIbot, though the animus of those remarks had been so apparent that it was Fcnrcc worth his while to do so. At the samo time, however, ¡he was bound to answer them, ns the company consisted of a great number of shareholders, arid transacted a very largo amount of business, whilst the remarks of the bon. member would have the effect of maliciously hijuring the property of the shareholders^ As to his being the holder of lialf,the shaics .of, the company, he did not lenow that the company^ ivoulel be very mate- rially, injured ,ev,en if he were so, but lie would inform the bon. member that lie bad been, misinformed in that respect. Next be would' state that the reason for foicing on tlic,T^i|l in.committec was because, it had been understood that the session would be only a very short one, and tho.company were anxious to get the bill passeel before, the House was, prorogued ; and this was thought i the least objectionable because the bill contained, , nothing at which' any lion, member-except, only ,the bon, mem- ber foi Talbot-could cavil. Coming to the iuocecdings in committee, nothing had icen done there more than was necessary, nnd nothing had been concealed, for_ever}r thing appeared on the, minutes recorded in that House; and'be would further state that be had been the only shareholder in the com- pany who had been appointed to sit on tho commiittee. . \ , The House resunjed, the Chairman reported progress, and obtained lcavo to sit again on 'Tuesday next. , TTIE BALLAARAT RIOTS. Mr. LALOR moved That an adiirdss bo presented to his Excellency tho Ollieor Administering tho Government, praying that his Excellency will bo pleased to causo to ho laid upon tlio table of tlip House a copy of tlio roport of tlio commission appointed by his late Excellency to in f.tiho intor certain claims for compensation mndo by persons at Ballaarat,'for losses sustained by tho do ttniction of their property on tho 3rd Decombor, 3BG4, and also a copy of all tho other documonts öon Jioctcd thorowltl). Bon. members wished to draw a veil over the occurrences qf that melancholy day, but be- fore they did so thoy ought first to take stops io compensate those nibo had sufforod low in consequence of that very unwarrantable nnd unjustifiable proceeding." i .The CHIEF SECRETARY had yesterday i laid on the table ¡thp rcpott of tho commis- sion appointed to inquire into the Ballaarat disturbances, which contained are view of all tho claims presented, with an account of whe ? thor they 'ivcre rejected or not, and the roa .Bon for the'rpjqotion or otherwise. Ile had not laid all the papers connected with those clniins on the table, because they were very voluminous, and unless the honorable mem- ber found them absolutely necessary for nny steps he might wish to tako, it would only.be useless labor to copy thom. If tho honorable member would look over the report, ho'would doubtless find nil the infor- mation ho required ; if ho did not, he had only to state what documents be wanted and they should bo furnished. I Mr. LALOR under those circumstances would withdraw his motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.'' Mr. ROBERTSON. The SURVEYOR-GENERAL laid on the table copies of the correspondence relative to Mr. Bobeitson's claim to land at Colac, moved for yesterday (Thursday) by Mr. Fel- lows. . Mr. FELLOWS asked leave to suspend the standing orders, to enable bim to move tlio appointment of a select committee, to consist of Dr. Grcovcs^Mr. Taylor, Mr. A'Beckctt, Mr. Nicholson, Mr. Henty, Mr. Ross, and the mover, to inquire into Mr. Robeitson's case. Mr. SNODGRASS wished to know what the question waa that the committee would have to inquire into. Tho House was totally without information on the subject. Mr.FELLOWS : It has lcferenco lo some land at Colac, which had been withdrawn fi oin sale for a month by the Govornmont, io the grca't injury of Mr. Robeitson. Mr. FAWKNER : Oh, a pre-emptive right. Leave was given to suspend the standing 01 tiers ; and the motion for the appointment of a committee was put, and negatived with illit a iliviKinli '. THE BLUE BOOK. The CHIEF SECRETARY laid on the table of the House the Blue Book for 1854. BILLS OF EXCHANGE BILL. The Houso xvent into committee on this bill, xvhich was gone through xvith some «Relations. lho bill was reported xvith amendments to J be House, and the adoption of the report Minde an order of the clay for that day week. ROADS AND BRIDGES. The House xvent into committee on Mr. O'Brien's adjourned motion, 11ml tho Council resolve itself into a committee of the xihulofor the purpose of adopting an address to his IiMCllency the Governor, provint' tlmt tho (.uni of ¡C2G0,000 from'tho proposed vote for louds and bridaos for tho year 1850 bo placed at tho dispos.il of tho Con- ti al Hoad Board, to bo ox-ponded during tho nox.t four months on tho roads and bridgos of the colony. 'Ibis was the season of the year at which pub- lic xvorks could be most cheaply and adi'unta geously executed ; and, as the Acting Gover- nor had no poxver to expend money xvithout a vote of that House, and as it xvould be some lime before the estimates could be passai thiough the House, he had considered it bet tirthat the com so pointed out in his resolu- tion should bo followed, rather than toxvaitsix months longer, xvhen shoit days and bael wea- ther would impede xvork and lender it diffi- cult to execute. By agreeing to this resolu- tion, the main lines of road would receive 1» ojier attention before the bad season sot ia. The CHIEF SECRETARY acceded to the motion, because it xvas desirable that the ?work should bo proceeded with at once. Thora xvas, however, ono point to xvhich he xvould call the attention of the House. By passing this resolution they would be viitually giving their approval to the scheme of expenditure for roads contained in the estimates. , Mr. O'SHANASSY, seeing so thin a House, and that members had evidently boen taken by surprise, not expecting this lesolulioa to come on, would move that the Chairman ro poit piogress and ask leave to sit again that day fortnight. The COMMISSIONER of PUBLIO WORKS did not think that tho resolution should be postponed to so late a date as that named, as every xveek now lost xvould prove most important, ami preparations had already been made in anticipation of the x'ote of the House for commencing at once works to the extent of £200,000, that amount having been considered sufficient. If it wove put over for a xveek members could be in attendance. Mr. O'SHANASSY: By agreeing to this motion bon. members xvould virtually bo pledging themselves to the finarfcial policy of the Government, and that he, for one, was not m-epaicd to do in the absence of all infor- mation. If ithe Government would plcdco themselves to biiug forward their financial statement within' the xveek, ho xvould not object to the shorter term. This xvas not i.t all likely,« and therefore ho had named a foitnight as " the shortest timo in xibich the i statoment could bo made. Ho would only add that the country xvas most nnxious to know the exact state of tho public finances at thp present time, and lho prospect for the ensuing year ¡-neither that House nor the country being in the least axvare of xvhat our financial position is. The COMMISSIONER of PUBLIO WORKS thought thati the xroto xvould morely sanc- tion the general principle of expenditure oa the roads, and not the absolute detail. Mr. O'BRIEN could not understand tho giounds on xvhich the motion wa3 opposed, as the sum mentioned to bo expended did not amount to much more than half the amount placed on the estimates for the purpose, and the remaining half might be used to udjust tile claims of different districts, in accordance xvith the wishes of the House. A delay of a ioitniglit xvould do a x-ery great injury, since the money could not be laid out so well bei cafter as noxv. Mr. O'SHANASSY consented lo adopt the shoi ter term. , The House resumed; the Chairman re rortcd progress, and leax'e xvas given to sit again on that day xveek. POSTPONEMENTS. The following orders of the day were post- poned to Wednesday next : elections licgulatiou Bill-To bo further consi- dered in committee. Victoria Electoral Bill-To bo fiirthpr consldorod in committee. The House then rose,
