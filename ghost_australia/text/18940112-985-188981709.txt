Premature Burial. A Singular Case which Occurred in Paris. Axotheb. case of premature burial worthy i of being analysed in the relastic manner of Zola has occurred in France. An el derly woman who lived at an Old World place called St. Ouen La Kouerie recently fell ill, and, as her friends thought, died. The funeral took place, and as the grave digger was preparing to lower the coffin into the earth he heard moans issuing from inside the lugubrious four boards in closing the presumed corpse. Then fol lowed a scene which was an exact counter part of what occurred about twelve months ago in another rural part of France. The grave digger, half frightened of the pro bable ghost which his imagination conjured up and partly awed by the requirements enacted by the law in circumstances such as those in which he found himself placed, left the coffin in the cave of the mourners and went off with his sombre story to M. le Maire. That rural diguitary, having donned his scarf of office and summoned the village doctor, proceeded to the local " God's acre." The coffin was opened, and it was discovered that the woman had just died from fright, having awakened from a trance to find herself hemmed in between the terrible deal planks. When horrible scenes like this are repeated it is time for the authorities and public at large to take into consideration the invention of the ingenious undertaker who has adopted as motto, " No more premature burials." This practical person offers to supply to all cases of doubtful death an apparatus by means of which those who may have the misfortune to be buried alive may not only inhale fresh air on their awakening, but also communicate by signal with the world which has left them for dead.
