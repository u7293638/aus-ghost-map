MB3GK&LANI;&US; BHZPPO7CK The Booth* Ac?X?sxujr arrived pa Thursday rooming, BjaVing landed tin *"?"!? and <pvim> of tile passengers, including the Melbourne team of football players, at Glenelg, she pro ceeded to Port Adelaide. The South Australian left Melbourne in company with tbe B.K& China on the aftemosn of August 7. pasted WHliamstown at 4 p hl, and cleared the Heads at 6, -where the China was lost light of. The stesmer rounded Gape Otway at 11, paawd Cape Northumberland at 10JO ajn. on the Bth, Was off Cape Jervis at 5 ajn. on Thursday morning, arriving at Glenelg at 850. Captain Lockyer statas that a strong bead wind, with high sea, prevailed throughout the passage. The fog of Thursday morning was the cause of some perplexity in tbe roadstead, strongly reminding one of yh?*?wn?tin^?impp?q?jn^h? old ttrantsy. The boarding-boat, having eom pletea a visit to the Invercanld, end being about 10 miles south-west of tbe stations, shored off and shaped a course oa shore. The wind from the northward brought down a dense vapor which so completely enveloped the roads that in a minutes sail the lavercanld had vanished. The boat had at first a strong hrease, but it died away as she neared the shore. The sound of a steamer's whirile then attract attention,.and subsequently another, and then a thud, all. being1 invisible and the boat becalmed, ~ and consequently powerless to clear the way or put the officer on board. A second officer from .the station had proceeded in the launch, and steamed to the Sooth AnsWalian. The passage of the bar ww not attempted bribe Booth Australian until the ban lifted. The feeltana and InvercauLT kept in oGbig, and were invisible till midday. The Bhltaka. has not changed her rig, and is quite as smart looking as ever she was, notwithstanding "her passage has been very much lengthened through a collision in tike Channel. She left London on April 1, a westerly wind compelling her to beat dawn till to the southward of the Eddystoaa, where she felHoul of a barque, knocking away her fore and main masts, and carrying.away her own jibboom, bowsprit, and head jgear. The figure nekd and cutwater were also ?arried away, end it waafound that tbe Beltanahadsustalnedauch damage, that she was phlJjged to putinto Ply mouth for repairs. A portion of tbe cargo was 'discharged, and litter, a thorough refit she made sail again onJt?l6. She bad Cm weather after clearing tin land; indeed the whole distance to the line Was very. fine. She erased the equator on June 15, in 27? IS", and then bad a breesa from tbe southward, which gave place to trades, but they proved far from the 'eouthward also, and thus the Teasel was driven well over to the coast of America. After pass ing tbe Cape, in 43?, strong winds prevailed during the whole distance from St. Paul's to Cape Leuwin, but on working up for Cape Borda it came ahead, and continued so until sighting the light on the sth. The' Beltaaa having a lot of gunpowder as part of her cargo will be detained at the North Arm for its dis charge. The GsstaonifD brig was towed out on Thursday and made sail, bat the wind being very light the made little progress. Tbelwn?amjtsboweafrom the station at early dawn on Thursday, and was shortly -after boarded. Captain PhflUpt ia still to tbe fore, and of his voyage reports leaving London at 4 am. Ob May 18 with a couple of tags ia atten dance, and was taken to tin powder ground at Gravesead, where she reoatyed on board 26 tons of explosives. Next day tin services of one tug were dispensed with, as she was towed past Deal and there discharged pilot, but the wind bemg steong from the westward tbe master elected to tow as far as Dungeness, where the steamer was east off and all sail made on the ship. During tbe night the wind hauled to tbenorthward. Atnoon on the 20th discharged tbe Channel pilot off tiie Start, whence final departure was taken with she wind light at north-east, eontinuia* so till tin 28th Hay, during which time tin 'vessel averaged about 130 .miles* day^ After timt tbe wind shifted to WJS.W.aad&W;, but continued very light till sighting tin Isle of Pafana on June 4. The north-east trades were vexstiously light, and inconsequence tin prospect of a rapid passage was entirely dispelled. ?On June 17 a brisk breeee sprung up which took tite vessel through the variables and across the line in 29? wart. Here 4he ancient custom of making a sham eoort with (be mnmmeij suited to suchan occa sion WM observed, and some of the youngster* were properly initiated aa free men of tbe sea. On June SJHbtin trades were lost, after blow ing so briskly for a. time that tbe vessel was dragging a press of ?a3 with but whole topsails ' set, injOlder to claw off tin land. OaJuly4tb frighten and passed to leeward of Tristan d'Acnsha, but so dose that objects on shore were distinctly visible. No boat appearing the vessel kept on ber-track, and on July 7th crossed the prime meridian, having north-east wind and smooth sea, which tendered urogtew both speedy and pleasant. On the 10tb overhauled and pasted the ship Marring, bound to Mel bourne, aB wdL Both vessels bad taken in powder at tbe same time, but (be Maednff had made a reach ahead by takingshe passage inside tin Gape deVeca Islands. Oni July 11th was on tbe meridian <*f the Gape, ia 4f?? south, but from then until the 23cd extremely slow progress was made, and daring eight darn the vessel made but 840 miles. This was somewhat astonishing considering tite season of tile year. When tbe weather changed, however, mad a breeze as* in. the vessel made a day or #w? of good work, and oo July 27 was off St. PanTs. OaAiftpst 3, m 40? south, passed Cape leeway but hafi very light winds 4heaMto-6ape Borda, which was passed ontiie Bth, sad on the mora ing of-the 9th was boarded at the Semadhom; thence she was towed to the Hbrtb Ann; tor discharge of powderi She will moor in harbor to-day.

The steamer South AvsTsaxuir was boarded by the steam launch Fairy at a quarter to 9 o'clock this monttDg. The mails and some of the passengers went to town by an early train. There was ? heavy sea and a thick fog, so that one could not see tbe length of tbe jetty. The SotJTS AvsiSAUAir had scarcely dis charged her passengers to tbe deck of the Fairy, and tite parting cheers of the football team been answered by tbe vessel's steam whistle, when land and ocean were alike enveloped in a fog, which for density and duration has not often been equaled at Glenelg. A chilly north easterly wind drove down the bank of vapor before U like a wall, completely enveloping the Melbourne steamer. The sound of her fog signals alone indicated her wfaereabonts as she headed away over the fishing grounds to make an offing on her course to the Semaphore. There were no boats away in search of the finny tribe along, tbe track she held, as few of tin fishermen had thought it worth while to start when the marks ashore, which would have guided them to their destination, wore so thoroughly obscured, but the thoughtfulness of Captain. Lockyer was none tbe Jess marked, in giving such time by notice of bis approach. During jne entire morning tha jetty was ob scured, she boats close inshore looming like ghoste through the mist, and it was not until past 1 pjn. that tite veil was withdrawn as quickly as it fell, disclosing the steamer Flinders closejbo Glenelg. She bad come down quite unpereei ved, to place some **tff" pas sengers ob board tin bulk, there to await the arrival of tin China; and her mission aesom plishsd,shereturn?dtoti?e Pott. The rest of the afternoon and evening ????r"Mtti perfectly fine; but long after the Bay<ejoioed in bright sunshine tin bank could be seen drifting away to the southwtaduntil it disappeared altogether intbehorisw. Th*BJMs,C*nMi bad rattier a rough passage from |neibou?Le,wfajc&portshe; lefton Tuesday, August Xat fcSO pjn, arriving ?t Glewdg at 9.30 p jn. on the 9th. Until atie naared Cape Willoughby she had moderate weather.but tin wind gradually increased, and soon blew a gale from theN.W., with a heavy sea, the vesselgoing almost bows under at times. A dense fog was then SaUen in with, which obscured the laud. She passeiCape Jervisat 4.15, and her signal was answered by tin station. The Fairy had rather ratiter a long cruise to reach her, as she came to anchor fully a mile and a half outside the hulk. The mail bags wereput on board, and tite?leanor went 'alongside with cargo. There was little wind and less sea. The China brought only two passengers for Glenelg. Among her passengers are 22 Affghanw, who had oome round in the Flinders from Port Augusta, having been on the HoB.iT. Eldert Beltana Station. They are bound for India. The China left early this mocning. PUBXIO MH*M*S*?* yrjwy?/MfrTi b?nwo?owuK BBnm. Arrived- AugU?t 8. Lusitania, steamer, Lon don; Prince Victor, barque, Kewcastie; Gar nock, ship, Glasgow. 9.
