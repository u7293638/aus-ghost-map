Wise Saws ancl Modern Instances. "Two members of the Tsung-Lii-Yanion (the Chi nose Imperial Council) who differed from the Anti-foreign majority, have been sawn in two."-Doily Cahlc. I don't agree with Mr. Smith, said Mr. -Tones, M.P. His views on various sorts of things distasteful are to me, I move, and hope that members will accept my view. That Mr. Smith and all his be quietly sawn in two. The Speaker put the motion and the House lielcl brief debate For members wished to catch their trains, the hour was getting late, .Tones whipped up a majority, 'tis true 'twas only one But quite enough to show poor Smith that he'd be quickly done. They sawed poor Smith in two, and also all his friends. These executions'don't take long, the saws have double ends. And Jones and his majority kept solid for a week "When Robinson got ropeable, quite tired of being meek. Jones was orating on the theme of Voting Straight by Post. And Brown, who had been drinking, swore he saw his friend Smith's ghost, And Jones who felt insulted, moved that Brown be sawn in two. But Jones's old majority took quite another view So Jones was left, he had a bare minority of one. The sawyers came and seizod him, and Jones went into fits When Members solemnly resolved that he be sawn to bits. It is obvious from this story, which undoubtedly is true That stringent measures don't work out somehow as they should do, To saw opponents into halves no doubt's a pretty game The mischief that surrounds it is that two can play the same.
