A HUGE LAMMERVANGER. . ? 0 ? A huge Lammervanger (lambcatch er), a Cape eagle, measuring 6ft. Oin, from wing tip to wing tip, was brought to our office yesterday morning (says the Cape 'Journal' of August 11). The brute, which had most powerful limbs and beak, 'possessed daws quite ljin. in length, and of great tearing power This hugo bird has t'ov the past sis weeks been living on a. farm near Gra ham's Town, and has been giving the sheep-farmer a lively time of it. Dur ing the six weeks the bird has actually destroyed 50 lambs, some of .which were carried off in the cruel olaws, and others just left dead and lacerated in the veld. Ho was. extremely watchful, never allow ing anyone to get near him, and hover ing overhead till the coast was clear, and then descending to do his. deadly work. For the past three weeks a Hot tentot has been told off to do nothing else but hunt the lammervanger, but' never had a chance till Thursday last, when he and his dog came ou the bird seated on a fencing pole, in a wild part of tho farnii The Hottentot kept out of sierht. and the bird seeing only the doe1, showed a disposition to fight, extendiug its huge wings and uttering hoarse cries of rage. It was so inuoh occupied that the Hottentot was able to creep near enough on his hands and knees to lodge a charge of buck-shot in its breast, and it oame to the earth. It was not, how ever, yet dead, and erecting itself fought the mnn and the dog, fixing its claws in to them, till beaten on the head with a stone, it gave up the ghost, Oui1 friend the farmer is highly re joiced at his riddance from so costly a guest.
