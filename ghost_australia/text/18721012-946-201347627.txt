' ? ' ,. Thomson witnessed the action with a. silent sneoiy but Ringer, who was near est of the two, caught his arm- with ,a force which compelled him to pause; ' , 'Hallo ! what's all this about ? 'he Raid, ' Cutting an old friend like a dogi Isn't George Ringer, good enough to speak to, I should like' to know ?'' ' 'Of course he ? ,';isnft;' remarked Thompson. '.

' : ;Tho taunt brought Careley's blood to his cheek. ?' If I was sentenced ? for a crime,' ho said, with a quivering lip, though his voice was calm and ' distinct, ' I was at least innocent of committing it.' ? - .:. . ?, j, ... . .', , ? / ' :' 'Of , course,' , returned Thompson, with a coarse laugh, ' we ,were all a set of the worst used coves on the. face of the. earth. You don't suppose J did what they nabbed me for, do yon,? Only my jury were a; set of. fools, and the witnesses all perjured rascals, just- like yours.1' . ; . . ', I speak only, of myself,' replied Care]y, firmly. , ' I cannot recall,! the past, but. I; will never hear my sentence alluded to without declaring its illegality and Ringer knows the truth of what I soy, if you do not.' ? ,. ' Yes, yes,'1 said the party appealed to, and his change of manner showed that his recollection of the fact had softened down his 'anger. ' You ought not to be here Harry, I know that; I told them soat the trial, you know ; but they would' not believe me; and I could't do more.' ' You might have done much more,' said Carely, in a tone of reproach, and endeavouring to free his arm as he spoke; ' you might have named, an accomplic and saved an innocent man.'? ; ? .: ' Split on my pal !'' cried Ringer, ' no, no, ; I am bad enough, but I am not come to that, even now. But per haps I .could help .you just as well another . way. You will like to cut away from this sink of a place if there was a chance, : wouldn't- you ??' ? ' If anything occurred to establish my innocence,' said Carely, ' I should be glad of it, of;, course ; though,' he added, with a: sigh, as he thought of the loss of, Annie, 'it could now never make me what I was.' ? - . .' But leaving out all that stuff,;1 pur sued Ringer, ' isn't this a ? blessed hole .to be in?., I know I find it so. They haven't beemcontent with sending me out here, but .they've been tight enough upon me ever since. If I should ever ?get any of them; under my thumb, my ?love to.them, that's all. And because, they, can't get any .cant and palaver out of. .me; as they do out of some of us, they begin to talk about a chain- gang ; ; and one of 'em asked mo the other day how I should liko a taste of Norfolk,, Island.; I don't mean to stand it any , longer, I , can telj you ; ,and there's , a; good ;? sot.'- of .true boy's,,, that's., :just ;;of my mind,, and— - — Tv. ,'?;. ,,,.-.'/;,-. i ..'.,?,?. : '..-... ,,.' Shut, your trap, can't you,?' growled ,T.hqirips.pn ; -ff.you'll blob,-it,all presently.,' r -/(f Not, pq me,': said Carelyj ;',for I will ; Jiot hear a word of it. I' am hero un justly, but circumstances were against me. I blame neither the law nor those who tried mo ; and unless my innocence should be proved, I will bear my punish ment patiently. If you aro thinking ' of 'any violence, let me warn you against it ; and let me toll you fairly, too, that, if you say a word about such a thing in my hearing, not oven our lm'!-o L-o°a friends shall f'''11 my letting tho officers know it. ' And you would givo up your old pal to be scragged, would you, you piti ful, sneaking ? ' Hero the. violence ot passion choked his utterance for a mo rhent,'and enabled Carely to reply. 'I shall not lot my feelings interfere with my dnty. I did so once, and I have suffered for it. I did not blame the laws, as I said before; and I neither mean to break them myself nor encou rage -others to do it. Got all theso foolish things out of your head, Ringer. Learn to be sober and steady ; do your duty well and cheerfully ; shun that which has been the curse of your life bad company ; and you will hear no more of chain-gangs and Norfolk Island.' ' ' He shook off the relaxing grasp of tho conscience-stricken felon, and hurried on his way without bestowing a glance on Thompson. He heard, however, his Coarse laugh as he bade Ringer ' Not to mind that blessed milk-sop ; ' and he asked himself, as he passed along, whether the blow which had fallen upon - him, sharp as it had been, was not dealt in mercy, in order to snatch him, however roughly, from tho contaminating in fluences that could sink souls to such a level as this. It was not long before this' ques tion was succeeded by another. : Ringer had hinted at the exist ance of some plot against the au thorities ; and, although ho had been prevented by Thompson from giving any clear explanation, it was evident that something dangerous was in agitation. Was it not his duty to givo timely information to the offi i cers ? Law Jhad certainly done no thing for him that should engage his sympathies on its side: it had mis judged him, stigmatised him, and made his present and his future ; alike a desert. But Carely's. mind was of |too upright a cast to be its enemy on this account. He had always assigned his con demnation to its true cause — the unfortunate combination of cir cumstances against him— and he did not hesitate to admit that, had ho been a disinterested juryman instead of the criminal in tho dock, his decision on the evidence would, in all probability, have been the same as that of the jury by whom he was tried. Moreovei1, ho had heard enough of Thompson's char acter since his arrival at the settle ment to be aware that nothing was too desperate for him to attempt ; and suffering, as we have already observed, had produced that strength ening effect upon his! character. that he no longer, as in earlier, days, suffered his feelings to lead his principles astray. He saw, in an instant, that to be silent from any desire to screen Ringer from the possible consequences of his misconduct was to make himself a par ticipator in his guilt; and consoling himself with the reflection that it would be doing him a service to wrench him, by any means, from the baneful influ ence of such a man as. Thompson, he went direct to the superintendent of convicts, arid laid the particulars of the - conversation before him, ' Your information,' said the officer, - when he had heard him to the close; ' 'tallies exactly with some rumours-' ; which have already reached inc. , I have ? known for some time — for- we aro obliged to keep our wits about- us — that something was hatching, and have had my eye on several parties as being likely to have hand in it. What you tell mo will ^ be very useful, for I know theso men's haunts and associates, and shall now be able to go straight on to tho work of obtaining the additional information that I want. You have done your duty, Carely, under circumstances which would have tempted many men away from it ; and your conduct in this case, and,, indeed, ever since you have been in the i settlement, has been so highly satisfactory that I shall recommend the Secretary to grant you a pardon.1' j The first, smile that had. been seeu on Carely's face since his arrival in tho colony played faintly -round his lip as ,he (listened to praise which he felt he had deserved. 'I thank yousincercly, sir,' ho said, ' for all your kindness to mo, and, not tho least, for whatl you have said now. ; but I cannot accept youn offer; I com-r initcd no crime in-. Idlrijjland,. though I am suffering tho punishment of ono. I know yon cannot blot out my sontenco, and to accept a pardon would be a con icssion of guilt.'1 : , ?
