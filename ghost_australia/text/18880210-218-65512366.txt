THE SEARCH FOR MULLIGAN'S FORTUNE. Dx W. T. PEaxie. Well, ye see, yer honour, Paddy Mulligan tived always to himself-that is, not alto gather, as ye might say, to himself ethoroughly all out, for he wouldn't refuse a aint, or a quart for the matiher of that rom a frind now an' thin, but he didn't walt so encourage much of a resort to hi. lodgin's. Is wasn't because they war in a tbaook ethreet. for be wasn't proud. The dickens a bit of cunsate was in poor Paddy bathe had the name of a hape of money, an nobody ever heerd the jingle of it but him S, it was a sort of curiosity to find out how be was livin', but. 'aunte enough, he kep' al go himself, like a hermit of she mountains whui he was in his top back room. Now and thin ye'd fled him with an odd sbilin', but, like a motherless calf, it was always alone. Paddy seemed to have no relations, or, I be bad, he didn't encourage thei seqnaintsnoee. But there's one thing certain -Paddy was fulntl up of money, wherever oa a th he managed to serape it up. Some say that be dbramin' one night ha found onut where there was a crock of goold bi in the Dublin mountains-that he dug il ,p In She dark and carried it home in a basket ? evered with water-creases. 'Xer basket's ver"-e? ayy-'-aiz a w"..-" _ ost let me look at nothin',' aI the -:? elt.. . Ah, it's only sods for a lark I have in he basket thi morein'.' 'Well, jusnt for a lark, I'll have a look at thim,' seiz the constable. An' whin he seen the goold, Sits down on the diteh here,' it be. 'I'm not goin' to stop in the force-I dona't liks it, and I hate to bean informer, so we'll divide the money an' say nothin.' Paddy ea.uldn't help it, so they squared it an the disch. But that's only a bit of the gossip that got out about him-just becasuse his nelghbours were jealouc. Two or three times he was on the pop of bein' married, but somehow he found out it was the money the girls war dhrivin' at, an' he dbhrew out of the job en a sudden. ' He cheekmated thim,' as Lannigan the wax use to way. Well, tho' be grew to be s party stale owld bachelor, all his money, wherever he kept it couldn't howld the breath in his body An one. mornin' after wonderin' what wa become of him thro' not havin' turned up cnce the day befcr began, a pulls brook open the d?re, and found poor Paddy Mulligan eostthered over the bed, a dead corpse. re. Belly. the landlady, said, 'His sowl must bave tuck its flight in the night.' They had a powerful eareh all over the room for the mcny up in the top back nom. An'afther a terribeis sight of throuble all In the world that they sould some across was four and uinepenee half-penny in th lift-hand calico pocket of his throwsers. The corner brought his inkweetruond-en' vat on Paddy; but paba I They might a well be thryin' to serape the silver ciff th moon. Not a esorap of eahb, or any pape -enisarnin' any deposlt, was found eithe Inside the room or outside the room, This was the quarest thing at all. Wha In the world had become of his fortune Was it took by the fairies ? Or where was it scatlered to at all, at all? He hadn't been robbed, for his windy and ?ure. woar nowlted all right whin he was bond lyin' dead that mornin'. SSome said may be the poiie grushed i into. his mittet., or it might have been -perrlted away be the owld boy; for poor Paddy wasn't all out a complate patthern in aeuard of hbls religious duties. - Be that a it may, we're not goia'-totodge the crasher, now he's gones; butwhat had become of h'e property was one of the dead nayerete of the etbreet where Paddy lodged, Some said the landlady bad put her -mawleys on it, bus sure I knew her well \- asself, for I was ecortin' her, till I threw her uPs he larnin' that she couldn't have stole a flHok of it; an' she died in the poor-house sither. Well, porr Paddy was only jaut put into the ground for about a fortnight, whin a -athranger kem to the house, an' with big tears rowlin' down his nose, be towld Mrs. Xerrigan, the landlady, that be was the last le'in' nephew of Paddy Mulligan, his uncle He discourseed her for awhile, an' towld her be was preperin' for the Church ; an', pick. in' a prayer-book out of his breast pocket, be axed her, with a mournful groan, to be allowed uF to the room where Paddy ges up his ghost, so that he might pray a few prayera for the poor on'ortunate speeit o his uncle. Well, he med sunob a poor month an' was eo out up in respect of wishin' to wave hie uncle's cowl. that the widow couldn't refuse the orather. do she brought him upstairs, unlocked the door, an' let him in. He gave three Irg shurchyard sighs as if hisb heart was bruek. SAn',' sir be, wid more big tears beltin down his nt as, is hbe, ' I don't want to be disturbed, Mrs. Kerrigan, while I'm at me prayers.
