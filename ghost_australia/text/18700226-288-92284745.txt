All she could hope was that he would have the sense, that dangerously keen night, to run off to the brick kilns, and get warmth there. , , ' , But the mortal terror lay upon her yet; she -was unable to tell why or wherefore ; unless from the strangely appealing agony contained in the cry^ still less could she shake it off.

JimBatley chose to stay. .He was a tail, thin,- obstinate, fellow, of eleven, and' meant to wait and speak to David.
