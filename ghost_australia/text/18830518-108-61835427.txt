PORTFOLIO. There are two characteristics of the first miracle of our Lord which we ought to notice. One is its divine unselfishness. His ministry is to be a ministry of joy and peace ; His sanction is to be given not to a crushing asceticism, but to a genial innocence ; His approval not to a compul. sory celibacy, but to a sacred union. He who, to appeas BHis own sore hunger, would not turn the stones of the wilder noess into bread, gladly exercises, for the sake of others, His transforming power; and but six or seven days afterwards re lieves the perplexity and sorrow of a humble wedding feast by turning water into wine. The first miracle of Moses was in stern retribution, to turn the river of a guilty nation into blood; the first of Jesus to fill the water jars of an in nocent family with wine. And the other is its symbolic character. Like nearly all the miracles of Christ, it contains the characteristics of a work of mercy, an emblem and a prophecy. The world gives its best first, and after wards all the rlregs and bitterness ; but Christ came to turn the lower into the richer and sweeter, the Mosaic law into the perfect law of liberty, the baptism of John' into the baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire, the self-denials of a painful isolation into the self-denials of a happy home, sorrow and sighing into hope and blessing, and water into wine. And thus the " holy estate" which Christ adorned and beautified with His presence and first miracle in Cana of Galilee foro shadows the mystical union between Christ and His Church; and the common element which He thus miraculously changed becomes a type of our life on earth transfigured and ennobled by tihe anticipated joys of heaven-a type of that wine which He shall drink now with us in the kingdom of God at the marriage supper of the Lamb.-Canumo Farrar.
