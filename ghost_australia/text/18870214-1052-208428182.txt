GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S NEW OPERA. All doubts are, now set at rest as. to the clime and the period of the plot and incidents. It is not to be Egyptian or Oriental, but essentially English. It will; belong' to the " snore waistea - ana close, acting pantaloon " period. - It was at the introduction of this fashion, that a celebrated beauty declared that she felt " like a pair of scissors wrapped in a' pocket handkerchief." The opera has not yet been christened and the plot even is not yet known. The latest issue of the Pall Mall Gazette, . contains a communication from Mr. W. S. Gilbert, who states " we have not yet decided on the title, but the following will be the distribution of .characters, .

The music both vocal and instrumen tal will have about an essentially English ring, and it will not.be' sur prizing if many of the very old English airs are furnished for the occasion. As is the case in Patience where the duet " Willy Willy Waley " is not also but an old country ditty. W.H.W.
