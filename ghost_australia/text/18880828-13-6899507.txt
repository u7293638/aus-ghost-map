THE FRENCH PICTURE (L-LL'J-BY. I HErE PAINTINGS. The "Glory of M Hixena was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1888, and represents a young musician struck by death while seated at the piano, and engaged in the work of composition, his right hand still resting on the keyboard, while some music has fallen from his left. An ideal figure, whose limbs seem to be unfinished below the waist, embraces him with one arm and holds aloft the wreath of immortality with the other; the light falling from behind upon her out- spread wings, the white pillow and the head of the corpse. The picture is a curious mixture of ideality and realism. C Lundelle'a "Italia " is a typical beauty, S)mhohealof the land of the citron and myrtle," but the pose of the head and the expression of her face resemble those of: a Parisian coquette rather than of a human or Neapolitan collendina. The head and neck are painted with characteristic dexterity. "'The Nurse's Seat at the Orphanage of St. Vale), by P. L Delingo, is from the salon of 188-, where it attracted some attention on account of its subject, and the fresh and airy feeling which the composition inspires A group of Normal wet nurses are seated on a bench with half a dozen chubby little foundlings around them, under the charge of three sisters of mere and the art st has taken care to show that the healthy and hearty step-mother are no falseness trawler, like the nurses of Morven, who contrive, according to Dr Mount, to dispose of 51 per cent, of the infants entrusted to their charge. Life is evidently a pleasant thing to the new-comers at St. Valery. 11 A. Guilloi.s Summer" is from the Salon of 1886, and shows a female bather prone upon the ground in a shady nook near the waterside, watching the airy movements of a couple of white butterflies. Ita accurate modelling, sobriety of colour, and effective trc moment of direct and reflected light-the former falling full upon the surface of the figure, which is seen in profile, and the latter given back by the white garment upon which she is lying are worthy of note. The same remark will apply to the " Andromeda of 1. Sum, an artist who is equally at home in landscape painting, in portraiture, and in the portrayal of mytho- logical subjects There are two other nude figures one of them from the pencil of a lady, Mdlle. Marguerita Arose, who depicts a girl entering a bath, upon which she is sprinkling rose leaves, but her arms appear too short, and the upper portion of her legs too long, while the lower part of the leg is so defectively fore shortened as to suggest that it must have shrank The other nudity, by Jules wheat, is superior in modelling to the lastnamed picture Mme. -ailes Wagner 13 a pretty regular exhibitor at the Salon, and her Hebo " in i what Mr. Whistler would probably call , " a harmony in pink," but possesses no I specific qualities to differentiate it from a hundred other conventional pictures which have been painted of the beautiful wife of t -creates ( "The Wine Press of Charles Frere is from the Salon of 1888, and is one of the best t pictures of its class In the talks). It represents four labourers loading a dray with wine a cases, each figure full of strenuous action, at the horses well drawn and grouped, the t wine press, the man filling a cask, and all r the architectural accessories well worked ; out ; while the general tone of the work is a subdued and harmonious. The same artist i has contributed a snow scene, in which a a waggon with its four horses has drawn up r in front of a wa) side forge, and the blacks j smith la showing one of the shaft horses. The work entitled "Mnmm! Labour in one of the Parochial Schools of Paris," by At TruphCrae, is from the Salon of 1883. It in- a treasure the Dures of about -ve-Ã¢iid-twenty j boys undergoing instruction in the mechanical arts under the superintendence of three of their teachers and is interesting as showing what is being done in the way of technical education in the French metropolis. M. fruphCme makes subjects of this fund his specialty, and has since exhibited a picture of a cutting and sewing class, and another of the dictation of lessons, in the free girls' schools of that city F A Delobbe's charming pictures of peasant girls, as, for example, his " Village homance" (1883), his "Young Grape Gatherer ' (1888), and his "two Daughters of the Ocean ' (ISfio), we may well believe to be much truer to nature than Zola's gross caricatures of them in La Terre, and his "Little Gleaner is quite worthy of his reputation. She is standing in a cornfield, in an easy and natural position, her face full of simple earnestness and innocence, the bare feet somewhat exaggerated in size, and the whole figure capitally painted Another rustic subject is skilfully treated by E L Dej rolls in "Haymaking," a picture which was exhibited in the Salon of 1837 The 1 landscape is from La Vendee, and the three figures consist of a mother, who is seated on the ground mending his broken se) the, and a couple of peasant girls, who are looking on but in all three of the faces we 2s T a may read the same melancholy expression fT which is generally observable on the countenances of Millers rustic folk "The Awakening' ofT Lobnchon shows a couple of rosy cushions in a nest that is slung like a hammock, with some love birds perched above them, and an cutout age of flowers and creepers. One of the two has been awakened by the morning sun, but the other is still sleeping heavily and the technical qualities of the work are such as might be expected from the pencil which produced the delightful "Bagage de Croquemitame" and ' Uno Corvee, the latter exhibited at the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1886 The "Charity of P E Mangeant looks like a sketch in oils, and a very bad one, too, for a fiasco, and was certainly not worth sending far Two pictures by Emile Bay and, representing a duel between a couple of Parisian becomes a blonde and a brunette, who are fighting with small swords in the presence of four female witnesses, appear to attract more attention than any other works in the gallery Neither of them, however, is the work which made so much stir in the Salon of 1888, and both have been probably painted in consequence of the popularity acquired by the original composer twin In the second picture the blonde has been wounded, and her antagonist is all affection and contrition C Lnndelle's Algerian Musician" represents a woman seated in an attitude of idle languor on a divan, listlessly thrumming i drum, the light entering from a window behind and serving to accentuate the ample proportions of her well developed figure, the upper portion of which is discreetly veiled by a a lace bodice All the textures are cleverly painted, and the work is rich in colour In the "Paquita" of A M Lahaje welfare a somewhat coarsely painted full length a portrait of a lady descending secluded wood path, with an air and attitude as studied as if she were entering a drawingroom The workmanship of the flowers and insects in T H Laporte'a " Hoses and Butter- flies," is superior to that of the nymph and the two cushions, one of whom appears to be * suffering from a swollen face, while the other is taking a bite out of the young lady's hair, whose right eye is farther from her nose than the left A clever study of chiaroscuro, representing the approach of a train along a railroad at midnight with a signalman just issuing from his cottage lamp in hand, and the lights of a distant city reflected from the sky just above the verge of the horizon, is hung so high that the artists name is indistinguish- able The " Ciga'o " of Pierre Huas, 13 a departure from the usual method of treating this hackneyed subject. Instead of being naked and entering, the merry girl is well clad, and is having a pleasant time of it with her mandoline L Le Jeane's " First Rendezvous " introduces us to a scene of gallantry of the old fashioned sort, when a courtly beau could not make an offer of marriage without dropping on his knees and both the figures and the garden in which the rait rot/s occurs are treated after the manner of Watteau and Boucher Of purely rural subjects, the more notice- able are the "Labour" of A. Mouttc, which represents a man ploughing some stiff clay land and two women sowing corn in his wake , the "Winnowers," of Louise Lands, in which some male and female Breton peasants, cleverly drawn and grouped, are feed- ing a winnowing machine near a corn stack and a "Girl with Goats," by D Maillard. If Viger'a picture of Buonaparte and his family at Malmaison introduces us to the whole of the female members of it, including the first Empress and their favourite ladies in writing interesting both as portraits of historical personages and as illustrations of costumes which were characterised by Madame to Abr entes, in her " Memoirs, ' as supremely elegant ' Another portrait that of Sarah Bernhardt in costume- p tinted on panel with the of vee in profile, by L 'four men, is sure not to be overlooked on account of the celebrity of its subject. seASCAPES In this department the display is decidedly weak, and the slap dash execution which the Impressionists have brought into vogue, their preference for generalisation over detail, and for mad over colour, and their want of clearness and definition arc dis agreeably exemplified in "The Creek at N'nirmoutier, of' Bourgeois in the mass of brown rock, and the willows, entries, and rushes painted by Gustave Geraud in the Lavoir m Normand), by P E Berton, in the coast scene of Henri Cross, in the strange caprice entitled ' An Evening Effect," by E R Menaid, where the path of glory which the setting sun has traced across the wave is represented by what looks like a newly) painted allow post, and in the sketchy coast scene at Dulette, by 0 The on these bear the same relation to the true picture of a landscape which the lungs and more conduct a descriptive writer do to his (unshed work They are, at the best, only sketches and sometimes very slovenly ones Nor is the undoubted talent of M Berne Bellecourt adequately represented by his two BrauU Algerine views Of a much better character is the view at La Chaise, by Georgia Sorrier, a strongly painted picture, in which the warm sunlight hitting on the farm buildings and on a patch of gravelly soil in the fore ground, and the cool shadow on the pond and under the cartshed, supply effective values, while the foliage of the expansive tree, which forms such an effective feature in the composition, gives it mass A, Dcfaux sends two landscapes, the provisions in the forest of Fontainebleau in which the trees, the rank herbage, the flowering heaths, the rock pool in the foreground, and the vista which opens out beyond are rendered with great truth to nature The second, "The Banks of the thing" with its blossom ing trees and .ucgeatiotiH of a bland spring atmosphere, and of renovated youth in the foliage and the grass, also contains some good artistic work. " Apple Trees at the Loysel Farm," by Paul Colin, who exhibited another picture painted in the immediate vicinity of the same farm in this year's Salon, is a careful study of both fruit and timber trees, thatch and herbage, solidly painted. And there is a bright little landscape by Gustave Garaud, entitled "The Cascades at Cernay La Ville," which may be regarded more as an artist's cheerful memorandum of a brawling stream, spring foliage, and a sunny atmosphere, than as a finished work ; while in M Iwill's large picture entitled " Evening, Morsahnes, Manche the meagreness of the subject and the monotony of the scene are partly compensated for by the cleverness with which he has handled his theme. CATTLE riEcns Louis Banllot's Normandy Pastures, Morning" is the best cattle piece in the collection, and is the work of an artist whose pictures are generally well hung in the Salon The composition is a pleasing one in every respect, the animal in the fore- ground is admirably painted both in form and action, by the way, it is a repetition of the cow in " The Barrier," which was exhibited in the Salon four years ago and the far stretching meadows, with a hint of the sea in the instance, the soft silvery atmosphere, and the general feeling of the picture recall some of the best works of a similar kind by the Dutch painters of Paul Potter's time We have seen much better work from the pencil of H Bonnefoy than " The Sheeplold ' here exhibited, and which was placed in the Salon last year It is sketchily and loosely painted, efiVctnt' enough, in its ensemble, at a little distance, but disappointing when the workmanship comes to be close]) examine I T. Mudan- flock of sheep retreating from an upland pasturage, in order to seek shelter from an impending storm, and a small cattle piece, representing four king standing in a stream with the evening light falling on their ridgy backs, an 1 a peaceful landscape behind, are the only other works of this class which claim a passing notice. still firm A. Grivolis' "At the 1 Forest's " 18 from the Salon of 1887 It is a large composition, with great masses of what the French call end, of colour juxtaposed in startling contrast, heightened by a background of sombre green, with a [general want of defini- tion as regards individual form and much confusion of art ingenuity. In the "Spring " of Paul Perrier we seem to be looking at the ghosts of the roses, poppies, and roses he has painted in such a fantastic Key of colour rather than at living flowers, so that the picture suggests a defective vision on the part of the artist He has certainly got as far away as possible from the learned the cause, and from the freshness, truth, and decency of the 1 Jewish flower painters who have bestowed enduring life upon some of the most evanescent of natural objects But Mile J Cronan, on the other hand, in her picture entitled "For Christmas," which was exhibited in the Salon of 1887, and a lover, in his "Seems,' the two best examples of this kind of work in the gallery, have been faithful to the best methods of the best artists and both pictures contain a great deal of patient and honest work, based upon a careful study of nature 11. P. Uelanej'a "Love and Glory," and the "Cloves of Pierre Huns, who is better known in Paris as a portrait painter, are also pleas- ing pictures of their kind.
