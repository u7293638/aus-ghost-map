SCIENTIFIC BIOGRAPHY. Standard.) Our grandfathers used not to concern themselves very much with the moral character of the dead, especially of dead horses and men of genius The heroism of the genius was enough for them, they regarded it as a legacy, and a valuable possession, good for the edification of those who remained above ground, and too good to be marched over with sorry little details about the sins and shortcomings of the departed Perhaps they were too tender-hearted towards the men or women who could no longer since if one should smite them on the cheek, and who certainly could not smile back Perhaps they bore in mind the fable of the dead lion and the living as., and honoured the proverb which enjoins that nothing but good ought to be spoken of those that are gone However this may be, they showed a tendency to canonise then heroes and if a great genius, like By ion 01 Shelley, for instance, had been under a ban in his lifetime, then simple notion was that he had been sufficiently punished when the grave closed over him, and they straightway began to forget the hard things that they had said about him, to extol his best qualities, and to make little of his faults No doubt one consequence of this i denting humour was that our grandfathers could tbuted less than they might have done to build up that exact science of biography for which it seems that our own generation is to be specially renowned They, are then weakness, presented to idealise, and appi l en Hy had no compunctions for the heavy burden of proof and disproof which they were thus casting upon the shoulders of their steamer children's children And so it comes to pass that the biographers of the present, is an, rate such of them as profess boat iphy is an exact science, slinking no details, tine 01 untrue, simply because they are unfavourable to a dead man's character, is often sorely exercised to disci minister amidst the varying testimony of contemporary writers But no scientific biographer is baulked by perplexities of this sort The to use and the method triumphs gloriously over the difficulties bequeathed by good-natured but mistaken panegyrics, and turns its detective bull's eye upon the startled Valh ills of genius and heroism The ghosts of Byron and Shelley, of Poe and (Jailyle and Wilberforce "if any care for what is here survive in spirits rendered see no longer live in a fool's paradise of charity and sympathy with their kind They must know by this time that they are open books to all who come after them The inevitable biographer has thumbed every corner of then world-weary hearts, and either has revealed, or intends to reveal every secret no ignition Tlencefoith, not even the least and meanest of their actions can be hidden from the vulgar eye As the geologist will draw as the mastodon flour one of its morals, and the pieces pass it on its paddle, so the scientific biographer will give us " the real" genius of " the real " hero born a few scraps of his hand writing The character once determined by this infallible process, recorded facts must square themselves with it is best they' may If they do not so much the worse for them, they will assuredly be wiped out 01 amended to suit the new discovery. No one has ever offered more tempting material for the industry of biographical demonstrators, no one has been more thoroughly dissected and he dissected for the benefit of posterity than the unfortu n ite Lord Byron First ernie Tom Moore, is the peiNOinl f neild and literary executor, and it may be supposed that Moore's plan of dealing with his subject, which included the burning of some of the most interesting documents committed to his ch. age, would mean me senseless contempt from the waters of memoirs and reminiscences in our most competent days It is doubtful w whether Leigh Hunt ought to be credited as the pioneer of scientific biography in Byion'scise, but it my late he enunciated one or two theories which have since his time been freely discussed and enlarged upon Reviewers innumerable, and 10 in meet s not a few, delighted to sketch the poet's likeness as their inner consciousness h happened to pi empty them, and then, in the fulness of time, an alien 1 lady came to our assistance with a circumstantial luiriativesuch.isfevv before he had the ingenuity to conceive, and not one, we think, the courage to put into print Soon the new process fairly began If someone ch need to light upon an autograph letter from the poet, or a reference to him in a hitherto unpublished diary of correspondence the v side of the discovery would be trumpeted abroad, many pages would be written to show how this pal ticular piece of evidence outweighed all that had gone before it, and the By tonic legend would be wholly or in part reconstructed, in order to make the most of the fresh material "It is not too much to say, one superfine critic observed a few years ago, after quoting from a m manuscript to which he had recently had access, "that so long as this document remained in obscurity the life of Byron could not be fitly written, whereas now it is not likely that any thing further will be brought to light which can seriously affect the poet's biography Amongst the latest discoveries is Mr leaf fresh, whose highly interesting new views of the poet's- life' establish for him a large 1 me on the gratitude of his leaders But the last word of all is with Mr J A. Froude, who, in the current number of the Nineteenth Ct lottery, seems to question Mr. Jcofhesou'a right to say anything at all about the matter, and who doubtless exposes one error into which the author of "The Real Lord By ion" had allowed himself to fall Now the great charm of critical biography is that it has normality, and scarcely any fixed principles, so that as soon as one critic has had his say about mother he in his turn, becomes a target for the next It is quite possible for an adept in the science to get up and show that Mr Froude, is warmly demanding Shelley against the merest breath of suspicion, has by implicit tion been monstrously utmost to Byram. We say it is possible for an adept to enter this, but we by no means, declare that it could be proved to anyone's satisfaction except his own, and least of all to the satis- faction! of Mr. Froude We have referred to the modem and dogmatic processes of Wcvgraphj as an exact science, but in so doing we merely? adopted for at moment the point of view taken by a thÂ« dogmatists themselves. It would be very difficult indeed to define the boundaries of a science whose professors distinguish themselves mainly by passing straight from single instances to positive dogma, without submitting to the patient generalisation which is supposed to be the sine qua wm of science It is, we fear, useless for they henry school in the present day to expect that their conclusions will be received as canonical by the reading public if they insist on taking the top of the inductive method out of their regular order, 1 and put the careful of assertions before the laborious animals by which it ought to be drawn. If we are to have the lives of all our great men written over again, we should like to have it done in a kindly, genial, sympathetic spirit, with all due respect for true biographers who have gone before, and who, to say the least for them, had the advantage of gleaning their ears of corn, whilst the very stubble of the harvest field was full of sand. It is questionable whether the new gleaning can yield sufficient grain to make the trouble remunerative ; but in any case we should not be asked to throw away the old sheaf, or to think scorn of the old gleaners. It is just con- ceivable that some useful purpose is served by throwing a stronger light upon the lives and characters of the dead, in order that they may be known to posterity for exactly what they were seldom better, but as a rule, it would seem, considerably worse than we thought them. This may be worth doing, though there is plenty of room for doubt on the subject. If, however, we are to be invited and urged to chance our opinions about the men and women whom we have been wont to admire in the post, let us at least be quite sure that the newly-discovered flaws in our old friends are not mere distortions of the critical prism, or fallacious appearances under the microscope of a scientific biographer. It is a small thing to give one's friend incredulity when his critics abuse him. Let it be clearly understood that this incredulity is one of the things against which the latter-day gleaners have to contend, and that if they discover, or imagine that they have discovered, anything to the detriment of a departed hero, they must not only prove their assertion up to the hilt, but even then stand an excellent chance of being disbelieved.
