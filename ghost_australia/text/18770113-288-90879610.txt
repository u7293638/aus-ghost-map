THE MYSTEEIES OF CEIME; OB, The Experiences or an Ebtnbuboh Deiecttve. — No, XXTX. [Published 'by special arrangement \sith the Author.] A VENGEFUL PREDICTION. Three young girls were coming in from the South Side, by Nieolson-street and the Bridge, talking warmly and earnestly. The time was about 8 o'clock, on a warm rosy evening in May. The whole three were dressmakers, working ia the same shop; and they had now been home, had their suppers, hurriedly dressed,-and come out for a stroll. But something above the mere pleasure of [motion and the desire for fresh air was now quiekening their steps, and drawing forth their eager entreaties and calm reasonings. For shortness, I will simply call the first two Mary and Annie ; but to the third, who is much more de serving of notice, I will give her full name —Jane Hannah. ' But, Jane, you might just come and hear her tell my fortune,' said Mary, in a tone of eager, entreaty; 'I'm sure Til be frightened out of my wits unless you are bvme.' 'Then, why go at aE?' was the calm' reply. 'Because I really want to know.' 'Want to know what?' ' Why, what silly questions you ask,' stammered the other, blushing nevertheless, as if in shame. ' I want to know what my fortune is to be, and who I'm to get, and all that.' 'Well, Mary, you may well blush at your own words,' said Jane Hannah, with ? a steady look of, reproof and an expression of pained surprise. 'Is it possible that you really believe in this unhallowed non sensical buffoonery.' 'She must believe it,' put in Annie, coming to the rescue ; ' didn't the * Great Seer' tell my fortune ? and didn't she tell me his age, and the color of his hair, and his height and complexion. And didn't I see Mm in her magic glass,' and the girl's voice sank into a whisper of awe at the recollection. 'When I saw it I could not help exclaiming, *Oh, if Jane had only seen this!' It was fearful. There is no doubt about it — she is a terrible woman, and has great powers, and does see into the futtffle.' These words, which: I give exactly as they were repeated to me afterwards, will give, the reader a pretty good cue to the; characters of the three girls. The first and second, ;Mary and Annie,, were ordinary, light-hearted girls, with the usual amount of frivolity and secret inclining to supersti tion; but the third, Jane Hannah, was of a superior mould, in mind, education, and culture. , ???'????,? There was a moment's silenee, which Mary and Annie interpreted in their own way. . ?- '. ' ' ' Now, confess, Jane,' cried one of them, *? you're afraid of this strange woman your self?' .. ' i am not — I have no «ause. 'No, because you are to be married next ;« month, and so can guess pretty well how things will turn out with you.'' il There you mistake — I am only horrified to hear that you actually believe in this blasphemy of everything sacred — for blas phemy it must be called when any one pre tends to reyeal secrets known only to Crod.' ' Then, why are you afraid to go with i(Iamnot' ? 'Then, go.'- There was a moment's hesitation; and then, ?with a reluctance which she took no pains to cpneeal, Jane ^replied— ??m ' I will go, but only to convince you how little weight these, trumpery revelations should have with any right-minded girl.' -¥ou;wiir?' eagerly cried the other; ' Now, you promise not to draw back ?' 'Ibromise.' 'Ha, .ha, ha! Now I will tell you & thing that .will surprise you. She said you ttxniMj&meP;' 'Who «aid?* *l She, the Great Seer, the fortune-teller and reader of the stars. When J told her of your unbelief, she consulted her oracle ana found ihat you were to come toJier.' ' Her oracle ? ? What's that ?' *[I don't know; how should I?' un easily returned the girl, 'It's something she tells by; thafs all I know. You're frightened now. I see it in your face.' 'lam not, what you see is pity — pity for your credulity, and sorrow for your ignorance.' ^'Ignorance, indeed!' cried the other, with a toss of the head and a little anger in her tone, ' say that when you are coming back.' ' Now, Annie, don't be angry with me,' gently returned Jane, for you know I like you, and would do anything to serve you. I do not mean that you are ignorant generally ; if you were, 1 question if I could take such pleasure in your company, but I consider that your knowledge on this sub ject is all of a one- sided Mnd. I do not blame you or think you one jot less love able on that account. I have had un common chances for getting rid of these fancies — you have not ; indeed few women have.' Annie was softened at the humble con cessions; but still held to her original ground. ' Oh, I am not a bit angry with you,' she kindly and cheerfully answered, 'but let's say no more about it till we're coming back. I know Fm pretty ignorant — every- body is, I suppose — -out it seems to me that if any one foretells a thing, and the thing actually takes place, that proves that they can see* into the future.' Jane's answer was a good one *, and, as it bears very weightily on the present case, the reader would do well to note it. ' Yes; it would tend to prove it, if they did not themselves try to bring about the event.' ' How ?' cried Annie, warming into in dignation, ' do you actually suppose they would' ? 'Would scheme, juggle, and trick!' echoed Jane. ' Yes, that is just what I do believe. It has been proved that these im postors not only condescend to such things, butpractise them on every possible occasion. One remarkable prediction coming true is enough to make a fortune.' The words carried weight with them'; but Annie was still only half-convinced. 'I wish you would let her tell yoUr for tune while we are there,' she half sighed. ' If she spaed it wrong I would never again doubt on the subject.' 'It would do no good, but perhaps the reverse,' was the thoughtful reply. ' Your * Great Seer,' even by your own confession, knows or has heard of me already; and who knows but the facts she gleaned from you may be only a tithe of her other infor mation. For aught you know she may be intimately acquainted with all my past life, down to some of the minutest circum stance.' How sound was this surmise — uncon- sciously uttered though it was — and what a fearful truth it contained subsequent events amply showed. ' Yes ; but that would not enable her to foretell your future, would it ?' sneered the other. ' I don't know, it^'would give her a handle, and wickedness and cunning might supply the rest.' The three girls turned down the High street and into one of its dark, narrow closes; and after a great deal of .caution and delay they were admitted to the sanc tum of the 'Great Seer.' It was still light outside, even in the close they had penetrated; but true to the time-honored custom of such rogues, every gloomy ap pliance that could appeal to the senses and convey an impression of awe or superstition was here ostensibly employed. The win dows were shuttered or ^boarded in, and 'ihe whole room draped in black; and instead of the cheerful sunlight there was one dull lamp burning inside a dimmed glass model of a human skull. Lively re presentations of skeletons bearing scythes and hour-glasses, and numerous other de vices of skull-and- crossbones character, were hung up on every side. The effect of the1 whole was theatrical in the extreme, and 1 daresay, seen in daylight would have made a sensible man laugh ; but seen only bysilly girls or superstitious devotees in the gloomy light of the ghastly lamp aforesaid, the effect was very different. Mary and Annie sat down pale and terri fied. Jane smiled lightly, and with irre verent curiosity busied herself in examining more closely the various decorations of the room. The jerking aside of a heavy curtain, and a harsh cry, in a deep masculine sort of voice, made her desist arid look round,. .rA curious, spectacle met her eyes. The 4e Great Seer' stood revealed— a big, tall woman, : with long hair of iron-grey flowing down to ' Jieir waist. Her dress was of a fantastic, Eastern caste, but not without a certain degree of magnificence, and bore here and tkere devices to match those of the room ; while her belt, and the zone which fastened' her hair, was of the same ghastly character. *I feel it!' br^kein the 'Seer,' in, deep tones, and fastening a piercing look upon the only smiling face in the room. 'There is an unbeliever within the walls. Let her standforth?' : ' ; The command was. scarcely necessary, for Mary and Aimie had shrunk back appalled, expectinglittle short of insiant death to their friend, and leaving' Jane standing alone. ?' 'Yes/ 1 am . that \unbelieyerj' said Jarie^ with a calmness and utter absence of fear . that almost a^tonished'i.erself. 'A^id it seems to me that we have met before. Your voice is familiar, and were your features laid bare and exposed to a clear lighty I feel certain that 'I would recognise1 you.' , . '. . ':..:--- ??? ?''.? '. ??

The little curtain was jerked to, and her fortune was told. ' * ' The fool and her money are soon parted,' was Jane's comment as her friend came back to their end of the room; and they were turning to leave, when again tie harsh voice ^ of the 'Seer' broke in- — — ' ' Stay. Unbeliever, approach !' Jane wonderingiy obeyed — principally in the hope of .getting a better glimpse of the l( Seer's' features. But in this she was frustrated. A thick veil was instantly dropped over the already half- concealed face ; the hand again jerked aside the little curtain, and the voice harshly growled forth — ' For an instant dispel your unbelief approach — behold!' Jane's eyes unconsciously rested on tha glass — some words were muttered as bef ore*, and the mist slowly left its surface ; and she started in spite of herself. Something like a face, or the picture of a face, was. there ; but it was the sudden recognition, ot fancied recognition, of the features that - staggered her. She thought in the mov mentary glimpse that she saw the face of the man who, in less than a month, was to be her husband. Thecurtainwas jerked to before she could recover herself or examine the tiling more closely, and then the ' Seer' reared herself ! majestically before; her, and appeared to i look into her very soul as she harshly pto» k nounced these words— ' ' % u You shall yet be a -wife, but never a mother A bride for an hour, but a maiden for ever.1* Whether this jargon was meant for ? rhyme or not xrf course it is quite out of ' my power to tell ; but it will easily be un derstood that from the attendant circum* siances the words made an impression' even on the sceptical Jane, to whose ear alone- they were addressed. It is true she still ' from her inmost soul derided and scorned : the pretensions of any one to dive into the future, and, had a fortune been promised^ her, she would only have smiled ; but still: she was onlv a woman, and the prophecy of such a terrible calamity, conveyed, as it ap peared to be, in a voice ? of deep malice and' hate, made her tremble. — The ' Seer' went backwards tnrougli the? curtain, and vanished as suddenly as she ? had appeared, and then the frightened/ ' girls found their way out i into'^ ; the i I^ea - - air. It was a calm, soft twiBght outside ;-*^ but even that dim light feU sbotiingly bnv their jaded senses after the fevered m&itt-; mery they had just assisted in. The girls hurried, on without speakings Jane looked pale and concerned, .and the ? \\. odd circumstance presently attracted tit©-'1, attention of the other two. . 'She has frightened you,' said one, not in triumph, but with real pity and con cern. ' Oh, 1 wish I had never asked yoit-*' '? to go ; I wish I had never gone myself.' 'Never mmd— -the th^Mpasi^let us; speak of it no more,' was the ^eadjrgre-v7 ply.

The discussing of ' U; this, with the attendant toasts, occupied^ :v fully an hour, andr%eny as usual,1 there* ^ was a 'great steer' while the supper-room was being cleared out to give room for dancing. Every one who nas been at such a wed ding knows that with the gentlemen — who * at this moment axe/generally considered ia ' everybody's way-i-J tMs is a favorite oppor tunity for a comfortable smoke; and ihat for that purpose they are generally bundled into some small bedroom full' of hats and cloaks, where theycanindulgethemselvesln ? '~ place. It was so in the pxesentcftse.' '.iW-' -bridegroom tad mixed with them, audstood laughingly the usual amount of banter, as near as they could calculate, for fully five minutes. One could distinctly remember giving him u a fill' of tobacco, and hearing him say 'I haven't a morsel — I must get some before the shops shut;' but no one .jeniembered seeing him leave the room, Five minutes after he 'was missed. Some one had said, ' Where's the bride ?^ropm?' and -was immediately answered by two of .the company, one of whom said, *' Gone for tobacco to the foot of the stair;' . -while the pthersaid, ' No — I heard a ring ; ^0 size's at thedoofe^eaMng to some one.' As 'the two could- odt agree, the matter became the subject of a bet, to decide which they ^searched high and low. But it was all in \Tain — the bridegroom had vanished. Here was an ugly state of affairs. Sur prise, and even consternation, was reflected froni face to face as the minutes rolled by ^?without a sign of the missing man. ' There is no need for alarm,' some one Lad the sense to say. 'Perhaps he has met .some one, and is being detained for a minute. For any sake, don't say anything to the bride. Li the meantime, m run out .again and find him, if he is to be found.' Two or three moTe volunteered for the same errand, and, then, with an uneasy 3&ng;, the remainder of the company heard the announcement that the room was ready for dancing. Now came the dreaded discovery. The l)ride had 'been too busy to notice the ^absence of her husband, but now, naturally 4— -^expecting to have to lead off the dance, she .smilingly ran her eye round the whole ?company, and said simply — 'Where's Bill f' Something in the faces of the gentlemen livetted her eyes and sent the blood rushing l)ack to her heart. White as a ghost, she shoved back eveiy one, and got into the saddle of the room. They fell back in awe from unnaturally bright eyes and wild aspect. ' Tell me where you have Md him ?' sheslowly got out, with a painful gasp at *every word. **' Oh, don't do this in a joke— i£ you only knew it, it is very cruel.' There was something so piteous in her tone that the tears started to the eyes of snany of lier hearers. This seemed to touch lieT like an electric spark. ' Where is he ?' she screamed. ' Tell me the worst.' 'Oh, he's safe enough, I've no doubt,' put in one, in a soothing tone. l ' He!s only gone down for some tobacco ; he'll be here Iby-and-bye.' 'No, no! there is something. more in ibis. You cannot deceive me,' cried the . frenzied bride. ' Who saw him go ?' There was a dead silence. 'Oh— oh— oh!' Scream upon scream came from the nap less young wife, as she staggered forward, throwing her arms wildly about in the air. ' Lost-— lost 1 A bride for an hour, but a maiden for ever V Some one flew forward and caught her as she fell, and then the young girls crowded xound and bore her from the Toom. All was now confusion and dismay. Of ?course, pleasure was no more to be thought '-? of 3 .and the gentlemen instantly organised themselves into a vigilant search party, and left the house to spread themselves over the adjoining streets and wynds. One of these found biff way to the Office, and the case ivas duly entered, although it was not thought there that anything serious or remarkable had taken place, but that the whole was merely some practical joke or ** spreeish lark,' of which we would hear no more. : But we did hear more of it. Very early in the morning, the informant, with two ©thers of the company, with dress suits, white ties, and bridal favours on, and look ing considerably draggled and jaded, ap peared with the astounding news that the missing bridegroom had neither been seen nor heard of. After supplying more minute details of the occurrence, they begged, in a -most urgent manner, that we should bestir 4 ourselves at once in the search, if only for the sake of the young wife, whose distress was beyond description. The result was a hastily scribbled note ±o myself, which they themselves brought out to me, and which I read with blinking eyes, sitting up in bed.. It was. only a line, ^and ran thus — u Be good enough to see into this' matter immediately. Bearers will give you all particulars/' . They did give me the particulars as far ?as they were known to themselves, while I 'washedanddressed; and very mysteriousand unaccountable the whole thing looked. I made no comment ; but by the time we got to the bottom of my stair, my mind was made up, on one point at least. ' I -woifldlike to see the friends of the missing man, and also, if possible, the bride herself.' ' . 'Before you begin tojmnt for him.' ' Yesj it Is my way— and I have always &-und it work welW-to begin at the f oun- tain headi and trace outwards, if his absence is not voluntary, or if any malice is .at the bottom of the affair, it is the most likely place to look for a cliie.' This seemed reasonable, and they readily accompanied me to the hride's house, the ^cene of the wedding. ... I got nothing out of the friends of the Sindegroom— they jkne^r pf no one who ?could be suspected of wishing him ill, and ?*ould,not hazard Vihe faintest guess at the . -cause of his disappearance ; but after some -delay I was admitted to the presence of the 'jjride. It was a pitiable sight. She was lying -on the sofa, eiM in her bridal dress, * --and surrounded ly her female friends, and ' -with lier eyes swollen nearly level with; 'Jier cheeks and her «yebrows— not tfith -tears, for^he had ;not shed one/ but with .quenchless grief. _ . ' After a^iiumher Of fruitless questions rregardiog her husband, I happened jna kind of random way to say — ''Have youfiQ enemies ? I mean, can you -think ,of no one Who would wish you ':: «W . ??-. ? ? ? . ? . 'No one,' was the despairing answer; then she paused and roused herself a little, ?'unless the f£eer^ if evil has been done f liim, that wicked woman knows something of it.' : -,??:/.-:-???? . 'The 'See??'*; T wonderingly echoed: ^andTPho^i^iB?'

' You open your eyes ; but I may tell you that that is saying a good deal. Are you quite sure it was a woman ?'* ' Yes — at least I think so. She calls herself a woman ; but in the dim light it is , almost impossible to get a clear look at her features.' 'I am glad you mentioned her. One question more, and do not let any false delicacy prevent you from answering it. Supposing this i Seer' knows something of the thing, can you not think of any one likely to prompt her the prophecyr or its fulfilment? — no discarded sweetheart, for instance ?' A sudden burning of her cheeks gave me hope that at last I had struck on a clue. But at first her answer belied it. ' I never had a sweetheart but one, and him I married. There was a worthless I scoundrel came about me about a year ago, but that was in Newcastle ; but though I Lad a half-liking for him at first, I threw him off the moment I. discovered the de basing principles that were hidden under his fair exterior.' . ' Good. What became of this man, do you know?' *' Not very well. I had to leave the town and come home here, and soon lost sight of him. I Relieve he went all wrong after I threw frim off — I mean he took to drinking, gave. up his trade, and went about some times as an actor, and sometimes as a kind of mesmerist and conjurer.' '? Did he ever utter, any threat against you?' Simple as the question was, it drove the blood from her cheeks. ' I had forgotten about that. ' Yes, he did once — only once — utter a threat.' '* Can you remember its nature ?' A sudden cry — a clenching of the hands —and a wild burst of tears, was the only answer. if Oh, oh ! can it be possible that he has done this !' were the first sensible words I could make out among her hysterical sobs. ' It is. Can you remember the threat ? What did he say ?' ' He said if ever I married another, though he had to cross the seas to do it, he woidd be down on me like a wolf , and blast my happiness for ever.' 'His name?' ' His real name was John Eeddie, but he afterwards changed it to Professor Sehoni burgh.' ' Any peculiarity about his person ? For instance, had he particularly dark and searching eyes, with a kind of halfimpu dent, half-' raised' expression ?' 'Yes.' ' Had he a sharp face, clean shaven all over, thin lips, and a particularly white and resrularset of teeth, and was his heightabout five feet ten?' 'Yes — yes,' was the astonished re joinder. 'Have you seen him ?' ' I have, and about the precise locality you give to your l Great Seer.' Putting your knowledge and mine together, I don't think the author of the mischief will be . difficult to find.' A wailing cry was the answer. 'He is murdered — I know he's mur-' dered!' screamed the bride, in a sudden paroxysm of grief. 'I think not,' I hastened to put in, as calmly as possible. u It seems to me that the outrage, if one has been committed, has been aimed, not at him but at you. It is ];ad enough, I admit, for if the whole of liie details you have furnished me 'with are connected into one revengeful plot, had you been of a more superstitious nature, the whole might Jiave been sufficient to de prive you of reason, or perhaps life itself. It is not, I assure you, my habit to throw out false hopes, but my candid opinion is that he has only been decoyed out of the way for a short time, and will be found somewhere safe and sound.' It was difficult to convince the bride ; but while I was trying my best, a remark of mine drew forth an additional clue from the bridesmaid. 'It is certainly strange that this woman ? — this c Seer' — has never been noticed out side of the house,' I remarked, when the girl immediately put in— ' Yes ; and do you remember, Jane, you thought you knew her voice — that it was familiar to you, and you 'wished you could have seen her face better?' ' Is that the case ?' I asked with great interest, turning to the bride. 'Yes. I am- sure I knew the voice; I could not be mistaken — though where I have heard it before I cannot recollect.' ' Yes, and I would know it again,' put in the bridesmaid, ' for it was/deep andharsj^ just Nice a man's.n~' I. ' . ' Just like a man's*'' I noted the words, and smiled out at the thought. 'Ah, if I can only lay hands on Mr. itennie/' I remarked, 'I don't think the other — the ^Seer' — will be far to seek. Would it be asking too much for you to put on your things and come down and ' point out the door to me ?' The girl complied at once without the slightest hesitation, hurried off for a shawl and bonnet, threw them on over her white finery, and, leaning on the arm of her sweet heart, the bridesman, she soon brought me to the close, the stair, and the door. An Irishman opened the door, with a good deal of cursing, which he stopped the moment he caught sight of my nose. I asked. for his lodger. 'Divil a one. I have/' was his dogged reply. - 4/It*s the woman, the fortune-teller, the * Great Seer,'' put in the bridesmaid, as tounded at his effrontery.- ;? . 'You're mistaken entirely. Never a woman was in my house a fortune-teller i PYaps its the next door.' 'No, it isn't,' I:sharply interposed, 'it's here, and nowhere else. . 'By the blessed Mary, I swear there i never was a woman fortune-teller crossed my door, he began. u That's the truth, an' I'll stick to it ? ' « Well, a man then, in womerts clothes/1 ?I put in, getting out the handcuffs. ''.Where is he.' The cool words struck clean home. He staggered and gaped , with astonishment. He found^ his tongue in a moment, but then it was too late — -his .look had betrayed- him. 'Never a man -was here either/' he stoutly began, hufc I took him by the collar, hustled him into the house, placed a police man inside the door, and led the way into ? the former sanctum of the 'Great Seer.' All the trumpery decorations were gone; but the Irishman paled visibly when I stood tip on a chair and pulled out several tacks and nails, with scraps of the thin cloth yrhfch. had draped $9 rooift ati^ fl^eriug, 'You had better* speak,' I advised, as he sank into a seat, and I secured his wrists. 'It will save you a lot of trouble, and shorten your own term considerably. Where's he gone to ?' 'I don't know, but I think it's New castle. They're only to be gone a week. He sent me for a cab to take him down to the boat, 'cause there was another man ?with him who was speechless drunk.' I looked at my watch. 'If the boat started punctually, it is gone now,' I said. ' But there is a chance. I -will take a cab down. You must go up to the Office. You say the other man was drunk. Did he not look more like he was ill — drugged, for instance ?' 'He did. Til tell the truth— he was drugged.' « How ? When ?' ' I don't know — he did it. He sent me up to bring Mm down — but I met him on the stairs. I left them together, and some time after they came here— only the one was speechless. He was young and hand some, and dressed out for a party.' I caught all this whi]e they were locking up the house, and then I ran down the stair, out at the bottom of the close, and over to the railway cab stance. ' To Leith ! I'll make you a present of half-a-erown above your fare if you catch the Newcastle steamer,' I cried, and then I was rattling off like the wind. I did not exactly catch the steamer, but I got it to stop and put back ; and then, hurrying below, I found the two men I sought — the one almost unconscious, retch ing violently, and looking ghastly white, and the other — the Professor, the man woman — keeping a strict watch over his movements. The poor bridegroom did not even recognise his friend, the ' best man,' who had accompanied me; but the other seemed to scent danger the moment I addressed him. 'It's all up, Rennie,'. was all I said; and then, with a muttered curse, he sub mitted to have his /wrist fastened to my own. His 'props,' or fortune-telling gear, were secured' in two hampers, and these I took on shore with me; and then the steamer went on its way, minus two passengers. ...*.???-.-? '.' ''. Wedrove up to Edinburgh, after calling at the Leith Police Station to doctor the poor bridgegroom a little; and the wild delight of the meeting of the young wife with her recovered husband is simply beyond my powers of description. I went awaf to lock up my prisoner, but not be fore*! had received an invitation to return at the' earliest moment and partake in the joyous festivities. I made a kind of evasive promise to comply, but it was no use— they were up at me before the day was over, and carried me off bodily. I don't know what they did to me, but I know that it was something little short of worship. In their simplicity, they looked on what I had done as something wonderful, and, as a kind of king, I reigned supreme. I remember helping them to sing ' Auld Langsyne,' and that two of the verses, hastily extem porised by one of the gentlemen, had sole reference to the one engrossing topic. John fiennie alias 'Professor Schom bxiig' alias 'The Great Seer,' for his in genious and revengeful practices, got three years. His accomplice got off with nine months. Mrs. Hill nee Jane Hannah set the prophecy at complete defiance, by becoming the mother of six or seven rosy children ; but I am still inclined to agree with her when she says, 'It miff /it have been different.'' ? * ?
