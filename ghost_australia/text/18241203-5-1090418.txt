NIGHT. Night is the time for rest, How sweet when labours close, To gather round an aching breast The curtain of repose––– Stretch the tired limbs, and lay the head Upon our own delightful bed ! Night is the time for dreams The gay romance of life, When truth that is, and truth that seems Blend in fantastic strife, Ah ! visions less beguiling far Than waking dreams by daylight are ! Night is the time for toil To plough the classic field : Intent to find find the buried spoil its wealthy furrows yield ; Till all is our's that ages taught, That poets sang, or heroes wrought! Night is the time to weep To wet with unseen tears Those graves of memory, where sleep The joys of other years; Hopes that were angels in their birth, But finish'd young, like things of earth ! Night is the time to watch - On ocean's dark expanse, To hail the pleiades or catch The full Moon's earliest glance, That brings into the home sick mind All we have lov'd and left behind? Night is the time for care, Brooding on hours mispent, To see the spectre of despair Come to our lonely tent ; Like Brutus, 'midst his slumb'ing host, Startled by Caesar's stalwart ghost. Night is the time to muse Then from the eye the soul Takes flight and with expanding views, Beyond the starry pole, Describes athwart the abyss of night The dawn of uncreated light? Night is the time to pray ; OUR SAVIOUR oft withdrew To desert mountains far away; $o will his followers do - Steal from the throng to haunts untrod And hold communion there with GOD! Night is the time for death, When all around is peace, Calmly to yield the weary breath, From sin and suffering cease : Think of Heaven's bliss and give the sign To parting friends-such death he mine !
