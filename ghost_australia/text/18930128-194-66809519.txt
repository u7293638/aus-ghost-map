THE GREAT BUS . BY TELEMACHUS " Daddy's dead! " "Daddy who ?" "Sling the wirc." "Go to—— " Thus the news was given and received, and Jem Johnson meant no blasphemy nor unbelief, nor even disrespect by his strange expletive. That Sling the Wire should be dead was to him a fact so utterly strange and amazing he could not express himself in any ordinary terms. Or rather, perhaps, he let his soul out in the first words that came to his lips. " Last night said the other fellow," in the sheepwash hut." There now ?'" Yes," Then we both dismounted and entered the hut. — a long slab table down the centre, a double row of bunks on either side. Beyond, a bit of a cookshop, and on a bread table there, whereon the cook had often hewed sheep into chops and moulded his mighty loaves, a something beneath a blue blanket. There was nothing irreverent about Jem as he bared his head, stepped softly and pulled the blanket away. Then we saw "Sling the Wire"—all that was left of him. It was not much; about five feet two of the oldest seeming humanity eyes ever beheld. Flesh all gone, teeth all gone, eye- [lids s]hut over sockets from which the eyes [were] torn or worn away.

He was old as history—no man knew how old. He had the haziest notions on the subject him- self. I should think that he must have overpassed four scoree and ten, for he seemed clearly to know of the time when the Blue Mountains shut in the infant colony, and all the inner land were peopled and pictured by fancy alone. I met him first—it was early in the eighties—by a gate in fence where the so far unmistakeable track bifurcated. He looked terribly old then, and fearfully and wonder- fully dirty. He had the same old dead wool mat of hair about lips and chin, the same tangled elf locks hanging down on the same old coat. When he lifted his marvellous cabbage tree he displayed a dirt-caked poll and a face whose innumerable wrinkles were filled with the dust of the plains accurately as those of any ancient dame of fashion with enamel or pearl powder. The dirty condition would not have occasioned sur- prise, it is very common amongst old [ many lines missing ] formation, to satisfy curiosity, or to build up new life there is nothing like a spell in a surveyor's camp. Get a friend to put you on his staff as a workman and—work. Drag the chain, blaze trees, make and drive pegs, learn to pitch and strike a tent, and on Sundays and holidays rattle away to the nearest township, and prove the truth of the old Horatian proverb "Dulce est desipere in loco. " Learn how rising suns and moons appear when they come over an eastern bar un- broken as on a placid sea, and if it be in you when the stars shine out at night, and the world is very still, get to yourself a little of the sentiment which Ernest Favene, poet and explorer, knew when he wrote his exquisite verses to the genius of Australias' solitudes. But this is not "Sling the Wire." I was sitting on a pine log smoking one night, a hundred yards from thie camp, when, sud- denly came, " Good day,"and there, leaning on his stick was the little old man. "You slung that wire all right ?" "Oh yes." " I want a pot of tea." "Go down to the cook then." " That's my wire." I followed down an hour later, the evening was cold and calm, and bright. Dry pine logs had been thrown on the solid fire of box, which burned always from the pitching to the striking of the camp, and a ruddy blaze leapt high. The white tents showed clearly, the trees a little beyond them were intensely black. The bronzed- bearded hardy fellows lying about seemed grouped for an artist, but bolt upright on, a water-keg sat the little old man, and beside him on his swag, his head bowed to his knees, an old traveller. Sling-the-Wire was reciting a "some- thing" which will not be found in any of the books. If memory would serve one could not print the whole of it, and indeed it was mostly rubbish, though at times so bitter and vigorous as to show the working of a powerful mind. It was the ryhmed story of a " Prisoner's tour to Hell." " This hero's valor had been tried Upon the highway before he died. At length to death he fell a prey, Which proved to him a happy day. Downward he bent his steps untold Until he came to Satan's fold." Satan, of course, would have none of him. He was a man to be comforted, not tor- mented, and so was sent on the upward track. Having arrived at the gate he "Knocked so loud upon the wicket That Peter cried, Come, where's your ticket?" The old man on the swag looked up with a cunning leer. " Ah, If he hadn't that he was crooked !" "Yes," said the narrator,- "he'd slung a wrong wire then," and proceeded— "Or if you've got none to show Is there anybody here you know ?" The gentleman admitted that he knew— Johnny Troy, and Wilkins, too, Old Ben, and bold Jack Donohue, And many more, whose backs were mangled, And whom Long Tom, the hangman, strangled.

" What's the matter with them ?" " If you'd slung your wire like that along with the Major, sonny, you'd have had fifty for breakfast every morning. " "Who was the Major?" "Ah! you didn't know him; I did." (And he seemed to curl his shoulders as he spoke.) "I done twelve months with the Major, cook's mate." Who wrote the verses you were spouting the other night ?" "Ah ! that was Frank, the poet. Frank Macnamara's wire that was." "You've been a long time in the world, Daddy ?" . " Yes," and he sucked hard at an empty pipe. A plug of tobacco accompanied the question: " When did you come out? " "Dunno. I slung my wire first in Lunnon. All smart men slings their wire fust in Lunnon. King George was Governor then, and his wire was to send smart men to Port Jackson. Some of the others said Port Phillip, but King George, his wire vas Port Jackson. I come to Port Jackson." " What year ?" "Dunno. But it was afore Governor Macquarie. He built the Rum Hospital, and I carried bricks." " Where did you work first?" "The first man had me was a farmer near the old parson's place, at Parramatta. Par- son used to preach on Sundays and flog on Mondays. Tuesdays hed go down the river fishing—I've pulled him." This was fragmentary and I soon found that only a few isolated peaks and capes stood out through the haze of his memory of that old period. He crossed the mountains with the third party. He thought it was the third party, and "slung his wire" in Mudgee country with Captain Deane. "Oh ! it was ''Country fit for a man to be in then; grass as big as salt bush and [ line missing ] xxx lazy life hutkeeping ?" " You ever sling your wire at hutkeep- ing ?" "No" "And you can't put a straight blaze on a tree. Shall I give you the wire about ful hutkeeping ?" "Yes." A hutkeeper's wire them times was to watch five of 'em. The sheep, and the shep- herd, the dingos,an' the blacks, and the boss. Sometimes one was the worst, sometimes another. He had to cook the shepherds tucker in the morning. leastways to boil the billy, for we didn't use to cook more'n once week then. He had to hump all the hurdles, and fix 'em on a clean camp; then to wheel the dog box along. The dog box was a hut on wheels; both of you camped there, and the hutkeeper had to to watch the sheep til morning. P'r'aps he didn't keep awake all night, but if the dingoes got into the yard, or the blacks speared the sheep, he slung a bad wire and was crooked with the boss. " What then?"

P He had never seen the railway, scarcely a believed in its existence, for all news came to U him by travellers, and all travellers to him r were liars. s In yet another Spring I saw him again. n A cold had crept into his old lungs, and sat ie down there. All his bones seemed to rattle se ashe coughed, and you might well imagine nose and chml would presenitly knock to gether. He had crawled from the home it station to the camp in a mortal a- terror, for "the boss," "the manager of il the station," had proposed to send te him into hospital. He could notd:sassociate of the ideas of hospital and gaol. It meant Id confinement and restraint. It came over he him with an indefinable horror. As soon as it~ was dark he "slung his wire" straieht as out for the bush, and when the cold came a on him he saw the light of the camp 1- fires and made down to them. He 'lay g there when the cook turned out, and "'Doctr:'," said he to totltecook, "you speak a eood word for me to your boss and let me fay alongside the fire at night, and I'llsling my wire into the scrob on the ridge at day light, or, may be, he'd give me a jobpoint isg pego.

OldDad came no later, shiver a ingfearfully, and was hardly steadied by a tI half- pannikin ot rum. He certainly would un have died had any attempt been made to re ed move hlm to the township. "I'dslingmy or wire there," said he, "if they'd let me eg camp onne plcec" on" Where's that ." Id "That's Billy Samson's dead house." " Where thley put the drunks and dead he- beats ?" he "Jess so. I'd findtravellers there, and I could pitch and give them the wire where iotto makefor; and Billy, he wouldn't see me as short of a bit of damper. I'laling my wire ter downto Billy's." o " You'll die on the road." of "What for'!" It was a hard question, and remained unanswered. After a moment's silence, he spoke again, brightening. "I'll leave Billy this turn. There's old Sam up the river be's got a tree with room in it for two. Ill sling my wre to Sam', m and we'll. doss together. An' old King or- Jerry, he'll get us 'possums if Sam can't srd ketch fish." "Stay with the cook till to- morrow,"said the boss, and that evening we both went ssr down to the home station. The manager feltnothing but kindness for uP, poor, old Dad, but he was bad, and the 't hospital seemed the only place for him. "I should be blackguarded by every go rag of a newspaper min Riverina it I let him die in the hut," said he, "though God knows he's welcome tothem all.
