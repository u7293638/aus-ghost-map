1\lisc^ikiieousr' A GHOST IN FIJI. We are assured, that pojmtn oap^vtiji by taking any amount'of thought, add one cubit to his stature : yet we are ac quainted with an: individual who, being intensely dissatisfied with tho fivafoot iiothing-and-a-half of verticularity grud ingly bestowed upon him by niggardly nature, does give the addition of inches thereto » very oon^iderable, -prrtportion-pf thought jwbioJi finds its outlet in the -fur- chase of the tallest of tall Yankee bate, the highest of high- heeled New Tork ?pedal encasements and aofortb, ? and -who lutely went a step further and broke ont into stilts. The stilt exercise necessarily suggested the idea of the supernatural, and the thought occurred ' Won't it be jolly to scare the life out of the niggers by doing the ghost dodge.' This he ac cordingly tried ; and, between tall hut, high stilts and the usual white sheet ac companiment, the figure that stalked out of the surrounding gloom into the circle of firelight, enlivened by the presence of upwards of twenty superstitious Fijians, was unearthly enough for all European notions of the ghostly character. But, whether the traditional timoni (spirit) of Fy'i differs materially from _ the supers titious creation of the Caucasian brain, or some one had prepared the intended victims of the intention of the gentleman doing the post-mortem role of Hamlet's father, the result was anything but that expected. With a yell that had little in it of fright each man sprang iuto a closely adjacent breadfruit grove ; and, with the fallen ;l.'d decayed fruit, treated the ghostly visitant to so warm a salvo as never poor disembodied spirit before en countered. To get off the stilts so swathed up was impossible ; to escape by flight was equally hopeless ; and, if any reliance can be placed on his word rotten bread fruit is not a pleasant dressing material, while green ones hit particularly hard. You could uot induce that man to talk about ghqste ou stilts just now on any consideration ; but he will grow eloquent for :tn hour on the subject of what splen did marksmen Fijians are, especially with vegetable ampiuiiition and a timoni vdka pap dagi (white mail's ghost) for a pot shot.— Fiji Tim's.
