\--•SCIENCE AND ART JOTTINGS. f> PHOTOSEAPHS have lately been taken of "- vjShe two interesting old astronomical instru- '/^ments. at the Pekin Observatory. These ^itistruiiients are the most ancient of the ;kiri&\- in the -world, having been made by order of the Emperor Kublai Khan in the TOar l279. They axe exquisite pieces of ^.bronze work, and are in splendid condition, iaaifhough they have been exposed to tlie -'We&tiker; for more than six hundred years. ;3)TT. WILHELMI, of Giistrow, Germany, teSngly ^ecommenrls that in cases of lead toisoning a small quantity of blood should Itetakenfrom the arm. He has practiced Ifcis. treatment in twenty-five cases, and £j)eaJc8 warmly-of the success he has met •with, the patients in some cases expressing themselves as greatly relieved immediately after theoperation, and the affection taking a marked change for the better from that time. WHAT is called "the ice-bag treatment" of internal hemorrhage, pneumonia, and various other ailments, has come into considerable" Vogue' on the continent of Europe and has been introduced into England. It consists in laying an impervious • bag filled'isvithpounded ice upon the lun and other affected parts. Eminent English physiciansoppose the practice on the -.ground that roe " chill induced by the icebag weakens tlie vitality of the parts to "which it is applied, and retards instead of ' accelerating: the'recovery of the patient. THE AbbS ifollet has always been claimed by the French as the precursor of Franklin' in the discovery of electricity. And now a book lias b§en found in Italy, written by a Venetian? doctor, Eusebio Ignario, and published id}1746, two years before the discoveries isf iibbe No]let, of which' the title is "Elect)|city, ..or the Electric Force of Bodies?* ^contains facts extremely curious for the epbch it belongs to, and on thunder is this^li|j5acteristic paragraph: "What fatal "surprisejaw'a its the first experimenter who. haviii^ foiiiid the means of artificially producing lightning, will succumb a victim of his owneuriosity." APPLES have enthusiastic advocates. One tbssa, writing for the Country Gentleman, Ifcji not claimed for tiie apple that incomplete-food in itself, but on the . food list ifpossesses a value far above the nutrients it furnishes. Apples aid the stomach, ib the digestion of otlier foods, • and,~therefore, the best results are obtained from eating them after, rather than before, . meals. If one feels that he has eaten more dinner than is compatible with his after comfort,-he will find that an apple will facilitate 'tai «ariy. digestion and afford greater relief th'an'an alcoholic drink or a drug-store prescription." ' IN the Pacific Coast region there are now •four.vilourisbing colonies of introduced /pheasant^. "The most northerly of these .-colonies' is' at the ^south end of "Vancouver Island,-near - Victoria; the second in Protection Island in Puget Sound; the third at the junction of the Willamette River with . the Columbia ;and the fourth in the middle f portion of the Willamette Valley. The two -'-fetter colonies are now separated by so narrow a strip of territory that they will .doubtless become united during the next " few years. -All the pheasants-of the three •*, colomies last mentioned have been imported t from"China by Judge O.
