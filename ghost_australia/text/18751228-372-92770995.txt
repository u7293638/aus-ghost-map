LABRIB3NISM. 1 fTo the ^Editor of the Northern Aram.'] i Sir—I make it a matter of duty always to read your paper right through till I get among the medicines in the last page—but as I prescribe for myself I take no interest in that part. I find, however, that theie is an occasional paragraph about the larrikins, and 1 think you and others are a little bit out of your reckoning when you hint that the mischief is done by a few of the men in the town. Would you believe me if I were to tell you that females may possibly have a hand in such doings ? Why, Sir, do you not remember when the people residing in the neighborhood of the Old Police Station j were actually frightened from the {dace by the nightly wanderings of what was sup posed to be a ghost, but what afterwards turned out to be a veritable female ? Or have you forgotten about the tailor's horse that had its fine tail cut one night, a portion of which was afterwards found on the head of a female, thus supplying a defect of nature ? The gentlemen had nothing to do with that little, job. I might mention other cases, but it is not necessary. If Foot-con stable Waters would have an eye on the females lie might drop upon his prey. What is to. hinder them from letting out a few pigs, or removing a few pot plants from windows to the middle of the street ? Y6u must not alwavs blame the men. I am, Sir, &c.;, Ruth.
