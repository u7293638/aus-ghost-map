CHAPTER XXIX. THE FIB8T SUNDAY IN HAMPSTEAD. There was a great crowd at church that first Sun- day after Mrs Schuvler's arrival m town Perhaps it was the brightness of the day and perhaps it was an unconfessed desire to see the bride, of whose per- sonal appearance so many conflicting rumours were afloat I had seen her, but I was earl} at church ID my se»t by the organ, unaccountably nervous and excited when I knew that the Scbu}ler cnrnage had stopped at the door and that I should soon see again the beautiful woman who had interested me BO greatly The Mornsses, and Beechers, and Mont- gomerys, and Bartons from the Ridge, and indeed all the great families of the neighbourhood were already in their seats, and had said their prayers, and found their places, aud arranged themselves comfortably and becomingly when the Schu}lers came filing m, the colonel and his bride, with God fre} and the } oung ladies, following after Edith's diess was very plain and simple, a neb black silk, with some kind of a. gauz} white scarf around ber shoulders and a whito chip bonnet, with laca and blue ribbons, that waa all There was no attempt at display, no hint of a costly wardrobe in her toilet, and yet the verdict of eveiy one was, " How ele- gant," as with eyes cast down and a flush on her fan cheek she walked up the aisle and took her seat in the Schuyler pew, where Lady Emilly bad sat before her There was perfect silence during the moment she was on her knees, but when she rose and threw a swift, curious glance about her we re- covered ourselves and were ready for the " dearly beloved," which I doubt if Edith heard, though she rose to her feet and let our village dressmaker, who sat behind, sea just how the back of her skirt was trimmed Edith was not thinking of the solemn service in which she joined involuntarily, nor of the many eyes turned upon her, but of the Sunda} a years ago, when she was a worshipper in that same house, though not in that pew, crimson-cushioned and velvet carpeted, but in the humbler seat farther back, where now by some strange chance little Gertie sat, her blue eyes fixed upon the bride, and her face wearing an expression of perfect content as if she understood the general impression the beautiful lady had made. Miss Rossiter was not there She had told Mrs Barton not to expect her It would be too great a strain upon her nerves to see that doll m Emily's plice, with eveiybody looking at her, and some ad- miring her, us no doubt they would She culled her " a doll," and i^rs Barton was prepared for a pink and white expressionless creature, with some claims to being prett}, and an unmistakable lower class air about her, but she was not prepared for this superb beauty, who took her breatb awa}, and made her mentally revoke her promise not to call or notice her in any way It would not do to slight that woman, who would lead Hampstead, and New York, too, if she tried, and Mrs Barton did not propose to do it She would rather run the riBk of offending Miss Rossiter, and when at last church was out, and they were waiting for the carnages outside the door, she managed to got introduced, and presented her daughter Rosamond, who, for the remainder of the day, raved about the beauty and grace and Btyle of Mrs Schuyler Little Gertie half stopped as if to claim acquaintance, but Mary Rogers led her awav, and I saw the child look back several times at the lady to whom she had not }et spoken, but whom she was to meet that very day at the grave of Abelard Lyle Godfrey had said to her, " I muet go to the grave to morrow after dinner," and as she wished to see that all waa right, to water the flowers and root up any strange weed that might have come to sight since her last visit, she resolved to be there before him and enjoy his surprise She knew dinner at Schuyler Hill was served at two o'clock on Sunda} s, and as Godfrey was not likely to get out before three she had plenty of time, and after her own early dinner started for the cemeter} There was not much to be done, for the grave was like a pretty flower bed, and after pulling a weed or two, and digging around a heliotrope, she sat down to rest upon the broad marble at the foot of the monument Gertie was rather tired, and the day was warm and Godfrey long in coming, and at last she fell asleep with her head against the marble, and did not hear the sound of footsteps on the grassy path which led across the lawn to the yard Some one was coming, but it was not Godfrey He was sitting with Alice upon the balcony and ask mg her if she expected a new pupil at the Mission that afternoon, and if she'd like him to go with her Colonel Schuyler was taking his Sunday nap in his e^sy chair and thus left to herself Edith had resolved upon a visit to the grave, towardB which she had looked so many times since her arnval at Schu}ler Hill She had seen me at church that morning, and recognized me by the name which Godfre} gave me when he shook my hand standing very near to me There had been a quick turn of her eyes toward me, but what she thought of the thin dark woman whom she had left a girl of thirteen, I do not know' Possibly, however, she remembered my promise with regard to Abelard s grave, and seizing her first opportunity went to see how that promise bad been kept. Only once before had she ever been in that yard, and that was when she planted the rosebush which now twined about the monument and made a screen from the sun for the little girl sleeping so sweetly, with her bright hair falling like a silken veil around her face, and her dimpled hands folded on her lap And thus Edith first saw her distinctly, asleep on the grave of Abelard Ljle, his monument her pillow and the rosa tree which grew above him her shade How beautiful she was, and Edith paused a moment to look at her, wondenng who »he was, and then concluding from the hair that it must be Gertie Westbrooke, who had thrown her the bouquet Entering the little yard she went close up to the grave, marvelling to find it in such perfect order, and feeling a sense of suffocation, when she saw the very vase she had given Ettie Armstrong standing there full of freshly gathered flowers, which seemed to speak to her so plainly from the dead Who had done this, as if in welcome to her ? Was there any one in Hampstead who suspected her identity ? " Impossible," »he said to herself, as she sat down upon the iron chair which stood near to the grave " There was no look of recognition on Ettie Arm- strong's face, and she alone knew of my love for Abelard It is very strange, and this child here too asleep What a beautiful face she has, and who is it »he resembles ?" Edith thought, as she marked the regular features, the transparent complexion, the long silken lashes and the glossy auburn hair of the unconscious child How plump and pretty were the dimpled hands which lay, one on her lap, and the other on the green sward beside her, where it had fallen m the aban- donment of sleep How small, too, and perfectly formed were the little feet Edith wondered to see them encased in such dainty boots, just as she wondered at the whole appearance of the child who interested and fascinated her so much " I wish she would awake I'd like to talk with her," she thought, and as ff the wish bad com- municated itself to Gertie, the long lashes lifted slowlj, disclosing a pair of eyes so bnght and blue and lovely m their expression that Edith half started up and thought, with a pang, of eyes she bad seen j ears ago, but which now were closed for ever and laid away beneath the turf at her very feet Gertie was quite awake no», and a sweet smile broke ovei her face and showed itself in her very eyes when she saw who was with her " Oh, Mrs Schuj 1er," she said, advancing at once and without the least timidity towards the lady " Oh, Mrs. Schuyler, it's you. I was waiting for Godfrey and went to sleep and had such a nice dream of mother, who was alive, I thought, and father too " She was standing close to Edith, who, reaching out her hand, took Gertie's m il, and forgetting that Mrs Rogers was not the child's own mother, said, in some surprise " Your mother 1« not dead '" ' Yes, she is," Gertie replied. " She died when I was a little tiny girl, and father married again and Auntie Rogers took me away and then father died, too, >n Italy Is not Mr Godfrey coming to see the grave ? hesaid he would jesterday " She was more intent on Godfrey than on her parentage, and, at her mention of the grave, Edith asked quickly " What grave is Godfrey coming to see ?" " This one," and Gertie pomted to the flower bed where the vase was standing " You see ' she con- tinued, " this is Mr Lyle's grave-Mr James A Lyle, who died in saving Mr, Godfrey's ljfe He was working on the tower of the house at Schuyler Hill, and Mr Godfrey was a little boj, and climbed up and slipped, and Mr Lyle caught him, and threw him where he was safe, but fell himself down-down -down-to the very earth, where he was smashed all to bits, and they took him up as dead as dead could be " Gertie was very eloquent and earnest, and empha- sized her " down-down-down" with a wave of her hand in the air and a stamp of her foot upon the ground, while Edith, who could not speak for the I unseen Angers at her throat, sat gazing at her, motionless and completely fascinated by her face, 1 and manner, and voice, which last had in it the nng of something familiar-something heard years ago, when she was young and listened to the bell in the old church-tower ringing on a Sunday morning. Abelard used to come to her then, and walk with her to church, and the girl's voice reminded her of those days, and sent a thnll through every nerve. When she could speak, she asked "How did j ou learn all this, and who keeps the grave so nicely ?" "I do, for you see Miss Armstrong-that's my teacher, she was at church to-day, and play» the organ-she came here with me one time, and, when I asked about the graves, she told me whose they were-that is, the newest ones That great, tall stone is the first Mrs. Schuyler, but you don't care for that. She was not half as pretty as you, they say, and so he had to get her this grand stone, which cost two or three thousand dollars. I dote on graves, and like to hear about them, and Mia» Armstrong told me about this poor boy, or man he mus.t have been, for he waa a young girl'» beau, I guess" " A what ?" Edith gasped. And Gertie went on : " There was a "beautiful young girl here then, from England-Heloise Fordham, that's her name1-and she liked Mr. Lyle, and he liked har, and »he cried so when ha waa lolled, and had a dreadful headache ; and whsn ehe went away, »be made Miss Armstrong prom se to keep up the grave till she came back to see it, and to wate- the rosebush when sh« went out, and to keep the vase full of flowers in the summer time And Miss Armstrong did water the rose see how it has grown 1" and Gertie pointed to the climbing rose twined around the monument as she went on " For a while she tended the grave, hop- ing to hear from the girl, or that she would come, but she never did, and so at last she gTew öred-like and careless, and when she told me about it that da), it was a sight to see for weeds I like to dig and work m the dirt and so I made it nice, thinking Godfrey would be pleased, and then, too, do you know, I do it part for the girl, Heloise, who lived in the very house where I live now, and »lept m my very room And the poor man was earned there, and his coffin and funeral were m the great room, but I never told auntie, because she ii afraid of ghosts I am not, though, and I like to think about him and her, and to make believe she is there with me, crj mg by the wiudow for the lover dead down stairs, and once-it's funny, but it wa» the night j ou came-I lay awake ever so long, and fancied she was there, and, before I knew it, said right out aloud, ' Poor Heloise, Gerrie is sorry for you ' " " Oh, child, child, hush, hush !" Edith cried, a» she drew Gertie to her and pressed her close to her side " Whj is it wicked ? Was it naughty to make believe she was there and talk to her?" Gertie asked, wondenngly, and Edith replied " No, no, not that, talk to her, pity h»r, pray for her all j ou please, and tell me, has nothing been heard oi her since she went away ?" 'Nothing, I guess, and Miss Armstrong said maybe she s dead or marned I do not like to think her dead I'd rather believe her married and alive. Don't j ou suppose she is ?" " Yes, yes, I believe she ii marned , and I know »he would be so grateful to jou and love you sa much if »he knew what care you take of the grave, Gertie " and obeying an impulse she could not reiitt Edith smoothed tbe bnght hair back from the fair white forehead, and looking straight into the clear, blue eyes, kissed the child, whose lips kiBaed back again and sent a strange tremor through everj nerve of Edith's body ' Had jou heard of this grave before?" Gertie mked, puzzled a little at the lady's manner, and Edith replied ' 'les, Godfrey told me of it in England, and Colonel Schu) 1er, too, and on our bridal tour we went to see his mother, Ab-Mr Lyle's, I mean," and m a low tone of voice Edith told the listening child of the white haired, sweet-faced old woman knitting m the sunshine by the door of that thatched cottage among the heather hill» " I promised to to write to her," she added, " and tell her about the grave, and perhaps you will press me soma flower» which grew here and I'll send them in the letter?" ' Oh, yes I'd like to do that,' Gertie said, and in a moment her nimble fingers had gathered the few flowers still in blossom,'and which were destined for that home beyond the sea where Abelard once lived " 1 pity that old lady so much, and like her too , seems so much like my grandma, though I don't know where she is Auntie never told ma " " Yuu have one, then ?" Edith asked, and Gertie told her all she knew of herself, not forgetting the forty pounds a year which wa» to pay for her edu- cation, for she meant to be a teacher like Mu» Arm- strong, and play the organ, maybe, when Miss Arm- strong was too old How interested Edith was in this little girl who puzzled, and confused, and bewildered her so, tiny were getting acquainted with each other rapidly, when a man's step sounded in the distance, and turn- ing quick]j, while a look of eager joy lighted up her face, Gertie cried " It is Mr Godfrey, I guess " But Mr Godfrey was still doing duty at Alie»'» side, and the newcomer was no other than Robert Macpherson, who was coming directly towards the cemetery, which he reached before he discovered its occupants Then, with a start and a blush, a» if detected in something he would hide, he lifted his hat to Mrs Schuyler and went forward to greet her. " And here is Gertie too," he said, as he offered her his hand , then turning again to Edith he »aid he had just come from New York in the train which paesed a few moments ago " Came from New York to-day ! Why, Mr Mac- pherson, it's Sunday '" Gertie exclaimed, while Edith smiled, and Mr Macpherson looked amused as he explained to the child, who behaved in the fourth commandment " Yes, Gertie, I know it is Sunday, and that I should hive waited till to morrow, inasmuch as there was nothing more pressing than homesickness, for to tell the truth I was homesick in the city, and after church this morning-I went to Trinity-there came over me such a longing for the country and a familiar face that I resolved to take the very first tram for Hamp- stead, and did so That is why I am here on Sunday, little Puritan," and he smiled so good-humoredly at Gertie, thinking what a wonderful face she had, and how like she was to the Bister sleeping under the English skies and then he glanced at the well-kept grave and at the monument and the name upon it ' James A Lyle," and said aloud, in an absent kind of way ' Bom m Alnwick " " He saved Godfrey's life, you know, and lo»t his own,' Gertie explained, while Mr. Macpherson bowed and simplj answered " Yes, I know," but gave no sign that when on reaching the brow of the hill on his way from the station he saw the white headstones gleaming in the distance, he came that way to see for himself this very grave of Abelard Lyle, who was bom at Aln- wick. Shall we go to the house? Godfrey will be glad to know j ou are here," Edith said, and as ah« spoke, something m the expression of her face made Robert glance quickly from her to Gertie, who was tjing on her bonnet " 1 hey certainly are alike," he thought "They would do splendidly m a picture as 'Les Sours ' and then, as Edith was ready, he walked by her side with Gertie in attendance, until they reached the place where their paths diverged, and then Gertie said, " good by," while Edith and Robert went leisurely toward the house
