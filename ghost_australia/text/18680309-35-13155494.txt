The weapon itself multiplies their power in proportion. Such weapons aie i endered more formidable, since they can be only wielded by hands trained to absolute submission. A. Russian army furnished with the Chassepot rifle, moving on under the highest scientific direction, and capable of that dogged endurance which such forces show, requires only the animating prospect of plunder and conquest. Every mecha- nical improvement in the implements of war becomes a new force to those who have a boundless command of men. liussia is pre citely in that stage of civilisation when the heart knows no pity, and when a wild and ruthless spirit is generated by the love of spoil. It is commonly said, indeed, that the destructive character of the Aveapons of Avar Avili diminish war by rendering its continuance impossible ; that the slaughter will be so great as to intimidate the proudest and most callous spirit. We should be glad to think that this is true. There is but little reason to hope that such Avili be the result excepting by the absolute subjection of the vanquished, and by the absorption of the smaller into the great empires of the world. What conqueror ever Avas arrested by the sorrows which he inflicted ? By a philosophy of his own, and by marking out some object of laudable ambition as the ultimate purpose of war, he satisfies himself that he is the saviour of society as well as the sword of GOD. The Macedonian conqueror is said to haA-e Avept because there were no more worlds to conquer. The excitement of battle and the hope of victory were the hope and stimulus of life. Looking aside, hoAYevcr, from these gloomy vieAvs, there is some mitigation. If shot is to be delivered at so great a rate it must be brought into the field in equal proportions, and be a weight upon the soldier. It Avas formerly con- sidered that every man killed in battle cost a CAVÍ, of lead ; or, as it has been put otherwise, the weight of a man Avas required to kill a man. The rifle shot Avili not be so cumbersome, but there may be limits to the power of providing and conA'eying it in sufficient time to be useful. It is the idea of many that this cause alone will limit the application of this new arm. But may it not also be possible that new means of defence will be provided to compensate for this danger ? A shot deliA'ered from a distance can be resisted by a comparatively light defence. The protection of men engaged in war must be- come far more important than under a different system, because it will be impossible to calculate on any human courage meeting certain death. It is possible therefore that new armo'ur will be worn, or that some of those contrivances known in ancient sieges will cover the warrior. The famous Macedonian phalanx provided an iron roof for the soldier. The shields joined toge- ther by the moving troop warded off the missiles directed against them. Something of this kind will certainly be sought as a check to the deadly efficacy of these neAV weapons. Although the penetrating power of modern ammunition is greater than the force of Aveapons cast in ancient times, still it may not be difficult to repel an ordinary shot if the quarters be not close. For many years past there have been rao mises and predictions of universal peace. Its achievements indeed have been great in many directions, and, \ipon the whole, mankind has hitherto enwmousl) gairvp(1 b> llie discovery and application erf science. 1^s increased produc- tion through its agency ha» iVen far larSet tnan the destiuction. Ahvaya io hopC for tlie best ii, perhaps, to diaxv the largest revere from life. Still it is a fact that after a grand 4»eace Çon gtess we have commonly had a great iW»- Hie message that fiist flew along the Atlantic cable -" Feace on earth "-was folloxved by a wai more bitter in its charactei than any here tofoie known to the Anglo-Saxon race. The assurances of peace which i cached us by our last mail from Euiope, and endotsed by the strong language of the EMPEROR, have given promise of repose afeer the terrible conflicts of continental nations. We are not, hoyvever, strongly impiessed xvith the value of these piomises of peace. We aie some consideiable distance from the epoch when the undisputed masteiy of nations will be given to some pre- dominating Powei, and when the same causes that stopped the careel of ALEXANDBH, OI anested the ambition of the Roman Empne, will îeduce the xvarlike spirit and delixer the human lace to the Causais 01 the Antonines.

But if the ship- ment of meat under any preserving process should become a great trade and the A'alue of pastoral properties should rise again, the flow of capital would be stimulated by the improve- ment in the security squatters are able to offer. If there is such a market for the meat of sheep and cattle, and for wool and hides as to make the multiplication of stock a profitable pursuit, it is clear that capital can be produc- tively employed in fencing and in storing water. Although a large portion of the surface of Aus-, tralia may be utilised in its natural state, and without any appreciable expenditure on im- provements, it has been abundantly proved that the receipts from improved land repay the cost of judicious improvements. With the country enclosed and Avith as much artifi- cial Avater supply as will suffice for all the stock I the enclosures can carry, the quantity and quality of the pastoral produce Avili be enor- mously enhanced. There is wide scope, Shere fore, for the investment of the capital necessary to bring about such a result, and these is a reasonable probability that the capital so in- vested Avili more than repay its interest. A good deal of the money, however, that has been borrowed on squattages has been u«ed not for the purpose ot improvement but for the speculative purchase of adjacent runs, or for tho acquisition of such blocks of freehold land as Avould command large areas of pasturage. It is in many of these cases that debt has proved a heaAy incumbrance, a^id in some cases it has been absolute ruin.

JOHN'S, BISHOPTHORPE - On Saturday evening, at half past 7 o'clock, the gentlemen of the choir of St. James's, Christ Church, St Mark's, and St Paul's - who are to take part in the ceremonies at the laying of the foun- dation stone of St. John's, Bishopthorpe, by his Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, on Monday, the 16th instant - assembled at Christ Church Schoolroom for practice. Mr. S. T. Ward of Christ Church, acted as choirmaster, and Mr. James Furley, the organist at St. James, presided at the harmonium. The Rev. Mr. Kemmis, of St. Mark's, and the Rev. E. M. Saliniere (the parish clergyman of St. John's) were present, both taking an active interest in the proceedings. The number of the four united choirs was twenty-one men and twenty-four boys, all, it is needless to say, practically ac- quainted with the principles of music, and good vocalists. It was a very pleasing, and animated scene to witness the earnestness and precision with which they executed several pieces of Anglican music, and especially the deservedly popular Te Deum, of Jackson, with which all churchmen are so familiar. In spite of an occasional variation of accent, or time (arising, doubtless, out of some difference in parochial use), a uniform and most effective rendering was given to the grand old hymn of St. Ambrose, a like success being more easily attained in the processional hymn, "Jerusalem, the Golden," allowed to be one of the most beautiful hymns in the English language. The choirs are to meet again for fur- ther practice at the same place and hour on Tuesday and Saturday next. Several gentlemen of the highest musical attainments belong to these choirs, the union of which cannot fail of being productive of a great musical success.
