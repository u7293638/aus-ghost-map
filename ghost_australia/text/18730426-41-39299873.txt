Enigma, by Iveagh. — With two feet on the earth I stand, And thus obliquely bend; And, though I cannot walk, I help The man who would ascend. I'm sometimes made in one long piece, And sometimes cut in sections; But, though my steps can never stray, They tend in two directions. When standing still, I'm dangerous, If e'er my steps I miss. For, though I would not fall myself, My friends the earth might kiBs. And, if you now remove my head, The sudden amputation, Will change me to the thing you dread The most in all creation. 1.943.

ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS PUBLISHED April 12. 1,917. The supposed planet's distance from the Sun, computed by Kepler's third law, is 13,698,839 miles; hence its hourly motion in its orbit is 179,317* miles; and, assuming the Earth to be at rest* it would make the transit of the Sun's disc in 4h. llm. 59 -4s. As, however, the hourly motion of the earth in its orbit is=68,094-5 -f- miles, the actual time of the transit would be 4h. 25m. 41s. Answers, varying not more than 90 sec. from each other, have been received from J. W. H. H.. T. Clarkson, J. C. Hansen, Zero, F. A. Caterer, and A. C. Threlfall.

The new problems, &-x, sent by the fol lowing contributors are acknowledged with thanks:— €k Mason, A. C. Threlfall, Diony aius Dash, of Dashington Park. Correct answer to No. 1,923, by J. R. Pillifrant, inadvertently omitted to be ac knowledged last week. Correct answers to 1,907, 1,908, and 1,909, by E. H. Bell (Port Lincoln), received too late to be acknowledged at the proper time. Charades.— Wefrequently receive charades of considerable merit as regards the versifica tion, but which are inadmissible because the meanings of the separate syllables remain unchanged. For instance, all such words as Green- land, Arch-bishop, Help-mate, Life boat, Foot-man, &c;, are unsuitable, whilst such words as Leg-end, End-anger, Assign at-I-on and many scores of others that may be found in the dictionary, serve the purpose admirably. QUIPS AND CRANKS— No. LXX. 1 'nature's mother wit.' Jeronymo sat' upon an antiquated back log, grim,: ghastly, and grumpish. The pollywoge were abroad, and the grunters ?were retiring for the night. The knowing nigger was notorious for his dismal waggaries, and on this occasion he was as stolid as a starved alligator with a muzzle on his snout. There he sat blinking like an owl on a bon fire night. ' What am de matter, Jeronymo,' cried Caesar, approaching him. 'Hab your missus gib you another good wallup ?' ' Boo-boo-boo. Yon see, Sir Csesar, when I sees her seize her stick I Wowb my nose, and I knows my nose will feel de blows. Den I cuts my stick, you knows. Booboo boo. But I say, Caesar, can you black nigger just tell dis 'spectable gen'leman dis year— Spose I hab three or four mudders, and ebery one ob dem hab a big son like dis gen'lemen, and ebery one of dem sons hab a wife like me, how many wifes hab they all together? You gib him up. Well stupid. Boo- boo-boo. Look year. 1 hab my fore faders, habent I? Berry well. And all my forefaders hab wifes, habent they. Berry well. Den this 'spectable gen'leman hab four faders and four mudders, and ebery one of his madders hab a eon, and date me, stupid. Den my misses am four missuses, and dey all wallup me, don't day ? Booboo boo.' Momus. EPIGRAM. ' I've lost my character,' cried Bob. ' Alas ! Alas ! It makes my heart quite sad.' ' Rejoice, old chap,' cried Dick the snob, ' What you have lost was very, very bad.'
