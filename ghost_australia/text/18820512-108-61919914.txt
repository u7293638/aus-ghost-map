The "contrite and humble spirits" are joined by Him who promises to dwell with such: And therefore where pride and vanity aeo, dreams, of ambition or the comfortable rqveris of self-esteem : where the praise ., ~q. pen is.drunk in eagerly, and the pulse ,yet beats high with the love of admiration : tlhcere self-righteousness is satisfied with f, mhat ,,it, has done, and spiritual pride .thanks God that it is not as other men tire: When men are proud of thdir humiliation, and look round, as it were, ,fr the praise of their penitence, therelis ..no .trues. repentance. Nothifig can atone for sin but the blood of Christ. Theroe is no pardon for sin but by God's m ercy through Christ. The only way bf obtaining remission is to return to G9d Christ in sincere repentance and ,.hiively faith. Nothing that we can do, ,lsthat the whole world could do, could ex J.Ianto a single sin. No such expiation is t.,?necled, for it was made when Christ died. ;~Butitwe have to be sanctified, as well as ,ifriedoned. Our sins must be forsaken isi ,,wo1llas remitted, and true repentance turns' Ji.aay from sin to God and holiness.. But F,' iins. long indulged, oven with the grace bf helid'Holy Ghost cannot be overcome with ,, t a struggle. -Bishop Jackson.
