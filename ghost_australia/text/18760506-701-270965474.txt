SPIRITUAL WIVES THE depressed state of .the 'manufacturing business is again illustrated b^V: the closing of what was generally ••sup-- posed to .be a large- and- flourishing manufactory,. ; The establishment of the" Eddy Brothers, at,Chittenden-" Yermont, : which for more than a year past has been running seven days in a week, and turning out - ghosts < of every variety; -in lots to suit customers, has* suspended. The proprietors have already:-left-,-Y'errnont, -and are now on their 'waj' ito Salt. Lake ,City, whei-e they promise to resume business at an early ^lay:-- .Their ; proinise, however,, is not generally believed, although they are understood-to ; have packed a large number of Rarnple ghosts in -.waterproof, boxes; V=a1iidi'forwarded them to .Utah by a fast freight Ime. The general - explanation bf tlieir conduct is that their business has -of late proved unprofitable, and that 1 they intend to abandon it altogether. Certainly, Salt Lake City presents no ad- •: vantages for- a' manufacturing business which the Eddys could 'not commandat Chittenden, while, on the other hand,. Biighaiu Young claims-a-mohopoly ^of communication with the 5 'spirit'-world,? and would hardly welcome tlie arrival of an opposition fiim ' There is,: however, one -explanation' of the conduct of the Eddy Brothers which is not altogether "incr«^ible, ahd which hence deserves r mention. ^Uiiiil recently, Bngham Yoiihg has *=devoted his life to the woik of setting 'an example of polygamy to .his devout followers. . Of course 'he lias isuffered, but he has boine his sufferings' in silence. As one by one his locks ,of hau departed, he has gone thiough $ie empty form of buying bottles.of. hairjestoiative, and has never once£m«^i- ,tioned-;.the domestic argum ents ,which were the real source of Ins sudden and repeated baldness. When the^venging t broom-stick smote him on theligad 'he pimply sought the consolations of saiaiica, and piously told his ^postlesjthat the 4 contusions on his scalp wfiiejboils.^ A less deteimined^maityr "would not have been scalded for merely lemailang that lie was unable to buy twenty-seven^ Indian shawls 'all at once, without re- ? solving to have an immediate leyolu- ,. tion forbidding polygamy; but Mr. Young has always accepted,hot^"«s»ter as pait of his inevitable Jot^as the standai d-beai er of polygamy, and.,has magnanimously told his attendingjphy- «ician that he 'was scalded by-the cat- But, within a Jeeent -^penodj, the" 5 Gentile courts have taken the liberty, of dragging the piophet's domestic^difficulties to light, and at is now useless for him to pietend that polygamy^is a I pleasuie In fact he lias virtually ad- " mitted that his domestic life has been I grievous and 'expensive, ahd 'al&bugh; - he does not deem it;honourable ! to'.make S any levelation on- the ^subject/^wliich' * would put such of his foUowersZris "h'tve adopted polygamy at 'iis-^-^ifenen-^ dation to any inconvenience Nere is no i," doubt thatfhe would beigladUo^^f^d ~ of his wives, could he do so with credit/ to himself, and without'inMnging' the law of his church.
