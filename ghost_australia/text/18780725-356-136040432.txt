%ho Ghost. TnE entertainment at the Protestant eall last evening was agaiin highly success.ul, nid it will be a matter of regret to many that " The Ghost" must take its dopa?ture. so soun to fulfil previous elngagements, to-night being its last performance in Nuewcasile. Mr. Raiunford, however, at the request of a lurge number of parents and teachera, has kindly arranged to give a special trltcaice for. children this nfternoon, at 2 o'clock, as well as the evening performance. We can c?nfidently recommend this remarkably clover illusory ernterta~ummset to the notice ot those of the public who asve not yet seen it, rid advise them niot to mise tha last opportuniiy of doing so.
