News of the Week. The Hon. Thos. King (Minister of Education) was a passenger by the South Aus tralian, which sailed for Melbourne on Wednes day. ; The Thales, steamer, from Hongkong arrived at Port Darwin, on Monday, November 8j with 197 Chinese passengers, and 220 tons of cargo for Port Darwin. ! A steamer, supposed to be the Orient, passed Breaksea Island. Western Australia, at 6 p.m. on November 9. The Orient left the Semaphore at 5.30 p.m. on the 6th instant. ? By the R.M.S. Khedive, which arrived at King George's Sound on 'Wednesday night, the Australian cricketing e.'even, who nave so distinguished themselves in the old country, returned to the colonies. Mr. R. Cameron, J.P., of Kapunda, has consented to contest the mayoralty of that municipality. The present mayor of Clare, Mr. Kimber, has refused to allow himself to be again nominated for the offise. I We understand that in connection with the intercolonial pasgenger traffic it is con templated to extend the accommodation on board the steamers so as to carry a much larger number, retaining the reduced fares for second and third classes. At the Port Adelaide Police Court on Wednesday morning ten parents were fined 53. and 10s. costs each, for neglecting to send their children to school for a period of not less than thir;ty-five days during the quarter ending Sep tember 30. . The following telegram has been received by'the Miuister of Education from the Acting Government Resident at Port Darwin :— '?Somerset arrived to-day from Sydney with one hundred and thirty-four Chinese and four Euro peans for here, and also forty tons of cargo.' '? The ialf-yearly meeting of the Coffee Taverns Company was held on Wednesday, when a report and balance-sheet, showing that the tavern had been worked at a small loss during the half-year, were presented and adopted. A change in the management had taken placa in consequence, and it was hoped that the expe rienoe of the forthcoming half- year would be more favorable. An adjourned meeting of the committee of the Gawler Institute was held on Friday evening, November 5, for the purpose of electing a secretary atd librarian in place of Mr. M. M. Whitton, who is removing to Adelaide. Twenty four applications were received, and Mr. Otto Wehrstedt was appointed by a majority of one over Mr. Alfred Drakard, a recent arrival from England. With reference to the new town hall at Mount Gambier the Sovth-Eastern Star writes : — !?*' There is every prospect of the council having a .good choice of designs for the proposed town ball and chambers, as upwards of twenty- five applications have already been received for par ticulars as to requirements and materials to be used in its construction. The applications are from Melbourne, Adelaide, and other places.' The half-holiday movement at Narra coorte, started a short time since, appears to be very successful. The local paper of Novem ber 5 eays: — 'Every Wednesday afternoon large crowds go for cricket, kangarooing, and other exhilarating sports. Last Wednesday a good number got thrown from their horses; several hands were damaged in the cricket field, lots of fun was enjoyed, and everything went off most satisfactorily.' A correspondent informs us that on Tuesday last a pebble embedded in solid yellow clay was found at the rear of the new hotel Crafers, having all the appearance of sea washing, and affording evidence of an upheaval at some time or other. Similar pebbles, he states, may be found on the sandhills near Noarlunga, and at Mount Bryan. The subject of the present discovery is in the possession of Mr. Giles, manager for Dr. Norman, Crafers. : Messrs. Uruce & ?Stuart, solicitors, acting for Mr. Duncan Grant, the contractor for the Wallareo ietfcy, obtained on Monday, from Mr. Justice Boucaufc,an interim injunction, restraining the Commissioner of Public Work3 from taking the jetty works out of the hands of Mx. Grant, and trom determining the contract, on the ground that Mr. Grant has omitted t3 draw and .reorive, or to remove one single pils, of which the Government officials complain. Mr. Downer, Q.C., appeared for Mr. Grant. V The customary annual mayor's banquet was given by His Worship (Mr. E. T. Smit'i, M!.P.) at the Town Hall oh Tuesday evening, 'K -? vember9. There was a Very large assemblage,! i cliiding members of both Houses of Parliamet ', members of the Gifcy Council, ex-mayors and e ?-- councillors, mayors and councillors of otb r corporations, officers of the local military fore ?, representatives of the clergy, and other iavifcr- 1 guests. The proceedings passed off very smoothly and harmoniously. - I The Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General of' the Local Military Foree (Capt. Fergusscn) informs us that the intercolonial rifle match ia Melbourne is fixed forthe 21th of the present month, and that there will be opportunities for practising at the : Williamstown ranges before hind. Capt. Ferguesbn adds, 'I ain ?sotty- tc| say £bme »£ our bestr 'representatives ara usable to afford., the trip, and intend t a with draw. We have -raised about ^80, but ;?i3 eighteen men ar* going we ought to have £180, or £10 per mao, --so as to cover all their ez penees.' . . . : - l Late on Sunday night, November 7, a fire broke out in the north-west corner of the Port Adelaide Market buildings, in a shop occu- pied by Mr. Burns, greengrocer. Fortunately it was confined to some casks and bags of flour, and was soon extinguished by the energetic efforts of the police. Mr. T. Sanders, the deputy-superintendent of the Fire Brigade was also in attendance with No. 12 reel, but the water was not turned on. No damage was done to the building, which is insured with the South British Insurance Company. This is the second fire within the last six months, occurring in the same part of the market buildings. t On Sunday evening, November 7, the police reported to the city coroner the suddea death of a girl of 13 named Mary Ann Hirfcigan, . living in Gray-street, off Franklin-street. From enquiries made it was ascertained that deceased had been subject to fits for some fciais, and that she had one a few hours before her death, but her^frieuds, thinking she would re cover, delayed sending for medioal aid. Dr. Dixon was called, and attended immediately, biM; found the girl dead. Tne coroner, after visiting the house and interviewing the doctor, decided that an inquest was not necessary. -)ur readers will be interested in learning th^t Mr. Allison, who is in Melbourne, has re ceived a cablegram from Trickett, stating he ia in 'excellent health and certain of success in his great contest with Hanlan on the 15th insfc. - So^ne of our leading sportsmen .among the A4elwdeaps who are now in the 'Victorian metropolis have subscribed a thousand pounds to| send home for the purpose of backing Trickett; and this practical expression of their confidence in his prowess wiU no doubt stimu late tfre Sydney oarsman to row his hardest and his! beet when he meets tne Canadian in the race for the championship of the world. ' . Police-trooper Rabey, who was injured at Belair on Saturday by being thrown from a . horse, is getting on very satisfactorily. Rabey was riding a vicious animal into Belair, when it bolted with him, and on being curbed com menced bucking. At last, finding it could not get rid of its rider, who stuck to the saddle manfully, the horse made a rush straight for the door of the Belair Hotel, and on being turned aside very skilfully jammed its rider between a wall and a tank. The rider was in a most awkward position, and on fhe horse again bucking he lost his seat and fell heavily, striking the back of his head on a stone, and sustaining a severe wound. The following telegram has been re ceived by the Postmaster- General from the telegraph stafcioamaeter at Port; Darwin: — ' Three more men arrived at Elsey Oitnp on the 1st of November from Barketown, also four yesterday. The second two also arrived at the camp of a clearing party in Boper Creek, and state that they were attacked by natives about twelve miles from Elsey Camp, on Saturday night, October 30, and that a blackboy who was with them received a severe wound on his thigh from a large stone spear. The boy was left behind with 83me other 'men, who have bullock-drays with them, and he is not expected to recover.' On Saturday, November 6, Messrs. A. Simpson & Sen's emplojes held a picnic. A procession of eight of Gartrell's conveyances, headed by Youlton's brass band, started from Grenf ell-street for Clarendon, arriving there after a pleasant drive. After a ramble about the hills, sixty-three sat down to a very good dinner provided by Host Bulman.of the Claren don Hotel. The health of the firm was proposed by Mr. W. E. Doe, and supported by Mr. James Ballantine. Mr. A. M. Simpson responded. After another ramble tea was provided, and was done justice to. During the day a cricket match was played between the married and single men, which resulted in an easy victory for the bachelors. ' ' We have received . the following memor andum from the Inspector-General of Schools : — ' With respect to the paragraph in your paper reporting a meeting of the Public Teachers' Association, and referring to a motion carried to the effect that the Minister of Education be - asked to extend the Christmas holidays to four weeks, I have the honor to inform you that the' Honorable Minister had decided previously to - grant an extra week to all teachers, as per accom panying circular.''. ' Circular.— The Honorable the Minister of Education directs m&to; inform teachers that, on account. of the .Melbourne . Exhibition, the Christmas holidays this year will be one week longer than usual— Johh A; Habtley, Inspector-General.'? : . Mr. Linn, of the Lady Daly flptelj Hindmarsh, informs us that on Wednesday a respectably dressed man came to his hotel, and in return for ^refreshments received tendered what purported to be a sovereign, receiving the necessary change. It was remarked at the time that the coin was somewhat light' for a sovereign, but the man, who was a stranger to the place, accounted for this by remarking that the coin was an old one, and the date bore him out in this respect. Feeling dissatisfied as to the genuineness of the coin, Mr. 'Xiinn took it to the bank, and it would undoubtedly have been changed there had he not remarked as to its peculiarity. It was then tested, and found, to be a shilling very cleverly bronzed over. ' The matter is in the hands of the police, as it is J thought that a number of these coins may be*: in circulation. \ , ''..'? The first information laid in ^the -colony.^ under the new Merchant Seamen's Wages ^and^ Bating Act. was heard at the Port Adelaide Police Court on Saturday morning, November - 6\. The informant was a seaman of the ship Oaklands, who asked the court to cancel his agreement with the .captain on the grounds that ; the latter had used threats to' him,; and: had treated him badly in other ways. The S M. (Mr. It. J. Turner), after hearing the evi dence of the informant, said he had some doubts whether the Wages and Rating Act under which the application -was made had as yet come into operation in the colony. In the present cace, however, it did not matter whether it had or not, as the «ourfc did not - thick the dispute between - the iaformaut and defendant warranted it in rescinding the agree ment even if it had power to do so. ; A somewhat serious accident occurred at the new Northern Hotel, Port. Augusta, on Thursday, November 4. According to the local' paper the scaffolding use^, in the mason work was being removed, when a_ portion of it fell. Three men in the.emplpy of Messrs. Brown and Pybue— J. Crocker, WV Reid^ jand- *F, Chew— - were unfortuuately^engaged on jfche portion that fell, and were thrown to the ground with the. ^Sris, a distance , of sprue twenty: feet. One of them is considerably battered, and all; three-are confined to bed, although no serious results are anticipated. Mr, T, Williams, r foreman for. Messrs. Sara -& \- Co.. was, however, severely, injured. Mr. Will lams was standing near when ; the scaffolding, fell upon him. J He narrowly.', escaped being killed, as . some of the heavy . timber barely cleared his head, striking him on the Bhoulder. Fortunately no bones, are broken, but. Mr; Williams is confined to the house, and; some time will probably elapse before he is able' to; resume hiB duties. . t 7 5 A guard on the North-West Bend line, oamed Walter Hine, met with a nasty accident en Friday, November 5. According to tie Kapunda Heraldhe was employed in conducting a special train from Eudunaa to Gawler bn that day. When at Ford's Station he attempted to drop a parcel on the. platform while- the train; ?wie in motion, but, in -doing so, he must have' slipped off the step; as he fell-beavily to the ground. When hewas picked up he was found to; have sustained a very nasty cut on 'the head, X ; besides several bruises. He was takehf 1)ack to Ji Kapunda as soon as possible, where prTPentlahd attended him,- and after examining liis wound*, -' ordered his removal to the hospital. It was for tunate that he was in the brabe-van, which was ?' tbe last carriage in' the tram, otherwise he must have been crushed. -On the afternoon 6f the - sakne day Mr. L. Johnson was riding a^young horse bear Allendafe, when fEe animal reared add fell-back on the rider, severely cruflhinghimi - Be was taken to the Allendale Hotel.7 ?.-;---?-?- | The latest issue of the 'Border JVatcft records a curious circumstance. - Two- men who had been devoting .excessive, attention to the rosy god were passengers by the coach from Penola to Mount Gambier. The driver iput them inside the coach, and having occasion later to . deliver a parcel looked to see if his passen gers were all right; He was alarmed to find cBe missing, and he was naturally afraid that the missing man had fallen out ana was injured. The remaining passenger, it appears, could giye; no information. On arrival at Mount Gambier the driver reported the circumstance, and Sergeant Field and Constable Beare drove . out ^ to ascertain that eo injury had befallen the man. They were accompanied by Mr. Inger, barman of the Mpunt Ganibier Hotel, on horseback. They cculd find no trace of any one on the road, and eL-quiries at the several farmhouses on the .way to' tbe Six Mile Inn threw. no. light on the matter. The man subsequently walked into tewn unhurt, and said he fell out of the coach. The unfortunate part of the affair is that Islr. iDger was thrown from his horse and rendered insensible. The horse, which also fell, had its left, broken. ;: ~; - ' The half-yearly dinner intconnection with, the Derby Lodge of Orangemen was held at the Wellington Inn, Ourrie-street, on Friday even ing, November 5. About 60 members sat down to Ian excellent repast furnished by host^Fer gusop. The chair was occupied by Bro, theEev. B. [P. Miidge, . who was supported by Bro. the Bev. Jas.. Pollitt, chaplain of the lodge. Bra H. Coulter occupied jbhe viee-ehair. ; The; loyal * toafts were duly honored. The toast of the immortal Prince TTilliam of Orange was drunk in silence. M Prosperity to the Derby £odge' was next Bubiaiitted, and was well received. The chaplain said he was sorry that owing to old age the was not j able to meet them oftener. Ireland waa the -mother of Orapgeism, and at one time wh3n -.: jshej was the gem of the ocean a great many youbg people were sent there from England. to be educated. It was only when the Pope tried to levy, various impositions on the Iriah people'! that Ireland lost her freedom and her. beauty.

The reoeipti of the half-year amounted to £4,633 14s. l©dv A ??? large proportion of this has beeii«ifely invested! in good freehold securities about Adelaide and suburbs; The profit dtover £1,000 leaves, after deducting workin^expencesj ; a franosome sum for division, so that the directors ^aveaBotked '- - nearly 5s. 3d. per share for tbe past eix montbr. Notwithstanding the depressing -^times the Eociety'e securities as. a whole are in a. good. sound, and safe position, alt hough an amount of between £19,000 and £20,000 has' been lent bj the society. The total profit on original eharea paid to tbe clotse of the half-year shows the very excellent result of £24 Is., thus furnishing ample evidence of the prosperity of the eocietj.

Up to Saturday, we believe, some sixty or seventy horses remained to be accounted for. Some went so far as to pay Howrah a visit, and four met with an untimely death in Tolly's Nullah. Mr. Macklin can hardly be congratu lated on the success of his plan, and we believe it is the intention of the authorities topaes certain orders on this mode of convey ing Australian horses from the ships to the stables. The stockmen were unremitting in their efforts to prevent disaster. The most note worthy point of the affair is that not a single man, woman, or child sustained so much as a scratch. No doubt the thundering noise caused by the mob gave timely warning, and enabled every one to seek shelter ; but when we consider the streets they went through it seems nothing short of a miracle. There were some narrow escapes; One gentleman was riding down the Reach when he saw the horses coming straight at him fall pelt. Calling to his syce to assist in holding in his horse, he was gratified to sea that worthy individual busily engaged in squeezing himself through a gateway, and for the nonce deaf to his master's call. He wisely turned and galloped with the mob, which soon however passed by like a flash of lightning wifch : out touching him.' A large and an influential meeting of parents and persons interested in the building of a echeol at Dublin was held on Monday, November 8, in the Dublin Hotel, to consider the action of the Education Board in calling for tenders for a wooden structure when a sum of £960 had been passed on the Estimates, evidently with the intention of building a stoae structure, and one that would be suitable to the require ments of the township. Mr. J. Porter occupied the chair. The chairman in introducing the /subject said that a long and an earnest appeal had been made to the Government both by letters and deputations to the Minister of Educa tion, and through this agitation the Government had generously placed a sum on the Estimates sufficient to build aschoolhouseand teacher's resi dence. It was understood that this sohoolhouse would be similar to those at Mallala, Balaklava, and other places. He read communications from the Education Board, stating that plans were in preparation for an entirely new style of building, and taid -throughout they had been led to believe that the building would be a substan tial stone structure. In placing the itenuon the Estimates he had no doubt that the intention «f the Government was to build a stone struc: tore, as in all cases where & wooden ooe was to he built it was mentioned as such. It seemed to be mofit absurd to erect a wooden building at Dublin when all kinds of building material — « tone, lime, and sand— were in such abundance close at hand. Mr. W. Crosby endorsed all that had been said by the chairman, and proposed — 'That this meeting strongly protests against the action of the Government in calling for; tenders for a wooden schoolhouse, more particularly after a sum of £83'J had been voted for that purpose, that amount being sufficient for building a sub stantial stone schoolhoues and teacher's resi dence, such a structure having been already promised and most urgently required in the district.' This was supported by Messrs. Hornell, P. Martin, sen., and J. Prime, aud Carried unanimously. Mr. E.. B. Smith proposed that the above resolution be forwarded to the Minister of Education, and also that it be inti mated to him that a deputation would wait upon him to ask him to recall the tenders, and that the members for the district, Messrs. Cavenagh and Darling, be asked to introduce the deputa tion at their earliest convenience, as the tenders are called for the 26th inst. This was carried unanimously, and the whole of thosa present were appointed on the deputation. A vote of thanks to the chairman and Mr. D. J. Strong man, secretary, was accorded, and a most orderly and earnest meetieg closed. ? The extensive additions to the Port Ade laide Railway Station are now nearly com pleted- and the alterations to the old building necessary to complete the renovation will shoi tly be commenced. The new structure, which extends along nearly the whole length of the platform on the northern side of the station, is built of stone with brick ornamentations, and presents a neat and solid appearance. The building has been apportioned in a tolerably patisfactc: manner, though a departure from the original plans has been neces sitated in consequence of the architect having omitted to provide for a parcels office. ^It was -intended that the first three rooms in the building, startingfrom St. Vincent-street, should have been a goods office, stationmaster's office, and telegraph office respectively; but when it was found that no provision was made for a parcels office it was decided 13 use for this purpose the two last-named offices. This entails some inconvenience, as instead of having one large room for their use, the clerks in the parcels office have two small ones divided by a thick wall. The dimensions of the goods office are 26 ft. 6 in. by IS ft., and of the two parcels offices. 26 ft. by 13 tc, and 24 ft. by 13 ft. respectively. Next to these offices is a fine large refreshment-room, 30 ft. hy 29 ft. 3 in., fitted up with a counter and ac cessories. ' It has a circular roof, with diagonal principals affixed, and is a great improvement in every respect upon the old structure. A kitchen, 21ft. by 13 ft., for use in connsctian with the refreshment-room, adjoins it. The other offices are occupied as ladies' trait-?i*- room; 26 ft. by 15 ft. in size, porters' room, 20ft. by 14 ft. 45 in., -and oil and lamp-rooms. The. waiting and refreshment rooms are fitted with new patent ventilators, which can beregulated by any passenger, with great ease. The telegraph office, which it was at first intended to have in the new building, will be constructed out of the present ladies waiting-room, whilst the refresh ment-room now in use will be converted into a booking office. The stationmaster will be ac commodated, on the space now occupied by tbe porters and goods clerks. The present station master's and booking offices will be pulled down, and the Bite will : form . part of a passage 35 feet in -width leading on to the platforms. The passage will be divided in two longitudinal Sections .by an. iron railing, one foe passangers . going out ef the station and the other for those .going in. At the entrance large cedar doors will be placed. It is expected that further improve- - ' mentswill fee made at the station, amo lgst which * span of galvanized iron to go fro a platform to platform has bees spoken of, The London correspondent of the Lioer pool Mercury in making the announcement that the Rev. Stopford A. Brooke, one of the chap laibs in ordinary to the Queen, and minuter of Hodford Chape), Bloomsbury, L3ndoD, is abaut to ltave the Church of England anj become a Unitarian, writes as follows: — Mr. Soopt'ord Brooke ia about to leave the Church of B'jgland. Since tbe death ol Cauoa Kiugsley, Mr. Brooke has been the hope of hli patty ia the church. Tbe biographer of Robertson of Brighton, a diteiple in seme respects of Professor Maurice be held as long as he could to tke ideal of a coai prebe^sive church, includiag all parties ; aad while rejecting asutterly untenaHe toe dry ortho dox doctrinei of future puniahinent, aubstitu tiooaJlsm.and verbal inspiration, yet maintained tbe Divinity of Christ and the truth, ' if pra parly underutcod,' of tbe thr- j creeds. Fur a loug time his foUoweri hare been coc^iuut of doubt and hesitancy in bis preaching. You had an outline op'y a few weeks ago of a sermon in which he begged hia congregation to trait awhile in the Jerusalem of their heart* until the revelation of tbe new Ptmleco^t had coma. The purely humanitarian aide of Christianity ha« been more and more apparent in his se mons. For him Dean Stanley may have written that explanation of Trinit&ritnum; which wb«n it appeared the other day in the M*c tetmth Cntvry, mured so much commotion among the orthodox. All in v»W. Mr. Bro3*re bu heeome a Unitarian. He will reform tke Prayer Book -1 I* Yoyney, and ass uymaB henoeforfeh without tbe aiariptioo; pre«chinj MraHm irhieb, ir tead of inealeating the woA ?hip of Obrist, will deprecite it m ido'v try. The Uoiteriau have Ion* b:» wita out a ancre«aor to Mr. Martxoe«a. As * really eloquent preacher, with wide literary B)(uptthiM, mad not witboat some yesmloga towvds the ooaimanioo be has left, Mr. Brooke «il! fill that p* ve. Kut the pxin he wiU cmaae among his moat fervent admirers is only a por tion of the harm that his secession will cause. Probably one-half cf those who have been in fluenced by his teaching have felt, as Mr. Maurice did when he ceased to be a Unitarian, that there was no explanation possible of the mjstery of existence unless the revelation of the Gospel was divine. To them the only alternatives are wmei orm of Trinitsrianism and simple agnosticism — the knowledge of nothing. To these, his disciples, tbe tsar in;; away of their only standing ground will bring such confusion and sorrow as only those people can understand who have themselves felt i'le pangs which follow upon a surrender of the creed of their active life. The Juvenile Floral and Art Society in connection with All Saints' Church, Hindma^b. held their annual exhibition, under the pit ?- nage of the Eev. H. M. Poliitt, incumbent of the church, in the Congregational Oiiurch schoolroom, Hindmarsh, on Thursday, Novem ber 4. The walls of the room were hung with texts, banners, paintings, pencil draw ings, and other works of art supplied by members of the church and others, and in addition to the flowers and works of art and in dustry shown by the juveniles, collections of flowers were Bent by Messrs Sewell, W. Brooker, and others; in fact, in every way the committee bad evidently done their bar:.; to make the affair a success. Three tables were laid along the room, and were covered with plants in pots, cut flowers, plain and fancy needlework, drawings, &c.; There was a large attendance during the afternoon and evening, the show being specially well attended in tbe evening. The St. Augustine's drum and fife band, under Mr. F. Bourn, played selections of music outside, while within the room a piano was kept going.

The half-yearly entertainment in connec tion with the Glenelg Literary Association took place on Thursday evening, November 4, in the Institute Hall, Glenelg. The president of the association, the Rev. C. Manthorpe, occupied the chair. The attendance was not rery large, the hall being only half filled, but the audieo.ee manifested the greatest interest in and approval of the performances of those who took part in the entertainment. The first line on tbe pro gramme was an overture on the piano, performed by Mr. G. S. Hall in his usual brilliant style, after which the president gave a short account of the progress of the association during the year, stating that various papers on different sub jects had been read, and discussions had taken place at the weekly meetings, and that a lecture on meteorology had also been delivered. There had been a small increase of members during the past session, there being now forty. During the seven years the asso ciation had been in existence it had been attended with pretty uniform success, and he hoped that this would continue in the future. It was intended to follow the example of the Adelaide Young Men's Society, and allow young ladies and others to baoome - associates, and this step he felt sure would meet with, tbe approval of all. In conclusion he thanked the members of the association for the number of times that he had been elected presi dent, and said that he had always taken an interest in the association, and hoped he would continue to do so. Mr. H. Oelmann then gave a song, 'Smile and bid me live,' in a manner that did not seem to be appreciated as much as it deserved; after which came a recitation by Mr. J. J. Virgo, 'Henry V. before Agincourfc,' followed by the duet *? Your pardon, Signors.' by Mrs. T, H. Jones and Miss Vandepeer, which was most imperatively encored. Mr. J. Nichokon had alsa to coma forward again through the amount of applause that was accorded to a comic recitation. Mr. Oelmann, sang the ballad, 'I seek for thee iu every flower ;' and Mr. W. Storrie recited the speech of the Earl of Chatham before the House of Lords, on the question of American Inde pendence, very fairly, but his style was some what wanting in that force and energy with which the eminent statesman must have de livered his sonl-stirring words. The ballad ''Alas, those chimes J' from ' Maritana,' by Miss Yandepeer, who was in excellent voice ; and the song- ' Ernani in volami,' by Mrs. T. H. Jones, followed, and the duet, 'The sailor sighB,' in which Mr. Hall and Miss Vandepeer took part, and which was not altogether successful, can eluded the first; part of the entertainment. The second part was opened with a piano solo by Mr. G.S. Hall, and] the laughable farca 'Box and Cox,' in which Messrs. C. Manthorpe, Jan., and Hooper were, the principal actors, brought a very enjoyable^vening to a close. ? ? = :_-_ _L Air. James Rofe, who has for many years been the manager of the Port branoh of the S. A. Carrying Co.'s business, was made the recipient of a very handsome presenat tion at Port Adelaide on Friday morning, No vember 5. Mr. Rofe, since he has been com pelled to resign his position owing to the com pany having wound up, has determined to start at Port Adelaide on his own account in the same business, and a number of his friends and others connected with him in business decided to present him with a valuable gold watch, albert, and locket. Mr, T. Hack, J.P. (Mayor of Port Adelaide) in making the presentation, said the present was being made on behalf of many agents and merchants in the Port, whose connection with Mr. Rofe had always been satisfactory and pleasant in every way. He himself haJ ku - *n Mr. Kofe befoie he cauie to Port A-ld»idr, aiid ever since, and he had always f ;.ki-- him anxious to do his duties iu the be^s &i; - UiObt ready manner possible. This posit i ju h -1 involved a large amouut of reipca«l3i*irv ^uj difl'culty, mod iu dwehargiug LU iluslc* h& h»l not only steered dear of makiug enemies iu lht- Port, but bad contracted almost univer««J friendship. Kow that the company w*s dis solved, and that the busincu would have to be left to private person*, they ooogratulared them selves on tbe fact- that Mr Kofe iutended to re ic*ui with them aud fs^&blish; m busiaeus on his own account, and u was tl eir wi*h that he would be micoessful in his effort. He bad much pleasure in handing tbe watch, albert, and locket to Mr. K -fe. They were giveu with tbe Kreate«t beartiness, and a* a mark of the eiteem in which be was held by all couoected with b;-n io tbe l'ort. Mr. H. C. E. Maeeke, J.P., cjt- ; dially endorsed the previous speikar'n remarks. | They would all agree that Mr. Kofe h*d bsea ia \ & very difficult position, and be really «lid nut j knoir bo* be had orioigei to get through bu j multifarioua duties. He could **y mt one of the . directors of the company that they had bsru : tborooghly satisfied with tb« way be hid mUiftged tbeir bohiueas, and that be bad voa trcai them tbeir res|.-ect and «-ate-*B. Ho mentioned that the present would have b« eu uiucb larger, but it was decided that the aub ecription sbould be strictly confined to those intimately associated with Mr. Rofe. In reply, Mr. Rofe expressed his surprise and gratitude at the presentation, and 'thanked those ge'ntlemea. who had so kindly contributed to it. It was a source of much satisfaction to him to fcoow that he had been in the company's employ so long, and also that he had won tbe esteem of those with whom he bad been brought into contact. Amongst others he particularly thanked Mr. Muecke for the promise of support he had. previously made. He felt- extremely thankful to all those concerned in the presentation, aud be hoped that his future career would comorsad - tbe regard and esteem which it seemed be tad ; now gained. The company then -dispersed. - -??''? Mr. William Jones has shown us & Masonic Register, published by Messrs. Welling ton Joaes, & Co., of Philadelphia, which will doubtless be highly appreciated by members of the craft in this colony. As a specimen of steel engraving the register must rank as a work of art of more than ordinary excellence. The design gathers much of its effectiveness from the artistic grouping of the .various Masonic emblems. Beginning at tbe top the first figure is that of the all- seeing eye ; on one side is the sun, and directly underneath a repre sentation of morning radiant wifeh joy and gladness; on the other is the inaoi), representing rest, with a figure of a tired child below, reclining on the bosom of its guardian angel. Be^weea these figures, in tbe centre of the design, is an ornamental panel for the name of the brother. Directly underneath is a figurative representation of the boundless ness of the fraternity in -the form of a. sphere, : bearing on its front a space for the Masonic history of the brother whose name is inscribed oh the register. On the top of this sphere there are the Bible, the square, compasses, and trowel, emblematical of the principles that unite aud guide the actions ol the brotherhood. Iu the rear, parts of a tabernacle and tented house are shown,' intended to represent tbe progenitors of onr :oe, and the patri archal homes in which the principles of Masonry were first conceived. The picture : bordered by a pair of columns, oraameate' above the capitals with chapiters enriched wit' lily work, network, and pomegranates, emble matical of peace, unity, and plenty. Restioq; on the - chapiters are . representations of the celestial and terrestrial parts of the universe. On the pillar to the right is a shield bearing the date oc the brother's initiation, with the articles of the craft presented tolhim on tb« occasion, and also fie^irative representations of the T necessary preparatioasto be undergone before the consummation of that event.: Draped in front 1 of the pillar on tbe right is a certificate of membership with seal attached, and to the left ? of this again is the significant emblem, '^The point within the circle,' bordered by two per- - pendicular parallel lines, so avell known|to every Mason. The pillar on the opposite side bears a - shield containing the date when the brother .passed the F.O. degree with the usual emblems.'' Passing' over the many other emblems worked tpgetber in the design we find at the bottsm of ?the sphere 'the broken oelumn,' and other ^representations of the close of the; brother's earthly career. On a figured pedestal a space is ldft to be filled in after the brother's death; giving the d;.i3 of that event and other parti; 'cilara connected with his Masonic career. The design is printed on best quality Bristol board, 22 x 28 inches in size, and apart from ita value - as a hieroglyphic cr rt, reoord, dip'Tn^, and' rdonitor^ possesses many at'uractioas as aaen graving. . - i The aboriginal natives , in the Noriheicp Territory have been . causing some uneasiness,-. during the past few' days, and the latest out-. ~ rage accredited to them h calculated to iacrease tlpit uneasiness. In a telegram to the '^Poit-1 master-General, dated November 8, Mr. Skinner^ tb|e statibnuiaster at Barrow Gxeik, eupplie's tbe ,- following report:— 'On ^Saturday; morning, ', accompanied by Police-troaper South, I.met fifty miles south of the station two man, Ander- ' son and Connor, in charge of a bullock 'team' loiaded^with rations for- this station from Alice Springs. They reported that, on Wednesday,,, the 3rd instant, at 11 p.m., while sleeping, they . were attacked by natives at Viols Springs, on the Woodforde Creek, about eighty-five .miles south of Barrow Creek, Anderson receiving a spear in his left breast, which caused a wouad . that ran along the bone for fully three' inches, and Connor received two wounds on the right shoulder, penetrating the flesh to the bone,', Tiie . woimda appear,' highly inflamed, but the men suffer very iitfle. inconvenience from them, and they think there' ? is: no danger to be feared from poison, as the . wounds are healing nicely, and give paui onlyj ' when lifting any weight.

In conaection with tbe procees.we saw a number o? Bunson'saad Wool l^stoa's poWerfui electric batteries, two large elaie ttanti3 ft. 6 :ii. by 3 ft. and 3 ft. by 2 ft., inwL.ich were silver solutions and solid plates .. of silver from whiiTi the platinj is obtained. Swilling tubs, tubs of aquafortis, and tubs filled '? vfith preparation solution were all in request,. as a Britjanc-a metal tsapou, some cruefcstands, a quantity of officers' silver braiding cord aad other articles were cleansed and prepared for the &S1; ver bath. In a smaller vessel was a gold solu tion and a plate of the precious metal attached to a copper wire from the battery. The article to be plated was .attaihed to another copper wir«j then dipped in the hot solution, the electric current was established, and in a very brief, period of time the platingjOf .gold was. visible. After being dipped in acid*, passing through the sp: atch-brush Jathe. and one or two other pro cesses the brazen article was xjonyerted into a costly-looking ornament that none-.but an.^ex pert could oistinguish from .solid ..gold. -As sjteel, iron, copper, brass, zinc, tin, &c.i; wilL'all ?

Infantry were necessary to give tiie resistance required to an advance of a ifrie of outposts; cavalry were required to col lect and transmit .intelligence from the front; -artillery, if added, would usually be with the -reserve, where the guns should be placed so as to cover the retreat or the advanced portion of the otttpusts, or held in readiness hear a mam route. When guns, could be secured, against surprise they.might be poB ted near the front line eitber ott pf the range of the enemy's muskefcry-fire or . * protected from it by skirmishers thrown out iu .advance.
