! PEPPERING- THE, CLOUDS. Professor Pepper's arrangements for " tapping the clouds " for rain turned out complete, and accordingly with the help of a school-boy, who .accidentally was by, and gave the most needful skilled assistance, he sent up his twenty-feet kite held with iron wire, exploded his dynamite, and sent up a stream of electricity from his little battery into the cloud. The ex plosion brought a few drops, and one ac count of the other operation tells of the wonderful commotion above caused by the wee spark; but nothing .came of it. Now the experiment was most, interesting, and we should be apt to dwell with satis faction on it, if it had . been predicated, lik'e Pepper's ghost aud the, rest, merely as a good trick. 'But the idea of making rain,, and| satisfying the, thirsty soil there by, .was, from the first absurd. At the most, there could only be expected such a sprinkle as sometimes follows the ex plosion ;of .powder by , , the concussion of the air. A real fall of rain requires so vast Ja region of the ' air to be affected, that such a thing could not be effected in a smaller laboratory that that overhead. 'Enough, however, is proved to be a very strong confirmation of the theories which connect atmospheric and pluvial changes with' electrical action, and this is, sufficient to make further experiments desirable.
