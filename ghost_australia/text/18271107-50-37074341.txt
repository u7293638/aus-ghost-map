'After a stay of about an hour his Majesty left the Castle, and drove up the Long Walk to the Royal Lodge.— The statue of King Charles the Second was re-placed this day, in its former situation in the Great Court-yard, having been removed at the com mcncemenl of the present alterations in the Castle.

A 'con- spiracy, at the head of which was a neighbouring magistrate, had been set ou foot, for the purpose of inducing a woman of .infamous character to prosecute him for an assault, with an intent to commit a rape. The prosecution had, however, failed. The petitioner prayed that he might be hearJ at the bar of the house, in support of the allegations contained in his,petition. The learned gentleman said, it was too late in the session to take any steps in thjs case. He should there fore decline moving that the petition be printed, but merely let it lie on the table. If his story were true (and. he had heard from others that he was a very ill-used man) he would recommend him to bring forward his petilionearly in'the next session, to give the other parties an'oppoitunity of an. sweung its allegations, if they could. As the charges weie of a very serious nature, he (Mr. Brougham), had abstained from mentioning the names of the gentlemen who were, the subjects of accusation.

From tiiese Greeks, as well as by letters from Zatite, of 30th May, and from Corfu of 4th June, we have further particulars of the decisire battle -\ hich the Seraskier gained beforeiAthens.— The loss of the Greeks consists in between 2000 and 300)of the choicest and bravest troops, viz. all the Suh'ots :and Canr diois,and the remainder of the garrison of Missolonghi. General Karaiskaki died of his wounds eight hours after he was brought on board the Hellaa frigate. .Among other brave Captains who fell on the field of battle are M. Reta Inglesi, of Cephaloma, and Gahano, leader of- the Candiots, who had come from'St. Petersburgh to the assistance of his countrymen. The corps of Karaiskaki, which was the flower of the army, and amounted to 4000 men, is almost en tirely destroyed; of the othei 9000 Gieeks, 3000 threw them selves into the Piraeus, where they entrenched themselves j the remaining 6000 fled or dispersed in '''different 'directions: Fabvre is said to have informed the GreekSenate that the Acropolis has «till a stock of provisions sufficient for two months. - l ' t The battle took place on a1 Thursday.
