I POETRY & RHYMES, j ETTA'S GLEN. j I I I In the Black Spur sombre ranges, Like a gem the hills between, 1 Lies a vale whose sparkling waters | Kern and musk keep over green. Foot of man but rarely finds It In these hurried times of ours, Yet In years that long have faded Many sought Its verdant bowers. Merry voices stirred Its echoes, Learned its secrets, loved it well, Thus It is that spirits wander ' Ever through this fairy doll. Here the ghosts of old days gather, And true lovers dream again. Willie the streamlet softly bubbles Of a bygone joy and pain. To the wind's slow measure dancing, Witnesses of what have been, t Move the beech's graceful branches In a minuet serene. Every tree-fern has its story, Every stone its mystic lore, Ghostly laughter still Is ringing From the years that mc no more, Eight feet here have trod the mosses, Fair white hands have formed a cup That sweet lips might drink at pleasure Of the waters bubbling up. here no heat of summer scorches, All its fragrant, fresh and cool, Leafy canopies are guarding streamlets, fall, and fairy pool. Like to one who, hot and weary, , Soft shade Ending, falls asleep, Of Youth's daisies meadows dreaming Ere the years brought woes to weep. You, as I, O city follers, Could your tired foot find it, too. Hero would dream, all care forgetting, And life's olden joys renew. Main Moran, Austral Light.
