He Came! He Saw!! He Vanished!!! PARTING KICK, BY A POLWARTH ELECTOR.) WHAT'S his name Came, For his own little game; What's his name Saw, Like a cunning jack-daw, He had not the ghost Of a chance, at the most, To conquer At Polwarth and Grenville; So in wrath and in rancour, Instead of being civil, This fulminant dolthead, This pet of the club, This ill-tempered cub, Could do nothing but snub The electors, and BOLTED.
