Fresh evidence that Victorians are bent on swimming with the tide of fashion is to be found in the recent feminine protest-" thunder gives an " enfranchised womankind "-which has gone up from the Victorian Women's Suffrage Society On the whole, it is somewhat surprising that our community has been so long without an organised movement to supply ladies with a leahy becoming and -scramble grievance 'The redress of gi lev anees ought, according to parliamentary usage, to precede supply, but possibly the accident of men among 111 these colonies to provide supplies, while women attend more to the disbursements, may account for the neglect of thousago hero As it is, many of the fan unemployed 111 our midst are blest with leisure, worldly comforts, and the gift of public speaking There is no customs duty on slightly worn crotchets not intended for general consumption, while impor timent cities have hinted before now that the fashions of the year before last find a ready market in the colonies Here we see the customary procedure, where "isms' and "fads" are concerned, closely followed in this instance The woman's suffrage movement was originally started in the United States some 25 years ago it was allowed plenty of love there, until the extravagant antics of its devotees had caused an incredibly bitter sentiment of public disgust and alarm, in face of which it gradually dwindled, and the movement is now to all intents and purposes stone dead "111 that county It is true that in the States of Wyoming and Idaho women have been allowed to vote, but this success is some what dimmed by the fact that there are practically no women 111 Wyoming and Idaho The export of iron blown American now cities to England has been a brisk Yankee industry for some years past When Miss SUSAN li AMHONY S cccen treaties, Mrs Vicioiuv Woonnuns morals, and Dr Muir WUKIUS peculiar nether garments had been (meta phorically speaking) thoroughly torn to rags by the American paragraphist, those ladies were always able to pose before London salons and London audiences as the Western representatives of an advancing 1 evolution in the political and social status of woman Just after the House of Commons has reiterated its refusal to give the franchise to women, the woman's rights notion (slightly damaged) seems to have been imported by some enterprising Melbourne in III, and the result was the interesting assemblage at the Bourke street Coffee Palace last Monday evening There is no doubt that the evolution of modern societies does tend to bring the question of the future of women constantly to the front The "bitter "cruel uneducated women has long made itself heard in the dense populations of the old world, and a hearty effort to foster and de\ elope higher female education has been the answer to that cry We, for our part, have never hesitated to support movement of that kind in their widest and most liberal sense Again, the formidable increase in the number of unmarried women, and the difficulty of finding employment for them, seems to be one of the ugliest problems which advancing civilisation brings along with it In this colony especially, it has always seemed to us that the system of state interference with undertakings and 111 drastic les which ought to be left to private effort by tending to choke individual exertion, and closing a number of enterprises to our)oungmen-makes mar 1 wage less and less possible for Victo- vans, and creates a grave social danger None of these questions, bearing so closely on woman s welfare, were dealt with or advanced in the least on Monday night Dr BIIOMHV, in start ing as far back as Deuteronomy, raised hopes that we should have had a sketch of the controversy from press tone times down to our own day He contributed certainly a morsel of subtle Biblical criticism when explaining to his hearers that though the covering of house property was originally supposed to be commoner than the covering of wives-in the second rendering of the Decalogue the wife was put before "the house" Unless we were sure that this was not due to the fluctuating value of house property in the interval, we could gather no lesson therefrom, except, indeed, a warning against taking things too literally for it is obvious that if the wife were posted in front of the house, in many familiar instances here, only the most hardy and courageous visitors would ever get in the than the garden gate No one will grudge the freest ventilation of the question, whether women ought to vote or not No harm is ever done by discussion, and in these days of feverish mental activity it liberates, as through a safety valve, much spleen and bitterness which might separate beneath the surface Ladies who enlist in this organisation will, if it is much talked about, team at all events the difficulties in the way of their proposal That is something, and certain of them will thus be better occupied than in penning letters to the newspapers suggesting somewhat revolting punishments for males who, as it happened, had been acquitted by a court of law The task before the Victorian Women's Suffrage Society is to show, in the first place, that there are female grievances which male legislators cannot 01 will not remedy 'Unity years ago JOHN SI a an MILL, III his "Subjection of Women," asked bitterly whether, if a women had votes we should still see wife beaters unpunished, married women's property absolutely at the mercy of the husband, and divorce only possible to the wealthy Since those words were written every reform hinted at has been granted by British legislators, who are still returned by a selfish masculine vote. If Mrs DuGDAle and their friends can move the first count in their indictment, they have next to show that giving the franchise to all the female members of the family would not being about greater mischiefs than we now a nature, that it would not entail, for instance, one of two very serious evils either the despotic control of the wife's and the daughter s votes by the house father, 01 else the still worse evil of divided house holds and bitter family antagonism There are already plenty of social, religious, and political hates dividing com munitions without adding a new and most unnatural strife, that between men and women, to the number the old radical fiction-that the bestowing of a privilege on persons notoriously unfit for it immediately inspires them with the capacity to make a good use of it-will no doubt serve its turn in the women's suffrage discussion goes on Unfortunately, the instantaneous inspiration there by would apply just as well to the claims of children to the suffrage Hutin at St ist in in his " social dynamics, seems to have actually recognised some loBical oblige tion of the self, and one of the oddest chapters he ever wrote asserts the child's claims to all but political equality with its parents Are not women incomplete citizens as children and Although immaturity is the disqualification in the latter case, is not sex really as strong a bar to placing women on the electoral roll as to their enlistment in the volun teammates? No lennndeisof the mental intellectual, and moral aches which our sisters boat will hide the fact that they do not and cannot fulfil all the duties of complete citizenship His sin in demand which Mrs DotDvM and Mrs Lowe reiterate for increased p otection from violence for women in these colonies is an indirect justification of the of i t that while man's obligation and duty are to shield the weak and defenceless from oppression, from outrage and from wrong, the right of the weak, defence less, and son effective citizen to vote as soon as she can legibly sign the candidates name is still a long way from general recognition of acceptance The attempt to induce Messrs Burling and SHLI III up to pose as religious matters because they have been fined in the Melbourne District Court for breach of the municipal regulation which prohibits processions through the streets is as foolish and as discreet as the proposition to raise a religious liberty defence fund for the benefit of the offenders Helicons liberty is in nowise imperilled by civic ordinances adopted for the preservation of the public peace Now is the cause of true religion likely to be advanced by the demonstrative performances of a band of enthusiasts mimicking the "pride, pomp, and circumstance of "glorious war We are told, upon authority that noC hi lstiansw will be lil or to dispute that the wisdom that is " from above is first pure, then peace " able, gentle, and easy to be entreated It produces no noisy demonstrations but brings about a change of heart and leads to it new life.

AV M'ITWWM, of Belfast who was an eyewitness of the mental epidemic and of its serious consequences, says "Insanity, generally in one of its worst forms monomania (and not in " accidently in other forms of insanity equally to be di titled, such as acute " mann) has been develop) ed to a fearful extent Spcal are granted, I may "assert that, horn unquestionable " sources, [ have come to the know " ledge of at least fifty such cases " within the last six months in this " immediate neighbourhood History is full of these strange explosions of miscalled 1 " i cisions excitement Among the Camisauls of the Cev enacts, the Anabaptists of Munster, and the Coin visionaries of London it assumed a variety of forms, some of them altogether grotesque othoisgiossly sensual, and others outraGeously criminal Nobody would think of attributing the massacres onel incendiarism perpetrated by the Gah mists of Ce venues, of the dancing mania of the Roman Catholic sisterhood of London or the mad excesses of the naked men and women, professing to be inspired by the Holy Ghost who ran about the streets of Amsterdam in lWi, calling them selves "the naked truth, to "pure " religion and undefiled ' Such wild outburst of fanaticism only serve to bring it into disrepute with those who hastily confound the follies of his deeds of its predecessors with the faith which they disfigure and the name which they dishonour But the mischievous lengths to which these opi donnes of religious " excitement are capable of conducting their victims, justify the guardians of the public peace in prohibiting demonstrations of the kind organised by the leaders of the Salvation Army If similar pro cessions say, for instance, that which is witnessed on the festival of Corpus Christi in some countries were got up by the Roman Catholic clergy of this city, would the municipal authorities be blamed for pie * eating them 1 Would their promoters be held up to public sympathy as religious martyrs, if they were summoned to the police court for marching through the streets of the city singing by may and intoning prayers, and would the advocates of Messrs.

We rather fancy not truly rational and well considered movement for the promotion of true re liDion, morality, public instruction, and social amelioration, commands our approbation, sympathy, and support The Rev CHARLES STRONG and the members of his congi egat tion showed what could be done in the way of teaching those who are inaccessible to the ordinary minis tiations of religion, and proved that 'such missionary work among the heathen of our population, and among the neglected and the outcast, could be prosecuted by unostentatious and jet efficacious methods, without any military parade, without public processions, and without " blowing a " trumpet' before them when they distributed then alms or earned the lessons of the Gospel, while practically illustrating its precepts, into the back streets and bye lanes of Melbourne And the same methods are open to the San a tion Army By pursuing them they are likely to effect much more permanent good than by stimulating a spasm of hysterical excitement, which will be transient in precise proportion to its violence If they follow the apostolic injunction, to live peaceably with all " mon,' they will carefully abstain from disturbing the public streets by their noisy processions, and will at the 'same time refrain from bringing religion into disrepute by proceedings which are regarded as little better than mount burglary by numbers of persons who are desirous of seeing genuine piety Flourish and Lucie ise A glimpse into a Government depart ment is not often obtained When it is, the result is an ally v shock to those innocent persons who have pictured in public office is the abode of peace and contentment thanks to Mr /ov, and the commission which was appointed at his instance light is now being lot into the Lunney Office with consequences that may fairly be described as bewilder So far, three witnesses have been examined Mr Tin OF WILKINSON, master in equity, is master in lunacy also, met Mr Wir KINNONS principal occupation in the office would appeal be to grumble unreservedly in the land of its that has sent him there He obtained no additional emolument when he was appointed master in lunacy, and he objects with emphasis to additional rule on these terms The chief clerk in mares Hut on one point Mr WILKINSON is one a, mile that is that his second 01 third clerk, Mr H LAUGH, IS worse than useless lins gentler m, wo no told, is " impertinent" and is a " spy " If he could be sent about his business it would appear as if even Mr WILKINSON s life in the office might be worth living Mt 'IAY I OH for his p at lopols these insinuations with scorn, and avers that Mr WIIMN SONS i el grievances that he does not Let 2000 per annum for his services for Mr WILKINSON, linnet CI, this witness feels son is while the chief clerk is the object of his men and contempt lim hull of that object no described is something temble He does not make the friends of the (unities pay up He allows fanatics who have money to be taken away and returned penniless He writes all means on his own responsibility 1 here is a mystery ions allusion to in impul steel accounts, which may or may not refer to the officer in question Unable to contain his righteous I mile client, Mr 1 vi con has penned reports which would have destroyed the peace of mind of any Attomoy Genet in less complacent than Mr KLIUI ni) We no not a happy f milly, ' confesses Mr Tudor, to the commission with a sigh The chief clerk (Mr. Rout in Au war.) is not it may be supposed, complimentary to Mr lv\iou He accuses that indi Mihid of making up for deficiencies in bookkeeping by the possession of police cal influence But, after all, Mr An IN seems to get on better with this gentleman in than he did with his predecessor " Business," he says between Mr. Herman sound itself was conducted " through the medium of written moves "we not being on speaking terms Mr " Jluoiii s was jo dons , I know too much " to suit him " The Chairman Did he knock you down ?

Mr Francis, who was acting assistant traffic manager during Mr Anderson s absence, will take charge of the traffic on the suburban lines, hitherto forming part of the district supervised by Mr Moore, who will now devote his attention exclusively to the Gipps land and Colac lines, Mr Kibble will continue as at present responsible for the traffic on the north eastern lines Mr Kirwan, stationmaster at Ballarat, will be appointed superintendent of the lines west of that city, Mr F Connor, stationmaster at Seymour, is to have the oversight of the lines north of Sandhurst, while the central district, comprising the main line through Castlemaine as far as Sandhurst, will be allotted I to Mr Moule, at present station master at Spencer street 'The increase in the number of districts is intended to be permanent, but the new appointments are made, as would he expected, on probation in selecting the officers to fill these positions the commissioners have been guided solely by a desire to secure efficiency of supervision, and with that object in view they have not hesitated, while giving due consideration to seniority of service, to choose the men who are in their opinion the best qualified for the work 'they have laid down a rule that the permanent appointment of the new super Undents will depend entirely on the safety and ability with which they manage the particular. sections of lines entrusted to their care.
