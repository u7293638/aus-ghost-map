Peculiar Vows. Often we have the letter of the vow evaded with some special reasoning, and the spirit then broken with; impunity. For instance, a modern Rip Van Winkle vowed that he would never drink another drop of liquor as long as he had hair on his head. A few nours later he was mot coming out of a barber's shop with a shaven poll. Damsels in love often make strange vows. We all remember the case of poor Miss Harrisham, in Dickens' story, who was so overcome by her lover's failure to appeal' at the wedding that : she ordered every- thing in the house to be unchanged as it had been on that hapless day. Years went by, and the wedding feast remained set on the table, the rich cakes mouldered and were eaten by the mice, while the poor, half-demented lady flitted in and out of the deserted rooms of the house like a ghost, always wearing . the white dress and veil which she had put on to welcome the faithless lover who never came. A similar case to this was that of a lady of high rank in England, who, being jilted by her lover, went to bed and vowed that she would never get up again, and kept her word for 20 years. A less excusable case than this was that of a man, who, finding that his wife was disposed to demand too much hard work from him, took to his bed and stayed. For 22 years this worthless fellow stayed between the sheets, while his wife waited on him and fed him with persistent devotion. Vows of perpetual silence are numerous, the only trouble being that those who neea this vow most do not take it. A Miss Caraline, in 1840, vowed that she would never speak another word td any human being, because she had a quarrel with her lover. For 35 years, until j the day of her death, she was never known to utter a word.
