QUE MELBOURNE LETTER. ^ " ft'-*:"" TSOH OCB OWH COSSESPOKDHHT; Wednesday Evening. The reaper Death -has been very busy lately, and his scythe has done considerable execution amongst the old colonists, who appear to be rapidly passing away from our midst. The Hon. James Forester Sullivan, M.L.A. for Collingwood, is seriously ill and not expected te live out to-day. Mr. ' Sullivan was -one of the giants of the past, and as ;good exemplification of the^uddenness with which public men vanish as could he found. "Who but JamesJForrester Sulhvsn in the tdd timet ! He was a tower of strength in. Sandhurst, a mighty man of Quarfcsopolis. But when he resigned his seat and went home to America his descent began. "When v j » -c- 1. , , iLrS^SJET*^J^Jr^^ time he found himself a Bip van Winkle. ! Other men had come to the front, and he was forgotten. After a while he stood for Collingwood, and was elected. Since then he has haunted the housej a shadow of himself, a voice andnothing more. - Like & ghost he wandered about the halls of Parlitanent, where he had once been all powerful, unheeded; James Forrester Sullivan was an Irishboywho -left the Emeraldlsleearly and went to the United States, where he roughed it in the backwoods. It was there that he contracted the disease which eventually killed him. He came to Tictoria on the finding of gold, and pitched his tent in Sandhurst, where he kept a wine and spirit store. At that time oratory was in its palmy days, and the voices of Benson, J. F. Sullivan," W. W. D. C. Denoran and Captain Brown were heard at- the great meeting at Yiew' Point during the Eureka Stockade excitement. Mr,-S uliivan was one=0 f -the-great-men of -th Local Courts, and a prominent member of what was known as the Fighting Mining Board. He was also chairman of tiie Council, and afterwards mayor;. After s time he was elected for M&ndurang;, and became a member- of Sir JameB M'Culloeh's first Ministry in 1864. His rise was rapid, his fall as sudden, • .... - ; Political matters are extremely nncertain. The count out of the Honse last sight has this significance that it shows that -the Ministry had expectedthe Opposition to give Way, and that expectation proving falladous, they did not know what to do, and preferred br^aiang'-up &nd;:consulting their supporters to-day. . I have carefully looked over "May, that great Parliamentary authority, and I find-that-he dis&ictly; \- says - that a- small minority of the House can protract the proceedings/or im tindejmite period, even if:.the standing orders are-suspended. How the stonewalls to ha heaten dowii jioone outside tiie Mhusterial jing. caa tell at present,.and J really think-3mt that oring has only a &aht; duty to accede to the ^voice of .the people, which .has -declaimed for a dissolution.
