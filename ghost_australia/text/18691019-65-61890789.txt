(Stance aub gicfjmonli famines, TUESDAY, OCTOBER IO, 1809. WJIETHBTI the Clarence and Richmond district has guincd much by thc alteration in tho Elect- oral Law is u question not easily answered, the petition, from the electors of the district asked ibr five members, and one additionul has been granted-making two in all. At the present time, perhaps, tho only course is to put up with it, but it is only^shufHing thc question off to somo future timeX Had ono boen granted for tho -'Lower.C larence^ne for the Upper Clarence, and ono for Ihe Richmond^ and Tweed, it might have satisfied trre- elpc^ors-ior a time, but con- sidering tho size and population of this district, as compared with some hfUhc moro central ones, tho paucity .of representatives musjjjstriko any unprejudiced person as unfair. It is absolutely impossible that one person can represent thc wants and desires of a population, spread over such, un immense tract of country, and following such a diversity of pursuits, to their satisfaction, even though ho may bo PÍIEMIBU. At present every thing has to be done, roads want making, bridges building, und tho rivers improving for the purposes oftaavigation, and two members aro appointed t\urgo the claims of thc district on. the Oove&rnVit.; There is scarcely a . dis- trict in the colgpjwi wlvli so much is required ' and so little donc-\he rlmàn and rivers aro still for thc most part in tV:ir primitive state, and the former-with the exception of the Newton Boyd Hoad-aro for a greaVpart of the year, almost impassable. Thc want pligood roads is severely felt in thc district, thousands of acres of land, admirably adapted for cultivation, are lying idle, simply.because of the difficulty of conveying tho produce to market, and could this difficulty bo overcome, the already large number or weekly selections, would bc increased ; thc impossibility of conveying the crops to the banks of tho rivers being on effectual bar to thc selection of any back countfv. The rapidity with which tho resources of theSiistrict have been so fur deve- loped, is due to thflyenoiçy and enterprise of tho people ttlone.-wuj, nut «¿»tiny assistance they have /received froinVthe Government. They have in' the last few years literally forced them- selves into notice, and m», when the establish- ment of such on important branch of industry, as the cultivaton.of the sugar cane, is fairly accomplished, nnd the population so rapidly in- creasing, publicNroads, bridges, and ferries, aro absolutely necessary, and to obtain- these, for a district conla'ning about 10,000 square' miles, and 11,000 inhabitants, fyo members arc to be ?returned to-Parliament. Con they be expected, to represent tha""wTmts\ of'such a population, scnttcrod over a district with such a diversity of climate ?. Can they Mjo expected to know what is,required? And vf they do know, can they hopo to give satisfaction to constituencies having such a variety of pursuits and interests? .By> such a nWTfe of dealing with the question, it is merely evaded, the. ghost is only laid not exorcised, niidVvill assuredly rise again in a short time to\li\turb'tlie^rièace of the community. If eighty members Naroî not sufficient, is it impossible to increase that number because, some years ago, when tho population of the colony was confined to about two-thirds of tho area over which it now spreads, that number was fixed on ? -Tho following return, taken from the Empire, will show tho necessity of equalising tho representation on tho basis of population, and if this continues to increase in this district at theVate it has for the last few years, and as it assuredly will, now that it is known that the Bugar> manufacture is a success, evon this will bo.onljXa ihmporary adjustment ? of the difficulty.

Tims Increasing tho number hy eight-making a total of eighty members for tho whole colony, Rome of tho facts disclosed by tho above return show In a very striking manner tho Inequality of tho proiont «tato of tho représentation. For Instance, tho electorates of Windsor and the Hawkesbury return togothor thrco moruben, while both con- stituencies united bava only 2171 eluctors. In contrast with this, tho eleoloroto of tho Upper Hunter, which only returns onoruomber, has2400electors ; Liverpool l'lalm(nlsoone member) 2308 ; Newtown (ono), 2417. Tho Cilcbo and several other elec- torates afTord almost equally striking contrasts. Again. Pater- son, with only 683 electors, returns a member : while tho adjoining electorate of Patrick's Plain baa lor.n electors, and but a singlo member ¡ and other electorates afford still moro remarkable results. A role, with 2270 electors, hu only a ?Ingle member-tho same as Goulburn, with lint 810, Tho following electorates, vis., (toulbiirn, Lower Hunter, Wost , Macquarie, Kost Mnttlund, Morpctth, tho Murray, Narollon, Pater- son, and Windsor, return nf no members, with a total constituency of lint OBftl, or nn avornRn ol 705 electors to eaeh representativo. Parramatta ls still moro dlvprojiortlniiato lia\lngtwomoinbers for 127.1 constituents ; willie (ti) say iwthlngof tluseelectoratcswlilch ; H la nowproiwsed to altor) Ilruldwood. with a singlo mcmbor. lias 27(Ut electors, and a similar slnto of things oxlsts In several cithor olcctaratos. The most sti Iking contrasts In tho whole Hst, however, are afforded by Parramatta and tho Hawkesbury, having collectively four members for 2806 constituents ¡ while Ka«t Sydney, with tl(Mf>7 electors, has only tho same number of representatives, and tho Uolii-llelds West, with 4000 electors, baa but ono member i so that a Parramatta or llawkeib iry mon haa Just four times as niuoli political power as an o euler of East Sydney, and six times a> much as a Uold-flolds West elector. I Tho Clnronco ia not mentioned in this nnnlysis, it is included"',' in thtiso olootorutes I which it ls now proposed to nllcr," thereby I insinuating that thoir claims are disposed, of, that they have their slinre in tho' représentation of tho country, and therefore ought to bc satis- fied, a glance, however, at the , return' shows that this is not the case; were the district equally divided,' which lt is not, there would he one representativo to 1490 electora, showing that " The' following electorates, viz., Goulburn, Lower Hunter, West Macquarie, East Matt land, Morpeth, the Murray, Narellan, Paterson, and Windsor," have twice the political powor that the Clarence and Kichmond has, with its extra member, and tho same may be Haid of Patramatta, the Hawkesbury, and tho Gold Fields North Mudgee, and the Bogan have both been granted an additional représentative although their population'is considerable less than that of tho Clarence, while Camden and Central Cumberland have for a long time had two representatives for a smaller population than this distriht ; these districts are,- however, nearer the greatWitre of tho colony, and this, moy be'considcreoNsufftcient reason for allowing them to exercise a much" greater control over the Legislature than\hó''faí off districts , of the Clorence ¿nd llichmörVl. .
