THE DESERTED HUT AT LOWE'S GULLY. When daylight fades, And desert shades Around the hut are creeping ; Forsaken here, Well might I fear— Lone nightly vigils keeping. Each 'cacia tree, It seems to me, Is drooping, broken hearted ; A spirit broods About the woods— The ghost of joys departed. All. night the rain With ceaseless strain Is on the rafters beating ; A surly wail Is on the gale— Unsleeping, fierce, and fleeting. I never thought That it was aught But sunshine here, and roses ; Since one has left, 'Tis now bereft Of sunshine in the heart reposing. 'Twas she who smiled, On wood and wild, And made the place so tidy ; Now up and down All trace of neatness hiding. When she was by Blue was the sky, And all things smiled with gladness. Now she is gone 'Tis all forlorn, And wears a smile of sadness. Why need I stay Upon this way, For pleasant old time greeting ; The homeless gale Tells but one tale— That is of grief repeating. No one will wait Beside the gate For absent friend or lover. The parting kiss, So fraught with bliss, And happy moment's over. Oh, blessed powers ! May happy hours Be her's, be me befriended : Oh, may she live, With smiles to give To him whose song is ended. W. F.
