ALL SAINTS CSUBOE. THE ceremony of laying the corner-stone of the new church of All Saints, on Wickham terrace, was performed yesterday afternoon, by His Excellency the Governor, Colonel Blackall, assisted by the Right Rev. Dr. Tufnell, Anglican bishop of Brisbane. The Revs. T. Jones, J. Matthews, J. Sutton, and J. Mosely, also took part in the ceremony. Considering the unpropitious weather, the attendance was larger than was expected, comprising about three hundred persons. The rain, which had been coming down pretty heavily all the afternoon, ceased falling just previous to the commencement of the service, and held off till its conclusion. His Excellency, accompanied by his suite, arrived on the ground at half-past 4 o'clock, and was received at the western end of the building by the Hon. J. Douglas, M.L.C., trustee of the church, Messrs. F. O. Bryant and J. R. Dickson, churchwardens, Mr. Suter, architect, and several members of the congregation. The Rev. T. Jones, incumbent of the church, then read the following address to His Excellency : ALL SAINTS, BRISBANE. To His Excellency S. W. BLACKALL,, Esq , Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Queensland and its Dependencies.

Gentlemen I thank you for your expression of personal regard contained in your address, and of loyalty to her Majesty, whom I have the honor to represent in this colony. It affords me great pleasure to follow Her Most Gracious Majesty's example In assisting to promote such a work of piety and benevolence as the building of this church, by laying the corner-stone and my instructions from Her Majesty enjoin me in every way to further the interests of religion. I trust the proposed building will answer all the purposes to which it will be devoted, and that those who may hereafter assemble within its consecrated walls may be duly impressed with the necessity and advantage of Divine worship. In this undertaking you have my earnest sympathy, with an anxious desire that all your endeavors to con- secrate this church to the service of God may be crowned with success. And, thanking you most sincerely for the expression of your good wishes and prayers for my own health and welfare, that I may be enabled to enjoy those blessings which God may bestow upon me, I venture to assure you that no efforts shall be spared by me (and I trust that, by the Divine grace I may be empowered to carry out my intention to promote peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety, in this portion of Her Majesty's dominions. I have the honor to be, your most obedient and faithful servant, SAMUEL BLACKALL, Governor. A procession was then formed, entering the area of the building by the south- western door, headed by the before-named office-bearers in the church, the architect, the Revs. T. Jones, J. Matthews, J. Sutton, and J. Mosely, and his Lordship the Bishop, and followed by the Governor and his suite, and members of the congregation. His Excellency and the clergy were conducted to the front of the stone at the eastern end of the building, members of the choirs of St. John's and All Saints conducted by Mr Atkinson on the harmonium singing two verses of the 100th psalm. The Berrico specially appointed for the occasion was then commenced by the Bishop. I At the conclusion of the 84th psalm, the following document was signed, and placed with copies of the Brisbane Courier and Queensland Express, a carte-de- visite of the old building, and the coins of the realm, in a glass bottle, and finally deposited in a cavity of the stone prepared to receive it Queensland. Australia. ALL. SAINTS Church, BRISBANE. The Corner Stone of the Church in which this Scroll is placed was, in accordance with Ancient usage, Solemnly laid in due form by His Excellency SAMUEL WENSLEY BLACKALL, Governor of Queensland, April 6th, 1859, In the presence of and assisted by The Right Revd. Em\n. WINDHAM TUINILL, D.D., Lord Bishop of the Diocese, The Clergy. Trustees, and Churchwardens, The Clergy of the City, The Mayor of Brisbane, Chief Officers of State, Members of both Houses of the Legislature, And of the Civil Service, and Others.

The lime having been prepared, and spread on the stone by the Governor, the stone, which had been suspended a height of three feet above its final resting place, was lowered in three successive falls of twelve inches each. When placed in its proper position, and tested with the level and plumb the Governor, giving the stone three successive knocks with the maul, pronounced it " level, upright, and duly laid," adding, " In the faith of Jesus Christ, we place this corner-stone, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." The service was then proceeded with, those present being invited, previous to its conclusion, to place their offer- is on the corner-stone. The amount thus raised, which was £22, will go to the building fund, and is the first money actually collected yet for that object. The BISHOP then delivered a short address, in which he gave a brief history of the previous building, and the movement which had resulted in the commencement of the erection in connection with which they were there assembled. He also stated that he hoped that the building fund would soon be entirely raised, as the church could then be consecrated, which could not be done till it was out of debt, and concluded by cordially thank ing His Excellency for his kindness in taking part in the work. His Lordship concluded by pronouncing the benediction, and dismissing the assemblage. The new church will be built on the exact site of the old structure, which it was found necessary to remove, principally through its not containing sufficient accommodation for the congregation. The enlargement will provide 120 now sitting, and, when completed, the church will accommodate 600 people. The length of the previous building will be increased by 20 feet, the height of the walls by 6 feet, and of the roof by 8 feet. Altogether the wave will be 86 feet long by 42 wide the walls 16 feet high and the chancel 20 feet long by 15 feet wide. The ventilation will be improved, and the means of approach and exit greatly increased. No ornamentation of any kind is contemplated, the trustees being unable to incur any expenditure not absolutely required beyond that of securing a building adapted for the purpose for which it is raised. The form of the previous building has been adhered to, and the character of the ancient basilica carried out as far as possible in the details. The style of architecture adopted may be called ltalian-Gothlo, freely treated to meet the requirements of the climate. Though there will be nothing imposing or pre- tentious about it, the church, when completed, I will be one which will do credit to the city. It is only built on a corner of the ground belonging to it, there being much more available space between it and the adjacent Presbyterian Church. When the old church, however, was in course of erection, it was built on that spot in the expectation that the congregation would soon be able to put up a large and handsome church alongside, on the ground allotted to them, in which case the old building could have been used as a school- house and it is probable that some such idea | now actuates the authorities of that church. We understand that the new church, when completed, will be fenced in. The contract price of the work is £1200, and it is to be finished in about three months from the present time. Mr. | R. G. Suter is the architect, and Messrs. Hely and Polwarth the builders. The new church has been named " All Saints " by the Bishop, who was requested to give it its designation. We have been requested to state, for the information of those members of the congregation who were not present at the ceremony yesterday, that the office-bearers of the church will be happy to receive any contributions they may be disposed to give.
