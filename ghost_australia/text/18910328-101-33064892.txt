I, like Dr. Johnson, de- tested puns, and it was ihb'bane of my \- óxfetence to hear my own nf ute /.fiendishly \- 'tortured and twisted for sb base a purpose. « rdii may? think it was a small misery,: but ' to j me. itv was very real, aud it was some- times irritated almost to endurance.-. My ' n&foe; was Samuel-or, more familiarly, ; Sam-Hughes. Vile puns, such as " Sam 1 Hughes is amusing himself," and " Sam's : all right when you're 'used' to him," fell f daily, hourly, on my tortured ear. ' .... .One of the worst offenders; in this ; respect was a so-called friend of mine, by , name Joseph Wigsby. He was aloud,' : vulgar man, with a face that most people > described .'as *' jolly." I thought, and stijl think,-that it was a round, rod, fat, low ffcype of the1 face.. ,Ho was always laughing,; not quietly and decently, but uproariously. He had a great reputation as a> "funny man," and the loud " Hal ha? ha 1" with which he invariably clinched his own jokes went a long way ' to wards: -' keeping ' up - this reputation. People-called it an "infections" lâùgh, and Ï -avoided it as I would avpid an infectious disease. ' A. ^few; summers ago I decided that,: . rathpr than be idle, I would enter some, profession, and, after .mature considera- tion, .fixed upon the Bar." Naturally fond of study, I threw my whole heaj-tinto ipre {taring myself for: the. examinations, and« ike most enthusiastic; people, I rather overdid it. My nerves (always a weak Îmint in me) gave way under the strain of ate ¡honre and hard reading, and I was reluctantly compelled to desist. My doctor ordered me to . go to Switzerland* and there recuperate by the combined aid: of mountain air and complete rest. Soeing the absolute' necessity for a short respite from my toil, I took, his prescription with alacrity, made - up uiy mind to dismiss cares.and worries from Jay thoughts, and was seen revelling in the peace aud quiet of B Swiss village.
