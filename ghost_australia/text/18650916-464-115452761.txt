'were also most 'assiduous in assisting the nuns to prepare the girls. On Sunday morning the children assembled in their respective schools the girls dressed in. white with veils, and the boys neatly attired, many of them in black. ' They then proceeded in procession to the church where Father Coll celebrated Mass at half-paSt eight. During the offering of the Holy Sacrifice; ? the chidren were most devout. Immediately ; after the Domine Non Sum Dignus Father Coll. turned towards the children and addressed them a few words upon the great blessing which they w,ere about to receive. He gave them the advice . which St. Mary Magdalen of Pazzi gave to her community to have purity of soul, purity of ' mind, and purity of body, whenever they., approached to receive their Blessed Lord in Holy' Communion. After recommending them to make acts of Faith and Contrition, and to place full confidence in their dear Lord he told theni to approach the altar rails imbued with the spirit ? of humility and love for Jesus. The Holy Communion was then administered, first to the boys and afterwards to the girls. When this was over Father Coll again addressed the. children telling them that they had that day '; , - received the greatest blessing which it was. possible for them to receive. Their Divine .; Saviour had taken up his abode in their -hearts,' they could ask Him all those graces thatf would, ' be necessary for them to keep their souls pure from mortal sin. Let them make good ' ah& -?' . pious resolutions and possessing the treasure. J which they did they would be enabled to fulfill \ them. Above all let them be assiduous in- their.,. * morning and evening prayers and obedient' W, their parents. This will draw down daily,,: blessings upon them, and enable them to keep ,' their souls free from sin. Mass was then con-: eluded, and after a short time spent in thanks giving the children retired in the same order to ? '.' their school-room, where by the generosity 'of Father M'Carthy and some of the parishioners, a sumptuous breakfast was prepared for them. When this part of the business was over the children again prepared to proceed to the Church to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. ',-,'? At eleven o'clock the children again assembled- . in ,the, church shortly after which Ms Grace, , attended by Fathers Quirk, M'Carthy and' Dwyer entered. His Grace having taken his \\- seat upon the gospel side of the. altar mass, was V commenced by Father Coll during which the- ''. choir sang, several hymns to the Holy Ghost; '-?)'?'? When mass was over the Archbishop, ..having ' t taken his seat in front of the altar, proceeded ' according to the universal custom to instruct;, those about to receive confirmation. He told/ them that they were about to receive the, same Holy Spirit. which had descended upon the ,7 Apostles on the feast of Pentecost. It was that r same sacrament of which they read an account^ , in the Acts of the ApostlesVhere Peter- and ~ . John were sent down to those who had .been ,.'?;,? baptized, and haying laid their hands,uppii them.3 . they received the Holy Ghost. He would' also n V lay his hands upon them, and by the authority; ,- ; committed tb the chief pastors of the church/ jjie ; .- would invoke the Holy : Spirit to . descend upon- .', '..r them. His Grace next alluded to the wonderful /. effects which, this sacrament produced iipon,ttte,D - ;. Apostles, for from being tim^d and fearful of the . _; ,?-? gentiles, they boldly .came forward and preached /? / the' gospel of their divine master, Through t^r '. ? efficacy of this sacrament , they would ,eacfi re- ?-- ceive grace to . fulfil the .duties .which would dg-.:c vblyq upon them through life.. .
