LONDON TOWN TALK. (.BOM OUtt OVO! COItnESrONVENT.) LONDON. FEB. 13. The science of advertising has of late attained quite a new development It has been hitherto the boast of the proprietors of patent medicines, and, indeed, of those who bave attained great popularity for their wares o£ any kind, that the y irtues of the same, if not acknowledged, have been at all events made known throughout the world, tint, in the moat picturesque and solitary places, immense posters may be seen pasted to rock and tree, extolling the miraculous properties of tho bug destroyer or the corn eradicator Not content yvith this a number of the3e enterprising proprietors baie now clubbed togetuer and despatched an individual in their interests to visit the uttermost parts of the world in person, and to acquaint them with those blessings of civilisation which (although patent) have been hitherto unknown to thom, and which, although enjoy ing a European reputation, are BtiU unappreciated in the heart of Africa, or among the benighted inhabitants of Tobnesia Before me lies an excellent imp of the world, printed for this unrivalled com mercial travellers instruction, with his route marked m red ink ( is though it were a geo frraphical boundary), and a table showing " approximate dates of arrival and departure, distances, time occupied on the road, duri lion of stay in each locality, and population In Sourabaya, for example, he stays no less than fourteen days-induced thereto, no doubt, by the place hiving 100,000 inhabitants-whereas to King Georges Sound, he makes a llymg visit of three days only IIis modes of conveyance, which of course are very various aro also set down, and it seems that he will spend six mouths in travelling, and 19 months in pushing his wares, mai ing a total absence of 25 months He started on tho 15th of January, and upon my life I almost wish Iliad gone with him That is now, of course, a lost opportunity, though it should be noticed that any intend îng advertiser haB only to communicito with bim "at post oflico till called for, it this or that town, according to date, to have lus wishes at once attended to Only I hardly see how lie can send out EpecimeiiB of his wares If they aro iron churches, for example, or even thal formidible bedstead, made so familiar lo us by the illustration it every railway station, with that amazing intima tion underneath it, "Free by post." If this king of commercial travellers has any sense of humour, he must continually be in danger of Buflocatiou when he considers the nicon gruousuess of what he carries with linn to Bell with the wants of the inhabitants among f whom he finds himself Among his thousand specimens he must occasionally take out the wrong one at the wrong place lo produce Ins patent cod liver oil in Newfoundland, for instance, would be like taking a Bpecimen of coal to Newcastle, while to oller goloshes to a naked popula tton, where there is also no i am, w otild bo obviously an empty compliment Among the cannibal races (unless they are \ ery careful in the selection of their food) he will pro bably find a good run upon Ins "digestive tablets, but, on the oilier hand, if tender mid toothsome, tho enterprising young man may fall avictim to their appetites,without the satisfaction of knowing that he will diijagree with them , on the contrary, lie has curried with him the antidote to any unpleas mt sen- sation which he might reasonably haye boped to cause them I picture him to myself recommending a patent gibus (crush hat), or a cream for the complexion, to Ills Majesty of tho 'longa Islands, and delicately suggesting that a suit of court plaister w oultl bo better than none His principal goods, however, it would seem, are m the medical line, and if ho were but a liorna opath one could imagine lum supplying the whole human race, not only with speci mens of perfect cures but with the drugs themselves, and in suflicient quantities-a whole ounce perhaps for the Celestial Lui piro D.B it is ao very populous-to set mankind upon its legs again (except where their modo of progression is on all fours) from the Iropic of Capricorn to that of Cancer One of the tilings that makes us pause when we arc about to congratulate ourselves upon the progress of civilisation is the reflection that human nature is much the Samens it was m regard to its meannesses Cruelty and oppression, at least as exercised I by the authority of the law, have ceased m | the land, and gentleness and chanty havo made some way with us in place of them But envy of the successful, and hatred of the just, and malice against the good are as rife as ever In particular, a man bas only to have done something to win lum the lov e of the great majority of his fellow creatures to become a target for the slander of the minority Upon the vv hole I suppose there is no Englishman w ho has giv en such pleasure to his country men, has soothed the bours of pain, and Bvveetencd the hours of leisure, and especially who has cultivated kindness and benev olence so much as Charles DickenB Iho nation at large, it is true, aro grateful to lum, yet many persons of position and mlluence seem to derive a great satisfaction in Blanderine, his private character One hears more malicious lies told of lum than of any man , all set agoing by the onslaught of a foul mouthed news paper before the dead man vv as cold m his grave, but winch have never lost their momentum And now, because, I suppose Garibaldi is acknowledged to be tho most disinterested and generous human creaturo on the faco of the earth, it lias become lus turn to be slandered Because ho has sought to be divorced from a wife with whom bo has never lived, and who acknowledged at the church door, though unfortunately after the ceremony, that she was alreidy un faithful to lum, and married him under false pretences, ho is held up forsooth as an im moral character In his gross ignoranco, or in his wanton malice, one writer, I seo, lias oven compared Ins case with that of Lord Nelson It is difficult for simple folks to treat the statements of the press as they would treat those of individuals, but they should leam that to the jealous and the vile it is just as caBy to print n falsehood ns to write or speak it A niOBt alarming advertisement appeared in the papers last week A gentleman asserts that ho possesses or wishes to recommend a "young and vigorous solicitor, who, on appin, ti on, will be prepared to carry on any description of professional proceedings, "no matter how litigious ' I was not so sanguine aa to believe that the general health of our attorneys was failing in anyway, but it is \ory dishenrtoning to hear of the existonco of this legal tiger or tigerling, "young,' " vigor Otis,' mid thirsting for blood Only think «hat ho will be when ho has once tasted it, got his first case, smelled costs, and become a man eater' lo my mind tho abov o news waa even worse than the intelligence that Ina fellow midshipmen had tattooel the nose ot our future kini, with an indelible anchor lor after all he will boa sea king, and so far tho ornament will be appropriate It would have been very much harder

families -litre is sometimes a difficulty in knowing what profession a young pnnco belonga to e en after ho has entered it Ho does not n »avs distinguish himself m it very much W a mark of this kind would show what bo was intended for over so much more than tlie crosses and ribands with which he is now /«decked, and the wearing of which is to the general eye unintelligible A couple of swords crossed at the bridge of the nose would, for example, at once indicate that he was meant to be a field marshal I have been reading with somo envy an account of the incomes made last year by the members of the 'lheatro Français, none of whom get less than £? lOO a year-better pay than the 10 Ministers of the Republic receive or the Prefect of the Some or the Archbishop of Pana lins disproportion does not disturb me, because after all actors mid actresses are paid for what they do anil at lowest for pleasing the public whereas an official is paid for occupying .> post whether he fills it well or ill But what I confess annoys me is to see the immense fortunes made by some sudden turn of the wheel of commerce, or some lue] y Iluke in hitting the taste of the day A merchant tailor as he cills himself, waa boasting the other day in my hearin" that he had made £10 000 in three years by in venting a fashionable overcoat for ladies' How small are the guns of genius, oven of the first order as compard w îth this * I feel it bitterly, dear Mr Editor, I do in. deed, though m public I wear a mask If tho Spiritualists can ever revive spiritualism itself they will prove their case, for the fact is the thing is dead Any thing more melancholy and contemptible than the apology put forward by the council of the Pritiah Isational Association of Spiritualists in reply to the charges of Sir G Sitvielland Mr Von Buch it is impossible to conceive Ihey can only say that the medium whose malpractices were exposed by these two gentlemen had imposed upon themselves for ever so long, and upon Mr Crookes, IIS, who had "exhaustively tested her for a series of years They can "only regret that in this case v.c , as though any caBe, no1 exhaustively tested, was likely to give more convincing results I have myself had a large experience of spiritualistic circles and have no hesitation m asserting that any person whatever who receives money for his (supposed) commum cations with the other world is an impudent knave, I say nothing of those who believe m him, except that they belong to another category -hat the vices and follies of the aristocracy aro imitated by the middle classes, and ev cntually descend to the lower, ia well un derstood , but it ia shocking to think that the innocent brute creation has at last begun to be conuptcd by humanity A Clydesdale filly

reprobate it Vi hy should a Beast Show Association be more ince in these matters than human beinRS' Has not a husband a ri|,lit to object to a filly-I mean a young Hely-who induces lum to believe that her tresses are her own when they are false ones' 1\ ly her case ia even a worse one, for is there the least probability that the false ones were inserted after the judging was over' W hat an
