Meteor Shower at the Mauritius. About 7 p.m. several members of tha Bov Mr. M'lrrino'e family, happening to turn their faces towards tho north, immediately observed a number of bright meteors, and in a short timo they counted 200 . Lateron, Mr. M'Irvine and two other observers oounted 700 in three quarters of an hour, although tho skv was muoh overcast to thowest and north and slightly totho east. Betwoen 8.46 and 0 p.m., Mr. M'Irvine and Mr. Hollway oounted 160 passing along a narrow dear epaoe just above Orion. From 9 till, midnight tha sky was several times quite overcast, and as the clouds olear£d away the .meteors oould bo seen faintly through the mist, gliding? along ghost- like. Between 11.31 and 1 i.bQ Mr. M'Irwino oounted ? 180/ whidi' ap pearecJ in an unclouded space between Orion and the* zenith. Tho sky was oloudod towards the nortfc the wholo evening-, and the meteors seemed to oome from under that cloud, and, with few exceptions, they all travelled towards the south. Occasionally, a small one, needle like, darted now towards the south-east, now toward sthe south-west, but none were Boon going back, or even so far aside ns east or -woBt. Most of the meteors were small and needle-like, of a whitish oolour, with paths extending from 6' degrees to 40 degrees, although some Boomed1 to appear sad vanish instantly without perceptible move ment. The meteors movod quiokly, xx-6 unlike arrows approaching the target in an archery competition. The very largest travelled slowly across 30 degrees to 50 degrees, and stme of them were blue, some white, some red. Many of them looked h'ke oometo, and every now and' then it was noticed that the head— which was very distinct — suddenly vanished, while the double-winged train (20 degrees to 40 degrees-, or more, in length) still moved on.
