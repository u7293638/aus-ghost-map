Colonel Hamlet had been alfianced for some time to Miss Opholia Polonius, daughter of Judge Polonius, of the Supremoe Court of Denmark. Colonel Hamlet imagined he had hoard a mouse behind a screen, and, seizing a carv ing-knife from the dinner-table, plunged it into the screen, behind which Judge Polonius was concealed, to keep Colonel Hamlet from mischief. Judge Polonius was killed by the knife. An evening or so afterward, at some private theatricals, Colonel Hamlet behaved so rudely that his mother, uncle, and Miss Ophelia Polonius were compelled to leave the room.
