Then how marvellona wee the change? the Jong swell ran like folds of liquid lighs to the north ; the trade wind! soft and hot as the 'lips of an Indian girl, blew abeam. It wasall a crystal clearness of tropioal light, blue say over the mast heads, touched here and there by a woolly rag of white cloud and water azare betwixt the swells-laughitng in spartk ing waves which caressed the schooner's bows with snow.like floersr and which raised cootl ounds all about her and in the sir., Eight belle were made. Hirem dieappeare4, the men went to dinner; Stone walked the deck and Fortesoessat litless, pale, eyes full of yearning and fixed ahead where he deemed the Island lay, and where the clear nlue of the sky met the softer blue of the ocean-sitll the same unbroken Junotion that it had been for days and weeks, an ever receding con tinuity, out of which nothing but faith and hope could have crashed' the mockery of Iteratnion. Hiram came on deck with a piece of paper in hie hand. Stone drew near. ' Thil is where we was at noon, sir,' sald the captain., Forteoue read aloud: 'Sixty five degrees ten miles east longitude ; fifteen degrees three mile. authb latitude.'' ' 'The old bucket's' gt the scent ' cried. Stone, ' Whip along, you jade l Itain't fur SHow'far? ' asked Forteacue, In a voice that trembled. 'esmse ide o' five hundres mitse.' answered HIram.

'Ay.' growled old Breeches, who was sitting under the hatch, and whose natural eournese of ezpreesion took an inimitable character from its peculiar -accentuation by the fline mating shades and. tones of. light ooceiooed bythe vesel's movemente. 'That's all very well, mate, but what you've got to consider Is, yo seigned on for a hieland in thbl here oceao, and ontil they there island's comed across your bargain ain't ful.filled up.' Red this view been applicable only to the cook, its expression would have excited a general laugh; but as it concerned all hande It created a very different emotion, and Jobony, Joe Hall, and Henry Sawyer starrd with faces of real dismay at EIeeahes. ' Ye're wrong, Bill,' exclaimed she cook. ' The attuation of that island must ha' been knowed afore we started. When we arrive at the part where it's knowed to be, an'it ain't there, then itll be one of two things for thie here child,' tapping his- bare, mosesy breast with hie fat hand, 'either hoes or the reason why we don't.' iWet,' observed Breeches, who, having, delivered himself of a disagreceble opinion, did not think it the less his duty to intensify it because it sold as much against himself as the othere, 'ler the island not be where Bill Stone says it is, en' you knock off', an' see what the magistrates 'II teli ye if- ye have to go to law for your wages.' 'What's the good 'arguing 7' ' sch Dock, lighting a pipe, with an impatient poffiog of the lobanoc smoke. ' It isn't proved yet ths Stone's wrong.' ' Ah,' remarked the ordinary seaman Hall, speaking with his month full, ' ye see, Jim, you wasn't at the helm when the parson reads out the figures and the mate walks aft; If yer had been ye'd ha' noticed the smile the cap'n cast after him.'

' I war once al?ug with a capt'o as, wee given to calling the mate by that word when they quarrelled.' Well, if it means eneering.likes. a I say, it's the word,' said Hall. 'Even,' broke in the cook,- who had evidently been turning over points of law in hie mind, * if we was bound by the articles to make an island whict ain't to be found, I'll venture to may, hard as the law is noon sailors, that nothin' onpleaeans cosidl follow the crew's resolve to stop the easch on the srounds that the parson's a loonatio end Bill Sone not mucah hetter.'
