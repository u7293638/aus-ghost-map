f u A -'CORRSspoSljMfiB;-7 141 ; |;'j THE PRESS BILL AND MR, G/ SMYTTt V your issue of. Saturday, I observe a Jotter from the Hbn. GfcMge .Siflytbj. relative to j As:ho has left it to 'his friends and constituents tb.say if ho :hSS fairly met the charge, I: think it but; right tb that /gentleman that an iinpartialJrevioW snbuld be taken "of the contiictiDg statements between him and you. i Leaving out the pairing question, tnfcrb are but two jioints,— trilling in themselves, hut ini- portant frbm the cround assumed, as it leaves the constituents, of Mr Smyth and" your readers no alternative -but to choose between 'unbending accuracy and wilful misrepresentation. Mr Smyth states in his letter, " tliero are no .errors in dates, and I- challenge you to point Put one >" to this you appond.a note, reiterating. thrit ho is wrong in the.'aates.. I examiued tho letter that forms tho subject of dispute, and I at once discovered two palpable errors. - In ono casd, two different dates are put to the same day of/' tho week,' and in another tho date is Wrong;'1 1 It seems almost inctediblo that a ibarristor, , skillcjl ifi detecting flaw's, cannot, 'detect errors so fla grant. . ... ! : v Tho next point to be disposed of is the : alleged: change of opinion of Mr Smyth. I niay, state that X -ty'as , present, at the Preit Bill meeting iii . tho Market House ; I had spoken .ptyviously, to Mr Smyth on the subject, as had also several, other ' gentlemen ; we in fact conversed with each bluer about. what.herhad said, for he .'hail told us all unresbrvedlythat ho Approved of thb bill. .When ho ascended the platform to address tho meeting, I wns certainly astounded by his; publicly , announcing that " he :neYer. dbhtbni- plated supporting the bill." As to his statement in' Saturday's; letter; I novor entertained;' lit . any time, other than the opinions T oxpressed' at the public .mebtiDg, and I.defy you ,or .any/one else to provo that I have,'-' I am sorry . to say that, notwithstanding this bold challenge, I- am prepared to prove, and' there afo- twenty' pther , pcople similarly ' situated, who cnii' testify; air to tlio' change of opinion of Mr Smytji/.Tjliicii ..you termed liis.
