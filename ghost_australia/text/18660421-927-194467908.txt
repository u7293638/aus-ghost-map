I never stop to think whether my duty is agree able or otherwise. Perhaps if I had my choice I should not have selected this.' ' And may I ask in what it consists I' (another stiff bow). '^It is no secret, Captain Martlock. I have to start the first thing to-morrow for a two day's journey from this Elephant Bay we are now in up into the Goribah country, with beads and looking-glasses as presents for the king of the Loluna tribes, to induce him to withhold hie supply of slaves to tho Portuguese cruisers that visit this iulet' ' Have you seen any slavers, sir V in quired Captain Martlock, wanning over his wine. ' Not the ghost of one, Captain Mart lock.' ' Yes, we have seen the ghost of one,' said the first lieutenant, who was a wit. ' True,' said Captain 'Willoughby. ' our quartermaster, a, good sailor, 'but as full of old woman's fancies as ever came through the dock gates, did tell us a week ago, that he saw a sort of phantom vessel, but no one believed him. 'Take my word for it, captain,' said a little, stout, jovial man, the Spit fire's doctor, '-Gasket will be down with typhus before three days are over ; this sort of delusion is ono of the first symptoms of this infernal African fever.' ' I hope not, doctor, I hope not ; Gasket is a useful man to us.' ' There is something about this slaver service,' said Captain Martlock, as if he were preaching, 'that tends, I think, to excite the imagination of the lower orders of our seamen ; the monotony, the anxiety, tho danger of disease, all, per haps, contribute to this undesirable re sult.' ' Oh, sailors are always full of that sort of nonsense,' said Captain Willoughby, steering away from a discussion evidently meditated by his visitor. ' Captain Mart lock, may I have the pleasure of taking wine with you.' llartlock bowed stiffly, and muttered, ' Pleasure.' ' Steward, tho still champagne to Cap tain Martlock.' ' Off went tho. wire ; up went the largo headed cork, but not noisily, and up rose the wine iu the two glasses. The two cap tains raised their glasses simultaneously to their lips, bowed, and tossed -M the contents. At the same moment their faces reddened, their cheeks dilated, as they spluttered, swore, and rose upon their feet 'Why, what the — , Abernethy, do you give us salt .water when we ask for champagne ? Who the dickens has played us this scurvy trick % By ? George, sir, I'll keel-haul Mm. Yes, I'll break him, sir.' '*I should flog Lim, said Martlock, swelling with rage till he got as red as a turkey-cock. I eh — eh — should put him in irons.' 'I'll stake my life, captain,' Baid the surprised and horrified Scotch steward, that it's that Mr. Jekyll (one of the midship men) ; for one of the ship's boys saw him with a bottle ia his hand near my pantry,' A strong disposition to laugh was visible on every face. The doctor coughed, the two first lieutenants blew their noses. The two captains fumed. Willoughby buttoned his coat angrily together. Martlock looked; fiercely at everybody. 11 Boy,' aawl.Willougliby, to one of the steward's assistants,' go oh deck, and send Mr. Jekyll to me 'directly. -By George, sir, I'll break him.' This was the captain's most .tremendous threat ? 'Why the .deuce does not Mr. Jekyll come V he cried, a few minutes after, long before the unfor tunate lad bad had time to come «veh down. the stairs. 'If it was in my ship,' said Martlock, scowling at his own officers, by whom he wm regarded with no very special affection, ' I'd have a court- martial on him before; an hour was. over.' Captain Willonghby was about to fire up, and remark that he needed no advice with regard to the government of H.M.S. . Spitfire, when the steward-boy returned, preceded by Jekyll, and followed at a distance by that incurable Pickle,' Powis, who gave 'him such a tremendous pinch as he entered the state-cabin, that it drew from him a sharp and irrelevant scream. The; -little midshipman looked very tumbled and dirty, and his bluejacket and cap wore covered with dust and fluff. A more disreputable, disordered midshipman never presented himself to a punctilious: irate captain. , * Mr. Jekyll,' said Mb superior officer turning round in his chair so. as to face him, ' is this a state for a midshipman of' her Majesty's navy ? What have yon been doing, air V ' 'If yon please, «r, I've been down in the hold, catching cockroaches.' There was a roar of laughter »t the simplicity of the answer. 'A pretty occupation for «. young gentle man.' 'If yon please, sir, we make pete of them.' . There was another roar at this. ' Mr. Jekyll, Pm in no humour for fooling. I want a plain answer to a plain question. Was it you who emptied the wine out of Hub champagne bottle and put in salt water f Was it yon, sir V The Jad coloured, looked down, twirled his cap, stammered, and was silent At that instant Powis burst forward, ' And who sent for yon f' roared the Captain. 'How dare you, sir, enter this cabin without being sent for t Sir, if I break every midshipman in the ship, I will preserve proper discipline.' Powis was a -fine, manly Jad of seven teen, and as he stood there, with firm, un flinching eye, and cheek flushed, he looked a very model of English youth. ' If you please, sir, I only came to say it was I -who put the Bait water in the bottle, and not Jekyll. I did not do it for the wine, sir, I threw that away ; it was only for a joke.' ' Only a joke ! And how dare you, sir, play jokes on ?your superior ofiicere? Go up to the masthead this moment, sir.' ' Yes, sir,' And up went the lid, as nimble as a cat and as full of mischief as a kitten. Captain Martlock had left the vessel, with his own private opinions about the discipline of tbe Spitfire j and Captain Willoughby, the first lieutenant, and the doctor, were closeted in the Captain's private cabin over their coffee. ' Only to think of having to leave a ship of thirty-six guos in the care of such a bem Pickle as that lad, Powis ?' groaned the CaptaiD, »s he meditatively poured some brandy into his coffee-cup. ' By George, sir, I shan't have a moment's sleep till I set my foot once more oh my own quarter-deck. That boy is the greatest monkey I ever shipped. By George, sir, if he hadn't come forward in bucu a manly way to-day to save Jekyll, I'd have broken him.' ' Ue certainly is a Pilgarlic,' said the first lieutenant ; ' but I think when there was duty to do he'd do it. Duty soon makes a man of a boy, if anything wilL I was just such another lad, till I was made captain of a French prize, and had to take her back into St. Helena. I was a man from that day.' ' O, bat there's good in the boy,' said the doctor. 'He's brave and generous; there's no vice in him, it's only mischief.' ' Only mischief ! He'6 the greatest scapegrace I ever had on board.' ' Then let me stop on board,' said the lieutenant. 'Allow me to look at the wording of the despatch; there must surely be some loophole,' The captain took up the despatch, and read it under breath. ' No,' he said, ') here is the devil of a clause. 'You are requested to take all your officers with you, so as to preserve a dignity that may aid your negotiation.' No, we must all go. Well, I never did grumble at orders yet, but if I had ever done so, I might do so now. Doctor, mind you bring some quinine. There's safe to be a fever for one or two of us. By George, sir, oa an African station one ought to live on quinine if one wishes to live at all!' The lieutenant and doctor took their leave of the captain, who wished to study his maps and prepare for the journey. Ab the doctor was pacing the deck, and had arrived just under the mainmast, he gave a look upward to see if the offender was there Yes, there he was, swinging his legs, fifty feet up, happy as a bird. As the doctor was still straining his head to observe him, there fell upon his face a shower of little white paper pellets, dropped with excellent aim by ' Pickle Powis,' as he was generally called, and with them came down in a shrill voice the mocking words, 'To be taken night and morning.' The doctor was very angry ; he tossed his head. ' That boy will come to a bad end. If I were the captain I'd keep him on the mast all night— a good dose of fever would tame him a bit ; and,, egad ! I would not bring him round a day too soon.' But the doctor was angry. If Powis had really been ill he would have nursed him as tenderly as a woman. Half an hour after the doctor had retired to his cabin for a nap, there was a gabbling of voices and a splash of oars round the bows. 'There come those spies of niggers,' said Gasket, as he looked over the ship's side, ' Hang their yams, and cocoa-nuts, and bananas ! All they want, I know, is news of us to signal to the slavers. If I was the captain, I'd never let a nigger set ?foot on the deck.' Up scrambled two stalwart negroes with nets on their backs, full of fruit In a moment a fair was established at the foot of the mast. The negroes, eager for news and money, jabbering in broken English ; the sailors, eager for fruit and vegetables, trying to learn the best way to the Goru bah country. In the middle of this discussion, down came s half-crown, wrapped in paper, at the feet of one of the negroes. It was marked, ' Four bananas and a yam, two pence ; give the change to Jekyll.' - It was a message from Powis. ' A tall negro, thinking himself -unobserved, slip ped the bit of silver into his waistband. In a moment, however, Jekyll had him by the wrist. ' Avast there !' he said ; ' hit play's a j eweL Let me read what Powis says.' The negro refused to give up the money, and assumed a vociferously injured air. A scuffle commenced ; in the middle of the scuffle appeared the first lieutenant ' Here, no trouble with these niggers,' he said, 'If they choose to steal, over with them, lads; bundle them out fruit and all' The thing was soon done. Jekyll and a sailor wreiiched the half-crown from the negro, the other sailors pushed the blacks over the ship's side, and tossed &e; unsold fruit into the canoe after them. JekyJJ secured the twe bananas and ya.ni for his friend Powis, and threw the twopence into, the canoe of the enraged blacks, who, shouting and threatening, paddled off to the ehore. ' Here's & pretty rig,' said one of the men, when Powis descended from the masthead, to become in .a few hours after deputy- captain; 'it used to be the high that were brought low, but now it's the low who rise high.' An hour after, the look-out man came back from Elephant hill, and repotted a piratical-looking schooner as passing the next headland at noon. She had then stood out for sea, and was hull down at sunset ' Piratical schooner be hong 1' was the captain's reply. 'They take every little coaster for a slaver. Slavers don't run in to the lion's den. Bonny .River's the place to trap slavers.' Powis received his command as coolly as if he had been expecting a vessel for years past. He promised little — the captain thought that a good sign, and bo it was ; bnt still he did not conceal from the boy his alarm and distrust ? ' Powis,' said he, 'be a good lad and take care of the ship, or by George, sir, I'll break you ! When you wast advice ask the quartermaster; he's an old sailor, and knows all this coast as well as I know the Bill of Portland.' ' I'd give my head,' said the captain to the lieutenant, as Powis left the cabin, ' to tell Gasket he is my mainstay if any thing happens, but when there is divided command there is no discipline.' The day after the captain and his retinue left the vessel, the neyo boat came paddling round the Spitfire as usual, but this time in a hostile and mocking way. The rowers waved their paddles or held up fruit The negro whom Jekyll bad de tected thieving was especially prominent and vociferous, and, standing up in his canoe, kept pointing at Powis and passing his hand across his throat, as if threatening him. ' Let me give him a dose of sparrow shotj' said JekyD, ' that'll warm him.' ' No one must molest them,' said Powis, gravely, and in quite an altered tone. ' How grand we are,' eaidJckyll, under breath, to another midshipman. ' I thought it would be ? a lark when Powis was captain. I vote for going ashore. (These last words were said aloud.) 'We are short- handed,' said Powis; 'no one leaves the vessel, except on duty, till the captain's return. The ne groes are not so friendly as they were. We inusn't get into a scuffle with the natives. ' We used to call 'em niggers,' said a pert little ship boy, winking at Jekyll j ' and, after alj, Gasket, they say, is the real captain.1' Powis made no reply to this imper tinence, but paced the deck thoughtfully. There were only fourteen men left in the ship besides Powis and the two midship men. ' There will be no work now much,' Baid one of the sailors to the carpenter. ' No ; we're all captains now,' replied tho carpenter. There was a dangerous notion prevalent aboard the Spitfire' that discipline was to be relaxed under ' Pickle Powis.' As tight bells were struck (four o'clock in the morning), the officer of the watch (Gasket) went as usual to the scuttle, knocked three times to call the watch, and calkd out, ' All starbowlines, ahoy ! eight belk Do you hear the news there, you sleepers ?' Instead of the usual sprightly answer, 'Ay, ay!' a voice answered, 'Starbow- lines be ft ? . Give us half-an-hour more snooze ; there's no captain aboard now.' Another ten minutes elapsed; at the expiration of that time a stem, shrill boy's voice hailed the sleepers. This time it was Powk's ' Skulkers, ahoy 1 Do you hear the news, there, sleepers) and mind, if you do not turn out in five minutes, I report you to Captain Willoughby as mutineers. Quartermaster, go down, and take the mine of the last man up,' ? This spirited reprimand was enough. Is tiree minutes every man was on deck and qt his duty. An hour later, just «t daybreak, Gasket suddenly, came to Powis, as he was lying down for half-an-hour on the sofa in the. captain's cabin, and begged him to come on deck instantly. There was something odd in the old sailor's manner. Powis was on deck in a moment 'There it is, sir,' said Gasket, pointing to the entrance of the bay; 'if that is not a real ship, strike my name off the ship's books and sell me fora nigger.' Powis looked (he was all quiet alertness now, and grave'as a statesman). ' There in the dull, curdling, grey daylight certainly was a long grey object stealing along close to the shote. Its sails were grey; its sides were bleached, colourless, and' spec- tral It- certainly was ghostly enough.1 As they locked it slid round the corner of the headland, and disappeared from view. Powis did. not say much; he only re marked, 'that is no phantom ship. We must look after that ; but you were right after all, GaSket' ','?'? ' I never seed such a change in a lad in twenty-four hours in all my life,'1 was the quartermaster's reflection, as Powis retired to form his plans for. foiling any scheme the trew of the phantom ship (as the sailors began, to call it) might have formed. The look- outs on Elephant Hill the next afternoon, made, no signal, — they had not seen on vessel j but is they were getting into, their boat to come off to the vessel at sunset, a smoke had arisen from a place in the bush,- not fifty feet from the look-out point It was' evidently a signal to some vessel waiting off the mouth of the bay. The majority of the sailors were by this time deeply imbued with the belief tbat one vessel that had- been seen was a spectre ship. They had collected in knots in the forecastle, and were discussing the legend of the Phantom Ship. ' It's no canny,' Baid a Scotch sailor to the rest; 'it bodes no gude to us, men, when auld NicJde-Ben leaves his sooty hatches and takes to yachting on the Africky coast' .... . Powis bad just lika L-vmpin the state cabin, and was. poring over a chart of Elephant Bay, when' in burst Jekyll, red with excitement, and his hair over his eyes ; he carried a large musical box under his arm. It was chiming oat after the prickly nervous, manner of its species, ' Corn rigs are bonny.' ' Look here, Powis, old Cyclops left his. musical snuff-box on the table in his cabin. Come along, and lefs have a cheroot and some grog together, and Til wind it up all fresh. But how serious you look. Do you feel ill I' Powis did not reply for a moment ; when he did so, he spoke in a low, firm voice, with every word articulated in & peculiarly keen manner. ' Jekyll,' he said, ' this is no time for skylarking. There is work for us to do that may lead us to promotion, or a hole in the sand, before twenty-four hours. We must have no boyish tricks now. Go and tell Gasket I want him.' There was something not to be gain sayed in Powis's manner ; so Jekyll put down the box, much as if it were red-hot, and hurrying on deck returned in a moment with Gasket ' If yon please, Mr. Powis,' said Gas ket, scraping the floor with one foot, ' I think it would do you good not to take the watch to night You'll be knocking your self up ; indeed, you wiil, sir. Take my my advice, and keep to your hammock to night. I can do all there is to do.' ' Gasket,' said the boy-captain, firmly but not harshly, ' I am in command of this vessel, not you. The men shall take their orders from me, and from me alone. Ail vte require of you is to set a good ex ample to the men, and do your duty as quartermaster.' ' As I hope to do,' said the astonished sailor ; ' as I hope to do, Mr. Powis ; but knowing as young gentlemen is ? ' ' My age, Gasket, is no concern to any one. You take the orders from me, and me only : mind, I'll have do interference. You were not left behind as my nurse. Let a good look out be kept ; put a third man on duty in the cross-trees, and never let him take his eyes off Elephant HilL If the phantom ship is a slaver, and made of real plank, and not moonshine and fog, we'll have a snap at her as sure as there's rum in Jamaica. She puts into some bight of land that we must find out, and if she lands her crew to-night, to bring slaves from some baracoon that. we have not yet found out, I think we may get the landing net under her.' ' What, with fourteen men V muttered JekylL ' Oh, he's mad ! Why, it's the rat chasing the terrier,' But Powis had not heard him ; he was again absorbed in his chart That night, by Powis's orders, all lights were put out in the ship at a very early hour. He wished to give the slaver, if such the phantom vessel was, a notion that loose watch was kept on board the Spitfire. That whole night, with only now and then a short rest in the cabin, the boy captain remained himself in the cross trees, as vigilant as a deerstalker. Gasket was by his side, equally intent on the harbour mouth. * All of a sudden Gasket felt his arm clutched, and he looked round. For one moment a little tongue of fire had risen from the apex of the look-nut hill, the sea-ward side, and then disappeared. It 'was momentary as the gleam of a shooting-star. Ten minutes afterwards the same ghostly vessel, sees by a momest's moonlight, stole round the headland, but this time its progress was inward and not outward, 'It's an out-and-in wind; just what they want,' whispered Gasket ; ' they have sweeps too, for I can see them — now they are hidden again ; if it was a clear night they daren't risk it.' ' Take the night-glass,' cried Powis ; ' keep it turned on the third bight from the headland ; if they pass that we lose them, if they stop there we have them, for they go there to land their men, and well have a snap at their vessel in their absence. Does she pass 1 Now, quick, before the cloud is over the moon again.' ' She' has not passed,' cried Gasket ; she has steered up some lagoon not down iu the chart. She must know of the cap tain's being ashore, and trusts to get her cargo in, while we are tied by the heels.' ' Get up the anchor quietly,' said Powis, with the bearing of a young admiral, ' and steer straight for the second bight Is there any landmark, Gasket!' ' Ay, ay, sir ; a tuft of palm trees between two sand hills.' In an incredibly short time the Spitfire was under sail, and availing herself of every glimpse of moonlight, and of every puff of the useful out-and-in wind to reach the second bight, the- hidden lagoon that con cealed the mysterious vessel of which Powis was in pursuit ' He is a fine lad, butit is all of no use,' said' Gasket to himself; n she'll bolt just as we get near, and before we can tack and get a gun ready, off she'll be, well out at Bea, laughing at us, and as full of slaves as an egg's full- of meat Those Portuguese fellows are as quick and as cunning as monkeys.' Hitherto all hud gone well. The Spitfire had come to the mouth of the second bight, and no enemy had yet appeared. Powis gave orders to arm the men and lower a boot His object was to pull along the shore of the bight and search for the con cealed lagoon. The- men, whose superstitious fears were still working, hesitated for a moment to leap into the boat The Scotchman mut tered something about 'snares of the d'il ;' the coxswain, more practical, said, ' there was no captain, and they'd be over matched,' and ' quartermaster won't go.' ' But I do go,' shouted Gasket, leaping into his place, 'and shame on all cowards ! Why, lads, if we trap this slaver we're all made for life. Come, altogether ; quietly, no shouting:' ' The men, ashamed of .their fears, now took theirplaces, muffled theiroars, buckled on their cutlasses, and loaded their pistols. Four men only were left in charge of the ship. .When a ? pistol was fired from the boat, they were to reply with a gun as a signal of attention. . . - The, men pulled swiftly and silently into the bight, keeping as close as possible to the shadow of gigantic reeds that covered the sides of the lagoon. ' They did not dare yet to venture into the mid-channel to even obtain a glimpse of the further shores, where the phantom ship (if it were indeed manned by flesh and blood) might be lying. The boy-captain, at the last dump of bush, cried 'Ship your oars !' and there they lay crouched, peering through the boughs of the huge poisonous-blossomed trees that trailed into the water. It was by this time daybreak. Imagine the brave lad's rapture, on standing up iu the boat and parting the boughs with his hands, to behold, not five hundred yards off, the phantom ship, a low-lying, rakish, Portuguese schooner, painted greyish white, the better to elude observation at night (grey being a peculiar vanishing colour). It was at anchor. The only men visible were two or three negroes, leaning half asleep over the stern, fishing, and luckily with their backs turned towards the place where the Spitfire's boat lay hid. Powis turned round, his face beaming with triumph, and in a cautious whisper communicated the glorious news to Gasket and the boat's crew. Gasket was as brave as a lion, but he was unaccustomed to act on his own re sponsibility, and he dreaded the rashness of a midshipman. He coughed, looked hard at a special rowlock, rubbed it with his great horny fist, and muttered something about — ' S'posc it's a hambnscade. What can we do agin forty or fifty Portuguese ? and as for blacks they can fire muskets as well as white men.' ' Cha !' said Powis, speaking between his half-clenched teeth. ' Do you think ray brains are all leather, like yours 1 Don't I see that the rascals are gone ashore to bring slaves from the baracuon J There can be no oue on board but a nigger and a sick man or two. I tell you, man, I'll go alone, and swim to it, if you are all cowards.' This fired the damp powderof the old sea dog's spirit. There is a drop of Cain's cruel blood at the bottom of most men's hearts. ' Avast with your cowards !' he cried, pulling out bis cutlass, and running his big thumb along the edge in a most business like way. It was a bad omen for the slaver's men. Powis's eyes glistened as he seized old Gasket's hand, and took off his own cap and waved it Then he and the men took out their pistols and looked to the locks, or tightened their belts, and slung round their cutlasses snugger for their hands. The boy-captain's speech was spoken in a low but firm voice. ' Men,' he said, ' we may be doing a safe thing, or we may be going to our death, for, even if wo do not get the slaver safe, pur captain : and comrades may not return in time to help us if the dogs dare to try and get her back. If we die, let us die like Englishmen, true to our God and our Queen ; we must hold together back to back, and no flinch ers. If we fail, they will at least say in England that we deserved to have succeeded. God be with us and guide us to victory, for our cause is a good cause. Now then, men, give way with a will, aud board her !' ' Pull straight for her, Spitfires 1' cried Gasket, and out the bott flew from be tween the branches as if ii was driven by steam. The water was scarcely splashed by the oars. It seemed only an instant after that the boat lay alongside tbe phantom ship, and, headed by Powis, the boarders dashed like wild cats at the main chains, and sprang on deck with an English hurrah that was full of cheerful courage. Three or four frightened negroes and an old Portuguese sprang to arms, but they were cut down or beaten down in a mo ment. One Spitfire was shot in the arm, but with the exception cf that casualty, and a knife-cut ou Powia'e sword-wrist, the daring assailants suffered no hurt. The phantom ship was their cwn. ' Well done !' cried Powis, wrapping a handkerchief round, his irrist ' The dog tried hard to get at my tlroat, but I gave him No. 3 Gasket, and that'll last him, for some time. See tp him ; he mustn't bleed to death. The ship's our own. Now get up the anchor, for we must move her off.' He fired his pistol, and the Spitfire an swered with a gun, as' agreed on. ' We haven't too much time,' he said, 'for directly the blackguards hear the row they'll be after us. Now, with a will, lads, and PJl take a capstan bar myself, for I've got my left hand all right stUL' And they did work with a wi!J. They found Borne slaves in the hold, and made them top help. In an incredibly short time: the vessel's head was turned, and she and the Spitfire were working down the lagoon towards the old mooring-place. . And now, in the lull of excitement, the boy's nature began to crop up again. Once more on board the Spitfire, and down in the cabin, he danced hornpipes and hugged Jekyll. Nor was Jekyll one whit less' delighted. 'Only 'think Jekyllj how pleased the' governor and master will be to hear how we took the slaver.' ' The dodgy old fellow,' shouted JekylL ' Allow me, gentlemen, to propose the health of Captain Powis of the Phantom Ship ; that's abpul the style.' But the boy's talk was broken by the entrance of Gasket He looked flurried, and rather pale with excitement 'Mr. Powis,' he said, 'its all up; here's the tho dirty blackguards of Portu guese on ub as thick as thunder—boats full on 'ein, sir, 'rampaging away like so many sore bears. Y6u can see them poking their noses out of the bight there, as thick as bees at « swarming.' Powis was awake in a moment, and ready for the emergency. If there was not a Nelson, there was at least the making of a €ollingwood in that 'Pickle' of the vessel. ' We'll warm the dogs, Gasket,' he said, leaping up and calmly loading a revolver that lay on the table before him, ' What we're contrived to get, we'll contrive to. keep. It can't be long before Captain Willoughby and our messmates return. Be quick, man, and give them a shell before the canoes spread out into the bay ; we shall have them more in a lump now.' There was no time to lose. When Powis got on deck, five or six canoes, crammed with shouting negroes, mulattoes, andpirati caMooking Portuguese sailors in Panama hats, were rowing fiercely out of the tree shadowed mouth of the lagoon, and pulling straight for the Spitfire. 'Give it them hot, don't throw away a shot 1' cried Powis to the men at the guns. ?' Well thrown, but a little over them!' The next moment the second gun than-' dered out 'Famous, by Jove!' cried the boy .captain. This time the shot ploughed into the second canoe, and shattered- it into frag-, ments. She leading canoes halted to assist the wounded and pick op the survivors. The Spitfires gave a shout of triumph. The next moment the storm burst foil upon them. The slavers rallied and bore down upon them in full force. From .the first canoe a dozen rough, black-muoled fellows dashed at the Spitfire's side and attempted to board her. Powis met them with pike and cutlass, and drove them back over the ship's gunwale after ten minutes' hsnd-to-hand fighting. Twice Gasket's cutlass saved the boy-captain's life. Three of the oldest hands, urged on by Jekyll, kept at work all the tame with a central gun, to keep off the other mis creants. It was hard work, and the men were all but spent, when a discharge of mnsketry arose into the air from the foot of Elephant HilL ' God be thanked T cried Powis, as he leant, feint and wounded, against a gun carriage. 'We are saved boys. Give it them again ! Blow the dogs oat of the water ! Now, all at once.' The pirates had fled, leaving one-third of their number dead in Elephant Bay. But Cnptaii! Willoughby bad not arrived a rao meut too soon. Great was his astonish ment and delight to discover that his ' Pickle 'of amidshipmaa bad captnredthe famous phantom ship. 1 Powis is now, we rejoice to say, first lieutenant of H.M.S.
