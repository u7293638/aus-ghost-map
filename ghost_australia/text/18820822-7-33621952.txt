MATERIALISM. TO THE EDITOR. I am, &c.;, C.M. THURSTON. Unley, August 20, 1882. Sir—There is an old saying that too many cooks spoil the broth. Now according to the Bible and. my way of thinking that is just what Mr. Joseph Cook, from Boston. with tie assistance of the Young Hen's t'ttriataan Aaaomtion, is doaag at the pmont j time. Mr. Cook will take it as an act of : clarity on my part I have no doubt when I I tell him (hat in bis denunciation of I JBat?ialisjn b? ia preaching contrary to tbe : Bible, and that I prefer to believe what the ; Bible says. I will take the trouble to jrrse one or twotexta from the Word of God to < show that people are Utoriay? airier a gr?e>t ; mistake in believing that they will be alive after they are. dead:— J Kcclesiastes iii., 19, 20, For that wbJHi befaTJeth the ?one of men befalleth ax asta; evaai one thing rwfillath them: as ike one 4kth. so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; no that a man hath no pre-anrinence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go onto one place; all are of the dost, an J ail tun to du*t again. Ecdesiastes ix, 5, K>. For aha living know that they shall die; but the ' dead Enow not anything, neither have they any wore a reward; for the memory of them is for atotta*. Whataover thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy ?tight; for there is no work, nor device, nor kcuwlcdge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither tliou xi?st I Job vu., 9. !
