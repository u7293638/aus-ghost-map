HARMONY. BY F. A. WESTBURY. It was in vain I will'd. I gee The cabinets of memory Are all unlocked by harmony ! I said, " My past and I must part: It shall be done : I know an art To lock the chambers of the heart." I took the key that men call Will, I shut the ghosts of buried ill In deep-down chambers, dark and still. Last on Remorse I closed the door. Saying, " Heart of mine, grown sick and sore, These things shall trouble thee no more ! " Now, go thy ways ! Smite, forge, delve, build, Till all thy meaning be fulfilled: Look back no more !" 'Tvvas thus I willed. There was a charm I did not know ! The simplest pipe a clown can blow, The rudest harp is touched, and lo ! The doors that I had locked so fast Upon the ghosts of what is past Fly open. All, Remorse, at last! So, 'twas in vain I will'd. I see The cabinets of memory Are all unlocked by harmony.
