I ?Thojattendanco.: was very large, und-,-it isj ?evident— although ? the . entries were-, aj trifle' under- last, year's— -that these races! riot bril}',from the' visiting public, b'ufc from; 'owners of' horse's as well; arid it is quite! .time that, the arrangements for carrying! Ojit the advertised programme '.should' be; a -liriio better- attendedito. The systemi Lof 'all races,. except the Trojt and HurdJ.^, being -heats, is had; Too much-i'irne' is necessarJLj'--,vu3tsd-in allo^inst the horses tiinb'to get their ii-cath, and unless the winner of tbo fii'st heat manages to catch the judge's eye first again in the second heat,' a third and final has -to ??be'-ruh. Thus one race alone occupies- close on-a couple of hours. The gentlemen whoso names are down as stewards should not accept the honor unless, they mean as sisting in the work. As it vras,. nearly the whole of the. arrangements were left to the indefatigable secretary, Mr Rudge, and Messrs. J. Symmons, G.- Ritchie, and J. Blair. ; These 'gentlemen had .a great deal more to do than it was-possible for any quartette of officers to get through on a racecourse, especially in the country districts, where they have' ;not 'every convenience at hand, as the : stewards of the T.T.C have in Launceston. . I mus't. return my sincere thanks '?? to. those gentlemen for their, courleous behaviour, and much regret it is not in my power to : give such a graphic description of the races as I should like, and the reason is simply this. The racecourse is deficient of a grand stand ; one is temporarily pro:- : vided — a large wagon, and a';-vef|f good ? substitute :it is. This is placed' opposite the winning post for the sple'and 'Separat* : useofthejudge,stewar4s,and therepreseK- ; tatives of the Press, who are invited to the stand.. So far. so good— if this arrangement : were carried out-but alas, when something : like 50 people are huddled together- in a wagon, what can thp majority see ? Why, a. cloud of dust in the distance, and a ; glimpsOi of the horses as they start and finish, that is, provided you get .- a stand next the judge; and it is very unsatisfao- ; tory for a reporter-to attond'a race- meet'- ! ing and- be unable to properly ^ ?chronicle : the running. \ Of the races-some -were - extremely weir contested. ;Thb;first' heat i ;for -the maiden .plate: was as, fine a raep! lahdifiriisli. between. SaucylDick. and, Xaay \ 'Bir'd'as couldbe' seen on any.jrace;course-;;i for nearly, half th9distiinco;a.S,heet would have, covered: theni, and .tb.e-,former,hors-f wns landed by a short.' half, neck, ho..,sc cured the, second heat, and , the. first-vic- tory was scared , by Mr, A. G; Pai r. Th- pa.'iy race, although the. two had plenty of running ? for the entrance money, was almost a gift to British Queen ; the. pub; lie money was. not given, as three, hordes did not sfart, Little Dick having been de; clorcd over 14 hands high. Tho trotting raco brought out seven, and by many.it was considered a certainty. for Tommy. In this they were most woefully deceived, as he never had a ghost of a chancti from the start, the, race tx'ing^ between Flight and Bella who came, in- in the order named. The Hurdle, Race, was of course the event of the day,, although a deal- of interest was manifested in, the Curriek Plate, The hurdles were advertised to be 3ft. 9in. ; they may not havo been highpr, but we certainly must say we quite agree, with tho. gentleman who rer marked, ' I should like to have, a pile of bank notes .as high, as there is space over 3lt.' 9in.'.' Tlie jumping wns good, and tho niqo, was hotly contested from the start, and resulted in C. Viney/s Merry . maid, coming off conqueror. Thero were two or threo protests entered during the day, and all were dismissed after being investigated. We are happy to say , we heard- of no accidents, ult.hough a sninl| ?pony ridden by a lad boltedofl'theI;COur.sie, jumping a po»t. and . rail fence:; but though the boy. was thrown he luckily escaped unhurt,. The arrangements for the s'rfpply of ' creature comforts' were entrusted to Messrs. Bltiir. and Leith,- of Carrick, and. tliey performed their part well, Mr Blair eatering.in the committee booth, and as the charge for a good Vsub« stantial cold lunchepu ,;was moderate; ? it was well patronised^,:Au.uexed.isa,detailfid account of- the(running. :. . , ... ,.,., t, ] Maiden Pr,.vn-:, of ip,sors.,'foriiprscsi(hat have never, won putouc.money:.
