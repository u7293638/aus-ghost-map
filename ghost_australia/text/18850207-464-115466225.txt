Anthony Phiibin, the other approver, refused to come forward the same as Casey, though he promised Father Corbett he would do so. He ad mitted, however, to Father Corbett, that he wasn't at the murder, that he knew nothing of it, and that what the Joyces swore about him was all false. However, I have reason to believe he will make a statement soon. . He was the first witness who undertook to name the three men who broke in , tho door .-.and. perpetrated the murders. He put;, down, Myles .Joyce as, being one of them. The three Joyce's, 'the. independent witnesses/' specified no one: in 'particular as hav-j ing gone. in.; !And yet it is singular , how Philbin,; who wasn't, there at all, hit on the very twomenj who did go in— Pat. Joyce and Pat. Casey, ?; who were executed. , ,.-,:. i ,. : ''Themembers-of the : Irish -party immediately -brought these revelations under the notice of Par liament/and.callediforlan.inquiry. -It was about the, ,close ; of [the, :session. ; , :. ,But it : was promised fcy. the Marquis. , of ? Hartington,..that if the Arch bishop of ' Tuani brouglit^ tlie , matter before the 'liead^f 'the 'Tfish^Gbyernriieritj;; ari inquiry would ibe held.': :I have good rea'spns for saying the Mar -.quis belieyed the Archbishop would do nothing of ,the;; sort. M,He belieyed ,the politics and policy of rthe iArchbishoj) ,were tlie antipodes of the politics 'and'pblicy of the Irish party, and that he would riot -touch 'anything that the Parnellites had a harid'.'ini. r.Thet Marquis mistook hisB man'; thf prelate shrank not from his duty. He called for an inquiry, and said .he . saw no reason to dis believe the statements of Casey. An inquiry was held. But where ? In a secret chamber of Dublin Castle, George; ' Bolton and magistrate Brady, the two Crown- conspirators who were directly compromised., by Casey's revelations, arraigned themselves;' '?' tried themselves, and found themselves, ..'not guilty.'. They presented the verdict to the high-priest of Castle infamy, Earl Spencer. He extended his august hands over the arcades anib'p',. and blessed them. And the result of the inquisitorial labours of this trinity of evil was the famous memorandum re ceived by the Archbishop'. It was a recital of the evidence given at the trials, and a statement of contempt for the stories; of Casey and Phiibin, and the gullibility of 'those who could swallow them. The Archbishop indignantly threw the document back in their faces, and said he didn't believe a word of it. , ; ,;,. '? ' . . Mr. Harrington, M. P., now took up the run riirig.v' In cbinpariy witih' the priests of Partry, he visited- ? Mount 'Partry ;and Maamtrasna. Here fpr; several days he made inquiries. He had many interviews with .Tpmi Casey. He found corrobora tibn'f or the' stateriients pfthe latter in every detail. At 'eacli'iriterview, isoriiething more startling than before; came to lights according as Casey's memory was ,r,efi'eshed; ,, Thus it ;was. at the very last inter view., that the momentous fact came out that the riiurHerers ha'd'biackoned faces. At the meeting of Parliament, on the 24th October last, Harring ton had a pamphlet- ori» the 'Maamtrasna Mas sacre' in the hands pf-.eyery member. The case was so clear that friend andfoe attacked the Gov ernment in a stornit'ofj pitiless invective in the debate on an inquiry: The Government had no defence. 'Walker, th'e SoiicitorrGeneral, was so ' press ed.fpr arguments, that he literally asked the House tip believe' that' blade was xuhite, and Glad stone' (was --forced to fall back on the doctrine of pro'bablism.i as: his ? last refuge of defence. The House, was thronged.., The occasion was a great one; 'for, as Gladstone said, the debate was tanta mount to an impeachinerit' pf Earl Spencer. As Gladstone made if a: matter' of life and death for , the Irish executive, numbers came to his rescue, ! and the inquiry was refused; ?? But the inquiry i is sure to come;1' Everybody. feltvthat the case was i unanswerable. iNight . ; . arid ; ,day . , the. ghost of 'Myles Joyce shadows i'Eari Spencer and, his guilty .officials.
