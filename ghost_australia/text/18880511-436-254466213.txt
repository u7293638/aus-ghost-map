GHOSTS ON THE OCEAN. In the twenty years of my seafearing life I had two experiences with haunted ships. The term may provoke a smile, but if there are hauuted houses why shouldn't there be haunted ships ? As to the question of the supernatural, I may or may not be a believer. I will give you the incidents just as they occurred, and if you can explain everything satisfactorily to yourself I shall be gratified An English brig called the Charles, in making her first voyage from Liverpool to Boston, had some trouble with her crew, and in putting it down the captain 6hot a sailor named Jack Wallace. Jack lived about an hour after being hit, and he cursed the captain high and low, and he vowed by all that was good that he would haunt the brig as long as she floated. I'm blessed if he didn't begin the haunting business that very night, creating an alarm which made even the first mate shake in his boots. On getting into Boston every man but the second mate deserted her. She loaded her cargo, shipped another crew, and on the way over to England Jack's ghost kicked up such a row that the men were for taking for their boats in mid ocean and deserting the brig. Every man of them, mate and ' all, left her at Liverpool, and it was two weeks after she was ready to sail again, this time for New Orleans, before she could find a crew. News of an affair of this sort spreads about sooner or later, and further than you would imagine, even without the help of the newspapers, and Jack Tar will not sail in a haunted ship for any man's money. The brig reached New Orleans after a long passage, and had scaicely been tied to the wharf when everybody deserted her, the captain going with the rest. There was a regular stampede, and the vessel was left in the hantfs of the consignees at the drop of the hat, I found her two weeks after this with her load of cotton all aboard and her sails bent for sailing. Her old crew had talked more or less, and double wages were being oflered for a crew. First mate's place was offered me, while an Eng lish sea captain had come down from New York. We regarded the ghost business as all nonsense, and we prepared to grapple with any spirit or investigate any mystery. By our own personal efforts we finally picked up a crew, getting hold of men here and there, who had just come into port from long voyages and had heard nothing to the brig's prejudice. We dropped down the river and got to sea before night of the first day, and when I came on deck at midnight to stand my watch there was a steady breeze and a moderate sea, and the captain's watch had had an easy time of it. The men of my watch took a pull at a brace here and there, and inside of a quarter of an hour all except the lookout were stowed away here and there to catch cat-naps. I was pacing the deck, with everything very quiet below and aloft, when my attention was attracted to the sight of a sailor coming aft. I was on the Btarboard quarter, and he came along down close to the portrail, aud made as if to go to the wheel. His footsteps gave out no sound, and he came along with a sort of glide I never could describe. It was a breach of discipline for a foremast hand to appear on the quarter deck without a special errand or without saluting, and when I saw this man making his way along the quarter toward the man at the wheel it struck me that he was walking in his sleep. I picked up a rope's end and started for him, but he glided ahead like a shadow, passed within two feet of the man at the wheel, and went out of sight like a flash. Next instant the sailor let go the spokes of the wheel and staggered about, and the biig would have c*pe up intffbe win( * had 1 not jumped for the wheeR^yyelled out and raised an alarm, and the men threw a buoy over and we presently stopped our way and made ready to lower a boat. It was then discovered that no one was missing. Every man aboard that craft was there to answer his came. The captain set out to give me a keelhauling for creating such an alarm, but I took him aside, called to the sailor who had &een; all, and told him our story in a way which put the old man into a pickle. While he had to believe us he wouldn't believe in the supernatural, and no man could have been more uneasy. "Hero is what I saw, sir," replied the foremast hand when asked for his version of the matter. " I think I saw the spook before Mr. Temple did. I thought it was " e of the men coming back to make a reort to him, but when I saw him bear off ;o port and saw Mr. Temple start him, I believed it was a case of sleep-walking. The thing came so close that I could have touched it, and there was a smell of dead folks about it. There was a sailor look to the face—it being a youngish chap—and his two hands were clasped on his side like this. He fetched a sort of groan as he passed me, and he went over the stern as softly as a leaf falls to the ground, and without a splash. This is a haunted craft, sir, and I give"— " Shut up !" hissed the captain. " Tell me that again and I'll clap you in irons." " But who was it, sir ?" " Both of you were dreaming, and if I hear any more of it somebody will hear from me." He further requested that nothing be said to the men, and although he tried to make light of the matter I knew that he was greatly puzzled. The sailor was as good as his promise, and said nothing, and nothing further happened until the third night. The second mate, as you may know, is really in charge of the captain's watch, and this officer (Mr. Graves)was on duty, and the time was 11 o'clock, with my watch all below, when something happened. His watch had just been trimming the yards, and could not therefore be charged with dreaming. All of a sudden a figure appeared among them. It was the first seen at the scuttle butt, and one of the men, who was after a drink of water, spoke to it under the impression that it was one of his shipmates. It glided away, and at the same moment his nostrils were greeted with such an odour that he cried out with disgust. The strange figure was seen by four men of the watch as it glided to a point a few feet abaft the foremast, and there stood for two or three minutes with hands pressed upon its side, and its body waving to and fro. A man by the name of Will Ketch—a chap who had never feared man or devil—called out to the mysterious personage— " If you are playing a trick on us look out for yourself." With that he picked up a becket, or belaying pin, or weapon of some sort which was handy by, and gave it a fling at the figure, and the mysterious personage vanished at the snap of your finger. There was a row which brought us all on deck, and now the fact that there was a mysterious something aboard the brig could no hnger be concealed. The captain raved and blustered, but the men had seen what they bad seen, and it was no use to browbeat them. The watch below refused to turn in again. The captain undertook to drive them at the muzzle of his revolver, and they threatened to jump overboard, There may be a haunted house in a neighbourhood, but no one fears it unless he passes it. Here was a ship believed to be haunted, and yet no one could get away from it. I confess that things did look at least " queer" to me, and while the captain poohpoohed and talked in a loud voice, I realized that he was a bit shaky. Mr. Graves also blustered about, swearing at the men and advising a dose of belayingpin to cure their nonsense, and when the captain told him to turn in he went down to his berth with a laugh and a swagger. Three minutes later he returned to us with a face as white as chalk, and it was a full minute before he could use his tongue to stammer out.— " The—the thing is in the cabin!" Without a word in reply we descended the companion with him—the captain going first, I next, and Mr. Graves bringing up the rear. As we passed along the hall and pushed open the cabin door the figure of a man could be made out on the far side of the cabin, where the shadows were darkest. It was plain as any human figure could be, though we could not make out the face and other details. We stared at it for half a minute, and then the captain pulled his revolver and banged away. There was a sort of groan following his shot, and when the smoke had cleared away we took a light and searched in vain for traces of our mysterious visitor. He had departed. It was confessed to the owners and to the press that the officers and crew of that brig slept on deck every night after that until the end of the voyage. Indeed there were only two sailors among the crew who would venture into the forecastle in the daytime, avd the steward could not have been kept in his place except by threats. We were ridiculed and laughed at as a crew, but it is a matter of history that the Charles never made another voyage. She could not get a charter, nor could she have got a crew if she hpd, and after rotting in ordinary for a couple of years she was knocked to pieces. My second experience was on the ship Homeward. I shipped on her at Liverpool for a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope and return. I had not set eyes on her, and knew her only by name when I went aboard with my traps. I had first mates, berth, and understood that the officer filling that place had been taken suddenly ill two days before the ship was ready to sail, and I had to hustle away without making en quiries. As I approached her I encountered a man skulking away, and believing him to be a deserter I reached out for him I got hold of his collar, but he broke my hold, and as he ran away I heard him 6ay:— " Aye, but I'd sooner sail the 6ea in a coffin." I gave this remark little attention, even when I found out aboard that he was actually a deserter. He was one of six men who h id come off to the ship in the morning, and nobody could tell why he had cut sticks. We had a pretty good idea three or four days later. There were only five men aboard when I climbed over the rail—only five sailors. The cook and steward were there, as also a cabin boy, but the captain was ashore, and no one could tell me whether a second mate had been shipped or not About midnight the shipping agents sent me eleven or twelve men, every one of them helplessly drunk, and a little later on came the captain. He had been drinking heavily, and after trying to tell me his name and failing to understand mine, he went to his cabin with the order that I should call him at six o'clock. We we/eall ready to warp out, the work of only balf an hour from our berth, and the tide would not serve until midforenoon. 1 appointed a shipkeeper and turned in myself, but the drunken fellows were bound to have their farewell carouse, and I {rot no sleep through the night. Less tban half of them were of any use next morning in warping the ship out. The captain caine on deck perfectly sober, and when I said something about the condition of the crew he replied— " Yes, it's beastly, Mr. Temple, but we couldn't have got 'em aboard sober, you knew. Let a whisper get out about a craft and sailors act like fools." I had my mouth open to ask what stories were in circulation regarding the Homeward when the captain, whose name was Robinson, gave me an order and walked away. The second mate, who seemed to have been on the spree with the men, came up and introduced himself. His name was Anderson, and he apologized forhis presence by saying— " I hung out to the very last, hoping to et another ship, but I had to take the berth. S>o you think they are bad ?" "What?" " The ghosts." " Is this a haunted ship ?" " Didn't you know it was ? They say she has been deserted in every port, ana that she changes captains every trip, but perhaps it is only sailor talk. I hope we shall have no trouble, sir." He slided away in a half-ashamed manner, and all hands, or all who were ot any use, at once began warping the ship out, and before noon we were on our way out. After we were fairly off the men began to knock themselves together, the captain and second mate acted like different men, and when the watches were set I had forgotten the words dropped bp Mr. Anderson. He was a thorough sailor and full of discipline, .and one would have judged by his face that he had great force of character. Nothing occurred to create an alarm for three days. Then, one night during my watch, a man in the captain's watch, who was below, came on deck and said to me : " Mr. Temple, it must be that we have a stowaway aboard. We have heard groans and sighs and sobs for the last two nights, and some of the men declare that the ship is haunted. There comes the watch, sir, driven out by the noises. Won't you please make a search ?" It was true that every man in the captain's watch had tumbled up, and I knew that they must be badly frightened to thus exhibit themselves. I took a long look at the weather, saw that everything was fair, and then descended to the forecastle alone. Not a man dated to follow .me down there. I wasn't even nervous. If there were groans and cries they must come from some poor devil who had secreted himself in the hold, and who was now ill and starving. I had only reached the foot of the ladder when felt the touch of an icy hand on my face, and next instant my hair was on end. Some one was sighing, groaning and weeping. The sounds did not come from any one direction. At one moment they seemed to come from the very eyes of the ship, and the next they were heard at the bull&ead; which divided the place from the. hold, too, all the time as if somebody was J moving about me, and I put my hand to prevent my throat being clutched. I frankly admit to you that I waB scared, but I was determined not to show my feelings to the men, end as I went on deck again I carelessly said to them:— " The noises come from the hold. Some one has stowed himself away, and we'll have him out to-morrow." I left it with them to go back or to remain on deck, and not one of them, nor yet a man in my own watch, would go below until daylight came, when, strange to say, the noises died entirely away. The captain and Mr. Anderson both saw that something was wrong as they came on deck. The captain received the news very quietly, asking a question now and then, ana when I had finished he replied : " Very well, sir, after the men have had their breakfast we will search the hold." We had one, but it was fruitless of result. It was thorough enough to convince us that no person was hidden away. The captain had very little to say, seeming, as I thought, greatly distressed in mind, but I finally brought Mr. Anderson over to agree with me that the noises were produced by the rubbing oi the cargo, though why we should not hear them in the daytime as well as I could not explain. The noises began about 9 o'clock the next night. Both Mr. Anderson and myself went down and listened to them ; but we could not prevail upon the captain to accompany us. Before 10 o'clock the men were in such a state of trepidation that it was hardly possible to separate them to do duty, and an hour later, when I went into the cabin to consult with the captain, he looked at ine in the queerest manner, and said—Mr. " Temple, we must go back to Liverpool. This ship is haunted, and if we pursue the voyage we are lost." With that he burst into tears and went off to his stateroom and locked himself in. It was a hard position to find myself in, for I now believed that the captain had gone daft, and the second mate was so rattled that his advice was no good. I determined to hold the ship on her course, however, and she was pursuing it when, at 2 o'clock in the morning, the captain suddenly rushed on deck and sprang overboard with a yell, and though we laid the ship to and lowered a boat we found no trace of him. I then put the ship about and carried her into Liverpool, and it was the last voyage she ever made.
