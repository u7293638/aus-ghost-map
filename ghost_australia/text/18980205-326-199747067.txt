ENTERTAINMENT AT! WODONGA Mr. Geo Enrian, tho Wandering Minis- trel, gave an entertainment in the Shire Hall, Wodonga, on Tuesday evening to a yory fair house, despite the closeness of the atmosphere. . Half the proceeds will he handed over to the Gippsland Fires Relief Fund, which will thus benefit to the extent of Â£1 15s by the entertainment. Mr. Enrian had enlisted the aid of several local amateurs, including Misses Guy ( 2), and Messrs. J. H. S. Campbell, T. Doyle, P. and R. Jennings, T. W. .Powell, and Bert . Allen, most of whom rendered vocal or instrumental selections in the first part and sustained characters in the " Old Joe!s Ghost" and "Iriah Justice" iu the latter part of an unvsally amusing pro gramme. Considering the very few days allowed for the reheasal, the farce was remarkably, well staged. Not only was the Judge ( Mr: Enrian) and the Constable (Mr. Doyle), well up in their respective characters, as might be expected from those who have taken part in amateur performances, but the subordinate parts right down to tho prieoners (Master James Callinan and Red. Taylor), were almost equally well sustained. The Mins trel himself rendered a number of comic songs and gave a splended exhibition of j his power as a ventriloquist, and his com- | icalitios aud witticisms brought down the | house. As the shire.hall was given by the j president free of charge, and Mr. Geo. i Leighton generously gave the gratuitous I use of the piano, the expenses were very small, amounting altoge t her to only 10s. 6cl.
