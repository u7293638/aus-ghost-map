We publish the following this week The pale swept onward in its wrath, and man The impotent, in sympathetic awe, Heart-stricken bowed his bead, as now his fields Of golden grain before the rushing blast Bent down to earth in semi-conscious fear. Without grim desolation reigned supreme; Within its dread authority was felt. But see 1 the storm has passed, and lo 1 the sun With gentle ray illumes the smiling earth, And all things glitter with his radiant beams. Thus, when in dreams some ghost our hearts appal Fresh from the grave we wake, and, lo 1 'tis day. Clericus. I slept, but not the gentle sleep Of innocence and peace profound; I wept, yet wherefore should I weep? Why should a phantom thus my heart astound ? Methought I heard a dismal sound— Methought I saw my landlord's ghost Point to my grave, and then a host Of mail-dad warriors compassed me around. Methought I saw each shield and spear Upraised and glitter round my head.. Was it a dream? The pole I fear Destroyed my grain and filled my heart with Cockatoo. Glitter will rhyme with bitter, grain with rain Gentle with mental, gale with sail and hail, Ghost with both host and post: and then again With grave we couple cave. So endB my tale.
