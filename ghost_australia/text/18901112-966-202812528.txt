THE ATTACK UPON ADELAIDE. TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€”1 witnessed the attack on and the defence of the city by the forces yesterday from either side at different points, and all I can say is that the men behaved splendidly; but I saw instances of companies being outflanked and heavily fired into, yet having the cool cheek to enntinue in action. Where were the umpiries ? Echo answers, where? And if not handy, why not? Ic is poor satisfaction to men who out-manoeuvre another body to see the supposed defunct arise and go for _ them afresh, standing up the while, perhaps, like so many targets, so invulnerable do they, in their ignorance, think themselves to be. Umpires should be distributed on either fiank and in the centre, and by their reports to head-quarters the result of tactics under fire should be decided, and not, as seemingly, is done now, rule of thumb or anyhow. I am, Sir, &c.;, T. ATKINS' GHOST. Southwark. November 1L
