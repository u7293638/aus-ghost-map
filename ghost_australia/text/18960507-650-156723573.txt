A Wandering Cyclist About three years ago, a wandering cyclist threw a whole district of the Transvaal into a paroxysm of supersti tious terror. Travelling by. night,- his advent would have been unnoticed if two young Boers, early abroad in search of bullocks, had not seen, the 'spoor,' or track of the wheelman. . With the curi osity of their race, they followed it for some miles, being anxious to see the man ' who could trundle a wheelbarrow so far without a rest.' After an hour's tracking, one remarked, 'This fellow must be a thief ; let us go and te1! the landrost (magistrate).' Accordingly the worthy Dutch ' beak ' was brought on to the scene, and he was accompanied by a score of armed Boers. The whole party followed the path taken by our cyclist. Halting at noon, whilst the horses grazed, the mysterious trail was the subject of much scrutiny. Suddenly one farmer exclaimed, ' Look here, land rost, if it was a barrow, ' where is the 'spoor' of the man who wheeled it ?' ' My goodness !' exclaimed that official, ' I never thought of that, Let's see yes, here is the wheel right enough, but where is the footprint ? It is, it must beâ€” yes, yes ; ride, boys, ride, its a spook (ghost). To this day that portion of the road is not traversed by any of the Dutch farmers.
