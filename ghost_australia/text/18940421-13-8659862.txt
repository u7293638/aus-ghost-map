THE PEOPLE OF THE MIST BY H. RIDER HAGGARD. (CONTINUED -FROM SATO-DA- LAST.) CHAPTER XXI. (CONTINUED). The party continued their march towards the city on the hill -ho two white men went first next came Juannn and Otter, followed by Sea, and lost of all walked the Settlement men An boura journey brought them to the bank of the river, which, dividing above it, regarded the town, to reunite near the roadway that they followed Here causes were ready to take them across to the island, or rather the peninsula, on which the city was built, and on the other side of the river they found priests waiting in the great gate way with two letters that had been prepared for France and Otter respectively Tina, the further bank, was lined with some thousands of spectators, who, when the divine pair set their feet upon its shores, prostrated themselves, men, women, and children, and burst into a shout of welcome Juanna and Otter took no heed With such dignity as they could command and as the dwarf a case it was not much they entered the litters, drew the hide curtains, and were borne forward swiftly) After them came Leonard, 1 Francisco, and the others, while the population followed in silence Now the sun was sinking but enough of daylight was left to show how strange were the place and people among which they found themselves Thecitj.mleed was rudely) built of like material and in such fashion as the house in the plain that has been described already But the streets were roughly paved , each habitation stood apart from the other in its own garden, and the gates were of wood, fastened together with primitive iron bolt There w ere drinking shops or rather booths, and a large market-place which they crossed as they ascended the hill and where, as they afterwards discovered, this people carried on their trade, if trade it could be called, for they had no money, and conducted all transactions like other savages upon a principle of barter. As they went Leonard took note of these things, which, to his mind showed clearly that the inhabitants of this city were the degenerate inheritors of some ancient and forgotten civilization Their fortifications, stone built houses, drinking shops and markets indicated this just as their rude system of theology, with its divinities of Light and Darkness, or of Death and Life, each springing from the other engaged in an eternal struggle, and yet one was probably the survival of some elaborate nature myth of the earl) world But nothing struck him so much as the appearance of the people In size they were almost giants, a peculiarity which was shared by the women, some of whom measured six feet in height In common with other un civilised races most of these women wore little except a girdle and a goatskin cloak that hung loosely upon their shoulders displaying their magnificent proportions somewhat free!) These were much handsomer than the men having splendid solemn eyes very white teeth, and a remarkable dignity of gait Their faces however, were the same sombre look as those of their husbands and brothers, and they did not chatter after the manner of their sex, but contented themselves with pointing out the peculiarities of the strangers in a few brief words to their children or to one another After they had crossed the market place there came a long and gentle ascent, which terminated at a wall surrounding the lower of the two great buildings that they had seen from the plain Passing its gates they halted at the doors of the first of these edifices Here priests stool with torches sor, at least, they judged them to be priests from the Symbol of the sunken head tattooed upon their naked bre ists rend) to conduct them to their resting place, for now the night was closing in rapidly boon they found themselves within the walls of a great house, built in the usual way with rough boulders, but on three sides of a square, and enclosing a court yard in which a fountain bubbled The fu nature of the house was rude but grotesquely) carved and in the court yard stood a throne sheltered by a roof of turf and fashioned of black wood and ivory), with feet shaped like those of a human being Indeed, as they afterwards discovered, this was the palace of the king, Offa, who had been summarily ejected by the priests to make room for the new comers Hero in this strange dwelling the attendant priests assigned them all quarters, the Settlement men in one wing, Leonard, Francisco, and Son in the other, and Joanna and Otter in two separate apart ments in the body of the building 'This arrangement involved the separation of the party, but it was difficult to offer objections, so they were forced to acquiesce to it Pre sent women came in bearing food boiled corn, milk in bowls and roasted (lead in plenty, which Leonard and Francisco ate with thankfulness Before they went to sleep Leonard looked into the courtyard, and was somewhat alarmed to find that guards were stationed at every door, while in front of those leading to the apartments of Joanna and Otter stood a body of priests with torches in their hands. He made an effort to pass through these guards in order to visit Juanna but without a word the) lifted their great spears and stopped him, and for that time he abandoned the art met " Why do the priests stand, before the door of the Shepherdess, boo a naked Leonard 1 " They guard the place of the gods ' she answered " Unless the gods will it, none may enter there "Say, Son," Leonard asked again, "are you not afraid of being here in your own lands' " I am much afraid, Deliverer, for if I am found out then I die Yet many years have gone by since I find few live who knew me, and, perchance, none remember me Also now I do not wear my hair after the fashion of my people, and therefore I may escape, unless the priests discover me by their mingle And now I would sleep ' On the following morning at dawn Leonard rose and, accompany d b> 1 Francisco, we went into the courtyard 'I his time the soldiers did not try to stop them, but the priests were still standing in front of Juimna a door, looking like spectres in the grey mist 'They went to them and signified by signs that they would worship the Queen but were stern!) refuse 1 admission in words which they could not understand, but that boy who was listening aftewards translated to them ' 1 he Mother had come to her home," said the spokesman, " and might be profaned no more by the eyes of the vulgar 1 he Snake also was in his home, and none should look upon him M lion arguments failed Leonard I tried to force his way through and was meth) huge spear pointed at his throat How things would have ended it is difficult to say had not Juanna herself appeared at this juncture, standing between the curtains of the door way. At the sight of her the priests and soldiers fell upon their faces and Leonard had sufficient presence of mind to follow their example, dredging Francisco down beside him " V hot in this tumult? also asked the guards in their own tongue I tell you who it is Juanna," said Leonard rubbing his head upon the ground and -speaking in 1 english "If you do not come to an understanding with these in firmed scoundrels you will be cut off from all communication with us, and what is more, we shall be out of t too in another way Will you be so good as to issue an order that we are to be admitted when we like ?" Joanna turned towards the priests and spoke angrily " Who has dared to forbid my servants to come before me and worship me ? My will is "Copy right 1891-92 the United States of America, by II Hitler Haggard The right of publishing this work UiKaiffhout the colonies of Australasia has bean putiiluwon by the proprietors of The mayor, my own, and I only make it known. It is my will that these white men and yonder black woman pass in before me at their pleasure " " Thy will is our will,' Mother," said the priests humbly. So they went in, and the curtains were closed behind them " I am so thankful to see you," said Juanita. " You don't know how dreadfully lonely it has been in this great room all night, and I am afraid of those solemn eyed priests who stand round the doors. The women who brought me food last night crawled about the place on all fours like dogs , it is horrible to " I am sorry you have been left alone," said Leonard, "but you must try to make better arrangements See might sleep with you, at any rate Where is Otter' Let us pay him a visit, I want to see how that god is getting on " John went to the door and addressed the priests, saying that she desired to be led before the Snake, and her servants with her. They demurred a little, and then gave way, and all four of them were conducted, first into the courtyard, in which no human being was to be seen, and thence into an adjoining chamber, where a curious sight awaited them. In ft huge chair set upon a, dais sat Otter, looking furious and by no means at ease ; while stretched upon the ground in front of him lay four priests, who muttered prayers unceasing). " Welcome, Baas ! ' he cried in rapture at the sight of Leonard. Welcome, Shepherdess " .' You fool I " answered Leonard or Dutch, but speaking in the most humble voice, and sinking to his knees " If you will not remember that you are a god I will break your neck so soon as we are alone. Bid these fellows begone , the Shepherdess will trans- late for you." " Go, dogs," said Otter, taking the line. ; " go and bring me food. I would speak with my servant, who is named Baas, and with my mother " "These are the words of the Snake that he speaks in the holy tongue," said Joanna, and she translated them. The four priests rose, and, bow mg to the earth, crept backwards from the room. As soon as they were gone Otter leapt from his throne with an exclamation of rage that caused the others to burst out laughing. "Laugh, Buua, laugh if you will" said the want, "for you have never been ft god and don't know what it is. What think you, Baas? All night long I have sat upon that great stool, while those accursed dogs burnt stinking s to II beneath my nostrils and muttered nonsense. One hour more and I should have fallen on them and killed them, for I have had no meat, and hunger makes me mad." " Hush I" said Leonard, " I hear footsteps I On to your throne, Otter! Quick, Tuanna ! Stand by his side, we will kneel I" -hey had barely time to obey when the curtains were thrown aside, and a priest entered, holding a vessel of wood covered with a cloth. Slowly he crept towards the throne, with his head bent almost to his knees ; then, straightening himself suddenly, he lifted up the wooden vessel, and cried aloud " We bring you food, O Snake, Fat and Be satisfied." Often took the dish, and, lifting the cloth, gazed upon its contents hungrily, but with an ever-growing dissatisfaction. " Son of a dog 1" he cried in his own tongue, " in this food to Bet before ft man" And he held the platter downwards, exposing its contents They were simple, consisting of various sorts of vegetables and water cress poor in quality, for the season was winter, and all of them uncooked In the centre of this fodder-whether placed there in obedience to some religious tradition or by way « orna- ment, or perhaps to assist the digestive process of the god, as a tenpenny nail is said to assist that of an ostriches as a fine ruby stone ; not so big, indeed, as that which Soft had given to Leonard, but still of considerable size and value. Leonard saw it with delight, but not so the dwarf the selfish promptings of whose stomach caused him to forget that his master had journeyed far to seek such gems as this in the fury of his disappointed appetite he stood upon the footstool of the throne, and, seizing the ruby, hurled it at the priest, hitting him fair between the eyes " Am 1 an eel," he roared, " that I should live on water grass and red gravel''' , Then the priest, terrified at the behaviour of this strange divinity, picked up the offend- ing gem-to the presence of which he attributed his anger-and led, never looking behind him Joanna and Francisco were seized with uncontrollable laughter, while even Soa deigned to smile, but Leonard did not smile " Oh, you last descendant of generations of asses I ' he said bitterly " Yon ass with four cars and a tenfold bray I What have you done now ? You have hurled the precious stone at the head of him who brought it and now he will bring no more. Had it not been for you doubtless with every meal I such stones would have been offered to you and though on grew thin we should all of us have become rich, and that without trouble " Forgive me, Bnas ' lamented Otter, " but m) race took away my) reason, and I forgot See now what it is to be a god It is to be fish on Btufi such as would stage an ox Oh Buas, I would that these devils had made in a cod and left in your servant I And again he agreed with disgust upon the water-rates and rows of either) vegetables resembling turnips ' You had better eat them Often said Joanna, who was still choking with laughter "If you don't, You may get nothing more for days Ludentlyjoa are supposed to have a small appetite " Then driven to ith) his ravening hunger, the wretched Otter fell upon the turnips and devoured them sullen!) Li armed rated him all the while for his linen died stupidity Scarcely had he finished his meal when there was a stir without, and once again priests entered headed on this occasion by that same BLAIR! man who had acted an spokes- man when Russia declared herself on the previous day, and who as tiny bud discovered was named Nain In fact, he had many other and much longer names but as this was the shortest and most convenient of them they adopt" d it It chanced that Leonard was standing by Soo and when this priest entered, whom she now saw for the first time, he noticed that she started, trembled and then drew back into the shadow of the throne ' Some friend of the old lady youth," thought Li entire to himself I hope that he won t recognise her that is all Nain bent himself in adoration before the gods nndthenbegan on address thesiibstnnee of which Juanna translated from time to time Bitterly did he grieve, he said, that such an insult had been offered to the Snake as the presenting to him about his food of the red stone known as the blood of Aca That men who had done this folly was doomed to die if, indeed, he were not already dead Well could they understand that, the Mother and Snake line nig become reconciled, the proffering to Jan of that which reminded him of the, sin of long ago was a ' wickedness that might bring a curse upon the land Let the Snake be appeased ¡ Command had been given that such stones should be hidden in a secret place b) him who had wrought the crime, not!, as he had mind, if the man returned alive from that place he should be slain But he would not return alive, for to go thither was death as it should be death henceforth even to mention that stone of which but one should now be seen in the land, that which the Mother was in memory of the past " O Otti r, my friend, ' murmured Leonard to himself, "it I don't pay you out for tins of) mine is not Outrain I ' But enough of the stones, went on Nain, he had come upon a greater matter That night an assembly of till the people would be held in the great temple an hour before moonrise, that the Mother and the Snake might take up their royalty in the presence of the people Thither they would come to lead them and their services At the op pointed time. Was this pleasing to the gods' Juanna bent her head in assent, and the priest turned to go with many obeisance; but before he went he spoke again, asking if all things were as the gods desired "Not altogether my servant,' answered Juanna "It is our will that these, our other servants, should have free access to us at all times and without question Also, it is our will that their food should be brought to them with our food Moreover, it is the desire of my son, the Snake, that no more grass should be given to him to ent, for now, in these latter days having put on the death of men, he needs that which will support the flesh One thing more my servant, the Snake forgives the affront that was offered him and I command that some of the greatest of the holy stones should be brought to me that I may look on the blood that I shed so long ago "Alas' it may not be, mother," answered the priest in tones of sorrow. "All the stones, red and blue together, have been placed in bags of hide and cast into that place whence they on be brought no more, together with him who offended Nor can others be gathered at this season of the year, seeing that deep snow covers the place where they lie buried in the summer, when the sun has melted the snow, more can be found if your eyes still desire the sight of them " Juanna made no answer, and the priest went " Here is a pretty business," said Leonard. " That idiot Otter has upset everything. We might have become millionaires for the asking, and now we must wait for months before we so much as get sight of a ruby or a sapphire " Nobody answered Indeed, the whole party were plunged into consternation at the fatal effects of this accident As for Offer himself, when he fully understood what he had done, he almost wept for grief. "Who could have known, Baas." he groaned. " It was the sight of the green food that bewitched me, who have always hated the taste of grasS And now my folly has un- done all, and it seems that I must be a sod for many months, if, indeed, they do not find me out ' "Never mind, Otter," stud Leonard moved to pity by the dwarfs genuine grief. " You have lost the stones and you will have to get them back somehow By the way, But, why did you start so when the old priest came into" "Because he is my father, DcIiver_r,*_i_tO answered. Leonard whistled , there was a new-comer operation. What if he should recognise her t CHAPTER XXII. THE TEMPLE OF SALE. In considerable agitation of mind Leonard bid good bye to Joanna, promising to return soon, and went to visit the Settlement men, whom he had not seen since the previous evening He found them in good case enough so far as their material comfort was concerned, for they were well supplied with food and warmly indeed so much could not be said however, for their mental state, for they were terrified by the multitude of solemn priests and warriors who watched them as cats catch mice Crouching round him dejectedly they implored Leonard not to leave them, saying that they expected to be murdered every minute He pacified them as well as he could and left them with the assurance that he would return presently, having first reminded them that the lives of- all depended upon the maintenance of the delusion as to the divinity of Otter and the Shepherdess 'The remainder of that day passed heavily enough After the first excitement of their strange position had gone by a. reaction set in, and everybody was much depressed As the hours drew on the mist, which had lifted a little about 10 o dock, closed in very densely, throwing the ill lighted chamber where they sat into a deep gloom In such an atmosphere conversation languished , indeed At times it died away altogether, and the only sound to be heard was that of the monotonous voices of the priests without the curtains as they muttered prayers unceasing At length Leonard could bear it no longer, but rose, declaring that he was going out to see whatever might be seen Juanna tried faintly to dissuade him, and Otter wished to come too which was impossible. The end of it was that he went alone -and he revisited the Settlement men and tried to cheer them, by process which they sadly needed Then he passed to the great gates of the palace and and looked through them The mist had lifted a little, and about a hundred paces away he could per serve the doors of the temple, on either side of which rose Cjclopenn walls fifty feet or more in height Here it was obvious that preparations for some ceremony were in progress, and on a large scale, for Immense crowds of people were gathered about the doors through which bodies of priests and armed soldiers passed continually More he could not leave, for the gates of the police yard were barrell and guarded, and the soldiers would not let him through. He stood and watched till sunset, then returned to the others and told them what he had seen. Another hour passed, and suddenly the curtains were drawn aside and a body of priests entered, twelve in number, because, large candles of fat in their hands, and headed by their chief Norn prostrating; themselves before Joanna and Otter, they remained plunged in silence " Speak on said Joanna at length, "We come, 0 Mother, and 0 Snake," said the priest Name, " to lead you to the temple, that the people may look upon their gods ' " It is well i lead on " First thou must be robed, Mother," said Nor, for without the temple none may look upon thy divinity, save thy priests alone " Then, rising as he spoke, he produced a black dress from a grass big, which was carried by an attendant This dress was very curious It fastened in front with buttons or horn, and either was, or seemed to be woven in a single piece from the softest hair of black fleeced goats. Moreover, it had sleeves just long enough to leave the hands of the wearer visible and beneath its peaked cap was a sort of mass with three Bhtn, two for the eyes and one for the mouth. Junnnft retired to put on this hideous gar- ment over her white robe, and presently reaper peared, looking like the black ghost of a medieval monk Then they gave her two Powers, a red lily and a white to be held in either hand, and it appeared that her equipment was complete Next they came to Otter and bound a slight fringe of hair about his forehead in such fashion that the fringe hid his face, at the same time placing in her hand a sceptre of ivory, apparently of very ancient workmanship, and fashioned in the shape of a snake standing on its fate. "All is prepared, ' saul Nain. " Lead on answered J Hanna again. " But let our servants come with us, both those here and those without, Bay. the woman only, who stay a to make ready for our return Juanna spoke thus because Son had announced her wish to be left behind when they went to the temple Joanna had consulted 1 tomorrow the subject, who gave it as her opinion that he had good reasons of her own for making this request Also, he pointed out that in case of disturbance, she could scarcely help them, and might possibly prove the encumbrance ' Jheywuit, answered Rain fell as prepared for the in also and as he spoke a sardonic smile flickered on his withered corn romance that made Leonard felt very uncomfortable A, hut was prepared, he wondered They passed through the curtains into the courtyard, where soldiers, clad in goatskin cloak, waited with two litters Here also were the betterment men, armed, but in an extremity of fun, for they were guarded by about fifty of the Great People, also armed, Joanna and Otter entered the litters, behind which Leonard formed up his little brain, going in front of It himself with Fran issue, both of them having rifles in their hands and revolvers at their girdles, of which no attempt was made to deprive them, for none know their use, They they unite., surrounded for tUt) bare. Breasted priests, who chanted and waved torches as they walked and preceded and followed by the grim lives of all soldiers, on whose spears the torchlight flashed ominously As they came the gates of the palace yard were opened They passed them and across the open space until they reached the doors of the temple, which were thrown wide before them Here Otter and Joanna descended from the letters, and all the torches were extinguished leaving them in darkness Leonard felt his hand seized and was led along he knew not where, for the mist) gloom was intense He could scarcely see the face even of the priest who conducted him, but from the sounds he gathered that all their party were being guided in a similar fashion Once or twice also he heard the voice of a Settlement man speaking in accents of fear or complaint, but such demonstrations of fire quickly followed by the sound of a heavy blow, dealt, no doubt, by the priest or soldier in charge of that individual Eu dently it was expected that all should be silent Presently Leonard become aware that they had left the open space across which they were walking, for the aft grew close and their footsteps rang hollow on the rocky floor " I believe that we are in a tunnel," whispered Francisco " Silence, dog hissed a priest in his ear u Silence, this place is holy ' They did not understand the meaning of the words at the moment, but the tone in which they were spoken made their purport sufficiently clear Leonard took the hint, and at the same time clutched his rifle more tightly He began to be afraid for their safety Whither were the) being led to a dungeon ' Well, they would soon know, and at the worst it was not probable that these barbarians would harm Juanna. They followed the tunnel or passage for about a hundred and fifty paces at first it sloped downwards, then the floor became level, till at length they began to ascend a stair There were 01 stone steps in this state way, for Leonard counted them, cook about 10in high, and when all were climbed they advanced 11 paces along a tunnel that echoed strangely to their steps, and was so low that they must bend their heads to pass it, Emerging from this tunnel through a narrow opening, they stood upon a platform also of stone, and once more the chill night mr formed their brows So dense was the gloom that Leonard could tell nothing of the place where they might be, bat from far beneath them rose a hissing sound as of seething water, and combined with it another sound of faint murmuring, as though thousands of people whispered each to each Also from time to time he heard a T-stung like that of a forest when a gentle wind stirs the leaves or the rustling of the robes of innumerable women This sense of the presence of hidden waters and of an inn Been multitude was strange and terrifying in the extreme It was as though the human faculties could, without perceiving them, suddenly become aware of the spirit of the unnumbered dead, thronging, watching, for lowing-there, but intangible , speaking without words, touching without hands Leonard was tempted to cry aloud, so great was the strain upon his nerves, which usually were strong enough , nor was he alone in this desire Presently a sound arose from below him, as of a person in h) stones and he heard a priest command silence in a fierce voice The sobbing and laughter went on till it culminated in a shrill scream After the scream came the thud of a blow, a heavy fall, a groan, and once again the invisible multi trades whispered and rustled "Someone has been killed,' mattered Francisco m Leonards ear, who is it, I wonder' Leonard shuddered, but made no answer, for a great hand was placed upon his mouth in warning At length the portentous quiet was broken and a voice spoke, the voice of Nam the priest In the silence all that he uttered could be heard plainly, but his words came from far away, and the sound of them was still and small "Hear me, ye Children of the Snake, ye ancient People of the Mist ! Hearken to me, Now, the priest of the Snake Many a generation gone in the beginning of time, so runs the legend, the Mother goddess whom we worship from of old descended from heaven and came hither to us and with her cargo the Snake, her son While she carried in the land the crime of crimes was wrought, the Darkness slew the Da) light, and she passed hence, we know not how, or where and from that hour the land has been a land of mist, and its people have wandered in the mist, for he whose name is Darkness has ruled over them, answering their prayers with death But this doom was on the son, that because of his wickedness he must put off the flesh of men and descend into the holy place of water, where, as we and our fathers have known, his number dwells eternally, taking tribute of the lives of men Yet ere that crime was wrought the mother gave a word of promise to her people ' Now I am about to die at the hands of him I bore, for so it is fated she said But not for ever do I leave you, and not for e i r shall my son be punished by putting off the (Italy of men Many generations shall go by and we will return again and rule over you, and the veil of mist shall be lifted from your hand, and we shall be great in the cn rile J ill then, choose yon kings and let them govern you moreover forget not my worship, and see to it that throughout the ages the altar of the Snake is wet with blood, and that he land is not the food be loves And I will give you a grip by which we shall be known when at length the fate is accomplished, and the hour of forgiveness is at hand As a fair maid will I come again, a maid lovely and white, but because of his son the Snake, my son, shall appear in the shape of that which sits within your temple, and his hue shall be blade and his face hideous. Out of the earth will we arise, and we will call to you and ye shall know this and we will tell you our holy names that shall not be spoken aloud from this hour to that hour of our coming But beware lest ye are deceived and false gods set themselves up among you, for then shall the last evil fall upon you ' Thus, Children of the Mist, did the Mother speak to him who was her chief priest in the long ago, and he grasped it with iron on the stone of that whereon Island And now the time is fall, and it has been given to me, his successor, in my old age, to see the fulfilment of the prophecy "The time is full, and this night the promise of the past is nccoinplnihtd, for, People of the Mist, the Mother and the Son, whose names are holy, have appeared to rate their children Yesterday they came, we saw them, and in your ears they called aloud the sacred names As a maiden fair and white and as a dwarf black and hideous have they come, and Aca is the name of the maiden and Jill is the name of the dwarf He ceased, and his voice died away in the echoes of the great place Once again there was silence, broke the only the seething sound of waters and the indefinable murmur of the unseen throng beneath Leonard stood still awhile then edged burn Belfgentlv forward with the design of discovering where and upon what they were standing His curiosity soon met with a violent shook, for In fore he had gone a yard he felt that his right foot was dangling in "space, and it was only by a strong effort that he prevented himself from falling, whither he knew not recovering, his balance he shutting himself back again to the side of 1 reminisce and whisper d a warm- to him not to move if he valued his life As he spoke he notio 1 that to the east Hu 1 lad ness of the night was turning, for with the light of the un risen moon Aln i by his rays Htrikinc. upwards brighten I the sky above and the intentions 1 < land and from the in fill a pale reflection which go v gradually Htrongcr mil eli art r Now he could discover that close upon him the tin lotta Hack IIIIIHS town 1 high into the air and Unit beneath him juice i I some thing like the foam on bri kin water for a time he was in 1 tins with (r whatever it might be until it Hmotliind i At munition from Francisco caused him to be the up train As he took 1 the edge of the full moon rose about the horizon, and b) slow d even a wonderful sight was revealed to him Not till the moon was fully up did he see every thing and to describe all as he discovered it, piecemeal, would be difficult, if not as possible this was what he saw at length Before him and beneath him was a vast and restless building open to the east cover winsome two acres of ground and surrounded by Titanic walls, fifty feet or more in height The building was shaped like a. Roman amphitheatre, but with the exception of the space immediately beneath him its area was filled with stone seats and round its v nat circumference stone seats rose tier on tier These were all occupied by men and women in thousands and, except at the further end Scarcely a place was empty At the western extreme of the building a huge statue towered seventy or eighty feet into the air hewn, to all appearance, from a mass of living rock At the back of this colossus, and not more than a hundred paces from it, the sheer mountain rose, precipice upon precipice, to the foot of the white peak clad in eternal snow It was this peak that they had seen from the plain when the mist lifted, and the statue was the dark mass beneath it which had excited their curiosity Uns Statue was fashioned to the shape of a huge seated dwarf of ludions countenance with bent arms outstretched in a slightly for ward direction, and palms turned upwards as though to bear the weight of the sky This fearful colossus stood, or rather sat, upon a platform of rock, and not more than four paces from its base, so that the outstretched hands and head bent slightly forward over hung it indeed, was a circular gulf measuring perhaps thirty yards across, in which seething waters rated and boiled Whence they came and whither they went it was impossible to see, but Leonard discovered afterwards that here was the source of the river which they had followed for so many days Escaping from the gulf by underground passages that it had hollowed for itself through the solid rock the two branches of the torrent passed round the walls of the town, to unite again in the plain below How the pool itself was supplied Leonard was destined to learn m after days so nothing need be said of it here Between the steep polished sides of this rock basin and the feet of the statue was placed an altar, or sacrificial stone Here on this ledge, which covered an area no greater than that of small room, and in front of the altar stood a man bound in whom Leonard recognised Olfan, the king, while on either side of him were priests naked to the waist, and armed with sacrificial knives Behind them again stood the little band of Settlement men, trembling with terror, nor were their fears groundless, for there among them lay one of their number dead This was the man whose nerves had broken down, who had shrieked aloud in the darkness, and in reward had been smitten into everlasting silence All this Leonard saw by degrees, but the first thing he saw has not yet been told Long before the brilliant rays of the moon at the amphitheatre they struck upon the huge head of the dwarf idol, and there, on this gold) perch, some seventy feet from the ground, and nearly a hundred above the level of the seething pool of water, set Juanna herself, enthroned in an ivory chair She had been divested of her black cloak, and was clad in the robe of snowy linen cut low upon her breast and fastened round her waist with a girdle Her dark hair Rowed about her shoulders, in either hand she held the lilies, red and white, and upon her forehead glowed the ruby like a blood red star She sat quite still, her eyes set wide in horror, and first the moon light gleamed upon the gem bound to her forehead, next it showed the white and lovely face beneath, then her snowy arms and breast, the whiteness of her robes and throne, and the hideous demon head where on it was fixed No spirit could have seemed more beautiful than this woman Bet thus on her dizzy throne in that dark place of blood and fear Indeed, in the unearthly light she looked like a spirit, the spirit of beauty triumphing over the hideousness of hell, the angels of light trampling the devil and his works It was not wonderful that this fierce and barbarous people sighed like reeds before the wind when her loveliness dawned upon them, made ethereal by the moon, or that thenceforth Leonard could never think of her quite as he thought of any other woman Under such conditions most well favoured girls would have appeared beautiful, Juanna did more, she seemed divine As the light grew downward and the shadow B thinned before it, Leonard followed with his eyes and presently discovered Otter The dwarf, naked except for five birdies and the fire upon his head, was also enthroned, holding the ivory sceptre in his hand, but in a seat of ebony placed upon the knees of the colossus, nearly forty feet below Juanna Then Leonard turned to consider 1 rancisio s position and his own, and found It terrible enough Indeed, the moment that he discovered it was nigh to bring his last, for, in company with two priests of the brake, they were standing on the palm of the right hand of the idol that formed a little platform some six feet square which they had won in the darkness through a tunnel hewn in the arm of stone 1 here, they stood unprotected by any making or support, and before them and behind them was a sheer drop of Home ninety feet to the water beneath or to the rock of the platform Leonard BOW, and for a moment turned Fruit and dizzy, then dropping the butt of Ina mile on to the stone, he found upon the barrel till his brain cleared
