Whilst ?ebe^rafi hdlding a ehorfc discourse with a good lodkmg, baeniess-like lady, boxed up carefully in -a . lamxopboard-Idnd -of office near the -entrance doors, the gentleman was shouting at eacfr flyman in1 turn, and threatening1 proceed ings, mnd Seeling very««refanyJiiBrightbaaid -&eek-bonB.; j^iinm tna -got-a litfiedamagedin I&e; miZee,'aa3.: expfereaing it «11 *o fb.e police- Tnan, who somewbat - later, and utterly breafh iesB from xtaming, iia€ now arrived upon the cetee. ^'Mr.IwTOfct and Ifess Loratt,0' were the jouiig^ladyfe nrsfr^rords.

'ISTo. 40,' said the cashier, briskly_setting off- an .electric bell in regions remote, and then ftnrninp to the next comer,- who also required Information and attention, and who was the flaxen- haired occupant of the second fly which had come suddenly to-grief. The gentleman had with . gentlemanly politeness turned to Miss Smith, and raised his hat .witKaneasy flourish. 'Itiust you have not been very., mucn inconvenienced by .the collision?' hefaid. 'Thank you; no.' 'It might have been a serious .accident for both of us.' '' It ibos clnmsy,' -was the quiet answer. The tall, fair-haired, heavily-moustached man looked down at the little .fair-haired woman who regarded him fora fleeting instant gravely and even .critically, and. then turned to a prim, chambermaid, who was at her side now, waiting to escort her to her room, and proceeded to follow her .up the staircase. As Miss Smith turned the first bend of the broad .stairs she glanced down into the hall tind towards the counting-liouEe. The fair haired man -was talking to the lady cashier, and the cashier had disappeared -into her ledger again lor fresh -information, and the porter or the hotel was bustling in with.the luggage. 'Do you.know that gentleman 2' she asked of the maid, mho had followed her enquiring gaze over the oaken baluster. 'Wo, ma'am.' ' Not a regular visitor here?' 'I have sever seen him before, ma'am.' 'Indeed!' The maid looked surprised ; but Miss Smith did not explain why it had evidently surprised Iver that the .gentleman had not been 'seen before at the Grand, but -proceeded on her .way to No. 402, .with a pair o! bright grey eyes fixed upon the *tair -carpet now, A3 though she were counting the etepsup.to her room. People were descending the stairs ;utcon siderafele numbers as *he went up, and the head waiter -was ifranttcaHyAangiag^t atgong in the hallwdth* drumrstick, and' sending-the echoes flying into distant looms aadconadors, imparting the warning. ithat jthe TJinnpx at 'the table d'hote was . ready, and ithat people mth appetites— andthpyakU eviSenfly had appetites in Scarletpool— hadietter lookaharp and get seated. **The hotel is Tery fall,' remarked Mary Smith.

Maxy^Smitii had haTdly «at down when' a vacant chair -at her fade was immediately ?occu- pied, and the flaxen-haired young man; now^in full dress, was once more beside her.

Once or twice lie looked oui of the corners cf his-eye tit Mary Smith, but «he was busy with ter-soup^nd did not seem to Jsnow.thatJie was interested in her, .and waa,:indeed,Jmore calm and self -possessed : under the general . table d'hote eeca&agiSam; he .was. 'Had shei)een:a visitor there lor many .weeks amd .known everybody present, shexouldnol have been jnore .completely .at /bar .-.ease,; ithe long rows of faces, of all shapes and sizes, colors -and patterns, did not j confuse her— indeed, between the courses greatly interested her, ior by degrees she h?-^ taken stock :of them, quietly and unobtrusively, but effec tively. The people befomher at ihe principal table near the .'bay windows interested her far more .than her gopd-lookingxompanion with theiedfcar upon. his cheek. Toiim:she was studiously reserved,. like a woman adopting .an extra degree of frigid demeanor that was not natural to her, in order to check any 'ad- vances' which her instincthadassured her might be made if she were more 'gracious.' Mary Smith was a young ?woman on guard, and the flaxen-haired man seemed to be aware of it ako, and to keep 'himself to himself' as if afraid of her. Mary Smith drank water with her dinner, and he indulged in _a bottle of champagne, the consumption of which loosened his tongue at last. He had eat long enough silent it struck him, and amidst the general hum of conversation, which was increasing in tone and depth, his voice was at last heirS addressing his neighbor— ' I am not mistaken in thinking you.are the lady whose- carriage came into disagreeable proximity with mine'?' he said; and bo sud denly that Mary Smith give a little start Mary Smith bowed her'head in assent, but did not answer him. 'I was afraid .at the time you.might be hurt, for you were pitched about a little roughly,' he continued. ** I was aw fully sorry, bnt I was quite helpless, of coursed' 'Yes,' was the laconic reply, slowly de livered. The gentleman waanot daunted by the apathy with which his .remarks were received. He was not used to that 'kind of treatment, and there was no lair reason why the lady should be so excessively Irigid in Jier deportment to wards him, as on hisiownpart he had not. the least wish to be. obtrusive. He had a strong objection to be. snubbed, however, and & cari osity to see if lie could 'beat down this icy barrier between them— a.kindx-f obstinate feel ing that he was not to be 'shut up.' at a, mo ment's notice, and a determination «ven not to be shut npbyaxhiiof a^girllikethis, in a grey lTrench.menno too.
