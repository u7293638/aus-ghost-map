UNPACKING. M0 J J faded of garb, and dejected of mien, . | | Minus one arm, and one glassy eye, ; \ | Say, by what chance have you lain unseen, \ | Dolly-my dolly-in days gone by. I Safely you came from our northern clime, | Safely you sailed to this land of the sun, | Hidden with treasures of later time, | Ah, but, my dolly, 'twas cruelly done. § For, at sight of you, mystical visions arise | Of a small, wee phantom that lived of yore-- | That lived a child under English skies, | A happy child on the English shore. .; | Listen, for. I was that tiny ghost, | And you were my friend in the long ago. \ Though you gave me a cold contempt at most, b Yet oh, my dolly, I loved you so. | And even to-day your orb of blue * Pierces my heart as I mind me when J The shaft came fatally straight and true d From the bow of that tyrannous brother of ten. <* And what was his bright new shilling to me ? I And how could his penitent kisses atone ? | There was only a hole where your eye should be, | And I.felt I would rather have lost my own. fl ' . ' f* And your tattered frock with its purple stains; ) Wakens a memory lons? unroused : Of life in the leafy Sussex lanes, When the blackberries hung from the autumn .\ boughs. ¡Í il And.where is the grace of your golden locks? ? | And what were we dreaming of, you and I, : I When we stood that day on the wàve-wasted 1 ; rocks, . :\ And gazed at the summer sea and sky P J Were we lifting the veil of the far-off years? \t Gould we follow a tall ship's southward flight? 'J And know we should watch through a mist of k tears '. . . ¡3 Those brown old boulders fade from sight? n Did we see?-but a sharp cry rent the air, i And the pool was deep, and my efforts vain; . 1 For the salt, salt wave closed over your hair, Ï And you knew that it never would curl again. j Twenty long years Bince that day have passed ; (Merciless Time how you swell the sum), Youth is following childhood fast. Oh, my dolly, why have you come ? Twenty years back I was idle and free, Now I have work in the world to do ; Vainly the old days press their plea- r ¿ Dolly, my life has no room for you. i : Nay, but I know of a dainty grave, .;' ! Fit for the fancies that round you cling, ; In the far, wide bush where the gum-trees wave, And the wattle-blossoms bloom and spring. ' And there we will lie through the sunny hours,: As we lay, when the young June grass was green, Half smothered in English meadow flowers, > You and myself as I once have been. And there shall all vain regrets be laid, And shadowy memories buried deep, While close in the arms of my own small shade; Dolly, my dolly, you'll softly sleep. E. H. M. j
