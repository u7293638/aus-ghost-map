SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB MEETING. The first day's racing of the Adelaide Cup meeting of the South Australian Jockey Club tookplaco on Saturday, at Fiemington. It is somewhat to bo regretted that each club should hold its meetings at other places than its own headquarters, it is satisfactory to know that in the present case a success financially has been achieved. Tills result wns no doubt due to the splendid weather with which the clnb was favored on tho opening day, and there was also a considerable amount of in terest felt with reference to tho decision of the Goodwood Handicap. Theso two causes induced largo numbers to patro nise tho special -trains which commcncod to leave Spencer-street at eleven a.m., and though there was no uncomfortable crushing encli train was well filled. The road was also fairly patronised, and before the principal event of the afternoon was run thoro must have been at least 10,000 persons present. His Excelloncy tho Governor, accompanied by Lady Loch and suite drove down, reaching tho course just before tho Hurdle Raco was run, and remaining till the last race. Although the meeting was under tho management of the stewards ot tho S.A.J.C. the details wcro all carried out by tho V.R.C. officials in that comploto and satisfactory man ner characteristic of Fiemington. Business commenced with tho First Hurdlo Race, for which only five went to tho post, and as Old Soul was stancbly supported by tho Fiemington party, 6 to 4 was the best offer against him at the finish. Echo was next in demand, and the other two competitors, Sir Patrick and Gasalior, wero backed, but Yellow Hammer was quite friendless, Tho favorito mado nearly all the running, but Sir Patrick, very judiciously ridden by Ferguson, got on terms at the last hurdle, where Old Soul blundered slightly, and oventually won a oanital raco by half a length. The St. Lcgcr only had a trio of runners, and Silver King, who looked soft, was made nn oven tnonoy favorite. The Broker, who was in splendid heart, wns backed by his party at 6 to 4, but Sandal, who wns anything but fit, was not at all fancied. Tite maro mnde most of the innrnnv nt a good pace,; bnt sho was beaten as they turned into tho straight, where Tho Broker shot- up, and th6'iigh" Silver King wns ridden out' in n most determined manner by Mooro ho oould never got itp, and suffered a neck defeat, with Sandal beaten off. Tho Broker, -who was pur chased by his present owner after tho recent Syduey meeting, has paid for himself in his first race, and the successes obtained by St Lawrtnco and The Broker so soon nttcr they changed hands must be any thing but a pleasant reflection to their former owners. Aftor lunch, which .was ono of Mr. Straker's best efforts, tho twenty competitors for the Goodwood Handicap were saddled, and as usual there was a rush to tho paddock to watch tho operation. Topaz, as first favorite, naturally attracted tho most attention, nnd there cortninly could not bo found any fnult with hiscondition.asho looked mellow, and was bright in his coat. St. Lawronco nnd Lord Wilton wero two horses whoso- condition commendod itself to good judges. whilo the plain looking Ghost was very well. Ringwood did not please, but St. John, Duenna and Uncus could not bo found much fault with. Lantern, who was re ported last wook to have suffered sevorely on his voyage from Adelaide, did not show tho effects of his knocking about, as ho was fresh and appeared -to havo done a good preparation. In the market Topaz was very firm at-d to 1, St. Lawrence 6 and t „ i Wilton 8, beingnoxt, nnd thencamoSt. John' Lantern ai tens, Middlemarch, Duenna tin and Ironmaster were returned at 12 to l n i 20 to 1 wns on offer about any of tlieothn The raco needs no description, as I nn torn, who was ono of the firr away, incrensed his lead the further h„ went and eventually won in a canter In- lengths from Lord Wilton. Tho victor)- wlS was ono o! tho easiest over achieved' on nm racecourse, showed what an absurd handimn tho impost allotted to Lantern was. Topuz u-1, got badly away, was never dangerous at nn, part of the race, but under anv circumstances not ono of them could have had tho slightest chanco with tho winner. Lantern who is a powerful brown horso, though lacking in quality, has won several races in South Aus traits, and his party havo landed a good stnko by his win. Tho Sires Prodi, Stakes had only thrco runners, i,J Juanna was so rushed that 3 to 1 on hw was the best prico the fielders would accent Tho result proved tho correctness of the market operations, as tho filly won in a canter from Remus, Tho Teacher, who was second favorite being last all tho way. Tho Victoria Handicap' half a mile, was tho last raco of tho day, and' as there was no less than twenty-one runners there was somo heavy hotting. Meerschaum and Meander were the best favorites at 5 to 1 each, and of the others Salvo, Surprise Ace, Honora, Miss Merlin and Pyretto were all backed. The latter showed how good she is over half a mile by winning cleverly from Meander and Honora, nnd thus concluded a very good afternoon's racing, though it was very evident that in soveral of the races there were a number of " waitists" whoso timo was vet lo como.
