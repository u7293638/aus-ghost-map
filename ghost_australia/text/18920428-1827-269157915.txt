Peter Petrovitch asked, beeomin tired of waitiug for his turn; and then father and sou kissed each other on eai-b cheek " Why, what a-prince you are, with your seal-skin cap and your seal lined coat!

They were very proud ..that day, though till 1863 they bad been serfs, who worked for themselves, it is true, but paid obrok to their lord fo.r the permission to be absent from bis estate. ISlizabe: h Petrovna had kept the best millinery shop in Vol dai, and Peter. Petrovitch had been a. builder; and dealer, in wood, bark, hides, aud general merchandise : but though they were, fairly well-to-do before, the Law of Emancipation was promulgated, still, up to that time, their-nolilp., lord might, legally, ^hav seized their all, and have reduced them to the position of field house serfs.. Ifow they had a son who w£ member of the new bar; and it was well kjjo-vu t' 1 ". 1 ' they were the richest couple in Voldai,. since the old lord, had been ruined by the Bmanci pation., Act. The government, took the greater part of thebarrin's land in order to hand it oyer to the emancipated " souls." and . they paid him • only eighty per cent, of the government valuation, in...nptgs. .whichjwere : at .^ai'scoiuA-t "of jJffiJ jier tcm^^^Tiiiit? ho really r.ec'pivoA less ttiau.twoJthii*d's of wooden articles, which bad paid hiui well in the past, ceased to be remunerative, as the emancipated ear. peuters wanted high wages, and did their work badly ; and worst of all, the barrio, finding himself in. possess ion of an unusual quantity of ready money, went to St. Petersburg, aud treated his'capital as" income. Peter Petroyijich—;the .surname,; of fSa.Tat.off was assumed at ajater date—became the steward of the absent nobleman and when Peter Petrovitch 1 >ok his son to the University of St.. Peters, burg,.lie had to take iiot. only a. note of introduction from bis noble master, but also one of greater value; bearing the signature of the governor of the Petersburg Bank, in order to'.'induce, the rector to admii;. a youth, -of such low origin.
