THE LAUREATE'S ODE TO THE QUEEN. MESSRS STRAHAN AND CO have just completed their handsome library edition of Alfred Tennyson's works and in no more fitting and appropriate form have the Laureate's poems 01 or gone forth to the public. The two closing volumes, the fifth and sixth, contain the perfect Arthurian hopes, on which the poet has labored so long, and with such lingering devotion Here at last we have a consistent and doGmto arrangement of the many Idylls of the King, beginning with the " Coming of Arthur" attributing to the latest published of all, " Groth and JTjy notes," the first place among the legends of the Round Table mid closing, after the passionate poem in which Gui- nevere's sorrow and repentance also portrayed, with the first, and in some respects the host of all the Idylls, " The Passing of Arthur, first published a full generation ago.

Our colonial readers will note with interest the stinging allusion to the articles of the Times with respect to the future of Canada. An unenviable distinction is conferred on the loading journal by introducing its recent startling suggestions about Canada as " a strain of shame." And that the North, whereof we lately heard A strain to shame us "Keep you to your SOIVOB ; So loyal is too costly ! Monds-your love Is but a burthen LOOse the bond, and go." Is this the tone of empire P bore the faith That made in rulers ? At the first meeting of the Colonial Institute the quoting of those lines by Lord Bury, and his comments upon them, caused the greatest enthusiasm. There were present on that occasion representatives of many of the British colonies, Their prolonged cheers which rung out in favor of a consolidated union of the Empire and her colonies, were proof that a fervent loyalty to the mother- country prevails throughout her dependencies. The election of the Poet Laureate as an honorary member of the Colonial Institute was, on such an occasion, a graceful and appropriate act London Colonial News. THE present session of Parliament (says the S. M. Herald of the 18th instant will be pro- rogued by His Excellency the Governor to-day, at noon. The House met on the 5th of November last year for the despatch of business, and from that time to the present there have been ninety-three sittings. A remarkable feature of the session has been this-that honorable members have invariably made a quorum, and this is, no doubt, largely attributable to the change in the hour of meeting from 3 to 4 o'clock. On the few occasions when the House has been counted out it has commonly hues period after midnight, and always at a late hour. Never before have honorable members devoted so much of their time to public business and as to the results of their labors, for which they will no doubt be thanked to-day, a grateful country may be left to judge. It will be seen from our Parliamentary report that several bills were returned from the Legislative Council to the Assembly last night, and only await the assent of His Excellency the Governor to 1 become law. ?
