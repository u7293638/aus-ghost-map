'Something to His Advantage.' This is the title of a ' Christmas serial, 311st published in Sydney. It might have been called a Christmas melody; for it is a collection of tales, sketches, poems and essays, good, bad, and indifferent, containing something suited to all tastes. It is the . product of the literary efforts of about thirty authors, associated — not combined, for tne editor tells us in tne preface that he could not persuade them to write as he intended in writing one tale — tut gathered within one cover. If one wishes for sentimental poetry dedicated to Love or to Melancholy, here he will find it. If one prefers the most unfettered jocularity of an Australian 'spree,' here it is. If one likes to be introduced to murderers and suiciders, here he will meet them. If another prefers to have crime and tragedy exhibited in dreams, with a- happy awaking, here he will be pleased. The lover of ghost-stories, or other super natural or spiritualistic disclosures, may have a feast to his own liking. If the reader can find delight in ihyme, meted out by a carpenter's rule, or in prose, that savours more of dullness than of wit, this book will supply him. Of course, in euch a compound, every one may open upon what he dislikes. But if some philosopher turns away irom the first contribu tion as smacking too much of room, let him go to the last, and he will find a lofty speculation altogether to his taste. If a young lady shudders at the coarse oaths of the 'lambing down' party, she may havener sympathy drawn out for ' Blind Madge ;' and those who are satisfied with fiction can turn to ''A Page from Australian History,' or ' Paddy's Market.' The editor is Mr. Kichmond, and the publishers Messrs. Turner and Henderson, Hunter-street.
