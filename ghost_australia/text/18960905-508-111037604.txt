''' 'Laertes' doubles, with, the 'First -Actor,' and-; often with 'The 'Ghost;' -the Ghost can double with the King, but it is seldom done; for, apart from' the rapidity of the change of costume, the pointed difference between the _ personnel of . the two brothers, as shown by Hamlet ('No more like ( my father, than I to Hercules'), would be difficult to overcome. Polonius doubles with the Priest in the graveyard scene, and so on;- indeed, there are many ways of changing and doubling to suit the strength of a company. There are few colo nial companies that could play 'Hamlet' without doubling. I noticed a little time back that a cer tain actor boasted that he had played six parts in a single play; but that is not by any means a re cord. I heard Ned: Holloway say .when short handed once in a long-cast melottrama, 'How many parts has George M ? got?' 'Six.' .'Give him another— it will keep him out of mis chief.' He himself on another similar occasion said, 'Ah! I can manage to double this; I .will put — on — a^-cloak— -and — a— beard, and who— the dickens— will know— me.' We laughed immoder ately, for the humor of the thing lay in the in ability of 'Ned' to sink his identity, his voice being deep and sonorous, and his style of delivery peculiar; it was, and is, his Habit to enunciate each single word, little or big, with remarkable clear ness and emphasis, which would be recognised through a dozen disguises. Like the ass in Aesop's fable clothed In the lion's skin, as a lay. .figure in such a case he might have passed mus ter, but once he opened his mouth he betrayed TiJTTIgpif, .''..'. ! ;i-may ilmd^jtake itolcqyself ihe credit of record breaktngin .theatrical -doubles, for, with .the samp admirable Nefl/.ln'.'&ie; early days of iny novitiate, in a drama called 'Time and.

I was a -young enthusiast in the profession, and took no end of trouble to make a marked change in each personation, -with- the' result that I had a ;.pile,of clothes, .heaped Tip in the owner of the ?'Saredsing-rpom, -.Chat would have made a very re «pectable'sta-t-;fp'r.' .a 'second-hand dealer.

Neither was I. I can ^|ptt'Tjeineinbef.. the styles of character in 'Time Iftd TJide' 'that. I ^'endeavored to assume, but I »knpw that itKey, numbered thirteen-rthe unlucky niinibeiS— and consisted of a waiter, a flunkey, a policeman,' a .cabdrivcr, the captain of a ship, a street musician, a magistrate, and many others of equal 'importance. . But I became wiseV, my ar dor cooled, and I looked upon all 'doubles,' except legitimate ones, with a wary eye. In 'Macbeth' every character that can be spared goes on in the witch scenes, and I have seen some strange guises adopted that have been snatched up in a hurry. 1 For instance, i modern 'blanket in the alarm of fear caught up' is an o3d substitute for a witch's cloak. - The same may. be said of a lady's water proof, though with the hood it is not so bad. A 'possum rug- has done duty in the scene; also a patchwork .quilt. Of course, this refers not to the principal witches or to Hecate, but to the minor witches, many.of whom have been feasting at the banquet, and have, 'stood not upon the order of their going,'' but have dashed off the wings to be ready for the' weird scene. At the Lyceum, ,in London, I opine Sir Henry Irving does not resort 'to such stratagems. . ? . ? Some law '.court scenes, as represented on the stage,' are very funny, to my mind, at times being remarkably good, at others bordering on bur lesque. In the trial scene of the 'Merchant of Venice' I remember an actor who was called up on to play the. Duke who is seated on a throne. He was a nervous man, and the part was perhaps a little beyond ids capability. No doubt he felt this, for he wrote his part out in large hand, and placed it before him on his desk. But by some means, when Ihe time came it had become entang^ led in the folds of his voluminous * robe, and the long speech- in which the Duke admonishes and advises^Shyloclc to be merciful was cut down to ^Shjtibek, the world thinks, and I think so to-r-. We all. expect a gentle answer, Jew.' It is scarcely necessary -to say that Shylock, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, and the whole court, were astounded; but. the piece -went on. The Duke dis covered his - missing manuscript, and spoke all the ensuing, lines correctly, of course, though with downcast eyes. Strange to say, the audience did not seem to/iiotice the : extraordinary omission; The actor; received:: a Bound 'Wiggins,' and he was no more entrusted with anv'-important part. The, court scene in. 'Oliver Twist' would often. I; think cause 'Dickens to turn in'. his grave, for ihe magistrate Is often beguiled into buffoonery. The trlal'.scene *?BardeU-v.

The trial scene in 'Arrah-na- Pogue' is essen tially Irish, and much latitude is allowable; but even that is 'overdone at times by the peasantry, who in places do not recognise the gravity of Shavjn's situation. If' actors are at home in a law court on the stage, they are not always so when they take their place in the box where it is a reality. Again, . there are 'others who bamboozle lawyers, and by long habit of facing the public are not prone to be nervous. The low comedian, always a favor ite with the public, is welcome to the habitues of a law court; but they are sometimes disappointed, for low comedians are not always funny 'off' the stage. Once I saw a lady of considerable stage experience go into the witness-box. She kissed the book in auite a melodramatic style, turning up her eyes to the ceiling, as though heaven were somewhere there.- A few minutes' crossexamina tion completely discomposed her; she lost all' her nerve, and burst inttf tears. The late Johnny Hydes, in Dunedin, once summoned a quondam friend for an - assault. The thing was a trivial affair, but it occupied the court for some time, and the magistrate was on the point of inflicting a small fine, when Hydes said jocularly: 'But, lor'! I don't want to prosecute or press the case.'. 'You .don't want the defendant fined, then?' 'Not I. I only want to caution him. Lor'! we are the best of friends, your 'Worship. I knew his father and mother.. I don't want him. punished.' 'Why didn't you -say so before, and save the time of the' court. The case is dis missed,' said the amused magistrate. Hydes and 'Bob' walked o.ut of -court arm-in-arm, and had a drink. They are both dead years ago.
