! UNITY v. DR. O'QUINN. TO THE EDITOB OF THE MOENTNQ BULLETIN. SIB,-Judging from the tone end temper of " Unity V reply, he evidently winees under the lash of which he received a ealutory appli- cation in your issue of the 26th ultimo. Se is exceedingly wroth for being taken as the Siamese shade or aller ego of Ombra in the Courier, that still mysterious Pepper's ghost personage who in Catholio circles down here is j still keenly remembered for his inhuman and I pitiless pelting of the late poor Bishop, With the zeal of an enthusiast, or rather to use a couple of Unity's delicate expletives that of a " vulgar partizan ' he casts the aegis of his lamblike protection over thia nebulous being of whom he says " It has been persistently at- tempted to fasten on one gentleman everything of this nature wbichappearsinthe press, thong! he has frequently denied it publicly and calle! on the editors or the newspapers to bear test mony of his assertions, which they have invas ably done hy corroborating these, and thouçb. dozenB of Catholics are known to hire written at various times in condemnation of the late Bishop." There's a sweet euphonies little sentence from one who disclaims havng ever written a line against Br. O'Quinn, mt of whom elsewhere he interpolates that ' if ' HibernicuB ' has really the memory of he late Bishop at heart, and is not a mere vuVar partisan he will not oblige me to say al I know upon the eubject, and upon some otters connected with it." That is truly a lyal utterance of a devoted son of the church ibo, not satisfied with all the odium and oblquy heaped by h¡B bosom friend "Umbra" flajBe""' Bishop in the flesh, threatens to défárainud blacken him «till further in the tomb, the last sad resort ol a malevolent and implacable foe. Of all malingers the most cruel _ and despicable is he who thus deliberately aims a Judas-like stab at tho fame and memory of his own Bishop, but late the^horacra^^,,^ - of Christ. That ¿^"V^^^I^^^^H no apologist or defender in the^H^^^^^^^^K " Hibernions." His wbole^Kf^^^^^^^H aimable and beneficent chara< lerçlfl^^^^^^H exemplary and truly Christian deatn^H^^PH rebut with interest every calumnyJKw^La ever gross, which "Umbra" or "0OTEy"^B could utter against him. What ilia the grávame* of the highest earthly offenoe^^H af which they would dare arraign biro^^H simply that he had by bis sagacious foresigs^^H and for a sacred purpose succeeded in amasain^^^H immense and princely revenues, every thj^^^^H of which had been years ago demised bj)t^^^^B for the sole benefit of the Church, leaviog^^^^H even a fraction to friend or relative î*|^^^^B| world. Neither does " Unity " etrcngM^^^fl his canso against the Bishop by bis unbecomiaj^^H aud uodignilicd attack on the social statuafi^^H your correspondent "llibernicus." HeassenJ^^H that all who know him believe him anworthJ^^H of credit, or as he clinically expresa cs it, " Io Rockhampton it is as well to let people know once for all the measure of thia indivi- dual, and the disgraceful tactics with which he and some others like him brought discredit on the cause of the late Bishop which they Pretended to defend." He further adds, *' We know that " Hibernicus" said also that the sisters of St, Joseph left the diocese of their own free will." Now sir, I positively assert and declare I never dictated or penned a line to the press affecting the Sisters of St. JoaepU'.or the depasture from the diocese at any trite what- soever. And at for my " disgraceful tactics" I cannot charge my memory with aught during a residence of eighteen years of which I have reason to feel ashamed, i tad, in all conscience, I think my antecedents a^fjfk^aileter would bear favourable com ^Rj^H;t least as a Catholic-with those of the fiSK""'* who now poses in your pages as such s^V¡m*0ulste model of religious unity. Some of^yo3f^Ejlikfi|sMaaders, I have no doubt, would f^Tt»pPñWtt»r or two for hit name or bontfjidrs in this business. Will he kindly leave his oard at your office, as I do miue, with full liberty to show it to any ] inquirer interested in knowing who and what your correspondent may be. Thanking you in the meantime for your courtesy, and promising not to again abuse your indulgence under the shelter of anony- mity, or until " Unity " removes bia mask.
