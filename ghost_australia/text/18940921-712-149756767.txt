CHILDREN'S COLUMN. The Old and the New Year. No pause, no rest, no visual line Between the years that come and go ! For some too fast, for some too slow ; Time never stops to sleep or dine, But on and on, with steady flight He keeps, untired, by day—by night; And boys and girls, ere yet aware, Find threads of silver in their hair, Their love of quiet growing stronger, And haply by these tokens know, What kind friends told them long ago, That they are boys and girls no longer. Still on—as silent as a ghost ! Seems as a score of days, all told, Or but a month or two, at most, Since our last New Year's song we troll'd, And lo ! that New Year now is old. And here we stand to say Good-bye," Brief words—and yet we scarce know why, They bring a moisture to the eye, And to the heart some quakes and aches. We speak them very tenderly, With half a sob and half a sigh— Old year, good-bye ! Old year, good-bye ! -Selected.
