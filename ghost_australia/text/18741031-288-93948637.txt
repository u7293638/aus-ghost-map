'Mr.. Wilkinson com-^ menced with an explanation of '.the Mosaic and Okristian dispexuta'tions, contending that Jesus Christ, whilst being the second Adam, was the very Man and the very God, the fourfold attri butes of human nature being united in Him. He then spoke of the antagonism exasttng be tween Christ and Antichrist, which, he said, was a direct evidence .of our Redeemer's* advent, and exhorted his listeners that as their Creator had given, them certain powers, those powers they should use in striving for _j| mastery over prevalent sin. The Apostles at the beginning of the Christian dispensation he referred to as having been the givers of the Holy Ghost', and the orderers of God's worship. The men of the present generation had an idea that they could arrange the order of their wor ship as they wished, but this he combated as men blasphemy. Jesus Christ sought to pre pare the Churohes for His coming if they would but be warned. He asked them if they did not covet that resurrection. Tet the Church, he pointed out, must be united In .a bond of heart and spirit before the 'dread event took place. Theyshould, toeffeot that end, gather themselves into a universal fellowship, not that they should form a new sect — not that they 'should form a new Church, because Christ bad instituted the Church on Pentescot, bu L cause tbey should be made Teady for tbe clemn futuie which awaited them alL Theie was distinct evidence of the Saviour's resurrection, he argued, in the present neglect of the ordinance of THa holy supper, and in the divided and distracted condition of the different bodies of his disci pies. He advised them therefore to commune with their pastors and their friends in regard to this all-important topic,Jso that they might be chastened and purified to welcome the re. awakening of their Lord, and so that when He came He should not take them as a thief in the night. The lecturer, who was attentively listened to, explained tbat one of the daily papers had misrepresented him in speaking of. him as professing to be an apostle, since he only^ professed to be an evasgelist 'serving under the Restored Apostles of our Lord.' ' They are coming — the grasshoppers' —says the Pastoral Times, ' in millions. The air is thick with them on the plains.

At the establishment of the Melbourne Photographic Company, in Rundle-street, may be seen the prizes won by South Australian ticket holders in tve Melbourne Art Union. These pictures are all by colonial artists on Aus- ^ tralian subjects and well repay inspection. The first en the list is Mr. DeMole's, ' Pichicing on the Yarra' by W. Ford, a very pleasirg repre sentation of a small, but joyous party, in a prettily-wooded spot near - the Metropolitan river, the season chosen being when spring is mellowing into summer, the green pastures axe acquiring a tinge of brown, and nature every where wears its brightest and loveliest aspect. His Excellency is the winner of ' An Autumn Morning, Mount Disappointment,' by J. W. Curtis. The scene is in the Plenty Ranges, and is at once wild and natural, the manner in which all the grand features of the view and the smaller details are worked out, showing the hands of an artist who has faithfully and with intelligence and t&Bte; reproduced what he has seen-and loved to gaze- upon. The coloring Is natural, the tall .straight. trees with the dead timber, standing and' fallen, the rank vegeta tion, and the views and glimpses of mountain and gorge, all combine to give a truthful im pression of one of the many enchanting spec tacles in Australia Felix. Mr. Worsnop has become the fortunate possessor of ' Tullarook Ranges, as seen from the Bsechwerth-road,' by H. J, Jobnstone, a very excellent paint ipg of a beautiful piece of scenery, f ami- i liar to many persons in this colony. Theu-^ comes the ' Bush Road, near Wallen Wallen,' by J. W. Curtis, presenting a hne piece of woodland country, with a narrow road winding through it. The pools of water and the glimpses of hills beyond add to the attractions of this picture, of which Mr. G. Stacy is the winner. Besides these prizes, there are a number of other paintings, of which we especially noticed *' Sunrise ' in the Dandenong Ranges as a pro duction of great merit. An incident that proves in an un mistakeable manner that debtors, absconding by sea, may not reckon with any degree of cer tainly upon having effected their escape while still in St. Vincent's Gulf, occurred on Wednes day, October 28, and as there was some pluck and considerable enterprise introduced into the affair, it is by no means without interest. It seems that on the morning of the day men tioned Mr. William King, timber merchant, noticed in the passenger list of the Hesperus the name of one who was indebted to him, and who was leaving the colony without paying what he owed, not from the want of ability to do so, but from want of wilL Mr. King's first impression was that tbe money must be included among his bad debts, and that being so thought little more about the matter, but during the morning he heard that the Hesperus was becalmed in the Gulf, which at once suggested the question — Might not, even now, the money be obtained from his dishonest debtor? and the thought was promptly followed by action. Soon tele grams from the coast informed Mr. King that the Hesperus might be overhauled if no time were lost. But- considerable time was lost in obtaining the necessary docu« ments with which to enforce a settlement of the account, in the event of that being pos sible, aud it was after 1 o'clock before Mr. King, accompanied by -a bailiff, left Adelaide by the train for Glenelg. On arrival there it was touna tnac tne Hesperus was iuiiy lo miles away. Not to be beaten, Mr. King, without v, delay, chartered the steamer Fairy, and soon an f* exciting chase began. The Fairy put off from, the jetty under sail ; but steam was : soon got up, and. the little craft went along through the smooth waters in fine style. At the outset the Hesperus had much the best of it, for a breeze sprung up, and having every stitch of -canvas set, she soon increased the distance between the vessels.' ^Eventually the wind dropped, and the Fairy having: by this time folly got rip steam, rapidly gained upon the noble «raft which she was pursuing, and by skilful handling was made to cut the- course of the Hesperus, so that in tacking, the latter came right: Up ^alongside the steamer. Captain Legoe, when within speak ing ''distance* toia^the occupants of tbe Fairy that no one would be allowed .to board his Bbrp,-and thaV any persons attempting to do so #ould'%9treatea as pirates, for, 'feid he' I am more than three miles from the land,' However, af tor remonstrances and. repeated assurances — which latter were found to be very necessary — that the warrant was not for the captain him self, but for one of his ^passengers, the abscond ing debtor was called forward and asked by the, captain, in no honeyed words, if he owed the money, why he had not ' paid it ? The debtor was. apparently so. astonished at a demand for ^payment - being .made on the high seas that - utterance almost failed him, but he managed to stammer out, in reply to the captain's question, that be forgot it, which Mr. King knew not to be trurj for he had taken good care to refresh hi» memory. The captain no longer opposing, his visitors were soon on boird his ship, and in the cabin the debt was quickly paid, together with ihe 'expenses incurred, including nearly the whole cost of chartering the Fairy. Without unnecessary delay the vessels again parted company, the passengers by the Hesperus, who ^ had viewed the chase with, considerable interest, arid no .doubt appreciation of the fun, availing themselves of ; the opportunity ' of sending letters to their rfriendV The, Fairy reached Glen^lg at haU-pai^lO ^clock, having been out o^eight ipaii p«gaged-4n «B«zama|;aod« ifcfi&ptoiy;, bwaw nuibMu^aBftrifcff 4k Council on Wednesday, -it -which five moisten] WCrepRMOllti .???- ' ?
