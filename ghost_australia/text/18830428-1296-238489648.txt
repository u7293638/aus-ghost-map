THE AMENDMENT IN FA VOUR on colonial industries. TO tnn EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY DAILY TELEGRAPH. Sir, — You will confer a groat favour on many colonists if you will permit me to say that you did an act of juelico to the hon, member for Northnm- berland, Mr N. Melville, in your leading article of the 26tu instant, when dealing with tbat gentleman's amendment on Air Sydney Smith a motion ; und you truly said that "tho amendment was not hostile." I happened to haYe been in tho House of Parliament on the evening that Mr S. Smith brought forward the motion, bnt never for one moment looked for its adoption ; and I am sure, from experience of mem bers in past Parliaments talking to empty benches whenever a motion in favour of oolonial industries waa brought forward, that no member of Parliament pre sent on Tuesday evening ever dreamed of the motion having a ghost of a chance of acceptance. As secre tary of the Protection and Politioal Reform League, I should have been staggered on reading the article in the Keening News, bo fairly condemned by you, if I had not been fortunate enough to have been present; in Parliament House when the discussion took place, I would only further Eay that tho amendment has pinned the Government to such a line of condnct when inviting future tenders as no former Govern ment in New South YY'ales has consented to abide by; and but for the timely move of Mr Melville, nothing- would have been gained on behalf of colonial industries during the nrcsent session of Parliament. — Yours, Ac., R. C. LUSCOMBE, Nithsdale-street, April 28.
