A Midnight Call. An American Army chaplain, the Bev. J. H. ni'Neilly, describes an amusing inci dent which occurred during the Civil War. At Fort Donelson there were only socme half a dozen companies fortifying and drilling. The new chaplain was meeessing with the seni r captain. "In those days, he says, ' the men had not yet given up all home habits. They wore white shirts and underclothes, and every night un dressed and went to bed like ordinary folk. One day it was rumored that the gunboats were in the river below us and were coming up. About midnight, while all were lesep ing soundly, the long roll of the drum bE gan to beat in the company stationed on the river bank. At once there was a stir in the camp; offioers were calling the men to fall in, and there was much hurrying to and fro. Captain Beaumont was always careful about his dress when on duty, and even now he did not neglect his toilet. Quickly he put on his uniform, buckled on his sword, and stepped out of his tent to take command of his company. But his men had not been so thoughtful. They sprang up and graeped their muskets, and formed in line in front of their tents; but every man of them had forgotten to put on his trousers, and there they stood in their night clothes, like 'sheeted ghosts,' trembling with cold and excitement. As the captain and I stepped out, and his eye glanced along the line, his sense of pro. priety got the better of his military ardour and he shouted out his first command, ' Con. found your foolish souls, go and put on your breechee I' The situation dawned on the men, and, with shouts of laughter, they prepared for war by putting on those needful articles of apparel. After all, it was a false alarm, and the men were soon rent to bed again."
