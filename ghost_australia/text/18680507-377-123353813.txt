A Gno FPnoa A SWEL. HIero's reverything going post-haste to the devil Noblesse, good society, manners, and mien! In the Aimy, the Navy, tile Service called " Civil" As it was in old times, but will ne'er be again. Office-doors opt not now to a Peeress's ticket, No oore by "connection" the best berths are filled, Civil Sorrice Commissionaors now keep tile wicket, And low fellows pass, when 'tlsoir bpters get " pilled." No matter tihe name that a fellow maoy boast of, Tlnous h in Burke's or Debrett's Librl d'Oro en shrined, A chance in thlo Service he hasn't a ghost of, If througl "Bihe thlree R.'s" hie can't manage to grind. If thley'd set Latin ecrses, or "tmo" and "rorro A public-school fellow might do well enough, - But they go for low subjects that Eton nin't up to -Geography, History, Freneb, and suchl stuf! And if one gets berthed, spite of examosination, In nt oflice, of eoot-o, where a fellow can go, One has no ptll at all in one's rank or one's station In fact thie lwhole styleis isnfernally low. One must sign books, keep hIours, and work till one tires, As thley do in tle Cuslome of Somerset House, And tie old fogies grudge one a burst in " the Slires," Or a run into Scotland, int time for the grouse. It's all lthis impertinent public opinion Thlis Press, for lwhichl nothing's too hIigh or too low- Penny trumpeta tlat claim democratic dominion O'er orse Guards and Treasury, Home and F.O.; E'en appointments of Elliotts they venture to ques tion, E'en a Royal Duke's blunders orjobs to exposo Snobs a fellow don't meet, or would worse than tihe peet shun, If he o'er met thlem anywhere any one goes.
