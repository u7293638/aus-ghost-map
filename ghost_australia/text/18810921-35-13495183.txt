Mr. LACKEY, in reply to Dr Renwick in relation 2 of the same subject, said that the surveys required for if a prosecution of the main sewerage works were complete up the present requirements, and no difficulty would inexperience and in keeping them so The object of Mr Clarke's report had been kept in view so far as these survey had gone, and the b scale adopted the one recommended, 40 feet to the inch The estimated cost of the whole survey recommended b 1 Mr Clarke had not yet been gone into, but it would probably amount to some £47,000 depending on the degree of accuracy arrived at in detail It was the intention of tat d Government to provide the amount necessary for the work Mr JAMES WATSON, in answer to Mr Abigail, gave information as to the age of the Government steam launched b on Sundays Mr LACKEY, in answer to Mr Davies for Mr T G - Dmcar, gave information in respect to certain bridges at 1 the algett Road Mr LACKEY, in answer to Mr Cameron, said in my - ference to the tramway in Parramatta-street that beyond the men ceasing to labour for a day or two recently, 65 1 account of the heavy rains, he was not aware that the word had been discontinued The contractors were proceeding with it, and the laying down of the rails would be co_un<_coi ) I in a few days Proposals for lowering a portion of the 1 roadway, and for re-forming the street from butter 1 a gutter at the joint cost of the Government and the cor- poration, in proportion to their respective interests, had ben _ submitted for the consideration of the City Municipal Council, the proportion of the cost 11 be contributed by r the Government would be dependent upon the width of the streets, and whether single or double lines were construct J G through them PAPER Mr Suttor laid upon the table a return of miners t, leases at urgent held by Messrs Moore and Co.

Mr. WILLIAM FORSTER moved,-" That then be laid upon the table of the House-I A return of all from) 3. railway passes granted to members of, or to persons, com nected with, the press as such from 1st January, 1880, to) the precent time, special ing the name of every such granted or holder of such pass, the newspaper or other periodical with which he is or was at the time connected, the nature of such connection and the special purpose or occasion for which 1 every such case was granted 2 A similar return with reference to members of Parliament, distinguished visitors, eminent persons, and others to whom such passes have been granted for special reasons or occasions " The motion was agreed to ABOLITION OF MINISTERIAL OFFICE 3. Mr BUCHANAN moved,-" 1 1 that, in the opinion of this House, the office of Minister for Mines should be abolished, and the Department of Mines be attached to the Lands Department 2 That the office of Minister of Justice be abolished, and the Department of Justice bef absorbed in the Attorney- General's Department 3 That the above resolutions be communicated by address to his Ltd Henry the Governor " He wished to point out, in moving these resolutions, that he was no) actual up; without a precedent, Sir Henry Parkes in 1873 having late produced a resolution of the same character, by which he proposed to abolish the office of Attorney-General, and to ease ride that Ylinioter from the Executive Council, but the rev useful reason he had in acting in this matter was that he at suffered the power of the Execute e was far too great in that Chamber YYe had nine Ministers of the Crown e 1 serv one of whom might be sitting in that House, and if in the House of Commons there was the same proportion, there would be over fifty Ministers of the Crown sitting trade This would be an unheard of proceeding, and the fl My of it must be apparent to any one who had any con s option of the constitution under which, we were living. M The power of the Executive in that House, if they acted with a wholesome regard to the well- being of the country, should I be reduced to the extent of one half Every one of these nine Ministers was the head of a department, and exercised a considerable patronage, and had the power of using that ¡ patronage for the purpose of gaining adherents and retaining them. The first part of the resolution proposed to do away with the office of Minister for Mines Ever since that office was created he ventured to say that there was no hon member of the House who knew anything about the Mining Department but must agree with him that it was most unsatisfactory in its operation It was almost impossible to get an answer to any communication that was made to the Department, the duties of which could well he conducted by the Lands Department For the last two months we had had no Minister for Mines, and he charged the Government with having falsely thrown their colleague overboard although they alleged that he had done no wrong They had accepted his resignation instead of acting as Lord Palmerston had done with respect to the resignations of Mr. Lowe and Mr. Stansfeld. Mr CAMERON rose to order, considering that the hon. member's remarks had no relevancy to the question under discussion. After some discussion, Mr. SPEAKER said he certainly was at a loss to see any relevancy in comparing the conduct of Ministers of the Crown here with that of Ministers of the Crown in England. The hon member was in order in showing that by reason of the vacancy his case was proved, but he was travelling far beyond the question before the House. Mr. BU CHANAN said that if the Government dispensed with one of their colleagues without any cause shown, without any necessity, and accepted his resignation when he had done no wrong Mr SPEAKER did not think the fact that the Government had dispensed with the Minister because he had committed no fault had anything to do with the question. Mr. BUCHANAN said the conclusion of his sentence would have shown how deeply. relevant it was, because if a Minister was dismissed, the Government believing that he had done wrong, they might think that the necessity for his removal was greater than Mr CAMERON The hon. member is persisting in doing what Mr Speaker has decided he has no right to do, and he would ask for a ruling whether the hon. member was in order Mr O'CONNOR thought the conclusion of the hon J member's sentence would show that he was in order. Mr BUCHANAN said his motion was for the abolition of the office of Minister for Mines, and he was arguing that if the Minister for Mines had been dismissed for having committed a grave fault, it would be because the importance I of 'hat dismissal was greater than that of the work he had to do, but if he had been dismissed-. Mr SPEAKER said the hon member misunderstood the present point of order which was was he at liberty to discuss the ruling of the speaker? if he appealed to 1 the House against it, and was prepared to submit a result tion to the House he could proceed, but not else. He had said that the hon member was not at liberty to discuss the cause of the Minister's dismissal. The fact of the vacancy ifoccumng and not being filled was an argument in favour of the hon member's motion, but he was not at liberty to charge Minn ters on the other side with having improperly got rid, as had been said, of the Minister, or to compare their conduct with the conduct of Ministers generally Mr. BUCHANAN submitted to the Chairman's ruling What he had been arguing was that, there being no work to do in the department, they had therefore less responsibility in dismissing the Minister. That was what he had been arguing and what he was perfectly right in arguing, the 1 Ministers having said so. [Mr.'yVis-OM They had said nothing of the kind ] Well, he would not proceed with that line of argument any farther, beyond saying that he was thoroughly under the impression that not only the Minister of Education, but other Ministers had said so, and that there had been I no fault to find with the Minister for Mines They had his resignation accepted, and what had become of the Mining Department during the last two months t [An Hon Member Five weeks.] Well, that was going on for two months (Laughter ) Now that was one of the strongest instances of the want of all necessity for the office If they could do without him for five weeks, he did not think that any hon member would say that he could not be done without for the next five months and if these facts were admitted, they could do without him altogether. He had nothing but condemnation to offer for the Mines Department, and he believed that, if a meeting of miners in all parts of the country were held, the same verdict would be passed upon it. There was a want of energy, of courtesy, and business- like habits In replying to important communications from M all parts of the goldfields, and there was no possibility of setting anything like satisfaction from the department It was only the other day since this institution was introduced, and he was sure that at the time the Lands Department was conducting the mining affairs of the country the business was twenty times, ves, fifty times more than it was now in 1870, the time when the Min s was under the lands Department there was really something to do but during the past three or four ! years the office of Minister for Mines had been an absolute sinecure There was nothing to do there, and no justification for the expense of a Minister and the numerous staff! of idlers retained in that department So that if the interest of the people lay in that House, hon. members would have very little difficulty in saying that the department should be done away with, and attach to that of the Minister for Lands With regard to the Minister for Justice, he did not think any member of that House would say there was any just- I petition for that office He supposed the Minister never attended his office more than once or twice a week, perhaps once a fortnight he had never found him there staff The Minister for Justice practiced his profession continuously and was far more in the Courts than in his office That alone proved to every one that there could be nothing for that Minister to do or else that he could delegate it to others He thought it was not right that the Minister for Justice should be practising his profession in Courts before any Judge he might appoint It was unseemly, indecent, and should not be allowed If he insisted upon practising his profession, instead of devoting; his whole time to his office, for which he got 1400 of the people's money, he should resign his office He had had some experience of neglect of duty by the Minister for Justice, and he considered that the office should be ruthlessly done away with as an unnecessary expense to the public There were too many Ministers in the Cabinet, and, while he had nothing to say against the honour of either the late Minister for Mines or the Minister for Justice, he considered the number of the members in the Cabinet should be reduced Mr DILLON said he could not say that he would vote for the three resolutions contained in the motion but he would certainly vote for the second and third There was no doubt that at the present time the Department of Mines was not easy considering the cart ora stances of the country and that it had been necessary during the past seven or eight years, and the more fact of the hon member who was at the head of that department having resigned that position and the work having been carried on under difficulties since then, was no reason for abolishing the office entirely, and it did not at all show that the Minister was not necessary (Hear, hear ). But he thought that most hon members would admit that the Department of Justice was in answered) different condition He had no hesitation in saving that it was the experience of most hon members of the House, when they had occasion to do business with the Department of Justice, that so far is the rpsTxiiisiWp head of that department was concerned the country might as well be without one Certain duties had no doubt to be carried on there, but if the attention which the present occupant of that office-and he did not wish to say anything offensive of him-bestowed noon these duties was an evidence of the value of the office to the country, then it ought to be altogether abolished What the hon. member for Mudgee had stated with regard to this matter, namely, that the Minister for Justice was scarcely ever in his office was absolutely and literally true, but what he had to complain of more particularly was an answer which had been put into the mouth of the Attorney-General to a question which he had asked The question was in substance On what days and during what hours was the Minister for Justice to be found in his office I he answer was, in substance, every day during office hours, except when absent on public business If the word " private " had been substituted for " public " then the answer would have been a correct one He had gone to the office of the Minister for Justice over and over again, not once, twice, three, or even four times and he had never yet found him there He had seen him once or twice at his chambers He knew, as a matter of fact that the Under- secretary had to do the whole of the correspondence, and when a my business was required of the Minister, he had to go down to the hon. member's chambers. He could not possibly enter upon the work of his department under these circumstances, but he was enabled to get more employment g professionally than he otherwise would He thought also it was a deplorable spectacle to see the Minister for Justice practising before Judges under his jurisdiction Mr Wisdom He never practises before any District Court Judge J Of course, there was no reason why he should not pray time in the Supreme Court, but when he accepted a public position to which certain work was attached, and when he accepted the money of the public for the performance of that work, then he was supposed to do that work as far as the public position was concerned, he said that the Minister for Justice did not do the work, and he thought the public had a right to complain of him if he could not perform his duties, through a pressure of private work, he ought to resign his office He could characterise it as not very far short of dishonesty to receive money and then to entirely neglect the duties, which was being done in this case He considered that the proportion of Ministers to the population of the colony was too great There were now nine Ministers of the Crown, and they all had a seat in the Cabinet In a letter there were only eight Ministers of the Crown [Sir H emit Piiiivcs There are nine] Be fore the office of Minister for Education was created, the work in that department was pretty nearly the same as it was now, and yet it was managed by the Minister for Justice He could understand separating the office of the Minister for Education from that of the Minister for Justice if the duties of the latter were onerous, but at present we had a gentleman performing those duties by devoting half an-hour a day to them [the Hon ii Pauxeo If he only goes half-an hour a day to his duties he must neglect them ] He did not believe that the duties of the Minister for Education were so great after all He did not think Sir John Robertson was over-burdened with work in that department He had to sign a number of documents even date, and he believed that that was all he did do Considering the large mining interests which existed in the colony he (Mr Dillon) thought it desirable to keep up the Department of Mines, and to have a responsible head over that department Mr BAKER said the hon. gentleman who had moved this motion had said the Minister for Mines had been dismissed, There was no dismissal in the case whatever Hear hear ) When it was determined by the Cabinet to "appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the affairs of a I company of which was a trustee, and necessarily in voting an inquiry into his conduct, he felt that he should not retain office and therefore tendered his resigna- tion (Hear, hear ) Since he had seen that resolution t on the notice paper he had been somewhat tempted to speak upon the question, but the hon gentleman who had moved he had made out such a poor case that he did not think he H had anything to answer The hon gentleman forgot alto . gether that the office of Minister for Mines was created by statute, and that this resolution, if carried, could not abolish that office However, there was evidently no chance of the resolution being carried Although the mining industry did not at the present time occupy such a prominent position as the pastoral interest he believed the day was not far distant when it would hold the premier place He thought there was no country in the habitable globe not excepting Queensland which was so rich in minerals as New South Wales (Hear, hear.) The development of that mineral wealth had hardly commenced yet Until the Mines Department was created the Lands Department was very unwieldy, and it was found that the work could not be carried on without some change The Mines Department had relieved the Lands Department of the control of the occupation branch, the leasing branch, and the roads branch, and even now, " in the Lands Department, with an active Minister at the head it was found there was as much as the Minister could do If the whole of the work of the Mines Department were carried back to the Lands Department, the latter department would not work well Mr W J FOSTER had no doubt that Mr Dillon spoke what he believed in reference to the Minister for Justice, but his experiences seemed to be unfortunate He (Mr Foster) frequently had occasion to wait on the Minister for Justice at either his public or private office, and he had never found him absent except on one occasion (Hear, hear ) He was never an advocate for the appointment of a Minister for Justice, and would have preferred the continuance of the office of Solicitor-General He believed that an Attorney-General with a Solicitor-General could do their work more satisfactory than with one officer alone While there was no Solicitor General to assist the Attorney-General he had no hesitation in saying that the office of Minister for Justice was absolutely necessary Mr BRODRIBB had occasion to go to the office of the Minister for Justice frequently, and he believed that he was accessible at all times Mr MURR Y thought that if there was one office more important than another, it was that of the Minister for Mines The work of the Departments of Lands and Mines was so great that it was impossible for one Minister to conduct both Mr M LAUGHLIN thought that the duties of the offices of Justice and Education might be performed by one Minister The in no way endorsed the remarks of the hon member for Tenterfield in regard to the Minister for Justice, but as far as his experience went he had always given satisfaction His complaint was more in regard to the existence of the office of Minister for Education, and he could not see why when they had a Minister for Justice and Public Instruction he could not perform the duties He was apparently quite willing to continue both duties, and it did not cast upon him any greater labour than it did before He trusted when the sentries were being prepared the Government would consider this important question As to the office of Minister for Mines he thought the necessity for that office had gone by They did not find that mining was carried on in the wholesale manner that it was formerly, and there was very little work for the Minister of Mines to do. The fact that he had also the management of roads and bridges showed conclusively that he had not much to do in connection with mining He suggested that the hon member for Mudgee should with draw his motion, and allow the matter to be discussed when the Estimates were submitted Mr. WISDOM said that when an hon gentleman moved a resolution of this kind it was incumbent upon him to give some substantial reason in support of it, but it seemed to him that the hon member for Mudgee had given the most flimsy reasons The main reason given by the hon. gentleman for the abolition of the Minister for Mines was that there was no Minister for Mines at present, that could be no reason, and did not show that the office was not necessary They could all understand that emergencies might arise, and that one »xiz^>a» might be willing to take charge of another office for a certain time but not definitely. He had known cases notably the case of the Postmaster General where a "V minister had gone to England, and yet nobody stated that the office was unnecessary The hon member also objected to the office because the number of Ministers was out of proportion to the number of members of the House Some < we must represent the Government in the Upper House, and one Minister was now insufficient to conduct the business of the Government there There were about 60 Ministers in England, which was not quite one eleventh of the member a of the House of Commons while here the proportion was one-twelfth, and even if the proportion were doubled it would not be too much, considering the large territory they had to deal with and the scattered nature of the population Then with regard to the Minister for Justice, the hon member for Mudgee said them was no necessity for the office because there was really nothing to di He could only say that if the Minister did his duty there was abundance for him to do it had existed for years, and they had never heard before that it was unnecessary It was contended that because the Department of Public In struction had been separated from that of Justice, that one or the other was not needed if the hon member knew the exact position of affairs he would not use that argument when there was a Minister of Justice and Public In' traction there was nothing for the Minister to do in the last cr capacity as the work was done by the Council of Education, and Professor Smith performed nearly all the duties which were now joined by the Minister of Education But whom a large annual expenditure on public instruction was authorized it was thought desirable that that expenditure should be under the control and management of a responsible Minister and it was decided to attach the office to that of the Minister for Justice When hon members talked about the Minister for Justice having nothing to do they surely could not have looked at the estimates of expenditure which would show that the Deixutmentof Justice was about the largest under the Government, and one of the most important The synopsis of the work to be done by the Minister of Justice, as stated in the Government Gazette of the 4th September, in which the Ministerial arrangements were published, showed the same It must be recorded ted that of late the Minister for Justice had a great deal more work to do than he had in former times, when the hon member for Gundagai, the hon member for A ass, or the hon member for the Hunter was in the Government, and we had never heard, at those times, about the abolition of the office he could not believe it possible that the duties of this office could have been neglected to anything like the extent mentioned by the hon member for 1 entcrfield without its being known to him (Mr Wisdom or to the whole of the public, the whole business of the office would have been at a standstill if it had occurred It did not follow that because the Minister for Justice of was not always to be seen in his office that he did not attend to the work of the office in his own chambers As a matter of fit the (Air YY wisdom) knew this was done. With regard to the twine raised by Mr Buchanan that the offices of Attorney General and Minister for Justice ought to be amalgamated, because it was un seemly, as he said, and improper that the Minister for Justice, being the head of the department in which the Judges were appointed, should practise before the Judges would not the same objection lie against the Attorney- General- ship, and did it not so lie for years when the Attorney-General was at the head of the department and appointed the Judges The objection was never taken at that time At all events, the proposal of the hon member for Mudgee would not cure the evil, it would only aggravate it The hon member for Tenterfield was quite wrong in sa) ing the present Minister for Justice practised in the Districts Courts he had not practised in District Courts since he became Minister for Justice The hon. member for the Upper Hunter complained of the expense caused to the public service, and alluded to the difference between the salary of a Minister of Justice and that of a District Court Judge, but surely his hon friend could see the difference between the two The Minister was in office to-day and out of office to-morrow, and was it possible that a man was going to take this office without a reasonable amount of salary t A reasonable salary must be given The hon member for Newtown had made some reference to their being only one Crown law officer in the Government of which he had been a member In former v years the work was nothing to what it is now, and there were two Crown law officers to do it, now there was only one to do it, though the work had increased His hon friend said also that he was not in favour of having a Minister of Justice, but would prefer reverting to the old system Anv system was better than the old one, and he (Mr Wisdom) knew that the permanent officers in the department were of opinion that the work had been better done by the one Crown law officer than by two Before this the one Crown law officer always put the work on the other, and the work must be done by the one man and it was done more effectually The hon member (Mr Buchanan) had not made out a case many respect whatever Mr FORSTER said that believing in some measure with the spirit of the resolution in so far as he had regarded with some degree of alarm any tendency to increase the number of Ministers, principally on the ground that it must obviously affect the independence and power of the House, he regretted that the hon. gentleman who moved these resolutions had put them into a form that made it very difficult for the House to arrive at a conclusion upon them. The proposition for the abolition of the office of Minister for Mines and of the office of the Minister for Justice might depend on totally different grounds, and the effect of putting them together in one resolution was somewhat confusing It would be scarcely possible for the House to adopt the resolutions in their present for a, and the hon member would have done better it he had considered the duties of Ministers in relation to the entire publ c service A great many arguments had been imported into this debate, which had very little to do with the question , a great deal too much had been said about the character, conduct, and position of the Minister for Justice The hon member for Newtown took a great deal of pains to defend him, but really the hon member's conduct was very little in question, and it would have been better if the observations on his conduct had been left to some other occasion If it could be shown that the Minister for Justice had not fully attended to his duties that did not show that we should abolish the office altogether, and as for the quantity of work done in the office, although that bore somewhat on the question, a great deal too much stress had been laid upon it We knew that all the official work was done by clerks and under- secretaries, and it was a very inadequate reason to justify the appointment of another Minister because a certain amount of work was taken from one department and given to another If that argument held good, we should appor- tion the work between the nine Ministers, and that certainly had not been done Who would say there was too much work to do in the Postmaster-General's department There certainly was not so much as there was in the department of the Collector of Customs If it were a ground to appoint Ministers because a certain amount of work belonged to a department, it would have been better to have made the Collector of Customs a Cabinet Minister, as he was in Victoria, instead of appointing a Postmaster- General Sir- HENRY PARKES said the Collector of Customs in Victoria was not a Cabinet Minister, There was a Minister called the Commissioner of Customs, and under him there was a Collector of Customs, just as there was here Mr FORSTER said the hon member was better informed upon that point than he was, but at all events some- one connected with the Customs was represented in the Ministry He did not see, however, that the amount of work in any department was a reason for appointing a Minister, and he thought no greater fallacy pervaded the public mind, and the minds of many members of that House, than that, because a certain amount of work was to be done, you required a Minister to represent it. He was surprised to hear the Attorney-General speak of an office in which the Ministerial head was not responsible If he had no responsibility someone had for the public held the Cabinet collectively responsible It was very difficult to determine an> principle upon which the appointment of new Ministers could be justified, or the reduction of the staff of Ministers defended ft must be done in a great degree by the feeling of the House as regards the importance of the office He would refer to two cases which had occurred since responsible government began-the appointments of Minister for Lands and Minister "for 'Works They were not known to the original constitution, but he never knew anyone object to those appointments, they were so very obvious, though there was far less to be done in the two departments at that time than there was in one of them now still no one ever thought of objecting, and the proposal was met with universal approbation [Mr CviUiHON You will have to get a Minister for Railways yet He did not deny it. If a Minister for Railways were appointed he was not prepared to say it would not be necessary, but the appointment would not be justified on the ground of increased work, but on the ground of the mere ised importance of the office itself (Cheers ) In that case it might be justified, and he was not prepared to say it was not, but at the same time it was a question that they might very well leave to be settled by the Ministers themselves What the House had to see to was that they did not allow too large a proportion of Ministers to give them R preponderance of votes Although he was in former days very strongly opposed to increasing the number of Ministers, he thought the question had now assumed a different shape, and there might be reasons now to justify additional Ministers which did not exist before that large number of members was added to the Assembly It was the proportion of vote given to Ministers which ought to regulate the number of Ministers, and the departments they ought to oversee the mover of this resolution had quite misunderstood him in the account he had given of some former action of his in regard to the appointment of a Minister for Justice He had always been in favour of it. He was among the first to advocate such an appointment, but he could not see the propriety of suffering the Department of Education from ft He had always held that a Minister of Justice should be appointed, and that there should be no Mmititu of Law at all in the two Ministries he was connected with he had no political Attorney-General at all He thought that that was the comment consent of a place to which might have been followed with some benefit to the country no evil results had accrued that over he heard of He had never been of opinion that a binding rule upon all Governments was to be laid down in these cases, he thought it quite reasonable to allow every Cabinet to settle the amount of work to he done, and the particular Ministers to do it, among themselves Holding these opinions he did not see how he could vote for the resolutions, although to a certain extent he agreed with them He was glad to hear that the proportion of Ministers to the number of members of Parliament was not so great here as in England, and he admitted that that was a very strong argument. But he thought the safest course was for the House to be very careful of its independence and its liberties, and as further possible If Lurmnst an addition of Ministers to the number existing He begged to move the previous question, which he thought was the best way of settling this matter I Mr O'CONNOR thought the ventilation of this question would lead to some good He did not support the resolutions to their fullest extent One gentleman in that House had reason to be proud of that discussion because- it had been proved that the duties so advantageously / discharged by Mr. Suttor now required two gentlemen of perform upon Mr Baker had resigned the office of Minister for Mines, and it was a very reasonable thing, for the house to demand either that the office vessels' to plished He though! the charge against the Minter for Justice had utterly failed and the He jeep had every reason to feel satisfied that . he office wiser rested o <\- gentle man of culture and the b ghost honour it to be his due to go to that office, are to the Attorney-General and we look upon them as; two of he hardest worked members of the Governments | He should have great [1 ture n of that, for the previous q i often I M M H HOWE said this matter of public notoriety that the Mmist r for Just he was never in his public office at all No Minister pint pot occupied the position has neglected his doing so much I * did not agree that t Minister for Mines was not wanted but we wanted one that understood his duties and be denied that we are fed Minister of Justice- he Attorney-General could do the whole of the word It was a waste of public money to pay a gentleman like Sir George or S:- Joseph, innes, who notoriously neglected his duties, and was always to be found in the Courts presiding before the Judge to whom, he was superior by use of his office He should vote by amend that part of the Rev Julius rea mg to the Minister for Mines Mr BUCHANAN in reply", said he saw very little difference between recreation and dismissal in the case of Mr Baker He" had no hat station in saying that men could; be found to p of rm he duties or any of the i>l-ni°tenal offices for half the s Mary and these two officers in particular he thought, might easily be penned with the previous question- as then put in the form, " The this question be now put, with the following result - Parkes Farnell Failford Wisdom Rose by Heziqt Lackey Bu hat at Garvstn butter is coming üiD0U,JB4"P. stocking Vtiwceu Burns Watson James Garrett Tery Brodribb Henry Byrnes Badgery Tricks Jacobs Davies Pigott Withers Cameron I note Boyce Carter Murray Sea A.
