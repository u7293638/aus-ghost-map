CRICKET. How I Became a Cricketer. BR LONGSTOP. ? The first serious business of my. life was the introduction to a college don- my tutor. He was by no means prepossessing in appearance, decidedly not handsome, and having just come in from lecture might not have been in the best of humours. I am bound to Bay, however, that he improved considerably on acquaintance, and before I had known him long I came to the conclusion that his ugly, sallow, cadaverous face was not the index of his heart. The Bev. Mr. C., Fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Cantab; my verdict is entirely in your favour-you were a model tutor, a brick. I remember how, with a grave and serious aspect, he impressed on my youth ful mind the importance of regularly attending chapel and dining in hall-that lectures com menced at nine and finished at one, after which I was supposed to take luncheon, and then " a constitutional," which means a jolly long walk, from two to four. Then, I suppose, after hal], at four, some rational conversation over a glass of wine until ohapel time, after which preparing for the morning's lecture would while away the hours until ten, when he presumed, like a good Christian, I should say my prayers and " retire." I was a late bud; that is, I did not go up UDtil November, the consequence of which de lay was that I matriculated, with about half a dozen others, in my tutor's rooms. After giving us our papers-I suppose he trusted to our honour-1-he retired, and left us to get through them as we could, which, by & little of the give and take process, we managed remarkably well, all passing Al. I know that I helped one unfortunate youth over the ass's bridge," in return for which he polished off a quadratic -" things I could never abear"-for me in no time. This system of mutual accommodation was pretty extensively carried out among UB, and, as no questions were asked, all went well, and we matriculated to the satisfaction of the Rev. Mr. C. My first hall, my first chapel, can I ever forget them ? Thp former was a kind of bear gaiden, and reminded me of the animals being led at the Regent's Park. My "first chapel" was on a saint's day, and when I put on my white surplice and glided up the centre of the chapel, I fancied myself my own ghost. Six hundred men all in white surplices! Then, for the first time, I saw the Master of Trinity, that mighty mind, Whewell j but I am ashamed to coulees he had a nickname, for we irreverently called him " Billy Whistle j" why, I never knew. His fine' massive brow-you could read intellect in every feature of his coun tenance. ,, "Halloa," old boy; "where do you keep ?

It wojdd be cold ifMjrk, however, to play'criciet in November in England. But I had not been in residence forty- eight hours ere I found my way to Parker's Piece-as fine a piece of natural turf as could be wished, and Bituated within five minutes' walk of the centre of the town. But it was then silent and' deserted, although surrounded by Rouses oh three sides and with pathways running across itin all directions. A few.sheep here and there, a stray goose or two, and now and then a human heiog taking a short cut. But my friend, a second-year man, explained to me aU about' it. Wait," said Jie, " wait"until spring, until March and the May term, and then you will,see some cricket. Tents belonging to the different colleges, each of which lias its ground ;set apart, wickets pitched by th6 scorp/ ' inen bowling and batting, and balls flying in all directions, until it is positively hazardous to walk across it." .Such would Parker'aPiece be in May. But I must wait forMay tocome, Now, at the very time I then stood gazing 'on Parker's Piece there were in residence, fresh> men like myself, some who have since became most famous as amateur players,. but we were unknown to each other. I weil remember, afterwards, the supercilious air with which a third- year man once asked, in our first May term, "Who vfras King?" My friend, my assistant in vanquishing Tom Tidd! Fancy asking who he was, and if he could play cricket! He was then at Emmanuel, a freshman like myself known but to "few. Let me explain why we were thus unknown. Neither of us, though educated at public schools, were from either of that famed trio Eton, Harrow, or Winchester. There is a sort of cliquism among those who have been educated at those Tenowned schools which is carried to the University, and "the sets" of schoolboy days are, in many instances, re formed at college. I found myself then, com paratively a Btranger, and realised to some extent the force of those beautiful lines, of Byron, in which he de£cribea that solitude which is felt most oppressive- ' " 'Midst the crowd, the hum, the shook of men, To roam along, the world's tired denizen." However, it did not quite break my heart. It was too tough and elastic as . yet for such a catastrophe, and J was not exactly the world's tired-denizen." I consoled myself by cutting lectures, and hall, and chapel also four of the latter a week, instead pf eovpn, being enough for me. This brought, about to interview with the Dean, and a reprimand; also a hint that if I had occasion to repeat my visit three times. I should be handed over to the vice-master, from whom there was but one step to the "terrible Billy Whistle" He is dead now, and although I repeat the nickname by which we used'to call him, I>iD»I the less revere and respect his iQemorv: as master of Trinity, and as one of the,. Tnigh^;^ intellects of the age. I belieye ,J got f 09 far as the vice-I forget his n$pe JH>m -Professor Sedge wick I think, but j escaped "Terrible Billy-" In feet, I nejeer spoke to him but once, which wasonmy re turn one day from hunting, when I rofefull tilt upon him at a bend, of the, road, a eh^rfc distance from Cambridge, and he abruptly asked me if I was. a m?mberrof the XTniversity; Of course I said yes, when he veiy «urtly in formed me my costume was not academical. This fact I was well aware of, assI never had then seen any one either in hall or 1 college dressed in a pink coat, with buckskins. and boots, although J. once, subsequently .at noble earl similarly attired at early, morning chapel and sitting not two yartls from JWly. but his hunting toggery was clererly conn^l^l by the fujl Bilk gown with Dag. aleetretf which noblemen ! w««r on ordinary' dcca&ions.; I often wondered what BMy' wotdaJ havii Said if, he had scented the red rag.

Oh! Tommy Tidd, you're much to answer for, for had I never pome across you, jperhaps I, too, should hare had the wisdom to play cricket less and read more, like the young gentleman who used to set us such a good exaihple when we met him on our way home flom " hunting." But then I should not be telating " How I became a cricketer," or how on a one day, a fine mild morning in Feb ruaxy, I strolled up to " the piece," and en gaged that unmitigated scamp, Charley Arnold, to bowl to me at three and sixpence an hour, and two shillings for a backstop, he to take the money when Td done playing, and he would settle with "the cad* for being behind, by which ample arrangement, I pre sume, master Charley sacked nearly the whole Eroceeds of my first two hours' play. But he oew I was a freshman, and of course " he made hay while the sun shone." If I had believed all he told me, I was the best bat in the University, but as no one else was playing besides myself, I liad no opportunity of form ing an opinion; and as I caught him winking to "the cad" when he told me so, I began to regard him from that time with suspicion. And I found him out veiy soon. (Zb be continued.)
