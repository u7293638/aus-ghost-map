up their shutters in order to discuss the doctrine of the 1 unity at Jessie, and our columns frequently) bear witness to the eagerness with which many) persons now desire to penetrate the mysteries of predestination and the origin of evil Undoubtedly there are dogmas of the church -generally those of the duke and least intelligible soil which are the can e of grave doubt and perplexity) and are

Egyptian dall ness of his own unproved guesses At the same time it is necessary to bring the conclusions science and the teachings of theology) into contact in order to decide between them that is the point raised by our Corespondents who have recently written on the old question of man's best disobedience -for an answer to which some of them involve not the heavenly case of MILTON but DARWINS anthropoid ape The argument began with " Stru 1 tator advancing the hypothesis of evolution to explain the doctrine of original sin, which had been severely criticised by) Mr SOTIIFIILAVD He was followed by two or three writers in the same strain But a "Despondent. of Balaam s Ass, nettled at having the animal creation saddled with many evil propensities, uplifted his vice in protest against

' Sciutitor therefore, though he hardly saw the real daft of it, put a thorough!) justifiable question Will evolution ac- count for the undoubted fact of human depravity) in a more satisfactory way than theology has done l If it does, the theory is strengthened by its apply tation to a now set of facts, if not, it must' be rejected The statement that it is not universally) believed is beside the point, for the simple reason that it requires to be tested as a possible cause, which may account for the darkest, most painful, and most disastrous condition under which the human race exists Applied in this way to history, it has yielded some sinking results, and there can be no 10 ison against trying it in the domain of theology) It on this point of view, the teach- ing of evolution, so far as the church is concerned, must be left to the direc tion of those who occupy the pulpit to insist upon the doctrine would be unwise to prohibit it equally so, since it is not necessarily opposed to Chas transit) There is at least one preacher of the Church of England who not only believes in the Darwinian theory, but draws from it his proofs of the fundamental dogmas of the faith After all, evolution is only a very partial answer to the problems that are raised in the sphere of religion and morals We must point out to our correspondents that they have not explained every thing by reiterating that magic word the animal instincts are not depraved and it is only in man that they assume this character Not until we come to the human consciousness, do we find any traces of depravity) HIP question of the origin of evil is bound up with that of the origin of man, not as in animal, but as a third inc., willing, moral responsible being And this is just as little at counted
