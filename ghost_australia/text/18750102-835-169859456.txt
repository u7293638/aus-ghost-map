. :'OUR HOPE.' ? [Mackay, November 20.— Captain O'Dwyer; of the Morning light, reports finding, yester day, seven miles south of Cape Palmerston, »' boat of about six tons, evidently built from materials of a large ship. The words 'Oar Hope ' were painted on bows and stern, and carpenters tools, provisions, and patent log were found in her. The boat is not mocfl damaged, and is canvassed over and partly coppered. Ko traces, o{ names of the crew or human remains were found, and the boat appears to have only been beached a short V tune.— Courier telegram, November 21.] ^. ?A -wisd-borse shred of that myiterous scroll Wherein the secrets of the deep are writ : An echo of the warfare of the tool : ' A stranded hope ; 'Our Hope'— so runneth ' So runneth it ; a tale of manful aim.
