THE LITTLE NUGGET. A SKETCH. (BY H. CONGREVE EVANS.) Characters. George Gordon (A miner). Tom Manning (His mate).: Alice Gordon (George's wife). Elsie Gordon (His daughter). Scene—Gordon's hut on the Gley burn goldfields. Doors at backhand R. Gordon seated near fireplace. George. * Christmas Eve, eh? Ugh. Why should folks make merry ? What cause have I for rejoicing ? Each Christmas Eve is much like another, and each only serves to remind me of that one seven teen years ago. (Musing.) Seventeen years ago. It's a long time. I little thought once that I should live so long. Nor should I have done so, or cared to do so, but for my Elsie, my Little Nugget. (Thunder followed by rain.) Phew ! What a night. And Christmas too. More like a reminder of the darker regions than of heaven, one would think. [Enter Tom.] Ha! Tom, you've kept your promise. Tom. Yes, Mr. Gordon, it would take more than a thunderstorm to keep me away. George. When Elsie's the loadstcfcie, eh, Tom? What shall I do when you've taken her away from me ? Tom. We are not going to separate, Mr. Gordon. You and Elsie and I will live altogether, and now that the old mine is turning out so well we shan't have any more trouble. We shall be .rich, as rich as we can desire. George. Rich? Of what use is that when one is tired of the world ? Tom. Oh come, come, you are low-spirited. George. Perhaps so, Tom. But how strange it is4hat riches seem to pursue us when we would have none of them. Years ago I dreamed of making money. | That was my ambition. To-day I'd j not change places with the wealthiest man in Australia. But I must be going to the township. I am expect ing a letter. Tom. Is it so important ? George. Yes3 it is a letter that only comes once a year, and (laughing bitterly) its contents are not always pleasant. (Again laughing somewhat drearily) It tells me that the writer is alive. Tom. Naturally. How the wind blows! Can't you leave this letter until the morning? George. No, Tom 3 it's a matter of duty. I must go. Ah, me. I'm afraid I'm rather a dreary companion. I'm getting old, Tom, and Christmas has come to remind me of the fact Tom. Nonsense. Why, man, you are in the prime of life. George. (Bitterly) The prime of life. Well, yes, I suppose I look strong enough }o last another twenty years, but I am like that gum-tree out yonder, the one that was shivered by the lightning last winter. It bid fair to last for ages. Look at it now. Tom. Come, Gordon, this weather is making you despondent. s I am sure you have everything to make life happy—riches in prospective and (softly) Elsie. George. (Energetically) But for my Little Nugget I believe I should have ended my life years ago. It is she who has reconciled me in a measure to existence. When she was away from me at school I sat and moped at nights, listening to the wailing of the curlews out on the swamps, and imagining a hundred dreads that had overtaken my girl, and then when her holidays came and I held her in my arms and pressed my rough lips to her soft cheeks I vowed that I'd never part with her again. She is a part of my life. She belongs to me. (Fiercely) And woe betide whoever attempts to part us. (Calmly) Excuse me, Tom. I wasn't thinking of you. You are one of us. Elsie loves you, and whoever Elsie loves I love too. [Enter Elsie.] Elsie. (Crossing to her father and kissing him) Daddy, daddy, how often have I told you that you mustn't talk about me so much. Anyone would think that there was no one else in the world. Good evening, Tom. George. There is no one else in the world for me. Tom. Nor for me. Elsie. Oh, dear me; you will make me quite vain. Did you talk to my mother like that, daddy ? George. (Painfully) I don't know, pet. It was so long ago. We wont talk about the past. I have you, and only you. Elsie. (Archly) And Tom. George. Oh, yes, Tom of course; but then he rather belongs to you, I think. He is to be your husband. I am your father. Elsie. . And a dear, darling old father, who makes too much of his silly little girl. Tom, I hardly thought you would come. What a dreadful night. Tom. I couldn't stay away, Elsie, when you had asked me. 'Tis the only gleam of sunshine in my life to come here. George. Bravo, Tom. And the gleam of sun shine is my Little Nugget. Elsie. Daddy, anyone would think you were a fine gentleman paying court tQ an equally fine lady. George. And so I am. At least you are the finest lady I ever wish to see. Isn't she, Tom ? Tom. She's the bonniest flower that blooms in Gleyburn. Elsie. (Putting her hands to her ears) Stop, stop, stop. You are getting too com plimentary. I must retire to my room while I have sufficient strength of mind or you will tempt me from my work to listen to the pretty speeches of a dear old, foolish daddy and a silly billy, good-natured, darling Tom. [Exit.] George. There goes the best girl in the world. (Kisses his hand R). * Tom. Amen to that. George. Aye, you may well say that. She is the apple of my eye. But, Tom (hesi tatingly), there is something that I ought to tell you. Tom. Fire away, Gordon. This is just the kind of night for a yarn. The rain falling outside, and the wind whistling through the keyhole, and down the chimney, are just the sort of accom paniments for a romance. Fire away. George. This is a romance, Tom, with pretty nearly all a dark side. Tom. Oh, well, skip all that. Call it volumes one and two, and come to volume three, where the happiness begins and continues. George. No, you must know everything. The fact of the matter is, Tom, it's a secret. Tom. A secret ? George. Yes, I have kept it too long. (Brokenly) God help me, how shall I begin ? Tom. Don't tell me if it will pain you. George. (Gruffly) Yes, it will be as well to get it over. Did you notice me when my darling asked me about her mother? Her words cut me like a knife. How often it happens that the wounds one receives come from the hands of those who are nearest and dearest to us (a pause). Tom, my girl's mother, you and she think is dead, still lives. Tom. Alive! George. Yes, alive. Would she were dead, for if ever I've cursed a woman, I've cursed her. Tom. Gordon ! George. Yes, cursed the mother of my darling —my wife. Listen before you judge me. Twenty years ago I married, and for three years I was fool enough to fancy myself happy. My darling was born, I had plenty of money, and my wife seemed to me perfection. Curse her. Excuse me, Tom, my bitter thoughts sometimes almost drive me mad. (Laughing grimly) She did hot love me. It was my money sh^if^ped for, and when that was gon^^^ I went on spending as though there were no bottom to my purse) she went too. Yes, Tom, she left me al^j^^arling without a word. And with the vilest blackguard that ever trod God's earth. Tom. Poor Gordon. (Timidly) And what did you do ? George. (Wildly) Do ? At first I made up my mind to follow them and kill them, and then to destroy myself, but Elsie toddled up to me,. and (wiping his eyes) I thought I would live for her. Tom. And he ? George. Is dead. He treated her like a brute, but I don't pity her; no, I don't'pity her. Why should I ? What pity had she for me—or her child ? Tom. * Then that letter you expect to night George. Is from her. Yes, Tom, you have guessed it. But not a word of this to my girl. She thinks her mother an angel in heaven intead of For ten years, Tom, I've made that woman an allow ance, and once a year she writes to acknowledge its receipt Bad as she is, I couldn't have slept if I had thought that she was starving. Tom. Poor Gordon! George. (Faintly) It was right that you should know all this, Tom. It wont make you love Elsie any the .less ? Tom. (Warmly) Love her less? It makes me love her more, poor darling, not to have known the joy of a mother's love. But she must never be told this Gordon. It would break her gentle heart. f : George. I thought you would say so, Tom,; but I didn't know. You see you have a sort of right— Tom. Hush! she is coming. [Enter Elsie]./ Elsie. May I come in? Have you both finished sounding my praises ? If not I shall shut myself up and; not come near either of you. (George rises and takes down overcoat). What, daddy, you are not going out. It is such a fearful night. George. I must go, my pet, but I shan't be long, and Tom will be here to keep you company. Elsie. But I "want you, daddy. I always want you. (Caresses him). George. There, there, anyone would think I was going on a long journey instead of a five minutes' walk into the township, or that something very dreadful was going to happen. (Patting her cheeks). Elsie. j I don't like you to go alone at night, j I should die if I were to lose my daddy as well as my mother. Tom. (Quickly) I will go with your father, Elsie, if you don't mind being left alone. Elsie. Oh, no. Who is there to harm me ? Go with him, Tom, and when you come back I shall have a surprise for you. George. Wilful woman again. It's no use arguing, Tom. 1 Tom. I don't intend to try. (Getting his coat.) The sooner we start the sooner we shall get back. Come along. George. (Opening door C). What a night! Tom. God help all the homeless ones. George. Amen to that, my boy, amen. Good bye, my darling. Elsie. Take care of him, Tom. (Throws them a kiss.) [Exit George and Tom]. Elsie. (Seating herself near the fireplace) Dear old daddy, how he loves me. And Tom. What a happy girl I should be. I have no mother, but father is father and mother both. How wet they will be when they come home. I must make them something. Oh, yes, some punch. Just fancy punch at Christmas in Australia. But it / ■ . will remind daddy of England. Now for the kitchen. (Tapping at door.) What is that? (Half rises.) Pooh! I am getting frightened. It seems that I do want a protector after all. (Tap ping heard again,) It is the wind shaking the door, J wish daddy hadn't gone out. He is not strong, like Tom. How brave and handsome Tom is. And to think that he should like poor little me. (Tapping renewed.) I believe there is someone outside. Who can it be ? Why should J be frightened ? It can be nobody who would hurt me. (Rises and goes to door). Who is there? No answer. (Opens door and Alice falls across threshold.) Oh, dear. A woman ! (Drags Alice in side and closes door.) Poor thing i She is wet through, (Kneels and takes Alice's head in her lap.) She has fainted. No; she opens her eyes. (To Alice) Can you walk as far as the chair?. Try. See, I will help you. Raise yourself a little. Lean on me. There; that's capital. (The two walk slowly to fireplace. Elsie puts Alice on chair.) Are you better now ? Alice. Yes. God bless you, whoever you are. (She speaks with difficulty.) Elsie. Hush, it is nothing. Let me take off your shawl. * Dear, dear, you are wet to the skin. What can I do. (Removes Alice's shawl.) There, I will put this by the fire in the kitchen. Don't move. I will be back-presently. Si [Exit.] Alice. (Feebly raising her head arid cough ing) Where ani I? How did I get here. (Coughs.) Oh, my head. I am dying. This must be the end of all. (Sinks back exhaustedly.) [Enter Elsie.] Elsie. (With glass of grog) Now, you must drink this, every drop of it. It will do you good. Alice. Nothing will do me good. Elsie. Nonsense.. You are wet and worn out. See, I can be severe. I am your doctor. Alice. (Drinking feebly ) You are very good. Elsie. Don't speak, or I shall be angry. Drink it all, and then you shall tell me how you came to be out in such a storm. No, not yet. You must not speak. When my father comes home we shall see what can be done. Alice. (Returning glass and coughing) There, I am better now, and I must be going. (Half rises.) Elsie. (Pushing her back) I am sure you shall not go. You will just sit there and rest yourself. Alice. Let me go. I am not fit to be here. You do not know what I am. Elsie. You are a woman, and a woman in trouble. That is enough for me. Alice. ^ And you—you are an angel—if there are such things as angels. Elsie. Oh, no, I am very plain flesh and blood. Don't move, please. I am the mistress here, and you shall see how tyrannical I can be. Alice. Why do you do this. If you knew me you would not. I am a very bad •woman. Elsie. Hush, hush, hush; I will not let you talk like this. (Alice has a fit of coughing.) See, you are making your self ill. Alice. Child, I am dying. But I am glad to die; yes, glad to be out of this world. Elsie. Hush! I cannot bear it. The world is so bright and fair. Why should we wish to leave it ? Alice. (Speaking painfully) Ah! you are young and hopeful, and you had a good mother, I can see. I—well, you can judge what I am. Elsie. (Sadly) I do not remember my mother. She died when I was too « young to understand. Alice. Then a good father. Elsie. Yes, the best of fathers. He will be home presently, and you shall see him. Alice. (Nervously) No. I do not wish to see anyone. I must go. Do not stop me. They will take me in at the hospital. I shall not long trouble them. (Coughs.) Elsie. % You shall go when the storm mode rates. But hark how the rain comes down. Alice. I am used to all kinds of weather, my dear (faintly). What is your name ? Let me have that to remember you by the little time I have to live. Elsiev My name is Elsie, but father calls me his Little Nugget. Alice. (Muttering) Elsie. Her name. And your father, what sort of man is he ? Elsie. Oh, big, and strong, and handsome. Are you a stranger here ? Every one knows George Gordon. Alice. (Aside) George Gordon ! My God ! (Aloud and feverishly) See, the wind is not so rough, and the rain has stopped. I must go. It is a matter of life and death. (Rises and seizes her shawl.) Elsie. (Detaining her) I will not let you go. Wait till my father comes. He is kind and good. Alice. No, no, I dare not. Child, may I kiss you ? Elsie. (Wonderingly) Yes. Alice. I am afraid. I am bad, very bad, and you, you are as pure as an angel. God bless you, my darlings—if he will listen to the prayer of such as I am. (Kisses Elsie repeatedly on forehead.) There. Let me go. Let me get away while there is time. (Coughs again.) Elsie. But you are ill. You must stay, j You shall not go out into the storm. Oh, I wish father would come. • Alice. No, no. (Struggles with Elsie and reaches door, then throws her arms round Elsie's neck and kisses her wildly.) My darling, God bless and keep you. (Rushes out.) Elsie. Oh, why did I let her go? It is raining still, and that poor woman is dying, I am sure. What can I do. (Tom appears at door.) Oh, Tom, I am so glad. Tom. (Entering) Glad because I've come back, dear. Your father will be here presently. He stopped to speak to one of the men at the mine. Elsie. Oh, Tom, go after her and bring her back. Tom. Go after who ? What is the matter, Elsie ? You are as white as a ghost, and you are trembling all over. Elsie. Never mind me, Tom. Bring her back. Tom. Are you teasing, Elsie ? T' Elsie. Tom, there has been a poor woman here. She is dying, and she has gone out into the rain again. Go and bring her back. Tom. I'm off. I'll have her here in no time. Elsie. Bless you, Tom. (Kisses him.) But be quick. Run. Tom. I\ll run fast enough. Which way did she go ? Towards the township ? I'll soon overtake her. [Exit.] Elsie. Oh, dear, I feel like a murderess letting that poor woman go away. If she were the worst woman in the world she should not be sent out there to die while there is shelter here. (Cry out side.) There is someone coming. That is Tom's voice. I am so glad. [Enter George and Tom carrying-Alice. J George. Here you are, my little nurse. I have a case for you. This poor woman has fainted, I think. I found her about a hundred yards or so down the road—nearly stumbled over her, in fact—and I was just lifting her up when Tom came running along like a mad man. Put her in the chair, Tom. (They place her in chair.) Elsie. Oh, father, she was here a little while ago. She is so ill, and I couldn't keep her. George. Well, make a glass of grog as quickly as you can, my pet. The poor thing is nearly perished. [Exit Elsie.] Tom. She looks as if she isn't long for this world. George. Oh, we'll bring her round fast enough. Alice. (Opening her eyes) Where am I? What! here again ? Oh! [Enter Elsie with glass.] George. There, don't talk. Here, take this draught—it's better than any quantity of doctor's stuff. (Hands her drink.) Alice. (Aside) He does notv know me. (Drinks feebly.) George. That's right. Now you feel better already, don't you? Keep still. We are not going to let you run away in a hurry. I wouldn't turn a dog outside to-night. Elsie. To-morrow, perhaps, we will let you go Alice. (Groaning) To-morrow! Where shall I be to-morrow. George. Why, here, to be sure, if you are not well enough to be moved. Alice. (Slowly turning and facing himjf George ! (Is seized by fit of coughing.) Elsie. Lie quietly and don't distress your self. You are with friends. Alice. Friends ! God help me. Gcorge. (Hoarsely) Elsie, who is this woman ? Elsie. I don't know, daddy. She knocked at the door and I let her in. She would not stay, though I tried to persuade her. George. Who is she ? Tom. (Alarmed) Gordon, you don't think— George. I don't know. There is something wrong. It is fearful. Alice. (After another fit of coughing) George Gordon, don't you know me ? George. Alice! You! Elsie. Daddy! Alice. Yes, it is what is left of Alice. Don't he afraid; I shall not torment you long. I did not want to come. It was an accident. I did not know that this was your house, though I did want to see my daughter—our daughter—before I died. I ran away. Why did you bring me back ? Elsie. Father ! who is this ? George. (Brokenly) What shall I say ? My darling, this is your mother—God help me, that I should say so. Elsie. My mother is dead. Alice. Not dead—only dead to you. Your mother was a bad woman. George! George. (Hoarsely) Well 1 Alice. I am dying. May I kiss her ? George. No. Elsie. Father! Is this my mother ? George. (Shuddering) It is. Elsie. Then I will go to her. (Throws her arms round Alice.) Mother ! George. Come away, Elsie, come away. Tom. (Sternly) Hush ! She is going fast. Alice. (Faintly) My darling Elsie, kiss me and forgive me. I have been a bad wife and a bad mother oh, how dark it is getting. George, forgive me. George. (Brokenly) I cannot. Elsie. (Kneeling) "Forgive us our tres passes, as we forgive them that trespass against us." Father, she is dying. Forgive. George. Elsie, you ask too much. I cannot forgive. Elsie. By the memory of him whose birth we celebrate to-morrow. Father! she is my mother. She is your wife. Don't let her go from us without one kind word, Speak, father, speak. Oh, mother, mother! SZT3 George. ^(Kneeling) Alice—I forgive.. Alice. At last, my God, at last! Tom. Dead. — Sfcrawber—"I think I should tell you, old man, that I am very sure your valet had your dress suit on the other night while you were away." Singerly—"He did, and it was all right. His looked better than mine, and I changed with him."
