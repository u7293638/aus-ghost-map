SPOUTING INTELLIGENCE. MELBOURNE HUNT CLUB RACES. The members of the Melbourne Hunt Club held their autumn meeting on the Flemington course on Saturday, but, although having the advantage of a partial holiday, combined with beautiful weather, it could scarcely be termed a success. Racing men are apt to associate a few good jumping races with a Hunt Club meet- ing, but in this instance the only relief to a monotony of events on the flat was a single steeplechase with limited entries. The pro- onimine was quito unworthy of the club that issued it, for even the flat races were not ot the Bort that bring Booti horses to the post, onlv one of the five events exceeding six. furlongs No doubt, under the circumstances, thoeiccutivoof the club did the hist thing possible in issuing a progtammc calculated to draw good fields ot inferior horses but tua stv le of racing is not popular with the public, who would rather Bee a two mile liamhciip with a half-do/eo ir-.Vclaas horses engaged In ft than any mrrnber of these short rushes between n. score of the weeds of the turf Such rac.!9 may do for an afternoon's sport at Moonae Valley on an off da), but are uitircl) out of place at Flemington Onbaturduj the nubile proved tina to be ttncûse ley not going out to flemington Thero were mail) v iicant spaces in the grand stand, mid the lawn, except at the saddling paddock end, was deserted. On tho hill a few people gathered about the flugstafi, and tho patrons of the tint could not nearl) fill the limitai space between two of the steeplechase jumps As might have been expected, with the racing confined almost exclusively to the Btroigut, there was nothing sensationul in any of tho events. 'lhere was an ominous reduction in the field for the opening event, the Selling Knee Fourteen horses appeared on tho curd, but only tinco at the post Liddington waa thought to be the best ol the trio, und he proved it bj winning ensilj. 'J he feat was not BO meritorious, hovvevu, as to enhance the value of the horse to any txtint, nnd he wies sold to Mr J B Gill tor 10 guineas. Ihe held lor the Cormtliian 1 [nee- waa reduced one half before the horses mine to tho post, and Fallieron, as indicated bj the betting, turned out to be the best of the four. The winner waa ridden bv Mr Bj inc. The populnntj of the Bhort rates with horse owners was shown hythe fact that l8 liorac's caine to the post for a scramble over the four furlongs of the Fljing Stains Fuckers were again fortunate, for Cupola and The Ghost, the onlv two hoi sea backed, ran first and second respectively A good deni of money waa won in doubles ovtr tina tient and the Corinthian Face, Cupola and l'tulleioo being backed until the odtla became so short as to be sciucely worth taking. Although the held tor the Steeplechase was a Billilli one-, it was the onlj event in thu pro L.riiminc of any interest to those w ho carne for the nuke of the racing alone The top weight on blackthorn was not considered too severe to stop linn in the coiupnnj, and he waa made lirst favourite, while those who bud any doubts tin the nutter put their money on Black Jacket, the lightweight hoiseof the field, lind so made lum second favourite- The Buonil fence stopped Midnight and Aus- tralian Court, but otherwise the round WIIB safely completed, Blackthorn, notwithstand- ing Ina weight, showing the wuy to the otlieis The horses jumped neath, with the exception of Chippenham, who wenl much higher than was iii- cessniy, and lost time at lus fences Towards the liniah Black ducket iippeiirtti likely to make a race of it with the favourite, but alter blundering bailly nt oin linn , he struck the nixt ao iiartl as to dislodge Ina ndir, and for the nat of the- jourmj Blackthorn illili little dilhiult) in kteping ilear of Chippenham, who had tued too much to turn his pace to account '1 bus far the favourites hutt won in ever) event, and the lajcrs ot otitis were not checrlul In the two remaining nets, however, tiny rt council slightl) The brum Selling lince, with its novel t onditiom, ¡irought eiglit horsLS to tilt post, mid was, «ith the exception ot the jumping race, the most hiteiisting tvint ot tin dij 1 guton was looked upon tia ti ctrtain winnitinni backers with tin coiilidince bom of a run of success, supported the horse down to even money Thej had to lest satisfied with a good run for their rnoncj, how iver, as Impulse whose brieiling should lum been something of a lciommuidntion, won loiufortnblj, the fnvouute being second, and Pan third Impulst was offered for silt by Mr íuille according to the con dinoun of the rate, and Mr Hurtle 1 ibhir -no doubt with an tje to the value of tho mare for stud purposes-bought hu for 130 gumías tin club thus mttUmg JO gumías above the value of tin rice 1 hu Queens Birthday Stakes, which was run ni partial clnrkuiss, was tin closing unit, and biought out 19 horsis, tin largest liild of the duy Finkirs, through engullías to put their money on Cupola a tonner winner, over looked Pailleroo, who lind also attained the honour, anti the latter won bj ii length, although Hie Ghost would probably have beuten linn lind not the saddle slipped lound underneath the horae during the IULC The following are the details of tin running - si MINC u set Of 50 bom Tho w Innoi to ho sohl for £100 Wolçhts -2 ira, 8»t , I xra, list lib , 4 jisaticl upwards Out 71b 71b alloue!
