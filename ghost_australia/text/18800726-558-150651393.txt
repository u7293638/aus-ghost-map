" ALAS! POOR GHOST The Balhurst Free Press states that in the western portion of the town is situ ated a piece of grountl on which a build ing is erected. This property has been in the occupation of a man whom we will call Ghost for a length of time, and the law ful owner up to tho present has been tumble to'eject him. Being afraid that the law may shortly be put in force, and that he may be compelled to give up pos session, Ghost has been adopting certain plans in order that the value of tho pro perty may bo depreciated. The property haseitherbeen purchased, or is underoffor, and, in order to frighten any person from purchasing the premises, the man has lately been moving about the paddock near the street covered with a large "white sheet, thus attempting to lead people to believe that the place was haunted, and that the restless spirits were exercising themselves after nightfall. This scheme of his succeeded to his own satis faction for a time, until a few- nights ago a young man was passing the spot referred to, when suddenly he saw what ho took to be a ghost. He was alarmed, and in life fright stood motionless in the street, .when seeing the " spirit" moving towards him he became still more alarmed. He had with him a faithful dog, and, calling the animal by name, told him to " take to him." The dog obeyed his master's command and made straight for the " spirit," who, noticing the turn matters had taken, endeavored to seek shelter in the house ; but before he had gone far the dog had seized the sheet with which he was covered, tearing it from top to bottom, and exposing to view the body of the man. Tho dog then made for his legs, and gave the ghost some severe bites. The spirit tried to kick the dog off, and while doing this the young man, who by this time had recovered from his fright, threw a stone at him and struck him in the small of the back. The additional pain caused by this blow made tho man cry aloud and use language the reverse of polite.
