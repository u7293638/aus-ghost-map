Spiritualistic Trickery. No Ohos ta In America, THE commission appointed by tho University of Pennsylvania under the will of the late Henry Seybert to investigate the so-called phenomena of modern spiritualism have come to the conclusion that there is nothing extra- ordinary in any of these manifestations that is attributable to anything moro mysterious than legerdemain. The full report of tho commission, which will shortly bo issued by the Lippincotts, is likely to attract a good deal of attention. Tliey report that the demonstration of the trickery of slate-writ- ing is conclusive, ns is that of the purely physiological origin of the rappings. It was the common experience of tho Seybert Com- mission that " as soon as au investigation worthy of the name begins, all manifestations of spiritual power cease." They were told of the marvellous things that tho spirits did ; but when it was sought to have theso miracles repeated in their presence, the " conditions" were "inharmonious," and nothing took place. The commission say, in concluding their report : " We regret that thus far we have not been cheered in our investigations by the discovery of a single novel fact; but, undeterred by this discouragement, wo trust, by your permission, to continuo them with what thoroughness our future oppor- tunities may allow, and with minds as sin- cerely and honestly open as heretofore to conviction."
