They buried her, and he .went away. "I went to. live in a village some thirty miles away-. I took no especial care of either of. them. but *they grew and thrived in spite of .that. .fy daughter had brown eyes and flaxen hair, and was small and delicate-looking-nmuch the prettier of the two. The earl's daughter had grey eyes and brown hair, 'and was largefor a child of two years. She had her mother's temper and her mother's twvil;-mine was'one of the gentlest crea tures that ever was born. I called the earl's daughte IKatherine; I called mine Ceoll,. as Lord Ruysland had desired iis baughter to be named.: I avaswell paid, but I grew tried to death of taking care of them and vegeta'ting in a stupid vil lage. I wrote to Lord Ruysland to come for his child.' "He came, and I gave him mine. I-did not let bhlin see the other at all. ':Ttold uin mIy inLle girl was ailing, anD ne tOOK the other awoay totally unsuspecting. Then I sold off everything and went to France, taking little IKathie with , me. The collision in which I was badly hurt followed; the child escaped. In the hos pital Colonel Dangerfield came to see me. He thought I was poor, and I did riot un 'deceive him. His only daughter had been instantly killed. He offered to adopt little Kathie in her stead, and I closed with the offer at once. I never saw her again until, under the name of Mrs Vava sor, I came to Scarswood Park, and met her as Sir John's heiress. . "I solemnly swear that the young girl who was known as Katherine Danger Ifield was, in reality, the Lady .Cecil Clive, only child of the Earl and Countess of Ruysland. The person who now bears that title is my daughter, christened Katherine Harman. I will swear thisin any court of law. I changed them out of revenge upon the late Lady Ruys land. \- (Signed) "HARRIET HARMALN."?',. The wretched woman wrote her name; old Hannah and HenryOtisaffixed theirs as witnesses. He folded up the docu ment, superscribed it "Confession of Harriet Harman," and placed it in his breast pocket She sat watching every motion with terrified eyes. "What are you going to do with it?"' she asked, eagerly.. "I am going to place it in the.hahds of Lord Ruysland between this and to-mor-. row night. The rank and . name your daughter, has usurped for two-and twenty years shall he takeir from her be fore the expiration of: four-and-twenty. hours" "It was no fault of hers,":the 'guilty a'oman said, with trembling lips. She started to her feet aned caught him as he wa sturning away. "Take me away from, this horrible' ouse--now, at once. Do anythlng you as he was turning away . "Not to-night," he answered coldly. S'It is impossible. You would make your escape, and that I can't: allow. Six years ago .you had your day-this , is mine.

Hannah, take her up to the room prepar ed for her, and' remain with her` all He drew himself from her grasp, and left the room. He heard her cry. qf terror and despair as he went out. Miss Herncastle Was standing in the passage. Ele took her hand and led her into an-: other room, and gave her the paper., "The world shall know you as you. are at last," he said-"shall give 'yoduthe name you should have bornie from your? birth. Let me he the firstto. call you by, it." He lifted her hand 'to his lips. "Lady ; CHAPTER XXVIII-HIUNTEDI DOWN.: It was very early. on-; thd morning of the ensuing day-so early.that the rosy spears ofsunrise were but'just'.lancing through the tall firs and''waving brake around Bracken Iollow-when a loud, huthoritattive knock aroused the inmates of the lonely old house from their slum bers. In five minutes old Hannah was p, and dressed, and in:the room of her young mistress. Katherine (let usdallherbythetheoldname) had sprung fromn ,her .bd also as that authoritative knock resounded, through the house. "It must be Henry Otis--it can be no One' else at this hour. Go, open the ldor, Hannah,and let them in, whoever they may be." Hannah went. She flung open the 'door, and stood confronted by a tall Tnan, with a dark, handsome, stern-look ing face, and an unmistakably military air. "I wish to see Miss Herncastle," this gentleman began, with perfect abrupt mess; "I know that she is here." "Who are you, sir?" old Hannah de nianded,'with equal sternness; "and by what right do you come at such a time Of morning as this, routing decent folks dut of their beds?" "My name is O'Donnell. I am Miss HIerncastle's friend, and I have come to 'lo her a service; while there is yet time. 'Before two hours it may be too late. Give her this, I entreat you, and tell her I must see her." "Yes, Hannah, give it to me. I'm not afraid of Captain O'Donnell. Let me see ,what he has to say." It was Katherine herself--in slippers 'nd. dressing gown-her brown hair un Idone, ripptling in the old girlish way over her shoulders. In that white negligee, With hair unbound, and its natural col 'or, she looked, with the rose-flush of the LAugust sunrise upon her, younger, fair er, fresher, than he had ever seen her b?efore. She took no notice of him. She took the card from Hannah gravely-and :gravely examined It. Beneath his name in Dencil was written "I know that'you are here.

" ' "' Again his listeneri sniiled as she recall-' ed Sir Peter's ghastljy face of fright.' "Captain O'Donnel,'. I cannot: under stad whliy you should take the trouble to come hereandi say this. Why should you endeavor to save a woman you hold in aversion and contempt-a woman, in short, whom you hate?" . \- "Whom I hate!"-he repeated; quietly. "Since when have I told you I hated you? I have heard Katherilne Dangerfield's story--a strange, sati'stoiry-ant I ,:be lieve her, even in this hour, to be more sinned against than sinning. . I believe a great and generous nature has -been warped. Katherine Dangerfield, I pity you-from my soul I do - and with; my whole heart I stand before you;,your friend. It is not. too late yet ; pause; while there is yet time; on the road you are treading, and go back." \- There was no mistaking his earnest: ness, the generous glow of his fice,:the friendly warmth of. his tone. She lhal turned away from him and was lobking out at the golden morning siy;'. ' "Go black!"' she repeated, bitterlyi "I?' theie ever any going back in this woild? Six years ago I might.:have.-listehed ; toe day it is too late. '. '-She 'covered her face dit? her hands," her breast eavi'g~; 'tie' color burning iii her face, moved tb the iery depth of hei soul with a passioi: of which he did not dream; .' "Come,. Katherinre- bou ,have. fouiht long and well, and nothinig has come' odf it. Give it up, and for ever."; . Her hands dropped from her face some thing in the last words seemed to rouse her. She looked at him steadily.,..': "And nothing has comne of it?'" shere. peated. "That is your mistake,: Captain: O'Donnell. Something has come of iti 1 wonder what you would say if I told yo( -what?" "Tell me, and see." "I confess," she went on, "to all laid to my charge. I am Katherine Danger field; I have been buried and risen from the dead, and with that resurrection my nature seemed to change. I have brood ed on one subject-my wrongs-until I believe my brain has turned. I fled from the house of my true and loyal friend, Henry Otis, and went to America. I be came the New York actress you so clev erly recognised. From New York I wrote to Mr Otis. I told him if Gaston Dantree died to bury him decently-if he lived, to furnish him with money to quit England. Unhappily he died, but not for more than a year after receiving his injuries. All those years I remained in New York I worked hard in my profes sion, and rose. I made money, and 1 hoarded it like a miser. Day and night, stronger and stronger with each year, grew the determination to return, to keep my vow. I tell you I believe there were times when I was insane on this subject. Death alone could have held me back. I waited patiently, while burning with impatience; I worked, I hoarded, and at last my day came. I returned to Eng land; I made my wary into the family of Sir Peter Dangerfield; my revenge had begun. "I had a double motive in returning one, my'vengeance on him; the other, to discover my parentage. I had a clue; and, strange to say, in working out one, I was working out the other. You know what followed--I played ghost, and terri fied the master of Scarswood, as I think he was never terrified before. I owe you no grudge; you were doing 'your duty, and I honor you for It.

When Captain O'Donnell had left Bracken Hollow, she took pen and paper and wrote the following note to Mr Otis, which subsequently Hannah was in structed to give to that gentleman when he came over from Castleford : "Henry-imy Brother,-You will be surprised- pained, angered, it may be when I tell you I am going, and coming back no more.

Mly father would never care for me-would look upon me as a shame and disgrace. Let it go withl all the rest! "Captain O'Donnell has proved him self my friend. For his sake I renounce my cherished vengeance. Let the miserable woman we have lured here go. Do not follow me. When happier days arrive I will come to you. Do not fear for me.
