THE SIEGE OF CHITRAL. One of the chief charms of " Chitral, the Story of a Minor Siege," is the delightful unconscious ness with which Sir George S Robertson, KCSI, records events of which he was a great part The siege of Chitral may indeed have been a minor one as compared with the age of Sebastopol, of Lucknow, or of Pans, minor as regards the number of men engaged on both sides and the importance of the issue but in point of view of the gallantry and devotion of the besieged it does not yield in interest to any of those The hero of Chitral was the writer of this book which comes to us from Messrs George Robertson and Co ), but the reader will search its pages again for any hint let alone mention, of the fact Sir George tells the story plainly and simply, lighting up its details with flashes of fun and a sustained humour which are as delightful as they are rare in such a history Here, for instance, is a pen portrait which is worthy volumes of statistical detail for the understanding of the subject -"As in India, your native groom actually sees the frightful ghost spring from a tree, and afterwards tells you the story with starting eyeballs and a damp brow, so the Chitral, m equally good faith, relates his fables, usually with this preamble of was, or was not has been, or has not been ' Do I tell you a ho ?
