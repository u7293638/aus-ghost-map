It is the offspring of Mrs. Joseph Finny, whoso husband ia a well to do farmer. at Cardington, Ohio. A physician of prominence in the State thus describes the strange' being, which was born in Noveiriber last :—' This wonderful thing can be truly called a double child; There is but one spine, at each extremity of which there is p per fectly formed head and face. Each has well forriied1 shoulders, arms, and hands, and a good chest, containing lungs and heart, as 'any other human being. Each has also a atoma'cli' and liver: ? There is but one navel, which is in the centro of the abdomen, equi distant from tho two heads. 1 It is at the iniddlb of the body that the two are grown together: The abdomen appears to be but one and the organs contained in it, below the stomach and small intestines, aire probably ?common to tlie two. Upon one side there is a' Well formed pair of hips, legs, and feet. 'TJpon tho opposite' side there is'one large leg (possibly tho consolidation of two legs), upon the extremity of which -there arb eight toes. Most' monStrbsities are repugriant to look uporiV This' one'' is -not so in any respect, ex 'cepting this leg.' This child or these children are now ten days old, and are now doing* as well as' children mostly do at that period of existence. ? It nurses at both heads. One will' be 'asleep while the other is crying, and sbPfiefcitnes both will sleep or cry at -the same time. In - sex- it is a female. Thie length from the top of one head' tb- the top of the bther is twenty inches, and the weight at birth' was ten pounds.' , ' Butcher Jablc.— The following is related by thb Special ' Correspondent, of the, 'Daily 'News' before' Motz :— The night before the Battlp of Balaclava; one of the , bntohora of a light cavalry regiment got desperately drunk rind' was handed over to. the. custody of the guard.
