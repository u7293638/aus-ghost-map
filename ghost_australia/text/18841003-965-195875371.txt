The Images formed,on the Jfretina by the same object at different fiis- I tances are very similar,^differing only in size and distinctness. .For tiiis reason it is j ^difficult to judge of distance, requiring much j practice. A person standing on a straight |;etrip of railroad is rarely able to tell whether l a distant train is approaching, or receding, orat rest, so sllight ib the change in apparent size from which the distanoe is to be esti-. j: mated. Upon the sea it is vety difficult, I without long practice, to judge of distances. / As a curious instance of inability to judge I of distances, and hence' bf the direction oi horizontal motion, jnay be mentioned that of the governor id a Bteam engine. At a certain distanoe (say 50 feet) the eye Mil aeon to. see the b^ls turning in a. certain direction, ; but on next looking at them this motion seems to have changed to the reverse, and after several alternations the mind becomes perplexed, and finally is able to see them timiing either way. A^ outline drawing of a cube may be akde.tp look like the interior, or exterior at •will at a considerable distance: the real cube can be mode to do the same. Shading, perfective, &c.;', are resorted to by the artist to give the idea of distance. In the matter of direction deception is not : so easy as in distance. Our experience tells i ns that if a person hits us in the back with a j bail lie is probably behind, not in front of us. The objeot seen lies in the same direction as that from which the light comes when it. enters the eye. If by any. means the direction of the ray has been changed between the ' time when it left the object and the time when it reached the eye, this rule is violated, and deception results. When this change is effected by the reflection it is attended with more or less loss of light, sometimes with distortion, and it little experience leads me cine to Buspect a reflecting surface, if the mirror is very perfect, the most careful person is liable to be misled. The well-known " ghost " is due to the reflection of a strongly ughted figure from a pltfe of unsilvered glass.

The painter's art largely consists in deceiving the eye; in so mixing and blending his pigments that they produce the same impression as stone and wood, or earth and trees, or flesh and blood would do ( pleasure derived from the imitation exceeds J that given by the reality, just as misery and land suffering, when well .depicted OH the 1 stage, give pleasure, but the sight of the reality gives pain In many things the mind fenjoys being deceived, . ana . optical . illusions give us pleasure, I 80 much so that those who are capable of I completely deceiving this tbe aoutest of our | senses get well pud for exorcising their talents. : H.
