THE BISHOP OF GOULBURN AND THE MOM AN CATHOLIC CHURCH. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In your issue of last Saturday you allowed about a column and a half of your valuable space to his Eminence Cardinal Moran for one or his many diatribes against the Church of England. I have no intention of engaging for the present in controversy with his Eminence on the statements of that letter, but I ask permission to set forth a few heads of arguments which show how propositions is the claim of the Roman Church to that apostolical which he affirms to be a divine and distinctive feature, of the Catholic, religion the Apostle St Judo'elis us that the faith of the Gospel is a " faith " which was " once for all dell' v ered to the saints " Nothing, therefore, can be of the essence of apostolic doctrine which has not been so from the beginning But the faith delivered by the Apostles and received by the Church was by the Roman Church been added to, corrupted, and debased by superstitious I shall find it no difficult task to make this clear under various headings the Roman Church has made corrupt additions to the Catholic r ced The 6 income formula is that v Inch the Catholic Church Ima every where received as representing the Apostles' doctrine In 1501, by the authority of Pope Pius IV , 13 clauses were added to this creed, and these novelties together with the ancient formula are declared to be " the true Catholic faith, out of which none can be saved " In 1854 Pope Pius IX pronounced as " of Clio with " the doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in 18/0 tho s train Pope declared the doctrine of his own lufulhbdity, and eminent and learned theologians of the Roman Church, such as Dr Ton Doiltugor, were " excommunicated " for refusing to accept as true what the whole history of Christianity demonstrated to be false They held fast to the old Rome has shed on the now To no case co said the dictum of the Fathers be more exactly applicable " You have changed your doctrine, you cannot be the Church of Christ " the Roman Church has corrupted the doctrine of the seamen of the Lord's body and blood. The theory of transubstantiation, which dates as a dogma from A D 1215 with its mediaeval conception of substance " and " accidents " has been well de- scribed! by a Russian writer is " materialistic theological anatomy and blasphemous scholastic ration- arising" It has changed the institution of Christ into a means of providing on external and localised object of worship The result has been the spread of a debased materialism It was against this materialism that 'the English Church protested in the sixteenth century, as Barham, and others had protested in the mu ii century but we did not burn people because they upheld it Roman priests, we are assured by Cardinal Vaughan, have the power " to produce the living Jesus upon the altar The Apostolic Church which it always hole' that, in some ineffable way, the body and blood of Christ are the inward part of the s is ruinent, yet because it is ineffable made no attempt to define it " If thou seest after the manner how this is, let it suffice thee to be told that it is by the Holy Ghost, in like manner as by the same Holy Ghost the Lord formed flesh of Himself from the Mother of God Jsor know I ought more than this, that the word of God is true, powerful, and almighty , out Kua manner of operation is research. able " (1st John oUVDamaEcua, A D 700) The Roman Church j of cases to know better than the Apostolic Church I via Roman Church has imperilled the doctrine of our Lord's holy in carnation It has done this by comparatively rocenfctnoielties At the end of the seventeenth century a certain man saw many visions, and eventually became the foundress of the popular Roman devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus " Our Lord's "heart " has been selected as an object of special worship. The Apostolic writers teach that worship is due to the divine person of our Lord, not to our special organ of His human body to direct exclusive worship to a bodily organ is to divide Christ But no separation can be made, or ought to be made, between His two natures, human and divine, which are for over joined together in the unity of His divine person, never to be divided the practice savours strongly of Nestoritimsm, condemned by the Catholic Church at the General Council at Ephesus, A v 431 Noatorionism made separation botw cen out Lord's Godhead and manhood the council condemned this separation and the offering of worship to the one not addressed to the other. The Roman Church offers worship, not even to our Lord's entire humanity, but to one separate org *n of His body Romanists seem to have forgotten that " God and Man is one Christ ' It was (they say) to guard more strictly the truth of Ills incarnation that the doctrine of the immacu- late conceptions of the Blessed Virgin Mary was pronounced in 18in to be " of the faith 2 That such a doctrine preached on the honour due to the Saviour as alone " with but sin is self-evident But there is a further dishonour done to our Lord by robbing him of His sole prerogative as the One Mediator between God and man " According to the "Tablet" notepaper October 10, 1 SOI, the present Pope is made to say, As no man goeth to the Father but by the Son, so limestone man goeth to Christ but by His Mother In the encyclical letter by the same Pope on the Rosary " we have some equally apostolic statements in the same direction ' It li from her as from a big feed dawn that arose the day of happiness and joy which was never to set " (Ac- cording to the Apostle no Scriptures it is her Divine Son who is " the dayspring from on high that visited us ") She is " the Queen of the Universe, who shines therein with a crown of stars, so that by its very name the ' Rosary ' appears to foreshadow and be an augury of the joys and garlands of heaven, offered by her to those whip are devoted to her " Where, I would ask, in the Apostolic writings do we and asiuglopassage which many degree warranted such perversions of Divine truth the Roman Church has within its own limits changed the constitution of ho Apostolic Church " Popery ' is altogether una apostolic The foundations of it were laid in the ninth century by an enormous forgery of ecclesiastical d documents, which Pope Nicholas I had the hardihood 1 to assure certain Frankish Bishops had long I then preserved in the Roman archives Of the texts of scripture now commonly alleged to uphold the in dear conception of the Pope's mon Treby and falls city (they are very few ), I know of no early Christian water that givil the interpretation which Roman controversialists attempt to read into them That which is commonly alleged as supporting the falls tality dogma ia S Luke, xxii, 32, " I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not," even , but not one ever supposed it bore such a meaning until Pope Agatha (about A D 080) used it to try and shipped from blame his predecessor Honorina, whom the sixth General Council had condemned for heresy. Nor must it he imagined that this n Honorius is the only Pope guilty of complicity with heretical doctrine, while of other Popes it has been written toll they wore " men wallowing in the offal of the grossest somes, vicar far than even the a\ eruge of bad men in bad times " 'to believe in these men as the infallible Vicar of Christ on earth is to secure "unity." A marvellous unity, when "Mr HW j years. ending 1419 An there were 27 or ''9 and Popes to 210 Popes about one to seven o t eight.
