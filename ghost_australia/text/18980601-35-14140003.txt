Whom he put Win proportion whether the people would take fe alteration as it was now offered to them or put it back for a grant on the answer in favour of present federation Aas secured and beyond cavil 1 urning to the fe legal Hag, he explained that the uInto hell meant puree, thoc-oossymbolised freedom, and the stars would be seen by those who stuck to the Union to belong to the cam sky under which they lived-the Southern Cross. After dealing in a drastic manner with what he termed the " bogeys, inisrejirefeutaliúD, and falsehood " which had been di seminuted broadcast, Mr Barton finishes with an impassioned and eloquent appeal to the electors, cheer upon cheer pin our tied his fervid utterances, and when at the ci o " he asked the people not to let the end of June go by so that it would be said afterwards that they had given a vote which would cause (them shame, when it night late been the indoor tren sons for all time," The Jonioustrutiou reached a climax, and an over whelming majority pronounced their adhe- sign to the hill Thus one of the most memorable assemblies of the people ever hold in Sydney came to an eminently st isfactory ci Delusion I UNFURLING THE FEDERATION 1 LAG The Chairman called on the lion AV It Campbell to hand over the federation ling, which had been pia sented by the women of Austral a to Mr Barton the Hon W H Campbell addressed the meeting as " fellow Australians ' He said they were now face to face with one of the greatest cases in the history of Australia. He had been asked there that night to lurk in some little ug way what he called the birth of Australia (Cheers) He proceeded I need a good deal of interruption to proclaim the merits of the Commonwealth Bill luck, during tremendous cheering, he asked Mr Barton to unfurl the flag When this lent and accomplished the hall la sounded with lunging 1 ours, but the ovation was u a rod by a len voices, which lent themselves to hooting Mr Burton thereupon remarked, " You will 8.0 what kind of patriotism it is that prompts men to shoot their national flag." (Cheon) ) He thanked the women of Australia through Mr. Campbell for the gift, which he regarded as their tribute to their country and their country's cause (Cheers ) He then read the following verses - A century since, our birthrate morn llroUc on a wilderness of trees And freedom saw her )uuuneatboru Cradled ninth 1 pacific series 1 here, as she watched the sleeping child, "Uneonfccious lord of empire wide, She chose a banner, undented, 1 he bloc to still, the man to guide " ity foes, ' she cried, " with emblems fair ''any line to fight their hosts of slaves One to send my child shall bear '* Die seaborne Cross that rules the waves, " The free man still, where'er he moves, shall greet the sits his sires have known 1 " And lady en shall lick the flit!; H love " With bright l glories of its own ' Bhotpoke Our lim 1 at her decree, In mingled splendour saw them nee The Crops that United o'er every sea, John Cross that decks the midnight skies. So may they float for evermore The match thurn, may Australia stand race us the waves Mint guard herBhoie, 1 here us the Heavens t! at bless her land I (Loud applause ) The Chairman, in opening the main proceedings, said federalists and the federal cause had met with powerful opposition and much misrepresentation, the alarmist cry had gone through the land, but, fortunately, the cause had had able men to battle front (Hear, hear) The bill spelt prosperity, not rum. Let them " Shoulder to shoulder Bland like a wall, each for the Common we ciUth and God for them all." (Cheers ) MR! BARTON'S SPEECH. Mr Barton, who was received with great applause, said that that enormous gathering afforded the strongest proof that interest in federation was grow- ing day by dar- He had no fear of the result of the polling. (Cheers ) The heated language and v croaking that came from the quarter of conspiracy Was nothing but the boosting of the mail who knew he had a losing cause the flag floating before the meeting symbolised poses and Love and union under the Crown and beneath the Southern Cross and the men who now hated it would see on Friday next the dawn of a larger Australia and the death of narrowness and disunion (Applause ) Coming now to the bill he had to say that right from the beginning its opponents had not adduced one shred of argument their attack had been one of misrepresentation (Hear, hear ) There had been so many ghost stones spread about the bill that one would think the name federalists owned a, graveyard (Laughter ) the other side was all " ifs " and " supposes " Constitutions were not made for people whose lives were a succession of nightmares (Hear, hear ) Constitution s were not made to meet every silly little contingency which any man might foresee If they were then there could never be a constitution (Hear hear ) Amongst many bogies which had been raised by the opponents of the measure was the State ment that Uto bill gave the power to the minority in order to defeat them with their own materials he quitted from the constitution of the Political Labour League which contained practically the principle of equal State representation as well as the other principle of alteration of the constitution The league, however, made the latter castor of attainment in proportion than did the bill. The principle of equal representation rested simply upon the fact that the constitution was to be a federal constitution and it was a federal constitution conspicuously in respect of equal representation in the Senate There was not one provision in the bill to on ible the smaller States to pass a law antagonistic to the wishes of the majority It was utterly impossible for them to injure the larger colonies The principle was inserted in order to give the smaller colonies as of portunity to get a fair hearing, and without it no State in the group would enter uitovafcdcinl union In no national or State can foresee or House could proportionate representation reasonably be claimed Equal representation rested tiponifoundnttoii of absolute justice EachStatohold the same relation to the Empire as every other State, and was entitled to the same lowers of preserving its corporate existence (Hear, hear.) He explained the deadlock clauses, and pointed out that the Senate was not given the advantage of those clauses That showed that the Senate was not to dominate the constitution (Hear, hear ) In case of disagree- ment both Houses had to go Park to " their motors " (Loud cheers ) He defended the policy of payment of members of the Federal Parliament, and expressed the opinion that a " wise discretion " would be exercised by members of both Houses to avoid an open rupture when disagree- ments occurred there would be very few "double dissolutions " (Laughter ) Besides it was not likely that a constituency would vote Democratic in the House and Conservative in the other There would be a general line of community and feeling between our House and the other (Cheers ) Coming to the joint sitting of the two Houses, in CIBO of continued disagreement after a dissolution, Hi Barton alluded to the three- fifths majority clause and entered into a series of calculations to show how automatically it worked the larger States would still have enough to boat the smaller States under the three fifths majority rule, although six of their number were away) Again, if remembers were away from the smaller States, 14 members could be ass By from the larger States, and yet the latter would still have a majority Need be quote figures further to show that there would be majority rule when the time came I (Loud cheers The "hide-bound' condition of the constitution as it was termed by the anti-federalists, was alluded to A strong denial of the fact was given the power of amendment was contrasted with that of the American and Canadian Constitutions The objection of the anti federalistswassillv Itvvasreill) Line it was dropped. (Cheers) True democrats wanted to be saved from themselves in the matter of the alteration of the constitution The States made the constitu- tion, and it rises 0 lly fan that it should be necessary that a majority of the States should be required to agree to any alteration (Cheers ) Passing away from that matter Mr Barton came to what he terms 1 the important matter of (finance " The two years bookkeeping system was explained in detail The object was to allow time to the Federal Government to collect data and gain experience (Applause ) to distribute the r venue according to local needs " would be to distribute the surplus belonging to New South Wales to the other colonies Nor would a per capita division meet the circumstances of the case lbo«oHi;ro the only two alternative systems that had been suggested The proposal in the bill was us, however, the best Let the other side of say what better scheme they could propose they were as dumb as oysters (Cheers ) it w is ridiculous to talk about federating the railways and the debts at the present time The same authority which kept the land should 1 cup control over the things which developed the laudatory with the railways and the rivers But we should lose everything under Dr MacLaurin's unification scheme The country lion was classic on these matters When the people and the Parliaments were agreeable these reforms could be carried out They were there to adopt what was a radical and nothing else (A voice "Good talk, Toby," and laughter) Yes, it was pretty good-it was always good to be practical show, he had to deal with the federal funds Ev ci body admitted that the tariff is as a speculative business They could only estimate on a certain percentage, but they could not say whether that her centage of could be maintained Mr Pulsford Mr Coghlan, Mr Nash, the Finance Committee, and all others had estimated the tariff upon the percentage which they thought the collection of Victoria would bear to the whole collect! his under a federal tariff applying to all the colonies Nobody knew yet how Victoria or any other colony would get on (Hear, hear ) 1 nus they were presented with widely divergent estimates, and now Mr Coghlan, utter agreeing to the conclusions of the Finance Committee, says there will have to be a duty of 27 per cent. His own argument and his varsiDg figures, however showed how hard pressed he was to frame some estimate It was time they were done with speculations of that kind He was not attacking Mr Coghlan personally, but he was defending (the bill (Ap plan c ) An extraordinary fit element had been made in a public print to the effect that Victoria would get federation it 2s 6d per head, while it would cost New South W des 22s 6d per head The constitution Justly provided for the return to each colony of the surplus of receipts over expenditure, and that f is a sufficient provision to protect New South Wales from being worsted there must be inequalities at the outset of any new scheme of Cuarteo, but day by day in practice the inequalities would melt away, and gradually a law and common level would be attained So far as New South Wales was concerned it had been turning capital into revenue and called it profit So they had put themselves into a nominally better position than the other colonies and had been able to subsist on less revenue duties t I hits arose The inequalities, and nothing but a universal wants of all the States would wipe them away (Hear, hear ) the expansion of energy, the spread of industry (cheers)-and the promotion of internal exchange which would follow the day the people recognised their brethren as the right men to trade with, would all lead to a better material condition, with the result that the purchasing power of the community would expand That brought him to the Braddon clause and the argument that it taxed the people to a rigid state of things how he did not particularly like that Braddon clause, but it waBbyno means the horrible thing it was Raid in some quarters to be It did not interfere with the rights of a free Parliament to legislate is the best interests of a free people (Applause ). The bounty bogey he would leave alone it had been laid low long ago, after the Sydney Morning Herald " had referred to the Hon Sydney Smith is the ' bogey man ' (Laughter and hear, hear ) He would merely say of the bogey that it was the worst, the most insidious, and least warranted of any that had been raised the railway bogey was that ye were to be robbed of our railways, and that Sydney was to be robbed of her trade tOh ' of Sydney must face the cost of intercolonial freetrade (Cheers ). If she desired to stop out of federation until she could have federation, without intercolonial freetrade, and would have to stop out of it for ever She could no have Freetrade at her port and yet 'turn her key on the border" (Applause ) That was not free trade, and without freetrade there could be no federation Hnclw ay preferential tariffs, which were border tariffs ill disguise, would have done (Cheers ) But we could manage our own internal railways just is we desired (Hear hear) He pointed out that the Railway Commission was not foisted upon us by Victoria. The proposal for the Commission came from the New South Wales delegates The prison was one of the best in the bill there was no right given to the Commission to interfere with the rate of wages to railway servants (Cheers) Now he came to another matter They were asked to reject the constitution with a view of securing a better one in years to come Was it Mr Want, Dr MacLaurin and Mr Sleath who were going to make it? " Oh, oh," and laughter ) Or was it Mr Rosa, or Mr F Thomas Dodd ' (Ironical cheers ) Would hear work he superior to that of Mr H E O'Connor, Mr M'Millan, and Mr Wise ' (Applause ) The public might well ask "What are they giving os?" (Laughter and applause ) Were they to wait from 1891 to 1898 and from 1898 to the year 2000 before they got an acceptable bill i That might suit their grandchildren, but they wanted to have a little of federation for themselves (Enthusiastic cheers ) Even Mr Reid admitted that the bill was a good as a convention elected as the late Convention was-and such a convention must be elected under equal representation could give them (Applause ) Queensland was with us The Australian natives were taking the matter up in earnest. that day he had received a telegram from a friend there saying, " Queensland is with jon Win, and we will set the heather on fire " (Great enthusiasm ) The " Brisbane Courier " also said that Queensland would join, and that a " united Austritt i would confront the world " (Renewed applause ) Then let them give three cheers for Queensland (Loud and continuous cheering ). When was the time to federate of (One of New ") let them federate now, and not delay and thus lose their natural ally (Cheers ) There were also reasons outside Australia which to all who had the blood of Britons in them and the sense of Saxons (applause) made it necessary that we should federate He alluded to affairs in the old country If our England calleth to us, when her hour is come upon When the trumpets of the winds of war are blown, Ours the shame of open shame and ours the crown of all dishonour. If we stand not man by man to guard our own ' Sons of one imperial mother, vainly must that mother call If division rules where unity should be , ,,...," Clasping bands together firmly, lest a shameful fate befell Rue, a great united nation, strong and 'free 1 (Applause ) In co_c.iu.9-i as asked them on June 3 not to give a vote which would hereafter cause them to hang their heads with shame, hut to give a vote which would be a cause of pride to themselves and also their BOUS. (Enthusiastic and prolonged cheers.) Mr. Barton invited a test vote as to federation under the hill. With the exception of at most a dozen all hands were raised in favour of the motion affirming the acceptability of the measure. Mr. Bruce Smith warned the electors against the tricks of the opponents of the bill He said that a careful study of the speeches delivered on the subject from the inception of the campaign would disclose that those in opposition to the bill were specious, devoid of argument, and mostly a tissue of base misrepresentation. On the other hand, the federalists hail piled up a mass of facts, and had carefully refrained from adopting any reprehensible tactics in order to snatch votes (Hear, hear.) On the motion of Mr. Barton, a vote of thanks was accorded to the chairman in response to a call for cheers for the Australian Constitution, the audience rose and cheered vociferously. Next hearty cheers were given for the Queen, another salvo went up for Mr. Barton, and still another for the federal flag. _
