As the VJotoiian Government have to fit their new Railway boss into the salary of £2000 per annum tbejr will not ba handicapped by having a grent crowd of compe tent applicants to choose from, American and r English experts would tarn (heir* nose ap at the in dignity of a paltry twa thou. Mr. Fehon would hardly care (o accept tho position, for as third commis sioner of the New South Wales railways he dnws £1500, and has ?rv^i vut? i cofjuu^jiuiiiby ui ^auisryiuK the irreconoilihle Victorian political ring. Also, Fehon is not pos sessed of a foot that can be pluuted down with firmuess when occasion demands.

Mr. Speight is nor, likely ♦o have the ghost of a chance, for the Age party is bitterly antago nistic. Further, Mr. Speight maintaius that his method of con ductiug the business and making things hum by large expenditure was absolutely (he best for the colony, and declares that he would again work on similnr lines, des pite hai'd time* and the era of re tienchtnent.
