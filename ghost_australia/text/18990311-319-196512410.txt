Certainly the room looked inbst-imliiwyerllkc. It was session time; too; and he wished he had been, caught reading soiiie.iaw. book, or . at lensV the "Times," Instead of that condemning yetio.w' boarded novel. : "I beg -pardon for intruding," said the man. "Jly nnine Is Craig,' and I come', on behalf of Jlr. Dallas." ' "Oh," replied Tom, relieved, yet disap pointed; It \y"ns only a message, .not a brief. "I'ray take a seat." . ' : "It- lias not been a case of .early 'to bed, anil early to rise," ronmrked Craig, ,3vug-' glng his head nui looking at the table. . ' ;. "We'lawj-ers have. somctlines to h"ecp' late hours," and then, catching a smile on Craig's face, Tom added with a. tough, "Fact' is,- 1 was "at n call dinner, -and- I am afraid we kept It up rather late." ; "Or rnflier early, w|is it not?'.' "Well, It wns after 2." .1 "In that case, you will have no difficulty In proving where you ivere." .' ; "I beg your pardon!" cried Tom, sitting up and speaking sharply. "01». that's iu right. : You see I bni a detective- :' "What?" . ' ; ,r: ; "Just so. It- .isn't' In the. papers, and I see' you have not heard pf It,, I am sorry to have to Inform j-ou'j that .your, uncle, Mr. Dallas, -was- murdered"; somewhere' between 3- and 2 thlg morning." ' . "Jluidcred!" The ' biood left Tom's cheeks, nnd he stared at Craig The detective told hjs story quickly aVid buceluetlj'. Wlint he wanted was to get in formation, not to give It. ; "This- morning, at a . quarter! to two or thereabouts, policeman on the beat in Tblstlcdown-road, Claplium, found the street. door of Mr. Dallas's house standing open. Ilnng the bell nnd roused out of her bed the old woman; mime of Sarah' Mundy who does for Mr. Dallas. She couldn't tell how the door eaiiie to be open.'

Tom sat thinking for a little and then said— "Of course, 1 will give a reward for the discovery of the murderer." .' Craig bowed. '. "The amount" will he—," and he scrib bled some figures on a piece of paper and threw It over the table. Craig's eyes glistened as he saw the sum/' . "I'll do everything that mortal man can do; but tue Scotland Yurd peopiu swallow up so much of 'these rewards." ' ' \- "Scotland Yard "won'Mkhow ' 'anj-tblng about' It," said Tom.'
