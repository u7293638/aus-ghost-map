COBBESEONDENCE, To the EJiloi of the Chronicle. Sir, — As we see that you permit ' Inhabitants' of localities to address you collcctively, will you allow us the same favour, especially as we feel that ours has been misrepresented by your cor respondent who most unwarrantably takes the name of our town with much vanity in vain. We beg to say that we do place the greatest confidence in the Ghost of Ban Ban. We regard his voice as our only monitor since we have lost our earliest and best friends, and we ardently hope that he will long watch over our interests and castigate those who give us bad advice and set bad examples. In the language of parliamentary men we are 'free to confess' that your ' (nystcriuua' cor respondent has worked a great change 'already ; and though sums of us don't agree with -his political observations, we must acknowledge that we can't gainsay them —but who can gainsay a ' Ghost,' Mr. Editor? We are, THE INHABITANTS OF GAYNDAH. 23rd September.
