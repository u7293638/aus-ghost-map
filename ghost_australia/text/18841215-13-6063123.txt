ABOVE THE SPEAKER. " TlmoUiius played on high Two pale faces were to be seen at the bar of the Council on 1 rule) afternoon, in marked contrast to the guy surroundings These was visages were those of the Premier and the Chief Secretary, for whom the strain of the last day a of the session had been too much. A proverb declares that "Youth is more precious than rubies,' but in politics it is experience that tells At the same time, when a pinch tonics, the discovery is apt to be made that the verdict must be dealt with tenderly and handled with a moderate degree of care An at tempt made at one per md of the station by Ministers to indulge in late sittings to go to bed at 4 o'clock and to be in the departments at 10-head to be precipitately abandoned as likely to be profitable only to the undertaken and the writers of obituary notices, and any observer of the pageant in the Council could till he the last few days find adversely affected the coalition chiefs But now they can retreat Hobart and bom ino, and tan till the story of the campaign over walnuts and wine They can attain how Messrs Mirams and M L Smith made a splash at the beginning and Mink into his gin licence at the end, how Messrs (John son, Mackay, and latins, after making a bold show us obst tuants, retired into comparative silence and they can dwell upon the brilliant initial debate, and weigh the solid mass of legislation After earth with session as the last, the natural refrain is that of Poe's Raven "Never- more The week was exciting to the last, for there were grave doubts w better there would not be trouble between the two Houses Some of the Council s amendments in the Land Bill had not a chance in the Assembly, and the Government majorities were only one and two-so narrow, as time after time to bring the heart to the mouth As both sides six equal on one of the occasions, the burly) form of Dr Tierney was seen making eager efforts to reach the bar before the usher executed the order to "lock the doors " Inspired by the cries of the "Ages," the North Yarra senator, without exactly attaining the speed of a greyhound, made the best time on his personal record, and saved the session with note second to spare. When the click" of the lock Bounded, he was on the right side of the barrier, and that was all He was rubicund, but he had crossed the Rubicon As he sank into the seat breathless but triumphant, Mr. Campbell and Colonel Sargood and the applause for the feat "And e'en the ranks of Tuscany Could scarce forbear to cheer " Apprehensions were still more lively when the Railway Bill was under discussion There were few members of the Lower House present the evening when the Assemblj'sfiist compromise was rejected and these gentlemen whether) taken aback The features of iii (allies who was in attendance ( e others, gave a lively idea of astonish- ment 'the artist who wished to come the idea of one indulging involuntarily in the long low w Instit' of incredulity and surprise, would give any thing to catch such an expression And Mr. Nimmo, on his return to the Chamber, informed his fellow members that he had listened with horror to BentmientB more and radical than ever he had heard in the Council " in its worst days " And certainly his eyebrows and his forehead had gone up and down at intervals like unto the crest of an alarmed cockatoo. It was near midnight on 'J nesday when the rejection occured. Some Ministers, including Mr. Berry, had gone home A hurried Cabinet Council was held without them, and the resolution was taken to carry) a second compromise in the Assembly that evening This nerve and quickness were required, for a 24 hours' delay) might have seen the birth of a cabul Next evening members of the Lower House were twice as numerous in the Council chamber us in their own, for though it was known that the second compromise would be accepted, and that the "privilege" issue was disposed of, yet there was a fear that the Dunkeld line would be lost, and in this matter the Assembly had burned its boats When the division bell rang, the press, the Assembly members, the conceives the Houses, and every disengaged being about the edifice formed a more eager and expectant audience than the Council has witnessed since the reform crisis days And again, one vote, and one vote only), removed the difficulty Jtwus too near a thing to be pleasant No one has a clearer grasp of these matters than Mr Lalor, and half an hour afterwards lit putthecase in a nutshell. Last session he ruled the Dog Bill into temporary oblivion, because the Council had imposed lines and fees and penalties Mr (Jamison, in glee, rose to point out that in amending the Rabbit Bill the Council had imposed a heavy penalty "It is," said Mr Lalor, "too late in the session for these things " This is an admirable and truly constitutional rule As for the C) mes who object that it is not to be found in May, the rep!) is, so much the worse for that authority 'The "privilege" block once removed, the rush of business between the two Houses was prodigious Up to 9 o'clock on Wednesday there was nothing but talk on the disputed point, and all arrangements about other measures had to be effected afterwards Midnight saw Mr Derham waiting to sister tain if his Agricultural Colleges Bill would be put through all its stages, though no Council member had seen it, and the town clerk and Mr Zox in the same anxiety about their bill appropriating the Creswick Disaster Fund 'The Council was willing, though these were entirely new measures The finishing touches had also to be put to a dozen others, and it is when amendments are made that the uns takes, the collisions, and the confusion occur.
