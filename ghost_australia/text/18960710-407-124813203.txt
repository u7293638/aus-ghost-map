NOT DEAD YET. TO THE KDITOlt. Sirâ€”About twelve months ago I came to South Australia a stranger, and on making enquiries about the democratic journals published here, I was told by many so-called reformers that there was only one working man's paper in existence, and that was languishing and could not live much longer. But that confoundedly contrary paper did not die, and then I was assured that it would be "as dead as a door nail" a month after the elections. But the elections have come and gone more than a month, and The Weekly Herald is stronger than ever, and instead of giving up the ghost it lias taken " a new lease of life." Well done ! Harold men. That's the way to disappoint the croakers and encourage your supporters. Allow me to congratulate the management oil last week's marked improvement, and at the same time express a fervent and heart felt wish that increasing success and ever growing popularity will mark the never ending lifetime of the people's champion. Workers, let us one and all rally round it, and make and keep it all that every wise mail and true woman desires. I am, Sir, &cM; COSMOPOLITAN.
