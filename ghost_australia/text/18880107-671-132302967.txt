At mid night a few fooblo efforts, rathor lacking in heartinoss, in tho way of spasmodic horns and short-lived bonfires intimated that tho groat Centonial Yoar had begun to any who wero wido awako enough to feel in toroetod in tho subject. What might have proved a littlo bit of oxcitomont about 2 a.m. on Sunday was nipped in the bud by tho watchfulness of tho police. Tho two rival corps of larrikins who divido tho borough bo weon thorn wero 'spoiling for a fight,' and tho customary preliminaries of insult and provocationliaving beon arranged, oneorowd wero rushing ap Mullens-street to storm tlio position of tho enomy posted in forco on Bcattio-street, when they wore checkod by a Hank movomont of an unoxpoctod do taehment of two stalwart constablos who had boon watching proceedings from a sheltered cornor, who trippod up a couplo, over whom fell about a dozeu who wpro rushing to tho charge, and in tho confusion resulting from tho disoutanglomont of tho resulting chaos of larrikin arms, logs, &c;â€ž tho would bo contending forcos molted away liko ghosts at dawn, and peaco roignod sorono for the rest of tho night, only disturbod by tho siege and sack of a noted pio-shop in central Balmain, about ?1 a.m, by a scouting party, who woro soon dissolved by tho opportuno appoaranco of tho boys in blue.
