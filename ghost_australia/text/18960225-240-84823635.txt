OUR DEPTFOD?I LETTER. (PnwO OUr OWN CORBnEOP?DExT.) Saturday, Feb. 22. After a spasmodic birth in June last, our local cricket club lingered in a half comatose condition till this week, when, just as it was expected to give up the ghost, our present state school teacher, Mr H. Atkin, restored it to active vigorous life. At a single meeting sub scriptions were raised, cricketing material was ordered from Bairnsdale, and has been already delivered here, while a wicket has been prepared in Mr T. Houghton's paddock, where practice will begin at once for a match against the Waterhole club, which gave a very pleasant hall yesterday, which was well attended, many going to it from here. I hope it will prove as successfully pecu niarily as it did socially. Two fresh reefs, very promising in their prospects, have recently been found here, one on Watcrhole Creek and the other between the old Tambo reef and the river. There will be more finds in this neighbour hood before long, or I am much mistaken, as prospectors are busy in all directions. The thermometer on the 18th and 19th stood at 100 deg in the schoolhouse-a wretched place to pack children into in such weather. The omission of Deptford as a polling place Is a serious blunder, particularly as a returning ofiicer for this place was ap. pointed more than a week ago. Perhaps the mistake will be rectified in time to prevent the virtual disfranchisement of a large number of bona fide miners.
