(Hear, hear ) THE AGENT GENERAL SHIP. RETIREMENT OF USING HERBERT. The PREMIER said Before the Orders of the Day were called on he had to make a statement which seemed to be called for by reason of certain rumours in circulation with respect to the Agent-General He regretted to say that he had received a cable gram from Sir Robert Herbert which seemed to indicate the probability of his retiring from October 1 next. The cablegram was received in a somewhat mutilated form In it Sir Robert Herbert said state of health retaining appointment of Agent-General after October 1. Please apologise , Andrew Clark willing to afford assistance in July " He meant Sir Andrew Clark It had been known for some time that the health of the Agent-General had not been such as his friends desired, and that he had for some time per for mud the duties of his office with that ability which distinguishes him, very much more from a love of the work and anything that connected him with the colonies, rather than for any other reason, and at some great personal sacrifice to himself Sir Robert Herbert's services were so exceedingly valuable to the colony that he had yet hopes that Sir Robert's health would so improve as to permit of his changing his mind on the subject, and that he would continue to act after October next Therefore, at the present moment it could not be said that anything definite could be settled or would be settled until a letter had been received from Sir Robert Herbert (who stated that he was writing by the mail leaving on the same day as the cablegram was despatched), and he had discussed the matter with his colleagues.
