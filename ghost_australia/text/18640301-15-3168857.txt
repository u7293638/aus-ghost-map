CLOSING OF THE PRESENT BURIAL GROUND. (To the Editor of the Courier.) Sir.- I will take the liberty of pointing out to the Government who have, as I under- stand the above subject under their considera- tion, one matter at least that ought to be attended to, and one which it is to be hoped they have the power to deal with. At present it appears there is no rule in force as to the depth the graves should be dug in either of the grounds, and the conse- quence is that some graves are barely opened sufficiently to cover the coffins, and others are not sunk deeper than from four to five feet. This is a matter tbat ought undoubtedly to be attended to at once. On the general subject of closing the grounds, there cannot be a doubt that it could be a wise course to close them, although I am not one of those who expect an epidemic to break out speedily if such is not done. The numerous population that is settling around them makes it have an ugly appear- ance. I find we are not alone in this matter, as an application has been made to close one of the cemeteries near Sydney on similar grounds. If the matter ls not dealt with by the Exe- cutive before Parliament meets, I would sug- gest that one of the City members move for a Committee of Enquiry into the matter, when we shall not be long left in doubt. Yours truly, GHOST.
