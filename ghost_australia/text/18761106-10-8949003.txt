SUNDAY LECTURES. DAVEY-STREET CHURCH. " Man's Spiritual History and Destiny." The thirteenth lecture of this course was delivered last evening in the Congregational Church, Davey street, by the Rev. B Stafford Bird The consideration of the subject of the previous Sunday's lecture, " the future state of the wicked," was concluded The lecturer said he had first to speak of the purpose of punishment in the future state, and to consider whether it is intended to be, or can be at all effectual in leading to the reformation and restoration of the lost He said it was unquestionable that all punishment, in any world, was retributive, and also intended to convey a lesson of the evil of sin, both to the sufferer and to those who see his sufferings But be and this, he had no doubt that, whenever, wheresoever, or how soever divine punishment is inflicted on man, it is intended to have educational, disciplinary, reformatory effects on the sufferer, Whatever the issue may be, he could not doubt that, as God chastises man in this world for his profit, that he may be made partaker of God's holiness (Heb 11, 10), no will He who changes not chastise the sinner in the next world with the same blessed purpose In any ruling this, Mr Bird said that he altogether repudiated the notion that the sinner expiated his crime against God by his punishments The sinner never can do that He can never become entitled to heaven by paying the full penalty of Bin Whoever shall outer heaven at length shall enter, not by personal right, but by God's grace But he believed that the punishments in the future state, as in this, are meant to be corrective in their object, leading the Brunei to turn in penitence to God So long as the supper remains impenitent, the wrath of God must and will abide upon him, but whenever, through any ministry, he learns to his evil, and becomes a humble suppliant for the Divine mercy, then the wrath of God will abide on him no more But if the sinner will not, 01 cannot be brought to penitence 111 the future state, that the wrath of God will remain upon him as long as he lives Mr Bud proceeded to point out that our knowledge that the essential nature of God is love, leads 11s to and justifies the belief that He will punish the sinful wherever they are with a loving purpose of effecting their improvement, and that he will continue to punish them until his loving purpose is accomplished It is not true love, either in God or man, that withholds the rod of perfection when it is needed to bring the offender to repentance and a better way It seems that God's love for the sinner will ever compel him to punish in order that He may save He turns man to destruction, as Moses m Psalm xc 3 teaches, that he may say to him, Return Men would go on shining for ever if she brought all sweets and no bitters The bitters are needful to create disgust at Bill, and to lead sinners, wherever they are, to long for and seek to enter a better and holier way It was the bitter fruit of the prodigal a star that brought him to his right mind, and drove a him back to his father's house again And if sin's sore penalties drove one such v. an- dearer home, may they not also drive all It seemed, Mr Bird said, both reasonable and scriptural to believe that God's love 0 for the sinner, and His un changing desire for long salvation, will impel Innig as the ages go to nap harsher and any) hapless measures, are more gentle ministries fail, to that He may at length effect His blessed purpose of subduing and reconciling all His rebellious children to Himself Tearful and the punishments of Bin often are in this life, we may be sure that God has never punishments in store in the future state for those who will ppt be let) to repentance here either by God's goodness or by His seventy Mr Bird thought that all scriptural views and all our most exalted conceptions of God's nature and character would lead us to believe that He, whose love for sinners urges Him to set and keep in motion numerous ministries for the recovery of the loss up to the very last hour of their life on earth, will be impelled by His unchanging love to use means to seek and save the lost so long as there is a lost qup any way era or any ed yet said the lecturer, there are many who tell PS, With all the assurance of conscious infallibility, that God cesses to be merciful towards every Sinner, and discontinues nil effort for his good, from the moment the breath has left his body ' Wbb that, then, the Christian's beat hope for his perishing brethren, that they will be delivered into the hands of an unmerciful God Will God really cast them off forever? Will He in anger shut up all Ula tender mercies ? Will He then PMpMi in revenge and no more in order to save? Will His fat|u3|)y permits and all in a moment when His sinning child goeth beppo J 'r|l0 Psalmist (Psalm lxxv ii, 7 10) tolls do that such thoughts had been his infirmity ), and certainly, the lecturer said, they appeared to be the infirmity of very many to-day for himself, he said, he hoped he had read his bible to some purpose, but it did not teach him such view as the one The man or the woman who would not at any time joyfully and heartily welcome back with forgiveness a penitent erring child) would be unworthy of the name of parent tax can Goif 66 JeijB father / than nJhii a With His infinite compassion fail so that he shall say with petulance, ' Because you have 0 so long delayed your coming, I will not rpppjvo you now, though you he truly penitent?" Is such the action of the God whose nature and whose name is Love But not to speak of God's love alone, Mr Bird reminded his hearers s that God's character for justice, < c , righteousness, afforded an assurance that what ever He does with the sinner in the next life, will be done up ortjpp fp his reformation He could not see now a righteous God count be content unless Ho IS over uSing means to make the week end righteous, and it seemed to him that a righteous God will only be too glad, when at any time a sinner penitently turns from am and seeks the mercy of the one God endeavour £0, bp pn|nerç;ful (S to be unjust, and that pi what God can never be paid over the whole human family so that he made, provision for the redemption of them all, and Mrs might be sure that He whose doors! and it is that almshouse be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, w ill leave none, anywhere, without the needful minis trios for imparting the knowledge and leading to salvation There are many, Mr Bird next said, who tell, us that if the Firmer does not yield to God durang on probation ho 11 not lie; I am j part injuring another But he could see he force Sn fled objection For just as God b ministries during the second forty years of a man's life may, and often do, elliot what Bia industries during the first forty years failed to (do , 60 there is no reason, that the lecturer could see, for doubting that during thpBcuond hundred, or 1910 seeond'lliduaaiid year of a man's co distance, God may employ lninisrYio for His salvation more effectually, than duringthcfiist hundred or thousand vista of tip life If all the.usjbtieu of this 2093 failed to lead the Banner to righteousness, may it not I so that the inmates of the next world the loss of the pleasures which made him content with her I sinful life, the severe tortures that belong to that State, and all that can in hell make a man feel what a terrible thing sin it, will result in leading him at length to long for the holder character and life which he never longed for strove after while on earth ? But the lecturer said, many will most naturally ask on hearing all this, are we not told that the punishment of the wicked is eternal, and that in hell their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched ? He would have to speak more fully of these and kindred scriptures in the next lecture, but a passing word about them was necessary in this. What our Lord meant by the Greek words which in our English Testament are rendered " everlasting punish- ment," Mr. Bird hoped and thought he did most profoundly believe ; but, he said, what many understand by the words is quite another matter. The idea of endlessness does not necessarily belong to the word rendered everlasting." There are, no doubt, many passages in Scripture in which the word occurs where the idea of endlessness is properly attached to it, but there are also other in stances of its case in which it cannot possibly mean endless. We must not, therefore, forcibly attach this meaning to the word here, so as to make it teach that some sinners never shall be saved, in the face of such a declaration as that of Paul in Rom. v. 10, that all sinners " shall be made righteous." If, instead of reading, " These shall go away into everlasting punishment," we read, "These shall go away to endure the corrective chastisement inflicted in the coming age, we shall have, not an exact literal rendering of the original certainly, but a faithful paraphrase of the sense which, Mr. Bird believed, our Lord intended to convey. Moreover, the lecturer said, it should be remembered that the time of which it is said " These shall go away into eternal punishment," is not at the moment of the sin- ner's departure from the body, but of that still far future day, when all nations shall be gathered together to judgment ; so that even these words, with the extreme interpretation which is so commonly attached to them, do not disprove the possibility of repentance and salvation between the day of death and the great Day of Judgment. And as to the other passage in which the mention of the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is never quenched, is supposed to prove the uselessness of the sinner's future punishment, Mr. Birdwouldonlyinthislecture say that it appeared to him, to say the very least, unwise to build a doctrine of endless torment for the wicked on words as figurative as these very clearly are while there are numerous passages where, in language plain and configuration, a very different and more hopeful doctrine is declared. Referring next to that passage (Matthew, xii., 30, 32,) wherein a certain she is excepted which hath never forgiveness, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come, it appears clearly to be implied, that there are some sins which may be forgiven in the age to come. And if those words about being kept in the prison till the uttermost farthing is paid, refer, at many think they do, to the confinement of wicked human spirits in the prison house of Satan, they clearly imply the possibility of release when the lost farthing is paid. The only payment, the list farthing that God over does ask of the sinner, in order to his being set free to enjoy the liberty of the children of God, is that he yield himself heart and soul, in entire trust and loving submission to God the Saviour. Whenever that is paid, even if it be after a thousand or ten thousand years imprisonment, he who pays it shall be set free. But never, never can the lost soul be free from the torturing pains of a guilty conscience, until it is brought to render a willing and cheerful submission to God. In conclusion, Mr. Bird urged his hearers as to live while here, that they may never go into that region where the ghosts of their old and long-forgotten sins will be their terrible companions, reminding them, by thrusting their grim forms before their gaze, that their sins have all found them out at last That dreadful fate might be avoided, the lecturer said, by leaving all the sins now with Christ the same bearer, who would carry them away and bury them where they could rise no more to torture the soul through all the ages of ages of his life among the redeemed. " Agree with him, the Saviour, quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him, lost at any time He become thy judge, and deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into the prison house of disobedient spirits. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou but paid the uttermost farthing." The next lecture of the course, the subject being " The final destiny of the human race," will be delivered next Sunday evening.
