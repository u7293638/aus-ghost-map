ERIN-GO-BRAGH! Recent Ireland v. Scotland athletic meeting at Dublin was a big take down for Sandy, who was beaten in nine events out of eleven* including even the Caledonian specialities of hammer-throwing and weight-putting. Write Ichabod! also Erin-go- Bragb, begorrah % Acushla machree! and other things of that sort, whatever they may mean, for Sandy is a de cadent race—their glory has departed. Their backs are weak through picking up the 'siller,' ye ken. Their 'airms' —that is how they spell it in Haggis land—are atrophied through driving quills instead of ploughs; their legs, once bare to 'a' the airts that biaw,' are covered by unseemly breeks or trews : and their manly strength all gone down before the Southern Celt. Ossian arise, and lam nt in long, loud poetic verse the fall of the glorious men of old ! Gather the ghosts of the clans in the glens * and send them to chide the tardy spirits of the modern. Scot! Pass round the haggis and the bagpipe ! Ye'll be your pint stoup, and here's mine— Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled, Rise oot your graves, your glory's fled, The shamrock blooms, the thistle's dead— Begorrah ! Ye banks and braes o' Bonnie Doon, Ye ilka birds, your sang Is dune, The stane is put, the hammer throon—> Be jabers! Ae fond kiss and then we sever; Pat's fut is on oor native heather! Farewell, our cake is dpugh for ever— Acushla! -Glare s Weekly. ^ When remitting small amounts. Penny Stamps should be sent where Postal Notes are not obtainable.
