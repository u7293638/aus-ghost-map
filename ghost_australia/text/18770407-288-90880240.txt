AFFAIRS IN FRANCE. FFrom our own Correspondent.'} Paris, February 17. No one in this country attaches the ' slightest importance, still less gives tke smallest attention, to the reported Or leanist conspiracy to overthrow the Re public, and, selecting the Due d'Aumale f or General Monck, to seat his nephew, the* Comte de Paris, on the throne. German canards — f or the story comes from Vater land — is as unsuccessful as German wifv The Orleanists are an unpopular party in France; they are the models of irresolution. They -would faint at the idea of organising a coup d' dot. Were it possible to over throw the Republic by a lobby intrigue, or a par liamentary coalition, or by a Guizot system of bribery, or a De Broghe respect for con-T stitutional liberty, or a Buffet execution of the law, they -would engage in the venture in the twinkling of an eye. They aref political Christopher Slys, who in politics] can throw pebbles on the rails ; but to resort to violence — that programme is the mo nopoly of the Bonapartists. The fact is, there are no conspiracies in. France ; the Republic is now being re spectably and honorably administered, and ' the head of the Cabinet, Jules Simon, is compelling the extreme parties to obey the institutions of the country. The Boni partistshave even ceased to be boisterous,., and employ no other -weapon against the ' Republic but bad names. Words break no bones. In proportion as the Ministry , displays the courage to promote and de- ? fend its Republican programme; to act fairly and liberally towards all men; to assure the gopd,:ancL to tWarnj the oad, so : does the Constitution jjecome' acceptable, r '?-. as a matter of course, by the nation. -i~\ It is difficult to muzzle a free press. - It -f- ? is no_ easy matter to jsilenee in i?rance an obnoxious writer.

Athenian Republic — -E' Jinita la miisica. The best means' to silence Rochef ort is to not dignify his speculation with a prosecu* tion, and to pardonall the penitent dupes of ^ the Commune. A vessel is now being fitted out to bring back itor France from. New Caledonia nearly 200 Communists for given by the country. At the same time the remains of the police massacred in the Haxo Rue have been exhumed, and placed under a fitting monument in the Metro politan Cemetery. ' The Carnival ended on Ash Wednesday morning, -when according to custom, masks and costumes ought to be buried before sunrise, and the Sons of Folly to clothe themselves in sackcloth and to com mence mortification by breakfasting on salt cod.. During -the three- days that people ?were free to do nearly as they pleased, so far as making fools of themselves, only^ 760 drunkards were arrested. The figures^ ^ are not high for a capital' of nearly two millions, and when it is known what asmall quantity of alcohol steals .away a French- - man's brains. -In his case the firewater preferred is; absinthe, which is the most ter rible and abject of intoxicating drinks, 4iie* principal; ^ instigatox; r^of suicides, but — -£ strange, .. net of other -crimes.

It is'difficult to estimate^ J ^ ^ man gravely who-at 83 'diesses like a cos* * comb in his teens;- The- deceased was the incarnation, , of military and political vanity. He was a .capital smTmifib. ing officer inr. Algeria, by maMng r^Y brilliantrdastes. .at the Arabs, but as tot other capacity he had. none, His services were utilised at ' Metz' to negotiate the capitulation. In 1848 ^e solicited a com mand to defend the, Hepublic, as ' he was ccustoined' to : conquer.' It would, be charitable to draw. a veil over his political antecedents. He was everytibing by turns, and of . late w^asrdistan^uisned by his fierce hate against the Republic. He was the chief 'puppet in every intrigue against the present Constitution. He labored to bring back the Comte de -3hambord- the Comte de Paris, the Prince Imperial, rather than bow to the nation's will. like Erasmus, he is reported ^o have had u& Oatholie soul and a Lutheran stomach?' He was the most intimate and oldest friend of the Rothschild's, and it is the lady head of that family who has taken charge of the burial of the old bachelor. His bed was a truly military one, : in Iron, narrowy and the mattress was ever composed of rye straw, while his room was simply a military tent ; he had his uniform ever ready, as if expecting at any moment to enter on duty. He had the, honor to be exiled after the toMp & dot, & crune he un consciously did so much with his royalist friends to promote. He was the life- long ---t friend of Thiersjand^when ite latter 'was, President expected to receive from lum the* ?^ fcaton of marsLal ; great was his disap pointment on being- refused, so lie turned liis arms against Thiers, was one of the three wko intrigued the latter's downfall, expecting to occupy his place, and could hardly believe his eyes when McMahon was selected. It was Changarnier's boast that he would bury the Republic, and now It is the Republic undertakes his obsequies. The French, were really pained at the prospect of Austria's refusal to officially take part in the Exhibition of 1878, the *v necessary funds haying been voted. The ostentation of the other kaiser creates neither surprise, and it may be added, nor regret. The works are progressing as satis factorily as could be desired, and not even the shadow of a shade of complaint has i-een heard respecting the gigantic organi sation. This happy result is due to the exclusion of all private influences, and hence of obstacles and wrongs. At present the visitor can not only take in an idea of the vastness of the undertaking, but also ^f what its many beauties must be. The result will prove that all has not been done in the matter of World's Fairs. It will not be the fault of the Bishops if jeligious peace cannot be maintained; they' seize every occasion to attack the represen tatives of Jay society, so that the breach between Catholicism and Liberalism is widening. The Republicans do not attack, they defend themselves. The Bishops on every possible occasion seek to vilify existing institutions; their pastorals are political jnanifestations. When ordered to pray for the Republic they did so, while denouncing It, and now in their Lenten charges, instead of confining themselves to the peculiar xegulations for passing the Forty Days, they ~ V*esume the role of politicians. Thus the Bishop of Angers declares ciyii marriage to be concubinage, and the children born of that union akin to bastards. He condemns also the law which directs that the children of a family should all enjoy the 'parents' property share and share alike. The Bishop of Rodez declares that the mission of the Church, is purely one of domination, to rule \ -over all peoples and all lands; while His ?Grace of Cambrai maintains that it is im possible to be a good Catholic unless one be an Ultramontane. In presence of these provocations the clergy has the presumption to complain that the people are falling away from religion. The contrary would seem to be true. The French people are, unhappily, commencing to see in priests not only political antago nists, but men without patriotism, ancLit requires no ghost to come from the grave to announce where the battle will finish, and how. The French Government in. Algeria has adopted an excellent reform. One of the great difficulties in administering' that Im portant colony arises from the civil em ployes being ignorant of idiomatic Arab. Henceforth an official's salary and promo tion will be regulated according to Ms proficiency in the local dialect. The sworn interpreters make awful blunders occa sionally. Before the Tribunal of Algiers one of these dragomen interpreted ' shoe maker' as ' locksmith.' It is a necessity to set an interpreter to catch an inter preter. Madame Piermarlni was engaged by M. Pasdeloup, the director of the popularcon ____^ certs, to sing at one of his entertainments. ^?fe Impatient to gain her place, she jumped ________»~acrcss the railing of the orchestra, slipped, ^^^ and broke her arm. She took an action for damages against Pasdeloup, who declined -?- the resj-onsibility, alleging he engaged Mdlle. to sing, and not to 'jump.' The court decided in his favor. The Tribunal has also disposed of a matter Interesting to advertisers and newspapers. A manufacturer of feeding bottles pub lished a puffiing advertisement; alleging that, by a decision of a court at Berlin, his feeding apparatus alone possessed a coveted excellence. 3So such judgment was ever Tendered, so other manufacturers held the journals responsible for aiding this disloyal competition. The French Tribunal ac corded nominal damages against the news papers, but ordered the advertising agent to pay them as well^as all expenses in curred. The complaining manufacturers can still pursue the agent for civil damages, if they caitdemonstrate having suffered any loss. A country gentleman came to Paris to witness the carnival, and entered into con versation with a stranger near the Jena .'Bridge; they became friends in a seeond, so much so that the stranger pointed to the gentleman's topcoat being soiled, and aided to take it off to be' brushed. While :in the attitude of waiting to put on the «oat again, the stranger bolted with it, and -the unfortunate gentleman in commencing io run after him was tripped up by a ready pal. The Prefect of Police has now organised a telegraphic portrait department. Sup posing your cashier to- decamp, an everyday occurrence in Paris, before balancing his J^ JCash, you have only to present Ms photo, at the detective department, and in ten mfintftes its copy will be in the hands pf the frontier authorities, sbthat the cashier on aiigiiting will enable the gendarme iq sofaloquise 'on this picture and on this.'

A few days ago he was going to Versailles, and in^thesame.cpmpartmentof the railway carriage were brother senators and a ^dy^th* an. Infant on her knees.
