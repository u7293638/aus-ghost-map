EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE. ANNUAL MEETINGS. FIRST DAY : MONDAY, MAY 17. The annual meetings in connection with the Evangelical Alliance were commenced in the Stow Lecture Hall on Monday evening, May 17. There was a large attendance, and on the plat- form were the President, the Bey. Junes Hen derson (Presbyterian), who ooonpled the chair, Keva. O. B. Symes, B.A. (CbngregationaUst), J. li. Parsons (Baptist), J. Lyall (Presbyterian), O. Linley (Methodist New Connexion). ?nd the ! Hon. Secretary, Bey. J. HoEwin (Oongrega- i tlonallst). | The proceedings oommenoed by ringing the hymn Come, thon fount of every blessing," •ad the offering of prayer br the Bar. Mr. Symes. ACTUAL BKFOKT. The Hon. Seomiabt then read Ids report, as follovra:— "The history of the Alliance daring the past year bat been somewhat eventful, and has been markad by wrenl features altogether new. Tnelast I AHHUAL MEEUBa was held In Plrie-atnet Leotnve flail on Uonday evening, the ISA of May last. The President, Riv. W*. P. Wells, occupied the chair, and delivered an address on the wants of the Church, which were characterised as grantor spirituality of mind, greater unity, greater Baal, greater enthusiasm for Christ, and above all a greater measure of the Holy Spirit's rnflnrnoe. After the reports for the year had been presented and the officer* and Committee appointed, the President - Blest, Bey. 3. Henderson, waslntrodneed to tie chair, and addresses ware given by the Her. O. B. Symes on Sabbath Observance, aad Eev. P. Maalaren on the Bevival In Edinburgh. On the Wednesday evening following the United Oommnnion Service was held in the Franklin street Methodist Church, and was largely at tended, Eeferenoe was made In last year's report to the ministerial prayer- meeting which was held on the last Monday of the month, bat which was langnlshtng greatly. At the dose of the annual meeting a few of the ministers waited to talk the matter over, and it ww determined to hold Instead a hoohd.it peaob smthho, which was at first intended to be monthly, but was almost immediately converted into a weekly meeting. Plrie-atraet laeoture Ball was kindly offend for the purpose, and with varying too. ce«s the meeting baa been continued through the year, except daring the extreme months of summer. The at.endanos, which Is growing, has not hitherto averaged man than 38, and it Is felt that there ought to be many times this number of Ohristisns in the oily able to spue one hour in the week from business to devote to prayer. A Hit of subjects for prayer has been prepared; ministers nave been appointed to oonduot the meetings; Mr. Sankey** hymns have been procured, aad a choir of young ladies organised to lead tile singing; and we appeal to Christians to give the meeting life and power by their presence. Another feature of interest in the put year is tee wm or BPMiaL anm js, which ware held in the Town Hall in September last. The Oity Council kindly reduce! the rent of the Ball to £10 for the five nights, which awn was paid by Mr. Georgs Fife Angas, who is always forward to help in every good work. Special hymns wan printed for the wnmHng.; two short, pointed addresses wan glren oaoh evening. AU the city and suburban ministers oordlaUy united in the services, the large building was well filled oaoh evening, and although no immediate malts wen rasped, yet it was felt that muoh good had been aeoom. pushed. It is probable that the earvieeswOl be repeated in a few months, when an effort will be made by the introduction of the enquiry meeting to bring to a deoMrwi at ones those open whom impressions may bs made. The' great event of the year to tne Christian world has been the extraordinary work of the American Evangelists, MBBBS. HOOSr AJTD EUnXT, in Britain-* work which seems a larger repeti tion of Penteoostal times. A suggestion was made that these brethren should be invited to visit Australia. Falling In with which your Committee forwarded to them by the Haroh mail a cordial and urgent request to thatefi dot. That request should nave reached its destina tion during last week: bat, as most of you an aware, Messrs. Moody and Sankey, In answer to a prior invitation from Victoria, bare already signUed that after their return from America, whither they will go for a short time after their •tay in London, they will probably visit Aus tralia. It is hoped that perhaps some time during next year we may expect, if Ood win, to welcome them to our shores. Inthemaantimr, however, the attention which has been drawn to the question of the revival of the Lord's work vow midst fats done good, and the Con ference to be lieM to-morrow is partly the result of this. In November last nutted prayer meetings wen held atmnttaneonsly in North and South Adelaide, and ware weH at tended. In February last the Alliance invited' thaOhumhes of Sooth Australiato observe Son day, 14th, as a dayof puMb thanksgiving to the Lord for tlte bountiful harvart. This invitation was very general]} compiled with, and «n the following Wednesday -evening united thanks giving servioes wen heldlnAddaldea&d; North Adelaide. The attention of year Oonunlttee having been oaUed to the abuse of the BTOHf PHUT HBXBX, they waited as a deputation upon the Chief Secretary to urge that a more stringent super vision should be exercised in this matter, and that the power to grant such permits should be confined to Felloe and Special Magistrates, who an to acme extent amnnaWe to Government authority. The deputation was courteously reoaivedby theOblef Soontery, who promised to use his Influence to carry out tha views of your Committee. "H the pastjyearhas been eventful, Tuocarasnt? willnrobably be moreeo. Wo meet in Oonfe reneeto-mcnTowtooonaldaraeriously the present low ooudltipn of rallrlanUtheoateny.andto ask what means can fie adopted to remedy this state of things. It will be the duty of the Committee to endeavor to carry out whatever resolutions may be arrived at, aad in —d"s*?g our trust into your hands wf.alaitn f«r our auooassors your sympathy, your prayers, and your practical support." if \- nHAsoeb , In the absence of the Treasurer (Hr. O. W. Ootton), Mr. Mo?wi? read his report, which showed that than was a balance due to him of £6135.2 d. r The Bar. Mr. Snout in moving the adoption of th« reports, referred to that of she Secre tary, whfah, he sag, was araonflngly wall put together, and ahdtred in many ways the effl deneyof that officer. This havingbeensesonded by Mt. GKOBtI HaSOl, was carried unani mously. omoz?a ahb ooiaana. The Best* Oleksbt lain than moved— "That the following gentiamen bo the afflcm and Committee for the ensuing year:—Presi dent, Be v. J. L. Parsons ; Hon.Beoretary.BeT. 3\. Ms?win; Treasurer. Mr. G.

Tub was aeaonded by Mr. Ba« \--■haw end carried, PlillWNT'a ADDBHS. The Bet. J. BnDiBSOH, the retiring Chair man, than delivered an address, for which wo arc quite unable to find room. It was of a very able character, and was listened to, as it de served to be, with the closest attention. The address reviswed the history of the Alliance during the part year, but it was occupied for thnmest part in dealing with the question of spiritual revivals, and with other matters that have lately claimed the attention of the red gious world. Baoh subject was handled in *> lucid and liberal manner. The address omasa" with those words—"We gratefully acknowledge the varied oppuitunittarit has afforded of meet, ingwtthfeethren, different, it may ha, in de nominational designation, but one in heart and sympathy and aim. How ddlghtfol to meet as brethren in Christ, tamest thus in -free and unfettered conference, to bow together at a throne of grace, to go forth in co-operation in works of beneficence. May tike union of heart and aim be rendered stronger and mom compre hensive during the year to come, and though as separata seats we may pitch our tents some what apart, as did the tribes of old, still, like them, may wa acs the pillar of cloud and fin as a glory in on midst, 'Speaking the truth in love' may we strive to 'keep the unity of tha spirit in the bond of peace. As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and many over upon all the Israel of God." (Applause.) He was exceedingly glad that the BVvTme, Paisons had been selected as President, and he had mush pleasure in n™?«n«i?g him aa the President of the Alliance for the ensuing year. (Applaue.) 7B* FBMswtst-xr,Tnr. Mr. Pabsohb, cm taking the chair, aald that oa accepting that position he made two stipu lations—one was that he should be allowed to retfae whan he dasfaad, and the -other that nothing should be expected of him in the way of speeches or addresses. He thought that it would be very frigid on his part it after re ceiving such a proof of the ornifldeuoe and esteem of his brethren, he ehould take the ehslr in unresponsive nlenoe. The position was in his view the most honorable tneOhumhes had at their disposal, aad he wished therefor* to express his deep sense of the regard and trustUs election implied, I wish also to say," he continued, "that it is peeailarfy gratifying to m> thU the closing months of my mbd ateriel life should present thus prommentiy that honest unity with all true Christians whloh throughout its course I have cherished andmsnUestod. The Christ in whom I have believed and believe, is one in whom no Ohuroh oanolalma monopoly, and the Gone} übJah X have aought to preach has been • Gorpcl which no denomination can cfaanmvallate with a creed or label with any special trad* marks, anil be- Have this to bathe true Christian temper and attitude. Wear, hear.) The Hew Testament in dseireoofnlsed so man as a Christian at all who is not full of love, humility, and tolaranee, and who does not consider others better than himself. But, though I mention this, Ido not think I am one whit in advance or one atom more ainoare than my brethren around me. Ho man, therefore, as I understand, may, because he holds certain views upon Church polity, or the p:oper tests of membership, or upon the mode or subjects of aa ordinance, may on either of these accounts' be shy of or much less wrangle with those who think differently, unless, indeed, he agrees with ! that sirange apologist for a testy and j quarrelsome spirit, wno boldly —< that without controversy great is the mystery of godliness, mwaning that only oontrovecsy could clear the mystery up. But the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, neither Is tt orders, or organisations, or ordinances; but it is righteousness -and peace, aad Joy in the Holy Ghost. Every Christian man is, in fact, the brother of every other Ohdstasa. One may pride himself upon a fanned auperiority in direct lineage and culture, and may even dis own the other; yet they an members of one family, children of one Father, brethren of one Saviour, aad though the proud and bigoted may soora and despise the humble and charitable, yet he cannot prevent these also from claiming to be of the asm* spiritual kith. And happy is he who meekly hem ditdidn and dlsownment, aad yet iiiiiswiiki that kinship which makes those who act against their spiritual nature brethren sUH, and'loves them notwithstanding. The imparfostlan of the human faoultlaa makes finality in know ledge impossible. And the history of Chris tlaniiy in the times of the Apostias, and in every century since, furnishes InwhissMs evidence that identity of opinion is not to be expected, evan if U be to be dednd. And when •reoonnAer how wide'y men differ upon tha meaning of words, upon the force of argu ments, and even upon what antarmadaaeer tsined facts, how vain an idea tatfemtty In nUgum beoomea, la political eeeuemy, in law, in philosophy, and in ■dense too wa ass mam of fatmast puipcae and sound judgment arrive at vary diffarent mrnsJailasii And whan, wa remember that the OhriUlaa tslth is based upon a Book which gives an ac count of the genesis of the material universe, and of the origin of life, which touches the pro foundast questions in metaahyales, which Is concerned with ail the complex rmaclous of praetioil otfales, which reveals how ssan fail from innoaenay, how ha ta to w* isAsced to Gad, and what he U to believe aad cV and which embraeas in Its scope tsuaoaMsagkwef the dose of Ufa hare, the dim region of Hades, and the condition of eternal «x&ano;?, wa osn only marvel that any man who knows man or any Church wMoh profanes to derive Ivauihc rity from the insptoed writings where thepoo aUillty of dlffersnee of opinion Is daari/n \--cognised, eheuld ever dream that ahsoluto idantityof belief is poadbla. Atheetwaonry ace the roueetionupona mirror dimly. At bast wa know only in part, and If any man think he knows anything, be knows nothing as ha ought to know. At best wa are to remember that Christ has other sheep which ara not of this or ofthatftMk. At bast wean commanded by the Great Head of the Ohuroh not to forbid any to call themselves His <nanplas,and to work for him, even though they do sot follow with the Apostles themaetvas. However Irmly say may be convinced the Church to whtfch'they belong is tha true repieeeatative of the ra?gloa of Jesus, yet if in other Ohurabss they see men lifted out of sensuality and Intomaaranee son irrottglousnes?, they ought to haDt&r; work m good. It b surely better that saenshouubs sober, honest,and Godfearing,howevarfaulty thslroreed may be deemed, and hoawiai trrs gular the order of the ministry they ateasd may b>«msldand, than that WaiiouloMvuE. or dishonest or woridUngs or intdafa. Tfce Maw Testament plainly taaahas that mam -sea to exercise the tight of private jadgmant. Bray man to be fully persuaded In iS own mind-he is to prove all things, and a* one Is to judge for another, for to Us ownatastsr ha stands or falls. And I tfamk tha gnat msaa of men an weary of the atrifa eTwerds, af bigotry, of intolerance, and of t—rf>— ltr tioos. They agree, and I afnewisfcthamla the main, with the elder Hood, who raemkad a aom>mlnded thaologiasl eritis of tfee daylw telling him:—"A man may cry 'OurOharoh,' •our Ohuroh.* at ovary word, wtth no man piety than other people." Aad thin adds— "A dawis not reckoned n roHglous bird be cause he keeps a-oawlng from ft ateapla." And tt is this eternal clamor of <>OutOamreh i our need, our orders," and the lasMssn aatd the unchristisnislng of otfaenwUah Hbagom, which gives at least a ahow of truth to that teniUeit of modem epigrams—"Oartsitaallf has failed; men must return to Christ. 1' White, however, I plead for the ballast and broadest tolaranee, I trust I ehaO not be numbered amont; tha apostias of the modem Diana of Doubt. Doubt, howevarahv cera, is a awnfi—lon of ignorsnaa, aad autrly doubt is not the ultimate devdopajan* of the human inteUeetorof the aoul «"i??-*r* by the Holy Ghost. The tilings that so* written wan written that we may knew, as* that wa soay doubt. And though then may bsadaU oious fasomatka in oeaing thapaSs of trutil throughamisty bass, yet the pUcria who has taken hb staff and act out antiuoaanh far certainty, wfll climb higher sod «rar higher wham the disturbing vapors He far Mew; aad will wait ani watch share till the aun has cleared them away, and the whole ermine of truth lies dear about him, with art a dead between. No couplet in the Bagttsh tongue has been ao perverted as that one wfcJeh «s? oftsa quoted^ to entsi tta pertent eaajsaHuadthe •'Then Mas more frith in honest asuht, Believe me, than la half the aMedt." It b as false to wrest that out of ttseSaaatim aad uas It as c complete axiom as Iris to asy toman, "Workout your own aaWawa," and not to add, "For It is God who MkSlnyou b?ti> to will and to do-al His jtH jftiwu I."

J. MoB win read the following paper on " THI WOIK IB IBKLABD AND HHGLAND. " In October bat, the evangelists orossed over from Scotland to Belfast, in Ireland, when they were meat warmly received, The largest Church in thii town waa capable of containing only 2,000. As open-air meeting, however, wm held every Saturday in the Botauie Garden, where 80,000 persons regularly assembled. At the eloae of their fi? weeks' labor in Belfast a meeting waa held exclusively for those who pro fessed to have found Christ daring this period Admission was by tloket, and not lest than 2,600 attended—truly a rich harvest. From Belfast the brethren went to Londonderry for a fortnight, and thencs to Dublin. Them the Exhibition Palace waa secured for the services, a building capable of seating 15.000 persons, the number present being estimated *>? some occa ■lons at 20,000. Mr. Moody said the Dublin •adtenoet were the largest he had ever addressed fa a buDding, although they are being equalled just now by tile London audiences. The visit to Dahlln lasted abant six weeks, and the number whe openly professed to tave found Christ during that dme was about 2,000. From Dublin M?ms. Moody and Sankey went to Manchester, as Ingbad, a city of about half a million inhabi taste. Active preparation had been made for their visit for some time previously in the sttane «t united Evaags?stic services and united d«fiy prayer. The service* «tn held in the nee Trade Hall, seating 6,000, in the Oxford Hall, •nd in various churches. One special feature in the work at Manchester wat the scheme'of house to house visitation. At the end of the first week, on Satnrdar evening, Deenaber 12. S.OOO Christians, ekkfly young men, assembled In the Oxford Hall to listen to an address from ■tr. Moody oa Christian work. At the dose Mr. Moody appealed to all who were willing to work for Jesus to stand up. Almost the entire body of young men sprang to their feet, and there and then a definite plan for a great Gospel attack upon the whole city of Manchester was agreed upon. An Ordnance map of the city wat cut into squares, each squire representing a district; and two «r thres youaz persons ■ffreed to carry the Gospel, in the Maps of a tnst or otherwise, to every bouse within that district. Before fee ■vangalisto left Man •beater a oolleotion was nude at Mr. Moody's Wggestlou for the pueposeof presenting a New- Tear's gift to every orphan la the city. One result of the work in Men«hesta was the new life imparted to the Toung Men's Christian Association, a building hitherto uted as a museum, having been purchased for Its use at a cost ef £30,009, a large portion of whleh was raised at once, £5,000 having been given by one tadMdaaL After a month spent here, during wbbh time it wm estimated that fully 3.000 wen breeght to a saving knowledge of the truth, fit**.

In regard to their methods of working it is their practice to insist that where ever they go there shall be much previous united prayer. Their meetings consist of a prayer meeting every day at noon, usually pre sided over by Mr. Moody. At these requests for prayer are presented. Opportunity is given for brief exhortation oi counsel or the detailing of experience. Twice a week, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Moody holds what are called Bible readings. Borne subject or doctrine is chosen and traced right through the Bible bom beginning to end. Two of these on the atoning blood and one on Heaven are referred to—one m having been ospedaUy enjoyed and blessei Ministers who heard these readlngsspeakof them in terms of the Tery highest appreciation. One said a reading he had heard wm m valuable m the addition of a goad book to his library. Another said, I came a hundred miles to hear this Bible-reading, and I would rather have given £100 than not hare heard it. The even ing meeting is usually held in the largest build ing that can be obtained, and It is at these that Mr. Moody excels; and when he hM produced an impression by his clear exposition of Gospel truth, Mr. Sankey deepens it by the singing of some appropriate hymn. This f«atar?of singing the Gospel v altogether new, and it b said that where Mr. Moody fails to impress by his preach log Mr. Banker succeeds by his singing. So earnest and genuine are the men that every one feels their power, and many who go to scoff re« sin to pray. At the close of the evening and the Sabbath service, meetings are held for enquirers. Mr. Moody compares the enquiry meeting to the fishermen draw ing in hU net t> see what he hM caught. He says:—^'lean do mere with a man in five minutes In the enquiry-room than I can in ap hour from the platform," There is no noise md excitement. It is said that when hundreds are present being conversed with by scores of workers you will hardly bear a voiae above a whisper. Minister* and Christians known to be wise and prudent are asked to help in the enquiry-room, and these unani mously testify to the worth of the institution. Other meetings are occasionally held —for women only, for young men, for osildren, for soldiers, and far young osnrerts. THI atfUf OEiUDHIOIBB OF VBM MOTEMST are—First, remarkable unity between different bodiesef Christians—the Evangelists «01 not go anywhere unless there is united eSort before hand ; and secondly, the absence of great excite ment—excitement of a eertaln character there It ef eoune, tat it b set noby and demonstra tive, but deep and subdued. One who bm bad opportunities ol observing aeelam that the only expression of feeling b an occasional sob. Another feature in tin movement b that itb the old Gospel that hM been preached, aad nothing else—nothing but man's ruin by atn and Us redemption by Okltst; but these great doctrines have been originally and forcibly stated, and eUnehed by a?t Illustrations. But after all, b not the old Gospel something which b not often heard by oven ear Ohurah-going people'? Tslmsge says to young preacher* :— ' If you want to give the people something; new, don't preach about development—that b worn out: don't preach about tile Darwinian theory or the origin of our race—that b hackneyed; but preach the old Gospel. Give the people repentance in the morning, and faith at night; and if you want a variety next Sunday, give them faith in the morning, and repentance at night.' Allow me mow to apeak briefly for a little about fBI 885.D1.18, One result of the movement has been, that Ohrbtbns hare been wonderfully stimulated to practical Christian work. Wherever Mr. Moody lasgona, he hM not only thought himself, but set others a working and left them working. A ministers from Bdinbargh was asked some time si tor the visit of tito B*augeHs-j, how the work was progresdng then, aid he replied, "It b only beginning."- BraageUstts aad benevolent -eff«fta.have been act agoing in every direction.

Another mstt'of these meetings has been that targe numbers of young men fcave offered them- Mrotformsfcterlalaaim&donwork.; Bsfore this revival there was a dearth of ■uoh.andnow there are maayhundreb saying 'Hen am I; send ma.'
