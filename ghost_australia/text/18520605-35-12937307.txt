The discovery of gold in Australia appears to have had a bene ftcml effect upon our insular neighbours, stimulating them to increased excitions in the developing the resources, both agricultural and mineral, of the colony. An increased amount of land is being brought under culti- vation, and active researches have been set on foot to discover beds of coal and copper ore, which have been crowned with considerable success. The Almanack notices the consecra- tion of the new Roman Catholic Church on Tnorndon Flat, which " will, whpn completed, bo one of the largest and finest edifices m this part of the¡world." Several other pubhcbuildings are in course of erection and enlargement at Wellington ; and a lighthouse was to be shortly erected. _ _ Erci.FsiMiicAL.- The Rev. E. B. Proctor, sent out by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as a missionary for the gold fields, has been appointed by the Bishop of Sydney to the Meroo district.
