We publish the following this week :— The stars that glitter in tbe vailt of night. The gentle dewdrops on tbe grassy plain ; The moon diffusing her nocturnal light, The valley, smiling with its ripening grain ; 7 he " birds, that up to heaven's gate ascend;" These we contemplate with a thrill of joy ; But should a ghost the graves dark prison rend, How would the phantom all such charms destroy. COSMOS. A little tale I tell to you About a ghost that once I knew, It was not grave, it was not gay. But still it seemed inclined to play. So watching at the garden gate I saw it glitter as of late, But now it went against the grain. To stand and shiver in the rain; But soon I found, beyond a doubt, Twas gentle Anna's evening out. JNO. G. S. BRUCE. 'Twas harvest time; the golden grain Did glitter bright across the plain, Beneath the moonbeams clear; Two lovers walking with delight Beheld a scarecrow and took fright, " A qhost' they screamed, " Oh dear." But farmer Hodge undid the gate. And let them in—for it was late— Then laughed at gentle Ann; He told her with a face most grave She must not faint, hut should be brave When out with her young man. B. S. S. Glitter will rhyme with bitter, grain with train; Gentle with mental, gate with fate and state; But should tbe ghont appear of one that's slain Fresh from the grave, by George I'd punch his pate.
