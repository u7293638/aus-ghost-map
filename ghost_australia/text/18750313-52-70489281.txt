A TEAGBDY OF THE SEA. Tho British ship Euxine, nouna from North Shields for Aden, was destroyed hy Uro in tho South Atlantic in Angus5 last. Tho-crew took to the boats, ?which soon separated from each other. The occupants of one boat loat all their provisions and water, and, after enduring the pangs of hun -.-«-rm, ger foi1 some time, drew lots to docide-which.o£ -,. them should be killed to preserve.the lives of his " companions. The lot fell upon an Italian sailor, who was killed and cub up. Only a fow hours afterwards the others were picked up by the Dutch . ship Java Packet. The Batavia MattdelsbUtd, of December 3, says: "For several days they had oaten nothing, and had endeavoured to quench, thirst by sea water, so that one of theai, wholly exhausted, strove to stab himself in despair. He was, however, restrained by the others, who proposed that, under the circumstances, it should be decided by lot which of tho six should be' tho first victim to save his comrades for awhile from death by hunger. In conformity with this plan, six piecos of wood of varying length were cut ; the mate held them in his hand, and each of the mun drew out one-he who drew the longest was to fall. Francis Shuius, an Italian, was the unfortunate whom the lot assigned for it. Meekly and without a murmur he submitted, and soon ho gave up the ghost under the knife of Ins hungry fellows. Some hours afterwards,' and when they had just commenced their horrid moal, a sail was sighted on the horizon, whither course was im mediately shaped. On the evening of tho samo day (August 31) the five rescued persons, com pletely exhausted, reached tho deck of the Java Packet. Captain Trapped and his subordinates immediately did nil they could by careful treat ment tQmàke the five unfortunates forgot as much as possible tho misery suffered. Their remaining comrades in the two other boats have, according to a Lloyd's telegram of to-day, arrived safe ab St. "Helena, without accident." ,
