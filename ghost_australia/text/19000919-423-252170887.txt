Baptismal Service On Sunday evening last the Rev. L. H. Field, pastor of the Orange Baptist Church, preached to a large audience on the subjcct of Christian baptism, setting forth the manner in which the ordinance, as instituted by Christ and practiced to-day by the Baptists, clearly symbolised the believer's death to the old life and resurrection to the new life as a servant of Jesus Christ. The preacher showed that the Scriptures were very definite as to the necessity of repentance before the administration of the rite of baptism. In proof of his position respecting the immersion of the candidate, he quoted from the writings of leading scholars connected with other churches to show that the true meaning of the word " baptise" was to immerse or dip in water. At the close of the sermon, the candidates—five in number —whose ages ranged from 15 to 65, rose and, having acknowledged before the congregation that they had repented and were trusting in Christ as their Saviour, they went down into the water and were baptised in the name of the Father,'the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
