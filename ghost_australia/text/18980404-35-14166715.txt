LATIN GHOST STORIES. I Ninety-nine ghost stones out of every hundred, whether Beta voluptuous cause, or put forth with more serious intent, are so evidently composed by the aid of cliches tint, whatsoever may have been the man of the narrators, the narratives all on courage scepticism And the sceptic is compelled to regret (says the " Pall Mall Gazette ") that the purveyors of these commodities, if they must offer perpetual rechauffes of preternatural " Joo Minors," do not go a little further afield for Something to imitate Have they never opened "Sancti Grcgoni Magni Dialogorum Lihri Quatuor?" Have they never heard of John Ryder? Or does no one can read the parchment bound duodecimo that issued from the presses of the sixteenth and sev enteritis centuries ' There are tales in those works which prove all the best ghost stones to be of a venerable antiquity, -while for an ingenious combination of the materialistic with the supernatural the moderns come far behind their Latin predecessors To begin with the classics Pliny the younger, In the twenty-seventh letter of his seventh book, writes to his friend Sura, " I should much like to know whether you think there be any such things as ghosts, and whether they have any real form and being, or are mere nothings and un- realities, which have received shape from our fears " There is the problem, much as it still remains Pliny expresses an inclination to be five in the reality of the ghosts, and then tells three stories which have led him to that Mon The second story runs thus There a.m., in Athens s certain house, spacious and convenient, but if evil report and baleful Here, in the stillness of the night, might be heard a oUnk of iron, and, if you listened attentively, the sound of chains, at first distant, and then coming nearer Afterwards a spectre appeared, an old man, wasted and squalid, with long beard and hair erected with horror On his arms and logs were letters, which he shook He made the nights of those who inhabited the house miserable, sleepless horror, which, as then fears increased, terminated in sickness and death. The force was in consequence deserted and relinquished to the occupation of this monster A voice was also put up to prevent anyone from either buying or renting the house in ignorance of lb evil character. The philosopher Athenngoras, on his arrival in Athens, read the inscription, and, having found that the rent was suspiciously low, Inquired more into the matter in spite of what he heard, or rather in consequence of it, he at once took the 1060 At nightfall he had in room prepared for himself in the forepart, and, having tent all his servants to the back, took his tablets and began to write As soon as the science of night set in, the iron clanked as usual, and the chains were shaken The noise came nearer, and presently the philosopher, looking up, saw and recognised the apparition The Ghost stood signifying with his flower that he desired to be followed Athenngoras, after eyeing him for awhile, continued his writing Htroupon the other began to abate his chains over the philosopher's head while he wrote Athenngona then took up his light The ghost, w sinking slowly, as if we sighted by his chains, led him to the yard of the house where he vanished Having mark ed the spot with some grass and leaves, the philosopher, on The following morning, called upon the magistrates, and requested that the ground might be dug up Below were discovered bones tangled among chains After the performance of the funeral rites the house was free from the " masses " This is about the quintessence of all the haunted house stones over told Only the intimation, ''This house is haunted," would ban novelty From the younger Pliny to John Ryder is a period of 1300 years, during which the vast majority of writers accepted what Play had been inclined to believe as indisputable fact And bonus wonderful tales they wrote But few of them could tell a ghost story so well as the Dominican year, though he, like all the rest, repeats many an ancient history as having recently occurred, of course 1400 is a specimen of his skill At the time of the Russian troubles the sound of gathering cavalry was every night to be heard in certain valley on the Bohemian border Those who had the curiosity to approach the locality described from a distance a large host of mounted men, some in black, some in red, and some 111 -"other colours The portent was differently interpreted, and a couple of officers quartered in a neighbouring camp, resolving to our mind more closely into the matter, set out one night to visit the valley When they were about to enter it one of them, beginning to feel uneasy, remarked, " Well, there they are We have 0 seen them now, and I suggest we should go no further There is an old adage that it is wisest not to trifle with apparitions " The other, laughing at his timidity, sparred his horse, and, whilst his more prudent companion watched him, rode towards the mysterious host As he drew near it, a single horseman issued from the ranks, rode up to him, and cut off his head His friend took flight, and reported in the camp what had happened On the following morning the decapitated corpse and severed head were both found in the alloy But no traces either or horses of men were perceptible, only, where the ground was muddy, the footprints of birds It will be remembered that mediaeval demons had cocksfoot 'The spook who cuts off heads Kerns a being distinctly superior to the one which wastes its time in tapping under a table BMghosts have always paid the living the cost pleasures of conforming strictly with the sublunary fashions of the day ., "j {" the best and oldest of Nyuor's tales 15 the following A certain knight was resolved among the nobility of Laws Germany for his in- trepidity His courage and daring find involved mm, oitkeroflensivelj or defensively, in a number a private rivers, and for that reason it was his wont to take horse exercise only in certain places, area after dark One moonlight night he was thus riding, accompanied by a single attendant, through a wood near the Rhine As they approached the edge of the wood he had his atton "M go forward and see if all was safe The man "do to the edge of the wood, and, peeping out, perceived a large body of cavalry of remarkable appearance On his reporting this, his master 'rest "We will wait awhile A rearguard will probably follow the main body We can without {f Bdo up to them and learn whether they are unit" ACCA" Aooorain'i1r. they presently 1 1 *u0 wood's But could now see only a r's horseman, who led a riderless horse The ""fiat Moved that he engaged in was man his cook, who had recently died Riding up to him he accordingly asked, " Are not you may cook ? " " I am, sir," replied the horseman " What are you doing here then, and who were those in front ? " " They are nobles and gentlemen, sir such) a one, and such a one," robbed the dead man, naming a number of them , " and I have to ride with them to-night to Jerusalem, that being the punishment imposed upon us " " Why have you a spare horse ? " " That is at your service, sir, if you like to accompany us I promise you, by the Christian faith, that no harm shall befall you either going or coming, if you will comply with my instructions " "Well, I have in my life ventured on some strange enterprises," said the knight, " I will add this one more to them " Accordingly, in spite of his attendant's discussions, he descended from his own horse, and, mounting that which the dead married, rode away with him Both disappeared together from the end of the attendant On the following night the dead man and the knight returned to the same spot, where the latter had bidden his servant meet him At parting the ghost produced a small handkerchief of Salamander and a knife in a sheath, and said to the knight, " That you may not suppose this to have been a mere illusion, accept these two gifts and keep them in memory of me When the kerchief becomes dirty, cleanse it in the fire It will not be injured But handle the knife with caution, for anyone wounded by it will be poisoned " After which he v vanished Whether the knight had anything to tell about his journey to Jerusalem is not related The following remarkable history is of later date It will be found in Michael Status's " Mensa Philosopher," a work oddly combining advice respecting various articles of diet with a supply of tales considered by the author con- ducive to digestion A certain usurer of Metz, perceiving that his end was near, ordered a bag of money to be placed in his sepulchre, and bound his relatives by an oath to comply with his instructions They did so, but after the lapse of some time the heirs opened the tomb to recover the money In the sepulchre they found a demon engaged in feeding the corpse with the coins out of red-hot spoon
