Correiipondeiice. I [Tho Editor does not hold himsolf roaponsiblo for opinions oxprossod by oorrospondonts.] to the editor or the riohmond river herald. Sir, â€” I notioo by two most discordant ' Hoe Haws ' in your issuo of Friday last that either Balaam's chargcr is not dead yet or his ghost still walks the earth. Now most poople,' other than Chinamon, were of opinion that he was litorally oxooutcd and socially dono to death on tho 12th instant, nnd consider it highly impertinent that tho ghost of a (load donkoy should still bo ' braying ' about Stovo King's Plain, or any othor plnco, to tho nnnoynnco of Hor Majosty's subjocts ; nnd oxpross a hope that if not actually dofuuot ho will havo tho dcooncy to dio nt onco nnd depart t.- a quadrupedal paradiso whoro discordant cchoos, stupidity, and dofoctivo orthography aro passports to much higher officoa than evon that of n Steve King's Plain postmastor. But wo havo nil read of tho ass that stolo a liou's skin, nnd induing itself thoroin tried to pass us tho king of beasts, nnd the ignoblo pnss to whioh it catno in oonsoquonco ; aud iu your Steve King's Plain correspondents wo liavo persons covering tlioir educational and mental defi ciencies with tho soattorod loaves of somebody elso's diotiounry, and ondoavouritig to exhibit themselves as intelligent beings. But tho last two cases aro equally as signal failures as tho first, aud as a tost of the intellectual capaoity of these scribhlors I propouud tho following quostion for tbcm to answer ' If it takes 15 meotings and 7 mon to oonooct a petition which tlio Postal Dopartmont or nnybouy clao oannot understand, how long will it take to obtain a post-offico at Stove King's Pliiin, or for W.
