Sz 00. [?] \- - - .CiraRla: O&fev; Tiie Benefit to AIk. \\\ kiss. — Then p. w hall was fairly filled on Tuesday evening to witness the per formance which had been arranged as a compli mentary benefit to Mr. "Weiss. The programme- opened with the comic drama of " Little Toddle- kins, with the following caste : — Mr. Jones R. Brownsmith, Mr. H. G. Antill ; Barnahy Babi- combe, Mr. Weiss ; Captain Littlepop, Mi1. James Percival ; Amanthis, Mr. Charles Hodd ; Annie Babicombe, Mr. R. Flanders ; Susan, Mr. A.Stuhhs. The different parts were well sustained. A cornet duct, by Messrs. Lovell and H. S. Vincent, fol lowed/and was heard to much advantage. Mr. Cohen then gave correctly "The Aral) to his steed." "There stands a post" by Mr. Andrews was capitally rendered, and, in response to a voci ferous encore, that gentleman substituted " Tom Tough." Mr. Swindell succeeded with "The Life boat." Playing his owu accompaniment, he fairly brought down the house, and being readied, sung with feeling and expression "Rook'd in the cradle of the deep." The mute burlesque of " Don Juan" brought the performance to a close. Each charac ter was well played, more especially the ghost (Air. C. Wagner) ami clown (Air. C. Hodd). The piece was nicely mounted, the burning furnace of his Satanic Alajesty making a most effective tabi- a ix. On the whole, the entertainment was well received. We believe the amateurs contemplate giving another performance shortly, in aid of the Hospital funds, wheu it is proposed to put 011 a high class "comedy quite new to the Glen lanes boards. English Budget.— For the first time since its advent to power, the Gladstone Ministry finds a deficit in its accounts. The income for last year was £4,000,000 less than the. expenditure. Jt is 'estimated that, there will he. a deficit this year of 24 millions. The actual and prospective deficiency is to be met by increasing the income tax from 6(1, to 8d. and an additional duty tm beer and spirits.
