BISHOP THORNTON'S GHOST. Dr. Thornton, the Bishop of Ballarat, relates, in the "Fireside" for December, how he put an end to a ghost, when rector of a large English parish. He was on a visit to a new and extensive house, elabo rately fitted with gas stoves and brackets and all recent appliances. "Upon being shown into the diningroom, where all the family were assembled, I at once saw that something was wrong. Soon the story was told to me. There was a ghost. It was believed a girl had been immured in the basement of the next house, which was in the course of construction. 'Of course," I said, 'you have communicated with the police?' 'Yes,' was the reply, 'and a policeman is on duty to try and get at her. But it is no good.' The servants had all given notice, and nobody knew what to do about the ghost. I went down to where the noise seemed to come from and, after returning, suggested that J should be allowed to control the family domestics and house for half an hour. Permission was granted. I then ha.! a talk with two servants. Afterwards, v. :i|, the family, I went down to the cellar \v''.,ie the fearful groans continued. 'Avaum, ] cried, in a loud voice, 'Abracadabra. ] charge thee to abate these wailin-js.' Slowly the noise died away. 'Aldiboron o phoscophormio!' I shouted again. 'C'h o nonhotonthologos! Now raise thy as loud as thou canst raise it.' The gro ,as waxed louder and louder, reaching su<!; a climax that my companions turned to b. but a loud peal at the door-bell transii>,,| them with a sudden terror. The rector •!. tected the cause of the trouble. A sn>; li piece of grit had got into the gas-pipe, a the gas going over this had created i<„. row, which, a6 the quantity turned on in creased, grew in force. The servants I,ml iirst lowered all the lights, and, when la. Thornton shouted the second time, tun,, ci all on full, producing the distressing nni--o. The gas-fitter soon removed the obsti - tion, and nothing more was heard of me ghost.
