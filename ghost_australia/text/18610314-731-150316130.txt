, QAYNDAH. L _ [FROM THE QBOST OF 'BAH BAN.] '?(Tie following reached iis Wo lttteifof publicatio^n in our i last issue.] 1 take tbe unpleasant oppp^tunity.of the po6tman banging eabout town to-day to call the attention of the public to the .unwarrantable liberties which »-i£ postmaster here takes tarltli pustal arrangements.' 1 he (the postman) came in late f lASt ni|ht,£nd now, apparently to please this 4a»y, -skulking i fellow. the mail is delayed by 'command' nutir to-tnoirovTi ind tettfert which we, have written expfes^ly for England aud ; elsewhere, the CI areh ce.-'Will f probaily arrive at Malryi borough too late to catch the m^il steamer. This is a state t of ^things wtllchtiuili be itiKnedlateljr stopped. Np^dtrabt , out PostmaBter U deep jo the fiff^ctions of the Postmaster- j 'OineVal,' relies upon the obligation be has involved the [ *n$inb|!r in,; aud ^tbinki therefore that Hi. Mackenzie is bouud to ratify all his postal acts. But the public most unmistak caveat against such proce^tngs.

' The whole blame of tlicno irregularities on tlie part of tho contractor* is due to the - postmasters-at GHjudali and Maryborough; and their. loving pHtrliu at Urisltane. However the first may ei'f from drunk etmessi SnsulHoient mea'ips to enrry out their contract*, and etnplinltig improper servants to run the mads,— the secojul always find excuses for their failures, and the. third rejoices ? ? app nently at those excusei. To my knowledge, females have been riding with ease along 'Our roads lately, attlievery ,* time «nf laxy postmen ?liuve'fcceu receiving certificates froiii tlie toc:tl postmasters that the roads were impassable. It-Is ? uotoiioiis to many in this- town that more than one person has ridden to and from Maryborough during tbe late incle ment weather, and denied, aud by their act disproved, that those ensy postmasters were justified in recording tliiCt the roads were not travellnble. If excuses are to be found by . those wlio should not Helen to any, for' our good-for-nothing postmen, the sooner wc cease to patronise the department of that- ridiculous and call able minister the better. I am sur prised at Mr. Connolly, but do not wonder at that piece of antiquity in Maryborough. March 4. ' '
