FeeBLSliED EVESY TUESDAY AND FRIDAY. TUESDAY, MAY 20, 1891. TOE possibilte t rs fwhat friit-growing may be made as an adjunct to their ordinary methods of cultivation have been of late urged with such persistency, and -the argiu mnents used in this direction contain so much iogic nnd truththt, h it is satisfictory to know that the mattei lias been taken up practically in many iiectionsis Such-additioijnl Qvidence as:was made available by. the delivery ofE a lecture on fruits not generally ciultivatcd which'hould receive more attention, bya departmental ~expert in Horsham last week; ought-to prove of Salue to the 'whole of orir agriicultu-m rusts. Although. culture in this direc tion has, compiratively speaking, only etrently come iintd vogu, it has been: proved #to be so encouraging that the hope may-now be indulged in that a system of supplement ne t~he iicome to be derived by farmei sro ee sian of their operations in tliesediroe tions will be mgore-enerally, adopted. That the soil and climatic co'nditions ofj thie district are favorable to tlie cultivation of ai large number of fruits: -and that .with profit-has been borne testimony;jto hynmany judges of high authority; and in the several places where fruit-girowng operations have been put into actual practice, the res;iltdhies fully realisedj the exipectii:. hons formed. To those who ar e scep ticl on this ipoint it may be duilcult of proof yet awhile that theire is piofit in it; but these doubters may have their attention drawn to that portion 'pf Mi. Ccisaroy Ml s imak were lie reminded his audience that in the ds. whaeW hettleuient i athe Widmen f V ithe purpose of prosecuting agricultuie wass first mooted it .was confi dently held that the land would Bot onggro rain.. The fallacy of this view has been overwhelmingly demonstiated, asud it is but natural to )' uticipate that a similar result may ow in regad to the extensive culti Sfoh: - of fruit so as to make it a con iati -13e source of profit to farmerF.. side'ab. 'ything.else in the way of Like evi V eer, it is necessary, to bculture, ho "I.t intelligence should he begrin with, th. choice of fruits likely exercied inth everl parts of t :to bear well in the. .- attention to de :district, and untiung "-:h their culture tails in connection wit. \% lost or any so that no points should b, \t of per failure occur through wan e. Mr. severance and intelligent cai \,r of CmIcnToN enumerated a numb, 'Zjly fruits in his lecture (which was tL reported in last issue of the Time,, \ which, in his knowledge, were well adapted for profitable cultivation in this district, but any sensible person can rse that effort, in tjis direction must be intelligent, practical and per severing. No farmer should be pre pared to make up his mind that there is nothing in fruit-growing as an ad janct to his wheat-growing operations v until-he hals given the experiment a fair trial. It` may he anid that the It conditions of farming life are so 5 pressing and even irecessitous that a I struggling farmer has no time, money I or labor to devote his land or his I energies to such things as experiments t ,which may or may not come out right at ,the end of two or three seasons. Bu.rt aQ st this'view many be urged the very' fact that farming is a vocation < of soiprecariotis a chdr-cter that; in < order.to beabreast of the.times and to hold his own in the competition con stantly going-on; it is necessary that a fmirmers should'-notr confinel-his yearly operations 'to one :groove:1 And it must be remembered that under the present circumstances ourr ngricul turists are so placed by wise lerislation in the direction of the State placing ex pert knowledge and other assistance at their disposal, the risks attaching to any new- departure such as thiss are reduced to a miniminum and the under~ taking removed a long way from the category of leaps in the dark. The lectures 5heing'given 'tlirouihoiut the colony on such subjects as that we are alluding to, and others cognate to the province of agriculture, are of highs vnrlue. but- the contact ,into which the systein brings the f.rrmer with prac tically and theoretically ,informed. experts ;is of ,rgreater momentIand fis' likely to lead to still better results. In this way mi7s "ratifying to kkin 'thmit rCi uCuro ,,will again gvisit our, district in a fewv day's.time for the pubrpse of peronahlly .arvising tlirse' who:may desire .to consult hiiin "upon detaiils connected- with fruit growing, anid meanw~hile thin text mdir subject: of his late U.lecture sihould be with advantage read: and, pondered over. Beingi in its inhitiatory stage, the cul ture of fruit as an auxiliary to wheat growing may be taken up tentatively and iso' sm'niill "'tay; there is no need .to neglect the cultivation of the staple, but to lay out a feiw acies with'vines or such fruit as, with the assistance of the Goverrinment expert, it may be found that the soil and conditioins of'the farmer are best adapted to.' Tlerie can 'possibly be no harn. in ,trying fruit-"rowing as an mitxiliary to this extent, and there is every 'reason to anticipate tlhat the result, aftr, a; year or two,.will be so encouraging as to induce a steady and more isompiereihsive coiltinuance of the undertak-ing The potentialities as has been proved in. the cise of wlheat-growing since thie Winimeera abandoned the slec of a huge sheep wislk-are enormous, and the prospects are so encouraging that our farmers would be pursuing a suicidal course should they not take advsnt'ge of their opporturiities. 'One os two of the kinds of fruit mentioned by Mr.' CmcurToN have been tried in this district, but the grape is one which may be said to have established itself here, and the profits to be made from that alone is sufliciently encouraging to impel far mers to continue to plant out vines. Surprise Ira's been expressed at the coisiparatively low price of land ruling in parts of the district, but if the enormous capabilities of our farms in the direction of fruit preserving are fairly well tried as an adjunct to wheat growing, there is every cause to hope that the figures now representing the value of land in the Wimrmera will be enhanced by .something aspproacbing a 'hundred per cent. Tire remarks of another Government expert, Mr. Wcsv, in i gard to the ir dustry of rasin makmiggmy be remem bered,and it will be of iihterest'tuilenmsn wliat has been done in this particular lirection in ma part of the colony the characteristics of which are fairly simi lar to our own.

The landing of the a Saxons had the effect of driving the pro. . fessors of Christianity into the western a districts tund for some years the lstnd to a great extent became again heathen.
