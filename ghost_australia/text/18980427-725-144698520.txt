For Grover had worked about the place, man and boy, fotsjpjarly seventy years; he had been taken on fitft in old Mr. Travis's time, the Qdoaa's jfriujbather ; l*e had been raised to the dfgafty of head-gardener by the late Blaster, tbe Colonel's uncle ; and now that &£ Colonel bad inherited the old place, he )Sd many a tale to tell of the spirited, fair* Hired child who had always spent his holi days at Dorlton Hall, and 'iad been each a favourite with his young 'cousins, Frank and Walter. 1 Ay, they wor alius good to the little chap, thoy wot ; and lively enui 'e was in thefo day§,' the old man would say, addressing the younger generation, to whom tibe Colonel was a stranger; 'alios at Sir.

Bot in &e; Colonel's -S&— — ? -YesF as he panted, shaking his shaggy white head expressively. * What in the Colonel's case P * I doaH know what to say. and that's the fact/ ' And certainly xm one was better qualified to give an opinion. 4?he Colonel had left the army on succeed ing to his inheritance, and he bad now been ' settled at home for six months or more. He ; had been cordially received in the neigh - bourbood; bdt though he had met all friendly advances pleasantly, be had shown Utile inclination to society. To women be Wa& cbhalronsly courteous, and absolutely indifferent ; be avoided them, whenever ho could do so without incivility, and when that was impossible, he did his duty liko a man and a gentleman. What more need gallant Colonel and wealthy landed pro - ptfeior attempt ? One friend, however, Colonel Travis bad made unco he oamt home, and that waa the Sector. Mr. Winton was a good old man, and yests and experience had taught both kindlinfaa and tact. Ha was a lonely man, too ; for be was childless, and bis wife had long been dead. The Bectory stood but a stone's-, throw from the gates of the Hall, and the Colon $1 often etroUed over after dinner for a smoke, or a hard-fought game ot chess. One evening be was going there as usual, when a girl came quickly down the path jnrtafl 1m reached the Bectory gate; 40 that ~h§pa*tt$d and held it open for her to pass out. She was very young— not more man fifteen or sixteen, perhaps —and as he glanced at her, the setting eun shone redly on her I fair haif and delicate, pale features, giving them a richer warmth of colouring ihan Nature had ever intended them to possea. * Thank you,* the eaid shyly ; and, aa she spoke, he started and looked at her more keenly. \- It is getting late.

I I have long wished to meet so the one whom X ftuld ask to lfte with me, and Nurse Hargaret is just the person I want— a thorough lady, of whom X could ; make a friend-- while Hay will give me quite a new interest in life.
