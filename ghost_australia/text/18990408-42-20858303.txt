Translation Too Literal. "A Queenslander who has just returned from a trip abroad that combined several months of professional study with a number of weeks of sight-seeing tells a funny story of a German medical student who was Inordi nately proud of hia knowledge of the English language. It occurred during a recitation hour In a well-known college in Berlin, and the lesson had just been interrupted by the arrival of several prominent Germans ac companying a distinguished American tra veller. The professor in charge of the reci tation saw his opportunity to please the noted visitor, and immediately proposed to his lin guistic pupil to translate a verse of the Ger man i√ürble into English. The guest ex pressed his anticipatory pleasure, the Bible was opened, a verse chosen at random, and the proud student stood up and assumed an important air. The lines selected were from the story of the apostles' sleep in the Garden of Geth semane. " The spirit Indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak,' 1 which the medical stu dent treated in the free and easy manner of "The ghost Indeed is ready, but the meat Is poor."
