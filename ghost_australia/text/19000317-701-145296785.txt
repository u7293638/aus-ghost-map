THE DOWAGEK-KMPEESS. The Dowager-Empress of China has practically risen from the gutter, for she was the child of poor parents living in the wretched slums of Canton, and a famous general, attracted by her marvel lous beauty — Chinese! — bought her. AiiL-jj uie ciupeivr, xisieu xeng, saw her and fell as much in love as if he were not yellow-skinned and oral-eyed, ne had already one wife, but the customs of China enabled him to plaoe a second on very nearly the same footing, and it was not long before the newcomer bad tbe Emperor 'under her thumb.' When Hsien Feng died he bequeathed the crown to his sou Tung Chi, but the Regency was divided between his two wives, and tbe second became the chief power in. the empire. Her force of char acter soon inadte itself felt. In process of time the Emperor Tung Chi reached bis majority. Then one fine day the legitimate widow died, and very very shortly afterwards the Emperor also died. Scarcely had the young Emperor given up the ghost, than the Dowager de clared that the child of one of her sisters, married to the seventh Prince, Chun by name, bad been adopted by her late hus band, and she accordingly proclaimed him Emperor. Then she ruled the kingdom, and did it remarkably well, though she was conservative in the extreme. Even when the Emperor came of age he was a | mere cipher, and though for a short time he struggled for authority it was useless. The Dowager Empress has power, and means to continue to hold it. She is now 39 years old, but- hardly Iooks half that age. — 'Woman's Weekly.'
