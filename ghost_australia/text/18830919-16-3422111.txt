DONALD GRANT." BY GEORGE MACDONALD. Author of " Alec Forbes," "Malcolm," c, c. CHAPTER XXII. (Continued.) IN the morning Donal heard from Simmons that the cart was sory ill indeed could not raise his head "Thcsvayhe do moan and cry," said Sun mons, you would think either side he was out of his mind, or had something heavy upon it ! But, all the years I have Knowing, every now' and then he has been like that, then back to his old self again, little the ss worse for it " Towards the close of morning school, just as Donal was beginning to gis o Das in his lessen in religion, as David called it, Lady Arctuia entered the schoolroom, and sat down beside Dasic, and Donal, in what he said to Davie had therefore a special regard to the lady "What would you think of me, Davie," be took occasion to ask, if I were vciyiuigiy with you because you did not know something I had never taught you Day by only laughed It was to him agro resque, an impossible, supposition "Suppose," Donal resumed, ' Iweietosboss you a proposition in Euclid, which you had never seen before, and some to say to you, Now, Dasie, this is one of the most beautiful of all Field's propositions, and I desire you will immediately admire it in itself, and admire Euclid for putting it so beautifully radically before us ,' what could you say to that Davie thought and looked puzzled "You wouldn't do that, sir! I know you wouldn't it," he said after a moment "Why should I not " It isn't your way, sir. " " But suppose I were to take that way' ' "should think you were not like yourself, sir" " Tell me then why you would think me not like myself Think ' "Because you would not be reasonable." "What would you say to me '" " I should say, ' Please, sir, let me learn the proposition first and then I shall be able to admire it I don't know it yet ' " " Very good Now again, suppose, when you tried to learn it, you were not able to do so, and therefore could see no beauty in it, would I not blame you >" " No, sir, I am sure you would not because I should not be to blame, and it would not be fair and you never do what is not fair ' ' "I am glad you think so I try to be fair. That looks as if you believed in nee, Davie' ' " Of course I do, so ' ' "Why" "Just because you are far " "But I might blame you, Dasic, if you did not understand the proposition " " Yes, if I did not try hard to learn it " "Suppose, Dasic, I said to you, 'Here is a very beautiful thing I should like you to hear it, and, you said to me, ' I don't think it is very beautiful " "It would be very rude. But you know I could not do that "Why not"' Because I believe in you " Suppose, then, you had begun and partly learned it, and one day you said to me, "I don't see anything beautiful in this I am afraid I never shall' Would that be to believe in mc '" "No, surely, sir, for you know best what I am able to do " "Suppose you were to say, daresay it is all as good as j 011 say, but I don't care to take so much trouble about it, what would that be'" " A want of faith in you, sir You would not want more To up a thing that was not worth my trouble, 01 1 thing I should not be glad of knowing when I did know it " "Suppose you were to say to me, 'So, I don't doubt what you tell me about this 01 til it, but I am so tired of the whole thing I don't mean to do anything 111010 -y 011 tell 1110 could you then be s and to believe in the ' "No, nothing I might 311st believe your won!, but it would not be to suit you It would be to think my thinks better than your thinks, and that would be to put no faith at all in you " Davie had at times a curiously childish way of saying things "Suppose you were to say nothing, but go away and do nothing of what I told you to do what would that be "It would be worse and worse, for it would be speaking One question more What is faith-the big faith, I mean not the little faith that thinks you speak the ti nth-the big faith that we put in one boy e is ' ' To go at once and do the thing he tells us " "If you don't, then you hav en t faith in him ' " No, certainly not " " But might not that be his fault" "Yes-if he was not good, if I could not trust him , if he said I was to do one kind of thing, and did another himself, then of course I could not have faith in him " "And yet) you might feel you must do what he told you '" " Yes, but not from faith in him " " Would you allow ii s do what he told j oil " "No, not if he told me to do what it would be wrong to do " "Now tell me, Davie, what is the biggest faith of all-the faith to put in the one only thoroughly good person " " You mean God, Mr Grant'' " Whom else could I mean " You might mean Jesus " "They are all one there, for they mean always the same thing, do always the same thing, always agree whereas only one thing the one does that the other never does, they do not love the same poison " "What do you mean Mr Grant'" inter rupted Arctura, she had been listening in tently, and now first imagined the cloven foot of Mr. Grants heresy about to appear " I mean this, said Donal, with a smile that seemed to Antara such a light as she had never seen on human face, for it rose from no fount of mere human gladness, but from the most human gladness that is only to be found in God "I mean that God loses Jesus, not God; and Jesus loves God, not Jesus We love one another, not ourselves don't we, Davie'" "You do, Mr. Grant," answered Davie, modestly. "Now tell me, Davie, what is the great big faith of all that ss e have to put in the Father of us, who is as good not only as thought can think, but as good as heart can wish-in- finitely better than anybody but Jesus Christ can think- ss hat is the faith to put in him '" "Oh, it is everything'" answered Davie. "But what first'" asked Donal "First it is to do what He tells us." "Yea, Dasic, it is to learn His problems by going and doing them, not trying to understand them first, 01 doing anything else whatever with them first than obeying them. We spread out our arms to Him as a child does to his mother when he wants her to take him, then when He sets us down, saying " Go and do this or that,' we make all the haste in us to go and do it. And if ever as to get hungry to see God we must look at His picture." " Where is that, sir'" "Ah, Dawe, Davie, 1; don't you know that yet ' Don't you know that, besides being himself, and just because he is himself, Jesus is the living picture of God '" "I know, sir' We have to go and read about Him in the book." " But may I ask you a question, Mr. Grant <" said Arctura "With all my heart," answered Donal. "I only hope I may be able to answer it " " When we read about Jesus ss e have to draw for oursels as the likeness of Jesus from words, and you know what kind of a likeness the best artist would make that way, who had never seen with his own eyes the person whose portrait he had to paint '" " I understand You quite," returned Donal "Some go to other men to draw it for them,, and some go to others to tell them what they are to draw for themselves thus getting all their blunders in addition to those they must make for themselves But the nearest likeness you can see of him is the one drawn by your self from thinking about Him while you do what He tells you. No other is of crystal use to you And just here comes in the great promise He made in itself true, and a law of God, else it could not have been a promise of Jesus just as noscnptmeisof private interpretation, but is a principle that applies to all If God were not in us at all, we should see nothing at all of His likeness. And He has promised to come Himself into our hearts, to give us His spirit the very presence of His soul to our souls, talking in language that cannot be uttered because it is too great and strong and fine for any words of ours. So will He be much nearer to us than even His personal presence to us would be, and so we shall see Him and be able to draw for our senses the likeness of God. But first of all, and before everything else, mind, Dasie, OBEDIENCE" " Yes, Mr Grant, I know," said Dance. "Then off with you to the games God has given you." " I'm going to fly my late, Mr. Grant." The sole right of publication in Queensland of Donal Grant" has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, limited. " Do God likes to see you fly your kite Don't forget it is all in His March wind it flies. It could not go up a foot but for that." Davie went, but Arctura did not fellow him " You have heard that my uncle is very poorly to day '" she said "I have Poor man said Donal. "He is in a very peculiar condition " of body and mind both, I should think He greatly per piece fine " "You would be quite as much perplexed even if you had known him so long as I have, never since my father's death, which seems a century ago, have I felt safe, and never in my uncles siDence at case I seem not to get any near to him as the weeks go past ' And do you know, Mr Grant, it seems to me that the cause of all discomfort and strife is never that we are too near others, but that we are not near enough " This was a i remark after Donald's own heart "I understand you, he said, "and entirely agree with you " " I never feel that my uncle cares a straw for me except as one of the family, and the possessor of its chief property He might have liked me better, perhaps, if I had been dependent on him, instead of he in a measure on me, it sounds very hot and, but one gets compelled to look some things in the face " " How long will he be your guardian ' ' asked Donal "He is no longer my guardian legally The time set by my father's will was over last month I am three and twenty, and my own n mistress But of course my father's brother is welcome to Ino in my house as long as he pleases It is much better for me too to have the head of the house to protect me I only wish he were a little more like other people But this is not what I wanted to talk to you of tell me about the ghost music we had not time to talk about it last night " I got pretty near, at least so it seemed, to the place it c are from The wind blew so, and it was so dark, that I could do nothing more then " " But you will try again on the first opportunity "I will not wait for one " "But I shall be rather sorry, to tell the truth, if you find out it has indeed a natural cause " " For that matter, my lady, how can there be any other than a natural cause ' A cause is either a natural-so a rational-cause, of it is only a pseudo cause- that is, no cause at all God and Nature are one God is the causing Nature I should be sorry to take my measure of the external or natural from the judgment of those who many way deny Hun The truth is the only thing worth having, and, if there were anything more beautiful than the truth in the imagination of man, we might be sure that rather it was, or had been, and would be again, or had only been sent to men last, perhaps through him to be realised You may June remarked that the music is heard only in storm) nights, 01 at least nights when a good deal of wind is blowing ' " I have been d it in the day time " " But on a windy day ' ' "When you mention it, I think so I am at least each vain I never heard it on a still summer night " "Do you think it comes in all storms' " I think not But what of that is" that perhaps it has something to do not merely with the wind but with the direction of the wind " I cannot say you enlighten me much " " Might not that account for the uncertainty of its times and seasons' The instrument might be a head uni accessible one, yet the opportunity of investigation so rare that its immediate converse with the operative power had never been observed It is a case, as you see, in which exper ment is not per mitted us ; we cannot make a veil blow when we will, listen can we val) the direction of the wind, blowing where it lists, observation alone is loftus, and this of course can only be at such times as the wind blow a and the sound is heard " ' Then how can you do anything till such another wind comes and sets the music going ' ' "Tn«fTiin-l (. T minim tim star. film in the eye may supplement the car, and come upon the music had silent on her nest " What if son find nothing' ' "Something there may be for all that I may even find the wrong thing, and yet the light thing be there If the sand falls, as I think it so ill by the time school is over in the afternoon, I will go again and see what I can find One thing I noticed last night, that the sound came just at a sudden change of the soundness aids the southeast, I think-a less usual (for tea for it to come from It was blowing a mild way about thohouselust night 1 July Aictura's eyes opened wide ' I think," she said, the wind has some thing to do with my uncle's ss orst fits Do you mean there is as any thing very strange about it last night' When the wind blows strangely, those should always come to me-' The prince of the power of the au, the spirit that ss oaks in the children of disobedience '" " I do not know what that means," answered Donal, "hut I suspect it has nothing to do with things of the sort I suppose the epithet lines as a symbol of the difference between the wind of God that inspires the spiritual true self of man, and the sound of the world that works by thousands of impulses and influences in the losses, the selfish, self of children that will not obey I will look at the passage and see what I can make out of it Only the spiritual and the natural blend so that we may one day bcjistoiushcd Would you like to join the search, my lady " You don't mean go on the roof 1 Should I be able Î ' "I would not have you go in the night, with the wind blowing," said Donal with a laugh, "but you can at least look out and see, and judge for yourself I could make it quite easy for you When I tell you I mean to take Davis with me, you may think I do not count it very dangerous I " " But will it be safe enough for Davis" "I can venture more with Dasic than with another, because he obeys in a moment " " I will promise to a boy too if you will take me," said Arctura. " Then be at the schoolroom at 4 o'clock, my lady. But we will not go except the wind has fallen " " All right ' ' said Arctura, who, as soon as she heard that Davis would be of the party, was as ready to go as David himself [TO BE CONTINUED ]
