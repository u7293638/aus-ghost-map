LITERATURE Selected Poetry. In Praise of Sleep. THERE is a land where nightly I repair, At whose dim gate I lay my cross aside, Stretch out my arms toward Rest, as toward a bride, And am withal assuaged. Ah ! even there, Beyond false hope, beyond the stress of prayer, Beyond the hurt and smart of wounded pride, With no more huuger for sweet things denied, My heart has rest and respite from despair. 0 Land of mystic shapes and languid pleasure I Waste fields of poppies, without track, it seems; O scentless lilies, by the voiceless streams Where come my ghosts and dance a silent measure, Hold my lost joy now only in dear dreams; Give back to me, sometimes, my buried treasure. 1 have no heart in me for Love's delight, How sweet the summer was I I know its spell, Who care not now what stars may have to tell, For me the day is void, and void the night Upon her dim and inaccessible height Fame stands above me, robed and crowned. Ah, well I Let those who love her find her pleasurable. She hath nor grace nor merit in my sight. I only am in love with tender sleep— Dew on my sad, unfruitful flower of life, Of which no man the memory may keep, 0 most divine forgetf ulness of strife, Mysky is not too gray, my path too steep, While thou art mine, for friend, for love, for wife I —Philip Route Marston, in Independent.
