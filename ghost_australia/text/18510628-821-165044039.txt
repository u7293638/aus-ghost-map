" LET THEM BE RUINED! " TO THE EDITOR OF THE ADELAIDE OBSERVES. bir-The above is an expression put into ttie moutn ot one of the oldest, most humane, and kind-hearted of our South Australian colonists -Dr. Nash-when lately sitting on the Bench. I feel much pleasure in stating that the question has been put to several gentlemen on and off the,Bench at the time, who all confidently assert that they heard no such expres sion from the lips of Dr. Nash. The story brings to my recollection the sea-anecdote of a landsman,, who, having recently entered the royal navy, and being told to " let go the painter," instead of releasing a boat, unshipped an unfortunate wight, who, being em ployed in decorating the exterior of the ship, was dropped into the sea with his paint-pots and paraphernalia. It seems the ears and understanding of the writer of a letter signed " Caesars Ghost," in one of the weekly newspapers, are of a similar bright character, when he falsely accuses Dr. Nash of uttering an expression so opposite to his well known seutiinsnts and feeinffs. A LICENSED VICTUALLER.
