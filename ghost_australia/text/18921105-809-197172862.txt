THE LONDON WOOL MARKET. Fnou Our Special ConnitaroNDENT. LONDON. 30tii skptrmtietv Tho course of tho publio Bales since last mail has not brought out any feature of striking importance or of any groat onoouragomentto wool growers in the matter of improved price. Woll got up greasy Australians, especially shafty pro perly sklrtod parcels in light and frco condition, nas iioiu its own ami soiu wnit Keen competition for both Yorkshire aud the United States at full opening rates, the run being most marked, a previously advised, on clips of broad haired stylo rather than very fine quality. Heavy grease when ill condi tioned, badly skirted, or at all unsightly, by reason of long keeping in warehouses, has been going at absurdly low prices, a tho an nexed figures only too plainly show. For this olass tho market has been so irregular that it is almost impossible to quote relatively, but this feature has been prominent all along unfoitu- nately. I do not suppose it will be muoh com fort to know that tho New Zealand and Cape wools are selling on an oven lower basis for greasy parcels than the poor inferior Aus tralian, but it wilt be some littlo satisfac tion to know that prices for the latter aro- compnnitivcly higher than for tho produce of tho other colonic. Good sound New Zealnnd merino combing of fully average stylo has been selling freely nt 6J<L to 7d. per lb. It is many years sinco they were so depressed, tho doubtful yield is also acting prejudicially upon the sale. Crossbred. havo gone better the paBt few days, but the selection of fair parcels being small ha had a good deal to do with the improvement in values. As regards the future of tho staple, 1 find a small amount of encouragement from tbo almost unanimous verdict of the wholo of the wool dealers and speculators with whom I have come into contact this past fort night. that raw wool is quite cheap enough at to- day's prices, there is no trong desire on tho part of any section except perhaps spinners who have booked orders for yams at foolishly low rates for cheaper woo), but a certain kind of feeling is gaining ground that if a riso of say 0£d. to Id. per lb. could bo established it would bo decidedly beneficial, inasmuch ns It would causo the merchants and export cloth houses to placo order?, nnd so impart a little lifo and go to the trade. The ghost of " no confidence " is perhaps not haunting tho trade quito so closely, but still there is sad lagging behind on the part of many. Nobody seems lo have any idea whero the first signs of rovival are to be looked for. A current complaint amongst wool dealers is, "I have got plenty of 'cheap ' wool, but don't know where to sell it." The opening of your Sydney sales this week (just as the Adelaide last week), with price reported fully as high as (if not a shade above) London rates, has really been received with some degree of pleasure and thankfulness by those who hold blocks this side, as the fear wa strong in tho minds of many that & weaker market might have been experienced on your side than has actually been the case. If any thing, the effect upon these sales has been beneficial. Our usual list of prices paid or offered for leading brands will give a correct if not very exhilarating view of tho position.
