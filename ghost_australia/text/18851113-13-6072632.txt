miDAT, NOVEMBER lb', 182-. The children of the state had a good time on the whole during the year 1884 There is a large army of these little ones In all, the Government de- partment his 2,810 children on its hands, and the first impression is that this number is far too large, and that magistrates may well be urged once more, to use great caution before ever curing their power of committal In the report of the department for the year, M. have a quotation from a volume, " Preventive V ork," by Miss 1. HOPKINS " the principle " that and such are not to believed of the burden of their children is a most important one to recognise, " where its recognition does not involve the sacrifice of the child Where it "does, the lesser ear is surely to save the child, who otherwise Cows up to be a bad parent in turn, and the evil " becomes circular and endless ' It is sufficient to say that an general adoption bythomagistiatesof such a rule would be a caught with danger VV c have a some what restless, loving population, and our task is to restrict adoption by the state to narrow limits, lest our responsibilities would grow too enormous to be borne The cost of each child, is 3!'. per annum the expenditure of a shilling per head per diem cannot be grumbled at, but numbers might leader it an intolerable burden It has been our lot to light some stout battles in connexion with this cause, first, to secure the abolition 01 barrack schools, and, secondly, to obtain the proper management of the boarding out system Happily, the inspection is now too close for any large evils to escape unnoticed Complaint would be made here 01 than if there were any serious failure of system of fault of officers to record, but we have instead of gi fumbling a consensus of testimony that all is well improvement however, is possible in most institutions, and the secretary, Mr G GUILT Ami.., applies for changes and modifications, most of which seem desirable One or two of his proposals in particular, we are sure, will meet with the support of practical philanthropists One is, that the ago under which offenders can be sent to refer matches should be substantially increased, so that culprits now ordered to the gaol for punishment should be sent to the institutions for treatment. youths of eighteen are declared by the chaplain of the lied hill reformatory, England, to be very amenable to good influences more so than many boy s-and no doubt gaol intercourse is an education in came to many young offenders The verbatim evidence of a young lad, who was one of the cleverest pieces of pockets in England, was, "I have been in five " gaols, in one of them (the Lu spool " one) six. times 'the oftener you go, "the hardened you are ' in New York a special Reformatory has been established for dealing with first offenders between the ages of 16 and 30 The " probation system " of Massa churches, under which sentence is passed, but remains inoperative during the good behiMom of the offender, is warmly favoured by the secretary, and would seem to be well worth a trial The knowledge that a lapse into vicious habits will revive the old offence, and will be quickly followed by imprisonment, may reasonably be supposed to act as a powerful deterrent the son committal of the very young to reformatories is also a pleasure to be insisted upon, and we no glad to see that Mr. CiuiLrAUME is acting up to his views in removing the young from these institutions, when magistrates have sent them there, and is meeting with success in the results The record of one lad committed at the age of 11 was - Nomeuns of support, stealing pigeons uncontrollable. Press lously before Bench for stealing boots from a shop, and breaking church windows. 'The lad has been boarded out in a mountain district, and the report of the I visitor is good to) both at home and at school, runs home after he is finished at school to see what he can (do and is much liked by all the family is honest, man, and in lustrous Clearly this hills crime was " no means of support, in J it is a great and a good work to have rescued him from gaol bird surroundings, and to have given him a fair chance of becoming a respectable being Again, we have a child six years of age went first to a gaol and then to a reformatory " for stealing "fruiting company with other boys " Now that the bed has been boarded out, the report of the lady a visitor is -? ' lifeboat has very much improved since last sur He is a lively little fellow and with careful training" will, I believe do well The idea of sending a mere infant to a gaol and to a reformatory is bomb, The offender in these cases seems to be the magistrate but it is something that a rescue was effected, and Mr Gum your- deserves all credit for his enlightened philanthropy As regards the boarded out children, a complaint is noticed in the report that very few of the lads at the end of their term are sent to trades They work on farms instead The reasons, we are told, are the growing re- lectures on the part 01 tradesmen to take indoor apprentices, and the circumstance that a majority of the foster parents are engaged in farming, and the boys grow up with a knowledge of and a liking for the pursuit But excuses are undeceived v 'J he best course is being followed the boys are better fin on the land than they would be in the towns It was pleasant to hear Mr WAHI P. MADDEN on a recent occasion ii ei that some of the best men in the Wimmera district come from the " boarded out lad-,' and describe them as honest and prosperous settlers In no other position can the lads hope to be more happy, more healthy', and more useful to the community All that I remains after the young men are on their holdings, is to remember the advice given by Sir JOHN OSn NAssy, who would have provided for " our boys by marrying them to our girls" The two boxes of industrial school children will then be happily deposed of While the boarding out system appears to be fulfilling the highest expectations of its promoters, it is as well to bear in mind that it is a system which demands first class administration The seventy of inspection can never be relaxed The ladies' committees are again thanked in the report for their services, and they may be again reminded that upon their conscientious less nearly everything depends So with the officers of the state in no department are watchfulness and in telligence most required, for lack of vigour at the centre would soon mean feebleness at the extremities, and the children's guardians might become as bad as the 01 final cruel or indifferent parents Once work was shocked many quarter we should in the nature of things soon have a plentiful crop of injurious scandals The important land sale at Cororooke, which was reported in our columns yesterday, recalls an almost obsolete controversy which for many a long day absorbed the attention of politicians and amateur statesmen in this colony An immense volume of oratory has been poured out, and teams of fair white paper have been sacrificed, in the discussion of the vexed "big as tates ' question- and what ought to be done with it in A Victoria The English language has been enriched by certain classical phrases about " bursting up ' large holdings of land, and it looked at one time as if these colonies were about to discover and per 1 eet certain special methods of dealing with land which had hitherto been overlooked by the human race Some day) possibly the history of land legislation in the 'Australasian colonies will be taken in hand by) an impartial and painstaking history capable of approaching this phase of " democracy ' inAustialii in the same spirit which Dr. TocQül A iLT F brought to the consideration of democracy in America At present we have throughout Aus- tiara and New Zealand an enormous land act literature a library) full of statutes defunct 01 in force, but most) rev ned, amended, and patched until like the "ties of the Highlanders in the Nile expedition-then makers would scarcely recognise them A combination of circumstance , it need scarcely be 'and, made these colonies the happy hunting ground of theorists and experimenters in land legislation Almost every conceivable systems "reformed ' land tenure, settlement, and taxation has had a show in Australia or New Zealand in their turn, and it can hardly be denied that a long list of failures and disappoint- meat must be set off against a scanty record of successes South Australia may justly boast of the Torrens' Act, which is every now and then cited b) English statesmen as a model system of land registration and transfer Politicians in Great Britain may be left to decide for themselves whether wholeness Ad would be workable in that country, were, as Mr OSBORN I Mom IN long ago pointed out, the difficulty is not so much in transferring land as in finding out exactly what land you want to transfer to thread a way through the complex and involved titles to land and scraps of land, which exist in Great Britain, is a difficulty peculiar to an old country which has been settled for generations-, and where all sorts of in tricate claims, interests, and accrued " lights" have gathered like heathens on l wall Atistialmns had none of these obstacles to contend with when de vising or attempting to devise, an ideal system of land tenure After all, the salient feature of the land question which troubled the minds of Victorian politicians, when the land legislation era may be said to have commenced in earnest was the "big estate' Sentiment lent a powerful stimulus to the agitation against carrie holdings in the hands of monopolists, and in the days when Convention principles" were still considered worth fighting for, this very estate, which was peacefully " bursted up' on Wednesday, was incessantly referred to as a shocking example of monopoly) The land was good land, than) people would have been glad to own it, but by a combina- tion of circumstances it happened to belong to one man Here, indeed, we have the land question, since shortly after the flood, in a nutshell It is not necessary, however, to go quite so far back, not even to inquire why the Cororooke estate did after all continue to weather the storm, and why it remained until the other day in bursted up " It was always the contention of certain sober and unpretending observers in this colony, that whether "big estates were in ear or a boon to the community, we might look for them partition 01 subdivision sooner or later, without the intervention of an j compulsory hw what soever Not only in the Westerners fact, but throughout the colony generally, similar conditions, adverse to the retention of large masses of land in single hands, may be expected to bring about similar results It would be very absurd to call upon the Legislature to intervene, for the purpose of preventing the sale and subdivision of the Cororooke estate, and on the other hand the attempt to prohibit certain men from buying and owning more than a certain number of acres of land has been, and is always likely to be a failure. Although there is a vast difference between the conditions of land tenure in these i colonies and the existing con- actionable Great Britain, certain causes tend in both countries to the subdivision of large estates held by single females 01 Milgie individuals into smaller holdings Ninety-nine long lishmen out of a hundred still leave their kind by will to their eldest sons, although recent letter lation has practically made the testamentary disposal of real estate as free is the disposal of consul. In spite of the sentimental desire to keep large estates together in Great Britain, the length of time during which landed propel ty remains in one family depends very much on whether the inheritor be a man who knows how to manage it on sound business principles, or whether he be a spendthrift, who will quickly make ' ducks and drakes! of it by not and extravagance 'The temptation to squander a fine inheritance is very strong if a man yield to it his land comes into the market, if, on the other hand, he manages his property prudently, the community grins, as it does when any other business of enterprise is prudently carried on Much the same might be said of landowning in this colony, except that the sentimental motive for keeping an estate to gether is much weaker here The sale of land at Cororooke seems to have been the result of a family arrangement for the division of a piece of property which had got unmanageable large, and which the present owners could not see their way to make use of The purchasers of lots on Wednesday thought they could make use of the land to advantage, and this difference." of opinion" may always be to listed to burst up unwieldy estates in "Victoria without the intervention of acts of Parliament TI of discussion on the unused roads in the Assembly, was a chapter of accidents indisposition prevented Mr L'LEAN from proceeding with his address in the last instance, and apparently did not allow him to make an effective whip on his own account after w aids the motion that the grass on unused roads at present taken for nothing should be paid for in the future, was only negatived 15 mu votes, and Mr ¡suivi«, Mr iviuiuio and Mr M IN ty in stated yesterday evening that if they did know that a division would be taken, they would have re maimed and their presence would line come cried the majority into a imminent The first is to be regretted, more especially is, according to the rules of the House, there can be universal of the decision this session the proposal itself is not new, and the opposition to it always presents some a remarkable for tures According to Mr A T Co 5 h, Mr LANCEt I, Mr Ever INS and other civic authorities, the grass on unused country roads ought not to be utilised It is ilk g ii, this school of politicians say, for sheep or cattle to give upon the same and though tim trespass goes m, and is, in fact, an u culable so long as sheep are possessed of mouths and appetites, jotthoj heroically declare that they will not soon done the pr ill ice by taking payment Next come in a class of electors who was er that if the yass were yearly) sold the 10 his would never be recovered As ten times the area of the roads is let on annual grazing licence, and is recovered without difficulty without the ghost of a dispute -Ihcio ear seat can) be said to be much force in the contention And there is the unusual? uicuinstnnec that this particular objection comes from the ch tensions of land nation dilation Iii QUICK, for instance, who declares that, once put fund under licence, and it is gone for ever, formerly used as in exponent of the doctrine that the state can put with the whole of its domain to agriculturists on long in ises and eau resume possession a pea name Possibly the member for S mdliiirst has seen the error of his ways I e are said to notice such a conversion. the change is creditable to the intelligence of the convent but it must be pointed out that there is no necessity to rush to the other extreme, and to maintain, in the face of facts, that the state cannot venture to grant i Jie cIOUS annual bourne to graziers lion out of, the c IUSC of common sense has never been so near to i acted) as it has on the occasion and, as time rolls on, the fact that £45 000 j cr annum is to be is id for the skirt,, will i thinly make more men into impression upon local bodies water main made to main on li deserts count no member is more sure of asc authories House than Mr MLJ AN and rainfall >po to conger with the li in next j car on the success which he so easy obtained in the present session.

Colonel Smith, having reconnoitred the position in his first move against the Minister of lands found himself, later in the evening prepared for another and more determined eli arte against the hon gentleman Sufficient electricity to make the proceedings hvelvwasgeneratedbyMr Bent who declared that the Minister had sold lands at a quarter of their value to Government supporters without competition Mr M Intyre asked the Premier to note the accusation, and when Mr Service requested Mr Bent to repeat it he heard a much milder criticism than was first uttered. Disappointed at the chance of filing the hon member to a definite charge of corruption, Mr Service eulogised Mr lucLers administration, and declared that no predecessor had excelled him in honesty and incorruptibility Colonel Smith thereupon took up the attack, and asserted that, against the protests of the city council or Ballarat West, Mr Tucker sold to Mr Baker a piece of land without competition at one fourth of its value " And it I can't prove it before a select committee III resign my seat "I accept the challenge, retorted Mr Baker the committee was evidently very much amused, and not a bit abashed at the disclosure Colonel Smith resumed his seat looking warm and Mr Baker w cut down to the table, took a long cooling draught from the ice bowl, and then, standing close up to the colonel, opened his reply shortly and deliberately His struggles to appear composed were diverting but when he began to illustrate his remark! s by agitated gestures close to the colonel s face Mr | XI Entire suggested that he should move [ further off The hon. member concluded his statement with a proposal to throw up his seat and never re-enter the House should he be proved not to have told the truth, I if the colonel will do the same I will prove all I have said replied Colonel Smith ' Ah, ha' exclaimed Mr Baker, ' you see he won t accept the challenge After the explanation Mr Patterson, Mr M Lellan and Mr Harper, in turn, expressed the opinion that there was nothing in the charge, and the matter dropped The charge against the Minister of Lands in Mr Baker s case related to the sale of a strip of land to that gentleman it was not explained by Colonel Smith, so that Mr Baker had to be relied on for the circumstances of the transaction the piece and joined his freehold property, and was only 5ft in width It ran along officer holding and in 1851 Mr Yt Madden, who was then Minister of Lands held an inquiry to ascertain if the owners interested might be allowed each to purchase the piece next his or her allotment There was a resolution on the records of the Legislative Assembly preventing reserves being interfered with and Mr Madden in the face of that did not like to sell the land But he made a minute that if the reservation were removed, Mr Bal or and his neighbours were entitled to divide the stun the Ballarat Connell were opposed to the sale and a tenant of theirs was permitted to occupy the land for two years "Vii Tucker then carried out Air Madden a recommendation, and sold the strip to Mr Baker and the others. When the case was dealt with 111 1881, Mr Baker was not in Parliament He had, in fact, just previously unsuccessful!) opposed Mr Madden it a general election Mr Madden, niter "Vii Bakers specen list mehr, explained his action in the matter and after a little further discussion, the committee proceeded with other business.
