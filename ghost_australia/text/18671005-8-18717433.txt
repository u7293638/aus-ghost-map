DREAMLAND. Tho power whioh in our waking moments is employed in correcting tho reports of the various semes by comparing them with one another, in examining tho evidence of all tho impressions mado on tho mind, and testing thom by tho analogy of its past experience, appears in sleep lo bo, in most case?, totally suspended.

Dr. Grogory relates of himself that, having once occasion to apply a bottle of hot water to his feet when bo retired to bed, he dreamed that he was ascending the side of Mount Etna, nnd that ho found the heat of tho ground almost insuffer- able. Persons who havo had a blister applied to thoir heads havo been known to drouin of being scalped by a party of North American Indians. Such aro some of tho well-known phenomena of dreams, but there aro others even yet moro startling-Casscll's Family Paper.
