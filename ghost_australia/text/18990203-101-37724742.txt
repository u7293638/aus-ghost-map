OUR SERIAL STORY. A QUIET LODGER. BY DOROTHEA GERARD, Author of " Lady Baby," " An Arranged Mar- riage," &c.;, &c.; (Copyright). [PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.] (Conclusion.) Ned did look about, with the result that the early summer brought a new inmate to the cottage. This was a Mrs. Brown, a brown-eyed, sweet-faced brun- ette, whose gentle voice and modest bear- ing impressed Mrs. DnVnart most favour- ably at first aight. Nor was the impres- sion a merely transitory one, for, as the weeks advanced, the old lady was fain to acknowledge to herself that not only in the particulars 'of being childless and. dogless, but in every other point as well Mi's. Brown entirely fulfilled her idea of " a quiet lodger." Not only did she give no. trouble at. all, but even ber tastes seemed lo correspond most fortunately with -íbjose of Mrs. .ÏHnnart. Besides being, juéi^-as fond 'of - gardening as the old lady, she turned; «ut to be familiar with several newirie of brochet etitdhes andi beet of all* possessed a i^arkable capability!for listening ' for-hours at a time to storiés pf the defunct Mr. Bin nart's sayings and doings, as well as to anecdotes dating from tue; nursery, days 1 of Amelia and Ned. . . - - : It was only in answer to questions that she ever spoke about herself, and What she then told Mrs. Dinnart was calculated to raise ber yet more in that lady's estimation. The daughter of -a distinguished, but impecunious officer, shè . bad married at seventeen, by. the wish pf ber patients, a man much older than herself. When she awoke to'the reality of her situation it was too late to do anything but console herself with the thought that she had saved her family from starvation. . Although she did not say BO, it was pretty clear to Mrs. Din bart that Mr. Brown's death bad been rather a deliverance than a- loss to the young girl-widow, who at 23 stood alone in the world.. It was not likely that she would.stand aloné for very long,, reflected Mrs. .Din- nart, as she gazed upon tbe^^h young face. JBÎrs..

Brown came so thoroughly up to her standard in every point that, before a fortnight bad elapsed, Mrs. Dinnart, whpse likings were as rapidly:and~ as'violently formed, as her diilikings, actually inquired after ber lodger e Christian name, and from this point onward, * Elsie *' counted jio more as a lodger, but rather ranked as b, sort of daughter. Why should she not become lier daughter in reality ? The idear came -to Mrs. Dinnart one fine June afternoon, as she sat with her crochet-work. among the rose bushes, watching Elsie Brown Irasily weeding a flower bed. .ft was rather a bold idea in the. circumstances, but so long as Ned' had not actually married . that qtíieÍL'^oifr/<^jee^ona»te widow there was still room for hope.

Tbis^was exactly the opening fihe inquired and for fire consecutive minutes; there poured from -her lips on uninterrupted hymn of praise, of which the subject was Mi's. Brown, lied listened coolly, light- ing a cigar the while, for they /were strolling about the garden. " And she's not only an angel but also s beautiful angel," waa Mrs. Dinnsrt's cloping sentence. " You never saw such eyes ks ehe has, and the heart of a child with , iL all ! You never did a better'" stroke of business, Ned, than when you procured tue this lodger ! "....... . " It almost seems so," assented Ned, a littíe drily. " But I say, mother, aren't you' laying"'bri the colours a trifle too thick P'" . 7 '"Wait till you see her!" was Mrs. Din nart'e triumphant rejoinder. But when be did see her, which was immeditately after dinner, Mrs, Dinnart had to own to a feeling of dissapoint ment. Ned did not seem the least astonished hy the beauty of the young widow; neither could the anxious mother catch his eye-resting upon her even once dtiring the whole course of dinner. It wa.s still more disappointing when that same evening he announced his intention of returning to town next day. Since his mother had recovered, there was no further reason for wasting so much busi- ness time in the country." ~ ?' But Ned, you can't mean that !" cried MrsV Dhinart, aghast. "I- have told Mi*s. Brown "that you are staying for a week, and it would look sa rude. What do you think of her, by-the-by? Is she not lovely P" * ' Not bad looking,'' replied "Ned? with heattrrending equanimity1.

" Well,« yes," Éhe whispered, almost inaudibly ; " since you have guessed it I will not deny that Ned, I mean Mr. Din- nart, has made a great impression on hie, and that I don't think I shall ever bs able to forget bim again." ?.She calls bim Ned," noted Mrs, Din- nart, mentally. *' Its gone further than I I supposed." !

" Leavèveverytb'ing to me !" was Mrs. Dinnart's comprebeusive reply, and líe* youd that she declined to go. A very few days later Ned was back at the cottage, and apparently rather put put at these repeated summonses. v*'Waat Ja the matter now, mother P" ,he asked,, the nioment they^vrere alone. You haven't bad another attack, have;' yon? Ia the business talk to come of this time?". . ' ' But if was another sorb pf talk which Mrs. Dinnárt intended to have to-day,; for she had made up her mindto à some- what desperate course of action^ Her anxiety to secure the daughter-iu-law on which she had' set ber heart, and by so doing to save Ned from the clutches of that other " person " whose image haunted her like a bad dream, bad for the moment overcome all scruples, and the result was that this unconscientious . old woman violated the confidence of the young one, and then and there told Ned of the impression he had produced on her model lodger, pleading ber cause with all the warmth of her nature, and not forgetting to mention that Mr. Brown bad left Mrs. Brown very com- fortably off indeed. Ned did not interrupt her once while she spoke, but busied himself with pul- ling _of£ single leaves of the Canadian vine, near him-:for this interview was tabing place, too, in the summer-house and keeping his face turned away from his mother. She waited breathless for bis answer. " This in very flattering," be observed at last in an" inscrutable voice. Then he t'aused for a moment and appeared to e reflecting. \- " And would it really make you happy if ? married your lodger ?" fae inquiï£d presently,-still busy with the vine leaves. He was assured of this fact in a torrent of glowing language. *' But you most let me think over it." "Notfor long, Ned, I implore; just think of her suspense! Ah, there she comes herself by the ivy walk; she will -have to pass by here. I will escape from the other side, and leave you to hare it out:-with -her alone." And before he could even utter a protest the active little woman had slipped out by the door and disappeared-in the direction of the house. For.a füli;hVlffhour Mrs. Dinnart waited in. her sitting-room With fast heating heart, wondering what was go- ing on in the summer-house, and jealously watching the garden entrance... .. At-length, with a . joyful exclamation shé - started to her feet. From the .direction pf the summer-house Ned was to be seen approaching, and within bis arni lay the -delicate"white hand of her protégé, whue^fae looked down into ..her farand sbe-up into his in a manner in whtcb it is Only legitimate -for engaged ixä^iPb^ß^y^'''-i - V-- ' g--.' v---- f íviíbfaW Plnnaii' paid One of 'fier periodical visite -to to wn,"!

I warned you against last year !" ; "Mrs. Harrison J" echoed the visitor -aghast. " Nothing of the, sort ! It is a Mrs. Brown whom Ned is engaged to." 1 " Harrison-Brown -yes that's the name. I daresay she found it more con- venient' to drop" "the first part, when making your acquaintance.1' " But that one was called Bessie, and this one's name ie Elsie."_ ? " Whichjs short for Elizabeth, just as. ' Bessie is. "Ï happen, to Icnow that Mrs. Harrison's name is Elizabeth." A terrible light rose -on Mrs Binnari, but jt'was "bnly terrible for a moment; in the next, already she had sunk back in her chair, overcome by the humour of the situation, which now burst full upon her, and was rolling gently from side to side in á fit bf uncontrollable laughter. And the more she laughed the lighter her heart- grew" With the certainty that .now,the ghost of that terrible Mrs. Harrison, who had haunted ber dreams so long, was laid at last and for ever. " Well you have made a pretty fool of me between you," she was saying, an -hour later, gleefully to Ned who replied with bis usual equanimity: "I told you it would .all come right in the end, mother didn't If " And thus it was that, for once, both Ned and his mother got their own way.
