A Ghost Story. OF A MOST LIKELY KIND. A party of people had been telling ghost stories, the ghosts in every case being ac-<*> counted for in some matter-of-fact way which aroused the laughter of the listeners when" the story came to an end. At last the host was asked for his contribution. " I saw a ghost cote," 'he admitted, " and although it's a good while elnce I've thought of it I can well remember my fright. " I was a boy about twelve years old, and I had been off fishing all day. I stopped to take supper at my uncle's farm on thfe way home, and after supper went out to the barn with my cousin Sim white he did the milking. then Sim and I sat down in the hayloft for a while discussing some plan, I. have forgotten what, and It was dusk before I started .on my lonely walk home. " I had never known what it was to be afraid, but I did remember as I started down the long lane close to the grave-yard that some foolteh girls had said ghosts walked In that lane after dark. " Just after I had turned Into the lane I saw wnat seemed to be a shadowy figure wtadklng, or rather flitting, a short distance In front of me.' Involuntarily I lagged a ttttle ; the shadowy figure sermed to do the same. " Then I hastened my steps, and still the flitting figure in shadowy garments kept be fore me, at exactly the same distance. Iff spite of myself I began to» ftM frfghteneOV' and when I lunied Mt of the lab* on to the .lentltsst stretch of road aaj wlissm ab*ussand saw the hovering figure still beV foirfcmfe thte perspiration started out on my forehead in beads. * " I ask up a damp Hand to _a still damper _or«jße*4» and brushed away ar wisp of nay ■hfeh had been hanging froarxty hat-brim of my ey«~ * 1 saw no*more of my ■osfjy eompantott, it is needless to say, ■td Umm so ashamed of myself that it was ■/ears before I could make up my mind to tell such a Joke on myself."
