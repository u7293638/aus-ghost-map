? . , ; Tolo ?r à Dbtbctit». When I was a lad of seventeen I was office boy for Pink«rton's Philadelphia Detective Agency, and was just wild, of eourse,-to "bejaent out on a case. Eveiy time the Gaptain got a new case I wbuld ^ideup to.Mniîayid say. 'Cap'n, you'd better let me «Mi «»n tlife case,' and he would answer with a quiezical grin, îMôt'th^ïânïfe» Harry. Wait till the next ease.* Along in December of that year there was a great rush of business at our office. Wè "had fifteen detectives, all old, and experienced hands, arid they were on duty night and day. We jcoùld not handle all tb,»' WsiriépR' tî'at yas^cominç. în, and the C-1 >tain was' tvisliing iv<? ff?d ioine more' t remembpi; -asO-»ell, as. can be, ^ègr. dùûy-ÏBS^é and the Captain calling out ïuh frorii : his privât^ office, ' I ^ess we'U hftve to let .you take ttien'ex^ cas^ Hafry.' : Haidly had he said foewords when the dooir opened, and a raw old-countryman entered. He provèd to be Joe Baylis, AiMontgomery couiMy^uâtjce theRestée, ahd:he wanted the Capjiin to SMÎd d&u;àk. daw» witKiiim to 4ttfend : to a ghost who was cutting didoes at' Fort "Washington.' {Thè^Gapï^in told him. he would send à man '-iabwIr^aB soon'as- he had one àt his disposaL - The old fellow left and I jumped to my-feet. I said, send .me on ? that The Captai" leaned back in his chait and looked-at me hard; • ' See here, Harry,' he said, ' suppose •I were to send you what would you dô Y . I outlined an elaborate plan of -campain against the ghost. ;. He -let me finish, and* then stud— • . 'Now, I'll let you go and try your hand! Don't make a fool of yourself. If you see the ghost and think you can't handle it, lie doWn and follow it and see who it is.' The Captain gave me money and .away I went. I felt pretty brave for it was bright daylight then, but there weré times when I wished myself well out of the thing. I got to Fort Washington about three o'clock, and I enquired the : way to the haunted house from thë; station agent. I found it on a hill .about half a mile from town, and looked it over with interest and apprehension. : It.-was an old white-framed mansion, standing in park-like grounds, with plenty of outhouses about'it. About dusk I stole down to the deserted house, and it was dark when £ got there. I -slid along the wall to the outhouse, crept cautiously in, and shut the door again. Hardly had I shut the door when I knew that there was some other person in. that outhouse. I felt sure that there was somebody close to my elbow. I was trembling like a leaf, but I managed to pull a match from my. pocket and strike it. I held it up. It showed me a big white muffled figure not two feet away. Then the match .went out. - . Wàs I scared Î Well, now, I should say so. I shut my eyes, and grabbed for the ghost. I was so , frightened I seemed to lose consciousness for a:moment, but grabbed something and held on. When the first shock passed, I felt the .ghost tugging and pulling to gét away from me. It seemed as badly frightened as I was, and its hands were soft and warm. ' Don't hurt me,' it said in a terrified voice. . I had .no voice, to.reply, with. I was choldng. I pulled my captive out on the lawn, and looked at it in the moonight. The sheet that had been muffled about the figure fell to the ground—a pretty girl of fifteen was disclosed. I was in. cold perspiration, and shaking as if recovering from a shock of electricity ; but when I saw that I had caught a real genuine flesh and blood girl I began to feel better, and was presently able to talk. . ' Who are you ?' I asked. >' Jennie Baylis.' « What ! The daughter of Joe Baylis?' ' Yes, sir.' ' What are you doing this for ?' The girl began £0 cry. She had not meant any harm. She and her sister had played ghost just to.have some fan. Her sister was qsually with her, but she did not come this night, as she was too bu$y. She had heard from her father that a detective was coming, but thought he rwas not due for a day or two and resolved .to make one last appearance, and then give up the performance till things calmed down. . ' Who ace you î' she asked. ^I'm thejdetectire,':I said. She looked me over in evident awe and «onstsnation, tinged with some ftnipriseon-accouni of jny age. . •. vWhatiàrè«yon going to-;do.with me . .» î-I-shallïhave to -expose yon.' . The ;girl cried^again gnd begged to bé released and allowed to go home, but that did not suit me at al}. I said she was my prisbnerjrançl as such I must deliver her inp to the authorities, and after a great deal of waiting- she suggested that L had l»tter give her up to her Own «father, v L agreed to this, and picking up her sheet I held her arm and topk her with.me to her father's house, about amile distant.
