The Ghost's Touch. By WILKIE COLLINS, Au'hor of "Woman in White," "Jtzabal'a Daughter," &a.; r&Jl; Queensland Bights Beserved.J I. THE courflo of this narrative leads the reader on new and strange ground. It deeoribea the return of a disembodied spirit to earth—not occurring in the obscurity of midnight, hut in the searching light of day; neither seen as a vision not heard aa a voice—revealing itself to mortal knowledge through the sense which is leaat easily self deceived: the Bense that feels. The record of this event will of necessity produce conflicting impressions. It will raise, in some minds, the doubt which reaaou assert j; it will invigorate, iu other minds, the hope whioh faith justifies; aud it wi'l leave the terrible question of the destinies of man where centuries of vain investigation have left it - ia the dark. Having undertaken in the present narrative to lead the way along a succession of even s, the writer attempts no more.' It is no part of his duty to follow modern examples by thrust* ing himself and his opinions oh the pub ic view. He returns to the shadow from which he has emerged, and leaves the oppoti- g forces of in* credulity and belief to fight the old battle' over egain on ths old gronnd.
