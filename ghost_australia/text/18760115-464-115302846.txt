:.-.-,- a ,.. THE KIAMA GHOST AT LAST. '.?.?'?-???? ' (To the Editor of the Freeman's Journal.) .'?'-:-' Sir, ? The much»talked-of, lono-dreaded Kiama Ghost ia no longer a myth if what -we hear from 'beautiful Illawarra' be _ true. It nmsb have appeared there in propria, persona, Otherwise thero would not have been such a raging hubbub as thore has lately been ainmig the denizens of that far fumed district. ? The Btory goes that ' he showed' himself not many ? weeks ago to five seeUrs, since oalled collectors, at a well-known spot in the neighbourhood of Jamberoo, 'Hell Hole,' where the brethren ' Have been at daggera drawing, And ono another clapper-clawing.' Tho apparition turned the heads of most of the people of Shellharbour and Jamberoo, netting them all agog and agley for some time. Many wero the conjectures hazarded by the sanctified as to his object in coming now, but the mystery is cleared tap in the Kiama Inde pendent of the 6th instant, where we nee hiB bohesta have been strictly obeyed by the noodleo, nobodies, and know- nothinga of the district. In his last interview with the col lectors (for report says they had several at the holy tryst called Hell Hole, finding him no bogie but a warm confidential coon), he ex pressed himself to this effect : — ' Is it no' a shame fo' ye that there is a gude Samaritan leeving among ye who the other day gave a oup o' milk and water to a distinguished gentleman, a great enemy of mine ? Noo if ye love me hunt that Samaritan by 'petition,* by letters, or by hook or by crook, If ye don't, by avid clootie .'II rnak' this here hole bigger.' Yours, &c;, CRUIG BARRY,
