CRICKET. ?E3I0B CLUBS GETTING INTO F0B3L fBy Pout.] An the seven dubs which comprise the Sooth Australian Cricketing Association hate held their saausj meetings, aad several of them have already Indulged ia their preliminary DineLODenen. Tbe cuswog; sensual is aaunpaxea witu no mue int* Mat. iherewUibe no baglUh Uevea to distract sathwaiasta. aad tbe asatcbes which will take pbwe ?a ffce Adelaide aad Keusiagtou Ovalsoagbt there tote to attract more notice than they did last »ea*OB. whew, owing to pressure of international sad intercolonial matchet, tho senior teamt at one perJedof the aaaaoa were not engaged for over a Uioath. Many new faces will appear amongst tbe ?enion,aUtheclnb'k tiecreunesbavlngbtenatwork during tbe winter trying to pick np new men, with ft specially keen eye open all tbe while for bowlers. Trials oi tba new maa are now being made ia ?atebes agalmet the leading junior clubs. Several games were played oa .-ainrday afternoon, and ?trolling almost from oae end of tbe South Park Leads to the other I was able to see a good deal of nickel Tha cold wind which blew wa» aone too pleasant for cricket, yet the vast green field wa- simply alive with mea and lads ia white flannels. One turned with special interest to the game between the Kotth Adelaides and the Ramblers, beeaase Canacber, the much talked-of howUr f rem the soathicast. was participating. Petringer, warn h* woa the toss, put tbe Ramblers in, so that he might eee Cairacaer tnudle. Tho South Easterner is a flae. welUtet-ap young fellow. He bowls left arm. with a alee easy delivery. I bad understood that his pace was no more than medium, bat on Saturday he bowled at ab-ve mvium pace— perhaps it waa tbe extra pace which caused his length to bo too abort— anyhow he bowled better when he sent down slower balls. But there M plenty of lime before tbe season starts f»r bus to get-his ann into its proper swing, which be could aot expect to do on bis second day out. Tbe Bamber* exhibited eom» capital batting. After seeing tbe lithe E. O. Phillies set full sail and picturesquely catch a man (who, by-tbe-way, gave np th* ghost when he saw to whom the ball was going). I wan dered westward* until I reached th* ground where the South Adelaides were playijg th* South Dniteds, just in time to «ee Jones toot out the leg -stump erlth aa irre sistible yorker. It waa with feelings of regret that one saw tbe brothers Hack— a J. and F. $.— playing with the ju-ior team, and tbe retrograde atep they have taken must be regretted by every oae who is enxumi to senior cricket progress. The aider brother, Bart, alt booth somewhat unsuccsx*. ful lastaeason. ba«givi-n ample prom seofdeveioping into a top sawyer amongst bvunen, while a I*d who can play Joaas a* bis yonag brother did on Saturday is worth a puce in any Oval teaac. A couple of hundred yard* «way tbe Norwoods ma-l* mincemeat of a wenkith Middlesex team. Tbe game was remarkable only for tbe low ?coring of tbe junior team, the really first- ei.ias e«tcblng. and tbe excellent bowing avenges of tbe Nbrwondg, Holt's flsnres reading 60 ball*. 7 m-id*na, 3 runs, aad 3 wicker*. At Start the previous weak H At sccureit 4 wicket* for 4 runs, to tbat be has taken foil advantage of the early form ot batsmen. Of course I was unable to get to Sturt co see tbe Adelaide* eUyUtg. but on* is glad to bear that George Giffen obtained an excellent bowling average. The little finger of his tight band, which Lockwood m«i*9ed«ariyia the last te»m%tcb. is at 1 1 of aba jrvaal aize. ann the crack fear* that the joint may never be qoiv* right ag*J», bat he aacici pate* so seriou* incon venience to bi- bowling. The most satisfactory feature of tbe Austral*' escellent performance against the Kent Towns was the bat ting of young 4id. Leak, from whom the fulfilment of th* great promise he gave in 1813-94 is expected thia aeaaon. Following are tb* acores oa Satur day:— North Adelaide t. Ramblers. Bamblers.— Uasiam, c. P. Bdi. b.
