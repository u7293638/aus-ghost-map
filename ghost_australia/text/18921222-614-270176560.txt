POETRY. Peace os Earth.’ w nn ever some wrong to De ngnting, With Belf ever seeking for place, ' The world has been striving and fighting ’ Since man was evolved' ont of-space. Bold history into dark regions His torchlight has fearlessly cast; He shows ns tribes warring in legions In the jangle of ages long passed. Beligion, forgetting her station,. Forgetting her birthright from God, Set nation te warring with nation And scattered dissension abroad. Dear creeds have made men kill each other, Fair faith has bred hate and despair, And brother has battled with brother Because of a difference ihprayer. Butearth has grown, wiser and kinder, , For man is evolving a soul; From wars of an age that was blinder We rise to a peace-girdled goal. Where once men would murder, in treason, And slaughter each other in hordes, They now meet together and reason, With thoughts for their weapons, not swords. The brute in humanity dwindles And lessens as time speeds along, And the spark of divinity kindles And blazes np brightly and strong. The seer can behold in the The race that shall people the world— Strong men of a godlike existence, . Unarmed,' and with war banners furled* Ho longer the bloodthirsty savage Man’s vast spirit strength shall unfold ; And tales of red warfare and ravage Shall seem like ghost Stories of old. For the booming of guns and the rattle Of carnage and conflict shall cease, And the.bugle call leading to battle Shall change to a psean of peace. Ella Wheeler Wileon.
