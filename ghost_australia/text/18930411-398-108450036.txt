TO THE INDIVIDUALISTIC, NATIONA LISTIC, ICONOCLASTIC, DAMPU LISTIC, AND OTHER BLOOMING PAPIER MACHE ELECTORS. GENTLEMEN, I'm a candidate for Parliament, so listen to my cry. Sometimes I'm called a woman old and hoary. I go in for female voting-my breadth of view denoting, But modesty and truth "is all my eye." Tou may think me indiscreet, because I want a seat In the Senate House, where I can get free grog; The electors can go to grass, when I get mv free pass And two hundred quid to pay me for my prog. I may be a little vulgar, but thafs no fault of mine, For through life I've had to fight my weary way: Had not much time for schooling, or with grammar to be fooling, But in long words I can give points any day. Ifs a loud and crying evil, that those chil dren of the devil (The pioneers who first spied out the land), Should be allowed to pick it over-and to pass their lives in clover, While poor "cockie" gets the mallee scrub and sand. Give each unemployed a section, taken up by fiee selection, From the choicest of the cursed squatters' lease; Provide him then with ploughs, waggons, teams, and cows And a State Bank, whose issue ne'er shall cease. Never mind deposit into the bank, because it Must never be allow'd to run dry. The Single Tax I'd double, and to save all further trouble Float a fresh loan, and "wink the other eye." The Custom House burn down, make the land tax half-a-crown, From the pastoral lands alone to be col lected : Cast the Governor adrift, and if the Pre mier wants a, lift, Why the great " I am" of Frome can be selected. In polities I'm a dab, the rich man's land I'd grab Great Caesar's Ghost! wouldn't it be fun: No more need for brains, if I only get the reins. And now my friends I've finished.
