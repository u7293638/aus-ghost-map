"" Ve Melbourne Hunt Club Teetin?. B1 Although the weather was dull sr » B threatening in the morning, the MelbonJ K iduntCmb were fortunate in having n u? it ' pleasant afternoon for their annual Births? K Meeting, which passed off sueces<fniJ I K Flemington, Thursday. The racing was fabl B interesting, and considering the many c3dDi» B attractions, there was a moderated J2 B attendance. Tbe course and all jt8 R ronnaings looked fresh and green, while tl B running track, although, perhaps, a triS B holding, was in excellent order. As qui B tbe racing was inaugurated with the Hurdle B Race, for which six out of the eight horea B coloured on the card faced the starter, ft H race was run at a good pace throuahout B resulted in a win for Stormbird after a B perate finish with Merry Maid, tie B favourite, Wild Harry, being a poor' third B Fifteen horses started for the Queen's Birth A day Stakes, to r which Verdure was most fl fancied, but the wiener turned up in EgerJoo fl a speedy colt by Bethnal Green, sad fl won, hard held, from Welcome Jack fl with Squireen third. The Steeplechase fl proved a chapter of accidents, and resulted ia fl an easy victory for Vaulter ; Biack Jacket, fl who made neatly all the running, being the fl only other hoise who got round without as fl accident. The Corinthian Flat Race fumishtd fl an excellent contest, and many thought that fl King Charles had won, and this belief was to I some extent verified by the hoisting of that H horse's number. Subsequently, "however, I after Borne confasion, the numbers were I altered, and tbe victory accorded to Lidding. 1 ton, while King Charles was placed third 1 only.
