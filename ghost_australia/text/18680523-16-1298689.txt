AN UNFORTUNATE FEMALE. rnoJt episodes in the life or miss Sawada TBEXOOME. MY cousin lives up a little creek lukes they are culled here-on the Devonshire side of the Tamar, and of course I thought the right way to got to it was to walk across the bridge But, bless you, no The very first step I take a man starts up and says, " Ma'am, you can't go this way" "What' can a bridge made to be walked over '" I asked. " This bridge isn't, contain , it's made only for the trains " That's a mighty sensible arrangement, young man," I answer, as provoked as an owl in daylight " Here's a bridge joining two counties, and a side walk no consequence to directors, with company's money like dirt And yet respectable people are to drown, 01 stay in Cornwall for over Dear me" I said, working myself up a bit, " anyone would think a Cornishman was to have his head cut off, if he went into Devonshire, just us he had in King Egbeit's days " " Not at all, ma'am," says the man, quite civil ' You might have passed over in the train as safe as the Queen herself " "I must have gone to Devonport then," I answered, cooling down, and that would be six miles out of my) way I'm going to Tavytrec " "There's no conscience to be had here, ma'am, you had better have gone to Devonport, and taken a fly " " Tavy tree is only two miles from this, lean walk that distance, and save my shillings Only I must cross the river first," I said, as sweet as I could speak "I'm sure you'll have no objection to let me over the bridge You don't wish to see a lady di own herself, I suppose ?" " I hope not, ma'am But as for the bridge, ma'am, its impossible, and most on my place is is 01 th A boat will take you over for a shilling, or if you wait for the steam ferry boat, which crosses every half hour, you can go by that for a penny It's because of the ferry, ma'am, we are bound to let no passengers cross the bridge Special clause in the Act, ma'am, to protect the interest of ferry people " " Since that's the case," said I highly indignant, " that ferry shall never see a penny of mine as long as there's a bucketful of sea round the Land's End " Upon which, wishing the young man good evening, I walked down to the river edge and called for a boat "It's very muddy walking in the ratios after you've crossed, ma'am," said the boatmen, " leave alone it's being very lonesome for a hun protected lady I'll take you Eight up to Tavy tree quay for eighteenpence, ma'am, and 110 thing to four with a man with you all the way, ma'am" "Ah, well'" I thought to myself, " there's nothing like having a man with one, after all I'll close with this proposition We started immediately I was quite calm and tranquil having 1 man with me, and I must say, while we kept to the Tamar, I had a beautiful time The water was smooth as crystal, and though the night was dark, yet since there was nothing to be afraid of-no steamers bustling about, 01 lary barges rolling along like por poises 111 liquor dark 01 light mattered little But when we turned into lavished like, this being much narrower than the Tamar, and the banks very high and wooded, I certainly did wish the days were a bit longer 0 even a lantern would lins 0 been cheerful "Tasytico lake has got a very cranky channel," I said to the man "I suppose you know it pretty well'" "All right, ma'am," says the man And he passed on without an other word " Don't ii Iget," is my motto If you are under a man's cure, leave him alone , don't pull the reins out of his hand, and pi 0 tend you can drive better than he, because the chances are you can't Acting up to my motto, I don't suppose that I could row, 01 understand the tide, better than the boatman It was did her than I liked, but he said nothing, and I said nothing, till at last the boat bumped 11 bit, and then stopped " Why don't you go on ?" I said, s ely eivill) "We are stuck, ma'am" " Stuck '" " In the mud, ma'am, and the tide is coming down very fast " " If it is 1 nuning first, it may take the boat with it, I remarked " Mme likely to leave her high and dry, ma'am , leastways, unless I can push riot oil" "Then push her off, by) all means" Hasting a man with me, of course I did not feel in the least alarmed, but I was certainly a little shocked when he divested himself of shoes and stockings right before my eyes then clambered over the side of the boat and disappeared bodily I screamed "No harm done, ma'am, the water is rather deep this side, that's all I'll find the channel, and got the boat in it in a jiffy On howent, taking soundings on his way with a pole It was so dark by this time, that he had not taken three steps before hobccainoinvisible At first I heard a good deal of floundering, but at last that died as a) in the distance, and all was quiet Fifteen minutes went by, and the boat got rather one sided, with a queer inclination to tip over Still I was placid nothing can go wrong when an unprotected female bus a man to take care of her Never theless, when half an hour slipped on, and there was not a sound to break the stillness, and no signs of a man, I grew nervous "It may be pleasant to have a man with one, but I don't know that it's pleasant to have a drowned man," I said to myself, "especially if this drowned man goes bobbing around ' all night while I sit in this boat Of course I must sit here all night, if he doesn't 1 star 11 And in the morning, when his corpse goes floating by, I shall have to catch it and tie a string to it, and how it came to his wife That's good enough , but how do I know that I sha'n't be accused of killing him Who is to prove I didn't' I can the a witness for my self I know exactly how the newspapers will put the case ' A weak man, home of one foot, is seen to depart in the darkness with a muscular and one female I am sorry, I don't deny it and this man is never seen again alive But in the morning the audacious murderess returns to Saltash, towing the body of her victim, attached by her scarf and pocket handkerchief to the boat, and tells the incredible tale that the man has drowned himself Her story is, that he deliberately) flung himself from the boat, and svontonfootthroughthorisei, and she affirmed she never saw him again, till his dead face bobbed up before her eyes, at six this morning We leave this incredible statement to the comments of our readers. For ourselves we assert that no man should quit bott to walk up a river, and no lads, worthy of the name, should remain 111 an open boat all night No' this female Pathan has murdered that poor, lame, harmless man, and, in the name of Man, we demand justice'" This was the sort of paragraph that would appear, and I felt myself got damp at I thought of it. At this instant a faint voice reached mt, gradually developing into frantic cries of-" Hoy ' boy ' boat there ' ' "Boatthore'" I said to myself "Of course the boat 12 bet 0 and it's tipping over more and more, to" "Boit' Hoy, ma'am' Boat'" It was impossible for me to condescend to make any reply to this nonsense But the caus only grew more frantic from my silence "Boat' hoy' Holler, round' hotter'" "Hollow" I observed "It's my private opinion the boat won't be hollow much longer, for if she tips a little more shell fell" "Holler, ma'am' I can't see nothing ' I can't find the boat ' Roller, for more s sake '" O, I understand the matter now' The poor man had lost the boat in the darkness, and had been wading and floundering up and down the river all this time in search of it. Of course I believed immediately, only I didn't t quite know how to do it "Ah' Ah Ah O'H said very genteely "Holler, ma'am' hotter' I'm getting the cramp'" Upon this I stood up-the boat tipped dreadfully-and cried out, more genteely, O O' O' Ah'" "Boat there' I'm most done' Holler' or can't you show something white'" Good heavens' show something white' Was the horrid man mad ' Ah I would wave my handkerchief lines was getting exciting and romantic I would do a noble deed , I would wave my handkerchief, and 6 ive the man's life I saved it A great splash-a floundering-a gasps bubbling then a choked voice, desperate 'Boat' boat Holler" for life's sake, boiler'" I dropped my handkerchief, I dropped my gentility, and I " hotter ed," ay, and like a boatswain, too I did more I showed something white The man's life was at stake, and mine-for if he drowned I should hang M) petticoat was of dimity, ironed and starched that morning, it glistened, it gleamed like a beacon, the drowning man sow who had not the least idea in the world what it was and made for the boat When he reached it, gasping and trembling, I was a modest mass of dark drapery-not a ray of white about me. And he p silly cry was not grateful, but then I confess he asked no questions Thus do woman's noblest sacrifices ever remain Rubicon, un- appreciated by man ' Unconscious of my devoted met, this man sat down, wet as a shed, and blowing like a porpoise, not uttering a word of thanks His first sentence was over a reproach ' Why didn't you holder before, ma'am? I've come near being drowned" "My good man, I did hold " I answered with dignified calm " Now, why don't you got the boat off stones?' "Because I can't, ma'am And if I could, there's no water to float her higher up " " The fact is, you don't know the channel," said I, Severely "Couldn't find it in the dark, ma'am And if I could one man's strength wouldn't shoved the boat into it off this mud " Then what is to be done?" I asked with a little scream, as the boat went right over on her side, neatly tilting me into the man's lap "We can't do- nothing but sit here till five o'clock to morrow morning, by that time I reckon the tide 11 got her off" " What sit here in this stick in the mud boat all night with you I shrieked, " that's impossible " Good gracious, I thought, bore a a position form in protected female' sitting up till five in the morning, in pitch darkness, up a lonely creek, with a boatman' O, this is nice, this is 10 spoetable '-this is having a man to take care of one, this is I had better have let the creature drown himself "If you won't sit here till high tide, what'll you do, ma'am ' ' said the man "What will I do? I'll wade the liver," I answered "You will, ma'am" he cried " Well, I must say you are a plucky one " He bent forward towards me, and shook the wet off himself upon my tea green silk I held myself very stiff, in order to let him see that I wanted no admiration "Now, my good man," I said, "interstate" At the same time I prepared myself to show boldly my white dimity, my scarlet stockings, and Balmoral boots "La bless you, ma'am, you can't wade yet, you <? must wait a hour at least, the tide can't low enough you'd be drowned now" " Very well, I'll wait an hour " I said this with the composure of a martyr The boat was very much on one side I sat on the high 01 tilted side, the man moved over to the same bench I pro- tended not to see him, this appealed to me the most proper mode of noticing his conduct. "Beg pardon for sitting so near you, ma'am, but I m feared she is go quite over if I stays other side Don't want to capsize her, you see " " Sit where you please," I responded. After this there was a dignified silence of ten minutes, then I know by the sprinkles that reached me the man was getting fidgety, and shaking out his garments as it were to the night. "If you please, ma'am, may I as-" I coughed as loud as I could to discourage him-" as a favor of you *" "My goodman, tina is really not a time-" " Seems to me, ma'am, 'tis the very time 'this uncommon lonesome and dark here, and I'm as cold as a lump of ice 'most Tivould want me a bit, if you did not mind it, ma'am" "Why did I boils'' I said to my. self "Why didn't I let this man dr own. I should feel more comfortable if he was a corpse tied on to the stem than I do now " " Please, ma'am, I wouldn't ax if I hadn't got the shivers And Some ladies don't objeek-leastways my wife never does " "Perhaps not," I said drily I really could not tell how to keep up conversation with this man " And it's a very small pipe, ma'am, and good bakker and I'll sit as far off as I can without capsizing the boat, ma'am" " There, there," I answered, "not a word more, sure of if you like " He smoked and by the light of the glowing weed I saw his eye fixed on me with a droll expression Was he wondering whole I kept my purse? was he thinking how easy it would be No, this was not a land of they os and sharpers, I would banish auch London fancies from my mind He finished his pipe, knocked the ashes out, put it in his pocket, then jumped over the side of the boat This time he returned in a few minutes. " I think the water is low enough now, ma'am ; I've sounded it all along to the bank If you. are less serious about trading, I believe you can go safe " I looked into the river, running on in black darkness, and I felt a little bit of a shiver Not that I was in aid O dear, no " Must I lordly either evade or sit here till five o'clock?" I asked "Why, you see, ma'am, the tide has been running down three hours; it'll be on the turn about half water one, and I reckon there won't be water enough in this here creek till nigh upon five-" "Enough , I'll go I tucked up my tea green silk, I tied my shawl tightly around me I put one foot outside the boat "Tis answer pity," said the man ; " them nice boots-and knee deep the mud is quite I ain't so not as I was, ma'am, and if you don't mind my back being in a way moist, and if you put both arms round my neck tight, and hold on hard, I think I could do it " I looked up the river and down-all was darkness , a glimmer of starlight on the water making us but dimly visible to each other-of course it was ridiculous and horrid-ofcouise if it were daylight it would be impossible , but in this pitch darkness, and the respectable Mrs. Grundy slumbering fall away, and the river so muddy and cold, and all my things would be spoiled mightn't I act like a sensible woman and I put my around the man's neck. " I am not very heavy, and you'll promise to be carefully said "I'll be as fearful as though you was a babby " We started-I, Tabitha Trcnoodlo, with my arms round a man's neck for the first time in my life, And I must confess I could not consider the thing in itself at all pleasant My hands were clasped beneath his chin and I felt it would be more convenient if my feet could be there too, for my boots dangled in a remarkably unpleasant way, and shrinking them up from contact with the river gave me the camp for a few paces all went well, then I felt a sudden giving way of my supporter on one side, and my right stocking went into the water " You aren't clinging half tight, ma'am. Hold me round the neck close as chokes please ' Waa I come to this Well ' after all, I am not a Mrs Squeamish, and it's useless to fidget I held him tighter But now there was a giving way on the other side and my hit stocking went into the river-deep. Another moment there was a giving way altogether , but feeling the catastrophe coming, sprang off my pillar of support on to a mudbank, just as he himself dis- appeared bodily down a hole The water was nearly to his neck, but with my help he scrambled out, and stood by my side dripping. " I missed my soundings then," he said "Do you think you could manage to hold on again, ma'am?" he added, presenting his back with great politeness ' No, boatman, I could not. 111 trust to my ears feet this time " The poor man was profuse in his sorrow, but he was there, and he had staggered painfully beneath the weight I felt it would be cruelty to animals to put such a load on him again And besides I couldn't be much madder than I was. Time thinking I stopped boldly into the river, following my conductor, who, taking soundings, and warning us of danger, walked before We crossed safely By the bye, did Julius Caesar wade the Rubicon 5 If so did, I admire him but if he went in a boat I really don't see why his boastful exclamation of having passed the Rubicon should come down to posterity with so much fuss Well, we were on the Tavytreo side, landed safely among the rushes, but O, the pilgarhck I was walking behind the man had given me full liberty to protect the white dimity and the tea green silk, but the rest of me would have astonished a flounder " What are we to do next Con we walk along the river side '" No, the mud was too deep, and in some places, where the channel was narrow, the water was too deep Devonshire and Cornish rivers-always tidal-do not resemble the streams of the midland counties, the banks are high, rocky, wooded, and the course of the river can usually only be followed above cliff. This was the case here, so there was nothing: for it but to mount the rocks and get into the wood above If the river was dark, the wood was a chimney, only blacker, and no soot The man by my side might have been on the monu- ment as far as I could see him "Have you. been in this hero wood before, ma'am '" he said in a frightened voice " Often I know my way in it well enough by day, and even by night if I could get into the path It runs through. the centre" "In that case, ma'am, you must go straight upwards, and we shall be sure to strike it " I'll try by my self You had better go back to your boat ' " No one will run away with my boat, ma'am I'll find her safe enough at five in the morning, but you 11 never got out of this year wood without a man to help you never, ma'am " It was dark as a bag I might have been tied up in one of ought I know, and the place in is horribly lonesome I confessed in my own mind that I should be afraid to take a step by myself And besides, what greater happiness can befall an unprotected fomalolimn to have a man to take care of her "I'm sure I'm much obliged to you," I said gratefully , " and my cousin, to whose house I'm going, will give you a bed, or a Beat by the kitchen fire and that will be better than sitting in your boat till the tide is high enough to take her oil " " Certainly it will, ma'am Please come along I came along and in two minutes I knocked my bonnet off against a tree, and in another minute knocked my nose, and made it bleed like price fighting " You better give me your hand, ma'am," said ray protector, "and let me lead you along " After perching myself on his back, with my arms round his neck, I felt it would be folly to refuse this and I took his hand, and went on with confidence Bang' he pulled me plump against another huge tree and I felt a big bump rise on my forehead, and knew my bonnet cap was dangling round my neck " Well, I dunno how I missed feeling of that tree, hope you won't bite, ma'am I was nearly stunned, but replied family that there was life in me yet "I reckon twill be easier to go tina w ay," said the man grubbing my hand tight, and dragging me in a dnectionfroiuTavy tree " Now he's going to show himself in his true colors Now he's going to turn out a y ii lam and murder me," I said to myself I stood still with horror, and looted my soaked boots deep as I could in the mud " I'll not go that way," I cried "But, my dear lady, we shall strike the path then, and if we keeps the course of the river we never shall, and we shall knock our brains out ago the trees in course they grows thickest by the water, and the under growth too " I don't care I won't stir a stop that way Let go my hand He immediately grasped it tighter " No, ma inn, I can't If I let's go, and you stirs honly a bench, I shall never catch you here again" 0, the blood tim sty villain' He would not give his victim even a chance for her life " Please, ma'am, can you see me?' "No man, no , no more than if you were your own ghost, I answered "No you, ma'am So you per- ceive if no less slip hands, we may go hotter- ing all night through dasyure wood like them blessed hobbies the robins was undertakers to, and yet novel lay hold to one a letter again I can't see your hand, ma'am, I declare, though I'm gripping of it " It was true that the darkness was even as intense as this, and the thought of being alone in such blackness, or of being hunted through it, made my flesh creep " There's a shimmer of light on the lake, I said in my civiles tone, "that will surely help us a little if we keep to its course " " That ain't no thing of a help, ma'am If we goes straight hup, we must strike the road, but if we keep along here we may be two lunches hot) and yet not find it" Ah' he know of some plum which he could throw me, or of some horribly lonely place "straight hup" where it tin ore could be cut, and the unpleasant body never be found " What e the good of wasting time, ma'am ? Come along'" He gave me a frightful tug with his strong hand, upon which my soaked boots gave way, and I went Five Forks forward , . then I threw my arm around a tree, and hold c on And to make it harder to him to move me, I sat down in the mud did-and spoilt my tea green silk for ever "You are very hard to help along ma'am," he said say ugly 0, you villain' Now you are beginning, are you p " My good man," I observed blandly, you are dragging me now against my will to my way, and I shall be easier to help " O my unfortunate stars ' if he would only let go my hand I'd Jun To have stopped in the boat eyes would have been better than this The man couldn't see I was sitting down in the mud ' Crikey '" he said to himself, in a very respectful manner, as he kept tugging my arm off without moving me I thought I'd try a little fierceness "Mau, I won't go'" I shocked, "I won't' How dare you pull me ? ' no turned meek directly The idea of a man being frightened of me " I'll go your way if you like, ma'am," he said, as mild as milk, " but we don't get out of the wood then till daylight And if you'll strike straight hup, ma am, 111 be spon- Kabul for the path" This was a handsome offer I reflected consented I had found I could snub the man, and I knew I could knock him down I determined to be brave I got up from the mud and unwound my arm from the tree " Very well, I'll strike up I hope you'll find the road at once " A furze bush caught my dress and tore it out of the gathers, then I hit my hand against a thorn, and scratched the flesh to the horse the man was " sponsored," and I ought to be thankful I said this to myself so often that at last I grew quite comfortable in my mind, although my dress was flutters and my bonnet flutters, and I knew my forehead was one great red bump and my nose another, and my boots were two mud pies I must say the man was kind , he warned me of branches and trunks, against which he bumped himself first and took of thefirstshock, as it were, before they hit me Inky darkness I demolish the last bit of my bonnet against a branch and nearly leave my boot in something soft But this scarcely counts for in another moment the man and 1 step off on nothing and find ourselves upon our faces in something very soft indeed-slush is the only word for it The shock stril cs us helpless , we lie still not sure if we are alive Black darkness, and silence, and no attempt, either on his part or mine, to move 'then the man's voice, very low -" My dear lady, are you killed ?" " No man, I am not " This was said snappishly, city mouth being full of mud Certainly that man was meek as Moses, for he was civil still " Thank heaven for that My dear, good, blessed lady, are wo down at the bottom of a Shaft ?" " No, there are no shafts hereabout " No sooner had I spoken, than the poor bewildered creature sprang to his feet and recovered his wits " I made sure we were down a shaft, he said in an awed tone if any accident happens to a Cornishman, his first idea is that he is down a shaft " Are you hurt, ma'am '" " Not a bit," I answered springing up likewise We con- gi atulated each other upon this, and in two minutes more, to my great delight, who stepped off the bushes and brambles and underwood, on to the hard firm, open road "Ah I knew we should strike the path this way," said the man, triumphant 1 was generous, I did not say, " Yes, but we might have been killed in stepping off that great high bank, which will frighten you a little when you look at it to morrow morning, Mr Boatman "I did not even re- mark that we might have broken our bones I simply said, I should like him to look at that place by daylight, that was all He said he would We clambered over a gate, and found ourselves in the fields, close upon the village of Tavytree It was a respectable village highly respectable It had eight villas in it, all standing in their own ground in the eight villas might be found nine old maids, and one old bachelor on crutches, three widows, poor, with children, and two married couples, rich, without, With the exception of a little scandal about two of the old maids, who had fallen in love with the Methodist preacher, and declined to go to church, there was never anything to be seen or heard in the village but the most orthodox respectability Now in the fields I could see myself a little, and a nice object I saw There was nothing left of my bonnet but the cap, and that was hanging around my neck in rags My face was a cake of mud, mingled with blood from my prize fighter's nose and scratches I was torn, and worried, and mangled, and rolled, just like an early Christian virgin and martyr that minute pulled out of the fangs of wild beasts And in such a shape as this I was to enter that respectable village, and perhaps street some of my respectable acquaintances and a man with me, too ' And morals here so severe Luckily it was 11 o'clock, and every- body went to bed at 10 at Tavytree There was a hope I might not be seen As we neared the village, the manly protector to whom I owed My woes seemed to feel some compunction " Ma'am," he said, mysteriously, " if you like to go back, we can wait at the corner of the wood till the first glimmer of daylight, then we can walk to the boat, or I'll carry see I'm sure with all the pleasure in life, and I'll cross sharp, and got 'so into S dtash unbeknown My wife keeps a burn , you can clean yourself there, and come here to morrow respectable like Nobody'll know " This obliging offer made me smile 0, the simplicity of men ' Better face all the out raged virtue of Hawtree than chess myself on the forbearance of a wife After studying human nature so long among my neighbors, I was not quite such a goose as to put my head into a trap I declined with thanks, and ss walked on a little faster A man approached us I rejoiced to see that his gait was none of the soberest, and keeping to the dark side of the road, and folding the tournants of my drapery sounding, I deceived his befuddled eyes he doomed me a respectable figure he ever touched his hut Fortunately this blind individual was the only creature we met Sneaking along by back ways, I reached my cousin's house unseen The moment the door was opened I jumped inside In the blaze of light in the hall I looked at the man , he looked at me He was a muddy merman, I was a hideous tattoo demalion The servant screamed , my cousin rushed out from the parlor ; she screamed, I could not embrace her, I was too duty even to give her my hand I gasped forth, " Is my box come ? " Yes," she said " Clean things and a bath ' When I'm a Christian woman again I'll tell you everything We've had a frightful accident- been nearly killed "As to the man, he went wading back to his boat at 5 in the morning, and I never saw him again Long afterwards I heard that his village was in a commotion at his disappearance that night, and his wife refusing steadily to believe his meek statement of facts, bullied him so tremendously that he ran away and has not been heard of since I understand he curse I all womankind before his departure, and do claim ed that I was the cause of of all his misfortunes Such is man
