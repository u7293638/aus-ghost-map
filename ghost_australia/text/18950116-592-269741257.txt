Tkero are the howler monkeys, for example, who make night hideous in largo tracts of South American forest, beginning their dismal music ns soon ns evening sets in and only retiring for tho day ns dawn purples tho horizon. There are tho lemurs of Madagascar, so called because, like ghosts, thoy walk by night and withdraw at cockcrow strange, stealthy, noiseless creatures, with great, wistful, poetical eyes and en larged pupils; monkeys that prey on birds and insects in the gloomy depths of their native forests.

These are but a few of the nocturnal mammals of themonkoy and lemurtypo, ancient ancestors of our own, gone wrong through keeping such very late hours, and now stranded for tho most part in islands or peninsulas of extreme antiqui uomnui Magazine.
