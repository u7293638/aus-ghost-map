execution of the last of hal . leah's murderers. (Rockhampton Bulletin, December 23. At 8 o'clock yesterday morning the last sentence of the law was carried out on Alexander Archibald, in Rockhampton Gaol About a quarter before 8, the prison bell began to toll, and the mournful procession moved from the condemned cell to the enclosure where the scaffold stood A considerable number of por sons- about 100-had assembled to witness the execution. The condemned man walked into the enclosure firmly and calmly, his eyes with dering over the familiar faces gathered round the scaffold there was a look of resignation on his features free from any be at ado, and Ina de meeting throughout was that of one who sub units d calmly to his fate, as a was prepared to accept it with fortitude and Christian resignation The Hot til Colson walked beside the pris mci, reading the funeral service Behind came the hit In Jenkin and the BeAn Um tint, and the gaol officials Archibald wits di cased in a dark tweed suit, crimean shirt, and no neck tie or collar, and wore a pint of prison shoes He looked but little worn down by his long confinement and the mental anxiety he must have suffered He carried a bunch of flowers in his right hand Under the seat fold lay his coffin Annul at the foot of the scaffold, the concluding putters of the funeral service were recited, Archibald and the officiating clergyman remaining standing according to the usage of the Presby to nan Chin oil, to which he claimed to belong Archibald's eyes, during the recital of the service, wandered restlessly over the faces of the crowd, and he seemed to pay but little attention to the words of the den j, t man The condemned man then knelt down with the attendant clergymen, and delivered a long extempore prayer During its debt or, a constant knocking at the outer gate was followed by the measured tread of the Volunteers through thoeorndorof the entrance, and about sixteen members of the force entered the enclosure under the command of Sergeant Harley, and drew up at the lefthand side of the scaffold, shoulders being given in a loud voice, and the necessary munion rea being one child with a seeming indifference to the solemn scene being enacted at the foot of the scaffold the milling of arms falling discordantly on the last words of prayer from the dying man The spectators were sensibly shocked by this it seems often option, and it was felt that when a disagreeable duty had to be gone through, it should not have been left to a subordinate, and the commanding officer or one of the lieutenants been present, the volunteers would have been on the ground in time , or if they had been late, they would have taken their places without making an ill-timed display of military precision The police, under the command of Sub-Inspector Elliott, were drawn upon the right of the scaffold Aichi bald prayed in a clear, piercing voice, and all who heard him were sensibly affected He said - ' O Lord God I thank you who hast permitted me to live for twenty eight years the greater portion of which I have spent in sin and understand I thank Thee that Thou hast given me a few weeks for repentance to read Thy blessed word, and for Thy worship O Lord, Thou hast shown thyself to me a God of help -of -strength and of comfort I care as little for that coffin before me as for my bed I thank thee, O Lord, for the discharge you have given me, and I hope that it may strike terror through out the work I have been led blindfolded (' pinioned) to the gallows s , O God, look down and pity mc I thank Thee for my clearance from these dreadful irons this morning, I give myself up to then as a hung sacrifice, and pray that I may be made wholly acceptable to Thee Hear my prayer, O Lord ' God bless my wife and child en direct and protect them, O God, bless them I pray for my enemies, if I have any, and for those who may have committed perjury and may have given false evidence against me, if they did I ask pardon for them I do not curse them any of them I bless them in my heart, and I report deeply for all that I have done, and I trust that they will be as freely forgiven as I forgive them O Lord, I thank thee I have not an enemy to face, oh, I hope to see all my old friends and relations in heaven * An old friend of mine was shown by me the other day a likeness of my Saviour, and in a few minutes I shall see my Saviour in reality O God, have mercy on me for my Sa* tour Christ's sake Amen, Amen " The last amen was dwelt upon with great fervency and apparent feeling The Rev Mr Jenkyn then offered up a brief and earnest prayer The Rev Mr Hartley also offered up a prayer During this time the hangman was standing under the fatal beam, and silently waiting his victim Archibald having completed his prayer, expressed a desire to place the flowers he held in his hand in his coffin His request was complied with, and he walked over from the foot of the drop to the further end, under the drop where the coffin lay The lid was lifted by one of the gaol officers, and with his pinioned arms, Archibald placed the flowers where his head was so soon to he He appealed pleased that his wish in this respect was complied with, and walked back fit only to the foot of the steps He mounted thou with a steady tread, preceded by the Rev Mr Carson and attended by the two other ministers, and the gaol officials As he went up he said, "Thanks be to God I am climbing to Heaven " On reaching the platform in he was placed beneath the beam by the executioner, and the rope was quickly adjusted round his neck Before the cap was drawn over his eyes, Archibald advanced to the front rail of the platform and said "Dear friends, I wish to say a few kind words to you before my departure from this wicked world I hope my end will be a dreadful warning not only to you who hear me, but to the whole world I will say nothing about my trial, I bless my countrymen who found me guilty, and the judge also, and bless his soul, and God abide with him, and long may he live to administer justice and mercy I trust that those who have committed wilful perjury against me, if they have done so, that the Lord will forgive them I have prayed for them late and early, and I want to show you that there is a great deal of difference between me and a man who has one main courage for to commit a murder A man who has animal courage would be able to walk up and meet his down , but I want to show that the strength I have is got from above from the Almighty It was not from any outward boast that any blackguard might make that I died game, God forgive me and save me from having a boast being made by any blackguard that I died like a man, or died like a man I thank God it is better than that and I believe I meet my death as a Christian I trust that you will all meet me in Heaven I am an uneducated man, and in a very painful position I cannot address you in fine language only in such as I have got I trust what I say will be accepted by the whole of you I trust that all of you, and young men particularly, will keep away from drink, bad company, and race horses I trust that a few old friends that I see amongst those around me will give up these things, and may become better men God bless you all I pray for you all, and my last word is that God may make you better and that when your time comes you will die with a smile on your lips as I can I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year I feel that I am going to have mine with the Saviour in joy Farewell ' farewell " The cap was then drawn over his face, and he was placed beneath the beam He then said " All right good bye, father," addressing a man named Davis in the crowd, whom he was accustomed to call by the name of father, and turning his head aside said, "I want to say good b) 6 to Mr Hartley " He then shook hands with Mr. Hartley and Mr Jenkyn The Rev Mr Cox sou then prayed Into thy merciful hands, O Lord ' we commend the soul of thy servant now about to be severed from ; the body) Receive him, we humbly beseech thee, O God' into the arms of thy more) Let not his faith waver nor his hope fail Let him die in peace rest in hope and use glory" Then taking Archibald by the hand, he said, "Dear Brother, God the rather, who hath created thee , God the Son, who both redeemed thee , God, the Holy Ghost, who hath infused His grace into cheese now and ever more thy defence assist thee in this thy last trial and bring thcotoo*orlasting life! Arnon '" my left hand was tightly) clenched After the pi as 01, he shook hands with Mr Carson, and stood silent a moment in a voice full of 01110 tion he then said, " The Lord have mercy on me ," and, addressing the crowd, he said, " let me hear you say one word for me let me hear you say the Lord have mercy) on my poor soul " From out the crowd there are one unanimous and solemn response, and as the words, "The Lord have more) 011*0111 soul," fell on his cm, he said, in a hopeful voice, " Thanks be to the Great God now I die happy) " He then began another pi over-" On ' lit your lit sits be in boat on Oh' 11101 oiful God Thou who are willing to receive" At this moment the bolt was drawn and the soul of Alexander Archibald was launched into eternity He appeared to suffer no pain, death being almost instantaneous There was no conception of the lower limbs, and the boil) after swung ODcut from left to right for it few seconds, rested with the face to the wall Archibald's guilty life was over and the last of Halligan s murderers had gone to his account The body after hanging for half 1111 hour was then cut down, the face on being uncovered appearing calm and peaceful one of the 01 es war closed, the other partially open 'The tongue protruded slightly from the mouth The body was then placed in the coffin and a post mo> him examination was laid by Dr Sol mond, assisted by Drs Thon and M'Ncoi) The sudden drawing of the boat seemed to have surprised Archibald and when he felt the drop going down, he drew himself up with a startle 1 movement. The irons were first placed upon the prisoner inna weeks ago yesterday after being sentenced, fears were entertained for several days that he contemplated starving himself to death, but it subsequently appeared that those fears were groundless Archibald told Mr Hardie) that he had no such intention but that the sentence produced so deep and depressing an effect on him as to deprive him of all appetite So on weeks ago Archibald was unable to read. He had learnt the beneficial effects of the religious ministrations offered by the gentlemen attending Palmer and Williams, and he was induced to listen more willingly to their exhortations Since then he tried hard to join 11 to nail, and was enabled at the last to road II chapter in the Bible During the first weeks of his confinement he appeared to sling ink washhouse from the sight of the gallows during his hours of exercise in the prison yard He afterwards be came reconciled to the sight, and within the last few day) 1 seemed to long for the last hour to come. Of late his wife had visited him every day, and prayed with him. He seemed anxious that she should join her prayers with his. It is needless to remark that she met his desire in this respect. Mr. Carson attended him during Tuesday forenoon, and his wife visited him early in the afternoon. She left him about half-past four o'clock for the last time on earth. The The parting between them was very affecting. Shortly after, Mr. Jenkyn and Mr. Hartley were in attendance. They left about half-past six o'clock, and Mr. Curzon remained with him for about another hour. Mr. Hartley and Mr. Jenkyn returned about ten o'clock and remained in the condemned cell until about one o'clock in the morning. Archibald expressed a desire to remain up all night, but was persuaded to take some rest. He slept until about half-past four o'clock, and Messrs. Hartley and Jenkyn were again with him at five o'clock, from which time until about a quarter past seven they read and prayed with him, and sang the well-known hymn-" There is a land of pure delight," when Rev. Mr. Carson arrived, and was engaged with him until the irons were knocked off. During this operation, Archibald appeared quite resigned to his fate. He expressed himself as very grateful to all the gaol officials, especially to Mr. Donnelly for the kindness shown him during his confinement. The body was removed for interment to the cemetery yesterday forenoon. The funeral was numerously attended, the ministers who had attended him in his last moments officiating on the occasion. Alexander Archibald was a native of Perthshire, in Scotland, from whence he came in 1851 to New Zealand when he was ten years of age, moved after a time to Castlemaine, then to Gipps Land, then to Melbourne and Beechworth, and next to Thule station on the Murray, in New South Wales, then to Bendigo, where he got married in 1862, moved to Dunedin, in New Zealand, in 1863, and came to Rockhampton in March, 1864. We understand that Archibald told a person here, falsely as it seems, that he was in South Australia before he came to Rockhampton, and that he came up here because, whilst a youngster, he had committed an assault on a police- man on a racecourse in South Australia, and lied to avoid the consequences. Since he arrived here he has been engaged in horse dealing, and at every race meeting here he was a prominent and noisy figure. About the end of last year, he took the Lion Creek Hotel, and it was there that the plan was matured which resulted in Halligan's murder and his own death on the gallows.
