.t fJliv ?r 'PORTFOLIO: ' -,-', Many a Christian trusts Christ to carry "-him through the valley of the shadow of death who does not rely upon :Him to take him through the dread to.morrow. If you'are Christ's you have no right to worry. He is a safe Pilot. You can trust Him in the shallow, quiet river, as . well'as in the sea beyond. And now, out of the writings and say ings and deeds of those who loudly pro claim the" rights of man" and the "rights of'hibesy," mateh me; if you can, with one sesnsuce .s sublime, so noble, one that wills sa an at the bar of God here aftir, as this simple, glorious 'sentence of Pnalr., in w? asserts the rights of Chisid senesience above the claims of C il an liberty-" Wherefore, if 'meat mke msar bouther to offend, I will eat no ds 'while the world standeth, lest I smake say brother to orffendl"-F. i. To blaspheme against the Holy Ghost is not to utter mere ribald words of pro. .fane import. It is to turn away God from the heart's doors with contimolious ,rejections of His loving and saving ap proach. .To be acceptedis all God really asks, from: His children; their childish, iignorant, and perverse denials and asper stons, of' His majesty, with all other !wickedness;:He `can forgive, for His ne .cepted presence will purge all away; but He cannot bless with forgiveness the soul which, persists' in anr attitude of hostile t?dienatioon. for. Ho cannot reach it with His healing, reconciling .influences, who ther in this world or another.--Jos. aMay.
