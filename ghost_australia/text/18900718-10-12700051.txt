BURNIE. About 1 o'clock to-day (12th inst.) there appeared in one of our principal streets an undersized gentleman in red coat, top boots, and white inexpressibles armed with a bugle and followed by about a dozen jaded-looking small dogs. After sounding his bugle a few times, about a dozen horsemen joined the gentleman with the dogs. The party then left the town by the old More- ville-road, and about three hours after re- turned, some by the Table Cape-road, some through the adjoining paddocks, quite dis- connected. On inquiry I was informed that these were the North-Western hounds, and the gentleman above described was whipper in. This was the hunting party! What the hunted object was I could not find out. A chopping match came off in the after- noon between two young men named Hodgetts and Buckingham, which was won by the former cutting a log 2ft. in diameter through in 5min. 18secs. On Friday evening an entertainment was given in the Town Hall by the scholars of the State School under the able management of their teacher, Mr. Burton, Mr. A. H. Chap- man, Stipendiary Magistrate, in the chair. The proceeds, amounting to over Â£10, were in aid of the funds of the Town Hall. The following programme was gone through in a manner creditable to all concerned, and showing great painstaking by the teacher: - Part I. - Opening song, "Swinging and Seesaw;" Chairman's remarks; "Early rising," song, ochool; recitation, "When we ate men," by 10 boys; song, "The reign of May," school; recitation, "The Faken- ham ghost," Mr. Soule; "Tit willow," Mr. Westbrook; recitation, "Each day's work," seven girls ; song, "Do your best to learn," school; recitation, "The enchanted shirt," Rev.

The Wharf Labourers' Union, by its arbitrary bearing, at one time seemed as if it would be a great annoyance to employers of labour here, especially those connected with the steamers calling at the port, but now shows signs of disintegration. Today one of their leading men "sage counsel in cumber," went to one of our employers, and gave up his ticke?, accompanied by a note, stating to the effect if this gentleman would give him employment, that Union "cares and 'Union men might a' gae tapsalteerie."
