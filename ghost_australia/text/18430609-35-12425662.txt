CHURCH BOOK SOCIETY. THE PAPAL CLAIM TO JURISDICTION CONSIDERED. A SIXTH Lecture delneicd by the Rev. It. ALLWOOD, U.A., on Wednesday, June 7, in the St. James's Ciainintii School.

own bounds as the Alexandrian Bishop had pic scribed limits to his diocese, so also had the Roman Bishop and as he of Rome managed the nilairs of his ?own diocese without the ltiterfeience ot any other person so they willed thal he of Alexindiin should hive the sime povvci, and that none should obstruct linn in the cxeicise of it By the 7th canon it is enacted, that " Since custom and ancient tradition lins ob tamed that he who is Bishop of Jerusalem should be honoured, let lum have the next place of honour, the due rights of the Metro pcilitan being pi eservod 1 hat is, that the Bishop of the Chin eli of Jerusalem, which was ever highly reverenced hy the early Clnistians, should lank re\t after his Motto politan the Bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, Cæsarea being the metropolis of that province Whether the Fathcrs assembled at Nice had some motive beyond «hat we lime cou sidered, m so cleirly defining the pimloges and lights of these Metropolitans, we cannot coitiiiily discovei It is by no means mi probiblc howevci, that they had reason lo apprehend further encroachment on the liberties of the different Churches and enacted these canons as barriers The disposition to lord it over God s heritags, for which Irenaeus rebuked Victor, and Cyprian and Firmilian opposed Stephen, had long before this Council of Nice given warning from what quarter danger to the liberties of the Church was to be apprehciided, and these canons wero pro- bably enacted with a view to determine the nature, and to explain the origin, as well as the extent of the authority, which the Bishops of the principal Sees had obtained over their brethren the bishops of the smaller, and there fure less influential dioceses And in what this authority oiinitiated we Irae nheidy considered, inmelv,iu the respect that was paid to places in pioportion to their tempoial power and greatness So Ircmciis speaks of the more powerful principality of Rome so Cyprian giveB the precedence to Rome on account of its magnitude, so Atha nasius writes, that " the Arians did not spare Liberius the Roman Bishop, for that they were led by no reverence, either because that was an apostolic see, or because Rome was the metropolis of the Roman power - Ad sol vit Agent ep tom i So the 1 istoin 1 athols m then letter to Julius the Roman Bishop declare the precedency of his Chinch to be derived fioin its lnngintude

have been bound to protest But these nucicnt 1 nthers were as yet un- acquainted with such claims, neither did the bishops of Rome then anogile such powers tp thpms.p]ic«, but were satisfied to have the \iecedency aooording to tho indent custom Hte second Cenerai Council was held at Constantinople, between the years 381 and 383 It was convened by the Emperor Theodosius, to consider the errors of Macedo- nins, who held heretical opinions respecting the Holy Ghost, blasphemously asserting in opposition to the orthodox faith that he was a created being The western Church at this time enjoyed an almost perfect peace, and sent no deputies to Constantinople 1 he Eastern Churches were not only vexed by heresy, but torn and distracted by internal dissentions,- that of Antioch by the rival claims of Paulinus and Meletius—that of Constantinople by the attempt of Maximus to supplant Gregory-while disturbances in the pl|H)ch pf Alexandria and jealousy between that Church and Constantinople, had followed upon the death of Athanasius, and were still painfully visible At this Council 150 orthodox prelates were present, amongst whom were Gregory Nyssen, the brother of Basil—Cyril of Jerusalem niul Meletius of Antioch, the President, and thirty six Bishops ]io)d|Hji thp ppimojjs of Macedonius-Sozom I vu c7 They condemned the errors of Macedonius and of some of the sects of the Arians, and re- vised and enlarged the Nicene Creed, by cer tain passages, respecting the incarnation of the Son of God, and the divinity of the Holy Ghost which creed, with the exception of the words, ' and the Son," when speaking of the procession of the Holy Ghost is the same used by us in our communion service—and is said to have been the composition of Gregory Nyssen Meletius of Antioch, Gregory of Constan- tinople, and Timothy, Bishop of Alexandria, successively presided, but neither Damasus, the then Bishop of Rome, or any representa live of the Latin Church was present at the Council During

of St Peter We have here again clearly implied the origin of the authority of the Roman Church, and the reason why the early Fathers allowed precedence to her bishop, namely-because Rome was the metropolis of the world, and the seat of government When a rival capitol sprung up at Constantinople, the bishop of that city became a person of great importance his influence over the Council corresponded in some degree with the influence of the second city of the empire, and by this canon of Council, he was at once raised over the heads of the bishops of the apostolical Sees of Antioch,and Jerusalem, and Alexandria, and in point of precedence declared to be second only to Rome It wa« ft oin the Iuthtrs of this Council I hut the s\ nodical leltci vvns vviittcn to Du nnsus and the western Bishops, in which }the} declare, "We acknowledge the most venera!le Cynl, beloved of God, lo be Bishop of the Church of Jerusalem which is tho mnlhci of nil Churches I hood Ive1) And when we remember that it is an article necessary to salvation to believe that Rome is the mother and mistress of all churches, one of two things is certain, either that the Fathers at this Council of Constantinople are cut off from salvation by her anathema, or that she teaches her people to believe as an article of saving faith an untrue and unfounded assertion, at variance with the voice of Ca thnlic antiquity, and the clear and positive witness of the Fathers assembled in what she recognises as a General Council Hie thud Geneial Council, consisting of two hundred bishops, wa» IK Id at 1 phesus, A D 431 Nestorius Bishop of Constanti uople, a man of learnimg and eloquence, but rash und injudicious, lind ni sevcinl dis courses maintained that the Holy Virgin could not rightly be termed tho Mother of God, a term which had latterly been much used in controversy with the Arians He affirmed that she could only be termed the mother of Christ-because God could not be born; and that, therefore, the Son of Man only was born of Mary These opinions, maintained with great eloquence spread very widely, particularly throughout Egypt Cyril was thou Bishop of Alexandria a man of a most restless and ambitious spuit He wrote an imperious letter to Nestorius, which was replied to in the same angry strain, and after advising with Celestine the Bishop of Rome, they each called the bishops of their provinces together in Council, \D 430 Celesline at Rome, when he declared the opinions of Nestorius heretical, and de creed th it he should be deposed unless lie rec mted and Cynl at AJcxnudn i ni which he anathematised Nestorius as a heretic Nestorius accused Cyril of the same crime, and anathematised him in return His is perhaps one of the most painful passages in the history of the early Church, when we are almost compelled to conclude that pride and passion, and the lust of pre-eminence, rather than the sincere love of the truth, was the origin of this unhappy controversy The feelings of the pallies vveic so cxas peiated bv then îeciproeil excommunica- tions, that thcie was no prospect of any ami cable tciimuation foi accoidmg to Evngrius, lib i c 3, ' Nestorius yielded not one jot— neither to Cyril, nor yet to Celestine, Bishop of Old Rome, but made suit to Theodosius II, that by his authority a Council might be called Upon which the Emperor wrote to Cyril,
