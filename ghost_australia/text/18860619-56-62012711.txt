COBAR. (Herald.) A very foolish joke was indulged in on Friday evening, by some person in the vicinity of the Victoria Hotel, in Harcourt-street, by which a lad named McCourt met with a very nasty accident. It appears three or four lads were proceeding down the street, when they espied a tall figure dressed in white coming towards them, and on near approach it could be seen that it was like a man with a sheet over him, which one of the lads took to be a ghost. One youngster immediately made tracks for home, and, in running away, went full-but against a stump, severely cutting his hands and face. It would have surprised the wearer of the sheet if he had received half a brick for his pains, but it would have been no more than he deserved. It would be just as well if the person, whoever he may be, refrained from such foolhardy practices in future, as he may not get off so well next time. Mr. M. J. Kenane, a young man only 18 years of age, who for the past twelve months has filled the post of accountant in the branch of the New South Wales Bank in this town, died suddenly at about half-past 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning last. He had been ailing for some time from consumption, and, although it was known to his friends that he was in very delicate health, no one thought his end was so near as he kept to his employment and was at work a few hours prior to his death. On Wed- nesday afternoon his remains were followed to their last resting place, in the Roman Catholic portion of the cemetery, by a large number of friends, Mr. W. J. Hogan, in the absence of the Rev. Father Curran, read the burial service at the grave. Deceased was brother to Mr. Kenane, postmaster at Silverton, and of the es- teemed post and telegraph master of this town. Much sympathy is expressed for them in their sad bereavement.
