A GHOSTLY APPEARANCE AT AUBURN. EXCITEMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. Tho' some sceptics may deny belief in visitants from another sphere; yet with the majority of folk the belief dies hard. Miss Marner, of "Lamington," Vic toria road, Auburn, Victoria, has more than once seen something resembling a ghost- when, for instance, she looked in her mirror, so debilitated was she by many months' illness. She says: "I commenced, some two years ago, to feel very ill after returning home from school. I did not feel sufficiently unwell to take to my bed, but experi enced a continued languid feeling that made me most miserable. Father took me to see a doctor, and he said I was overgrowing my strength, and I was not to exert myself. As I had no in clination to do so, there was no fear of my disobeying this order, and I took the " quinine tonic" given me, with regularity. Then I commenced to feel acute pains in my shoulders and back, and at night could scarcely get any rest." " We tried everything to induce sleep," interposed Mr. Marner, " but without effect; then I consulted a well known Collins street practitioner. He said my daughter was suffering princip ally from weakness, and advised a change. Her mother took her away for a trip to Queensland, but she returned looking worse. She would also retch on rising in the morning; any food taken could not be kept down. She lost flesh and became a mere ghost." " This time last year," said Miss Alice, " I weighed 7st. 31bs., now I am 9st. 71bs." "A great improvement; your treat ment must have been beneficial ?'' "No; all the medicine I got did me very little good. Actually, Dr. Willi ams' Pink Pills for Pale People deserve that credit. Just before the Jubilee holidays, father bought me a box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, at Mr. Pleasance's, Chapel street, Prahran; they did me so much good that I continued with them. It is a long time since I discontinued taking them, and I am now as healthy as anyone could wish." " And you would recommend them T" " Yes; and that strongly, too," said Mr. Marner, "had I known of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills two years before, it would have saved me a hundred pounds." There are many readers who may be fortunate enough to save their pockets if they act as this young lady did.
