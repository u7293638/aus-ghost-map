ST. PATRICK AND THE SHAMROCK. In Tara mot the kings and chiefs oÂ£ ancient Innisfail, Aud Pagan priests were lighting up the eacred fires of Baal, And in the Soyal Council Hall were bard3 end Druids sago, Whilst youthful clansmen gathered round to hear 'the words of age. 'When lo ! a bearded strange r with a cross and staff in hand, Appronchrd the fiMeJs and rulers, and before them took his stand. Majestic was his figure, yet he bore no axe nor sfeean, IFor Patrick was a soldier of the peaceful Nazsrene. Witn glowinp zeal he preached to them of Chiist the crucified ; He told tbein how for fallen man the Saviour Jived and died ; JHe pictured the unselfish love which Jesus bore our moo, iTJntil the t-?ars of: pity rushed down many a rugged face. But when ho preached of one great God, in which are persons three, They wondered and they doubted, and they asked how that could be 5 So stooping down, St. Patrick plucked a shamrock from the sod, And, pointing to its triple leave a, t.'ms spake to them of God ''The stalk &nd; centre leaf a the Sire, tho leffcone is the Sob, The right one is tho Holy Ghost, and yet the three ere ono.' Converted and convinced by him, hie hearers were baptised ; AndthiB ie why the Shamrock still by Irishmen is prised.
