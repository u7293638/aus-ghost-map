A STRANGE STORY OF THE SEA. The American brig, Mary Celeste, 278 tons register, under the command of Captain Fleming, sailed from this port recent!', (says the " New York Herald.") Ten days ago a British merchantman, sailing in the Mediter ranean, saw the Mary Celeste a few miles leeward with sails set, yet behav ing in such a mariner that sailors could see that something wa9 wrong. Re ceiving no answer to their signal they boarded her.. The sight that greeted excited a feeling of intense cariosity. Every sail was set, the tiller was lashed, and not a rope out of place. Every thing below and aloft was in perfect order. The fire was burning in the galley. The dinner was standing un tested and scarcely cold. The cargo in the hold was intact. The pumps were dry. No one, living or dead, wsb aboard. The sailors searched vainly for an explanation of the sudden disappear ance of the captain; his wife, his child, and crew. The log, - written up to the hour of her recovery, showed that she hailed from Boston. There was not a drop of blood, a lock of hair, a disor- ded room, or anytning to snow a sign of struggle. The boats were in their places. Thore was not the slightest clue by which a reasonable hypothesis could be advanced to explain where the crew had gone. From that day to this not the slightest clue has been obtained by its owners, nor have they ever been able to frame an explanation of how she w&b; abandoned. Captain Fleming says she has been a lucky ship ever since, and that never a ghost or speck of those who vanished has ever ap peared on her since. In the cabin a child's toys were scattered aronnd, and a piece of a woman's dress was still un der the needle of the Bowing-machine.
