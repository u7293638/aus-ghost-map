THE CRYSTAL MA EE. There is a new and wonderlul Professor Pepper's host kind of illusion at the Crystal Maze, in the form of a head within a few feet of the spectator, which is in turn a grinning skull, a cage alternately empty and peopled with birds, a pot oi icrns, a uouquei, auu various other articles of commerce and curi osity. It is an ingenious device, well con- tiived ; and being of the gratis sort, is likely to increase the drawing power of an already very popular resort. A concert was given on Friday night at the Seamen's Institute by Mts. Allen, of Dar- linghurst. The chair was occupied by Mr. J. Herbert Smith, seamen's missionary. Mrs. Allen was assisted by Mrs. -Hay ward. Misses Chaucer, Orion, and Major, and M essrs. Manner and Ruck, and other ladies and gentlemen, who provided an interesting programme, consisting of songs, recitations, 1 and solos ou the piano, violin, aud banjo.
