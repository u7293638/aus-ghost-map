THE POOR WORKING MAN. A good deal was heard at last night's meeting of the Leicbbnrdt Council about tbo pains and penalties of tho poor working man. Tho discus sion arose over a letter forwarded from tho Kogarali aldermen asking the council to join in protesting against tho proposed increase of tho miuimtim water rato. Sotno of tho aldermen, in supporting the protest, waxed indignant against the Water and Sewerago Board. The whole of the Increased rate, it was urged, was to be got off tbo poorer class of people, and not off those who could afford it. It was the peoplo living in small cottagos who would suffer by the increased rate, and all because tho Water und Sewerage Board was so good-natured as to givo f23,000 worth of woter away for nothlug. Alderman Troup saw tho matter In a different light. Ho protested against tho "poor working man" being raised as a ghost to justify nldermen iu deliver ing themselves of a lot of false sentiment. And a good deal of false sentiment, he held, had been spoken on this matter of increasing the minimum water rate. They might talk ot tho injustice to tho working classes, but be thought thoro was too much of tills assumed scntimont. It tho rato was a just and fair one to be charged, sentl- mc-ut should not bo allowed to como into tho question. After all, It was purely a business transaction. Alderman Treadgold concurred maluly with tho views expressed by Aldorman Troup, but tho other aldermen were for joining in the general protest, and a resolution endors ing tbo action of the Kogarah Council was agreed to.
