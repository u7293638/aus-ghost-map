. Chanson Moderne.. ' Pope Gregory kept a serving man, And a serving woman too, But the day a bit Could they get to eat, It was sent with them all the year through. Pope Gregory took to himself a wife, As all the Popes did before But all she could get, Was meagre diet, And a look at the cupboard door. The Pope was one day taken sick, And flat on his back lay he, And she got the keys, And did as she pleased, And the wine flowed merrily. She opened then the cupboard door, And she called in Cardinals three, There was Cardinal O'Rourke, J And O'Regan, and O'Rourke, ' All men of mighty degree. O'Rourke and C"Rigan bowled a catch, The same tripped a galloped, They danced and equalled, And the Cardinals bawled, A del of a fanfare. O'Rourke gave the name a Minister took, O'Regan called her a flirt, When behind the door, The Pope stood on the floor, in his ragged bob tailed shirt. The dame of course tumbled into a swoon, O'Rigan tipped her a wink, And filling up A gallon cup, Cried, " your Holiness take a drink." The Pope when he saw his substance gone, Gave up the ghost in despair, They chaunted his knell, A Scots pint was the bell, And they buried him under the stair. PlERBE L'EKMITB.
