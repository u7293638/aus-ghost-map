THE PARLIAMENT. HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY. TUESDAY, AUGUST 30. The TREASURER, in answer to Mr. Bower, said he was afraid the negotiations which had been entered into with Western Australia, the object of which was to subsidise steamer com- raunioatiou with that colony, had fallen through entirely.—ln reply to Mr. Boss, be said he had no knowledge as to whether the balance of the South Australian Loan had been floated; it would be an improper thing for him to say if it was in contemplation to reduce tbe minimnm price of the bonds. The MQnSTBR of EDUCATION, in answer to Mr. Boss, said no application had been re ceived for a school at or near the junction of the Port Victoria and Moonta and Yorketown main roads. He bad directed enquiries to be made as to the number of children in the neighbor hood, on receipt of which information he would be able to give • definite answer to the question. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in reply to Mr. Wasd, said there being already Local Courts at Laura awl Georgetown, about seven miles nortb and south of Gladstone, the Go vernment did not consider it necessary to open a Local Court at tbe latter township at the present time. When, however, the gaol was completed a Court would be established at Gladstone. The plans for the gaol were in course of preparation, and an officer was then in tbe township with the view to fixing tbe site, and tbe building would then be immediately proceeded with. Tenders for stables and for;tg sheds aoe accepted on the previous d«v. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE. On tbe question of going into Committee of Ways and Means the Hon.L. GLYDE calW tbe attention of tbe Government to tbe ,sautb Australian Institute. A formal motion hail been passed by the Governors of the Institute that Mr. Bees and himself should call the attention of tbe Government and House to this subject. They complained, and not unreasonably, of the continual and vexations delays to which they had been subjected, and now it was threatened tint tbe site accorded for Institute purpose* might be taken away. Tbe plans had been delayed in a most unpleasant way, and now it was doubtful if their ground would not be taken away from them. The Governors of the Institute were anting solely for the good of tbe public, and they were disap pointed in finding that their wishes were disre garded. He then alluded to tbe manner in which the Museum exhibits were cramped, and to the liberal way in which this portion of tbe Institute was patronised.—The TBEISURBK said the hon. member would see that Mr. Carr bad a motion on tbe Xotice-Paper mruring these new buildings to be erected immediately. He was sure Mr. Clyde knew that he (the Trea surer) bad as strong a desire a* be had is favor of the Institute. He was a Governor of it for several years, and bad been connected with it ever since Ha infancy. Tte Government would have taken action before, but they wonld aee t list pending the election* for tbe Legislative Council this question should stand over so that they could detnitely settle another ques tion.—Mr. REBS did not see what Mr.Carre motion bad got to do with the question. While any contingency was likely to arise by which tbe site was thual—?d, ft was detrimental to tbe progress of tbe Institute, and ga ve rise to tbe belief that tbe largajexpense of tbe foundations and tbe preparation of expensive plans would be thrown away, and not only so, but would hamper the- bands of those who were friends to the cause of secondary education. —Tbe Hon. 3. CABS gathered from what the Treasurer had •aid that lie intended to submit the question to the Upper House. There was no necessity, a that House would never sanction the erection of the building on that site.—Mr. BII.VV raid the Government should at ouee say whether the site of tbe Institute was to !v> f*V<-? auar <ir not. If they said it was not confidence w.mM be restored. The Houw then west into Committee of Ways and Means. THB INCOME AND PROPERTY' TAX. Mr. DOWNEK, in resuming <h>> debate on this question, complained that the Him-* haJ been treated, to an ail turn stun degree to th riew? of the Treasurer and tn« ei-rrvastirer. Penonally ha quite agreed Tritb the proposal to tax the aiieenbt-s and to readjust the iuciieuc* of taxation on a more equitable basis, i.ut iie altogflfctwr objected to to* pro|>oml of the Go vernment far raising revenue from otluT than tbe present sources to provide for the prokabi* deficiency in the revenue. He did not believe in taxing the laboring classes heavier for the purpose of placine a sum in the hands of the Treasurer. There bad gradually crept into being a vicious system of over- estimating the expenditure — (hear, hear)—and yaar after year th.-*.-mis takes in tbe same direction wen- gradually in creased, so that this false system was inten tionally introduced or was the result of grj«? error and negligence. Tfae unexpended balance* ware wrongly named, and the more correct term for them would be "Ministerial over-extimates.-1 (Hear, hear, and laughter ) They were clearly not necessarily liabilities, nor were they not so. When a contract was entered into with a third person there was a liability, or when a con stituency bad spent money or made improve ments on tbe sbength of a vote of tb<\- House for a public work,auch aa the Port Victor Break water, taen they wen iiabiiitias. Assuming that be was incorrect in this conclusion, it w certain that for many past years there was always a large amount at the end of the jear to be brought forward or otherwise. These lalnnof were mutable quantities, and were used by tbe Ministry for the time being to make tbe foipecU -of tbe colony look gloomy or shiny as best suited them. He would like to know bow tbe Ministry expvet to expend all die money they are asking for Uiis year., when tbe Treasurer told tbe House that they could not ptnsiblr spend what they had last year, and that there was yet a balance of £44,000 in the Treasury. His belief was that there was no deficiency whatever, and that tbe present revenue of tbe colony was quite equal to tile expenditure. (Hear, hear.) 'When before bis constituents be denounced tea system of continuous borrowing, and aaid there must be taxation to pay off liabilities. That system of playing on the Land Fund wa« a moot per nicious one, and as thing* were going on the milleuium would arrive before the present ex penditure would be recouped. If the Treasurer wanted money to reduce the Customs tariff be would go with him, but if he wanted the money merely to have cash in hand to increase ex penditure then be would certainly oppose him. (Hear, hear.) TbeTkeasurer in hi* speech aaid be wanted tot ration to make up £X4ojMM)of a liability of £172j000.and if he was wanted to amend the Customs incidence be would require 300 per cent, more thaa tbe ptopnset tax of sixpence in tLc pound would realise. Either tbe Treasurer knew that bis figures were wrong, and that he bas no deficfeney, or Us figures are right, and he is deceiving tbe Howe. It waa treating members like silly children to toll them that he could make up Ids deficiency by raising £140,000 by taxation, while there would still be £30,000 loft of that deficiency, and there would be no balance for Customs reform. If the Treasurer said he wanted ejghtoenpeace instead of sixpence for Customs reform, then let him say eo, and she House would treat him fairly, but it was high time that the Treasurer gave up bis finessing, and spoke out openly and boldly as to what he mtended to <10\. It was nonsense to aak tbe House to «ote ta tbe dark on a question of Kuch great importance, and mem ben would not be doing their duty to the country if tliey passed this Bill and put money into the bands of tbe Ministry, union they were told what the money was wanted for. (Sear, hear.) He would go farther and nay after the way in which ibo Treasurer had treated the House, members should not take anything oa credit. There had been so much shiftingabout during the past fortnight, that member* should lie careful not to give heed to the promises of the Treasurer. Why did tbe Treasurer toll his constituents at Encounter Bay that tile colony was not ripe for taxation, and lie did uot mean to tax ? In liis address to his ooaatitaentg, which appeared in the papers of March 26. giving the policy of tbe Government, he declared it was not their intention of touching the iuci deoce of taxation during the Jireseut aessiou, and said the revenue was in a flourishing condition, and in the event of taxation being re quired, it wjuld take a form similar to that which lie introduced before, namely, the Stamps Bill. And yet in hU Budget Speech of July 30 the Treasurer cauie down witb a defi nite proposition for an income uud property tax-; and after the faults and weakness of his scheme had been pointed out be introduced clause A without eiplauatiou, and his statement that he meant this clause all along could uot be accepted by members, and the House had beau badly used by that gapdeman. bear.) The Trea surer was either mistaken all along, or he had treated tbe House witJi absolute discourtesy, and he had uot behaved in a way to induce the. House to give him its confidence. As to the question of whether an income tax was necessary or not he would not then discuss, but he would merely say thatafvoperty tax waa preferable. Mr. BOSS rase in ezpfeaatwu, and aaid he bad always spoken of unexpended liabilities in the sense that tiiey were accepted by the House The TSIASU&BR; aajd Mr. Downer did not do him justice at the end of his speech. It was I not fair to say that lie (the Treasurer) had ban diubiiariag ha djgerencas with the gg-TJtcasum tuque ad whmcm, and then to asy that he had not replied to that ban. member. The two things could not be accurate. It was not fair other to say that hia (the Treasurer*.) ward could not be taken, and m a gentleman and member of a learned prefoarion he was not doing himself jnstioe m «"i™i such a state ment. He (tbe Treasurer) had purpasslyee frained from occupy ing the time of the House in making mrianatifliif that would be given is tbe ordinary com of debate, sad he add it was impotable for any man to give aoeanto details of everything involved in tbe pro posal for a pwrnjeUj and income tax until they got into Committee of Way* < and Mean. He denied that be bad alterad his policy, but would not be aahamed to ■ay so if be had, because it was hotter that be should amend hia policy on a matter of taxation than that it riu*Jd be piU before them ma de fective manner. Every principle of tbe present Bill was considered by his colleagues sad Ida self in Cabinet. He denied the iasputetioas that had been east npon him, and said they were extremelv nnfair and uncalled for. If Mr. Clyde was desirous of maejatina; theCwumciit to amend tbe Customs tariff, bia ameadsaaut was unfair, because if he was Treaanrer he eaatd not do what he was proposing—to pot on toxa ' tion and relieve Cuntoms at the name time. (Mr. I Ross—- Sir Robert Peel did it.") So would be lif tbe whole House wished it, and if there was las strong a party at hia back as Sir Robert Peel j had, but tbe two things eonlj uot be done together while there were party tsetses and a strong opposition at work. If boo. members wished to assure a revision of the tariff before the income and property tax was pot on that could be done by a Bill, bat could not bt> .lone simultaneously with the property tax. He did uot say that be would bring la a Cos toms revision in a fortnight; what he did say was tliat if the House would carry the utayetlf tax in a fortnight he would deal with the Cas -toras revision daring the session; but be would not deal with it if tbe property tax were not ; passed till near th<\- end of the session. He was sore Mr. Gly.ic, who waa in honorable opposi ! tion to the Ministry (Mr. Glyde— * Ho, no.") ' Ob. y'*, be was id opposition—the triton among i the minnows. (Loud laughter.) Bat be would . not be able to show how to take £100,000 off tbe ,' revenue by reforming the Cnstoms tariff witb : out pointing out how the amonnt could be pat ! on. lie hoped Mr. Glyde's amendment would ;be rejected, and that this question would be | discussed fairly and without party spent. ! Mr. WAKD said if he could agree with the policy of the Ministry be would vote for it; bat !he did not agree with it and ant oppose it, . although he would not be able to sapport tbe , amendment of Mr, Glyde. He would propose j another amendment, namely—" That additional taxation waa unnecessary, but that certain Cas . toine duties should be abolinh^, *nd that tbe 1 deficiency be made up by a tax on property." jHe deprecated the proposal of tbe Government Jto tax income* over £390 a year, and to ask the House to vote for the tax being impoaml before stating how the Customs revenue would be re lieved. He said the CommiaricQer of Grown I Lands had muddled hi* brains by studying the ; obsolete works of Adam Smith and the the> i retieal writings of Stoart Mill (which could not apply to the colonies), and had managed also to muddle the brains of j his <?Ueajr.««. (Oh, oh, and laughter.) He I would uot go into figure*, but taasratid 1 those uLich were given by the ex-Treasurer. 1 Mr. Hot*. He said with ward to Custom* ! duties that the South Australian ports must be t tnadv an free a* possible. 11m Treasurer wan \- tint right wlies he proponed tbe Samps Bill in ■ IST\ which would have realised £SO/*?. I wbervas at the <-nd of that Tear there was a | credit htl&t;:<vof £9?,000. ao'that tbe £*>jftK? I ?a-. not required, and the present proposal for tavafii.n was equally unnecessary. He coo tr-o<ie>i that in liu- last four yean tbf expendi ture ha<l oi.lv gone up £116.000, whib- th menu, i.a<l al*o gr.ue up £«00,<Kk«,so that ther , was only in a, 'oal <iifft'rence on the deficit Hid ot £113.<««'. He defended the financial polic of the proii it. Owvemment, ao'i saiJ ha I their laud an.i railway projv«*i* been carrie I out there won].? have been no deficient :ui tlie rev.iiw. He admitted that Governmen ush int. i..i<-,l to jtrutct life and property, but the man who bail property at w«U :>« his ]if> shouM pay •omAtriag for •It- \ral<cti<>n tt:at was afforded his pro jt rtr. A property lax was reasonable and right, but not an income tax—upon incomes that were derived from industry, and industry only. This tax should not be pot on until ewery otluT devisable mi-Mat of raising revenue had bn n exhaoated. Tbe propertied dsase< sbonld be taxed moro to bring them on a level with wbnt wa* paid by tbf laboring rliiiM. He nrped Mr. <i !yd>' to withdraw hi* amendment in iavor of that which be (Mr. Ward* pioponed.

The TKKASUKEB poiirte.l out the danger of taking off the Castmus duties before a property tax was pass**!. Mr. OOOKE referred to the questions in dis pute bvt wren tbe Treasurer and Mr. Ksas, and tlien<Wa!t with what h<: rontondod were mt« re|««contations and misunderrtandtngs of his previous arguments.

They bad found, however, that while there had not been wanting tragic touches ami tangled thickeU of contradictory figure* the de bates upon the Treasurers Budget had fairly , bristled with comic situations. The lumsul Treasurer had come on the stag* Ufa* tbe ghost of Hamlet's father, and nafoUod such • iliisasl tale that though be bad not seen nay hen. members' partieuUr hair stand on end the expression of blank dismay on more than ana | face dearly indicated the belief tbat if the i Treasurer wen not forbid by his own woudettal I arumea to tell all the ismrto he knew the i colony would be proved to be on tbe high road to tbe dogs. <L&ughter.;) Suosequently j the leami-d rromier had appeared m the character of a magieian, who by a, dextorous movement—* -Heigh presto open im -* f had changed an income tax into a umptato tax, | and plunged aft tbe mercantile community Into a state of profound puaxlementa* towbeaVer he was going to touch the tariff this year or not. (Laughter.) And whatever the House might think of the method every hon. member must agree it bad been a very wunderf ul portonaanee. It had left the Hoase and tbe country eaoatr- I iig, "Well, where are we now, and what j will happen next?" Then they had had the • ex-Treasurer, who had proven a vary?hyloak * -(laughter) —and demanded hia nannus in these unexpended hataimet with a mk and mercUessneoD that had been mast moving. But since the House had fat into WaM and Maansthe tJC-Truasorer had rtnuinlnil him of one of the heroes of die nursery. Hon. mem bers would no doubt remember him.
