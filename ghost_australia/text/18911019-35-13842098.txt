AMUSEMENTS. "THE, DANCING GIRL." Henry Arthur Jones's new four-act drama is not I suited to the company now occupying Her Majesty's Theatre, though three of the secondary characters are very well played, and the piece itself is superbly staged " The Dancing Girl,'' as it was revealed on Saturday night, proved nov catholics decidedly interesting as to the first three nets, and if the adjective as " thrilling " and " strong " cannot be applied to it here as in London the fact is probably due to the inferior rendering It is possible that the emotional power of a handsome young actress Ilka Tulla Neilson, and the delicate method of an actor like "Mr Beerbohm ITCC, might invest with a certain fascination and charm such characters as the beautiful Pagan and the spendthrift Duke of the dramatist's story but Miss Laura Villiers never touches her audience as Drusilla Ives, and Mr A Cli ton Alderson is too heavy and wanting in finesse to make impresses the character of Lord Guisbrrj For without being absolutely re- plant the chief characters in the new drama are, to say the least of it, unsympathetic In the scene where the dancing girl uses all the witchery to do tain in the ducal mansion of which she is the mistress the rustic lover of her earlier days the dramatic points with 11 vivid hand one of the baser phases of fcnialccharactcr. Atthcsamctimc the force here show 11 is probably drawn from a scene of an almost exactly similar description 111 George Meredith s clever romance "The Ordeal of Richard Foienl " for the rest the episode is upon more or less com cution of hues and thus apparently ease food the notice of the purists who are so e daily mov ed to cry out iv lien 1 Such incidents are approached 111 any less usual. even though infinitely better and more poetical any However, if ' The Dancing Girl " sorts forward a sad experience of human life, it furnishes, too some bright example,) of honest integrity, of return to duty after struggle with temptation, and of the redeeming power of a woman's 1901 cited love And the of three characters of old David It is the passionate v strong young Christison, and the truth-loving Sybil Crake, are shown with a great deal of earnestness and fidelity Mr G P Carey, Mr Julius Knight, and Miss Gwendoline Floyd The fault of the new dramatic organisation is that it lacks leadership Miss Vilhors'company thus plays "The Dancing Girl" with an entire want of that distinction which a little leaven of first-rate talent would have furnished Secondary characters may be acceptably presented though it is not always that they are so-by actors of inferior ability But in the great parts the case is different and very often it is the touch of genius in the principals which gives salt and savour to the entire representation the production of ' The Dancing Girl" shows the absence of the little leaven which leavened the whole lump " and it has to be added that the acting of one character, at least, of some importance was deplorable, and that the want of stage management in the reception of the guests in the third act was plainly apparent The way in which the lords and ladies of the Duke's party scrambled up and down the staircase which forms the feature of the set, was at times ludicrous and that one of them should finally fall in a very absurd way, so as to throw down Drusilla whilst in the act of effecting a stage-faint, was no more than was to be expected under the circumstances Though the rendering as a whole was thus not of the high character to be expected at Mr Rignold a theatre, "The Dancing Girl " still proved of considerable interest, the staging was excellent, and the principals had a cordial recall at the close of the third act The opening scene by Mr John Brenton is of singular beauty, and make anything that this fine artist has "set before us The background shows the coast of the Isle of the Endellion, v Uli the blue water flow nig 111 to the yellow sand of the narrow bill in the foreground, or on which brings the quaint Cornish house of David Ives, head of the little Quaker settlement The third act is remarkable for scenic arrangement 01 quite a different chum for one with which the stage carpenter li is as much to do us the scene painter Hero a grand staircase occupies three fourths of the parent stage, with handsome chandeliers taring electric lights at foot and a lofty gallery at the back, leading to the inner rooms of the in annie 1 the whole brilliant scene, with the ferneries at the side of the hall below, was most effective The story is unfolded with ease and an air of nature in the opening scene upon the beach of St Endellion The island forms part of the estate of the Duke of GuiQoborry, and the audience learn from John Christi- son that the very existence of the settlement depends upon the construction of a breakwater, both to keep bad the constantly encroaching sea, and to save the fisherman from the treacherous current which in past times has put every family in the island in mourning Christison has devoted himself to the sacred task of building the breakwater but his love for the beautiful Drusilla Ives interferes with his work, and the p passionate prayer breaks from his lips, " Grant, O God that she may never come between 1 her and me " Drusilla 1 has returned to the island after an absence of two years spent lil vv anton luxury with the Dick in London, where she has become famous under a stage name as the most graceful dancer of the day Caprice has brought her home to her unsuspecting Quaker friends, and she has passed the time in " chatham her father and sister up her sleeve 0, m wondering how they came to be her father and sister, in making Christison madly in love 0 with her and in wishing that everyone was not so good and grubby " Drusilla has had three weeks of cheering and shouting in her Quaker dress when her lover, the Duke, arrives at the island in his character of landlord He meets there his ballin, Mr Crake, and Svbd Crake his daughter, the lame girl saved from death by the Duke's courage five years before, and was lo, as she sadly watches her rescuers downward course, w warns him that she, too will one day in turn " snatch him from beneath the horses' hoofs " Owing to Sybil's influence and to the knowledge that several lives had been lost during the past winter, the Duke promises to begin the breakwater, and appoints Christison his overseer The second act shows Drusilla 111 the Duke's town house, where her caprices have turned him for a whole year from his good purpose, and where Christison daily sees her in a vain attempt to win her love Here, then, we have, in the first place, Christison accepting the Duke's pay for work he does not do, consenting in the second place to live beneath the roof of Drusilla's protector, and in the third place endeavouring to deprive his patron of the al) cot ion at the favoured mistress The situation does not bear even glancing at, but it seems to have been accepted without protest in London by the very critics who were so needlessly shocked at the purely playful allusion to a silk stocking 111 ' A Doll's House "There is a fine scene in which Christison breaks from the temptress and she es immediately after besought in marriage by the now bankrupt Duke He has lost same, name and fortune, and now, clinging to his love and faith in Drusilla as the one thing he has left, proposes that they shall marry and begin life afresh in a new world Below this Drusilla hold herself begged for the title of duchess, and the Duke's reply had been, "Do not ask me for the only gift I must refuse " Now she sees before her a man outlawed from the only society where his title should carry weight, she looks forward without him to a long life of luxury and ever-changing conquest the title seems an empty name, the man for his own sake she never really loved and the Duke 111 turn is refused In the third act the Duke is carrying out his determination of ' giving the world one good kick back before he leaves it' In other words, he has invited the polite world to see a famous dancer perform in his halls, and the shock they sustain in recognising that Drusilla, the dancer in question, is being treated as an equal by their host, is to be succeeded by the shock of hearing of his death the next morning. The dance is interrupted by the entrance of old David Ives in search of his daughter He curses her for a witch and a wanton, and the beautiful pagan defies him with the words, "You know me now you see me as I am , I was over the topmost rose on the topmost branch, loving the sunshine, and 3 our narrow life stilled me , I will be myself , let me go ' " The old man is failed in his endeavour to win her back to truth and righteousness, and leaves the house. The outraged guests disperse, and the Dul 0 prepares to enter upon the unknown But as the poison IS at his lips, So ml creeps ghost-like down those great stairs and stays his hand Here the story might well and for can the Duke de loss or do better than fill in love with the woman who has dragged him from under the horses' hoofs," and loving, show his right to bet by repentance and good deeds I There is however a short fourth act very well written for all that it is an incubus upon the eager mind-in which the breakwater is built the Duke is married , Drusilla 13 referred to as having suddenly died Christison is shown to have come under the honor influence of the (most Quaker sister, Faith Ives and all is made to end happily " The Dancing Girl " is not an easy piece to play, the name-part presenting especial difficulties Anne and distinguished beauty, and a very mov inclines of voice and manner, could above make theatrically successful an impersonation of Drusilla Ives Miss Laura Villiers is not acting in good looks, but the manner is bald, the voice has no depth or contrast to promise, there is no spontaneous spring of emotion and the whole character is beyond the gr lap of the actress "Mt Alderson plays intelligently as the Duke but he would, we suspect, prove thoroughly at home only in a ho IVY melodramatic chur actor Mr George P Carey gave a careful and thoroughly acceptable leading of David Ives, time sternly just and upright (Junker Mr Julius Knight was well cast as John Christison , he showed an earnestness that proved convincing, and was at all times impresario Miss Gwendoline Floyd made a picturesque Sv bd Crake, and the hard, crystal-clear tones of the voice singularly fitted the simple directness of the speech and conduct by which the cn ppled heroine endeared her self to the oYor-flattoDjd Dako By some strange mistake Mr Guy Drcry was cast as the lion Hoginiild Slingsby A more grotesque caricature of a high-bred, foolish man of fashion, supposed to lie just rubbing along on £15,000 a-year, has never been seen at a first-rate theatre 111 Sydney. Mr Drury is probably not to blame in the matter He did his best, and spoke his lines with confidence The responsibility of his appearance in a character so manifestly out of his Uno rests presumably with the management The remaining characters were for the most part inadequately rendered. " The Dancing Girl " will be performed until further notice
