SOCIAL SKETCHES, j SCHOOLGIRLS' SATCHELS. The exquiBite picture Macauluy has given us of that moBt loveable of schoolgirls, Virginia, as " W ilh her email tablets In her hand, and her satchel on her arm, , , . , Forth the went bounding to the school, nor dreamed ot ehame or harm," her childlike innocence and utter uncon ecioueneBB of evil as fibe blithely trjpped on her way, prove that her satchel, unlike those of some of the Bchoolgirla of to-day, was only put to its legitimate use, ae a receptacle for leBeon-booke.and carried nothing contraband. I am not certain what was the preoiBe couree of studies which a Roman girl of that [ day pursued, bat as she was not expected to pass university examinations, as thera were no pianoa on which to practise interminable scales, and as Latin, which is now a difficult subject, most have come to her without much trouble, she can hardly have been so hard-worked as the schoolgirl of to-day. And yet how many of our girls, in addition to the immense number of school books which they not only carry about with tbem, but undoubtedly study and remember, find room among tbeir Euclids and algebras, their grammars and atlases, for questionable novels, which cannot be habitually read without quickly destroying that delicate bloom of maidenly guilelee&uesB; which even more than her beauty distinguished young Virginia and made her the " sweetest girl in Home." When I see-as I not unfrequently do see in the train-girls poring intently over these pernicious books, full of false ideas of life, and destructive alike of prin ciple and character, 1 often wonder that their mothers, who bestow so much care in wrap ping them securely in warm muffling during the winter months, and in guarding them by wide bats and thick veils from the too fierce rays of the summer sun, are so careleBS in respect to supervising their reading, and permit them to be chilled by the blight ing cynicism of one school of modern novels, and scorched by the fever heat of another, without taking any pains to guard them from these dangers. Of couree, 1 do not mean that girls should have notbiDg to satisfy their craving for romance, which is as natural as their appetite for sweetmeats, and perhaps, indeed, food for their imagination is as necessary to the due growth of their faculties as sugar, in some form or other, is necessary to their physical well being. 1 remember in my schoolgirl days being so deeply interested in a serial Btory then coming out in the Cornhill that 1 not only impatiently counted the long days between the mails which brought me instalments of the entrancing tale, but that though I was in perfect health 1 was seised with a terror that I might per haps fall ill and die before I could know whether the charming heroine surmounted the obstacles which threatened to prevent her marrying the hero and living happily ever afterwards. And even now, when I have long ceased to be a schoolgirl, 1 have still such a keen enjoyment of both fiction and bon-bons that 1 would not have the heart to deny a liberal supply of these delights to other girls, but 1 would take all possible pains to make sure that both were wholesome, and would as little like to give them poisoned literature to read as to allow them too much sweeteued plaster of Paris and white lead instead of pure sugar and fruits. There are a limited number of persons so crassly ignorant as to believe that reading of any kind must neces sarily be improving, and one can understand people of that claBS being perfectly con tented when they see their daughters engrossed in a sensation novel, which, as it is a printed book, most, they conceive, con tain useful instruction. But such want of enlightenment is not common, and cannot account for the number of young girls who have subscriptions at circulating libraries, and who, without any advice or guidance whatever beyond perhaps the recommenda tion of some other girl whose taste has been perverted by indiscriminate read ing, Belect at their own good will and pleasure whole shelves of novels at the rate of four or five a week, the beat of which are probably silly and sensational, while the worst are undoubtedly vicious and demorali sing. It cannot be that the mothers of all these girls are unaware of the harm that comee of such dangerous reading ; and they muat be strongly indifferent to the welfare of their children if they take no measures to prevent them reading books which are aa certain to hurt them as night is to follow day. " Tell me a Btory," is one of the most frequent demands an intelligent child makes to ita mother, or whoever has the charge (of amming it, and tell me a Btory, or rather let me read a story, as persistently demands the schoolgirl, and surely there is no lack of suitable stories, both for the little and for her elder sister, even were they aB insatiable AS the Bultan to whom the thousand and one tales wen told in the Arabian Highta. It sometimes, how ever, happens that there are people ao thoughtless, or so wicked, as to tell the little child stories of bogies or ghosts, whuth so terrify the poor mite that bed and dark ness become terrible, and instead of going happily to sleep, when he is laid in his crib, he cowers in an agony of fear, unable to cry or to call out, and expecting every moment to see something terrible, or to feel the clutdh of an icy hand. No one can doubt the harm the child enffers from having its demand for a Btory answered in that injudicious manner, and if the schoolgirl is given a vicious book to read, instead of one to entertain without injuring her,- she, too, has been as cruelly treated as the terrified child. Girls are con stantly oompared to flowers, and, like the flowers, their unsullied freshness is their greatest charm, but this delicate bloom, both i flowers and girls, is easily tarnished, and once gone is impossible to restore: therefore they should be tenderly shielded from all blighting influences, among the most danger onB of which to the human flowers is the indiscriminate reading of Beoaation or other wise objectionable novels. 8.
