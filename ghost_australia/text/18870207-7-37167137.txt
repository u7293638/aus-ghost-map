We rejoice to find that the work of God has been prosecuted with persevering earnest- ness and faith, and that much blessing has rested on the word preached with encouraging results. We do not think it possible to tabu- late all tbe success achieved, but we are pleased to note that in several places there is an increased attendance at pnblic worship, and marked improrenvent in the conduct of heareis, giving hope that they are not far from the kingdom of heaven. To the ordinary "means of jrraoe special revival services have been added in some places, and the divine approval has sealed the efforts ; the revival of the prayer and fellowship meetings in some instances have followed, and we believe if these were more general there would be more hope of greater success in the im mediate future.
