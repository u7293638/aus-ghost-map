LUTHER'S " EIN' FESTE BURG 1ST UNS8R G9TT." TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH. A strong fortress is our God, A shield and arms most famouB ; Help in our conflicts He affords Which jinw have come upon Us, The vile, crafty fiend, Earnest he now means, Groat power and sly tricks His cruel outfit is ; On earth is not his equal. With our might is nothing done, We are soon lost, fast losing ; But for ns tights the proper man Whom God Himself has chosen. Who is He ? Reply, He is Jesus Christ The Lord Sabbaoth. There is no other God ; Conquering He keeps the field. If the world full of devils were, Intending to devour us, Trusting in God we little fear, We shall yet be conquerors. The prince of this world With his envious frown Can not injure us. Why ? Because he is judg'd, A simple word can fell him. The word of God they shall let stand, Even without thanks for it; He is with us upon the plain With His own gifts and spirit. If they take our life, Goods, honour, child and wife, Let it pass away, It is no gain to them, God's kingdom is still ours. Glory to God upon His throne, The Father ot every grace, Who out of love gave us His Son, To restore with God our peace. Holy Ghost sublime, Guide us clear of sin, Lead us on the way Into eternity Of life rejoicing. Amen. NOTEâ€”Founded upon Psalm xlvi; composed by Luther A. D. 1630. The most famous and heroic saored poem of German chorals; translated into English by Theodor Polack. 624
