THE SNOW. Lo ! what wonders the day hath wrought Born of the soft and slumbrous snow ; Gradually silent, slowly wrought { Jfiven as an artist thought by thought Writes expression on lip and brow. Hanging garlands the leaves o'erbrim, Deep drifts smother the paths below; The »lm» are shrouded, trunk and limb, And all the air is dizzy and dim With a whirl of danoing, dazzling snow. Dimly oat of the baffled sight Houses and ohnroh-spires stretch away; The trees, all spectral mid still and white. Stand up like ghosts in the failing light, And fade and fain with the blinded day. Down from the roofs in gusts are harled The eddying drifts to the waste below j And still is the banner of storm unfurled, Till all the drowned and desolate world Lies dumb and white in a trance of snow. Slowly the shadows gather and fall, Still the whispering snowflakes bsatj Night and darkness are over all i Best, pale eity, beneath their pall I Sleep, white world, in.thy winding-shset. Clouds may thicken mid storm winds breathe; On my wall is a glimpse of Borne Land of my longlng'J—and underneath Swings and trembles my olive wreath; Peace and I are at home i Fiomnm Fumt.
