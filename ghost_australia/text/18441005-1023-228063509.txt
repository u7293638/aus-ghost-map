I KENNA WHAT'S COME O'ER IIIM. Air. — " O, wat ye wha's in yon town. I kenna what's come ower him, He's no the lad he used to be; I kenna what's come ower him, The blyihe blink has left his e'e, He wanders dowie by bimsel', Alatig the burn and through the glen ; His secret grief he wmna tell — I wish that he would smile again. There was a time alake the day I Ae word o'mine would mak' him glad ; But noo, at'every word I say, I think he only looks mair sad, The last time I gaed to theiifnir, Wi' Willie o'the birken cleugh, Like walkin' ghost he met us there — And sic a storm was on his brool I'm wae to see the chiel sae glurti, Sae dismal like frae morn to e'en ; Than sic a cast as this had come, I'd rather Willie ne'er ha'e seen.- 1 kenna what's come ower him, He's "no the lad he used to be ; I kenna what's come ower him— The blythe blink has left his e'e —Greenock Advertiser,
