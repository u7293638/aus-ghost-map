CONTESTS TO ROME. We gave in our last number a list of twenty-four fellows and other members of colleges in the Uni-<*> versity of Oxford who had seceded from the establish-<*> ment. To these must now be added, to the complete list— 25\. Rev. W. F. Winfield, M.A., student, Christ Church. 26\. Rev. Frederick R. Neve, M.A., OrieL 27- Thomas Meyriek, M.A., scholar, Corpus Christi. 28\. Rev. Charles H. Collyns, M.A., student, Christ Church, and licensed curate of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford. 29\. Rev. Frederic Oakeley, M.A., chaplain fellow of Baltiol College, and late of Margaret-street Chapel. Mr Collyns resigned the studentship at Clirist Church on Friday last, and proceeded to Prior-park, Bath, to join the Romish communion, sn Monday last. Mr Collyns is the third student, and the sixth member of Christ Church, who has thus been conducted by the Regius Professor of Hebrew into the arms of Borne. Alas! how mam' more are there who are in a position in which they may not remain with honour, advance without sacrifice, or retreat without chance. Mr Col lyns has acted under the license of the recently re moved Bishop of the diocese all but up to the period of secession; and it is credibry asserted that a'ma-' jority at laast of the parochial clergy of the University metropolis entertain similar sentiments. Truly Bishop Wilberforce will have an Augean stable to cleanse. We hear from Oxford that another secession, and moodier among the same clas*>, may be looked for."— Church ami Mat* Gmwettv. Nov. 1. The last additions to the list of converted clergy •re thus given: 31\. Rev. E. W. Faber, University Colle re. 3? Rev. W. U. Richards, M.A^ Exeter College. 33\. Rev. James Caiman, R^ Worcester Cottege, and it adds the name of E. Earl Welby, Esq., M..JL, Fellow of Magdalene Colkpe. "We have excellent reason for knowing,** says the Gazette, ** that the Romanists consider the seces sion of Mr Faber from the Church of England as nest in importance to that of Mr Newman. Of Messrs Oakeley and Ward they make very light accouut; as well they may. Both the conduct and writings of the latter gentlemen have materially lowered them in the estimation of their Popish friends. It is a Mil tanian-Satanic mayim t that it is better **to rule in hell than serve in heaven"—such, we are told, was the guiding sentiment of the prince of apostates. Some of bis followers, however, instead of exchanging humble usefulness for bad eminence, find themselves an having abandoned a righteous service for a cruel slavery; and, of course, without enjoying either the sympathy of their victims or their tyrants. However this may be, the secessions continue, and it is freely rumoured that, in addition to those already known, many m* mbers of colleges have gone over, whose names It is not thought proper to communicate jet to the public. TT*e Cmzette rages against Bishops, colleges, and Priests of it* mm communion, tuqme ad nmmuemnu The Cktrrck and *Ude Gazette names T. Hood, Esq., barrister, one of the congregation of St. Mar garet's, as having been added to the church; and says, that one of the chaplains of the Bishop of London Is on the point of being admitted into the Romish Church. A clergyman in the diocese of Gloucester and Bristol, the Rev. Mr Beeves, of Aston Keynes, near Cirencester, has resigned his living, and declared his secession to the Church of Borne. Some consternation has been experienced in the Protestant circles of tins dry by the defection of the Rev. C. Collyns, from the Protestant Established Church of these realms. The reverend doctor was formerly noted as one of the sturdiest opponents of Catholic chums. This young man was an exemplary divine, with promising expectations. The last time we saw him in the county he was ** mining suit in an honourable fashion" to the fair daughter of a country clergyman. The courtship advanced beyond declar ation and acceptance. The day was all but fixed, and the young lady was quite prepared for change of name and scene. In an evil hour this divine swain visiting the north of Devon, met with Dr Pusey at lifracombe, and saw the ** sham pretences'* of protes tantism after a few interviews. He renounced the fiuthofhis fathers, the lady of his affections, and the well-buttered bread of his temporal bile. He pro claimed himself a convert to Borne, and a penitent for his past transgressions.— Western Times. On All Saints* Day, Mr Newman received the Sa cramentof Confirmation in the chapel of Oscott Col lege, at the hands of Dr Wiseman, Coadjutor Bishop of the Midland District. Mr Oakeley, Mr St. John, and Mr Walker, who have lately baen received into the Roman Catholic Church, received confirmation at the sans twte.—Morning Putt. On the 19th November, the Rev. Frederick W. Faber, Rector of Elton, with seven of his parishoniers, accompanied also by Thomas Francis Knox, Esq., B. JL, Trinity College, Cambridge, made public pro fesskm of the Catholic faith in our collegiate chapel of St. Felix, Northampton; and on the following day they received the sacrament of Confirmation and the Holy Communion. Mr Wells, of Trinity College, Cambridge, was re ceived into the church at the Cathedral in Birming ham on Monday, where, on Tuesday morning, two clergyman of the establishment arrived for the purpose of making their profession of faith. On Tuesday three clergymen of the Anglican Church, Messrs Gienaie, Marshall, and Coop, were, with Mr Wood mason, of Littlemore received into the church at Ox ford, whercseveni other clergyman were expected.— ftMet, 29th Nov. The Morning HenM says in receiving the clerical secessions quoted in the Okarch end State Gazette: — We may add that w? have heard, and believe, that the widow and daughter of a late Rector of Fathom have been earnestly endeavouring, very recently, to obtain astertFufliamfbralarge Romish chapel and con vent. Another journal informs us that "the Lord Bishop of Oiena, the Bight Rev. V.A. of the district, has taken possession of land for the erection of a chapel for Hackney, and for a convent of the Sisters of Charity." But what most surprises people is, that amidst att this there is not the slightest movement on the part of the authorities of the Church either to check or to counteract, or in any way to remedy the evil. Rather would it appear, from their complacent Ruencc, that they are well pleased, and entirely satis fied, with what is going on. There ore hundreds who are still preaching the same semi-Rotnish doc trines which have landed Newman, Oakeley, Ward, and Wingneld, in the apostacy. And while* the con nection continues between cause and effect, and trac tarianism m still suffered to lodge within our Church's precincts, we may safely calculate on a constant stream of apostates to Romanism ; passing over without ex citing, apparently, any alarm, scarcely any disappro bation, among those who are supposed to be guardians wf our Protestant Church!
