ORIGINAL POETRY. "I'VE FLUNG THE BOWL AWAY." I've flung away the bowl! No more for me shall pour It's sparkling vein and flowing soul In brightness brimming o'er. I've seen its baleful tide With devastating sway, Sweep strength and reason far aside,— I've flung the bowl away. I've seen—that cup partaking— Religion's lamp expire, Honor her seat forsaking, Seen truth become a liar, Seen fairest women yield Their choicest charms a prey, And die like flowers of the field— I've flung the bowl away! Unto me offer never, Again that cup of sin, It is destruction's quiver, Death's arrows are therein; Thence, ghosts of duties rise, In multiplied array, With fingers pointing to the skies, As to a reckoning day. My days and nights of glee How gladly I resign, They are but masks of misery, Too long they gilded mine; A drunkard's unblessed grave Shall ne'er be dug for me, Rather be mine the whelming wave, Be mine the unfathom'd sea. Henceforth my path is plain, Open and well defin'd, To guard against a single stain, In conduct or in mind. With spirit free from thrall To live, and bless the day, When I was led without recall, To fling the bowl away.
