Newcastle Items. Newcastle, Friday. A young lady named Holmes was proceeding aboard .the City of Brisbane for Sydney last night when the stage plank slipped, and she fell backwards into the harbour. A waterman named Treleavan rescued her, and she was taken home. The Bev. J. Osborne'e leeture on the Irish question last night was listened to by a large audience, the Victoria Theatre being crammed to the doors. Dr. Creer, J.P., presided, and the enthusiasm was unbounded at times. The National Anthem was Bung, all standing, and loud cheers were given for the Queen and the lecturer. * The weather to-day is cool, but bright. There are no signs of Wigging's storm. The so-called ghost at Shepherd's H^I has been attracting numbers nightly to the cliffs close to where the city of Newcastle was wrecked. The peculiar phenomenon appears to be the re sult of phosphorescence, and is generally visible from 9 p.m. to midnight, when the tide is not too high.
