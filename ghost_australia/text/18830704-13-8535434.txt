(Hear, hear ) He was glad to see the reference to the water question, and trusted the Government would see tho necessity of bringing forward a mennure to promote irrigation Further legis- lation hnd been long required for the preserva, tion ofthepublichcalth, and in connexion with that question he trusted the one of drainage of the metropolitan districts would be consi- dered, and that a metropolitan board ot works would lie appointed lion members would be glud to sec that the Harbour Trust question was also to he dealt with It had been a disgrace to this country that a body of men w ho had been appointed to carry out certain works had not been able to do so foi want of legislation, and he trusted now theio was a strong Ministry that the Harbour Trust would tie placed in a position to carry out the improvement of the port of Mel- bourne The Harbour Trust was not only intended to benefit the port of Melbourne, but their works would also to some extent prevent the dangers from Hoods, and he would have been glad if there had been some, thing more definite in the speech m reference to a scheme to prevent those dangers The question of mining on private property was one that lind been hung up between heaven and earth for somo years, and he hoped that Bomo good measure respecting it would bo brought forw ard tins SOSBIOII which would pass both I louses, and giv c an impetus to the min- ing industry He was glad the Government hod taken the question of the defences in hand, und hoped the local forces would ha reorganised so that the country could have something to show for the expense it had been put to for defensive purposes. The Government intended to push forward Borne works to insure the safety of the travelling public-he alluded to the sub way under Swanston street, near Prince's bridge, tho Swan street ciOBSing at Richmond, and the junction nt South Yarra When the intended improvements were carried out they w ould minimise the risk of accidents at thos pomts, and no matter whateostwasrequired, lie tniuted the House w ould meet the propo- sitions for them m a liberal spirit Thoia was no necessity for lum to delay the House further , and he would conclude by saying that he trusted there would be no opposition for the mere sake of talking, but that at tim end ot the session so much work would hav a liccn done that it might acquire tim nnme of " The Practical Legislation Ses sion " (Hear, hear ) He thanked lion, members for the v erv kind consideration they had accorded him (Cheers ) Mr M'INTYREsaid that many measures affecting the mining industry which were very much required were not mentioned ni the speech One that he looked for most anxiously w as the Forfeiture of bhures Bill, and the omission of it would give colour to the statement made when the Government was formed that the Munster of Mines knew nothing of mining He (Mr M'Int}re) did not concur with tho remark, because tim bon gentleman had had some experience, at all events, in mining mutters Still he must say that the urgent necessity for legislation on Bcvornl subjects connected with the> mining industry should have been set fur ward distinctly m the speech The inovei and seconder of the address ni reply were to be congratulated for thu manner in which they had performed then duty, and the Go vernmint deserved eiedit for being able to select two gentlemen who could deal so suc- cessfully with the subjects referred to in the speech He agreed with the seconder that there should have been some refeicnce to thu proposed establishment of u metropolitan bonni of works The whole colony wus intercBted in the mutter, because» any pingue in Melbourne arising from delective drainage would nffeet the en- tire people. Considering the strong de- mands for such ii board there should have been somo refeicnce to it The jmce tit i e stxlance of the occasion wau the Railway Management Bilk and the mention of it showed that the Constitutional section of tho Cabinet had iieeii very successful in inducing the Chief Secretary to turn one of those somersaults\for which ho was celebrated. At the beginning of the session in April, 1882, the non gentleman cnticmed i> 'V posai of the O'Loghlcn Government to si uia the better management of the railways by snying that nn improvement could not be gamed by a statute, but by applying brain'» to the administration of the department His speech on that occasion appealed to riso in judgment ngamal lum now, and he (Mr. M Intyio) was glad thnt ho had Been the error of Ina wn} s, and that the persuasion of the Premier had shown lum that w hat he said on that occasion was utter!} wrong-that the time lind really arrived when the manage- ment of tho railways should be placed in other hands At the some time hu thought it right to warn the Government that m eschewing w hat was called political patronage they might bo dropping out of the l rj Hispan into the fire, and that whilst tho country desired to sec an improvement in tho control of the railways, it did not w ish that they should be handed over to two or threo irresponsible gentlemen Great responsibility alwa)8 rested with a member of Parliament who exercised patronage, because he could always be challenged if he did niiythiiij wrong but if the railways wero handed over to a board ot independent gentlemen, it might be found that they exercised patronage in a way that would bo v cry prejudicial to the real interests of the country He hud always advocated un alteration but the question should be carefully consideied before such a valuable piece of propert) us the railways was handed over to three tcntlemen, who wcic not to bo responsible in any way I he country was not likely to cain so much by the elinnge as was anticipated Hie same remark would apply to tho proposal to abolish patronnée in other departments Ho was anxious to see a change m the sjstem of appointments and promotions in the civil service but he would warn the Government as to the lines upon which theyBhould travel Ho had alwajs foreseen the danger of allow ing heads of departments entire control in such matters, and if no one outside was to ba permitted to say a word-if a member ot Par hument was not to be allowed even to give a letter of recommendation-there would be a repetition of those days which led to tin sacrifice of the curled darlings as thej were called Hie people m the countr) would expect to have a fair share of the patronage and if a system of examinations was en tub hshccl the lads of Melbourne and those in the country districts would have an equal chance of securing employment He was pleased to find that there was a uniimnut) of /colin, on this subject in the Cabinet, and if any advim tate were derived by the countr) from the extraordinary combination of parties if would be in the attainment of tins principle 1 he coalition had done good m that dircc tion and he was there to say he would fcivi the Government every assistante in passinj beneficial legislation At the sanio tune Ministers must he prepared for severe criti emms even from members who weie at pre sent sitting behind thom One of the special points made in the Governor s speech was that relating to the annexation of New Guinea. No doubt it was very pleasing to hear ol tLe action of Queensland in this matter, but tlie Government had been in too grent a hurry to rejoice, foi information had just come ta hand that the Imperial Government declined to ratify the action of Qucenulund But he (Mr M'Intyre) objected more strong!} to tlie course which om Government had followed in its administrative capacity during tho recess They did wrong m attempting to interfere with the New Hebrides without reference to the House They even went sa far as to pledge the country to pay nuythintf that might be necessary for the manage ment and control of the islands In such a matter les that the Assembly had a right ta be consulted The Government could no1 excuse themselves by entering any plea ot urgenc}, tor there waa no necessity tor any hurí} They were, however, anxious to gain some lillie kudos by preferring tile request for the annexation of the islands before any other Government could do so It wies trua thnt some missionaries did wait on th« Premier, and asked lum to do this, but ni common courtesy to tho House he ought to have waited before doing anything until Parliament was opened In writing tlie para- graph relating to the Intercolonial C'onfei ence the Government in simple fairness might have stud that all the honour con- nected with the matter was due to the Into , Postmaster General, who arrunge«! the wliol; affnn [Here tlie bon. member was in- terrupted by the accidental extinguishing of (lie electric light with which tlie chamber was illuminated, but when, after a few minutes, tlie gas was lit he resumed his remarks.] With regard to the junction of the railway BJ sterna of Victoria and New South Wales, ho thought that at the opening de- monstration a want ol courtesy was shown by those who managed tho affair toward« the Victorian guests, inasmuch as the New South Welshmen arrived at Albury an hour and a half before the Victorians Having heard tbe Victorian Premier at Albury, he was snr piised that nothing was said m the Gover- nor's speech about the border tariff system or tho stock tax -ho Premier was enthusiastic ebont federation when at Albury, but lie had So far done nothing to bring about that de Bired end 'Ibu TanlT CommihSion had almost unanimonsly adopted thor stock tax report, and the present Government should have unhtsitatuigl) taken the matter in band He was afrard, however, that it was one ot the skeletons in the Ministerial cup board During the progress of the- session he w ould di mond that the) should take nctxm on the report alluded to As to the Police Commissions report, he had to ask why the Government had not given effect to that portion m which the appoint- ment of a board of management waa recommonded, with the view of prevent mg outside or political interférence with the .orce ' And, on the other hand, w hat justin cation had the) for sending three detectives into the country districts as a puuisliment, and for refusing these otlicers the lioard of inquiry which they liad t irm.stl) asked for' llespectmg the reorganisation of the volun teer force, Major Sargood s ideas might be v ery good, but w ould it not be a mistake to male any changes in the s)stem bcfoic the Imperial otlicexs who had boen secured at home arrived here, and were enabled to assist the Government with their advice' He was glad to see that the estimates were to bo presented before the money was spent 'Iho addrcBS omitted a great many important matters, and really contained very little.
