A DAY OF PRAYER. TO ITHE EDITOR. Sirâ€”It has been agreed to follow the example of the Melbourne Minister's Prayer Union, and arrange for an all day of- prayer on Thursday, October 3. The object is to supplicate an outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all churches, and all who believe in the Holy Ghost are invited to be present. Particulars of time and place will be supplied next week in your advertising columns. Meanwhile let me commend this subject to your readers, and beg their prayers that the day of prayer may be a time of great blessing to all Christians, and the beginning of a great revival all over the land. Yours Trnly, R. M. HUNTER.
