Then stands 'musing v uiniiioiit with his back to tlio fireplace. " Thorn ton, 1 stn n plain -man,"-; ho answers. ": Whatever you havo to communicate 1 pray you .let mo hoar it iv plain Eng lish." .'• Tlioro are aomo matters that are not lo ho given-in plain English, general," responds Thornton, seating himself near where tlio general is standing., ."Allow mo to ask you a qnostion. llnvo you ever heard from your son Teii'ipl.

"No, no, it is nothing .old friend—n passing spasm," says «*re other in a husky voice, mid waving .tlio lawyer to his soat, " Unfortunately my liver is nono of tho Foundc.it aflor ton yoars' sbrvico in India. You mentioned something about my sou. What was it ?" " I asked if you had ovor.heard from your boy Tctnplo sinco ho loft you," re peats Thornton, standing before his com panion, nnd looking earnestly into his ptilu faco. "Look you, Asliford, I take thu privilege of our friendship tv tell you that I, PhilipTliornton, v crusty bachelor, ignorant alike of the nubtlo feeling pater nal, nnd the joy of married life—love this boy of yours aa if ho was flesh of my flesh: My dear old friond, why should yuu anil I mako it wall of words J You hnvo b son " " I had," interrupted the • general quickly, with n passionate gesture of his arm. " Iliad a son, but ho sought to dishonor mo." "Not s.i, sir.. Youth.is over prono to brr when temptation lends tlio way. Dis honor menus lying, cheating, ami what not. To bo dishonorable is tv trick, de ceive, cozen, nnd defraud, ami if I know anything of thu/ world and its ways, one who practices such deception must be a ■nan well np in artifice, liuussu, and iiii lMnturo. Will you tell mo that Temple Asliford was, or erer. could be sncli.. ono ?" " A camblor nnd a profligate," mut tered the general with writhing'lips. " Neither, sir. 111 s'.iko my reputa tion," ruturnod tlio atlnrnoy, holly. "The poor lad, tntally unacquainted with dts hoiinr, ls-ns hut the du|te uf thosu whu practised it ; elso ho would uut' have acted as he did." " I cannot enter the lists with"you, Phil,'* rcsisonded Sir George, turning his white ft.co towards his friend. " 'Words aro your weapons — logic, your pro fession." " Just so. Yuu havan-t tho ghost ol a case," said tho lawyer, with a grim smile. " Now look hero, I don't want nt. nntu motit; it would spoil toy dinner. Here is a letter received by mo yesterday ; could you gurus who sent it ?" General Asliford locked his thin hands together, but made nun ply. " Will you have thu cutirto-y to read it ?" cried Thornton, holding the misaivo towards him. . " Why should I poruso your cones jHitnlence, Thornton ?" " UiTcaiise it concerns you." Tito old oflicur took the letter in his trcutbling hands. While he placed his gold spectacles ou his nnso, Philip Thorn ton rose from his sent, and became all at onco deeply hitortsted in a valuable oil painting at the other end of tho apart ment. This-picture was a gem in its way, and had boon paintetl by sine of thu first masters of tho slay. Subject—'• Tlio return of the Prodigal." In its applica tion tho artist had taken a slopnrturo from tlio well known scriptural story. Yet it was the same matter and material ns thnt which happened a thousand years ago, which happened ten thousand years be fore that—nay, which happens every day of our lives. Tlie old lawyor had seen the painting a hundred times, or more. Ho know by hoart every slrcak of light mid shade in it; from tho dull, leaden English sky, to thu two solitary figures in tho foreground. Tho limping, weary, repentent youth, and the forgiving, loving father with out stretched arms; but,- notwithstanding his knowledgo of these things, Philip Thornton looked long, .and with all ab sorbing interest- Hu liad expected seme token of approval or dissent from his companion—somo exclamation or word, whereby he might gunge tho foelings of tho general towards his prodigal, but in this the lawyer waa disappointed. Turn ing his gaze from tho picture to his com panion, Thornton boheld tho latter fallen to tho floor. Tho general's white head lay upon his breast as if ho slept, but thu broad chest roso and fell in strong and pent up emotion. Noisulessly opening thu door the lawyer glided out into the corridor,' where Vano and tbo sergeant stood expectantly. "Go in, Temple, and Heaven bless you,'my boy," whispered Thornton, and the prodigal entered. Philip'Thornton immediately closed the door on the outside. . " Look here, Gunn," he cried to tho sorgeant, "I'm ou sentry over this room, fetch mo a glassl of wino and a biscuit, aiid order dinner to be put back fur one lour. If you allow any of tho woman kind (o como beyond yon corridor, egad, I'll havo you tried by. court martial. Now, begone 1" '• I'd like to shako hands with you, sir, blnwod if 1 wouldn't 1" answered tlte'old fellow, with tears in his eyes.
