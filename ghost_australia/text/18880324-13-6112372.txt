LONDON TO OWN TALK. I (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, FEB. 17. It is a trite observation indeed that our lives and happiness depend upon the most burlesqued decrees of 1 ale. The axle tree of a railway carriage, snapped by the frost, may find half a dozen of us, or half a bunched, at the great terminus of life, in a few moments, of some growth in the brain, no bigger than a pin point, may transform the gentlest of natures into that of a demon But it is not so generally understood or we should not find so many people boasting of " their independence of their fellow crea tures-how our well being depends upon the behaviour of others and especially (if we live in an unattached row of houses) on that of our neighbour. Not a week elapses without some complaint to the magistrate about some nuisance next door We are supposed to be a Christian community, and yet in the most church going neighbourhoods there are always people to be found who will play their pianos, though they know on the other side of the party wall lies some poor wretch in the agonies of brain fever, or will keep a dog that nowie all night, and drives the sleep that is his only chance of his from his eyes Last week it was the crowing of a cock, the bird-much more detestable than the " hateful crow, ' since he has the crow in addition which almost drove the philosopher of Chelsea to in edness, perhaps it was even the self same bird for it also dwelt in Chelsea. It was kept by a clergyman, and no doubt for some good purpose , but it was stated by a lady suffering from spinal complaint that it had shattered her nerves for nine months, on one occasion "crowing 20 times between 6 o'clock in the morning and half post "It would certainly not have crowed nine months and had lived next door I read that " th<) very night of the hearing at the police court," the re terend gentleman's fowlhouse was broken into, and every fowl stolen, including chanticleer Well, of course, but how in measuring tardy was the foot of justice t I have a friend who had a sick wife, perse cured by a piano friend next door, who commenced his tortures at 10 p.m. In reply to a homed remonstrance be wrote that he was devoted to music, and had no opportunity of beginning practice earlier , he had taken legal advice, and was informed that not even temporary cessation could Be insisted upon and in short, the torture went on My friend was fortunately rich He moved his wife, though at some hazard, from her home Then he procured a piano, or something rather in a piano case, for there was nothing piano about it, the effect of which, when struck, was to present to the ear a combination of the the rough music that captivates the bee He marrow bone and cleavers, and the jew a harp, also lured two powerful artistes with instructions to begin at 10 a.m. and, taking turn and turn about, never to cease till daylight In vain the musician next door shifted his instrument into another room which be had declined to do for the poor lady's sake The artistes shifted theirs, so as always to accompany him," and, eventually, the unaccommodating villain threw up his lease in despair and left the neighbourhood It was a triumph scored by Dives for once on the side of virtue "What would you have done if, instead of a piano, it had been a dog in the man's back garden ' ' I inquired of my friend "I supposed at the chemist's and Id at the butchers would, in that case, have then settled it He shook his head distasteful not SO clear and so cheap a plan " No, sir, I should still have left the house, but in my back garden I should have kept a hyena." The latter day Huicto has been letting the public into the secret of certain private little arrangements which are sometimes made between us poor folk of Grub street and the gentlemen of the city. It publishes a letter addressed to a popular novelist by the secretary or an hotel company -" Dear Sirs-I am authorised to secure an author to write a novel, by a wealthy corporation, said novel to be the name of a large hotel, and the scene mainly to lie therein, are." YY Uli this kind of application I am myself quite conversant, and I should say that this was a favourable aspect men of it I like its indifferent grammar, and the expression said novel" sounds like business Perhaps it was not until the pecuniary arrangements proved insufficient that the novelist felt compelled, in the interests of literature, to make such a scandalous proposition public I remember the first overture that came to me from the city well A club acquaintance, whose name I knew and that was all, called upon me one morning at my private residence "You are surprised to see me, no doubt," he said, " and still more so when I say I come on business " I murmured something about being charmed to see him, but he waved that away with a few elledfiugcr, he was very expen Btv ely attired, and looked stout and prosperous. " To come to the point at once," he continued, " I wanted to write a novel for mc ' He had come rather too soon to the point, and his proposal fairly stupefied me with amazement He was not a man to read novels, nor any thing else, certainly not to be so sweet upon them as to order one to be written for his private perusal. "I don care whether it a short or long he went on," but it must fill a volume You may) put what stuff in it you please, but you must put your name to it. There is no other condition but one which I will tell you presently, and I'll give you 500 guineas for the work " The proposed, though quite unintelligible, seemed to me very handsome A man must be seen tree, and get his cheque be honoured at his bankers YY hat on the condition'' " " Only that the scene of the novel shall be laid in Arcadia-the name was not Area did, but that of a country about as far off, and of which I was equally ignorant " It's a lovely place, and will suggest splendid passages of description padding I believe you call it He did not mean to be offensive, but he was "If you Better yourself," I said " that I am going to this infernal spot' -" Pooh, pooh, not a bit of it, he struck in come to this office There you will see plans of the country I mean maps and pictures , books of reference, everything to a man of your imagination it will be as good as having been there " Letter," I Bald decisively. "Very well, look me up today in the city There is my card " And he was gone. I went to his office and saw his map and the pictures, and brought away a whole Arcadian library) in the cab, I was pleased with the commission and thought I could do it, but why did he want it done, was a question that made me pause On my way I looked in upon a college friend whom I could trust, in Lincoln's Inn, and laid the case before him. "How refreshing it is," he said, "to find a contemporary still SO young W.ants you to puff Arcadia does he' Did you never read of the thriving city of iJdon"' "Good heavens'" I exclaimed, perhaps it's swamp), and he wants me to per- suade people to emigrate there Why, I should be committing a criminal offence " "No, you would not be doing that The court would only say), when the bubble burst tins story teller appears to be a sort of Moses poet in prose but that would be worse than any review you ever had in your life" I had had some nasty ones, but I felt that he spoke the truth, and I returned the Arcadian library to its owner that very day, with a polite note declining the commission, but the Arcadian novel came out by another name for all that The question of beard or no beard has broken out again, and that of moustaches has been added to It A barber of great experience writes that in many cases they simply greW into men's mouths, and has the nude city to recommend our young princes to set the example of wearing false ones, whereby the ambitious would be satisfied, and at the same time avoid the present discomfort by taking them off when eating and sleeping. He says, very sensibly, that the fashion of being cropped like convicts makes men subject to cold. How do people manage by the by, who have no razors or scissors ' Savages are very long haired, we know, but how about their nails' They can't bite them, or at least not all of them What do they do! Yet another "infallible remedy for seasick ness " Ima lately been discovered, and doubtless as good as the rest Remedies for seasickness are like ghosts, things of which other people have an experience more or less trust- worthy to relate, but never oneself Like the shorthand writer who is BO swift and accurate before the orator, begins to speak, they are excellent before you, go on board Champagne used to be considered a specific , I have known persons who had faith in it take a whole bottle before sturt ing, and be no better for it than if they had been teetotallers to take a hearty meal on shore the last thing was another remedy as inefficacious us it was wasteful to lie down at once, and keep your eyes fixed upon one particular object, was a plan very much thought of One might just as well have stood on ones head, and observed mankind from China to Peru, upside down There is no subject, I believe with the exception of Classical Education and an Hereditary Ans toto about which such rubbish has been written as this cure for sea sickness "If you take wine you will have the gout, and if you don't take vine you will have the gout," is a true saying, equally applicable to this malady And the same thing is true of ships Ships may be built, for all I know (though I greatly doubt it so us not to loss, or roll, or pitch, but they cannot be devised so as not to sink down, down fathoms, miles, while the brain reels and the BOUR grows faint, and then come up again with a disgusting levity, to assure you you are not going to be drowned (as you hoped), but that it's all going to happen over again There is only one method of building ships that offers escape from him torture , they must be built much longer, so as to reach from shore to shore Then the passengers will not do it A gentleman has brought an action for libel against a newspaper for accusing him of plagiarism, and laid the damages at 1000a As the affair is still sub- judice, it would be improper (as being likely to influence the Jury in his favour to say I wish he may get it. He is not an author himself, or I am sure he would be less virtuously indignant about such an accusation 'His charge is not only common in the literary world, but even a compliment II a writer is successful, there are at war) in two indictments against him first, that his works have no merit, second, that if they have, it belongs to some body) else A novelist (determined, I suppose, to give such detractors something to talk about) once put six whole pages out of a well known historical work into his novel "Really'" he said, when confronted by the critics with the evidences of his crime " Well, that only SHOWS how true that is that there is nothing new under the Bun ' '1 hat was an extreme case I admit, but even Shakspeare was rather prone to what an other class of rogues (the lawyers) call conveyancing, and he took no great pains to conceal it Charles Reade bud in heroic way of meeting charges of this sort it was William Howitt, I think, who complained of the material of his travels in Austria having been made use of by the novelist without acknowledgment, for the scenes in his Never Too Late to Mend But he at once explained to him that he, Charles Reade, was a man of genius, and just as Shakspeare had made use of doubtless meritorious but very inferior authors for his own purposes, so had he taken the same liberty " You ought to be pleased, my dear fellow, for I touch nothing that I do not adorn " I should like to know what Howitt replied, for he too (and not without reason had a good opinion of his works , but I only heard one side of the s for), though certainly from one who ought to know A sham heiress, with no less (elie affirmed) than £2,000,000, has been swindling a good many people in a district of England where money is termed "brass" (she really had lots of brass, and perhaps excused herself on that account) She gave magnificent presents out of the same she got lent to her- procured on the ground that there was a temporary dull cult) in realising her capital. Never has the worship of gold though in this case it was but a paper currency-been illustrated more happily, of the proverb that " the rich make many friends ' Because it was understood that she wanted for nothing, people could not do enough for her. She was neither young, beautiful, accomplished, nor (as it would seem) de [ii) relations, but she at once became the idol of the neighbourhood I can't say I am very sorry for them " Never borrow money of a poor man," says the old saying, but one might surely) add "nor lend money to a rich one." It doesn't always return a hundredfold as one had expected I remember an honest old farmer in Wiltshire, who, before the present evil days befel the agricultural interest, found himself very much out of elbows he had still a great deal more credit than he deserved, and indeed from the poor way in which (from necessity he lived was accounted wealthy Suddenly he resolved to change his tactics. Honesty, he had heard, of course, was the best policy, but it might not be so, at all events he would give the other thing a fair trial He was nearly 70 years of age, which gave him a great advantage in the scheme he had devised, which was to make great friends with his well to do neighbours, and very con- fidentially (for if it were known, he said, others would naturally resent it to leave each of them all he had in the world For the next five years he lived at their expense (and it was never grudged him) like a fighting cock Never had penniless old gentleman so good a time. He was buried with great pomp and ceremony by the last legatee, who came in for all his debts, and a good deal of rich eulo. Of course, disagreeable things were said of the deceased, but he did'nt hear them, and nobody could say he robbed the poor So the new evening dress men are to wear is to include knee breeches and silk stock inga, is it' Then there is one person at least who will be henceforth missing from fashionable assemblies It is quite impossible for a thin man, who has any self-respect to exhibit himself in such an attire It is the court dress, I am well aware , but courtiers are not remarkable for self respect i they have no objection to appear in "leg pieces ' On windy days, when the clothes cling close to the limb, I have heard impudent street boys whisper to one another, " I wonder how that old cove can venture out upon such things ' Let us turn from these painful con- fessions to the historical view of the matter Silk Stockings are not popular with men even now, because they are cold, but at the beginning the last century HILV were also so exceedingly dear that the price was utmost prohibitive Under these circumstances an ingenious 1 Couchman (M Bon) conceived the design of making them out of spider a webs He spun or rather his spiders did-a pair of stockings for the Duc de bundles, which were acknowledged to be the finest in the world 'the Society of Science took the thing up, but it proved a failure. It was found difficult to breed spiders, who only multiply where he don't want them , moreover, 288 spiders could only spin IIB much silk as one silkworm, and it took GO.t 652 to made a pound of it Under these circum- stances the society, not having the perseverance of Robert the Bruce's little friend, gave the matter up as a bad job it whether it be true or not that a certain exalted personage misbehaved himself in a theatre on the first night of a new play, one excuse I heard given for him is worth record- ing It fell from the lips of a lady of fashion " If he did make some disturbance," She said, ' we may be sure it was from a good motive 'the play was a wicked one, and I have no doubt he strove to drown the voices of the actors, that such sentiments should not demoralise the audience " Viewed from whatever point I have known few apologies to equal this 1 HtojiuJis from Boston record that in the occasion of his 50th birthday Mr Irving played "Faust" to the largest audience ever assembled in America in a dramatic performance The Motor Journal says Probably not many persons among' the "large audience that applauded Mr Irving's JIM formance knew that it was the actor's bright day, and that he was just 50 years old. has had the pleasure, however, of playing last evening, on this anniversary, to the largest house both in respect! number and more, that he ever had, either in this country or England.
