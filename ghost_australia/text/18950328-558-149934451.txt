MISSION TO MEN. The interest in the mission was evi denced by an encouraging increase in the attendance at last night's service, and the hearty enthusiasm which marked the gathering. The missioner, before com mencing his service, made allusion to the satisfaction which he felt in the attend ance of so many men at the services. He urged all to endeavor to be present at the service on Monday evening next, when the Bishop has promised to preach at the close of the mission. The subject of the l sermon last night was " The foundation I truths of the Universal Faith." The universal kingdom of Christ has a j changeless creed. It is founded on the resurrection of Christ, which was not a ; return to this life, but a passage through death to life beyond. By His resurrec tion, and by the coming of the Holy j Ghost at Pentecost, the full truth of the Godhead is revealed, and we are assured j that Christ, who was delivered for our j offences, was raised again for our justi fication.
