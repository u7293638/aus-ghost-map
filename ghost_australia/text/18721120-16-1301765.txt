The actual running expenses have been 1 dollar 45 cents per day ACCORDING to La Liberte, M Roo de la Barra, a celebrated Belgian pigeon fancier," has proposed to the French Government the formation of a corps of pigeons with a view to service in the next campaign against Germany It is suggested that a staff of pigeon trainers be at once organised at the Jardin des Plantes, and several gentlemen who distinguished them selves as pigeon flyers during the late war are named as suitable members The pigeon corps, which, it is proposed, should number 25,000 birds, would have its head quarters at Paris, but, in view of a possible reinvestment of the capital, an entire division would be stationed at Bordeaux Armies in the field, would, of course be accompanied by pigeons, and it is recommended that pigeons from Paris should, on the outbreak of war, be sent in detachments, averaging a thousand strong, to each of the principal fortresses A FRENCH inventor has patented an apparatus 3 for swimmers For the hands he has a large membranous fin, which is held in its place by loops passing over the fingers, and a strap around the waist Their effect is to reduce very much the effort required to swim without them But the greatest ingenuity is displayed in the form and fitness of the fire for the legs, which are attached to the ankles, and are so formed that they act upon the water both in the movement of bringing the legs together and throwing them back They act as finely m " treading water, as swimmers call it, that one can really walk, if not on the water, at least in it The old swimmer has no trouble in using the fire on the first trial, and is surprised to find with what ease he can swim without exhaustion THE Brigade of Gendarmery of Saint Benoit du Sault (France) was informed some days ago that nearly the whole population of the place was assembled round the Church of Chatre Longlea, the cause being a strange one. AS O storm was threatening, the inhabitants went to the cure, the Abbe Gaudion, and requested him to organise a religious procession through the streets The priest replied that their demand savored of superstition, and that they had better pray At half-past 10 he commenced his mass in the usual way, but just as he was preparing to ascend the pulpit to preach, some women armed with clubs assailed him with repeated blows, accusing him of being the cause of the late bail storms The abbe had to take refuge in the sacristy, where he was rescued by the gendarmerie Afterwards, as the excitement still continued, he was obliged to take shelter in a neighboring commune An extraordinary love affair has excited much interest at Bowness It appears that a young lady, possessing an income in her own right exceeding 3000 a year, whose hand and heart had been sued for in vain by more than one of the resident gentry, has become infatuated with a young man employed as a servant to the family It is added that, on this discovery being made, the young lady was placed under restraint, and the object of affection dismissed from the service The latter, however, who seems to have warmly reciprocated the passion displayed by his young mistress, promptly took steps to set matters right Knowing that his lover had attained her majority he obtained the assistance of the police, and the restraint under which she had been placed was removed, and, in the end, notwithstanding all the remonstrances of the friends of the lady, she and her spouse elect left Bowness for Cumberland, and the announcement of their marriage is daily looked for THE other day a woman was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labor for having been president of a Communist club, and member of a battalion of women specially charged with the arrest of deserters from the Communal army. It is stated that, now the great offenders have been disposed of the police are continually laying informations against unoffending citizens more or less connected with the de- facto Government of the Commune One of those citizens his just been tried for " usurping functions " He had acted for awhile as a sort of justice of the peace A year ago he was arrested for this offence by the military authorities and dismissed The civil tribunal has now found him guilty but with extremely ' extenuating circumstances, and he has been sentenced to a weeks imprisonment A PARIS correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette writes -SI de Paris has just returned here after a tour in the provinces, during which he guillotined some of the most remarkable criminals of modern times There were the Marseilles men who took their victim out in a boat and tried in vain to sink the body At Lyons M de Paris operated upon a man named Bernard, who seduced a young girl, and then murdered her Shortly after she became a mother, but perhaps the most thrilling drama, taking altogether, was that which was terminated at Arras by the execution of Courcol This misguided wretch Blew his wife with hatchets, and the chief witness against him was his own little boy, who BOW the murder perpetrated, but who pretended to be asleep for fear of being assassinated also After killing his wife, Courcol lighted his pipe and left the house, and his child then jumped out of bed and called to his mother, but she was dead When the lad related this episode on the trial the prisoner became furious and said, " Little viper, I would have settled your business had I known that you were awake" Courcol also indulged in violent invectives against the judge and the police This man has now paid the penalty of his crime, and the torture to which he was subjected reminds one strongly of Le Dernier Jour d un Condarnin,by Victor Hugo On the day of his execution he was aroused at 5 a.m. by the chaplain of the prison, who informed him that his time had come Courcol then received the communion, and was afterwards conveyed to the railway station at St Omer, where he got into a second class carriage between two gendarmes and started for Arras the chaplain accompanying the party At 11 o'clock Arras was reached, and the prisoner was then taken in a police van to the gaol, where refreshments, which he hardly touched, were served up At 1 o'clock he heard a first mass fluid by the Abbe. Singer, chaplain of the prison of Arras and then a second mass by another ecclesiastic At 3 o'clock he re entered the condornnedccll.and therethoprocurcurond other authorities assembled, and the clerk of the court read out the sentence Courcol showed some symptoms of irritation, but did not speak At half-past 3 he had a little conversation with the chaplains, dictated a few lines to his brother, and said his prayers The executioner and his assistants then appeared, and commenced the toilette, over which they bungled to such an extent that the prisoner could not help (miling, and exclaiming " Muludroit " When the time of hal came for getting into the van at the prison door, Courcol hesitated " Courage," said one of the chaplains but the unfortunate man did not move a gendarme pushed him from behind and he fell on his knees , he was dragged thus for some yards, when two warders lifted him into the van, which started off slowly in the direction of the Champ de Mars, where it arrived about 4 o'clock The execution took place in presence of an immense crowd.
