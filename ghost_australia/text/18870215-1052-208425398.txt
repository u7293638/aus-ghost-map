GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S NEW OPERA. All doubts are now set at rest as to the clime and the period of ' the plot and incidents. It is not to be Egyptian or Oriental, but essentially English. It will belong to the ' "short waisted and close fitting pantaloon" period. It was at the introduction' of this fashion, that a celebrated beauty declared that she felt " like a. pair of; scissors wrapped in a pocket handkerchief." The opera has hot yet been christened and the plot even is nob yet known. . The la-test issue of the Pall Mall Gazette, . contains a 'communication from . Mr. W. S. Gilbert, who states " we have, \- not yet decided on the title, but the following will bs the distribution of characters. . Miss .Tesslo Bond ' . as ' Mad Margaret ; (a kind of Modern satire on Ophelia) . Miss Leonora Br-iliam as ' ... Rose May bud (a simple village inaidan) . MlssFlndluy ..as .. ..Zorah ; (a gipsy fortuue teller) Mr. G. Grossmttii sis Robin Onkapplo (a true typo of an Englishman) Mr. Durward Lely as, ...

The music both .vocal and instriihien- ; tal .will have about an '.essentially' English ringj' and it will not be sur prizing if many of the very old" 'English : airs.- are furnished for the occasion. As is the case in Patience where the duet " Willy Willy Waley " is not also but an old country ditty. W.H.W.
