THE HEIR OF THE CROWESTS. Lord Crowest left a widow and three children—two sons and a daughter. The eldest, the young earl, was only six years of age. When her hnsband died, Lady ’- : Crowest ceased : to ; reside at Crowest Court, the family seat in War wickshire. She had a prejudice against the place, though it was the pride of the neighbourhood, and she therefore readily consented to the suggestion, of the trus tees tbat.it should be let for. a term of years.A tenant - was forthcoming in the p'erson of a‘ wealthy Australian mer chant named-’ Palmer. ' This- gentleman became highly, popular in the ; district.- He was a kind- and generous host, a thoughtful neighbour, and a good friend to the popri Ho had-'a pleasant wife and two pretty daughters, • arid '' his wealth naturally obtained for ‘him ,- ad mission into the charined circle -of...the best country society. . . ! :■ Crowest afforded capitid shdptihg, v and the Palmers always had the house full of rather, oddlyjaisorted guests-during the autumn.'- the end of October last - year,’a- young ■ subaltern named Charlie Bathurst was invited: for. a few days. His regiment was stationed at a neighbouring town, and Mr Palmer, happening to hear that the-young ihan was a connection of the Crowest family; ■—a distant cousin of the-late Earl— good- naturedly asked him to come and mate" acquaintance with the ancestral', estate, and more particularly with the excellent preserves.- :: Charlie Bathurst was a handsome, “blue-eyed lad of- 20, who had a happy knack; of ingratiating' himself ,with every one... ,-He was very, boyish, and., his ..honest . simplicity and . high spirits : spoil'won all- > hearts. - ■ His visit to Crowest was c a" decided success, and; it;was prolonged considerably be yond its intended limits; l t On the evening" before the day on wh.ch he false starts— to rejoin 'his' regiment,"themale guests were seated I round the’ smoking-room fire before retiring, to!, rest, when, as fre quently happens.tpwards the witching hour,, of .midnight,-; the .-conversation, turned uponfhe subject of supernatural: apparitions,...Several stories .were., told'- of a blood:curdling,-.tendency, and, at length, someone-asked if Crowest Court did not possess-a haunted roomri-s c-x ‘ Hot thatd know' bf,’ answered Mr Palmer. r -‘ no-ghost Included in the atdeasty'iriidn't;stipulate for one.' " ''' " " s ~‘ """ ‘I .never heard -of-r,there being la ghost*’ interposed a. neighbour]- A who had been prevailed uponto- stay the night; ‘but Ihave : a recollection'‘of hearing, some story about one of the rooms.’ ’ 1 To be sure,’, eagerly added another local magnate. *- There is a legend.-that many years ago—at ihe beginning of:tbe: last centnryr—the -eldest son- of the-then Pord Crowest. murdered a. gnestjn i: his sleep. Ever since, the room in- which the deed was, committed has been; kept ■closed, for it’is said that any lieir of the. Crowe. l ts who sleeps there; will never live till the morning.’ ‘Honscnse 1 Absurd ! '■ An old woman’s- story,’ said Dr, Boulton, a Cambridge Professor who had very -'cut and-dried opinions on most subjects^ * Very, likely 4 I am only repeating what I have heard,’ said the narrator, rather, curtly. ‘Has any heir of the Croweats ever died in the room ?’ enquired Charlie Bathurst, who had ■ listened - open mouthed.' ‘Ah! It would be interesting to know, that,’ said the Professor, who seemed personally aggrieved”'by the Story. .I .. ,v,.J ‘The old,.housekeeper;might know. She has lived with the Croweats all her life.

She was; forced to-admit, , however, that no one had ever died there Within her recollection;. that sho had never seen a ghost, nor been witness to an y supernatural event in connection with the room; and, finally, she was . brought to confess that;the room;was unaccountably..damp,_jvhich._was__the chief reason , of„-its not having been \- ntlligcd; ■ t! ’ -- <■- ' I ‘ There is no 'mystery whatever* you £ee i’ said the Professor, addressing the compa'ny'when the housekeeper had left the room.
