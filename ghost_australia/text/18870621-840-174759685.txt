A Ghost. Those insane people who don white sheets and frequent lonely spots with a view of mak ing a sensation, have been very quiet in Bris bane for a long time past, but once again, some brainless individual is practising this most un manly and dangerous game. The particular spot used by this "calico ghost" is Upper Roma street, and several people have been startled by a figure clad, from head to toe in white, and with outstretched arms suddenly appearing from 10 to 12 yards ahead of them in Upper Roma street. It is somewhat dark at this spot, and the effect of such a sight on a delicate woman or child would be perhaps very injurious. We would warn the idiot, who is thus enjoying his little joke, that should he be caught whilst "treading his ghostly haunts," he must be prepared to wrestle with one or two young men, whose friends have been frightened by him, and he will very likely have to retire from the ghost business for a very considerable time after the said wrestling.
