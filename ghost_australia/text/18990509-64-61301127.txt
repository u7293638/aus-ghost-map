'''] MB. GRIFFITH,' BÃ¯.t.A. This Labour member and ex-teacher in the Sydney Grammar School, has become a benedict, and he and his bride are spending their honeymoon on bicycles. Doubtless the suggestion as to the manner in which the honeymoon should be spent emanated from the bridegroom, for he- has a vein of eccentrity in his nature. At the same time, spending the first few days after marriage in bicycle excursions is, it seems to me, a better way of putting in the time than that adopted by the average bride and bridegroom., The usual practice, I believe, is to moon about all day, without any' definite object in view, with' the result that, they become the subjects of ennui. When they get settled in their new home they tell all their friends that they have had: a glorious time; but immediately give themselves away by saying how glad they are to be in their own house. Mr. Griffiths is a cheerful fellow, and being temperate in his.habits, and fairly well educated, he should make a good husband. But his days as a member of Parliament are, I think, numbered. ,,<I was in his electorate a few. days ago, and I heard there that there is not the ghost of a chance.of his again being chosen as the representative in the Assembly for that place. .The miners have turned against bim; as for..the.other classes, they have always been his opponents.
