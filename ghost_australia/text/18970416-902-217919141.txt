p. 1 THE WASHER OF THE FORD. e.c-Thero is a lonely stream afar in a lone dim j- laud : hath white dust for shore it has, white i bones bestrew the strand : i Ihe only thing that liveth there is a naked leaping sword ; .. But I, who a seer am, have seen the whirl ing hand Of the Washer of the Ford. A shadowy shape of cloud and mist, of gloom and dusk, she stands, The Washer of the Ford : She laughs, at times, and strews the dust through the hollow of her hands. . She counts the sins of all men there, and slays the red -stained horde — The ghosts of all the sins of men must know the whirling sword Of the Washer of the Ford. > . She stoops and laughs when in the dust she sees a writhing iimb : r '.Go baok into the ford,' she says, 'and 2 „ hither and thither swim ; j- Then I shall wash you white as snow, and shall take you by the hand, And slay you here in the silence with this my whirling brand, /: And trample you into the dust of this white t: windless sand' — This is the laughing word f,. Of the Washer of the Ford. k Along that silent strand. — Fiona MoLeod.
