THE LATIN PLAY AT TRINITY COLLEGE It is a great leap backwards from a d 1891 ton c 220 or thereabouts, when the red haired, smartly, corpulent dramatist upon whom his countrymen in Umbria had bestowed the nickname of Plautus, or flat foot on account of the monstrous size and negro like formation of his lower extremities, first produced his " Mostellana in Rome Let us endeavour to reproduce the scene The theatre is an enormous edifice of wood, for we are yet a century and a half removed from the days when the i ellie Scaurus will erect the magnificent structure of which Pliny has left us a description the place is capable of holding from twenty to thirty thousand spectators and they are all "deadheads, for every citizen claims thoughts free admission to the theatre, and the magistrates defray) the expenses of the performance, in return for which they are allowed to occupy reserved seats What we should call the pit and boxes are open to the Bk), and to screen the occupants from the rays of the sun an awning is drawn across the space above But the building is hot and dusty for all that, as the sovereign people are restless, and not over clean, and if it were not for the jets of perfumed water that play upon the screen and descend in showers of spray, the nicer noses among the audience would take offence at the odours emanating from the " rank Scented ' multitude As for the actors, the) are little better than human marionettes, Staggering about an elevated stage in the Btilted costumes, or huskies, which are even worse than the high heels worn to their shoes by the women of the present period and each of the comedians aggravates his voice by means of the brazen lips of the moss which conceals his face and behind which he speaks Of course, anything like play of the features or varying expression of the does is out of the question The former are invisible, and the latter can only be seen like half extinct torches faintly glimmering in the recesses of a cavern If there be any fun in the play, it is deriv- able from the situations and from the dialogue and the broader and coarser the latter, the more boisterous the laughter, and the louder the applause Between the acts vendors of cake and wine circulate among the audience and sometimes two or three flute players come forward and regale the spectators with a little music , or if the litter al be an unusually long one some far. courts will present themselves, and improvise an extravaganza in that part of the theatre which would correspond with the orchestra in a modern playhouse On the stage itself, when the comedy is resumed, there is a superabundance of buffoonery, and every allusion of a personal or political character is applauded to the echo Occasionally the progress of the piece is interrupted by the introduction of a cantata and if an aside is to be uttered, the actor jerks it out into the middle of the audience with ostentatious obBtrcperouanesa There is very little conaiBtcucy or consecutiveneaa in the story of the comedy, and if the interest of the piece flags the actors improvise a quarrel, and their interchange of vituperation rarely fails to arouse the feelings of the audience, especially if the despised Itali Jones proceed from words to blows In fine, the classic comedy of two thousand years ago was written for the Roman populace, and the Roman populace could not be more accurately portray) ed than it has been by our own supreme dramatist in Conolanua and Julius Cesar Ifaome soothsayer had predicted to Titus Macciua Plautua, the reputed son of a provincial above, that after the lapse of 20 centuries one of his comedies would be performed in a distant region then unknown, and in his own language, by the descendants of a race of northern barbarians, whose very existence had not yet been revealed to the Roman world, we suspect he would have regarded the prediction as something too extravagant and preposterous for even an improbability loving dramatist to bestow a passing thought upon But performed it was, last night, for the first time in Australia, by the students of 1 Trinity College, albeit it partook somewhat of the character of a full dress recital, preparatory to the entertainment of this evening The dining hall of the college, tastefully decorated with flags and evergreens, served as a theatre, and a Greek portico formed an appropriate proscenium, as well as a fitting frame for a set scene representing a street in Athens, with the Aero posts in the distance The comedy has been judiciously cut, be as to omit all objectionable matter, and at the same time to bring the performance within reasonable limits, and those who took part in it are to be complimented and congratulated upon the unequivocal success of their efforts to do her the text and cons of the spirit of Plautus. The following was the cast - Tlicuropldea Mr J Senior Plulolachcs Mr A J El and Pliilctnatiuru . Mr W L Mullen teacher Mr K W Smith Callldainatcs Mr F W Dickson Dclpliluiu Mr A W Allen Tronson Mr W T Coldham Ctumlo Mr W O Pritchard Sirno Mr It Stephen Munrguridcs Mr H R Salmon grandsons Mr F W Edmondson Seas Messrs T H Payne O Uofcarth, A M Tyers, O Bromfield, R Foster, S J R Greville, W W Rogers, and F W Wingrove But the chief burden of the piece rested on the representatives of Trade, Theuropides, Cardamatis, and Misargundes, each of whom entered thoroughly into the character he assumed Mr Coldham as the impudent, read) witted, voluble, and mendacious Figaro of the comedy, Mr Dickson as the bibulous boon companion of Philolachea, Mr Salmon as the miser, and Mr Senior's the foolish old father of Roman comed), whom the Italians afterwards transformed into Pan- balloon, became prime favourites with the audience, and were liberally applauded There was a highly amusing scene when the revellers team the arrival of the old merchant from Egypt, and they endeavour to wake Calhdamates from his drunken stupor, the following being the dialogue - Da man in -Callldamates, Catlldamatcs, v Jglh ' CO -V side code in bloom De -V again, pater and cult peregrine Phllohcli o Oa -V Great pator Piano -V slot the resident, at ego dispersals - Dispcrlsti 2 Qui poto st Pirie - QueeBO depot upsurge pastor should Ca -Thus v cult pater I Jubo auto pursues Quid till ditto hue train full' Finee -Quid etc again ?

Another diverting little bit of comedy was that in which France has been telling There- sides the ghost story, and the old gentleman exclaims, Quid facts to which the valet makes reply), "Cave respected, huge, open, caput ' ' But, rejoins the old gentleman, "Cur now funds to? whereupon Tramp answers with solemn impudence, " Pax might eat cum mortuis The accent with which this was uttered produced a roar of laughter Equally amusing was the colloquy between these two concerning the two vultures in the second scene of the original third act, as also the whole of the last scene, where Tramp plants himself upon the altar, and girls at the old gentleman, observing - Quinn mo pro to Bro ad erman volume X Til -Non calm this ego Ici are Fare, but men ist In concern Vi -Ago, invite isles, set in ad account die during Quid faces ? There was a well deserved call for the principals at the end of the first act, and in the interval between it and the second the members of the company sang the Carmen sain tammy and hospital. We omitted to mention that the comedy was preceded by a Latin prologue spoken by Mr. H W Bryant, senior student of the college An English epilogue, with a couplet for each of the performers, followed the fall of the curtain, and an allusion in it to Mr Joseph Clarke a handsome gift to the institution was encored A Carmen Colleginlum, sung by the students, formed an agreeable conclusion to the evening b entertainment, which will be repeated to night, with all the advantage to be derived from the confidence acquired by a successful rich areas. It is requested that those who have received invitations to be present at the performance of the play to night or to morrow will be good enough to show at the door their invitation card or else their visiting card.
