DOG-GREL. WE'VE a story to tell, and we shall, And it's all about " Goodfellow Hal," Who had a bulldog That could worry and slog Each little boy-dog and dog-gal. Now this excellent fellow called " Hal," Considered his bulldog his pal; And he loved him intense, And the dog had the sense To pretend that he idolized Hal. Well, there was a young fellow named ''Fred," A wicked young fellow, who said, " I'll give that dashed dog Some poison in prog, For 111 never feel right till he's dead." Now, though you may think it's absurd, This Fred was as good as his word; For he poisoned this dog As stiff as a log ; So the death of this bulldog oc-cw-red. Then Frederick exclaimed, " What a lark 1" But the cause of the death he kept dark; But Hal wept and said, " Do you think, my friend Fred, He'd revive if we gave him some bark ?" Well, that night, when this dog- killing Fred Lay asleep very snug in his bed, He was 'waked by a row, Or a ghostly "Bow-wow," And he saw the bulldog that was dead. Or, that is to say, saw the ghost Of the savage bulldog he had dosed ; And he howled at poor Fred, Till he shook in the bed, Then fell back just as stiff as a post. Then the ghost of the dog made a bound, And came down on poor Fred with a sound That was frightfully sad; And he tore him like mad, And he tossed him around and around. And there he kept tugging at Fred Till the midnight departed and fled; And the big rooster crew, Then the dog-spectre flew ; But his victim was very near dead. Well, ever since then, this pocr lad Sits or wanders alone very sad ; And he does nothing now But mutter, "Bow-wow," And write dog-grel that drives people mad. But there's more to be said of this caseâ€” Be has bitten the whole poet-race; That's the wherefore and why That the Muses are shy, And dog- grel is thriving apace.
