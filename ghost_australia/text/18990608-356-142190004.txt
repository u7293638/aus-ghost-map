MIR. GRFIIFITII AND THE BILL. Sitr.-From Mr. orimllul's speech at the Wiickhamn Schlol of Arts on 'Puesday night lhe appears to have a repugnlance to see the bill carried whereby he would be called upon to pay taxes to kIteep up Federal Judges. &c.;, some at great salaries, and also a hang ma. He mentioned the hangman no less than sli times during Ills discourse. This, to my mind, showed that. it was theo. pre dominant thought, or, ia other words; ?oal eat got at in his minud. Well, if It is only the cost of that func tionary that hle objects to I thiuk if he will read again clause 110 in the bill hle will see that there will be absolutely no extra cost on that account, as each State has to pro vide gaol iecommodation, tand for the car rying, out of punishments of offenders against thie laws of the Commonwltwealth. But the ghost he is nio doubt most concernedl about is the electoral executionr, and fromn his manner of dealing with the bill mathe matically speaking as hle terilued it, reduc lng everythlig to an absurdity, "Figures versus faict," I thinkt if lie Is given rope oenouglh hlie will not require "Nosey l]ob" for he will do i lthliselt politically. LiLke begets like, and ialluclnation may be thoecause.of all the ghastly plredictions rwhichl he said would follow iin the wake of the acceptncaaee'of the bill. \\\'ell, Wiclkham has had a lot to do with the gas question (coal gas I mean), and they have Iand to pass muiny. dark coracrs without ever find Ing a ghost. That now we have increased the light by fifty per cent. we will not be frightened by Mr. Grlfllth's scarecrows.-I am, &c.;,, ANTI-TOXIN.
