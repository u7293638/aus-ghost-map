A Somnambulist's Story. The following story was told iu a recent number of Caeeell'a Saturday Journal by a sleep wnlker:-One night I left the house, asleep of course, without disturbing anyone, and made my way to a summer-house, a place I visited so often in my sleep that it was always the first to be searched whenever I was missed. It appeared that at the time I reached the doorway of the summer- house, from which I could easily overlook the road on which the garden abutted, a terrible tra gedy was about to be enacted. The house nearest ours was occupied by an old maiden and her nephew. On this particular night the nephew had been to a party at some distance, re turning toward home between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning-just at the time I was taking my walk abroad. As he reached the roadway at the end of the garden, he was set upon by two ruffians, and after a severe struggle was overpowered. The rob bers, For such they were, were about to rifle the young man's pockets when I readied the end of the garden. Owing to the white dressing-gown, and the pale, mild light of the moon shining on me, I suppose they be lieved I was a ghost or something equally uncanny, Anyhow, my parents say that when they arrived on the spot- having missed me and at once started in search-the two tnen were hurrying away, casting terror-stricken glances behind them. The young man, although boriously injured, eventually recovered, find now says he owes his life to me. The curious part of the matter is that al though I was, when discovered, lean ing over the wall, apparently looking at the injured man, I had not the slightest recollection o( the affair on awakening.
