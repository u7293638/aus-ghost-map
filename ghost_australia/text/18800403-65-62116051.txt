Davison-who is one of thu pro Mint aspirants to Legislativo honours-ami 1 must say, from what 1 have seen and heard, that it seems anything will do for the poor Clarence.

Tho Clarence has Hollered enough in years gone by, su wo want no more non- entities, who have neither ind√ªment or ability to CoMfitrcftiii, April 1, ISSI).
