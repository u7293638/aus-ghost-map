I OLD WORLD GOSSIP. | (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, July 20. The Budget Bill is at lost through the House of Commons, after a solid two months of the dreariest wrangling of. which Parliamentary annals make any record Parliamentary obstruction has various Shapes It used to be exasperating enough in the pro-rogencrato days of the Irish party, but the monotony of tulle was relieved by flashes of wit and humour, rod by an occasional fierce "row" which brought men's tempers to the boiling point But there has not been a single onliToning feature about the debate on the Budget A handful of prose lawyers and exports elaborating the dullest of details and splitting the thinnest of straws have all this time been going again and again over the same ground with a. dull decorousness and a pretence of solemn courtesy which have been irritat- ing beyond description to the lay mind When the Irishmen and some of the Englishmen took to fighting during the debates on the Home Rule Bill, people talked largely about the Mother of Parliament being brought into contempt But there is a fighting strain in the English- man's nature, and secretly, we were not half as scandalized as we pretended to be but the dreary, trivial verbiage of the last two months has really brought the House of Commons into contempt with the average Briton, who knows well enough that a firm of grocers who did not go to work in a more businesslike way than this would be ruined in a fortnight The result will probably be that we shall have an agitation for a reform of the procedure of the House at any cost It is needless to say that there have been no serious reputations made in the course of this big debate Mr "Tommy" Bowles, the co-proprietor of Vanity Fair), and the proprietor of other society jour- nals, has distinguished himself as a persistent and with it fairly amusing obstructive One or two young gentlemen of the legal profession who have an eye to the law oihcorahips have no doubt commended themselves to their leaders by their industry Mr Balfour has led an well as he could possibly have done in the circumstances, and Mr Chamberlain has been discreetly silent Ono reputation has suffered badly-that of Mr Goschen This was just the kind of discussion to bring, out his whims and prejudices, and his attachment to antiquated if not exploded theories He is not too Tory in these matters for Lord Salisbury, but he is so for the majority of the Tory party in the House of Commons The establishment of a National Trust of Historic Places, which has been decided upon at a very representative gathering this week, will have a great interest for men of English blood and descent far away from our own shores This is a matter, indeed, in which it has been often noticed to our own shame that the people of our colonies-to say nothing of our American cousins are often in the past exhibited a keener concern than stay at home Englishmen themselves Matters have no doubt greatly improved of recent years Local associations li to sprung up all over the country which charge themselves with doing what boy cou m preserving local antiquities and scenes of natural beauty, and I am bound to say that the new county councils have not, as a rule, been remiss in the matter 3 von Scotchmen, who were at one time desperate A minds in regard to their camp relatively few antiquities and their many scenes of nature to [ r ludewr, have of late shown an interest in the presentation of their old castles, and in preventing b dutiful points of view from becoming private property for selfish curmudgeon, who will, if they can, shut out the tourist from enjoying them li our tune to time however one still hears of historic house;, which one could imagine haunted with the ghosts of famous men, being sold its bricks and mort if, or old-world gardens, which have led a 1 fight for conti ri s being cut up into building ground and covered with jerry built villas Only last j i at her 3 dwan! Walkin bought Snowdon as he might have bought a plot of land for a goods siding and although I do not hear that he interferes chiefs with the pleasures of the harmless tourist it seems a scandal that one of the two or three bulls that we have in England and Wales which approach the dignity of mem stains should be in the market in this way The famous falls of Lodore, which form the subject of Sout'iev's sparkling poem, were sold not long ago and there are not a few such features of natural beauty in this country which have been so far vulgar sel that people are charged twopence a head to see them. It is hoped, now that a central trust has been established that a large number of lindow here who own beauty spots of this sort will transfer them to its keeping Our be time attics is w oil as some of our leading statesmen and main great social personages are interesting themselves in the trust, the formation of which is only part of a general movement which is fortunately going on for the

all matters relating to the discipline and privileges of the p of iron and which is cap red men are ill eventually to provide a centre for the corporate life of the Bar in its social is well as profit sion ii aspects " This is not a revolutionary business, but it mari is a very considerable rating of the dry bones of the Conservative traditions by which the profession has been late crto bound The fact is that in the Bar there is, as in all other professions in this country, a spirit of unrest It is by no means the profession it once was For one thing it is absurdly overstocked V. great annual er of men are yearly " called' no doubt, who never make a serious pretence of working for a practice They settle down to live on the r means when they have any, or they take to literature or journalism or, after a year or two of hopelessly lacking their heels in cb members, they go into business perhaps back to the paternal office, or even memorise to the paternal shop counter But of those who stick to the profession, and who wait wearily on year after year for the banks which never come, there are far too many and everyone who knows the purlieus of the T mplo and of Fleet street 1 now show often this idea ess and hope deferred cuds m wreckage Thirty or forty years ago when the air was still a close and select body a man had only to show a musician of bro as to be pretty sure of something which would keep the w off from the door if he could not win fame and fortune, there were, at all events, scores of comfortable little sinecures and " easy jobs," upon one of which he could count pretty well with certainty of coming sooner or later into his possession But these have been steadily decreasing in number, while on the other hand the number of aspirants to them has been steadily increasing Reside, there is no doubt that legal business has not grown in this country in proportion to the population Englishmen have never loved the law, and they show more and more (capacity nowadays for settling their disputes indecently Both barristers and solicitors who also from time to time raise a bitter ory of their own as to professional depres- i√≥n_lmovv this to their cost A few distinguished counsel make great fortunes , a reasonable number of second-class men make good middle class liv bloods but below that there is little to talk about The Bar, too, has lost the social attractions which it once possessed It has suffered a social prestige like the other liberal professions, and for the same reasons Younger professions calling for qualities at least as high have elbow on their way to the front and the mere competition within the Bar itself has deprived it of its dignity as well as of its exclusiveness The father of a promising son will think a good many times nowadays before putting him to the Bar as a means of gaining a living The new council will no doubt do a good deal for the interests of the profession, but the spirit of the times is, I am afraid, in dead opposition to many of its old advantages The christening of the infant son of the Duke and Duchess of York took place on Monday at the White Lodge in Richmond The ceremony was therefore p into private, much to the disgust of a large section of the feminine element of society who had counted upon being present, but who found themselves excluded The late Duke of Clarence was christened at Buckingham Palace, and to go further back, the Prince of "Wales had a grand christening at Windsor Castle, the ceremony in both cases being one of State Something of the same kind was originally resolved upon in the present case, but owing partly to the indisposition of the Queen to undergo the fatigues of a public, ceremony There was only a drawing-room full of guests, constituting little more than a family party The Queen herself handed the child to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was sprinkled, as is usual in those use of Royal christenings, with water brought from the River Jordan The path cut in water used was obtained by the Duke of York himself during his visit to Palestine a couple of years ago It cannot be said that the baby has been ill- provided with names In addition to his grandfather's first two names in inverted order, he has been given the names of the four patron saints of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales George, Andrew, Patrick], David and also the name Christian, which was one of the names of the Iron Duke of Clarence The name Albert is almost indispensable in the case of any descendant of the Queen. It is generally understood that when the time comes the Prince of Wales will succeed to the throne not as Albert but as Edward VII and the young Edward Albert may therefore look forward in good time to becoming Edward VIII As to his personal appearance, the ladies who have seen him are, of course, in ecstacies He seems really to be a comely, healthy child, blue-eyed, and, as mothers say, " good " in his ways, though at present rudimentary in his notions of royal urbanity and dignity The head master of Harrow confessed a day or two ago to having been very cavalierly treated when he went to do homage The time of year has arrived when what may he called the interchange of visits between town cousins and country cousins has fairly set in Too country cousin is ov anywhere now You see him lounging in the parks of an evening, looking at the fountains and listening to the hand He helps to keep the theatres going by patiently doing his round and stewing in upper circle or pit on sultry nights, which make the Londoner wish himself any where except within sight of the dome of St Paul's He turns up in evening dress, a little behindhand in fashion perhaps, at the opera, or who mingles in large numbers with the crowd at Olympia, or in the joint of the Empire or the Alhambra, trying to look as if dis- situations of this kind were the ordinary way of passing the evening in the quiet country town or remote village that he hails from in the streets you see him staring at the public buildings or gazing into the shop windows, or waiting to v, ordered at some turbulent street crossing, which to his unpractised eyes appears impassable The times are, of course, past when he used to turn up as we see him in some of the old J uneh drawings, with brass buttoned coat and flowered waistcoat, and high timbrell He is dressed quite up to modern requirements, only some indefinite cut proclaims that he is not of the town.
