THE BOGIE MAN. (With compliments to the Rev. H. T. Burgess.) Hush, hush, hush, Here comes the Bogie man To throw the dust in people's eyes It is his little plan. To keep up his collections, he'd Put theatres 'neath a ban, Immoral ghosts does he invoke, This sinless Bogie man. â€¢ Hush, hush, hush, Here comes the Bogie man. He goes to picnics with his flock, And sings hymns in the van. Alas ! there's something worse goes oil Than flirting with a fan, . And nameless imps are hot baptised By sinless Bogie man. Hush, hush, hush, Here comes the Bogie man. He preaches twice on Sundays that Life is not worth a span. Yet none so keen as he to make Whatever cash he can y He grafts for greed the livelong week, This sinless Bogie man. Hush, hush, hush, Here comes the Bogie man, He's never to a Theatre been, Since with the saints he ran, If Wybert Reeve will but produce A dance (Anglaise) " Can-can," We'll purchase every seat there is And take the Bogie man.
