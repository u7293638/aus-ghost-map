*o She bditob. Sir— Refening to your local in respect to the appointment of a new Registrar- Ueneral of Deeds, I would call the attention of all thcee who are interested in the welfare of thia aot to the statement mat it is proposed to appoint the present solicitor, Mr. V. F. Turner, to that office in conjunction with bia present duties. In mentioning that gentle man's name it ia understood that no osc could object to him personally bnt cd ?. principle, for it is abousbiag the lasJ lay element in connection with working the Act. I would point out that under parts 3 and 4. of tbe Act It evidently provides for tbo two offices, viz, that of the Registrar-General and Solicitor to be separate officers. II tbe question of economy arises why not promote Mr. W. B. Carter, the present Deputy Registrar, whose long and meritorious ser vices decerve recognition, and who baa (be entire confidence of the profession ? I am. Sir. &c.;» TOKRENS'S GHOST.
