MANURE DEPOT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,-In your issue of this morning appears a letter from a correspondent who, to avoid passing the suffocating stench at the Royal park bridge, took a journey of a mile and a half to get to his home, when he might have reached it in three minutes had he been able to endure appalling exhalations from the manure depot drain. In his fright he signs himself " Typhus." Why, Sir ? Was he afraid that that malignant disease would intercept him, with all its in fiction virulence ? Did the horror of abhorred over. stare him in the face? Was the fell ghoSt of comparative neglect stalking in the way, threatening separation between him and his home ? If terror and alarm took hold upon him, need we wonder, since in the homes nearest the depot typhoid has had three victims during the past month, who, though not reckoned in the tables of mortality, are yet evidences of what we may expect should the Government defer withdraw- ing the site from the power that holds it, to the detriment of the whole city, and ruin of the immediate neighbourhood ? I would urge prompt action; so foul a plague-spot should not exist a day longer, even though it be to perfect some pet scheme or organise a model plan for its distribution. Let the land be withdrawn, and private enterprise will soon find means to place the manure on the hungry land around the district, where it may be inoffensive, yet productive. Trusting you will continue to give your valuable aid in endeavouring to remove the depot, and avert the evil that may otherwise fall upon our homes. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant.
