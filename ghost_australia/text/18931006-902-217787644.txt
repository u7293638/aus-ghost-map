Whistling In the Fast. Many of us can remember the days when whistling men and boys were almost as common as whistling birds, when the streets and work shops would resound with the shrill music of the merry whistler, but nowadays the practice seems to be dying out. One ib seldom tempted to offer a boy a piece of string to tie up biB whistle, for tbe simple reason that the opportunities for , bucIi joking are comparatively few. According to the old writers, people used to whistle for want ot thought, and in the dark to keep up their courage, and scare the ghosts away . It is a question, however, if persons are any more thoughtful to-day than they, were a century or bo ago, and we must look'l'o other causeB for tbe reason why whistling is going out of fashion. Boys of the present generation make no attempt to cultivate the art because of their mouths being too much occupied by the everlasting cigarette or pipe, while the practice of chewing) so general among artisans at their wmk, and the presence of the pipe between their lips aB they go to aud fro, prevent them enjoying tbe less harmless indulgence of whistling, as a few yearB ago. The most that many can now per form in the way of whistling is a long drawn out wail when an unusually surprising piece of information iB told them. -To whistle as an art may eventually become the prerogative of women. Even now many are proficient perfor- mere, and can whietle for a dog or wliiBtle for a living.
