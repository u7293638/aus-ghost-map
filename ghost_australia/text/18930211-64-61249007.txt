E. Patrick, P. A. Leighton, and D. B. Bisl>ee of the Iowa sta- tion (B IR) - Sweet cream fretd*. from the separator, waa thoroughly mixed and then accurately divided into two equal parts by weight ; one of these parts was churned im- mediately at 52- P., the other was ripened at 80- and then churned at 50-. The buttermilk was tested for fat, and the butter was ana- lyzed. In the nine tests, the yield of butter from sour cream was three per cent, more casein. The losses of fat in churning, wash- ing and working were less with sour than with sweet cream. In nine trials the average difference was nearly one haif pound per hundred pounds of butter made. After he ingkept five months the sweet cream butter acquired somewhat of the flavor mid aroma of ripened cream butter, and was in better condition. . . -,. THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES AGAIN.-At the recent Dairy Conference in. England some curious data were produced to show that we have not advanced very much in the science of dairying during the last . hundred-years. Arthur Young, Mr. Chaplain's predecessor of 100 years ago, was .quoted to show that even in 1703 some, cows were yielding as high as '251 bs. of butter, . per ; week. . The same authority explained scientifically the advan- tage of keeping a few Jerseys in an Ayrshire or Shorthorn herd-namely, that the larger fat globules of the rich milk of the Jerseys »issist the smaller globules in the Ayrshire or Shorthorn milk to rise,.and yet this has been claimed as a result of modern dairy science. TREATMENT. OE- MILCH COWS.-Both the cow and her udder ought to be kept in per- fect condition bydully attention. The utmost care is necessary to keep the teats in good sound condition. Many a good young cow has been turned into a kicker by milking her when her teats were sore. Wo cannot expect that a. cow will stand quietly while she is being hurt in the process of milking. A very good remedy for sore teats is to wash with castiie soap-or any pure soap-and warm water, and then apply equal'parts of lime water .and linseed oil. Always, make.a cow comfortable, and she will repay for the little extra trouble. ; ,.. . , , , . .... RELATIVE'VALaEsbi?'CORN AND BUTTER.
