THE STORY OF A GBEAT PICTURE. . In bis first genre pictures, Ilossotuer followed the traditions which were in force in Ida youth in the tfrepch schools of painting. First bits of detail, carefully studied from nature or from tbe living model, in erayon ; then, still in crayon, and after tbe living model, the whole compoMtion. This composition be reproduced without variation in bis picture, tbe most minute eBoets of light being indicated in the drawing. It was not >ODg, however, before ha became convinced that this system led to monotony of colour, and without deflecting from tbe principle of doing nothing esoept from nature, which ba bad made bis rule from the beginning, be re placed tiie crayon study by (he paiuled study. At. the ahme time, in order to leavo aatbing to fibance, he started the practice, whenever he began a picture, of arranging tbe scenery ba waa to reproduce in » corner of his studio. This dune, he pieced the model among the scenery, as if in a tableau-rivant. His Attention to Details. ' He never began work until he bad carefully studied the place to be occupied by each bibelot, tfce effect that the hanging would produce, the vrav in which the light fell on the projection* of a comics, on -bo mouldings of a piece of furniture or a seat, on Jfcfce most trifling and bumble accessories. Ihe tapestry which saemeU^to suit for.^s» kvcfc£r°unti, or the armchair' Jfecipal figure wa* to sit were properties he bought ti Ji the required object were not to be foui jhad it made. He would even order, to them better on his canvases, chimney-piecX and staircases, which he afterwards sold for an old song. When the elements of tbe picture were collected Heis«onier planned out the main lines of it in his miuu. Then, without making any preliminary sketch of the whole, he set to work on studies of detail, which were generallr studies of costume. He turned out-dozens of. them until the costume of each of the figures, had taken its form. Work on the head, th» details of the face, be reserved until the time when the picture having beeu begun, and the actors in the drams being in their places, he had only to give tbe final touches. But though he worked with great facility and his touches followed each other rapidly and 'were wonderfully sure he could not pioducw quickly. At the most he would finish a leg in a day of steady work. This slowness of execu- : tion, however, did not prevent Meissonier's inexorably destroying the work of several days ir he were not thoroughly satisfied with it. His j desire for perfection rendered him inexorable to everything that did not fully realise his idea. , The Great Picture. * To understand the precautions taken iby the {painter to obtain absolutely truthful effects in' Ibis great works, nothing can be morednstrucitive than the history of "1814," one ofthe most ipopulsr of his pictures. It is thus/told by bis i son:— " The execution of the picture, 'though mediated and composed for months intmy father's 'brain, was long delayed for want ofbnow. Th® winter of 1863 was already far advanced and jnot a flake of snow had fallen. At'daat it came. -When it lay thick enough in otsr garden my father at once took his measures^had it trampled by the servants and soiled with barrowfula of earth. It soon became as smuddy, dirty, and sad as one could with. ''Then and than •nly my father began to' work, out of doom* Jposed his horses, in spite'of the'low tempeia- 'tura, in tbe snow, and, with - prodigious activity, pushed on his studies/of detail in order to have them complete beEbre tbe thaw came. Fortunately the hard wesftber lasted as long aa was necessary, sometimes cold, sometimes snowy, but always withithe same < sad, black 'sky, laden with opaquefclouds—the ukyjneceeaaiy to obtain tbe deaj*eb effect, t "After tbe generals -of the escort-came the iturn of Napoleon.
