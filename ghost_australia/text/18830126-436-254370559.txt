RUTHERGLEN. WEDNESDAY, January 24. •Henry St. John M'Naughton was charged at the police court on Monday last with obtaining money irom G orge Simpson, at the Terminus Hotel, by means of a valueless cheque. Mr. Reeve, J.P., adjourned the case to the 9th February, to allow of the attendance of a police magistrate. Mrs. Camm, who lately received a handsome present irom the Wesley an body for services rendered, on her leaviug for Colac, has had to return to Rutherglen to act in her old position as assistant teacher in the State-school. It appears that Mr. Camm, head teacher at Rutherglen, lately received an appointment at Colac, and he and his wife left Rutherglen with the good wishes of all. Oo arriving at Colac they found that the school was not up to the standard for an assistant, and Mrs. Camm has been advised by a liberal Government that she must either go to Rutherglen or resign ; hence the return. To-day it is rumored that the Ruthergli " ghost" is a myth or phantasy raised by the vineyard proprietors to prevent the rising generation Irom stealing their grapes in the night-time. This is the most sensible solution of the mystery. The benefit concert to Mr. Thomas Sampson realised about £20. A most original pun was given by the ring at the concert namely— " Why is the Rutherglen Shire Council like rabbit warren ? Because it is full of Burrowes. Mr. Le Gould, the new shire secretary and engineer, arrived in Rutherglen on Monday, and has fairly taken charge of his combined office. Before leaving Harrow, Mr. Le Gould was entertained at a banquet and presented with a handsome testimonial and a purse ol of sovereigns. Mr. W. E. Adcock will deliver a comic lecture on Friday night in the town-hall, entitled " Man, Woman, and Child." The proceeds are in aid of the sufferers by the Creswick disaster.
