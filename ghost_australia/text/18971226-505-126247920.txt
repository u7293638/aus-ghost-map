CITY AND COUNTRY GIRLS. Dear ' Vivienne,' — Regarding ' Gold Dust's ' letter on the above subject, I thought ifc waB a question of who made the best wives, and nofc one of physical develop ment. ' Gold Dust' must; be a fool to lefc all the country know his wife's measure lueuts. jduu x cau uiauro jiiui uutnt) urs ua well-built and as hard-working women in the city as evor were known in the country. I think a woman has quite enough to do to look after her home without doing outside slavery, such as cow-walloping and pig driving, as ' Gold Dust ' says his wife can do. She must have a hard life of ifc. I have travelled a great deal in the country, and I saw jusfc as many pale-faced, dying, churchyard ghosts there as in the city. Everywhere I went they would tell me more about Sydney than I knew myself. I heard two country girls say the' other day that they had come to Sydney to look for a husband, but he must be good-looking, and either a railway portor or iu tlie Post-office. Well, I wish them luck, poor girls; they could not find a man good enough iu the country. I am vory sorry there are not more young ladies like 'Another Hard to Please'; if there were there might bo better wives and happier homes, and I am glad there is one young lady in N.S.W. who tliiuks I am not hard to please. — I am, &c.;, A Working Young Man.
