THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH. In the best men there is a tendency to do certain things they ought not, but the more they are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more it is true of them that they are kept UU1U UUXlIf^ WJUCLU UDUOJLW1DQ UL1^J WUUlUt When I was a boy I used to go to the Poly technic in London, where my favourite diversion was a diving bell, which had seats around the rim, and which at a given time was filled with people and lowered into a tank. We used to go down deeper and deeper into the water, but not a drop ever came into that diving bell, though it had no bottom and the water was quite within reach, because the bell was so full of air that, though the water lusted against the water, the air lusted against the water, because air was being pumped in all the while from the top, and the water could not do what it otherwise would. If you are full of the Holy Ghost, the fresh life is underneath you, and though it would surge up, it is kept out. â€” F. B. Meyer. ' I know not where His islands lift ?Their fronded palms in air ; I only know I cannot drift Beyond His love and care.'
