POWEB TO TESTIFY. What we want is a baptism of fire, not of ice ; there are weak spots in Christian life, and behind these we want the power. Most Christians are weak in the family circle ; let us get power to testify of Christ before the children, the servants, the household. Power is needed to testify for Christ in the workshop, before our fellow - workmen ; power in our community, power before the church. How changed would be our class meetings, our social services, our prayer meetings — yea, let us also say our pulpits — if the true power of testifying for Christ were given us 1 ' Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.' ' 0 that it now from heaven might fall, And all our sins consume ! ? Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call ; Spirit of burning, come !'
