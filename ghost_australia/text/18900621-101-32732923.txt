"We'll soon see," said Ned, leading the. way along the short passage, turning thiel key. which stood in the iock,:imd reveal-^ ing a Hight of about a dbzen steps, terminating on a level wit h thé court. , We .descended, And found the bäckwajl a dead mass of grey stone, excepting iho( one window which lighted my laboratory. At the foot of the chair, still inshle( the passage, there was,a blank piece'of wall ¿moojkhly plastered over. We .were passing tills on returning . from ' our inspection; when Ned struck it firmly'with1 his knuckles. . - , 1 .'Stop," said he, and struek it-again ; once or twice. " firing a hammer, An ty."

This also I tifas able to supply, and with the'hammer and chisel Ned, who was now: the leading spirit, soon laid bare a narrow; door, - lovel with the stone lintels, ap- parently heavy, and securely locked. : -, How to open it was now the question.'

A torch was improvised from a bunch of wax tapers and we all three went in. There was a narrow passage leading to the left towards the front of the house, and ending in a square recess, which the flaring torch lighted tip fitfully, áud this is what we saw.';' , On a little round table a crystal bowl,' almost full of a clear liquid, ht.wliich floated what seemed a small magnet, ene, of its .poles touching a mefalEc, wire,' which ascended aud disappeared Jn jtho ceiling, just below where stood myaßtjidv chair ; aud besido the bowla small ohpny box and on the top of the boxa ring, from, a large jewel in which *he torchlight scin- tillated. - -..'J I had just lifted the hos and ring,' when Nod, exclaiming, "There is some devilry here!" dashed the howl from the tablë. With the.sourid of breaking glass .there came a sensible shock, d commotion in ' the hair, and total darkness. Our light had been extinguished. We hur- riedly made our way to the door and up to my room, where we stood a few mo- ments gazing in each-other's faces, fl" What does it all mean ?" It was Ned who «poke first. The doctor said nothing. I now recollected and mentioned what the landlord had told me abont the "queerness" of the original owner and some time occupier of the premises, and his peculiar provisions regarding the desk knd chair. " ïou must get ont of this," said Ned. "There is not tho smallest reason now," said Dr. Brown. "If I am "not much mistaken, the spell is broTcea. But yod hate something in your hand. P" he said to me. ,', . "These were on the table/' I said, chowing tho box and ring. ? .-The ring was massive gold, ornament- ed on one side with tho figure . of > an eagle, wings spread, and a large opal in its« breasts . ??. ? - Tho box was of ebony, the lid and sides covered with'grotesque carvings in . re- lief.

She then ; turned ber eyes inquiringly on roe-- the tame blue, melting eyes, and almost the same wondering appealing look. . I took out the box and. the ring, s aud laid them on the table preparatory to the telling of my story. I did not know how' to begin. " My mother's ring !" uhe soddenly ex- claimed, ' eagerly lifting and examining the one 1 had laid down. " Or "-- And she hastily .opened a drawer in the cabinet, 'brought but and laid ' beside my "ring another, identical in appearance-" my father's!" " Who was your father ?" " First tell me how you became posses- sed of this ring." I slowly, and amid many interrupting exclamations and interrogations, went over the circumstances already related, and finished by laying before her the scribbled note and the paper representatives < of twenty thousand pounds. ' (Would to heaven I bad twenty thousand farthings '! It wocld be the saving of me.) At the close ' she touched a spring in one of the rings-Üer ring-when'{he breast of the eagle opened and displayed the .miniature of a noble-looking man in tho prime of lifo, the oountenauce being altogether tho most impressive I hud ever seen ; and performing thc same opera tiou with my ring, she'shooed it to certain the portrait of a beautiful woman, young, and strikingly like herself. "These," she said, " are my father and my mother as they were in jiappy days that I cannot remember. Often pare I heard my mother say that they had rings precisely alike, containing their portaaits, as you see, and that my father considered them a. unique parr/', , . " That is. enougV' I'said ; "you have proved that of which I had no doubt. I recognised in your mother and yourself the rightful owner of the ring and the contents of the bot." '"Noj lm," she said ;.

But "-»nd tears filled her eyes-" I haw just lost my mother ; it can never benefit her." . Í impulsively took ber hand. She gently withdrew it. and said :-r :i. "Now, ia return, let ino toll, you my story, some things in which, if they d<> nut altogether explain, may throw some' light on yours/' i ' ; '.T <5 ' " My father's name was Martin ^feh >warsberg, and my mother's J&oatrice; Allen. I hardly remember my father. My clear idea of him . must have boon derived from his portrait in th'e/rjug, and niy mother's frequent, talk about him. Ho was a Grermau, and was!w this country prosecuting some enquiries in .connection with the studies which en grossed, hiro-rthat of-animal magnetism -when-ho, met my mother.
