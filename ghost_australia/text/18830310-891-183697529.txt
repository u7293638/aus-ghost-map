A. F AMILY . GHOST. By Henhy Geatbok. Old ifadamo Ieffingroll had the niiifn, uno to be born of an old family, and her lii[ f tuno 1 words were: 'If a child of mine marries beneath him T ill come.faaok (o cumA lnm I*.- .... rf will como.back to curse lain! Even in that terrible moment, Esteli. Mji only"dangter of ^tlie crone, conld notrnfmb, from glancing at Oliarlee/thV younger eon could he help blushing. . For it was Charles that madame meant. Ed. ward was married, and tho father of a family and Estclla could not be spoken of as 'him.' Nothing now remained in the old homo to tell of Madame Leflihgwell's reign there but her portrait—a stately full length, not unlike a'handsome Q,u-cn Elizabeth, in its bluckvefr.t robes and diamonds, the ottect heightened by the ruffs, which mother and daughter both affected, though fashion forbade them to hare ■ the Elizabethan hoight. One bright day it pleased Mrs/Edward Le{. fingwellto visit her sister-in-law, and to bring: her two children and their governess with her. . ' You have so'much room, and arc so .hospit able, Stella,' she said; ' that I shall make no excuses whatever. Miss . Mellon can sleep wlierevor the children do ; and we all want a week of country air so much.' ■> <• Mi»s Estclla was obliged to smile and utter . • words of welcome, but'she could have'stabbed, dark eycd Mies Mellon, with the hand she held ', out to her.' * •.. • ■ • "?■ - ;l. j '•■i its for the governess, her blood wosboilingat the thought that alio" had come to tho house of-, one who: had behaved; a's Charles IiefBngweU had : done—whohad- won her heirt arid theti forgotten her.:. l . Miss Mellon's coldness,-and his mother's last . j words, his wisli to be dutiful, and his desire to bo'liappy, ail drove poor Charles to distraction's ] verge; and ono "day his self-restraint came to an end with the sight of Miss Mellon in a pen-. eive mood, quite alone in the library, setting copies for her young charges. - : ill the little governess knew of. the matter was that there was a moment when she felt as though she should faint; that when it passed he was on his knees at her feet; that his arm was about her waist, and ho was tolling her all; that she longed to hear. He loved her; he ' adored her ; lie should kill himself if she re- 1 fused to be his wife, for he could not live with- •; I out her. And when they parted she wore his ring upon her finger. •' .' My dear Estella,' said young Mrs. LeIBhg. well, a fow days after,' there is somethinggoiag ' od that you really ought to know. Charles and Hosa Mellon are engaged.' ••• ,'Have.you lost your senses? or have!? oris it Charles who lias gone mad ?' asked M'ss Es- : tella, in awful tones. ' '■ >' Charies is quite right in his mind,' said .the s young matron. 'Boea Mellon is as good as she ' is 'pretty! A great deal prettier than IamjEs- a tella. and-you did not wonder that Edward : | chose me.' .' You were a Do Courcy,'.- said Miss! leBng-h j well. ' i' That bad nothing to do'with it, Stella,' said Mrs.Xeffingwell; ' nothing.'. - 'i ..-o'i ;' And Bosa Mcllon's mother takes in washing - doesn't she?' aske I Estella, languidly.:' ■: !'Washing? You ought to be aehsmed of: yourself! Poor Mrs. Mellon, when left i widow, restored fine old lace elegantly.'. v 1 ■ ■' fcho must hare washed it,' sneered -Estella •'Well/ said Mrs. LefHngwell, 'she want lady, at all events; and Bosa had a perfect education; and Charles is right. Jiow don't be unpleasant.' ' I shall not say a word,' said Miss Patella; ' bub how can Chirlot forget his mother'i dying words ?' ' But perhaps your mother might not thiol that Charles married beneath him if he marriei' Bosa Mellon,' said 3Iri. LefKngwell. ' I am sure mamma alluded to Bosa,' replied' the spinster. ' ' But as Estella said rothing severe, the younj people were happy. When Bosa went away, her future sister-in law even kissed her, and Charles was grateful He also bad come to the conclusion that Mrs. LefTingwell could not have thought Best beneath him, and the comfort of the though* was very great. Ho sat that evening alone in tho room ii which that full-length picture ofhismothc: hung. He had been reading by the light of i student's lamp. There was no other in Hit room. The hours had followed each ether ti their graves until tho twelfth was buried; J dozen silver strokes had been made upon tlx bell of the old clock by the little silver figure d -time, who struck it with his scythe when eacl new hour-was born. • • ■ - ■ Oliarles felt very fond of all tho world jus then—the world that made him so happy. HI M book, a romantic story, such as people are pronr ™ to read at such time, was just finished. -He stil held it between his fingers; but bis hand haf 'dropped over tho arm of the Turkish chair ii which be sa% and his eyes were fixed upon thj portrait of his mother. 1. -,;i ' Bear mother,' he said to himself,' howgoof you were to me!* Stern and cold by nature, yot still lored inc fondly.
