THE HOOP SKAKE. The following question, says a correspondent of the Scientific American, is still being asked: " Is there such a thing as a hoop snake, and has anybody ever seen one, or a specimen of one? The way the hoop snake is said to move about is thus: It takes its tail in its month, coils itself in an ellipse and moves aronnd like a hoop. There are many persons who uphold the existence of the hoop snake, yet all reports and declarations that have been advanced in its favour have all proved to be totally unreliable. The anatomy of a snake alone is sufficient to prove that hoop like progression is impossible. The hoop snake has never been described by any naturalist in any standard work on reptiles, and no museum nor collection in the world contain a specimen of it. It exists only in the minds of the ignorant and unscientific, and it must be classed with ghosts, mermaids, winged snakes, sea serpents, and fishhooked-tailed fishing snakes.
