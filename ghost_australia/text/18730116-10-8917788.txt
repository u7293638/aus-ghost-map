THE MERCURY. I THURSDAY MORNING, JAN. 16, WS. I THE prophets of evil were some time ago jubilant over an apparont decrease in the number of sheep within tho Colony, from some 2,200,000 to a trillo upwards of 1,340,000, between the years 1852 and 1871. Wo at the time ßhowed that tho decrease was not real, but the result of errols in making up tho statistics of the first named year, the exports of wool and other cor- roborative ciicumstances having left no doubt that there never were so many as 2,200,000 sheep in tho Colony in any ono year. We have now, instead of the negativo proof that as a Colony we aro not falling oil' to the extent asserted, the more agreeable duty of showing that our pastoral interests have very consider- ably improved. Wo have had no great exten- sion to our flocks, nor has there been introduced any increased capital receiving, as demanding, increased returns on tho outlay. Our improve- ment is solely the result of that legislatively enforced better management of our flocks that has resulted from tho passing of a Scab Act by the Parliament of the Colony. Wo need not now refer to the very bitter antagonism that was manifested when Mr. WiiYTE,inthedisoharge of his duty as a legislator, saw fit to introduce a measure for lessening an evil which his experi- ence as a Colonist had forced on his observation. Ho was subjected to all sorts of insinuations and misrepresentations, and was credited with any- thing but a senso of public duty in the action ho took ; and when, the statute having been passed, the Government of tho day committed to him the carrying out of the Act, there was no lack of ungeneroiiB charges against him ; and not a few had no hesitation in justifying thoir past opposition to tho Bill on thoir knowledge-and they asked the public to give them credit'for their discrimination-that Mr. WHYTE had been all through seeking a situation for himself. To attribute such mercenary conduct was enough to damp tho spirits of most men ; but Mr. WHYTE, conscious of tho purity of his intentions, and no doubt sensitively alivo to the danger of the Act bocoming n dead letter through the negligent working of it, and to the obloquy that would fall on him should the Act becomo a failure, dared the accusations levolled against him, entered on his work con amore, and has so cautiously, and yot so energetically, worked the Act, that those who were formerly most prone to abuso lum, now candidly admit that tho Act has proved a great boon, and its author a groat benefactor to Tasmania. The application of the Scab Act has enabled the flock owners of the Colony to turn to better account than they could otherwise have done the improvement in the price of wool, and would have better prepared them for a continuance of adverse times had such been their hard fate. We have the satisfaction of reflecting that from the first we approved of forcing the Act on recalcitrant and stubborn sheep owners. We have watched ita operation closely, and while we gladly re- cognise its benefits, and the better tone of feeling among the former opponents of any legislative interference beyond a Dipping Act, we deem it but justice to say that to Mr. WHYTE the success of the Act is mainly to be attributed. If entitled to credit for introducing the measure, his judicious and painstaking labours in carrying it out, demand equal, if not greater praise. Towards the end of last session there waa, on the motion of the Member for Westbury, ordered- to be laid on the table of the Assembly, a Return, the import of which would Bhow the number of clean sheep and their localities, and the numbera subject to the penal clauBea of the Act. Whatever the object of the Return, its result has been to show the beneficial working of the Act. There waa so much detailed information asked for, that to supply it during the session was impossible ; and when supplied much of it will be of no use. But the benefits of the Act will be seen from the follow- ing substance of Mr. WHYTE'S Return : Beturn of Sheep for which clean certificates bave been burned up to 1st December, 1872 ; approximate Return of the number of Sheep for which the owners have applied for «lean certifi- cates ; and a Return of the number of Sheep which It Is supposed are clean, but for which the owners have not yet applied to have them examined for the purpose of getting clean certificates. Under Clean Certificates. Sheep. South Western Sheep District, embracing Hamilton, Bothwell, Oatlands, part of Green Ponds, and part ofNewNorfolk. 271,231 Southern ditto, embracing Brighton, Richmond, ' Spring Bay, Clarence, Sorell, part of Now Norfolk, Glenorchy, Kingborough, and Huon. 20,000 Midland and Eastern ditto, embracing Rou, Campbell Town, Fingal and Glamorgan. 229,916 North Eastern ditto, embracing Selby, Evandale, and George Town. 80,900 North Western ditto, embracing Longford, Westbury, Deloraine, Fort Sorell, and Horton. 80,017 Total under clean certificates up to 31st Dec, 1872. 088,00« Approximate number of Sheep for which the owners have applied to have them examined for clean certificates. 120,000 Estimate of Sheep supposed to be clean but for which tho owners have not applied tor certificates, or for which, strictly, they would not be legally entitled to certificates of cleanness. 100,000 Total number supposed to be clean on 1st Dec, 1872. 908,004 The above gross total has been arrived at from information received by the Chief Inspector of Sheep, and from his own observations aa regards the probable numbers embraced in the last two items. The Return, it will be observed, was to 1st December last. Since that period the first total number, 088,004 has been, we learn, largely increased, and it may now be taken for granted that there are at least 760,000 sheep with clean certificates. Renewed licences for six months from 1st November, have been issued for 70,000 sheep, on paymont of the penalty of one farthing per head, and applications have been made known to the Chief Inspector for between 30,000 and 40,000 more ; and Mr. WHYTE calcu- lates that at the present moment 1,000,000 aheep are clean, and that by 1st May next, when a second renewal of licence cornea into operation, the number of infected aheep will be consider- ably under 100,000 ; probably will not reach more than from 60,000 to 70,000. This simple fact speaks volumes. But let us apply it, and the result becomes apparent, where it ia most felt, in the purse. Forming part of a pamphlet issued by Mr. WHYTE, are estimates by him, and by Mr. ROBERT CLERK, of Malahide, of the annual loss to the Colony, prior to the Scab Act, through the existence of scab, the former esti- mate being £120,749 ; the latter, £145,676. Mr. WHYTE'S estimate of the probable gain from the complete eradication of scab was £153,000. Mr. WHYTE then reckoned the increased yield of wool at 6 ozs. per fleece. When he introduced his Bill in 1869 his calculation waa £ lb. per fleece. Results furnished from various parts of the Colony, and on various classes of sheep, prove that tho increase of wool conse- quent on the operation of the Scab Act, has been fully ¿ lb. per fleece, and of course the value from its improved quality and condition, has increased in a atill greater proportion ; while, since the Act has como into operation, the saving of labour on farms where the aheep have been clean for two years, has been very great. Mr. WHYTE estimated the export of rams and ewes to the neighbouring Colonies, for stud purposes, at £5,000 per annum. We know that for 1872 that sum has been more than doubled. When introducing the Bill in 1869, Mr. WHYTE esti- mated the worth of the increased number and valuo of fat sheep at £5,000. In his pamphlet ho estimated this in 1872 at £10,000, and experience has shown that even this sum has beon exceeded by 50 por cent. In 1869 the sheep and lambs imported into the Colony numbered 24,856 ; in 1870 their numbera fell to 17,515 ; in 1871 to 11,889 ; and last year the numbers imported did not exceed 5,000. The duty may have had something to do with these reductiona, but the operation of the Scab Act had undoubt- edly a much greater effect in enabling Tasmania to be what she ought to be, self-supporting in the supply of butcher's meat. We shall close the evidence in support of the beneficial operation of the Scab Act, by giving the following returns from one establishment extending over five years. They have been furnished to Mr. WHYTE, who estimates jib. per floece of the increased weight shown on these returns, to the operation of the Scab Act. The sheep were cleaned in 1870 and 1871\. The smaller numbers included in the returns for the last two years, are accounted for by the fact, that for the first three years the owners had two farms in the same district, but one of these waa given up in the beginning of 1871\. The Bheep were all of the same breed and description during the whole period of five years. 1808\. Wool. . Per Fleece. Sheep o\ cr 2-tooth.... 10,971 48,3401ba. 21b«. lion.

We have only to add that those returns are from a farm in the South-Western Sheep Diatrict, and ia, we know, but one of many auch in each diatrict. IN our statement of Exporta and Importa for 1872 published in yesterday's Mtrcmtj, as showing the progress and prosperity of the Colony, we find we have fallen into some errors, chiefly from the figure« compiled from the Gazette returns not including the values of certain exports and importa at the various aub-ports to Launceston. Fortunately for the truth of what we desired to impresa on the public, these errors do not require that we should in any way modify our viewa. On the contrary, the favourable condition of affaira shown, waa under, not over, stated. Of course we are not responsible for the Gazette figures, and in all probability when the »nouai returns sie g¡iep, «0019 alterations will have to be made. They will not, however, materially affect the result as we now correct it. We yesterday stated the value of imports at Launceston for 1872 to have been £315,676. To this fella to be added the value at the sub-ports £15,006, together £330,682, making with the imports at Hobart Town, £476,500, a total for 1872 of £807,182, instead of £792,176 as stated. Io the exports our error was still greater. The value of these at the sub- ports to Launceston, also omitted in our comparative statement, was £43,984. In the Launceston returns the exports were over-stated £7,544, by substituting the importa for the exports for one of the months. Deducting that sum from the £43,984, we have a balance of £36,440 to add to the exports of Launceston, making the total value £416,391, instead of £379,951 as stated. Adding to these the exports at Hobart Town, £493,372, we have a total export value for'1872 of £909,763 instead of, as stated yesterday, £873,323. A singular fact ia brought out by these corrections: while there ia increasing prosperity elsewhere, the sub-ports are an exception. The exports there have decreased from £54,454 in 1871 to £43,984 in 1872, and the imports from £16,809 to £15,006. Aa a typographical error waa made in the return of the specie at the banka, we republiah the returns yesterday given, with the neces- sary corrections. IMPORTS. 1870\. 1871. . 1872.

Totals. £048,709 £740,038 £909,703 It will be seen that the value of the imports for 1872 was £14,266 over those of 1870, and £29,095 over those of 1871. Theexports-the beat teat of our increasing trade, being what we grow or manufacture -have reached, in 1872', a value exceeding that of 1871 by £169,125, and over 1870 by £261,054. If we take the Bank autistic«, the result ia equally satisfactory, as will be seen by the following comparative returns taken from the several weekly statements made up during the last quarters of 1871 and 1872 : SPECIE IN BANK. 1871\.

But, at the same time, the character of a whole community may be affected by the conduct of a few ; and very properly so, unless the great body take effective means to mark their reprobation of the misdeeds of the few ; and we cannot diBguiio from ourselves the fact that the people of Launceston and ita neighbourhood are in danger of acquiring a very nnenviable notoriety through the conduct of a portion of those whose namea are on the jury list in that portion of the Colony. To auch an ex- tent has the plainest evidence been treated with contempt, that the reapeotable portion of the com- munity ahould, for the good name of Launceston, disavow all sympathy with what we would fain attribute to stupidity, were it not that there is too much reason to fear that there ia, underlying the traveaty of juFtice which distinguishes the proceed- ings in criminal prosecutions in Launceston, auch a leaning towards criminals as renders a conviction almost a thing eut of the question. Through some unexplained cause the jury list-and the statement ia as applicable to Hobart Town as to Laun- ceston - is aa remarkable for the absence of the namea of those mentally and socially qualified for the dutiea, as for a preponderance of namea of persona whom no sane litigants would volun- tarily choose for the office of arbitrator«. That the calibre of tbe jury ia not what it should be, was made painfully manifest at the late criminal aittings at Launceston. We do not deúre to further allude to the disgraceful miscarriage of justice in connection with the Westbury fight. But we will not be deterred from speaking of it as it deserves, aimply that we may not give offence ; and therefore we repeat that the finding of the jury wasaB outrageous a verdict as ever disgraced the annala of the Colony. But it did not stand out the solitary beacon of the sittings. It was equalled on the following day. We say nothing of the conduct of the jury who oould not agree in Grimihaw'a ease, because he still awaitstrial ; butin another case, a charge of theft, strong circumstantial evidence waa corroborated by the teatimony of awitneaa who swore to having aeen the act committed, and yet there waa a verdict of not guilty. There are atrsnge rumours in connection with these trials. In one case it ia said every reapectable and intelligent juryman was challenged on the part of the prisoners. In another case report has it that on one of the juries retiring, some of the juron said to the others that they did not intend ditcuaiing the question of the prisoner's guilt ; there was no nae in wasting time, as they would borer be parties te a verdict of guilty. Perhaps in these rumoura a little truth ia coloured over by great exaggeration. But, at any rate, tbere ia a very uneasy spirit abroad arising out of the findings of these Launceston juries ; and even ahould extreme meaaurea be necesaary, some atepa rnuat be taken to reaaauro the public mind. It may bo worth inquiring whether a number of persona most eligible for jurymen have not had influence enough to get their names kept off the jury liât ; whether, in ahort, the making up of it, ia in the beat hands ; and whether those entruated with the duty, discharge it faithfully and fearleialy. Good men and true ahould absndon the natural desire to .save, themselves trouble, and only suob should bavo placed in their handa the iaauea of life and death. It is quite evident that if publio confidence ia to bo restored, the whole of the preaent jury Hat should be set aside, and a new one at onco made up. In this the law officera of the Crown should be aaaistnd by all who have the good name of the Colony, and the cauae of justice, at heart. SFECIB IN THE BANKS.-An ¡nexousable but trans- parent blunder waa allowed yesterday to creep into the comparative tablea of specie in the banks, con- verting the surplus for 1872 into a large falling off. The total amount of specie in the banka waa atnted at, for 1871, £173,425 13«. 8d.¡ for 1872, £107,327 7B. lOd. This latter sum, aa would be aeun on adding up the ¡terna, should have been £207,327 7a. lOd. THE WBATIIKU-While the weather here has been of a wintry character, and certainly moat diasppointing to our visitora, it may afford them some consolation to know that had they remained at home they would have fared worse. In Viotoria the weather appoara to have bean wretched, with scarcely a aummer day, but a auperabundanco of wet and cold.- In New South Wales tempests an.d deluges of rain have alternated. 'In New Zealand the reverse baa prevailed, tho beat at Auckland snd Dunedin, the almpat extreme.,north and soutb, has been excessive, and several oaaea of sunstroke have been I,the consequence.

The want DBS been much felt both by those oitizens and visitors, who delight in theatrical representations. It is with pleaaure, therefore, we -hserve, thut, as we intimated some days ago, the Theatre Royal has been leased for a season by Messrs. Allison and. Hewitt, and will be opened with a good average troupe on Monday, the 27th instant, when the emotional drama en- tiled Quite Alone will be produced, and Miss _ Bose Evans, who bas acquired considerable celebrity in the adjoining colonies and Kew Zealand as a talented artiste, will make her first appearance before a Hobart Town audience. Other members of the com- pany are known here, and the combination of talent contained in the company should ensure the repre- sentation of aeveral good dramas, and freely command publio patronage. CAPTAIN LUCAS OP THE B.S. SOUTHERN CROSS.-We learn from the Melbourne papers that a well-merited and graceful compliment haB been paid to Captain Lucas, of the Southern Cross steamship, by the Acclimatisation Society of Viotoris, which presented him, on Friday, with the society's silver medal. The medal was accompanied by the lollowing letter, which explainstne reasons forthoprosentation :-"Zoological and Acclimatisation Society's Office, 8th January, 1873\. Captain Lucas, steamship Southern Cross. Dear Sir,-I beg herewith to hand you the society's silver medal, which was unanimously voted to you by the council at their last meeting for the many services rendered by you to the society at different times in conveying fish and trout ova free of cost. The council are also sensible of the courtesy and kindness of the company owning the vessel you com- mand in thus assisting the society.-I am, dear sir, vours faithfully, ALIIERT A. 0. LE SOUEF, Hon. Sec. Z. and A. S." ' A HORSE MARINE,-" Tell that to the horse marines" is an observation we sometimes make use of to our friends, when they tax our credulity with a yarn of more than common toughness, a horse marine being popularly supposed to be a myth. If, however, a horse marine is anything like a marine on horse- back, wo saw one last evening going through the streets, and certainly we never before saw either a horse ora marine look so uncomfortable. The horse was fairly jaded, and the rider, with his legs in an altogether unorthodox position and his elbows squared until they stuck out like tbe arma of a semaphore, occasionally waved a small white flag as he rode down | the street, as a sort of advance guard to a cab load of sailors who, with banners in their hands and wreaths of flowers round their heads, were seeing life ashore. RASPBERRY PICKING.-A case, in which a woman sued for wages due to ber for picking raspberries, caused a good deal of amusement in the City Police Court yesterday. The plaintiff, a very garrulous old body, poured forth her story in a regular torrent of words, and fairly bothered the Bench Clerk who was taking down her evidence. The next witness also had " the gift of the gab wery gallopin'," as Sam Weller observed, and persisted in looking upon Mr. Tarleton as a sort of father confessor, and in address- ing him sa " yer riverence." ThiB witness left tho box calling out, " come along Ellen Fogarty," and the young woman owning this name made her appear- ance, and gave her evidence very quietly. The next witness was almost a " girl of the period" in appear- ance, although she too bad been employed at rasp- berry pioking. She wore green kid gloves, and waa mode to go through the turee of pulling tbe glove off her right hand before ahe was sworn. This young lady could not sign her name. There was some oross-swoaring, as usual, in this ease, but the balance of ovidence being on the side of the plaintiff she, obtained a judgment in her favour. ESCAPED PRISONERS.– Two girls, named Julia Brown and Ann Jane Tynan, were arrested last evening by Constable Walker in Murray-street, in company with a number of man-of-war's men. The girls escaped from the factory at the Cascades on Friday last, and though the police have been searching for them since, their efforts were unavail- ing till last evening. Brown received a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment in July last for larceny, and Tynan three months in November for being of bad character, and behaving disorderly. Both prisoners, who are very young, showed signs of great depravity. They were accompanied to the police station in a cab by several seamen belonging to the Clio.

MEDALS FOR IRON AT THE MELIIOUUNE EXHIRI TION.-Tasmania has gained two medals for exhibits of iron at the Victorian Exhibition. The first, a silver medal, bas been awarded to the Ilfracombe Iron Company, they having exhibited manufactured iron, viz., a number of pigs and a cast bell. The Tasma- nian Charcoal Iron Company, the first which has yet done any real work, contented themselves with exhibits of the crude ore, for which they have been awarded a bronze medal.-Chronicle. GOOD NEWS TOOM THE HRLLYER DIOOINOS. Mossrs, Peters, Barnard, and Co. purchased forty ounces of gold from the Hellyer gold-field yesterday. It is of the flat, Bcnly description peculiar to that gold-field. Amongst it were three ouncos of nuggets ranging from 14}dwtB. down to 1 dwt, and some of thom as round as shot, but all water-worn and quito smooth. We understand that about seventy ounces more remain in the hands of the diggers, most of whom uro Chinese. They have borno extraordi- nary hardships during the past four months, but tbey seem to bave surmounted their difficulties nt last. For two montbB they wore at work building bark huts, making cradles, sluice boxos, and other gold washing appliances. Thoy were short of provi- sions for some time, and had to work up to their thighs in water. European or colonial diggers would never have porsevered under such a dis- couraging state of things, but the Chinese jogged on with dogged determination, and now thoy aro likely to reap a fair reward. The water haB rocoded so far that they can work at the sides of the bed oftherivor. If tbey could flume the river and get at the dry bed they would find heavier deposits in tho centre than at the sides.-Chronicle. « Mr. COTTERELL.-" Mr. George Coltoroll's many friends will," the Ovens am!Muna!/ Ailveitiiersnyi, " bo glad to hear that his health has boon so fur re- stored that ho has been able again to put in an ap- pearance in publio, and now looks forward to re- commencing professional work if bo can meet with suitable associates." THE BUNYIP.-The following by a correspondent of the Sallara! Star may throw some light on the subject of a recent correspondence in The Mctcury. The correspondent of the Ballarat Star says :-" I am ven' delighted to inform you that the bunyip has been_ seen in Wendouree. At Fry'a mill a few evenings ago two respectable men secreted them- selves and were rewnrded. The sound emitted closely resembles the bleating of a large calf ; or, perhaps, to be exact, between that and the sound of a large drum. Well, after waiting for two hours, sure enough he made his appenrance, and tolled along a distance of ten yard«, sending the wator about in lino style ; body like a largs pig, face of a calf, with a long rnane. He has been seon near Brown's, whera his peculiar call can bo heard any evening after sun- down. As a pioneer 1 cannot tell you the pleasure this discovery has given me. We have no rats, no ghosts, and the spirits aro a failuro hore, but wo have the bunyip ¡ For a week I have known nothing but delights. I have seen the bunyip myself. I wish I had not. Personnl acqnnintanco with him has proved him «delusion. Alas ! this huB been my fate BO often. I heard tho dreadful sound as above-it carno from o bittern-it has a peculiar blowing cry whian has obtained for it the name of Mire-drum, Bull of the Bog, and its name (Bitour, Botur, Botamrus) ; see the book«. Now for the other phenomenon. It is cauaod by tho musk-duck. The male bird is ns large ui a common gooso, with mont peculiar wings, or rather paddles-see description gentiB Biziura-with which he scuttles along, every now and again sending the water high up in the air, certainly over five feet, and making great com- motion. Go up to the Swamp any moderately clear night ; you will certainly hear the bunyip, and with a little patience and imagination you will also see him." PRESERVATION OF FISH.-Largo quantities of valu ablo food muy be Bavod to thii country, if, ¡ñatead of allowing thoir surplus fish to bo carted off to manure contiguous fields, tho inhabitants of our fishing districts will only mnke n montnl note of the follow- ing simple facts, and afterwards turn them to somo little praotical account. Fish may be preserved in a dry state, and porfectly fresh, by means of sugar alone, and evon with a very small qunntity of it. Fresh fish may also be kept in that stato for somo days by the use of sugar, so as to bo as good when boiled as if it W»B only just caught. If driod und kept froe from mouldinoss, thoro seems no limit to its^ preservation ; nnd by somo peoplo it is moro relished when presorvod in this wny than whon saltad. A contemporary points out that tho process is particularly valuable in making what is called kippered salmon ; the fish preserved in this manner being far superior in quality and flavour to thoso whioh aro aalted or smoked. If desired, ns muoh salt may be used as to givo the taste that may bo required ; but this substance does not conduce to thoir preservation whon driod. In the preparation it is merely necessary to open the fish and to apply tho «ugar to the musoular parts, planing the fish in a horizontal position for two or three days, that tho substance may penétrate. After thia it may bo dried, and it ia only further neoessary to wipe and ventilate it occasionally to prevent mouldiness.
