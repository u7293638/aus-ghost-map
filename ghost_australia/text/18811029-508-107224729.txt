The Indian Doctor. George Searrl, better known as the Indian doctor, was eued by his wife at tbe Central Police Court yesterday afternoon for mainten ance. The prosecute—, a delicate-looking woman, deposed that defendant had turned her out of her lodgings a week aeo, and had since refused to support her. _ witness named William Henry, caused some amusement. He said that he had been a patient of the 'doctor,' and called upon Aim last Jmaay in oreer that he might do eomethine for his eyes. The doctor demanded 10s before he would open bis mouth, and the patient paid him. The fee had the desired effect, but when the doctor did open bis mouth it was only to ask for £7 more, for which, sum he said be would cure him. The patient then, according to his own evidence departed without treatment, the doctor instead having treated him to a short story of his domestic infelicity. A verdict for the payment of 10a per week for 12 months was recorded by consent. , The wife was then charged with bavins- usad threatening language, but' the bench failed to agree upon the evidence before them, and the aase was struck out. This oa.se was alao productive of interest in the shape of a peculiar witness. She waB an Austrian lady, and altbongha Roman Catholic did not ear e to be sworn on ?the Bible, preferring rather to bo sworn while lifting her hand with. three fingers extended. A constable asked what she meant by extending1 the fingers, and she replied tkat they represented the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. After a little persuasion she got over her soruples and kissed the Holy Book.
