' To the Editor of the Australian Churchman. ' Dear Sir— It is my full conviction that the Word of God does not teach what Mr. Taylor terms ' the doctrine of sanctification by faith :' but rather '.through sanctification of the Spirit,' &c.; ' This professedly higher life doctrine puts faith entirely out of its place, and practically ignores the Holy Ghost as the ' sanctifier of the elect people of God.' — Yours truly, 'Observer « 21st September, 1876.' ,,
