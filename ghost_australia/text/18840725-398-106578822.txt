Coiifiteor. A moment may come to a man, and save Eternally; A green yew-tree and a little grave, And a memory. Heart throbbing quick, as the swift days sweep Past like a ghost, Long days, sad days, since you fell asleep, Little one lost. Can yoa hear nie, little one, sleeping fast Under the yew ? I have missed yon tinse the Death-Angel past Betwixt us two. Years since, I carried you robed ia white, In sad spring hour, And hid you here from the warm sunlight— Poor little flower ! I may not roll hack the sealing-stone, And see you, 'Joar, But let roe whisper you here alcne— No one can hear. Why did you leave me ? I needed aid, Aid of child-grace, For the evil things would havebsen afraid Of your sweet face. For a whole life's wrong I would make re dress 3?or your loved sake, I have sinned a sin ;—let heart confess, Or heart will break. I kneel by the dead child's grave, and vow A sacred word; And through the silence that falls, I know Mv vow ia heard. Frcre Sauvaae.
