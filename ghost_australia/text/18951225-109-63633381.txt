THE? OLD YEAR AND THE NEW. No nause, no test, no visual line l.tween tke years that cme and go! For some too fast, for some too slow; Tim never atop. to sleep or dine, But on and on with steady flight lie keeps, untired, by day, by night, And boys and girls, ere yet aware, Find threads of silver in the hair. Their love of quiet growing stronger; And haply, by these tokens know What kind friends told thecm long ago, That they are boys and girls no longer. Still on, as silent as a ghost ! Secms but a score of days all told, Or but a month or two at meet, Since our last New Year's song we trolled, And lo ! that New Year now is Old, " Old year, good-bye ! old ear good-bye !' For what it brought, for what it takes, We love it, and for loved one's sakes ; Prize we its hours of happiness, Nor for its sacred sorrows leas. Accept our thanks, Old Year ! for these And for all preclous memories Of love, of grief, of toil, of pain, Whose mi ntry was not in vTn.
