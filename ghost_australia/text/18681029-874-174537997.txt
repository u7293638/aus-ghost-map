YE OLD BACHELOR. (BY OUR UNKNOWN CONTRIBUTOR.) WHATEVER a man of the sons of men May write in reviews of the sex above, He feels in his heart, to the nib of his pen, Sympathy, softness, indelible love. In the deadliest outbursts of critic ire Affectionate care intermingles with fun; Reproofs are but screens for too glowing a fire-- Smoked glasses thro' which we may look at the sun. In the cloudy north, in these recent times, Some crabbed old bachelor—who can doubt?— Has been writing tirades upon girls, their crimes, On their comings in and their goings out. He has called them a number of naughty names; He swears as far as is legal in print; You would fancy the whole social scheme was in flames, But when you observe, there is nothing in't. We can pity that querulous bachelor's state, Fuming at loss of some luckless button, Rubbing his poor old hairless pate, Alone o'er the ghost of a scrag of mutton. Around him what fruitless remorses throng! Perhaps he has gout, poor wretch, as a guest! He listens in thought to a maiden's song; He clasps with his arms a susceptible waist. He vibrates again to a musical laugh; There's the clatter and patter of children s feet; He is day-dreaming, half in a doze, and half Improvising what life would have been if complete. Then his landlady enters, with shrieky voice, To tell him the coffee and tea are done; O heavens, and this is the life of his choice!— "A life unloved and a heart unwon." Unfortunate bachelor! what to him Are the airy conceits we deride and adore? A chignon beneath a pretty hat's brim Is a (yellow) chignon, and 'tis nothing more. Away with him! Thousands of others wait, Like armies embattled, the word to be loose; To fly in this cause at the face of fate, And fight, if it's but with the quill of a goose. A VENERABLE sinner, anxious to cheat "Auld Reekie" of his due, drinks nothing but bi-sulphate of lime, in order to check natural decay.
