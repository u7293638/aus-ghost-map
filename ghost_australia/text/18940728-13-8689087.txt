After order had been restored and the variegated expressions used during the heat of the argument withdrawn and apologised for the President read his usual address, as follows - "Ladies and Gentlemen,-The main object of this society is as I have remarked before, to turn to its full use the inconceivably great force evolved from psychics As you are aware, there are at present myriads of spirit forms going about the world doing nothing, absolutely unemployed, and consequently getting into mischief, Like the Irishman's trout stream, the air is still wid 'em,' and they jostle each other whenever there is an opportunity of swarming up a table leg or manifestations are favourable for the removal of chun articles from upstairs to rooms below To-day no one in his senses doubts that the materialisation of spirits is a fact solid and indisputable Our) people inside lunatic asylums can possibly disbelieve it.

I don't care if it's the headless lad), or the man dragging chains, or the child with a blood-stained face, or even Geordie himself. so long as he is square and above board. What I want is something real and good that I can put into a caravan, take about the country, and exhibit at agricultural shows for a shilling a head. Why, sir, there's thousands to be made with such a show. The six-legged cult is not in it with a spook. If any member of this society has got a spirit none of your luminous and con- densable vapours or half-formed entities on hand, I am willing to take it at the price mentioned, cash on delivery," A gentleman, who declined to give his name and address, as he said, for obvious reasons, declared he knew for a fact that magnetism by hypnotism by suggestion was blasting all the home life in the colony from the kitchen to the nine, including the stair cases and cupboards. The proprietors of this force came round at the dead of night and pumped and pumped and pumped (the speaker here worked an imayi»«)// Emma handle) it through the walls of the houses until they were so full that it came out of the 36) holes.

In fact he UM Queen Anne. And now he would let the members into a great secret (Here the speaker mounted on one of the tables ) It was he who Lind slammed the Sydney doors, dragging the professors and doctors and architects on a trial trip across the Brussels carpet.
