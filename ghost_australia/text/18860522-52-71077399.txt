G. Grace, W. Newham, W. W, Rend, "W. Barnos, W. Bates, W. Plowers, H. Phillips, W. Scobton, A.Shaw, A. Shrewsbury, and G. Ullyett. Grace captained tho team: On the Aus- tralian sido Trnmbio and M'llwraith stood out. The greatest interest was taken in tho contest, und tho attendance was consequently very largo, despite theunpropitions character ot the woather. Heavy ruin hud fallen during thc night, and it continued at intervals during the day. Tho play was several times interrupted hy sbowors. The homo team won the toss und elected to send tho visitors to the wickers, the 3tato of tho ground being in favor of tho bowlers. Jones and Bruce ivero the first to appear, io tho bowling of Grace and Barnos. Bruco only mado 2 when ho was cleaned howled. Ho was fol owed by Scott (the captain), who, however, speedily lost his partner (Jones), who was caught for 8. Tho best stand of tao day was now made, Scott and Giffen remaining together for some time. ' Tho bowling Was, however, first class, both Grace and Barnes being weil on tho spot. Giffen put toüothor 10 befco ho was bowled. Scott met later on with a similar iate when ho had scored 23, tho highest score of the day. Bonnor was petting weil set when ho was run out for IC. Palmer and Evans filled the vacant places, hut wore speedily disposed of, heine caught and bowled respectively. Tho Holding of tho home team was excellent. B nckham was tho only other member bf tho team who-entered double figures, his score being 13, caught. Tho remaining men, Jarvis ana Garrott, wero unable to "make any stand, the latter being splendidly caught for 9. Spoiforth carried his bat out for 4, and the innings closed for 08. Thc smallness of the total is attributable to the'heavy stato of tho wicket, and also to the fino fielding ol the -Englishmen, which,was greatly admired, and to tho bowling of Grace and Burnes. Tho loririer socured four wickets lor 50 runs, tho latter taking three wickets for 20 runs. Tho teams wore enter- tained at luncheon by Lord Sheffield. LONDON, Muv l-l.-Tho match between tho Australians and Lord Sheffield's team was resumed at Shoiheld Park, to-day, in the presence of a very largo number of specta- tors, who displayed great interest m the progress of tho game.

UJyott touk his place, but only scored 5,when ho was bowled. Tho next man Read was given out leg before after ho had mado a similar number. Shrewsbury foilowod, and after scoring 9 he was run but. Scotton played a good innings, and re- tired with 80. Newham failed tosiore, but Barnes modo a good Btatid, and near'iy carried out bis bat. He was, how ovor, caught when ho had put togothor 22. None of the other men added lui gely.to the scoi o, and the innings closed for 105, leaving the Australians iu a minority of 7 only. Tho most successful bowler was Garrett, who took six wickets for 20 runa. Spoiforth was less effective and 50 runs were scored off him for tho lossbf two wickets.

',* Bhickham, \ .Garrott, Bruce, Jarvis,'and Evans, wlib followed in this order, lost their wickets iii';rapid succession, tho bowling of Barnes and : 'Ulyett'bolnR: of h.'first-class 'description., Palmor .retired caught,.after addinn 17 to .tho. score.'.. Spoiforth, ns in the first innings, cari ied out his'bat, and the.last wicket fell for.70; which included 8 sundries^ 'thus leaving thc homo teahi Cl tô wiii. Tho bowling of Barries was quite a 'feature of tho day, seven'of tho Australian wickets falling to him for 30 runs.. Ulyott also disposod of three of his opponents for 10. ' "' '? ' Tho Englishmen began their second'innings by sending in Suotton and Shrewsbury. The former mado seven, when "ho was given out log before wicket, his place,being filled by'Ulyott.
