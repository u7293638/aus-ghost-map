As to the Dutch, the Netherlands Govein nn nt appears, so far, not to have taken ail) practical steps to assert the claim that it is said to have to a pirt of New Guinea We will conclude with some remarks on a subject which, although we touch upon it last, is bj no means the least im- portant of those dealt vv ith, \ 1/ , the interests of the natives of the isluutls in question New Gurnea is such a lena tiieot/iitta thnt little can be said about it It may be heie slated, however, that the propiietors of The Aigus have dcspitcheel ii special correspondent, who is well qualified tor the task, to tho roughly explore and report upon that island He has alreiel) arrived there, being the first ] special correspondent to set foot on New Guinea, und lus letters nre expected to be of absorbing mteiest So far ns is known, New Guinea possesses ever) nntural nth ou- tage for the formation of a great colonj The chmnto, though of course purel) tiopical, is not unhealthy, there are great tracts of | exceedingly fertile soil, abundantly watered with large rivers, nuil there is reason to believe tint minerals abound One of the chief objections raised to the annexation of i this îslanel is based on the supposition that the Queensland sugar planters wish to recruit | for lubouri is theie, mid that such îecruit mont would be disastrous to the natives There is no doubt that the plnnters m ques tion are looking to Ne»v Guinea us ii fielet for | labour Out Queensland coi respondent, writing on this subject a fe»v months ago, saul - "Butan)one who could advocate the nn nexation of New Guinea on the plea that the wants of the sugnr planters would thus be met must needs rectify his arguments, for the most supeifieiiil^iicquuintance with the natives would stjon satisfy him that | he had quite misciilculnted probabilities That our intercourse vi ith the natives of New Guinea will increase cannot, I think, be doubted That it should be placed on a I footing as favourable as possible for the pi o tection of the native tribes cannot also be | disputed, und that it would be quite possible that this should be done tluough the operation of our own law s some people miry believe, though I fear it must also be ad- mitted that, as regaids our own aboriginal natives, a heavy load of responsibility nttaches to us We may be quite sure, however, that if the annexation of New Guinea is determined on, it will be carried out with due regard to the rights of the native races . . Of one thing we may be cer- tain, that if the Queen's Government lends the sanction of her name to the annexation of New Guinea, it will be with due îegard to native rights It has been BO in Fiji, and it will be so m Neiv Guinea." Queensland, it should be here stated, is the only colony interested in black labour, and it has been already shown that the Australian colonies are not seeking to secure the annex ation of New Guinea or the other islands by Queensland Rear Admiral Moresby, who as far back as 1870 urged the annexation of New Guinea and the islands, in a recent letter to The Times, suggested that " the three islands of Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania would form a noble empire, which, for the sidce of future generations, shoulel not be curtailed As one who bud seen something of the wa) m which Queensland dealt with her 'native lubour,'he felt certain that the rights of the nativ cs of New Guiñe i and their future Imp piness would be well cared for by that colony" Admiral Wilson, an autliouty not bltel) to be impugned, stated in Ins valuable report to the Imperial Government upon the labour trade in the Weste rn Pacific, that the Polynesian labourers arc now, na a rule, well treated on the plantations of Queensland and 1 iji Mr Archibald Forbes, m a communi cition to the Svdney Morning Herald of June 24, said that hav mg visited three fourths of the plantations m the Mackay drstrrct, having taken the planters unawares, and having sifted the evidence with assi duity, and with Bach «kill as cxpe nuice begets, he found the "slavery' charges to be absurd us well as unfounded The "protectora" appointed by the state appear to Mr Forbes to do their duty thoroiighl) Ihe) visit the estates frcqiicntlv, the) listen to tlieconiplainlsot the I 'bourers, and when the overseer shows a tcndcnc) to pett) t)rann), the) obtain Ins dismissal, though there ma) be no ease to go into court " On the whole," SIDS Mr Torbcs, " 1 do not believe that ali) servants can be better cared for by their masters, and morcsedulousl) and stringently protected nnd fostered b) legis lotion nnd its enforcement than are the Pol) nesmit liibourers nt woik on the Bugnr plantations of Queensland " 1 he llev J G.
