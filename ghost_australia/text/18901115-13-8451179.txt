RANDOM PAPERS. By Quivia. RKSUllGET. When we have gained a victory or silenced a once clamorous foe, we love to say "Finis " over the valley to think that whatever may betide us, the lost cause, the vanquished adversary, will trouble us no more for ever. It flatters our vanity to think that what we have bound can never be loosed, that what we have buried will never rise again from the dust, it comforts us in slothful hours to think that we shall never be called to fight the old battles over again with the old foes on a new field and with uncertain issues We could not have much stomach for the fight did we not feel that the fruits of victory would be everlasting and its laurels would never fade And so, therefore, we put the dead cause and the slain adversary into the grave with the com- fortal le assurance that they will rest in peace and trouble us no more till the crack of doom But fate, that mocks us in much, mocks us in nothing more than in this attempt to write " 1 ima over what we wish to have none with Has it not been said by the wise man No idlest word thou speakest but is a seed cast into lime and grows through all Eternity '' Has not the poet seem truly snug Nothl g will die All Hill., will oblige Through eternity) History) is so full of these illustrations of the mockery of fate that it has been affirmed by the event to be merely "a supreme ironic procession, with daughter of the gods in the background ' _ has, no sooner is the protests John Huss successfully burned at the stake, and his hereBy stamped under foot, but a Luther appears, and Protestantism rises triumphant from the martyr's ashes the African is held in bondage by Christian America, and godly divines prove, by Scripture and otherwise, that it is good for the black and profitable for the white that the black man should be a slave He has nothing but bare justice to (lead for him, for he is besotted in mind and body, and offensive to all the senses The solid South will rise to a man if need be to keep him a slave, and the indifferent North with the exception of a few fanatical Liberationist, has really no decided views on the question.

Mr Henry George's visit to Australia, We have about 100 members up to the present, though no organised efforts have yet been made to beat up recruits I lie ranjirityof our members are of the working classes, the subscription being 2s 6d per annum A number of our most energetic and most aggressive men and best spent era are single tax men, but they do not form a large proportion of our members We chose the term democratic, because first of all, we are must of us democrats , secondly, because it is the name of the free trade party in the United States, where the great war against protection is now being carried to a successful issue and thirdly because any true view of it moderately also involves free trade views Democracy is government I j the people for the benefit of the people. It is utterly opposed to protection, under which the functions of Government, so far as relating to the mi position of customs duties are prostituted in order to have a am til class to the injury of the whole community I must say that during our six mouths existence we have been very well received wherever we have spoken Many of our prominent members are recognised as (neilds of labour, and several of them have been in request at orators at the Flinders park rot events and at the gillies hull during the late strike On Sunday night we had a dozen of speakers just as well able to demolish the protectionists as Mr II- and your humble servant it there had been any need for them. The difficulty is to get protectionists to meet us At present, of course, the subject is only an academic one But as soon as ever an attempt is made to alter the tariff" in a prn terrorise direction we will be made an important factor in practical centres ' On the Sunday night my correspondent refers to I took my sent in the parterre of the Gaiety 'J Theatre to listen to a public discussion, under the auspices of the as sociation, on the question, " His protection benefited the working classes of Victoria ? " When the chairman takes his seat at the table on the stage about 7 o'clock there could not have been less than 300 persons present, and before the conclusion of the debate that number had been nearly doubled The discussion of the evening was opened by my friend Jones, who in a telling yet quiet and conciliatory address demonstrated that protection had been a curse and not a blessing to the working clashes in Victoria I have seen the day when an) orator who had dared to lift up his voice against the 'J Trades- hall fetish could have been "boo hoped' into silence in such a gathering, for most of the people present belonged to the working classes. Yet it is but the simple truth to say that my friend was well received, and that passages like the following were loudly up plauded - On theoretic grounds I would ask them, how does protection affect the productive ness of labour '1 the whole scheme of protection is to tax the men engaged 111 profitable industries in order to compensate the other men for carrying on unprofitable sides tries the result must be to divert capital and labour from the inner to the less profitable industries (Cheers and 'No, no ) Now, by doing this it "must diminish the average productiveness of labour, diminish the supply of those goods which constitute wages, and therefore really decrease wages (Loud cheers ). The facts I have given you mean, if they mean anything, that you cannot encourage one industry without discouraging all the rest They mean that protection is a policy, a system, which restricts enterprise, closes up the national avenues of employment, and draws men and women from the country to crowd into the cities Your true interests he therefore, not in the restriction of labour, but they lie to day, as they have ever done, in the direction of justice, democracy, and freedom ' (Loud cheers ) My friend was replied to by a stout gentleman, who was introduced to us by the chairman as a member of Parliament from Sydney. He seemed to be painfully exercised 111 Iii. mind by the glowing picture the previous speaker had painted of free trade New South Wales, and he derived his chief comfort from the fact that while 317 millions of people were protectionists, only 47 millions supported free trade He did not contribute anything new to the discussion, yet he was lively and entertaining, as the following extracts will show - ' What after all, is protection but state socialism New South Wales is progressing, not because of free trade, but, among other things, because of her vast extent of fertile territory In your little state-(' Mr, call it the cabbage garden,' and laughter j I didn't call it that, I purposely avoided that by your little state, the most you can offer a roan is 320 acres, ('Quite enough') We after 2 "ihO ("1 hat's too much 1 The cause of tree dude has been propped up by humbug and villainy for years Protection may mean more pol), but I would rather have an Australian monopolist than a foreign monopolist. (' it makes no difference to the working man ) . Just as a man puts up his hands to defend himself, so does been deavour to defend himself when his interests are threatened by the introduction of foreign goods . . Does it stand to reason that the cultivated European, who has 10 maintain institutions and charities' And public houses, and laughter) that he can compete with the Asiatic who can live upon 21 days ('Bunkum, and laughter) Of course it doesn't, and I say, in conclusion, that if ever the Victorian people remove their protectionist tariff they will regret it only once, and that will be for ever ' (Cheers and laughter. 'He Sydney member of Parliament was succeeded by a German gentleman, who, besides being a master of his subject, was gifted with a vein of sarcasm which made his words as keen as it rapier From my notes I cull the following as specimens of his style - "The gentleman who has sat down told us in one of his most beautiful passages that as it would be our duty to oppose any enemy landing on this afford, So must we oppose goods binding on this shore. But he forgot to say that when an enemy comes here he comes to take our goods The goods which the foreigner gives us he gives us in exchange for our goods (Hear, hear,) Why do we take them' Because it pays our labour better to take them in exchange for goods we make or produce than to make them ourselves li we try to make them ourselves and in only be made to pay at the working population pay the capitalist his loss out of their em mugs. (Cheers ) The Ima referred with pride to the hundreds of millions who are protectionists. But what is the use of telling us that, unless he shows how many of those millions have representative government '' It is not (their decision. It is given them by autocratic governments and autocratic capitalists. (Loud applause I am glad he tins spoken the German), because I happen to know a little about that country (Laughter ) I can tell him that the protective policy of Getinitii) originates in an unholy alliance between the large land-holders and the largest manufacturers The question of raising the wages of the labourers was never once raised in the debate on that subject. It was carried by the agricultural vote and me manufac tating vote, by votes influenced by the large land owners and the manufacturing monopolists " iCIieers ) Of the other speakers I can only notice two, for the space remaining to me is short. 'J he first was a tall gaunt man, who see me think- ing of Dore's illustration of Don Quixote till he berlin in a rich Dublin brogue tllUB . ' I am a freetrader at heart, but at the same time I cannot help saying that protection has so far placed Victoria in advance of all the other colonies Were it not for pro t chair, considering us disadvantages in the way of sue and other things, it would certainly not keep the position it does in the Southern Hemisphere." This remarkable utterance far a freetrader was followed by others, like the bellowing of an equally confusing and maddening character - " I believe while I am a freetrader, that protection would have that effect upon New South Wales I have on me at the present moment a pair of boots made in Nutt country Wales ('What sue a ') And upon my soul I'm ashamed to look at them (Laughter and "lime') Of course, I don't think much of the argument that protection is right because 147 millions of people care for it I am like the jurymen who maintained that he was right and the other eleven wrong, and, between you and me, I believe that in general the eleven are generally wrong and the une right, (Laughter.) . . . The gentleman who has just spoken has said that we must Keep out the China man. Chinamen lune a far greater claim on us than Germans. W u forced ourselves upon the Chinese, and instead of putting a poll-tax on Chinese we should put it on foreigners, ("stuck Up') Is time up' ('Yes,' iron tile chairman )" Blowing a kiss to the audience with an airy Hick of his slender fingers the Quixotic nee franc protectionist withdrew wir!) a sweet smile', making one think mournfully that Carl) le iv is right when he asserted that men were "mostly too s " The last speaker whom I will summon was an aged man, who said that he would not quote Heures, because "fingers can be made up according' as a party requires to suit his purpose " 44 the father of a large family he believes in protection, and he dies off at a tangent to attack Mr Deakin, because "Deakin has sold the working' men who trusted in him Uns gone over to the Gillies mob" 'The ancient has devoted so much of the five minutes allotted to him to his but not, that he is interrupted by cries of " lime ' He smiles blandly when thus reminded that he must retire, and buys, "'Time's up' Well, I'm very glad it is because there are a number of speakers more capable and better man than me to come I retire from the scene with the impression that tree And' in Victoria is now more than the ' unlaid gho t" 1 formerly wrote of-not, convinced that in the early future, and in practical politics-nsuiget, itwillarise, as one from the dead, and be again a power to Bhapemens thoughts and eyes Freedom of exchange free dom of contract have become tor an Ktiglisbinan not the luxuries they would be too C'linumnn or a Russian, but prime necessaries of life. lit law and by usage they are due at night, The), were won for him longer ago For " In our halls is hung' Armoury of the invincible knights of old , V i must he tree or die who upon!, the tongue 1 list Srnl>B|to»ru spoke, in faith and morals rinks That Milton hold they are for our temporal life what liberty of conscience and liberty of speech are in things spiritual.
