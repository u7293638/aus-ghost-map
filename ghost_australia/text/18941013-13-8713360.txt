miles from Berbera, in the Gulf of Aden, and was captured in lSS7by Menelik the Second, King of Shoa, a region situated in Southern Ah) season France has been supplying that monarch with arms during the last ten years, and has sent scientific expeditions to Chon, one of which has reported that Abyssinia, as an independent state, is doomed to disappear In that event the succession to a realm in which the waters of the Blue Nile have their source would become a question of grave importance According to Mr Harris, the country of which Horror is the centre, lying on a tableland 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, will become either French or Italian, and British interests would be best promoted by haunt, Italy for a neighbour, in which case we should probably cede to that power the port of Judah, which commands the road to Harrar The objection to an acquisition of the territory by France is this-that she imports into the country of the Donukil tribes through herportsof Obockaiid
