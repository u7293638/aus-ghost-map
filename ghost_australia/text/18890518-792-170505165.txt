THE ENVOYS AT THE HOLT GHOST COL- EE&E.; As mentioned last week, the envoys, during their brief stay at Ballarat, visited the various Catholic schools of the city, including the Holy Ghost College, where the following address was read to them by Master P. Ryan* one of the students:— To John Dillon, Esq., M.P., and Sir Thomas Grattan Bsmonde, M.P. Sirs,—We, the'pupils of this young college, are happier and prouder than the strongest words,can tell to have the privilege of welcoming within its walls such world-famous visitors as those we now have here before us. "We have not yet seen many years' of life ; we cannot boast of wide experience or extensive reading; we can claim to know but : little of what men think and feel and do in lands beyond the sea; yet there is not o&e; amongst us to whom the names of billon, of Parnell, of Esmonde, and of every other member of that band of heroes who are striving with such giant efforts, such unequalled self- devotion, and such marvellous success to shiver the accursed chains which cramped and galled our fathers' limbs, are not perfectly familiar, are not infinitely dear. Tes, sundered as we are by many thousand miles from the central-ecene of these tremendous struggles', separated as we are by such a distance from that dear old Innisfail, whereyet our kinsmen breast the foul and angiytide of malice, meanness, hatred, and misfprtune, young as we. are, untravelled as. we own ourselves, surrounded as we .have, been wont to find ourselves ,,by every influence which could blind us to the nature and render us indifferent to the merits, of that sacred cause on which our .Irish mothers, taught our infant lips to invoke the blessings and the aids of Heaven; still uponthat eause our thoughts have been from day ,to clay most lovingly engaged; still have we watched its progress with the deepest and the jggqniebt interest, until at last our straining eart,- awake to every passing sound of fear, or) . hope, or hoding, have begun M tm^&iSth;* the sweetest ndtes that, ever carried rapture to the breast of man:— Tfa* (oiled oppretiWi deep »nfl*riHetilsfroan— .

Our highest aims were, in solhe little measure, to be worthy of the grand example you have set us, , worthy of the Celtic blood which throbs within'our , veins, worthy of the Wealth of fine tradition which from year to year accumulates in that historic land where even the bigots of this iron time meet every day so many to outwit, thair craft and to defy their power. conclusion, We again btg to return you our SincerSst thanks for the signal favour you have done us, and pray that from within these walls— ; Full many a raoe may start-, Oftru» men, like yon wen, toiot ai brave a paH.

To this address the illustrious gentlemen_ replied in language suited to intensify the Bentiments expressed in it, and to' imprint upon the memories of their youthful hearers an enduring recollection of their visit.
