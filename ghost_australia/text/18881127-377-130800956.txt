ORIGFINAL POETRY. IN MEMORTAM OF THE LATE JOHN HAMILL. Hnatched from a world of griefs and fears, From pain and morrow free, Thins eye-lids nrow doth weep no tear; But yet we mourn for thee. They tell us tite in vain we moour No sigh from earth brincm bhoakthe dead ; 'Tim not to call him from tmat bourne. That these hot soalding tears we shed. When angels benkoned him away, Eis loeing soul did yield; No longer wished on esrth to atsy, lint to his Harbour sealed. R io life sna mhort--all life is brief; SWp doobts alarm us with chill lears; Yst glbes) faith may find relief, lLike aohingbearte, In falling tan. How a lft his spirit took Its flight, To join tle hepveni$ host; And,, with his eyes turned heavenward, He yielded op the ghost. Come sorrow, let his praise be snug. Though death mows italks he gathers ears ; Too loved to live, to die too young, Be vlirtoes ounted o'er him yenrs. Hib pressnoe here was deeply priced By those who knew him well; Ooodasam in him san 5armonised With gifts ennspeskble. Weave, as thoe sing'mt, within thy loom, To markh.bi fall, a sable thread ; With prumise edge this web of gloom, And weave the life to come bright red, Beneath the mouldering sod he sleeps, Till Christ shall bid him rise, And join his spirit, which He keeps, Far, far, shove the skies, T'es silent elasp thst speske the mind * Is mined in moorning from him lips I Ho In regret we only dud A graueless shake of fingertip. lim parents, rrothers, sisters kind, Bosed fibwa with sacred grief; o my they onsolation find, r 'In Him who mends elief Anrd taib le a we with time no strife ,, Bet Bless His haed, so kindly rude, Th't bore him to a brighter life, Wh .
