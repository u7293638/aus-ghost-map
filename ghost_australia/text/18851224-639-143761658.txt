CHRISTMAS :'A~REMTfflWOENCE- Dear Christmas of my boyhood's tm*§' ' ' ' Art thou in snowy regions only found, j .. , Art partial to that sort of clime f -. ?Where thou can'st walk upon the fsazen ground, , * -- XV here hidest thou thy joliy face, I . 1 N ' Beaming beneath the holly's glist'nifog crown 1 'vl~~ Thy presence alway used to chase ? I \ - ' From ev'ry forehead the portentousffrown ; f- But now, old. friend, I find thee not, ,r ' ' , Though I have sought thee often far and wide, K \- Eerchance.a prejudice hast got IP, ^ ;''- \ 'Gainst crossing oTer the salt-/'ea offvn tide. J - Friend to the girls, friend to the bl?^, v . ' What expectations did thine ad renl' bring 1 _ ' ' What dreams of presents and of tojjs, Of twelfth-cake parties and' of everything ! And then tho theatre, 'that, above ) All. other ^pleasures, .took the phtne, ( ? ? ? ? For eaoh boy alwayB fell in love ?* r ~ And deeply, too, with that night's columbine. * , A ' Ah ! yes, we used to, say this then v - jAs we homeward travelled in the carriage) v ? We'd seek her out- when we were men, - ? ? ? ? And present her with our hand in marriage.' But hush ! for whispers low and deep , Thrill through us as we hiuddle all around, t , About the haunted Castle keep, i And the j^ile ghost that nightly stalks the ground. O! then; the games ! the romping games ! * The merry- laughter at the forfeit lost I 1 Snap-dragon with its ghastly flames— , The blazing raisins to each other toss'd J s For each and ia.ll were children there All. dignity of grown folks laid aside, - r r And Bmother'd was ev'ry houi ehold care In the great love and joy of Christmas-tide. i ' But wateh the knowing nods and winks 1 That telegraphic travel to and fro, ' For each and all there boldly thinks Of their privilege re the mistletoe. , Parasite on oak and apple, x ' Held sacred, in.early Druid times, * Little did'st thou think to grapple ? With the joybell sound of Christmas chimes— Of course, they jacETa5a alTSo know Beneath it dwells Bitemporal bliss, The well known rules ;of the mistletoe, That the male from female can nlnim a kiss. ' E'er he dare to make so merry Long as thd bough a berry bears From the branch above must pluck a berry. It'» establish'd virtue thus appears — But how this couple fondly grieves ' 1 ^ When they longing look to the branch above Not a. seed is there, nought but leaves So they may not proclaim their ardent love We young 'folks slylyused to gnip ? ? — ? A precious twig, with berries two or three, ~ ? ? ' — And keep it for a rosy lip, f .. Which, after bough was strip't, we pr'haps might see. She'd laugh and say, ' The; bi anch is dead.' v , But We'd reply, 'O nol pray upward look.' ? 7 ~~T~ ~ Our sprig we'd hold, just o'er her head. I'll own we an unfair advantage took, Maybe she'd box our saucy-eara,\ Whilst we'd another steal as tit for tat, But juvenile we were in years, t - , n ' And did not trouble very much for that. - ? 1 ? But, dear old Christmas, whei e art,thou ? t With love and kindness to each wretched elf * * , Not in this southern clime I vow, '? ) For each one's love is centred on himself. ' Self is his god ; his only god ^ , He from morn 'till night doth daily worship — \ ' 'Till buried underneath the sod - A ' -- He's never really known true friendship. ' ?/ 1 » ' ^ ' Pray say, do colder climes impart - . I- - Purer impulses to human nature, J I - '' ^ '? A warmer feeling to the heart, Loving kindness for our fellow creature 1 ' ' ' - ^ ' O ! why should we be left behind, ?-* ?- A J In characteristics of human love : 1 -* O ! that the coming year may find 1 - -,y,r ^ Us stiriving better for our home above. r ' v r Great love to all, to all goodwill, ' So. at this season Heav'n itself proclaim'd. - 5 It was so then, it is.so still, ' And thus mankind on earfi Bhall be reclaim'd. s ' 5 \ ' EDWABD ALLEVNE.
