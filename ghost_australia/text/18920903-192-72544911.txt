A Curious Circumstance. Phil Lorimer, poet, traveller, and star gazer, &c.;, visited Windsor last Saturday. Phtl says he is a believer in ghosts, and has seen them. Upon being pressed to give his reasons for beliving in the exis tance of ghosts, he said : 4 One night I went to sleep, and I heard a voice speak ing to tne. Upon opening my eyes (I was then neither asleep nor awake) I saw ( a man with a freckled face, covered with red haiir. He touched me on the arm and skid, " Phil, I want you to read the fun- j eral service over me; don't forget." I' replied ; " Alright, old man; I'll do it." In the morning I told the shepherd what I saw fctidheard. The man in charge of the sheep remarked if the man was lying about dead the sheep would soon find j him. By driving sheep about you can \ easily tell if there is anything unusual the matter by their movements. We drove the sheep about, and found the dead] body of a man fifteen miles off. There was the very man I saw in my dream. His tace was freckled, and he had red hair. One side of his face was black, and a bit decomposed. I never saw the man before in my life, and I never heard ' of his description.' How can you account j for this?" !
