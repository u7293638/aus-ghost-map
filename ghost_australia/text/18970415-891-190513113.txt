He is well known as a painter of English cathedrals. The atmospheric effect is beautifully rendered, especially at the lower portion of the build ing. the evening snn throwing shadows on the porch, and lighting up projections here and there. Mr. Hine has chosen for his sub ject the west - front, which is the position where most of the cathedral is seen, owing to the Dean and Chapter having recently cleared away some of the old houses, lie has shown considerable skill in drawing the immense pile of building. It i« a fine sub ject very cleverly handled, and is sure to attract much admiration from visitors to the gallery.
