RACE FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP AT POET ADELAIDE. TO THE XDITOB. J Sir — This day week Mr. Michel more will launch from his v yard, Port Adelaide, the ' Prince Alfred,' the firsv outrigger boat ever built in this colony, and -on that day month— on the 26th of, October— the race for the championship ; of South Australia takes place. Messrs.'' W. Russell, W. P. Clark, D.' Gibson, E. Blackmore, and J. McKtenzie (cox.), are the present champions who row the Falcon; and Messrs. J. Playfair, J. Smith, W. H. Hopkins, J. Shaw, and X Michelmore ;(cox.), who row the Prince Alfred. The unusual interest already centred on the event indicates considerable excitement on the occasion of the race, and the probable winner is a topic of al most constant conjecture. The Falcon, % reason, of her - championship, is freely backed, whilst not a few (and I am amongst the number) are game to put a bet on the new boat. If Mr. Michelmore's men -.are able to sit their boat, that is, to row it -with precision, a point on 'which divers opinions obtain, but upon which the crew themselves have little apparent misgiving, the Falcon, despite the early practice and training of her crew, will not stand the ghost of a chance. Of this I have no maimer of doubt, that if the out rigger is rowed with that excellent preci sion which characterised the long nor{h country stroke of her crew in their old boat, the champions are whipped men; but df -she is not exquisitely balanced, if she is not rowed to a nicety, her crew, if. they dont have a care, stand a much better chance of getting a ducking than the medals.
