Are there any Ghosts 1 PERSONS OAN RETOBN PROM ANOTHER WORLD. [OAÂ«HOLIC RBTIEW.} Since ib Is not only possible that persons can return from another world, bub that there are well authenticated accounts of persona who have done so, must we, then, believe all the current stories about spirits or ghosts 1 By no means, for there is not one of them out of a thousand worthy of the least credence, or could stand the test of examina tion. They all, in almost every capo, can be explained in a natural way, even those of the reality of whloh there appears to be little doubt. Fear and an excited imagination will conjure up 'imaginary apparitions and spectres. So will a gloomy and melancholy temperament. When the Puritans, of whom gloom and melancholy were the characteristic qualities, became the dominant power in England in 1649, we read that thoro wne a widespread fear of ghoatsnover known before in the land. Remorse of conscionoe, for great and unnatural crimes, will, too, tring up unreal spectres threatening punishment ! or vengeance. The real ghosts, then, in the past, beyond what a deluded imagination painted, have been few and far between, and they promiso to bo so in the future. Nor la it necessary that there should be many ghosts, Bince we have " Moses and the pro phets" to direct and warn us, and do not need the spirit of a Lazarus to come from the "bosom of Abraham" to do ao. If, how ever, a genuine ghost should appear to any of as, which after all is possible, to ask, perhaps, the assistance of our prayers, or otherwiso to warn us, we need not feel the least alarm, particularly so if our conscience be at peace with God, for no ghost, no spirit, no apparition, not' even a fancy, can do ua any harm or injury unless by God's per mission.
