A HINT TO ARTISTS. Those unacquainted with the trials and difficulties of the newspaper artist, says the Daily Graphic, will read with delight the article on this subject in thc current issue of Lippincott. It is, of course, written from an American point of view, and the methods differ in some respects from those employed in this country. As regards smartness there is not much difference. The "curious" person is, it seems, justas rampant in the States as here, and, similarly, the one only question he asks when he "spots" an artist squeezed into an out-of-the- way corner with note book in hand, is "Are you sketching?" -- which, in view of the open book, with its clear, concise sketches, is an insulting superfluity. The answer which, according to our transatlantic contemporary, turneth away the bore, is, " No, sir: I am fishing for turtles." The small-boy element is less easily despatched ; but the artist's ingenuity proved equal to the occasion -- once, at all events. His orders called for a number of pictures of old bridges, but he had not settled down to work near one of them before he was surrounded by about forty urchins of assorted sizes and questionable cleanliness. After trying one scheme and failing, he said to the nearest of the little nuisances: " Now, boys, I want to sketch one or two of you swimming beneath the bridge." In a moment the entire hand undressed and were in the water. The sketch was finished without further trouble but, adds the writer, "Whenever I see now a little boy afflicted with.a very bad cold I experience pangs of conscience, and I am haunted by a vision of the ghosts of forty naked little boys who had gone swimming one chilly May day under an impulse diabolically given by myself."
