TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Straw considerable amount of interest has been excited rec ally with reference to skin al Societies- and the tact deplored that there exists no s co v in Sydney in any ten of at states' representing the musical taste and ability of this the oldest and fans t city of the Southern hemisphere Even Mandil s Cho it has come from the shades of evuke our emulation by compels" us we hour Vtctoinn sister Other correspondents have given as a reason of the lack or a good Musical Tin in the jealousies of prose stories and the ambition of amateurs' None of your correspondents have ever seemed to hit upon the true cause of our incident The much enduring amateur has had cast upon him the charge of standing in the river seriously injuring the prospects of professionals, and driving from us those who would have otherwise of remained, and shed the lustre of their talents upon us to any who look on < partially upon the question this would be regarded as any thing but the right solution of the difficulty, it would not do in the pi The Tress to refer to the question of motors, as regards some great musical teachers, who have been, and gone, or still remain amongst us but there are few who have been intimate with societies for the last twenty years here who can avoid the painful conclusion that music has often been sounded more in the lion i, of his friends and projections than by all of her causes put together Again it is admitted that we have amateur's, amongst us who would be a credit to any community, and who have held their own even amongst musics! p ofrssors for years past and it will be possibly allt wed that these amateurs have not reached this position without bird work, studying their art under circumstances which makes the r and co s deserving of far higher or use turn that it really see del It is also patent that in this day there reto be found those calling themselves pro lies, awake, vol i have ceived only (colonial culture, and that not of the highest order, and who arrogate to themselves such a position without a scintilla i of I nt mc scientific claim to it Handel s Gh st ' refers to a treat be enjoyed in Melbourne last Last r Having visited that city lately, I may say he echoes the general sentiment of the public there One reason of tbeoxccllence the Philharmonic Society has attained in Melbourne is this, that they secure if louis of unquestionable ability, and pay them and? I am, not scr sure that the " Ghost ' is light in stating that the soloists are always professionals nor does it appear some desirable, if true artistic ability is discovered in an amateur, that an inferior professional should be always trotted out, b cause he, or she is a professional The fact of obtaining a living by a particular art does not make the professors the roof superior to those who do not get their living by it. Genius is cowupohtan, and ought not to be trammelled by such nice dim, notions "We have known instances of men who for years have lived by a certain < carnation, finding a more congenial sphere for their abilities in another, and it is not so certain but that this would sometimes apply to professors of music If I am not asking too much spare in your columns, and you deem this worthy of insertion therein I would further suggest that some five irs < ) mum, if they cannot be either at members?, should liberally surport with subscriptions the proposition for the inauguration of ay., d son of an cal sorely , that at a meeting be covered, and a conductor of known ability be appointed aid v eil paid for It u not, so that he may be able to give a Bulb, i nt amount of time to the interests of the society and not be dependent on a Very finest enable mode of payment usually adopted in the form of a testimonies!
