A starched and dignified old gentleman, who had been a stockbroker, but had recently retired to enjoy his otium sum dignitate, was anxiously endeavouring to buy a suburban residence suitable for a bachelor of means. Many weary journeys were made, but without effect and the old gentleman began to despair of finding a house which, in his eyes at any rate, had not come fatal defect. Just when he was plunged in the profoundest disappoint- ment, he one morning took refuge in the auction mart from a shower. Shortly after he entered, the auctioneer put up a property which at once attracted the attention of the hard-to-please stockbroker. It was described in glowing periods as "an elegant and substantially-built stone residence on the banks of the Thames, at Staines, with right of fishing in the river, and commonage rights on Runnymede." The house was represented to be in so perfect a state of repair that nothing would require to be done to it for the next ten years. The listeners were repeatedly reminded of the associations of the property " King John and Magna Charta, and the British Constitution." The biddings started at 150, and the hero of the tale, fired with the ambition of becoming a freeholder and ending his days in BO eligible a bachelor retreat in the midst of such charming surroundings, began to bid with energy until at last he was declared the purchaser at Â£700. Delighted to be at the end of all his anxieties, he hurried down to Staines, congratulating himself upon his exceptional good fortune. When his destination was reached, however, he was filled with rage and mortification to discover that the bachelor elysium for which he had had with so light a heart was the abandoned toll- house at Staines Bridge 1
