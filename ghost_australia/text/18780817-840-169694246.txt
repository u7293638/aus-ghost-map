THE COMING ORIOKBUUNG SEASON. A C0BBE3P0NDENT, a wolUknown Brisbano cricketer, sends us tho following remarks on tho subjcot of, the fortbooming^orioketing Beason :— The scaeou about to bo: oommpnood promises to be ons-of tho best that, Queensland lias yeb behold. Tho Queen's Park, it is truo, will, not bo reatjfcyfor tho variou3,clubB to do battlo on, but then-, we havo that enthusiast of cricket, host Humilton, who, lihpar, has cleared away a lutgfl portion of ground,, so that two matches can,bo played at once.. Then there is Padding ton, Pit, bo calleft by 'Grubber,' where a gjMno can bo played' at a pinch. Toovong, Mgt with talont this year, baa by no meana a bad tui£ to play on, and, no. doubt, I thojr criokot grcund. will be tho sceno oj many a goodly oontest in the coming soascn. Too j-wong, I boliovs,, play thoir first matsh against tho Milton olovou, in tho middlo of &ext; month, whon, no doritibt/thoro will bo a large attondanco to witness tliis fight, -which already is being looked fojward to with interest. Toowong is strong no doubt, made up as it ia of Albert, Stanley, and othor dubs, bat Milton will give thorn a hard tussle, seeing it has. got a valuable addition to the bowling department. I hoar from an Oxloy oriokolor that thoir new ground I ia ready, mi tba.t -i fine wiokat can be proi cured thoro; I hope tho Stanloy Club will show up this timo, for it would bo a pity for a club that ban oarnod for itself a .nnino in dayB past to givo up the ghost. On, Stanloy, on J 'you can yot teach tho Alberts a lesson, and dross down Milton and Toowong. !But what of tho Wuratnhs P They aro not dofunct, I beliove, not as long as thero is a Petrio or n Banbury about, I know. I havo no doubt they will bo in tho front rank amongst the clubs in tho oity. Lot mo now put down the probable programme of matohes to bo played by the Milton Eleven in tho oricket season about to dawn':— ...Date. :i.
