CYCLING. WHEELMARKS. [Br Handlebab.] Final arrangements bare now been made for the cyclists' Church parade to- morrow, particulars of which appear in onr advertising columns. Besides the Souths, North Adelaides, Norwoods, and Ade laides the Gawler and Quidnunc Clubs will be re presented, whilst a large number of unattached riders are expected to be present. All cyclists are requested to appear in uniform, and to be at Vic toria-square by 2 p.m. The track of an evening now presents quite a lively appearance in view of the November meeting. That popular little Melbourne rider, W. J. C. Elliot, is over for a week on business, and has been making good use of bis time by having a few spins. Though not yet in the pink of condiBon he is im proving, and could he but stay here up to the time of the Austral I would like his chance for the Classic event. In the early morning Stapleton, May field, Davey, and others do serviceable work; whilst in the evenings, long string, including Davis, Sampson, Gordon, Pearson, Snell, Bains, Baker, Toms, Gazard, Hunter, Dale, Downes, Pasquil], Bertram, Bidley, and Fowler have commenced operations. None as yet are very forward, though Davis, Baker, and Toms on safeties average 63 sec. laps. I hear that All. Gowling is again likely to come out. In spite of the fact that Melbourne papers are continually averring that Tom Busst will don the silk at the November carnival, I have it on credit able authority that such is not the case, and it is doubtful if he will race again. Though every one wishes that the Victorian crack will again compete, and all very much regret his indisposition, it is not fair to the public that they should be led to believe that the noted flier will compete when there is not the slightest chance of his so doing. TheNorth Adelaides and Norwoods had a pleasant time at Gawler on Saturday last, when they were entertained by the local team. The former club were wise in reaching their destination by train, but with the exception of two the Norwoods pro ceeded by road. Tne result was that they v. ore not only too late for the reception by Mayor Cox, but the ride proved anything but pleasant. The social in the evening waB very largely attended, and was most successful. On Sunday the cyclists chose the home route via Gumeracha, which was reached in time for dinner. The roads were in a wretched condition, and with so many waterholes to wade through dismounts were numerous. Town was reached at dusk. The cyclists speak highly of the Gawlerites' hospitality, and report that cycling is on the boom in Modern AthenB. In the old days this outing was amongst the most enjoyable in the programme, and the (Hubs are to be commended for their endeavours to revive old associations. Intercolonial papers were eagerly scanned on Wednesday to get a glance at the handicaps for the Austral meeting. The only South Australians entered are Gedaes, Stapleton, Snell, and Bertram. It is too early yet to speak of their ihances, for with the exception of the two former the nominators have not donned silk. With 100 yards in the Austral Stapleton has not a ghost of a chance, and it would be interesting to Know how the hand! capper arrived at his conclusions. Geddes is not likely to start. Of those entered I must confess to a liking of the chances of Barry Lampton, who was such a hot favourite last year, but was taken ill two days before; W. J. C. Elliot, Muirbead, Gonard, and young Rolfe, Witb such a field to get through I can hardly see Mullins having a chance, though he is in splendid fettle; whilst J. W. H. Busst, Eellow, or Howard Lewis will have a hard task to win. But now that the handicaps are out there may be many changes before the day, of which more anon.

F. de Clvry writes to Cycling that be is willing to back George Cassignard, of Bordeaux, for £100, to ride against Founder or any one in the world for the championship of the world. The match to take place either at Heme Hill, London, or on the Buffalo Track, Paris, the distances to be 1, 6, and 10 kilo metres. Cassignard will ride a Clements new racer, weighing 17 lb. B. H. Carlisle rode from Edinburgh to London in 82 hours 66 minutes. This lowers the previous record, held by Bansome, by more than 10 hours. Cooper, Edge, and Steel, on board a water cycle, competed against a treble sculler in the Staines Town Begatta, the distance being 1 mile and 6 fur longs. After a neck-and-neck race the water cycle won by half a length. M. A. Holbein and A. Brown, on a tandem tricycle, fitted up with clincher .tires, ride 184 miles in twelve hours.
