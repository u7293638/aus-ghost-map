THE APRIL REVIEWS. A chorus of criticism of Lord Salisbury's foreign policy (rose up from the Reviews this in with the "Contemporary beds the attack with an unsigned article on " The Failure of Our Foreign Policy," in which the writer expresses nothing but censure and disappointment. It was thought, he says, that the Cabinet might prove weak in matters of domestic legislation, but that in its hands the interests of the Empire were safe Facts have not justified that confidence, for he thinks that never before, in this century it least, has the British Empire been in such serious danger as to-day Great Britain is being ousted from the world's neutral markets, her political prestige has completely disappeared, territory purchased with the life-blood of her best men is being frittered away in " graceful concessions," and the conditions essential to come murder] expansion are being systematically destroyed by her pushing rivals In Asia Africa, America, and Madagascar, it is said, France has ridden roughshod over our rights The writer insists that the public have been deceived by Ministry in regard to Russian action in China and urgES that results there bear stronger tests irony to the phlegmatic forbearance of Britons than to the qualifications of the experienced states man to whom they have committed the conduct of the Empire He instances the capture of Talienwan by Russia, the dismissal of British officials in Corea and Chum on Russia n representations and Russian ascendancy in Mnuohtina, where the Chinese flag already bears the Russian colours in one corner Then he quotes the cession of 1 2000 miles of territory ceded in Abyssinia, the passing of what is known as " the Bristol coast " in West Africa and Trench rule, " our soil lation and pusillanimity " in the Transvaal, and other instances of what he regards as failure It in hardly too much to say," contends this uncompromising critic, " that since the days of King Charles II foreign States have never treated the rights and interests of Great Britain with less consideration or more studied disre pilot " That the writer is a Conservative is shown by his general tone of agreement with the party policy in the past, but he avers that Lord Salisbury accomplished his mission when he saved Ireland from Home Rule or Separation The present problem is how to save the Empire from dismemberment, he holds and in this Lort S ilia bury's Government has signally failed " The Balance of Power, by " Quorum Pars Tui," is another noteworthy contribution, in which the question is discussed as to whether Great Britain should throw in her lot with the Dual or with the Triple Alliance The writer thinks that there is no point at which we cannot treat direct with Russia on matters concerning our joint interests He claims that her policy in Asia has been honourable as a whole duly allowing for what he calls psychological comnderihioiis The case as to France is different, nine she wants concessions, and we have no need of a Trm h alliance, though there is no reason why the in- crests of France should clash with ours if she would keep to her own natural sphere As matters stand, however, the writer contends that England's neutrality preserves the balance of European power, and if the German people would only insist on their ruler confining his action within constitutional bounds there need be no question of preponderance and alliances Speak- ing of Germany, he thinks it is indeed an ironical turn of Destiny's wheel that the nation which was the first to think itself free of clerical domina Son should fall the first prize to government by the grace of God Another contributor, Professor Westlake, defines the English and French positions in West Africa , and among other articles are some dealing with India on a gold basis, the cycle industry, and the differences of Christianity The "Nineteenth Century" gives the critic's place to M de Presscnsc. whose article, entitled " France and England," is not nearly so out- spoken as others elsewhere by English bands this month His quarrel is not so much with the Premier as with Mr. Chamberlain, and the deplores the illness of the one at a time when it not likely to drive more rope to the other He finds comfort in the fact that Mr Balfour, and not Air Cham berlain or Lord Cromer, was chosen to act for him, as also in the perfect coolness with which the country, and even the most select organs of Jingoism, registered that wise proceeding He refuses to see any fatal causes of conti 1 between England and France over West Africa, and insists that a peaceful compromise is quite possible. He suggests that the West African and Far Eastern questions be dealt with in this way, with Russia associated in the settlement Diplomacy, he argues, is not powerless , our century, on the eve of giving up the ghost, is not condemned to the scandal of war, and a redistribution of empire can be effected without punting in blood the lines of our new borders Sir William White, who, as director of naval construction, may be presumed to know something of his subject, writes here about the latent reconstruction of the navy He rapidly reviews the history of his subject for the past 40 years A now waistcoat has been created since 1887, he HUTS, at a cost of about 60 millions sterling In that time 29 battleships, 102 censure on the three classes, 29 torpedo gun- boats, and 30 sloops, gunboats to , have been added to the fleet In coal endurance and speed great progress has been made, as well as improvements in gun construction, including the development of quick-firing guns Archibald S Hurd comments on the curious fact that while the British Government is doing its best to onhtnp foreign Powers in the race for naval supremacy, British ship! building yards are engaged in producing warships for our possible enemies For Japan they have eight battleships and cruisers and r way, and eight torpedo boat destroyers for Norway there is a cost defence ship, for Germany a swift torpedo-boat destroyer , there are two orders each for Portugal and Brazil ; while for Austria there are four torpedo boats Sir William Armstrong has boasted that the cruiser Buenos Aires, constructed by him for the Argentine, has no equal among the cruisers of the British navy It is said that the same claim might be made for the new turban and Chinese cruisers, both British-built Our yards have constructed for foreign navies ships equal to about a third of the whole British fleet Other contributors discuss the subjects, among others, of death under chloroform, the centenary of 91 and vegetarianism ; while Mr T Diggle writes about the Conservative party and the municipal elections and Benjamin Taylor presents a study in trade unionism The " Fortnightly " has an opening paper by " Diplomaticiis," entitled "Where Lord Salisbury has failed " He charges that there is a deep and growing dissatisfaction with the conduct of foreign affairs by the present Government, show ing itself in the Conservative press and on the Minister at benches as well as among the Opposition He makes out a strong indictment with regard to Si in, Madagascar, Tunis the Upper Nile, and the cession to Abyssinia, China, and West Africa Instead of expanding the Empire, he says, we have ceded territory to I France and Abyssinia , instead of defending our shame and possessions no have allowed the trench to invade and occupy regions proclaimed IIB English instead of preventing the closing of our markets, we have lost those of Tunis and Mndngturcar, and a large part of Siam, and stood idly by while Russia and Germany have created sphere of influence in Shantung and Manchuria Against all this there is China's valueless promise not to alienate the Yangtse Valley, the prospects of opening of the treaty ports in Hunan, the opening of the in- land waters of China to trade, the losses of Central Siam from Tenth ambition, and the concession of most favoured! nation treatment by Abyssinia The writer thinks that the Jameson Raid is responsible for most of what he calls the floundering and wobbling of the first three cars, in that it elicited a revel action of the Anglophobe tendencies of Germany, followed by the attempt to conciliate France and the misunderstood expressions of friendliness towards Russia But at the end of his paper " Diplomatics " makes a suggestive admmmon Soeloy traced the expansion of England, he says, to that Pcnoo of Elizabeth which was in itself a long record of conversions not always graceful or even honour- able Another Seeley, he adds, may one day find that the Peace of Victoria, to which Lord Salisbury has substantially contributed, was not as dearly purchased on some of us imagine Holt G Hallett writes aboubBntish trade and the integrity of China, and incidentally echoes some of the criticisms of the Governmental policy Notwithstanding the brave speeches made by our Minister on the platform, he says, there is good reason to believe that Germany has treated their words as wind, and does not intend to refrain from proving on duma and restricting the area of trade for other nations He forecasts that Germany Will divide the region north of the Yangtse with Russia, and foment difficulties between England and France over the division of the remainder The Justice of Russia's demands for an leo free port has been admitted by Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour ; but Mr Hallett argues that if the integrity of China is to he preserved, and if large (sections of that country are not to be annexed by foreign Powers and closed to the trade of the rest of the ffOil"4! prompt action u necessary. WV 'Cg about the Maine disaster and the prospects of war, Mr Fred T Jane makes some predictions about the strength of the Spanish fleet and the security of the Philippines, which the late engagement has since disproved but he adds a curious suggestion about the division of the United States into three republics of the East, West, and South, of Spain should happen to be victorious.
