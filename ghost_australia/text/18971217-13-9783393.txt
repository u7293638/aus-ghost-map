FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1897. The Legislative Council was initiated as a House of review. Nothing stands still in this world, however. Evolution is continuous. Aud the Legislative Council has been rapidly passing of late years into the position of a House of Appeal. And we may say at the outset that we record the circum- stance from the historical standpoint, without necessarily expressing ap- proval of the change. Whether it makes for good or ill, or both, the process is patent. Trades, in- terests, classes, and professions who are affected by legislation are falling into the way of allowing a measure affecting them to pass the Assembly, and then addressing a full statement of facts to the Council with a cry for amendment, or for aid, or for relief. There are two influences at work. The first is one of convenience. When a bill has passed the Assembly you see what the proposal really is, and not before. Thus the experienced mem- bers of the Council never themselves read a bill until it reaches their House because of the difficulty of following alterations made elsewhere. But the second is the more potent and opera- tive cause, and it is that the affected Interests say:—"It is better for us to " concentrate our energies. Members, " as a rule, do not understand business " issues in the Lower House. They are " politicians; no more and no less. " The few members who have a grip " of affairs are set aside. Debate a " trade or professional question, and " nine members out of ten leave the " Assembly, and come back to vote " just as much in the dark as when " they went away. But the Council " members grasp the points at once. " These are the very questions which " they take a lively interest in debat- " ing. There is a good deal in the " contention of the labour party that " you want labour members to be in " touch willi labour issues, and so it is " with mercantile matters. Our ex- " perience is that the men who are " strangers to the ways of trade, the " practice of the professions, and to " the operations of finance, are in- " different and bad judges, and we go " to the court which understands the " position." So runs the plea, which is heard on every side. Instances have been numerous of late. The Exported Products Bill is a strong case in point. Last session the butter trade addressed the Council alone, declaring that members else- where had been got at by cheap claptrap talk about middlemen and about some ideal perfec- tion dreamt of by Government in- spectors, and impossible in a big trade of all sorts. The result was that the new Assembly did wake up a little and did set aside the official grading scheme. But the various other serious objections were scarcely heard of in the Lower House when the present bill was under discussion, whereas they have been submitted with a convincing fullness of detail to the Council. So with the bill regarding the estates of deceased persons. It is astounding that such a measure should have gone through the Lower House with its ob- jectionable details undisturbed. But Mr. Madden and Mr. Moule were voices in the wilderness, and it was not until the measure reached the Upper House that a forcible and volu- minous remonstrance came from the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the injury the measure would work, and asking in the public interests for a new lock, a new stock, and a new barrel. With the newspapers it is the same. A provision was adopted in the Postal Bill refusing the use of the Post-office to papers which contain a block or a stereotyped advertisement from Great Britain or any of the sister states. Obviously this is a monstrous provision. Metropolitan dailies would not feel it in any way, but it would hit country papers hard, both as regards their advertisements and their supple- ments. A newspaper wholly printed in Great Britain could be re-posted in Victoria at the ordinary rate—mem- bers in the Assembly insisted upon that—but a 2in. block or engrav- ing received from England in connection with an advertisement would deprive the luckless Victorian paper of all postal privileges. The Council has been inundated with pro- tests and particulars, and, after hear- ing the appeal, it could not but accede to the prayer of the petitioners, Mr. Sachse finding the members unani- mous when he took action. There are two reasons why attention should be called to the position. In the first instance, it explains why the business of the Council grows heavier and heavier—the hostile and unfair way of stating the fact being that the Council interferes more and more. And the second is to ask whether the new procedure is altogether wise. The situation is highly complimentary to the Council, no doubt. It is evi- dence of its steady growth in the con- fidence and esteem of the settled and business interests of the community. But the Assembly is a jealous House, and if it conceives that that it is passed over it is apt to become willful and stubborn. It may be more complex and may involve more trouble for affected interests to work and agitate in the one House equally with the other, but the results might be more satisfactory. It would lessen the pre- sent risk of friction and misunder- standing. After all is said, however, every constitution cuts out its own channels.
