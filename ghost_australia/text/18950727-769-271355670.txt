The Old Bay Horse is Dead. [By Wantagong.] In n quiet spot in the “ Volunteer " Out of sight of the common herd The old bay horse passed in his checks And by T. K. was interred. “ No useless coffin enclosed his breast ” He sleeps in his natural hide, And lays like a warrior taking his rest. ” He went with the turn of the tidde. He walked like a martyr to the stake, Hands shook that tied him there ; The gun went up—the trigger touched— ithody had done his .-hare.
