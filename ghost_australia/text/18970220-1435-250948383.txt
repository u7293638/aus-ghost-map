A Haunted House. The romance of Christmas has been heightened by the discovery of a haunted house in the village of Edithweston, in Rutlandshire (writes a London correspondent). This particular ghost occupies itself chiefly with knocking at doors, and in the house in ques- tion most uproarious noises have been heard at all hours of the day and night. The closest investigation has been made, but up to the present no apparent reason for the noise has been discovered. The persons who have endeavored to solve the mystery include lawyers, doctors, clergymen, police officers and other men who are accustomed to examine into evidence, and none of them have been able to elucidate the mystery. The knocks have been heard over and over again in broad daylight by groups of men who were standing within a yard or two of the door. Occasionally the sounds would come appa- rently from the inside of a email cupboard, which was opened immediately afterwards, but without discovering anything to account for the remarkable ocurrences. In numerous instances the sounds have been heard 150 yards away. It seems to be quite impposible that the noises ate the result of practical joking, or the perpetrators must inevitably have been caught before this. One of the doors has recently been varnished, and one day loud and repeated, knocks were heard, but the most careful examination immediately afterwards to see if marks could be found on the varnish or on the wood proved futile. One resident in the neighboring town of Stamford has interviewed a large number of the inhabitants of Edithweston and the neighborhood, and his inquiries clearly show in the first place that nearly every person in the parish has heard the knocks over and over again, and in the second place that no one can give a reasonable ex- planation of them. I suppose the mystery will sooner or later be solved, but at present it appears to be inexplicable.
