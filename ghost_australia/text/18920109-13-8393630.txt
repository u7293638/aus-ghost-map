MR. FRITH. LIFE OF JOHN LEECH. I PRICES AS A SCHOOLBOY. Mr 1 nth gives us some delightful examples of Leech as a schoolboy letter writer Here are a few relics of the days when the future artist was at Charterhouse along with Thackeray) - Charter House, October 2,1820 M) dear Papa You told me to write to you when the reports were handout the) are made out now, and mind Is, does his Host I hope you are quite well, and Marian the same I hope Tom Mary Caroline and I ster are quite well I have not spoken to Mr Chapman vet about the water and drawing. Master, because I had not an opportunity bend into a cake as soon as it a convenient Your affectionate son J H Knell Wear Papa,- As I am rather short of money and want to keep no) money I've got, I should be much obliged if you would give an ambassador 18 pence or so as I've promised a boy) at school one of those small bladders to make balloons of if you remember an bought me one once I hope you are all well -I remain, ) our affectionate son, -I LERCH Master John had an amusing) sein elbow appreciation of the maxim " Ask and it shall be given unto you ' We read - Send me another suit of clothes if you please and a cap Mind the gloves Send me a penknife in) on please I remain, so And, again, a pregnant postscript - Tell Mamma to send me a t cake as soon as she can send me some money as soon as you can 'the recipient of these effusions, Leech's father, kept a superior sort of coffee house, and intended his son for a doctor John beech got as far as walking the wards at "Bart's' in company) with Albert Smith, Percival bergh, and Gilbert a Beckett, nil destined to be colltihnrutnrs in 'The men can go and work which was presented) to absorb linn Oddly) enough, Leech was nulli told shouldered in the earlier numbers of J'nmli, his first contribution-a page illustration in the fourth niimbercunciituring those favourite victims, the Cockney) 1 Frenchmen on the purlieus of Leicester square-being supposed, for some obscure reason, to June caused an alarming drop in the circulation HIS MODISH Leech was the most modest of men in by one of my autumnal holidays Leech stated a few days with me He had not been well, picking up " a thousand stones in a thousand hours," to which he likened his unceasing work, had begun to tell upon him, and in reply to a) warning, that for his own sake, to say nothing of the interests of Punch, he should husband his strength for, I added, "if anything happened to you, who are the backbone of Parish, what would become of the paper's can see him smile as I hear him say, " Don't talk such rubbish ! backbone of Punch indeed ' Why), bless ) our heart ! there isn't a fellow at work upon the paper that doesn't think that of himself, and with about as much right and reason as I should Punch would get on well enough without me, or any of those who think themselves of such importance " "'Talk of drawing, my) dear fellow," he once said to me, " what is now) drawing compared to 'Tenniel's' Look at the way that chap can draw a boot, wh), I couldn't do it to save my life ' It was no less a fact that for nearly a quarter of a century he was the leading spirit of Punch " T bank." saul 'J hashim), what a number of Punch would be without a drawing by Leech in it I IFFOll AND till ETON BOY It is pleasant to think that Leech, who had been such a thorough schoolboy) himself, find a soft place in his heart as well as in his pictures for other schoolboys in the height of his fame The following letter was in reply to an Eton boy who had sent in a joke to Perth, has seen it reappear us a Leech picture, and had been astonished to find that current fables about Mr Punch's largesse in such cases did not come true Dear Sir,-The editor of " Punch Is the person who should be addressed upon all money matters connected with that periodical However, in the present instance, perhaps it will answer ever) put pose If I adopt the suggestion of your great friend and confidant and ' do the handsome and send A tip direct which I do in the shape of a post-office order for one guinea or as your ' entirely disinterested young friend is to have half of what you get, it will be even better if I make the order for two medicos instead as I do, only you must not look upon this as a precedent I am afraid Mr Punch would have a considered that the trouble and expense he was at to have an original design made to your few Hues would have been ample recompense In future send to the editor your notion of what You expect for any contribution and he will acceptor rejectaccordhigl} Idaresa),- Yours faithfully), lost I FECII The boy, nettled, wanted to send the money back , but Leech's good nature was not to be bullied, and he went on to give all sorts of kind encouragement to the young as permit LEKCU'S nounce 01 SlftrFT NOISES Leech's morbid horror of noise is well known His nervous affection was more exaggerated in him than even in Carlyle Several instances occur in these pages - One evening a convivial part) of the Ancient Order of Foresters, returning from perhaps the Costal Palace, where high festival had been held, roused poor Leech almost to madness is a felling uproar opposite his door, he left his work, and rushed bareheaded among them " What are you making this hornblende for'" 'Then seeing the extraordinary Robin Hood kind of costume affected by these people, he said - " What it all about-who are you "Wear Foresters, that's what we said" was the rep!) "'Then, why) on earth don't you go into a forest and make your infernal row there instead of disturbing whole street with our noise'" said Leech A garden roller was as bad as a street organ- Mr Mark Lemon told me one day that Leech had been invited to a gentleman's house in the country for a few days hunting He arrived there in the evening He was awakened early in the morning; by a grating noise made by the gardener rolling the gravel under his window-noise he could never endure This had such an effect upon his nerves that he got up, packed his things, and was off to tow it before all of the family were aware of it A barrel organ was to him an instrument of torture Wil, HUMOtllt, ASDVIhtANOIIOri Leech, who used to write the often admirable matter accompany) ing his drawings himself, had wit as well as humour - Some years before Leech s death the editor of a newspaper, who was remarkable for the severity of his criticisms and for his extreme personal ugliness, had made some caustic remarks on Leech's work in general, and on some special drawings in particular If that chap, said Leech tome, doesn't mind what he is about, I will refrain and defend myself " "An idle threat,' comments Mr Frith, for nothing could have provoked that gentle, noble nature into personality), no trace of which is to be found in the long list of his admirable works " But, with all his wit and humour, Leech had the stamp of melancholy too - Leech's mental condition was certainly deeply tinged with the sadness so common to men who possess wit and humour to a high degree He sang well, but his songs were all of a melancholy character, and very difficult to get from him Indeed, the only one I can remember, and that but partial), was something about "King Death," with allusions to a beverage culled "coal black wine, which that potentate was supposed to drink As I write I can see the dear fellow's melancholy face, with his eyes cast up to the ceiling, where Dickens said the song was written in ghosts) characters which none but Leech could read
