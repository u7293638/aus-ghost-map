THE ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO SHOOT MR. JOHN GRAY, OF KIAMA. It will be in the recollection of the public that an attempt was : made, on- the 28th April i last, to shoot Mr. John Gray, Kiama, and the i outrage was attended with fearful interest, ;inas- ? much as the attempt to shoot that gentleman j was supposed to have arisen from his 'anti Fenian proclivities, at the time when Feniamsm ; was supposed to have been an actuating principle ;' in the minds of many persons in this commu- - nity. -.,'.' v ! The apprehension engendered by the supposed ! attempt to assassinate Mr. Gray,' ??induced the ? Government at the time to offer a regard for ! such information as would lead to the conviction ! of the offender or offenders : but it had almost ceased to hold a place in human' lemunbraneb, when the citizens were startled by the report that a number of men had been tajcen into custody on suspicion of being the perpetrators of what was believed to bean attempt to coinmifc a deadly outrage. ?'''?'? : l\ The names of the persons arrested were Patrick Lennard, Bernard M'Guckin, and Daniel M 'Bride, and they were charged on.. the -28th July last with attempting to murder John Gray, at Longbrush, near Kiama, on the night of Tuesday, the 28?h April, 1S68. '. The following is a condensed account of the evidence taken at the police court, Kiama, afc the investigation which extended over three separate court days. Mr. W. Roberts, Specially retained from Sydney, conducted the prosecution, and Mr. William Thurlow, the defence. Mr. John Gray's evidence waa to the effect that he had received' three anonymous threaten ing letters— the last thia year. He was at ' Kiama on Tuesday the 28th April last, aud left the Fermanagh Hotel about 10 o'clock at night. The moon was then within an hour of setting. He rode towards Longbrush. When near Mr. Connell's (the clerk of petty sessions) place, the horse swerved and reared ; and at the same in stant he saw a flash, heard a report, and then heard some one running away throvigh the bushes. He examined the saddle he was riding with, and found a ball had struck tha saddle tree, cutting the leather, leaving a leaden mark upon the saddle. He returned to Kiama at once and informed the police. ' _ Senior sergeant Johnston, of the Kiama po lice fomy, deposed that about 10 p.m. on the 28th April last, he heard the report of a gun. Shortly afterwards Mr. Gray arrived, and re ported fcftat he had been fired -at. Examined the saddle aud found the marks described. He proceeded at daybreak to the scene of the out rage, and found part of an envelope marked with gunpowder with part of the address legible, as under:—' Timms. . . ainter. . . iama.' The envelope appeared to have been used as wadding for firearms. Bengamin Timms, painter, of Kiama, remem bered Tuesday, the 28th April last. He was then iia the employ of Captain Charles, of Kiama. The prisoner M'Guckin now in charge was in the same employ. Witness slept in a loft over the milking shed. . M'Guckin some times came into the loft to have a chat. Re ceived the envelope referred to from Mrs. Bullen of Kiama, He did not know what became of the envelope. Did not know whether any body had picked it up. M'Guckin wanted to barrow his (witness's) horse to ride somewhere on the Saturday previous to the 2Sbh April last, but witness would not lend it Mrs. Bullen testified that the envelope referred to by last witness is in her handwriting. She distinctly recollected posting it to Mr. Timms in the month of April last. John Denuery, of Kiama, was passing across the cutting at Kiama between 8 and 9 p m., on the 2Sth April last. He saw three men together;' One had a gun. One was a short man ; the ^others were tall. Witness had since seen Lennard and M'Guekin, but could not identify them.. . ? On Saturday, last, the 6th August, the prison ers appeared before the Court pursuant to remand for the --third time. Mr. W. Roberts again ap pearing; for the prosecution, and Mr. Thurlow for the. prisoners, Mr. Roberts. informed the Bench that he was disappointed by reason of the non-arrival from ; Tam worth of a material' witness— a. commercial ' traveller-— who o'ugh'Vto have been in attendance ' at Court, this. day, 'to give evidence forthe Crown, ; and vyho, as he was .instructed, would be able to identify ali;.or some of the persons iii connection with this offence. : lii the abseiice of' that wit- ; ness it was impossible to prosecute the inquiry furtuerfat present. ,'- He-was therefore necessarily compelled to 'ask. for another remand for eight days, at, the.expi.ration'6'f wb'icli period unless .he had ?additional' evidence tpi'qffor on behalf of the Crown,' he (Mi*. Roberts) 'could then consent to the discharge, of the ' prisoners. If, however, their Worships .were not so disposed it was. very probable' frh'e* Go y eriimen t would institute f urthc- r inquiry, ' wit!r& view to the;' prosecution' ;6f * the offenders who', iiad sPmmitted the : diabolical act of attempting -to ^ake.the.ilife of a respectable and unoffending citizen.' ?;,.

''Everything being all right,' ' he strolled up the town just as the stars began ! to twinkle and dance merrily overhead, aud meeting a few friends Jem had a yarn ere he ws tired to rest. It was a bright and beautifefl moonlight night, though 'Jack Frost' was rather too persevering, when Jem the Caniae started for his camping ground, and ere &w; night had far advanced Jem was coiled up in las blankets, enjoying sweet, refreshing slumbaK. ' At the dead hour of night, ere Cooma had graft on. her mantle of white, Jem the Carrrier wofc» up, his thoughts tending towards his precurag ' billy,' which he was sure contained some «ff the best Tokay. Hark ! Some dreadful sonnda ? arrest his attention — from all parts of his dray there seem to be wrestling of evil ones, gnaBhloft of teeth, jwhile, as Jem says, above the din codS be heard a fast and furious chorus of deathly music, 'Crunching, munching, grunching, ' sank to this strange and weird tuns Jem kept tiaa* through dread. Our fnend's hair stood erecfes he lost all inclination for the soothing beverage contained in his burnt and blackened ' billy/9 and helplessly awaited the conflict with his ghastly enemy. With time he at last gaiuM courage, to rise, opened his trembling eyes, saa& made a minute but cautious inspection of tke dray, not forgetting to search the immediate vicinity of his whereabouts. All seemed wrappefi in sweet slumber ; the moon was shining brightly^ seeming to be the reigning power ; nought els© met his fearful gaze. He imagined he had beesa the victim of nightmare ; so he invoked tke powers of the soothing god of sleep, and went to bed. Again the horrible din — the gnashing aoi. wrestling — the 'Crunching, munching, grunt ing'- assailed his ears. Sleep he could not ; &« rose up. He went to the tail 'of his dray, liffcaS the tarpaulin, looked a1-, bis feed of hay, anfi seeing nothing there felt convinced his campii^ ground was the ghastly midnight walk of fckie perpetrator of some horrible tragedy. Daw foiebodings filled his heart ! He walked aboul to calm down his agitated fears, but the shaagp frosty nights of Manaro drove him very reluc tantly to his humble retreat— but there was no rest forhim. The noise had increased tenfo!^, and our hero, in order to shut out from his gaa« the sight of any apparition, covered hirnseH from head to foob with his blankets. Nearas and nearer came the dreadful sounds ; footsteps were heard ; but, above all, Jem couldn't stand! fche. music. He resolved to dress himself, arid procure :a stimulant to allay his shattered nerves* But; what sees he now ? Where he had left two propsfc'icks under the shafts, there are now six'! .Poor . Jem. now says he was ' nailefl to the spot — I couldn't stir for .all t&e; gold, in Australia I 1 thought it was the Foas vooted D ? 1 of Cooma coming to pay me a visit.' . He spent a full hall-hour contemplatiag ' the:'.' awful 'siitht, and he felt convinced he saw the cloven-foot. He shut his eyes ,in the hope that the apparition would melt away ; but th« 'host was inexorable. The cold sweat formed in big-drops; on the carrier's forehead, and he fervently prepared to wrestle with the evil one*. Oh~! -didnit -Join pray for dayligh!; ; the minutes seemed to him like days. — Davy here asked Jem i? he. had. hati a nobbier, and our friend said all he'ha'd was 'tvvu nips.'— What did you have for supper, Jem?'. ''.' Nothing but salt horsey d.-icnpcr,' anrlaipot of tea.'— 'Then it could nofc have Ueou nightmare.' 'You're poking borak novr, Davy ; did you ever hear of a cbap getting fche iiiyljtm ire on salfe. tack, and damper?' Even. Davy .was convinced ifc was a ghost 'all in white:' ' No,.'.s;iys,J~-irnrthe carrier, -'-I'm darned if it . was -t-he-riii-r}it'mare.' I mustered up all the coa nigy 1 hid remaining^ arid prepared to learn my face. 1 crawled up to-:the shaffc, notwithstand ing: that tue, horrible' noise 'still continued, and detdriniiied to have a good look at his sataniff h'ighnWy ir/en' .if. I died ' for it. .Then— — '-—? :' ?^.uv.iaertn.-r. say any' more,' interposed Dxvy-; .V-.he taiiished in ji iiame of blue fire, leaving be» hiiid.a sbi'ong sm/ill of sulphur and brimstone!.' .'iso,VL'm blovvedjf he did ; he stood there stock st'iL' -''..Id faith, whpse ghost w.i? it, then?*? inquired jDavy,' ail anxiety.
