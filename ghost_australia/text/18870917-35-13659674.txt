AMUSEMENTS. -as ? - THE ROYAL STANDARD THEATRE. I It speaks well for the good taste of Sydney theatre-goers that Shakespeare can be produced at three theatres simultaneously and with success. Notwithstanding the counter attraction in the very estimable representation of " Henry "V. at Her Majesty's and of " Romeo and Juliet " at the Criterion there was last evening a large and fashionable audienceattholloynl Standard Theatre, when Mr. Dampier's dramatic company appeared in the great play " Hamlet." Mr. Dampier's fine elocutionary powers found fitting opportunity for their display in the beautiful character of Hum lot, and it was brought before the house by that gentleman in such a way as to gain the approval of all who are acquainted with the play. The masterly speeches with which the part abounds were delivered by Mr. Dampier with vary fine effect, and he was heartily applauded, particularly for his rendering of Hamlet's soliloquy. As Ophelia, Miss Katherine Russell showed a large amount of that instinct which makes good actors, and played well enough to merit much commenda- tion, as she certainly was a fair share of applause. Mr. Alfred Boothman impersonated Laertes Mr. D. Marsh, Polonius and Mr. li. Holloway was the Ghost, and these as well as the many other characters were very well represented. The play was nicely staged, and everything harmonised to produce success. This closed the Dampier season at the Royal Standard. Air. Dampier has made arrangements to appear at the Gaiety Theatre on Saturday, 1st October.
