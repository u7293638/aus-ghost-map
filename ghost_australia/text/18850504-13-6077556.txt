The deputation of to day may consequently approach the J rcrsutoi with confidence that he will provide what ever funds may be necessary in order that the Melbourne professors may keep abreast of the work done in the scientific laboratories of the older universities that with regard to the future arrange ments of the ^^elbolllno school for language, we see no reason to alter the opinions we have already expressed Considering the present state of popular feeling in reference to classical studies it is a mistaken policy to propose the establishment of a new Greek chair the right course is to adhere for the present at all events, to the system of having but one classical pro fessor supplemented in case of necessity, by the appointment of an assistant lecturer Dr Mcmitisox opposes this idea on the grounds that a public teacher, not of professional status would always seaman of inferior attainments and that the council would be constantly exposed to pressure in order that the lectures might be raised to the rank of a chain As regards the second of these objections, it is specious but not necessarily sound J of the demonstrators in the scientific laboratories will occupy sub 01 dmate positions of au exactly analogous kind, and yet, in then ease, the dreaded pressure is regarded as too is probable to require the consideration of the council As to the former, the passing of the University of Melbourne do not require the services of a man of brilliant scholar ship More over, experience is opposed to Dr Morrison's mow in the adversities of Scotland, for example, nothing is more common than to find professors of Humanity with assistants, and in the case of Mr T A Smee, the alleged " inferiority ' of attainments did not prevent his ultimate promotion to the chair of classics 111 the I University of Melbourne There is quite a different view however, which may be suggested for consideration Why in such a connexion should the council persist in ignoring the existence of their own young graduates When the Queens Colleges were established in Ireland, an order of senior scholarships was instituted, tenable for 1 one year after " A , degree Those school wish s were confined to the distinguished gi actuates of the several colleges and were awarded on the condition that their holders should act if required, as assistants to the pi fessor s Is there any reason why this idea should not be so modified as to make it applicable to local conditions I It would not be difficult to offer other an I equally practical suggestions for meeting the contingency that the university professor of classics may require help It appeals to us, therefore, that so far as the rearrangement of work in the classical school is gone el ned the scheme of the council ought to be remitted to them for consideration to the point raised) discussed might be added also the question of the late of returned t tion that ought to be attached to the proposed lectureships 111
