Notes. Father Watsford is once again in Sydney. Fifty seven years ago he went forth from Sydney as a Missionary Minister of the Gospel of Jesus, His vitality to- day is wonderful. Anxious to have one more opportunity of preach, ing Christ to the masses of Sydney, at his suggestion, and that of Mr. O'Donnell, a ' Ten Days' Mission to the Citizens of Sydney ' commences in the Centenary Hall on Sunday. This is not a C.M M. Mission, but one in which it is hoped that ministers of all circuits and of all churches will unite. We want to see a great outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon the unsaved of this city. Will everybody unite with us to this end ? Careful arrangements are being made to con serve the results of the Mission, and each minister will receive the names and addresses of any enquirers who may reside in their districts. Oh, for a mighty baptism of saving grace ! ! Our readers are directed to the business columns of this issue for details as to meetings. * # * We very specially emphasise the Mid- day Meetings for business men and women, to be held daily from 1 to 2 o'clock. Many, unable to attend other services, might come to these. ♦ * ♦ The Sacred Oratoria, ' The Captives of Babylon,' last week rendered in the Hall, was a marked success everyway. We are sorry that pressure upon our space forbids details. We have the hope that at an early date we may be treated to a repetition. In the mean time choir masters might do worse than obtain copies of this new musical work from our Book Depot.
