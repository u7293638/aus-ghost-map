A GourtYooN SUICRE. Ho was down on his luck and his spirits wore low, Ho had hunted in vain for the ghost of a show; His poolkets weor empty, his credit all done, And he thought there was nothing to do but to run. He had tried pioture-eolling and found it a sham, And sowing-machines wouldn't keep him in Jam.; Insurance was empty, family bibles wore bare, And nobody wanted some stuff for their hair. Portrait-enlarging he'd played out before; When hbe showed fancy soaps he was shown a shut door; Ris furniture polish no one nasked to son, He was quietly told not to bring out his tea. He knew he was done and that things wouldn't mend, And he thought of self-slaughter his troubles to end; But he wanted a plan that would thoroughly suit, So he opened a shop in whioh to sell fruit.
