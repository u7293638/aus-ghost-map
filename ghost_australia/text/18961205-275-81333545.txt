A TRUE GHOST STORY. A weird story of the appearance of a ghost at Brighton reaches us from Mr, Thomas Lucas Smith, who writes as follows to tho London Telegraph from Mansion House Chambers, E.G.:â€” "On Thursday I was stopping at the house of a friend at Brighton, and, having remained up reading for some time after the family had gone to bed, I at last, it being nearly twelve, prepared to retire to rest. In going upstairs I seemed to catch a glimpse of a patch of moonlight on a wall by the window on the second landing. As I knew nearer, to my utter astonishment this gradually took the shape of a woman! The ghostly nature of this form was apparent, for the wall was clearly visible through the figure, The shape was that of a woman of about thirty, tall, well-formed, and clothed in some plain garment, which might have been a shroud, She was gazing earnestly into the grounds through the window, a very expression upon her face Suddenly she gave a deep sigh of such utter lament that it startled me more than even the first sight of the apparition. Then her form grow indistinct, and in a few seconds vanished. I examined the wall, but found no trace of anything abnor- mal. In the morning I related the strange adventure to my host, who was remarkably upset at my narrative. At his request I refrain from naming the precise house, as the property is for sale and publicity might do it harm. He stated there was a family secret he could not reveal, and contented himself by asking me to inspect a certain picture in his possession. I was as- tounded to find the ghost and this portrait to exactly tally. The latter must have been at least 70 years old. I await an 'explanation' from those scientist and conjurors who laugh at spiritualism. I know that my experi- ence is real."
