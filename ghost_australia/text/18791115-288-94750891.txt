CLARENDON. November 11. Yesterday, about 4 p.m., we were visited by one of the severest storms of the season. There were sheets of rain and hail, accompanied by a tremendous hurricane of wind. The oldest in habitant here has never known anything to equal the storm, and those from town who had vea tured into the hills in summer costume for a daj's pleasure will long remember it. It has been raining heavily at times during to-day. If the rain continues it will seriously injure the hay harvest. Some few farmers have commenced carting and stacking. I regret there is not a rain guage in this township, as it would be in teresting to know the rainfall. — The North Adelaide Cricket Club sent a team here on Monday to try conclusions with some of our local knights of the willow; but the storm in terfered with the game, which terminated Abruptly. As far as it went our men had not a ghost of a chance of winning. — The telegraph line was broken and blown down by the force of the gale, and at the time of writing communica tion is interrupted between here and Adelaide.
