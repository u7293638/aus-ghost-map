OUR BERLIN LETTER. » BERLIN, Feb. 16. I Scarcely a year has elapsed since Germany celebrated the 25th jubilee of her victories over the French, and again Emperor and empire are preparing themselves for a much grander jubilee, namely for the celebration of the centenary of the birth of the founder of the new German empire, William the Great as he is now styled here We know what a predilection the present Emperor has for court pomp and magnificence, he also likes to bring to outward expression the imposing loftiness of his position as sovereign by God's grace But at the impending celebration, Ins really unbounded love and veneration for his departed grandfather is the moving power in whom he sees the embodi- ment of ill virtues as sovereign, and, above all, as Soldier Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that one wishes hero in Berlin to make the festivities as grand as possible In this respect this jubilee will greatly differ from that of the Queen The aged Sovereign of Great Britain, as known, intimated the wish that all the money intended for illuminations, decorations, and festivities of all sorts should rather be devoted to charitable purposes Up till now nothing has been heard of similar intentions prevailing here On the contrary, the Berlin Town Council has voted XCÖ00 for the decorations of the via triumphant alone, a distance of about half a mile from the old Emperor's palace Unter den Linden, up to the square in front of the royal castle, where the unveiling of the Emperor William monument is to take place A similar sum is to be spent on other decorative purposes It was to be foreseen that the social democrats would not let this opportunity pass without again giving vent to their hatred of the dynasty and government At the sitting of the town council in which the granting of the above mentioned £5000 was proposed, the socialistic members protested most i vehemently against it But I am sorry to say they went too far in their protest Instead of being satisfied with only pointing to the fact that this sum would be better charitably kid out, which doubtless had also been more in the spirit of the old Emperor, whose simplicity and modesty were almost proverbial, they protested against any sort of celebration in honour of a man is he had so much oppressed the Socialists, and under whose rule the Socialist law had brought great misery into to many families Tram a constitutional stand- point this attitude of the Socialists can absolutely not be approved of Not the monarch but his Government is according to the Constitution to be made responsible and as regards old Emperor William, ON cry child here knows what unlimited influence Prince Bismarck possessed during the last years of the old Emperor's life, and Son the latter did all that the iron Chancellor wished One may imagine how enraged the Emperor is at the social demo ents, who already in the year 1895 aroused his anger by their keeping aloof from the festivities in memory of the German victories One | will recollect the sensational speech made by the young Emperor on Sedan day, when he stigmatised the social democrats as " the rabble of men, not worthy to bear the name of Germans " Also how, when the Emperor thanked the town council for their congratulations on his birthday, he expressed the hope that the whole population of Berlin would take part in the centre uary festivities, and not let itself be led astray by the aberrations and infatuation of certain people I am afraid that the Imperial WISH. US far as the Socialists are concerned will not be realised The great attraction of the festivities will be the unveiling of the Emperor William monument, which will stand opposite to the old castle The history of this monument is also significant The Reichstag ga. of the money, and had to examine all the designs, all artists having been invited to take part in this competition But finally the Emperor commissioned Reinhold Regis, who is a great favourite of his, to execute this great piece of work, and in order to prevent further differences of opinion arising in questions of artistic taste between the Emperor and the Reichstag, the latter decided to leave all details, excepting the money question, to the Emperor This little episode was much discussed at the time, so also was the statement that it was originally intended to place on the scene of the monument an allegory of Numurkah suffrage, a female figure with a ballot-box, but that for different reasons this located to be abandoned At the unveiling of the monument that man will be conspicuous by his absence to whom the old Emperor is most indebted for his name, " William the Great," namely, Prince Bismarck The grand old man in the Sachsenwald, who in a few weeks will have completed his 84th year, is, it is true, physically in pretty good health, but, as he him self lately said, he has lost all pleasure in life When he was at the zenith of his fame in the beginning of the seventies he said that the ideal of his life had always been to lead a comfortable life as gentleman farmer I am sure he was not quite in earnest when he made this remark, for he knew quite well that the old Emperor would never have accepted his resignation This is as perhaps also one of the reasons of hy ho so often sent it in He has now got his alleged ideal, and it does not satisfy him either He certainly attributes this to his no longer being able as in former years to ride, hunt, and scramble through the bushes, but I think he deceives himself when asserting this The i ox popula has not given him the name of Iron Chancellor for nothing Prince Bismarck was born to rule and to fight, he is then in his element Now he is condemned to sit still and he can't stand this it makes him melancholy Herein he differs, much to his detriment, from the Grand Old Man of England Mr Gladstone has, his whole life, not only occupied himself with politics but with literature and science he is not only a states man but a man of learning, and when nature claimed her lights, and he felt the burdens of old age, he withdrew himself joyfully from acts of politics to live only for his studies, which fully satisfy him But Bismarck never had a taste for anything but politics He visited no theatres, no concerts, no lectures IIB do owed his whole life solely to the service of the father- land He has therefore now nothing which might give him occupation and amuBO mont In latter years his combative nature came to drastic expression in the publi- costs) fights in his Hamburg urged against his successors Then followed the reconciliation with the Emperor, which, however, on the part of Bismarck and his friends was never regarded as more than an act of formality But a few weeks ago the relations between Berlin and Fnednohs rub became strained afresh in consequence of the indiscreet disclosures which Prince Bismarck made about the secret Rusao German alliance which was concluded 10 years ago These disclosures made, as is known, had blood in Austria, where one considered the the ity to have been treachery, and Emperor William was exceedingly angry about Bismarck This is another reason why the Prince will not come to Berlin to the centenary festivities, where, in spite of all, he would most certainly have received a most enthusiastic reception Of the great leaders of the glorious days of 1870 only the King of Saxony and old Field Marshal Blumenthal are still living, and it is to be foreseen that at the impending festivities both personages will be specially honoured, it being a well-known thing that when it is a question of honouring anybody the Emperor is very inven- tive At court even the charm all of this year is under the sign of the fashions of 1797, the year when old Emperor William was born They are now getting ready at court for a great fancy-dress ball, at which everybody must appear in costumes as worn at the Berlin court in 1797 The indispensable condition for the costumes of all participators in the ball on the 14th of February is that they are to be historically true It was by no means easy to find out what the court dress was in the year 1797. There are not so many reliable costume pictures of that year For instance, the Empress's costume had already been trimmed with painted ribbons But the wicked artistic taste, and coolly and severely declared that Goethe composed his Verses Little flowers, little leaves " as a dedication with a painted ribbon, somewhat earlier than a century ago In 1797 the painted ribbons, which have lately come into fashion again, were already extremely old fashioned, and thus the fate of the Empress's costume, and with it those of many other ladies of court society who wished to shine with their painted ribbons, was sealed Thus in the eleventh hour something else had to be thought out The younger ladies are no better off Their costumes are also for the most part finished,' or at any rate half so All of them are very magnificent, the stuffs and colours being chosen with the greatest care The young ladies of court society were to danced a gavotte in them before the Imperial couple But all at once serious scruples have arisen, so that the brilliant picture which the gavotte, according to the arranger's ideas, was to present will, as things now stand, most likely come to nothing for it has been found out that the fashions of 1797 did not permit young ladies to appear at the Berlin court in anything but thin w late muslin frocks What a hitler drop in their cup of joy How much better off are the gentlemen For the greater part of them it is a perfectly settled affair from the beginning what they have to wear The Emperor will presumably don the uniform of the 1st Foot Guards of that time, the officers the costumes of the regiments in which they now stand, the court dignitaries the costume of the office they hold, for Court dress of the period Prince Henry, it is said, will appear in the uniform of the Brunswick Dragoons It has cost a deal of trouble to make the police president Herr von Windhoim's uniform 100 years younger. But this has been effected by the discovery at the last moment in the Royal castle of a picture of the police president of 1797 The young lieutenants face the best Their uniforms of 1797 do not cost them a penny By the munificence of the Emperor they receive them gratis, they afterwards being returned and given to the Royal theatres Also another jubilee is looked forward to here with the greatest interest namely, the longest reign jubilee of the Queen. The number of English living in] Germany can be reckoned by the thousand, and almost as great a number of Englishwomen have married Germans here The Princess of Pleas, nee Daisy Cornwallis West, one of the most beautiful women in Berlin Court society, has sent printed letters to all these English- women, high and low, in which she begs for subscriptions towards a charitable fund to commemorate the Queen's jubilee. A book containing the signatures, maiden names, professions, and titles of all the donors is to be handed tribe Queen with the subscribed Sum Will the Emperor attend the jubilee festivities in London or not. This is the question which is much ventilated in political circles here, for it is not to be denied that this visit is more than a family affair , it is also of political importance Of course of anything depends in the first place whether the Queen on account of her great age has not altogether decided to celebrate her jubilee quite quietly and in retirement Then 1 visit of Emperor William would be out of the question, for even if he is the grandson of the Queen, he does not quite lot one forgot that he is Emperor, and this always makes certain ceremonials and representative obligations necessary which would scarcely be in unison with the retirement in which the Queen lives But if the Queen has made up her mind to celebrate her jubilee in a festal manner, the Emperor would most probably go to England, that is to say, if the Anglo-German relations have not become any worse than they are already. One would scarcely think it possible that the anti-English feelings here could have so spread and gained in intensity in such a short space of time. The old sores of the Transvaal dispute are not yet settled on the contrary, the present Parliamentary inquiry in the House of Commons and Mr Chamberlain's speech have fanned afresh the old quarrel The Germans, it is true, assert that they only wished the South African Republic to remain as it now is, and had no intention what ever of bringing the country under their influence but in reality one must reckon with the Chauvinism of the German colonial party, who think that the sooner they gain a firm footing in South Africa the better The strained relations between Germany and England make it, of course, easier for Russia to carry on her expansion policy in East Asia and on the Balkan Peninsula, for in both questions can Russia reckon upon Germany's support This is loss the case as regards Egypt A support any part of Germany would, of course, only benefit France, and this can naturally not be in Germany's interest One knows here full well that the French will never give up the hopes of regaining Alsace-Lorraine, and no German Government would be so foolish as to strengthen the sure foe On the other hand, German policy would not mind England being entangled in difficulties with France about Egypt, just as she has to reckon with Russia in Turkey and Eastern Asia By this the French are diverted from Alsace Lorraine, Russia is also occupied, and England cannot proceed against the South African Republic with that energy she would develop under normal circumstances The English statesmen perfectly know the plans and aims of German policy, and it appears therefore, for political reasons, doubtful whether the Emperor will go to England to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, although he personally is Hard to be inclined to do so, and wish to take the Empress and the two eldest princes with him One must not forget that the Emperor is personally a great friend of England, especially of English customs and sports, and that it was really a sacrifice to him not to be able to attend the Cowes Regatta last! year But in politics personal sympathies or antipathies do not count, and therefore the matter about the Emperor's journey is not yet settled in the meantime England makes pacific con quests in Germany, if even only on the stage After " My Official TV He," now also " Trilby " has been arranged for the German stage The severe Berlin critics could not find words strong enough for condemning Du Maurier's novel and the piece made from it, but yet it has not failed in its great effect upon the masses Next month the greatest German actor of the present day, Mittcrwur7or, will come from Vienna to play here the part of Svengali in " Trilby, ' which suits his whole individuality as excellently as if the part had been written expressly for him, and one may foresee quite an extraordinary success. The theatrical events, however, of this season were the production of Gerhard Hauptmann's " Die Versunkene Glocke " (The Sunk Ball) and Ibsen's " John Gabriel Borkuann " As regards the former, it achieved a success more brilliant than any other piece by that famous German author but Ibsen's newest work by no means came up to expectations As regards dramatical effect, it is far behind " The Ghosts," or " Rosmerholm," or "The Wild Duck," but is certainly better than " Little Eyolf " or Master builder Solness " A" SPOTLESS COMPLEXION Sulpholine Lotion clears off all imperfections, Eruptions, Pimples Blotches Eczema, Psoriasis and irritating SLID Disfigurements Shilling bottles of faulpholioe-tho Ln(,lit]i Lotion - [ADVT n There is a vacant chair in mont household which might still have held its loved occupant had good judgment been exercised when the first symptoms of illness were noticed leaving the wrong medicine at the right time is reap marble for much of this trouble Minerva Tonic is always a good medicine and always to be depended on -[AnvT 1
