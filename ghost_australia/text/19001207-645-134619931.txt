Jlfnirjimuiy. December 3. Harvest operations are in full swing around {it re, and as a rule the stripping is turning out very well, the yields being fully what was expected. Messrs. Houston, Lyons and Cook are re ported to be getting from 4& to 0 bags, while ?others along the stock route south are of ?equal yield. I heard that at Smeaton Farm, the pro perty of Mr. Jas. Cook, the crop there was going over 6} bags. This is what is known as the improved purple straw, a similar kind to that of Mr. M'Artbur's on South Coree. The yield is in many ways satisfactory, especially to some of the bachelor farmers hi re, for it ib said to be on the tapis that some of them are thinking of joining the benedict ranks. It is aleo whispered that the Boors (spell it with an 'o,' Mr. Editor, to distinguish them from the South Africans) Are getting tbe musical tin kettles ready for tbe occasions. There is said to be a ghost prowling round this part. I hear one went round to a neighbor's a few nk'hts ago where there were a few little children and two grown-up daughters, the mala members buing absent. The disappearing trick was nevtr more quickly accomplished on the sight of a shot gun. One of the daughters was going to snipe at the ' Boor' ghost, but it vanished before the bead could be drawn on it. The weather is all that could bedeBked for harvesting. We are all pleased to bear that ' Our Ben' purposes to keep on this line. He is a great . favorite with all, especially the ladieB.
