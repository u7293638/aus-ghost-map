whose portrait we present, has been but a little svbile aesociAteJ with theatrical management, Still he has bad sufficient time to display, in a marked degree, juet those qualities which go far to make a successful manager — tact, pluck, and perse verance. Opening at oor Theatre Royal to fair business with " The Enemy' Camp," Mr. Westmacott bad to etand the brant of nn ungQccessfol time with 41 Sous of Erin " — a run of ill-luck that would have eoverely bent, if it had not utterly broken, the hearts of many managers. Undeterred, however, by this adverse experience, our yonng manager pinokily determined on a revival of " The Silver King." It ib no " gag " to say that no expense was spared in either Bcencry, mount ing, or cast. Mr. Elton wae specially engaged to play Jaikes, and the whole result is a success that hae exceeded even Mr. TYefltmatott'e expectations, and has not only recouped him his previous losses, but will materially augment his banking account at the close of his season. Through all his troubles Mr. 'Westmacott " bore himself like a man," and 41 fought fortune with bold front." H1e company will tell yon tbat his courtesy aud consideration never failed, and that not fcr a moment was there a doubt among them as to the 44 walking of the ghost." Other managers than Mr. Westmacott hate had private fortDDes, but it is not every one of these who would have unhesitatingly dipped deeply therein to make good managerial losses. At the cloBe of his Royal season Mr. Westmacott "rests " for two or three months pending the arrival of some of the i&teet; London successes, the Australian rights of which he has eeoured. His friends, 44 whose name is legion," will wish him tho best of luck wherever he may be. MR. C. B. WESTMACOTT,
