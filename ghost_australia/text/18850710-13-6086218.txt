ARRIVAL Li.' 'i'lIV ENGLISH MAIL. The Orient Ti A. S Iberia, which arrived yesterday, has brought London correspondence and papers to June 5 We append portions of our letters - TOPICS OF THE WEEK (1 love Quit ConnisiONDtsr) LONDON, June 5 The Afghan question is believed to be settled 1 hat is to say, that the boundary traced in London between the representative of our Government and M do State and M Lesser for Russia, has been accepted by the Czar and his Ministers subject to a reference of details to a joint commission working on the spot This important announcement were made on Saturday, morning by the Daily News with agitate fanfaronnade on the skill and wisdom of the British Cabinet It was consequently somewhat curious on Monday to read in the same journal a letter from the private secretary of Lord Granville saying that the negotiations were not concluded, but were still going on But the Daily A rim was ready with a plausible explanation and there is indeed no reason to doubt that although a final settlement has not been reached, for the reason that the joint commission has not yet been able to do its part of the work a substantial agreement has been ii in oil at the hue adopted is that which M Lesser first proposed, subject only to a slight variation in favour of Afghanistan in the neighbourhood of the Zulficar Pass the pass itself being given to the Ameer Penjdeh, on the other hand goes to Russia, and with it the whole of the basis of that name up to Merucha! which town, however is an Killed in Aicjinii winter) If this settlement which concedes to the Czar all that the Czar wanted, is to be considered a triumph for the British Cabinet then indeed Liberal journalists are thankful for cases ling) small men Yes, but, admitting the achievement it is clear that every thing has not yet been arranged Sir Peter Lumsden, who have reached Vienna on her way to London, thinks very poorly) of the new frontier He lays it down, if we may trust the correspondents who have seen him at Constantinople and elsewhere that safety would have been better secured it the desert line from 1 ul i Klintun to arrival had been taken, and he looks for fresh trouble at an early) day) It is quite possible, indeed, that Russia may prolong the law tracing of the frontier over seven years since it is her name to find his occupation in this remote region in order to divert attention from more serious designs she has in hand on the Bosphorus In our Bounce of this policy), she may indeed soon be found advancing down the Murglnib A alle) It may be said here that the opinion of Sir P Lumsden on this matter is widely shared by) competent authorities and as the British Commissioner is understood to have put his views into some very vigorously written despatches, we are bound to hear more of this aspect of the question Meantime, the public are asking "But what about the arbitration What indeed ' When the House of Commons re-assembled last night a question was promptly put to Mr. Gladstone on this subject The Prime Minister has deterred his answer until to day) It is understood that he himself is hoping to get the arbitration carried through, and having failed to get the Czar s assent to the appointment of the Emperor of Germany, he will be content with the opinion which the King of Denmark the father in law of the Czar would give on the subject Spite of all that has been set since the up pearance of the recent Blue Book as to the non existence of the sacred covenant, ' Mr Gladstone adheres to the accuracy of his statement of the 13th March He went into the matter by way of explanation last night, and showed how, on the 15th February, bir L. Thornton reported in observa- tion of M de Giers that instructions had been given that the Russian soldiers should remain where they were This isolated observation, dug from the depths of the Blue Book, was held up as justifying the very precise and particular declaration made in the middle of a serious crisis nearly a month later that Russia on the one side, and Great Britain on the other, hand formally come to an arrangement that the opposing forces should not make any further advance one way or the other Of course, the explanation of the Prime Minister has been received with scorn, and the sacred covenant" is, if possible, in worse repute than it was before. Mr Gladstone is clearly in a difficulty, and it would appear that, having floundered badly, he is prepared to bluster the thing through, and to see the arbitration afloat at all hazards This, however, is not the temper of his colleagues, and once the settlement of the frontier 13 accomplished opportunity would no doubt be taken by the majority of the Cabinet to draw Mr Glad stone from dangerous ground So far, at any rate, the Czar has shown small inclina- tion to allow arbitration to go on, and the statement to be made in Parliament this after noon will only surprise us if it exhibits the subject in any state of vitality whatever the latest Blue Book on the Central Asian question deals with the Penjdeh incident in detail It does not, however, add greatly to our knowledge It would appear that the name of the emperor of Germany had been mentioned as a possible arbitrator, but nothing had been arranged when the correspondence closed. The unhappy incident ' placed Lord Granville in possession of an exceedingly, strong case, which he argued with singular skill and ability, but, as one bomb not infrequently in the law courts, the verdict did not follow the argument On the other hand, Russia, by putting forward accom placed facts, met Lord Granville successful. of the very points where the pleas of the British Minister justified his triumph Meanwhile, and in spite of all the talk of peace, the preparations for war go forward The Guards are for the moment to be kept in Lg) pit, so are other troops released from the Eastern Soudan Here we are to have more than one naval demonstration Admiral Hornby's fleet 13 to be the most formidable ever placed in the hands of one commander But it will not exhaust the capacities of the Admiralty We have heard much of late of the arming of fast merchantmen as cruisers Some half dozen of the fastest ships afloat were recently taken over by the Government in view of war, which was then probable It is understood that but one of these vessels, built to satisfy the Admiralty) requirements in regard to cruisers has received her armament, but so much having been done, it has been determined to , test, the qualities of this new engine of vi warfare, and in a few days Admiral Hoskins will hoist his line, on the vessel, and put her through a series of experiments in which he will have the co-operation of certain of the ordinary vessels of the Royal Navy A more interesting, scheme than this could hardly be conceived, and that it should have arisen out of the late Beare 18 another illustration that it is an ill wind that blows no good But other benefits are likely to from recent events the shortcomings of the Navy will, in certain cases be remedied and we may look for a great improvement in the armament of vessels, further we hear of the initiation of an elaborate scheme of coast defence and the formation of submarine mining companies at Cardiff Glasgow, Liverpool Newcastle and Hull All this is pure tain and although a great portion of the vote of credit has been sunk 111 Egyptian i sunk without result-we may yet have reason for some cc event with what has happened 'The attitude of Prince Bismarck towards Great Britain on this and other questions is matter of interesting speculation here Those who are able to speak on the subject with some confidence tell us that the German Chancellor has a score to settle alike with the Queen, who takes no pains to con coal that she dislikes him, and with the Crown Princess of German who only told rated him Again, his antipathy to Mr Gladstone is such as to carry him far The British Premier, with all his faults is the one statesman old troops who has refused to bow the knee to the autocrat of Ben Fri When he was in opposition Mr Gladstone went further, and it is said that since his accession to office in 1890 be has not hesitated to thwart the designs of Prince Bismarck in more than one important project If report is true, Prince Bismarck took occasion after the death of the late Prince of Orange to sound the British Government as to the ultimate annexation and absorption by Ger- many of Holland It is declared that the Chancellor found his ideas uneere monioual) rejected Further there is the notion, which is said to be very vide) an pressed upon Prince Bismarck, that some day possibly at no great distance he will have to confront the possibility of war with Russia. To embroil us with that power would merely put off the evil hour, since Russia would not care within a short period to again put on her armour in opposition to a leading power Meantime the great man thinks it wise to conciliate France, so that if a Russian vi ever becomes mev stable, he may not be in danger of being taken upon both Banks at once. These and such considerations are said to haunt the brain of Prince Bismarck, has it is the force of thee oniiRideiatioiis which leads him to oppose Great Britain w whenever und w here or he may) find her The lesson ought to be taken to heart by) English politicians there is not much to report in regard to (-3pt, save that the powers are still call counting upon our soil) withdrawal, and are laying their plans accordingly) We hear, indeed, talk of the restoration of Ismail, but this is nothing new The ex Khedive were for along time carried on a very active propaganda in his own interest, and as he has more to command the support of Continent politicians and journalists it would be surprising if he did not on occasion make a son One thing however, stands in his way the resolution of the British Government and people to have nothing whatever to do with him Meantime the evacuation of the Soudan goes on merrily The natural result in following The Mahdi's friends have taken possession of Korea, and threaten to advance on Dongola and on the other side of the country Osman Digna is dead) growing more influential and bolder It is said that the unpaid portion of the Suakin Berber railway is to be given to the Government of Cyprus. From the province of Dongola the (light n northward continues and it is said that more than 5,000 persons have arrived in Lower 1 gr pt For the moment these people are being assisted from the British stores on the line of route, but hereafter they must become a serious change upon the Egyptian I re issues It may be said here that the liner eral embarrassments of the Khedive have become less pressing, and that the convention which is to give him the benefit ota I urge loan, is now in a fair way for becoming a reality It has passed the French Chamber, and has been sent to the Senate for consideration As I write Ministers are assembled in Cabinet Council, the first since the very serious quarrel, of which mention was made last week There is a good deal of curiosity, and not a 1 little apprehension, among Liberals as to the issue If we were not perfectly aware that the Irish question is to come up for consideration, the fact that Lord Spencer has specially come from Dublin to join his colleagues would be sufficient evidence of the fact The question then arises Is there to be a split over the renewal of the Crimes Act' that there will be sharp difference of opinion is certain, but it is doubtful it there will be any open dissensions It has latterly become known to the Radical wing of the Cabinet that other and if real considerations had come into view since the) made the demonstration a fortnight ago These considerations are altogether unfavourable to their views The Opposition have allowed their hand to be seen and their attitude upon this question is indeed far more important than that of Sir Chas. Dilke and his allies If Messrs Dilke and Chamberlain, with Mr Shaw Lefevre, left the Government, the new Coercion Bill would pass providing the Opposition supported it It has already been said thattheRadical Mimstcrsdesircthat the bill, reduced to the smallest limits, should be enacted for 12 months, and that the Irish Local Government Bill should be the first measure of next session They propose, then that, after the passing of this great reform, Ireland should be left under the operation of the ordinary law But it is already understood that the Conservatives will not consent to this arrangement, and that the Government have to choose between several difficulties of which the loss of Messrs Dilke and Chamberlain is not the greatest Without the support of the regular Opposition, the Government can in this matter do nothing with that aid they are secure against all corners. 'This is the overpowering consideration of the moment, and it must have weight with the Radical malcontents in the Cabinet 'they know, or ought to know, that to propose a coercion bill for 12 months will lead the Opposition to a hostile division on the second reading, and, as a consequence, to the prompt rejection of the measure The Conservative party look to a success at the polls, and naturally they do not wish to find the early days of their administration-if they should come into power blighted by the necessity of discussing a fresh penal code for Ireland One would think that the same consideration had weight with the Radicals, who look as hopefully to the future , but it is not so On the other hand, they are bound to recognise the fact, now perfectly clear, that it will be easier for the Government to renew the Crimes Act for a term of years, even with Borne necessary reconstruction of the Cabinet, than to carry a 12 months bill as a united Government And this may be expected to have its due weight in restraining a defection from the Government. The Liberal party is not less in difficulty on this subject than the Government itself. The Ulster Whites have gone over bodily to the Parnellites and the opposition to the Co erosion Act will have further support from the Radicals At first of all, the LulJisIi Vi Inga are becoming uneasy, and yesterday Mr Heneage gave notice of a motion, which, if adopted, would take the application of the act out of the hands of the Lord Lieutenant and put it into those of a committee of the Cabinet Mr M'Coan, on the other hand, is for making the act of universal application throughout the three kingdoms Neither of these propositions has a ghost of a chance of becoming law The week has been marked by a full proportion of important political speeches The adjective does not apply to the mild and ineffective rhetoric of Sir S Northcote in North Devon, but to the deliverances of Lord R Churchill, Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan Early in the week the J ima had published a notable letter from Mr Bartle), who has lately retired from the post of chief wire puller of the Conservative party Mr Hartley has had a disappointment, and he according revenges himself upon his friends by holding them up to the country as without a policy, and, in brief us without a rag to cover their political nakedness Lord R Churchill made this letter the text of an interesting speech at Bow on Wednesday night He vigorously denied the imputation that the Conservatives were without a policy, and proceeded to sketch one on the spot According to Lord Randolph, he is prepared to outbid the Radicals in regard to domestic legislation being in favour of a sweeping reform of local government alike in 1 Island, Ireland, and in London whilst he would in mire into our fiscal policy with a view of removing- the depression in trade and more vigorous naval station at) the administration and expenditure of every department of Government On foreign policy) of course Lord II Church hill diverges absolutely from his opponents and he re we need not follow him But, he added I that granting- all that was said of the Conservatives they would if they had no polic) 1 c in no worse case than the Ruheals The present Government had, within the period of their existence c extra bited no less than 27 policies 10 in relation to Ireland 18 in regard to 1 (yet, and I) on the Central Asian question He argued that this was much worse than being without a policy, and with much skill and humour set out the successive phases through which the Government had passed the speech altogether was one of the best which the young Conservative leader has delivered and if speeches could do anything against Mr Gladstone, ought to laugh him out of office. Unhappily) for the country and the Empire, this is not likely The Prime Minister, with the caucus at his back, is perfectly secure, and his individuality is so powerfully) mi presses upon the imagination of the people that he may do any thing with perfect assurance that the Liberals will not desert him to return to Mr Chamberlain's appearance at Birmingham, it was remarkable to observe with what freedom he spoke of the attitude of a constitutional Government in regard to coercion He, however allowed it to be clearly perceived that the question of local government for Ireland must stand over to the new Parliamentary indication, as it would seem, that he was preparing to put himself in line with the W legs of the Cabinet Upon foreign affairs he was less emphatic, but his remarks upon Egypt in which he warned France that her attitude was calculated to frustrate her own desire to see the evacuation of that country by Great Britain were notable as confirming the general opinion that Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke have always been in favour of an energetic policy in the Nile v they Of Mr Travel) and speeches, it need only be said that they were cast in the true official vein, that they were admirable as literary com- positions, but that they failed, in go " and vigour Lord Hartington s illness at Dublin, which caused so much disappointment to the Liberals of Ulster, was happily of short duration, and he returned to London on Saturday night Mr Healy), speaking at Belfast, declared that the noble lord had no other ornament than a diplomatic cold," insinuating, of course, that the dissensions among the Cabinet made it inconvenient that he should deliver an address at that particular juncture. Belfast may be congratulated that Mr Healy was good enough to supply the place of the noble marquis, since he told us certain things in regard to the policy of the Parnellites at the general election, which it is well that the country should appreciate Above all, he confirmed the statement of the Standard, that, in the hope of controlling Parliament after the election the Irish voters throughout the three kingdoms would be naked in default of candidates of their own to support the Conservatives This it is be he ved will effectually!) prevent a strong Liberal majority, and give Mr Parnell the opportunity of arranging his account as it may suit him At Limerick, where the union presided, and Mr Wm Redmond was the chief orator, mottoes ' were exhibited wishing long life to the Mahdi, and asking for cheers for Koinarotr The trial! of the man Sheehan, brought from New Zealand on suspicion of murdering his mother, brother, and sister, by throwing their bodies into a deep well Some eight years ago, has begun at Castletown The evidence against accused is of much gray it) Mr Richard Chamberlain, who is an older man of Birmingham, and who will be remembered in Australia, has given mortal offence to the teetotalers of his district by attending to the United Kingdom Alliance as an in temperate movement The expression was dropped on the occasion of the opening of a temperance hotel, and such was the annoyance which it caused that the matter is to be pursued in a fashion hostile to Mr Chamberlain during his parliamentary contest in Islington The Chamberlain Brothers have a rare knack of making themselves disliked b) indiscretions in speech Lord Harris has reopened the discussion concerning unfair bowling in cricket Going to Manchester the other day to lead Kent against Lancashire, he found Crossland and Nash still engaged in the I Lancashire team After a very close fight Kent were defeated, and Lord Horns now comes forward to say that, so far as his influence goes, Kent shall not again play Lancashire He declares that he will obtain the cancelling of the return fixtures between the clubs, and he generally calls upon Lancashire to purge themselves of the imputation v ei) widely allegedagainstthem that the) knowing) encouraged unfair bowling So far the Lancashire captain has made no reply, but it is perfectly well understood that he takes his stand upon the laws of the game, which place the responsibility of Baying what is fair or unfair bowling upon the umpires, and until the umpires declare against his men, Mr Hornby will decline to dismiss them Technically and legally Mr Hornby is unanswerable, but southern cricketers, at any rate, are inclined to side with Notts and Kent both of whom have now struck Lancashire of their list of playing clubs The development of this interesting controversy will be keenly followed by lovers of the national game here as in Aub t ral in The Coleridge libel case is again before the public, on appeal of the plaintiff-Mr Adams against the singular proceedings of Mr Justice Manisty), who reversed the verdict of the jury trying the plaintiff substantial damages Mr Justice Manisty held that the actual libel was privileged, and it would appear that the Court of Appeal will uphold the decision All the same, it is certain that Mr Adams will have achieved a popular victory over the Lord Chief Justice of ring land COLONIAL

July last by the Maori chiefs has just been published as a Parliamentary paper No doubt it has also obtained publicity at the antipodes It alleged that the colonial Government systematically) trampled on the rights secured to the Maori race by the Treaty of Waitangi, and preferred the following " humble requests as remedies which, if granted, would prevent the Maories from perishing by the ills which had come upon them First, that the Queen should grant a government to her Maori subjects, giving them power to make laws within the limits of Maori territory), for their own lands and race, secondly, that the Imperial Government should consent to the appointment of a Maori Commissioner, who should act as mediator between the Maori and European races in matters touching the leasing and selling of Maori lands, and take care that Maori legislation was not at variance with that of the colonial Government, thirdly, that the greater part of taxes levied upon Maories should be returned to them, fourthly) that the European judges in the Native Land Court should be superseded, and the Maories permitted to direct their own affairs in that court and, finally, that the lands wrond) obtained by the colonial Government from the natives should be returned or compensation allowed for them Lord Derby in his dispatch to the Governor of New Zealand inviting the attention of the colonial Government to the memorial, guardedly) remarked - ' I understand that it is contended, in support of the action taken by the Maori chiefs in making this appeal to the Imperial Go- vernment that the

least would be illogical, since they no longer find the right to inter Here in the internal affairs of the colony Lord Randolph Churchill in an impetuous speech stated that the Imperial Government
