Ibsen. Tho production of Ibsen's " Master Builder _ has re-awakened interest in the Norwegian dramatist, whom Mr. William Archer first mtroduoted to English readers. Ibsen, who is nearly 63, after his unirersit career became director of the Bergen Theatre, and subsequently started on Ills career as a dramatist. His earlier works were mainly occupied with the sagas of his Norse ancestors, though in "Emperor and Galila&n; " lie diverged into a criticism of "Julian the Apostate." In 1877 ap. pearod " The Pillars of Society," the first presentment of Ibsen's social views, followed by tho startling " Ghosts," "An Enemy of the People," "The Wild Duck," "Ros- mersholm " and " HeddaGablcr." All these latter hare been translated into English, and played in London with varying ver dicts, One school of critics has acclaimed Ibson as tho keen, social surgeon, probing the hypocrisies of lifo with stern sarcasm, and at the sumo time as the reformer pnt- ting the true facts of heredity before ' his generation. His opponents, on tho othor hand, declare that his " realism " is unreal, that the darker side of life is un justifiably magnified, while the lighter dis appears, and that a distorted picture is pre sented. Ibsen has always been an uncom promising advocate of Norwogian independ ence, and the socialists have claimed him as their own, though with not very certain grounds. Of late years he has lived prin cipally in Munich. His wife is a step daughter of tho Norwegian poetoss. Mug- dulena Tlioreson. The " Master Builder" deals less closely with social problems than soma of his other plays: It is impregnated with a symbolism which the Ibseiiites are busy trying, to interpret, with somewhat diverse results.
