The woman went first, and theshushand took; achill at her grave's edge, "when'he Ëtôbd bareheaded in alaahing shower. The loose earth crumbled under his feet, trickled- over and dropped on her coffin-lid. Through two long nights he lay on his bed without sleeping and listening to this sound. At first it rang ' in bis ears perpetually, brit afterwards he heard it at intervals only in the pauses of acute suffering. On the seventh day he died, of pleuro-pneumonia ; and on the tenth (a Sunday) they buried him. Por just fifty years the dead man had been Minister'bf the Independent chapel on the hill, and had laid down his pastorate two years before, on his golden wedding-day. Consequently there was a funeral, sermon, and the young man, his successor, chose II. Samuel, i.*23;*'for his text^'Lo'vely and pleasant in their , lives, and in their death they were . not, divided.'^ Himself a newly married' mari)' he waxed dithyrambio on the sustained affection and accord of the departed couple, y'Truly,'- he wound up, .'such.mar? ria'ges'as theirs.were.made in Heaven.' And could they have heard, the two bodies in the cemetery 'had not denied it: ¡but the 'woman, áftér .' theCfashión ,of, women, ' would1 have qualified the young minister's.assertion .in her Beeret heart.'

Samuel Bax visited Troy for the first time,' to'preach his trial1'sermon at'Salem Chapel, he arrived ,by Bontigo's van; late tm a ' Saturday 'night, and departed. again' for Plymouth at seven o'clock on Monday morn- ing. 'He had just turned 21, and looked younger, and the zeal of his calling was strong upon him.' Moreover he was; shaken with nervous anxiety for' the succoss of his sermon ; so that it is; no marvel if he carried away but blurred and misty impression's, of the little port and the congregation that sat beneath him that morning,' ostensibly rever- ent, but actually;on the pruncefor heresy.or any sign of weakness. - Their impressions,' at any ,rate, were'sharp enough. ?> They, counted bia thumpB:1uppn. the desk, noted his, one reference -to¡j'the,. original, Greek,' sow arid remembered, the flush on his young.face and the glow in his. eyes, aa "he Jiammered the doctrine of thé ~redemptióñ"out of original sin. The deacons fixed the subject of the trial sermons, and'had chosen;original Bin,on the ground'that a good beginning was' half the battle. The maids in the congregation knew beforehand that he was unmarried, and came out'pf«ich'aj»el kriofting.Jals'o'; that his e^es were brown, that his hair had aTreddish tinge in certain lights ; that one of his cuffs was frayed slightly '; but his black coat had scarcely been worn a dozen times ; with other trifles.

A green painted, door was let. into the garden .wall, a, door with ,.two : flaps, the upper, of'which' stood open ; and through this opening he caught another glimpse of grey water. . The landlady, who showed him into this room, and at once began to explain that the furniture1"was. 'better than it looked, was hardly prepared for the rapture with which he 'stared'out of , the window. !,His> boyhood bad been spent in a sooty Lancashire town, and' tb' bira' tho ; green ] garden,- the quay door,' the barque, and the stilly Water, seemed to fall little short of a paradise) . j ' I reckoned you'd-like it,' she said; ? * An' to bé BUfe,' 'tis a blessing you do.'. ; « He, turned his. stare, upon her .for' a 'moment.
