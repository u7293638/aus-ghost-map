The whole affair was do ill, planned and badly carried out by ithe perpetrators of the outrage, that but for the accidental shooting of Mrs. Ravens croft, the landlady, of the banking pre 'mises, , the affair would hardly have called for notice. The jury empanelled to enquire into the' circumstances , have returned a verdict ascribing the death of the victim to ?'? misadventure,' adding a rider excul pating the unwitting author of her death. This verdict will doubtless save the robbers from the -? gallows, although the law au thorities have not yet decided whether a charge of : murder will not be preferred against the . culprits, in addition to one of 'robbery underarms.'
