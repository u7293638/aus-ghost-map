The Melbourne ground was Hie scene of a contest between the M.G.C. and South Mel bourne. The latter went fist to rite wickete, and stopped there all the afternoonior a record sf 131 with three wickets down. H. Trim, the hero of the recent intercolonial with South Australia, was in great batting form. Hit coBtribetton was 4S. It was a fanhlfOT display, narked by vigorous driving power and strong defence. Every stroke was him on his return to toe pavilion at rise doee of his masterly exhibition. J. Slight icatumes to-day with 53, cot out, to his name. Hie was at the wickets about three horns, and showed all his old neatness of style, bat scarcely his accustomed freedom. He thoroughly deserved every run, and made several beautiful strokes. Bowman sowed very slowly in patting jtogrther his 21 not out but his cricket was stylish andeotmd. Probably to-day be will infuse more life into Iris play. The bowling of the Melbourne men was np to first-eleven form, and the ridding was capital Ml round, Cotter, behind the sraw, meriting special mention. The third day of the contest between East Melbourne and University was not marked by any particularly interesting cricket On the second day the guns stood—East Mel bourne, 369; Ummritr. 2 wickets down for 93\.
