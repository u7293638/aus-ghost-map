AUSTRALIA AND CO WENt By TïL_.-IAOHe'.S. Mr Cowell was quite an enthusiast on many matters while here, but he is a little disposed to be a critic afar off An " interview with him in the Pall trail Ga ille is readable, but to some it will be amusing also OIIP passage reads - " I have seen it stated that you are engaged on an Australian Symphony) '' I have seen many things stated with more truth No, I have not begun nordoIs»etU) way at present to undertaking any work inspired by the "search the bush, the ' possum,' or the everlasting gum tree There is really no available colour and nothing one can illustrate musically Now, on reading this an Australian who loves Australia, is disposed either to sneer or to snort-to reply star-lit) "Nt ation vice captain, ' or to ask What do you know about it anyhow '. There is no available colour nor anything' one could illustrate musically you say, Mr Cowen Yet there are some amongst us from Tasman onwards who deem that we have found little bits of colour shreds and patches the) may have been, or possibly, the outer fringe of a great design, whose perfect beauty we were not sufficiently educated to trace and to perceive Colour, that is, in the artistic and the poetic sense, and when these are satisfied, is it possible that the sister art of music can Ima nothing but barrenness * 'Truly no, it music will but listen as they have looked Music, as represented by Mr Cowen, did not listen-had no time perhaps to listen was so exceedingly busy in interpreting to us the musical parables of other lands is to have neither time nor opportunity to consider our own Mr Cowen might reasonably) justify) his ignorance of Australia in this way, but I cannot understand how he can justify his too presumptuous judgment The maps of Australia published about 30 years ago show dots which represent settlements along the coast, just inland from them an irregular line, which is 'the Divide or the coastal range. All beyond is white-all white-and traced right across it is the legend "Sand or stony desert the Australia which is photographed on Mr Cowen s mind is just about as true as those maps He knows the two big cities, the possum, the kangaroo, and the everlasting gum tree That is all, and he cannot see his way) to blend the notes which the) suggest into an) ne eatable chord What might he have known had he studied but a little 9 It may be profitable for. us to consider that question, to endeavour to put together a few of the larger Australian facts, gathered by) personal intercourse, or learnt from these who have set forth what Australia has taught them in verse and in prose I do not say aught of music, because seems that the sisterhood of the muses is still unbroken, and that where Tuterpe can link word to word in poetic interpretation, the lyre other sisters will not of necessity be dumb One can hardly say where the song of Australia should begin-back in what tar periods we should seek for the gigantic beginnings Whether in the great volcanic periods, when our mountain's were upheaved, or in the long subsequent periods in her our great caves were formed, or, later on, when monsters vast and strange as Hehcuioth and Leviathan lived on the plains, and cloths of the bulk of young elephants rocked in the tempest on the gigantic trees There must have been colour and tone enough in one of those periods And even later, when De- Quiros sailing out of Luna with ships such as those which formed the Great Armada, the bells ringing, the priests chanting, and the powers of the most Christian king setting forth once more to finishes in a third new world such devices as Cortez- and Ovando had wrought in the second Or when J asman, with that sweet image of his lady) love ever in his mind drove his high press through unknown seas, or when Dampier that bold buccaneer, cheered his wild crew to persevere in their cruise of thousands of miles along apparently) batten coast There is, it it be sought after, rom mee, queer), colour enough in any of these first works, and one of the very best liners) men!
