Stenograms. BY Allegretto. " Mister" George H. Reid has a good deal of the pride that apes humility. "Mister" Is quite good enough for him. He takes every opportunity of declaring that lie is contented to be "plain George." " I'm a democrat, lem ; and 1 have nothing in common with your toffs and their titles." That is the sub stance of his perpetual protestations. But methlnks the gentleman doth pro test too much. Just 'wait till he begins to breathe the atmosphere of an Im perial Court. Reid is not one of those men Who carry their own atmosphere with them. On the contrary, he be. longs to the class of men who are at the mercy of their environment Wit ness the change of his attitude toward our (Home Secretary as soon as the locale of their relations was changed from a Sydney hotel to a Labour con stituency. If one could look into his private 'bedroom In the Hotel Cecil next June, it would excite no surprise to find him practising the art of walking ■backward. There win be nothing to !be astonished at if he comes back with ia handle to his name after all. And It will be as well perhaps for his repu tation that he should. There are men, Hike Gladstone and Carlyle, whose names would lose half their charm if ©umbered at one end with a title and at the other with a lot of capital letters. ißut Held has done nothing to make "Reid" tell as much as "Sir George." Besides, when a man's name is George, and he himself is fat, he is bound to be iknown as " Georgle Porgie." But put a "Sir" before his name, and the tempta tion to ** Georgie-Porgie" 'him Is greatly weakened. This is an actual /act, and George should think it over. He should think also of the contribution he will make to the gaiety of the colonies when on his first public appearance as Sir George he announces some amazingly clever reason for going back on his pro testations. Most of the readers of thte journal are taware that a (bill has (been Introduced in the Legislature of the Argentine Re public <by the Government which im poses a monthly tax upon all bachelors between the ages of 20 and 80. But it Is not so commonly known that the Government of the Republic, far from faltering on their wey to this startling Innovation, have formulated an addi tional clause which is calculated to make the hair of both Argentine spin sters and Argentine bachelors stand on end. Did ever the most arbitrary despotism permit itself to issue such a law as this:—" Young celibates of either sex who shall without legitimate motive reject the addresses of him or her who may aspire to her or his hand, and who continue contumaciously un married, shall pay the sum of 600 piastres for the benefit of the young person, man or woman, who has been so refused." Poor sanguine law-makers ! Have they conceived the effect of such an en actment upon the social life of the country ? Argentine spinsters and bachelors "will now shun each other as poison. When every bachelor sees in every spinster, and every spinster sees in every bachelor, a possible robiber of tils or her pocket to the extent of 600 piastres, how will it be possible ever to $>rlng them together ? Each will de ivote his or her time to hiding from the other as from a bailiff with a writ What will (become of picnics, balls, garden parties, or even small teas ? It Js to be presumed that the object of the aw-inakers is to Increase the popula tion, and to replenish the land with an additional stock of working republic ans. If that Is the case, I guess we Ohall soon have a demonstration of how Nature laughs at artificial law. tf the anti-celibate clauses are put in operation, what Is more likely than an exodus from the country of every eli gible bachelor of spirit who can make his iway out of it, and of such unmarried .women of means as can manage to Snake their escape ? And, i>y the way, ■here is a fine opportunity for our Go vernment to add to our own population. Now is the time to tempt unmarried Argentina with the attractions of a land where a man can call his hand as (well aa his soul his own, and where no icharge Is made to either man or woman cor rejected addresses. If one 'were asked to name the most striking characteristic of the superna tural manifestations which ore being Continually brought under our notice, not merely In spiritualistic organs but |n Journals that profess to deal with actualities, common sense could hardly o*ll to reply that such manifestations tore principally notable for their utter lawlessness. The appearance of the ghost which presages a death In certain families serves no purpose except to ■Hit people Into a state of uneasy specu lation as to wSio the person Is for whom the jrarataff la meant ffh« thumbiess band that plucks the blankets off you at dead of night, and does the same the next night until you change your sleep ing-room, Is one of the silliest of con ceivable superfluities. And as for the whole set of spooks which spiritualism has let loose upon us of late years, a more useless lot of futile ineptitudes never cumbered tihe sphere of human conception. But if it is possible to make a distinction amongst absolute futilities, I should be inclined to put down the Irish Banshee as about the most useless of the lot So far as is known, the whole object of her exist ence Is to make an entire neighbourhood miserable by setting up a howl when some resident is about to die. Of course in her own sphere of existence she may have other things to do, but to intrude herself Into that of human creatures for the mere sake of wailing seems an ab surdly superfluous addition to the ter rors of death. 1 am moved to these remarks by a statement in an English newspaper (though for the credit of the paper I must mention that It is the statement of a correspondent) that the wafflngg of the Banshee were heard by large numbers of people a week before Christ mas in the valley of the moving bog in Bast Kerry, and that they "reached. In one instance at least, official ears on the eve of the terrible disaster." Now, Could there possibly be a more ineffica* clous manifestation than that ? What could even "official ears" make of an inarticulate communication of that kind ? And yet, after all, perhaps the Celtic nature would miss Its Banshee if we succeeded in protesting it out of existence. An idiot child Is not of much use, and yet It has its place in parental affection. Why should wo seek to prejudice the Celtic imagination against its idiot child ? Woman is advancing—gradually, but surely advancing to that goal which is to insure equality with man in social, professional, and political power. Equality, did I say ? Blind male that I am not to perceive that there can be no finality, for woman at least, in equality ; and that superiority, supreme and absolute, is the only issue which she can accept ? And the means to this end ? asks the curious reader. Is it to be the master-key of full political franchise ? Or the magical potency of rational dress ? To neither of these do I look for the great achievement. For what is the divided skirt, or the com bination which dispenses with skirts altogether, but an outward and visible imitation of masculinity. And as for the equal voting right, what is It but a fond fools' paradise wherein social rivalry and class jealousy are sure to nullify that political union which Is strength. What then is the talismanio secret which Is to open for the so-called weaker sex the portals of permanent power ? I venture to foretell it will be found in the one word, now In all men's mouths —Federation. Or, to be more explicit, In the altered relation of women to Friendly Societies. It seems but yes terday that all of us, whether Odd fellows, Foresters, or Hibernians—not to mention Freemasons or Ancient Order of Buffaloes—would be more shocked at the thought of admitting ladies to membership in our several guilds than of receiving them Into com panionship in our convivial clubs. But now all that Is being swiftly altered, and we are all. to use an express've phrase, tumbling over one another in our eagerness to admit our sisters, our cousins, and our aunts, nay, even our wives, to the sacred privileges of our * Noble Orders" and University de grees. So far, however, It must be admitted that only the outworks of the fortress have ibeen carried. The Female Forester remains just that and no more. The Female Oddfellow, too, resents the oddity which confines her to a lodge apart from that of her, absurdly so named, lord and master. In the past it was the sore point with wives that husbands could come and go at all hours, including the small ones, to mys terious lodge meetings, about whose proceedings they were sternly kept 4n the dark. The excellent Mrs. Caudle used to feel this treatment keenly, ana to accentuate the enormity of it in many a Curtain Lecture. Now that the long denied privilege of 'being allowed to establish lodges for themselves has been constitutionally accorded to women, the reign of Mrs. Caudle, like that of her obsolete crony, Mrs. Orundy, seemed to Ibe approaching its close. But the daughters of the horseleech are a long lived and Insatiable family. "Oh yes," objects the now Friendly Society Sister, " you have at least admitted us to equal rights and co-ordinate benefits in your Orders ; but It is common and not separate righto and privileges we are after. One law, one lodge, with one password as 'open sesame' for both— that Is what we, your wives in prospect or possession, demand, and with no less than that shall we be content 1" And to that complexion It must come ere long. And after that the decline and tail of Man's Empire, y „-  v - V J
