SPORTING. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. rByTelesraph.! [From our own Reporter.! Melbourne, October S. Ihe V.A.T.C. were lavoured with splendid weather on Saturday, and the attendance at Caulfield was very_ large. During the last few months extensive alterations have been earned oat on the course, which is gradually being improved, with Flemington as a model. The ruddock has been greatly enlarged, and the Stand has also been added to. Since Mr. Bond took charge of the Club, and worked it up to its present prosperous condition, the Caulfield Guineas, though comparatively a new race, has risen to the position here of a Two Thousand Guinea Stakes in England, and very great interest was centred in its results yesterday. Large fields con tended in each race, and the sport was first class. Backers obtained a foretaste of the reverses which were in store for them in the Selling Race, for which Kanaka was made a great favourite, but was easily beaten, victory fallinc to an outsider, Milparinka, which was scarcely bocked at all. Thirteen horses weighed out for the Hurdles, and the race was regarded as so open that 4 to 1 was laid on the field, and at the close Merry Maid was made favourite, more, perhaps, on account of having Batty's assistance in the saddle than from any other cause. She was, however, never in the hunt, and after Gambler had lost inevitable ground through bungling twice the Ballarat horse Sportsman won easily from Rhesus, who ran a great race under his weight. The winner was not backed to win much money, aa he has disappointed his stable several times. The Flemmgton-trained two-vear-olds who stripped Jfor the Great Foal Stakes were a commonplace-looking lot, but St. Lawrence (an own Brother to Uproarious), Quality, and Precious Stone are tine-looking youngsters ; and as Heywood was very confident about the first-named he was made a hot favourite, and Bis Bis receded to 5 to L The start was a straggling one, but O'Brien soon had the favourite in a good position, and entering the straight he and Bis Bis were in front. Here Wyman broke a stirrup leather, and nearly losing his seat Bia Bis dropped out, but Quality came with a rush andf collared St. Lawrance. O'Brien waited quietly with the latter, however, until fifty yards from home, when he sent him out with a beautifully judged run and won by half a length. Precious Stone came fast at the finish and got third place, just in front of a batch of four, among whom was_ Bis Bis. The twelve horses left in the Guineas were paraded round the paddock before going on to the course, and most of them were looking very fit for the contest before them. Guess work, who was very quiet, was much liked, and 6 to 4 was eagerly taken about him at the post. Fryingpan was_ the next-best favourite for money, as Mistaken looked small and common alongside some of the others. Transferred, who has grown very much, had plenty of friends, and so had Calma ; but the Boolka party did not fancy their colt at all, in consequence of hi3 having done very badly in his trial, and had he won his victory would have been a great throw in for the Ring. Mr. Watson was not long in getting them ofij and when Guesswork waa seen with a clear lead his friends felt very comfortable. To their dismay, how ever, he fell back directly Fry inroan went to him. and at the half-mile could not have been nearer than seventh. Mr. Pearson's colt in the meantime was making play from Heclaand Boolka, but as they came to the turn Guesswork began to make up his lost ground hand over hand, and entering the straight he was third. Being disappointed in trying to get up on the in Eide, ne stopped again at tne distance, how ever, andFrylngpanstalling off vigorously the challenge from Boolka, he won a tine race by half a length. The victory was very popular, as the colt was heavily backed ; but Guess work's mild display was a great disappoint ment. Not the slightest excuse exists for his defeat, but as he got off splendidly, it would appear that he is a faint- hearted brute, that will only follow up when he has matters all his own way. Many persons blamed Rawlings for not going on when he cot away in front, but the fact was the colt shut up directly Fryingpan and Granville went to the front, and refused to extend himself until half the distance bad been covered. The Challenge Cup was a fine race, and here backers were again unfortunate, as after jumping splen didly Erin had not the ghost of a chance on the flat with the outsider Marquis. Larpent and The Hebrew were heavily backed for the Toorak Handicap, and the colt improved on his Flemuigton running by beating Larpent ; but the race was a gift to the uncertain Verdure, who got off first and was never collared. The enect of the day's running has been to bring Fryingpan into strong request for the Caulfield Cup and V.R.C. Derby. For the Cup his price is 100 to 8, but his advance has not weakened the Assyrian, who is still first favourite, and it would be difficult to get more than 10 to 1 about the old horse. For the V.R.C. Derby Navigator's price is 2 to 1. Segenhoe did good work yesterday morning, and he and Fryingpan are at 5 to 1 each ; Guesswork is at 10 to 1; and Boolka at 100 to 8. The following are the results :— SELLING RACE, Of 100 sots. The winner to be sold for 130 sots.
