THE "PATHETIC" SONATA, OP. IS, OF BEETHOVEN. The following lecture was delivered by Professor Marshall Hall, at Ballarat, on Monday, October 19, in connection with the University extension movement - Works of art are the accumulated experience of the wisest of mankind Most people are afflicted from their birth with mental cataract, and once) perceive those things which their imagination has been studiously taught to perceive by eyeless tradition Experience is then only oculist, and his visits to them are comparatively) few and far between for he is seldom received with courtesy, never with gratitude When this great physician meets us in the open street, there is no av Olding him, but unhappily the process of restoring sight to the blind is a long one, and when in the guise of the artist he knocks at our doors, we refuse him admittance, or reject both his services and advice for to the blind man), shall not the few that speak of the wonders of seeing seem made In the beautiful Jewish fable a touch was sufficient to open the eyes of Elisha to a new world imperceptible to the people of earth Such a world lies open to the artist, and indeed to an j one that has faith to look long and steadily enough Not only does art reveal to her worshippers the secret wonders of beauty in all the objects and scenes of nature, so that "a livelier emerald twinkles in the grass, a purer sapphire melts into the sea, ' but she discloses to them the mighty forces of the universe at their ay. ful and end less work 'Thus it comes about that the details of ordinary life are flaccid and insignia licant after contact with the essence of all powers, the invisible world within world This it is that causes Got the to exclaim that after the sublime creations of Michael Angelo the works of nature seem tame and insipid Art is a lens through which the well accustomed eye may perceive, not as Mr Ruskin would have us believe, some Sunday school child's copybook moral maxim, but the eternal ideas of nature, from which all things forth flow and to which they return thus the object of art is to reveal the innate nature of things, the essential, the everlasting which is but imperfectly expressed in the forms of nature herself 1 he further one penetrates into the recesses of nature, under the guidance and by the help of art, the more obtrusive e and repudiate becomes the intense artificiality of modern life, the outward shows of which do but reflect the mind within Whether in our mode of living, that is to say eating, dressing, dwelling be of thinking, of feeling, or of occupy- ing ourselves, each is guided not by the needs and propensities of his own nature, but by the customs of those around him individuality scarcely dare express itself in life, and, when very marked, seeks liberty in the realm of art. Our eyes accustomed to the artificial uni formerly of lines and colour in the objects around us, our houses, streets, furniture, dress, &.C -have almost lost the faculty, so carefully cultivated by the savage, of distinguishing the manifold forms, harmonies, shades of nature Our eyes, accustomed to the unnatural monotone of polite society, are dulled to the sounds which are the out come of natural emotion 'J rained to suppress and smother feeling as being "vulgar, ' we have almost ceased to feel, except on the rare occasions when nature forces herat If upon us, as a death, or in the satisfaction of some ardent wish, and our minds thus stunted and warped, find interest only in the most miserable frontiers and trifles and if the aptness of the simile may excuse the exaggeration the mourning weeds compensate the widow for her loss To most people life is nowadays is a succession of paltry details, and its larger, lovelier, joyfully sense unknown In this way has come about the degradation of art Tenderers to the popular taste fill the once divine office of the artist and his show) places are turned into warehouses It is an undeniable fact that it flourishes most either during or immediately after war There is nothing extraordinary in this "War restores to us our pristine A vigour of mind and heart I face to face with death, there is but little time for trifling nature compels men then to think and feel deeply, and he who thinks and feels deeply about any one thing will tend to do the same about many The characteristic of each man, long smeared over beyond recognition by com nationality, steps naked forth Heroes cowards, all appear again upon the field. At home the topic of ron versation is no longer the latest scandal, or Mrs. so and so B dance but the deeds and tastes of men A due sense of the mighty forces w birling around humanity is felt Joys and sorrows s become real, and assume more vivid forms and nobler It is probable that children born at such stirring times would be more sensitive, that is more full of the vigour and fervour of his lot indeed the difference between the artist and the so called " practical man is chiefly this The former has treated v it but) his feelings are not stills d, his mind is not stunted for lack of wholesome food, his sight was keener, Ina hearing sharper , his job is a thousand times more bountiful, his sorrow profounder, he tastes to the full everything else has to offer him, and his nature has free play in all directions More than tine Existence 18 for him a continual progress, an unending feast where his appetite grows with what it feeds on, where ever) dumb) is surpassed by that which succeeds The preponderance of the intellectual over the intuitive faculties, which is so marked at the present time, is greatly the cause that the deeper joys of hit tune know n on!) by name to most people This has been called the age of criticism Properly understood this means that the majority of people having lost their natural infant) of enjoyment, which ever louis to applicable what is good and disregard what is bad (for this interferes with joy), have lost the seventh thepovveiot distinguishing good from bad and find their miserable vulgar, and most ener voting amusement in reviling eat anything which per tun H that higher life which they are no longer capable of experiencing To take Milton s great parable, the mother a world is comparable to Satan who being a list from heaven endeavours to console himself by imagining its defects and the superiority of his own condition the grapes are sour ! Certainly Satan was the first critic, and will be the last'., Li very thing of worth in life is given to us by our emotions The intellect of itself is incapable of trying us anything , its province is to tell us which gifts me the most worth our acceptance So far as can be judged from historical i records, the ancient Gn eks before the period of their decline must have been a nation impregnated to the very core with what Ibsen calls the" joy of life And that time produced works of art which in sublimity have never been surpassed, and, which to us moderns seems next to impossible, the multitude loved and appreciated these We read that when a tragedy of Aeschylus was produced the benches had to be removed, lest the populace ahsorbedinthemusic drama, should retch of their businesses, and they had to witness the performance standing I fear that neither at Ballarat nor at any other tow us in Australia would the attractions of a Shakspeanantraged} be so great as to compel the lessee of a theatre to take this step, Alas I was moderns, with all our science, critical ability, and amazing mummy, have good cause to han, ; our heads It is natural man age when men lived and loved life to the uttermost, never do earning of blasphemous rejecting or maiming the greatest gift of the gods that 'J urged, the contemplation of man's struggle against the forces hostile to JOJ and life, should flourish For he that most feels JOJ will most fccU'scveiance from it 'That which we dead in life we welcome in art for art reveals to us the nature of that which we fear, and encourages us by show me how other of our fellows have battled against it. A very able musician and writer, Mr John Runciman, in a valuable article in the parafine of Mine for September, rcimukson this subject "All things were to him (the Greek) good and lovable in as far as they made for life, in as far as they were antagonistic to life they were evil, and to be hated 'Therefore, the Greek most loved humanity, which seemed to him the highest manifestation of life death which would take him aw ti} from life The hated above all things Of this love and this hate the most immediate and, in his own eyes, the noblest expression was his heroism Returning, doubtless, with the mere six age ferocity necessary to defend his own life, it grew with IUB 84 meetings, as he more and more clearly perceived that the fullest and noblest life was not that of the individual, however, great but that of the many until at last he overcame his fear of death, and willingly threw away his one small life for the manifold, larger life of the community Ilia heroism was an expression of the determination that he should have the victory over death So seldom nowadays are we called upon to perform even the humbler offices of heroism that it has ceased to be a reality for us, and is merely an idea, scarcely even able to arouse our interest in the artist, however, nature ever is ascendant And sit preserves in their pristine vigour those nobler feelings which civilisation tends to extinguish 'Therefore fore most in his mind, as once in the minds of the multitude, is the idea of destiny, fate , those circumstances beyond man's control which, like a mighty flood, bear him along in spite of his struggles, whither he sees not Of almost all the greatest work is of art this power is a prominent feature, and assumes various forms in the Greek dramatists it is generally actually embodied in somexisible shape, in Shakspeare it is often represented by the evil passions born in aman, which in spite of all opposing circumstances hurry him on to destruction, as in Macbeth In Goethe s 1 grant it appears as the creation of many differently constituted minds on one another, which eventually bring about the solemn catastrophe In 1 bsen s remarkable play,' Ghosts, which nearly approaches the Greek spirit, it appears in one of its most terrible shapes as j fell edits 'The amazing i rescues of Michael Angelo in the Sistine Chapel deal with the same power although mainly in its beneficent aspect In your Art Gallery, is a copy of the "Birth of Adam, a truly divine conception, whose mighty and solemn outlines remain an eternal rebuke to the littleness of Humanity By this Biiblnne effort of genius we are enabled to conceive something of the spirit in which the Greeks gazed upon the Sacred Unknown of existence, before it had been ticketed, labelled, and explained away by vulgar minds It is now as then about us, awful and inscrutable Would that we might can Rider it with the elevated wonder and awe which the painter has thrown into every atom of the figure of our fabled forefathers 'The mutilated fragment representative c of the rates, in the British Museum, of which some of you have doubtless seen photographs, seems to me to be one of the grandest representations of that cold, passionless, immovable calm, which constitutes another of the aspects of destiny Headless and limbless as the figures in this masterpiece of sculpture are there is something, terrible in them I should not dare to so much as whisper in their presence It seems as though for a moment a corner of the veil had been lifted from the face of Godhtnd Something of this awe is imparted to us by those tremendous jet pianissimo chords which are connected with tin.

The emotions conveyed would seem not in applicable to the figure of Orestes pursued by the unrelenting 1 unes Hit work is indeed a chapter from the autobiography of beethoven himself At the very first choid axed seems to be I lifted from our eyes, and the monstrous image of late, pitiless irresistible, fills the awe stricken heart with strange presents ments of woe, winch in the succeeding bars do but gather force, till with the fourth bar the) melt into an unspeakable hear mess of sorrow, such as the sight of the sore travail of the sons of earth aw ore in the compassionate bosom of the gentle Buddha O, ye all controlling Powers, the melody) seems to cry, " is there no way but this Maj peace be won only through suffering' All this, and a thousand times more than may be conveyed through passionless words, is implied in the dignified yet passionate up sweep of the melon), cut minuting on that protesting inquiring reel tative note, followed by the line, sustained tone of the bass Not less significant is the altered character of the harmony and rhythm, whose stern severity has passed into a heroic pathos The mood again changes (bar 5) With the slow pulsating chords of the bass the heart seems to knock painfully against its fleshy walls even as when with caught breath, the issue of some momentous event is aw attend and the melody rises with an anguished and pleading cry, only to be replaced by those tri mondons chords which reverberate like the thunder fraught foot steps of advancing fate It is as though around some solitary shipwrecked manner strutting in the black lips of the inventions waves gloomy night dreivhersombic breath stilling mantle while heedless of his cries that final on but the wind hoarse daughter of the winds like ministers of vengeance, slow and stately, stride the past limits of the billows by More and more tragic Brows the movement AY hut IILOIIJ in those diseases which seem to wrench the health AYluit implacability in the upset ung chords!

The grievous cry at bar 17 seems that of Prometheus, " Ah me I alas 1 pain, pain, ever, for ever I no change, no pause, no hope! and in whatsoever direction he longing turns (bars 25 35) the resistless foot of late (bars 28, 32 38, and ) spurns the unfortunate from his hold How tremendous are these mighty fate chords which come like a thunderclap upon the astonished soul Observe their connection with the fifth note of the introduction The struggle for satisfaction of desire, for happiness, is the one motive force under bing life Ever) action in man and beast may be traced thereto As Shakespeare says, " There is nought good nor bad but think mg makes it so, and the murderer is urged by the same motives as the party It is only the harmful or beneficial result of their respective actions on the happiness of humanity at large which leads us to condemn the one and honour the other Hence the standard of morality fluctuates with each succeeding age Art, by creating within us love for all humanity, leads us to abhor those deeds which tend to make the well being of the man) subservient to that of the few The intellect slowly) follows the track of the emotions, analysing, explaining, class flag This is why the morality taught by the poets is ever in advance of the age in which they live Thus at bar 41, in spite of the' crushing rebuke of fate, we find the same instinct urging man on to fresh endeavour This theme is intimately connected with the open mg bars of the allegro, even as those are deny evil directly) from the last bar of them troduction inextinguishable yearning seems to spin man on (bar 11) to new effort (but 44), and how pathetic is the cry) which follows (bar 11), which melts (liars 70 70) into a certain resignation, which is depleted in the wail of bars 70 82 with its faint after echo, so different in character to the man) former exclamations of grief and pain in tins sonata I After yet another attempt to attain some satisfaction, which is seemingly not altogether fruitless, the tragedy is for the first time relieved by a more hopeful mood (bars 101 111) It is not amiss to remark how full of feeling is every rush of notes in Beethoven , he always uses this means to depict extreme excitement whether joyous or the reverse, performers generally reduce these beautiful effects to mere devices for displaying finger juggler), for which vile practice they are invariably applauded by the ignorant The change of spirit is clearly indicated at bars 119 122, which are fraught with a certain resolute defiance, partially indicated by these lines " Now like some huge and ponderous canopy That torn from th marble I cm els of the earth, ! l or towards its foster parent strains 1 list monstrous destiny hangs threatening over 19, Vi hose dire catastrophe alone avert The bray of) towering pillars or our souls Then in your resolute fronts let courage sit It is not necessary to anal) see so minutely) the ever varying moods of the rest of this movement It you have at all grasped my conception you will be able to do this for your selves, and I will content myself with direct ing your admiration to one or two of especial points The profound significance of the re entry of the stern theme of the introduction must not be passed over, coming as it does immediately after the defiance with which the first section ended How cold, impassive relentless seem these chords compared with the full blooded passionate human energy by which they were preceded 'Ihejaie the dungeon walls of destin) against which the maddened prisoner hurls himself in vain - they are not even conscious of his presence, and horror takes possession of his soul How is this portrayed beyond all wonder in the third bar, with its uncompleted crescendo and sudden revulsion of feeling conveyed by the cold shuddering harmony of the sixth now, sinking to utter hopelessness ' How dramatic in the long pause-it seems almost a cessation of consciousness I In the second after the struggle is renewed, interspersed with those naming utterances (bars )(> and 0 12) which we noticed in bars to 8 of the introduction we had a divine inspiration this connecting of the impetuous theme of the steam with the pleading melody of the slow movement ! I should mention one point in the render ing of this passage in which, with all humility but yet confidence, I differ from the leading accepted by many eminent authorities I would consider the first note of the third bar as the end of the first phrase, and the second note of this but I would append to the phrase of bars 4 and 5, pla) ing it up as compared with 10 of the next bar, just as in the introduction the first note is accented, and the following note piano, which is followed by a crescendo by this means the evident derivation, and therefore meaning, of the passage is made clearer The ordinary rendition of this passage always seemed to me disconnected, meaningless, and therefore illogical The extraordinary phrase at bar 31. which seems to depict a mind driven to the very verge of insanity, will be better understood after comparing it with bar 20 of the first part of the allem o d motto, from which it is du ii ed How unspeakably) true and dramatic is the manner in which one mood melts into the other in endless complexity), yet even with the one main idea knitting everything together 1 endeavour following endeavour, and in between caring resolution despair As the movement draws near its close the human element seems to be gradually over come Notice the down thundering chords at bats 71 81 which crush everything beneath them From this point the gloom gathers more and more, till in the faint gasps of the following wharf and its concluding chords, tremble in their silent despair every my of hope appeals to die in the breast-bone final culminating outburst of in distant protesting against and all is still How significant is this last blank bar with a pause written over it Irtil) the touch of this sublime seer had the power endow me with life, beauty) and truth the very nice with which he wrote We shall not to tin) have time to deal with the remaining two acts of this drama of Beethoven but lest you should be too strongly impressed with the passionate pessimism of the list net I would remark that this seems to represent the emotions of sensitive and ardent author the verge of manhood with its concomitant power of observation and thought which often deals such a down blow to the cherished convictions of childhood In the second movement we seem to see some lccompenscmude in the tender and unselfish love of woman The third deals with the prime of manhood, which has learnt that life has its compensations as well as its forfeits, that joy and sorrow are twin born, and to be endured with a constant heart As the poet has it We are noble still And myself have awaked as it seems to the better mind It is I letter to light for the good than to rail at the III The opening theme of this last movement is connected with the second theme of the opening allegro (liar 41) by the very chame teiiHtie initial gloves, which have a most striking menial (thee All those who are acquainted with this en- trancing soul stirring movement will, I am suit, extend to me their indulgence as regards my poor ineffectual effort to give some in pression in cold shallow words of the emotions which this ever enduring music arouses in an artist nature I have humbly and, allis I too rashly, undertaken a task which could only have been successfully accomplished by another -rEschjlus, Goethe, or Shakspeare May the disturbed shade of the great Beethoven forgive it me '
