Chapteb XXIX. — Mrs. Wbay's Dukam. 1 We heard from Rode a few days after ler marriage. She and Sir George were j then In Paris, and Rosie gave a very lively description of their hotel, the shops, and the theatres j in fact, of everything likely ; tx- strike the fancy of a young girl on her ; * first visit to the gayest city in the world, J-ut she never mentioned Sir George. Not once did his name occur in her long -letter. - But she wrote apparently in good -. Spirits, and my mother was satisfied* But 1 knew Rosie well. She was a girl too ;' proud to C9mplain of the consequences of her own acts, and eke had chosen Sir George, and&new; very 'well what he was : before ^ie had married him. ' / tv . The day her letter «ame was ever after ?wards marked in my mind by a most pain ful, nay most terrible incident. Since poor ' -Hester's death I had been too ill to' go. to Lithe farm to see -Mrs. Wrayv Bat during my last illness, after my miserable parting t Jwith Arthpll Garston, Uosie told me that f 3she had twice^called to enquire how I was; : but that as I supposed it would only excite Lane to see lier^ and recall painful memories, cJih&y; had not told .me of her visits at the ^time. .-: ic-.:LZ ?. .1: :.: .-?' _ ? ? - ?- ? : JBut the day Rosie's letter arrived, Mrs. i. .

' Hester won't Test in her grave now - till we've done her bidding; and I've come to-day to ask ye to get your brother's learve for us to have the old quarry opened, and its secrets brought to light.' ; « But— but, Mrs. Wray/' 1 gasped, 'this could not be done. It would require a great deal of money to reopen the shaft— and it would be very dangerous-—' ' My old man has a good few hundreds put by in the bank,' replied Mrs. Wray, quietly, *' and we'll gladly spend it all so that the poor lass may know she's not for gotten in her bloody graven You know we've no one to leave it to now, Miss Marget,' she added, with wistful pathos. 'It was to have been hers, and the silver teapot and all, and it's no good now to me and the old man.' « But— but— ' I faltered. 'It'll not cost Mm nothing/' continued Mrs. Wray, raising her head with soaie of her old honest pride. 'I wouldn't be beholden, nor John either, to Mr. Edward now for a sixpence, to be spent on my dear lass 1 He wed her, but he thought little of what -he ^promised in the church that day. . They tell me even now that he's after that bold-faced lass again that 1« went With in Hester's lifetime, though she's been but dead a month or two, and though he knew that she had grieved sore about this.' : I was silent — I knew not what to say. ' Don't think I mean any disrespect to you, Miss Marget, by naming these things,' went on Mrs. Wray. 'As I told you afore, my poor John and I pray for a blessing on you night by night. But ye'll understand ? If 1 went nigh Mr. Edward myself I couldn't keep my tongue tied. I must say things that would anger' him, . and things that would do my poor lass no good now. So I want you to ask him. The old quarry is on Mr. Edward's ground, and all that we want is leave to reopen it. It'll cost Mr. Edward nothing, for we'll find the cash, and the last sixpence we have in the world we'll gladly spend to answer our Hester's 'warning.*' 'Edward ? ?s from home,' I said, struggling to hide my feelings. ' In a day or two we expect him, and I'll see him then.' - : ? . i *' Thank you, Miss Marget,' said Mrs? Wray, rising to take her leave. ' My poor John would have sent his best respects to you, but he's so dazed like he thinks of nothing. All his spirit, poor man, was buried with our Hester. He loved his { lile lass/ as he used to call her, better than the apple of his eye !' il I know,' I said, and held out. my hand to the poor mother, whose heart also lay in lier dear child's grave. The grief of tUese simple people was inexpressibly touching. Hester had been their pride, their joy, and «fter she was gone the world seemed empty to them. But Mrs. Wray had left me a terrible task. How was I to tell Edward of the dream so strangely mixed - with truth — of the weird warning which had come in the still hours' of the night, to reveal the dark secret which lay hid in the bowels of the earth! He was expected to return to the Hall the day following Mrs. Wra/s visit. I knew this because one of the servants had come over with some grapes for my mother^ which he had ordered to be sent, and this servant had told me that they expected Mr. Selby back on this day. He would not reach Hadley until the afternoon, I knew, but I made up my mind to go over to see him at once, and to urgently entreat him to leave Hadley, and for ever. , For what would ;t avail him to refuse permission for the old quarry to be ref opened? , Any magistrate would give an order in such a case, and, if he refused, would ',, not suspicion naturally at once fasten upon Edward ? Mr. Wray (poor Hester's father) was a substantial man in a worldly sense. Such a man would carry weight with him, and if he were willing to incur the expense of re opening the old quarrjr shaft to find some clue, however^ slight, to ^ his daughter's murder, I felt convinced that sooner or later he would obtain permission to do so, and then of Edward's guilt there could be little doubt. ?' .'v\ I sp9nt a miserable night after Mrs. W^y, was gone thinking of these things, and a miserable morning when, I rose up and remembered what was before me. Edward must go away ; he must never come back. Mrs. Wray ^as, a woman of. determined will, and her love for her dead child, and her -superstitious: feelings; had made her more dangerous than a detective, and I knew well she would never rest until she had obeyed 'the warning,' jas she called it, of her dream. ' ?'- 1 told my mother I was going1 over to see Edward in the afternoon of the day that he was expected home. But visitors delayed me, and it was nearly dark when I set out. ' Dark, except that a half-moon was shedding its fitful rays upon the road as I went along, but though I was afraid I was determined to go, for I felt that the sooner Edward knew of his danger the better, ??'? ? My mother had insisted upon me taking «ur- servant with me, therefore I was not quite alone. But as I went on I could hot help feeling a superstitious dread. I was obliged to cross the fields to reach the : Hall; but across these feelds there were two ?wayfi.*'-1 '?i':i : -::- ;' ?-;'/''????''? One^Gf:fefese'ways(the; nearest) was the very pathon which p'oor Hester wafe mur dered. The other (the one whica made it a longer walk to the Hall from the -village) led through the field whicri contained the oldquarry shaft. : : I chose the latter. But I shuddered as I walked quickly along, followed by the maid; I shuddefed- and dared scarcely glance into the centre of the field; in which a rdde -Tailing wfifcp placed round the old q^T^^baft^ooaf^ty.-; '???'-. : My deaT father had -)f ten contemplated filling inthia shaft. It had been sunk auder the belief that there was valuable stone below. 3ut this wasfound not to be the case/ and sopn ^fter the shaft was made, the tmdertaking' was given up/, We bad always: catiedlt the if old quarry,' whsn w^' Were children, and used to go and gather c;o w sBpsin the field Tvhere i it wasj Ijand. I re-; member bemg warned 'by out motlier not to go too ^nearthe shaf t., , Y All thw banxe back to my mind as I' 'hurried on in ihe fitful moonlight, bound! W niy' miserable errand to my brother's house. Ah, we were happy then, 1 thought ; i - vrhy did we n6t.die as children, and why ; had m& shiidow of Such a terrible crime fallen upon my life ? . «-. . On, on, I went, half- running. Then .for a moment I glaneedback ; gknced-back, and save a cry of terror. There,- standing by the railing round the shaft, was now a misty figure. My superstitious fears came back with tenfold force when I beheld this, It was Hester's spirit I imagined, and I could not suppress the shriek which road on my trembling lips. ? Our maid Jane was equally frightened. ? ' Oh 1 Mass ? ifs the ghost !' she cried. 'Young Mrs. Selby's ghost/ and they say it's always wandering about- ? oh ! oh !' \ Jane's last exclamations of real terror were caused by the misty figure standing by the railings round the shaft, now turning and coming swiftly towards us. ' Oh ! ? ' cried Jane, falling on her knees, 'Oh ! save us, save us.' 'What the deuce is the matter?' said a voice the next minute that I knew. It was Edward's voice — Edward, whom in our superstitious fear we had mistaken for poor Hester's restless spirit! ? ' What is the matter ?' he said again, and by this time he was near enough to recognise me. 'Why, is it you, Peggy?' he asked. ' Whatever is the matter with that girl ? And what on earth were yod both shrieking about?' 'The ghost! the ghost!' roared Jane still on the ground. 'Nonsense,' said Edward, but there was ever so faint a tremor in his voice. ' Get up, girl,' he added. 'Peggy, ware you going to the Hall ?' ' Yes,' I said, ' yes. Edward,' and I put my trembling arm through my unhappy brother's. Chapter XXX. — Exiled ! In the dear room that I had once loved so well^-where IJhad sat on my father's knee when 1 was* a lilbtle child — where I had watched him when he grew an old man, and his head was bowed with grief— ? I was forced to tell Edward of Mrs. Wray's weird and ghastly dream. I shall never forget his face when he heard it. It grew absolutely white with fear, and though he was no coward, not a physical coward, I mean, this dark story seemed to strike absolute terror into his Boul. ' ; ' And, and, you believe this ?' he at last faltered. . ' I believe that Mrs. Wray had this fearful dream,' I answered, 'and I believe it has preyed upon her mind and thus re peated itself. And I believe, Edward nay, I am sure — that she will never rest, and that the old man will never rest until the quarry shaft is opened— and you know theend— ' i ** Ay— ' said Edward, and he began to pace the room with restless steps, ' do you know, Margaret, I went into a church in London — a church in Eaton-square — and there was a man there preaching about conscience. It was a strange thing, wasn't it, that I should hit upon such a subject ? But, though he called it a haunting shadow from which we could not escape, he didn't tell half ite horrors 1 You saw me in the field there just now? Do you know I am dragged there !

I said, and I laid my hands upon his neck and kissed him. He bad sinned, but oh, he hxl suffered — suffered dreadfully ! For what was so dreadful as thia pursuing shadosv — ? this haunting memory, which dragged him out night after night and day after day, to wander restlessly by the scene of his dreadful crime ? 'It's horrible, isn't . it,' said Edward shudderingly. ' And now — now the reality is cdzn&~ for if this dream is true- — -' : ' You mujstgo away, Edward,' I said ; '?go for' years — -' r ; 'For ever, you mean,' he interrupted bitterly; 'for, Margaret, if that shaft is opened there wJH be no return, for me;' ; Too well I knew he spoke the truth ; too well I knew his danger, and that his only chance of escape was to go now— to go before it -was too late. ; ' If you refused them leave to open it, you see/ it would ©nly awake suspicion,' I said. 'No, don't, 'Ed wrard; your platiis.to go away, and I will let you know how events go on.

' She is of the world, worldly, Edward, ^he thinks poor Rosie has made a splendid match, and is evidently envious of her position.' Edward could not suppress a sigh. *' Yet but for her/* he jsaid ; ' but for her beautiful face poor Hester might have been living iriow, and I might have been— well, free at least from this cursed pursuing shadow which now haunts my life! But why talk of it?' he added in a different tone. ' It I have to go into exile I may as well go at once. My sin,' and he laughed .again that bitter laugh, ' hasn't 'done me much good1 after all, eh; Peggy?
