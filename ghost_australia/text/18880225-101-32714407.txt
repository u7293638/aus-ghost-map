Alderman MOUBEAY proposed thc toast ol " The LegLfclative Council and Legislativ« Assembly." Sir JAMES BÀOBAIN replied on behalf ol the Legislative Council, lt afforded him pleasure to accept the hospitality of ¿he Mayor on that occasion. It was very desir- able that harmony should exist between the Parliamentary and the municipal institutions. He regarded it as an honor to preside ever a 'body that oonducted its business in so effi- cient and satisfactory a manner as the Legis- lative Council did. In a despatch from the Colonial Office with regard to the establish- ment; of responsible government in Western Australia it was'suggeâtêd-tbat tiiát colony should try tbd rfperiiilorit Of vúlf íono Çhftiii; ber, for the reason that theyhad not sufficient men available of 'talent and leisure to enable them to adopt' tho bi-cameral system. ' The business of the country had boen-carried on by the two Chambers without the slightest feeling of hostility having been raised, but it was possible that in a short time the Speaker and himself might have to dispute the ques- tion of who should rule in che one Chamber. (" Oh " and laughter ) He was only pointing Out what was possible,' in view of the eng -gestion- that had code from! a Tory Govern niant. . ?.'.?. .'.'".. . Mr. M.'ft BAvras responded foriheUegis: lative'Assembly. '? Councillor SMITH gave the toast of ''The Visitor«.1" \- Mr. «T. G. LEE StEEEfi responded. " Refer- ring to the remarks of Sir James MaoBain, fae said that-there were not more than one >or two public men in Weat Australia who would be favourable to the proposal of the Colonial Secretary that a einigle Legislative Chamber should be' established in that «olony. ' ; The only country in the World possBSBing Consti- tutional government which had only one Chamber was Oreece, and itsgoveromentwas of the «übstunstable character.- ? As ;a'' mem-, -ber >of the jfaderal Council) 'he'; took- a great interest in the subjeot of'federation. The Australian colonies would never be great -until they were federated. (Applause). He was'happy to soo; present ' on that occasion Mr. Service, who 'had done more than- any other man to advance tho oauso bf federation. (Applause.) He was assobiated with1 Mir. Service at the Federal Ooúncílj and ha enter- tained tea Weetibftate'regard for him because of tibe uttercttttrse He . had ^wïth 'falta «herd.' The ^tfU^^'-tofottttiettt'-^ had fained' soinethijig frtini tue meetings which took place in Sydney in connection with the Centennialcelebrations. He bad a firm belief that South 'AnstraUa would join the movement. (Applause.) He had hadtooñ versations on 4he subject with several of the . public men bf Sydney,-and he told them that as New South Wales was the mother colony; it- Was thé duty bf 'her Government to state what their objeotions to federation were. The colonies would never have the influence and power to which they were entitled until they were united. This was exemplified by what took place with . reference to the New Hebrides. He had heard it whispered that the feöliög fdr fédération 'wak becoming w.éakér In Victoria. . Mr: SEEVÍCE hdre ¡rose, ; tie said that t,ner/fl was jidtrntb ia the statement niade by;Mr; L«e Steere, and called on^hé oonlpany to give* three hearty cheers for federation before, tfcjy allowed' Mr. LeeSteere:togo "anyfnrthbr.' Three cheers were heartily given, the com- pany-standing. . MI I,: -z-.M.. :>,: Mr. LEK STEERE said that be was gun-to hear that the feeling in favour of federation was not growing weaker in Victoria,'and re- ferred particularly tb the éxcellence of the tram lines, which he declared to he much superior to the train systems of the old conn te*- ? '. ' . ;i::;vV;' /' ";, ;. The MAYOB then asked tho company tp give a: hearty, welcome to their dbUriguisUed and exalted friend^ in a political sense (Mr. James Service), the toast bf whose health he proposed. The toast was cordially received: Mr.SEBVicE said that that-meeting had, in one sense, boon a very'serious disappoint- ment, and the disappointment has arisen from this fact. When be came there be knew that ho was nothing but a dead marine. (Cries of "No,") He occupied ho publie, position at the present time, and no [ one was so mach astonished as he was him:; self, when the Mayor was good enough to ask him to take a seat alongside him/ (Â voice, "You are an old friend.") Hie was an old, friend) and hence 'the^ delight he ïelt in' tháf¡¡ i demonstration. If there was any sentiment that affected him more thin another, it was this-that he liked to think kindly of old j friends, ^and he liked old friends to think ! kindly of him. (Applause.) Those of them who had any doubts vas to whether tho welcome book to him had been too much or, not need hot think that he was likely to get ¡proud over it. Pride was not in his nature, ; but tfc was a scójúrce bf gi^tífioa^iibn td himto' tb^^fduli htf[9^:l^r1W^tii^n>'^f the old colonists who' had watched his oareer in office. He did not know, and much doubted whether in future he would be able from the point of view of physical ability to do mueh in the interests of Ohé colony';1 but this he could assure them, he would never cease while lifo existed io feel as stfrohg austerest as ever he felt in everything that appertained GÉt and most éatjjbektàci niatirter that it was an enemy that had said that Victoria was grow- ing feeble in the cause.' It might bo'that some o'f them iriight thiuk that th« Federal Coun- cil, a's at presoitt oonstitut id, with some of ¿bo didst itriportaii.t colonies' absout, could not do much gopd.ptetoticai work $ but to say that .they did »ot recognise,thc advantage pf having a thorough and complote union j was a total mistake. : Only on tho previous day he received an invitation to attend the anniversary.- . meeting of tho Australian Natives' Association at : Geelong, a body wbiob was established some years ago, whose ..motto , was. the federation of the colonies. And that association, which must j become year by year stronger and. stronger, was as enthusiastic now for federation . as it was at the beginning, .Ho ventured to soy j that..; the: «old stagers« who ware not eo readily moved to a State cf excitement, also felt a» strongly as «ver they: did that !
