CAMP FIRE REFLECTIONS. I hear the niglit winds sobbing, it is the midnight hour. And in the fire tlie embers glow with ever sparklin** power: And 'round me faintly whispering the voices of the past, tike ghosts of days departed, their sorrows o'er me cast. Their shadowy forms tliat linger are like the evenin" star ° Their robes of airy vestures as white as lilies are " And with the wandering ghost-foruis from th4t far laiid so fair I's'ee the firelights gleaming among their golden hair. Their silver wings around me waft all the snugs of yore, Sweet words of comfort, too, of peace for evermore- X know that from them cometli the words of elieeruig truth— They tell the deathless beauty of love's eternal youth. The firelight gleams so brightly; ah, it reveals to me The forms I loved in childhood when uiv life was full of glee. I wauder now amongst them as in those far-off nays, •When we ga,tlier\l golden wattle and heard the songster's lays. Their soft sweet voices linger, and brine me back the spring. When life was full of promise, a better, purer tiling. Our lives were then so happy, but night winds softlystray, They whisper in my ear—those joys are far away. The fire is gently smouldering, the embers lose their glow, The breath of sleep is wafting oblivion to and fro; The Southern Crosn above me 1 know will gentlv keep A vigil where I'm slumbering in Lethe's arms asleep. •South Australia. s.
