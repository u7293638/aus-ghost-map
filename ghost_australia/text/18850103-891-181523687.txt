Sports' and Pastimes. By " Vee.cs." Tiri Christmas holidays are overhand things >■ geriorally have fallen, into their old groove •; again; out of which they had been disturbed for • the space of three days or a trifle over. Holi days are glorious institutions, no doubt, but ; they have a decided tendency to upset one for :• about a week after they are over, and work '' .does not go down very well at first. On • • Boxing Bay, the greatholiday of the lot, there . wore plenty of amusements going off, and both the races and regatta were fairly well patronised. The Q.T.C. meeting was a success, but I should have liked to have been able to chronicle a larger attendance, and also better sport. The management was good, and the stakes, as stakes go out here in Queensland, . were up to the average, but the number of horses was limited. One gets tired of record .. ing . the feats of half a dozen thoroughbreds ' time after time, and Elsinoro soup and My Love puddingpall on the appetite when thereis too much of it. "Wo have been so accustomed of late to see Elsinore and My Love running ^first and second that the sight has grown \- ■ somewhat monotonous, and it would be quite treat to'seo some other animal have a lookin.

This was a nice little (double, and 1 hear that a great many backed \- ttbe dark beauty. Response made a bold show in the Plate, but could never hold tho winner safe. The first two races were peculiar ones, for in the first Lfttona and . Lancer ran a dead heat, but . ^ he former was disqualified as the jockey could no t draw the weight. In the second race—the . *dle Race—Drummer fell and made a mess of Qu Trk'g shoulder, and PaniciVs jockey lost 'his sad, "Up'oloth and a stone or more of weight; Dfiimmt-*^° 8^es» aU(^ Quirk deserved them forA .8 plucky. ride.

Ho ia a sterling good horse, and whether in. the sky-blue jacket and white? cap* of Colonel Forester, or :the whito*and red spots of the Earl of .Gotland, lie has won some really good races. I can't help quoting " Augur." .Tho name has a peculiar fascination for any one who lias been connected '.with the turf , over the " her ring pond;" A more genial writer than the Sporting Lift " Augur,", or. a more jovial pnl, - \it' would be difficult; to meet with. There's only another man that has liis equal at witty sayings connected with' matters " equine," and that is JohnCorlettof Sporting. Times fame. WeU, theJf/w/rr?/ff5w« uAixgur".,says:Tr" On paying-ihy usual visit^to'Flemmgtbn course on Thursday, 18th instant, X was sur prised to find the tracks looking as.I never saw them before. The rotten places, on the outer track had been removed and replaced by sand. The -tan had been rolled as it never, perhaps, • had been' rolled; the boxos had. been well' cleaned out and now tan laid down, and even the cinders' were looking better than usual. ..These special preparations had evidently. been made for some reason, and as I cast my eyes round X discovered the explanation, for under the hill were the members of the "Works Com mittee and the secretary in solemn consultation with Messrs. E. F. Dakin, S. G. Cook, and A. Davies^ discussing, I believe, the bestmeansfor improving the respective training tracks.' If the visit of the Works Committee can have, such an effect upon the training tracks, I would suggest that one member at least should visit the training ground weekly, but occasional ■visits should be made some' mornings after rain./I'm glad to hear that the result of the - interview will be satisfactory to the Fleming ton trainers, for I believe the sand track is to be "kept in thorough order, the tan track is to be increased .6 feet in width (why not throw the cinders and tan into one gallop?) and the track inside the course proper is to receive the atten tion necessary to convert it into a first-class training ground. This is as it should be." ; Although Archer is considered, and justly so, tho most fortunate jockey in the world, still .all is not sunshine.for the prime favourite of fortune's'fickle goddess. He is at the head of. the winning , jockeys by a long lead; he has the best mounts in Eng land," "and is worth thousands. He has, however, received a heavy blow, for his wife has just died shortly after presenting him with a son. It seems but yesterday since they were married,;, and t that huge bullock was roasted whole on Newmarket Heath to celebrate the event.' The gold and silver presents thatpoured in on the happy couple will long be remem bered by me for their splendour and costliness, and I never saw more rejoicing at a wedding ceremony in my life. It seems bad luck 'that just when a son and heir has been born to bim to keep the famous name of Archer olive on the English turf, that his amiable wife should be taken away so suddenly.* Mrs. Fred. Archer was a Dawson, and daughter of the: famous trainer of that name, with whom "Freddy" has had such a loug and honour able connection. Mr. T. S. Clibborn has been instructed to propare to conduct the sale of the second batch of yearlings from the New Zealand. Stud and Pedigree Company. The sale is fixed for 2.30 on January the 27th, at Greenstead, Randwick, when amongst the youngsters submitted will be a chestnut colt by the imported horse Anteros from Sylvia, the dam of Goldsbrough, Robin Hood, &c.; ; a brown colt by Musket from Onyx; and.several colts and fillies by Musket (the sire of the mighty Martini Henry) and Cadogan, from high-class mares, • It would appear that thereis plenty of money to be won on the turf in America, for, by.thV returns, I find that during the season of 1884 Mr. P. Lorrillard won no less than 84,202 dollars. Reckoning five dollars to £1; tiffs leaves nearly £17,000 as the result. Of-this sum over 35,000 dollars, or £7,000, fell to a two' year old named "Wanda, by Mortemer, wbo ran. 13 times and won eight. ^ It seems that Archer can flog horses as well as any other jockey, for he cut up Duke of • Richmond most unmercifully -when ho hadn't the ghost of a. chance .with St. Gatien. ;Hc afterwards had some disagreement with the owner of,the colt, the Duke of Richmond, and handed in his cap and jacket. . It is said that the Duke also found a grievance in Archer talking to a bookmaker. . Archer replied that he was a married man who hud made a home for his family, and realised an iudepondonco, and if the Duko disapproved of his conduot Arohcr thought he could maintain his homo without his grace's patronage, Tho Town ami Country Journal says:—" For the third time tho representatives "of William Beach and Thomas Clifford have met to ondea vour to arrango for a match bctweon tho two men. Mr. Deoblo declined to accept any other match except that on which the men had already, entered, and which'he maiutaius has > not been forfeited legally,, owing to then no paymont. of tho last deposit into tho hands of the stakeholder b\\* tho rime- specified, and that Clifford's representative is equally to blamo in i tho matter with himself. At the same time, i ho is.willing to loso tho £50 himself, or award ! it to any charitable purpose, if Alderman i Ymmg. will, on : behalf of Clifford; go on with i -the./.original- match. . On tho other hand, •Alderman Youug says that as represent ing Cliffonl's intercst it' was • his-''.duly to claim the ' forfeit, but ho 'is -will ing^ to mako a match for ' Clifford against all comers, giving Beach andHunhui the picforenco if possible. Clifford, now :dis cleiras all right to tlio title of ohampion". unless he/fuii'ly wins it from "Beach, and under the articles tlioohjtnipionship certainly does not go yath the,forfeitnro. Aldennan Evan Jottra far lii. \ Pnr^rct>r0's tlio whole businoss, and the faol'vo' ^'s being absent from the citv on the Sutu'«*lly night. By the articles tho' deposit sliohh.^ Mvo been, paid into the" hands of Aldenn'o" -Joins' not later that 9 p.m. on tlio night of- the 13tli instant, and Clifford's deposit of £50 <l»ly handed in to tlio clerk in chnrgo of-Wr. Jones's shop at 8.30 p.m. On ■Monday mcniing Aldorinim i'oung proeooded to Alderman .Jones's plaoo of business and in qnired if Boutin's deposit had Wnpaid, and Alderman Jones, looking] through his letters; found only Cfifford'samounthadbeenpaid. This was at'10 a.m^anditwasnotuntil 1.10 p.m.that Mr.Deeble tendered Beach?s deposit. Aider-; nian Jones accepted it conditionally, but after, ^obtaining legal advice returned it. The whole matter really lies in a nutshell; and that is,, .that Clifford's party stand to win a good round sum on the double event, if Clifford can beat .Hanlanj and the party are, therefore, not .willing to lose any chance of doing so. It is, however, very doubtful whether on appeal to Tattersall's that the 'doubles' wouldba allowed to stand. There is considerable talk about this matter in sporting circles; and under all the circumstances of the case, it would be a graee •'fiil act on both sides if Mr. Deeble's £50 was bestowed on some deserving charity, and the. original match 'restored to the paper.' Alean while the persons most intimately concerned are 'out in the cold;', "We are glad to learn 1 since, the. above was written that, owing to , mutual intervention of.friends of supporters of. both:.men, there is every reason to believe that; the race will come off on. the original date named." • The final meeting for the year 1884 of the. Maryborough Rowing Club Committee was held at tire Melbourne Hotel, Dr. Harriets in the chair. , Mr. Featherstone, secretary, read the minutes of previous meetings which were duly confirmed. The item of the expenses of the regatta crew to Brisbane was passed, and it was agreed that the secretary apply for the trophies won at the recent contest at Brisbane. The annual meeting for the adoption of the usual financial report was fixed for the 16th January, 1885. The secretary was instructed to intimate to owners of sailing boats moored in the vicinity of the club shed that in future they will be prohibited from using the club's pontoon. The ordinary accounts' were passed for payment, and the meeting terminated. William Hearn, the champion tculler of Hew ■ Zealand, who is matched to row Harrington at Rivertori, on January 2, is stated to be in first-class condition. We have beard there is a show of Hearn coming over to try his luck in Australian waters. "Argus," of the j Auckland Herald, says that " a communication ' has been received from Sydney to the effect1 that a crew of Sydney oarsmen will be sent over to compete in the whaleboat race at the Anniversary Regatta, on January 29, if a sculler's race is also put in the programme. ' Things Worth Knowing:— That M'Laughlin, ' the jockey, has jbeen. engaged by Mr. P. liorillard at; 12,000 dollars a year. v • • That Archer has ridden 577 races this year, and won 241. That Quirk's pluck was greatly admired . at the Q.T.C. meeting. . ^ That Mr. Finney told his jockey to sing, " Oh say to My Love be true." That the jockey did so, and a double event was the conscquenco. i That the settling at Tattersall's was satis factory. That some bookies were hit for doubles. That some jockeys should- earn* weight internally for safety's sake. That the yells ou the racecourse could have been heard from Beerslieba to Dan. That tbo next time there is a race meeting at Eagle Farm a special train will start the evening before in order to be in time for the first race. Thata "New Chum ." N in a contemporary, i must know very little about English railways. I That bo knows less about horse-racing. That we have given a " Sovereignfor a, "New Guinea.'? • That exchange is no robbery. i\ That General Stanley's pantomime goes down well.
