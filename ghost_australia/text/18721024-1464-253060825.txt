The Poor Old Salt. A captain of a little ship Cruised 'mongst some islands wild ; And that their friendship might not slip — Oft dined the forest child. And all went well until a black Got fickle in his mood ; He tired of beef, and such-like tack — And wished a change of food. This greedy savage caught, asleep, A fine old salt, Jack Jones ; He knocked poor Jack all of a heap — And ate him flesh and bones. The wretch was captured by the crew, And to the ship they hied ; They yelled out " Captain, shoot him through !" The captain thus replied — " No ! let him go. I cannot change Him to a grim, grey ghost ; Unharmed he may the woodlands range — For I have been his host. He dined with me, drank from my can — Despite his last great fault ; Still, 1 can never harm a man — Who's eaten of my salt."
