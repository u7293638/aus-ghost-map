It may be accepted as a sign of the times that the attitude of the radical party with regard to the dual vote is far less bellicose now than it was a few months back. The electoral measure in its new form was received by the Assembly from the Council yesterday without any manifestation of feeling, and its consideration, instead of being proceeded with in anger and hot haste, was postponed until next week. Indeed, the active agitation against the principle is for the most part confined to the Trades-hall League, which rests its hope of success largely on the "one man" system. There is apparently no strong feeling in the Legislative Assembly about the action of the Council, and, all things considered, there is comparatively little carping in circles outside the House. A deep impression has evidently been made by the satisfaction with which the proposal is received in all the country and in many of the suburban districts. The Legislative Council, also, represents 160,000 ratepayers, and the unanimity of the Council counts for a great deal. Not one member of the Council has been challenged for his vote, and not one is likely to be, save and ex- cept the hon. gentleman who criti- cised the dual vote proposal imme- diately after presenting an armful of petitions from his constituents in its favour. The principal parties to the affair show unconsciously by their action their recognition of the fact that the in- troduction of the " one man one vote " bill was an error, inasmuch as it cannot be advisable to smooth the way of the labour party to power. There is no desire even—except on the part of the ultras—to deal severely with the Ministers who led the Council in the rejection of the "one man" scheme. It will be left, it would seem, to Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN to endeavour to pump up a little feeling on the subject. Ministers in the Lower House are apparently inclined to excuse and to minimise the action of their colleagues in the Upper House ; and as to the radical critics who were so loud in complaining that Mr. CUTHBERT was not in earnest three years ago, they have overlooked the much stronger action of the Council Ministers to-day, and have practically conceded the principle that these Ministers must be allowed a fair and reasonable measure of inde- pendence, so that they may keep in touch with their own Chamber. For the most part it is now merely con- tended that the issue should be re- mitted to the country, and to this course there is no great objection to be taken. There can be no desire to snatch a victory on such a point, and if the Assembly feels an inability to act well and good. The Council will have no occasion to grumble, because it will have discharged its constitutional functions in preventing a dangerous measure being rushed through Parlia- ment, and in putting before the elector- ates an alternative scheme. There is one error that needs cor- rection, however. It is said that the supporters of the dual vote are men who have taken unnecessary alarm at the wild and worthless utterances of a few individual labour orators, but this statement entirely misrepresents the situation. If any alarm has been felt, it is because the party of disorder during the strike has formally organised itself in order to seize " the machine," i.e. the Executive, or in order to control it so that the trades unions may be all-powerful during tho next strike — may not be incommoded by the presence of those officers of the law the very sight of whom one of their leaders avers that he hates. Moreover, this organisa- tion has issued a " fighting programme" which is well calculated to create dis- quietude. A progressive income tax, from which the artisans are to be excluded, is an easy means of stirring up class passions by promising class plunder. The strict and stern application of the eight hours system to agricul- tural labour is evidence of fanaticism. The bias is also shown in the declara- tion that the men who reclaim the wilderness shall have no more freeholds, and that those who have acquired freeholds shall surrender to the state the value which labour is said to have put on their holdings. Here we have not the chance words of a heated partisan, but a policy deliberately formulated by a party which asks for the " one man one vote " in order to assure itself of success, and the settled interests of the country would indeed be foolish if they made no counter effort to strengthen their position. The Trades- hall asks for the " one man one vote " avowedly because the system will enable them to carry their programme, and the dual vote scheme is put forward to render the settled interests more secure against the threatened attack. At the same time it is not proposed to give the franchise to property ; or to strengthen the rich at the expense of the poor ; or to deprive the adult citizen of his vote, though he be but a stranger in the gates ; it is merely asked that in addition to the manhood vote there shall also be a homestead vote. Those who have homesteads, however humble, are, it is submitted, entitled to this vote, and all who desire the privilege of the dual vote can obtain it by acquiring homesteads. A £50 free- hold shuts the door upon no settled colonist. 'J'hc Government lins yet to specifi- cally declare ils intentions, but if it contemplated strong action it would scarcely postpone the consideration of the measure. It would bo possible, no doubt, to foment a quarrel between the ' two Houses on the bill as it stands. Constitutional points might be raised as to the diyided position of the Cabinet, but it is nssinedly wiser to drop these subsidiary issues, to allow the precedents to stand foi what they aie worth, and to leunt themain question quietly to the country If the Govern ment is content to acquiesce, so much the better for all concerned The dual vote will then be submitted to the olectoiates without unnecessarj heat, and both sides can abide b_, the îesult of tho ballot-box It is by no means easy to speal willi patience of the apathy displayed by the Cox eminent in reference to tho block of business in the Súpleme Court Not withstanding the obvious uigency of the situation, pointed outaguniuid asam.not a hand- turn lias been done towards lolievmg tlio pi essuie and enabling suitors to obtain justice On the death of Mi Justico Wlub the call for a tem poraiy pidge became imperative Yet Ministers, although they might havo leekoned wifely on the approval of Pal hament rofused to supply the vacancy Apparently the intention is to let things du ft until the return of Mr Justice Willi IMS and Mi Justice Hoiito\i>, «lion Mi Justico Molesworth xxiii, m the oidmary courso of exents i etui n to tho Insolxoncy Comb, mid the working sliength of the Bench ti ill bu restored to tho cu-toinnry alandal ti of si\ It 1ms boen dislinctlj shown that oxen with si. judges the business of tho court can not bo overtaken, ind that tho appoint mont of a seventh judge, as m Sydnoj, l8 essential to piopei ndmimstrition Still, tho Executixo, lestramed by a caie loss mdiffbronco, pet ants lix o judges to attempt to cany out tho dutios of seven for the balance of the yeal What is tho incitable íesult ?
