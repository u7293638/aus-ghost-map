Christian life But our plan», however reverent, are not always those of ' our Father,' who in Hi« infinitely wiso and loving providenco has seen best to enl our brother » «or*, and renové him to our 'home with the Lord ' Tr io wo cannot but lament our los« and that of this land Butwehumblj aud gratefully acquiesce in his de- liverance, feeling that thorewasas little as possible to regret in the decease of lohn Fairfax For he had lived more than his three score v«ars and ton-had by his own offort« and Gol'sfavour realised wealth, position, 'a good name,' and usefulness-lived to seo his «on«

nothing vv ill be said that does no command your con- viction of its truthfulness, still it is a great relief to feel that no one save himsolf is responsible for th) chairman's utterances at such

views, formed, doubtless, by reflection on information as oxtonsivc as any I possess It is no cisv ma ter now, to select on an occasion like this a subjeet tor consideration which will be sufficiently important, adapted, interesting, fresh, and practical DoubtUss some of the brethren would not have known such difficulty, although 1 have But I venture, looking up for Divine aid, to solicit your attention upon some hindrances to the growth of our churches, especially in thi» colony What- ever obstructs Christianity in anv degree tends to retard ourchurch.es W e admit that, unlike many, the very form as vvell as tha number of our churches must decrease, except as thoy postes« spiritual life That Ufa de ponas on a clear view and practice of truth in Christ, tor ' This is life eternal to know Thee the onlv truo God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou h«»t sent ' And ' whosoovor «inneth aeoth Him not, neither knoweth Him ' Thereforo, all that interferes with Christian piinciplo must impede our Church growth And so others teach Finney, an eminent Presbyterian divine, and professor of theolojry in one of tho colleges, and litely deceased, «ay« -' Although m some rospeot« less convenient »nd more expansive, ^et m a suitable state of souoty a democracy is in many respects the most desirable form, either of Ch uoh or State government God Ins always providentally given to mankind those forms

1 ever became Eerfectly urtuou«, both ChureJi and Stato governments will e proportionally modified, and employed in expounding and npplying the great principles of m ral law to the sp ri- tual and secular concerns of men The abov e principles are equally applienble to Church and State government« Episcopacy is well suited to a state of general ignorance nmoug the psoplo Pi- esbytenanism, or Church republi eanisin, is better suited to a more advanced state of intelli- gence and the prevalence of Christian principl», whllo Congregationalism, or spiritual democracy, is best suited, and only suited, ti a «tate of general intelligence, and the prevalence of Christian pnnoiple God'« providence hs« always modified both Church and State government« so as to suit the intelligence and virtu« of the people As churches and nations rise and fall in the «Tale of virtue and intelligence these varieus form» ot government naturally i and necessarily give plas« to each othar So that i ecclesiastical
