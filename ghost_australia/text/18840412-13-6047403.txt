THE EASTER FESTIVAL. Easter Sunday falls late this year. As it is always the first Sunday after the first full moon immediately following the 21st of March, it cannot occur earlier than the 22nd of that month nor later than the 25th of April It fell upon the former of these two dates in the year 1818, and it will not do so again until the year 2281 The name given to the season in England seems to have been derived from the Saxon name of the month of April, Oster or Easter month, when the feast of the goddess Lustre, Lottie, or halls, was celebrated She is supposed to be identical with the Phoenician or by rain goddess Astarte instituted to commemorate the resurrection of the Saviour, the observance of the festival was meda obh glory upon the Christian world as far back as the Council of race, in 22, and it has always been celebrated with imposing ceremonials in the Roman Catholic countries more especially in Rome, up to the time of its recent absorption by the Kingdom of Italy, the noble piazza in front of St Peters was the scene of a singularly imposing spectacle on Easter Sunday A hundred and fifty thousand people, comprising men and women from all parts of the world, were congregated in that vast area Carriages innumerable were there, but there was ample room for them and by the spectators who were on foot The soldierly in their bright uniforms, and the peasantry from Albany, Tivoli, Pa Rosanna, Frascati, Monterotondo, and many a village up among the bulls were arrayed in their gala costumes, and introduced splashes of blue and white and crimson into the other wise sombre aspect of the crowd , while high up above their heads the two fountains lifted their glittering columns in the sun. The flight of steps leading up to the cathedral was black with people, and the bases of the pillars of Birmin a colonnade were hidden by human beings, upon whom the 100 images of Bullita which crown the balustrades parapet looked down with stony compla scenes All eyes were bent upon the balcony above the central entrance to St Peters, with its white awning and its crimson drapery Presently two gigantic fans, composed of peacock's' feathers, were seen approaching, and then the venerable figure of the Pope, attired in robes of snowy whiteness, and surrounded by the princes of the church A great silence immediately fell upon that enormous crowd The papal soldiers and the more devout of the spectators knelt, and the Pontiff, rising from his gilded chair, and spreading out his arms, pronounced a solemn benediction, uri ed of by, and as each clause of it terminated with a solemn "Amen," he waved his right hand and made the sign of the cross in the air Directly he had concluded, cannon " vol le) ed and thundered' from the Castle of St Angelo, joy bells crashed from a hundred companies, a shower of indulgences hill from the balcony and were scrambled for by the throng below, and the vast concourse (towed away from the piazza in a thousand living streams, to return again at nightfall in order to witness the illumination of St Peters Dickens has described the range facing spectacle admirably in the following passage -"What a sight it was to see the great square full once more, and the whole church, from the cross to the ground, lighted with innumerable lanterns, tracing out the architecture, and winking and shining all round the colonnade of the piazza And what a sense of exultation, joy, delight it was, when the great bell struck half-past 7 on the instant-to behold one bright red mass of fire soar gallantly from the top of the cupola to the extremest summit of the cross, and the moment it leaped into its place, become the signal of a bursting out of count less lights, as great, and red and blazing as itself, from every part of the gigantic church, so that every cornice, capital, and smallest ornament of stone, expressed itself in fire, and the black, solid groundwork of the enormous dome signed to grow transparent as an eggshell A train of gunpowder, an electric chum-nothing could be tired more suddenly and swiftly than this second line mutation and when we had got away, and gone upon a distant height, and looked towards it two hours afterwards, there it still stood shining and glittering in the calm night like a jewel Neta line of its proportions wanting, not an anglo blunted, not an atom of its radiance lost ' In Jerusalem the church of the Holy Sepulchre was, until the days of the Crimean war, the scene of an alleged miracle on Easter Sunday, which excited the feelings of the pilgrims, who annually resorted thither, to a state of frenzy or "fire from heaven" issued from the sepulchre, and in the wild rush of the devotees to light their tapers at it, many lives were sacrificed On one occasion, when Ibrahim Pasha entered the body of the church to view the spectacle, he fainted in the heat and stifling atmosphere of the place, and, in the confusion and tumult which ensued, nearly 200 persons were killed But this led to the adoption of proper precautions to prevent a repetition of the tragedy and Mr Kinglake tells us that the Latin Catholics, who formerly concurred in acknowledging the annual miracle of the heavenly) life, now repudiate it as a trick of the Greek Church It will be remembered that the Crimean war originated in a miser- able squabble between the Greek and Latin monks in Jerusalem, over the possession or guardianship of what are known as the holy sites In Spain the popular celebration of Easter Monday takes the shape of a bull fight to which all classes of the community repair, in their holiday costume and the plaza, in which it takes place, is " the locus of a fire, which blood alone can extinguish ' Men, women, and children, the noble and the peasant, fill the galleries encircling the arena, and the excitement becomes intense when a magnificent animal, bred in the valleys of the Jarama, near Aranjuez, is drum into the un,; " while li his life, on either side, but the blood within death bull, And the dim little glow as if on fire, The paws to the turmoil like eyes mu Jet and they are Got In result rings of But now the state, with one red glare of brass upon the lue Twelve thousand spectators are gathered to gather to witness the exciting contest between man and beast, and sists of honour are reserved for the clergy,), who uphold the pastime, because the gate money ' is applied to the maintenance of the hospitals in the ring are the parade en, or mounted horsemen, with their spears , the chutes, or combatants on foot, dressed like our old mend L'scumillo, m "Carmen," and the matador eg, whose office it is to kill the bulls, and the gaily caparisoned mules, which will sing their bodies from the arena There is no need to describe so well known a ' function as a bull fight which generally terminates in the slaughter of eight animals, in one or two horses being gored to death, and perhaps in the serious injury of a child or of a matador Nor is it necessary to moralise upon the spectacle, which belongs to those coins de Espana that are quite unintelligible by foreigners In Russia the great festival of Easter is still observed as one of the most joyous in the Christian year, and this is more especially the case in Moscow On Sunday the universal greeting is Christos vase as, meaning, "Christ is risen, and this elicits the exclamation, Voisttney losses, " He is risen indeed On the day following there is a general inter- change of ptiHchnl eggs New clothes were donned and new liveries are worn in honour of the day), all classes surrender themselves to the pursuit of pleasure, and both the old capital and the new resound with merriment, in which there is more of wild dissipation than of rational cheerfulness But nowhere, perhaps, was Easter celebrated with greater heat tiness than in England during the middle ages For a whole fortnight all but the most pressing work was laid aside, the courts of justice watercloset, and as Puritanism had not yet arisen, the clergy and high ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm thought it no sin to play) at hand ball in the church on Easter Sunday Church area were also held on that day These were brewed by) the churchwardens and other parish officers, and were sold to the holiday makers, the profits going to the repairs or enlarge- ment of the sacred edifice Philip Stubs, who set himself up as a public censor in the reign of Elizabeth, thus speaks of the practice in his Anatomie of Abuses Incertae towns where drunken Bacchus beara aware against Christmas, Easter, Whitsunday, or some other time the churchwardens, for so they call them of every parish, with the consent of the whole parish, provide half a score or twentie quarters of malt, whereof some they buy of the church stocks, and some is given to them of the parishioners themselves, everyone conferring somewhat according to his ability, which mant, being made into very strong ale or beer, is set to sale, either in the church and) or in some other place assigned to that purpose Then, when this apparatus, this huge capped, as they call it, this nectar of life is set a breach, well is he that can get the soonest to it, and spend the most at it, for he is counted the godless man of all the rest, and most in God's favour, because it is spent upon his church forsooth " Old Robert Burton, who lived somewhat later, defended these church ales in his Anatomy of melancholy, as well as popular diversions generally, because he would not take away the good use of any recreation, he said, on account of its occasional abuse Hand ball play for fancy cakes was always greatly in vogue at Easter time, and Seiden conjectures it to have been borrowed from the Jewish custom of eating bitter herbs at the time of the Passover But with respect to the pastime as engaged in by the clergy), some curious particulars are recorded by EoBbroke, in his Dictionary of Antiquities, where we are told that the ceremony was conducted as follows -"The ball being received, the dean, or his representative, began on antiphoneor chant suited to Easter day, then taking a ball in his left hand he commenced a dance to the tune, others of the clergy dancing round hand in hand At intervals the ball was handed or tossed by the dean to each of the chester, the organ playing according to the dance or sport At the conclusion of the anthem and dance they went and took refreshment It was the privilege of the lord, or his locum tenens, to throw the ball, and even the archbishop did it." What a sensation would be created now a days by a performance of this sort in the pro cathedral of the Melbourne diocese, with the dean and some of the archdeacons dancing down the middle aisle I To partake of a gammon of bacon at Easter time was considered a highly orthodox proceeding, because it testified the Christians' abhorrence of the Jews, just as, for the same reason, it was lawful and customary to stone and beat the unfortunate Hebrews from the Sabbath before Palm Sunday until Easter Tuesday), unless they purchased exemption from this maltreatment by the payment of a sum of money Running at the water fountain was another favourite pastime during the Easter holidays, and old 1 at Stephen, to whom we are in debt for the earliest description of London extant, has left on record an accurate description of the sport "In Easter holidays," he sits, ' the) light battles on the water A shield in hanged on a pole fixed in the midst of the stream A boat is prepared without oars, to be carried by violence of the water, and in the fore part thereof standeth a young man ready to give charge upon the shield with his lance If so be he break his lance against the shield and doth not fall he is thought to have performed a worthy deed If so be, without breaking his lance, he runneth strongly against the shield, down he falleth into the water, for the boat is to lend) forced with the tide But on each side of the shield ride two boats, furnished with young men, which recover him that falleth as soon as they may Upon the bridge, wharves, and houses by the river side stand great numbers, to see and laugh thereat" Paste, Pasch, or paschal eggs still continue to be presented between friends and relations in some of the more sequestered districts of England, and these are dyed in various bright colours, and inscribed with mottoes, or ornamented with drawings Brazil says they were formerly consecrated, and that a special form was prescribed for use in England, Scotland, and Ireland, when those countries acknowledged the authority of the Papal See In the time of Edward I , large quantities were bought by the steward of the royal household for presentation, after they had been stained or gilded, to the members of the kings retire In France, the Easter egg, painted vermillion or blue, has been pretty well superseded by costly imitations, fabricated by the jewellers and dressing case makers and on Easter Eve there IBO brilliant display of these articles in the shop windows of the Palais Royal, the Avenue de l'Opera, and the Rue de la Paix. Chocolate eggs, weighing two or three pounds, and filled with sweetmeats, a whole nest of sugar eggs, with a hen sitting on top, each egg containing a dainty present, and a real ostrich egg, mounted on a stand of ormolu, and elegantly fitted up as a. lady's work box-are among the favourite substitutes for the old paschal egg, which satisfied simpler folk in a less luxurious age Occasionally, however, a real hen's egg is carefully emptied of its contents, cleaned, lined with white or black satin, filled with a pair of diamond earrings, reclosed and war mailed, and suit as an Easter offering to one of the belles of the season During the reign of Marshal MacMahon, one of the foreign ambassadors forwarded to Madame the Duchess, an egg of sufficiently large dimensions to admit of its containing a superbly curred crucifix of ebony and ivory, lit in length, and a few years ago, the Empress of Austria, who is as fond of dogs as air is of hunting, received from one of her royal subjects, residing in Paris, an Easter egg, inside of which were two of the choicest little Havannah terriers that money could procure But this was diminutive and the veil by comparison with the enormous egg, presented upon a certain Easter Monday, by the late Duc de Grammont Cadorouvie to an actress with whom he was violently) injury As it was conveyed along the Itoule yards in a huge lorry), it was the observed of all observers, for it contained a barouche and a pair of horses, and it served as a nine day's' wonder to all Pans In some of the western and south western counties of England a practice prevailed, some thirty or forty years ago, and probably is not altogether extinct at the present moment, of heaving or lilting at Easter tide On the Monday, men were privileged to heave and kiss the women, in an arm chair decorated with ribbons, and on the Tuesday it was the women's turn to heave the men and kiss them Guests staying at inn would be thus lifted and saluted by the female servants who were entitled to a fee in return William Hone states that Mr LysoiiB the antiquary), found among the records in the Tower of London an entry of a payment made to certain ladies and maids of honour for lifting Edward the First in his bed at Easter The ceremony seems to have been considered incomplete without three distinct elevations, and these are supposed to have had, reference to the resurrection after three days It was an article of popular belief in former times that the sun danced in the heavens upon Easter day Before the Reformation a sepulchre representing that in which the body of Our Lord was laid, was erected in many of the English cathedrals, and the principal events of the Resurrection were dramatically enacted in connexion with it It is mentioned that the great Easter taper kindled on such occasions in Westminster Abbey weighed ROOFS Some of the properties employed in the sepulchre play at the beautiful church of St Mary Rad cliff, Bristol, were thus quaintly described - "Item Heaven, made of timber and stained cloths. Item Hall, made of timber and iron Work thereto, with devils to the number of thirteen Item the Holy Ghost coming out of Heaven into the sepulchre. Item longed to the four angels, four perkes " These formed part of an account sent in to the rector of Redcliff by Master Cannings in the year 1470 Angels in wigs must have been exceedingly comic.
