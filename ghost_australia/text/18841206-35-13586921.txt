THE NILE EXPEDITION. -.-. The Standard and the Daily News contain letters from their special correspondents on the Is the. The Standard correspondent thus describes how the ring in which he is us being conveyed to Dongola was navigated up the rapid at Kingfish " It was interesting in a high degree, and distinctly exciting, to watch the skill with which our steers- man would guide his craft from whirlpool to whirlpool, taking advantage of the backwater of each to carry him in the required direction. And thus by cautious dodging we reached the main eddy near the head of the rapids, on either side of which the water swirled past in billows that rocked violently even our big flat-bottomed boat, suddenly, with the am of a stronger puff of wind than usual, wosbotacross the stream, the nugget, bobbing in the boat like a cork, got into a quieter current, which gradually we over- came, and so reached the placid river above. After a time it is possible to comprehend the system by which the boatmen navigate, although at first it seems highly bewildering, and to the novice alarming very rapid has its Black water, some)' miles on one side of the river and sometimes on the other. When we get to the end of one stretch, we shoot across the stream to the other, and BO griduullynBOend, as if by so many locks The dangerous period, of course, is where striking serves, as the boat we then gained rapidly downwards, and if it should fail to reach in time the friendly cozy on the other side, might be dashed against the rocks that lurk under water, and so be wrecked. Small boats such as ROOMS coming from England will not be able to sail up the rapids after the manner described above In the first place, they will not have enough sail power, and in the second, they will not be large enough or strong enough to swim i a. mid-stream or to cross from eddy to eddy They must be hauled up close in shore, which in many places is no easy task, owing to precipitous banks and overhanging trees ' The same correspondent writes thus about the scenery on ibeNilo -"dreary and forbidding is the scenery along those desolate iv riches of the great idle Jet black rocks show up through the desert, and shine as the sun like gigantic masses of 'coal, and the yellow sand, def tB down between them to the very brink, shrinking noi only on coming in contact with the waters, now retreating, but smothering the fertile depot which they leave behind Only at rare in serving does a hardy date palm or mimosa bush save the landscape from utter desolation Through this dreary country the JS the hurries on more rapidly than usual, as if anxious to escape from this thirsty land and preserve itself for the more congenial valley s further north. but if during the day the country is uninteresting in appearance, it is not so at night. Just now a new moon lights up the landscape until the small hours and the black and grotesque shaped rocks throw strange shadows upon the sand and mer the feathery mimosa trees on the opposite bank loom up like ghosts, and if it were not for the chorus forward as the men join, in that favourite soldiers' song, The Charge of the Light Brigade,' one might go to sleep dreaming of fairyland " The correspondent of the Daily News found an opportunity while at Korosko of Talking with some of the Nubian villagers -" When asked what they thought of this expedition, they replied that it was nothing new to them, because so many English people came up the river Accord- ing to their statement they had never heard of the Mahdi and were not value least concerned about the cause of which he assumes the leadership Their innocence may have been put on as a cloak to hide intrigue with a subtlety one would hardly give them credit for, but for more probably they were perfectly ingenuous, for the labour of cultivating the narrow strip of Nile bank on which alone vegetation is to be tell leaves them little leisure for intercourse with stray tiny filters by land or water At all events, the further we go to more difficult it becomes for us to realise that we are advancing into an enemy 'B country or to believe that there will be any necessity for striking hard-blow s in order to as leave the beleaguered garrison of Khartoum " The correspondent from whose letter we have just quoted goes on to BIIJ that some of the best work in connection with the expedition is being done by officers who have to purchase camels for transport -" At Konnoh we found two of them quartered in the otherwise deserted rooms of an Egyptian hospital, living in dirty rooms, surrounded by no luxuries, and dependent for society on the friendliness of Arab officials One of them, Lieutenant Barttelot, had crossed the desert to Koseyr three times for the purpose of bringing camels that had been shipped from Aden. Once he had done the 100 miles in less than a day and a half w without changing camels, there being no relays of trotting animals on that caravan route in these times. At Esnoh Lieutenant Lovell, who is temporarily attached to Sir Evelyn Wood's "Egyptian army, was doing equally good work He was living a Bull more lonely existence than his colleagues at Kenneh. Has solitary quarters were in the palace, and, except a servant he had nothing to keep him company but owls and the echoes of his own footsteps through empty rooms. The place is big enough for a regiment, yet all the spacious halls are deso- late without a bit of furniture except his own camp kit. When tired of the gloom indoors he has his bed carried on to the Hot roof, and sleeps there in truly Oriental fashion He has free range of all the place, and may even wander through the harem without fear of stern Bablo janitors. 'those apartments, generally guarded with such jealous care, were for once open to the gaze of an Handel's eyes, and after looking at them one ceases to wonder that the women of Egypt should be more like flavor than wives. They sit all day cooped up in darkened chambers, where the narrow windows are so high that it is impossible for any- body to get a glimpse of the outside world through them liodroomB, condors, and marble bath oil receive the light of day dim and subdued through narrow slits high up in the thick wall, Bud are kept cool by currents of air descending through elaborately perforated ceilings. In places of this kind many English officers have been passing weary months of seclusion, relieved only by duties more labourers than interesting " The same correspondent goes on to say that the further one journeys up the Nile the more one appreciates the delightful dryness of this Egyptian climate "1 travelling across and w posted, one would soon begin to long for the mists and rams of England, but here there is always a I out of verdure to charm the eye, and though the desert copra at places quite down in the rh cr bank, in others it is only separated from it by cliffs of bare rugged sandstone, granite, or basaltic rocks, scene of fertility never wholly dis- appear, while a total absence of humidity in the air makes it invigorating even in the hottest hours of the afternoon We slept last night within the tropic of Cancer A brisk north breeze kept the atmosphere deliciously cool till sunrise, and though the temperature rose at midday to nearly 90 degrees in the shade there has been no feeling of lassitude UB there would have been in moister climates The result of this is that the troops show so far no indication of suffering from heat, whether afloat in burges or encamped ashore "
