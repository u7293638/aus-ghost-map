Jilt. CHRISTIE MURRAY'S DRAMATIC RECITAL. At tho Y.lLC.A.-hall last night, Mr. David Christie Murray gave for the first and only time in Sydney an evening of dramatic recitals in prose and verso from his own works. Tho audienco was not large. Mr. Murray ia evi dently no novice at recitals, nnd from tho very start ho hold tho attention of his listeners. His manner wub magnetic nnd while his facial ex pression was limited aud his gestures few, his voice produced cffecU and illu sions that were occasionally iutensely dramatic. This power was probably shown to its best advantage in bin ouly proso reading, "Thu Showman's Ghost." From the opening sentences " Tho Ta9iuani;in doril slum bered, the aboriginal apo of tho Andes was chas ing the aboriginal ilea," Ac., to tho last vivid episode in a story of remarkable domestic pathos relioved with genuine touches of humor, Mr. Murray was followed with tho keenest iutereat oil the part of his auditors. He displayed, too, in this reading a talent for quiot humor which was most amusing. Tho first part of the recital comprised selections from his own verso. " Tho Diamond King" was his first effort, and it instantly revealed tho fact that Mr. Murray was a reciter and good elocutionist. All thut he did boro an appearanco of naturalness aud spontaneity which favorably affected his audience, and he was most successful iu pre serving to each character its distinct individu- , ality. " The Story of Mr. King," au incideut ; in tho life of a Yankeo adventurer during tho Turko-ltussian war was delightf ully treated aud tho applause was most hearty. " The Meditationn of Michael Tregovitcli " (bound for tho gallows) was also among the selections. This, Mr. Murray claimed, was not Ins own sober thoughts but what ho imagiucd might bo those of a ilussian patriot sentenced to death for attempt ing to freo his country from tyranny. The entertainment, generally speaking, >vus most enjoyable.
