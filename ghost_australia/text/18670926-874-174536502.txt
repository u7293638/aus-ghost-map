Thoughts at N—-n's. WHY is it that directly I take my seat in, this renowned cafe, a small boy with a cigar-box full of fancy soaps importunes me to purchase his saponaceous wares? Does he think that I want washing, or that because I come in for a " wet" I must necessarily, require soap P Prom what region proceeds that pensive-looking damsel in sable robes, who incessantly walks through the room with a tray-, ful of empty cups and saucers P I Why is it necessary for the young ladies at the bar to hold con-; fidental discourse with every fellow who wants a drop of P.B. or aj glass of sherry. • Who is that melancholy-looking individual who constantly! saunters through the room, looking reproachfully at the customers ?•: Is he the ghost of a discharged waiter, or is he hopelessly in love;! with one of the ladies of the establishment P !: Why does the attendant goddess always ask me if I will have' my whisky warm, and always omit the expected bit of lemon. Who is N N ? What is he ? Where is he ? Is he a ,he at all, and if so, where is he to be found ?
