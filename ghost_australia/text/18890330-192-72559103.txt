Something to Read. " Adventurer "-one who goes out to meet whatever may come. Well, that is. what we all do in the world one way or other, and, speaking for myself, f alto proud of the title, because it implies a brave heart and a trust in produce Besides when many and many a noted croesus, at whose feet the people worship, and many and many a true-serving and. and word-coming politician are forgotten, the names of those grand-hearted old-ad venturers who made England what she is will be rembered and taught with loy& and pride to little children whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb* of centuries yet to be.

The furnace,, roused by the attack, roars amain, springs up more fiercely, and from its* ardent gorges spouts up flames and: showers of ruby sparks in all directions,, while endless tongues of flames dart simultaneously out through the doors and windows. Steam now blends with smoke, and clouds-black and white and grey,-eddied by the wind, wriggle and struggle in the dark.
