AMERICAN JOTTINGS. (writes the Philadelphia Correspondent of the Times.) A GRAver question which perplexes the minds of our legislators is how to fix the standard of the United States' army The rigid economists wish to reduce it to 60 000 men, all of whom shall be regulars, and, as they now control affairs, the reduction is being made as rapidly as the volunteer forces can be withdrawn from the Southern St uses and mustered out of service there is a strong party in the country, however, who wish to increase the standard, some making it as high as 200,000 men. The officers who are continually being discharged head this party, and they have myriads of followers in the restless thousands who wish to to to win with England or lYric, to capture Canada or Mexico, or to engage in any other scheme of aggrandisement that promises excitement and plunder There is a strong probability, therefore, that Congress we will increase the number of" men authorised for the peace establishment, and thus provide positions for many of the officers who now wander about the country without commands, though the increase can only be made in spite of the strenuous opposition of every Congressman who wishes to economise the public money The policy the Government is now pursuing is to muster out every volunteer soldier and retain only the regulars and the number of troops in the regular army is as follows Officers Men Six cavalry regiments, each 12 companies 204 7,218 live artillery lCBinicntÂ«, each 12 companies 273 4,800 len infantry regiments, each 10 companies 340 8,300 Nine infantry regiments, each 24 companies 003 21,321 Total 1570 41,810 lins love, with a few thousand recruits to bring the total number of officers and men up to 50,000, is intended by the Administration, if Congress lets the matter alone, to constitute the standing army of the United States There are now very few volunteers 111 service, not over 40,000, and they are being mustered out as rapidly as the Qunrtciniaster and Pay Depnt ments can attend to them They are the few troops-, left, of one of the largest armies ever gathered together on the earth's surface, and the rapidity and quietness with which that great body of men has been scattered over the country, each mine toiesumei>eaic ful pursuits at his own home, is a marvel even to ourselves The whole number of men sent to the armies of the North during the war was 2,673,06.2, nearly one-fourth of the entire male population of the Northern States Conscription- and immense bounties were required to drag every fourth man from his fireside to the camp, but it was done, and this vast number served various terms of service, for three months to three years, but so many served the longer term that when I reduced to the three years' standard the aggregate terms of service w e e equivalent to 5,129,041 men serving for three years Of the whole number of men sent to the Federal armies, each State furnished the following numbers -Marne 71,745, New Hampshire 1160, Vermont 35,256, Massachusetts 151,7, Rhode Island 25,711, Connecticut 57,270, New York 4,563, New Jersey 79,511,Pennsylvania 366,326, Delaware 13,651, Mary- land 40,730, West Virginia 10.000, District of Columbia 16,872, Ohio 317,133, Indiana 195,147, Illinois 258,217, Mulligan 90,119, Wisconsin 96,1, Minnesota 25,031, Iowa 75,860, Missouri 108,773, Kentucky 78,510, Kansas 20,007 The State of New York furnished over one-sixth of the whole number, Pennsylvania one-eighth, Ohio one-ninth, and Massachusetts one-fifteenth, these four States gave to the army one-fifth of their entire male population New Hampshire and Vermont sent one-fourth of them males, and Indiana and Illinois a trifle over one fourth Kansas shows the highest proportion, having sent 36 per cent of her men, while low a sent 30 per cent. The more we examine these returns, the more wonderful does the whole exhibit appeal, and while it cannot be denied that the Arne mans can in an emergency y become 1 great military people, the wonder is how so great a drain of human life could be kept up for four years without breaking down, not only the South, where all the males capable of bearing arms went to the armies, but the North, too. It is devoutly to be hoped, however, that neither section will ever have any need of exhibiting such lent his statistics again. The Government, besides reducing the army and navy to the low oat standard, is economising 111 other ways The financial exhibit of the Treasury for the last quarter of ISO J IS partially completed, and shows a great decrease of expenditure when compared with the last quarter of ISO 1 In October, November, and December, 1894, the expenditures for the Interior Department were 7,oi'>,324 dollars 57 cents, in the same months of lSOo they were but 2,369,710 dollars 26 cents In 1864 the expenditures of the "War Department were 11 1,03G,GS2 dollars 10 cents in 1863 they were 72,785,600 dollars 48 cents. The Navy Department in 1861 spent 31,021,985 dollars 9 cents, 111 155, 15,985,773 dollars 12 cents The present expenditure, however, is at the late of 600,000,000 dot lars a year, much more than the receipts of revenue even from our enormous taxes will warrant The most most rigid economy must be enforced in all quar | ter8 to reduce the Government expenditure, as is the plan of the Secretary of the Treasury, to 100,000,000 dollars over the interest on the debt, but it is very hard to convince thi-voveminent disbursing others that this must be done Bounty and A custom I bills for fully 100 000 000 dollars are now before Congress urged by all the influence of a powerful lobby ordinary them are successful they will be followed by 1 ills appropriating as much more 1 he economical party has a hard time to bear up against the current, for public and private extravagance and wastefulness have a farm hold on the American people Inflation and paper money have set us all will the United States Government has been prodigal in other ways than with money Owing millions of acres of public lands, they have been given away with most lavish hand Railroads canals, colleges, soldiers sailors, and State Governments have receded enormous tracts, and the Government policy has always and vi iscly been to afford every inducement to settlers to occupy and cultivate the boundless prairies of the West by granting are after at re fir flu most trifling service Deeds of thousands of acres granted for all sorts of purposes are constantly prepared in the 1 and office, and to the trifling sum of 1 dollar 25 cents per acre any man can buy himself a farm But the amount given away has always been far in excess of the amount sold for the revenues of the I and office have seldom been more than enough to pay its current expenses Congress has granted to the State of Illinois alone 2 50,1,053 acres of land, valued as high as 10 000 000 dollars The grants to Mississippi, Alabama Missouri Arkansas Iowa, lionel i Michigan, IxiuisiaKti, "N lseonsin, Minnesota Kansas, and Illinois, amount to over 10,000,000 needs Wisconsin, Michigan, and Oregon have received 2 226 500 acres for the construction of waggon roads line is little, however, in comparison with the grants made to the great Pacific railway routes The concessions to the Union Central route amount to 3)000 900 acres The Northern route-from Like Superior to Olympia, on Puget s Sound has been granted over 47,000,000 acres three loads receive certain facts whenever sections of the road are constructed, and small portions of both are already built Speak- ing of the government land grants to railroads, the I and Commissioner in his late report says - these immense railroad grants by estimate embrace 125,000,000 acres, cxi ceding by 8,000,000 acres the aggregate area of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, A rrmont, Massachusetts Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland Diese enormous grants are within one fourth of being twice the united areas of 1 England, Scotland, Wales Ireland Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, and the islands of the British boats, and are within one tenth of being equal to the French empire with its eighty nine departments and its 37,510 com muses Goods in spite of the high tariff, continue to pour into the United States from abroad, and the receipts from Customs for the last six months of 1805 arc costs rented to exceed those of the previous twelve months The total receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1865, were M,000 000 dollars, and the receipts for the six months ending the 31st of December, 1865, are said to exceed So,000,000 dollars This shows an enormous importation of goods, and an enormous debt rolling up against the United States abroad, but the wretched farm system fastened upon the country by the Yankee manufacturers will not permit us to send breadstuffs out in sufficient quantities to make the balance anything like equal There must be something wrong it this country pays money forgoodswhen the seller would quite as gladly receive corn, but the corn grow or of the AN eastern States prefers burning his cost for fuel to selling it at ten bushels for a paper dollar In low a, Illinois, and nearly all the Mississippi valley, wood is ten dollars a cord, and Indian corn is the cheapest fuel the farmers can use The dissatisfaction at the present tariff system is universal throughout the West, and free trade leagues BTO being formed in the principal cities "V at the \ anKce controls Congress and there is very little doubt that in a few weeks he will push through that body a tariff even more ruinous to all but the manufacturing interests than the present one are Fenian Congress continues in Session at New York, but so far from harmonising the quarrels of the Brotherhood, it has only added to their intensity This Congress and its doings, and the effect upon our Irish population, have proved that England has absolutely nothing to fear from the American crisis Professing to espouse the cause of liberty, their conduct is too childish even for contempt Quarrels naturally occur among all bodies of men, but the woman quarrels are worse and more in excusable than any that have ever marked the misguided efforts of so many generations of Irishmen against 1 England V parcel of clow rib in a circus could not cut more ridiculous antics than these 1 engines, and it is this impression so generally made upon the American people that saves them from being oppressed by the strong arm of the law that they have openly violated the law is undoubted His suns and all or munitions of war collected in their jersey city arsenal, which was last week seized by United States officers, all bore the Government stump, and had been stolen from Government storehouses They were the nucleus of an expedition which the Germans had planned to invade Ireland to head which Major General Sheridan, of the United States cavalry, had, without his knowledge, been selected, and its departure on the mission of blood was only S rev enters by the fierce internal dissensions of the river Now, the 1 ennuis can no more raise such an expedition than they can fly across the ore in highly cr branch h max attempt it to farmers is the dissension, will be denounced to the American and British Governments The day of danger is past, and, as of any other mountebank show, the world can now gaze upon Fenian antics and, without fear, be amused The Congress has only developed the extent of the gulf that separates the fictions It endorsed O'Mahony, and at once the Roberts faction repudiated it It turned out of the Brotherhood every woman who refused to recognise the validity of ILS action, but the Roberts party defied it and threatened to call a new Congress to excommunicate the entire O Mahony wing The Congress, imitating one of the most despotic and unconstitutional acts of the Federal Government during the war, esta Wished n "Bureau of Military Justice, summoned the Senate and President Roberts before it for trial and commanded them to bring all their money and accords with them. The Senate deigned no answer, and Roberts wrote in reply that he would exhibit his documents if the Bureau would give security for their safe return the proposition was indignantly rejected, and the Bureau found itself without anybody to try, excepting the great Secretary of A\ nr, Sweeney whose brilliant proposal of the > invasions of England by the rival I onion factions I advised you of in my last Sweeney who made himself upon being " on the fence, was twitted and snubbed, and told that he had never taken the Fenian oath, was abused by O Mahony and treated in a manner quite insulting to so grand a strategist And, having done nothing for a week but fight, the Congress to day is seriously meditating an adjournment, considering all efforts at harmony fruitless Neither faction now receives much money, and as these continual squabbles are very costly both treasuries are in danger of bankruptcy and with bankruptcy must come the bursting of the bubble that has deluded so many of the credulous Irish I fervently hope the American Irish will learn a little wisdom from this list failure, and satisfied with their own freedom here will not have that enjoyed by the Irish at home taken away from them by the guards that meditated mv sion and in surrection require the mother country to throw around her Government "With the bitter cold weather of mid-winter The thermometer here on January 3 was 12 degrees below zero, a degree of cold not known for a century) come read reports of great destitution in the South It is estimated that fully 1,000,000 people, white and black in the Southern States are dependent on charity for food and shelter The freedmen s Bureau supports nearly 200,000 In Alabama 130,000 destitute people are reported by the Government, in Arkansas 200 000, almost the entire population in A drama 80,000, and so the sad record continue How they are to subsist Heaven only knows, for hundreds of thousands cannot be reached by any charity, no matter how well intentioned It is a fearful picture, one which we may well be pardoned for velling from the world the Government is repairing the lighthouses along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the Southern States by next summer all will probably be in order nearly 1,000 000 dollars are required to replace the property destroyed by the war Many valuable statistics gathered during last year continually see the light, and are of great interest the tobacco crop of the United States for ISOJIS stated at 166 707 000 lbs less by more than one half than it was in 1866 During the three months ending the 30th of September, 186, the silver mines of Jscvada produced 71,493 tons of ore, valued at 30 dollars b cents per ton, and producing silver worth 2 i 2332 dollars 19 cents to support the Nevada and other mines of the precious metals in the Western territories an immense trade is carried on across the plains Over t 000 000 dollars are invested in the cam ing trade by twenty seven firms and individual freighters, and they employ 5000 waggons, 7000 mules and horses, 8000 oxen, and over 3000 men During 1865 they earned 21,500,000 lbs of merchandise The celebrated line of " Overland Mail Coaches" has earned during the year 7,000,000 dollars, in specie, and iOOQ passengers The wine product of California for 1869 is estimated at 1 000,000 g unions Crime statistics are also heavy In New York in 126 5 there were 417 deaths by an order and accident The police report 221 concert saloons in the city, employing 191 " pretty waiter girls, and having vainly 10 000 daily visitors These dens receive weekly 12,000 dollars Two attempts were made last week to rob the Adams Express Company, an American carrying agency of panels And valuables by stealing wie safes transported from one city to another by the company As the express waggon was crossing the Mississippi river on the ice, at St Louis six robbers attacked the driver, but, being armed he succeeded in beating them off until aid arrived the robbers were more successful in their effects on the railroad between New Ven kane!

investigation of the processes going on in the body during health and disease have come into use the sphymograph, a contrivance for recording graphically the several movements of the chambers of the heart promises to be of infinite value in the diagnosis of cardiac affections and the thor mometer, whose employment is so highly recommended by Dr S Ringer, seems likely to afford most important results in the any costing tion of febrile diseases 1 he antagonistic properties of certain organs poisons have been pointed out by Drs Keen, Taylor, Moor house, and Mitchell This is a most useful branch of research, and bids fair to supply us with antidotes to poisons which hitherto we have been unable to counteract A case is sufficient to illustrate the Dr Taylor was called in to attend a girl who had taken a poisonous dose of laudanum The patient was insensible, it was some six hours since the laudanum had been taken, and life was despaired of Under the influence of galvanism, a poisonous dose of an other drug belladonna (deadly nightshade) w as now administered After a few hours, consciousness was restored, and the girl recovered, the strangest feature of all being that none of the symptoms of belladonna poisoning presented themselves It has been shown by other physiologists that Calabar bean and belladonna are also mutually antidote, and that tobacco and mix vomica have similar qualities M Berthas engrafted the tissues of one animal upon those of another, and thus has completed Hunter s experiments, by proving, through the medium of injected fluids, that the blood-vessels of the animal grow into the substance of the engrafted tissue Congestion of animals has been shown by M Pouches experiments to produce different results from those generally admitted No animal can recover after perfect constellation but if the cold be not carried below 32 degrees many animals may escape death The first efforts of cold are a durn nution of the capillaries and expulsion of the blood corpuscles and the secondary results are, rupture of the blood corpuscles, cremation of their borders, and isolation of their nuclei Dr Richardson has shown us how the life of warm blooded animals may often be restored by artificial means, even after the heart has ceased to beat He introduces blood heated to 100 degrees into the animal, forcing it through the vessels by means of a syringe, and in several of his experiments the results have been most successful Tin 1 FIRST FEMUI -Finn, better known in Ireland as rain M'Comhail, flourished in Ireland during the third

Ormond found his way to Brisbane, and claimed compensation from he representatives of the owners but they referred him to Liverpool, and he accordingly worked his passage home in another "Black Ball
