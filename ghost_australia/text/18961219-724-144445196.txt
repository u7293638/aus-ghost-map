Some ugly yarns isgoing about 'ere the the hist Say or two of sticking up cases.' ' Indeed.' 'Yes. We ain'tgotperticklers yet, but one of the ' cockeys ' (farmers) round here 'ad 'is cash collared and a revolver put to his skull this morn ing.' ' Oh I' was my somewhat nervous ex olamation, of which I was immediately after ashamed, and therefore putting a bold front on, rose and said ' I shall have to chance this I suppose, anyhow I'll make a start at once.' A suspicion haunted me, that mine host had set himself for fun, to frighten me, though he, poor follow was next morning shot dead by the desperado in question. ' Are you frightened of ghosts ?' he asked while I waited for the groom to bring my horse round. ' I really cannot tell for I never saw one.' I answered with as much pleas antry as ths shock of the suggestion would permit. ' Have you a ghost among your other curiosities then ?' ? I believe you, my, boy, a real stunner.' 'Oh I Whose?' 'Why the cove as Mother 'Erbert melted down. Haven't you 'eerd of this neither ?' ' No,' I answered with difficult calm ness, for I pretty well guessed that these shadowy gentry could not be safely regarded as sociable; beside I had enough to face without them. ? Why, I thought as everybody 'eerd on that. Well it's this way— but p'r baps you'd not care to 'eer it,' he sug gested, suddenly looking keenly at me. Oh yes, I would though.' ' Well, Mother 'erbert you see, used to run a shanty just the other side of Hell's Gate, where diggers often got mixed up with grog and bushrangers, very badly at times. This generally ended in the gentlemen of the road swallowing the digger, for more didn't than did, come out of the shanty all right. One rough night a lucky miner putnptherewhentheoldwitohwas alone He was drugged and robbed, then tossed on to the fire and roasted. The thing couldn't be sheeted .'ome to 'er quite, w ehe got off, but 'ad to clear out. Now it's ,a ram thing, bnt every anni versary of that there murder, 'as been a rough night, and the fearfulest' cries and 'shrieks yer ever 'eerd on, perceeds from that there ruined shanty. Nobody in these parts would fdfe them. I ain't a cove as fears much, bat 'ang me if I'd tackle it.' ' It wouldn't be pleasant, certainly,' I agreed, ' when is the anniversary V , * € just don't quite recolleot, though it's somewhere near now. I'll ask Bill when *e comes round with yer 'orse.' ? What became of Mother Herbert?' 'Oh, she picked up a cove in Mel bourne, who was pretty flush. He poisoned her and only got two yeareforit. [ say, Bill, what night is it the ghost knocks round at Mother 'Erberts? mine host asked the groom who ap peared. \- The 12th,' Bill readily answered. ? Why. that's to night,' I said rather staggered. ' By jingo so it is I Look here young fellow, take my advice and stop 'ere,' said the landlord with every appearance of genuine concern. ' You'd just get there about the time the ghost comes out, I'd sooner keep you for nothing than see you go.' ' Thank you, very much,' I said forc ing a laugh, 'but I don't believe in ghosts, and would not like the fear of that whioh my common sense rejects, to stop me. Good-night, rilohanoeit anyway.' And off I went, whistling while my entertainer was within hear ing, but subsiding rapidly beyond this, lor in 'spite of appearances, I was pro foundly disturbed, and fain would have remained .seoure from storm and goblin, at the Travellers Best, had I feared less the ridicule for timidity, I knew my father would then shower upon me. Although too proud to oonfess it, my courage was greatly shaken, the more so when I remembered having once be fore heard tif'flie horrors of Mother Herbert's hut, though, till now, its exact locality had been unknown to me. As.I rode silently -along the bush toad, these gristly stories' insisted in obtrud ing themselyea/flponmythoughtB, till the shadow of every strangely-shaped tree startled me.

Blackologfarttiroffily had to reduce the canter to a walk, for fear of missing the track in the dark. Trees- swayed heavily, and moaned wierdly in their agitation, while from the bottom of the valley , whioh I fdt was the dreaded gate, there rose the long, dismal, wretched howl of dingoes, the staccato notes of the mopawk, and the flurried cry of agitated curlews. Bats and flying foxes, hurriedly flapped Uioii- wnv nr-mKn the track, to spots more sheltered from the impending stoi»i, and preparations on everyhand seemed to be hastily going forward, for some uncanny event. At last the downpour came; immediately after a blinding flash of lightning, and a crash of thunder that appeared to split up the ebony dome above, lor a penect deluge of rain descended. A largo tree not fifty yards away, was splintered by the flash wbioh caused my terrified horse to rear and plunge, till I was thrown, but with the reins still in my hand, quickly rose unhurt. After some trouble my trembling horse was paci fied by my not less trembling self, and led past the splintered tree, for in the blinding rain and darkness I could not have seen my way from off hte back, therefore leading him, I trudged along the sloppy road, through the drenching torrents. At every Btep my courage weakened, for it brought me nearer to those places, whose associations were haunting, and even becoming a terror to me. It was with a sense of bounding joy then, I saw by the aid of a light ning flash, a bark hut on one side of the track, where Bhelter might be had. A nearer view revealed the fact that it was without windows or dhors, and evi dently deserted. Fastening my horse under the sheltered wall of the hut, I entered, and striking a match which the wooden box had protected from the rain,' I was gratified to find a short candle, stuok between three nails driven into a small piece of board. Fortunately too there was some dry bark clinging to the legs of an old bunk stand, whioh I used to kindle a fire in the Urge slab, mud-lined fireplace. Before ?taking off my things to dry, I unsaddled the horse and ooaxed him inside ; then hanging my soaking coat and vest before the fire, Bat down upon a small log near it, tired, wet, frightened, and extremely wretched. I bad hardly settled myself however, be fore the ashes of former fires became disturbed, and presently a Urge black snake wriggled out of them, and glided between my feet. As I sprang up, the reptile poised itself, and with an angry hiss prepared to give me battle. Darting to one side, I seized a reserve leg of the bunk lying near, and struck it a fatal blow. Carefully raking over the ashes, to satisfy myself ofinmunity from other like encounters, I resumed my seat with a sinking heart, trembling with chill and fear. As the fire sent forth a generous warmth, and the storm abated, tired nature tried hard to cozen me to sleep, but I resisted, though at times my eyes would close, and make dozing lfBcnltto conauer. The rain oeasinR, ultimately determined me to push on, and get past Hell's gate and Mother Herberts hut, as quickly as possible. This however was not to be done without another horrid experience, for upon reaching the doorway, a well known hiss startled, and two fiery beads peered at me, from without. Hardly ladlheard and seen, before a large black snake the (oompanion evidently of the one killed) sprang at me, and fastened itself to my flannel shirt collar. Catching hold of the tail, I tore the reptile with frenzied energy from his hold, by a jerk, the very vigour of whioh to my horror, swung him round my neck, and Btruok a deadly chill through me. I had hardly realized this, before he slid down my body, and getting beneath the waist-band of my trousers, glided round my leg in corkscrew fashion, to the ground. Never shall I forget the few seconds of suspense endured as in that decent, he coiled his cold, olammy body round my warm flesh, and then made off to the bush without delay. In the thiok folds of my shirt collar, I found his fangs embedded. After extracting them, I lost no time in putting on my now dry vest and coat, saddling up, and getting away. . (To lit continued.)
