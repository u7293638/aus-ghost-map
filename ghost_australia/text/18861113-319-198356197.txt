V.R.C. SPRING MEETING. STEEPLECHASE DAY. Saturday's gathering at Flcmington— the over popular Steeplechase day — constituted a fittingjmafc to the most successful raco meet ing ever hold in tho colony. The V.R.C. have taken mora money than on any previous occa- sion, but that is only a minor inoident of this splendid holiday. It is money of oourse that makes the maro to go at Flemington, as else where; but if the money elemont and tho horsey and the gambling comprised the solo, or evon the leading, feature of this annual festival, it would certainly be unworthy of all tho .attention it receives and the amount of thought and labor expended over it It is as a brilliant out-of-door diversion for over 100,000 poople that tho events of the past week commend themselves to evon philosophlo minds. The Molbourno Spring Meeting lias been observed and criticised by men of advancod positions in the world of philosophy and litera ture—men of .travol, accustomed to compare national characteristic and to gauze the iutelli- gonce and attainments of a coramunit T scrvipg its demeanor in its bura & ' ,v' pleasure and excitoment The S;., p?tho proyal which such critics havopmnOUn s' ap' well be satisfactory to us. Pro>iouneei may Those who can remember what the Flm.,i, , Racecourse was somo thirty voar«n jSlon contrast that memory with to-dav's oxiww- wlw will not ncod to bo told that the nce'! meetings and race meetings. In tho d»vn ?co tho grand stand, such as it wis occS?11 s We of tho course opposite to its presem 1, nL \vh.e,a .the Erect majority ol iho\u;t reached the.r destination by moans of Steamers; when tho racing commm,;,. river wild with excitement at the fact of n. v0IV South Wales horse, Veuo, boingbrought t? to run ono \ ictonan more, Alice Hawthorn m! named after a wondrous English !

From ,i" day. when the late Mr.Bagot first bea i ,c discern the possibilities of Flcmington to tho present time when Mr. Byron Moore, lying oil his sick bed, kept a telephonic grip of all tha arrangements for tho late mcetiii" and then camo hobbling on the courso each day to witness tho results which his a-tira co-adjntors had enabled him to secure it is im possiblo to compute tho amount of mental aud pli.vsioal labor which has achieved tho cxistine success. On Cup Day, for instance, no le=s than 2030 parsons, including the members of the police force, wore engaged upon tho course in the interests of tho club for tho public behoof It required a small army of 027 waiters to s"» that tho hungry and thirsty had' their wants satisfied as 'promptly as circumstances would permit. To tikethopubiic'stickets required no less than 150 gatekeepers. When, in addition to tho employes within tho limits ot the race- courso at tho time of the meeting, we remember thoso who diligently worked before hand to shape thdBo terraces and plant ' thoso gardens, to erect the stands and level tho lawns, to luxuriantly furnish and dccorato gubernatorial retreats, committee rooms, re freshment and retiring rooms, press aud tele graph ofliees, aud put in duo order the course, saddling paddocks and horse boxos— in short, to cater for so many human and equine wants, and whon to all this is added tho woik per formed throughout tho colony in furtherance of this mighty gathering, tho racing festival will bo lifted a little above an. ordinary pastime. Tho programme of races for Saturday, the Stooplochaso day. was, as has invariably been the oaso in previous years, a specially interest ing one, comprising as it did events for 2-year- olds, for 3-year-olds, a Steeplechase ot about 3 miles, a couplo of good liaudicnpg and n 3 mile raco. Proceedings opened with the Mares' Produce Stakes, for which thero were originally a good number of nominations. How ever, before tho 3-yoar-olda engaged were called upon to faco tho starter, the field had boon narrowed down to the very small one of throo— Volcano, Menotti and Lord William. On tho form shown by the colts at tho Cnulfield and V.R.O. meetings only ono deduction could be drawn, and that was that the raco would prove a moral for Volcano. The largo majority of backers took this view, and tho result was that Mr. White's gelding wont out a favorite at 3 to 1 on him. Volcano certainly amply justified tho good opinion formed of liim, for tho result of the race was nevorin doubt. Volcano leading all the way and winning with " ridiculous ease, Lord William filled second place— tho position, it may bo remarked inpassiiig, filled lay Arsenal last year — and. .as Mick O'Brien, who was on Monotti, did nob peree.vero- when ho iound his mount was not ablo to get near tho leader, he took third and. last. . place. Tho Flemington Stakes next claimed attention, and it afforded a good clioico for investment for those specula tively inclined, citherns hackers or sweep pro moters, thoro "being 20 "starters, llsdouin, Sumatra, Yolnian, Casuist, Oceana and Abcr- deon. woro nil. inquired, niter, and Har ridan, as- tho- stable companion ot tho speedy Hortense, also had friends. Hortenss herself was withdrawn, her owner, no doubt, thinking 10 6t. 1 lb. for a 2-year-old something beyond a juke. Iluntingtower, who was asked to carry 7 lb. less than Hortonae, also declined, and tho pen was run through his Ira", e. There was nothing special to nolo in tho race except the indifferent start, which was duo to tho iu- oxpe'rioneo of tlio stoods engaged, particularly Lord Carrington's pair, who woro very ill- behaved at the- post. Oneo tho lot were sot going thero was absolutely nothing in the way of a raco.to be seen by tho public. All the horses wero coming towards tliom, and it was only at tho la3t second, whon tho black jacket and groan cap of Casuist woro Boon in front ot every tiling, that visitors had any idea of whit was winning. Mr. Cooper's filly Oceana idled second place, and tha speedy Sumatra, witu Albert Loddon. ran a doad heat for third. 7ne winner wao amongst tho best favorites at e to 1, somo of thoso who knew him plnnKiria down somo money Into on. . After luncheon tns V.tt.C. Handicap camo on for decision. wore- 13 starters, Isonomy, Silvunttlne, «o- liomian, Dunlop'and'Ben "Bolt being ollf. ; thoso scratched on tho course. Even in in absdhco of thoso celebrities tho race was suu.- ciontly interesting and Britisher, Brown an Rosoand Claptrap woro each freely supportca.t pair first named having the call in tho lictti g market. 'Tho raco, however, resulted m a s - priso, for tho New South Wales j-year-oU __ Bravo— a 12 to ono chanco— got home, alter . excellent race, by a length in front of Bnti i Brown and Rose being third, aud Claptrap, , other favorito, fourth. A protest was ent against the 6takos being awarded to Bras the ground that his rider, Campbell, had Britisher "ovor" tho head with bis whlP , j straight Tho protest was duly considers by tho stowards who decided Qnj j Last year, it may bo mentioned, Bro , Roso.won the V.B.C.

Lady A6hton, who looked '"w weH snd had in M'Leod a rider likely to ,rW Ur'somewhat uudor control, was not backed, her price being about 6 to 1, "SteN'artvo, who also looked well, was at 5'a. » in the race looked fitter than the ?.S though Havelock and Curiosity wh looked pink. Tho last named in parti- re tar appeared very fit. Curiosity, from Ins is rolors attracted muoh attention, and as ho toW well and has before shown his ability to !,t oror tho l'lomington jumps he was not g1tliout friends. Havelock was backotl to win lied sumnt 8 to 1. The result of tho raco to show backers the folly of laying 5 to i ihit any particular horso would not fall, for ,-rorite, nftor.runiiiugin an oscellent third to Lady Ashton and Curiosity for about 5l milB. strook a fonco and came down heavily, Hiring only Curiosity, Lady Ashton and Native In tho race. Curiosity, when going very well, Ml over the fonco last but ono, and Lndy Mldon won from Native, both horsos boing done at the finish. Lady Carrington, lVick- lilTe Moonlight and Ilavelook oil fell at diffe rent limes, and two of tho ridors did lot escape without injuries. Koin, who Iris on Lady Carrington, and came- to srasaover the first fonco, was bruised and cut ibout tho head aud shouluors, but Cree, a woll known ridor, who-was on Wiokliffe, who came to grief near tho training sheds in the second round was moro seriously injured, and hod to be brought in by tho casualty van. Ho was afterwards removod to tho Melbouruo Hospi tal tvhors it was found that ho had boon badly injurod internally. Tho Canterbury Plata not the next race on tho pro- rarame, and it being a tbree mile ovent induced only a small field of four horacs, Tron- toa, Trident, Cyclops and Tamarisk, 'fronton iras regarded as a good thing, as his perform ances, so fsr at tho meeting, ivero considered superior to thooo of tho Derby winner. In con- Eciuenco he was installed favorite, at odds on, bis closing price boing 5 to 4. Trident was also freely supported, especially by tho Sew South IValee contingent, and ho wont out at 5 to 4 against him. Tamarisk cut out the running nt a groat pace, and when alio re tired about Hovcn furlongs from home Trident took it up nud was uuvor challenged, the favorito, despite his best efforts, never getting on actual terms with him. The 3-year-old tbns satisfied bis friends and showed tbat he was able to gallop over a distance. "It is a some what singular circumstance that tho Canter bury Plate of 1885 was won by Trenton, who on that occasion just boat the Derby wiunor, Nordeofeldt, who startod at .odds on. Trenton this year carried 6 lb. more, and had half a mile further to.go, the raco having liBen ex tended from tu® miles and a half to three miles. It is ulso noteworthy that Trident's time on Saturday is tho fastest three miles on record in this colony, it being 5 min. 25 sec., against the 5 min. 26 boo. record of Commot ion and First King. The last race of the day and ol the meeting was tho Free Handicap, for which 13 horses came to tho post, Lord Wilton and Kitawa being tho best favorites. However, the winner turned up In Hogmauny, a 10 to 1 chance, who was piloted by Hales, who got through just in tho nick of time, at tho entrance to the straight, and boat Lord Wiltou homo without, any troubto. This raco mado llalos's third iviu for tho day, and all that tho publio wished was that Lis later mounts had boon best favorites, as his first ono, Volcano, was.
