OUR LETTER BOX. TEAT FOLICS BCTAL G0MHI3SICN. Silt, — Nearly three weeks has passed by since - tiie 'Sydney Morning Herald' reported that the Premier (iir William L\ ne) told its reporter that a ' Koyal Com mission would be appointed in the course of a few days, to inquire into charges made against the Police Department, etc.' That being so, allow nie 10 point out that the charges made ngiinst the departmental management and maladministration are, in some instances, of long standing : hence, as Mr. John Norton was instrumental in forcing the Premier to admit that a Royal Commiesiou was necessary to inquire into tne charges already made, and to be made, 1 think lie should wake up tho Government to a proper sense of its duty, thus : — 1. To urge the Government to appoint tho Royal Commission at once. 2. That tho Commis sion should bo allowed unlimited power to inquire into all matters connected with the administration of tho Police Forco and .Superannuation Fund during Inspector Fosbcry's regime, yea, since lie aided Mr. Henry Pcrkos in raising tbo Kiama Ghost, if necessary. The sooner the Royal Com mission is appointed the better, and when it is appointed I do not hesi tate to Bay that startling charges will be formulated and submitted to tbe Commission for Inquiry and Report. I know for a fact that there are several members of the forco, cx- membcrs, and many of the outside public anxiously wait ing for the appointment of tho commisMon to submit tho charges and evidence with a f view to obtaining redress for injury and in justice sustained by them — at the instanco of police tyranny, etc. Hoping you will allow me space for tlicso few words iu your next issue. — Yours etc., LYNX. 9th July, 1900.
