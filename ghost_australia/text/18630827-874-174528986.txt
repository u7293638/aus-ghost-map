Of Love. Love is a great mistake, a stupendously-colossal delusion; Two hundred millions of people believe in it, as a sort of social Juggernaut. The notion is radically right, but its customary application is wrong. Mental constitutions, soundly organised, would be content to love themselves; But small-minded people bow down to the silly-souled worship of crinoline. Love is a plant that needs but excessively slender nourishment, And fondly feeds upon the atmosphere, and trustfully clings to rocks. The shepherds in VIRGIL were just the same as the shepherds of Mr. HUGH GLASS; They were fond of grog, they liked tobacco, but they loved the angel sex. Love is the universal passion, which ever takes diversified shapes, The love of money, probably, being its strongest form of operation. Love, in the common, conventional sense is our principal colonial ailment; And the Yarra-Bend Asylum is thoughtfully provided for the safety of its most deadly victims. Why ought the gentleman who prevented the spectral performance at the Royal from taking place to be prosecuted on a criminal charge? Because he made the manager "give up the ghost!"
