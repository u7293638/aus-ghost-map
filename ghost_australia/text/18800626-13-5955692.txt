THE MAY M AG A ZI MRS. Dr Elam is one of the ablest opponents of the scientific dogma of evolution, and he returns to the subject in the Contemporary Review with unabated earnestness, combat ing the assertion that it is anything more than an unenviable hypothesis, and asking for some certain proofs of its truth he asserts that nothing we know concern- ing organic beings lends any support to the hypothesis On the contrary, he say a History, observation, and experiment alike proclaim the absolute constancy of specific forms, varying, no doubt, in secondary and non essential characters to even an indefinite extent but never passing the limits of the species species being generally understood in this argument to imply a group of animals producing offspring continuously fertile inter se, and with the parent stock This is absolute, and without exception No one instance is known of the variation here implied An analytically critical examination of the novels of Mr. Howells, the American writer, by Mrs Sutherland Orr, is indicative of the writers acute judgment and delicate taste and these qualities are more particularly exhibited in her dissection and estimate of his story entitled "Al foregone

is himself a sufferer from that defect, presents us with a readable account of the most modern state of knowledge in regard thereto He began to suspect his own defective vision by mistaking a piece of red cloth for a green leaf in early boyhood, but he had reached the age of 30 before he was thoroughly convinced of it To the colour blind, he tells us, objects which to a normal eyed person appear red, green, orange, or violet, convey a false sensation, but they can receive accurate impressions of pure white, pure black, infinite varieties of grain yellow in a great variety of intensities com mations of these with the v gaieties of gray, blue in a great variety of intensities, and combinations of these with the varieties of grey As to the statistics of Daltonism, the average in males is about per cent, so that one man out of every 23 is colour blind , while among women cases of it are so extremely rare that they may almost be pronounced free from the liability to it altogether In an article on the ideas of the day, Mr M A Doudney writes as follows with respect to the political aspect of the times in the mother country -' Greatiathe Liberal triumph at this moment as a matter of working politics, but apart from the personal influence of Mr. Gladstone and others, where has the motive power of the change mainly come from It will not do to inquire too curiously But that the principles of Liberalism, as a creed, quite apart from all questions of ' democratic ' encroachment and 'aristocratic' resistance, are written on shifting sand just now, is too true Not that there is any want of plan or purpose there is plenty of both the ' kinetic energy at the command of a Liberal leader is immense , some of the plans and purposes will be carried out, and the sooner the better , but till the ground is partly cleared of one or two questions between those who want and those who have we shall be unable to range the ideas of the day on policy in any thing like logical order, and feel sure of our principles of action An erudite paper on the Mysteries of Lleusis, by M Lenormant, brings within a reasonable compass all that the most persevering investigation has been able to discover with respect to the origin, purpose, and history of those remarkable rites Dr Moxon contributes a tart rejoinder to Miss Lonsdale's article, in the previous number of this review, on the state of Guy's Hospital The doctor handles a quarter staff with deftness and dexterity, and he deals with the lady a accuBations seriatim, showing the greater proportion of them to be unfounded in the Fortnightly Review a Liberal addresses a letter of 18 pages to a political opponent on the Conservative collapse at the recent general election in Great Britain, dwelling with considerable emphasis on the fact that the force of the defeated party in the House of Commons, which has gone as high as 370, and which for 45 years had never sunk below 290, now stands at only 237 " This extraordinary victory," he remarks, " has been won by the nation against an extraordinary man .

He contends that " the Parliament of the empire should consist only of members sent for Imperial work from all its divisions equally, and that all local affairs should be relegated to provincial assemblies Thus he would divide the greater island into half a dozen and Ireland into three provinces, but in order to render the latter country contented and conservative, he insists upon it that her peasant tenures must be enfranchised Her grievances are agrarian rather than political To young ladies with nothing to do and to such we believe they have a mission- if they could only find out what it is wo can recommend the perusal of Miss Edith Simcox a article, entitled " Ideals of I can name Usefulness founded on the life of Dorothy Pattison, the daughter of a Yorkshire clergyman, who died about two years ago, after a life of practical beneficence as a member of the Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans The writer of the article points out in how many ways feminine energies may be advantageously developed and by what a variety of methods women may be helpful to their fellow creatures, and contribute to the building up of the fabric of civilised life Mr Leslie Stephens essay upon Buckles At tempted Philosophy of History is mainly directed to show that his great work was a failure, because he wanted that satisfactory clue to the bewildering labyrinth in which he plunged that would have been supplied to him had the " History of Civilisation followed, instead of having preceded the " Origin of Species According to his present critic a view of the matter, " Had Buckle lived into a later period, and absorbed the teaching of evolution, he would have found the clue of which he was in want, and might have successfully explored some part of the vast labyrinth of knowledge As it is, he has produced less solid work than many a man endowed with a tenth part of Ina abilities who had brought all his abilities to bear upon some narrow, definite, and manageable problem, and therefore really enlarged the circle of our knowledge Buckle representa- merely an aspiration for knowledge Lord Wentworth dissects the Settled Land Bill of Lord Cairns, and pronounces it to be neither practical nor liberal Mr W S Blunt contributes a recent page of Arabian history, and tells us that a struggle may any day) break out there between the representatives of barbarism clothed in European forms and civilisation, real and living, though strange to us in its Semitic dress In an article on the revolt of the counties against the Conservatives, Mr W E Bear explains the occurrence by stating that the Liberals are the natural allies of the tenant farmers, or at least of those who are in favour of agricultural reform and that if the Government will take up this great work in earnest, it will be stronger than ever in the counties in the North American Review Judge Black renews his onslaught upon the third term principle with great vehemence, and with equal sermon He accuses " the Grant faction of fraud, falsification, plunder, and corruption, and uses the following strong language concerning them and their candidate -" Sometimes they tell us that he (Grant is not only strong but faithful 1 faithful to what ' To his own breeches pocket, to the rich men who made him presents, to the carpet bag thieves whom he fastened on the Southern States to the corrupt rings that supported him in the North, to the returning boards who forged election papers to suit him, to the tools of the vulgar force which thrust his fraud down the throat of the nation - to all these he was faithful enough, but faithful to the constitution and laws he never was from beginning to end of his administration he was treacherous to the most sacred trust that human hands can hold Mr Leslie Stephens article on the religion of all sensible men leaves us very much in the dark as to what that religion really is He tells us that the doctrine of the atonement and of the crucified God is incredible and revolting, and he says, " I am quite unable to see that the cultivation of the masses has reached a point at which I will not say Catholicism, but-paganism is made impossible by the intelligence of mankind, but when he is asked what is to be the religion of the future he replies have not the slightest idea I am perfectly certain of my own ignorance, and I have a strong impression that almost everyone else is equally ignorant I can see, as everyone else Can see, that a vast and intellectual transformation is taking place and taking place, probably, with more rapidity than at almost any historical period, but then he is constrained to admit " the future is shrouded in impenetrable darkness Mr Curtis's narrative of General M Lelian's last service to the Republic during the civil war possesses little interest except for American readers , | but Mr Underwood s essay on Emerson appeals to!
