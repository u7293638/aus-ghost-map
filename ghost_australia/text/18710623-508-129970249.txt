The American Press on The Foreign Policy of England. (New York Herald, March 7) The Marquis of Salisbury, patron of eight benefices in the Church of England, and ex-secretary of the Crown for India — and the Right Hon. Benjamin Disraeli, who comes from an ancestry which knew not Church benefices but gave free offerings to an untitled priesthood, ex Premier and ex-Chancellor of the British Exchequer — made a simultaneous parliamentary assault on the foreign policy of Mr. Gladstone last night — the first in the House of Lords, and the other in the Commons. The argu- ment is the stereotyped one of the men who are out of office. "John Bull" has been insulted and humbled, and 'John' is in danger. The "foreign Powers are all contempuous to England," says the Marquis of Salisbury : "Prussia has declined England's aid in her negotiations for peace with France," and "Russia has repudiated obligations solemnly agreed to at the end of the Crimean war." Mr. Disraeli gives notice of a question which goes to show that he is convinced that Russia and Prussia have bamboozled Mr. "Bull," and that Count Bismarck has given Mr. Odo Russell a preliminary lesson in the science of diplomacy, the very initial letters of which asto- nished the British envoy at Versailles. We trust that when the Marquis of Salisbury delcared that "all the foreign Powers were contempuous towards England" he did not include the United States, for if he did, he is evidently mistaken, as may be seen by the reception which has been recorded to the mem- bers of the Joint High Commission in Washington.
