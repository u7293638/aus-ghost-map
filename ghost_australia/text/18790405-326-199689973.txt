A GHOST STORY. The following strange affair is reported from MacDonnell Bay in the South Eastern Star of March 7th: â€” "An extraordinary supernatural occurrence which is said to have taken place on the coast between here and Rivoli Bay is creating a great sensation here. Walter and William Carrison have been a work for some little time obtaining oil from the whale which was stranded 011 the beach. The other day they were out shooting in the vicinity and did not return to their tents till after nightfall. Just at the twilight William Carrison was loading his gun for a last shot when at once he heard a hideous yell, and turning his eyes in the direction from whence the sound proceeded, he observed what appeared to be a man of rather unusually tall stature making towards him. Carrison looked with a fixed gaze at the object, and it appeared so weird and unearthly that his blood began to chill and his hair to bristle. Oil it came, and as it approached yelled again. Carri- son then put a cap on his gun, and taking aim, fired at the object, which appeared to sink into the ground out of sight and left no trace behind. At the same instant Walter Carrison, who was about a mile from liis brother, saw a similar apparition, and, having his gun loaded and capped at the time, fired. That object, too, ap- peared to have felt tlie shot, and melted into thin air. Tlie people here believe the ghost or ghosts are those of some per- son or persons who have been murdered near the spot where they were seen."
