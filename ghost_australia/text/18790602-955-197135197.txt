THE HOLY GHOST IN THE CHURCH. Whitsuntide Meditation. The procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son constitutes no subordination of the Third Person in the Blessed Trinity to the other Two. It is an essential truth of the Godhead, as to which all the three Persons are co-equal and co-eternal, none being before or after the other, none being greater or less than another. But just as God the Son, the Divine Compeer of the Father and the Spirit, humbled Himself to His mediatorial work — for the manifestation of God's glory and the salvation of mankind emptied Himself of all His power, and wisdom, and majesty, and the very fulness of. the G-od,h(ead? t?Q. snake of the fallen creature man W* son §&? God, ready and able to do the Father's will — so 'sM)*God the Holy Ghost has bumbled Himself, not, indeed, to be incarnate, or to be a mere ministering Spirit, like the angels to those who shall be heirs of Salvation, but to be given by the Father to the God-man, to be hence forth His Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, to be given again by Him to His covenanted people, to form them to whom He is given into one body ; in that body to impart to each one of them gifts according to his measure for his own build ing up in faith and love, and for the building up through him, according to his ability, of the whole body ; to be the sustaining Life of the various ministries and ordinances of Christ's appointment, causing them, instead of empty forms, to be the channels of our continual supply from Him who is our Head ; to make the whole Church of Christ His temple, and yet so to dwell in that temple that it shall be Christ's presence with His Church which His operation shall effect ; to be in everything subject in the Church to Christ as a man's spirit is to a inan ; to witness in all His works to the Divinity and Sonship of the man Jesus ; and to say by every tongue that. speaks as He inspires that ' Jesus Christ is Xiord, to the glory 'of God the Father.' , ...... ,
