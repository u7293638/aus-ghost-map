Kisses and Kissing. The word ' 1H«« ' iM Aaiglo-Saxon, and may indeed be taketi as an in stance of how pleasant Anglo-Saxon can be. The , philologist! .assures us that it is allied to the Goth£c-' kustus,' a proof or test, and to the Latin ' gustus,' a taste, T^hich snjggests the old saying, that 'the proof of the pudding is in the preeinJuo't.' That same Gothic 'kustas*' comes from the verb 'Jrinsan,' to choose, from which one would imagine that ynnng the Goths Tri Fining went by favor.* According to Professor Skeat, writ ing with all the austerity and scholar ship of an expert, a kiss is ' a gust, a taste, a something choice.' Eowena, the beautiful daughter of Hengist, the. Saxon, is credited with having introduced lHpafng into Great Britain ; but had the natives been so utterly unenlightened, the Komans could scarcely have failed to anticipate her. The Romans had really a delightful word for a Mas — osculum/ Vhich came from ' os,' the mouth,; and meant a little mouth, a sweet mouth. : *fGive me a sweet little mouth,' would be the phrase used when a good little Roman boy asked his mother for :p, kiss. . Our 'RngHsh word, occurs pretty nearly in its present form in Anglo Saxon, Dutch, , Icelandic, - Danish, Swedish, and German, '^nd this is worthy . of note,' ljecause natural ^as kissing may seem to be, it is. a practice unknown to ±he aborigines of Austra lia, to the Maoris of New Zealand; the'. Papuans of New Gtunea,t£he people of Tabbati, the 'negroes of .Central and Southern Africa, the Botocudos of Brazil, the savagea of ; Teem del Fuego, Laplanders, and ^ffife^'fequi- maux.
