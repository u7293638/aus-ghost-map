VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB BRACELET MEETING. (Melbourne Leader, July 7.) The meeting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club on Saturday was one of the most enjoyable ever celebrated on the Caulfield heath, and in every respect must be pronounced an un- qualified success, the five races on the pro* gramme being productive of interesting con* tests, in which unusually large fields took part. In this respect, indeed, Saturday's meeting is distinguished as having brought together the largest number of horses (in the race for the Ladies' Trophy) that has ever started in Australia, no less than forty-two facing the veteran starter, Mr. G. Watson. It is worthy of special remark that this is within three of the largest field ever known in the world, when forty-five hones started for the Steward Gup at Goodwood in 1861. For a young dub like the V.A.T.C. to have achieved such a triumph is proof of the energetic spirit dis played by the management, ana Mr. Bond has reason to feel proud indeed of having inaugu rated the Ladies' Race, which, within the short space of one year, has produced a field of such phenomenal dimensions that it will in yean to come be quoted among turf curiosities in this and the old country. The sight at the start was one which will long be re membered by those who witnessed it. Not withstanding the presence of forty • two hones, Mr. Watson quickly had them going, and although the start was certainly a straggler, it is probable that no advantage would nave been gained by delay. Like a troop of cavalry, the two score and two swept round the eastern turn, and along the side by the sod wall it was impossible to distinguish any but those directly in the van, until nearing the home turn, where Transferred was seen to hold the lead, and the Caulneld colt having been well supported by the public, his victory was loudly proclaimed. The anticipation was quite justified until near the distance post, where laddington disputed the lead, but The Ghost shot suddenly clear of his field, and Batty, riding him home in most determined fashion, won with heaps in band by two lengths from Liddington and Trans ferred, who were second and third respectively. The time, lmin. 21} sec, is remarkably slow, and a score of horses in the race could, doubt less, under other circumstances, beat it easily; but it must be remembered that with forty-two horses on a six-furlong course, with turns, it is a case of close quarters, and not likely to pro duce any time-smashing record :— Thb Ladies' Trophy, for a bracelet, value ISO guineas. A handicap for two-yoar-olds and up wards; all horses to be nominated by ladles; the nominator of tho winning: horse to receive the diamond bracelet; the nominator of the second and third horses to receive trophies of the value of 15 and 10 guineas respectively.

Mr. Watson had a thankless task in trying to reduce such a big field to the dimensions of » fair start, and he seemed heartily glad to get rid of them. Transferred got a lead of three clear lengths. Dukedom, Mameluke, and Liddington also shared good terms. The whole lot came into the straight in a bunch, where Liddinrton and Transferred tried con clusions, but shortly after The Ghost came up with a rush, and, passing them, won by two lengths, Liddington finishing half-a- length •head of Transferred.
