One of the best afternoon's racing witnessed in South Australia for some time past was that recorded on the Old Course on Saturday after noon. The Adelaide Racing Club were cele brating the second day of their Grand National Meeting, and under most auspicious circumstances. The rain, which is so badly wanted in the colony just now, and which threatened to come on Friday, again failed to put in an appearance, and in consequence thoro was another large attendance. This in cluded the Premier, the Hon. C. C. Kingston; theChiof Secretary,-the Hon. J. V. G'Loghlin; Sir Richard Baker, and the Mayor of Ade laide, all of whom lunched with the committee. The fields on Saturday were large, there being only three withdrawals out of the eighty three horses coloured on the card— a splendid percentage. The raring was ©f a very interesting description, the contest in the Grand National Steeplechase provoking the greatest enthusiasm. Coming to the last jump ou the hill at the top of the straight nve of the candidates were so bunched that a blanket might have covered them, while Banjo was not more than three lengths off, and though the defeat of four out of this half dozen was proclaimed when they were in a line for home the spectators were treated to a most exciting battle between /ill Fours and Cataract, in which McGrowan and Mr. T. McFie were both seen to advantage in the saddle. Victory rosted with the mare, but the verdict was only a long nook. McGowan, who rode All Fours, received an ovation on returning to scale, while Mr. McFie's recep tion by the crowd was equally gratifying. Another item worthy of special note in connec tion with the racing was that owing to so many horses finishing together in the last race of the day the Judge was unable to place a third. There was no doubt about Fund being the winner, but it was extremely difficult to divide Alveary, Trentalto, Miola, Doubloon, and Electric. From the Press box Alveary appeared to be second, but Mr. Barker decided n)_ favour of Trentalto, and he did not hoist a third. Consequently the owner of Fund will receive the third money. The amount that passed through the totalizator — which ■was efficiently worked under the manage ment of Mir. G. S. Aldridge—was £10,874 10s. The official times on Saturday were hoisted simultaneously with the placed horses, they feeing exhibited from the Press box im mediately the first horse passed the po3t. The idea, which is an excellent one, was conceived fey Mr. W. Gordon, the dub's Timekeeper, who has invented a simple contrivance to supply the information. The whole of the wragements were complete on Saturday, thanks to Mr. 8. ft. Heseltine, while Mr. P. Cornelius waB very successful with the starting barrier, the youngsters in the Dequetteville Stakes leaving on their journey in a line. Backers commenced the afternoon well in the Solid tig Race, and public form was also verified. Doubloon, on his running in the Lightning Handicap the previous Saturday, stood out as the correct one to support, and with the assistance of Lake he never allowed the verdict to remain in doubt. On being sub mitted to the hammer he was taken to 80 guineas before he was bought in. Of this amount the 'dlub nettod 70 _ owner; of Conveajarattr dara&l; fals; iMMseahetMoottakn ijpari anvtbeJSewMMl:.; Hurdlellaoe, «d «tlh bim oii of Mm ma; Jlu^wasaruah lib get aatofliiflflriliii JQf. ; Stewart's representativB doubtless £»dh favouron account of his baring raflsecead ConiaTitianBratTattoraB.lJit|»atranr4ing. 7K only .Other oandidatee for whom tbero nsa really any money Sorifoffwaing van -Kahge. and' Howgidi Mr. Mun»y also »t*itodAViraaw»> n/tho4by the way, was mootmatiy described as , it'jnais oftthe official card, but be thought.; INalpa would win, bud badbod ban accord-; ingly. Whatever - nhanoa, however, the grey : aingbt have had—and, judging by toe result of : ihe tftoq, it must have boon agood one—was Bid^errt fortonatcly etoaping without in jury. After going out of the straight War rawa was taken to the front, and he remained there for thereat of the Joumej^ having'first Encounter and then Gipsy^ Quean cm cam- < panions. la foot this trio wereat the bead of the field for the last utile' and a quarter, and thfy filled the places, ; -Nalpa's brother beating the mate by a couple ■ of lengths. Gaillardia was running fourth nearly all the journey, buthe was observed to be in trouble half a mile from home. ' "Wirraw& paid a dividend of £2112s., but bad ■ Gipsy Queen or Encounter wen the amount, Would have been still larger. It was a eaiacs- \ deuce that no less than four hill-brothers took ; part in the race, Wirrawa, Nalpa, Gaillandia, ; aud Snowdrift all beingbySlilton from Alice, i Mr. Murray bought ^Wirrawa for£G aovs., but biB only euooess prior to Saturday was in a hurdle raoe at Fetersbing. It should be men tioned that the hurdles at this meeting were 1 securely fixed into the ground, aud they bad all to be jumped. Another surprise was w. store for backers an the Mayor's Male, in which the.situations were again filled by three outsiders, Those ware ' Hear Hear, who j umped off the mark first, aud, aided by his light impost, remained in front all the way, Mompa, and Princess of Wales. Here again it is noteworthy that the trio were in advance-of the field for the whole journey, Princess of Wales following Hoar Hear until the straight was entered, when Mcnnpa sup planted her. The Fulbam Park bred eel t won easily, and paid a dividend of £2216s. Bom bastic was the only one of the sixteen on the card who retired from the Grand National Steeplechase, Banjo starting in spite of ail the ; rumours that had been circulated during the week to the contrary. All Fours wasinstallod favourite, with Banjo next in demand, while Young Lucifer carried most money of the others. Fishwife Was the only one who made a mistake at the initial fence, but the second of the double in front of the Grand Stand proved disastrous to Doric, Confidence, and Wood field, their respective riders escaping injury in a wonderful manner. After this there was some capital jumping, and when they came past the Stand the second time tbo lot were on even terms, excepting Black Flag, who had stopped on thetopof thehill, after ha vingshaped very badly all through. As they negotiated the double at South-terrace for the last time seven of them were so closely bunched that they all bad chances, and making for the last jump on the hill it was almost^ impossible to divide Cataract, All Fours, Sir Goorge, Juliet, and Young Lucifer, while Banjo was close handy right on their quarters. Tbo last-nameu, however, toppled over the fence, and as soon as they had got well into the straight the defeat was proclaimed of Juliet, while two furlongs from homo Young Lucifer and Sir George had cried a go. This narrowed the issue down to All Fours aud Cataract, and as stated above a magnificent finish ensued. Up to the pickets All Fours ap peared to have the measure of Cataraot, but Mr. McFie was not to bo denied, and the grey resolutely answering the call made upon him MeGowan had to sit down'on the mare to got her home by a long head amidst intense excitement. Half a dozen lengths off Sir George was third, with Young Lucifer a capital fourth. Juliet and Simple Jim were the only others who finished, the last- named having presented a bold front for two miles and a quarter. The race was a very fast run one, the time for the three miles being only 6 min. 53£ sec., as compared with 7 min. 7 sec. occupied by The Actress last year. Dungan occupied G min. 58 sec. when he won the v.R.C. Grand National last July. In fact the time for the FJemington big jump-. ing event has only on three occasions been faster than that made by All Fours on Satur day. All Fours ran in the interests of Mr. R. M. Hawker, who purchased her after the last S.A.J.C. Accession Meeting. Of course her success meant that the fielders who had double-event books were all struck, Ccmven tioner and All Fours being one of the earliest combinations written by all of them. The ex citement over the Grand National having. subsided, _ attention was turned to the Dequetteville Stakes, for which odds ! of 2 to 1 were laid on Security. Backers won their money all rf'hfc, but at the half-distance they looked like losing it. as Taliesin appeared to wave the raoe won. C. Quinn, however, rode the Fid ham Park Plate winnor with excellent judgment, and with a splendid late effort he caught the half-brother to Bruin between the two Stands, and beat him by a length and a quarter. The big field of twenty were weighed out for the Corpora tion Stakes, and several of the candidates were fancied, Alveary eventually settling down a slightly _ better favourite _ than Thunderer, while Bridal Morn, a half-sister to Tradition, claimed the most attention -of the others. The winner was, however, supplied in Fund, who was credited with having executed a very satisfactory gallop during the week, and who returned ins supporters £9 !<>s. for each pound invested. Alveary, who looked a winner until challenged by Fund, finished three-quarters of a length away, in company with Trentalto, Miola, Doubloon, and Electric, Mr. Barker placing Trentalto second, hut refraining from hoisting a third.

They raced in pretty close order down the hill, and the first hurdle in the straight was negotiated by NaJpa and The Goose in advance of Gaillar dia, Gipsy Queen, and Bombastic, but at the ; second obstacle Grinsy Queen drew up almost level with .Nalpa, Encounter taking third place slightly in advance of The Goose, Wiirawa, : and Gaillardia. At the next hurdle Nalpa came to gridf, leaving Encounter to go on and lead past the Stand from Gipsy Queen and Gaillardia, with The Goose, Snowdrift, i and Bombastic showing the most prominent of the others, who were whipped in by Floodbird, The Golden King, and Barter. As they ran round the turn Wirrawa joined Encounter, and the pair drew out a length clear of Gipsy Queen, the mare being a couple of lengths in front of Gaillardia, with Snowdrift a similar distance away, the lost one at this stage being Mavis. The hurdle at the mile-and-a-furiong post was negotiated by Encounter and Wirrawa just clear of Gipsy Queen and Gaillardia, and then followed in a bunch. Floodbird, Snowdrift, The Goose, Bombastic, and Tho Golden King. At the seven-furlong post the positions were much tho .same, but running past the five furlong post Gipsy Queen joined Wirrawa and Encounter, tho trio being well clear of Gaillardia and The Golden King. Wirrawa jumped the obstacle qn the hili in front of Gipsy Queen and Encounter, and be piloted the field over tho first hurdle in the straight from Gipsy Quoen, Encountor, and Gallardia as named. These were the positions over the remaining hurdles, Wirrawa eventually winning by a couple of lengtlm from Gipsy Queen, with Encounter two and a half lengths away third. Floodbird was fourth, and Gaillardia fifth, and then twelve lengths away came Bombastic, The Golden King, and The Goose as named, with Mavis and Snowdrift following twenty yards in the roar.

Young Lucifer then took up the running, and he led over the first of the treble in front of the Stand from Banjo, Ail Fours, Cataract, Juliet, Simple Jim, Doric, Taradale, and Confidence as named, with Black Flag bringing up the rear, but the next fence proved fatal to the clranccs of Doric, Confidence, and Wood field. As they went out of the turn Banjo, Young Lucifer, All Fours, and Simple Jim were together clear" of Gataract and Juliet, and then followed Repe tition, Taradale, The Ghost, Black Flag, and Sir George. Running past the milo-and-a furlong post, Banjo, Young Lucifer, and Cataract, pretty well on terms, were making play, but Young Lucifer was the first to get over the obstacle from the other pair, whose nearest attendants were All Fours and Simple Jim, while at an interval of a dozen lengths camo Juliet, the last one at this stage being Black Flag. At the first of the doublo at the south-west corner Cataract had drawn out three lengths clear Of Young Lucifer and All Fours, the mare being at the head of Banjo, Simple Jim, Juliet, and Tara dale. The leader had not been displaced when they negotiated the second of the double, where the front division were well bunched; but there was a gap before Juliet, Taradale, , Repetition, Sir George, and The Ghost came in Right, while Black Flag juSt managed to crawl over the fence. The grey continued to make the pace running along the back, and ho piloted the field over the fence on the hill, where Young Lucifer was running second, with All Fours, Banjo, and Simple Jim, who were alongside each other, next, and then some lengths off came Tara- ' dale, Repetition, Sir George, and Tho Ghost in the order given, while Black Flag refused the jump. At the next fence Young Lucifer, headed Cataract, the gray being joined by AH Fours, Banjo, and Simple Jim. The first of the treble was taken by Young Lucifer and Cataract just clear of Banjo and All Fours. with Simple Jim, Juliet, Taaadale, Sir • George, Repetition, and The Ghost all well up and jumping finely. Young Lucifer just headed Banjo and All Fours over the stone wall, whore Simple Jim was running fourth in front of Cataract, Juliet, J Sir George, The Ghost, and Repetition. At the fence at tho turn Young Lucifer was out clear -of Cataract and AH Fours, and then followed Banjo, _ Juliet, and Simple , Jim, with Repetition acting as wbipper- j in, Taradale having clouted his rider ! out of the saddle. _ There was no material alteration in the positions past the mile-post, but at the double at South-terrace Sir George had run up just behind Young Lucifer, Juliet keeping the chestnut company, while imme- . diately behind them came All Fours, Cataract, and Banjo, with Simple Jim also well placed. Of this seven Simple Jim was beaten running along the back, but the other half-dozen were all bo close together a.t the last jump on tho hill that it was impossible to say at that stage what would win. Banjos claims, however, ceased at tho obstacle, as be failed to negotiate it, and when they got well into the ^straight All Fours and Cataract drew out from the other three, and a great race between the pair home ended m favour of AU Fours by a long head.
