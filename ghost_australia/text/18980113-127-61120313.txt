S SELECT POETRY. ANr ODE TO THE MODERN WALTZ. 'Tis a. jind of/mild gyration, .. 'Tist the ' Military Waltz,' A sort of marce funelre, mixed,. :With some very sudden halts. : As your:partner, vainly striving;. . To revolve, is furced` tostop;:i, :.And your manly arm is aching,: ? And you're nearly fit to drop. * While the moments are so melting, And you can't account at all, For the ponderous persistence Of the 'Fairy' of the balL , \Her weight is buit a trifle, If she steps upon the scale; SShe looks so like-a zephyr' * That you crowd on every sail.. . With a feeling of elation, With a consciousness of power, You go for twenty. yards at least, At forty knots an hour. Bat a deadly drag is on you, And alas ! your dream is false, i Foriyou find you have to wrestle This waltz, which isn't waltzing, But a dreary dull:parade Of automaton-like figures, Looking some what ' ready made. As they zig-zag,. slide and shuffle, Turn twice round, and then -appear As if they.' really had to stop,' - They telt' so very queer. Where is the old time waltzing ? And the waltzers; where are theiy 7 Here's a lady fair I waltzed with Twenty years ago to-day. ' We'll try a turn for ' auld lang syne,' She smiled; and took my arm, She. weighed aboutiFtwo hundredipounds, But her waltzing was a cliarm. Her form was somewhat solid, Yet her step was light as air, As we floated round the room I thus Apostrophised the fair. This is the good old waltzing, Thus in the days of yore,. I Our steps beat time to the music., On many a festive floori I could whirl for hours together, _ For your waltzing is just divin: Your weight like the ghost of a feather," S.Which I reckon a gracioussign. . Your styleis correct and, nonbe er, Then she sighed as she told;o: a',youth, Who said ' she waltzed like his mother,' And he possibly told the truth. -Frank Morbley;
