V. R. C. Spring Meeting. First Day, Saturday. The heat of the sun wsis tempered by a cool breeze, which rendered the weather pleasant for the vast multitude that swarmed Fle'niiugton. Governors Carrington, Loch, Robinson and Strahan with their suites, besides prominent residents from all the colonies, were present. In all, it" is esti mated there were 50,000 spectators, 27,000 of whom travelled to the course by. rail. The attend ance on the Cup day is expected to reach 200,000. The racing was not sensationally interesting. Hortense, despite her peualty of 141bs., won the Maribyrnong Plate cleverly, and with it some thousands of pounds go into the pockets of her owner and followers of the stable. In the race Lord Carrington's filly bolted and threw her rider. Ellis, the jockey of Volcano, asserts that he could have won the Derby easily had not he struck the rails and cut his knee whilst hugging posts too closely, as he was in front when the accident oc curred. Chesham, who was then pulling double, went on with the lead. Volcano, in falling back, caused Trident to lose ground. At this time Hales was riding very hard, and the excitement was intense as the cries went up that the favorite was beaten ; but Chesham tired suddenly at the half distance, allowing Trident to win by two lengths. Trident's win was received in silence by the bookmakers, who have lost heavily ; and should Mr. White's colt get home first in the Cup their losses will be enormous. Melbourne Stakes — Boolka and Isonomy ran a dead heat, with Bravo third. In the run off Isonomy won. Hothah Handicap— Claptrap) Hexham; Lancer. Maribyrnong Plate — Hortense, Huntingtower, Bedouin.
