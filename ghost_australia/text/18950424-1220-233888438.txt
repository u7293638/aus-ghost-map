Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jersey long stood . tenantless, and had the reputation of being ' j haunted. At last a young farmer and his j i wife moved in at a merely nominal rental. I An unearthly clattering on the stairs ' frightened tho couple half out of their wits . the first night, and the wife tried to persuade her consort to get up and investigate. For ) an hour he argued desperately with her on ; the advisability cf lyirg still. She declared that if he wouldn't investigate she must die ' or get up herself- Finally they effected a > compromise by creeping out of bed together. ( They lit the lamp and looked cautiously . out of the chamber door. The first glance , solved the mystery. Big gray squirrels literally swarmed up all the landing:!, aud; - ; every one of them has a big nut of .Boms ' kind between his paws. The main Rupply of 1 I nuts was stored in an unused garret, where 1 some tenant bad placed them long ago. Tho squirrels arranged themselves in gang£ on each landing, and those at the top of the J , house carried the nuts one by one out 01 the garret and sent them rolling down the ; stairs to the next landing, where they were j ' met by tbe gang waiting for them, and "' pushed down another flight. In this way ' they reached an :ld celiar, which was evi- , dently the tquirrels' Btoreroom, for it war ! well stocked with nuts. They were moving ' — from attic to basement.
