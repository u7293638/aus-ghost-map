And over oreg and eerpeatfien, And wild gorge where the steps of nun In chase or battle might not come, The mountain eagle bore on high The emblem o! the free of soul, And, midway tn the fearful Ay, Sent back the Indian battle-cry, And answered to the thunder's roQ. The wigwam fires bare all burned out, The mocassin has left no trade; Nor wolf nor panther roams shout The Saco and the Merrimack, And thou that lifteet tip on high Thy mighty barriers to the sky, Are not the haunted mound of old, Where On each crag of blurted stone Some dreadful spirit found his throne.

Not vainly to the listening ear The legends of toy past are told Talcs of the downward sweeping flood, When bowed like reeds thy ancient wood; Of artndd hands, and spectral forms; Of giants in their leafy shroud, And voices calling long and bud In the dread pauses of toy storms. For still within their caverned home Dwell the strange gods of heathendom
