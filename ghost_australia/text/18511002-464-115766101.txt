I answer, you never can ! you would thereby be imparting ?worldly knowledge to your children without that basis which is to make them good and virtuous citizen of the world, and to impart to them happi ness hereafter. Remember that the tenets of your Messed religion must be imparted with worldly knowledge, side by side, day by day, and that se cular knowledge long imparted, trusting to your instruction as parents who have to earn yourselves your daily bread by the sweat of your brow, is but to leave out the essential creation of happiness here and hereafter. I feel, while I am constrained by want of space, that you will not, and that you will fearlessly stand up for a fair apportionment of, the educational grant to maintain schools of your own, where those doctrinal points, and a due reverence for your holy and blessed religion, are dafly incul cated. Apologising for this laic intrusion on your timeand attention, fellow men, and to you, gentle men, for so lengthened a trespass on your space, I Ueg to subscribe myself, Your obedient servant, AGOG OS, Goulburn, September 27.
