A GLIMPSE OF THE PAST. I lie fleecp of the Australian sheep occupies such a prominent position in tlje . commerce of the world, a position which is very clearly de . fined in another part of this report, , that at least a lew words concerning the gradual, but sturdy growth of the pastoral industry of Australia are rendered essential. It is well known that the first seeds from which this vast trade has sprung ..were planted in this, the mother colony, In 1788 the first settlers Janded' on these shores,' not far from the site of the present hxhibition, ''witli oife' 'bull, 'foul1 cows, oiji&.~palf', ' one'stttlJioiij three eoits. three mares, . and ,a few sheep, goatg(:.'and pigs, 3 land sinCfl that year the pastoral in- -jdostr*', .wjiich .--for .;years'!ias:' ^jje'eii v appropriately designated the back? boite i»f our commerce, has grown 'fetea'dily; and is now vast in its prp : portions.

Jn,thdtjyear Captain Kent brought; from' ,, the Cape Colony a few pura ^rneijpino sheep. Thesb wlerl' distribri ted j be tween himself, tlhe fle^. S. ATaiisden, Mr OoXj and Mr John -Macarthur. The lot whicli . were taken jn hand by the; last- mentioned gen tie tnan must have taken kindly to the soil ; for, in 180 3, ; Mr John- Macarthur, who, it may be justly state'd, was the originator of the s- great' in dustry of the colony, took: some neeces to J^ngianu wmcn attracted some attention, and were instrumen tal in procuring him some tnerihoes from the then &med; ^ocks of George III, Mr Macarthur was farther' encountered by 'a 'grant of 10,000 acres. of land, and was, soon able to jpr6ve to the brokers 'of Lon don that New South Wales was a fitting home for tlie .merino. Re garding the sheep introduced by Macarthur, the' following' opinion by an old, colonist, will fihow rthat the breed has improved pinee.its intro duction. In ^'870'. he., writes : 'It was in the year lS2fi that I first saw these celebrated sheepj they wep injicji small dr}_ ^ Mi?~.3he . Australjau i merino of tlie present -day. ^ . . The ewes that I saw would not weigh more than from 30 lbs. to 34 lbs each.' These sheep were small, but they were compact, and bore very fine i)ut light fleeces. Thev lacked lencth and destinv. About 24 years ago the Camden flock was dispersed,, 'the estate being considered unsuitable sheep ; but 10 years before the disbandment Cam den sheep, were 4espafcbed to Vic- j toria, and :tli3se itis acknowledged by competent authorities^ did more towards improving, the flocks of that colony than all this other'* imported sheep put 'together. Several'of the early settlers spared neither trouble nor -expense in procuring sheep from the choicest flocks.of F rance;-*Spain , and ^ier many^l to ?hfiprovp^ie origi-i nal Sock.
