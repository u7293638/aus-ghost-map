WILLIAMS IN SYDNEY. When' " Willianis", first arrived in Sydney (says the :Evening'.Nevss of March 18) be was taken tip toy a friend'who originally came1 from the same part of England. This-friend took him to a boarding-houae at Middle-Btreet, Chippendale, kept by a highly respectable widow. The friend found employment for "Williams" at Tooth's Brfcwery; but this positson he did not hold long, as he quarrelled with his superior. He afterwards opened up a little business in Castlereagh-street, which abruptly ended' with his arrest for theft, and a sentence of six months' imprisonment followed. While residing with the widow he was always talking of hia "dear wife, Marion," who he said was in England, and for whose companionship he longed. This lady arrived in Sydney while " Williams" was in prison. He was accustomed to sleep with Marion's photograph beneath his pillow. He was remarked for his consistency' in attending St. Paul's Church. The widow - was eventually obliged to. get rid of " Wil liams," on account of his mysterious manner," and particularly for his whining oomplainings' that " a ghoBt haunted bi9 room at night time." On one occasion be ruBhed downstairs to his landlady, and, in a state of real or acted terror, said that he was intercepted on the stairway by "the ghost." It afterwards came to light that " Williams," who incidentally let out that the second name he bore at that time "Bailey"-was the name of his mother's people, stole clothing and other effects from the mate employed on the vessel that brought " Williams" nere.
