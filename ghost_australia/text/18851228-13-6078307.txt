BOXING DAY. Boxing Day has always been observed in this colony as a high holiday and never was recreation in its v irons terms more heartily or freely indulged in by the general public than on Saturday Although an extra half day was declared for to day it seemed to be generally understood that it would not be available for the majority of the working of Essex and S itutd by a holiday was kept as it no f uni or opportunity for relaxation would be provided until the new year The weather in the morning was dull and overcast and a few slight showers in faced prudent excursionists to take prep rations against inclement weather but did not so far as could be observed induce many to forego a days outing The rain which threatened until about noon held on the atmosphere was mild and apart from the anxiety that might have been occasioned the weather was pleasant and highly favourable for outdoor amusements Assn former years the catering, for le sure seel ers was on a liberal scale and the opportunities afforded ample for people e of all tastes Several thousands of people were v eil pleased to spend the day upon the Melbourne crack at ground watching the progress of the contest between the representatives of this colony and of New South Wales The local men were the first to but upon a perfect wick ed and so far is five made good use of their opportunities the score at present at incline,, at 245 for the loss of three wickets Numerous race meetings were held in different parts of the eden and were without except on well atte vided the Victorian Amateur Turf Club n eetin atCiullteld was a pronounced success the principal race-the Summer Cu) falling to Mr 1 Howles lei Horse The Win chelsea AAarmamhool Campbells Creek Pleasant Creek Ba Institute AA Wodonga and Baldwinsville Ballan ful 'Vacian dandah Races were all held under up parently favourable conditions. The Temperance Gala on the 1 Friendly Societies Grounds attracted an attendance of fully 10,000 people who appeared to enjoy to the full the various amusements provided for them by an experienced and liberal minded committee. The Oriental Fair and four nament at the Exhibition building which has been organised to raise funds in aid of St Ignatius Church 1 Richmond was opened by Lady Loch on Saturday afternoon and was attended by a large number of persons A Catholic picnic was held on the A\ icehouse men's cricket ground to which about 1 000 persons resorted and the athletic meetings of the Port Melbourne Sports Club and the Williamstown Football Club appeared to possess interest for goodly g gatherings Abundint opportunities were presented to those who desired to spend 1 their holidays down the bay and the anus ste liners which were despatched from the river and Port Melbourne were well patronised the seaside resorts such as Brighton Port Melbourne Mordialloc and Frankston were visited by large numbers of people and the excite sionists on the country railways were very numerous the railway returns showing a . favourable contrast with those for lusty car The Zoological gardens at theRoyal park and the Aquarium of the Exhibition buildings were also largely attended In the evening all the theatres and places of amusement were well filled I ILL INTERCOLONIAL CRICKET MA RICH The thirty fifth intercolonial match between the colonies of Victoria and New South Wales commenced on the Melbourne ground on Saturday At starting the attendance was barely up to that of some of the best of past matches but the gathering" swelled to satisfactory proportions in the afternoon Although rain threatens 1 in the early part of the day, matters improved later on and the day was agreeably cool so that the spectators did not need to seek the grand stand for shelter from either extremes of the weather the new enclosure notwithstanding had a very fair patronise the beaches near the fence which were a feature of the old enclosure were missed on his occasion by the many who had been accustomed to view the play from that point The wind at was one of those too perfect patches of turf that have become almost a monotonous accom paniment of matches played on the Melbourne ground and which make the best bowling simple and Ultimo corresponding easy the recent rains had deadened the turf just sufficiently to make it a bit slow and gave the batsmen a good sight of the ball without in any way assisting the bowlers Under the circumstances each captain recognised that the best time, he could do for his side was to win the toss and get first in to bat more especially in view of the variable weather recently experienced The grand stand and pavilion we e gaily decorated as usual with the legs of the associated clubs appropriate emblems of union against an old opponent Garrett had been elected captain of the Sydney be in a couple of days before the match and the Victorians on meeting chose Black hum as their leader The Sydney captain lost the toss and the difference in mere generally supposed to exist between the two teams was neither was fined by the piece of bad fortune on his part the Victorian captain of course electing to bat The Sydney men wore the light blue caps and sashes the colours of the colony in cricket as in rowing Bruce and Scott were the first two batsmen for v Victoria the former wearing" the dark blue sash of the colony and Scott his University colours Burton late of the Melbourne club ! kept well ets for the Sydney team and the bowling,, was started 1 by two of the new men Turner and M Clinclue Both are medium pace overarm bowlers turner leaving, the caster delivery while M Cluiehie is more 1 laboured and seems to try for an off break In his first over he sent a plum full toss to Scott who hit it straight to the chains After a couple of overs Bruce com monee 1 to bat freely and well some of his hits being especially graceful for a left hander Turner i kept a. good length his Boyle and Evans and was notpuuiahe 1 butM Clinclue was somewhat uneven and his ave! nee Butters from the first Garrett lost some runs for him by failing to stop an easy one at mid oil and then Scott showed his quid season cje an 1 band by dropping, neatly on a bill as it spun from his but to the wicket Bruce put his full weight into the hits and one e t Ins drives back to Turner was so fast that the owner could not stoop quickly enough to stop it with his hands.

The elephant and camel were kept busily engaged for three or four hours in carrying children round the wall and the satisfied expression on the faces of the youngsters after their novel bride left no doubt as to their enjoyment.

Gordon and Hennings have combined to set before us a series of pictures of remarkable beauty), some of which ought never to be pointed out Amongst those which seemed to most hit the public taste were the views of Adelaide, Hobart, Sydney, and Melbourne by day and night, in the prologue In the first act Mr Gordon shows us ' a stately pleasure dome ' such as Kubla Khan decreed in Canada, where ' bolt lustre bathed the range of urns On every slanting terrace late ' And for the interior of the palace he gives us a sunny transcript of one of the courts of the Alhambra In the second net Mr Henning introduces a picture gallery, in which each portrait has a living head, and where Mr Harwood on horseback makes some amusing allusions to an equestrian exhibition over the way, and to the limelight for which a professional brother is supposed to have a strong affection allusions which are received with roars of laughter Then follows the enchanted forest, composed of animated trees, full of motion and menace , then the king's palace, and finally) the Valley of Roland, presenting" a eli firming landscape, comprising some of the features of the valley of the Rhone and of that of the Neckar in combination with the mountains of Sw liner fund The wedding tour gives Mr Gordon an opportunity of conducting the young couple to a nice and his pictures of that city from 'an Giorgio, of the entrance to the Grand C nul, with tin Dogana and the Salute as its principal objects and of the bridge of the Kialla by moonlight, in among the happiest efforts of his pencil, and are the first sign we have ever seen on any stage The transformation scent, which is a sort of apotheosis of the Prince and Princess, watched over by then guardian angel, whose wings are outlined with electric stars, constr times a brilliant climax to the foregoing , the comic business which follows bung accept ably short, so that the performance tir minutes at a quarter past 11.

The management in order to be in accord with time honoured custom, abandoned the minstrel entertainment, and produced a musical burlesque on titled " Adonis " The piece is really an in version of Gilbert's delightful drama of ' Pygmalion and Galatea." Taltnea. a sculptress, is supposed to have carved a statue of Adonis of such beauty that she has become enamoured of it, but unfortunately, before her latent passion becomes developed she sells the figure to the Duchess of Area as it is only when she has to part with it that she becomes aware of the extent of her love in her des] or she appeals to the gi dress Arten to assist her by an lowing the Static with life. The Goddess finally con- suits on the condition that Adonis shall select between Tanner and the Duchess. Adonis is of a practical turn of mind and therefore the love of his Creator is out weighed by the substantial advantages which the Duchess offers him Borne off in triumph by that lady li graduates in worldly guile under the tuition other four daughters who pose as professional 1 critics But Adonis has a rival for the affections of the Duchess in the M irons defence that the polished v villain of the piece.
