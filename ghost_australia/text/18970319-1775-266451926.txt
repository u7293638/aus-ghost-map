TRUE GHOST STORT. This is a tnie'gbost story of an unconventional kind. A young lady arrived late at night on a visit to a friend.» 8he' awoke in tbe dsrkneiia to find a white fignre at the foot of the bed. While she watched, the bedolothes ware suddanlv whiskod off, and ths apparition venishBd. After an anxious "not t« say chilly night the visitor went down with little appetite for breakfast. At the table she was introduced to a gentleman, a very old friend of tho family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. 'I hope yon will exouse me,' be said to the hostess, 'but I found it so cold during the night that, knowing that ths room next mine was unoccupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off .the bedclothes to supplement my own.' The 100m, as it happened, was not unoccupied, but he never learned his mistake.
