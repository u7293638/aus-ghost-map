A GHOST STORY. According to a report received from Blayney, some consternation has been caused among the miners at the copper mine by the visitations of a ghost. In one of the shafts the men hear strange noises, bells ringing, sighting and groan- ing and the miners going below have their candles extinguished by a sup- posed supernatural visitor. Some six men have left the mine owing to the terror the ghost has inspired.
