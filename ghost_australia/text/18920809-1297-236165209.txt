A report from Wellington, dated July 26, cays : — " The- Wnirarapa, which arrived from Sydney via Auckland, Gisborne and Napier this morning, experienced the full force of tho recent southerly gale after leaving the latter port ou Sunday. Some idea 01 the force or the weather may be imagined, when it is stated that the steaming rate averaged about 4'3 knots per hour, whilst at one stage her rate of progress was not more than about three- quarters of a knot per hour. No damage was suffered by the vessel. The Wnirarapa seems particularly unfortunate as regards weather, for not long ago it. look her 52j hours to do the trip from Napier." MONTHLY SHIPPING REPORT.

A DISMASTED VESSEL— REPORTED BOUND FOR NEW ZEALAND. The Danish barquo Aahrns, 640 tons, Cap tain Grann, which has arrived at Perth (W.A.), reports that ou June 3, in latitude 4-ldeg, aud long. 56deg., he spoke an English vessel which showed the signal flags ND11G.

All tho boats had been swept uwayt and the captain signalled that he wished Ins condition to be reported to Lloyd's agent. He also wanted a boat, which Captain Graun endeavored to givo him. Night camo on, however, and the wind being north-west and tho barometer falling, tho Aarhus had to shorten sail for tho night. At midnight the wind came to tho westward, aud at daylight no traco could bo 6ccu of tho dismasted ship.

Tho Collector of Customs at Western Australia forwarded this news to the Collector of Customs at the Thames for his information. Inquiries were instituted at tho Thames, but so far aa could bo ascertained no one there knew anything about such a vessel.
