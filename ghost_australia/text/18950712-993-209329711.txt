Bad Company, or Bad and fl«mom-a Legend of Port Augusta* the old Bj BOBKBT BBUOE, author of 11 Echoes from Coondambo," ice. (Written for the Dispatch). Tn the early days of Port Augusts there lived in it a jolly old bachelor, familiarly known as " Daddy," a man of good family and edncation, who, attracted i y the gold discovery in Victoria, had emigrated from the old country thither, but proving unsuccessful in the search for the precious metal, lad tried a multitude of avocations in various places tiD he had at length found himself in the scene of our story, the principle salesman of the first store of the place, and at the same time the honored guest, or rather lodger, in tbe best hotel. Dad was a man of about 50 years of age and bad a pair of very bright black espial •yes, with eyebrows of the same color, while his flowing beard and fine curly head of hair exhibited the silvery tint that marks the ripening of the human harvest for the eickle of the great reaper. Our friend had been very handsome in his youth, and indeed was still remarkably good looking, besides which he was the tidiest and best dressed man in the North ; his linen was always spotlessly clean, while it's wearer looked as cool as a encumber even with the thermometer at 110 degrees in the shade; indeed it was quite astonishing to see his shirt collars gleaming crisp as a snowdrift when those of other people—who chanced to possess similar badges of civilization—had resolved themselves into shapeless masses of discolored pulp, while at the same time thoee persons would leave a damp patch on anything against which they might chance to lean. ThiB state of affairs was the more surprising as Dad rarely retired in a state of sobriety to hiB virtuous couch, certainly our friend took nightly far more tban, people said, was good for bim, and yet when the store was opened in tbe morning there was Dad,as he himself said, "Freeh, as paint," and cheery as a cricket. This, however, was after he had gone through a course of matutinal ablutions, in which he sluiced himself like a hot elephant in an African waterhole, and scarified his cuticle with a particularly vicious looking array of flesh brushe?, for in the matter of cleanline&B; Dad was most fastidious, and often got into trouble with his landlady owing to the quantity of water he used, or as she said wasted, for be it understood that that necessary fluid had to be carted (brackish) five miles and fresh fifteen, so that it was a costly article in those days. Dad had been a regular lady killer in his time and still, like " Nell Cook's master the Canon," had a "merry eye" which could assume at pleasure a sly wink of marvellous wickedness while his tongne was tipped with the delicate honey of compliment. No wonder then that tbe counter over which he presided was always besieged by appreciative fair ones, young and old, eager to have a little spicy banter with the old villian who, I am Badly afraid, did, when opportunity offered, squeeze their sunburned fingers under cover of the parcel of goods he had had the pleasure of making up for them, and this might acconnt for the large amount of giggling which uBually marked tbeir shopping. To the masculine portion of the community Dad was an overflowing epitome of information, that he was always anxious (often too much so) to impart from his store of anecdotes which, like everything else about him, manifested a strong spice of the devil. Very queer indeed were some of the sloiies he told to hfefriendt, that is to all the male inhabitants of the Northern portion of the district of Flinders. Stockowners, overseers and stockmen would all 6eek out Daddy immediately on arrival in the Port, as a master mariner would its beacon light, if it had one; in fact Fort Augusta would not have been complete without him. His chief crony, however, was the husband of his landlady, whom perhaps we should style his landlord, but the bustling, thrifty wife was the commanding 6pirit in the house for her better half, and shone more in getting on with bis customers than in the management of the business, and report did say that he was rather a gay lothario when out of the " good woman's" sight. Often of an evening would Bob and Dad sally forth in a light American trap, to the flourishing township of Stirling North, which is situated on the sandy salt bush plain that intervenes between the bead of the gulf and Flinders Bange. It was four and a half miles from the Fort by the rather precarious and dangerous track across the lagoon (which at that time was without the fine cauBeway which now crosscs it) or six miles by the more circuitous route round the head of it. Stirling North owed its origin to the fact that water, which animals would drink when forced to, .had been obtained there by a human benefactor of tbe name of Minchin in two wells yielding a limited supply of pickle, and as this township was the nearest point to Port Augusta at which teamsters could water their cattle, the nomads in question naturally made it a point of camping there in their journeyings to and from the interior, the consequence being that tbe inevitable publicans hastened to the scene and ran up hostelries bearing such signs as the "Traveller's Rest," the "Bushman's Home,"£c. Blacksmiths and other tradesmen followed till " The Welle" was quite lively place, boasting of a pound and also a " Humbug Society," whose members' chief aim in life seemed to be to get drunk at the expense of visiting bushmcn with more money than brains, and, as some of tbe arch humbugs were also great bullies, numberless scrimmages took place, not always ending in favor of " the Great Sham" or " Bouncible Bam," for they sometimes caught a tarter, who, in place of providing them with free beer, would, in the phraseology of the P.B., tap a copious supply of their claret. Dust, heat, flies, and odours of stale tobacco smoke characterised " The Wells" during the day, fiddling, dancing, drinking, ic., the night ; those saturnalian orgies cea-ing at periods in the small hours of the morning—the exact time of which had generally escaped the memories of the revellers when the scorching rays of tbe morning sun and the flics drove them, with mouths like gas furnaces, to the nearest bar for a hair from the tail of the dog that had bitten them over-night What part Dad and Bob took in those simple festivities, or how they strove to cheer the disconsolate wives of absent bushmen or teamsters, who lived in queer little one and two roomed hovels, I shall not here endeavour to explain, but merely state that their pious friends said they went there too often for their own good ; this view of the case was certainly taken by the worthy Bob's wife, who often emphatically stated her disapproval of Bob's conduct, in many a curtain lecture, delivered in the cool of the morning, when the delinquent would fain have slumbered. These marital exhortations felt not on Bob's ears alone, but generally on those of an eaves-dropping crowd, assembled on the outside of the slight weather-board wall of their dormitory, to be afterwards retailed, with sundry embellishments to the general public during tbe day ; in fact, the callous Bob often made them the subject of wicked jests to his grinning customers over the bar, and thus drew down on his devoted bead a fresh torrent of invective from his long suffering spouse, who might as well, however, have pelted an ironclad with peas, «o little effect bad her expostulations on the culprit. Bob was a strong, healthy mm, in tbe prime of life, but, as often is the case with such people, a severe illness carried him off very suddenly, to the regret of all the Port Augustans, by whom he was much liked. Dad, in particular, showed his sorrow by getting extra tight for what he considered a decent term of mourning, but grief, like the proverbial donkey's gallop, and all else pertaining to frail mortality, is fleeting, and seldom leaves a shadow behind, so-Dad speedily returned to his nocturnal visits to " The Wells," and oyster suppers— when thoee delicate bivalves were obtainal le, while, if he did think of Bob at all, it was merely when in urgent need of a trusty coadjutor in some scheme of mischief. It was freely reported that Dad and the widow Bob entertained a sort of platonic affection for each other which prudence, on both sides, alone prevented from ripening into a matrimonial alliance, the lady fearing that Dad would too materially dwreaw tbe stock in trade and alio too impartially share his smiles among her fair neighbors and herself, and he, thinking that tbe lectures which had amused him so much when Bob was tbe recipient of them, would not be so entertaining when delivered for his own special benefit. Besides, he was not nearly so powerful a man as bis departed fiiecd had been and he feared that the disconsolate relict might not confine herself to words in his case. She could, would, and had often pitched the surliest bullockdriver out of the bar when reasons required —and BO they altered not their state. To pave the way for an uninterrupted narrative when my subject shall have become exciting, I will now describe pour Bob's last resting place in the Port Augusta cemetery, which is—or rather was—behind the high drifting sand hill that shuts in the town on the eastern side and runs parallel with tbe head of the gnlL In this once silent and solitary place, which, at the time of my story, was enclosed by a primitive post and wire fence, no grass grew, but in the place of that its area was thickly covered with salt and blue bush, dotted here and there with a few melancholy-looking myall trees round which were clustered the neat, white painted, wooden enclosures which guarded the last homes of the early pioneers of the district, the newest monument being that which bad been recently erected by Bob's sorrowing survivor over him—whose faults were now forgotten, or at least lovingly remembered to hand his virtues down to posterity. A short cut to " The Wells" ran past the white painted cemetery gates; this short cut however, was liitlo nsed owing to its sandy nature, which rendered it unfit for heavy traffic, but for Dad's stable-fed pony and light trap it was practicable enough, hence his frequent use of it. 1 have men tioned this short cut, as some of my characters may shortly traverse it in too great a hurry to permit of any description of scenery or locality to be given at the time when lightning pen would be needed to keep pace with their progress. Well, one hot evening in February (recollect we are in Australia), just as the mo;quitos were beginning to tickle the cuticles of the noisy crowd of bathers disporting themselves off the ends of the two jetties, regardless of the fact that it was still light enough for their primiiive state to call the mantling blush of modesty to the cheeks of the thoughtless fair ones who might inadvertantly wander too near: Daddy, in his old rattling trap, trotted up High-street on his way to Stirling at the same time exchanging words and winks with all and sundry of the inhabitants, who lounged on the side walks, talked scandal with tbe postmaster, or indolently recliniug under their verandahs, puffed the soothing cloud and meditated on the mutability of all sublunary aff<iir«. On Dad jogged and in due time arrived at " The Wells," where he pulled np in front of the " Travellers' Best." His pony was quickly taken round to the stab'.e by the grinning ostler, and Dad entered the bar under a running fire of friendly greetings from its highly respectable but ragged occupants to whom be " shouted all rouud" and then made his way to tbe long room where a weary fiddle and a piano lament' ably out of tune were discoursing sweet music, it was evidently a good night at ' The Wells." Daddy, who was received with acclamations by the revellers, plunged at once into the giddy whirl of festivites goiug forward, which festivities consisted principally of most vigorous, if not graceful, dancing varied by hearty potations at brief intervals, said potations being necessary for the maintenance of the streams of perspiration flowing freely from all the votaries of the light fantastic goddess there assembled. It was indeed a gay and festive entertainment patronised as it was by all the rank and fashion of the Wells. There the red nosed publican went the pace with a tall and graceful grass widow who wore an artificial wreath of orange blossoms on her pale aud aristocratic brow. Her husband was at the time enjoying a long stay in Adelaide at Government expense. Near them whirled in the mazes of the waltz the modest and retiring schoolmaster, embraced and supported—but mostly embraced—by a stalwart young stockkeeper in top boots and breeches but minus coat and vest; there a bearded bullockdriver, pipe in mouth, attired in the dingiest of check shirts, moleskin trousers and hobnailed boots, had to content himself with a brother teamster for a partner; while a tall, blackeyed young station-owuer kindled the rasing fires of jealousy in more than one manly bosom by entirely monopolising the blooming public house drudge. The ladies all lavished tbeir sweetest smiles on Daddy, and so he found no lack of partners, with whom he ogled and drank in a manner peculiar'y his own ; while a half tipsy swagman leered at the shoemaker'6 wife, and some members of the Humbug Society badgered a shepherd iato standing unlimited driuks. It was a truly arcadian revel and was greatly enjoyed, not only by the dancers but by a circle of smokers, who, seated on forms round the sides of the room, freely criticised the couples capering under the blue cloud canopy they themselves were providing; while one or two bacchanals, already overcome by their exertions, added an intermittent bass accompaniment to the music. But time, with that swift but stealthy pace which characterises bis progress when mortals are under the delusion that they are enjoying themselves, had reached the small hours of morning, when, like "Tam O'Shanter," "Dad maun ride," and 60 his trip was brought round to the front of "The Traveller's Best" and Dad was assisted into it by the equally unsteady landlord and ostler. After sundry returns to the bar for final doch-a- darrachs, Dick received his head and a 6harp cut from the whip, and Dad vanished into t' e darkness, folio wed by a running fire of farewells, and would hav^ been in the Port in no time but for the adventure 1 am about to relate. The night was extremely dark and Dad had no lamps, but Dick knew every inch of the road and could have found his way to the stable blindfold if required to do so, but he now whirled the light trap aloug at an exceedingly merry pace, his master swaying about solemnly possessed by a confusad determination not to be drunk; but ah 1 what was that! Dad fancied he could he-r the 6ound of wings, but persuading himself that it was orly an old morepork flitting around he mused andibly, "the little pussies were a6 frolicksome as ever." " Ah 1" ejaculated a sepulchral voice close to his elbow. " Who are you, and what do you want old bird,"' hiccoughed Daddy. " Ma certie 1 I maun becheenged," mournfully returned the voice, " an" ye no tae ken me, Dad ?" Well," replied Dad " There's not much of you to know by this light, though your voice does sound like my departed friend Rob's; but he'6 dead, poor old bird, and so you can't be bim ; however, if you are going to the Port, just jump up and have a ride." " I'm reight enough the noo man ; sai gang alang we ye," replied the voice, close to Dad's ear. This having rather an uncanny smack about it, Daddy grouped hastily around with his right hand, but catching nothing, he pulled Dick up, looked as keenly as he could at the time, on either 6ide, then over the back of the trap : when, perceiving nobody, he concluded that some larrikin was playing him a trick, and so he " whipped behind," but struck nobody. Dad's maneuvers, though unsatisfactory to himself, provoked an amused chuckle from his mvsterious visitor, and Dad would have alighted to have v out with whoever it might be, but something held him with vicelike tenacity to his seat, yet without his beiag conscious of what the detaining power consisted of, and Dad, though a brave man, began to feel his hair lift his hat from his head, and some beads of perspiration starting on bis forehead. "Weel,"said the voice presently, "if this is boo ye treat an auld friend, I'm ay sorry I troublet ye, but come noo, ye were sayin' they wee pussies at " The Walls" were brawlie; but boos the auld leddy at hame ? Ech I ye sly dog ; but gie Dickie the whup, man, and then we'll just crack as we gae. Ech, sirs, I was at yer oxter, when ye an' the auld wumman were conseederin' as to hoo wud get ma auld claes, but ye misdoubted muckle ; ye's a-gotten the hale suit, but just be minus o' the breeks, for she aye liket to wear them hersel',and she misdoubted there'd be tin in the profeets, an' ye should get yer haund in the till tae take the siller wi' ye ta the limmers o' Stirling. When ye were na that fou' but that ye could gang abroad 1 0 aye, ye'd bae faund yereel' in a gey hot nestie " Here the voice dropped it tone of banter, and owned, monrnfully, that 8 even his sultry old connubial crib waB "more pleesant than the cauld bit corsie aneath the ground he bided in tbe noo." Of course Daddy could no longer doubt that it was his old crony's essential essence that perched so lovingly beside him, and, knowing well its amiable tendencies when inhabiting a mortal tenement, so be began to feel quite at his ease in its company, and therefore started Dick again, but was not quite comfortable when the ghost agaia began bantering him on his oglings of the widow, and eo he tried to turn the subject by inviting it to take a drop of spirits out of his flaBk, not thinking at the moment as to where it could put it. " Speeret indeed," answered the ghost in a crabbed tone, " I've too muckle Bpeeret aboot me the noo, and gey little meeteerealism if ye coon't na ma' teugh auld reib, that ye wantit tae appropriate ye sly tod ye 1" Here Dad recognised the fat chuckle that Bob used to emphasise with a dig under his auditor's waistcoat pocket, and so be knew he was receiving a ghostly dig in the ribs now. Dad tried another subject, and began commenting on the blooming appearance of the grass-widow, par excellence, of the Wells, but his observations were received by the ghost with a melancholy groan, which made him feel quite sorry for it, and so he Baid, " Do have a drop of spirits, Old Bird, it will do you good 1" " Speerets," cried the ghost with sudden energy, " ye'll hae ower muckle o' them afore ye can cry cruse I Ech, man, gie me thae ribbins an' ye lay iatil auld Dickie wi' the wheep, an' maybe we'll dang 'em off yet 1" Dad did as he was biddeu, quite forgetful of the fact that ghosts have n > hands, nor did be notice, in his hurry to \v!iip up Dick, that the reins bad fallen under the pony's heels, who, startled no doubt by the thousands of gleaming eyeB Daddy now perceived were shining around them, applied his hind shoes to the splash- board and, as his master after- wards said," went like the devil." How the wind whistled round Dad's ears as the curricle tore through the darkness like a runaway train to certain destruction, climbing over banks, diving into hollows and smashing through bushes, for Dick was now galloping in circles, evidently fully aware that uncanny things were in hot pursuit, and so to keep up a proper pitch of excitement he extended at intervals a hurried tattoo on tbe now much battered splash-board with his heels, pretending each time to be stariled out of his seven senses by the noise. " Whare ye gaun, ye fule, Daddy 1 Canna ye keep til the track 7 Thae evil 6peerets '11 catch ye an ye's no mind 1" Well!'' cried Daddy, disgusted with the inc-insistency of his friend, " you would have the ribbonds, but if 1 had only been up to your little game I'd have taken care to keep them in my own hands But there, it's just like your impudence to blame me for your own had driving so just hand over the reins aud I'll soon show you how to distance 1 " Don't blatherskite in that fashion," growled the ghost, " but keep the wheep goin" 1" The springs of the vehicle, evidently infected by the general excitement, had long ere this resolved themselves into a pair of double-actioned lightning elevators, with the evident intent of whirling Daddy into space, but that worthy clung to the sides of tbe buggy with the tenacity of a limpet to a rock, or needy spendthrift ne'er-do-well to a rich old bachelor uncle, and though he was too violently shaken to reply to the ghost, he thought he could recognise—in a white object they weie rapidiy approaching—the white gate of the cemetery, aud at the same moment his companion hurriedly exclaimed, " Ye've just saved ma bacon, Dad, for they'll no catch we the noo ; tak ye guid care o' yersel or may be theyse net you ; fare thee weel." Dad felt that the ghost was gone, but, at the same time, he heard the rushing of millions of wings, and felt a crushing sensation SB if a mighty whirlwind had rushed downward npon him, aud was flattening him to the earth, while Dick, evidently distraught by the infernal commotion, finished the splashboard by a supreme effort, and Dad knew no more. Next morning, when the store carter went early to feed the horses, he found Dick— dead blown and reking with sweat—waiting at the gate to be admitted, haying evidently done the best he could—in a salvage cense— by bringing home the shafts of tbe trap, which he carried suspended to the harness. The mau immedia ely gave the alarm, and a party started out to recover and prepare for funeral the remains of poor old Dad, the searchers of course indulging in the most moral of platitudes by the way, but so far as the object of their solicitude was concerned their serious thoughts and speeches were entirely wasted, for they found that old wairior taking his rest with the buggy's wreck above him, and also as sound as a trivet, for providence, which watches especially over dipsomaniacs, aided and abbet.ted by Dick, had wedged the ruins of the curricle up between two myall trees iu such a position as to nicely shade the sleeper from tbe ear.'y rays of the sun. When questioned as to the cause of his coming to grief, Dad laid all the blame on the spirit; and, to prove the truth of his story, pointed out the trampled state of the saltbueh in the cemetery as the result of the blackguard rush the demon made for Rob's ghost. Whether Dad's Rudiior believed his story or no is not recorded, but 1 think, with all due defference to my departed friend's veracity, that the to wnship goats, numbering over 1,000 (to which slack wire fence offered no obstacle), had a prior claim to be the authors of the desecration in question. One thing is certain, from that time forward the encroaching sand crept slowly but 6urely forward, gradually covering fence and grave till only oae comer of the cameiery was free from the brooding desolation that fully took possession of it till the march of progress, headed by the town corporation, removed any recoverable monuments to tbe now cemetery at Stirling, and buried the sand demou beneath a carput of couch grass and tough harbor silt. As for Dad, he flourished for years after his adventure, well liked by everyone who knew him. for he followed the golden rule, though he. had a spice of the devil in him In the Californian Legislative Assembly a Bill to prevent ladies wearing hats in theatres has been proposed but not carried,
