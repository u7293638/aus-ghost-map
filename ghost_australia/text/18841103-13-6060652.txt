THE DERBY DAY. Derby) Day, which ushers in the great spring meeting of the Victoria i Racing Club, Was celebrated on Saturday) with unusual f enter it) and success The programme was similar to that of other Denby days, but the attendance was greater, the lawn more brilliant, and there were no accidents on the course, as there were in Martini Henri) s year, to mar the pleasure of the scene. Derby) Day indeed mulled the pieces of the Cup, It is a summary) of equal brightness, but not of equal size The day was not a general holiday), but the city was Hill of racing visitors, who having come to town on pleasure bent, you glad to find it at Flemington 'The weather burned the subJect of mingled hope and ft ar The morning broke dull, but the May slowly) dispelled the clouds, and by means Indies were able to Borenely enjoy) their drive to the course in troubled by visions of damp dresses and faded hue The railway, with its quick, easy transit, was the favourite route Here things were well managed 1 ion! 11 o'clock the press at the Spencer street station was very great. Collins street was almost blocked by the marching column trending westwards Cabs rolled up to the sump entrepot in unbroken processions. The omnibus drivers had to keep up a chorus of " full inside " from very early stages of their journey, and private carriages, whose owners desired to make a short cut behind the iron horse, helped to swell the stream of eager, hasteful applicants for tickets But there was never even the shadow of a block or contusion-not even when the bankers, merchants, and Com mercial contingent poured down in );kisÂ»c close upon the abutting up hour of noon, and just in time to see the first race if no time vi us lost on the Wa). It was not easy to make a crush the most ardent bands of race goers, dashing up in hansoms at double fare, top speed, mil wildly throwing the driver his coin in the rush to catch the train just leaving, found rows of ticket boxes gaping like the portholes of a man of war, and a bland clerk quicker in finding the ticket than they were in finding the cash. If, like sheep following a bell xv other people tried to crush round one or two boxes, there were obliging porters to repeat "Otherboxes please, "and if bachelors with un witting presumption sought to enter with the privileged Benedicts by the private door the Janitor with upraised finger, pointing to the more vulgar parts of the fold, discreetly barred the entrance, and kept the sacred enclosure and its fair divinities free from profanation "Have as uniforms and badges, brand new from the mill, and coruscating with buttons like heliotropes, blossomed everywhere 'the extra staff was a small army There was a man at every gate, and the gates were legion so that many hands made light work Mr Speight must have made a conscription of railway porters Uno men with the kings, who stood on high Indicating to the drivers when the trains were full, w crew very useful The passengers showed their tickets at the outer harriers, so that once past these, where there was room and x eggs enough forthesubdivi6ion of the labour, they were able to take their seats comfort ably and without crushing At the course the people made their exits us easily as they had made their entrances Just before the first race was run there was a lull in the railway traffic. Just before that all the Governors four in hand coach drove up the straight run home in front of the grand Stand. His Excellency Sir Henry Brougham Loch drove a handsome team of browne, and beside him on the box sat Sir George Strahan, Governor of Tasmania. Lady Loch, fair by William Robinson, Governor of South Australia, and Miss Robinson, were the other members of the vice regal party, who were accompanied by Captain Traill (private secretary to Sir H B Loch), and several guests at Government house A cheer went up, and the popular Australian Hand under the conductorship of Signor Zelman, which had taken its customary stand on the sward to add to the pleasure of the day, played the National Anthem Mr Byron Moore escorted the visitors to the compart- ment set apart for them in the middle of the stand, which was tastefully decorated with flowers and upholstery Meanwhile Sir William Clarke had driven up in his drag, and the carriage paddock, in which sumptuous luncheon tables had already been spread, presented the array of elegant equipages and crack teams of well matched high steppers which is only seen at Flemington on one Other day of the year Brilliant sunshine enlivened the scene now that the horses were saddling for the Melbourne Stakes. The ladies, after their first saunter on the lawn, were filling the grand stand with "gay splendour and luxurious State. " There were no vacant seats, and the tout ensemble, as the horses came to the post, might be compared to a conservatory in full bloom, if the Burnie had not been worn threadbare, besides being feeble to express the richly variegated tints and infinite variety of harmonious contrasts which met the eye, tier above tier, and overflowed into the open-air stand above. On the lawn, where " the bubbling four games played," and the sward was of a rich, fresh green, velvety to the foot, and fringed with flowers, the fine effects of lights and shadows upon the exquisite forms and colours of the costumes were a crowning triumph upon the art of the modiste. It was a garden party upon a large scale, and perhaps only connoisseurs know how much better a background of Nature's spring carpet sets off an elegant toilette than upon the buff boards of a ballroom. Whom have we to thank for the abolition of trains? Is it Worth or common sense. Praise be to the arbi- ter of fashion for such a quickening stride towards rational dress." Think of the cramped movement of the lawn promenaders a season or two ago, and see them this Derby day. There is an easy, graceful carriage, a springy step ; the neat costume just touches the dainty shoe. The side walk has to find other sweepers now than costly fabrics. Long before the Derby was run the grand Stand reserves were quite full enough for comfort, the hill was thickly covered with sightseers, and the Hat had some thousands of patrons. The excellent luncheon provided by Mr. Straker had been done ample justice to, and the bookmakers, inspirited by the unexpected victory of Newstead in the Maribyrnong Plate, were loudly preferring the contents of well-filled purses to those who could spot the winner of the big race. How few did so how few even among the knowing ones ! A " place " was all that was given him by the nearest of them. Bargo, like Archie last year, had the affections of the multitude. "The field again proved the best horse, but meanwhile the talent," like the old sexton, were re- peating the refrain " We gather them in, as the gold clocked in their pouches, and lead pencils and pocket- books were busily at work. At a quarter-past 1 the horses, the cynosure of all eyes, were in line in front of the grand stand, the saddling-paddock was empty, the stand and hill were black with gazers-to see large beaten in the straight Another " boil over !" No victory could have been more coolly received. Not a cheer was raised, not a but went off. Rufus as a bookmaker's horse. Shall the starter's hand be kissed ? There was a rush back to town after the Derby. The vice-regal party' then left, and were hurrahed as they drove off. The car riage paddock was a scene of bustle in the desire to be first on the road, and railway travellers remembered that at the finish there is more haste and less speed. Still, even then there was no disorder. Mr. Speight, like Scott's Marmion, watchman on a lonely tower," saw everything with a prescient eye from his high perch on the bridge, and a wave of his hand was as good as many extra gates. Once or twice the notice "Platform full " had to be hoisted, but by generalship in giving orders, and smartness in carrying them out, every- body had found a seat in a train within half an hour of the last race being run. From a social point, if not from a racing point of view. a better Derby day) has never been 1 down I and the management was so excellent that Mr Byron Moore the indefatigable secretary may make his mind comparatively easy in regard to the success to be achieved on the trc iter strain of Cup day in DM SSI S Flemington mild fine weather were h ed together on Saturday and the IstofNoicm ber was ushered in by 83 beautiful and per feet a day as any one could hope for or dream of the lawn-that apple of Mr Byron Moore's overlooked its smartest and the flowers and the fountains and even the artifical frogs and li? idea seemed to rejoice in the return of spring, What if there was a fly in the sweet ointment in the shape of a while now and again of Zephyrs laden with bone perfume borne from the factories that line the banks of the Saltwater River A moment and it was gone and all was sweetness and light once more Every thing, that a woman re line 1 save an 1 except a good luck in the matter of bow caps was as usual provided in the various retiring, rooms and for this thoughtfulness the lady visitors will always feel (grateful! to the presiding genius of the racecourse But very few of these creature comforts were need 1 the dust for once h 11 ce lied to rise and the wind was so slight thutscurcelj scarf ties disarranged a bonnet spray displace! or a leaflet mille 1 It was just the very day for promenading, and the stand in consequence except during, a race was largely neglected 1 In fact it was almost ( capt j at times and the whole body of visitors were divil 1 equally between the saddling paddock and the law in Afternoon tea in the carriage pa 1 love is now one of the rec< tmsed institutions of the meeting It was first started in the tent that was erected at the east end of the stand but now the time has been changed to the long runs of tables to the right of the lawn Not the least enjoyable part of the days pleasures is this quiet cup of tea taken perhaps with a mo line of scandal It would gladden the his use of some of our staunch temperance i lv cafes to see how the sterner sex are giving up a good deal of the So) and tilling quite kindly to the mild bohea.

He wrote of "cool muslins" and shimmering silks" and " clinging stuffs," and though older and wiser now, he still has warm words of admiration for charming dresses, and he loved to praise them and the

her dressing than in that of one who was inclined to neglect the vanities of her toilette it must be admitted that women themselves very often take the general outward appearance of one of their own sex as a distinguishing mark of the best of her mind for good or evil ] even in the small matter of hair dressing what a world of character its style and arranging indicates Of course, people can wear their locks many as) they please but they must not forget their duty to their neighbour some thought must be taken on the score of effect For instance, why should a word in my ear her front hair dragged off her face until one thinks how dreadfully it must hurt and put on a huge hat with a mass of trimmings' As a consequence she looks as if she had just returned from an interview with the family ghost instead of her lady's maid, and wonders why ever) body starves be at her Resound always be remembered that certain races demand a decoration as much in accord us the perfume of the violet-delicate without being overwhelming All the masters say), ' study effects from nature, and in the matter of personal adornment womankind would do well to lay this suggestion to heart and to act up to it Nature never puts the belongings of a violet on a jacquinot nor gives the luxurious odour of the rose to the white saintliness of the lily As regards bonnets and bats, there were changes to be noticed but they were chiefly modifications of styles that have had the seal of becomingness set upon them in the past Die novelties outline were very few, and those were chiefly ugly J Time was when a summer bonnet meant a straw bonnet of some kind or other, and it was looked on as bad form to wear anything else But that old fashioned idea has been buried long ago At the present day there are as many materials for the composition of headdresses as there are for gowns and if any woman can discover or invent any material, from lace to leather, that will have the effect of making her look more bewitching she at once adopts it, and defies the mandates of fashion Chapeaux were present on Saturday in all varieties, net and tulle being amongst the principal materials Then there were all colours in crepe and mull, basketwork, chenille India silks, and straw The crepe bonnets are easily made, and usually most becoming All styles looked well,, in this material, but the oval outlines looked as smart as any The puff round the brim was generally of velvet, a darker colour being usually selected by way of contrast Pom pons, aigrettes, lace, flowers, fruit, or any decoration in harmony, were used as orna- ment, Gold was everywhere, and in poor sion Cords and buckles, gold laces and crowns, gold sprinkled feathers and gauze, and gold lace, were all seen the flower trimmings were small in size, but many were clustered together Grasses and weeds, admirably reproduced, mingled m admired dis- order, the idea intended to convey being that they had just been plucked Vegetable trimming was scarce, and in one instance the effect was a failure, a cluster of walnuts on a hat looking at a little distance, for all the world like a root of potatoes just dug from the ground In another instance mushrooms mixed with foliage appeared decidedly heavy, and not in the least ornamental One or two Leghorn hatswerenoticeable They were of very fine quality, and certainly looked unaffected and novel, the amount of trimming seemed to be at the discretion and taste of the wearers One of these hats were trimmed with rose coloured mull and a wreath of wild roses , just under the brain was placed a rich looking butterfly, nestling in some of the soft place with which it was lined Gow as were marks d by simplicity of style, and shades and colours were more than usually varied and delicate Cotton materials were very much worn Costumes composed of lace and cashmere, or nun's v ode and lace, were very popular Chenille tufted wellings were amongst the novelties, and helped to form artistic combinations Pleated or flat j skirts were most popular Many were quite plain, or with a ' Fishwife tunic," looped under instead of being turned over Embroidered cambrics and muslins were plentiful, also printed delaines in cool shades, used in combination with shot silk or ficelle lace Terry velvet and shot silk were also much used for wa stoats and kangaroo pouches ' Jersey bodices were very popular, especially those ornamented with gold braid 'They were very effective with all lands of skirts, and were particularly be on good figures Many of the new brocades were very striking, and if some of the ancient crusaders could return to life it would be difficult to ] persuade them that the embroideries worked and worn by the fair women of mediaeval times had not lasted through the roll of j centuries, and were not still womb) their descendants Happily for the draper) cBtub hsliments, this is not so, and those same crusaders would find, to their wonder and

designs are not of the "severe school" pattern, and consequently they give the appearance of being done by hand 'The groundwork is generally dark, or of some neutral shade, and therefore the contrasts are not very pronounced Many of the patterns are too large, and give one the idea of elaborate and costly wallpaper patterns, which is an effort not to be desired Velvets, stiff silks and satins were the materials dia played on Derby) Day, and were mostly used for petticoats and panels One of the I handsomest had a silver grey background, on which were worked golden roses scattered irregularly over its surface 'The skirt was of brocade, made plain and light and the bodice and draperies were composEd of the groundwork of the embroider), the only other introduction of the figured material

biMne, can be arranged with them One costume of myrtle green was decorated with such enormous quantities of biscuit coloured face that in giving a description of it one might almost be tempted to say there were miles of it A regular canvas like tables of Champion hue was veiled with Biirah of the same shade, the skirt being composed of the silken m arena! It had a front goroW the stuff, held in its place by the steel buckles and straps, after the manner of a shield.

There was but the one red dress on the lawn and amongst so much that was sombre and quiet, it gave the one gay speck so easily noted at a distance. A symphony in brown and gold brocade was to be noted The skirt was of comfortable walking length, and laid in double box plaits The vest was of brown moire, closed by small gold buttons The coat was of brocade having its edges and collar and cuffs outlined by rows of gold braid. Alpine hat of brown straw, trimmed with a | a scarf of brown gossamer, and feathers finished by gilded arrows stuck through the side A noteworthy dress was worn by a I youthful blonde 'Her skirt was of rich drab ] silk of a shade now so much in vogue, it was plaited and plain 'Her apron drapery was edged by a deep border of drab feather trim mine?, plain bodice of the silk, with which was worn a cape of the trimming A very becoming costume for the early spring was of a sage green men's voile the skirt was trimmed with a fold of velvet of the same shade about three inches from the bottom, I collar and cuffs of the same velvet ornamented this bodice There was the | smallest apology for hip drapery, full waterfall back, and a masher collar with gold stud worn round the neck harmonised well with the studied plainness of the rest of the | toilette The bonnet was a small dark green poke lined with velvet, and having a cluster of dark green velvet leaves placed just in the front The perfect and ladylike look of the above method of dressing, the delightful feeling that one colour is not quarrelling with another, that gloves and bonnet, dress, and parasol are all in harmony, cannot but inspire a feeling of confidence in the weather, which is one of the happy results of being well dressed A blue and gold shot silk skirt with picked out flounces and drapery of delaine, embroidered at the edges was very smart, and I made up into a sparkling costume that seemed I to accord well with the bright day 'The | jacket bodice was trimmed at the waist with lace, and fastened crosswise in front Abonnct I of pink and gold, of the Olivette shape, was very becoming to the wearer A very tall dark lady wore a gown of or even green satin j and brocade of a pinkish mauve, the bodice I and back of the skirt were of satin ; the latter was cut in battlements, and in each was placed a full face of brocade, rest- ing on a band of red velvet The front of the skirt had a plastron of brocade flanked by) a quilling of lace A long plain jacket bodice finished this very fine and effective toilet A very rich looking model was of cinnamon brown satin duchesse and cream lace. The skirt was laid open on one side, and in it was placed a gore of Maltese lace, the opposite side being perfectly plain 'I he drapings and bodice were of the sum, and the bodice was finished with a small vest of the lace A beige had red and and shot silk, with brocaded leaves, which formed its plaited skirt and its soft gathered vest The cashmere bodice had brown velvet mod, bands of velvet lined with the silk draped the sides of the ample overskirt. A small shot cape completed the costume AMONGST THE HORSES Wherever a crowd are gathered together there shall the favourite be in the midst of them This is the rule of the saddling paddock Shortly after noon horses swathed and hooded come trooping through the lower gate, and as the bell rings out its request to saddle for the Melbourne Stakes hundreds of people forsake the lawn and terrace and come down to have a look at the favourites The idol of the minute, familiarly alluded to as " old Commotion," is " at home" in the lower sheds, and here the greatest crowd gathers A couple of groomsman primarily engrossed in a sort of hissing duet-whether intended to dispel fictitious clouds of dust or to soothe the horse is not clear-while as a secondary occupation the) rub the pera piration from the favourite's glossy dunlea Commotions cul) ambition in to eat the stable boy) standing at his head, but the youngster whose hat scarcely reaches the horse's mule holds on with both hands, and BccniH to appreciate the direct attention paid to him by the favourite City people have only one opinion, and express it in the broad, unassailable statement, " He is a pretty horse " A youth of rustic habit is absorbed, not in the horse's prospects, but the grooms' performance, and when one of them drops out of the duet for the mat and he remarks, 'Iles blocked all his breath a Eva) ' A good man are anxious for a glimpse of Malua and catching sight of Robinson, in his pale blue jacket and crimson bush, coming down the paddock, they follow Me his worn in urban > til .

An up country seer, who has very successfully associated a little judicious dreaming with a great deal of wide awake cool calculation, had a Cup vision the other night, in which 'the Plunger took a leading part He and his friends were now inspecting their horse The Broker, a beautiful golden chesnut, quiet uni! bright looked as handsome as anything in the paddock Another chesnut Brown and Rose whose colours have Wmiiled with her name, seemed just a little bit too surat ar the company) For the next race being very awkward looking horses were making preparation Privateer, a mountain of horseflesh on stilts, towered over anything else in the paddock A Barnum in the germ remarked that if his hind legs could be shortened a bit a little colouring would make him more valuable as a giraffe than a racehorse Yet he moved his stilts to some effect out on the course. Capri, a Caulfield horse, was even more to the showman's mind His kind quarters fall away in approved giraffe fashion, yet his pro- pelling power is in no way affected by it. A great many went to see the Albury crack, Bonnie Bee, but her exceeding plainness damped speculation The fact that Hales was tightening up Despot's girths was sufficient to make the Sydney horse drawn " With Ina dark coat, spangled with silver hairs, Despot was indeed handsome And son's pair, Conjecture and Little Sister, seemed more suited to a pony carriage, being quite overshadowed in sue by the rest of the company If Pav o had admirers, it was the cause of his reputation and the colours he carried the opening) winner is the type of horse to take refuge under the motto, " Handsome is as handsome does " He had a great many more visitors after the race than before it. The great nursery race of the year' brought more people than evcr'dÃ³wrf rÃ­tÃ­ibngst the pines Intending backers sCHDJlcd the pedigrees of former winners for a clue, but there were no finger- posts there. They could scarcely avoid noticing how persistently in late years the fillies cropped out in the list The names of Habeas, Nellie, Palm) ra, Lavinia, Narina, andlolantheweresufficient proof that here, as elsewhere, the sex is precocious. It was not a matter for wonder, then, that the biggest crowds gathered about the two favourites Melodious and Uralla. In the opinion of the vast majority the race was simply an in tercolonial match between the pair The Sydney filly was too fine to please everyone There were more sharp points and acute angles about her than good judges cared for, and many people asked whether Uralla was naturally thin Not that it mattered much for the distance Her stable companion, Monte Christo, was a youngster of a nobler type, being square and handsome just the sort of colt, in fact, to follow his sire's example and win a Derby In color he is a wonderfully close copy of Despot, but, if any thing, there is less white flecking his sable coat Going over to the gateway, where the favourite, conspicuous in her white summer dress, is just being stripped, we pass the black colt Cairo, with a peculiarly marked hind leg There is a grey horse somewhere back in his family pedigree Manchester, with a plain head and plebian neck, but very excellent testimonials on the sires side, also bars the way for an instant One can only get a peep at Melodious over a score of heads, but there is no necessity to look long before coming to the conclusion that the filly's appearance quite justified the chairman rIip held before the race "She's able to cut the record," said someone in authority, whether she was or not and her backers would like to have amended the remark in Parliamentary fashion by striking out the latter part of the clause Newstead, with his short bushy tail, was more like a foal than anything else in the race A rough piece of bagging for a saddle cloth gave the colt a provincial look, and the dull white jacket and black cap worn by Quin did not improve the general effect Yet Newstead was not without admirers. One of the critics remarked that in shape he was very like little Savanaka, and he added, " If he is half as good, he'd be well worth backing " As he left the paddock early first out-very few expected to see him first back again. Under the sheds First Prince, with a large indiarubber ring over his pastern, held his first levee. His sire, First King, fought some hard battles with Chester, and now the gage had fallenatnongat the progeny of the two great cracks Here is a new costume in the centre of the paddock. A black jacket with a large orange star in front and rear distinctive colours, if not yet distinguished, and likely to be conspicuous even in the dust cloud at the far turn, where so many mixed as to men are blurred into things indefinable 'These are Mr. Dargin's colours, and are carried by the bay filly Umbra. The fact that Corday was a son of that great racehorse Grand Flaneur was sufficient to bring the curious flocking about him. The youngster is a good fac-simile of his celebrated sire, and, like him, may reach perfection as a three year old Mr. Chirn Bide'a filly Campanilla was sadly marred in appearance by a very hollow back, more conspicuous before she was saddled. The brown jacket and rose cap, so well remembered in connexion with last spring, were sufficient to identify Mr. Smart's colt Burrdda. Another brown jacket, crowned, however, with a snow- white instead of rose cap, placed the locality of The Teacher, but Moore was in the saddle before the crowd had time to do much in the way of criticism. Sir William Clarke's two Bordeaux colts, appropriately named Chablis and Sauvignon. were saddling side by side in the furthest corner of the paddock. Sanvignon, by reason of his lineage, perhaps, carried the stable colours, Trallon, onChablla, having put up a white cap for the sake of distinction Before there was time to notice anything further the youngsters were stretching themselves in the straight When Hill, amidst many congratulations, led Newstead back from the weighing yard the crowd, as they always do, (locked round about the winner, and discerned limitless " points " where 10 minutes before few were visible "1 his should have been our second win, said the trainer, for if the boy could have ridden Lady Ten is out we must have had another Maribyrnong Plate " The selling racers were scared) noticed, but long before the Derby horses commenced to strip the paddock was invaded Even the ladies wished to have a closer view, and came down in groups, their rich costumes making the colours of the jockeys plain by contrast 'The Sydney horses, Bargo and Tri mando, were being led round in a circle just under the foot of the hill, but the people crowded about them so that the little course could no longer be kept clear and the word was given to get read) Bargo of course monopolised attention, scarcely any) notice being given to the brown '1 remands After looking at the favourite few had anything to say against him, and backers remained firm in their allegiance On!) once was an unkind word spoken A youth, horsey in the extreme, pruned his way to the front, and, after a careful survey, summed up the allan tion thus " That bloke's sore.

Of the others, Commotion was the only one backed. The race was generally regarded as a match between this pair, and Malula was the most fancied. Commotion forced the pace for the greater part of the way. The Plunger came on gallantly in the straight, and half-way home got his head in front Here Malua joined the struggling pair, and sailing along at his case passed them, and won as he liked by about half a length. Com- motion was a very close third,thcrestnowhere. The Hotham Handicap, which followed, brought out 16 starters, Favo being such a strong favourite that he left the paddock at the short odds of 5 to 4. The Andes made the pace for about half a mile, when he gave way to Vernet, who led the field till reaching the abattoirs, where he compounded, and Faye, who had been running in a good position all the way, went to the front, and led home. Hastings made good effort in the straight, but could not get on terms with the leader, and had to be content with second place. Anglesey ran very forward throughout, and secured third position. After the usual interval for luncheon, the bell rang for the youngsters to muster at the post for the Maribyrnong Plate, the richest two-year-old prize in the Southern Hemisphere. When the numbers went up it was seen that the whole of the score coloured on the and were going to start Melodious and Uralla were the two that attracted the most attention, and they looked fit enough to the veto please even the most fastidious. Cairo, Lady Claudia, and Arsenal had met their group of ad- miners in the saddling paddock. Newstead was also much liked, and he would have been a better favourite but for the zigzag manner in which he has been apt to do his gallops on the training ground The young sters behaved very well at the post, and were sent away soon after getting into line. New stead's colours were showing prominently from the first, and as they entered the course it was seen that he had a strong lead, and was running as straight as his warmest backer could wish Monte Christo was very prominent, immediately behind him, and on the outside of the course were Uralla, Melodious, and The Teacher, well for ward. Half way up the lawn Hales called on Uralla, but she faded away to nothing, and Newstead gained a very easy victory by three lengths. Monte Christo ran a good colt all through. Burnldn came with a rush at the finish, and, passing Melodious, The Teacher, and Uralla, gained third place the time is remarkably good, having been beaten only once, by Iolanthe, who won the race last year in 1m sea. From the way Newstoadwon.it is evident the stable had not made any mis- take in the time it was averred the colt could and bad run the distance. Newstead had already secured two winning brackets in South Australia, but as the time made on these occasions was nothing sensational, but little notice was taken of them. Newstead was bred by Sir Thomas Elder, and at the annual sale of yearlings from the Morphetville stud he was purchased by Mr. W. Branch for 31 guineas Eleven horses started for the Selling Race, which excited a deal of speculation, Maroney and Royal Irishman being selected to carry the bulk of the public money. Stafford out out the work at a merry pace, Royal Irishman keeping him close company. The pair ran in front in the order named till entering the straight, where Royal Irishman gained the lead, and holding his place all the rest of the distance, won comfortably Northern Light ran third the most of the way, and finished in that place Marone Was never seen near the front at any time 'The winner was put up for sale by auction, and knocked down to Mr. A R Robertson for Â£250, all of which goes to the club Northern Light was claimed, but as no one would advance beyond the upset he went back to his owner's The saddling bell then rang for the great three year old event of the year, the V.R.C. Derby stakes, the blue ribbon of the Vic- torian turf 'The greatest interest was taken in the preparation of the several candidates for the coming struggle. Bargo, the favourite, being naturally the great attraction. Opinions varied greatly about IiIb condition, the hope fill thinking he was perfection, while the despondent fancied he went short in his gallop, deficient in muscle, too big, or the thousand and one fault the ingenious horse fancier can find water in the humour Mozart was a great favour, his victory at Caulfield, added to those mysterious gallops he has since done before daylight, and the strong support of the stable, all assisting to bring him into request The excellent form shown by Anglesey in the Hotham Handicap was a mile stronger inducement for the public to back him David, though not a large colt, attracted the attention of many, who be beÂ» ed, despite his running at Caulfield, that he would distinguish himself on the better going of the Flemington course Notes ith standing her victory in the Caulfield Guineas, Sandal was not in much request, while (first) wife, whom she beat it Utullicld, was in Sr od favour When brought on to the course attitude looked very well, but was too much excited Seahorse did not please the judges, but the accounts of his doings at that larat caused him to assume Birnie prominence in the betting Merrimu appeared to have gone through a good preparation, but though the stable supported him freely the public did not follow llippogrill and Leporello were the most neglected, while 'demand was be holed to be held safe b) lnsstablocompanion and half a dozen others Rufus did not attract much attention on the part of the eager speculators who thronged the paddock.

But it was no easy victory, for David finished well, and was only beaten by a little over a neck, while Bargo was not a length away. Mozart finished, after a gap of three lengths, at the head of the others, but in reality the contest was between the three placed horses, nothing else being in the race after the horses entered the straight I have lit net 18 South Australian colt, and was bred by Mr. P.

That a colt who was never in a mile and a quarter races Caulfield three weeks ago, could come out and win a Derby) in fact time on Saturday last is one of those uncertainties of the turn which, according to some people, constitute its greatest charm. 'The race was run in excellent time, and has only been beaten three times namely, b) Darebin in 1881, Navigator in 1882 (both of whom won it in 2m His end Martini-Henry in 1883, when the race was run in 2m. 30s. Rufus was fairly supported for the Derby) before the Caulfield meeting. Until the Derby was run the fielders had had a very uncomfortable time of it, and had Bargo won the Derby tile backers would have got back their losses over Caulfield, with KomuLlmiL' to the good. The victory of Jtulua put a different aspect on affairs, and there was then quite a cherry ring in the voices that offered the odds, which was not noticed earlier in the day) 'The day's racing was brought to a conclusion with the Coburg Stakes, for which 25 horses started, here again the backers experienced a reverse .I'nyc-ftnd Meteor were selected to carry the public money, but, to the surprise of all, Wacpbitfe came to the front in the straight, aud,-"iufitiing in better form than she basil jot Eleven, gained the victory. .Favqiiruai well for ward, but did not get a situation, while Meteor was never dangerous The racing was conducted in excellent style, not the slightest hitch occurring during the day, and the last mee was started punctually A good deal of conceit) was excited by a red flag being hoisted on a stuff in the corner of the weighing and.

A matter that might very properly engage the attention of the stewards is the colours worn by many of the jockeys From the names given on the card it is almost impossible to tell what colours are meant, red, scarlet, crimson, and rose apparently mean anything from a faded brick colour to the deepest crimson, and there is almost as much difficulty in distinguishing between the different shades of blue, Colours that are identical, but are given different names, are common on the Victorian courses, and cause much confusion Often the colours are so washed out that pink, yellow, and blue appear to the spectator to be dirty white. Instead of the colours distinguishing the horses, as they should fin it evident mining as if they were employed to conceal their identity 1 for the convenience of the public no colours should be permitted to be worn but what are clearly described in the cards and can be easily identified on the course, The following are the details of the racing - MELBOURNE STAKES.
