CURRENT LITERATURE. The Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere, Bart., O.G.B., F.R.S., c. By Jons MAK TDTEAU. Two volumes. London : 1895. it is 11 years since the subject of this memoir died, and if this period has somewhat effected the features of his life out of the memory of a newer generation, it also permits that as high as a? nearly contemporary with Frere to divest itself of some prejudices It is to be gathered from Mr Marr rincau that he has been at work during; four years with the materials for the biography he is, consequently, not responsible for a delay which, he Sides, will not be much censured The prepara- tion of the work has been careful, i strong one month of hero-worship, even partisanship, is apparent, a\ Inch is a very noticeable, because Mr Martnioau never met Sir Bartle 1 zero The book in itself is without distinction, so that hardly a passage can be quoted in the biographer s words After much reading of these hopelessly one sided accounts of public men, one has a sort of respect for the procedure of the Papal Court in the matter of beatification, when the idea of ling t defying pointed spokesman not less than the angels thus If we could somehow Let our biographies done by collaboration of this 1 and, certainly the difficulty would be immense but then the mass of " Lives and Letters," uniformly in two octavo volumes, with portraits, maps, indices, and the rest, would have to make place for brief memoirs that should really contain something memorable But this is a mere counsel of perfection Henry Bartle Edward Frere was born on 29th March, train, at Llanelly, in Wales, w hero His parents were st lying, their place being in Suffolk He was educated at Bath Gr manner School and Haile) bury, avenue, at about 19, who va cut out to India is an employee of the Co upon After an interval of three months spent over the native languages, he received the appointment of junior supernumerary at Poona Next he went as assistant to Mr Goldsmid to Iudr sport, on a mission of inquiry into native lil ents Mr Goldsmid established order, and when he retired Fiero succeeded him His next removal was to Bombay Sir George Arthur had just come from Tasmania as Goa error, and young Prero was appointed his private secretary Having married a daughter of the Governor and spent a furlough in England, he got a chance of showing his capacity in the noa 1) acquired district of Sattara, and after a distinguished success there he was transferred as Commissioner to the now annexation of Sud He was there during the Mutiny, and rendered good so vice, not only by keeping his own territory from quite, but by expediting the tr sport of all dis- posable forces to the front Afterwards he was no less honourably prominent in securing a prompt return to the order in methods of British law instead of martial law against the natives During this period there had minds to do with a remarkable man Jacob, the organiser of the Stud Irregular Horse, a force that Kept the Boloochis in check In the routine of civil administration, with which so much of this book is concerned, the again of Jacob becomes almost epical After nine years of an administration which conferred abundant benefits upon Sind, and endeared him to its people of all grades, Piece went to Calcutta as member of the Supreme Council of India In this position certainly not the least of his services was to try oouragoMr (afterw lids Sir William Mackinnon in the formation of what became the British-India Steam Navigation Company in ISGi he received one of the high prize of the Indian service when he was nominated Governor of Bombay for the of years he was here engaged in the multifarious duties that belong to the head of a province of the Indian Empire During his administration the crash took place following the artificial prosperity due to the cotton period, when supplies were stopped by the American war, and England. sought new sources of purchase His policy was to lend the public support to the greater institutions, but even that did not wholly prevent disaster In 1867 he went to London to take a seat in the Indian Council Those duties occupied him, with two special missions one to effect a treaty with the Sultan of Zane bar to put down the slave trade, and then the accompanying of the Prince, of Wales on his tour through India This brings us to his new work, one to end in bitter disappointment In 1875 Lord Carnarvon was anxious to forward the federation of South Africa, and persuaded Frere to go out to the Cape as Governor and High Commissioner He had barely arrived in the country when Shepstone annexed the Transvaal, and committed Britain to a policy that entailed Majuba and the retrocession of the Boer Republics after Trero's recall, to be succeeded by Sir Hercules Robinson, who has just been despatched to the Cape again to follow a superseded Governor. This part of Mr Mat amounts book is a long charge of weakness and a, vacillation against the British Government, and especially the Gladstone Administration of 1880 Mr Martineau permits himself a free hand in this period, and parts of his final chapters read like an attack upon Mr Gladstone Frere felt himself abandoned after having for a few years pursued with a single eye the Carnarvon policy of uniting the South African territories, while he maintained public pledges and protected the British sphere from the turbulence of Cetewayo After his recall some few years of repose were his, until, as the result of a chill, he died in 1884 In his public life he was of fine and magnanimous character, so also in his private life He sought strenuously to benefit all under his authority, and whatever exception may be taken to the policy which he found himself in Africa to execute, few 3oz errors over left that country with a greater amount of popular respect and affection It had been well for his reputation if, as he was at first disposed, he had refused the invitation to go to the Cape His long Indian career was eminently distinguished But whatever the mistakes, the follies of that sad period, when the names of Isandhlwana and Majuba were added to history, the personal honour and character of Prora emerged unstained men will differ, according to their ideas of Imperial policy, about that dark and troubled epoch in South Africa, but they will not lightly censure the administrator under whose rule antecedent difficulties and those forced on him from home reached their melancholy culmination The Works of Sir Walter Pater, published in his life, are few-ion also his remains, and a v, Rae and pious frugality presides at the cisponsmgof them In a volume just issued by Messrs. Macmillan and Co. , called Greek Studies, Mr Charles L Shadwell has collected seven articles either written originally for publication in English magazines, or else prepared at the material for lectures, but all equally having already appeared in print As the editor explains there are two sections-in one Mr Pater is engaged in studying the Greek, myths, in the other the Greek sculpture The myths of Dionysius and Demeter and Persephone and two mythical subjects from Euripides, the Bacchanals and Hip polyruB veiled, supply him with the material for DIB four fUst papers, in the other three he is occupied with the various sculptured works of the great Greek" artists in all a\ will be found an intimate realisation of the ancient world, with a truly modern conception of its totality and unity, and the numismatic harsh and definiteness of Mr Panter's language remain unquestionable Engaged with those delightful regulations of the fresh spirit of the world, the scholar we have lost seems in these papers to have been inspired with tenderness, with Bonsibility, if that word is not too much preferred to be now understood Especially one finds time note in the last essay, that called " The Age of Athletic Prlzomon " But all the contents of the volume and so dear to the humanist Surely the entered the long introspection called the diary of Stephen Allard is of Mr Peter's School The book is named The Melancholy of Stephen Altar d, edited by Mr Garnet Smith, and published by Messrs.
