Chapter IX —The Democracy of Faith. It wa3 indeed a singular thing to hear, the usual conversation of those young people about religicuB qutstions upon which the greatest minds of subsequent ages have spent their force without exhausting them; but it should bo remembered that everything like exast scieuce was then in its infancy; all that was actually known of medicine, chemistry, geology, gcorcetiy, geography, botany, and even of mathematics, could be very quickly learned; and around this narrow limit of ascertained truth spread a boundless wilderness of vagrant. speculation, in which the seeker after learning might wander a whole lifetime without 6ver being labia to add one single valuable fact to the stock of knowledge; so that religion, whether Christianity or paganism, wa3 uni versally regarded as the one thing that might most profitably be learned and known; and . education even from j infancy consisted in acquiring the knowledge of it, and this educa tion was amoDg the heathen chiefly objective, handling the visible, tangible symbols of a superstition which possessed only the most meagre elements of subjective truth and power, except perhaps for the higher priests who had been initiated into mysteries unknown to the common people, while among the Christians ■ the process was almost reversed. Christianity had no objective life, except in the person of Jesus Christ; and the subjective power which it possessed upon both intellect and conscious ness had no assignable limits, inasmuch as it Eeemed to make the martyrs almost insensible to physical pain, and yet could produce a moral sensitiveness so acute that to be conscious of wilful deception might work the death of the body, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira when they lied to Peter about the consecration of their property to holy uses. This educa tion among the Egyptians, especially among females of the higher classes, was chiefly oral, but among the Christians the _ young were taught both orally and by the written text. Orse of the Btrangest and yet most logical results of the Christian teachings and practice . (and one which ha3 been, for very sufficient reasons, ignored by th8 theologians) was to* de velop a radical and uncompromising spirit of de ■ mocracy throughout the Christian communities or churches. The'early Christians uniformly held that they, as Christians, belonged to a king . dom which was in, but not of, the world—a kingdom for which no earthly potentate had right or power to legislate; and this living faith loosened the bond of allegiance and dissolved the sense of obligation as to all human authority, and was tha negation of the law \- fulness cf temporal government over the subjects of the kingdom for which they recognised no king but Christ. While, for the sake of peace, they' were willing to render unto Cuosar the thiDgs which are Cissar's, by paying taxes to that government under which they lived, and by even yielding ready obedience to all laws and customs which did not come in conflict with the higher law of the kingdom, the rights of conscience, they universally regarded these laws as extraneous to their own organisation, foreign statutes, im posed upon them from without; and, being solicitous to render unto God the things which are God's, they steadily abstained from any participation in the affairs of government, and quietly assumed the right to judge for them selves whether any law, regulation, or custom, prescribed by the sovereign power or other human authority, was or was not such as th6y might conscientiously obey. And while they would no more have thought of holding office nnder pagan rulers or of participating in their legislation and government than they would have thought of accepting the priesthood of a heathen temple and participating in its idola trous worship, they.' obeyed all laws alike, except such as conflicted with conscience, and these they refused to obey in the very face of persecutions, torture, and_ death, gut this fearless assertion of the rights of conscience necessarily involved the right to sit in judgment upon all human laws and the powers that ordained them, and to determine for them selves whether the law was lawful. That help less spirit of blind obedience to the decrees of despotic governments which characterised the pagan peoples was, therefore, impossible to i the Christians, In the very teeth of universally established law and custom they steadily re fused to bear arms, to own slaves, to seek any legal redreEB in • civil courts, to follow i the law; of their domicile in regard to the ownership of property or the succession to es tates of the deceased, just as they refused to sacrifice to the gods, or to call any man master, Under the same lofty conception of the rights of conscience, in lands where women were bought and sold like cattle,) they refused ;r practice polygamy; and in lands where female chastity was unknown and plural wives and concubines were.esteemed to be the insignia of honor and influence, they clave fast to that monogamie marriage which Jesus had elevated into a holy sacrament; and while throughout the world women were regarded as (slaves, a3 domestic chattels, or at the very bast as an inferior race and-a necessary evil, so that the birth of a female child wa3 looked upon as a household calamity, the Christian faith that the Holy Ghost conceived Christ before he was oorn of a virgin and manifested in the flesh, glorified and exalted the dignity of woman hood . and maternity, and created the idea of personal responsibility, rights, and duties for both sexeB alike, The logi cal tendency of Christianity wa3 therefore to originate the idea of personal liberty for all men, unknown to the world before; to re pudiate the heathen doctrine of the divine character and right of kings; to sit in judgment upon their laws, and to intelligently obey, or refuse, to obey them; in a word, to cultivate and exercise, as a matter of religions faith, that spirit of personal independence, both of action and of thought, which we in later times denominate democracy, the con crete form of which wai the election of deacons, presbyters, and bishops by the people nnto whom they ministered. But this babit of independent thought did not tend, as in later times, in tke_ direction of ecclesiastical schisms, because if any one embraced a doctrinal error either it was main tained by him as an individual opinion, or, iE a mistaken zeal-led him to proclaim it pnblicly, and seek thereby to bind the consciences of other Christians, the matter soon came to the knowledge of the churches, and when the church assembled to consider the alleged error, the Holy Paraclete directed the counsels of the assembled bishops and presbyters, bo that their, deliverances were infallibly correct, and were universallyaccept9d as final. So that during the first three centuries no heresy could survive the condemnation of a Christian council, and no learning, zeal, and geniuB could give to heresy such vitality and power aB to seriously threaten the peace of the Church. Even Peter, could not force the ob servance of the rite of circumcision upon the free Christian communities ; and the heresies of Menauder, Cerinthus, Nicolans, Valeu tinius, Marcion, Tatianns, Blastns, Montanus, Artimon, and others, perished almost as soon as they had been condemned, (To let continued,)
