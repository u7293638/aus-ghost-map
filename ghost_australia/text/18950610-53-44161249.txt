Numbers of persons have been much scared. To-night a new. phase waa entered on. At 7.30 o'clock, Frederick J. Park, aa aged miner, residing, at Mount Plea- sant, was walking along Eureka-street, to meet his wife, when be saw a peculiar figure chasing the woman, and she waa screaming. Park gave chase and came ap with the fellow who was dressed ia a white smock, with a coffin lid 6ft. long on his back and his face smeared with phosphorus. The old miner grappled with him, and both fell to the^ ground, Park getting a firm hold of his leg and calling far help. Finding be could not get away, the I çbosb drew a knife and stabbed Park ' in the arm, cutting through the coat and drawing blood. He then escaped. Park reported the matter to the police and showed the wounds. He describes the V ghost'' as being about 35 years old and a powerful man. Mrs. Westlaw, wife of the city missionary, and other residents of thé neighborhood confirm his story so far aa hearing his wife screaming for help, but they all appear to have been afraid to go to her rescue.
