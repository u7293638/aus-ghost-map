All rights referred.] Chaiteu XYT,— The Isqcest.— (Con- tinued. ) The next witness^ was William Gibbons, the boots, William proved what is termed rather a flippant witness. He had iu his bumble way that misty idea that accident had given him that opportunity of distinguishing himself which was permeatiag the brain of Mr. TotterdelL William Gibbons had little doubt in his own mind that the whole key to tbe mystery laid with him, and that when his testimony had been taken there would be merely the trifling addenda of arresting and hanging Foxboroueh to 'follow. He deposed how he bad called Mr. Foxborough on Wednes day, the 4th of September, about seven o'clock. Mr. Foxborough had arrived at the Hopbine on Saturday, August 31st, had gone ovc-r to Baum borough on Monday, September 2nd, had received Mr. Fossdjke to dinner on Tuesday the 8rd, and left on the following day. He called Mr. Foxborough at the time nj«ntio£cd by his own order, as he wished to catch the S.30 train for town, which was a tbrough train, and stopped nowhere between liunbury and London. HesawMr. Foxborough oil by that train; and pat hisportm&nteauinto; the carriage with him. In the afternoon he was \- ailed by his master to break open Mr. Foss dyke's door, had heard from Eliza Salter pre vicutly how late that gentleman was sleeping, how she could get- no answer to her knock*, and how she went so far as to say she thought '* something must have happened to him, a tit, or such like,' continued the witness, ' which it bad ; njien we got the door open, the poor gentleman was lj ing on his back with a fanci ful daggerburiedinhia chest, that was the lithe had, poor soul, and it's myopinion, gentlemen, tbat a more slimy,, cold-blooded viper ? Mr. Gibbons was sharply pulled up by the coroner, who informed him they should not require bis opinion, simply bis account of what he bad sees, and that he appeared to Lave already narrated all he knew from personal observation. Further questioned by Mr. Trail, William Gibbons raid they had none of them known Mr.Poxborough'sname until Mr. Fossdyke had asked for him b- it. He had himself thought there was something suspicious in a guest keeping his came dark. In all hu expe rience anue*- — . Here once moreajthe coroner ruthlessly, in tcrpoteO, and curtly informed Mr. Gibbons *hey :.: i- quiitoutiaiier fife thoughts iiecthf ' «su!t6Wb^^^ Trail had any farther -questtoc to askhim he might retire. - ' . - Tor. Trail having declined to attempt the extraction of further evidence from the re. doubtable William, that worthy withdrew murmuring, ' If this was the way these here murders was sifted, if the opinions of sensible ~ men whohad, so to speak, been im way almost in it, weren't to be thought of any account, how did any crowners or juries or blessed peelers think they was going to getat the right of things?' ' I wouldn't for the world, Phil, say a word against the poor fellow that's gone, but it really Feema*to me there is next to no evidence of murder,' whispered Moraut. 'Dr. Ingleby says that his opinion is theory only.' ? ' Yes, but not with regard to the wound ; that he holds decidedly was not self-inflicted. Still so far there is not much to implicate Foxborongh beyond this. If it is murder, acd not Foxborough, who on earth can it be?' John Jenkinson, the waiter, was now brought forward by Inspecror Thresher. He bore witness to the arrival of No. II on the Saturday, to his sudden interest in the opening of theBaumboroughtheatre,howonhureturn from there on Monday he announced that he had a friend coming to dine with him next day, how the following morning he gave rather elaborate directions about this dinner to Mr. Martinson, and how eventually Mr. Fossdyke arrived and asked for No. 11 under the name of Foxborough; they had not known hie name at the Hopbine previously. Further questioned by Mr. Trail, Jenkinson said the two gentlemen drank a good deal of wine, but were neither of them the least the worse for liquor when he left them. Took up a tray according to order at half- past ten with a small decanter of brandy and four battles of seltzer. Two bottles of the selfzer only were drunk, but all the brandy was gone when the chambermaid brought it down the next morn* ing. Heard the voices of both gentlemen raised as if in dispute as he brought up the tray, and as he entered the room heard Mr. Foxborough say, ''The game is in my bands and they are my terms,' or words to that effect. The gentlemen stopped fadlrfng the minute they saw him. Had never seen Mr. FoEsdyke before, and should not have known who he was, but was told by bis roaster and Salter, who both it appeared knew .him. Tbe next witness was Inspector Thresher, whose evidence was brief and business-like. He simply testified to having been sent for by Matlint ob and finding Mr. Fossdyke stabbed through the heart, and stone dead, as de* scribed by three of the previous witnesses. He at once took charge of the room and every thing in it, and telegraphed a brief account of the affair to Scotland- yard. The unfortunate gentleman's riDgs, watch, and some ten pounds odd, consisting of a five- pound note, gold afcd silver, lay on the dressing-table. He knew Mr. Fossdyke perfectly ; he was often over in Bunbury for a day or so ; but usually got back to Baumborough to sleep.' Acd now, wheezing and puffing with ex citement, Mr. Totterdell appears. He is a splendid specimen of that very aggravating species, the discursive witness ; convinced too at this present that the eyes of England are upon rim, and will continue on him for no little time, for the evidence he is about to give before the coroner will but whet the curiosity of the public for the disclosures he will be likely to make at the trial, when everything he wishes to tell is drawn from him by the acute questioning of counsel. Mr. Totterdell is happily oblivious of that other side of tendering inportant evidence— namely, the bring turned inside out by a practical cross examiner, a process that usually gives a wit ness of his description a literal approximation to what a cockchafer's feelings must be with a pin through him. No buzz left in him, but as deadly gnawing at the vitals as even Prome theus endured on his rock. Now, the coroner— who thoroughly under stood bis work, and was a tolerably firm, decisive man to boot, generally kept his jury in excellent crder for instance, and promptly put a stop to irrelevent tendencies in Martin sons or Bill Gibbonses — had this one weak ness, he couldn't quite harden his heart to cut a gentleman short iu similar fashion. Mr. Totterdell, town councillor of Baum borough, in his eyes claimed indulgence not to be granted to witnesses of more plebeian posi tions, and that worthy gentleman commenced his evidence with a little homibtoconcerning hhregretthatheandthelamentedaeceasedhad not of late been on intimate terms. Nobody regretted it more than he did, but it was not his fault ; it all arose from that fatal reticence tbat was the blot in poor Fossdyke'a character, axd here Mr. Totterdell looked around, as if to point out to the spectators the, flocd of light he was letting in upon the case. The coroner, who bad been fiJgetting in uis chair for some minutes, took advantage of tbe pause to say, ' You must pardon my re markiEg, Mr. Tottcrdell, that all this has nothirg to do with the enquiry, and that I must request you to contine your evi* dence as to what jou may kaovy of Mr. Fox borcugh.' ' I am beginning my story, sir, from the first ; it is not probable that any one can throw such ligjit upon this awful crime as myself, and I must request — -'continued Mr. Totter delL 'You're perfectly right, Mr. Coroner,' stuck in Mr. Trail ; ' as watching the case for the Crown I have no hesitation in point ing out first that the witness's evidence so far is utterly irrevelent to tbe matter in band, and, in the second place, I am re quested to say that these details are likely to be peculiarly painful to the deceased's family.' 'As I said before, Mr. Totterdell,' re marked the coroner. 'I must beg you to restrict jour evidence to your personal know ledge of Mr. Foxborough for the present, and what took place between you at Baum borough. If you have nothing to tell us on this point we will not detain you any loEger.' If the coroner had studied for weeks how to extinguish the discursive Totterdell he could have set upon nothing so effectual. The bare idea that his evidence might be dispensed with gave that gentleman a cold shiver. It was in a much more submissive manner that he rejoined, ' I was only anxious to make things as clear as possible, and am sorry that the truth should be offensive to my .god-daughter, Mrs. Fossdyke; but if, sir, in a preliminary enquiry like this, you desire condensed evidence, of course I can give-you a skttch of what I have to teUV' ' Preliminary enquiry.'^' Sketch of what he had to tell' — these two phrases put the coroner on his metal. He had no idea of his court being looked at in that light, and the invpeiti&ence; of suggesting that an outline of evidence was sufficient for his enquiry made that oflicial modify bis views about treating Air. Totterdell with much consideration not a little. 'I have only to say, Mr. Totterdell, that this investigation cannot go on for ever,' he remarked sharply. ' li you have anything to tell us pei haps you will be kind enough to do bo at once without further rambling ; if not, I will hear the next witness.' The fear of not being allowed to tell his stoiy at once coerced Mr. Totterdell into telling it as far as in him lay without amplifi cations, and supported by Mr. Trail, the coroner, determined to pull the garrulous old gentleman up sharply if he attempted any such wild digression as he had commenced with ; but to narrate what we know or have f een succinctly is only given to the few, and men of the Totterdell stamp, can no more helpbeingditfueeon occasions of this kind than they can help breathing. The clear, concise account, so prized by lawyers, scientific enquirers, medical men, &c.; — all, in short, who wish to arrive at facts quickly, as may be — is not possible to many from whom they are compelled to collect evidence. Mr. Totterdell, in vague, wandering fashion, disclosed how he had made the acquaintance of the stranger at the opening oftfe Baumborough theatre, his curiosity, about who people were, his especial curiosity with regard to the deceased, how the stranger had even requested him to spill the name of Fossdyke, how he had asked who Miss Hyde was— and here Mr. Totttrdtll would have been wildly discursive it the coroner had not intervened. Pulled up abruptly on this point the old gentleman narrated, with sundry shrugs and grimaces,how he had picked tip the music hall bill, and so arrived at the stranger's name, 'and thus,' he added, looking round for applause and posing as if receiving the freedom of the city in a gold box, ' was enabled to give valuable information to the police and be of in estimable service 'to my country.' And neither tbe goose that saved the Capitol, nor the first Stewart discovering the gunpowder plot, ever looked half so sagacious as Mr. Tottf rdell at this juncture. Nobody ia the rocm had listened more closely to Mr. Totter* dell's evidence than Sergeant Usher ; indeed, although keeping himself seuulousl/ in the batk ground, not even Mr. Trail was keeping a keener watch over the case. 'Pretty conclusive that, I should say,' remarked Inspector Thresher, as he crossed over to where the sergeant was seated. \- 'Be told all he knew, and was very anxious to tell a deal more he didn't. What a wasteful mature of time it is. It was well the coroner responded so quickly to Mr. Trail, just to curb him up a bit.' . *' What does this next witness know about it'?' 'Well, to tell you the plain truth, Thresher, that's just what I am a little curious to see,' rejoined the sergeant. ' I can't aee bow a young woman from London can throw much light oa it.' 'liOrd! there's no knowing,' rejoined the sergeant, quietly*' 'Itfi astonishing the light P»e seen ttrown upon things by young women in my time.1* , ????'--: . £Uen Maitlandj-ii nioe-lodkiog qoieAly* dmscd.girl, here-stepped forward «od ^an : swercd to her naii^ :$hc s«e^ BEdwMob?iw»ly;m^^ pariowaaiu, she said, to Mrs, For borough, at Tarpon €k-tt«^Begeiit's Park.

Knew that he was suspected of this crime, but felt sure that he had nothing to do with it.' The coroner looked a little impatiently at Inspector Thresher, as much as to say, 'Producing witnesses like this is simply flittering away the time of tbe court.'' Inspector Thresher on his part looked round for Sergeant Usbrr. who in reality was resporsfble for Ellei Maitland's appearance, but that worthy was nowhere to be seen. The coroner signified that he had no further Occasion for the witness ; and shs was about to leave the table, when Mr. Trail suddenly rose and said, 'With your permission, Mr. Coroner, I have a question or two to put to this ycuDg woman.' The coroner signified his assent. Then almost with the dexterity of a con juror, Mr. Trail produced that quaint Eastern dagger that has played so prominent a part in the history of this crime, and turning abruptly on Ellen MaitUnd asked— 'Had she ever seen that before V * The girl half-cttered a low cry of dismay, for she had read enough in the papers to know what that weapon was. She hesitate 1 for a moment, and then faltered forth, a reluc tant 'Yes.' ' Where had she seen it?' ' At Tapton Cottage. It was sometimes ia the dravin£-room, but more generally in Mr, Foxborough's own room.' '?Good Heavens, Phil!' whispered Herbert Moract, 'I know that dagger well. I've plajed with it often. It's nominal me was that of a paper cutter, but a knick-knack more described its status thau auy other term.' ' I am sorry for you,' returned Soames, as he giipped his fricnti's.hand. ' 1 begin to fear jour trouble is like to prove worse thaa my on-n ' ' What do you think,' asked' Beibert, in an awe-struck whisper. ' Bush,' replied Phil. I only know that tilings are looking very ugly for Mr. Fox boiougb. Where can he be ? It id almost pre posterous to suppose in these days! he can possibly be ignorant of tbe awful indictment against him; of the awful crime withwhichhe ia charged.' ' It will be terrible newa for me to take back to London,' murmured Moraut in' tremulous tones, '?It looks bad,' rejoined Phil, 'but we h&vtiri; heard it out yet.' 'Do you know,' resumed Mr. Trail, ' whether Mr. Foxborough tookthisaway with him when he last left London ?' The witness could not say, not to uer know It dge at all events. '? When did you first miss it V ' I have ntver missed it. I didn't notice that it had disappeared.' 'Then for all you know positively,' observed Mr. Trail, 'that dagger might be actually in Tapton Cottage at thi* moment'', 'It might,' but the witness remembered that she had not seen it lately ; 'if that vas sot the same dagger it was the very ditto of it.' Mr. Trail then intimated that he had no other questions to put, and Inspector Thresher informed the coroner that he had no further evidence to produce. Poor Ellen Maitland retired in a somewhat tearful state, produced by the fear that she had somehow worked woe to her mfetress for whom she had tbe greatest admiration and respect. And then the coroner proceeded to sum up. He conpmtntid first on the medical testimony, which as he pointed out was at variance, whereas Doctor Duncome rather inclined to beluve it a case of suicide. Doctor Ingleby was strongly of opinion that the wound was not self- inflicted. It wasquitc clear that who ever No. 11 might be, that the deceased recognised him under the name of Foxborough, and asked for him by that appellation. The evidence of Mr. Totterdell was as yet of small account, as he could not identify the stranger aa James Foxborough, tbe dropped music-ball bill of course going for nothing ; feut if in consequence of their verdict Fox borough should be apprehended, then Mr. Totterdell's evidence as to his identity or not with the stranger at the' theatre would be of the highest importance. He was]only calling the attention of the jury to the more salient points of the evidence, and the testimony of the last witness perhaps tended more to implicate Foxborough than anything else. Ellen Mait land identified the weapon with which the crime had been committed as her master's prcpcity. The motive for tbis murder, if murder you consider it, was-so far unappareut but tbat is by no means uncommon, in crimes cf this description. The facts were briefly these : — ' Mr. Fossdyke comes to the Hopbine to dine with a str&Dge; gentleman, whom he before the landlord and waiter recognises as Mr. Foxborougt, they undoubtedly have some dispute in the course of the evening. Mr. Foxborough leaves the first thing next morn ing, and has notsincebeen heard of, while in the afternoon hia guest is found stabbed through the heart, and the somewhat peculiar weapon with which the crime was accom plished ia proved to be the property of the still absent Foxborough. Of course, gentleman, you may find it suicide, but in the event of your [finding it murder, I would submit to your consideration whether you are not justified in returning a verdicb of wilful murder against James Foxborough' There wss a brief consultation amongst the jury, and then the foreman intimated to the coroner that they had arrived at a conclusion, and, in response to the customery interro gatory on his part, the foreman returned, on behalf of himself and brethren a verdict' of ' Wilful murder against James Foxborough.' The verdict was quite iu accordance with popular expectation, and yet the day's pro ceedings had influenced some of the lookers on in a way they little expected. Mr. Sturton, for instance, now that a verdict of wilful murder was actually recorded against the missing Foxborougb, was purturbed in his mind about that loan of six thousand pounds of which he found the major part not a fortnight ago. It is not that he is anxious about his money, that he knows is well secured, but he is not clear whether it is not his duty to communicate with the police, and let them know how well furnished with funds the fugitive is.' He has as much horror of beiDg mixed up in a case of tbis kind as Mr. Totterdell has pride, and yet he would fain, as a law abiding citizen, do his duty to the' State; still he thinks, as he wends his way to the station, there is no necessity for immediate action. It will be time enough to communicate with Scotland Yard a day or two hence. ' It's, of course, useless asking you to come back with me, Herbert,' said Soames, ' but remember in a week or two, when we have a little got over all this trouble, I shall expect you to pay me your deferred visit.' ' I am only too anxious to do so, but I must go back to- night. You were saying it was a cruel task the having to break the sad tilings of her husband's death to Mrs Fossdyke, bat think, Phil, the story I| have got to tell when I reach London ; to tell these unfortunate ladies what a coroner's inquest has branded their husband and father.' ' It's hard— cruel hard,' replied Soames, as be gripped his friend's hand. ' God send yoa well through it, old man.' 'One moment, Dr Ingleby,' said a voice in his ear, as he was about to follow Phil into the Bunbury train, 'but have you made out an} thing about that letter?' 'No, I am sorry to tell you that so far all search for it has proved fruitless; you still attach great importance to its dis covery?' 'I told you that, sir,' replied Sergeant Usher, ' I told you that letter was worth a hundred pounds a few days ago. Well, sir, I tell you it's worth two hundred now,' and with that mysterious commentary on the re sult of the days proceedings the sergeant disappeared. Chapter XVII.— 'Sergeant Usheh Visits THE HOPBIXE.' Sergeant Usher occupies a second floor in Spring Gardens. It is handy to the Yard and to a good many other places which are in the ordinary routine of the sergeant's business ; railway-stations like Charing Cross and Victoria within easy distance, IVIaryle bone, Bow- street, and Westminster police courts specially comeatable, to say nothing of the Seven Dials, Drury-lane, Sborfs Gaidens, Bedfordbury, and the slums of Westminster, all, so to speak, being under the sergeant's own eye. Air. Usher is a bachelor, he has a mean opinion of the other Eex, probably consequent on bad treatment received at tbe bands of one of them, al though he professes it to be founded on pro fessioral experiences. A profound believer Mr. TJfchcr in the theory of cherchez la femnie. A woman be contends is at the bottom of most crimes, and when puzzled by an intricate case the sergeant invariably takes it that a woman, as yet undiscovered, ia the probable motivefactor. 'Having no fair partner to share hia home the sergeant is constrained in a great measure to do for himself,' and a defter bachelor is seldom come across. Having let himself into his lodgisgs with his latch key after his usually noiseless fashion on his return from Bonbury, the sergeant proceeded to light the fire, throw off his ooots, and then in the easy deshabille of slippers and shirtsleeves, looked hi the cupboard for a gridiron and* couple of chops; these obtained; and the fire by this haSruiK sufficiently burnt up, Mr. Usher pro ceiEded fli»t to broil Ms chopi,wid then to '- x-onsume them with the adjunct* it bread, pickle* &*,«! furnikbid^ th* aamelatt-i pipe, sat doro to smote sM -ruminate W^lll tfcbBrinbury case aafar jmmmmaHK&Sm; ' 'ft is a queer business thi^Mii mott««;-lf (6 himself, f'anditcertalnijr r*jteas^*««*-?*ip Awkward for Foxborougb; ^tM:-yt%, j#bc:-^^] a;i,- the strongest evidence against hloajiM^5?^] himself.

Heitlier oa carpet nor furniture oonM H-; -Usher's well trained eyes detect the sign of a struggle nor the deephned spots he Bought.- The theory might be juBt, but there -was nothing what* *ver to corroborate it . Mr. Usher sat down, lit his. pipe, ordered some spirits.and water, and proceeded to re flect over the affair generally. It FoBSdjke was kuledher* he said to him self, either by accident or design, it was an uncommon well-managed assassination. Not a trace of it is to be found. If he was killed in the bedroom how did it come about ? or is it, despite Dr. Inglebj's opinion, a mere ?ordinary case of suicide. ISo. I don't believe it is a matter of self-murder. That the quarrel should arise here, and Foxborough in his anger Blay him, is intelligible enough ; but that he should have followed him Ionia bed room and killed him without creating a dis turbance seems almost incredible. In bis sleep, yes, but Mr. Fossdyke evidently met his death before he had undr«sed. before ho, had hardly begun to throw his dobheaoS. Fve 'no craving to see ghosts, but if John Fosfdyke's spirit would give mea wrinkle to night I'd be obliged to it, and I ,-doa't thud: I'd be too much agitated to take down tie evidence.' However, the sergeant's steep proved as dreamless as a healthy Stan's after a moderate modicum of grog and' tobacco shoald do. No inspiration came to him from the world of shadows, and as he sprang out of bed cext day he exclaimed, *' The sitting-room won't speak. I wonder whether thk room will disclose the secret of that September evening. The key of the door, for instance, if it was suicide, where is it? If it is murder it may be -anywhere ;- but if the former it muBt 'be here,' and Mr. Usher began an eager and searching investigation of thg apart ment. . It was one -of the best bedrooms in the Hopbine, and so somewhat extensively furnished. Not an inch of the old-fashioned mahogany wardrobe did the sergeant leave unexplored; he turned out the drawers, pulling them out and looking behind them, seeking principally for this missing key. The man had been found dead, stabbed to death in this room— there was no necessity to prove that — but whether it was his own doing or another s wa3 matter for grave enquiry, and to this fact the sergeant was now confining himself, not altogether incapable of noting anything that might bear upon the case, but concentrating himself as great scientific dis coverers usually do for the time upon the' one point. He searched the dravrcra of the dressing- table, he moved the wash ing-stand, he .moved the bed, he felt the carpet all over with his hands and bare feet, he withdrew the gaudy-cut paper device that masked the fireplace, disclosing some few crumpled scraps of paper behind it, but no key. He peered up the chimney, and even felt on either side of the flue, bat he dis covered nothing. He opened the window, examined the sill, and took the bearing* of the flowerbed below. P6saibly the dead man might have thrown the key from thence if he ?were -self- slain. Mr. Usher had best consult the flower bed on that subject, for that seems to be his last chance of arriving at the dis covery he aims at But the sergeant, like many other people in earnest, searching for one truth discovers another ; thatit is a cold, raw, damp morn ing, and that between anonan; window, scant clothing, and an unsuccessful quest, besides tbechilifof disappointment, he has contracted physical shivers. He rings the bell and orders the chambermaid to light a fire and bring him a cap of tea. He a little staggered .Eliza Saltcr by the request, fires In September being an unheard-of tiling in bedrooms in an old Conservative house like the -Hopbine, which rather held that there were seasons for fires and seasons for fanciful papers on the hearth, nob to be interfered with by trifling variations in the ?weather. Still the eccentricities of travellers were wondrous,- and of returned Anglo- Indians anything might be expected, and B anbury had considerable experience of these, the pretty£little town being much affected by these wbileome shakers of the pagoda tree. Eliza soon returns with both tea and kindling, and having placed the former on the table, proceeds to clear out the grate previous to laying the 'fire. Mr. Usher idly watches her, and .with his mind still absorbed on the mystery of the key, stares vacantly at the few scraps of paper the chambermaid has raked out and which still lie within the fender. Eliza quietly continues her work, puts a match to the kindling, and is about to thrust the above-mentioned paper scraps into the grate to assist the new-born fire when Bhe is startled out of all equilibrium by the crot chety old Indian with the ashmatical cough (for such had Mr. Usher appeared to her) suddenly exclaiming— ' Stop, for you life, girl ! Let me see every scrap of that paper before. you born it.' He was but just in time, and as the ser geant often said afterwards, when alluding to the Bnnbury murder case, 'I can't tell to this minute what put the notion into my head.' The clvamber-maid pauses, gd&ers; the four or five scraps of paper ' together, and hands them over to that peremptory old Indian. An impatient pshaw, and the Sergeant con temptuously throws back to ELizi S alter a conple of old washing bills, records of guests long departed; but as he flattens out the third piece of crumpled paper, he cannot re strain from a slight start, and ejaculating with bated breath, 'By heavens 1 it's the letter.' Yes, there it was, unmistakably enough, the note .that had brought John Fossdyke to the Hopbine. A scrap of paper worth two . hundred pounds, according to the finder's own appraisement, cast carelessly at the back of the grate, as a man might ordinarily be supposed to do v^hen dressing for the feast to which su& letter invited him, kept up to that time in order there should be no mistake about time or date IniaUible Key to tne mysteryhaa Air. Uaher pronounced this could it be come by, of which he had abandoned all hope ; and now he has got it and reads it, the sergeant is fain to confess that it is not quite so big a clue as he anticipated. A mere surap of a note : any ordinary invitation to dinner conveyed as much, and it was with a puzzled expression that Mr. Ueher — the cliamheraiaii having departed— for the sixth or seventh time read over the following : — 'Hopbine, Septr. 3rd. ' Dear Fossdjke— Dine with mere here to morrow at 7.30. I have something rather serious to communicate to you concerning our last conversation. Circumstances have im proved my business position regarding it con siderably. I feel sure you will not iail me when you see that I am *' Ever sincerely yours, ' Jasj.es FoicEonouGH. 'Bunbury, Monday night.' And ence more did the sergeant come to the conclusion that letter was 'a ram 'tin.' Valuable, no doubt, and likely, probably, to lead up to something in the future, but it was rather Lard to sec 'the how' of that josfc now. Meanwhile Mr. Usher determined to keep the finding of that leCter entirely to himself. Nobody but Eliza Salter had been present when the discovery was made, and she had not in the Least connected the strange gentleman with the murder further than he was mighty anxious concerning it; An opinion in which a comparison of notes Trith JcnkicEon, the waiter, confirmed her. (To be continued.)
