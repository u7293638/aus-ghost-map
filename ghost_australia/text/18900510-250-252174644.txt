MR. T. G. COLLINGS & '«WAYSIDER." TO THE EDITOR or THE LILYDALH EXPRESS. SIR—"Waysider," the modern philosopher, if he is able to establish phrenology or that of physiognomy to be true and accepted sciences, no wonder that the ghost of Theoprastus should arise to haud him the " chalk." " Waysidor" has drawn for himself a reminder in my own estimation of the Dandy Malvolis, with his yellow stockings, who, when asked by a clown disguised in tones of clerical mimicry—" What! Malvolis? Pray, what is your opiniou twixt fythagoros and water fowl?" The jester and clown, in his originality unmasked, repeated the prayer. " Waysider," remember the yellow stockings, the colour of which is attributed to jealousy. Under the nom de plume your originality is lost; take anothc* hint by the wayside. " Blow not the bugle for the fray The loss ot front teeth for to pay ; But haste home and sing Collings is a de'il amang the Tee'lers. It will be more cheerful than being found in a foe. — I am, &c.; „ , T. G. COLLINGS. South Wandiu, 8th May, 1890.
