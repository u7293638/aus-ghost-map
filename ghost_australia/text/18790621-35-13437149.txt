VICTORIA THEATRE. ] At the Victoria Theatre, last night, another representation of " Hamlet " was given, with Mr. Dampier, of course, as the Prince of Denmark. The attendance was large, and the piece was, to all appearance, greatly enjoyed. There is no doubt Mr. Dampier makes a good Hamlet and in the Ghost scene was particularly effective, the curtain falling j amidst rounds of applause. Mr. Harwood made a tolerably < good ghost, though he did not perhaps throw so much life into the character as he might have done. Of the other characters, Mrs. Bates's Ophelia was the best. It is not a part which suits her so well as others ; but there was very little to find fault with, and that is saying a good deal. It will not be forgotten that to-night a benefit is to be given to Mr. John Bennett, the pieces being Royal Pardon " and " Fra Diavolo."
