Following the Queensland Cham- «4js pion Kace, ran at Ipswich, and won by Mr. Tait's Zje, with Ben Bolt and Van Tromp second and third, came the Hobart Town Champion Race, which was ran on Tuesday, the 5th December, 1861. Like the other Champion Races, it was a sweep of £100 each for starters with £500 added, the second horse to receive £200 and the third £100, three miles, weight for age. Owing to the presence of Ben Bolt, a Weat Australian repre sent vtive, Mr. John Tait's Talley rand from New South Wales, the imported horse Panic, and Mormon from Victoria, the race was more than usually interesting, but the general opinion was that the issue of the race lay between Talleyrand, Ben Bolt and Mormon. A few days before the meeting was to be held, rain Get in, and the stewards found it necessary to postpone the races for l. day. — ? Fortunately the weather turned out fine, but the going was heavy, which of course accounts for the slow time the race was run The starters were Mormon, Shillelagh, Panic, Talleyrand, Merrymau, Sir Hercules, Ben Bolt ( W.A.), Flvinir Doe, Charlea XII. and Livbi stone, and the race eventuated as follows : — Mr. Henderson's b h Mormon by The Premier-Delaware Maid, 4 year8- 98t- 21b (W. Simpson .. . T Mr. S . Blackwell'B bh Shille lagh by Vanish-Matilda ., Ti,9*,1- 5'b- (Dalton) 2 ' Mr. S. B ackwell's ch h Panic (imp.), by Alarm — Mel bourne mare, 4 yearn s *? 61b. (Wellon)' .f M' H Mr. J. Tait'a ch g Talleyrand C wo^hT..^ ^ -4' ' ' ?? .. 4 The betting was 7 to 4, against Talleyrand, 3 to 1 against Ben Bolt, 5 to 2 against Mormon, 7 and 10 to I against others. Mor mon went to the front when the flag fell, and loading all the way, beat Shillelagh by 20 lengths, Panic 12 lengths behind the second horse, and Talleyrand a good fourth, the time being 6min. Hsecs. Mornian's win was a very popular one, and as he was well backed, the few bookmakers who were present had all the worst of the wagering. On the following day Mr. John Tait's Talleyrand won the All Aged Stakes of £150, two miles, behind him being Mr. J. Field's Merryman, Mr. W. Field's Muley, and nine others. Talleyrand was a hot favourite at 2 to 1, and he won in a common canter, the time being 4min. 4aecs. Although Mormon waa not in the best of trim, he was made first favourite for the Tasmanian Handi cap of £200, two miles, which he won very easily from Panic second and Atilla third, behind the placed horses being Talleyrand, Muley, and Cedric. Mormon waa as usual taken to the front and leading all the way, won as ho liked, the time being 3min. 57aec3., the fastest race of the meeting*. Later in the day Aohworth saddled up Talleyrand again, and the constant son of Cossack, fairly ran away from his solitary opponent Shillelagh in the Tradesman's Plato of £100. This brought the meet ing to a close, but as a regatta was also held on the Derwent, the visitors from Victoria and New South Wales then turned their attention to sport o£ another character. The whaleboat race of £100, was won easily by the Sydney crew, which consisted of Dick Green, H. Green, J. Punch, T. McGrath and Cronin. Dick Green also landed the sculling race. Messrs. A. K. Moore and the late S. C. Burt were not so for tunate, however, ia the yacht race, which their boat, the Sui^prise, waa winning easily when she carried away her stem and bowsprit and finished third to Maggie Laurie and Secret. Amongst the visitors from Sydney were Mr. J. T. ('Toby') Ryan, M.L.A.. and Messrs. Burt, Moore, Spain, Yeend, W. Dind, senr., and J. Dind, junr., and judging from the accounts in the local papers the visitors were received with the characteristic hospitality of the islanders. The rowing crew must have created a favourable impres sion, for, after being entertained at a banquew, they were presented with £30. Almost the first Australian horses to race on English soil, according to the English Racing Calendar, of 1876, were King of the West, (late Jacko) by Kingston (imp.) from Lady Elizabeth by Sir Hercules i from Georgiana, by iEther, etc. \ He was accompanied by Commo dore, (full brother to Javelin) by Yattendon from Lilla, by New Ohum, etc. I King of theWeBt won the Harrow I Plate at the Kingebury July Meet M ing, beating an odds on favorite in ft Lord Eldon, and two others, but Commodore who ran twice failed to I distinguish himself. Both horses I were bred by Mr. John Lee of 1 Bylong, and old timers will no doubt remember that Commodore won the A.J.O. St. Leger, of 1873. He statted at 2 to 1 for the 8ydney Cup, at the same meeting, but be ing held at the post by the trainer's son, Fred Winch, he never had the ghost of a chance. The race was won by that rank outsider, Vixen, with Patriarch second, find The Ace third, but the victory of the mare was one of the greatest flukes on record. Just before the start she parted company with her rider, Billy Duggan, and was galloping away when E'.ty Da Mestre caught her, and gave her jockey a leg up. As Mr, De Mestre and some of his friends stood to win a big stake on the second horse, Patriarch, he wasn't altogether on good terms with himself when he saw the numbers go up ! Bange cut up so badly in the Tellers' Handicap at Canterbury, whore she could only get second to Gallina that they wouldn't have her at any price for Tat.eraall'G Tramway Handicap on Saturday I list. The mare, however, was in a galloping- humour, as she fairly ran away from Dozon, Loch Cliveden, and a big field, and aa the six furlongs were cut out in Imin. H^secs., evidently the mare i3 not troubled with the slows. The favourites, Haulette, Gunnedah, and Reviver finished in the ruck, and aB Bange started at lie outside price of 15 to 1, the business of the afternoon opened very auspiciously for the members of the ring. Neither did backers fare much better in the August Btvkes, for which Triem, San Fran, and Nickel had the call in the betting market, but a 20 to 1 chance in Daring cropped up, Stanser second, and Triem third. The winner, Daring, is trained by P. Gough at Rand wick, and as he possesses a fair turn of sjeed, will distinguish himself again at the forthcoming A.J.C. spring meeting. Triem had a very rough passage, and that he should have been nearer the winner was proved by the manner in which, later in the afternoon, he won the Welter Handicap. Ireland's Eye was all the rage, but after a great race Triem just got home in front of Underhand and Lybian, the mile being run in Imin. 42&9ecs. A good field saddled up for the Hampdea Stakes, the weight for age race, but as some of the com petitors were only half fit, backers freely laid 10 to 9 on Dandy. They made no mistake this time as Dandy won in fine style from Vccalistand Hautboy, but this run ning will be reversed before long. Backers wound up very badly at Rand wick on Saturday, as three rank ousiders in Blue Metal Tur bine and Little Joe ran as named in the Spring Handicap. St. Clare, Alix, and johnasen carried most money and good wishes, but noth ing had the semblance of a chance with B ue Metal once h.9 got his head in front. Seeing that Dandy was the only favorite who scored during the afternoon, backers bad anything but a prosperous after noon's outing, but, as usual, the bookies say that they ( only cleared exes.' Lancaster beat a good field in tha Caulfield Malakoff Staices on Saturday, and aB he has only 7st. 121b. and 7st 9ib. in the Epsom and Metrop, he has come into the betting on those races. Last year he was a very hot favorite for tfc.9 Oaulfield and Melbourne Cups, but proved to be a decided frost. There were no less than 17 starters for the V.A.T.O. Grand National Steeplechase, of whom Euro, Mysore aud Chelsea were most fancied. Orusado, Carmyle, Blutcher, Lady Agatha, Stamford, Steersman, The Duke, and Wallaby came to grief, while Mysore who had been well backed from the momont the weights appeared, lost all chance by running ofl5 at tho fourth fenco. Euro ran well, but after negotiating the last obstacle Chelsea had the race well in hand and won as he liked hon Signal and the favourite. Frew, who trained Chelsea has boon very fortunate in thio race, as ho also trained Daimio and Djmino, but the owner, Colonel Campbell, pre ferred the chance of Chelsea' a stable companion, Lady Agatha. The public backed the double — Re~ doeme?: and Chelsea for fill the money in the market, and as he was also heavily backed straight out tho victory waa not a very palatable one to the members of the ring*. The Melbourne Cup horse, Dirk Hammerband, put up a good per formance on Saturday by carrying lOst. 2lb. and running1 third to Fair Sex 8 st. 2lb. and Nitrous 8st. in the Tennyson Handicap at the Adelaide Racing Club Grand National Meeting. What beats me about these adver tising tipsters, eaid the man in the birdcage, ' is that being go well in formed they don't back their tips instead of selling them.' ' Probably that's the reason why they can afford to keep on advertising,' said the other, who had been a bit longer at the game than his friend Lord George Bentick i3 said to havecleared £100,000 in bets during the racing season of 1845, This is claimed to be the record, as though heavy Jbettors have landed big wagers from time to time they were generally out of pocket when the season terminated. Prior to ' Bob ' Suttor giviog 10,000 guineas for the filly by Persimmon from Ornament, the highest price ever paid for a yearl ing in England was 6,000 guineas, given by Sir J. Blundel Maple for a colt by St. Simon — Pleasanterie, afterwards named Child wick. It appears the commissions which crossed the Channel to back tho French champion Perth II for the Ascot Cup, won by Merman, amounted to upwards of £50,000. Some of the keenest critics in Eng land, who shy at laying long odds, want out of their way to bet them on this occasion, and all the while the horse was lame. There were not many Frenchmen present to see the race run. Poor Johnny Crapaud ! After Merman won the Ascot Cup, the 'Jersey Lilly' refused an offer of 10,000 guineas for him. The son of Grand Flaneur and Seaweed has since gone to the stud and has been reserved for thirty mares at 100 guineas each. The list had filled, when the last mail left Eogland. Sir Rupert Clarke who gave 1 200 guineas for La Carabine at the sale of the late Mr. W. R. Wil son's horses, has since refused 2,200 guineas as for her. The offer came from London by oable. j Speaking of the winner of the I V.A.T.O. Grand National §l.eer»lo chase, a Melbourne writer says ; -- He was bred' by Mr. MoWillianW, , -?- of Fine View, Terang, Victoria, ? and ia by Portsea, from Elsie by ) fiiforo. Tho last named being by imported King Oolo, firom tho im- , ported mare Phantasmagoria — ' brooding good onough for anything. When Mr. Me William's stud was broken up, Ohelsoa waa a foal - ' running by tho oido o£ his dam, and Mr. Purchaa, acting' on behalf , \ of Mr. R. H. Frw, gavo £29 for tho foal. Subsequently trainer , i Frew transferred him to Colonel ' , Campbell for £200 and certain con tingencies. ' Adelaide Cntio say a : ' John ' Norton, aged 409 boaGfca that ho never yefc saw a horse race, but he and his backer, * Sterling,' Thomp son, ran a third tote from Truth \ office for four years. Ito profits paid libel cooto, tho rent and other jip;!;; oxoa., and enabled Johnny to buy |if||| hio numerous suburban- properties.' :§||| A turn of 'fortune's wheel. A ||j| Broken Hill minor who drew |||| second prize in one o£ Tattorsall's |||§f recent sweeps, had previously had :|||| a long run of fearfully bad luck. ;;f||| ITirat ho broke his log and had to |||| have a wooden, limb j whoa he re- |gf|| turned to vjotk a fall of ore broke f||| hio wooden, log and hia remaining |f» sound limb aa well. A long term ||||J of hospital followed. He was un- |§g|| fife for work, but investing one of |i|j| his scarce { five bobo' in a ticket in t§|f| Tattorsall's the fates at last took ||||| pity on him. |S| The following are the drawers of |f|| the placed horses in Tatteraall's |§|| consultation on the Spring Handv- f|||| cap, closed with 33,000 subscribers, j|| and drawn pro rata:— First, O. |||| Butler. BridfiresaiHK BWthdale, IIf| Queensland, £2970; second, W. ;l|| 'Whittingham, Oiho-street, Inverell, iff New South Wales, £a91 ; third, |f Mossman Syndicate, c/o J. New- 5f|j ton, Racecourse-road, Charters ||§| Towers, Queensland, £594. The ;;,|| amounts are nett. f|| The woll-known South Australian |i||| sportsman, Mr. E. Barr-Smith, has p|| very generously presented £10,0j0 |||| to Dr. Hatmer, Bishop of Sjuth a Australia, for the purpose of com- ||| pleting the tower and spires of St. pi Peter's Cathedral. || Jndging from the entries made |i| on Monday last, [the approaching ||| spring meeting of the Australian ||| Jockey Club will be of a somewhat j|j| intercolonial character. Victoria lf|| will be represented by La Carbine, ;^;,, Belle, Private Willis Lancaster, fr^i Ampior, Sagacity, Bernice, Paul jl4| Pry, Ranfurly and Malster. 7|/ Eiriadsdile represents Tasmania, ^ a-A Tatquin, possibly, the best ;-;|| weight-f or ? age horse in the colonies, f^ hails from far off West Australia. [l^ The acceptances for the Epsom ^ number 47, while 54 remain in for ||| the Metrop. Tarquin and Paul J|| Pry, the top weights in each, have 'M been accepted for, but they are far M below tho standard of such horses & aa Oarbino, The Barb, Yattendon i|| and Tim Whiffler, the « cracks ' of jlf byegone days. Whatever the cause |B may be, possibly the exodus of our mm best horses to the old country, p| there is just now a dearth of first '^ class horses in Australia. &£- I'K n
