LIVE WIVES AND DEAD HUSBANDS. There's John, reading his news papers. You might drive nails into his temples, and he wouldn't know it. Look at him!—legs up, head thrown back, and a cigar in his inouth—the very picture of absorbed enjoyment. Three papers he has there; he will read them all, till he has gleaned every particle of news. One good hour he has been, at it. Now if I say to him, "John, 'what is the news£' he will reply " Oh, none—nothing in particular. There are the papers— take 'em if you like." Now nobody in his senses believes that John -has been employed one good hour reading." He is just too "lazy the amount of it. NdwjL would/much rather read those papers than mend this coat of his. It is really too bad of John; he might have given me something to thiak about while I was doing it. An ideal Suppose I try this lazy system on him. Nov if there's anything men like when their wives come home with a budget of news, it is to have them sit down and entertain them with , it—not about troubles or servants, but spicy little bits of gossip about their friend Jones's wife, and what the witty Mrs Brown said oa such an occasion, and how the pretty and saucy Miss said if she were Smith's wife she .would——. Oh, don't they like i<f hear all about it ! and don't they- like' to question them as to lioW wom&a; think feel oa such and sucli .feufe- ' Jscts, wjhicli hiformatioii they , pip.-' [ &&y;: ■ obtain 'from their ifriym uSjJ eout'se ihey 4o; and when a brig&fr;: litjtie aaj,. hour or arioi-e, ami told them, wore amusing &ingstJPn; you.

You haven't the ghost |f an idea how horridly stupid you've^ grown! Don't I hate that lethargic tobacco! It is going to revolutionise society, let me tell you. WVwomen are squirrel-like creatures, arid can stand it. No wonder all tfrese awfql trials fill the papers. You needn't laugh. . I tell you it takes two to make home bright. Don't you suppose, you lazy thing, - that- a woman is as much perplexed, and worried, and sick of the practical at tjie end of the day as a man can be ?
