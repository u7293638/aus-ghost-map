Words have yet ta be invented for the suggestion of the effect upon Mrs. gfogll p? Her hugband^s final l^prda. Words belong to art4-^Jate natures; Vrs.

And it waB that very reckless ness which no doubt enabled ier to effect her escape imperceptibly. She h§4 ^eard ^enough ; there was iio need fpr her to lisfen to another wqrtL Marion, as she understood it, was at the bottom of it alL Her husband— the wretched imbecile— was using his power over Adam Furness to fly from his lawful wife with Marion. She comprehended npne of the talk about docks, banks, and shares. Marion was the beginning, Marion was the end. And, as if to goad hex into sudden -vengeance, while passing from the cottage she caught sight of a graceful figure that she hated with' the whole passion of her nature approaching from the river side. Many a woman will comprehend hex first impulse — to attack her odiously triumphant rival with such words as she did know how to use. But some — it is *0 $e hoped not so many— rwiil ap preciate her second y to speak no word: at a^ -^F^^in- .sttfih-ft- caseMBpeech^is put punishment ; silence is revenge.

The universal interest of the candidate fo^Mj^ehgEg^fi in all that concerned, mankind could not jjoasifilyr fail :i*io- -eKterid itself to womanMnd, especially when woman kind took a. concrete form of beauty and mystery. ' Wfea* Jftortal, thougb armed with the qualities of the lion and the fox combined; can boast that he has placed himself beyond, the reach pf discovery —that he has le£$ np, Bpstem «pen, no iflSphple of his fqrtress witioout a guard? Both Adam Furness and- John Heron had thus bpastgd. theni^eiyes, and WJ& ^g?y aPB^Pti ?au6e; The last people on earttl whpm they would have dreamed of fearing would have been'Braycpt Borland and Mrs. Snell, as persons from whom even the most remotely pp,s§ible per il Pould come. And these were no less ignorant of the true nature of the trail upon which they had fallen. Alas ! if one wishes for safety, one must throw force and craft equally to the winds. One must either procure a hundred eyes, a hundred hands,, an.fl a hundred brains ; or else — but no ; thece is no other way. It is not true that murder will put ; but that does ixoi' render the luckiest of murderers any the more praisewprthy on the score of skill. The worst of such tliings is that, when one holds ail four acea in one's own hand, the pack may proye to have a dozen more. ~ Ai±d sq it came to pass that Marion, in devoting her self to. her father, was unwittingly drawing an unconscious chase his way. ?' ?'.'?? '. Draycort Mojland wag in time, and only just in time, to be decently punctual at his meeting ; and then such things have women to put up with when brought into collision with almost any rival, from statesmanship even down to politics— the candidate clean forgot all about Marion. He might haye. but few virtues, and would have told you that ^e resembled his fellpw-creatures in having none, except the honesty of not pretending to hay-e any ; but he had this virtue at least, that wtateypr he was dping fpx the moment he did it with his whole heart and souL Well would it have been for John Heron had he, on this particular occasion, found room for a thought that might have distracted him frpm the tas.k of attacking the demi-god whom the jealousy of Askness had. engaged him to overthrow. He worried his opponent like a bull-dog, only a great deal more -unfairly. It was im possible to find really -weak places in the respectability that enveloped John Heron of Chapter Lane like a: panoply of proof ; but he knew hpw to make respectability, especially of the moneyed, sort, . a . text for a Philip pic full of stinging humor. For the twentieth time he painted Marchgrave as kotowing, at the clay feet of the brazen statue cf Mammon, and altogether made an effect of which he felt not a little proud. It is true that nqt a single holder of dock ehareg was present' in an audience consisting mainly of dock-laborers, who were not even Marchgrave men ; but then, for that very reason, tjie applause was all the more, loud. And, after all, he only wanted to sow discord — not to win ; and to make a noise, and therefore a name. He was leaving the meeting arm in arm with a solicitor of no great repute, who had some spite against the banker, and had been so lost 'to every sense of local . decency as to consent to act as principal elgp^ipn agent ^or *^e opposition. And no doubt ? the candidate found additional zest in his sensational campaign in haying to work with an acknpw iedgefl rascal whose sharp practices afforded constantly fresh amusement and daily objects for psychological study. For Lraycot Marland was a man who, had he been, surprised in his bedroom . at 2 in the morning by an armed burglar, would have? as tonished, the intruder by asking him. to supper, and have kept biro, talking till, having mastered all the mysteries of the craft, they parted the best of friends. YeB, the Miss Burdpns were ?unquestionably right. Draycot did affect low company. The two were passing the Bell — where, it need not be said, the oppo sition candidate was not staving — when a stout, middle-aged person, just entering beneath the suspended joints, attracted the notice of the lawyer. 'Hulloal there gpeB old Murder,' Bald he. ' After the widow I eup P9m-'v . ? - - - *Oid Murder??' asked Morland. ' What an unlucky name I ' -'Wlia1il dotft you know old Murder? Why, ifs the joke of the tovn.' ' ' ' . -* Ah ! I always thought Marchgrave must have some joke or other Some where. No; I never heard, of old Murder.

P'r?aps you might 'make a point ?«f it in ypur'-^ext; speech r— a local aliuBion'B never tiirown away. That was old Prendergast-^a red-hot Heronite.
