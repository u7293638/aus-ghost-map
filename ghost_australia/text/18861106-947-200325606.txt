Isonomy 'has 'furnished much since last year, andis one' of 'the grandest racehorses that has ; j ever appeared : ' at . Flemirigton. ?After 'Sheet Anchor '.flattering his ad mirers at the turnj iBonomy drew away down the straight and looked like winning, until Bbolka1 ' cain'e '? up' on ' the inside and made ,a grand display, fighting, 'out the finish,' and made 'a dead heat' on the post. Lord ^Williarn ' was . fourth ' and , Sheet AncLjprlnext'. ','[ Th' e latter , did' not run so well as expected. ),Colley ,came a little soon.tdThe.borse is very .wett and must be served by i the1 'gallop in 'the 'Melbourne Stakes.-thbugh it is topinuch to'asfc him to defeat a horse like Trident! but ho will run '' forward 'in'the: Cu'pr.j.The dead beat 'was run off after the last race 1,, There was a good, struggle for , the greater part of the way,' j'| but , ; th'.e , .,' Adelaide, ' representative wore' .bis' opponent down in the straight, anjd won easily ...at. 'the, finish in 2, min. 10J sec.', or two and a; quarter faster than the dead heat.,Ispnomy gained some friends for ;lie Clip ,t) jj this performance^ and without doubt Ke' is very fast.' '. The question is whether. be|Will,8tay two 'miles.,' He should be an', improvjed. horse, for the couple of gallop's on ?'Saturday; ,'Twelye faced the starter for ithe Hptham Handicap, tbe most in demand being ' ' Claptrap, and First Prince nexj;,, , favourite. The latter, met jyith'badrluck.'.i As his rider was. trying to get, up. on the inside near the river he was unseated. : Hexham, a Cup horse, ran well ; but' Claptrap, however,won with ridiculous ease; -Salvo figured prominently. All the nineteen' horses coloured 'on the cardi ex ce'pting'Niagarai stripiied for the Maribyr nong, Pjlate, , Lava; /own sister to Yolcano, was first favourite, , ; while. Mistletoe, and Perhaps; .were : next (fancied. . They .were a remarkable fine lot .of two year olds. Hortense scored a blever victory, though if Hunting To»- er had hot 'been interfered with by Lord Carrington'B' filly Esperance, running off at thebommencement of the race, he; would probably have ;tiirned the tables, a'she was; only beaten' by a1 bare, length. Bedouin was 'a good.tbird, and'the favourite was 'fourth1. 'The' time was 'the slowest since vulcan 'won ;m .1877, owing to tue strong wind blowing in: the face of the horses. . The ,, winner , .was bred by Sir Thomas. Elder,, and ,,was-! leased to Mr. M'Donald, who wins very little money in addition to the stakes.. She started about fourth favonrite/ She iB a weil1 shaped and good looking filly, and'as she carried 141bs. penalty there is no qnestion : as to her superiority at present. ;i: Mistletoe died aw^y,to nothing, , and was nowhere at the finish,,, A,,field of seyen.came out for tbe Derby, 'and they were the best lot of horses -.seen i at 'the post ? for' this race for some time. The favourite ?: attracted a great crowd . of ?? critics andr i admirers, and bore thej ordeal well, as he, -stripped :as fit as lie well could be. He isi not a bad stamp of a horse, but is not so neat asChesham, who has come on wonderfully during the last, fortnight,- and was in1.' -good 'form,, though' hot : so; '?;'; blooming1 ] !as Trident. ; 'Aglaps , and' First . Conaul ,'iir'b . ; two' ' fine' , horses, but both went' diit laine,'. and thewformer; had ',(a,j bandage on, one of, : his , fore legs. .^Kingfish, -the Hawkeabury winner, is a .nice animal; and Maddelina is a good sort ofiia filly,'but she 1 was, not in the humour ; she was rather fractious before- starting'arid'ra'n.nbwhere. Tolcano is a great raking ,son' oS. pho'stpr i with a rare dash of pace! ' First Consul dt-- layed; the start for some time, and after all' it ,'was not a good '.', one. , ,Tho race was a rather sensational one, and was won in cx 1 cellent time. Volcano made inabters warm at once; arid the lot ebon-strung out in 'Indian file. Volcano led witlr Cheshatn (until approaching the straight, when ' ho ran.agaiast a post, nearly caine down, and almost unseated' Ellisi Ches'ham 'now made play and led into, the 3fcraighj;, while Tri ' dent, who had been running third, lost about a dozen lengths through Volcanoes blunder, and was now second. Choshaih led down the straightjaud- loud cheers1 proclaiined that the favourite, was beaten, .as Hales ,was hard at work oh Trident. T,ho son of Robinson Crusoe, however, answered with great gameness, arid getting ohi terms with Chesham about dOyardsfrom home forced to the front, and eventually' won easily .by a length. Ho ran as true as, steel, and his victory was a good perforriiance indeed considering the. ground lost, while the .time; notwithstanding the wind, ? was very fast, and has only been equalled by, Mar tini-Henry in 1883. The win .'was im mensely popular. This is the fourth Derby ?won by. the hon;' Jas* . iWhitej'and steered byHale3.' TUe winner bore unmietakeable signs of punishment, but was not 'dis- tressed. Diveraeiopinionslexist! about his Gup chances i some argue against i it, for getting the ground' hoi 'llo'sto/s and, that Chesham 'is an 'improving liorse, the fast time made,that he wiiriiaveilVlbs. -.-off his back, and that he won easily at. last. If he is well on Cup. Day, however, he. will run a great horse, and it is difficult to ? see what can beat him. He ? was -a 'warm favou rite for ? the ' Dorby to the * last, and . of course his -'i win- was a facer for the ring, principally through so much double money standing 'on him. Trident was bred by Mr. De Mestrei .and: cost 800 guineas as a yearling; Aglaos was third, about ten lengths away from the. leaders, and First Consul, who came,with a rush at ,the finish, was fourth. ? ? The Ghost was a great tip for the Selling Race, but Huron upset the pot. The CoburEr Stakes brought out the largest field of the day, including the Tasmanian mare Pocahontas,: who ran well for a time. The favourites all came together, and the rank outsider Daystar won after a fine finish with St. John. .
