CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES [By Telegraph.] Melbourne. October 8. Excellent work was done. The best gallop here this season was done by Mozart and Highland Chief. Mozart brushed along from the mile and a half post to the mile, where he was picked up by Highland Chief, the pair coming home at a great bat. The Cup horse, who appeared to have his weight up, finished in front. Eagle Â©range moved a mile in nice style. Velocipede went in the usual free style for a good serviceable once round, pulling up strong. Grace Darling did a strong gallop the Cup distance, having Clifton and Ghost, who were assisting her, in difficulties the whole way. Blink Bonny and Hippogriff, with light weights up, covered the Cup distance in splendid style.
