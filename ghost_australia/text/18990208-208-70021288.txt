,- NEWS AND A NOTES. - At the conclusion of the business of the Ds ndcnont cinurt of. petty sessions on Tues day,-the Chairman of the "Iench, Col. T. Bl. Hutton made a short address on the action of our contemporary, the "'Advertiser." and ourselves, in publishinga letter signed "Ju.s titia," commenting on the conduct in two special cases, where youths were manacled. as the writer thought, unnecessarily, and otherwise unduly treated, by the police. In his opinion the writer of the letter adopted a cowardly and unmanly course of writ.ng a letter to the press, and hiding his identity behind a nom de plume. If the party felt aggrieved at the action of the police he should in have laid a complaint before the Commis sioner of police, and have the matter dealt with by a board of inquiry. When " Jus titia" reads these remarks. le doubtless will form his own conclusions as to the wiodom Sor otherwise of taking advantage of the he liberty of the subject and writing under a M nom do plume or not, as he thinks fit. As for ourselves, in, publishing the letter, we Ssaw nothing unfair in it and so let' it gio Most of our celebrated writers at times have \- hidden their identity, and a glimpse through m thedgilies will show that the practise is an y every-day one. Eminent counsel gave his opinion that there was nothing libellous or Scowtardly in the letter.'...

Typhoid fever has broken out in the Wes. leran institution for negleeted children, known as Livingstone Home, on Nepean road, just outside Cheltenham. There are two cases at present-A girl about 5 years old and a boy. The girl was sent to the I Alfred Hospital for treatment, and the boy is being nursed by the mother of the home, Mrs. Trudgeon. The building is on a rise and free from the drainage of other houses. The health officer and inspector of the f shire of Moorabbin are making inquiries into the matter. In one of our exchanges "The Austral Light." a periodlinal especially suitable for catholies, and very wisely conducted, an elegant ioem appears. written by our late townsman, the Rev. .. J. Malone, of S.S. Peter and Paul, South Melbourne. Thesub. ject of this beautiful production is" Through i the Bass Forest-A Sick Call." All his friends should buy this number, February, a 1899, of tho "Austral Light," for this piece I alone. We regret our apace precludes the f( possibility of its reproduetion fully in our b columns: we can only give the first eight i lines: " The pale moon sails along a cloudless sky- a Through flying clouds, whose phantom E shadows pass Like speetres one by one o'er the withered " grass. U Where the dead gum trees gaunt aad ghastly i lie. The ghost of the dead forest seems to cry ol In every wind of mountain and morass Iv That wails around this melancholy Bat.a" as Father Malone is a true poet-his vtnrs d hare the poetic ring. .i A man named Francis Fox was arrested a yeterday by Constable Bray, on a charge of " insulting behayiour in Lonsdale Street.
