An Arithmetical Problem. TO THE EDITOR. SIR—If it takes one Corporation laborer 16 hours to dig a hole 3ft. x 3ft. x 4ft., in Commercial-road, how long would it take the 100 men employed at the new dock excavation to finish their work—i.e., to dig a hole about 120 yards x 100 yards x 30 feet ? A friend reckons, that, all else being equal, if the latter work was started when the expulsion from Eden took place the last pile would have been driven on or'about the day that Methusaleh yielded up the ghost. I'm inclined to think that he's given to exaggeration ; but, as {some fellow-ratepayers might like to "figure it up," I send the problem to the News. Yours respectfully, VIR.
