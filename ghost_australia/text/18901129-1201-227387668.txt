SPORTING. i m . — • • — - Tlie Geraldton Carnival is over, and although sonic enjoyable sport was seen, we are no nearer tlie winner of tlic Perth Cup than before. * # Mr. Kotton for, perhaps, obvious reasons declined to show his hand, and consequently the first idea we shall be able to gleau of their merits will be on the training ground, and then we may expect a repetition of last year's clever tactics. \- # * # Mr. L. C. Burges appeai-s to have scooped most of the boodle at Geraldtou. He won the Maiden Plate and Greenough Stakes, on the first day, with Warlock, aod 011 the second d jy, with the same horse won the District Plate and also won-the race of the meeting, the Geraldton Cup, with Lottery. # # * It is difficult to account for the in and out running of the sun of Randwick—Sir Hugh Mare. On the first day lie was badly beaten in the Murgoo Handicap by Jilloong, who conceded him 71bs., and also by the indifferent Irwin at level weights. Eroo, with 71bs. less, also came in lengths in front of him, and yet the next da} r he turns the tables, and beats what we know to be a good horse, Burgoyne with apparent ease. * * * 1- - The defeat of Burgoyne was a disappointment to his owners, who hoped that in him they had a chance of taking down some of Kotton's cracks. # * * Somnolence was, apparently, the best of Darlôt's lot. or else it is true that St. Ives had gone off. The daughter of Somnus—Debris, made a big bid for victory in the Victoria Cup, and with ylbs. the better of the weights in the Geraldtoa Cup, it was fully anticipated that she would win, with Burg03 f ne second. But Nemesis came in the form of Lottery, who rewarded Mr. Burges for his pluck in the past. # * * It will be remembered that last year Lottery also went off with a strong lead, and was only caught by Wandering Willie at the straight. *** Bui-goyne may have been a bit off colour 011 Thursday, if not he is not the liorse we hoped to see, and he had better be sent'back, as upon Geraldton Cup form he has not the ghost of a show in Perth, notwithstanding lie is lightly handicapped. - Mr. Burges' winnings at Geraldton amount to £175, as follows : — Maiden Plate .. . .: £30 Greenougli Stakes ... ... ... 25 Geraldton Cup ... ... ... 90 District Plate ... ... ' 30 £175 He was also rew arded with deafening cheers as his horses weighed in. * # * Betting in the Perth Cup and Hailway Stakes has already commenced. Several, books are talked of. The following are tlie principal wagers up to the present :— Two Terrors, 50 to 5. • Terror and Duke, 50 to 5. Two Dukes, -SO to 5. Will 0' the Wisp and Duke, 50 to 5. • Will 0' the Wis 10 ahd ; Terror, 50 to 5. Ï This looks like making a hot favourite of Towlon's lot. ## w The acceptances for the various races at the orthcoming meeting of the W.A.T.C. are ore satisfactory than was expected considerng that it was feared at one time that the eeting would degenerate into a private one for Smith & Co. * # #_ We hear that the United Service Sweep on the Perth Cup is filling up very rapidly, and those who want tickets should apply at once. It is a curious fact that the United Service Sweep 011 the last Melbourne Cup was the only one filled. Folks will # stick * to the old house. * Wonder whether we shall have a visit this year from Great Scott and General Jacksou, to boodle down the public, and fill the pockits of Kotton & Co. # # # Messrs. Darlôt Bros, have sustained a severe loss in the death of Agitation, a bay mare by Panic—Atholine. The good old mare has gone to the happy hunting grounds where there is plenty of feed and 110 racing. Agitation lias often created Agitation in the minds of her backers, but now there will be no Agitation because there is no Agitation. Thanks just had one ! * # * At the Bunbury Show the horses were numerous, and especially as regards draught mares, most superior. Mr. Locke was well reresented as regards blood horses. Old sonomy was looking in grand fettle and well deserved the first prize. A j'earling, a son of his by Lady Kate was very much admired and of course took first prize. He very much resembles liis half brother, The Czar, but as he has all the best points of his sire, he ought to make a better show than his brother has done.
