The accuracy of the statement can be tested by those who grow sweet peas and are troubled with OlfiR !— ' ( iGina tnai/la i . i -n a BBiu q rourtn avenue dealer in pianos yesterday afternoon ' I have discovered the greatest fly trap on earth, and I want to show it to you.' He lead the way to an instrument at the rear' of the store, on which was a newspaper. Ot. the paper had been placed a bunch of sweet peas. At least 1000 dead flies were lying on the paper in the imme diate vicinity of the bunch of flowers. ' I threw these here by chance,' he continued, and in about 10 minutes I happened to notioe that al most every fly that alighted on the flowers died in a ®ry short time.- Even as be spoke nutti er of-- the insects which had stopped to suck the deadly sweet had toppled over dead. They alighted with their usual buzz, stopped moment- anly, quivered in their legs, flapped their wings weakly eeveral times, and then gave up the ghost." b r Glen.
