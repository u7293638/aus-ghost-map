SOME opportune enquires 1 into effects of the operation, of the Factories and Shops Act in Melbourne have served to empha sise the extreme difficulty of arbitrarily enforcing such provisions 'as that relative to the minimum', wage'/withdult creating worse evils than those wliich ittwas design ed to cure. Undoubtedly' facts and figures can''he marshalled (to.-prove-(that in veyy many cases this; section’of, tlie.measjire'has heen productive,of. great: benefit: to opera tives.

A typical case is. eited. in which a man sought work at-a wage .below.,the :statutory minimum; an employer offered to engage him on the terms proposed,, which appeared to be com mensurate’with the impaired value-of his labor, :but an inexorable’ law stood .-in the way of.his finding.employment and obtain ing the means of subsistence: The case- is .one of many. ■ One member: of the board to whom such applications are referred re marks 5 that' during the past week, three instances of this class have been brought under liis notice, and, he adds, it is most distressing to anyone responsible in. any small uegree. for the,board’s regulations.to feel that the operations of the Factories Act, and the regulations arising out of it,' ore acting in the direction of compelling a British workman to sue the authorities for permission -to'’’earn 1 -an'-’honest?' livelihood.' “I freely admit,""jsays this authority, "that the average earnings of the opera tives actually in work have been substan tially increased by the operation of the minimum weekly wage, the establishment of piecework, rates; and the ' of boy labor. Those in employment, of course, form.,a-large.majority of the .workers;-!but it is no consolation’to those'operative's de barred from,working by the conditions now prevailing to know that the conditions have .operated to .the advantage of those more favorably circumstanced than;them selves.' In fact, it is obvious that if a cer tain class are excluded from working it must tend to increase the demand for the more favored 1 services." One clothing manufacturer acknowledges that the .minimum is now the ruling rate in his fahlofyC" arid that 'ffiso; Machinery is coming into far larger*use than formerly.
