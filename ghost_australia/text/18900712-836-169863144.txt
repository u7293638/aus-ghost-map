'Tha Palatine I Tho Palatine I'1 Theso words passed tram lip to lip as the daoosra poured out of tha hotel parlors to gazo at sonistbinB away off on the murky waters that spanned the shores of Blook Island.' . The evening was dark and dreary. Only now and then a star struggled into viow from behind cr cloud, and tbe pretty girls and the few baaux that oould be mastered from the. whirl of the cities preferred a danco in doorB to.' spooning ' on the piazza.

'What ia the Palatine?' inquired Kate Willard ol the Harvard atadent upon' whose; arm ehe hung. . . ' Have you never heard ot Brock-Islsnd'a famous ghost? Miss Willard, you know every place of any note nas its spooky legend, and this sea girt isle ia not behind the rest of -the world. In fact, here tho supernatural takes 'npon itself a unique form in tho ehape of a sea ghost; in other word?, it is aborn ing ship that is seen off the sborerand then disappears.' . . , .
