The Bight Eev. the Lor.l Bishop of AdelaHe to the Rev. T. Hlnnoy. Adelaide. Januarv 10. 1859. Dear and Reverend Sir— When men uiiur iu reusion or politic! ths sooner Hi. 7 Kol to understand the prin cipls or supposed rrineiplo which ilivldes them the inAittf «?» thne IIVpK- either to ncrrce or differ irreoon cilably. Si- far, ili.ire'ore, fr--m b:ing ' off^n ied by the observation V which von hive mido ou my second letter, I am thankful to learn from s - eompoteut an authotlty 'th-; mod's of thouirht and foelinir prera'dit In thenon Episcopal denominations ;' and ' tin way in whlcU they look at cerlain ecclesiastical subjects.' In England it always so .-mod to mo impossible to als enRajro thoso subjtc'.s trom tho Burrouudlnif medium ; to separate them trom extraneous matter, so aj to look st them simp!) in tho light of God's Word Interpreted by spiritial understanding. In this colony, on tha con trary, where tho great offence to your co-relUlonUts of a State Church docs not exist, [ thought rcliirious ques tions, and amoncr them that of Church Union, might be approached from all sides clear of that ' inlra;c' which dooeives tlio exploior by exaggerating or dlitprting object*. Nevetthrless I have ohservcJ from time to time invidious references made to past abuses or pretenl difficulties of the National Eatablisliod Cburch or Eng land, as i( they were of tho esscnon of Episcopal disol« plinc, and not the accidents of an establishment Inter woven with tho State (or mnra thin ono thousand yosts; while, on tho ollwr hand, the Isolation of oar clergy from n»n-Episeopjlian ministers, not so much personally as tniniittri-iUt/, has not been referred (as you now truly do) to its real oause, vl*., their contcientiou* holding fa&t; that whi^ch they bcliova to have apostolio and scriptural authority, but to tho mere pride of social position, or tin domineering spirit of a State- favoured Church, or a Baronial Episcopate, Had it been all along s;en, us you now clearly see, that we cannot recognise your ord-M (though wa do not take upon ourselves to r. jjet as ineffectuoui your minis terial acts of bipt'muif in the name of the Father, Sjn, and Holy Ghost), 1 should not havo been asked, as I have frequently been, to admit non-KpUu -p.iUau minis ters to tffliiato in our churches, burlal.gr«uuds, school reoms, and to co-op-rite with them In woiks essential to the prophetical office of the ministry, sneh as distri bution of religious tracts, misslo.ta to tho bmh, Sdiidsy »chool teachers' union, and lately to opju our pulplu unconditionally for their use. The rule, honcv«r, on which we aot has been plainly laid down lor us. Wo do not forbid uon- Episcopalian ministers to 'cast out devils by preaching Christ'* name and Gojpol, tecawe they folloa notui;' lut neither, on the other hand, do we find any warrant ior ' following' them*. Compelled, then, from time to time to refuso such ap plications, I was uot sorry to scirs the opportunity pre sented by your a-rival in South Australia uf making it qui',4 char 'why,' and 'ichy only,' wo hoid oui« selves ministerially a\aaf from non- Kpiscopalianrainisjerf, though, as with mytel', to nritlt my brethren, our jmW« andp(rsana£'feclingdo(icn kick agaiuil' OUT solemn convictions and pledges. 1 would limply ask you to read the following extracts from the Preface to our Ordination Ssrvioe, indtheTwcuty-third Article, Iu order tojudgefalrly ofoar positijn:— 'It Is evident unto all men diligently reading the Holy Scripture and anciuut authors that from the Apostles' lime tlioro have b-cn theBe orders of ministers in Christ's Church— bishop?, prie ts, and deacons; which offlt'cs were evermoro had Iu such reverend esti mation, that, 110 man might pretume to execute any of them except Ih were tirat called, tried, ciamtucd, and tcuown to liavo such qualiti s as are requltiio fur the same; and also by pubic praicr, with imposition of hands, were approve I and odml teii thereunto hy lawful authority. And, thermore, to the intent that these Orders, nay be continued, and reverently used and es teemed in tht VnileA Church of England aud Ireland, no man shall be uccountud or ukon to boaiawlut bishop, priest, or deacon in lha United Church of Eng land and Irelunri, or tuffkrtd to execute any of tbe said functions, except he bu uallcd, tried, examined, and ad mitted thereunto according to tho l.irm hereafter fol lowing, or Aafl' Aad formerly Episcopal consecration or ordination.' ? : Article XXIIf.-Of Mlulitcring iu the Congregation. ' 'Itisnot hwful for any man to take upon him the office of publio preaching, or mlniilerin? the laoramonts in the congregation, before he bj lawfully called and ?ent to execate the same ; and those wo ought to ju ge livfully called and sent whlih bt chosen aud called to this work by men who have public authority giver, unto ?hem In the cotiRri'KaiLn tocall'and send ministers iuto the Lord's vineyard.' Asa matter of history, it stands recorded that Whlt tin- hamwaa deprived in 1670 nl the Deanery of Durham, andTravcrs of the Lectureship of tho Ti-in pie, because they had received only l'resbjtcrian ordluation at the hands of certain rniuisters on the continent ot Kuropo. Could 1 then, as an honest man, invito you to preach In our pulpits? Uw as I could not da so, I fi-lt ' pressed tu spirit' to nhoir you how 1 nnd niiiliitti''e« of others it the Church of Kngland valued piety, eloquence, and abilllj in non-Ep'iciiijali.n miiji-tcrs; ;md boir tnuoh we wUhed that thr.y would ricomidtr tlioie piiut-- of discipline which they number with 'things indifferent,' but which let Are bound in conscience to lioiJ lusi us being of apostollo origin and pocsessing »crip:ural authority. Neither Lutheran*, nor CulvinUU, nor Wesleyans, nor ?ven'Mndcpeniienl' Indcpcndtnti, like yonrself, nssert Episcopacy -ir Creeds to ba unsuriptural or unlawful, though they maintain that they are 'not of obligation'' Non-Eplscoptilians then would violate no rule of con science by adopt injr either one or the other; either* freely-elected Episcopate in ita primitive form, or a form of iwund words, whereby 'the sunk fence' of whioh you speak, betmen tho Episcopal und more recent Denominational I'rcsbjterian CUuruhes, would sa far be filled up and disappear. If it sivours of ' aisameil tupsrlorily' oil my part in venturing to point out for consldi ration this condition ofunion.it is a superiority forced up in mo, and not of my creating— ctnauatlng from former acts of nonEpls cop ill an loJIes. I cannot rcTcrso the history of the Ciiuroh for elifhtc-cn centuries; but I mlUw 'dictated' nor 'offered' terms of union. I simply stated what we bcliovo to be our 'scriptural and apostolic' rule; and asked uon-Episcopitian minister*, in tlieso days of free thought and ' indi- pendcnt' Independeuoy, to consider whether future union of ' evangelical Churches' on cer« taio principles were possible. I am not sorty that some fow eager spirits, who at tempted to clear the 'sunk fenoa' at a bound, should have stumbled and fallen therein; or, to adopt your military metaphor, they have not nlown in the counter* scurp of tlie ditcn, and plmtcd their banuors on tbe breich of a ruined t'pisc opaoy. That lortress we oannot abandon, btcanso vr6 believo It* bulwarks to be of apostolic origin aud to have the sanction of Scripture. And If our noa-Episcopalian friends cannot joiu it and form part of the itarrison, let them belitvo and givo us credit for actiug 'consciintiously' in maintaining our ministtrial itscrve. Let them cease to talk of 'domi- na -t Church,' ** Intolerant hierarchy,' ip., as tbe osass. of disunisn. We have as much right to nmiin Kpisoo paliana as they had to become nou-Kpiit'opahans. The foxes in the fable were justified in declining to reform themselves by a ' fraternal curtailment.' Nor was it mcrel) with avion to remove 'the mid wall or partition' between the Church of England and thoso bo.iies rvhicfr huvo dlssentod from it that 1 thought the rcadoplion of the Episcopate an indisponsaUo prelimi nary to Cliurch Union. If oneness, outward as well as inwurd, forranl as well as spiritual, ha the normal state of Christ's Chnrch militant as noil as triumphant; If we may hopo 'tbo Gonpel and true Church of Uotl' will finally emerge f.otn Tridentlnc, Medieval, or Patristio urror, then tbe 'idiosvnerim' also of the Eastern and Gr»ek mind, «s well as of Southern Christian Europe, must be tuken into some account ; an 1 it certainly would be a greater *' miru-ln' to reform th aa Churches Greek, Uoman, Syrian, Itusrian-ioicn to ti e platform of John Enoi— thaH that you anl other cvangelioal ministers should ba willing to tit fide by sido with Uiships in «otns Council lite tint of Jerusalem, when Paul and Barnabas and Simon Peter, with James pre siding, gave forth t he decree asjented to by tho ciders and tbe brethren, condemnatory of a Judus'.iiif,' Christianity. Whether a tnoro cxtendtd 'fraternization' might not thns result, not only between the clertiy of oar Churoh and non-Episcopalun Dissenting ministers, bnt Luthe ran, Swiss, urn! branch difinos; whether an uiueriptural 'di'iiominatioualism'— ' 1 ara of Paul, and 1 of Apollos, and I of Cisphan'— would not thu« help to fill up the 'sunk fenct' between us, and render access to a church caMioiio inform as well as spirit ensy on all tides; whether Heathen and Mahometan Anlithrists or thoM within the Church itself, viz., thn unbelief which denies the Lord thai, bought u»— iho Father and tbe Son; or that which exalts the crcaturo — sacraments, priest, or ssint ; bo ru to keep le«s in view tbo Saviour himself (a tcill-icorihip which He otdained not); whether, I say, Ducn eucmics of God and Christ will give way more readily if uuiou wer.5 rendcrcl posiible by tbe spirit of love loading us 'to walk by the same rule, and hi honour to prefer one anoihcr,' I do n9t presume to decide. 1 have simply proposed tho question for con sideration. But I ant reminded by you thai something more than identity of church government, or «ubs:ription to the orthodox creed, woulJ bo necessary to open yourpulpita VMho Anglican clergy. I return tbeu to this stcand preliminary condition, viz , «ub»criptton to a creed, wllioh \ou pronounce to bo laefTMtaal to procure doctrinal purity in pulpit ministrations. 1011 describe some cldwrmctt of our Church asltomau in all but iiam», and othem u IUtbn»Mst», neither of whom oa any a/want would you euflVr to preach in your palplt. Neither would I suffer them to preach In ffdue. But I proposed nothing of the tort. That preliminary condition of subicriptiou to a cr«d might remoroen eiistini? birrier, but would compel no exchango or pulpits. Liberty raitfht have been trained, but no com. imlsion Introduced. Certain condition* bslnjr pre. 1 opposed, it wemed poislblo th&t; liko Pftcr Martyr and BucW in the 36th ccnlur.v, hC. in these dsys, D Aublyne or J.'c4nder, Chalmers, Cummltic, or yourself, mUht bo beard (perhaps to ad»antage) in St. Paul's or Westrainitsr Abbey— a position for Christian InQuence which lh« p«tor of tho -Vcigh Houbs might not »lto?ether dcsilac, though he might think: it beneath him to cov.it. From thtt fact, hovjcvcr, that In epito of our Articles thero aro Komanizing and Ration iliet, clcrcym- iu in our Church you draw tbe conclusion that formularies of the faith are. tueleia. Von also state, as a matter of faut, that the exchange of pulpits .batwisn non-Eplioo« palir.n rainincrs, CotujreiralionalUt, tt'eslcjan, Freo Kirk, and IJipllst Is far more carefully guarded than Is acoesi 10 thoso of our Cliurch.

Hit Lordihip also places at our disposal, for publication! the following letter received from Mr. Binncy, which he is not apcciallv authorized to publuh, but which he tbinkt will only do jusiico to Mr. Binney'i Bentlmeuu and Christian feelings :— Glen Urqatiart, the Sreen Hills, Victoria, Uecembir2d.lS53. To the Right Rer. the Lord Uithop of Adelaide. My Lord— In a last revta ot the letter which 1 had the honoar to transmit to joor Lordship by last mail, 1 withdrew the sentence which I have marked iu thi encloW pieca of proof. There it nothing in ths words but what logically lollom from tho pow-ir which a Cdngre-ational mliiiiter ha over lin oiru paiplt— ihe jealousy with which we giurd it agaiait the iiitratiou of doctrinal error, from the imp .rtaueo we attach to evangelical trulh-and Uie convictiou we bare of serious depat tares frnm that truth, ia ddT.Teut airectlaus, l-j many of the cl rsjr. The words contain nothing but whu follow* frjra these thin»«— wnethcr our views of the Gospel (uvuuelical tralb) b« soriptaral or nor, or whether our 'couviotion' respecting the ririaus forms ofcledcaloplniunbe right or wrong. Still, for maoj reaaons. 1 Uiooiht it beat to withdraw tht words re ferred to. Your Lordihin. therefore, will do me the favour to regard tlicra as nithdrawa.* I waa very unwell while viiitiug at Taorak last week; I was obliged to ab.ulu from all public duly last Banday; I am low between 20 and 30 miles away from Molbourue, at a mired elation, ia a beautiful locality. A celebrated philosopher and metaphysician used tj say that all his great aud ditBoult problems, nice distinc tions, and fine theories seemed to vanish into thin air a*ier he bad had a good dinner, and was in tho company of warm aud genial fneuds. Ttwre is somethluij, how ever, better thau this.

How littla one hceils the noise of the world ot men afar off— the strugglo of parties, the cluhinz of opinion, the controversies, political or reli gions, which -cem so imporuut when we are in the midst of them 1 1 wish jour Lordihip was here, sitting with me in the sunlight; bow soon we should be able to pat everything right! May we meet in that world where there will bj pothing to put tight, and where we shall hive something bitter to do than either to mend or moorn over the ertU ol this! VVisbiug you, my Lord, in the language of tbo old country, ' the compli ments of the season'— ill the blessings ire wish for one another at this happy time, I am, truly and much, jours, T. PINNEY. * The words which Mr. Binney wishes to withdraw are the following :— ' There are many among the clergy whom I woald not saQer to preach to my iteopie— tue lubstencB of their teaching being, for the moit part, as I believe, either chaff or poison.'
