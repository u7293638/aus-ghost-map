TIT√çY G VISIT TO THE LOWER MURRUMBIDGEE AND THE LOWER LACHLAN. fIi on the laboral Times, March 31.) WE take the following from a lecture delivered by the Rev. R. Henderson, on his return from the Murrumbidgee to Victoria - "Some sixty miles upwards, from the junction tfflioLacblBn with the Murrumbidgee, stands Hay, the chief town of all that district, Maude, some forty miles further down, consists of a store, on hotel, and a few other houses Booligal, on the Lachlan some fifty miles across the plains, is much larger, and promises, ere long, to increase coii-iilcriilly, owing to the rapid settlement of the country bird ml, Cooba, some twenty miles higher up, con- needs only (two hotels, ashore and the strain s house. But Hay is a considerable squatting town, with about .o0 inhabits nts The ground surveyed by Government' is found to be inconvenient, and has been, by common cons mt, abandoned for the present site Some say that a publican lnvinglreferred the latter to the former, erected an humble hotel there, and that this, as in many other cases in the bush, more than any thing else, determined the portion of the town It stands on the northern side of of the river, and is reached from the south by a punt The day that 1 mud, the tin was 15 degrees in the shade I had travelled all night across the Old Man Plain, having left Pendulum The night before, at nine o'clock I was assign id next day, towards noon, amidst the bent of a blazing sun, to find hearty welcome under the hospitable roof of a friend. The vital liar to wash was at once made and eagerly accepted Its refreshing influences they only can know who have had a more money In a hot climate, amidst dusty roads. Like other Australian towns, II a v is defective in compactness and the popularly of its buildings. Left very much to themselves, the inhabitants in young townships follow the bent of their own fancies, both as to the style and position of their dwellings and shops. There is no local authority to control these matters, and it not frequently happens that everything but homage to the genius of order and beauty l rev sails For its size there is a large amount of business transacted in it. This nri being trained in the new country beyond the Lachlan, and, second, from the great distance of the stations in all that neighbourhood from Melbourne. Throughout the year as the necessities of the people arise they are most conveniently supp led at Hay, and thither, therefore, they send for what they want And as the stations are large, and their demands, especially in shear- ing time, considerable, it will be seen how the town, though comparatively small, does a really creditable trade Owing to its central position in that legion-but generally owing to its being on the northern side of the Old Man Plain, and in the direct line of the road to Fort Bourke, on the Darling, and the rapidly advancing country intermediate between the Lachlan and the Earling-its prospects of growing prosperity are thought to be most encouraging. The rohssitaiits are full of hope, and are conti fully anticipating a steady improvement in their affairs till within ten months ago. they had no day school, and strange enough, the tucker was one of my old shipmates. He speedily dalma 1 me on my arrival as a fellow passenger, and reminded me of many a pleasant incident on the voyage we made together on our way to Melbourne, but up to this day there is neither church nor minister of any denomination within eighty miles of it Away northwards there is no minister at all, so that, having reached Hay, I had evidently got to the outside of the ecclesiastical world, so far as this west continent is concerned. Occasionally ministers have paid a dying visit to the town, but, with the exception c of Mr Cm per, i f Roke- wood, one of the Geelong Prcsbv (cry, no other minister till I went had ever systematically visited the st it was up and down the Lower Murrumbidgee " No one ever comes here," as an old black shepherd one day said to me, " to t 11 us whether we are doing right or wrong " On my way to Hay, a distance from Kyneton of about 250 miles, I found Mr M-, a squatter from the far north of Queensland, from some 100 miles inland from Port Denison, in the com- partment of the train that I entered He used to keep a store in Castlemaine when I first knew him. He rem marked that there is nothing like 8qiiultiKb, and that he would as soon think of returning to the old country as to storekeeping He and his partner have a run that is capable of carrying 20,600 sheep, though. they have only a few thousands yet They have three rainy months in the year namely, December, January and February They have beautiful weather the rest of the year, and abundance of grass They knew nothing of ague, and live in ii Kind of terrestrial paradise. They know nothing moreover, of hot winds, though they have hot enough weather, the country is thinly timbered, the plains are of vast size , the stations are at the very least forty miles apart, they are often 100 to 150 miles apart, they have no lawyers, no doctors, no teacher, and no ministers They rule great distances, and are chiefly annoyed by the aborigine, who keep them in constant anxiety when sleeping out at night on their journeys across the country They scarcely ever in travelling remove the saddle from their horses, they keep them close at hand, ready for use in the event of danger, and as he said they naturally enough exclaim on taking up of a morning, I thank God, were safe once more. the appearance of Bendigo as we dashed through it was wretched in the extreme, Every thing seemed bunions. It looked like a vast brick-kiln The utter absence of trees and grass, thL diggers humble dwellings, and the rigged tenements of the Chinese, together with the rugged surface of the deserted flats and gullies, once same with crowds in search, of gold, presented a tent eiisenlU anything but attractive of The plains beyond were grassless and barren and deserted by flocks and herds and every living thing. In vain as we advanced further rorthdulwo look for life, save and except two wild emus on Mena Plums, time enough mall truth then from poverty and drought, and now and then a few parroquets on the wing. I saw nothing in the shape of times of late for 150 miles. Echuca is very much larger since I saw it, and will ere long become an important and thriving inland town The crisis through which it has passed will by-and-by give way to a healthier state of things, and rid it of the bad pre canneries has won for insolvencies and mysterious disap- pearances The country near Deniliquin is highly interesting to the traveller, who can see beauty in the landscape, even where there an neither hills nor depth nor running streams Amazingly level, it is often beautifully diversified with plains of limited extent, bounded with graceful clumps of tree", terminating in wavy points But the famous Old Man Plain, between Deniliquin and Hay, mast b3 to any but a bushman a wild and dreary solitude for the first thirty miles there is bush , but the moment you leave AVan garden, a little township, consisting of two hotels and a store, till we reach the mer timber, there is nothing but solitude The grimness of the plain culminates at the Black Swntim, the supposed resort of "The Flying Cob," the ghost of a my sterious horse and his rider, who love, it is said, columns those parts of a night, to the terror of travel Itrs Nothing relieves the monotony of that dreary journey save the changing of horses at Wanganella, Pine Ridge, smlThoCuuis holds It is wisely made in the summer season during the night.
