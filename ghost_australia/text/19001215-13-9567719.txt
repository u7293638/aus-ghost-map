I A CENTURY OF ENGLISH j LITERATURE. by WALTER MURDOCH. I ' LEE-The NOVELISTS. I In the fiction of the nineteenth century we are face to face with a body of performance so vast and so varied that to judge of its great names, to discuss their relative merits, is a task of extreme difficulty How are we to compare for in stance, two writers who diverse in purpose, method equipment, temper, as Sir Walter Scott and Mr George Meredith' The novelist in our time plays many parts he is now a popular preacher, now a social reformer, sometimes a satirist of manners, sometimes a student of history, and some times just a plain artist and the author who is of no account in one of these roles may be supreme in another Is there anyone indisputable standard by which we can test these varied excellences, any common measure by which we can weigh and compare novelists who seem at first sight to have nothing in common but the name' There is such a standard, and there is only one The business of the novelist is first, and second, and last, the creation of characters 1 fruits fail, and love dies, and time ranges, and lavery literary fashion grows in its turn a weariness, but men and women will be interested in men and women to the end of the chapter In considering a novelist s claim to greatness, then, we simply have to consider how many of his men and women take their station, and what station they take, in the society of rom ince, how many are e tizens of that city where the sons and daughters of genius he met together and do con i verse, where 1 ahliff breaks his tests, and Mr Shand), Senior, philosophises upon them, where Pinson Adams and the Vicar (of Wal held of course there is no other vicar here) contend, without rancour, on a point of doctrine and John Jones carries on a secret correspondence with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, where Sir Peter col Laborites with Benedick in a hammock on the sex, and Hamlet's soliloquies are pure rented by Mr Bluebells immortal 1 large' The citizens hail from all times and all place from france and Russia, Rome and Athens, and for night I know, I Timbuctoo We no belo concerned only with the English of our own century) How many of these are under free of that goodly company' The gatekeeper, ve whose name is Criticism addresses allcomers with the simple but stern find searching question, 'Are you alive' ' On the wrong side of the gate you perceive many figures that once strutted proudly) in the public eye Here are the young curates of Trollope bob sobbing with the gay day here of James (whose Vttili, by the way, seemed to London to be ' almost the best novel of our days ' but there is much virtue in an almost and very little in Landor as a critic) What Pelhim m) fine fellow' Who would have thought to meet such a person as you in case re gions Lothur, took What can they have been thin) ing of to refuse admittance to so magnificent a young man Am was Leigh, as I lived-in, I am lost most obliged, most humble servant, when we want in) Dons cubonadoed, we shall make bold to address you Here is Deronda battering it the gates in vain, and there is Diinl Grieve delivering a lecture the agnosticism, but nobody) heeds him Here are Little Nell ( dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell is dead but, then, was she ever alive'), and Paul Dombey) ( that sweet Phi!, whose sufferings melted even the stony bent of Peffer)), and the tears idle tears til it have been called forth by this precious pair would alone have Mifhrcd to tide the Riverina over a respectable drought and yet the housekeeper will not admit them true pathos" he observes attacks the heart, not the beloved glands we view the sorrows of Lear, the cat istrophe of Othello, with dry eyes von ueiiottoinci suicpathosbvwliat it costs von in pocket handkerchiefs' Yonder is Ouida's guards man you know him by the droop of his superb mustachios in his life he was never heard to admit- anything except the lion quet of I disk of relic of Cithonells best quality, 01 i course of M is a gun from the cellars of Tnitonno" And here are the intolerably impressive Christians who are branded with the branch of Caine These are the failures of the novelists, now let us pass within the gates, where a ! their successes dwell Here we find the old friends whom we have known and loved since last we began to read with under standing, old friends whose intimacy is one of our most precious spiritual possessions, for these are of the aristocracy of the imagination, kings and queens in their own right of the world that man has created Anti stn ely the most beautiful mansion in this city of many mansions must be tenanted by) that illustrious family), the children of the greatest creative brain, save one, that England has known even the brim of Scott From Dugald Dalgetty to Baillie James, from Andrew disservice to Oliver Proudfute, from Dr. Vernon to Elspeth Mucklebacket, what a glorious company it is' and how intimately we know them all, how human and delightful and interesting the) are, how much more led they seem to us than most of the actual personages among whom we live and move, the sun!

E. P. Roe, and yet not forfeit your friend ship, or even vom respect but if he avow that he has not lend his Scott, 01 having land lins withheld his allegiance you know him at once for an ass, and there's an end out "The) won't beat Sn Writer in a burr)'" was Fitzgerald's exclamation, as he laid down the "Pirate', and of what other novelist of this century) could he have said it with the same emphasis, on a tithe of the same assurance' Mingling with these august personages almost, but not quite on equal terms -are to be seen such men is Lord Steyne and Colonel 1 smond, such women as Becky and Beatrix Lauri Penelenms may not be here, nor Lille! New come nor Amen, I am afraid but you cannot fail to encounter the un stn possible (origin and the stopes tions De La Pinche And lest I should seem to be of those who cannot love then Jhuclerav without de- saying his great nial let me hasten to offer that the place would not be itself without some of the diverting figures of that vast comic 1 one which Dickens built up out of the exuberance of his humour without Micawber and Peck sniff, Miss '-queens and Sam Weller, Mr Richard Swiveller, and the derable Mis Ci imp the high water mark of delightful farce) No one, that I know of, has ever 1 united for Dickensian very con- siderable insight into character not his most fervent admirers, would pretend that these grotesque ci cations of his come into serious mair) with Ihacke rays men and women It is enough that they have added to the gaiety of nations, and to li be done so much is sufficient assurance of immortality) Why is it, then, that no one has ever dreamed of equalling I hacker i) with Scott ' As a maker of English prose the latter writer is out of sight the greatest, hut then as a maker of English prose he is well nigh fruitless Ihael cray is master of one of the soundest styles in literature, a style of incomparable case and strength of exquisite grace and elim i t But it fiction, unhappily) or the reverse, style counts for little M li it really counts is the power of the writer to make the fortunes of his ere unions a matter of absorbing, concern to the reader to take the letter s imagination captive, and hurt v along with him on the swift irresistible stream of narration It is this power which, more than my Jllici, stamps Uti great novelist, and this power which neither Ilnckcrav not Dickens possesses to any great extent, is poss Jesse 1 in the supreme dayes b) Scott and Dumas Hiebe two as artists in narrative, rule there respective countries with a sway as absolute as the Great Moguls But a still more cogent reason for placing Ihnckera) below Scott is to be found in the of iv s own saying, that he was created with a sense of the ugh), the odd the meanly false, the desperate!) wicked lie Irish tin in bare under all disguises he hunted them to the death' fact!), that was his mission in the nature - co spy upon the naked ness of him and, on the follies Hld vanities mel inconsequence of his fellows was his humour to dilute, and the result is that of nil Ins really living hinders the is only one for whom we can feel the least respect, and that one I second is of a bygone age and moreover was described by Uncle t v himself is a mug Even in the hero He had himself created he must discern some hidden meanness What a contrast there is between the settled sour one of llncleta)'s Umpci and the full blooded heal tiness of Scott s And how ugly his purpose is nosing after moral ugliness seems when we compare it with Sir Wal ter's large and liberal leading of life' But we have wandered far from our City of Romance.
