^ OB, PHILOSOFHY FROM THE SHOP WINDOW, flBHE NEW YEAR. Obristmas has come and gone ; and now .Eighteen lyindrecj^and sixty*- four belongs to the|pasU It hjis taken away with it into ?de'ep'elflrDity the'^eoardsof the vast crimes and 'troubles, a rfd «bils ond sorrows of the breathing millions. ? The scroll 1-as received inscriptions and ? snperscrip tiSris, and is _plaoed jn' tha-. archives beyond erasure or 'Ob]it6^ation*^.jNot one of the thirty-one million and more of seconds in that year but has received its indelible impression. Each moment was a messenger, and cur ried its report from the life- battle to head quarters. What sorrows have they not solaced, wbat agonies have they not relieved? The ticking of the clock has announced the coming and the going of the- silent mes * sengers on their momentous errands, and the pale watcher has trembled ior the hsup of the struggle'- going on between life and death. Thousands of them came and de parted, an,d the sunshine peeped into the room and';8miled, as a child might where its mother, is dying; but al last one moment comes— otieVthat just pops in and whisp'efrs spared so low'thatiit is not heard, but 'bo ' loud that by: everyjdrop ^of blood it is fej$?* and the spirits are enlivened, and the invalid ia^-nore cheerful, and the sunbeams are per mitted to dance in at the window. And ? what did that little messenger take away in return for the blessing it brought f Was there a word of thankfulness, or a sound of praise, or a note of gladness? Ah! we often entertain 'these angels unawares ; but . inore often receive the most choice blessings and allow the messengers to depart again .Without even a smile of acknowledgment. ?'?= '-What a wonderful gift this New Year is. It is {0 the most of us, I trust, a precious one.* It is a volume entitled eighteen hun ?dred and sixty-four, and contains three hundred and sixty-five golden pages. Write -.;??;? in it we must— nbt|words merely, but ac i,jl tions. Actions that will exert their , H V 'influence on that and succeeding volumes; .^' . actions that will materially iiffect.,iha.man hood of that little fellow who is imbibing your principles and imitating your habits ; actions that will be* impressed on the me ?'? jtaofjf ; of that gentle girl there, and be re * i inembered, perhaps, when her deepest ? personal cares are forgotten ; actions that, \- :jij*e, ghosts, will gather round you when-ibe 1^.' vinists of death darkens your vision to the S:t;v things of sense, and von stand peering : r.;thf-jugh the clouds and shiver in the darhnj 1 ' -io^liUhess that comes up from the dn|f oiverb ; actions that there recorded wMpe }f.

I some^iiaes fancy there is a peculiar ^(jeonnectittn betWeen events, as though there 0M$ ;» ootspittijoy existing, and man was the fv-'w'ort ot these' fleeting mebsengers.

'?-}&' It is well, perhaps,, not .to think too deeply on these matters; to take the mes sages as they, come ; to.be thankful for the Joys and bow with resignation^ the trials. Jt.JB well to accept the good at their hands, and not to pry too anxiously as to the bitter . |D reserve. It is a great mercy that thai, .counoil is '-closed to us. No shorthand writer can take his seat there, and then send ? ? from one end of the world to the other the ?report of the proceedings of that congress. The curtains/of the future cannot be drawn aside by any mortal *hand, aud' it is in mercy that die ibuman eye cannot penetrate the tbiok mists of futurity. Who could ' bear the knowledge tbrat at a certain b^our ? of a fixed day, and at a given moment, he should di s, and never more enjoy a single Jkujrcnmstance of existence? The sting of 'capital punishment lies, riot in the more suf location of hanging, but in the reflection of the criminal that tx a particular moment he ' will be hanged. It was the knowledge that she would be executed on the morrow- that turned the hair of the royal French prisoner from a beautiful glossy black to a decided grey, and changed her from a noble dame to a bent old woman. When Bobespierre refused to rettjin his judgeship because he could not'oonspientiously condema a fellow creature to death, it was well he knew not that 'soon lie, would ca*use thousands to be gj'illo.tine^^nd'he himself 'die astnoist;hor fible deflt)t&'vIt waajwell the f^^gentle^ Charlotte Corday studying her granufath'er's dramas, and exercising her spare hours in acts 6f charity at Caen, in Normandy, did not know that to the distant city of Paris she would go* to take {he life of the wretch Marat, and the day following expiate her patriotism on the' scaffold. And who of us who have seen anything oflife would -prefer to know the future* Would you enjoy the prattliag of that (Jftrlin g child if you knew that ere the year is gone that voioe of music will be for.._ever stilled ? Could^op be happy if you knew that ere the daisies^ and buttercups adorn the fields, add the'1 birds sing heartily on the branches of the trees, and the flowers offer their perfumes in thankfulness to the genial sunshine, that the dear one who is the companion of your life, the sharer of all your troubles, will be laid in -the .long narrow bed, where the light never , penetrates, but where all is dark silence? Could I perform the duties of my position if I knew that at a, certain time I should be brought senseless, cold, and still, into the presence of those for whom T exert myself so;much ? It is well to reflect upon the past and-gather lessons from our history and that of, others ; but let us leave the future —so far as these weighty matters are* conr cerned — to Him who knows bo, past or future, but to whom all is an 'everlasting now. I am no' fatalist. We are not tbV creatures of circumstances to the exWut that certain schools and secularists .would have us believe. There are 'difficiilties to overoomp, and it is our dutyta^endeavourV to overcome them. There ar&ibfty; moun.-1 tains in our, path, maybe po veered with snow; and here and there deei^'ravines may' be detected; but the ^tr^tWr -.must press on, for to sleep on the ^wy mojjnt|iiin is death. To persevere.is^^yerbpme^and he who cannot overco^ile difficalties must succumb, and jneyejc^Sliy solve the mystery of^ life: Of th^te^ethan, it may be said — ''- ' ? i---^?liet-Sircmn8tanci? oppose liiin,, -,':'W- -Hp bendWtlo hiB wijl, - .

Well, the New .Year has come. « We have re ?commenced the struggle, and it is good tqk/ beginv'je^'. We have jpot to grapple ; with thVyjsar^atj'oripe, 'but to' conquer the event of each moment as it arrives. Time comes in precious dr6ps from the ocean of fcternity— but it comes only in drops. As opportunities are offered, then, let us em brace them ; as privileges are conferred, let us enjoy .them ; as duties are imposed, let us perform them ; and if there isauything to regret in the past, let us carefully avoid a repetition in the future. Let us determine to do our duty faithfully to ourselves* and our fellow-beings ; to ' love mercy and act uprightly/' and with the blessing of God, .dear reader, I trust you and I will spend, a really happy New Year.
