The Transvaal Trouble. THE BOERS AND THEIR HISTORY. THE STORY OF MAJUBA HILL. Majuba Hill is a very substantial f'ghost,'.' which obstinately refuses to be laid. The Boer has no wish to forget lt, and neither has the British sol aler and that great majority of the British people who believe in the prestige of the British arms, and that the stain: of a defeat should be wiped out by a victory. Majuba Hill accentuated the ob stinacy of the Boer, arid made him think that he is a match for the whole British army. The easy defeat of Jameson's mismanaged, ill-supported, Unfortunate raid has added some more stiffening to his attitude, and the result is that the Boers feel that they can give a very good account of themselves if the worst comes to the worst. Ma juba Hill taught Great Britain a lesson, which was not to undervalue ber eneiny. The dirty, fanatical, intolerant, pig-headed Boer proved that he was a "first-class fighting man," a good, shot, and with sense enough not to come out into the open too much. The preparations that have al ready been made at the Cape show the thorough ness with which Great Britain intends to carry out operations if Oom Paul will not give in.
