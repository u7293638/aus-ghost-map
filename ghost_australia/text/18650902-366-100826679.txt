COOMA. (From our correspondent.) LAYING THE FOUNDATION-STONE OF ST. PAUL'S Church.-On Tuesday, the 29th August, a large number of persons of all persuasions assembled in Cooma for the purpose of being present at the laying of the foundation-stone of the church of St. Paul the Apostle. The Rev. A. D. Soures, of Queanbeyan, attended to assist. The proceedings were commenced with the 132nd Psalm. After this followed the lesson, the collects, and an appropriate hymn. The stone was then duly placed and fixed by Mrs. R. H. Blomfieold of Coolringdon, who said:-" I lay this as the foundation and corner stone of a church to be built in this place; to be named the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, and to be set apart for the preaching of the right Catholic faithl, which we believe and confess in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." Appropriate prayers then followed, and were suc ceeded by the doxology and the benediction. The assemblage was subsequently addressed by the Rev. Thomas Druitt, the Rev. A. D. Soares, and RI. HI. Blomfield, Esq., of Coolringdon. It was generally remarked that though the day was rather cold and dusty, and somewhat inclined to favor the spectators with a shower, yet it was by far the largest attendance known in Cooma for some time. The masonic body walked in procession to attend at the perform ance of the ceremony. There was a largo number of the fair sex, and there existed amongst those present representatives of every creed and every position in the district.
