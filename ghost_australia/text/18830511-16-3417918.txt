When she asks this she looks so full of almost cherubic innocence, you really do not know how to answer him It is 1 frightful thing, you think, to st 1111 the snow white purity of 1 gills innocence by opening her eyes to evil hither to unknown 11 and until nut of And if she be really so innocent, so unconscious of evil, so purely and childishly cherubic is it not best after all to leave her what you have found her 1 and in any case his conduct is her mother's arran, not yours So you as indo your post with a discomfited au, and leave S meta Siniphcitas still unenlightened and the launching Nothing is so precious to S meta Sim phantasy as the to the truth She has no idea that anyone can be offended by it There fore, if your nose be led, silo tells you of it, if your chess be ill made, shoe pinches up the ugly fold between her fingers and shows the custom to all around, if the color of your dress be unbecoming, sho proclaims the fact in he shall tones till the whole assembly turns round to look at you and condemn with her No blot that can be hit is left untouched, and when you are not up to the mink 111 any respect whatever, no one within earshot is allowed to leaving ignorant of your comparative failure If you insert this publication of your shortcomings and min unties, you only flowers for yourself, for Sancta Smtplicitas is then doubly outspoken in his zeal to vindicate herself for a util s sake and you have to undergo two acts of months ' tion instead of one. Neither is the most painful chapter in your life's history more s for ed to her than waste your fatigued looks, the crimson tip of your unhappy nose, the unbecoming arrangement of your wardrobe Has your eldest son turned out ill, and gone out to Australia under a cloud so dense that you know neither time nor the future du dispel it' Sancta Simplicity never sees you without making the most tender and minute inquiries about him, asking where is, he? and what is he doing? and when did you last hear from him ' as if he had been her brother or her level at the least His your favourite daughter made a regrettable marriage and takes as her husband the man above all most and]) thence to you The man against whom you wanted her almost to the extent of forbidding? Again Sancta Sunplicitas, thinking no evil, and of course imagining that parents must always love their children and forgive e from the misdeeds, in makes the most careful inquiries respecting her condition and her happiness-and i of uses to recognise your discomfort Have you been engaged to a faithless lover, and has the engagement been broken off by the familiar process of melting? Sancta Simplicity, knowing nothing of the story, which a curious, how even, li is whispered pretty loudly to all concerned, invariably turns the com ers Union on that one special poison, the sound of whose name is like red-hot now in your soul But what should such a way get child of nature is she know of red- hot now in a man's soul? of faithlessness in a woman's beloved? of vulgar alting and well-known despair ? You cannot tell her of your pain, any more than you could tell her of the impropriety on the surface of which she was floating and you have to bear, with what courage and const me you may possess, a top line which you know in your own heart to be voluntarily and needlessly inflicted But no one ever attempts to unmask 01 to direct Sancta Siniphcitas The reputation of innocence granted her as a child she has carefully kept up 'as a woman, till she has established a claim for a kind of irresponsible freedom of manner, speech, and deed, which is only possible to the doves of humanity The world is both patient and credulous, for all the undercurrent of intrigue that goes on The many engine was set Sancta Simplicilas to be all that she appears to be, and only the few pel cone that she is not But the few are discs tot, and hold then convictions was s for ed from the many-as they would hold then weak places from Smcti Sun placings herself, and her youth persist in a perpetual flinging about of wildlife with a careless hand, and an incessant stamping on other folks' toes with a smiling face which seems to make design impossible In dress Sancta Simplicity is is audacious as she is in spirit She exaggerates all fashions, and clothes herself in guments which make the world at one, and which are always a cal feature of the mode of evading at the moment When crinolines were in fashion, the Sancta Sunplicit is of the day were the widest that could be made , when light skiffs came in, she had hi.s bed back so that she could not walk with steps longer than a few inches, and not the ghost of a fold concealed her figure in the range of small is its she sticks a more settled on the top of her head that of hugo ones she is not content with anything short of a fish kettle, with enough feathers round the bush to deck the top of a hearse. It she goes in for flounces and frivolities, she is a mass of sin ends, like aristocratic bags sewn together when she affects a severer style she makes herself look as much like a coachman of a jockey is she knows how. She wears double breasted cods, butchers, wide awakes, and bluchers and when men laugh as she passes, among women turn up their noses, she opens her eyes and asks " Why ? ' She is S meta Smipliett is for her own put and linden stands nothing of the world's more j resid methods Indeed, the one thing that she cannot and will not understand is that a ugh I should be formed den. "To the pure all things are pure," is the motto by which she lives and if she means no time in, she s i s with wide open eyes, why should others think she does was on" ? So she p kisses on her way soft footed, pun mg, and giving no warning as she leaps over the glass , but she knows when to make her silent spring, and where to touch the vital put and whom to fall into seemly by her innocence of evil and her cherubic simplicity.
