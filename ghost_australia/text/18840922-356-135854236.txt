Victoria Theatre. As the Victoria Theatre on Saturday night the Marian Willis Dramatic Company, com. bined with Alf. Lawton's Specialty Union, gave an enjoyable evening's entertainment. The former company played the comedy "'The Ninth Wonder of the World," the \- lattering offering an enjoyable bill of fare, consisting of ballads, songs, farce, and dtances, and the usual concomitants of minstrel entertainments. The programme appeared to be well received, and much 2nerriment was evoked. To-night the latest sensational drama, " Sentenced to Death," is to be produced. Mr. Kenny Douglas, the scenic artist, has been hard at work with his brush all the week, preparing en tirely new scenes. The plot of this thrilling drama is, perhaps, too well Iknown to demand much anticipatory cxplanation. Though seemingly rather in: tricate, it is worked out well and rationally, its incidents evolving many very effective situations. A young Essex farmer's wife has fallen under the evil influence of their landlord, whose design is (on the rejeotioci of his amorous suit) to expel the young farmer from his holding, and thus beggar him; emodus operanli being to criminate him as a thief by clandestinely placing some bank notes in his pocket. This is frustrated by the timely arrival of an "honest" old convict from Portland. Years elapse, times change, and with them ecenes. The d~enouaements are exciting, thrilling, and to the life-and eventually a long..staeding family "skeleton" is unearthed, and its ghost laid by a mutual and general recon ciliation over the dead body of one of the greatest scoundrels ever presented on the stage. The piece will be capitally mounted, and a genuine night's enjoyment may be expected. ... 1 ! ,
