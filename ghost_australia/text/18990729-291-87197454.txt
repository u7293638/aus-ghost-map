Wfl is frequently termed. Whatever the early; irKip offences of young ladies may be, they have i^'Q^fg rarely been charged with that of playing ^%g| truant. As an instance of obedience to' ? ;;v^2 paternal wishes may be quoted the follow- S3 in,8:— Miss Alice Marner is the daughter 'SfSS of Mr. George Marner, of 'Lamington,' ; ^ Victoria-road, Auburn. Miss Marner had ?.'?-;:??& been very ill, and upon returning froia ^ ;3 school she experienced a continued languid ? jS5 feeling that made her most miserable. In ' '?--- the course of conversation with a reporter7 '' £i she said:— 'Father took me to sc? a1 :.'& doctor, and he said I was overgrowing ny ' '7: strength, and I was not to exert myself.' - ab i uaa no inclination to do so thera ? was no^fear of my disobeying this order, and 1 took the 'quinine tonic' given ma with regularity. Then I commenced to''' '- feel acute, pains in my shoulders und back, and at night I could scarcely get any - rest. ' ' ' - 'We tried everything to induce sleep,' - interposed Mr. Maruer, 'but it had no effect; then I consulted a well-knov/j Collins-Btreet practitioner. He said my daughter was Buffering principally from weakness, and advised a change. He ? mother took her away for a trip to ?Queensland, but she returned looking ; -?' worse. She would also, retch on rising in — the morning; and food taken could not be kept down. She lost flesh and became a ' mere ghost.' '. ? 'This time last year,' said Miss Alice, I weighed 7 st. 3 lb., now I am 9 ot. 7 lb.' : 'A great improvement: your treatment must have been beneficial?' -rNo; all the medicine -I got did me very little good. Actually Dr. Williams' pink ' . pills for pale people deserve that credit. Just before the Jubilee holidays last year '- father bought me a box of Dr. Williams11 w pink pills at Mr. Pleasauce's, Chapel- ?':' street, Prahran. I had heard so much of ;; the beneficial changes which they had pro- ?:'-\ dueed in others that I obeyed father's . ? wishes that I should be careful to follow the directions. I am glad to say that they V did me so much good that I continued v'/ with them. It is a long time since I dis- .; continued taking them, and I ain now as ': -'-: healthy as anyone could wish.' ' 'And you would recommend them?' ? -: les; ana tnat strongly, too,' said Mr. Marner. 'Had I known of Dr. Williams' pinks pills two years before it would have saved me a hundred pounds.' A perusal of the foregoing must have shown you that Dr. William' pink pills for pale people ac coniplisb cures after other remedies have - failed. They did in Miss Marner's case. For rheumatism,- influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, sciatica, luriibago, general weaknesses, &c;, given a fair trial, they never disappoint. Avoid substitutes and get the genuine pills with all seven words —Dr. Williams' pink pills for pale people ;. — printed in red ink on white outside wrapper. Of chemists and storekeepers, and the Dr. Williams' Medicine Co., Ade laide. South Australia: six boxes, 15/3j one box, 2/9, post paid. These are the pills -which cured Miss Marner.
