INTERCOLONIAL BIGHT OAR RACE. A GREAT STRUGGLE. *By Telegraph.) SYDNEY, Sunday. The Intercolonial Eight Oar race was rowed in ideal weather on an ebb tide on Saturday in the presence of many thousands. At the start the oars of the three erews struck the water well together; Sloane set the Victorians a stroke of 42, Queensland went 41, and the Welshmen 47. The Victorians put such power into their first dozen strokes that it carried them well in front of their rivals, and before 200 yards had been traversed they had a lead of half a length. New South Wales stuck to them, but Queens land dragged beh'nd, and they lacked the power necessary in the work, but the pace was a clinker, and they could not hold -on to the leaders or New South Wales. At Walker's Hospital the Syd ney men crept up to Victoria by quick ening their stroke, but the dark blues responded, and swung along preserv ing beautiful time, Blaxlands Point was passed in 4mins. 56sec., and here Queensland was two lengths behind, and tailing away fast. It took 7min 45sec to reach Putney, Queensland be ing there 6 lengths in the rear, without the ghost of a chance. The ding dong fight between Victoria and New South Wales was kept up ; stamina shown by the Welshmen was surprising. The Victorians, however, were rowing with delightful precision and reached Glades ville two lengths ahead of New South Wales ; Queensland at this point was so far in the rear that the umpires boat was compelled to go ahead of them and they pulled into Abbotsford, where they gave up, apparently disgusted. Victoria still kept the lead; at one Man's wharf, which was reached in 15min 24sec, the Sydney men made a gallant spurt, and shortened the Vic torians' lead to half a length, but when the winning post was reached the Victorians were just a length to the good. The race was finished in 17min Usee after a splendid contest
