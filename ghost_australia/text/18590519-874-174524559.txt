SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. BY THE GHOST OF BURNS. Accordin' to my constant plan, Syne steam frae here to Lunnun ran, I scribble a' the news I hear About things i' this hemisphere. Twa papers for same unkin' reason Write due-a-hait but lies and treason, Town-talkers grieve the auld folks are thus Deluded by that liein' Argus. While a' the Age's gang o' writers, Are nocht but puir dowff blether-skiters, In which conclusion PUNCH forsooth Jist thinks there's muckle lies 'an truth. POLITICAL. In politicks there's naithin' doin', Except a change I hear there's brewin'. The City Council sair disgusted, Wi' how their Bailie's claim's adjusted. Frae Barkly mean to tak the billet And than let ane McCombie fill it. If sae I fear big blith'rin' Jonny, Will buy it for some Irish crony. Jock still keeps in wi' a' his care Mak'in' bad laws and bad ones waur. SOCIAL. In social life there's leetle movin', I canna' state that we're improvin'. Men still find faut their sarks want buttons, An' grumble o'er cauld beefs an' muttons, Work-lassies gang it fast and faster An whiles gang clean aff wi' the master. MORAL. Syne you received my last mou's letter, Morals are fient a bit the better, The kirks are fu' o' hushioned benches The streets a' thrang wi' limmer wenches. An' married people by the score, An' canny damsels by the dizzen Whiles saunter out to see their kizzen— Play pranks they daurna play before. I maistly had forgat to say These girls who lead puir lads astray, Are a' to be—sae its reported Out o' the City ilk transported. Some mod'rn Joie or anither Wad sind the lads and thim togither. But after spierin an' reflectin' PUNCH maun be to sic course objectin', When ilka kimmer you thus send out, You turn ilk lassies friends or friend out, When o' a' them the toun's bereft, Why who the deil wad there be left? ECCLESIASTICAL. An unco fuss there ha'e been made, Aboon folk o' the lang-cloth trade, Na doubt sin's gat the upper han' O' a' the people i' the lan.' It's quite as true that brither-sinners, Are far less mind't than drouth an' dinners, That this will last I muckle fear While priests get rich an' worship gear. An' sich their pride—why priests an' people Will gi'e to ha'e a braw new steeple, As muckle gold as wad ha'e built A kirk near han' some scene of guilt. But PUNCH contents himsel by thinkin' Tho' ilka teacher may be drinkin'— Countin' his gear, or learnin' prayers, He for the people's welfare cares. He'll gall his queel and write his sternest And gar Miss Jennies be in earnest. MISCELLANEOUS. J— T-m-ie as amaist resign'd D--k Ire----d a' o' unsound mind, (He's gaun to print a law, and that is Ilk Irishman can straik ye gratis.) Thick-witted folk keep marryin' still And ev'ra Jock discovers Jill; The papers of each day contain, Wha's ta'en a matrimonial wean. THEATRICAL. Actors get mair attentive hearers Than all the orthodoxy spierers That de'il-ma-care braw-actin chiel Geordie's alive an' unco weel. P.S.: I had forgat a serious item, Lang Mooney's hame—the Queen should knight him.
