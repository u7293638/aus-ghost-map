SCRAPS. RITUALISM. The following graphic description appears. in an article under tins head in the Edinbnbrgh Review, just published:-" Sir Walteir Scott used to tell, with much zest, a story of a man who used to frighten his friend by encounter ing him at midnight on a lonely spot which was supposed to be the resort of a ghostly? visitant. He took his seat on the haunted stoiie wrapped.in a long white sheet.' Pre sently; to his horror; the real ghost appeared and sat down beside him, with the ominous ejaculation, 'You are a ghost, and. I am a ghost, let us come closer and closer together;' and closer and closer theghost pressed, tillk the sham ghost, overcome with terror, fainted. away. This, we fear, is the fate which awaits the Ritualist imitators of the Church of Rome.. That mighty ghost,-' the ghost of the -de ceased Roman Emnpire,'-the ghost of the dead Middle Ages,-will press closer and closer ;to our poor dressed-up ghost, till the greater. absorbs the lesser, or deprives it, by mere juxtaposition, of any true spiritual life."
