COLONIAL GLEANINGS. VAN DIEMEN'S LAND. The Hobart Town Advertiser, of Jan, 4, says "We do not remember ever having had to record so many sudden deaths, casualties, and offences in so short a time." And this is the "merry sesson" of Christmas. The Editor thus apostrophizes the virtuous hilarities of Old England in a bygone time :— Oh, ghost of Marley ! oh, shade of departed Scrooge! oh, god of Christmas past and Christmas present! where was thy correcting influence where thy human- ising spirit that would tract all mankind to join with Tiny Tim in the little heartfelt prayer "God bless us every one ?" The offences included two street robberies, at- tended with circumstances of great personal vio- lence, and an unprovoked attack by several sol- diers. Launceston, too, presented, it is said, during the "eve" and week of Christmas, scenes of rioting, drunkenness, and obscenity, unparalleled. While we are upon the sad subject of colonial excesses, we may mention that in Melbourne, during the Christmas week, about three thousand five hundred gallons of brandy and rum were taken out of bond, besides Geneva, Old Tom, imported malt liquors, wines, and cordials, in proportionate excess. The honest gentleman in charge of the barque Lochangar, when settling his accounts at his agents, refufed to pay the charge against him from the office of this newspaper, for advertising his vessel, stating as a reason for repudiating the debt, that the editor has written against him and his tea- totol professions ! and, further, that he did not order the advertisement; true, he did not ; but a responsible party did. We congratulate the honest fellow on his admirable scheme to liquidate a debt ; he is quite welcome to the few pounds, and we recommend him to give pub- iibity to his novel mode of repudiation if he lives ever to shew himself on Change in London. — Cornwall Chronicle.
