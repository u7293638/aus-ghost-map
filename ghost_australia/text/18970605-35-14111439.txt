THE, MAY REVIEWS. In the Contempt at ; this month the interest of the Eastern question in its several phases casily overshadows everything else The opening- paper is an unsigned contribution dealing with "'the Concert of Europe" 'The writer, who in evidently well informed, doubts if even persons so omniscient as the politician or Journalist could describe what it is with any approach to truth or even to common sense One paper is quoted as having described the Concert as " three despots, two tassels, and one toward " The patent fact of the hour, According to this writer, is that six powerful States are pleased to interest themselves in the question of the dissolution of 'Turkey, on the plea that there is danger of a European w as if they do not the integrity of Turkey is declared to be the common object aimed at pretending, by what is called here " a transparent and even an audacious faction," that this patent is guaranteed by effective treaties and is part of the common law of Europe The writer does not mince matters If this were true, he contends, it would be a calamity for the world and a high crime of the Powers themselves But the notion is kept up, it is maintained, to the bewilderment of plain people who have the deeds that are done, but who I--___-_____" believe there must be some tremendous reason to explain why all these wise men agree to do them. If the Concert is anything, we are assured, it is a tacit understanding among the six Towers that they will take common action or ah I am from isolated action in the Eastern quote u but it is regarded as doubtful it even the word understand lug would apply in the case The action of the King of Greece has been condemned is a breach of international law but this want- quotes instances from 1871 to 1892 to prove iii it other Powers have done much the same Tol lowing Mr Ciu/ou, ho deed es that the man of the Powers is to secure that no mere interest of a Christian poo The on, and no doctrinaire idea that a just section entitles such a population to si steady and support was to be allowed to diminish the area of di visible "oods against the time w beat the hen tage might be hoped oned Ml this is Mgorouslj put nudlhcr-MK a not less Victor us it fell on Bismank'spc'icv He is spoken of is probably the only mill "rent Foreign Minister of this generation The aimed at securing 2 for the pom S -Vc he served the first place in Europe, and while he is worked out his plan there was no kill oF any Concert of Europe to their this ring slices iuPiuD ' or to preserve the, bill and of power is Hanotaux in France is s jo! en of as the nearest thing to a sUtesnnn our neighbours at present possess The ] European State system, says the writ r, n, reduced to two altern states It is either the Triple Alliance, Iel by Germany against Buyer with It and of in town-, or it is a coin irish Luna against the Universe, in which case France and Italy are at the mercy of theLinperoi6 The Concert, it is added, is neither more nor less than the achievement of the Lnipciort, made effective by the well-known weakness of the a big man who represents Great Britain and the policy of England is lcioniiuciided as that of the Free Hand rid of entanglements with " fus mut less alliance " Another unsigned paper dis- cusses the positions of the Sultan and the lowers The significant feature here, it is held is the assurance of the Sultan that his policy has been a triumphant success.

He is doubtful if the influence of the newspaper press in public affairs has increased, and thinks there is something in the remark that up to Ptlniciston's time the machinery of government was more limited more compact, more capable of being influenced by any single powerful agency from without, than in these days of discussed and confused authority The business of the political crisis, like that of Government, was more simple and direct then than now, though to day we find ourselves in presence of a greater but more manifold force in the Press Writing of Dr Jowett and Oxford liberalism, a contributor thinks that the more the Minister's attitude towards religion is examined, the most inviting it will seem Among other papers is one dealing with early Victorian fiction The series Paris has papers by David Hannay, Basil Thomson, H.
