POETEY. A PEAYEE FOE PEACE. 'By Elizabeth Stuart Phelps-Ward.] God of all nations ! Hold them back, Who becken death upon our track ! Who welcome woe upon our land. God of all mercies ! Bid them stand ! Control the fevered heart and brain, That rends itself to fend again ; Arrest the word that starts to-day To loose the arm that leaps to slay ! Lo, Thou art greater than our fate, Daring we cry; Not yet too late ! A wail is on the Easter chime— Save us, O God ! There yet is time. By memories carven and graven With the pangs of thirty years ; By the mind and the meaning of battle Horror and anguish and tears. By the souls that went out in their morning, With the rose of the East on their brow ; By the splendor in eyes that were darkened, Wistfully watching us now. By the cry on lip3 that were silenced In slaughter and torture and death; By the homeless, desolate passing Of the slow and shattered breath ; By the man who writhed in the trenches, By the boy who groaned on the field. By the hero who dashed to his dyina With only the smoke for. a shield: By the locket that lay on the silent, Cold heart; by the curl of soft hair He had hidden to kiss it and treasure Till they found it at last, with him, there ; By the mother who bore him and gave him, Ah, God ! By the desolate wife ; By the girl in whose heart he is holy From the dawn to the dark of her life ; By the homes that are builded on ashes, By the ghosts at the hearth that we have ; By the life that went down with the soldier Into the weed-grown grave; By the waste, and the woe, and the murder. By the crime of the shot and the shell, That tears at the flesh and the spirit, By the soul of war, which is hell— Save, save us, good Lord ! . . . Misguided ! Blinded by blood and by mist, Oh, save us the Easter lilies Hold in the hands of Christ! —Selected.
