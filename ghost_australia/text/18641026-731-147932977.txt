TO CORRESPONDENTS. WE have received the "Ghost of Taabinga's" report of the "Edward's" meeting, but must defer publication till our next. Our columns will be open for letters on matters of public utility onlyâ€”on such questions we wish to promote a free and full discussion. Letters must be accompanied with the name and address of the writer, not necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith. The Chronicle. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1864.
