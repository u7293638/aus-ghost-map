THE CALEDONIAN GAMES. The fifth annual gathering of the Ballarat Caledo- nian Society come off on New Year's Day at the Copenhagen Grounds, when from 4000 to 5000 per- sons assembled to honor the occasion. Barring the annual recurrence of this fete, it may almost claim to be regarded as a sort of Olympian games, for while the gathering is due to the nationality and energy of Scotsmen, the games are truly cosmopoli- tan, and attract people of all the nationalities repre- sented in Victoria. From the dull and severely Scottish feat of tossing the caber to the very ridicu- lous and thoroughly English game of sack- racing, or the presumably Irish sport of pick- ng up potatoes, the programme for the gather- ing affords a wide choice of events in which all sorts ot people, let their origin be what it may, can find something or other to suit their several capabilities or idiosyncrasies. This, no doubt, added to the fact of the day being a general holiday, and one without much, if any, other attraction of the sportive kind elsewhere, makes the Caledonian gathering an invariable success. The society, too, is generally very lucky in keeping the clerk of the weather in good temper. After the ferocious brick- fielder of the 31st December, a little harshness of demeanor on the 1st January was perhaps pardon- able enough in the important official in question, and he seemed disposed to be a little rude yester- day; but as the morning wore away the usual good fortune of the Caledonians was in the ascen- dant and fine weather drew to the sports a great crowd of holiday folk. A trifle too much wind and dust rendered the day not quite what was desirable, but, on the whole, the day was a pleasant one, and the sports were, as heretofore, a decided success. The westerly breeze which blew all day told most adversely upon the competitors in the rifle match, but, as the scores will show, the marks- men made very respectable points nevertheless. The committee and officers of the society deserve credit for the pains taken by them in the alterations and decorations of the grand stand, and in the im- provement of the arrangements for the competitors. The grand stand was cleared of the ugly staircases in front and sides, and access to the stand was had from the rear by which an unbroken facade was obtained Along this front line were placed heraldic, or quasi heraldic shields of various devices, and up the divid- ing pillars were festoons of vine leaves, branches of wattle and grass trees. Floating between and above and at each angle were flags of several kinds, colors, and sizes, the middle of the picture displaying the red lion of Scotland, the thistle, and its warning \- nemo me impune lacessit. Other lions rampant, the union jack, and other bunting occupied other salient portions of the stand. In the centre of the arena a tall flagstaff was fixed, from which floated two strings of flags streaming noisily in the per- sistent breeze, and giving life as well as noise to the scene. Looking from the south un- der this angular display of flags, the grand stand, filled with gaily dressed ladies and less gaily attired gentlemen, and the crowded circumference of the arena, presented an exceedingly animated tableau, heightened in its effect by the incessant flitting to and fro of kilted men and boys, and spor- ive competitors curiously costumed in colors of almost every hue under the clouds. The band of the B.V.Y.R. and bagpipe players, with lungs of invincible power and resource of wind, kept the whole day long alive with music, so that what with crowds, colors, music and shouting, the scene, from the bagpipe overture of "Auld lang syne," to the brass band finale of "God save the Queen," was one of ceaseless life and thorough holiday jollity. The first note of the day's proceedings was the starting of the procession from Roy's Hotel, in Bridge street, headed by pipers, whose performances alternated with the music of the brass band. The procession was, like the Highland costume, somewhat scanty, but as it proceeded on its way it gathered strength, and by the time the grounds were reached a goodly crowd of processionists and outsiders had got together. After the arrival of the procession there was no time wasted in beginning the sports, albeit the weather was lowering just then, and the grounds and grand stand looked rather bare of visitors. As the sun mounted the heavens, however, the day got brighter, and the crowd poured in till the numbers had swollen to the aggregate we have already mentioned. The following were the events of the day, but we should remark that in one or two instances the programme of judges was departed from, owing to the absence of several gentlemen who had been chosen for those functions:- Band- "Auld Lang Syne." Reel by the Highlanders. Putting the Heavy Stone-1st prize, £5; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs C. Roy, Hugh Gray, George G. Mackay. Entries- J. Haig. W. Haig, J. Brown, D. W. Reddy. 1st prize, J. Haig, 29 ft 6 in; 2nd do, W. Haig, 28ft 10in. Standing High Leap- 1st prize, £3; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs W. C. Smith, M. Elliott, and R. Lewis. Entries- E. James, McKelvie, Bellett. 1st prize, McKelvie, 4 ft 4 in; 2nd do, Bellett, 4ft 3 in. Highland Fling- 1st prize, £3; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs W. Robertson, Donald Gunn, J. D. Rankin. Entries- Coutts, M. D. Frazer, Erskine. The judges seemed at first to hold that Coutts had earned the first prize, and Erskine the second, but it was resolved to repeat the dance, when the adju- dication was reversed. Putting the Light Stone-1 st prize, £4; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs P. Hedrick, G. G. Morton, M. Campbell. Entries- J. Haig. D. M. Reddy, E. McDonald Burns, W. Haig, J. McDonald, First prize, J. Haig, 33½ft; second, Reddy, 32ft 2in. Hop Step and Leap- 1st prize, £2; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs R. M. Dickson, G. G. Morton, A. Sinclair, Entries- W. Quain, W. McKelvie, M. Gullen, S. Mayo; first prize, McKelvie, 43ft 9in; second do, Mayo, 39ft 5in; Quain being one inch below Mayo. Highland reel. Throwing Heavy Hammer- 1st prize, £5; 2nd do, £2; Judges- Messrs H. B. Chalmers, D. Rankin, G. G Mackay. Entries- J. Haig, C. Lamont, J. Lake. 1st prize, Haig, 79 ft 6 in; 2nd do, Lamont, 75 ft 11 in. Jingling Race- 1st prize, £2; 2nd do, £1. Judges -Messrs R. F. McLean, Campbell, and Fleming. Entries- C. D. Leach, H. Bennett, H. Halbert, F. H. Leech. This laughable event caused plenty of fun, the more as it is a novelty in these parts, the first event of this sort in Ballarat having came off on Boxing Day on the Ballarat cricket reserve. The sport is a land of blindman's buff plus a bellringer or "jingler" and bags of straw placed convenient for the competi- tors to tumble over. Whether or not it is according to "jingling" laws, for the jingler to add to the fun by holding a bag of straw before him now and then, we do not know, but that was the practice of yes- terday. The prizes are won by the first two men who succeed to catching hold of the man with the bell. Only F.H. Leech obtained this success in this event, the game being declared off before a second was successful. Best dressed Highlander.- Society's silver medal and chain, value £4. Judges, Mesrs McLennan, H. Gray, and McLachlan. Entries- A. McDonald, J. Edgar. F. Charleson, J. Brown, Finlayson, Watty. The prize was awarded to Charleson, who was dressed in the "Blackwatch" or "Auld forty-two" tartan. A prize of £2 was also awarded to Edgar, who wore the Tullievardine tartan, and one of £1 to Watty, who wore the Forbes tartan. Race 120 Yards- 1st prize, £3 ; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs W. Craig, E. C. Moore, H. Davies. Entries - C. Herring, J. Quinlivan, R. Lee, F. H. Leech, M. Gullen, J. Gellatly, J. Cunninghame, R. Morrison, W. Bellett, J. Lankaster. All the men entered did not run, but of those who did Bellett won in the first heat, and Morrison in the second. In the first heat Bellett came in first, Morrison being necessarily second. Dance- Gillie Callum-1st prize, £3; second do, £1. Judges- Messrs Robertson, McLachlan, and Roy. Entries- R. Erskine, W. Coutts, M.D. Frazer. The first prize was awarded to Frazer and the second to Erskine, but Coutts entered a protest against the adjudication. Best Dressed Highland Boy- Society's silver medal, with suitable inscription. Judges- Messrs D. Rowan, D. Gunn, R. F. McLean. Entries- F. Cherry, H. Miller, R. Durie. The prize was awarded to Durie. Vaulting with the Pole- 1st prize, £5; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs M. Elliott, Kelly, and Whit- combe. Entries- W. Bellett, D. Wade, M. Potts, W. McKelvie. 1st prize, W. McKelvie, 8 ft 9 in, 2nd do, Bellett, 8ft 7 in. Throwing Light Hammer- 1st prize, £4; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs Mackay, Williamson, and Chalmers. Entries- J. Haig, Burns, C. Lamont, 1st prize, Haig, 92 ft 10 in; 2nd do, Lamont. 87 ft. Tossing the Caber- First prize, £4; second do, £2; third do, £1. Judges- Messrs Gunn, H. Gray, and M. Elliot. Entries- A. Morrison, J. Haig, D. M. Reddy, J. McDonald, W. Haig. The caber was a gum pole, with a girth of 17½ inches tapering to 11½ inches, and over 15 feet in length. At the original length none of the competi- tors could effect a "toss," and as is almost invariably the case, the pole had to be cut shorter. After a long series of efforts Haig won the first prize, by tossing the caber of 15 feet in length; and Morrison by tossing it after half a foot had been cut off that length. Reel by the Highlanders.- Great Handicap Steeple Chase, 600 yards; over six flights of hurdles, 3 feet 6 inches high. Two water leaps, one 22 feet long and 5 feet deep, and the other 14 feet long and 4 feet deep, 1st prize, £6; 2nd do, £4; 3rd do, £3; 4th do, £2. Judges- Messrs Davies, Moore, and Kelly. Entries- W. Foster (10), R. E. Dalgleish (scratch), Billett (scratch). There were several other entries, but only the three named actually competed. This event is always a good one, as the long water leap, or perhaps we should rather say flounder, always causes a good deal of fun. Foster got the lead and kept it winning by come 30 yards or so. He cleared the first water by a clean leap, whereas Dalgleish stumbled. At the deep long water all dashed in so as to make the inner side as closely as possible, and thus the floundering business was got over a little more quickly than it usually is. The order was, Foster, 1; Billett, 2; Dalgleish, 3. Pipe Music, Pibroch- 1st prize, £4; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs McLennan, Rankin, and McLachlan. Entries- McDonald, S. Edgar, F. Charleson. 1st prize, McDonald, air "Farewell to Kintyre;" 2nd do, Charleson, "Battle of the Park." Edgar played "McDonald's Lament." Sack Race- 1st prize, £2; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Craig, Lewis, and Davies. Entries- R. Coulthard, T. Coulthard, F. H Leech. Leech came to earth before the race was half over, and the brothers came in a dead heat, dividing the prizes between them. Broadsword Exercise- 1st prize, £3; 2nd do, £2, Judges- Messrs St Quentin and Thompson. Entries- C. Gallop, L. Puech, G. Thurston, W. Leonard, Galpin, Erskine. The first bout was taken by Puech (11), and Leonard (nil); the second by Thurston (11), and Erskine (nil), and the third by Gallop (8) ; and Galpin (11). In two succeeding bouts scores of 11 were again made by Puech, whose play was very much admired, Thurston scoring 11 also, and Gal- pin 9 in their final tussle. No fewer than eight counters were made in the course of the event. 1st prize, Puech ; 2nd do, Thurston. Race by members of the Society in Highland cos- tume- Silver medal. Judges- Messrs Craig, Car- ver and Kelly. Entries- R. B. Paton, Mr D. Frazer, A. Kay, This event created considerable interest. Frazer, though a decided "welter" weight, took the lead and kept it, Paton and Kay keeping pretty well to- gether for some time. Kay then passed Paton and collared Frazer, and a pretty little tussle ensued, the "little un," however, was beaten by the "wel- ter," who won by a few yards. Dance- Sheantrews.- 1st prize, £2; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Robertson, Lorimer, and Smith. Entries- W. Coutts, R. Erskine, M. D. Frazer. First prize, Frazer; second do, Erskine. Running High Leap.- 1st prize, £3; second do, £1. Judges-Measrs Elliott, J. McCulloch, and W. C. Smith. Entries- W. Bellett, W. Spiers, J. Jones (a nom de guerre), W. Talbot. First prize, Jones, 5 feet 1 in. ; second do, Bellett, 5 feet. Talbot did not leap, and "Jones" was said to have leaped 5 feet 3½ in. after the event was over. Handicap Race 800 Yards- 1st prize, £5; 2nd do, £2; 3rd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Craig, Moore, and Davies. Entries- E. Davies, J. Gallatly, R. Morrison, E. Nelson, J, Cazaly, P. Quinlan, J. Green, H. Ben- nett, J. Lancaster. This was a good event, being hard fought by the prize winners. Morrison got the lead, but Davies collared him when within 100 yards or so of the goal, when a spurt took place and Mor- rison headed him again, and won by a few yards, Davies coming in a good second. Pipe Music- Marches and Strathspeys- 1st prize, £4; 2nd do, £2. Judges- Messrs McLennan, J. D. Rankin, and McLachlan. Entries- S. Edgar, G. Edgar, Charleson, Finlayson. 1st prize, Finlayson (march, "Bodach na Briogaisein," or, "Carl o' the Breeks;" strathspey, "Moniemusk"); 2nd do, Edgar (strathspey, "Brachin Castle"). Basket and Potato Race- 1st prize, £2 ; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Davies, Whitcombe, Duncan and Todd. Entries- W. Spiers, H. Bennett, W. Forest, H. F. Leech, J. Gellatly. This event caused a good deal of interest alike from its novelty, being the first of the kind in these parts, and from the intrinsic attractiveness of the sport. The achievement consists in picking up, one at a time, forty potatoes, placed in a straight line, and each one a yard apart. The task was what waa called in the vernacular of the arena, "a regu- lar buster," the first prize being won by Forest, and the second by Spiers. These two won by picking up their quota first, and Spiers was only some eight yards behind Forest, the others having from half-a- dozen to a dozen "murphies'' still to collect when the prizes were won. Dance- Reel of Tulloch- 1st prize, £2; 2nd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Robertson, H. Gray, and Lorimer. Entries- W. Haig, R. Erskine, W. Coutts, M. D. Frazer. First prize, Haig; second do, Coutts. Handicap Walking Race.- 3 miles, or thirteen times round the course. 1st prize, £3; 2nd do, £2; 3rd do, £1. Judges- Messrs Davies and McKay. Entries- F. Cooke, H. Bennett, R. Brown, H. Gel- latly, Foster, G. Moore, Finlayson, M. D. Frazer, J. Cazaly. This was a supplementary event, and was one of the best in the whole programme. Brown, a youth of about 20, new to the grounds, took the lead and kept it throughout, the position of the others being constantly changing, and now one and now another fell off and gave in, as the long contest ex- hausted their wind and hopes, until at the final round only Brown Cazaly, and Cooke were left in the field. Moore's gait electrified the whole arena for his giant strides and demonstrative sway of arms called up visions of the hero of the seven league boots, but the competitor in question failed to realise the exploits of the nursery ogre, for he gave in after some half-dozen rounds. Frazer belted away up to near the last round, and looked extremely likely to win a prize, but he had to succumb to pulmonary exigencies, and retire from the contest. At the last round but one Cazaly made a spurt and neared the winning man Brown, but was "done brown" in a trice, for the stripling shot on afresh and kept his distance. At the last round Brown came in easily the first man, following by Cazaly second, and Cooke third. The more enthusiastic of Brown's admirers immediately hoisted him on their shoulders and bore him off in triumph for a nobbler. Handicap Hurdle Race, 400 yards- Over six flight of hurdles 3 feet 6 inches high. 1st prize, £5 ; 2nd do, £3 ; 3rd do, £1. Judges- Messrs A. Smith, Moore and Kelly. Entries- C. Herring (3), J. K. Davies (scratch), M. Kavanagh (5), R. E. Dalgleish (5), Wade (5), F. H. Leech (5), R. Morrison (scratch) E. Nelson (8), M. Potts (8), P. Quinlinan (8), J. Cazaly (8) J. Jones, (5), W Foster (5), W. Spiers (8), J. Ed- wards (6.) This event was done in heats, in which the win- ners were Foster, Davies, and Spiers. In the final heat Foster was first, Davies second, and Spiers third. Tilting at the Ring- 1st prize, silver cup; 2nd do, silver medal. Judges- Messrs Kelly, M. Camp- bell, and J. D. Rankin. We cannot give a report of this event, as our re- porter left the ground before it came off, having first obtained a promise from one of the members of the committee that a report should be supplied. That was not done, and all we have learned is that Mr Bonwick won the first prize, and Mr Boyd the second. GRAND RIFLE MATCH. MATCH 1- 200 yards. 1st prize, £3; 2nd do, £2; 3rd do, £1 10s; 4th do, £1; 5th do, 15s; 6th do, 10s; 7th do, 5s.

The entries for this event will be gathered from the score appended hereto. The shooting came off from 6 a.m. and although the wind was strong all day, the marks made were good upon the whole:- Captain Campbell, 200 yards-0 2 2 3 3, 10; 400 yards-3 2 2 2 4, 13; 600 yards-0 2 00 2, 4,.

During the whole of the match the wind was blowing furiously right across the range. Sergeant Sleep, through the breaking of the lock of his rifle, was prevented from shooting with his usual accuracy. The manner in which the day's proceedings were ordered was as satisfactory as can be expected from a system of arrangement by no means perfect, and which might be improved by a little more attention to office details. If for instance, all the entries were closed by a fixed early hour in the day, or on the previous day, all the confusion which has hitherto occurred in the way of getting off the events, and obtaining information thereanent would be ob- viated. If such a rule were once made and enforced, it would be afterwards kept well enough, for the prizes offered by the society are too tempting to be ignored by competitors, even though they should be forced to enter earlier than has hitherto been the custom. Then the judges of each event should be furnished with a book, in which the secretary's entries should be copied, and in which the awards should be inserted by the judges. This is done at Buninyong, and surely it is compassable in Ballarat also. However, with these few drawbacks, the programme was got through with energy and success, and the great crowd was in good order and good humor throughout the day, no disturbance or casualty of any moment being reported. We should add that, from some cause or other, the National Anthem, or "God Save the Queen," was not played at the end of the sports. This caused some remarks adverse to the loyalty of the descendants of the friends of the Queen's ancestors among the Stuarts. A SCHOOLMASTER FLOGGED IN A SHIP OF WAR. A report, which has been current for some time past, of the flogging of a schoolmaster, on board of H. M. ship the Pioneer, led to a meeting on Friday, the 19th instant, at the School of Arts, of persons en- gaged in teaching, to consider the propriety of tak- ing some steps in reference to the proceeding. Be- yond listening to a statement from Mr Harris, that he had obtained an order for visiting the ship and had seen the schoolmaster, who informed him that he had been flogged, without being disrated, and passing a resolution to appoint a committee to con- sider what further steps should be taken in the matter, no other results arose out of the meeting. Among those present were the Rev. Dr. Woolley, the Rev. P P. Agnew, and Messrs Harris, W. Wil- kins, Paterson, and S. Hawthorn.-Empire, 27th December, HOW THEY MET AT SANDHURST.- We noticed yesterday that the workmen were busily employed "clearing the wreck" at the Temperance Hall. About thirty seats are totally demolished, several more damaged, two lamps smashed, the walls damaged, &c;, in all damage estimated at £50 was done by the meeting of Tuesday evening.-Bendigo Advertiser, 1st January. A GHOST STORY.- At the Police Court on Satur- day, Anthony McGee, a farm laborer, was charged by Constable Gridbin with vagrancy. It appeared that on Friday night the prisoner was found in the police inclosure, near the stables. On being asked to give an account of himself, he said that he wished to be taken into custody, as he was followed by a ghost, which would not give him rest. The prisoner spoke more like a lunatic than a person in the posses- sion of his senses. He stated he had been working at McBean's. He waa in the habit of taking strychnine in large and small quantities. When he took a large quantity it "made him stiff " It was the ghost of a woman that followed him; he had not murdered her; her body was dead, but her soul was living on the earth.
