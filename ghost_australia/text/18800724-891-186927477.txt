A "WALK WITH A VENTKILO ; • QUIST. ; The party comprised Elliston the actor, and Alexandre the ventriloquist. Their first step Was towards Charing Cross. Tbc spleodid houses now forming Pall Mall East hud just been erected. Reaching Cockspur-street, it was settled that the actor should give the frenchman the cue when he was to ventrilo quise, by kicking his shins. 4 You must animate one of these carcases/ said Elliston, surveying the unfinished building; 'here is an empty house that wants a tenant; you mu&t; supply one.' ' The workmen had long retired from the labour of the day, and though the windows were without sashes, and there was little to steal in the several houses, the doors of them were careful y locked to prevent homeless vagabonds obcupying them for the night. • • j The dusk favoured the performance. Plant ing, themselves close to the railings of the first of thete edifices— 'Throw your voice into the vaults below/ whispered the comedian. ' You must be a poor ft-llow.who, having got drunk aud fallen asleep, has tumbled into some hole or another. . Call for Assistance, and beg to be let out.* : The ventriloquist not without some trepida tion, did as he was desired, and Eiliston com* meuced bis part—not his first appearance, in 4 the Confederacy!' His exclamations of sur prise, commiseration, indignation, &c.;, soon at*, trnc'.ed the notion of thy pufsew.bv; * voice waf> plainly h' «rd begging to be extricated. /. ! * What ih it V cried one. \ * A drunken tnac/ said another. ; • Call tho watch,' said a third. • 4 Break open the door/ said a fourth. - . The watohman of the district advanced, calling the hour; seeing a mob, he lost no time in joining it. ' (Ocb, by St. Bridget's flannel petticoat,'said he, on bearing • the cries, *.but it's that divil's own darlint, Tim Corcoran ;-sure cnoughjhe's been baring a trifle too mucb refreshments and they've overlooked the spalpeen'and locked him; in; faith it's a way he's got,-but we musn't let . him remain there.

Proceeding to a tradesman in the neighbour* hood, with whom the keys were, deposited, honest Shamus soon returned with them. ' The mob had now considerably increased, and* all was impatience and anxiety.' The door.was speedily unlocked and Shamus descended. ■ 1 Do you see him, do you . see, him ?*. !cried everyone. 1 Devil a haporth/ answered Shamus. :. c Have you found the hole .

'4 T was certain some one was in: the vault/, said Elliston; 1 you sea I was right, ray friends Go down and help the sufferer out'directly, but. take care you don't get into tho hole yourselves as watcheyhas done/ The mob obeyed his directions,' and-while they disappeared' in the; cellar' to extricate Shamas, he with the narrator aiso-disappeared; ia search of the ventriloquist, leaving watchey to get out of the cesspool as well as Kooouldl Overtaking Alexandre intbe "H^ymarbet,1 they made their way to a retired localityiwKero' a celebrated anatomical lecturer * hadthen'a/ museum, or menagerie', as the populace niore -commonly called it, : . . !

Some cauldrons or ' coppers/, it waB stated, were in these gardens, in which' very, questionable broths woro 'continually concocted. In the sido of tho house,'facing' the street, a blank mass of brickwork already mentioned, there was a grated aperture afford, ing both light and air to a vault beneath/ < It was now between nine and ten; there was not a soul to be seen in the street, except an ancient dame who was descending some steps at the further end of the plnce, bearing 1 a hot meat-pro which,she was bringing from a baker's, .' . • 'Now then/,said Ellieton ;to,the^ventrilo quist, 1 throw your voice intothat.vault.

'Then thit fully accounts, for it,* said tho comedian drily; 4 hut the dead body must not he suffered to remain und perish here.'
