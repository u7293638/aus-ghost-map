Yesterday. Yesterday is dead And lies at rest. No breathing stirs The white xdb'd breast; The groans and sobbing Are hush'd at last, Thanks be to Heaven! Such pains are past. Seek not to rouse Its unquiet ghost; Conjure no phantom Of what is lost ; Come away softly ; ^Sjd make no moan, Leaving thy perish'd hope Dead and alone.
