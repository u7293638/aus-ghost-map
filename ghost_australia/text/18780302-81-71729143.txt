SCENE III. SILENCE no longer reigns. Tho .winds, nt first KO timid, have come forth in all their strength and now Bhout victoriously through their dominions. Hark ! aro not tho ghosts of tho dead races at battle with tho gnomes ? No ; 'tis but tho howl of the wolf, soatod at tho mouth of his cave ! Now tho snow sits steadily down, and wearily drag on horse and man, hoavily lifting their snow-cumberod foot. At last-thank God-at last tho shelter of tho grove is gained. Tho wolf is still laugh- ing, scated on tho rock bofore his den, but tho shelter of tho firs is good. The snow cannot come near, but it hastens to raise a widl about tho troos, tho low, outer branches of which almost swoop tho ground. Grateful is his fire of sticks to tho chilled feet of tho wanderer. Tho storm is forgotten while he slumbers. Let gnomes and tho ghosts of warriors battlo- lot tho grey wolf laugh on! Tho lost man sleops and his hungry horse, with Ids noso in tho embers, dreams of the green grass of the lower valloys. Tho red light of the morning sun burns on tho snow and tho slcepor awakes. Oh ! sun, mook not with your brightness, for tho wall of snow is high. Gazing on it, tho heart of tho lost man stands still. Tho Buow-ladon boughs of his trees aro weighed down-they rest upon tho encircling drift. What a beautiful fairy jmlaco our lost man has ! But ho will not look upon or delight in its dazzling walls-he only sighs, and moaus and mutters. Whose aro tho names ho Bpeaks ? Why does ho not bo merry, and sing and danoo in his splendid snow palace ? But his hands clasp his knees ; ho rooks to and fro. Rising, ho appronchos and caresses his dumb companion, and tho horse lovingly rests his hoad against his master's cheek. " 'Tis full fifty milos to tho valloys, good Dobbin," bo says, "and wo must be moving." Quito up to tho breast of tho horse √çB tho snow, as tho pair resumo their journey. Suoh is a storm of a singlo night in tho high Sierras.
