WHITE'S ROOMS. Mr. D'Arcy Read's ghost entertainment opened at White's Rooms on Saturday evening, and was very fairly patronised. The ghostly manifestations are admitted to be the result of applied science, and are not wrought by spiritual or any other supernatural agency. From this point of view they are both clever and amusing ; but the usual allowance must be made for some incosmpleteness in the arrangemenat 0n an open ing night. The spectral part of the programme was a very curious optical delusion, that created aaroatdealofwonderstentands?ecalatioaoatrie part of tbe onlookers, but some of the asters in the flesh were certainly not so well versed in •heir parts as they might have been, aad an im provement in that respect may be looked for. There were four persons who were proficient, bat the remainder of she company will require a few rehearsals before they will merit again the approbation of the auditory. The lint portion of the programme opened with the spectral historical romance of " The Knight Watching his Armoc,™ as originally produced at tbe Polytechnic, London, by Professor Pepper. Hubert de Burgh, a valiant knight, is dis covered watching his armor by command of King James, as was the custom of the age. To wfle away the time he sings asoag dedicated to his lady love," Queen of my Soul f when, on hearing footsteps, he perceives coming through the gloom a man in the garb of a monk, who tesnptshim with wine, and in order to induce him to relinquish his task, carols forth a jo rial song "A Friar of Orders tirej;" but Hubert, who mistrusts him, challenges him to make the sign of his order, which of course the monk cannot, but retires after calling Hubert a coward loon, convincing him that he was right in his surmise that the pretended monk was an evil spirit, who •ought to destroy him. He again ■eturns to his weary task, when a beauteous syren, gliding oat of tbe darkness, tries to lure •him from his duty by describing her fairy home and enchanting his ear with rounds of melody, feat Hubert has sufficient strength of purpose to withstand the temptation and destroy the «harm. He is now visited by another evil spirit in the disguise of a merchant, who offers hiss riches, which he ia about to accept when his intention is happily frustrated by hearing sweet music. His beloved now appears, and as he is about to embrace her she disappears from hi* view. During the act several songs and ■jlnrtn srp simg in a tutj pluming "?""?—• Tbe Phantom Christys are the next performers, and in the concluding act," The Ghosts' Bevels," or the hanntad bouse, a variety of ghostly eccen tricities were indulged in of a most unusual character. The entertainment will be repeated tins evening- RIFLE MATCH. eleven men on each side, and the distances were 980,400, and 600 yards, seven rounds being fired at each range. No slings were used.
