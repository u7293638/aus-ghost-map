ON Friday several hours were occupied in the Assembly in discussing the unemployed question. The debate was started by Mr. M'GOWEN, the leader of the Solidarity party, and it was contributed to by quite a number of the Labour members. All of them suc- ceeded in advertising themselves, but they did nothing more. They, indeed, blamed the Government for neglecting the unemployed ; but, of course, Mr. HKID and his colleagues did not attach much importance to this part of their proceedings, for they know that the j Labour party are under tho Ministerial whip, I and can be depended upon to vote on all critical occasions in a solid block. Make believe, humbug, sham, were the character- istics of the debate. If the' unemployed wait for relief until they get it from Mr. M'Gowen and his followers, they will wait a precious long time. I wonder if there are many working men who believe that the Labour members will do any good for them by their work in Parliament. Probably there are, for it is a hard thing to drive folly out of the brain of the average working man. But if they so believe, the time cannot be far distant when they will wake up to the fact that they have been victims of deception. It is, perhaps, unnecessary for me to say that in the yards of speeches delivered by the Labour members there was not the ghost of a practical suggestion showing how work might be made more plentiful and remunera- tive than it is at present.
