Modem idealism, the critical philosophy the Ham venom dynasty Luther and the Protestant Reformation, and last, but not least, the Anglo Saxon race were 11 made in Germany The ss edifice name of the " new theology " was definitely applied to the line of Christian thought initiated by Albrecht lunch, professor of theology, first lit Born, then at Gottingen Professor Orr find said, no only passed from the scene in 1889, vet already Ins dab idea hold clio 1rs 111 all the leading Universi- ties of (germany, and the ideas and the spirit of his teaching are recognised as the reigning influence in Continental theology and are rapidly penetrating theological thought in Britain and America as well ' Professor I hut had also end, " It t certainly a force in the Theological v t lid which may., be reckoned with, and which eminently deserves to he studied " Rilschl and his successors approached the Christian argument in 1 way differing totally from former willers The whole significance and power of 1 i system lay in the circumstance that he brought to a Christian mind to a new view point in the argument for faith his theory of cognition" was the answer he supplied to the very vital question, How do we arrive at religious certainly ? His answer was based in 11 great measure on the reasoning of the pi eat critical philosopher plant, and was in a sentence that certainty of God and religious truth came not through the pure reason of intellectual faculty, but through the practical reason or moral faculty The intellect yielded side is about God, deductions, philosophic , dogmas, hut they lived at couv actions, certainties about Him through the faculty involv- ing the will in the region of the ' categorical imperative " A line was formed was that the will was primate among the powers in man 1 theology had been made a matter of the intellect series of -positions dialectically proved, but judgements first of all in the practical sphere the will to live The practical note sities of life and progress decided judgment of the world which lay about them Mr Griffith then quoted Kaftan to show that " the will in its high ml form is man 1 practical interest in his own life and destiny It was practical interest that decided him as to what he took to be true for himself everything he met Fraction, not theo retical judgment, love to men the cortauHv on which they acted By that path they need at certitude in religion " Men by searching know not God *' What was there, then, in their environment that possessed for the soul the value of law i Chi let answered to this test Herrmann had said We must be responsive to our environment, and in historical environment there is no more important fact than Jesus Christ " It was undeniable that Christ awaken in the soul the response that only God could a Taken in marche response that the soul can and must give only to God has had always been 10 Pastor ani, " to whom shall we go but to thee I " As it had been with the displease had it been with the fathom of the Church, with the schoolmen, with the monks, with the refer mers, with the Puritans, and with themselves in the modern world The soul had always found in Christ the revelation of God upon which it could not, which awoke its most confident trust and upon which it could venture its all for life or death to this practical basis Bitschl brought them back " The revoHtiou value of Christ is the positive prin- cape of Christian theology " With strong hand ho wrenched the Church round from the scholastic and idealistic by stems of theology, built 011 theoretical judgment, and turned hi eyes fully and solely on the revelation of God in Christ, as it had awakened I a practical response from the first time down to the present. Mr Griffith dealt with the strength of the position taken amend. quoM BitBelil^hoafud, " One fact in the whole world can give us con« Evidence that God exists for us, namely, the appearance of Jesus in history He is the fact that can make us certain that God communes with ns " Re- ferring to the testimony of history, Mr Griffith said real history lay in the enacted events, which remained unalterable. It was no theory of God and no story of God that was the price a source of revelation, but Jesus himself, who he was a real part of the history into which they had been born The ones or no theories, infallible or gullible documents, higher criticism or no higher criticism, they could not eliminate the person City of Jesus from the world as it existed Plio roy elation of God now touched them through environment everywhere from childhood up. I the person date of Christ rams to them every where. He was beneath them like the í solid ground, and above them like the atmosphere and heart He was real, and the revolution he brought of God was real Die theology that based itself on the foundation of the appeal ance of Christ in history, is proving that God existed, dealt the death blow to uncertainty and agnosticism, and leave the Church a bold, positive, and confident faith That was the achievement of the system of which To wsBipciking It also brought spiritual force to their service in the is deceptive work of the Church and iii battle with social and public evils " the revol- lion value of Jesus was the positive principle of Christian theology revelling the love of God as a holy purpose, which was productive through human (souls of a holy kingdom He " new theology " seeking for truth in the field of the certain and the actual brought more directly back to the right track The establishment of the kingdom of God summed up Christ's teaching He was the kingdom of (joel It was his personality to call r 'lie I niggers they must let Christ co for them, and the direct effect would be to transform them into the kingdom that was how the world was to be to listened into His kingdom in Christ they discovered the heart of God respecting themselves, society, and the race. There was a great purpose ruling all things, and behind that purpose was the whole sting of the Godhead When Christ was accepted he so penetrated men that with the working of the carnal pur pose they became ethical social revolution- Go men who turn the world upside down " It was manifest that Christ's Church did not exist for controversies, but for bruising in the kingdom and on this basis Christendom was already fast re dinner!', and along this line he believed reunion was certainly possible The Church, like its Master, must perpetually challenge all evils and say, " In the name of the Lord we will destroy them " laissez-faire could not rule in the Church The policy of silence was one of treachery and cowardice. I ho kingdom must be a force and beat down its enemies 1 oncuth its feet They were not to party, but to strike and overtime Whatever would have been wrong in Jesus was wrong in society, wrong in the State Christ of as the standard of the kingdom. What he condemned they must condemn It was the Church of Christ that must take Parliament and public opinion into its own hands The Church of Christ was Strong enough to do these things if its members were all invited to the kingdom Men with besmirched characters, men who had compromised themselves before the judicial tribunals of the land, would november sent to frame laws for these tribunals in the members of the Churches of Christ were all loyal to the kingdom They would bear down police, magistrate, and judge, compelling them to put into force the laws they already possessed against the drink curse, the gambling curse, and immorality and licentiousness The kingdom was to come on earth, and its members were to make its politics the politics of the earth Dr Kidd had demonstrated the position Iii it social evolution, which was moving surely towards more satisfactory human conditions was the result of the altruistic sentiment 1 brought into national and social life with the ever increasing power of the Church of Christ Do this by the answer to the problems of capitalism, competition, sweating, and pauperism It might take 100 or TWO years to do it, but the force was in the world and r could revolutionise the world Good citizenship was now a tilauL of the churches every where Voting power was being consecrated to the question of the government of New South Wales according to the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven These questions were being considered in their churches under the direct and recognised presidency of the unseen Christ, because of the conviction that existed in their minds that all governs out must at any cost I or sacrifice be brought into line with the eternal purpose of God, actually revealed in Christ They must challenge evil rampant at their very doors, but would say " II will wreck the Church," but had they no faith in Christ ' Let them he determined to wreck evil, and leave it to God whether the Church was to be wrecked or not Revelling in conclusion to the new theology, Mr Griffiths said that may ing as it did in the sphere of the actual it exalted the kingdom as the purpose of the revelation of God contained in Christ in the, bringing in of the kingdom the act of atonement was indispensable Only by an atonement for sin could the Holy God estab- lish his kingdom of love, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost in a world of sinners his purpose of love could only reveal itself as a purpose of grace The focus of their faith must be placed anywhere else than in the passion of the Redeemer Because men had placed the focus of with elsewhere than in the passion of Christ modern preaching had lost the mighty Bhattonug, creating note of Paul, Augustine, Luther, Edwards, and Wesley " They must take the Father hood as it was revealed to them, not as they might choose of to view it through an idealistic theory They must view it only through the cross The demand of the conscience of ill ethics was that he should not be condoned, but atoned Without shedding of blood there was no remission " Atsuemont was an eternal law of ethics It was the revolution that would awaken the response of repentance and faith and newness of life 'They might as well dissolve as a union, close the doors of their churches, and burn thoirpulpita as sapless firewood if they lost their hold on this gospel. How could they hope for the regeneration of society, the State, the world, or the progress of the kingdom, if the power was lost to convince and, convert the individual soul as He would close his address by quoting the words of Dr Forsyth, which summed up much that he had been saying " The cross has still the living word forman The agnostic age is really past, the growing saul resentsuud rejects it We hail in the new world about us the idea of revelation ' Herein is love , not that we loved God but that He loved us * The restlessness of man is a dim response to a felt movement towards us of God The teeming idea of revelation is bearing down in human thought the mute creed of the unknown and incommunicable God. It is also the ruling idea in the theology which will mark this century Christ, the historic Christ, is the revelation of trod The cross is the revelation of Christ as the world's arts (course and the world's Saviour " The address was listened to with great interest, and punctuated with frequent applause from the audience An anthem mis 1 endured by the choir, and the usual devotions brought the meeting to a close
