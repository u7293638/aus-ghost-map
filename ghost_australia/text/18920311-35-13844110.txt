SHAKSPEARE : FOR S A GE OR STUDY? ??? ? ? (Pall Mall Gazette.) Some account has I then given of Mr Beerbohm I Tree's interesting experiment on a. London audience with " L'Intruse," the weird and curious "drama for marionettes" by the young writer who has been absurdly called " The Belgian Shakspeare " Whether the Belgian Shakspeare will " run " in London remains to be seen but the old manager's m wind about the English one " spelling ruin" is fairly obsolete in those Lyceum days Mr Tree himself has joined Mr Irving in proving that it is worth an actor managers while to "put his money) on" the Bard and at this moment all the oldShnkspciro questions are thoroughly) alive What have the learned to say about them 2 We presume that the dramatic critic exists for the edification of the actor as well as of the theatregoer But Mr Beerbohm Tree, for inst race will be puzzled if he seeks enlightenment m playing "Hamlet" from two books which have just been published The authors are divided on the pi una Jackie question as to whether he ought to be playing Hamlet at all, or any other Shakspeare part Sir Walkley, the author of "Plajhoiiso Impressions," a series of slight but entertaining critiques reprinted from the States and elsewhere, is strong in support of acting Shakspeare, and of noting Iluinlet in particular He scouts utter!) some professor's dictum that the text, not the play, but the text's the thing, that "neither acting nor scenery will bet in his (Stick spence's) turn with us We shall find in the text the key to every problem ' Pooh ' sins Mr Walkley and he has still to be said for him, that Shakspeare was a pin) cr, and never c fired a hang what hap- pened to any single text 171m text) " The text of a play is no more the prov than a score is music According to this astonishing contention, to read the pianoforte arrangement of the Broken ' Svm phonyis to throw upon Beethoven (parodying a phrase of the professor by his full responsibility as a music ii artist " This is nil encouragement for the motor ButUienhenrMr Brander Matthews, in editing a pretty) little 1 offer tion of Charles Lamb's Dramatic Essays" Alluding to Limb's well known contention that Shakespeare (alone of playwrights) was spoilt 111 playing, Mr Matthew b remarks H) apathetically) that Lamb, is "a true level of Shakespeare from his youth up," " could see more in his mind's eye than the most lay men and learned 01 st ige-nianugcrs could give him " and then slightingly com odes a wanton critic to the Shakespeare play house in the degrading consideration that " the men of common humanity li is no mind's eye " This is rather hard on the footlights They are disposed of as a mere dan lenient and nuisance to the true Shnkcspeiean, who has nothing to learn, it is implied, from the combinations of the stage That does not mean that Shakespear. had nothing to teach by them if he, " so much the less Shakespeare's or at least, so much the loss dramatist No it must mean that all those thousand and one section of interpretation which depend on the grouping of persons in a scene and their various relationships have been already guessed by the student by a procesS of imagining a stage representation with or without such mechanical aids as Mr W S Gilbert is said to employ in the composition of his pieces, in the shape of a toy theatre with counters for motors This may well be It is credible enough that with some pains, and a cess-pit) or's bend, a man may supply artificially the conditions to which Shakespeare, for his part, was not above adapting his imaginative week-end which have led to the striking fact that of all his plays the one which is deepest in thought is also most dramatic, almost melodramatic, in plot and incident Tor 'Hamlet" is undeniably), as Mr Brander Matthews remarks, " every sensational play) " "It has a ghost and a duel in it, and no end of fighting, and an indiscriminate slaughter at the end, and before that consummation a young lad) goes mad in white muslin, and there is a clown at the burying, and a fight over her grave " The truth is, of course (as no doubt Mr Matthews really agrees), that Lamb wrote the essay in question in his familiar vein of paradox He himself, in his own practice, exemplified the fact that the better the Shakespearean the loss willing he will always be to miss any representa- tion of his author promising any sort of decent acting The difficulty in the case of "Hamlet" consists in the very fact that the playwright has hero left such a tremendous lot to the player You must play) Hamlet on a theory if you play him at all And therein, most probably, lies the essence of Lamb's objection. It was like what he said about the gallery of Shakespeare's pictures Hoobjeotol to having his imagination tied down to the paint and 1 any us of this or that Royal Academician to have clear-headed Reynolds's Juliet, putty-he ided Tnseli's Juliet, and so on two quote from meinorj),instead of Shakespeare's Juliet, my Juliet, sour and everybody's Juliet Yet nobody would deny that each and all of these Juliets, like each and all of the Hamlets created by actors of genius, may well throw sidelights on that cloudy oiled original which lives in nobody's back garden, but among the inaccessible summits of Shakespeare's imagination There is a great deal in Lamb's essays about the playing of Hamlet in particular, as we oil as the wilful contentions about not playing Shako spenio 111 general The character had the same fascination for the essayist which it had for the many other geniuses whom it set to theorising from Goethe downwards, whose brilliant criticism in " Wilhelm Meister " is well known Lamb's best remarks upon the part are to be found in the very essay which is under discussion one which appeared as Theatialm, No 1," 111 Leigh Hunt's " Reflector " We should refer Mr Tree to it at once if his finished version of Hamlet did not suggest that he had been there already Mr Tree has gone as far as possible, without actual interpolation or omission, to explain away, if the phrase may be allowed, the surface brutalities of Hamlet Speak- ing of these, and giving what is now the accepted interpretation of them, Lamb goes on as follows - Yet such is the actor's necessity of giving strong blows to the audience that I have never seen a player in this character who did not exaggerate and strain to the utmost these nm biguous features, these temporary deformities in the character They make him express a vulgar scorn at Polonius which utterly degrades his gentility and curl up the nose at Ophelia's father, but they got applause by it It is natural, people say that is, the words are scornful, and the actor expresses scorn, and that they can judge of So to Ophelia All the Hamlets that I have over seen rant and rave at her as if she had committed some great crime, and the audience are highly pleased, because the words of the part are satirical, and they are enforced by the strongest expression of satirical indignation of which the face and voice are capable But then, whether Hamlet is likely to have put on such brutal appearances to a lady whom he loved so dearly is never thought on If Mr Tree wants high countenance for his '* business " of coming back after a raging exit to kiss the fainting Ophelia's hair-, and the like, he may certainly, in view of this passage, subpoena Eliza from the shades Eba, who, even with Hnzhtt for a contemporary, surely ranks as a prince of all English dramatic critics Take Ayers.
