THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 1873. The best wine was biouglit foith in the Legislative Assembly last c emng at tlie commencement of the debate on the second reading of the Elcctoial Act Amendment Bill, and those who waited until the close had to put up with an m fenoi vintage Mi WRIXOV opened the discussion in a speech evincing con sideiable bieidth of view and elevation of sentiment, and animated by a desire to supeisede local delegation by genertl iepresenlation He jointed out tint the Government measuie, if adopted m its piesentfoim, would have the eflect o stiengthemng the Upper House, and of weakening the populu blanch of the Legislatuic Whitevei defects the ox istiiig system might have, it had this ment at any late-that it enabled t v inety of inteiests and opinions to mike themselves heaid while the pioposed îefomi would eveivwheie silence the minoiity, and make the majonty the exclusive deposítanos oí political powei Noi could he appiove of an in ci ease in the nuinbci of membeis, and the addition il pion liience which would be thus given to nntteis of meiely local md municipal concern, which it would be much bett« to ide gate to local bodieb to man ige and decide upon He explained the diflei euee of the mode of government adopted in the United States to that which piev.uls hue, contend ing foi the bupcuouty of the foi mei, and laid great sticss upon the lmsclueis which acciue in Victoria, fiom the pei foi manee by the Administration of the smallest local w ork, wheieby gene lal pnnciples weie suboidinated to petty and piovincval necessities, the Govern ment was weakened, and the elmactei of the repiesentatives was lovveied In stead of piomotmg a fingal and judi cious expenditure of the public money, it encouraged extiavagance and piofu sion , and the lepiesentative, instead of legislating foi the whole community, was expected to disclmgo the func- tions of a local agent But willie, on the one hand, the Btate could not, and would not, furnish lum with a suffi clent amount of remuneration to enable him to devote his whole time to the performance of his public duties, those duties wore sufficiently numerous and oneious to prevent lum fiom puisuing lus private avocations with adequate attention and success Mr. WRIXON explained and defended Mr HAKE'S system, and i (.commended its partial and experimental application to a conti al constituencj, composed, foi example, of Melbourne and aub uibs He obaeived that lu. could verj well understand the objections which weie capable of 1 eing uiged against a scheme of proportional rcpie sentation, on the giound of its novelty, but he was at a loss to comprehend those which weie laiaed against the le» sons of expcnence , and concluding by pointing out, YYith great force, how im possible it is for the principle of self government to haYc f tir play, unless a practical íeniedy is applied to acknow ledged CYIIS Mi VAII seemed to be of opinion that the counliy and the House weie m t Ycij fcYer of impatience to hear soma authoiitative declaration of his senti ments concerning the bill before tho House, ind were adjuring lum, a« HAMLIT adjured his fathers ghost, ¿' Let me not burst in ignorance Accordingly, he unburdened himself, thus eaily in the debate, launch mg into that delicious confusion of metaphor Yvhich is at once the temptation, the delight, and the peril of the fluent " populai oratoi, talking about the measuie "meeting " the basis Yvluch w ould actuate him, with a sublime unconsciousness of the nonsense he was utteimg Ho signi lied his Yvnim approval of the single seat sjstem, and darkly hinted tint undei the piesent elector ii act theie Yvas just a baie possibility of his being " ciushed out of a return to that House-a calaimtj which, although incapable of being contemplated with equauumtj by Mr W M K VALE, IS one YYIUCII his biother membeis looked as if they might possibly survive, howsoever poignant then soiiOYV might be undei the first lude shock of tho affliction As to Mr HARES sjstem, the speakers objections to it weie not founded upon any per soual consideiation, since his modesty Yvoiild not prevent lum from avowing his belief that he at any late would bo secure of a seat among the universal faY ourites of the collectiY c people But he opposed that scheme because it en ablcd fragments of the community to be represented Universal suf f_ age-Mi YALE seems to think -means the îepresentation of ma lonties only, and that all shades of opinion, all classes, and all interests, should have a Yoice pioportionatc to their numbers, m the making of the laws they are expected to obey, and in the administiation of the revenues towards Yvhich they aie compelled to contribute, does appeal to the voluble member foi ColhngYv ood a monstrously unjust and îriational pioposition He even quoted the late RICHARD COBDEN as an advei sary of propoitional repiesentatiou, though YYhy th it gentleman should be refened to as an authonty upon a sub j cet to which he only gaYe a limited amount of attention, and should be de nded as an authority upon a question which he had mide the study of his life-the question of free trade-is one of those inconsistencies YYIIICII can only admit of being explained by that curiously anomalous charactei, a demo ciatic piotectioimt and liberal mono polist It Y\as expected that Mi HIGIN BOTHAM would haYG followed Mi VALE, but the nights debate was closed bj Mi PATTErsoN, who Y\as alliterative and discmsiYe, and made a íeasonable appioach to the mamifactuie of an epigiam, Y\heu he said-although he failed to piove-that "Yvido electoi ii " districts meant a Y\ ide indifference to " political affans Tor his own sake, foi the sake of tho Ministry of which ho is a member, and foi sake of ¿ood Parliamentary go Yeinment, it is greatly to be regretted that the lion the Tieasurer has not i little moie tact Aa a nile ho addi esses even the supporters of the Govern ment m such a mannei as to cause imtition and pioYoko

the delay in each case had occuned With this Mi JINNER WIS h tidly sitisfied, but had really nothing to say not said on the former occasion, except that the cost of the delivery of telegiapluc messages was out of all proportion to what it would bo if, instead of being sent by special mcssengci, they woio sent by post This was îeally shifting his giound m a way m which ho was not altogcthoi consistent with himself, the nicieased cost of which he cora plains being inclined foi no othei pui pose than that of seeming the more speedy deliv ery of messages on which he so much insists It is not protended that mistakes nevei occur in the Telegiaph depaitmont, it would bo sti ango, indeed, if somo did not, when, as Mr Jj.WEB himself allowed, between eighty and mnetv thousand messages pass through the vanous offices dmmgthe yeal, and hav e to bo delivered , but these mistakes must be few m number, when Mi JEN NXII, aftei all his hunting up, was only able to hnd five oi six, and these simply relating to delay m then deliv ery Of Ali JAMES S efficient management of the Telegraph department we spoke on i formel occa 61011 and need not repeat what WP then said hore But this w e may

The Mayor of Geelong has at the îequest of a large numbei of lequisitiomsts con veiled a meeting to be held on 1 riday even mg to considei the Sunday tiams ques tion At the Geelong Police Court yesterday a girl named Bensch hitherto bearing a respect able character summoned a young man named Roche to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of her illegiti- mate child of which she stated he was the father. She stated in evidence that the child was the result of illicit intimacy extending over a period of three years that the de- fendant had proposed to marry her and that they often met together and had been seen together particularly on a Sunday evening. This statement was corroborated by witnesses, but Roche on being placed in the witness box denied all that had been stated, alleging that that had not been seen walking with the plantiff for three years, but admitted in cross examination that he had conversed with her on several occasions within the last 12 months. He stated that he had not seduced the girl, but she had endeavoured to force him to marry her and then tried to extort money from him. In the absence of sufficient evidence the Bench had no alternative but to dismiss the case It is evident however that per jury must have been committed by one of the parties.
