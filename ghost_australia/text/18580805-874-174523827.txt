TOUCHING LINES. BY A PASSENGER IN THE VICTORIA. On a melancholy case of self-destruction during the voyage out. The sea was smooth, the wind was fair, And the mail-ship going a-head full tear, When came the cook with husky voice, To bid us all no more rejoice, With tears, and lachrymose hubbub; He said as he was short of grub, The meat was most used up, and now Had dwindled to a single sow. The captain was the first to speak, And pallid grew his manly cheek; With stern resolve his soul was big, Says he, "you cook that blessed pig," "Butcher, that skill of which you boast, To-morrow claims that porker's ghost." The morrow came, the crew were met, To see the pig pay Nature's debt; High flashed in air the fatal knife, Short was the span of porcine life, 'Twas an impressive moment when, In sight of all those hungry men, The butcher fellow stooped to note The proper point in piggy's throat— Down came the blade, but artful brute, It didn't his complexion suit, So wriggling from the deadly grip, The grunter gave his foe the slip; A moment more—and butcher roared "Confound the beast, he's overboard!"— Full sore the Captain's nerve was shaken To find he could not save his bacon, Completely did the mishap flummax The passengers' expectant stomachs; Thus after all this piece of work To be so diddled of their pork. Of course, when all the row was quelled The skipper had an inquest held; The verdict brought was not "found drowned;" But—drowned, and never after found."
