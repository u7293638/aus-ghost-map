ANOTHER GHOST STORY. A GHOST story has been exciting some attention at Strathalbyn, South Australia, and in the Southern Argus of this week there appears the following statement, made by Mr. W. T. Tregalgas, of Strath- albyn. The facts are these:â€”"Whilst taking a walk very early one morning, through some motive which I cannot account for I was induced to walk through the burying ground, and coming to a grave surrounded by a wall, and covered with a slab of slate, I noticed on the slate something strange. It was scarcely light enough to see distinctly at first, but after waiting for some few minutes I could see it plainly, and it appeared to be a side view of a female. I could distinctly trace the head and body and the skirts, apparently full size. Net boing satisfied with the sight I rubbed my hand on the form, and found that a portion of the slate was perfectly dry, whilst the parts outside the form were very wet with the dew which had fallen, and still not being satisfied I walked away, and came back in about fifteen or twenty minutes after, and still the form was there ; so I determined upon visiting it again next morning, which I did, and continued doing so for a week or more. During'this time I only saw the form once after the first morning ; but not being a believer in supernatural appearances I tried to define the cause, bnt failed. In the course of conversation I told Mr. Morton what I had seen, and he visited the place, and saw the form, although not so plain as it was when I saw it. The form was to be seen, and it has been seen since by others. Now, I believe there is some natural cause which produces this strange appearance, and perhaps some person npon reading this will be able to satisfy the minds of those who have seen it, for although many things have been advanced by people as to the prob- able cause, none seem satisfactory to my mind, and three who have been eye-witnesses of the sight."
