Addison, wo are told, wore out the patience of his printer; frequently, when nearly a whole impres sion of the Spectator was worked oCf, he would stop the press to insert some new proposition. Lamb's most sportive i u e i ' * essays were the result ot most intense hraiu labor ; he used to spend a week at a time in writing a single humorous letter to a friend. Tennyson is re ported to bovo written 'Come inlo the Garden, Maud,' more Ihan fifty times over lu-fure it pleased him; and ' Locks lev Hall,' tbe first droftof which was written in two days, he spent the better part of siK weeks for eight hours o day, in altering and polishing. Dickens, when he intruded lo write a Chrisiraas story, shut himself up for six weeks, living tbe life of a hermit, and coming out as haggard as a murderer. Balzac, afkT he Im 1 thought out one of bis manner, retired to his study and from tbat time until bis book went to press society saw him ,.., more.

Buf fon's 'Story of Nuture' cost him iflv years of labor before he sent it to tbo printer. ' He composed it n a singular manner writing ou largo sized paper, in which, as in a ledger, live distinct columns were ruled. In the first column ho wrote jown tbe first thoughts ; in the second he corrected, enlarged, or pruned it; and so ou until be readied tbe fifth column, within which be finally wrote the results of his labors. But even after this he would compose a sentence seventy times, and once devoted four teen hours to finding the proper word to round off a period.' .lohn Forster oftor spents hours on a binglc seutenco.
