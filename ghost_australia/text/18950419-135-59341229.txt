CRICIKE'T NO~EIB. (Br Fn=l?UJS ). ridlast a number of cricketers Fitzvriy vFisited Traralgon and from Fi,?,ndly game on the show pla√Ω ThI e day being a holiday h-O ?. a good attendance of speo th.e alt hough fine the weather tanr. b hin.t but agreeable, a cold 's sin blowing all day. Had the wind bin from the west, the grand wind old have sheltered on-lookers, stand wld the reverse, many were blu to leave the stand and walk ga ut in order to warm themselves. anhouth the game was supposed to nse 5hsrted early, it did not begin to hatve. 1s . This was due to the Tearlagon men not turning up, and evenat that time, part of the team had te picked from those on the ground. Tpe result of this was that the Tra r?lon Club had not a ghost of a chooce of even making a respectable ahow"f We would strongly advise them in future, whenaMelbourne team iexpected to make better arrange is ente very good combined team might have been got together, which wo.da have put the visitors on their me.le, and made things a little more live? for the spectators, several of hvom came from Morwell and Tinnar, e-xpeting to see a good game. In fairness, however, to the Traralgon Club I must say that some of their best players were detained through circumstances over which they had no contrl The Fitzroy men were tall, athletic fellows, and the team com prised some of the pick of the club, so that lthough they played 18 of T'rarO'tn, the 12 were more than a match for them. The Fitzroy skipper havinu won the toss, elected to take ?e field, being evidently desirous of seeing what a score they would have to beat. Serjeant and Bell opened the innings, to the bowling of J. Patterson and M'Kirdy. Bell was speedily caught off the latter's bowling, and several others were got rid of for a few runs. Serjeant knocked up 14 by good cricket, the fielding being so good that only one or two could be scored at any time. Dr Horne was the only other man to get into double figures, his score being IS. Keys came next with 9 and Forge 3, Dubber andM'Farlane abrace each, therest being out of it. Byes contributed 13, and there were no less than eleven who did not trouble the scorers. The innings closed for a total of 57, Twentyman having the splendid average of 4 wickets for no rn, Patterson 10 for 26, and M'Kirdy 2for IS. Twentyman and Brooks opened the inninrs for the Fitzorv team, and speedily set to work, though the ~stoing was slow at first, no liberties being taken with thesbowling. After a time, however, the bowlers got knocked about a good deal, both batsmen making drives for five,all run. When Twentyman had scored 52, or three less than the whole Traralgon team. he retired, and Brooks was shortly afterwards caught by Keys off Hickoxs bowling, when he had made 4i. M.Kirdy played a good innings for 26, and J. Patterson retired when he had scored 31. Edgoose was run out for 11 and none of the restreached double figures. The innings closed for 196, but would have been much more had it not been for the splendid bowling of W. Hickox, who got five wickets for 34 runs. The Traralgon team comtmenced theii second innings by sending in Stephens and Hales, who stopped at the wickets for some time but failed to score many runs. Stephens at length lashed ont at a ball and sent it to the long field where it was caught. Gunn took the vacant crease, and kept it till time was called though Hudson had been caught out in the meantime, W. Hickox taking his place. When time was called four wickets had fallen for 33\.
