KIDD'S 0PEN CONFESSION. This is the burden of no spook. It is not the utterance of the reckless ghost of the immortal pirate, Captain Kidd, whose alleged buried treasures disturb the imagina- tion of cupidity. It is the plain business confession of Mr. Kidd, the N.S.W. Post- master-General. In effect, he says: — "You say that Ministers are fond of appointing their friends and relatives to fat billets in the Civil Service. Well, what of it ! If they didn't appoint their friends, whom, in the name of thick blood, should they appoint? ' If you were Ministers' says Kidd, ' You'd do the same as we have did. 'We cannot understand the fuss— You'd do the very same as us.' No, Kidd ! No kid. For we'd be wise, And, artfully, we'd compromise; We'd give our foes the billets, sirs, And make our friends all Ministers. All Ministers, or members less, So that we'd flourish long, we guess; And, with supporters at our back, Our foes would soon be " in the pack." Old Parkes we'd purchase with a pension ; McMillan, boss of Hen Convention; Bruce-Smith, George Reid, and other smudges Should be retreated with the Judges; Girt McElbone with golden chains, Perhaps we'd have to kill Jack Haynes; Put " Wing'em Abbott' under Crick; Hand 'Tiger' Inglis to Old Nick; Make Edward Pulsford registrar; Send Cotton by the Royal Tar ; We'd find our enemies all muzzles, And, leaving out the special puzzles, We'd billet all the Labor leaders ; Grant lauds to Single-taxing pleaders; And, with our friends behind, canoodle The State for all its itchful boodle. This is the end of Statesmanship— To get and hold the upper grip; To keep closed hands upon the pile, And smile and rob, and rob and smile.
