THE BISHOP ON CHRISTMAS DAY. The Right Rev Dr Moorhouse preached at St Pauls Church on Christmas morning to a large congregation He selected for his text the 14th verse of the last chapter of St John's Gospel -"And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us He observed that it was impossible for any man to utter in words the great mystery which was celebrated that day St Augustine scrupled not to declare that peradventure John himself spake not the thing as it is but only as he was able ' Had he not been inspired he had spoken nothing As he was inspired he spake somewhat but as he was still no more than man mapire 1 he Blake not the whole as it is, but only what man could Nevertheless to be able to say even thus much it is certain that he must have scaled a height of contemplation well nigh in accessible to our thought Ah the same great father said he had ascended beyond all the mountain tops of the earth beyond all the fields of the sky beyond all the heights of the morE beyond all the choirs and legions of the hills for how unless he had transcended the height of all these had he been able to gaze into the face of their Creator To have said of the earth and of the heavens and of all things therein that God made them, though a hard thing, had not been impossible to man But to to further and to speak of what God was in Himself, to declare that He who made all things was that eternal Wordwho endeavour, I'la lathers Ljory took flesh in the days of Pontius 1 date-this were not only hard but impossible to man to see so great a thing as this the prophet must needs have soared away above all heights of being into the glory of the uncreated into an ether which now ing can beat but the pinion of inspiration It might be asked whether we could be quite sure at this time of day that such was indeed the pinion upon which the apostle soared, or that the vision which he saw of the eternal Word of God was any thing, better than guess tradition or in ference J he answer was that if we be Chris trans indeed-if we have been borrowed by the power of the Holy Ghost of we are so living and watching and Staying that we have our life hidden with Christ in God then there is no smile truth in the whole round of our knowledge of which we should have a firmer assurance than that which was expressed in the text for the fact and truth of the Incarnation and the sources at once of all our spiritual knowledge and all our By actual experience If by some miraculous means anyone could induce in our minds a doubt as to the fact of the Incarnation the result would he not only to disturb the harmony of our thoughts but to convert the whole contents of our spiritual conscious ness into an insoluble enigma leaving us in the i presence of results without causes and of experiences without either origin or bil nificance To the Christian man the doctrine of the Incarnation was as necessary to explain the phenomena of his inner life as to the philosopher in the law of travi tation to explain the movements of the heavenly bodies In whatever direction we might look whether to the nature of our annual life or to its value we were driven to the conclusion that He who gave and preserves it to us is divine that in sharing, His life we are made partakers of the divine nature and that in short we must seek the secret of all Christian (race and the key of all Christian truth in the wondrous affirmation of the text-that the same Divine Word who was in the be LiiinniL, with God, and was God was at the Christmas season in the flesh and dwelt among, b If what had been suggested was well founded it was apparent that we were obliged to believe the doctrine of the Incarnation not only because we are told to believe it in the word of God, but also because the facts of our spiritualliieimperativelydemaud it for their explanation As a great States man recently reminded us 13 Christians out of every hundred are agreed on the truth of this doctrine A living Christian indeed almost must believe it One thing, at least was certain, that when once a Christian man of any communion has got this great truth fixed in his heart one can no more send it away and leave him a Christian than he could tear out his heart and leave him a man It might be said that there are many non Christians who doubt it and of course there are the infidelity on this point of the god less part of the world was predicted long ago by St John and surely what he said of the false prophet with a lamb like face had never in all history received a more striking, fulfil ment than in the fierce blasphemies of the German materialists v hat was predicted by some as certain more than 20 years ago had now come to pass It had been proclaimed in Germany (and by no unauthontative voice) not only that the disciples of what is called free thought have ceased to be Christians or even lheiBta but also that the public worship of a personal God ought to be prohibited by 1 wv It was coming about then as St John foretold that the false prophet who had power to give life to the image of the beast (that God evacuated force which Dr Strauss worshipped) should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be put to death And how then does the Church of Christ look upon this portentous development of atheistic in tolerance in this 10th century After her Saviour's birth In she astonished' now can that be when the portent was foretold' Is She then, dismayed' Dismayed at the beast like a prophet whose end is to descend into the pit Never did athlete more rejoice at the prospect of exerting his strength than does the Church of Christ at this moment in the prospect of a death struggle with her Saviour s deadly foe I his clear trumpet note of challenge has wakened such an eagerness for battle as was never felt passing through the hearts of God s saints before Many Dunga might be shaking and tottering in this sinful world, but one thing was certain that all the rage of men and devils would have no more power to quench the life of Christ s Church than the waves of the sea to put out the light of the sun We know tins for the Lord our God, the eternal Word made flesh, is in the midst of us they who strike at a strike at Him and can only then reach as when they have been to pieces the buckler of Omnipotence that is why we are so calm That is why we can come and kneel so quietly at the cradle of Bethlehem, while the whole world is in confusion It is our God who lies there the everlasting Word made flesh and to us the in ght roar of the great sea is at nothing while we sing the praises of its Judge and King What have we to do with the boast. or threats of the godless multitude' We have come to Our Lord s cradle that we may get the hearts of little children We have come to him like the helpless beings who were brought on beds and couches in the days of His earthly ministry to be made whole We have come like the simple shepherds to kneel and wonder and adore Let us kneel on till we have learnt at that cradle to be more humble, more happy, and, above all, more unworldly-till in that stable by that bed of straw, with cattle and peasants around us and the simple unlearned suffering life before us, all the pride and hardness, all the greed and impurity of our hearts may fade away, and rising above the world, with its mean cares and meaner glory, -we may dwell in spirit in Christ a everlasting peace What is the use of wealth or of the crown of culture or of the purple of power ' Behold it here in the holy stable, where putting on the robes of His eternal glory, our God lies wrapped in swaddling clothes and cradled in a manger Glory is for humbleness power in for service wealth IB for succour, purity is for pity love is for sympathy -in one word full ness lb for need even as at this blessed Christmas time God emptied himself of his fitness for man it is because it brings with it this divinest lesson that all men feel at this Christmas season as if a wave of heavenly mr were sweeping over their life-as if a sweet voice once familiar and even yet not less than deal to the most careless were whispering in their hearts of peace and goodwill Who with such thoughts in his heart, could need to be reminded of his duty to the poor and destitute ' What honest man indeed, could feel himself entitled to each joy unless he had done what in him lay to make the poorest of our fellow creatures share it 2 The only difficulty was to be sure that our Christmas gifts should achieve their purpose and that difficulty the Ladies Benevolent Society enabled us to overcome In their hands we might be assured that our arms would be neither abused nor wasted, and they might be given liberally, without grudging and without fear, in the name of and for the sake of Him who at this time came to visit us in great humility At the close of the service a collection amounting to Â£37 17s 8d was made for the benefit of the Ladies Benevolent Society The electric light has been employed for military and naval purposes in Germany among others for lighting up the ground lying in front of a besieged fortress, for the illumination of ships at sea, and notably for carrying on work under water The Bavarian Government has adopted a system of orthography arranged by the late Professor Raumer and a committee of ex- perts, and it is to be introduced into all the schools, so as to put an end to the complaints of difference in spelling
