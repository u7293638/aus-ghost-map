No ono will dispute tlio gravity of the questions on which tho opinion oi the Synod was pioposed to bo taken There aro, probably, many thousands of people throughout the country whose minda have beon moio or less exetciscd about theso matters One of the resolutions dealt with the alleged lack ot Christian principio m the Lfigicilaturn, nnothor dopfoied the extent and evil offocts ot gambling m the community , a third aimed at tho piohilu tion of the liquor ti allic , aud tho fourth lecommended tho piodamatton by the Government of a day of humiliution foi sin and of piajorfor the removal ot the commercial dppiession The appoarance of these íesolut.ons on the business paper of the Synod Bhow ed, what has often been Bhown Wore, how well meaning mon, who haT beon looking abroad upon the conditions of the woild around them and have gathoiod stiong impressions as to the provalonce of eui on every side, ate some- times cairied away by an liiesiBtible ieel mg that something must be done to abate those evils, and seek relief from the tension in giving expression to then fuolings But, in the treatment of quebtioni of social intciest and tho complications that bunound them, it is one thing to bo o\«borne by a Btrong conviction that something must bo done, and anotuei to dotoimiuo w_at *-a bo dono with hope of success, and to deviso practical methods for doing it. In ranttors ot this naturo the first lesson to bo lenrnod is that nothing should bo dono inconsiderately. 'lho second losson is taught when mon come togelhor to con- sider seriously what line of action is likely to bo benencial, and what is practicable in the actual cncumstances, and the lesson is the futility of attempts by oven tho best mtentioned and most earnest men to accomplish lar^o social reform, by tho advocacy of dtastic mea suies Tlio Synod, in declining to enter- tain tho questions submitted, showed a due appieciation of surrounding conditions aud a true estimate of its own powers and functions Ono of tho resolutions which was not moi ed pioposod that the 8} nod should pass censuro upon tlio Legislature for culpably neglecting to deal with questions affecting the social and moral well- I being of tho people, and that it should urgo the electors in the Church of Eng- land to return hououiable, Qod-feaimg, p'ituotio men to the Assembly. Now, the bynod in passing such a resolution as this m ouid have placed itself m a ialse position. The formal vote of censure upon the Legis lntuie would have earned with it an im- plication that it is for Parliament, rather than for the Churches, to promote the social and moral wellbemg ot the people In that dnection the limits of Parlia moutarj action aro soou reached, but if the Churcl cs have lost or tail to exercise their logitiniato itiiluence upon the community, it is lor them in the first instance to set their own house in order. Wo ty mpnthiso with the dobiro that men of the class described should be returned to Parliament, but would one moro voto havo boon given with that end in view by reason of the urgent leeommendation of the Church S3 nod? Wo want as many mon of tlio class dosenbed as wo can get in Parliament, but other qualifica- tions aio essential if wo aro to have an oflioicnt and tiustworthy Assembly, If men of tlio class rofened to stand aloof horn politics, do not btuay politics, do not take sutliuent interest m I pubho affairs to fit themselves I ior mombeiship or to piss through the 1 struggles of elections, and submit to the drmlgory of iaithlul Paihimentaiy sei mcc, no must choooo tho best fiom amongst tho men w horn wo eau got 111 the light of thou pi omiso oi good iuith and abiht, another of the resolutions-o 10 that wns mo\ ed*~proposed that tho S3 nod should exprès«, the opinion that "it is the dut», of tho Government, lepresont mg a pioles*edly Christian people, to take the ndce^saiy stops to prohibit, for boi-ur ago Duiposcs, tho muuulacture, liupoi ta- tton, anti salo ot all kinds of alcoholic liquois " Hero, again, theio was evidence ol that disiogard tor actual conditions winch sooftouiomoie3 wholoaoiuo restituât fioui tho actions or tile i»olds of woll meiiniiig men It is not tho function of the Svnod to dehuo the duty of tho Legis latuio in any cuso But, in snjing that the adoption of tho ptilicj of prohibition vv is the duty ot the Government, "ropio honting n piolessedlv OLmatiun people," there would have been an inilnect assettion that ti 0 prohibition policy wus part of tho Christian luith It tho lcsolution hud been pio-eod«-d with, tho icsult would ha\o boou to show how muuy professedly Christian men, oiou within tlio Si nod, wemld reject such a doctunu as that " Tho Synod, in passing such a resolution, could not have spoken for tho Uhuich it ol'icially lepnsonts, and it coitainly would not huvo íepiesonted Ulis " professedly Ohnstnu " community It vis not wise to introtluco suchaieso lution , but when it had been intiodiicod, it wns \ oil thnt it wns quietlv put aside 1 he ícsolutiou relating to tho commci cial depicssion was also, doubtless, the outcome ot a deep sense of thosuhoiing causod by the piesent conditions of hniiico mid trade and ot a fenlin^ that something shoull bo d mo tovvaiilj obtuiniug rchot But would not a li tie considcitition have ohown that our Qovoinmont would bo out "stupping its piovinco ia pioelaiinintr dijs lor humiliation and pia^oi?

tho influonco of her surroundings, ohoerful, affectionate, hospitable, nnd clevoi- mainly in her manipulation of tito piano Tuither, it may be rumaikod that this is a woman's cnticiam of women, and

ludy which in somo respects may sooin io loud colour to what her cntio has to say about hor The favourable conditions of our Aus- tralian climate lend themselves to that, and this is a circumstance of which the Australian gul, to her credit be it said, is not slow to take advantage She walks, and rides, aim pla} s tennis, and lives a healthy hfo m the open air as much as possible, and there is a flank candour about her vi Inch scorns pnit of tins open-air hie, and which is by no means ho}denish or incon- sistent with refinement of manner or deli- cacy of sentimont Fioui those conditions sho

the idea of equality is a note ot her ohnrictor, it is pint oí hor broez} entouragi, and not in tho least unbecoming It muy be that the doiects of these qualities also begin to enow themselves m a cet

Perhaps thero is some truth in the argument that the Aus- tral nu girl of tho present is moro clov or tiiau íutelloctual-which is another way of anying that her natural talents aro better ti an her opportunities lor cul tin o, mid that sho is accomplished lather than highly educated But we aro coirectiug that waut ovory day, nnd although our present pubho system I of hnrhoi education ior gula is only about ten years old, we have , good íesulta to show for that time ' Ia en thoso who cling most strongly to the thooiy that gula should not boovorodu I cited, and so unhtted, as it is sometimes urged, foi their future duties ns wives and motiléis, neod havo no very 601 ions objections to this It is I probubly truo that tho weakest point ' about tho troiumg of Australian women hitherto has buen evidenced in tho extent to which it has appnientlv loft thom without mental rosourees It has boon lomaikod that the Australian gul of the piosout does not dmplay hei inothoi's talent or taste for hoiwewifoly duties, as a rulo, nor is sho in the samo degree open to the soothing and humaras mg ínlluoiice c1 religious exorcises A table andaptitudo for ltitollcctunl puiauits havo not yet taken tho plnco of thoso, and it Austialian home life so far is char ictonscd by one noticoablo want, it is easily placed by following out tho con sidoralion lierosu^rgtsted After marrmgo a woman is largoiy dependent on her own incut il ícsouicob, and if bhe havo none to fall back upon tho caso is a sonous ono for heisoif, her family, and hoi home In tho second gouoiatiou the cousequouces of such a stato ot things will be ineoinj arubly worse than in tho hi si, and undet such unli ippy circumstances tho Vustrnhan woman ot the futuio would have nothing but her own activo youlh uudhetlthy habits to picaoive her fioin i lulling into tho condition of tho Bomb.

Tuero are other capable musicians in the community, as there are in the other colonies, but it is not mero locuhsm to say that some of the performances of the Phdharinomo Society under Signoi Hazov were worthy of the most renovvnod musical cent-es of Europo, and if m those oratorios the assistante of a Patey, a Toll, 01 a bautloy was the eminent attraction to some, the support which the principals received from eonauctor, choir, and orchestra was admirable, and actually enhanced the solo vocalist's success It is the recollection of these aohioveinonts and the respect to the port which tho conductor pin} ed in thom which make eo many hope that the committee of the Philharmonic Society ma} bo able pre sently to announce that Signor Hazo-ï has resumed his baton, and the roheuisal of some important work has boon undertaken Another question of musio has been brought up anew for discussion b} a letter from a correspondent It is asked why some steps are not takon to proouie the playing ot a military baud in a tit} park on Saturday attornuous It is said that there are five bunds attached to the pubho forces, and partly supported by the pubho funds, one of which coqs could play in the Botamo Gaiden or the Domain upon a Saturday afternoon m lotition It may be that tho propoition of cost of these bands borne hy the State is not as gi eat as appears to the correspondent, and, whether that be so or not, tho fact has to be admitted that the Naval Bngudo band occasionally plays m pubho, as does a mihtuiy band in the Botanic Garden upon a weekday afternoon But the bulk of those who would enjoy the performance of a good baud cannot attend upon an afternoon in the week, and a week-night performance has not been found successful, it is probable that if anv arrangement could be made by which one of the bands attached to tho military or naval forces might play in a suitable pubho place on a Satuiduy afternoon, it would be appieciated by veiy many people us a delightful enteitiunment the uitempts mude in S}dnoy to furnish opon air musio have been many, but unsuc- cessful Why, it would bo hard to sny Men thoughtiul of tho wellboing oi the community admit the value ol î ublio amusomouts, o± which few aro eo unexceptionable as mihtaiy music Huudieds ot small centres in the couutnes of I.uiopo posse s their bands, which play to the public in places aud ut tunes wheu most of the poople can hear them Heio, with a cümuto w Inch almost compels people to rtsoit to tho open au, with abuudunce of eentiul re orves, with leisure ior tho ouj0}uiout of military music, und tuste loi it, one might think all the circumstances pointed to tho omplo}mont oi the | bunds in the way suggested by our coi respondent In Melbourne, last summoi, evening conce-ts wore given ou tlio cricket ¿round and woro iairly sue cossful, showing that people have an inch nation to hear mubio in the coolnc-s und iieshuess of the open air when economy also is studied Air M'Mjllan some wooLs ago pro¡ osod that the paiks should be lloodod by night with electricity, and bands should play, m order that peoplo might be diannout ot tue streets and fioiu their crowded homes lins may bo a counsel ot perloctiou, but as a step towaidh its roalisatiou lot us hu ve a good baud to pluy reguhuly in one, it not moie, ot tho public reserves upon a fine afternoon weekly, when peoplo could attend with thuu families, us Coutuieutal iolK do lho man who did so much loi tho îutionil onjov ment ot old and }olino;
