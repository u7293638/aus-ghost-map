AMUSEMENTS. I " HAMLET " AT THE GARRICK. I Mr Walter Bently made hisfirst appearance at the Garrick Theatre as " Hamlet " on Saturday. The new impersonation is characterised by tho clearness and simplicity of the conception in which the reflective nature of the Prince who loses himself in labyrinthian thoughts is kept in the background. Thus tho play, which ha3 heen called a tiagody of thought, became a tragedy of action, ana thoso successes with tho uudienco which follow each other so rapidly ivhero tho actor reids tho part on dramatic lines, and hal tho talent to maleo lus points effectively, wcio readily gamed by Mr Bontloy on Saturday Not that it is to ho mfcrrou that tho new Hamlet is noisy or " robustious ". Mr. Bentley everywhere plays with tact and scholarly reverence for the great Shakesperian part: but the impersonation is unde- niably moulded upon popular line, and it becomes evident that the actor has endeavoured to render more than usually intelligible to the everyday mind that almost undecipherable spirit that in its despair sums up tho complex difficulties of life in the words, " Ihero is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so " As it appears to us, an idoal Hinder- ing of tho choraotor should lea\o tho ques- tion of Hamlet's madness undecided, Binca »..hakospooro does not doflno lumsolf upon tho point, but Mr Bentlay's Pnnco of Denmark is plainly rational Necessarily, in such a rendering much of tho poetry and glamour of the play is lost, but this is less noticeable thnu might bo imagined, owing to tho mau} qualifications for tho part pos- sessed by the actor He h 13 a dignified presence and a pleasant voico his elocution is Bound, Ins gos tures are appropriate, and ho dre«sos tho part per- fectly It, thoroforo, some of tho subtler shades which Bhould gi\ 0 high distinction to tho character nro wanting, Mr Bentley g uns, on the other hand, hy tho aided forco vt Inch appears to belong to any great part m which the moro obvious dramatic effects uro adroitly mado Tor tho actor 13 thoroughly at homo lu the character, and tho aud euee aro mado to feel it Tho npplausio on Saturday testified to tho judgment shown by tho arti«t in adapting his style to tho temper 01 the houso His reception could scarcely havo been moro cordial Many oí tho great speeches wero íeceived v> tth ringing cheers, and tho actoi was oven catlod beforo tho tooth-Jits after tho cm tain had fallen for tho last timo All this enthusiasm waa wolcomo Tho gallery was uncommonly noisy on Saturday, but most pooplo v,ho wish then country w eil would gladly put up with such demonstiations c 1 dol ght every wcok if made m so good a causo It 19 a pleasure to heal tho pit and gallery applaud bhnki spcare's splendid veiso, and bowover fiimlmr ?hat verso may bo, tho mind is freshly lost m ninazo mont at tho noble beauty of tho luios at overj now porfoi manco It could bo -wished that loss ot tho tc\t was Bac-ißcod in bringing tho play within reasonable limita, but that is im- possible Mi Bontloy'« acting version 13, we think, highly effective lha wholo of tho first Bceno, in which tho ghost appears to Horatio, is omittol, and with it Bonao or tho poet's marvollous description of tho morn " in russot mantle elad ' and ono misses the scone in the third act in which Hamlet speaks his parable of tho pipes, and whero Polomus sees tho cloud that 13 ' -,ory liko a whale " But Ml Bentley's version plays closely, aud it is, Horn another point of view, surprising how much of the tragedy is sot out within tho spaco of tinco hours, or rathor loss, occupiod by tho poiformunco It may bo added that Mcssis Gust and Vaughan havo painted some good scenes for tho production, notably thoso of tho lamparte, and that, except for tho lighting of tho staL,o, about which gomo ludo c sion was shown, tho rovival went smoothly As already stated, Mr Bontloj had tho nudienco warmly with him throughout tho play Generally speaking tho minor (lotails, tho "business" of tho character, wcio thoro adopted by Mr Irving Of couiso, for the most part Mr Irving morely followed tho traditional readings of his prcaccos'ois, hut ono notow ortliy nistauco m which he did not do so- m "Look hero, upon tnis picture and on tins' '-has com- mended itself to Mr Bontloy N o pictures on tho wall aro pointed to by thn actor, no miniatures aro drawn from the breast All is left to the mind's oto-ns inauy will think to the dis nduintngo of tho Bceno It is in tina mtorviov hctn cou Hamlet and tho Quccu that Mr Bentley is at his best.

The young actress, blue-eyed and with fair hair, looked tho charactor in her white, gold-fringed robes. The impersonation was not strong, but it could boast a certain girlish freshness which pleased, and in tho mad sceno, which was of unequal merit, the first exit, with its buist of foolish laughter, was dramatically effective.
