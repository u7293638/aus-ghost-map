Cubatr Flibtation — Woman is the greatoentrifugal force of clerical life. . If his coat and his talk cut him off from the aympathy of men, they open up to the curate a (sympathy ' which' seems to more thp compensate them for the loss. Society, which fetters him by a thousand new laws, breaks down lor bim a thousand old -ones. The sternest mother relaxes in her precautions before the spell of a white tie, and the giddiest flirts soften, down into district-visitors. There is.indebd-a charm about a flirtation' with a curate jwhich few ; ordinary -flirtations possess. In the first' plac^jit is not merely ' wrohg,'' as all flirtations are wrong, but it has.Mahottt it the s*btie flavor of a speeial naughtiness.

Every volume of youthful poems, every gushing and romantic novel, every young crusader's trumpet /peal to alarm or awaken a sleeping race, is in reality nothing more or less than the private :iuid. authentic history of an egg. It is the orthodox way of relating sensations so .novel- and ao interesting that we think they can ifiever have happened to anyone else except ourselves. Nor is it :to be forgotten that it is.. pre-eminently one of the diseases of genius to ; see, magnified, as it were, into giant, dnnensions. and projected upon clouds like the shadow of the Bracken, all the little events of life, Beatrice and Frederika might have gone through life like any other worsen, .Tnit they met each of them a poet, who in vested everything he saw and felt with unnatural importance. And turned every ! ordinary event into a great picture' and 1 work of art. It is only, therefore, one ' of the frailties and vanities- of common- ! place people to make a -fuss over the : laying of their eggs.: The eggs that ' genius lays may he better wcHh laying, , but it is an undeniable fact that' the ' cackle of genius over it's egg is far the loudest cackle of all The anxiety to prove that our own egg is the one genuine , article, and that it ranks very high on the list of contemporary eggs, is a pas sion so prevalent that we usually, in dealing with one another, 'accept it and tnabe allowances for it As everybody has a fair prospect of getting his own egg lookod at in- turn before he. dies, it-* may be said, roughly speaking, that we are all °f us in the same boat.
