The Storyteller. MULBOONEY'S BANSHEE. By James J. Moran, Author of " A Deformed Idol," &c.; Terry Mtjleooney was a shopkeeper In Ballynagoppal; a low-sized, stout, forfcy year-ould man, wut a very red face, which raiched its highest tint at the tip iv his nose. A snug little man, who' ped half price for what he got, and charged double for what he gev out, an' intinded by this manes to ' build up wance more the fallen fortunes iv his line. For Terry was the descindant iv a fine ould Irish family, the Mulrooneys iv Connaught, who wor chiefs ah' princes before iver a Norman set fut on the soil, an' almost before Noah's Ark was invinted. - A family that niver bethrayed their oounthry or demaned their name, an' always kept their banshee. An Irish family, be it known to yeh, has no greater title to rispectability or antiquity than their banBhee. They may lose their possessions, as the. Mulrooneys did whin Cfomwill kem; they may be reduced to poverty,,the bare idea iv which would make a church mouse lie down an' die, as the Mulrooneys wor; they may lose the O, as the Mulrooneys did (for they wor wance the " O'Mulrooneys of .BaUymulrooney but :as long as'they keeptheir ould pride an',ould thraditLonS the faithful banshee sticks to thim to the 'last, and turns up whlneyerwan in the line is about to die, to vint her m^odious keen in the back yard. Terry, tX til fed! in his liW an.' was proud of his ancisthry.
