^ ? : Sfeitcteb § oetrg. WITH NATURE. Oft have I joined the reverent bending throng That fill out churches with their prayer and song, And fceard the solemn service float along ; Yet felt bo influence of the Eternal there. The breath I breathed was only common air. Oft have cathedrals wrapped me in their gloom, With shadow pillar and with ghost- like tomb. While altars rolled their chants, their rich perfume ; Yet felt I not the Eternal Presence there. The circling wreathes were still bat scented In forest valleys I have dwelt alone A summer's day, where, mildly overgrown, Ihe boughs -entwine, and moss conceals each stone ; At morn in idle mood I laid me there, At eve I wandered home with awestruck air. And I have paced beside the unbounded sea In gaysome humor, light and gay and free, Till a deep voice grew audible in me — A voice I cannot hear where men repair, Yet grows with lonely sand and salt sea-air. For hour by hour a subtle influence steals, And deeperiB inward till my spirit feels, In those dim fastnesses it ne'er reveals An all enfolding Presence whUpeting there. And thoughts flow deep that words may not lay bare.
