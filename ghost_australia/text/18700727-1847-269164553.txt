Gra contemporary, the Kampden Guardian, in his issue., of the 19th» having treated the-public to a leading article upon the subject of its own wrongs, and the hemousness of the crimes of the Western Press proprietary; and although, during the six months currency of the Guardian it has been a rule with us to let well alone, and say but little concerning him, obeeiving the §maxim that enjoins people not to touch pitch for fear of *>eing defiled, we shall, for this once only — unless any special ^circumstances rule otherwise deyote a portion of our _space to the exercise of a Briton's privilege—not -of defending -ourselves against tbfe attacks of-the-Giwrdiani for that in vtery -truth, would? be aisheer .waste.of time,ink, and paper—-but, asOUT bubble- blowing contemporary-w^/jhaveus-femerge from our shell on the subject of Ml Vrohg-sufe! ing and our wrong-doing, to offer a few wcfcdauffenl^ for lftg|gic£<?ptance or igel||l wio read *"""this, 1 * in " the way"of^e3:f>lanation ~ to tlie why acd ^herfFore.5 of the :8 dirt-th» ing, straw-split- ting,and persistent mdde of edit6rial% Ashing, whicht , i commencing with his prospectuB In December laejE;, and finishingvf^ith his leader-of -the isHi instant Jgas oefen "the selfe-vident and ruling characteristic Vf his^ glorious " career, "elevating popular^ laste and' feel' ing," and,-giving people stronger meat than tliey*had been accustomed to teceile at the hands of the editor of the Western Press. "The very fact of the Guardian being (to-use hjs own- words) " reluctantly' compeHed to hold over the Ireport of the Police Court proceedings at Terang," ko. 3 may be accepted as pr°crf positive that tie editor of that paper thought it of far greater importance^ to givepg the benefit of several inches more of his valuable space than the Terang, police report would have occupied, and it, was oxceediSgly »Mnd and generous of him'to act from impulse prompted by a desire that his readers should be made aware that '.tbe Press was guilty of piracy,and " whose vitality is at so low an ebb that it is compelled to rely upon a rival for support." Having given our contemporary credit for deal- 1 ing with Jfeas. being better game, and considering us more profitable sport than his Terang readers whoj.but for th&Press; would have been doomed to wait until the 22nd for the appearance of a- report of^ their Police Court 'proceedings - we now deal with our contemporary in a way which as yet we have not taken the trouble to deal »with him, viz., on J his merits, pure and simple, which as stated, in our issue of Wednesday last would not have been resorted to but for his consummate impudence in asserting that we live by plracy^and rely upon him for our support. Passing by the circumstance that the Hampden Guardian is the chicken that has been in process of incubation sinte February, 1867, under the hands of the same operator who nowwields the editorial peri^attd" who,joined ;at length bygone of our owrs compositors, and provided with the :neccBsary means by a fortunate lliga#e tow build Up and co m P]f*e in 1^70 an^engine which was commenced in the early part of 1867^ we would ask our. editorial friend to consult his dictionary for the true meaning of the word " piracy,the construe tionofthe term " reliance," for his doctrine evidently is that if a man endeavours to cut the ground from under the feet of another, he is quite justified' in preaching about piracy., if the ground so filched should not turn out to be as pro- fitable or ae smooth:.o^x)s^siih as anti- -temfted'£roial:^ar : ri«»ai~;cduMe of selfreticence ou the subject- oi Guardian versus Press but from, tie, c/rcumstance_ that our contemporary, has from the first pursued a course which every honest man, from;the;seriest h»ckster to:the ?merch'aht prince"must dfenoucce as being' the veryreverse of legitimate- tradibg, and although on the one'hand we have little to,do iWith, the .mode, adopted by ,the p'residing genius and moving spirit of the Guardian, office* in conduetihg-^pus business, yet, on the side of fair pla^ we now challenge him to deny that his motto has been—^ get support-; honestlyl if you can; but get it." We are a^re certainly, that it is unnecessary so "far as" the Guardian is concerned to. hint^t these matters,.which the par% himself is cognisant, and but for his unwarranty able, attackupon .us». he n^ght stilf pursue—as doubtless he will—the course, that has hitherto been his chosen one^f but in the interests of truth, and in sup- ,port of the one good old principle and, maxim that " Honesty is the beet policy"' though it?8hould suffer occasional defeat, and sustain loss iii cbnsequenc^we^nay | he allowed to state that our paper, being a means of livelihood, rwe object to the Guardian or any other- public journal copying our auction and trade, noticesmerely for the xak'e u -show," and' if | our contemporary^cries^ name'^ we say why clip columns of advertisements from. the " Western PresB" or any other jour-J nal and ninsert them without even the ghost of-ar 'ehance of ever being remu-" nerated for so doing.

In conclusion we may e|,ate that *he " Guardian" may live*upon its wits, and perform a hundred kind offices forMistant medicine vendors m>r local tradesmen without payment; it may distribute itself gratuitously in some directions where it is not required, and charge the advertised figure where it is; it nir.y give three months' insertion of a business notice gratuitously rather than be^- without it, as it has done, and we will say not one word again<t,it; but it will be as well, perbaps,if the editor of that journal ^ttend-s to his o*vn business by supplying local news,*1-atlier than insert^)iumn after column of "dummV^dvertisement and, at the same time avere ring in consequence of an® unusual pressure upon his space, hesls compelled; to hold over " lermg- police news,'* " a report of an inquest at Mortlake"— rather an important matter; c.-rtaialy and; "g|iher matters of local interest."
