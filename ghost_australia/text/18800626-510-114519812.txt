When Ponn was about to found a town in America, he chose fo-' its namo 'The City of lirotherly l-ove.'

There ib Ruggy Jack, Murrurnbidgee Whaler, A Boy from tho Bog, and. even a Wasp. Methinks editors must be short of matter when theypublish such thrash. The Wasp will oven try his hand at poetry. All that can be said for bin poetry is that 'tis on a par with Nimi'tybollo. If Good Ternplarism promitcs loyo and friendship among the brethren, it seems on Manaro to have an opposite effect. TakeNimi tyljeUe for instance. Before the Good Templar's Lodge was opened ic was never heard of; now each and every one seems to bo intent on annihilat ing tho other. St. Peter's Church, too, appears to bo an eyesore to a good many. They think 'twill never be finished. Wonder it the wish is father to the thought? Rumor hath it that a storekeeper ot Manaro, who is a leading member of his church, has such little'regard for the law that be sells his customers ' a drop of the craythur ' by the 'single bottlo, and is not averse to selling things on a Sunday. Surely this must be false. A lawmaker cannot bo ft lawbreaker. Besides, a 'gentleman,' and from his standing in the church, would not do such dirty tricks.

I auo by the pro posed expenditure' that a sura lias -een set apart to pay the assessors. This after overriding their work and thus making out they were incom petent. Considering the great ex icriencc both assessors possess, one as an auctioneer, the other as a builder, it 'speaks something for the ability or assurance of the Coun cillors to find fault, but then it is only what was~ expected.

Strange in general if one we like . well leaves us for only a short time we feel sorrow ; yet though Tiickett is one of the most popular men in Australia, it is with a feeling of uni versal satisfaction we read of his departure.
