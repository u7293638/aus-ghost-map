Parliament is summoned to meet on the 8th. of February, which is about the usual period. 'Thus the question of an extraordinary session is set at rest. The new Earl of Derby has been spend ing a few days with Mr. Disraeli at Hugheuden Manor. Mr. Bright has appointed Mr. E., Stanley Jones, son of the late Air. Ernest Jones, to a temporary clerkship in the Register-General of. Seamen's Office. ' Scotland has .just- lost her premier Earl, by the death " of Lord Crawford, who sat in the House of Lords as Baron "YVigan. / T-he"Archbi3hop of Canterbury is stated to b;e gaining strength daily.

Pea body. The Pope has conferred the Grand Cross of Pius IX. upon Lord Petre and the Earl of Denbigh. . The Government have consented to the request of the Archbishop of Canterbury for the appointment of a suffragan. The " confirmation" of Dr. Temple as Bishop of Exeter took place at Bow Church,- London, on the-8th. The oppo nents of the prelate-elect put in their threatened, appearance, but the Vicar General dismissed their arguments as in valid, and confirmed Dr. Temple without hesitation. . On the'21st the new Bishop, with two other new prelates, was conse crated in Westminster Abbey. Several Bishops had sent in protests against the act. _ On Wednesday, Dr. Temple was en throned in Exeter Cathedral. Nearly 39 I years had passed since . a similar ceremo nial was witnessed in the city, and this, after the controversy which the Right I Rev.

" : _ The death of the Bishop of 'Manchester places the seventh episcopal mitre at the disposal of Mr. Gladstone, his previous' appointments having been: to. the sees of' Winchester, Oxford, Exeter,' Bath' and' Wells, Salisbury, and Carlisle.' The Judicial; Committee of' the Privy. Council gave judgment in the Mackono-, chie case on Saturday. "According to,the judgment of the Lord Chancellor—him self a High Churchman—the conduct' of the reverend defendant, had been; any thing but creditable. He was ordered; last, year not to elevate the paten and chalice above his. head, He has since elevated them to the level' pf his head..; He was .ordered not to burn candles on the Communibn Tables ditfihg .the c3le-: | 'bratiqu. * He now keeps" the\candleS: lighted until the celebration-, when he puts them out ; but ..he, has alarge num ber of other, lights burning all tlio time in front of and about the Communion. Table. . Lastly,: he was ordered, not to kneel down before ' the consecrated bread, and wine. He now,accordingtohisown statement, 11 reverently bends one knee, which.may occasionally touch the ground." The Court decided -that,: whatever might;] bethought of the two first evasions, Mr. Mackonochie had literally fulfilled--the law, and nothing could be done. t But with regard, to the kneeling, it was ad judged that he had not complied with, the monition, and that he must be again; admonished and bear the costs of the proceedings'. The split in the ' Irish Church is gradually widening; The "laity.. insist upon having a majority of votes in the new governing body ; while the Bishops are equally obstinate in declaring that they will sit as a separate order, 'with the power of vetoing the proceedings of the Lower House. -The laity "urge that ;tk6» policy of..the Bishops'- would giye the priesthood unlimited p'o wer. The Bishops", on the oilier ]hahd, state - that they will : take no further part, in the Convention till their claims. are recognised;r :To two; deputations which recently waited on him to urge'u^on .the Government .tha advisability of introducing a 'Bill into' Parliament for the removal. of; University tests, Mr. Gladstone, replied that there were three points on which he was. agreed" with the memorialists : First, that the time, had arrived when this question ought to be settled by some legislative] enactment" ; second, that it. should be by a compulsory and not by a permissive, measure; and third, that it should -be?*' made a Government measure. He could not, however, give any specific promise at present that the Government. would introduce a Bill next session.. m-h On the 7th inst.,'a meeting of the' members and... friends of Bloomsbiiry Chapel was held, in tbs Hanover-'square.* Rooms, to celebrate the twenty- first ahni-7 ] versary of the opening. of thit chapelv; The event of the evening was a -presenta^ tion to the Rev."

The decease of HerRoyalHigh-. iness was rather sudden, though from the nature of the disease, this: kind of; death was not unexpected. - The Irish Land Bid of the Govern ment will be based on the Ulster . jus'tom. ' i , . ,.v -.While the Athencmm declares with much positiveness that the Government "; will deal with the Education- question" mext session, the National. League have laid before the country the draft of their proposed measure. ; .Qn.e.of;its..main.prqT]| visions is that all National Rate. Schools. to be established under the new scheme, and existing schools carrying out the principles; of a Conscience Clause, are to receive a grant, of tworthirds :their total expenses from the Consolidated t Fund. In the case of National Rate Schools the : remaining-third will be raised by a local rate.- The compulsory 'clause * requires11 that all children shall attend .• school from six to. fourteen years of age,' subject "to the" "provisions of the Factory Acts. In respect to the religious difficulty it is provided that in existing schools under Government inspection religious teaching shall be given at a disr tinct time, and attendance not be com pulsory. In the national rate schools the Board is to be empowered,--' to permit the reading of the Scriptures' in; the . schools^] provided that no child shall be present at such reading, if his parents ibr-giiaiv dians disapprove; that .the time for giying such reading be immediately before "the commencement or immediately after the ordinary school; business ; and that it be. so fixed that ho child be thereby in effect excluded, directly Or indirectly, from the other ad vantages which the. school affords.'.' The Directors of Oyerend, Gqrhey and Co. are,, after .a trial..which has oc cupied nine days, acquitted of the charges" of fraud brought against them. The Lord Chief Justice occupied four hours in his summing up, and the Jury took; only a quarter of an hour-to consider their verdict.
