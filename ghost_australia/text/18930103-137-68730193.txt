TWi: t Ils Wfeo's Clairvoyant Presolenc. Cost Ilmus. Almost everybody in and abont Chi enago knows John Dowlirg Well, ii was in 1888, I think, and Derby Day ai Washington Park. Before Dowling left the races his wife said to him: "John, you remember you promised to invest $500 for me on the Derby, don't vou?'" "Yes, dear," replied the husband, 'What horse shall I put it on?" 'On Silver Cloud, please." "Silver Cloud? Why, you're crazy. The horse hasn't got a ghost of a show." "No matter. I see by the papers there is 80 to 1 against him, and I have a presentiment he'll win." John argued, but to no purpose, and finally promised to fulfil his wife's be hest. He didn't do anything of the sort; got into the betting ring and plunged heavily on the favorite. Result: Silver Cloud won in a rush, and very easily. Dowling kicked him. self, cursed his luck and was generally unpleasant to himself -.ld his friends. But he dare not go home and tell his wife the chance he had lost. Hebought her a $15,000 house, deeded it to her, and to this day Mrs. Dowling thinks the property became hers through her clair voyant prescience in betting on the olcnomenally long shot.
