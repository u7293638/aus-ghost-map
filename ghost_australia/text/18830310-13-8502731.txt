PICTURES OF rtUVSL. HEIDELBERG, BASIN, AND THE ST. GOTHARD. It may be doubted whether there is any man north of the Alps, or of the Pyrenees, more roojeBtic or imposing than the Castle of Heidelberg, and its position is unrivalled. If its site was selected, as tradition reports, by Lewis the Severe, who married into the house of Hapsburg, in the second half of the thirteenth century, nature must have gifted him with an excellent eye for the picturesque The situation is one which may be fairly called enchanting lace platform upon which the immense structure has been erected rises almost abruptly from the beautiful valley of the Neckar and while this Howe at a depth of 330 below the richly wooded range behind the castle rise to double that altitude, and frames the venerable runs, when viewed from the town below, in a luxuriant mass of foliage for the declivities face of the intervening; slope is also masked with trees, so that the massive towers and stately galleries of this lordly pile seem to rise out of and to tower above the billowy leanness of an extensive forest But on ascending to the castle You find that its area is on the same scale of magnitude as the vast edifice which has been reared on 90 commanding an eminence You pass from terrace to terrace, from courtyard to court yard, from balcony to garden, and from garden to gallery, continually discovering fresh prospects to admire without, and renewed demands preferred upon your admit son, by the sumptuousness of the architect fire within Like the Chateau de Blois, to which it bears a distant resemblance the castle at Heidelberg was erected at three or four different epochs J he Ruprechtabau on your left, as you enter the great court yard, dates from the early part of the fifteenth century, and was evidently constructed with a greater regard to strength and solidity than to elegance of design On the opposite side is the magnificent Otto Heinrichsuan, erected in the middle of the sixteenth century, and offering one of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture, before that Style had undergone any variation or corruption which it would be possible to desire. Every window frame, pediment, pilaster, frieze, pillar, cornice, spandrils, niche, and pedestal is ornamented with the daintiest sculptures Statues, medallions, and arabesques contribute to the enrichment of this beautiful fur ide, and yet there is nothing redundant or meretricious in these elaborate decorations flies seem to form a part, and a necessary part of the structure itself, which would suffer by the detachment of an portion of its lavish overlay and they harmonise with it, whilst augmenting its beauty and deepening the feeling of regret that so precious a work of art should have been devastated by the French in 1884, and br up in 1693 as also by lightning in 1704 The Friedrichsruh, of which the inner facade confronts you on entering the ischtosaho/, while the outer one looks down upon the river, was erected half a century later, and is connected with the Otto Hein rich abau by three arcades, rising one above the other. It is more ambitious in design than the earlier structure just described, and is adorned on one side by sixteen Statues of the Electors of the Palatinate, but while the ensemble is grandiose, the details do not delight the eye, as in the previous instance At the east and west angles of the castle are the (licAe 1 but in and the great angler 7 tuns, respectively.

The transition from Heidelberg to Basle, from Germany to one of the German speaking cantons of Switzerland, offers nothing remarkable by way of contrast, but presents, on the contrary, numerous points of resemblance, for you find the same style of civic architecture prevailing, the same type of faces the same ingenuous expression of countenance, the same homeliness and simplicity of mesh nets, the some kindly or respectful greetings the same language, and the same troops of sturdy little apple - chocked children, with satchels on their backs, wending their way to or from school Most of the houses have double windows, as a precaution against the severe weather to be expected as the winter advances, and for the same reason the (lower beds in the gardens are thickly covered with fur branches Nearly all the inns have carved signs over their doors or porches, and in the shop windows you miss the elegant articles and the tasteful arrangement of them which make it so pleasant to loiter along the streets of any large French city. The butchers' shops are invariably glared, and are ornamented, not as imortably, with large pots of my and other evergreens There is a Great Bille and a Little BhbIo, the one separated from the other by the Rhine, which is crossed by three bridges, and is majestic in 169 volume even at this early stage of its career The Mu 1 ster, or cathedral, occupies a commanding position upon its left bank and the new from the contiguous cloisters, looking down upon the river and across to the mountains, is very fine.

Among earth's things of loveli- ness," observed Michelet, " we recognise two as perfect and peerless In the Lake of Geneva, the beautiful-a noble and exalted harmony in the Lake of Lucerne, the sublime " The epithet is well applied, for in the massiveness, the altitude, and the grandeur of outline of the mountains which dominate this great reservoir, and which plant their feet in the greenest of herbage, while they lift their rugged heads to the clouds, there is an element of Bublirmty which is heightened by contrast with the softer beauty of the curving shore, where the water runs into the land in sinuous and ever-varying lines, and each little mist or larger bay constitutes itself a luBtrouB mirror for the towns and villages, the villas and cottages which stud Hu books, while the sun lights up the snow that lies in enormous masses upon the heights until its dueling effulgence resembles that of polished silver exposed to the radiance of a cloudless summer noon. Then comes the Lake of Zag, discernible afar off, and looking in the distance like a highland turn, but giving Lack grand reflections of the majestic mountains by which it is surrounded. As you approach it and Skirt its romantic shores you perceive that the snow comes down to within a hundred yards of its placid margin and that every place in the forests which crown all but the loftiest heights looks as if it had been thickly sprinkled with the whitest and most delicate of swan's down Traversing a broad valley, under the shadow of the King, on one side, and of the Rossberg, on the other, the railway winds round to Biunnen, charmingly situated on the lake of the Four Cantons From thence to Tluellea, at the southern end of this arm of that superb sheet of water the line follows its indentations and where the mountains nee up from the very edge of the lake in gigantic walls of naked rock, and afford no ledge or crevice upon which it has beonfoundprac ticable to lay the iron track, the train plunges into a tunnel to emerge from it in full view of a splendid panorama, founded upon the opposite side of the blue expanse below by another wall, the stupendous nurses rj of which is stained and furrowed by innumerable cataract When the darkness of an artificial cavern suddenly blots out one admirable prospect a few seconds suffice to reveal something equalling or exceeding it in beauty and tins rapid succession of bright landscapes and of black blacks is not without its special compensations for the brevity of the glimpses you obtain of scenery which it is tantalising to see disappearing at the very moment you were endeavouring to photograph its leading features on the slides of your mental camera Quitting the lake at Huellen, you ascend the valley of the Rouse to Altorf, grass is g ravines that have been bridged by lofty viaduct, penetrating the buttresses and spurs of the majestic mountains by means of frequent tunnels, and as often climbing up their rugged sides by ¡ng life of amazing coat and difficulty. Grunt cliffs of bare brown rock, tufted with trees, the russet foliage of which, still lingering on their sapleSB branches, contrasts effectively with the purple of the pine forests below the line of snow, and with the virgin whiteness of the glittering peak and pinnacles above, frown down upon you upon the one hand, and angry torrents rave and roar at a great depth beneath your feet on the other. The roofs of the chalets, more solidly constructed than those in the lowland regions, begin to be weighted with heavy stones, to prevent them from being dislodged by the wild fury of the wintry winds, and such orchard trees as contrive to maintain a precarious footing in the ungenerous soil are gnarled and contested by many a strenuous wrestling bout with the icy blasts that come swooping down upon them from inaccessible fastnesses in which perpetual winter reigns Looking back from Amateg, where an old and weather beaten keep conceals the ravages of time beneath a mask of ivy, a magnificent vista opens out, comprehending the whole valley of the ReusS, from the point of view to its outfall in the Lake of the Four Cantons, with the towns of Altdorf and Lratfekl chequering the green plain with their white churches and houses, and the Schaclienthal the Axcnberg, and the Trohualp lifting their enormous forms on the right, while the spurs of the two chains which culminate in the Sudetenland, and the Urirothstock begin their ascent on the other Thence forth the route to Giachenen lies through a succession of tunnels and galleries, and is carried along a series of cornicBS, from which you look down upon incessant changes of romantic scenery There is quite a rapid succession of deep gorges and gloomy ravines, at the bottom of which impetuous torrents foam at depths which render their roar inaudible Those are fed by innumerable cascades issuing from the cliff like mountains which approach each other more closely as the train scales the steep gradients of its ascending march until all further progress 01 cr the magnificent barrier interposed by he St Gothard becomes impossible And here, at the entrance of the great tunnel, where you halt for dinner, the congealed vapour is falling thick and fast, and nothing but snow, or an impenetrable curtain of cloud is visible in any direction The children who bring rock crystals for sale have purple hands and crimson faces, and it requires a certain amount of courage to quit the well warmed carnage and to venture through the ice and slush to the buffet The passage through the tremendous fire" by which the Alps are perforated at this point occupies 20 minutes, and I found the atmosphere by no means so unpleasant as that of the underground railways in London In fact, there must be such a displacement of the mr occasioned by the transit at a considerable rate of speed of a large body like a long railway tram as would be necessarily accompanied or followed by an inrush of the outer atmosphere, so that in all probability the vital medium is at any rate partially renewed as often as this violent disturbance of it takes place When you emerge from the tunnel at At ole you find yourself in the midst of a superb entourage of mountains, with a clear and deep blue sky behind them, and one tooth like ridge literati) burnished by a ray of light falling on its sharp edges Green torrents of wonderful transparency come tumbling down the rocks through which the railway track has been blasted, and are often shot fired into a " 1 Thousand we re the of dangling water smoke, That like a broken purpose waste it air All the Springs and streams flow southward, and there is even a touch of southern soft need in the air From Airdale the railway descends the valley of the Ticino, the river flowing at the bottom of a stupendous gorge, walled in in one place by cliffs between 200ft and 300ft high and over all there towers the majestic form of Mount St Gothard, robed in a mantle of dazzling whiteness, and girl round about by other mountains clothed in their stainless winter garments, "white, mystic, wonderful -here lies what some one has called " the centre of the great hydraulic forces of Europe, ' sequestered in a solitude sublime " Fra duri mind appeared Ove di corso demand NeftBun vo81Il,1o b1 Rendova improver In its descent the railway describes a double curve, like the letter b, so that the same panorama is presented to you under a variety of aspects, and a town or village which has sparkled like a grain of salt, ' when seen from a distant eminence, is visible in all its piclureBqtir-if sometimes Shabby details a quarter of an hour afterwards. As you an preach the borders of Italy, the names of the places remind you that you have left German SS ireland behind you, and that you are in an 1 tallon speaking canton, while the reappearance of the mulberry tree and the trellised vine is a pleasant assurance that you are entering a blunder climate, The aspect of the villages you pass is also changed The campanile replaces the bank tower and bulbous cupola, the stallion gives way to the inhabitants, and the (panic it vine is the substitute for the bushells Even the sun, which rises so late and retires behind the mountain tops while the afternoon is still young, retains something of its summer warmth, and its rosy light lingers upon the snowy eminences facing the west, as if it were enamoured of their beauty and their purity, and loth to leave them, while the atmosphere of vapoury purple that Gils the darkening valley) via of a richer hue than any thing of the kind in northern latitudes Piotta, Biaschina, Giornico, Bianca, and Osogua are passed, and Bellmzona is reached The train passes sufficiently long to enable you to observe and admire the remarkable picturesqueness of the position of the town, and after a long descent the iron road ascends once more as it enters a labyrinth of mountains lying between the head of the Lago Maggiore and the Lago Lugano Between Giubiascoand Cadenazzo you overlook the whole of the lovely valley through which the Ticino leads its waters to the former lake the mountains upon either side dwarf into ridiculous dimtnutiveneea the towns and villages at their feet, and the last rays of the Betting can rest with such a gro nous effulgence upon the ridges of the higher Alps that they seem to annie back both a benediction upon and a benediction to the departing luminary And when it deep peace, the whiteness of the snow changes to a steely blue, and veils of vapour envelope the lateral valleys Driving through a somewhat lengthy tunnel there are no less than sixty between Basle and Milan-the line of railway enters a valley at Bironico, traversed by a stream which finds its outflow in the Lago di Lugano, and follows its windings, with an occasional plunge into the bowels of the earth, until it reaches that lovely sheet of water, which it skirts for some miles, then crossed it at a point where its breadth contracts considerably, and still bugs its margin as far as Capolago Lights sparkle at many points along its sinuous shores and the purple of the starry heat ease and " the patches of bright gold by which they are engaged are faithfully reflected from its smooth expanse The out lines of the mountains detach themselves with more or less distinctness of relief from their background of sky and as you poor out into the dantening landscape, the fantastic REspect which all objects assume affords plenty of play for the imagination to give shape and substance and texture and colour to that which the privation of light has rendered so indefinite
