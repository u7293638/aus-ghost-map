SERMON BY THE REV. T. COOKE IN THE CENTENARY HALL. A service conducted in connection with the sessions of the Wesleyan district synods of "West and East Sydney was held in the Centenary Hall, York-street, last evening. 'The Rev. Thomas Cooke selected as his test the 5th verse of the 1st chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, and dealt with the divine power Christ promised to his disciples to conquer the world for him Power to the Greek meant poetry and eloquence, to the Roman process and faculty to rule, with the Jews it was signs and wonders : but in the text- the Gospel-it meant the influence of the Holy Ghost The" original disciples were not assisted by culture, eloquence, social influence. It was such plain preaching as Peter's sermon on the day of Penticost-a example sermon for all time when thousands were saved, and the power of that sermon was simply the Holy Ghost's power. The present-day argument, if the work of God was not prospering, was " We must have among cultured ministry, better singing. and make the services more attractive. " That was wrong. They tried to substitute human gifts for supernatural power. Most Churches began in simplicity, but no human gifts multiplied there was a tendency to forgot the Divine. At the close of the Lord's Supper was administered to the members of the synods.
