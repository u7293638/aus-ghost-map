ACCOUNT OF AN EYE-WITNESS. Mr. John Piper, dyer, of Hyde Park, who saw the whole of the affair, claims to have been the means of separating the Premier and Mr. Sparks. "I was proceeding through the square," he said, "and I saw Mr. Kingston and Mr. Boothby walking towards the Post- Office. Suddenly Mr. Sparks, whom I did not recognise at first, for he was wearing a little cap, which is most unusual for him, appeared on the scene, and approaching the Premier from behind dealt him a blow near the left ear, with what I thought was a stick. The blood immediately spurted out from the wound and Mr. Kingston appeared quite dazed. He turned round, however, and 'went for' Mr. Sparks. Mr. Boothby for the moment seemed dumbfounded and thinking that the assault was a most cowardly one and that the Premier had been taken at a great disadvantage, I got between them and was really the means of stopping the affair. I said to Mr. Sparks, 'Well, you have lowered yourself,' and he replied 'Yes, I have.' Thereupon he hailed a cab and disappeared. Now if it had been a fair hand-to-hand fight I would not have interfered, and should have been amused, though I think Mr. Sparks is in better trim for that sor of thing than Mr. kingston; but to see a man stunned in that way—it can be called nothing but 'cowardly'— raised my anger. Mr. Sparks's usually ruddy complexion was as white as a ghost's. Mr. Boothby seemed so surprised at the affair that he took no more action in the matter than Hercules in the square, but seeing as I did the whole thing from the start it made my blood boil.
