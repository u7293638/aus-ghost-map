TO THE EDITOR OF THE LAUNCESTON EXAMINER. WATER WORKS. Sin,.-I I perceive that by theo draft of the Water Bill:" l.Civis" -has heen ' frigltelied .from his proprlety", again. The ghost of the cliquq is presepted to his troubled inmagination, and he,has involked the potent aid of the Chronicle to lay the spectr . The efforts of the Chronicle,.for that pnrpos, have been incessant for a series of years. Undehhis kind attention the eliqiue hai attained a mature growth, and has Toiig consisted of all tlie wortli and intelligence ofour local community. A petition, it appears, is to be presented to the inhabitants for signature, praying that the sum of Â£2000 may he granted for carrying out Major Cotton's plan, which has, already, been almost unanimously rejected by the people of Launceston. The folly of the government in relinquishing that plan, when so near completion, was self-evident. The effort made by " Civis" to have it carried ollt, after the works effected have been suffered to go to dilapidation, is as foolise as it will prove to be ineffective. Surely, if we are ripe for mulnieipal institutionls, the whole matter ought to be left in the hands of the local corporation. It is Inot likely that tile choice of the people wouldl fall upon men less competent than " Civis" him self, who has displayed more " zeal without know ledge" thlan wisdom in the history of the Lasunceston water works. The scientific reptita tion, of his friend, Major Cotton, is an affair the public care nothing about.-Your's, Onsetaven.
