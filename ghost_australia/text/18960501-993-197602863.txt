W l t M I W Q T Q f f . , WEDNESDAY, Aprii 29. Ihe election passed off very quietly although feeling ran pretty high with some. Every party worked well for their men and were resolved to get them in if there was a ghost of a chance. Mffhere is now a great scarcity of feed for the cattie and farmers do not know what to do with tbem ; I bear of some shooting the poor and weak. If this weather continues lone hundreds will have to be destroyed or wiu die for want of food. Mr S. Geoise has left his farm with about 80 head of oattle in search of food; others are going to follow suit, they say if they stop here the cattle will die and if they go in search of feed and cannot find m« any it if will «,;n be no worse. An exciting bolt.—A pair of horses attached to a buggy, the property of Mr J. Schuppan were standing in front of Mr Dignan's factory and as the whistle was blown for the men to start work, it frightened the horses. Mr tichuppan managed to get hold of tbe reinB at the same time making an attempt to g®t into the traps but his foofslipped" rffthe horses took np the street at bolting pace with Mr Schuppan in this perilous position. To get into the trap was impossible, to let go might be fataL Mr Pavy seeing the position Mr Schuppan was in, managed to get near enough the horses beads, as tbev were making straight for 1 a tree gaanL and turned them a little, Mr Schuppan took the advantage of this, let go his hold falling heavily to the ground, he was taken into Dr Pickering's surgery and it was fonnd that nothing serious had happened beyond a severe t-haking to the system and a brased head. The horses continued in their gallop, being turned and re-turned, but no one oould get nttr enough to get up in the trap to take tbe reins, bnt the end can)e by them running into a tree. One of tbe'horses'went cl^an away nd the other repawned at the pole. Nothing P broken bpt the swingle Uvea and tome ther work.
