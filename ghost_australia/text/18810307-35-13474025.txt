PRESENTATION TO THE LATE COUNCIL I OF EDUCATION. On Saturday morning, about two hundred of the officers and teachers employed under the Education Department assembled at the Temperance Hall, to present to each of the gentlemen who were members of the Council of Education a valedictory address The text, which was the same in every case, was surrounded by a very delicately drawn border, done in pen and ink, by Miss Harriett Scott, who worked Australian flora and fauna into an elegant frame- work, remarkable for its accuracy and exquisite finish Each address was well framed, and its artistic appearance, no less than the graceful terms in which, it was couched, will no doubt cause the recipient to prize it Shortly after 11 o'clock Mr W Wilkins, the secretary for education, took the chair, and beside him on the platform were the Hon Professor Smith, M L C , Sir G Wigram Allen, M L A Sir Alfred Stephen, M L C ; the Hon Robert Wisdom, M L A , Mr. "W A Duncan, Mr John Davies, M.L.A., and others. Mr Wilkin s, in opening the proceedings, said that it would be in the recollection of those present that after the passing of the present Public Instruction Act a meeting of teachers was held, he thought in the month of May last, for the purpose of deter- mining in what way those who had served under the late Council of Education could best and most gracefully take leave of that body on their retiring from office "V various plans were proposed, and it was finally resolved that the most appropriate course to be adopted was that of presenting those gentlemen with, an address an address which should make clear to them the feelings entertained by the great body of teachers who had served under them of respect, and regard, and kindly feeling for them (Applause) For the purpose of carrying out that object in a way that should at once be pleasing to the members of the Council and credit- able to the great body of teachers, subscriptions were invited from all who had been in the service, and the appeal was responded to with so much liberality that they were in the pleasing position at the present moment of having that stupendous thing called a surplus, which they did not know what to do with the task of preparing the address was confided to Miss Scott, and he was sure they would say that she had performed her task with very great artistic taste They were now met to complete the work initiated last May, but presenting the addresses to the gentlemen for whom they were intended This would probably be the last opportunity they should have of meeting the late Council of Education as a body, and it only remained for them, after presenting the address, to say farewell He was sure they would do so with all the kindliness they possessed, and that they should perform their duty to their successors with the same zeal and fidelity which they displayed in the service of the Council of Education (Applause ) He might remark that the committee had intended that the Minister for Public Instruction, who had promised to be present, should perform the presentation, but from a letter which the secretary would read they would see that Sir John Robertson had been unavoidably prevented from coming He had only one other remark to make the Council of Education was now defunct They had neither hope nor expectation from them for the future, and what they had done now might fairly be considered a purely disinterested manifestation of the feelings they entertained towards that body (Applause ) Sir John Robertson's letter and then the address were read after which five young ladies carried to the different members of the late Council the copies prepared for them These copies come only as distinguished from one another by the illuminated monogram at the base of each and as the presentations were made the recipients were heartily cheered the text of the address y, as as follows -"to the members of the Council of Education, the Hon John Smith, M D. , LL D. , C. M. G. , M. L. C , President the Hon Sir Wigram, Allen, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly , William, Augustine Duncan, Esq., the Hon Sir Alfred Stephen, C B , K.C.M.G., M L C , Lieutenant Governor the Hon Robert Wisdom, M P , Attorney-General Gentlemen,-. We, the officers and teachers of the department of the Council of Education, desire, now that the official connection between the Council and ourselves has ceased, to express our high sense of obligation for your never-failing kindness and consideration towards us in the respective positions we have held in your service We thankfully acknowledge that in the performance of the patriotic task of administering the affairs of the department you afforded us every reasonable encouragement to co-operate heartily in the work of primary education, and to carry out your instructions with zeal and fidelity and that while you sponged your time and comfort to secure the success of the great purpose you had in view, 600 readily gave us every necessary help in discharging our duties While retiring as you do from your high office, accompanied by the approbation of the country for the probity and disinterestedness which you displayed in the exercise of your functions, we trust that you will accept f 10m us this expression of our respect and regard, together without sincerest wishes for your continued health and prosperity On behalf of the officers and teachers, we have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your most obedtentservants-YV Will ins,beeret iry, A L Forbes, Assistant Examiner J M Credie, Inspector ; George Miller, Chief Clerk J Wright, Training Master, W H Johnson, Head Masterton street Model School 8th May, 1880 -(the date when the address was drawn up) Professor S tim, who was the first to respond, rose amid loud applause He said -Mr Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen -When I look around me and see my old colleagues, Sir Wigram Allen, and Mr Duncan, and Sir Alfred Stephen, and Mr YA i don, and Mr Y\ ilkina piso, who served us so well, it seems to me that the dead-end burned and all but forgotten Council of Education has been galvanized into life again or is this a spiritualistic seance, with your chairman as the medium, where its ghost has been conjured up to speak and be spoken to for a few minutes, and then to vanish for ever The members of the late Council have not all met together since we sat round that well known official table in Macquarie-street, and when we separate to-day it is not unlikely that we may never all meet at the same time again AY ell, it is because we formed the Council of Education under which you all once served that you have kindly asked us to meet you to day, but many well-known faces around Me impel my thoughts much further away than the times of the Council, and I doubt not that Sir Wigram Allen and Mr Duncan are also wandering back along the silent shores of memory to the times of the National Board, when we used to sit together in a small room at the Fort-street Model School to a time beyond the recollection beyond the lives even-of many here present, for it is twenty-eight years this month since Sir Wigram Allen and I were appointed on that Board, and Mr. Duncan joined us a few years later. The National Board recalls the names of Sir C. Nicholson, and Mr. Plunkett, and Mr. Holden, and Mr. Morehead, and Mr. Butler, who laboured with us so long and faithfully in the cause of popular education. What a change has come over the schools of the colony within the range of our experience! In the beginning of 1853 the National Board had the care of barely 50 schools, and the office staff consisted of one person, Mr. Avails, who had the occasional assistance of an accountant to keep the books straight. At the same time the Denominational Board had about 170 schools, some of them very small and the total population of the colony was about 210,000. Then when the Council was dissolved last year it handed over to the Minister 1265 schools, with upwards of 100,000 children, the population of the colony being about 750 000. The growth of schools, you see, was considerably more rapid than the growth, of population for while the schools increased nearly six-fold, the population in the same time increased only 30 times. I am not going to say anything more about the labours of the National Board and the Council further than this, that it was the privilege of these bodies to preside over the seed-time and early development of that system of which the present generation is now reaping the fruits. I trust the system will continue to expand and improve. It cannot fail to grow rapidly under the golden shower of unstinted liberality which it now enjoys ; but I trust the old traditions, so far as they are good, will be preserved, and that you will not rashly remove the old landmarks. I had some fears when the change was made. I may confess to some fears still, but I shall be glad to discover that they are not well founded. Let me, however, on this occasion simply express an earnest hope that our cherished schools may never have the fresh buoyant life crushed out of them by the remorseless jaws of officialism, and that liberality of expenditure may never degenerate into such extravagance as might cause a revul- sion in popular feeling towards unwise parsimony. But the time has come to say farewell, and I am glad the office staff, and inspectors, and teachers have given us this opportunity of taking leave. We have got over the pain of dissolution long ago, and I now enjoy the sense of relief from much hard work. For a time it seemed strange to me that I no longer had to haunt the Education Office and when the weekly bag full of papers ceased to come to my house its accustomed corner looked deserted ; but I have got used to the new state of affairs, and am thankful for the comparative leisure I have gained, it is pleasant to think that we part on good terms, and with mutual respect. I thank you sincerely for this address. I value it as a token of goodwill and friendly feeling, and all the more for its beautiful setting-a work of artistic genius, which makes a picture as pleasant to the eye as the sentiments of the text are grateful to the heart. At the close of the great civil war in America, when General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court-house, his brief farewell speech to his men ran in these simple words-" We have fought through the war together ; I have done the best for you that I could." Looking round now on the veterans of educa action here present, may we not say that in the perennial warfare against ignorance, and the rude barbarism of undisciplined youth, we have been fellow-soldiers for many years Near are part company. From us there is required no more active service in this field ; but you have still to uphold the fight, and carry onward the banners of knowledge and culture. We will watch the campaign. Our warmest wishes with sympathetic interest will go with you, for your future welfare and success and my last words on behalf of the late Council of Education are-" We did the best for you that we could.'" (Loud applause.) Sir G. AVigham Allen said he had thought that, its Professor Smith was their chairman, he would have been their spokesman to-day; but he saw now that each member of the Board was expected to say a few words. His would be but few, for he cordially concurred in every word the Professor had said. He reciprocated the expressions contained in the address, and he thanked them very heartily for the handsome and artistic presentation made to him. (Applause.) Mr. Duncan said that in what little he had done during the last forty-two years in the cause of public education in this colony he had merely followed the bent of his own is I-. ' *-?---1 clinations, and his desire to promote the public good, without an j view to reward or recognition by the Government, the public, or the teachers At the same time it would be untrue to say that he was insensible to public approba- tion, and especially to the approbation of gentlemen who were specially qualified to form a correct judgment The teachers of this colony were to-day a very different, body of men from those that he found here in 1838 with out ignoring the rule ' the. motives in nisi bonum" and might fairly be said that they were, with few exception . utterly unfit for their positions, and that they were paid at a rate quite in proportion to their qualifications In 1853 he commenced, in a newspaper which he edited, to write down this state of things He said We must have qualified teachers, and, to secure them, we must pay them well " The three-halfpenny a-head system was thus doomed He continued the war till the national system was v usually established In 1844 he was examined at great length before Mr Lowe's celebrated, committee, and he was afterwards elected by a public meeting (together with Mr Lowe and a few others) a member of a committee to urge on the establishment of the national system In 1846 he discontinued his newspaper, and went to Brisbane, where he delivered a lecture, and held several meetings for the establishment of the national system, which ultimately was accomplished After his return to Sydney he accepted a seat on the National Board, and later, as they knew, he became a member of the late Council or Education, on which he remained till it was dissolved by Act of Parliament He thought that the gentlemen who had been his colleagues on either Board would admit that in all that he did at these Boards he was actuated by a desire for the public good, and they would specially admits that he never lost an opportunity of giving his voice for ameliorating the condition of the teachers and officers serving under them In recalling these facts, some of which belonged to a past generation, he confesses that he took some pride in his forty years' labour on behalf of the youth of this "colony and their teachers, and it added greatly to that pleasure to find his services and those of his late colleagues so well appreciated by those whose professional knowledge best qualified them to form an opinion on the subject. He heartily- thanked them for their splendid testimonial (Applause ) Sir Alfred stephen, who came forward amid applause said he had not been aware that any address would be expected from any of the members, but thought that the duty and pleasure of replying to the very handsome and gratifying memorial presented to the Board would be under-) taken, as it had to-day been ably performed, by Professor Smith, their respected chairman Being the youngest member but one of the Board they would, he hoped, it indulgent to a young speaker (Laughter) It was very pleasant for them to be assured that their services in the cause of education had been appreciated by those whom it had been their desire in the first instance to serve not for their sakes alone, but for the rising generation, and the community generally They had always felt this that the body of the teachers were to a large extent, and that all ought to be, a uni y or sal body of ladies and gentlemen Then position should be, and should be felt to be, quite equal to that of the still higher body of teachers the clergy of the colony (Applause ) He might say for his colleagues that the same feeling actuated them throughout and the community would acknowledge that they could not have had a better class both of male and female teachers than the e w horn it had been their good fortune to secure. Not only was is the endeavour of the Board to raise the character of the teachers but they tried to study their, interests He was glad Parliament had given to the Mines ister for Education powers which were refused to the Council of Education-the power of taking land essential for the establishment of a school-a power which they had asked for, but which it was thought undesirable to give them a hair late Pi evident had said than he had had some doubts, and retained some still, as to the effects of the change He himself had not the slightest doubt that Sir John Robertson would feel it to be his duty to act on the lines laid down by the Council of Education J but he had no hesitation in say ing that he did not think the change would be for the better (Applause ) He did not think the teachers would have their interests looked after so well as under the Council of Education With all respect to those gentlemen who talked about constitutional maxims, and took from the Council their powers, he was not influenced by the opinion that it was a constitutional maxim that it was better to give power to a Minister open to all kinds of officialism, than to a disinterested Board Nor did he hesitate to say that in the administration of funds entrusted to them by Parliament for the purchase of land, and the like, they had exercised as sound judgement and as independent decision as any Minister of the Crown could exercise He thanked them very much indeed for the address they had been good enough to present to the Board (Applause.) Mr. Wisdom said that, as the youngest member of the late Council of Education referred to by fair Alfred Stephen, he begged to thank them for the address Although he was but a short time a member of that Council, he should always feel that he could never occupy a more honourable position, and he could conceive of none where they are could be for better and more useful purposes As for the change, he was never one of those who advocated it, but he did not share the gloomy anticipations of Sir Alfred Stephen as to the future of the Education Department - that was, he felt that so long as gentlemen like Sir John Robertson were selected for the position of head of the department, teachers would never hay c to four being treated with less impartiality than under the Council of Education. He thanked them most heartily for the very beautiful present they had made him (Applause ) Cheers were then given for " The Queen," "The Late Council of Education, " The Minister for Education, and " The Chairman, and the proceedings terminated
