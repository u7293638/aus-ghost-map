IN the Legislative C i el j yesterday) A petition was presented by Mr llicttAuusoN in favour of the Matrimonial Causes Bill, so that there was a provision to prevent subsequent marriage The Sun ding Orders were suspended on the motion of Mr DAieiti for the purpose of intr ducing R bill for the incorporation of the Goulburn Meat Preserving Company Mr DOCK. it opened the adjourned debate on the Matrimonial Causes Hill and, after discussing the various proposed provisions intime ed his intention of voting for the amendment and against the bill in its present shape Mr ïiouiis 10 RTIT opposed the bill HB altogether unnecessary Mr DAM in supported the bill regarding it as a permissive not a c impels me, measure and while he respected the opinions of others, the bill would not offend them, as they were not compelled to have re- course to it Mr DEAS THOMSON supported the amend- near He then 1 to the bill unnecessary at present although some such legislation might be required hereafter He thought the most prudent course would be to let the matter stand over for the present Sir M M íhhMkO supported the second reading of the bill, desiring to issue that the law of this colony to the law of Li island, and not seeing as it was admitted to be a mere question of Um that such a measure should be indefinitely postponed, he regarded it as a social question only, and not as a religious one Looking at the matter fully in the face, he would adopt the whole bill, that woman should have the same rights as man and there was he believed, no danger of women unduly proceeding upon such powers Dr MA«AM.AME moved the adjournment of the debate until the next sitting day) at of the motion for adjournment was carried, on division, by a majority of 13 to 4 Mr GORDON postponed his motion having reference, to sentences in Criminal Courts and the Bank of New South Wales Bill was read a third time and passed The Council adjourned at ten minutes to 6 pm. until 4 p m on Tuesday next IN the Legislative Assembly, yesterday, Ministers, in answer to questions, said -That Mr Ashdown was appointed accountant to the railway department on 21st May), 1867, and £1000 security was given by the European Fidelity Guarantee Society, that within the last two months the mails between Wollongong and Campbelltown have been five times delay) ed by floods and that there has been a pro rata distribution amongst claimants on the Superannuation Fund On the motion of Mr Cowper it was ordered that the House at its rising adjourn to Wednesday next The Cattle Sale "Yards Bill was read a third time, and passed the House went into Committee of Supply On the vote of £2294 for the Timor Dry Dock, Mr WILSON drew attention to the fact that there was here a plant of the most valuable machinery in the Southern hemisphere, and expressed a hope that it would not be allowed to rust in idleness Mr SAMUEL said the Government intended to take steps for bringing it into use, and hoped to be able to devise a scheme by which the whole estEbhsntnerit might be leased After some remarks from Sir JAMES MARTIN, relative to the employment of convict labour, Mr COWPER, said that some arrangement would be made for employing certain number of convicts on Cockatoo Island The amount was then voted "Under the head railways, to be raised by loan, £120,000 were voted, the Secretary for Works with drawing the amount £1 248 000 for railway extension Tor harbour and river navigation £180 600 were voted for public works, £20,000 for telegraphs, £3000 , all to be raised by loan In the Postmaster Generals department £110 400 were voted for the Post Office, £3087 for the Money Order Office, and £30 881 for Electric Telegraphs In an Additional Estimate for 1870, £5048 11s 9d were voted for miscellaneous services, £5000 being for destitution, c, caused by floods On the vote of £2000 for expenses of a Gold fields Commission a long discussion ensued , first as to the advisability of such an inquiry, and next as to to so large a sum being required A motion to reduce amount to £1000 was negatived after some debate, by 20 to 16, and after one other attempt at reduction, the vote was agreed to for the Intercolonial Exhibition £2000 were voted and on the proposed vote of £2000 for preliminary expenses of a census, a very lengthy discussion ensued in which it was pointed out that in the present financial difficulties of the colony, when the Government were resorting to borrowed money in order to carry on the business of the country, it was a needless waste of money to expend this amount for a purpose of so little value The vote was defended as necessary for obtaining the data on which to base a ready estimate of the representa- tion. The amount was carried by 26 to 14 The vote of £2000 for a law reform commissioner was opposed by fair JAMES MARTIN, Mr S BROWN, and Mr PIDDINGTON, on the ground that the colony was not in a position to bear all these extraordinary expenses that the Government were seeking to heap upon it Mr Cow i ED insisted upon the necessity for law reform for which the people of the colony had long been asking After a lengthy debate the motion was carried. The sum of £1200 was voted for minor roads Progress was reported and leave given to sit again 'The House adjourned at three minutes to 12 until 3 o'clock on Wednesday next THE agricultural gang system in England has assumed gigantic proportions in a few years, while in France there has been a gradual subdivision of land, so that peasant proprietors are the rule, and farmers. with capital the exception. In England, a great change has removed almost entirely the peasant class, except as perambulating workmen, from the fields of the Eastern counties of England, such as Lincoln, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Norfolk, and Suffolk Men but little above the ordinary labourer become the masters of gangs, consisting chiefly of lads and girls, women and children These last are often from seven and even the years of age to twelve or thirteen The master of the gang is the only person with whom the proprietor treats These are taken out to work from six to seven miles, sometimes a foot The work contracted for is thus accomplished by a combination of labour, skilled and unskilled Large breadths of land are rapidly tilled, and one hundred persons sometimes are employed together When the work in one place is done the) are hired in another direction The payment of their wages is left to the masters of the gangs and the owner of the soil, satisfied with the performance of the contract, hands ever to him the stipulated sum The workpeople no longer live scattered over the rural districts, but in large rural Villages Their employment is more constant, and better paid than in former years, but the innumerable auxiliaries to subsistence which a careful family obtained heretofore are less accessible Every thing has a money value, and coin is employed in the exchange of every) thing This 6) stem partly arises from the use of machinery in agriculture, which requires the cultivation of land in large farms, and leaves long intervals when hands are not immediately required Agricultural Society has to adopt itself to the new system, which may, perhaps, hereafter admit of many beneficial changes. Meantime, however, it is said that the effects, both moral and physical, are disastrous, which certain measures are intended to remedy Children of all ages were exposed to an inclement climate If overtaken with rain, they had no effective shelter They had to become inured to the fatigues of wasting journeys The per tons under whose control they were placed were often gross, rapacious, and demolished the temptation of wages induced parents to send their children unguarded into the fields 'J they were often exposed to all URge of every land The gang system had thus many of the evils of slavery. Pre- cocious Mee as well as premature decrepitude Viere the common results, and the clergy and other philanthropic classes uttered loud protests against the moral and physical sacrifice of the poor. As an example of the proportion of these gangs in one district, they formed a total of 698 males and 1887 females Amongst the first there were eight children below seven years of age, 562 below thirteen and 398 norn thirteen to eighteen years, and only fifteen miles above that age. The female workers comprehended four children below other years, 471 from seven to twelve years, 496 girls from thirteen to eighteen years, and 443 women above eighteen years Our leaders will remark that of the adult persons employed in these gangs the greater part are women. The growth of these evils induced the British Go on ment, some four years ago, to issue a commission of inquiry. Their report supplies the facts which we have given, and the recom- mer dations which they have made will probably abate the end so far as it is possible to do so. These have deprived the young children of the advantages of school They have thrown together youth of both sexes, so as to promote their demoralisation, and destitute of all influence of a higher kind connected with their labour, they are exposed sometimes to a pernicious control, and sometimes to a dangerous liberty. The witnesses upon this inquiry suggested, and the commissioners approved their suggestions, that the gang master should be licensed, and that he should be bound under penalties to certain rules in the conduct of his business. It is proposed to fix a minimum age and a maximum distance, to limit the hours to eight for children under twelve years, and twelve above that term It is proposed that there should be a separation between the boys and girls in the field of labour, and that these last should be under some respectable matron, and that half time at school and half time at work should secure to the children a degree of education. It is impossible that any nation pretending to humanity should stand by and permit the sacrifice of the senile population , but the evils of gangs are rather of detail than of principle It is possible that the collection of larger numbers within peasant Village may bring them within the moralising influences of the present epoch. It may be that an improvement in their wages will compensate for the loss of other advantages. It is possible that an extended system of tramroads may facilitate their transit from one part of a district to another. All this may be hoped, since it is quite impossible to return to the old system of rustic labour and rural life. The perfection of English manufactures has superseded cottage industries in England. It has stopped the wheel and the room in the I collage of the poor. Commons are i everywhere enclosed, and made to yield assistance to the teeming millions who would otherwise have a periodical famine It was the cottage industry of Ireland that prepared the way for the calamity by which the population was decimated. When we consider how rapidly population grows in England, and how vast the number of poor, [ it is perfectly clear that there is no remedy but in the frequent deportation of the surplus numbers there can be no room in such a country for people without capital, except as labourers, under some regimen which turns it to the best account When we consider the in mense regions open to the population of Lane pe, and the resources of modern science for their transport, can we doubt that over-peopled nations will assist in the dispersion ? It is indeed said that the upper classes are zealous of any decrease in number, and that they are opposed to emigration, because it may carry out useful hands-that, in fact, the value of their estates is considerably increasing, but they always comply with the expressed will of the nation. There are great problems working out with the new forces at the command of society, and it is during periods of displacement only that what are substantial improvements are felt to be injurious The organisation of labour- its concentration on a given object, its increased productiveness and certainty-must, in the end, benefit the whole people The old idea of rural life is indeed rudely shaken, but it must be recollected that rural life has long been abandoned by two-thirds of the people and the interests of these last is that these vast establishments for the production of human food may be able to produce it with certainty and sell it at a reasonable price WiMfeiLitiAi HESIGIS SIGN -We understand that Yes f ci day morning the Hon William Forster sent in his resignation of the office of Secretary for Lands Mr Forster has held office since the 27th of October, ISIS, and although he has resigned his position as a Minister of the Crown, he lost night occupied a seat on the Treasury benches THE EmMeTT -Last evening the Committee of Sun [lo ed Deluded the consideration of the Estimates in Chief, with the i Jicrptien of one or two postponed items and also disposed of the additional Estimates for 1870, as well as some further petrol estimates In the course of the debate the Colonial Treasurer announced that it was his intention to go on, next week, with the bill to amend the bar up Duties Act DniTATION 01 UNEMPLOYED TO THE COLOMAr fcLCHi.iAi\ About one hundred of the prompt j ed met yesterday morning only do Park, and, after pirnd ng Ihr of the are of the principal streets of the city, Ihi j proceeded to the Colonial Secretary's office, and some i their new ber were admitted to an audience with the Chief Secretary (the Hon Charles Cowper, CMG) Captain M'Lerie, the Inspector General of Police, was also present at the interview Representatives of the Press watered i!dimtted,\but it is understood that the deputation stated that IberpisSt large number of men now unemployed in and r about 8) ditty, and that among the number were SCO stonemasons, in a similarly unfortunate position It is also understood that the whole of the persons to whom they referred are in a state of utter destitution, and stand in need of immediate relief 1 be Inspector General and the Colonial Secretary appear to have, regarded these statements with incredulity, and a tuegcslK n was made that the names and occupations of the mu requiring assistance should be communicated to Captain McLerie to this, however, the deputation demurred but whether the refusal of ore from a misunderstanding of the purr vote for which the information was desired does not prior We believe, however, that Captain McLerie under- took the collection of the information, and that the Colonial Secretary authorised him to expend £10 in the purchase of BY up tickets, ' with a view to prevent any persons from actually signing. For DOCK-A meeting of the inhabitants of Five Dock was held at the Five Dock Inn on Thursday evening, the 14th instant, Mr Robert Murray in the chair, to consider the bad state of the Five Dock Road Resolutions were n ammon ly passed, condemning the manner of ex- pending the money given by the Government to the present trustees, and adopting a petition to appoint a new ttUfct.

My STFI HEN'S GOLD WASHING MACHINE -It appears that it was an error in stating that one ton of earth took thirty minutes to pass through the machine, whereas it should have been thirteen minutes JOURNAL OF A Tom or DISCOVERS Across THE BLUE MOUNTAINS In the year 1813, three explorers, Messrs. Wentworth, Blaxland, and Lawson, names well known in the Australian colonies started with the determination of crossing the Blue Mountains, and penetrating to the country beyond. To this expedition the people were indebted for becoming acquainted with the plains of which Bathurst is now the centre, for the intrepidity of the dis- coverers the Governor rewarded them with a grant of a thousand acres each, This expedition started in May, 1893 and, in November of the a time year, a surveyor named Evans was dispatched on a second visit over the same route It seems that the journal of one of the party, Mr G Blaxland, was published in London in 1823 , but so little interest was taken in it during subsequent years that it was not reprinted, or if so, to an extent Dot commensurate with its importance Mr John Blax- land starts in his preface to the journal that frequent in- quiries have been made for copies, and they were not to be had recently, however, he discovered a copy of the journal of his father, and has reprinted it. It is somewhat remarkable that this paper has not found its way into the works of some of the colonists who have at times given a short history of the progress of the country, such, however, is not the case The railway now passes over the most difficult part of the journey of the early explorers, and the impediments they met with are neither felt nor seen, save in the stupendous precipices that meet the eye as the train whirls past along the edge of which they forced their slow but eventful way. People who have not read the account of this primitive explora- tion will derive, we feel assured, both pleasure and later mation from its perusal together with the report of Mr Evans, attached as an appendix, who made a more minute examination of the country the price of the little work is sixpence, and it is to be had of all booksellers. WATERMACHINE ion WORXINO SEWING-MACHINES -It has been stated by a medical journal, that the constant action of working a treadle is injurious to the spine, and that women who use the sewing-machine are particularly susceptible to spinal disease In order to avert this (at least we will charitably suppose") various means have been adopted. In large establishments, where numbers of sewing-machines are used, the motive power for driving them is usually water. In Melbourne, for instance, the pressure of the Yan Yean Waterworks is sufficient for the purpose. One drawback, however, is felt in the expense which this constant waste of water involve, amounting to some thousands of gallons in a day two gentlemen in this city have invented a water engine, that may be attached to a house-tap, of one inch in diameter, and the force will be sufficient to drive at least a dozen machines with a comparatively small expense of water. The inven- tion is termed an " Aquarius," and is intended of course for light power. The engine, as before observed, is attached to a house-tap, and is composed of a man cistern or tank for a water-wheel to revolve in. This wheel is made as light as possible, mostly of wood, around the edges of which are a number of small buckets of galvanised iron, which are filled from the tap, and as they revolve by the force of water empty themselves into the cistern, a strap, of course, connects the pulley on the engine with the one on the shaft, and each sewing-machine is supplied with a fast and loose policy by which it is set going and stopped There are the usual concomitants of machine , but the man feature in the invention under notice is that the water is not wasted, but, by a skilful contrivance, IS forced back into a tank and, thus it may be reduced. This desirable result is obtained in having a small force pump attached to the wheel shaft, worked by an eccentric, the water passes from the cistern into a tank, and so much of it as the limited power will return is sent up the rest, of course, is allowed to flow off, so that the water-wheel may be kept free The cost of an engine capable of driving thirty machines would, we are informed, not exceed £30, and by a little attention, very slight repairs would only be required at long intervals, as the wear and tear is small as compared with horse or steam power. We believe it is the intention of the inventors, Messrs. Pryceand Roby, of 307, George street, to take out a patent. CHILD ACCIDENTALLY SurrocATEn The City Coroner held an inquiry yesterday, at the Golden Fleece public house, Castlereagh-street, touching; the death of a child named Henry White. Amelia White deposed that she was a roamed woman, and had been so for seven years, the deceased, who WAS her son, would be five months old on the 10th instant, he had been sickly from his birth, but had a good appetite, he had been under the medical boat most of Dr Gilhooley, who saw him about two months ago, between 9 and 10 o'clock on the previous evening (Wednesday), she went to bed, taking the deceased with her she was perfectly sober, she did not drink, she was in boil some time when her husband came to it, he was also sober, they were both teetotallers, she gave deceased the breast, the bed was also occupied by her little girl, who was about two years old, after suckling the child she placed it in bed, between her husband and herself, the child went to sleep with her breast in its mouth, she went to sleep, she did not recollect having changed her position during the night, she awoke at 7 o'clock that morning, and found that her husband had risen, she found that deceased was away from her, near where the father lay, and she thought that he was asleep, and went down stairs, the child was only covered by a sheet, she went upstairs again, and lifted the child out of bed, and found that he was dead Dr. Gilhooley deposed that he was called that morning to see the deceased, who appeared to have been dead for some hours. The appearance of the body, together with the history of the case, and the absence of any contr idea tory signs, enabled him to state as his opinion that death had been CAUsed by mph as from being overlain in bed, hoisted no marks of violence on the body The jury found that the child had been accidentally full jetted while in bed with its mother. FATAL ACCIDENT III DROWNING-On Wednesday evening (says the newcastle Cluonith), about 6 o'clock, a lad, named John Hoare, son of Mr Beare, cutta at the tailors g establishinent of Mr Ingall, of Hunter-street, was, we regret to record, drowned at the Breaker beach near the old gaol. The boy whose ago was about four teen years with a younger brother of his, an! a lad named M'Cook, were bathing on the beach, when suddenly a wave carried out Hoaro into deep water M'Cook endeavoured to catch hold of him, but finding that the receding wave was carrying both out, he was obliged to let go his grip of Hoare, who at once sank, and was seem no more The accident it was immediately reported to the police, and te instable Woods and another member of the force hastened to the bench, but darkness coming on, and it being nearly full tide, search for the body was found impracticable. We have been informed that House could not swim DREAM u ACCIDENT ON THE NORTHERN RAILWAY. -The Arncliffe Chronicle reports that on Tuesday afternoon about half-past 4 o'clock, a boy, named John LiWts, fired five years and six months, son of Benjamin Lewis, miner, residing at the Junction, was accidentally killed on the Burwood line The boy got on the tram at the Junction, where it stopped to take in water, unknown to the engine driver and shortly afterwards his father came home from his work, and was informed that the child had g ino away on the engine 'The father immediately ran after the train, and overtook it at the smelting works, where it stop ped The boy got off the train there, and whilst endeavouring. to save himself, the wheels of a waggon passed over his head, and he was instantaneously killed. THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT AND MR MORT It is reported e f course on the best authority (says the Queensland Times of the 7th Inst at) that an offer of £2500 has been made to Mr. Mort by the Queensland Government to let them off the contract for the sea going steamers, but that Mr. Mort at enH his mouth a little wider Why not make it £3000 of That would be only £500 a piece for each of the Ministers, and cheap, too, at the money. Let them take it up amongst them somehow, and no more about it. ATTEMPT AT MURDER -Last month, at Mr. Dines's, Tooloomba station, a quarrel took: place between Ah Loon, a Chinaman, and one Frank Price, who was engaged to herd the shearers horses, in which the Chinaman attempted to stab him, but falling in doing so, he struck him on the head with an iron bar, on which Price ran down to the other hut and asked the men to come up, which they immediately did. When Johnson asked Ah Lean what he meant by taking a knife to a white man, he immediately rushed at him and struck him with a knife on the thigh, close to the groin, burying the knife up to the shaft. He was at once overpowered and chained to the verandah post until the police came from Goondiwindi, and conveyed him to Warialda The man Johnson was conveyed by Mr Dines to Bogabilla, en route to Goondiwindi, where he was lying in a very precarious state. PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON CONDITIONAL PURCHASES -The Albury Land Office (says the Banner) was crowder on Thursday last by selectors who came in to pays interest on unpaid balances About another £650 was ra. ceived. Owing to the carelessness of many selectors, bid writing, and in some cases inability to make the particulars of their payment clear and intelligible, a vast amount of trouble is involved. It is greatly to the credit of the agent here that every thing has gone off smoothly in the receipt of interest from so large a crowd of selectors Next year about 30,000 additional acres of land will commence to pay interest at this office ' Son osEi) SUICIDE - On Monday (the Goulburn Herald reports) Dr Waugh held an inquest at the Star Hotel, Goulburn, on the body of Thomas Crossingham a saddler by trade, aged thirty five years, who had been found drowned in the Wollondilly on the previous day James Richardson, labourer, deposed that he found the body on Sunday in the Wollondilly near the willow trees in Taylor s paddock who know deceased and had last seen him alive about a month before, deceased was a collar maker and had been employed by Mr McAlister, he was addicted to intemperance Constable Wilson deposed that he received information that the body had been found, went to the place and found the body floating in the water, the face and front being underneath, with assistance he removed it, found only a pipe and tobacco in the pockets James Martin, bricklayer, deposed that the deceased had resided with him during the last three weeks the morning of the 5th he was suffering from the horrors, deceased had been absent from witness' house for a week but returned on the evening of the 3rd and seemed all right, witness was under the impression that deceased had been drinking while away Dr Hayley deposed to having made a post-mortem examination of the Lady , it was in an advanced state of decomposition and seemed to have been dead at least a week, the features were hardly recognisable, portions of the upper lip and cheek had been eaten away, there were no external marks of violence on the body, on examining the body internally sound all the appearances indicative of asphyxia, the smash contained a small quantity of fluid having a rintuouB smell, was of opinion that death resulted from drowning The jury returned a verdict that the deceased drowned himself while labouring under delirium tremens It is supposed that deceased has relatives at Echuca, or Ballarat. A SINAI E STORY -On the afternoon of the 6th instant, a whip snake, about three feet long, was killed on board of the C and R R S N Co's steamer Ballina, lying at the Grafton Wharf The Grafton Observer says the reptile was seen hanging on to the paddle nearest the wharf, and one of the hands descended on to the paddle and lifted it on to the paddle-box with a stick It would seem the poisonous thing was glad to escape from its novel position, as it hung across the suck very quietly while being lifted Not liking to trust the dangerous visitor, immediately it reached the paddle box another person knocked it on the head and killed it, thus putting it beyond the reach of doing harm It is thought that the snake came down the river with the fresh, or had been secreted under the wharf since the late Hood WILL ACCIDENT-An accident happened, on Saturday last say ; the Bathurst Times), to Mr Turner, tanner, of Lambert Street, which might have terminated fatally It appears that he intended, with the assistance of an old man, to descend a well at the back of his house for a set of grappling irons which had fallen down, and he had seated himself in the bucket for that purpose Just however, as he cleared himself from the landing, the chain and rope attached to the windlass, separated, and he was precipitated to the bottom of the well The alarm was immediately given, and, a man being lowered to his assistance, a rope was fastened round him and he was pulled out Although the fall had been about seventy-five or eighty feet, he was quite sensible when he was hauled up, but his legs and, arms were very much lacerated, and there was a deep gash in one of his legs, caused by the edge of the bucket when he reached the bottom of the well Dr M'Donough was at once called in, and Mr Turner is now, we understand, progressing as favourably as possible. A GIMINF SNAKE STORY -There are so many wonderful stories told of snakes, and encounters with them, that it is difficult at times to give credence to such tales, but one has reached us this week more wonderful than, ever, but it is authenticated by testimony which cannot be doubted ODO day lately, at Eugowra, the station of Hanbury Clements, Esq , Mr Blacket, the superintendant, i bec near two snakes lighting near ahavBtack-ono a black, the other a carpet snake The former, if anything, was the larger of the two, and eventually killed its antagonist, una then made off under the stack as Mr Blacket approached Mr Blacket did not disturb the dead snake, as be hoped the black one might steal out again, when he would be able to despatch it His snakeship, however, was too cautious, and, after waiting some time, Mr Blacket went away Next day, upon going to the spot, the carpet snake had disappeared, and a watch was kept up round the stack by four persons, so as to destroy the reptiles if they came out Eventually the black snake was seen under the stack, but out of reach. of any ordinary method of destruction, and it was consequently shot by a blackfellow named Jack Murray Upon pulling the snake out, it was observed by Mr Blacket that it had greatly increased in girth, and upon further exams D al ion something was noticed protruding from its mouth.
