. SELECTED POETRY. ' Vinliofl Tcnrx, When sho whom I lovod diod— Sbo whom I lovod full well, Bottor than lovo can toll, Mors than tho lover loves Ins untouched bndo— I stood boBldo her bod, Her faco was whito and cold j Her soft hair ahono liko gold, A pale gold fillet for her sacred head. I looked, but did not weep ; Only a dull regrot Shadowed my soul ; nnd yot Sho was gono— gono to tno unending alcop! Nay, and tho vory thought of her .Was dim, llko memory's ghost, As sho indeod woro lost, And ovon tho world boyond hold naught of nor ! My live heart beat unmoved, Though hers had coasod to beat ;I loft nor in tho atrcot I faced tho crowd, who know not her I loved, Tho dayn pass, and tho years 5 My beard is touched with gray ; I fool my powers decay ; ... And still I havo not found my unshod tears. But, O my heart 1 I know— I know thy timo will come. Whon thou, no longer dumb, Wilt break— wilt break and utter all thy woo ! To-day thou must bo stUl, For sin has hardoncd thco, And earos havo burdonod thoo, t And foilurechocked thy pulso with sullen chill. But whon my shadow is cast Eastward, at sot of Bun, And all my dcode aro dono— Or ovil or good— nnd tho dull day is post, And whon tho imprisoning years Shall fcttor mo no inoro, Thou opon wide thy door, : O heart 1 tho aeorot door of unshod tears ! This littlo lifo of earth, Theso momont-yoara of timo, Insult tho griof Hublimo Of tho Immortal soul, that waitoth for itn birth— Itn birth to that domain Whoro God nnd man nro 0110, WhoBO ovorlasting nun .Throws an eternal shadow ovor momory's plain. Thoro broak, O willing hoart ! Break, and at last ho froo ! No doaror liborty ' Ask, than to shea those tears that vouch God's human part I God gave man love nnd light ; Griof is man's vory own ; Nor would God's shining tlirono ' (But for man's godliko tears) ho half so bright !
