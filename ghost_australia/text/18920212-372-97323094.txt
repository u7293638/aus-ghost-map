AUBURN QUILPS asb QUERIES. By Paul Put. What has become of our branch of the agricultural bureau? They have meet ings, W6 suppose, bat does anybody see or hear anything of them but the members r Could they not take c. pattern from the Clare branch and its energetic secretary. who does aot let the ghost of a chance slip by without advertising the place and its i Auburn, and make the branch' a real live concern. Our Easter Monday sports are not to be a combined friendly societies'^ picnic this year, but Foresters' only. This is a pity. The old order of things could easily be maintained. Horse racing is likely to be added to the programme to make an extra draw. After &U; the agitation our working men'o blocks have been opened for application ai-i no one needed them. Thus the folly of fiurvevinsr land without hona fide annli cante being foithcooing. The same thing has occurred on other land in the district at Skilly, no working men requiring it. Oae time the Government got Â£-30 per annum from a neighboriug farmer. Xow the farmer gets the use of it and the Government nothing. How many farmers will plant vines and fruit trees this year, after they have again seen the foliy of depending on wheat ? What farmer in the district would feel the loss of time or money entailed in putting in five acres of vines and one acre of fruit trees this year, to be increased a lika quantity next season ? The Kercoonda Estate Company and the anterprising Clare gentlemen wbo have come amongst us will suielv give things a etart. The batter factory, too, may go shortly, since the price of factory butter more than doubles the price obtained for farm lots. Everything comes to him thtit waits.
