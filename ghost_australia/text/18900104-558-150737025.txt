AN" ASPIRATION. Whon wo have cut each other's throats And rohhed each other's land, And turned, and changed, and lost our coats, Till Progress is at stand ; When every "programme's "been gone through This good old world will wake anew ! When Science, Art, and Learning cease, As Wealth and Commerce die— Tho children they of Wealth and Peace, With Peace and Wealth they ily— Then Ghosts trill walk, and in their train Bring Old Roligion back again. When Hunger, War. and Pestilence Have run their ancient round : When Law lias long hnen banished hence: When Hate has cleared the ground : When men grown few as once thev were: Breathe uncontarainatod air. Till then I fain would sleep, and then Bo horn in other days, A Hermit in some happy glen Where some clear river strays: Nursed in some Faith—I know not, 1— Wherein a man might live and die. Ah, early would 1 rise to pray, And early would I steal From chapels in the dawning gray, To earn the Friday's meal— A Monk who never dreamed of doubt, I'd catch uneducated trout! A Priest where woman might not come, Nor any household care, Aland where Newspapers were dumb From scandal and from scare That Priest I'd l»e, that land I'd see, Would Fortune work mv wish for uic !
