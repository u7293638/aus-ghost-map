MISSION-SERFIOES AT THE CENTENARY BALL. I A ten-day' mission was begun yesterday at the Centenary Hall, York-street, by the Rev John Watsford, of Melbourne. A special preparatory meeting was held in the hall on Saturday, and was well attended three services, all of which were conducted by the Rev Mr Watsford, were held yesterday, that in the afternoon having been intended for and la i Roly attended by young people. On commencing yesterday morning's address, Mr Watsford said that he would take a very old text, but one which contained truths as precious as they were neither were first delivered and he prayed that God would make them a blessing to his hearers that day he Acts i, v S, they would find, I ' But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Those were the very last words spoken by Jesus Christ before He left the world. He spoke them to his disciples, but not to them only The preacher referred to the holy places which the disciples led, and to the testimony which they bore about Christ- and Christ's week. There was, he said, a great deal of preaching now-a-days, but, in his opinion too little testimony. People must witness for Christ everywhere not merely in the church, but in their homes at their offices, and on the trams and trains Wherever they went they should make others believe that they belonged to Christ The times had gone by when the laymen and when children were supposed to keep their mouths shut. Every member of the Church ought to be a witness for Christ As regards the sphere of their activity, they, like the disciples, should begin at home, but not stop at home They should begin in Sydney-and what a work there was before them in Sydney When he was walking to that hall that morning it had made his heart ache to see the people on their way out for pleasure, while so few were wending their way to the churches He could tell that the others were out for pleasure and it was just the same in Melbourne He referred to the millions of people in the world who had never heard the gospel, and concluded by emphasising the necessity for workers to Christ to trains the power ofttl√ÑolarGhort.
