A GIRL SOMNAMBULIST. i AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT. It is ratiier over twelve years ago since the present writer, then residing near the Flemmgton Bridge, at tbe extreme limit of North Melbourne, had an adven- ture wuna somnaDuiist. sue chanced to be a charming girl, about twenty years of age. The writer was on his way to the North Mel bourne railway station for the purpose of catching an early train. It was a bleak winter morning, and unite half an hour before dawn. A whice-robed figure standing right in the middle of the footpath, was a stupefying surprise. But only for a moment. A belief in ghosts is not the strongest part of the writer's faith. Moreover, it was. far beyond that " very witching hour of night when churchyards yawn." The white-robed figure proved to be simply the charming girl already referred to, who was out in the biting air of that winter morning attired only in her night clothes. She was fast asleep. An open gate, giving entrance to a back yard, indicated where she had come from. She yielded quietly to guidance, and, still asleep, was led back through the gate and up some steps on to a verandah. The house doors were shut, and to prevent the girl from wandering again it was necessary to awaken her. An overcoat was thrown over her shoulders, and she was cently aroused from her remarkable slumber. It is needless to de- | scribe what immediately followed. The I overcoat was passed out through tbe doorway ujr ftwcmuuag nanu, ana me writer leit. ile J neither sought nor learnt the girl's name, j and has never seen her since.
