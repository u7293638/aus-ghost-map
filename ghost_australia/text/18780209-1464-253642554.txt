9 Messrs. A. Morris & McElhone. (Vide Mr. HcElhone's motion for the appointment of an Executive Commissioner for Paris ExhibitonJ. Who says that old Mac's a curmudgeon, Who says he's a surly old bear, For ever in loftiest dudgeon, And wanting at some one to square? Pooh ! pooh ! if such libellous notien Were true about Jack McElhone, How account for the friendly devotion Which he to Gus Morris has shown ? They say, accidentally meeting Of late in a Waverley 'bus, That gushing indeed was the greeting Which McElhone lavished on Gus. That then to a merchant's adjourning (A genial purveyor of wine) , With a most unaccountable yearning Mac's phiz upon Morris did shine. They lapped up Chambertin, and oceans Of claret, and sherry with zest ; Then yielding to tender emotions, Gus wept upon McElhone's breast. He poured forth the whole of his troubles, His sorrows, his griefs, and his wrongs â€” His anguish each moment redoubles, His wailings still more he prolongs. He told him, too, how he'd been pelted With sarcasm, stigma, and sneer, And the heart of Jack McElhone melted, And down dropped a ponderous tear. 'Twas a tear that was larger and thicker Than any of yours or of mine, It was highly diluted with liquor, Containing more sherry than brine. But 'twas wrenched from a bosom's recesses, That ne'er knew emotion before, And which Mr. Punch freely confesses, He fancied was steel to the core. Then Mac. , he directed his efforts To soothing the suffering Gus, He poured forth soft whispers like zephyrs, As they sat on the top of a 'bus. And, as homeward they rode, with his hand on His friend's with a genial grip, Mac. swore by the ghost of Buchanan, To get Gus the Commisionership.
