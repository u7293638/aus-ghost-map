"BLOCKS." The acp'onnt's tyhich haye reached! us about the ' late'! rating, at -Sydney are. not tflieering to . the hackers of/horsea. It-fieems, iiflwe are> to credit what', we are told, that the two important races; the Derby, apdj'the, Metrqppj(itan, yfete not won oh .tlieir, merits. ,r.In the one. ""race, a hot'se wns- 'pulled, in the other "blocked-." j Few. people seem to understand how comparatively easy it is for a favoritetp be defeated, although he may be tho best horse, . ' ft the' owner and;the jockey cannot- be got at, " blocking" can bo resorted to" -Tho'' Ring .cafmot allow a heavily hacked horse to win, if it is possible to defeat him. A few thousands to the owner or a few hundreds to the jdekey are of- ho moment compared with' the stake the public would pull off if tho horse came in firsth and still less, sums of money distributed amongst owners of horses sent to "block," The public never seem to see this, yet it is plain enough for the most imbecile. Supposing that a horse has been hacked for £100,000 or more by the public, docs anyone think that the Ring would sooner pay that money than give £1000 — a moderate fortune — to his jockey, or £10,000 to his owner, or failing in that distribute £10,000 amongst "blockers " Whv the thing is preposterous. No confederation of business men — and the Ring is composed of very shnrp business men indeed — could allow such a thing. Why do we see a lot of horses who have not tho ghost of chance, going for. a race ? Why ? Need we answer the question ? In a great race a second is of importance, and if the.favorite is only " blocked" for ' that time, if he is hemmed in when _ he should make his " effort" the object will have been gained. Let the public take these remarks to heart, especially in tho ligh; of the late events nt Sydney. ;
