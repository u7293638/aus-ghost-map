The Caulfield Sleeting. fBT TBLBOBAPH.] By Nemo. MELBOTIRNfl. THTTftKn»v The Spring campaign will be fairly commenced at Caul field an Saturday, when there is every promise of large fields and excellent racing. Proceedings will begin with the Selling Plate, for which Kanaka looks about the most trust worthy, osiers the Ghost runs up to his private form. The Huidle 'Race is verv onen. tmft «v«n nnw it is hard to pick a certain starter out. At the weights, Bed Rover, Discount, and Merry Maid may divide the honours. The South Australian filly, Biz Bis, appears to be about the best of the rather moderate lot engaged in the Great Foal Stakes, and she may have most trouble with Amelia, Victoria, and Precious Stone. The Caulfield Guineas bids fair to be a great, race between Gutwwork, FrviBgpaii, Transferred and, Hecla, and if the firstnamed, who is rather a bad-tempered fellow, be in a rac Toftamonr, he mnet take a deal of beating. He has been going particularly well since his arrival from Aitobude, and ta looks hearty, muscular, and well. Frying 4 pan is one man of muscle and has evidently undergone a thorough preparation, and, if he runs up to his private trials, will be very hard to beat Hecla appears to be even tetter than she was at fiandwick ; and the friends of Trans ferred are very confident. I do not know whether Boolka has arrived yet, but he is said to be very well, and may give trouble. The race promises to be very iast, and Guesswork, Fryingpan, Hecla, and Transferred may oome home as named. Erin may win the Challenge Cap, and the places for the Toorak Handicap may 30 to Larpent, Doogalston, 1 and Stockdale. Latest Betting. — Canlfield Guineas : 9 to 2 Guess work.
