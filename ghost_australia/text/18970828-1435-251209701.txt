STORY. The Sound of a Voice. I received oa% morning in my surgery a, visit fropi Lord Springthorpe. " I htive heard a great deal of you lately, Doctor," he said. " That was a very clever cure you effected in my; friend Ttussel's case." ' ' "That was nothing," I replied. "I discovered that my predecessor in the case had made a mistake in liis diagnosis, and was treating the patient for an imaginary disease, thereby aggravating the one from which lie w^s really suffering. I simply reversed- the treatment, when ti.e patient, who is & man. of excellent constitution, began to mend directly, , ./• " You" are modest, Doctor," he said laughingly. " However. .1. have sufficient confidence in your judgment to ask your advice.in a somewhat delicate matter.' The delicacy lies in the aitr crtmstftnce that the patient must be kept' in ignorance of the fact that she is being observed. It is my wife, Lady Springthorpe, -to whohi I refer. She has been in failing health for some time, but from what 'cause we cannot" ascertain, Our family physician, Dr. Hoilister, in whom I place 'implicit •trust, confesses himself entirely at fault, and would be very glad of. your opinion ; but Lady Springtboirpe is firm in her refusal to see another physician. Therefore, you will have to; ebliisbal £he real object of your visit under theguiseof friendship." , 1 \ ( ',V : Cau- yon give jiua:any.idea of thfe -ijyiioptoms ?"

" '/.'-v..-., f ««He is inclined 'to believe Jthait her •jntotttteismen^ has some hrairidisease, or thatshe has aomfething upoii lier mind, the anxiety of which' is tolling her.; But. that, discourse, we' . know to ^impossible." \ • ' r. ^ImustcbnfeB&t;^ my professional^ 'I s^hall be hapjiy to Ladjr Sprit^- ) thoroe,; and tkjm^rbliotes with Dr. .VHoiUster;" ' . ? youto come openly in jouir^tofej8ib)i6l ' ,'few friends next week: at/Gravelly IMwejy gla^ if ' tou wdaf&^^'dhie of * \ t -. • • - , bethan. One portion, now-unoccupied, actually belonged to that period, and the remainder, although evidently built at different times,, had been made to conform in some measure to the original design. Upon my arrival I had scarcely time to change my dress when a knock came to my door and Lord Springthorpe entered. "I believe we tacitly agreed hot to, discuss- the real object of your visit, but I must express my great anfciety for my wife's health. Lam afraid, if this mysterious disease is not promptly checked, L*dy Springthorpe is not long for this world. I'must tell you that we are an exceptionally affectionate and devoted conple, although I am nearly twice her age, and the separation would be a great blow to me. As we grow older ,our attachments become stronger or our sensibilities more keen. I loVed my first wife, and Heaven knows how I grieved when she died ; but somehowthe "anguish of her loss, which I had before me for a long time, never caused 'me such anguish as i'suffer now." V " Because then ybn had never, experlenced ench a loss and could not , properly. realise how much it meaiit. Now you know what a rude'shock ?t is to have the Associations of years broken. up, and you dread the ordeal." " That is profoably the correct scientific explanation, 1 ' he said, with a smile, "but when people suffer, they cannot analyse their feelings'; they- only feel, they v cannot reason. In • the'• presen case I should bear a double., burden -of grief, for I should mourn,the death of ,t<*o women at once. Do you believe in the possibiUty of a man loving the ivingand the dead at the same time f' ," I can quite understand that the 'affections, ^epriyed of their bbjiects>. still survive, and like a climbing vine that rhtislostits'original inppb^^'&iTdtf; "their tendrils about the near^st suitable butgrowingiheimpressionofthefirst."

"No,"! replied,at least, not to my recollection.", She smiled sweetly, and extended ber. hand. n «• No," she fealid, "Dr. Norris and I have never met." At the'sound of her voice I started, for there was a tone which struck my ear as familiar, but although I scrutinised her pountenance, I had certainly qever seen that face before. " Now it is*your turn to appear surprised," stud Lord Springthorpe. " Pardon me," I said, " but it seems to me that I have heard Lady Springthorpe's voice before, though under what circumstances I have not the remotest idea." • " Hov singular !" said Lord Spring- thorpe.>'• •*-• • . '• " Perhaps' Dr. Norris will presently recollect whose voice it is mine reminds him of," Lady Springthorpe said. " Very likely," I replied. ; ^ During dinner : I was;.unujsually.dull and pensive.:; Lady 5 Sjwingthorpe's voice haunted me. Every time she spoke I involuntarily looked up, expecting to encounter a familiar, face. At t times, there was Something in her pose that touched a chord of memory. but try as I might to conc^troct a complete figure from thisse two tr«tB. the face always baffled me. ' Ai last I dismissed the matter fTom my mind by force of will,; leaving the mystery to clear itself, I knew it would. 1 ' ; ,' : After dinner, when . wef had rejoiced the l(Ldiee< and the other guests either chatting.in couples, or grouped about the piano, Lady Springthorpe came and sat beside me. . < H^dli'^^fike asfeadi "havs'jou found the o wner of the vbice?

" And you have never seen her since T' . "No. I had quite forgotten -the circumstance." " And you would not recognise her if you met her again ?" " " As I said, her face was concealed by a thick veil. I have not the slightest idea of her features." " But the voice was like mine ?" "Yes." '" You do not think it was I ?" " Had it \>een you, you would have recognised the circumstances," " Which I do not. But there are resemblances between voices, I suppose, as there are sometimes between faces. " I do not rememoer of ever having heard of such a case." " And you are sceptical on the point ?" I should have been but for this instance." " Tljie coincidence appears to me remarkable, for at first sight it seemed as though I had met yon before. How do you account for that ?" " It is something I cannot account for." ; • " Do you believe that two people, who had never met in the flesh, may meet and iecome acquainted in dreams ?" .".I protest," I said, lainghing, " yon have me lit an unftur disadvantage. This is a theory I never heard before, and iw regard to which I am unprepared to Offer an opinion. I am curious to hear more of it. What do you call it ?" " Ah, Doctor, I am afraid you would only prove a scoffer." At this point she was calledaway.; ' * r That night in the smoking-room, Lord Springthorpe and I lingered over cigars after all the other guests had retired. I had been thinking over the mystery of,that woman with the veiled face. That she and Lady Spring-, thorpe were Tthe same I jhad not the slightest /doubt, but as she evidently feared recegnitjon, I had been too politic to insist upon : it. Why there should be any mystery about a visit- to a physician* puzzled me. Plainly there mi something beneath the surfage, whicbv as in the case of. many mysteries, would never have been suspected but for the pajns taken to con-* ceal it. ''I. could not forbear iisking Lord Springthorpe ft few xjuestions, wiu^h I could eaaly do without a^ppeariiig cimous, for, -as "I -had: already remarked, he had a fondness .for talkiiig of his family ^ffairs, and byiii occa8ional question I .could direct, imile seeming to folloWj hiBXMjnversation.^^^^ i, < . ?'Do yoa know, I, askedi " if' Lady Springthorpe is liable to any hereditaiy jQaiady : V ". • *' I canno^ really say," he replied," I never: khew AvguBta's family.

' " Did she receive a shock, then ? " " No ; she retired to rest in better health 1han usual The prospect of seeing her son again seemed to buoy her up. In the morning she was found dead in bed. It must have been a happy ending, for no donbt, as Augusta says, it was the result of the joyful anticipation of her son's return." " Had she no attendance during the night r . " Mies Clay—Augusta—usually slept in the same apartment, bat on this particular night Lady Springthorpe was* feeling so well that she dismissed her to her own room. The maid Blept in the ante-room but .heard nothing." " Bad Miss Clay access to her during , the night?" No. Although their rooms adjoin wall to wall, they are entered from different passages. But But I am sure I am boring you by talking so mnch of ray own affairs." '' " On the contrary, you have aroused my interest." " You are very kind to say so, doctor." Here we parted, and I retired to rest.. "So," I thought, "I have already learnt more of Lady Springthorpe's ' case than I care to know." . Beoylving in my mind some pretext for taking my departure on the following day, I fell" My rest was ;aneasy. I seemed never to lose consciousness of my snrroundingfl, yet there was something eerie and \in- • canny about them that did not belong ' to the waking worlds Tiers, seemed • alternations of light and 'shadow,' as thin, fleecy clouds chased ~ each, other across the path of the moon, a* if the; , room had been open to the sky. And*' there were rushes <bf cold wind' thatstirred my hair with the soothing ra6tle of leafy branches. I feesmed to hear : whisperings about my bed, -as: strange, airy beings, floatied in and:^at upon the; moonbeams', and hoveried roundjifoarsto'-'. me. And through all^ and. abov^Jalij I heard the. sound of that voice t nad heard'in my surgery six years before— the voice df Lady Springthorpe : You : shall not part us 1 You shall not part C us I" it seemed to say. Theu I wa^<;. wakened bj . an unmistakable actual sound-—a dull thud, that jarred the! room. •" •/' It was the closing down : of my win- • dbw ^hioh I' had partly open to ad^jt^ fireeeurnnt of air. Soabtiess 'a sash^ line had parted, I -thoi^ht, and turiiiecL ' again toslumbejr. •'*.,. " This time I slept so heavily -that it seemed to me I. waB imprisoned deepdown in the bowels of the earth in- & aulphurious atmosphere, at an enormou& ' pressure,, jn a d^kness to i dense' as to seem materidi. My head was baried: under ;- some crnshingi weight.

Then dame the sptjndsofblo^sahdi® oftheroc^ the jpure air of i»ven ^hed into iny I Mt myself lifted upon my feet, bat movement was so painful that I threw myself down again, for I felt I only wanted to sleep undisturbed. Then a voice cried : _ " Morris, Norris! For Odd's sake, rouse yourself." - Walk him u|) and down," said another voice, "Bring him out into the passage." Again I was lifted up and , forced along, and after what seemed to be endless peregrinations, it began to dawn upon me that I was in the passage of Gravelly Grange, surrounded by Lord Springthorp's guests. " How did that happen, Doctor ?" asked Lord Springthorpe, who held me by the arm. I turned and gazed Upon him stupidly. I noticed that he and others were in their pyjamas. " How did what happen ?" I asked. "What has happened ?" " You left your gas turned on full, on going to bed." "Impossible !" It is true ! However, we were in iiine to save you. It was a fortunate Circumstance that the Major here chanced to awake, and detecting a smell of gas, was able to trace it to your room. We were just in time, for you were quite insensible." I. cannot explain it," I said. " Of course, 1 cannot recall the definite act of turning out the gas, / but it is habitual with me to do so carefully ; and [ never make a practice of leaving a jet even burning low. It is incredible that I should have broken into the habit of a lifetime." " Well, it is of ncf consequence now how it came about ; but you are turned out of your room for the rest of the ilight. Would you jnind making use of the couch in my room ? I will lend you some blankets from my bed. I don't care to call up the servants." I w is glad enough to rest under any circumstances, and closed with his offer at once. In five minutes I was sleeping soundly once more, without being troubled with dreams. I rose in the, morning little the worse for my experience. At breakfast I met Lady Springthorpe, and was startled by the alteration in her appearance. Her •face had a pinched, worn look, and her eyes were sunken and surrounded by dark rings. ' She 'had evidently passed a night of suffering, but her indomitable will showed in the fact of ber- sustaining tbe semblance of her usual high spirits. Her conversation was as sparkling and her mantier ai sweet 'and gracious &s; over. When she commiserated with me on my night's adventure, fend coquetr tishly J-aiUed ine on jtay heedlessness, I' could feel my suspicions slipping trt?ay from me. After breakfast I Btole upstairs and maiie acarefnletsamm'rtSonOf my bedroom. I folind .'the gas tap to be hi perfecV condition. as was also the 'window.

At that moment, by a sudden twist of the body I brought myself to my feet on the floor, prepared to grapple with the intruder. To my consternation there waB no one there. . . • My first thought was that my imagination bad played me a trick by misinterpreting some distant sound, but, no—almost in my-'face I heard that same long breath- expelled in a sigh, while the footsteps turned and retreated to that corner whence they had first issued. • . I stood electrified with horror, bathed from bead to foot in an icy sweat. The most imminent peril, provided it had tangible form, couldnot have occasioned me the terror that did that empty space. Then in a nervous jury I sprang after the retreating sounds, and smote the air, but my blows met with no resistance. I lighted the gas and searched the. room, only to prove that it had no ^occupant but myself. It seemed an hour before I could collect myself sufficiently to reason. 1 had always been a sceptic as to the supernatural, yet here was evidence seeming to upset the convictions of a lifetime. I could not doubt my Benses —surely my brain and nerves had been too well trained to give way to delusions so suddenly. I muBt admit the phenomenon, the difficulty was to explain it. However, when I had a little recovered my composure, I reasoned that if what I had - heard were an objective manifes tation, it must have a physical source, which I determined to discover. I sat down to calmly await a repetition of the sounds, but although I watched and listened till daybreak, they came no •mose. During the day that followed, in conversation with Lord Springthorpe, I introduced the subject of the older portion of the house, and learnt its history, what there was of it r it seeming to possess no peculiar interest beyond the fact of its antiquity. " Not even the traditional ghost ?" I asked. "No, strange to sa^, the only portion of the Grange which has any supernatural interest was built within my own recollection. By-the-way, it is the very room you are now occupying." "Indeed? And pray, what was the ghost story ?" There is 'scarcely-any story to mention, but people who formerly Blept there used to complain of peculiar noises, andthe room got the; reputation of being haunted. When Miss Clay came heris —the present Lady Springthorpe— hearing we' had a haunted Tooft), she requested to 'be allowed to pass at least one night in it, and occupied the fcoom r^ularlyfrtim, that time till t°he ttate >of our -Bplairriflge vrithotit Seeing or'hfeai-r ' ing anything udnsuaL" , : " Ahd wliftt'wafe the hatture of fidunds 8up{ioskl ! to be h'aVe been heard 7" 1 , .

"Unhappy woman," I said,I know 'that you caused the death of your former mistress because she stood in the way of your ambition, and 'that ybu have twice attempted my life." She (slipped from the bed to the floor at my feet. Mercy, mercy," she cried. ." If you knew how I have dreaded this moment —how I "have foreseen it! Once I thought myself safe-—I thought discovery beyond the reach of possibility. Then it used to come to me in my dreams, that through Borne accident, some oversight—some excess of caution, even — judgment, wonlcl overtake me. The certainty of detection lias been a chill, black cloud hanging over me, descending lower and lower, and closing nearer and nearer. The longer it delayed' the ' more terrible it seemed. It was consuming my life. I knew that it was killing me, and I hoped and prayed that I might die before the blow fell—that I might breathe my last m my husband's arms, beloved and respected. You came, and I knew that the blow had fallen. I had always carried with me the means of instant death against that moment, but when I pictured to myself my husband's grief arid horror—for I love liim—I know you don't believe a woman such as I capable of true affection,'but I love him. And you have come to denounce me to him." , ' - " What my precise duty is, I am not' certain, but 1 do not feel justified in disturbing Lord Springthorpe's peace of mind." ; ' "I was ready and willing; to die,but I could notbeartoleavemymemorystained and blackened in hiseyee. *I prayed for just a little more life to enable me to destroy the accusing «vidence.
