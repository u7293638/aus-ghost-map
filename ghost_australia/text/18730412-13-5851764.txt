THE THEATRE ROYAL. MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. Notwithstanding the proverbial dulness of the last week in Lent, the Theatre Royal was very well filled on Thursday night on the occasion of Miss Adelaide Bownng's benefit The play chosen for representation was " Much Ado About Nothing," the lady sustaining the part of Beatrice The play which deals with the misfortunes of poor Hero Yve have alway a regarded as one of the most charming on the stage. It presents a perfect picture of country-house life, and hospitable Leonato, merry Benedick love torn Claudio, and parma beadle Dogberry are each portraits drawn with the minute skill of George Eliot, and coloured with the dramatic vigour possessed by Shakspeare only Miss Downing's Bea rice is one of her most successful impersona- tions, and is marked by all that delicate intelligence which her quick wit and great stage adaptability so ably second Miss Bownng never misses a point, nor delivers a but with too great eagerness Her exquisite appreciation for the mood of her audience and her clear and sound enunciation aid her in producing the effect who desires with as little effort as possible On Thursday night this faculty for the immediate establishment of accord was very marked We have seldom seen the part played better throughout, while here and there some happily accented passage seemed almost to shed a new light upon the familiar sentences Nowhere, perhaps, was this happy intention of the subtleties of the author's meaning shown more clearly than in the second act (the masquerade), where Leonato, becoming decorously annoyed at the daring sallies of the merry girl (Leonato is a thorough country gentleman, a Tory to the backbone, jealous of the comfort of his guests, submissive to his Prince, but, Ancestrally, proud as Lucifer) says Niece, will you look to those things I told you of The blending of intense respect for the head of the house, with a frank independence for his "Grace's" opinion, was most artistically given in the notable scene with Benedick 0 that I were a man ! I would eat his heart in the market place .' -she was intensely earnest without being in the least shrewish or on feminine, and the sparkling sally of cross purposes which concludes the play was given Yvitha sharpness and fetish which evoked spontaneous laughter Mr Belton played Benedick, and gave such a rendering of it as might have been expected from his performance of the " Marble Heart " Our notion of the character of Benedick, and the method in which that most gallant gentleman would conduct himself in the office and affairs of love," differs widely from that held by Mr Belton We have had many excellent Benedick, of whom, in our judgment the best was Barry Silvan an and found in each actor some distinct qualification to admire 01 some vexed stage question to discuss In the impersona- tion of Mr Belton was found nothing of this sort It would be unjust to say that his Benedick was, on a piece of acting, utterly bad for it was not Those were some manly and broad touches in it that we liked, and the commonplace conception of the character that of a blue!, rollicking, jovial soldier- was consistently preserved But the performance was not one to be considered with any Yicwto minute criticism It was simply a level and perfunctory exposition of a "part' as set forth in an acting edition of a Shakspearean handed down by the tradition of the green room We are always respectful to gentlemen who come to us bearing European testimonials, but we must not be unjust to those born or reared among us The Australian stage has seen the best of actors in its time, and can show a very promising family of its own leaving Mr Belton must be content to take his own rank among these that of tin honest stock actor, who having acquired both the knowledge and the man seem to be gained by a long course of provincial experience comes to us somewhat past his pt enter e t uni me but capable of fairly rendering a secondary part named in the ordinary business-list of stage managers Mr Ireland s Don Pedro was marked by that gentleman's usual accused by and elocutionary carefulness Mr Appleton did not play Claudio to our satisfaction The part is one of the most pine and romantic of the male characters of Shakspeare Claudio is an enthusiastic, honorable, chivalrous young fellow YCiy much in love with the pretty innocent Hero, and proportionately discussed at the discovery of her supposed pu fitly Mr Appleton played the part with far too little emotion to the last expression of his love he certainly contrived to in fuse some genuine passion, but the meeting with his resuscitated bride was apathetic to a degree Mr James Don John was one of the best things we have seen him do for some time-tonipeiate and trouble, the by litany sufficiently marked without once degenerating into mere melodramatic lent Mr Stuart O'Brien and Mr YY'uidc both most praise Thee latter made good all his points in the challenge scene, and the pathos with which the former invested the only redeeming feature of Boiacluo's character his love for Margaret-st to be much commended We cannot say too much in praise of Mr Hillwood s Leonato As an example of a stock actor," Mr Hillwood is probably at present unequalled on the colonial stage His Richmond, Mat (luff, and Ghost are all above mediocrity, and the unassuming and a variable excellence with which he plays such parts as Leonato urges his merits upon a critical and frequent audience with as much force us do his better known her for mances in his own line of eccentric comedy and but Icsquc Miss Emma Austin preserves the favourable impression she at first made upon us The part of Here is at best but with mentary, and requires only to be played with tenderness and natural womanly feeling to fulfil all reasonable requirements Miss Austin amply) satisfied us Her Here was a natural and unaffected picture of a modest young gentlewoman The broad comedy of the play was not re presented to our taste Mr John Dunn's Dogbcrr) is far too sketchy a conception to hold its own bonnie such impersonations of the character as we remember It is not to be expected, perhaps that on) actor who has not made special study of the part should play it with the intense humour of Lambert, who dwelt upon each point with the loving, lingering delight of an airstrips a shy smile picture But the Xmoi touches niDocbeiry's portions were ignored altogether by Mr Dunn, who contented himself by merely emphasising the vulgare outbreaks of ig romance and pomposity As for Verses, the astonishing impersonation of line by Mr Stewart (almost painful in its wonderful realisation ofgamilouRscnility) hasdostio)ed our capacity for enjoyment of the ordinary stage tendering Miss Bow ung \ 41 called before the curtain at the conclusion of the play, and Mr Belton also responded to repeated imitations from the upper portions of the house Miss Bownng, we believe goes to Sydney in a few days We wish her success with as much sincerity as y\q regret her loss Our opinion of her merits we expressed the other lay on the occasion of her playing For tia she is simply the only leading Shakespearian actress now on the colonial boards Misses.
