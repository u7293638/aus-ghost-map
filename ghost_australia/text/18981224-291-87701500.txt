WILBERFORCE'S WARNING. The following ghost story, which is a bona-fide experience of Bishop Wilber- force, is perhaps not generally known, that dignitary having been chary of con- fiding it to his friends, though firmly be- lieving in the episode himself:— "Wilberforce was returning home one evening when he noticed a fellow pedes- trian on the other side of the street who attracted his attention by the extraordi- nary way in which he kept step with himself : not only that, but he actually went so far as to copy his every gesture. This natu- rally enough, the bishop thought exceed- ingly rude on the strangers part, and he tried hard to make out his face through the gathering dusk, this, however, he was unable to do. In taking stock of the peculiar mimicry the bishop perceived in some amazement that people passing by the unknown took no notice of him ; seemed, indeed, not to be aware of his ex- istence, and as Wilberforce drew near to his own door this amazement reached a climax on beholding a passer-by apparently go through the stranger. So firm was his belief in this phenomenon that the bishop's pulses beat quickly and he hurried to his door, while on his part the mysterious stranger mounted the steps of a house di- rectly opposite. Arrived at the top Wil- berforce turned involuntarily to take a hasty glance, and on seeing the stranger's face, which he did clearly, gave a quick exclamation, for the face he beheld was his own ! Then the figure vanished. Bishop Wilberforce, unable to account for the incident, regarded it in the light of a warning, and refused to sleep that night beneath his own roof—a decision that curiously enough, in all probability, saved his life, for that same night the ceiling of his bedroom gave way just over the spot where his bed stood, and in its descent wrecked that article of furniture utterly. Had the bishop slept there that night it is scarcely possible that his life would have been spared. — ''Golden Penny."
