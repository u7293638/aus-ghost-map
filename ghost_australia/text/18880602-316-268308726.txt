Kelly, Eiq., •J-f-.i officiated as chairman in his usual efhsient manner. Mrs Ball accompanied all the singers on the pianoforte very satisfactorily to both singers and audience. Tho hall was rathei too much crowded, in fact it wants to be larger; and tho lighting was for from being as good as it ought to have been. It is a gre -t draw-back to the performers (here being no footlights; and the lights are so arranged that the faces of the performers are completely in the.shade, .:which greatly mars the effect of many songs, especially those with the comie element in them, as the expression of the face has a great deal to do with the successful -rendering of 'the song. The programme was as follows :— " Fantasia Silvery Waves" (piano) Mrs Ball. This was very effectively rendered, ths delicate t .uch of the pianist being very conspicuous, nor did it need much stretch of the imagination to fancy one heard the rippling of the water, so beautifully was it executed. Song: "Dear Little Jessie," Mr W. Joy was very nicely sung. Song: "Kissing goes by Favour," Miss E. Hurley. This young lady did full justice to the words aud music, and received great applause. .Comic Song : "Up to Dick," Mr J. Kinley was very well ssutig, this gentleman being quite at home in the comic element. Duet: "Strictly Confidential," Mrs Jenkins, and Miss J. M'Eenna. Although sung to time aiid music, this is not a taking duet with the.public, and it consequently fell flat. 1 w'buldrecommend.thesetwo.nieesingersto try something more suitable to their style, say, "TheTwo Cousins." Song: "Empress of the Waves," Mr Anketell. This song was well rendered, the singer's voice being well adapted to the -music and theme, and was sung in, admirable time. Sbng " My pretty Irish Queen," Mr C. O'Grady, was capitally su'ig, and as the music and words are very takingittook with the audience immensely, and now whenever you go 1 one has to hear all the boys and girls trying to. sing it. Song; "Pretty Janet" Miss J, M'lCenna, took with the audience rery well, the fair singer well maintaining her reputation as au acquisition to any amateur performance. Comic Duet: "Money Matters" Miss C. Hurley and .Mr J. Kililay, with two such singers and actors it is alwavs a foregone conclusion that there will be something worth listeniug to, and right well ,did they maintaiu their well earned reputation," their bye-play especially, being admirable. Song: ,";Let's be friends" Mrs Jenkins, iwas sung ss this lady always sings her songs /musical.y and beautifully. Comic Song! " Musical Party" Mr W. Joy. was fairly rendered, although sung to a different tune to the one it is siing to. The original tune, ho\VB\w, i^pre.ferab!a^ Piauo Dnet^^Woodj Miss B. Coloe, was - nicely played by these young ladies, the upper notes being deftly played by Miss Hurley ; the bass accompaniment of Miss B. Coloe being well timed,sna tasteful. Song: "Barney O'Hea" Miss ,J. M'Kenna, was appropriately and archly sung and much applauded. Song: " When Papa Comes Home to Night" Mr- W, Joy, was sung in a very pleasing manner, and duly appreciated. Song: "Tn.u jaaour;:'/ Misi E. Hurlev, was very • pretu.y: sung, the manner in which it was -rendered bearing, testimonv that the sinner fully appreciated the subject and the music: Oonlic-D.uet: ; i Very improper." Mrs Jenkins and Mr- C. O'Grady, This un doubtedly was the gem of the evening, -both singers evidently being, fully alive to the requisite style and acting suitable for this class of song, their acting being really superb, while tne .musical part was -unexceptionable, The absence of footlights was very noticeable in't-lus song as much of its successful effect is due to • tho facial expression. Comic Song: -'I- did if Mi J. Kinley was artistically rendered, and the singer looked and acted to perfection that he was a benedict -in hot water, and that his wife kicked up a rumpus was a matter of course. Song: "One -day': Miss J. MKonna. was sung smoothly and -sweetly'-in the customary style of this vomig ladv. Sou,,': Am t •you glad • von- didn t - Mr Anketell. The singer-was "ail there - in this,song, and sang it very well indeed. Song: "Female auctioneer- Miss E. Hurley, This was another L'em which went far to show the versatile talent of this musical young lady, her animated archness and bewitching bveplay being an artistic study,. and was immensely/eiijoyed'bv the audience./-At each refrain, there were nlentv,of animated bids for the charming singer, but although some big bids were made, the.-actual value was not reached, so no business- effected; Song : '•All . over with the JladieB" Mr E. OtGrady, was m this gentleman's usual happvstyle, and was-anot-her illustration, of how he -must have mused his vocation, by not don- .ning the . buskin . and sock. Sailor's Hornpipe-: Mr W. Joy, who was dressed in true nautical costume, and certainly looked every inch, a sailor.
