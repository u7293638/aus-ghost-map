AFFAIRS AT SADDLEWORTH. TO THE EDITOR. I am, Sir, &c.;, X.X. Sirâ€”As a resident of Saddleworth I cannot allow the remarks made by your correspondent for this place, in your issue of the 24th instant, to go unchallenged, and beg to make some cor- rection. He says there are 300 men at work on the Saddleworth and Auburn-road, There is not half that number. As regards the "anxiety" felt by the " citizens" on pay night, I have not seen nor heard of anything (and I live in the township) calculated to alarm anybody not in the habit of dreaming about ghosts, though I believe there has been disturbance among the roadmen at the Doolie-house, when they are paid off, whioh 4s a thing contractors under Government ought not to be allowed to do; they should pay their men either on the works or at some private plaoe. As regards the removal of the Port- Office to the BaQway-Station, while agreeing with your correspondent's remarks about the inconvenience of the Bailway-Station, I beg to inform him that the Post- Office is still in the same plaoe as it has been this 13 years, though I believe some person, acting on the " dog and manger" principle, has been getting up a mem( rial to have it removed to the station, an there is one in course of signature against it.
