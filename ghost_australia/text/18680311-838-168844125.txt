Still undismayod, tho soldipr hurried down tho stops, and whon ho roaohed tho hoaoh withpat, lie saw the figuro disappearing in tho ' dart'uoss.;. In stantly ho raisod his gun nnd firpd!'

Tho oxcitomont in and aroundtho fort waB intense tho next day. . Tlio commandant avowed his deter mination to discover and' capture ' tho' 'oulprifc, if Its took tho wholo garrison lo do it. It was tho strangos-^V! affiiir that had ovfer liapponod at Old'Poinfci'Und tho Onperstition and curiosity of tho ihhabitapts.of'tho littlo peninsula wore oxcitod to the highest pilbti'. Daring tho day1, Dick Lane, who fdlt that his cre dit, and perhaps his mothor's oooupanoy of her posi tion weroat stake, waitod on tho commandant, and askod permission to watch tho liglit-houso that night himself, and tako his position jn the lantern, and would promise that the light should nqt.be ex tinguished again. The porinission waB granted ;'but the commandant gnvo ordors to have a guard of five mon kept in readiness, just outside the fort, to prooeod to Dick's aSBistanoo as scion as they should hear the roport of his pistol . — The night was as wild as either bf the oth'ersY'hnt Diok took his post m the lantern, undismayed, and prepared to await the coming of the ghost. About , ten o'olook, ho began to he oloepy, hut was at length aronsed from this state by tlio sound of heavy, foot falls on the stairs. He listened. Tho sound' came nearer ; and then ho heard a wild, mournful voice, orying, ' Woe', woo to the ships !' Per a moment the lad felt his. blood r,un col^.;, but summoning up his oouragq, he proparbd himself for the onoounter. ' ' J A tall, musoular figuro, olad in a faded blue uni form, with a haggard faoe, overgrown with beard, -and with loug matted , hair,- entered the lighthouse lnntern. As it saw the lad, it glared at him sovagely, ' and thon sprang; towards him with oliowl of rago. Dick raised his pistol and firod, bat missod his aim. In anothor instant I he figure seized him by tho throat. ' Tho boy struggled manfally ; hut ho was no matoh for tho powerful strength of his strango antagonist. - Ho was forced to the floor ; and tho , gripe about his throat tightened, until he grbw un conscious. When ho reoovorod his senses, he wa3 lying on the beaoh, and tho oommandant'of tho fort throwing water in his face. Springing to his feet, he askod, hurriedly, ' Aro tho lights burning ?' 'Yes, my lad,' said tho. commandant. -.' You have kept your promise nobly ; though it was near being fatal to you.' Diok learnt that his pistol shot had .been heard by tho guard, who had hastened to his assistance. They had arrived just in time to saTe him from death at the hands of. the ghost, who was secured after a desperate struggle with him. The mysteri ous personage proved to bo aidorangod soldier, lyho had osoaped from the hospital at the fort. In his ? madness ho had been seized with a violent desire to pat out tho lampB In the light-house. He was sent to a lunatio asylum ; and, dftor that, Old Point light was never more extinguished ; nnd tho light-houso f ,was never again haunted, by tho presence of » ghost. . . - Tub Cbbdit Systesi. — Tho oredit Bystem has been carriod to. a pretty fino point in sorao of the rural distriots of Amerioa, if wo may judgo from the' fol- lowing dialoguo, said to have recontly ocourred be tween a oustomer and ' the proprietor: 'How's trade, squire 2' — 'Well, oasli tiado's kinder dull hoaw, major.' — ' Dun anything yeBtorday ?' — .'
