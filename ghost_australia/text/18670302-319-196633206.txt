A EEYIEW. A Refutation of tho Bcrsonal Reign of our Lord Jesus Gkrist, and A Vindication of the Restoration of tlic Jews; in. twelve letters to a. ifrienaL Ey H. 'W. Moktisiee. Mel bottme : 'Walker, May jvnd Go. We have not much. 7tts,say aboTit this book one Tray or another. We :sh.oTild not have noticed It ;at all but ioriihe simple iacrt of its being , a colonial production. It treats of un ?oocupying considerable attention at present, is not nmen in our line. We are aware that ithe wild tb-eories of Buster have 12ieir enttha siasfcie believers :h.ere as -well as in England, and that a system of proselytising Is in activB operation ^ 'but Tveregard th.e f act aB indicative jrather of the loiystate of religions intelligence in the oommnnity, titan of the -worth of the theories themselves. We nave Bometimes wondered .whether itlie people ?wb.o designate -themselves pre-millenarians xeally believe in .the interpretations of prophecy, 'wiich, to com mon sense, are so .utterlyiabsnrd^ but it seems that some of them do. There aTe ladies in this 'bnsy Melbourne :\vno, our atithor tells us, ' are inspired with the most passionate yearnings Jor tne immediate appearing of our Lord;;' and he refers to one in particrilar, ivho 'hoped she should be in the flesh at the time ?of oxnr Lord's appearing* :that her domicile might be honored with Ms presence, and that, being ushered into iher dra^wing-room, they .should hare ^idelightfnl -chat together.' It was to check such mischievous delusions that Mr Mortimer wrote the series of letters which he has now- published. He waB flt nrst challenged to -fche controTersy ~bj a friend who was fully persuaded .that he 'should be obliged to surrender to the Scripture testimony alleged to.be OTenvhehninginiaTOT of Christ's personal -appearing and reign upon earth. He had pro ceeded, he tells us, but :a little way in the con troversy when he turned the tables upon his friend, who acknowledged himself to have been in error. It is not often that ;a controversialist meets 'with such xapidL ;Buccess. The fact is areally worthy of being recorded as proof that our author muBt be pos sessed of a rare Sialectic skill, -and (that he must have met with am epponent ojemaTkable for frankness and generosity of temper. But this was not -all the s success iwhich oui' author achieved ; for -on ihowing the letters to se yerM friends who were pre-niillenaiians h'ke the orieinal tchaEensrer, the result was that almost to anianthey wereinducedto change their views on the .subject. We are thus prepared for the .announcement rthat -all these friends and .converts solicited Mr Mortimer to publish his letters;; and we jthinkhe Tronld iave been more than mortal if .he had :not yielded to such ?encouraging solicitations. Such, then/is the simple history of this publication, and we narrate the history because it showsthat there must be some merit in the bosk. The twelve letters of which the book consists are devoted to the consideration of six questions. What the questions iare, and what the answers given, to them, will appear from the following passage: — 1\. The MOlenuium I understand to he a very long period ;of great hlesseilnesE to the 'Church on earth, and to the world at large. 2. I npprehencl Christ's Mngdom comprehencls all past, present and future saints, and consists of all bouIs that have been, or ever shall be, ransomed by His Hood. 3. The Scriptures, I think, speak veuy jdecibttelt that the next Advent wID. be for judgment, i. I believe ChriHt's reign on, and over our earth will evee he, nsitnowis, a srnsiTBAii one. 5. The resurrection of the righteous and the Tricked, I am prepared to prove, wOl ne 'simultaneous. '6. ChriBt's second coming., Tvhich I think 1 BhaH nave no difficulty in proving from Scripture, -will he subsequent to the Millennium, and therefere .cannot be a pereonal reign during that period. There is a sober earnestness pervading the author's treatment, the efficacy -of which, with such ;as are already interested in the subject, we can easily understand ; but we suspect that m, style of treatment less dry and abstract is required for the great mass of outsiders, who are not interested in it at alL For our part we confess that we should like to Bee the doctrine of the millenium set forth in such a way as would show, not only that it is taught in scripturfr — of which there can be no doubt ' —but also that it has an intimaterelalaonship with most ©f the great -queBtions ;mow agitating society, and that at is in accord ance -with the conclusions arrived at by the most advanced modern thought. By a Millenium we mean a long j«riod of prosperity upon the earth .; Avher ixe arrangements of society will be perfect; -when the develope ment of each individual as to his physical, intellectual, and ' moral capacities will be complete ?; :and the -maximum of human happiness enjoyad. If this definition be accepted, it follows that they ' err egregiously who represent the -TTjjfflftnTriTiTr) as close :at hand. They not only expoBe the subject to ridicule by fixing now upon one date ? and now npon another — if I860 Tvon't do, try 18G7 — but they wrench the future from all natural connection -with ihe present by having recourse to cataclysms and miracles; and, worst of all, 'events which they- unfeignedly regard as constituting a Btnpendous spectecle they do their, best to degrade by the introduc tion of the vulgarest machinery. It follows from our definition that those err too on the other hand, though not to the same degree, who spiritualise und refine the Twill pmnimT' away till it appears but the faintest shadow of a reality-— the mere ghost of an idea, without a body. Although an event yet in the future, the millenium is surely related in some way to the present, as the present is to the past of the world's liiEtory. Destined to be an event of which. 1Mb eartinrill be the scene, it is pnrely (susceptible of association in thought and aspi ?-? -. ' , ration withthc activities of living men. «?
