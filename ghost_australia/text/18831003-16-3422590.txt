THE POST OFFICE. (North British Advertiser.) TtíH Postmaster-General has issued the twenty-ninth annual report of the work of the post office, The contents are of a very varied character, dealing with the collection and the delivery of letters, post cards, books &c;, the arrangement of post offices and' letter-boxes, and the services in connection with the telegraph, the telephone, savings banks, annuities and life insurance. The estimated number of letters delivered in the United Kingdom during the twelve month» was 1,280,(*36,200, showing an increase of 4"2 per cent ; the number of post cards, 144,0-16,200, an increase of 6*4 per cent ; the mini bei* of book packets and circular^ 288,206,400, au increase of C'3 per cent ; and the number of newspaper»}. 140,682,600, being slightly lesa than last year. The decrease in newspaper» may be attributable to increased facilities offered by railway companies for «ending newspapers as parcels. The number of regis- tered letters was 11,264,926, being an in- crease of 3"3 pes eent. The nninber of post offices has been increased by 488, making it total of 15,406 ia the United Kingdom, of which 920 are head offices ; 770 letter- boxes' luive been added,, making the total num- ber of receptacles of all sorts for letters' about 30,100. The' number of eotablished' officers of the department-that is,, per sons holding permanent situations-is about 44,600. Of these 2561 are females. The numboi' of letters received, in the returned letter offices was 5,651,443, an increase of 196,558 ; of post cards, 596,614, an increase of 37,205 ; of book packets, 4,988,990, an increase of 2S7.596 ; and of newspapers, 477,978, an increase of 63,184e The increase in returned letters is about proportionate to the increase in corre- spondence. Of the letters 562,291 were uii returnable ; 26,293 bore no address, and of' this number 1604 contained cash andi cheques, &c.;, amounting to £6016, the whole of which, with the exception of about Ü150,, has already been returned to the senders. The total number of letters and packets containing value showed an increase of 12,000. Notwithstanding repeated warnings to the public, nearly 30,000 articles were re- ceived loose and coverless, owing to the-. weak and flimsy nature of the wrappers used and the itisecure^mode of packing. The Postmaster-General reports favour- ably of the progress of the savings banks. The amount dite to depositors at the close of the year was upwards of thirty millions. The number of telegraph messages was 32,092,026, being an increase of 746,165 only, as compared with 1,933,879 in 1881 82\. This diminution in the rate of increase is partly to be accounted for by the fact that two Easters, involving four holidays, occurred in the financial year. The postal order returns show a large increase. About ¿.3,451,000, as compared with £2,000,000 in 1881-82, were transmitted by means of these orders within the year, and no less than 7,980,328 orders were used. The Is., 5s., 10a., and 20s. orders continue to be most in request. The gross revenue of the post office for the year was £9,413,812. The expenditure was £6,352,064, the net revenue thus being .¿'3,001,748, being a decrease of i*3S,727 on the previous year. Commenting on this, Mr. Fawcett says:-" It will be observed that the increase of expenditure during the year was again large. Much of this increase was due to the development of business, but there were also special items of outlay, already referred to ; for instance, £03,000 for the improvement of'the letter earners' posi- tion, £34,000 for the remuneration of sub , postmasters, £37,000 for improved telc giaphic fouununication with Ireland, I and £13,000 for a cable depot." lu concluding the îeport the Post- master-General cxptesses his regret ¿it the loss which the department has sustained during the year byf the deaths of Mr. C4eorge Chetwynd, C.B., Receiver and Accountant Geneial- Mr. T. O. Ramsay, Controller of the Savings Bank Depaitinent ; and Dr. Waller Lewis, the chief medical officer. Mr. Chetwynd's career extended over forty years. It is interesting, as bearing upon the state of education of the coimtiy and the effi- ciency of the postal service, to compare the number of letters per head of the popula- tion now sent through the post on the one hand with the number sent in foi mer yeal«, and, on the other, willi that circulating in foreign countries. In 1839, the year before the introduction of the penny post, three letters were Rent per head. In the following year, the number more than doubled ; in 1873 it had risen to 29, and it now stands at 30. Comparing the cliiieient divisions of the United Kingdom, England is far in advance, tho averagi" number being there 41, in Scotland 31, and in Ireland 17. In Germany, on tile other hand, where the postal system is in many respects superior to our own, anti where education is generally considered to be more widely diffused, but where the population is thinly scattered over extensive districts, the average number of letters per head is,, .according to the best returns available, only 13 ; while in France the number-as lo. When we turn to telegrams, we do notfuul thesame evidence that the pre- sent system reaches the mass of the people. The number of messages sent is only 32,000,000, and the increase was little more than a third of that of the previous year. The proportion of telegrams lo letters is not staled in the present report, but last year it was put at 1 to 44 ; while in the case of France it was 1 to 29 ; in Belgium, 1 to 24 ; in llolhnd, 1 to 22 ; and in tíwilzeiland, 1 to 23. Bearing in miticl the much larger correspondence of this country*, as indicated by the figures we have just now quoted, the sniall ase of the telegraph here a» compared with rhe Continental countries shows that the service is of a. far less popular character. It is to be hoped that the promised reduc- tion of the minimum charge to (id., to which Mr. Fawcett alludes, will redress this anomaly in the postal system. I nox'T know what I should do without Charters Towers and its coming member. A few days ago a lady correspondent-"An Eye Witness" - indited a long screed to the "Northern Shiner,*' regarding the cloetions. She wies kind enough to « rite very w emily in favour of O Kane anti Rutledge, and now, of , coiuse, no oac else will have the ghost of a show 'for the Kennedy. Thudy felt the force of tlteso 'remarks so strongly that lie recommended tho letter "to.thc careful perusal of *Ue women of the Kennedy,*' to the intent. thtt\ the said, women ohall "v.¡se their influence- with their h'.'.ihamV, ¡uni not let them voto for,my man suspected of a coolie mint."
