Willis, said tho Secrotary returnod ten parishos as not having given any offertory collections what- ever to the Church Socioty since last s Easter.' He (tlie President) thought it not desirable'-.that tho names should bo published. : ; i.' i The'CHAííCELi,oh, in answer toï'Hr. Christopher ; ?Rolleston,-said the original parochial, register' of ' births in tho parish of St Stophón'a,- Kewtown, hiul not been restored to tho polish, because, it had never been satisfactorily shown that this parochial register, belonged to tho parish of St. Stephen's. .Mr. Kerrison James hail some sort of control over this register and others, as tv security' for his right of compensation. Tho PiiKsrnuNT, in answer- to the Hov. J. R. Dloiuticld, said he lind been in consultation-with the other bishops on tho subject of substituting suffrages ir. tho Litany for tho Govomoi'. and Par- liament instead of the prayers now in use. And it was Iiis intention to obtain sanction for tho inser- tion of such.suffrages in the Litany. Ile toole this opportunity of expressing his desire that clergy- men shoula uso tho form of prayer for tho Gover- nor printed by Mr. Cook. This form differed from the former, by tho omission of tho title " His Ex- cellency."' ' Sir Alfred Stephens lind stiitod to him (thc Bishop;i that ' whon this title Drat fell on bis eiuyit awakened a feeling of shrinldng from itsatse ai such*: a time.. Accordingly", in tho time of Lord HelmoreV'ho (thc Bishop) had directed thc clergy' to omit tho term ".Hie Excellency." ' Tbe DÏÎAN said that ho was not aware till, this moment th.it' his Lordship had sanctioned tho uinisaitui of tho words ; «nd that was why he had continued to uso them in the Cathednil.

It wau im- possible lei- u Christian to preach tho Oospel, unies.» bo wan duly punt by '. laying on of hands." Laymen fhould not (ulm* upon them to preach, and so usurp other mon's place. Kev. Canon A'IDAI, seconded thu motion. I Tho DHAN said ho was (drucie willi tho mis I quotation of Holy Scripturu by Mr. Woodd. Tho words "No man taketh this office, to himsolf, biit I. he that is. called of God, us.was Aaron," referred* to tho .Jewish priesthood, and' could hardly bo applied fairly to tile present question. Tho npostlo waa arguing concerning our Lord's priesthood, mid' showing that Hu obeyed His Rather's will in taking up the work of tho priesthood. They (tho clergymen) were not priests, in tho souse in which tho .lowish priests woro. They, wore presbyters or I teachers, rather than priests to oller sacrifico, i Then Mr. Woodd put a now interpretation on tho j article. Ho imported the word "episcopal" into 1 it. The article said, " It ia not lawful for any mau to take upon himself tho office of pu bl ic preaching or administering* tho Sacraments in tho congre- gation, before ho bo lawfully called.".'. And. the definition of the lawful calhrig' .was ,calling, by, :mcn. who .' have "public .authority given.; to them. There .was. not a. word "iii ;that.article? about "episcopal .ordination;''- If ; tho tbisbop.gave ^au- thority to. a layman .to .minister on certain been* sioiis to tlio ciingregatioii, that would come within j ¡th« senpt) of this "article. A' bishopwould bb '"jus-, stilled in giving ii license to a-layman tb, minister tb - a-certain"extent hf a congregation. 'Itmight be proved by thó history of thu Church that thero were timeswhen tho.<o who had been only .presbyte ritdly ordained wera idlowod to ofliciato in 'tho Church'of England, ns- ministers of that church. And soma who had received foreign ordination were-;appointed to high oftico in the Cliurch of Knghînd. , Ho declared his entire dissent from tho motion. -, .' ' ; ;.".?.'?'.. Ho\\\\. Mr. Ci'vn hoped the motion, if passed by tho Synod, would not apply tb Lane Cove. Kev. H.' A. fyii.jiKK thought the motion Hot. opiiortuno'; mid that this was not-tho pt-opor body to deal with 'siich a'motion. Ho didnot.ngree'with tile arguments of tho Very Ito v. tho Denn. Ho could,'not vote for tho resolution ; and ho did not like, to vote against it. Therefore, ho was Hilder the necessity of moving tho previous question. Rev. W. IJU.MKD.UNK seconded tho previous ques- tion. ??»-."? ;.!;'.:; ' ,' . The riiKsinj'.-vr said ho was. much indebted to tlie Kev. Mr.'Woodd for the manner in which ho had nut forward his views oh this subject. -[With relation to a Church in perfect order, thoso viows were entirely trite. It was necessary in a-proi'erly constituted Church, that no one should minister therein, except he was lawfully called. But tho necessities of- tho Church and of the population luid outgrown tho narrow limits within which tho I Church of langland was .originally constituted and [ which had hoon hitbertd maintained. Tho [ Archbishop of~ Canterbury had put himself at tho head of .'-.» body of-: lay-helpers. ' Tho. Bishop, of Ely also sent out laymen .with prayer.' A,bishop imiy give documents tb laymen, , authorising them to do . what laymen could do. Such, documents, ho (the President) had givon, and would continue to give, whatever might be tho decision of tho Synod. ' * , 1 Rev. Canon VIDAI, did not see tho force of the argtimbnts.of the Hean.' Ho" (the Doon) inado a différence between administering the Sacraments and preaching and reading to the people. Why make, any such distinction H They, (olorgymen) were called- "priests" in the Prayer Book. . And when tho- Bishop -ordained them' ho- said to thom ;"/Receive yo the Holy Ghost; -whosesoever.sins yo reniit^thoy are remitted; and .whosesoever sins yo retain, -they'nra -yet.iiuad." 'With .those words sounding in their"ears, waa it not inconsistent when apersoiiwasinaparishhaving tho cure of sbtils.'that another portion should come into that parish, and assume the euro'bf .souls ? "Let them, beware of. promoting thc idea that a minister of- Christ was simply a, preacher, : anti not ono commissioned, above all other things, to bring the message of sal- vation, with authority, to God's",people; rind to administer tho Holy Sacraments. In these days, whon all principles seemed to bo forgotten,-when every man did what was right in" Ins own byes, it was of tho utmost, .importance that thoy should hold fast lim old principles of tho Church. : Mr. W. J. l-'osrun said ho .was opposed to tho motion, and could not voto for .tho " previous. question, lin hoped all that held the same viows as ho did, would declino to vote for the previous' question; and negativo the original motion. ' . Hov. AV. Lu.MsiiAtMK said the remarks of tho Rev. Canon Vidal would almost load to auricular con- fession in tho Church of Ungland.. -As for. tho " priest," taking tho Greek word " hiereus," or tho Latin " sacardos,"-they ;had no such " priest" in tho Church of Ungland. ; Thora was nothing in tho whole'of tho Now .Testament ;to shdw tfiaji tho apostles ever exercised*tho power of forgiving sins. Who. can forgive sins but God alonó h1 Thé form in the morning anti, evening. servico was simply declarative'of God's willingness to forgive eilis. Rev. Canoii.,VIDAL disclaimed entirely tho Sen- timents ascribed to' him by Mr. Lunisdnino.- " Ho agreed with him (Afr. Lumedaino) as to tho menn- ing of tho form of uba-jlution in tho Church Service.
