nearer to the go in , Slit knew him as Coruum, and upon his I back she saw, urging him onwards, one in dark blue ruinous, golden rim plates, and helmet, who seemed to be the lost Achilles on her earlier dreaming Behind there trailed a long field of war steeds, struggling one with the other, and vainly endeavouring to catch the leader No sound of hoofs fall early in this strange race, that she and the phantom judge alone were witnessing Every horse was beaten save the blown, and she had no doubt of the result Pre gently he passed the winning post, and then by sudden metamorphosis the horses
