The following notice to mariners is published for general information. T. REYNOLDS, Treasurer. NOTICE TO MARINERS rfAVtOATIXG IN THE VICINITY or WHIDBEY ISLANDS. Notice is hereby given, that Captain S Eyre, of the whaling schooner Gem, reports having seen heavy breakers bearing S.S.E. by compass distance (2) two miles from the eastern extremity of Perforated Island. Captain Sayre states he is of opinion the above danger is a sandbank, about 100 yards in length, lying in north-easterly and south-westerly direction. Mariners navigating in the locality indicated, should give the southern end of Perforated Island a wide berth, so as to avoid the danger referred to. The Harbor authorities at Port Adelaide will be glad to receive communications from commanders of vessels respect- ing the " Sayre Bank," should it be seen by them during daylight, when observations may be taken to corroborate its position.
