One <ean gue3s with- what feelingv Squire Fairfax; awaited -his nephew's arrival. "What sort ofjt man had the , disspated boy turned out?' "Was he wilder than ever, or had he become, wild boys often do, an unusually steady and and sober man-? Would he come back aged and broken at 27, or young, strong and handsome as he should be? The accounts of his behavior in India which reached Squire Fairfax's ears assisted bim nothingJn trying to ' : ■answer these questions. .Some had de scribed him as a -warning to young men, others as a model. .. . When then, Captain Freelance was ushered into the study where Squire Fairfax and his only child SEmma was ' waiting his arrival,,it was with ill- con cealed anxiety that ■ the former rosu to ■■■• greets his guest. But -in 'a moment hie' anxiety disappeared. - Captain Free lance was no.lohger the . worn and dis sipated youth his uncle had remem- v bered him. As he stood there, tall and erect, with his broad shoulders, reso-' lute fqce aud gallant bearing, the - squire thought him the very becw-wZ&zl; of a soldier^ tbereiwas not a trace in face or manner of debauched habits or an abandoned life. • - If his nephew's reforaationbroughi * joy to Squire Fairfax, there was an- " other personin the village to whom it was extremely unweeome. Strange to say, he . who regretted the youngtaan%??i desertion of evil ways was the j-eetor^ of the parish. The Eev. Dr.BIiBr,-for. ? reasons of his own, did not rejoice over the return of the' prodigal nephew. He saw m it it th© possible defeat and confusion of all the planBand hopes of his life. ' • ... . Dr. Blair had an- only son wh6 had . not long returned from theuiniversity, k whore he had<Hstinguished himself. He was aa unlikehis daikrbro wed, bit- ., ter,' energetic father as- possible. Bale .; and fair, with a delicate, gjrlish face and a quiet, gentle- manner, George Blair was the delight and darling of all ■ the ladies, old and young, for miles around. He was in every way worthy of their esteem. His father Had made him his-curate, and th©; thoroughness ' with, which he performed his duties, 'and thekindness andthougbtfulness he . displayed in dealing with the parish poor, won for him respect and admira tion from severer, critics thah his fe male friends. \- Dr. -Blair loved his son with & ■ ■ warmth and tenderness surpnsirig in !a' man so cold and stern as he. Perhaps , this affection was the' pa© soft .spot usually to be found in-the hardestna- . tures, or perhapB it was a survival from a better self. ■ It was said that he saw in the boy's delicate face. and gentle manner a reflex and '■ veproduc- , « tibu of the wise who the ihejbor in his youth had loved with an exceeding passion, and whose early, death had. darkened and.embittbred hit .life. . For his son the doctor was..ambitious. ; While George was still a boy^is father had planned a bright, future for shim', and every step he afterwards took was adopted with due regard for that plan ; The lad was to gp to- the university j from it he was to return to Kayens crost; there he would he his father's curate, and, in proper time, would be come the husbaud of the .hoiress of Squire Fairfax, and succeed alike- to - Eavenscroft estate1 and Bavenseroftli living. That George was scarcely a fit mate for Miss Emma Fairfax, and that the Squire might suggest, the gover- . hess, little Miss Ivyieaf,sis a niore, suitable partner for him, never entered the doctor's head. If it had, he'would probably have scouted it aB absurd. In his estimation, no Woman /and no fa ture were too good for his ■ handsome, clever boy. ' All went well for a long time. George Blair went to Oxford, and took there a good degree.

The"managers glanced at one another, a little surprised. One of them, how ever, a Mr. Farther, who was one of Oaptaie Freelance's committee, feeling that something derogatory to his can didate. was intended, asked, " Well, and what of that ?" " What of that!" exclaimed Dr. Blair, forgetting discretion in his ex ultation. Why this : That woman was his victim! Listen, gentlemen; just ten years ago Captain Freelance came from India to bis uncle; Spuire Fairfax's. This woman was then gov erness to the Squire's daughter, and Freelance's future wife. Some months after his arrival everyone L notieed Miss Tvyleaf was looking ill—after the Captain's engagement was an nounced she became ill. When she veeovered a bit she left the squire's and nothing rnoye was heard of. her until to-day. Now the. boy is nine years old •' he must have been born montWafter she left ;Squire, Fairfax s; the only young man about Squire Fairfax's was Captain Freelance. Can you doubt the conclusion? Captain Freelance is her child's father." The managers looked, at one an other. The case certainly looked ^ black. *. • * '" I doii't believe it,'.' said. Mr Farther. " Captain Freelance would'be incapable of abandoning a girl under such circumstances to poverty." " Then get her to clear his rupu tation. Get. her to tell who the boy's father is." "So I will said Mr. Farther, dog gedly. " He felt very shaky as to Ms friend's innocence; hut then, unless the affair was cleared up, the captain's reputation was gone. If he were guilty, the truth could do him no more harm than would be done by allowing tbiugs to remain as they now were. Miss Ivyleaf by this time had, under the (are of the porter, begun to re cover*. "When she had regained her senses' she was brought back into the room, and Mr. Father commenced tq question her in a gentle toue.
