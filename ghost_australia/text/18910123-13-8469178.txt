A. Yarnold, carrying the Bishop of" Sydney s pastoral stuff, and the Rev. T. K. Taylor, carrying the Bishop of Melbourne's pastoral staff, passed up the 'nave. The Bishop of Melbourne's pastoral staff was recently presented to him by Lady Clarke, on behalf of the subscribers, and is a very handsome piece of workmanship. The top, which is of solid silver, SS shaped like a shepherd's crook, and bears a representation of St. Paul and of the system. Dei, with 'symbolical: tracery. The procession marched up the middle of the nave, singing Psalm xxiv., "The Earth is the Lord's, and the clergy took up the positions assigned to them. In ecclesiastical language, the transept in which the organ is placed is called the decent side, from the fact that the decorous, or dead, lins his stall there, while opposite is the cantons side, so called because the precentor, or cantor, is placed there. On the 'cantors side, then, of the sanctuary were stationed the Bishop of Tasmania, the Bishop of Bathurst, the Bishop of Riverina, the Bishop of Adelaide, the Bishop of Ballarat, the Bishop of Goulburn, the Bishop of Sydney, and the Bishop of Melbourne, while opposite to them were ranged their respective chaplains. The canons and archdeacons occupied the next seats, and further down still were the general body of the clergy, ' Minor-Canon Sutton, the precentor, being next to the pulpit, and the Dean of Melbourne next the lectern. The uniformity of the white surplices was broken all along by the many-coloured hoods indicating the different University degrees of this wearers, which ranged from the gorgeous robes of the doctor of divinity to the simple hood of a bachelor of arts. When the clergy and. the choir were in their places the Bishop of Melbourne read the prayer for the Governor, after which, while lift congregation kneeled, the hymn, " Come, Holy Ghost, Our Souls Inspire," was sung from the choir as a solo by it boy's clear soprano, with the whole of the voices joining in after the first, two verses. The title deeds of the land were then presented to the Bishop by Mr. W". Cain, chairman of the building committee, and were laid upon the holy table, after which the special prayers appointed for the occasion were read. Upon the conclusion of these the Bishop, preceded by the Rev. R. li. Taylor carrying the pastoral staff, and followed by the Rev. Canon Goodman and the Rev. D. M. Berry, his chaplains, visited the different points of I the cathedral designated for the performance of the seven! races at the church and pr nounced over each an appropriate Y verse of Scripture The font the lectern the pulpit the office of marriage and the place of confirmation were each visited in turn and the approaching, the holy) table the Bishop of Melbourne read special prayers and the Bishop of Sydney) invoked the divine blessing the sentence of con securities was next lead 1) Mr Justice Hodges the chancellor of the diocese, and was signed by the Bishop in 1 ordered to In held up in the system) among the muniments of the see and to be Measured the sentence of consecration MIS as follows \-- In the name of Col Queen YMieieni ME did Intel) receive the petition of the trustees of eel tam lind billie, Allot ments 1 and 20 of section li in the city of AIcllx urne YV which has been set apart" for the erection thereon of the cathedral church for the Diocese of Melbourne and a building intended to be the on their ml church of the s ral diocese and to be called and known as St Pauls Cathedral Melbourne his been erected on the stud land and the aforenamed trustees lime pulled that we would be pleased by virtue of our pastors!

The idea of universal betterment, the idea of equitable adjustment of hitherto contending or conflicting in terests the idea of social harmony are Christian ideas Apart from Christ's religion, however, these ideas cannot be permanently operative or fruitful there is JIO adequate motive power, no converting energy , no reconciling influence Self interest is not conquered , self sacrifice is not cultivated, the hopes and claims of a life beyond this bodily life are either neglected or denied and "dust to dust" ends all But the church's outlook (call it " tran- scendental" if men will, it does tran ascend all lower, earth bound hopes, call it " othervvorldlincss' if men will-it does look for something beyond this transitory) and limited life has an animating, a purifying, a coii8olmgpo"wer Based on the gospel of pardon and reconciliation, maintained by patient faith in Christ as Saviour, King, Judge , exhibited in a confident assurance of the triumph of good over evil, of justice over armistice, of God 's love over the mysteries of spiritual w ickedness-the Christian believe ers hope-and this is identical with the church s outlook, the redeemed soul is the unit of the elect society, which is the blessed company of all faithful people the Christians hope, I su), keeps philanthropy alive, checks and overcomes natural selfishness, cheers all who work for moral reformation, and still looks for the Lord, w hose right it is to reign, and who will judge the peoples righteously This hope, to be grasped b) individual faith, is not an isolated hope, a fantastic dream of some lonely) mystic enthusiast It is a common hope of all those who are con joined by faith in Christ " We look for new head ens, c " It is also a sure hope, for it is according to the promise of Him who cannot he and it is a patient trust in the Divine love which has been manifested in Christ Jesus Tor observe the way in which St Peter associates himself with the teaching of his brother Paul concerning the Divine long suffering "Where fore, beloved," he said, seeing that look for such things, be diligent that money be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless And account that the long suffering of our Lord is salvation, clears our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you " As if he would say, " Be not weary in the warfare, be not laughed out of j our hopes for the triumph of good, and the incoming of -the perfected kingdom Hope on, work on, strive on, grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour ' Salvation,' in its completed and widest sense, is the assured goal for all who visit our Lord " My brethren, in this Cathedral of St Paul I would emphatically) connect the words of " The Apostle of 1 aith " with those of " The 1 APOstle of Hope, and bid God speed to the Church of England in this diocese, is slung what it may from this consecrating and con crated day date a fresh start in church work, a fresh impulse to Christian effort, i i fresh inspiration of Christian devotion, H fresh strengthening of Christian charity May God help us all to do our best to leaven society with rather than more earthly arms and horses, while we show that Yvedonot deem that heaVenly mindedness means the neglect of earthly) duties and obligations.

Vont, lectern, pulpit, table have been respectively dedicated and blessed. Do not all the portions of this consecrated house tell of social functions and fellowship, illuminated, by the light of Divine love and truth? Do not all its services recognise, and require a community of faith, work, and prayer made possible, made fruitful, made effective!, by)' the Divine grace which, from the cradle to the grave, rests upon each member of Christ who does not repudiate had high and heaven born privileges, the grace which gradually shapes each living stone for the place which it has to occupy in the great spiritual structure which God is raising for a habitation of His glory and righteous- ness-shire " spiritual fitly framed temple, we herein shall be no walls of partition 1 " War are " brethren of a commonyife," children of one Father, disciples of one Lord, recipients of one Spirit 01 let us make hour strenuous endeavours to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, and to help each other onward by warning them that are in really, comforting the faint-hearted, supporting the weak, and being patient to all men. The very function of the church in the world is to keep the minds of men directed towards the highest ideal of righteousness, and to keep the hearts of men uplifted above the sorrows and sufferings of our lower life of probation, and thus to save society both from worse. degradation and from spiritual despair. This function the church discharges b) pro- claiming Christian faith, by propagating Christian conduct, by promoting Christian worship On that our branch of Christian Catholic Church, for which this Cathedral, this central sanctuary, is now constructed a fruit of labours past, a pledge of work and worship yet to come - may never fail to contribute its quota of faithful and loving service to the best interests of mankind by holding fast and holding forth the blessed hopes which God in Christ, by His Holy Spirit, has revealed and proffered and may there be among all who love the Lord Jesus, and look for Him, an increase of brotherly regard and concord) so that differing only where we must, find combining where we can, we may all be fellow workers in furtherance of the gospel, fellow soldiers in the conflict with the main fold forms and forces of evil around his, fellow helpers in all that makes for true social reform and harmony, and amid all disappointments and difficulties and delays, still according to God's promise, look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness At the conclusion of the sermon the offer tory was taken while the choir and congregation sang the hymn commencing "The Church's one found ition," and after the recital of the nra) er for the church militant, those who did not intend to communicate had an opportunity of retiring A The order of service for the holy) communion was then proceeded with Nearly 1,000 persons were communicants, the Bishop of Sydney and the Bishop of Melbourne, assisted by the other Bishops, administering the sacrament at the altar rails and also at second w) temporary rails which were erected at the entrance to the chancel It was a quarter to 2 o'clock when the Bishop of Sydney) pronounced the benediction and dismiss the congregation, choir and clergy marching in procession down the nave and out of the cathedral to the chapter house.

The seven years which he had spent in the supervision of the work had been indeed a labour of love (Hear, hear ) The Rev C 1 PhnKS also responded He said that the cathedral idea was first suggested in Bishop Perry s time about 33 years ago, and plans were prepared costing some thing like £600 but eventually they were not approved of, and the work had remained untouched until the present The work had been undertaken with the expectation that £10,000 could be raised towards it In the good providence of God that expectation had been i calmed, and the work had been paid for as it had been done and not one stone or one piece of turf er was the result of any fancy bazaar or fancy) fair on an) effort of that kind that was a fact for which with out savin,*/unvthmg against those who believed in those methods of raising money he was very thankful (Cheers) In speak ing of the liberality of those who is 11 tone they should not forget the late Mr 1 ease of Bishton, who left the whole of his proposal) to t! c Bishop of Melbo units fund and the Cathedral 1 and 1 mm that boat see the cathedral had realised JE. ) 300 YY the reWard to the workmen on the building he had never come in contact with a more industrious, straightforward sober lot of men in his life (He is, heard ; Mr. Justice hourS proposed the toast Our Visitors Visitors he said, should be welcome under any circumstances but they should be doubly no when they had come at a time lived by us and to serve our purposes It was desired that the consecration of the cathedral should be performed, so far as (unto beings could arrange it. in a manner worthy of the great old church of its great history, and of the second roll of its martyrs (cheers), and the friends from other colonies had come, at great inconvenience and trouble to themselves to assist in securing that result (Cheers ) The Bishop of SYDNEY said that Mr Justice Hodges had been amiable enough to suggest that the visitors had come purely from good nature but they had come to wit less a great spectacle and to take part in a most impressive ceremony) and they had done RO with great pleasure It was a fitting time now to announce that a telegram had been received from the Bishop of North Queensland con- veying his congratulations and expressing his regret that he could not be present The visitors had come as witnesses and also as well wishers They had seen some at least of the great features of the city and they were glad that it had now a c ithodial worthy of it (Cheers) in the capacity of well w Fisher he would propose the toast which had been entrusted to him which was the Bishop and the Diocese of Melbourne He was informed upon what he believed was reliable authority), that hewes speaking upon the only person of a very important day in the history of the church of Victoria Upon that day 48 ) years ago as he was informed the v venerated Bishop Per.) and the Venerable and Very Reverend Dean of Melbourne passed through the Heads on their way to Melbourne (Cheers ) Without going into detail he would ask them to contrast in their minds the Australia of that time and the Australia of to day and to say whether the change which had taken place did not afford great encouragement for the future (Cheers.) He had been told man address delivered to him in another diocese that as primate he was a living symbol of the unity of the church He hoped that he might consider that he was a symbol of the living unity of the church that the great church in Australia might be a living organism visited) the spirit of God and doing the service in the will in which He might point out (Cheers ) The Bishop of MKH30DTiNiî,'m expressing his thanks for the manner in which the toast had been proposed and honoured, said he was glad of another opportunity to impress upon the clergy and the laity of the diocese what the functions and objects and designs of the cathedral were. Some people thought that a cathedral was simply a big church, superior in excellence and beauty to the other churches in the diocese, but that was a very limited and'-- imperfect view. If the cathedral idea was' properly carried out it was to be a centre of counsel, of worship, and of work for the whole diocese It might be long before that ideal was realised, but that was what should always he kept before them as the standard of attain- ment. The cathedral should be a centre of living interest, of evangelising power, of encouragement and hope to all the people throughout the length and breadth of the diocese. With regard to a remark which had been made by Sir George Verdon, he would say that he hoped the cathedral pulpit would prove to be a means of advancing the study of sacred oratory amongst the clergy. The foundations of the church in Victoria had been laid broad and deep by the foresight and the statesmanship of Bishop Perry and such men as the late Sir William Stawell and Sir Robert Molesworth. Then the efforts made by Bishop Perry in order to get the cathedral idea turned into a reality were supplemented by the burning eloquence of his successor, Bishop Moor- house, and the work had been undertaken, the completion of which had just been witnessed. God had in the past raised up men able and willing to do his work, and that was surely an encouragement to hope that He would do so in the future, so that that work might be carried on and perfected. (Cheers.) The Dean of MELBOURNE, who was received with prolonged cheering, proposed "The City of Melbourne." distinguished literary gentleman had advised Australians not to blow, but really that was very foolish advice. Any man who had seen the progress of Melbourne for the past forty or fifty years would be very ungrateful if he did not speak of the wondrous things which God had done for the city and the people. But there was also warning in the reflecting on such great material prosperity, and a couplet of Pope's came to mind, " For Satan now is wiser than of yore, He tempts by ranking rich, not making poor." It was impossible to speak of Melbourne without speaking of the town clerk, a man who was always ready to show a kindness to a friend, and to give a ready and full answer to all opponents. (Cheers.) He had therefore much pleasure in coupling the name of that gentleman with the toast. (Cheers.) Mr. 15. G. FiTZQinBOV, the town clerk, responded. He said the city had to thank the church for giving to it one of its most glorious ornaments and one of its most beautiful possessions in the cathedral which had that day been consecrated. He hoped that the city of Melbourne would adopt for its motto that of the city of London, "Domine during nos." THE EVENING SERVICE. - An even more numerous congregation than that which had assembled in the morning attended the evening service, at which the procession of clergy was repeated, the press cessional hymn being " At the name of Jesus." The first lesson was read by the Bishop of Riverina, and the second by the Bishop of Bathurst. The musical portion of the service included Stainer's service in E flat, Ouselcy's anthem, "Great is the Lord," and the " Hallelujah Chorus," from Handel's " Messiah." The Bishop of BALLARAT preached from Ephesians iii. 21, "Unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end." The text led him to speak of cathedral worship. As God had made the earth beautiful it was proper for its people to ornament everything that was designed for the service of God. Unless this fair structure proved a home for true worship it could be nothing but a costly and pompous failure. God grant that within this lovely cathedral erected for His service this ideal might be abundantly realised. No true worshippers worshipped as an isolated community. Man's aspirations to God . as in his public and domestic life were entirely social. -For that reason a cathedral must be spacious, and thus it was necessarily costly, but on what better object could Victorian gold be * squandered. It was of glory to God not church this splendid cathedral spoke. It was the symbol of church unity in the diocese. The first Christian churches were cathedrals, indeed, the parish churches were but chapels of ease. There was a modern tendency to which -scripture gave noencourngementto contrast the church with Christ, and to exalt Christ at the expense of the church. But the church was Christ's body, and as such it was right that it should be beautiful and that beauty and order should prevail in its worship. Breath- ing in its very shape the story of the Cruel vision, every stone, - every, perform, every stained window, every utensil wore on it the sign of Christ's last dying gift.' The whole Cathedral seemed to cry Glory to God." In conclusion Dr. Thornton quoted ? John Henry Newman's sail but earnest impeach- ment of the Church of England as a church whose cathedrals were emblems of a dead faith. It was not so, In the present century' the Church of England had spent £-12,000,000 on building churches. It had erected 13 cathedrals, and four more were rising town. The service concluded with the benediction, pronounced by the Bishop of Sydney. THE OFFERTORIES. The offertory at the morning service amounted to 453 11s. . 10d., and at the evening service to 895 Os.- 10d., the total of £510 12s. Hil. _
