A- Miller made no secret oE.his belef that the former I "had a "real good chance,"' even despite the spongy course, -whichwas much, against I a heavilv weighted and rather long striding I horse like Xaraook. Harrison had not given. Dungan much, severe work during the week, and he looked all the better for it While i conceding that he looked a picture of condition critics would not giveMiim a chance over such i heavy countrj with. 12 st 9 lb; but they ' forgot thit lie i?ed splendidly m the mud when i he beat.T O L m the Onkapannsfa Steeplechase, and has on other occasions acquitted himself creditablv in damp going TlTe Ballarat pair, Dondi and Walter, bhowed/ evidence of careful training, and there was -<a small army of admn-pri from thfe golden ciiy to back them Mikado JX. whom Gardner delivered at the po^tin fine condition, was the subject of very solid support at the latt moment, the | idea being th.it as he is a safe jumper | ana hid a f comparatively light weight he I trouldbe sure to pjod with credit over the three miles, an3," especially if some of the others did not aett, well in the mud, nearly win limom's grey coat showed that [he had "done plenty of -work, and old, Songster, although despised in the betting-, I looked very fit J.OiCs appearance gaveJ general"3 satisfaction, and he -retained 'position in the -beirang—rnuiket up to the | flag fill Grandwing was" perhaps the -fittest horee in the race, and Mr J.

"? Had the race been ten' yards further Ximoni would probably have won, as the top weignff-nas showing signs oE distress and. Tiinom was beating him for pace. Itwisa tremendously popular win. 'Good horse, good owners," cried those^who had lost and those who had won; and the entnusiasm o£ the crowd was demonstrated again and strain The disappointment of the race was distinctly J.O I. When-'the field had gone two miles he was a, beaten horse, the accidents he had in the race being tho cause. Old Mikado II plodded along as expected, but the pace was too strong for him, and Grandwing needed a little more toe. ?" ~ The result? were as follows — J3PEX JHUBDLE EAC& _ 1-T.wo miles.
