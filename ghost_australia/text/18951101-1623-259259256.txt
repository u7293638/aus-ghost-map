She was Diana; the horse's name was " Satan." Diana loved Satan and Satan loved Diana. It was thought that neither of ithem loved any other living tiling,ami it was ,a certainty that no other living thing loved either of them. ! Diana pulled the rein and Satan stopped with one fore-foot uplifted. They looked like a ebony-slat ued Centaur, before tiiem the sun was setting—sinking, sliding down n liUle and a little into the tutherinost, edge of the plain. So su'iffy and red and so close to the dead grass it seemed it must s"t, is atire. behind them the blue, snow- line-', wall o£ the Sierras reached up to the Cionds. Tulare Lake glittered, and glowed, and burned iu the red sun-rays until its nunv league crystal bosom seemed struck by some midden transforming force of nature, and each single drop of wafer changed to diamond. I The. ebony Centaur let its foot, slowly to this ground ; it took oil its slouched hat, its four eyes looked straight into tie- /west. I A 11Etii\l scampered away, rustling the dry grasn with its scaly legs, a i-cpii:;.--J Vanished into its hole ill the ground, and f, jaek rabbit paused, in its gallop, nailed up on iis haunches, with ey,s ataaiding itepiiringly up ; its meek, surprise si eyes staled .is straight al i be I'ent aur aa those of tile «.'entaur stared into the west.

The halo of t.iu; sky Klipji al down to the earth and spread over the hot ground and. the I row n dead clover. It crept, to the b-et of the Centaur, and over its Idueii flossy hide, and stole into the lace of the woman. The scorn, the defiance laded out of it, t he hard hues of maseuiine force sofu- ned out of it. To meet the giow of a dead day came out the glow of a dead h: art. It touched her eyes with ils essence of soul, and lighted her features with the, pmcness oi the virtue that Iws chastened itself m fins smelling furnace ot oin. The Centaur wan ti uu.db. tired. A broad-branched oak - the only Dec for miles around - stood near; a man, followed by a sheep d.i.;. s'. pped from behind. He made no mase ana was not seen, lie was sun-in, i lied, and unshorn, and roughly garmented. There was an old twitching of the muscles ahotit, his mouth, and as he watched the pr,'ia.»s oi i ra.isl ormat ion in the woman's face, its spint haped into his own. I Without any c >nseious volition lie reached forth his hauls and cried out, " Diana. ' \'i'as it the rel! ction of the sunset in her chet ks, or simply returning animaiion, or did sac hear! j She touched the rein and Satan btunded forward, the ebony Centaur was a passive transligura!ion no longer. K was ngtiin the Rplendsl, scornful, d:limL creatine, hating humanity and smiting the earth with coiitempluous feet. T'.e man with the sheep-dog looked after her a lutlo while, then walked ^ioA-ly away, taking an op[M,site ilinyjtion. A voice, both jest and jeer, struck his cam j as he approached the door of tin: enigmatical construction buries,pied with the name ]of House,'' j "See, bill, wild ye, looks like he was walkin' home in the shadiicr of his colliu, and IShen sneaks along like he'd been ii- stealin' Bheep." | Tne ihan, to whom the words were addressed, looked out, then dropped his eyes and answered iu a lower tone and softer voice ;than I he other ; | " Don't j.,ke him tonight, brassy, he's iu one of his bad ways. i wouldn't wonder if he'd seen that wmm.u again, jit's enough to make one think she's a ghost haunting him the way lie looks alter he's jivti her."

Bill sat with bowed head, and whittled mechanically on a small pice- of stove-wo, and Dainty held a cigarette carelessly lwtween his thumb an 1 forefinger, and id .w contented little pull's of smoiie away front his mouth.

With one accord Bill and Brassy caught Dainty and hoisted him into tiie forks of a huge soiling, by the side of which they stopped, ami seiioded up after him.
