SCENES Arms SKETCHES OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE. BY "BUSH NATURALIST." REDDICK THE STOCKMAN. CHAPTER XI. OLD THREADS PICKED UP. WE, who had accidentally met in that for off Gulf homestead after the fatigue of a hot summer day, spent a pleasant and sociable evening chatting about old times and places Some chance avoid brought up the name "Sil coates," and that led to the discovery that Mrs Thornley was no other than Helen Bambridge, the self named heroine of the opening chapter of this story . Although, as a schoolboy, I had learned something of his story in connection with the gipsy's prophecy, jet were we perfect strangers to one another But it is curious how, in Australia, a very little circumstance, if in any way connected with our life in the old country, will cause a feeling of friendship to sprung up 'There is a romance, a hill, um un ing to us of our young life, although in a reality we all of us have left the old for this new world on purpose to better our sell as I have, in the early days of the Ladies and long-tom, seen strong rough diggers crowd round and be quite delighted at the sight of an English daisy, placed on view on a gin case in front of a canvas 01 action dubbed hotel And this simple little How ci caused a fraternising among these strangers which of course ended in their going in and having a drink '-the very object aimed at by the enterprising landlord the same respect I have been given to, incline same plea sure choked by, a draggle tailed specimen of a pool caged English robin, and I, myself, lune w allied ten miles on purpose to lieu the song of the sky 1 ink in Australia, although, alas it came from a cage and not from the skies So it was no wonder that, "Yoikshnc having once come up as a topic of com ci saturn, the rescue of strangers should vanish and we all feel like old friends It is not for me to judge whether Helen Dam budge made the ambitious in mi age she contemplated when she rejected Richard Wynn, but from her I learned that He Thornley had for many years been a squatter in Victoria, but that shortly after she had missed him, and had come out to these colonies to the, things had begun to go hard with pistol alists in that colony. The wave of free selection had reached his run and he had suddenly found himself left with a homestead area only on which to give several thousand head of cattle So he had sold off the most of these and started for Northern Queensland with the present lot, or rather he started them on before, and had with his wife, joined company with his di of ci at Aramac Of course during the evenings conversation I was asked as to what I thought of Jack Ralph's jam about the Dead Finish haunted camp This was a rather a post to me, for, although personally I had never seen the ghostly stockman in common with all old residents in the district, I had heard so much about it from persons who could not be accused of wilful attempt to durne, that I li id come to believe there might be some found it ion to the story Moreover, I knew for certain that little would never lamp voluntarily upon that plain, even in the daytime, although it was one of the most tempting places upon that end of the i in Iuciuii les as to the ghost brought up the name of Red Dusk, and this led to my telling to the stranger his historis as far as I knew it, since his cngn{,inicut with Hi Stapleton Mrs Thornley took great interest in the poor follow , she could not explain why But she expressed her opinion that he is as a hue fellow, adding " He must have been crossed lose I dont belies c ho over committed in) crime A man is only rescued about his past life when a si era in is at the bottom of his trouble "1 minute agree with you, Miss 1 how nice, ' I i replied, ' Dnk ss is too o\ cn In u did not too kind

impossible, and turned the conversation But you not till me that that hon. id mm Brooks, who kept the Dead 1 finish Hotel, was the teacher who was a reported for nearly killing some of my father's Josephs "Yes I should not co have known it, although remember well the excitement caused among us both by the nests of tin and it, had hit him self not told me When he found out I was from federates

the gipsy s no place , but she did not raise hot e) es to enable me to judge of her present filling towards her old son either t, st hen, host is ei, I replied in the negative there was a touch of strong pathos in the tone in which she said "Pool Indi I should dearly like to know Thus, no talk about olden ] Kies the evening passed quickly) and is Mr Bromley ridiculed the idea of any d nice to his cattle for our ghostly crisis, with all tin in dam of i stein remedial ist, and he pressed me to come and spend the nightsoil him at the haunted camp, and so banish for ever from my mind the remnants of old Yorkshire superstitions, which he said he could detect still to have slight hold of my mind I willingly accepted the invitation, for a friendship had sprung up between us nil, and the thought of another evenings friendly conversation was pleasant to one st be, like myself, had such lonely times of it in general But, independent,, of this, I had previously decided to camp with the cattle, for, ghost or no ghost, I quite expected there st would be a "smash in the mob, and I wanted to be at hand if such a thing did happen Upon making known my intention, Mrs Thor ley warmly seconded her husband's ins tation, saying "Thank you, Mr. Cooper , I am sure you will not accuse me of chatter y at her I say that both my husband and myself will be very glad of your company For, although I too join with Mr 1 hot pies in laughing at your ghostly ride, it will be pleasant to spend another evening in talking over old times and old ev cuts Besides, not withstanding my dis belief in the supernatural, it is rather net sous work sitting iii) "i this lonely bush waiting for a demon stockman to appeal and disperse cattle " And so it turned out that on the afternoon of the third day from the arrival of the strangers I found my) self riding through the belt of twenty has miles of sea hubby country ; that intervened between the homestead and the old site of the Dead Finish hotel CHAPTER XII VOICES OF THE, MUTIMER IN AUSTRALIA IT IS impossible for even such a lover of natural beauty as an) self to call that twenty five miles' race from the station to the old Dead Finish hotel an interesting one The brigalow and girls scribes are quite as di cary in appearance as thou congeners the malice of the South, yet they are totally different in in habit Moreover, there are not wanting signs to show that much of this scrub sins flooded land Indeed, at Enter s also there st would be a break in the scrub, and then that still more desolate looking description of country which is covered with the Hooded book, as it is commonly called coolibah-st could be in acted upon This coolibah is an unfailing sign that some time or other flood so after s stn round it It may not be so every j eat, or even over two years, but where it is growing there the flood will come Much of the lot of country that encircles, for a hundred miles back, the southern end of that great gulf-Cal pental la is, during the wet season, under water In fact, the many once mous i is ci s t line here find their way into the sea so split up into mine member anabranches, so that there is a perfect network of rivers, and the states of the Dalby, Flinders, Roi man, Leichhardt Gregory, and Albert may almost be said to, at times, join together It thus happens that, during the dry season, the traveller finds himself in hoping for scores of miles over country which is a real fresh water sea in the summer time High over his head can be seen the debris left by the last flood waters huge logs 50ft up in atlee folk, vast accumulations of grass, branches, and rubbish, and, maybe, the di fed up as cases of cattle and horses I nos ci yet rode through similar flooded land without it creating on Intense feeling of depression in ino. It has a peculiar crushing effect upon the mind as if nature were matter of the position, and man pow eiless Jack Kalin * fear of being caught in the flooded lands of the Alexandra Lagoon country was no imaginary one. I was near Christmas time, and the summer i alias might set in any day Then woe betide the drover who cannot had a comfortable and extensive sand ridge upon which to camp for the next two or three months ' With the exception of the Dead Finish plain I do not think there was a single such sandridge between the old hotel site and the homestead of the station I had been on an oiling west all the afternoon that means with the hot setting sun full in the face - and this is always a fatiguing nile Moreover, in the northward heavy cumulus clouds were piling one over the other, and the growing rumble of the distant thunder was almost constant The an was close and muggy, and altogether I felt tired and fatigued to more than an ordinary degree by the time the covered waggon of my of Friends was to be seen snugly camped at the Dead 1 must write Hearty and cheery was the welcome which I got from my host of the camp, and I was soon served with a car) (not a pint-pot, as is the right thing for addressers outfits) of good tea which, together with those delicate morsels, the pink eyed wild duck and light fresh scene, was put before me in a st) It of comfort t unusually seen by us pool Gulf residents especially at a camp here The cattle, which had been kept grazing upon the little plain until after sundown, in order that then appetites might be full) satis fled, so that they would be inclined to camp steadily) all the night through, were gently moved up to then allotted camping place and by dark had all quietly settled down in that regular way cattle get into of the ii n) w ceks' droving Jack Rush was absent His occupation was not that of drover in charge, but that of pioneer, and, acting in that capacity he had gone on ahead to reconnoitre the route through the scrub, and to see if he could find any w used nearer than the twenty five mile creek He had told All reports) that he could not possibly be back before daylight, but that he certainly would be back by that time, for it was absolutely necessary that an early start should be made in order to October the di) stage "I only hope you will have the cattle to start with, but I very much doubt it," was his parting remark to his employer The truth was that Jack was really glad to get away from the haunted camp, it was not the man to have made an excuse for absenting himself, yet he was very well pleased that it was impossible for him to be present "Well," he said to himself as he rode away and turned his horse's head westwards towards the scrub, " I'm did glad to be away , for if this pig- headed new chum squatter, with his fal de Rays and white Mary is able to count a hundred of those cattle to morrow morning my name is not Jack Kalsh Hovvev ci I have my w utter agreement with mc nil light enough He says he is a luateuulist-whitevei that is and that then is nothing beyond this life and this was of the sum he has never had the honors' That s certain Well, I'll get back as soon as I can and help the poor fool to collect the stragglers again, but it will be a bad job, for the wet season will catch us and that Diamantina mob will get the country after all " The part) now camped at this ill-favoured Dead Finish we are hole consisted of the squatter and his wife, seven w lost men, four bl fickle) s, and myself, so that as far as numbers went we w ci c quite strong enough to fight in any of ghosts truth to tell, the thought of the phantom stockman did not see loins) enter for one moment into the heads of all of the late men of the pin t> with the exception of ' Mick," who acted is took and as driver of the hill) The half dozen young men now doing duty is stockmen were all more or less " educ died and were either learning "colonial ex] chance' as apprenticeship to squatting life is termed -or had lately) emerged from that the sales staff, and now were going showing on their own account that is, they were paid full di over s wages It was with the in as with most of us they were perfectly) sceptical us to the appearance of ghosts Pi constant teaching th it is, education since the days of Luther having so completely) ignored the latest possibilities of the extra round me being demonstrable to an unkind by ing upon our til at the present ii i), it is not will pi is ing that we never gave the subject of this h united camp the thought which it would have been judicious to li ive done even if acting only upon the old assertion that there now is is some foundation for ever) Junior If it had not been for a) strong expostulations Mr 1 how they would not even have Kept an extra horse saddled and tied to a is finely set up I urged him to this course, for I said that, ghost or no ghost, the spot was one of those upon which little novel would camp quiet) Wh), I could not say, but it was in fact which, as Brannigan of the city, I could I vouch for " Moi c over said, " that Uiiimleisloini which they have been getting ill afternoon over four luton is just as likely as not to wheel round and full upon us about midnight, uid)ouhivc notice experienced the violence of one of our local II til f tornadoes The cattle n t bound to split if it comes I confess, I continued, is I looked in and at the dense sea is menacing the stn ill plain, "I do wish you were well out of this it up and just the Alexandra Lagoons ' "Ah well, Mr Cooper, those in difficulties in which I can quite appreciate join anxiety on my behalf, and I think you for your 1 mil wish, but don t for one moment think that I edit the bad repute of this jib up as a cattle camp to the ghost of your f iv out to stockman It is most likely because soon enable opossum has its home in one of those old gum trees, and that he will persist in scampering through the mob and on to their backs, or some such a star al reason 1 also, like you have known these peculiar spots upon which cattle would never came quietly, and most of the old di over s of the bush will tell you the time Mr Bell, who had charge before I joined the cattle told me that on the Marana a is a small) li muted spot to this one, and that he camped with these ever) cattle upon it, but the only haunting the watchmen saw were a larger number than is usually to be seen of a kind of animal some what larger than, and not unlike, a rabbit, and which lives in burrows in the ground In fact makes a regular warren, and one of these was rons happened to be in the centre of the camp, and as the little hopping animals popped out of and into their holes they disturbed the cattle considerably) The turnout in this case was that a hawker, when camped there, had been murdered by his man, who buried him in these warrens, and departed with horses, waggons, and goods " It was about 9 o'clock Supper had been over and all things put away small) for the night The two young men on whom devolved the care of the cattle during the middle watch had turned iii" under their mosquito nets for no one, whether master of man, travels in the Gulf country in the summer time without this necessary) not luxury 1 he blackboys also w co of sound asleep But the best of the party had drawn together near the life, not for the sake of its warmth, but because of the feeling of sociability it engenders among us as ellet s and strangers, alike in the lone Australian bush and in the comfortable hostelry of the British Isles Social distinctions between master and man were not, at the date of my story, kept up when upon a droving journey In dress there was no difference , all being clad in the invaluable mole trousers, crimean shirt, and wideawake hat, and the supper that had been spread upon the ground was for all alike, the only difference from the usual bush custom being that cups and other crockery took the place of the uni v ei sal pannikan and tin plate Miss 'B Thornley, shower or, generally had her meals over before the stockmen were freed from their duties It thus fell out that after supper the subject of the ghost was common talk among the party Aiomaikof mine, that this outbreak of what is called " modern spy least" seemed to render so the now disbelieved ghost stories of olden time had been replied to by Mr Thornley with a crushing materialistic argument, when Mick, the horse driver, joined in with "Begging' your pardon, sin, them's might) big vv of his your honour 's mouth can spake, but what about the Sydney ghosts and that was seen sittin upon a three rail fence, and could who murdered him " " Only some old hands j are, I suspect. Mick " " Yarn or no yarn, the police dug the body up, hanged the man then in' villin, and thin he confessed , so that as no } at u about it, for Pat O'Rafferty tould me he saw him hanging " As oar of laughter followed this genuine bit of Ilibciniamsni, which had the natural effect of rousing Mick's tempora bit and he said, Och! the saints preservers I You may laugh, but maybe jell laugh the other side of your mouth before morning. Divil a bit I see what's to laugh at " Another outburst of laughter followed this speech The master now thought it time to pack) the excitable fellow, so he said, "Did you not notice, Mick, that you said the) hanged him Hist and he confessed afterwards' That's what made us all laugh But, Mr Coops, do you know anything about that old he dney am ? I have heard of it, but never can sided the matter worthy of a second thought " Strange as you may deem it, as, I can assure you that it is a fact. What Mick says is quite true, barring the hanging before confess sion The whole case is on record in the police annals of New South Wales, and no mate realistic hypothesis has ever been able to account for it " Before the squatter could find time to utter any cynical reply to mv remark, the Irishman aguiniluincdin with, Herrin save us' There's the dogs a howling already By the powers, I wish I was at Jamieson's in Normanton. It's a foin big nobbler I'd be a-takin' of. " There was no reply to this speech, and I doubt not others of the party would have liked the same, form from the edge of the su us there suddenly arose that peculiarly dismal howling cry club interests of the Australian dingo has, the only e.uiusoious animal in Australia that is not a marsupial, never talks, but gins voice to a most distressing!) mournful and pi belonged host you rather wait I know hardly any thing so depressing in its effects upon the camper out as is this any of the wild dog It is impossible to hear it composedly It always it cites a shudder, and when, during the stillness of night time in the Australian woods, the solitary Slatehill m who has the care of the camp upon his mind, and whose senses are strained to their utmost in order to detect the presence of unknown dangers from hostile man, is suddenly saluted by this miserable wall, it is no wonder that a ' cold in cap" runs through his back bone as he takes a burning ember from the fire and built it in the direction of the offending dingo in the Gulf district dingoes, a few ) years ago, st ci e set j numerous, moiesothinm any other part of Australia I have been in 'the reason it is that they had never been poisoned, and the natural fertility of the land caused an abundance of their food in the shape of gi emus pigeons, turkeys, emus, and then eggs and young, and also innumerable i its So it is as no uncommon thing for the party to bottles and see them, in fact, it was a night 1) grim Fence, but on this particular night around again, from all round the camp, time this wailing notes, one replying to another " Holy Virgin, protect us!
