In our standing notice concerning the timo of closing of the English mad at Brisbane, we last month gave that time as the 11th of July, though the mail did not actually close till 8 o'clock on the following morning j and this month we have stated the time to bo the 8th of August, though letters will be receired up to 7 o'clock on the morning of the 9th. We believe that in this way we havo better advised our readers, especially those at a distance, than if we had stated that the-mail would leave Bris- bane on the 12th of July and the 9th of August, respectively, as we could not state the hour, and many would bo led to believe that letters would be in time up to any hour on those days, when in point of fact they would only bo so if in the office at a very early hour of tho morning. ____________________________________ We regret to learn that a severe accident occurred on Saturday evening to an old and much respected fellow-colonist — Mr. Perrin who was driving home from town with his wife, when some connecting bolt about the buggy got loose ; the horse became restive and bolted, and Mr. and Mrs. Perrin were violently thrown out, near O’Reilly’s Hill, on tho Breakfast-creek road, the horse at the some time freeing himself of the buggy. A son of Mr. Phillips, of Breakfast creek, found the old couple bleeding and insensible in the road, and while he was endeavouring to restore consciousness to them, and washing the blood and dust from their faces, a dray going to the German Station came up ; the suffers were put on it, the buggy hitched on behind, and the party soon reached Mr. Perrin’s residence, where kind neighbors were quickly busy in affording the necessary- attentions. The two men in charge of the dray, not content with finishing the best part of a quart of whisky, and consuming sundry eatables which were in the buggy, were outrageously brutal and noisy in their demands for money for their services, and could only be be got out of the house by having a pound note handed them. Sundry articles of grocery in the buggy, and all the loose cash in Mr. Perrin’s, pocket totally disappeared during the accident. We treat the class of Samaritans to which these men belong is a very limited one. To most men, the notion would have been its own reward ________________________________________ It will be seen from our advertising columns that the Monday Penny readings at South Brisbane have been postponed until the Wednesday following, when an entertainment will be given, at which His Excellency the Governor has signified his intention of being present __________________________________ A Lecture will be delivered at Christchurch, tomorrow evening, by the Rev. C. Searle, It is entitled, “A few words about woman.” ________________________________ The keeper of Bowen Park, when making his usual inspection of the fences on Sunday morning discovered that one of the society’s herd of fellow deer had been shot during the previous night. In the course of the day Messrs Bernays, Abbott, and other gentlemen interested in the preservation of imported game, visited the park with the view of finding evidence, if possible, which might lead to the discovery the fellow who perpetrated the dastardly act. From the position of the poor animal, it had evidently carried to the spot where it was found ; and it is presumed that the carcases off, when either he was disturbed or found it too heavy for him. — It unfortunately happens that the animal the animal selected for this wanton slaughter was one of the tamest and handsomest of the herd. It fed from the keeper's hand, and was much admired for its beauty. In our adver- tising columns a reward of £5 is offered for in- formation which will lead to conviction of the offender j ond, as it is the interest of every good colonist to assist the Acclimatisation Society in preserving the game which it has imported at considerable expense, we hope soon to hear that the perpetrator of this act has received the full penalty which the law can deal out for such offences. Passekgibs by steamers appear to be fond of risking their lives by trying to get ashoro before the vessel is properly berthed, in the same way that railway travellers used, some years ago, to endanger their limbs by jumping out of tho train while it was in motion. With railways much mischief has been averted by locking the passengers up, and not opening the carriages until the train had come to a stand still. In the case of steamers this mode of pro- ceeding íb impracticable, and passengers should exercise more caution than is usually displayed. The anxiety to land is natural enough, but should not bo carried beyond the bounds of prudence as many accidents-some of them fatal-have rcsnlted therefrom. On Saturday morning an accident of this kind occurred at the A.S.N. Co.'s wharf, just after the arrival of the Clarence, s., from Rockhampton. A plank had been laid to enable some of the crew to land and fix the passengers' landing stage, when a passenger named Betz made a rush to get ashore by it» although previously cautioned not to do so. Ho missed his footing, fell into the river, and hada narrow escapo of drowning, as the night was dark. A rope was promptly thrown to him, ', we I and he was got out, with no worse hurt than an t the I involuntary cold bath on a chilly night. A coitPUMENTAET benefit is announced to take place this evening at the Victoria, Hall, to Miss Creed Boya!, who for some time past has been playing in this city. As an actress of con- siderable merit, united with musical attainments of no mean order, we trust she moy receive a bumper house. Ïhe'performances at the Alexandra Theatre went off exceedingly well on Saturday evening, before a good audience. The " Drunkard's Doom" and the " Limerick Boy " were the pieces produced, which, with the usual interlude, gave great satisfaction. The football match which was to have come off on Saturday last, was unavoidably postponed in consequence of the non-attendance of many of the gentlemen who were to take part in it. A scratch-match was, however, got up, and, as is frequently the case in scratch matches, afforded some excellent play. The sides were chosen by Messrs. Johnson and Davidson, the latter being victorious, kicking two goals, their opponents having to be content with a cipher. A match will be played in the park on Saturday week, between thirty of the Grammar School boys, who are to have the assistance of their masters, and fifteen members of the Eootball Club, and a scratch match on next Saturday. On Saturday, a little boy, about three years old, the son of Mr. Poole, the bootmaker, was frightfully torn by a newfoundland dog. The nose was almost bitten off, and a portion of the skin torn off the forehead. The life of the child Í3, we believe, not seriously endangered, but the face is wounded so severely that in all proba- bility the scars will never be obliterated. The dog was afterwards destroyed. The treasurer of the Lady Bowen' Hospital desires us to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt (anonymously) of £3 from " A Sailor." Akuot/3 to prove that the much abused " time gun " is a useful instrument, a correspon- dent forwards us a letter setting forth lengthily ¡ts claims to public admiration, on the score of its having frightened away the hawks which used to infest tho city and suburbs. Perhaps it ha«, but it is rather early in the year to say so positively ; and even if it does this good work, it would do so quite 03 well, we suppose, if fired punctually. A HBEWERY has been lately established at Clermont, and the local journal speaks in favor- able terms of the porter, which is described as being light, but likely to improve with age. A petition from 109 inhabitants of Bomo, headed by the Mayor of that town, has been, or is about to be, forwarded to His Excellency the Governor, asking that certain lands in that vicinity, amounting to about 112 square miles, and suitable for agriculture, shall be declared open io free selection. Amongst others, the following arguments are advanced by the peti- tioners :-" That the best of the lands (to wit, nearly all the water frontages) on the Darling Downs are already alienated, and that it daily becomes more difficult for persons desirous of settling in that district to make suitable selec- tions. That there is already in this towu and surrounding district a large floating population, who aro bound to it by tios of interest, con- nection, or association, and who would, if facili- ties existed for obtaining land by conditional purchase, settle in this neighborhood ¡ but who are at present debarred from so doing from the want of such facilities, the only method open to them being to purchase at public auction, whereby they would in many cases bo obliged to expend their total means in paying for the land, and thus prevontcd from making any use thereof after purchasing. That the present Boma Town Beservo is in most part quito un- suitable for settlement, being destitute of water except in the main creeks. That on two of these creeks- viz., Bungeworgorai and Cattle Station Creeks-where the best land is situated, tho whole being surveyed into lots, is thereby excluded from purchase. That there does exist in flin immediate neighborhood of the nrcsent reserve land pre eminently adapted for such settlement as that before referred to situated on Bungeworgorai and Chinchinbilla Creeks " Retci^ of the out door relief for tho wcok ending July 29 1S60 -Widows 47, children 111, infirm through old ag», men 8, women 16, wives who«e husbands are m gaol, 2, children 4, deserted wives 14, children 34, families relieved on account of sickness, women, 28, chüdren SO , families relieved fathor seeking work up country, women 9, children 29 Total-men, 8, women, 116, children, 261. The Warwick correspondent of the Gatetle says -"The Southern Railway and its branches bave been occupving tho attention of the pubho during the last week, and a petition, nume- rously signed, has been forwarded to the Go vernment, in favor of the extension of tho line from Ipswich to Brisbane This is a step in the right direction, which is warmlv approved of bv almost cvervone-the exceptions being only those who make it their delight to growl at progress in any form or shape People in Warwick are looking forward to the completion of the line from Allora in the hope that busi nels will then improvo, for as yet we have received verv little benefit from the railwav bevond getting our goods up quicker (but cor tainly not cheaper) than by the old system " Thb Levburn correspondent of the D D Gazette writes - We have verv httlo doubt of this proving a lucrative locstion especially if the reports latclv curront from the various prospecting parties that a payable and extensive gold field is still believed in bv at least fiftv prospector«, who somehow continuo to find enough gold to keep them going and who are not tempted to leave by tho various glowing ac counts from the other rich gold fields We learn that there aro about twenty five at the Seventeen mile diggines, ohieflv prosp'ctmg the heads of the Macintyre Brook, where a very superior coarso gold is found Al-o, that in everv gullv, except one, which descends from the dividing range of Sandy Creek, Maeintvre Brook, and Pike s Creel, gold has been found, which indicates a reef somewhere on the ridge, and when this is found, doubtless it will cause a «ensation New Chum Hill, on Talgai, is hav- ing a tunnel driven into it, to meet the reef, by a party who are working night and oav, and who expect to strike tho reef in a verv few davs, having gone already upwards of sixty five feet It is only reasonable to «uppo«e that the party m question havo good grounds for sup- posing that their labor will not be in vain It has al«o been reported ra town that a reef about three miles from the town has been found, with gold in it Wo havo plentv of reefs m our immediate neighborhood which bavo not been properly prospected, and which, if only capi- tal and labor were expended, might turn out pavable, if not as payable as Gympie So that on the whole I «hould not be surprised if, bo fore Tery long, you have to report good gold news from this district " Tni Bulletin «tates that the Rosewood Cop per Mme promises to turn out a valuable pro pertv The owners, Messrs Fisher and Co, have taken up a 40 aero mineral section Thev have sunk a shaft 35 feet with a drive 12 feet each wav There are thirty five tons of good ore to grass A chimnev stack 30 feet high has been erected, the bed of one furnaco has been laid, and the furnaco will be readv for use m a fortnight A second furnace will be commenced shortlv There is a good supplv of lime stone, fire clay, buildme stone, and timber on the spot The onlv thing wanting is water, which cannot be obtained within half a mile of the works This diihcultv mav po««iblv be obviated by sinking The first drays with smelted ore from this mine may be looked for m Rockhamp ton in about three weeks Mr Fisher has offered £4 a ton for copper ore, and a number of men are out prospecting for copper Speci- mens of ore are continually being brought m The gold digging communitv on that gold field scarcelv numbers 100 men at pre«ent Some peoplo in this colony oro very fond of defining-and that very narrowly- the limits of the country m which it is possible to success fully prosecute agriculture They tell us that in only such and Buch places is it possible to grow anything except grass Pacts constantly occur to refute such assertion», and, accepting the following as a correct statement of what can be done in the neighborhood of Condamine, we have one more proof that as yet nobody knows where in Queensland agriculture might not be a successful industry, if roads and railways were only pushed on as they should be m a new country The Condamine correspondent of the Dalby Herald writes -"Let us have only a suitable season, and I defy any place I have «een to produce the usual culinary vegetables, or, indeed, I may add, cereals, m greater per- fection than Condamine does I am led to this conclu«ion by a visit I paid this week to Mr Ind's garden, m this township At the supper table at Host Wallace's I fell m for a feed of cauliflower, which unexpected addition to bush fare I found came from Ind's cabbage garden, so I was more inclined to take a look at it And on the morrow I went ' Good day .' said I to the little fellow whom I found grubbing away at a potatoe plot ' Is this Mr Ind's ?' ' Tes ,' rephed the little fellow ' Will you walk in '' As I came on purpose, m I walked, and began to look about me The little fellow went on digging, and left me to mv«elf As it was rather early, I quietly trotted up and down the walks between the beds, of about an acre of well tilled ground, and saw-on infinity of cob bages, of all «ort», among winch I recognised the Braganza, Savoy, Early York, Chine-e, and even the monstrous Drumhead But the cauli- flower was what principally attracted mv atten- tion I had seen in the old country some prize vegetables, but I conld not help feeling that Condamine could carry away the prize m this article, oven from the old country Row upon row of the«e delicious articles met my eve , and one particular monster I could not avoid mea Buring, I found it occupied at lea«t three square yards of ground ' And there were many more almost as large Onions, with stems already nearly as thick ns my wrist, and giving promise of brobdignagian proportions, next attracted me Then mustard, the common white mnstard, seven feet in height, peas, in full bearing, quit? as tall, Swede turnips, each a feed m it'el'3\ Bpinach, broad beans, ¿c, Ac , occupied each its separate plot of ground, and, full of the un- expected oasis in the desert, I turned to the little gardener who still kept digging on, and asked, ' Where is Mr Ind ?' ' I am Mr Ind,' said the gardener, and I collapsed I apolo- gised as soon as possible, and a hearty laugh from Mr Ind put me at mv ease But I can not help saymg that if he is as much of a teacher a3 he is a gardener, Condamme mov be proud of him While I stood talking (for Ind could talk as well as work), a youngster carno with ' Mr Harns'B compliment», and would Mr Ind give him a cauliflower to tala > to Dalby,' which, as a matter of cour«4o.TEl/ he did, picking out a plumper Off "* went the httle fellow as well as ho was able, but the large cauliflower upset his centre of gravity and tumbled him over, and ho was con- strained to call for aid to his brother , the scene reminding mo »omewhat of that visited bv the Hebrew spies, when one bunch of grapes re quired tv* o men to carry it Certainlv it was the first time that I «aw a cauliflower requiring two boys to carry it As my vi it was most cursory, and I had not time nor opportunity to inquire how this profitable re«ult in gardening was obtomed, I cannot explain tho fact I can only add that 03 the man said, in replj to the assertion, who was confined ia the stocks, ' They cannot put you m the stock«,'-' But I am here1' So I «ay, 'It is so, however it was brought about' I find that, although first Mr Ind is not alone in his gardening vocation, Mr Jone«, the blacksmith, nas potatoes equal in every respect to Hobart Town ones, and Mr Bayley has oats and lucerne which tend to prove tho assertion with which I started " We (Bulletin) are informed that Mr Dain- tree intends on his return to Bockhampton, to devoto two months to an examination of the geological character and features of this district We hope that ho will extend his «tay over tkree or four months The Bev W B Clarke ren- dered great assistance to the miners in the early aovs of the gold workings of New South Wales He pointed out several of the be«fc gold fields before a pick had been stuck in the grouna on mern, ana nis explorations lurnianeo. information which directed labor and capital mio profitable channels What was done in Kew South Wales may be repeated here We also want a Government a=sayist, resident in the district The charges for assays would amply repay the Government, and the development of the mineral resources of tho district would be greatly assisted Mr Jardine has written to the Government strongly urging the appoint- ment of an assavist A sample of quartz from the Welcome reef was shown to Air Daintree, and that gentleman expressed his conviction that fully one half of tho gold in that descrip- tion of stone was lost by tho present defectiva appliances for extracting the gold Our reefers and crushing companies and miners, would gladly pav a moderate fee to have samples of gold assayed, and they would derive some satin faction in learning tho true value of their stone Copper and other numeral specimens, which are being picked up almost daily, could be tested, and prospecting and mining enterprise would be greatly stimulated We commend this subject to the attention of the Government and our members of Parliament Tni following remarks, by the Peale Downs Telegram, are worthy the notice of soms of our Northern contemporaries -" There can be no question that separation would free the North from habdity for the Southern railway debt, and allow of lessened taxation or a considerably in- creased expenditure on public works But the questions with us are, can we get separation ? Where shall the dividing lina be drawn ' and - would the countrv drained by the Fitzroy and its tributaries bo to the north or south of that line ' It would be wor'e than useless to assist the North in getting separation, unle»3 we could go with the North, and not remain wuh the South Draw the dividing line anvwhere north of Moreton Bay, and there will bo sub- stantial grounds for complaint on the part of somj of our fellow-colonists Cut off all the country north of the so called Southern dis- tricts, and Queensland will be too small Draw the line westward from Dawes Range, and Maryborough will bo left helplessly at the mercy of Brisbane Start from Cape Pal- merston, and Rockhampton, with ita im- mense back districts, will be in an almost equallv helpless position Indeed, the strongest argument against separation is the probability that Cape Palmerston will be m the latitude of the future boundary If this be so, it would be wise to pauso before throwing in our lot with the Kennedv and Burke people Let them agitato for separation, bv all means, and may their efforts be ultimately crowned with success. But unless it can be made prettv clear that Port Curtis, Leichhardt, and Mitchell would participate in the benefits ar sing from the creation of a new colony, it will be folly for the inhabitants of those districts to agitate for separation It may be a selfish view of the matter, but our opinion is that if we cannot get rid of our liability on account of the Southern loans, wa ought not to assist the people further North in shaking off that responsibúitv By their action in compelling the resignation of Mr Fitzgerald, thev have precipitated extreme measures, for had the late member for the Kennedv been in his place when Mr Lillev's local government scheme was discussed, there is little doubt that the majority of one would have been in favor of, instead of against the scheme We now,

scenes of terrible crimos, ana not a fow having some ghostly legend connocted with them The latest claimant for this unonviablo distiuc tion is a placo near Young, in Now South Wales The Burrangong Argus says - " In theso enlightened times it Boems almost nn absurdity to talk about ghosts making their appearanco, but the following statement of what has befallen three respoctablo mon resid ing noar Young 19 authentic, and may bo relied upon by our readers as boin no hoax 'Hie three men referred to aro splitting postB and rails for fencing, at a placo about four miles from Young, near the Throo milo and the old Duffer Rush Tbo first time thoy saw anything unusual was on one moonlight night, about three weeks ago, when thoy wero much startled by seeing m tho bush near thoir hut, a wluto object about tho size of a cat, but of no particular form This extraordinary looking objoct Bud deuly boforo their eyes sprung up into a white spcotro about eight feet high They called out to it, but could got no reply, struck it with a stiek, and it soundod hollow It also chased two of them one way, and one another On another occasion they retired to bed at tho usual hour on a calm, still night, went to sleep, slept for some time, and upon ono waking up during the night, ho was much Burpnsed to fiud that tlio whole of the roof of tho hut had been removed On looking out tbey saw the spectre, but noone else was about, and thoy are eil quite suro that neither on this nor the former occasion was it either a man or a woman Its suddenly rising before their eyes from a mere nothing to a height of eight feet quito dumbfounded thom Another night they wero much surprised at seeing a strange, unearthly looking animal some- what resembling a dog, with a long chain attached to it This animal carne right m front of tho hut, and commenced grinning at them, but made no noise, cither by barking or otherwise, Bavo the occasional rattling of his chain As tho animal would not go awav, ono of the men (who was a good shot) loaded a gun, and fired the contents direct at the brute, but the Bhot took no effect upon it The dog, or whatever it was, remained for some considerable time On another night tho dog seemed to have returned, for thoy heard the rattling of a chain and a noise like what a dog would make when licking a plate Upon looking outside they saw that a plate which had been left there was in motion, but they could not see what caused it to be so, although they could, while looking, distinctly hear the same noise described above Thev watched it for some time, the plato being kept in motion, and the noise being distinctly heard as if the plate was being licked by some animal On Sunday last these men came into Young, and upon one of them returning in the evening he found that the door of the hut had been pulled down, and its contents brought outside and left there Two out of the three men are well known to us, and we feel confident that what wo have stated may be relied upon as the truth A shepherd told these men that some time ago two men who were splitting there quarrelled, and one killed the other with an axe, and after- wards fell a tree on him, and that it was no- thing extraordinary for the murdered man's ghost to make its appearance "
