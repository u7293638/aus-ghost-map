PEACE OP MIND IS A PRECIOUS JEWEL. -It may be lost through inadvertence or yielding to sin, or neglect of prayer and ordinances, or a lack of fidelity to covenant engagements, or indifference to duty. It is to be maintained by living near God and by cultivating the grace of God in every varying condition and relation in life, It is the result of a sense of the divine favour in a reconcilia tion through Jesus Christ, of the abiding presence of the Holy Ghost, of fellowship with God, and of a use of his ordained instrument alities.
