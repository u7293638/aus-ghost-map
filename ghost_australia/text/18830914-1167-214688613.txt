Moody's Opinion. Mr. Moody Baid recently at North-field, Mass.:â€”" ^ would not find fault with the churches, but we must seek to carry the Spirit with us into the churches. Not many of them now-a-days would want Stephen for a pastor; they wouldn't tolerate him. I will tell you how it is with ministers, if you will excuse me. I don't believe a man can preach Christ acceptably and preach and work in Sabbatli-school, and attend funerals, and meetings, and lawn parties where they dance, and fairs where they have grab-bags. The Holy Ghost 6ets a man apart from the world. A heaven-sent man never did fail, never will fail, never can fail. Ministers do too much outside work. If I had a sermon that God liad honored 1 would preach it over and over in a schoolhouse or a prayer-meeting, or any place where twenty people could be gathered together; if it carried power once, it would again."
