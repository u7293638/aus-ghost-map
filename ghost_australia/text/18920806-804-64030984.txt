SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. Henceforth THE ILLUSTRATED SYDNEY NEWS will be published WEEKLY, and it is the intention of the proprietors to give in it a comprehensive and entertaining ac- count of the week's doings, in addition to special articles and chatty writing on in- teresting subjects. Each issue will (in addition to many other Engravings) in future contain a full page CARICATURE OF A WELL-KNOWN PUBLIC MAN, and next week will be inaugurated a Series of THRILLING GHOST STORIES, specially written for the paper by the cele- brated novelist, HENRY FRITH, and entitled Â« HAUNTED ANCESTRAL HOMES : their Ghostly Visitants and Portents.' It has been decided in the future to somewhat alter the character of THE ILLUS- TRATED SYDNEY NEWS, and whilst its purity of tone will still be maintained, the pro- prietors will aim at keeping the public in touch with current events, and serving up their newB in a palatable form.
