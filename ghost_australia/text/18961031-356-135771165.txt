"ON THE OTHER SIDE." "LInE on the Other Side," as des cribed in the pages of an American magazine, oddly enough somewhat resembbles "Life on This bide." According to one American female medium, who rivals Mr. Stead in the familiarity of her conversation with the inhabitants of the spirit world, clothes are needed there as here; jovial souls do not get over a tendency to slang; sectarianism is rampant; Socialists will be glad to mknow there's no such thing as personal property, but unfortunately class dis tinctions exist; the new woman will be comforted when she hears there are "no sex conditions "; ghosts of souls cannot claim sex characteristics, but a rival spirit declares husband and wife continue lovers on the astral plane if they are in rapport with each other.
