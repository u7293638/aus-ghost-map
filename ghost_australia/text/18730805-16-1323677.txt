The Selling Hurdle Race saw four at the starting post, public opinion being much divided as regarded a first favorite. Ono rough looking customer, owning to the euphonious appellation of Buhudowall, und posacBBing an especial long tail), quite raised the indignation of an old friend of mine, who considered it a disgrace to Bturtlum, the rough one, however, won both heats easily, very much to the astonish- ment of a good many, my friend in particular, who " knows a thing or two" quite as well as here and there one. Next came the big event of the meeting, and a fine race it proved, although won very easily at the finish Those who had not seen Elastic and who had heard of him only by repute were most anxious to catch a glimpse of the horse, before making his appearance in the saddling paddock his supporters had accepted even money about him, and when he was once seen, those who had laid and stood the field to pull them through, did not like it a little bit, and hedged their money right and left whenever obtainable at any price. The horse stripped in splendid order, and his appearance was all in his favor as he is a long raking looking customer, showing plenty of breeding, and somewhat of the Zanco stamp. Sir Watkin did Tom Sowerby great credit, be looked better than ever he had previously stripped in the colony, and he ran a good race for three parts of the distance He was ridden however, with very bad judgment, for had he been kept behind instead of being taken to the front at on early portion of the race, the finish would have most certainly proved a much closer one Shakespeare was far from being fit-ho find a jaded appearance and looked to be overdone. Nobby, upon whom a good many local men pinned their faith, was the picture of health and condition, and with such a well known man as M'Alister up, his friends were very confident, and accepted 2 to 1 about him at the last moment The prize, however, was too hot for him all the way, and he had not the ghost of a chance after being cannoned against us he was at one of the leaps by some inebriated mdi v refund, who deserved sending to Woogaroo for HIS months Harlequin, n corky looking chestnut, was in fun bush condition, and ran an honest horse throughout, taking all his jumps like a workman, The race was really a fine sight to witness When the horses went down to the starting, post, Elastic, who was in great heart after proving very fra dons for several minutes, eventually made matters more unsettled by crossing his land logs and coming down, Fortunately, however, without injury to himself or under This quieted him a bit, how old or and being very judiciously ridden by Dwyer, who, seeing his anxiety to go, indulged him with the lead for about half a mile before taking a pull upon him and the horse got over all the eastern tions without making a sit gro mistake eventually winning the race by something like half a distance which might just as well have been a quarter of a mile A better Inn die races than this proved to be I have never witnessed the first leap more es per day presenting a beautiful sight, three horses rising and descending together almost instan- variously Shakespeare broke off at the second hurdle, which destroyed his chance and Nobby fell in consequent of of the inebriated individual before referred to, which at once settled his pretensions The Stowuida' Pinto was looked upon by the majority to be a good thing for Erin although there were a few b wickets for 16 mm who landed then money, is the horse made his own running throughout, and won without over having been interfered with, him finishing a good second, which position he retained after the last quarter of a mile The following are the details of the running for the various on and s - The music PSA in of 30 sons , weight for age miles and a (list nice Mr J James b g Eucalyptus, aged, 9 st 12 lbs (Owner) 1 Mr T Doolan's ch g Tom Rocket, Gun, 9 st 12 lbs (anon) 2 Mr W V Difeby'sehg Blare', aged 9st 11 but (UAlistoi) 8 Mr L L Leeder's br g Bill and, legs 1,0 still lbs (Sinclair) 0 Mr T G Sullivan's b g Slyboots used, 6 st lbs min S lbs one (Kraus) 0 Mr W B Gannon's br g Kildare 3 yrs 7 at 13 Mrs (W White) 3 Betting 2 to 1 v BI1170Â» mid Euc di plus, 3 to 1 v Kildare, Schools and Burzird As soon as the the, fell Buzzard went off at score, followed by Slyboots, the whole field being close together the first and second hurdles were topped bountifully in the order named and before reaching the third obstruc- tion Juicily ptiiB had forged his way to the front and carried out the running in great style, taking it commanding load of which he was never afterwards deprived.

During the afternoon a testimonial was got upon behalf of 1 VIIIIB, which I am glad to say was liberally subscribed to by nearly the whole of the sporting men present 'IhoSniiiNO Human BAOT of 2sovs , one mile an I n distance is in nts Mr T Doolan's bg Bnhudowall aged, 9st (Green) 1 I Mr 0 Lindonboig'B bg Rugged Boy, aged lOst (M Alister) 2 2 Mr W B Gannon's bile g Biiayfoot, ingots, 10 st.

On the word being given, Buayfoot went off with the loud, but baulked at the first obstruc- tion, the other two taking it together in rare style, and running in company throughout, the qiicor-nnmod one getting first over the last hurdle, and winning comfortably by a length or two. Second Kout.-Busyfoot jumped well, and at one time established It good load, thereby rais- ing the hopes of his backers immensely. Before reaching the second hurdle, however, the others caught line, and, topping the last hurdle together, " the long tailed 'up" again won easily with plenty to spare.

Shakespeare and Sir Watkin. 6 to 1 v. Harlequin. Elastic, who was very impatient at the start, was indulged with the lead, and he made the running at a fair pace, followed by Shakespeare and Sir Watkin. Those three look the first flight of hurdles almost abreast beautifully, the remaining two following them at a short die Junee. Dwyer bore steadied. JCluatio, and Sir Watkin took up the running. At the second obstacle Shakespeare shied off and lost many lengths before he could be recovered 3 in the meantime the others progressed steadily, Harlequin gradually forging ahead to the front and taking the fourth hurdle first, followed by Sir Watkin, Elastic, and Nobby in the order named. Before the next jump was negotiated Sir Watkin had again resumed premier position, Klustio still going on second, the pace improving, and being evidently too fast for Nobby, who came down at this leap, having been cannoned against by a horseman. McAlister was quickly up, however, and in full pursuit again of the leader. At the seventh hurdle, being about a mile and a distance from home, Elastic, who had been ridden a waiting race, was again taken to the front ; and he gradually increased his load at the option of his rider, eventually coming home an easy winner by something like half a distance, Sir Watkin being second some lengths ahead of Harlequin, who finished third. There was great cheering when the winner returned to scale, the horse, his owner, and rider coming in for a perfect ovation when the result was declared.

This race needs little or no description, Priam going to the front when the starter's flag fell, and maintaining his position throughout, although warmly pressed by Erin at the finish. Sir Richard, when almost bead'and-head with the leader, bolted at the first turn. A Hunux Bcnanr concluded a very enjoyable day's sport.
