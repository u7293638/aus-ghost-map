.A'ORE CHEESE ! TO THE EDITOR OF THIE OIPPSLOID TIMUI. Sin.'- Your correspondents, " Lacto meter" and "Burke a Ghost," attack most unfairly my capacity and my char actor. Let those who may have anything to say about me put their names to what they write; and if they are of any known worth in this district I will answer them. But no reasonable man will expect me to answer mere scribblers, who hint and suggest scandals they Pre ashamed to own, and are evidently afraid to put in the shape of a definite charge. The accu sation I have made against Mr Williams of forwarding skimmed milk to the fac tory of which I am the manager, was made in proper form to the gentleman who had charge of the shareholders' in terests at the timo-viz., Mnr Wm. Scott, butcher, of Maffra, and that gentleman confirmed my statement after having set part of the milk for the night.; or else what did the statement he made to the committee mean, when he said-" I set the milk in a pan for the night, and in the morning there was certainly a defi ciency of cream P" So you see, I did not stand alone in the opinion I had formed of Mr Williams' milk. As to the quality of the cheese I have made for the Mil'ra company, I am not ashamed to state the price it is bringing, and with the exception of Mr Williams I think I have the confldence of all my employers. In sending Mr Williams' milk back I simply did my duty, as I saw my duty. Whatever others may see cannot, as it ought not, influence me. When attacks on me are made openly and fairly I shall know how to meet them; but I know a little better than to enter upon a news paper war with a mythical " Lactometer" or with " Burke's Ghost," or any other ghost. Yours, very obediently, JOHN WEST. Maifra, 12th Jan.
