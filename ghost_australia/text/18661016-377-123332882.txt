MACKAY BANK ROBBERY. 0 (From the eNorthern Aayes.) Can any one tell, is it true what they say, , That two bushmen have stuck-up the bank at Mackay And without any just or ostensible grounds Have carried away about eight hundred poundsP . One chap was a darkev---a sort of half-cast -' Who entered the Bank about twelve or half-past And foolishly asked for the change of a pound But belore the poor banker had time to look round He saw a revolver quite close to his head And a fellow declaring he'd shoot him quite dead If he offered to stir, or to utter a word That could by the neighbours be possibly heard. '-' The other young bushman was soon by his side Of darkey; and when the pour banker spied, - Looking pale as a ghost and fearing to grapple, , He kindly presented him with a nice apple,, . Which soothed him so much he felt quite at ease And said to thie robbers-"Dear sirs, if you please Don't take those few cheques,. you will find them no use And by leaving them save us a deal of abuse The bargain was made they soon emptied the till, And their knapsack with notes, gold, and silver did fill But before they departed the bankers they swore Not to open their mouths for a full hour or more, Or, as sure as they uttred one word about thief The pair of Brave bankers would soon come to grief The Manager says, his boots made such a noise He verily thinks that those wide-awake boys Would surely come back if he ventured to stir, So he thought it advisable not to incur: The displeasure of bushmen who might come again And put him in a more disagreeable.pen Of dimensions--say two by about five feet ten So home he returited, to tell his poor wlfe of the wonderful hazard he ran of his life.
