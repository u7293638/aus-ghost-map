THE RECTOR AND THE GHOST Ghosts have appeared—or rather been heard—at Durweston, a Dorset village near Blandford. The spirits are of the rapping and scratching description, and nearly drove the widow West and her three daughters to distraction. The rector and schoolmaster were called in, and agreed to watch through a night. Mrs. West had provided a slate and pencil, and requested the spirit or spirits to write on the slalo if there was uny» thing to communicate. The slate was placed on the bedroom window inside the room. The woman and her daughters went to bed, leaving the door open. The rector and his companion remained at the top of the stairorso with a light, awaiting events. They heard scribbling on the slate, and then four taps with fcho pencil. They rushed in and found Mrs, West and the children in bed, and not a sign that they hud moved, but on the slate were the words “ Mony,” “ Garden,” with a nought above and below. The rector, it is snides prepared to swear that no one iu the house wrote the words. So far uoboby has dug iu the ‘ garden’ for the ‘ mony.’ The spirit or spirits must have loft school before 1871.
