PAUL DENTON'S PERORATION ON WATER. — Alcohol. This is the liquor which God the Eternal brews for His children—not in the simmering still, over smoke fires, choked with poisonous gases, and sur- rounded with a stench of sickening odors and rank corruptions, dotli your Heavenly Father in Heaven prepare the -precious essence of life, the pure water—but in the green glade and grassy dell, where the red deer wanders and the child loves to play, there God brews it; and down, low down in the deepest valleys, where the fountain murmurs and the rills sing; and high npon the mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun, where the storm-cloud broods, and the thunder storms crash; and away far out in the wide wild sea, where the hurricane howls music and the big waves roar the chorus, sweeping the march of God, there He brews it, this beverage of life, this health-giving water. And everywhere it is a thing of beauty, gleaming in the dewdrop, singing in the summer rain, shining in the ice gem till the trees all seem turned to living jewels, spreading a golden veil over the setting sun, or a white gauze around the midnight moon, sporting in the cataract, sleeping in the glacier, dancing in the hail shower, folding its bright snow curtains softly about the wintry world, and weaving the many colored iris, that seraph’s zone of the sky, whose warp is the rain-drop of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of Heaven, all chequered over with the celestial flowers by the mystic hand of refraction. Still always it is beautiful, this blessed life-water. No poison bubbles on its brink; its foam brings no mad ness and murders; no blood stains its liquid glass; pale widows and starving orphans weep no burning tears in its depths; no drunkard’s shrieking ghost from the grave curses it in words of eternal despair. Speak out my friends, would you exchange it for.
