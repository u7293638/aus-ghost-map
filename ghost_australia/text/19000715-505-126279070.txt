HER HUSBAND'S GHOST. The 'New York Journal' tells a vera cious story about a Minneapolis widow, who hired a room for her husband's ghost, an idea suggested, as she says, 'by. the 'thought that my husband's spirit shared the rooms with me. This made me very happy at first.' The pleasing fancy, how ever, was dispelled by a more material ac quaintance formed with a physician of tho city. ' 'Gently, kindly,' says the widow, 'he drew from me the story of my spirit house. 'It is your duty, dear, to turn your attention to 'the living, and let the dead go,' he said. So I have given up the house, and instead of mourning longer over a dead husband I am going to be happy with a living one.'
