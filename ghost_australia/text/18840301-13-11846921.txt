associated moio oi less with acts w Inch ai o nowadays brought under tlie notice of the ci munal law, and their habits of weaung wlnto di esses, clank nig chains, and confining then peram- bulations

tho mansions aie pulled dow n to make way foi new ones, the ghosts finally disappeai In addi tiou to all this, they aio rogaidcd as confcinng somothing of nnstocratic distinction on tho lamilies to which they bolong, and though to those they aio a subject of propei pndo, it is found that thoy occasion so many heartbui nings to loss favomed íesidonts of tho dis tuet, which aiecxpiessed m the shape of psoudo st lentific scepticism, that for the sako of peace tho appantion visited family usually prefer to drop thou ghostly îclative, who soon takes the hint, and vanishes finally into the land of shadows So that m spite ot all tho exertions of tho Psychical Society it is evident that in Iho stiugglo for existence tho few solitary lonmining ghosts aro going steadily to the wall, and aie being ciushed out by tho moro robust and substantial living beings Piom that point of viovv it would appeal that the pi osent activity m the ghost maikct is but an expiring fluttei, and that unless in cases wheio strenuous eliotts havo been made to secuto their picseivalion, ghosts will by the end of the centuiy bo as extinct as the dodo It is woith lomaiking that hitherto Austialia lias been
