j Fisher's Ghost. AN OLD NEW SOUTH WALES I TRAGEDY. ! CHAPTER V. o i [By Joes Liko.] 3&B;%ext morning, or rather on {hat morpiqp, Mr. Cox, at eight o'clock, Tode^ ofeiEtjpffteatowuffaipl jPenri^h and saw Hamilton, Weir's second witneBt. Hamilton, as did Williams, corroborated all that Weir 1 had stated, so far jas related to the second time the spectra had been seen; and Hamilton further volunteered, jjifij^^seitton. tU&t; no one, of the paH;^- was in thfr*Blightest degree affected by drink. There was 1 a tribe of blacks in the yknmtjr, and Mr. Cox s9n£-forthe chief ana several others. vTh&EiropeMi; nkme of this«hief was "Johnny Crook," and, like al| his race, he was an adept in the tracking. Accompanied ,by Weir, Hamiljon, Williams, and the blades, r Mr. Cox proceeded to the spot. Weir bad no difficulty in pointing <ont the F , 1 r i exact rail. The b^kfoar~bo\i^hs]an^ the 'notches on the post were* his unerring guides. . Johnny Crook, after examining the tail very minutely, pointed -to' eonle stains,! and exclaimed, " white man's blood {" Then, leaping over the fence, h^^xamined the brushwood and the ground adjacent. Ere long he started off, bebkoning Mr. Cox and his attendant^ to follow. For more than threequarters of a mile,-, ov®. folest . liuid^ the safage tracked the footsteps of a man ahd something trailing along the earth (fortunately, so far as the ends of justice! were concerned, ~H5~ rain had fallen {during the period alluded to by Old David, namely fifteen months, one heavy shower :wonld- have obliterated all thdse tracks, most probably; and curious enough, that very night there was a jfrightful downpour, snch a downfall as; hdd not been known for many a long year), until they c^me ta ajiond or water$ole, upon the surface of which was a bluish scum. This scum the blacks, after an examination of it, declared to be " white man's fat." The pond }n question was not on Fisher's land, jor Smith's. It was on Crown laudj, in the rear of their properties. "When full to the brink, the depth of the w)ater was about ten feet in the centre; but at the time. referred to there was was not more than three "feet "and a half, and badly as the cattle wanted water, it was veiy evident, frpm tjie absence of recent foot-prints, thaw they would not drink at this pond. The blacks walked into the 'water at the rpque^t of Mr. Cox, and felt about the muddy bottom ,witji. their feet. They, were not long - employed 1 thus wiien they', came upon a bag. of bones,' or rather, the remains of a' human body, kept, together by clothing which had becoihe so rotten it would sc&rcely; bear the tofich. The skull was still attached to'the ^ body, which the blacks raised to the surface and brought on shore, .together with a bi» stone and the remains of a large silk "handkerchief. The features were not recognisable, but TiT " """ We quttons on the clothes, and the [boots jvere those which Mr. Fisber used to weprl And in the pockets of the .^oncers was found a buck horn handled knfte,: which bore the initials " J. F." enlrraved on a small silyer plate. .vThifli was also identified by Weir, who had seen Mr. Fisher .use the knife scores of. James. It was one of those' knives , which; contained a large blade, two small Ones, a corkscrew, gimlet, horseaboe/picker, .tweezers, screw-driver, The murderer, "whoevWr it might "be, had either forgotten to take away this knife, or had purposely 16ft it with the body,, for all- the rother pockets w;ere, turned inside out. " Well, sir, what <lo you think of that ?V said old Weir to Mr. Cox, who looked on in a state of amazement, which almost' amounted to bewilder-' ment I " I scarcely know whatto think of it," was Mr. Cox's reply. " But it is lucky fyr ybu, David, that youete beyOnd the bale of being suspected of bo foul a deed.'* tisir?" Yes, yon. If it were not that this dead ijian's pipperty is advertised foE eale,\it might have'gone very hard with you,'old man. It would hare been suggested that your conscience had something to do with the information you gave sjte of the ghost. But stay here, all of you, with the body until Ixetmra! I shal^not be absent for more than an hour.' 1 Have you a pair of handcuffs about you, -Hamilton?" '" , Several pair, sir," replied the constable.' CHAPTER YL" After leaving ihe dead body, Mr. Cox rode to Fisher's house, in whicli Mr. Smith was living. Mir. Smith, on lifeing rafcnn^ of the approach of so a person as Mr. Cox, one of the. proudest men in the colony, came oat Va •receive him with aQ. respect and honour. Mr. Cox—who would not have given bis hand to an "expiree" under any circumstances, no matter how wealthy he might be—answered Mr. Smith's greeting witha bow, and then asked if he sak with him/fora iewamnates. ith replied, " Most certainly) d ordeiiag a servant to take ifitrate's horse to the stables, he conducted h'sTrisitor into the best-room erboarded and comfoitabie tenemebt.

It was originally granted to Colonel Foucars,- who sold it and conveyed it to Sr." Thomas Blaxsell, whoj said i jti ^jad conveyed it to Mr. Fisher.
