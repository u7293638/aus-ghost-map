CHRISTMAS MASQUES AND MUMiimiS. BY O.M.S. " God is not dead 1 nor doth lie sleep The Wrong shall toil, The Right prevail. With peace on earth, goodwill to men I" Time, on a certain Christmas morn, pealed forth their sublime chant the Christmas bells, loud, wild, deep, and full of inspira- tion and prophetic assurance. Let us hope- fully accept the auspicious augury, so rich in gracious promise, while " Itinginsr, singing, on its way, The world revolves from night to day." The angels in the Gloria in excelsis have doubtless given us the best definition of Christmas " On earth peace, goodwill toward men." This pacific idea of Christmas, with its love, charity, and forgiveness, has probably found its most striking realisa- tion in the Uttered, or Yule-peace, of the Scandinavians, a custom, though ancient as the Runic Stones, still existing in Sweden, by virtue of a Christian baptism, as a Christian institution. Extend- ing from Christmas Eve to Epiphany, and solemnly proclaimed by a public crier, any violation of the Yule-peace is visited with double or treble punishment. The courts are closed, old quarrels are adjusted, old feuds are forgotten ; while on the Yule-evening the shoes, great and small, of the entire household, are set close together in a row, that during the coming year the family may live together in peace and harmony. To this Christian conception of the Christ- mas time not a few pagan elements have been added, which are clearly traceable to the old German "Twelve Nights," and the Roman Saturnalia. Hence its mirth and festivity, its jesting and feasting, its frolic and license. The decoration and illumination of our Christian churches recall the temples of Saturn radiant with burning tapers and resplendent with garlands. The " Merry Christmas" re- sponds to the "iona Saturnalia," and our modem Christmas presents to the. dona is very. During the Saturnalia, which were intended to symbolise the freedom, equality, and peaceful prosperity of the golden or Saturnian age, all labour was suspended. The schools were closed, the Senate adjourned, no criminal was executed, no war proclaimed. Slaves exchanged places with their masters, or, seated at the banqueting tables wearing badges of freedom, rested familiarly with them as their equals. Most of these customs have found their counterpart during the Christmas holidays in modern society. In Italy at the present day masters and servants not unfrequently meet and are seated at a common Christmas table ; while among the English nobility, at least in the times when Scott sang of the Christmas tide, the " huge bolt table " " Bore then upon its surface broad No mark to part the squire and lord," Nor do we fail to find the outcropping of the freedom and license of the Roman Satur- tralia in Protestant England, and even Puri tonic Scotland. In the stalwart. times of " good Queen Bess the Christmas holidays lasted for more than a month. These were the palmy days of the Yule-tide, when the mystic mistletoe conferred upon amorous swains a charter for kissing 83 "brood as the wind," when the Christmas logs flamed and roared, when boars' heads and barbecues smoked, when the fragrant formity, was all, and snapdragons fumed, while fun and frolic and boisterous mirth raged furiously through the " wee short hours " until the sky turned round. From Christmas Eve to Candlemas Day did the merry-making run riot, inaugurated as it was by the bringing in, with great ceremony, of the well-seasoned Yule log, the merry-makers singing the while the modernised Christmas carol commencing " Come, bring with a noise, My merrie, merrie boys, The Christmas log to the Dring." Then it was that the Lord of Misrule, or Abbot of Unreason, was the autocrat of the Christmas time ; when, clothed With the same powers as the Lord of the Feast of Asses in France, he enjoyed the right to say with impunity whatever he chose to whomsoever he pleased, even to hooting the minister during divine service, when the con- Gregation would sometimes desert the church in a body to join the roystering revellers under his capricious command As with Christmas as a holiday, so with many of its characters and customs If not of pagan origin, they constitute a curious medley of paganism and Christianity This is particularly true among the Germans, who were strongly attached to their old religious ceremonies The Christ child with his gifts and masked attendant all belong to the German antiquity In the procession of the star singers, the three kings replace as many of the pagan gods Only the names have been changed, while the ceremony has received the rites of a Christian baptism Mistletoe and holly, Yule log and Yule caudle, belong to the same category The mistletoe was regarded by the Druids with religious veneration, and its berries of pearl, as symbolic of purity, were very appropriately associated by them with the mystic rites of marriage From this the transition was but Blight to the lovers kiss beneath its emblematic though during the Christmas time Nor must we forget that our pagan progenitors burned a great dog and a mammoth candle upon the 21st of December, which, being the shortest day in the year, was regarded as the turning point in the conflict between the contending forces of winter and spring St Nicholas, as all the world knows, is the patron saint of children, with whom he is undoubtedly the most popular one in the calendar Bishop of M)

window Hence the popular fiction that he is the purveyor of presents to children on Christmas Eve he usually makes his appearance as an old man, with a venerable beard, and dressed as a bishop He is represented as riding either a white horse or an ass and carrying a large basket containing fruits and Bwtctincats on his arm, and a bundle of rods in his hand Visit ing the nurseries, he inquires

is followed by a masked servant called Krampus In the Ty For he goes by the name of the "Holy Man and shares the patronage of his office with St Luey, who distributes gifts among the girls as he among the boys Sometimes he is accompanied by the Christ child in the Netherlands and adjoining provinces St Nicholas is especially popular For days previous to his expected advent busy house wives have

distribution of presents, it is the Jesus bamboo, or Christ child, who comes with a convoy of angels loaded with books and toys, with which to fill the expectant little shoes that tiny hands have so carefully arranged in the fireplace In alsace he is represented at. a young maiden dressed in white, with hair formed of lambs wool hanging down over her shoulders, and her face w listened with flour, while on her head she wears a crown of gilt paper set round with burning tapers In one hand she holds a silver bell, in the other a basket full of sweetmeats She is the messenger of joy to all children, but that joy is usually changed into terror on the appearance of Hans Trapp The Alsatian Ruprecht The frightful bugbear, with his devils mask, rushes into the room brandishing a portentous bundle of rods, and demands in a hoarse voice which of the children have not been obedient, as he walks up towards them in a threatening manner, while they, trembling and crying, seek to hide them selves as best they may from the impending punishment But the ChriSt hild interceded for them, and, upon their promising to be good in the future, leads them up to the brilliantly illuminated Christmas tree loaded with presents, which soon makes them oblivious of the frightful Hans Trapp In the Erz- George it is St. Peter who, dressed as a bishop and accompanied by the dreadful Ruprecht, is impatiently expected by the children on Christmas Eve of the character of his visit does not differ materially from that of the Christ-child, only that on leaving he delivers a short sermon, lays on the table a rod coated with chalk, and then departs as noiselessly as he came 'the children, removed from the presence of Ruprecht, now breathe free again They hasten to take off their shoes, polish them, and then tie them, together, when the most daring among them, after listening to see if Niglos bell has ceased tinkling, runs out into the garden and puts his shoes under a bush The

precedes, it will appear that the bugbear Ruprecht, under different names and disguises, plays a conspicuous part among German speaking populations in the Christmas festivities in the Tyrol the terrible Klaubauf accompanies St Nicholas, who kidnaps naughty children and stows them away in his basket In lower Austria it is the frightful Krampus, with his clanking chains and horrible devil's mask, who, notwithstanding his gilded nuts and apples, gingerbread and toys, which he carries in his basket, is the terror of the nursery in the Bohemian Netherlands, Rumpanz figures as the bugbear in the train of the Christ-child Three young men disguise themselves, one us an angel, another as the devil, and the third as a he goat The latter catches and holds wicked children, who do not say their prayers, upon his horns in order that the devil may beat them with his rod In Swabia the Christ-child is accompanied by the Pelzmacrt, w he carries an earthen pot containing the presents, and a bell to herald his coming In Hanover Holstein, and Mecklenburg, Ruprecht is known as 61 is, in Silesia, his name is Joseph Sometimes the Christmas bugbear carries a rod at the end of which is fastened a sack full of ashes, with which he beats un dutiful children, and is therefore called Ashy Claws At other times he rides a white horse, called in some localities the " Spanish Stallion, and not unfrequently he is accompanied by a bear wrapped in straw in the island of Usedom the figures belong to the procession of Ruprecht One wrapped in straw bears the rod and ash sack The Second appears as the rider of the " Spanish Stallion The third ames the Flapper bod, which consists of a pole, over which is drawn a buckskin To the extremity of the pole a rams head is attached, from the nether jaw

also a female bugbear In Lower Austria. she was called the Budelfmu, and in Suabin, Bcrchtcl In the environs of Augsburg the Buzcbcrcht, with her blackened face, streaming hair, and flaunting rags, accompanied St Nicholas, be smearing everyone she met with the contents of her starch pot while, in the Behmer aid, or Bohemian Forest, St Lucy, under the form of a goat covered with a sheet through which the horns project, is to this day the terror of lazy or undutiful children In Ramsgate, Kent, and the Me of Thanet, the custom styled "hedging is still in vogue The Iloden, which appears to be cross between the "Spanish Stallion and the KlapperbocX, of the Germans, is accompanied by a number of youths in fantastic dress, who go round from door to door ringing bells and singing Christmas carols Nor must we omit the Christmas mum mers, still to be found in Cornwall and Gloucestershire, who carry us back to the old morality plays, the origin of the modern English drama. The players, for the most part ploughboy or country bumpkins, variously masked and grotesquely dressed go about on Christmas Eve from house to house, giving wherever received, a rude dramatic performance styled a Mystery But time and space would fail us to speak of the many singular customs and quaint superstitions associated with the Christmas holidays 'The popular notion that cattle kneel at midnight on Christmas I've in recognition of the anniversary of the Savour s birth, is still said to exist even in some parts of England, while the belief that water drawn at 12 o'clock on Christmas Night is miraculously) turned into wine still obtains in some localities Sa) s Marcellus to Horatio, on the crowing of the cock, in the ghost scene in "Hamlet - Some say that ever against that season comes Vt herein our Saviour's birth is celebrated The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then they say no spirit dares stir abroad The nights are wholesome then no planets strike, No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm, So halle d and so gracious is the time In some places as inSw able it is customary for marriageable maidens, who are inquisitive as to then prospective lovers, to pour melted lead into cold water, and then to prognosticate, from the different forms it assumes, the trade or profession of their future husbands If the) imagine the) see a plane, or shoe last, or a pair of shears, it signifies that he is to be a carpenter, or shoemaker, or tailor , while a hammer or pic! axe in dicatts a smith 01 a common labourer Hit maidens of Pfulhngcn, when they wish to ascertain which of them will first become a wife, form a circle and place in their midst a blindfolded gander, and the one to whom he goes first will soon be a bride.

There is also a widespread opinion that a pack of wolves, which were no other than wicked men transformed into wolves committed great havoc upon Christmas Night Taking advantage of this superstition, observes Von Rensberg, to whom we are in debt for much valuable information, it was not unusual for rogues disguised in wolf skins to attack honest people, rule their houses, sack their cellars, and drink or steal all their beer As a specific charm against these wolfish depredations, it was customary in Austria, up to a recent date, after high mass on Christmas Night, to sing in a particular tone, to the tolling of a large bell, St Matthews account of the genealogy of Christ Christmas customs in the New VA world have, for the most part, been transplanted from the Old by en The negroes of Jamaica elect from among themselves a King and Queen of Mrs rule, and indulge in Christmas masks and mummers Our Christmas tree comes from Germany, our Santa Claus from Holland, the Christmas stocking from Belgium or France, while the "Merry Christmas and happy New Year is the old English greeting shouted from window to street and from street back to a widow in the " long, long ago
