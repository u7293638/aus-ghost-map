THE LAND OF NO AVAIL. [By Roderick Quinn.1 There is a land no eye hath seen By day or night, Unlit of moons, unloved of stars, And mantled in twilight. 'Tis haunted by dim hooded shades That may not smile. "With wan white lips that whisper low But make no mirth the while. No word is said, no song is heard, Sick winds go by And cry their ghosts to shrouded stars Beyond the marbled sky. It is the land of no avail, Of fruitless jwiin, Of poet-songs that craved a voice But craved a voice in vain. It is the land of broken loves, Of sweetness missed, Of dreams dethroned and fancies lost And kisses never kissed.
