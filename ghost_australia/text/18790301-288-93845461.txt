THE FEBRUARY EXHIBITION. [The following is the continuation of the re port of the February Show, and deals more especially with that part which comes under the superintendence of the Agricultural Society. The report having more paticular reference to the Industrial Exhibits will be found on Page 8.] The Agricultural Society's portion of the ?snow was very creaitauie mj growers ana producers. The wool we have already commented upon. It is to be regretted that there was not more competition in this section, but the samples of fleece which were shown were undoubtedly magnificent. The collection of agricultural produce was small — smaller, indeed, than was expected, although admittedly our harvest has been a comparative failure — but the grain shown was a good sample. The display of fruit, flowers, and vegetables was good, and some novelties in both the former lines were noticeable. There was a large atten dance on Thursday, but, doubtless, many who are more interested in the industrial sections postponed then* visit till next day. His Excel lency the Governor was present during Thursday afternoon, and escorted by Mr. S. Davenport and Mr. J. F. Conigrave, went through various UiC WttL UUJ.CU W WL vLt*~' JJAUiuivivu* j.uv givuuuu during the afternoon presented a most animated appearance. The marquee, with its exquisite collection of choice flowers and pot plants, was, as might be expected, the favorite resort of the ladies; the agricultural and other machinery attracted the attention of prac tical farmers, squatters, aud others , while an endless field fcr study was offered by the indoor exhibits. Amusements of various kinds were in full swing. Cheap jacks and itinerant showmen of different nationalities and varving degrees of ability plied their callings with a view to speedy acquirement of the ** almighty dollar,' and the refreshment booth proprietors did a capital trade. The Judges' luucheon booth was catered for by the energetic and genial proprietor of the Goodwood Hotel. Below it will be found that we have dealt with the remainder of the exhibits in detail : — AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE. 'We were somewhat disappointed with the' agricultural produce section, as the entries were by no means numerous, aud in some lines there were no exhibits afc all. Mr. J. H. Angas carried away the Challenge Cup with a good sample, considering the season, but the weight, 67 lbs. 3g ozs., was uot equal to what we have been accustomed in xirevioua years. Mr. J. Riggs took second honors with a sample weighing 65 lbs. 15 ozs., aud the same exhibiter carried away the £5 prize. No hybridized wheat or selected wheat in straw was shown. Mr. Riggs's collections of grain in the straw were justly awarded prizes. Mr. J. Frame se cured honors for hills wheat, the weight being 65 lbs. 1 oz., and Mr. J. Thyer carried away the palm for plains ^rheat with a weight of 67 lbs. 5J ozs. Mr. J. H. Augas taking second prize. A good sample of barley, but badly cleaned, shown by Messrs. Chambers & Blades, was awarded a prize, while Mr. A. Bell received honors for oats. Some capital samples of field peas were shown by Mr. J. Frame, who also sent in fine specimens of rye and prairie grass seed. Messrs. Cobbledick, Hake, and Parsons were the representatives of fodder plants. Altogether thugpection was represented in a meagre manner.^This may be attributed in a great measure |o the season, but despite the in different harvest yield we had hoped to have seen a more representative collection of grain. Appended is the prize list : — Judges — For wheat, Messrs. J. Clark, J. Daw sou, M. McCallum, T. Atkinson, M.P., aud B. Patterson. For barley, &c;— Messrs. W. Fer gusson, W. Thomson, aud J. Duncan.

Special prize, presented by Messrs. E. & W. Hackefct — Boots for fodder, best collection, 12 of each variety, £1, Bake and Parsons. DAIRY PRODUCE. '. There was a very fair collection of dairy pro dace, tjie competition being, however, confined to only a few exhibitors. There- was a good show of salted butter, and some excellent eheeee. There was also some capital ham and baeon. The following is the prize list: — Judges — Messrs. H. A. Crawford, J. H. Efford, and J. Lyons. Batter, salted, three months old, 56 lbs., £3, Mrs. Callaby ; £2, Mrs. Callaby : £1, Wm. Nbsworthy. Eleven entries. Cheese, not lees than 200 lbs., £3, Jas. Welfare ; £2, W. Guthrie, Four entries.

Hanas, two, £1, Mrs. Callaby. FLORICULTURE. In this department a departure was made from the custom of past years, andtbe Show was held in a spacious marquee, instead of, as has hitherto been the case, in the large hall of the Exhibition Building. This change was very much for the the better, as the splendid marquee. 100 feet in length by 40 feet in width, was amply sufficient to display to thej best advantage Flora's choicest treasures, and as it was specially constructed for the purpose by Mr. T. Macdonald, of Freeman street, it answered admirably. On first enter Ing the -huge tent the visitor could not fail to be struck with the general tout ensemble of the interior. The fine coHeetion of pot plants, down the western side of the pavilion, and numerous and varied assortment of ferns, palms, and ?exotic plants on its eastern side showed to advantage, whilst the centre table was devoted to flowers of varying hue aud most Ifciijliant coloring. Overhead, swaying gently with $he undulations of the cauvas, suspended -in m-idj-air, were numerous lanterns of gorgeous .coloring a^td intricate design. These imparted an appearance of gaiety strictly In keeping with the mass of jeolorand stately specimens of hothouse floriculture upon the tables below. On entering the marquee a fine collection of -exotic plants from the Botanic Garden attracted jaotice. There was also an assortment of rpoieonous plants, comprising the celebrated YCJpas tree of Java, the mephitic exhalations €tom which are said to be so powerful as to .causa the death of any unfortunate sleeping beneath its shade, while contiguous to it was the equally celebrated Ordeal tree of Mada gascar. A remarkably thriving specimen of the Strycbnos, or strychnine plant, attracted much notice from the nature of the inscription affixed thereto — '*£he most poisonous plant known:' Some specimens of tobacco grown at £he Botanic Garden and a gigantic snake xuaomber about four feet in lengi.fi were viewed with interest. Passing onwards, a fine collec tion of palms and other hothouse pot plants were . noticeable £or their beauty and foliage. There \- -was a beautiful and jraried show of ferns, Sir Thomas Elder taking first and second prizes jn this Glass f^jyfiue spegjlm^n q$ &diantum; Farleyense and JAdiantum Cunentuni. For pot plants Mr C. Newenham obtained first prize for a fine Asplenium Flasidum, S. Pearson taking second honors for a splendid GleicheniaDicarpa. The first . prize of six ferns was awarded to Messrs. Giles & Son, and also 12 outdoor plants. Ths competition in hand bouquets, buttonhole, and standflowers was anything but keen. The severe season has had much to do with this. A very prettily arranged stand of flowers, placed in a *? mirror stand,' was choice in the extreme. Both the first and second prizes in this class fell to Mr. Edwin Smith. In basket flowers the competition was limited to three exhibitors,Mr. G, S. Fowler taking first honors. Seme fine table bouquets were shown, Mr. O. Zeigler obtaining first prize. The first prize for hand bouquets was awarded to Messrs. Giles & Son, but the competition was very limited. The geraniums were not as fine as could be wished, and certainly not as good as we have seen at former exhibitions. The same may be said with regard to petunias. The show of dahlias was simply superb, and the phlox varieties were admirably represented. Button hole flowers made a very poor show indeed, Messrs. Giles & Son took the first prize and Mr. Dobbie the second. A fine collection of caladiums exhibited by Messrs. Giles & Son deservedly obtained first prize. A fine lycopod exhibited by Mr. S /Pear son was awarded a first prize. For a collection of three specimens of the same plant Mr. G. S. Fowler obtained first honors. We now come to one of the rarest exhibits in the whole show. At the entrance to the pavilion was a bulbous pot plant, with a long stem surmounted with wmie nowers. xms is cauea siuguiany enougu 'The Holy Ghost plant.' or Peristeria Eiata, and is exhibited by the Hon. G. C. Hawker, who gained a first prize for it as a rare plant. The most striking feature in the flower is that in the ceutre the petal forms a most perfect re presentation of a dove. The flower is a cup shaped one, haying a centre leaf like a snap dragon, aud the scent is most delicious. It is claimed for this plant that it is the first which has bloomed in the colony, although two others in the possession of the Hon. Thos. Elder aud Mr. K. Barr Smith are now iu bloom-, The exhibits of roses were very poor, no doubt owing to the season. The prisetakers were Messrs. E. Smith and J. B. Hughes. A choice collection of cut flowers was shown, and at tracted much notice by their .beauty. Verbenas and zinnias were well represented, and the latter were particularly worthy of notice, but competi tion was confined, to the Hon. Henry Scott and Mr. Edwin Smith. Some fine collections of pot plants were exhibited by Sir Thos. Eider, Messrs. C. Newman, J. Pierson, and others. A very beautiful double f uschia, the Enchantress, shown by Sir Thomas Elder, obtained a first pr|ze. The following is the prize-list : — Plants in Pots. — Judges — Messrs. E. Lane, A. MacDonald, W. Humphries, T. Frazer, and W. Jones. New or rare, not previously exhibited, 10a., Giles & Son; 5s., C. Newman. New or rare, outdoor, not previously exhibited, 10a., Giles & Son; 5s., C. Newman.

Judges' remarks — 'The Judges are pleased to note the introduction of a marquee for the exhibition of plants, not only on account of the appearance and novelty, but as being more suitable for the general health of the plants. It is quite evident from the small competition -in some classes the unfavorable season has affected their culture. We recom mend a prize should be awarded for six cox combs, they being of unusual excellence. The habit and culture of ferns in all exhibits are remarkably good and close in competition. We were pleased to see so great an improvement and such keen competition in plants for table decoration, seven collections being exhibited. The whole collection of plants deserves special mention for its general excellence.' ? Cat Flowers.— Judges— Messrs. F. Wood, T. Frazer, and B. J- Hibbert.

Judges' remarks — 'The Judges report that the show on the whole is quite as good as could be expected, considering the dry weather. They would call the attention of exhibitors to being more par ticular in naming then* exhibits.' FfitJITS. There was really an admirable display of fruit. The season has not been altogether favorable for our vineyards and orchards, more, particularly for some descriptions of fruit, and it was pleasing therefore to note the excellent collection of Thursday's Show. The, most casual visitor could .not but pause to survey the golden and ruby apples, the light and purple luscious grapes, and the tempting-looking pears, and to the juveniles the temptations of the appetite must have been especially severe. The display of grapes was a capital one, there being all varieties of wine and table grapes, together with fancy growths new to very many. The apple department exhibited magnificent samples of the best growths, some being un usually fine and large. Beference to the' award list will show that the principal prizes fell to well-known growers and old prizetakers. The pears were remarkably good, while the-, plums were fair. Some fine melons were also shown. The award list is as follows : — Judges— Messrs. T. Hardy, J. Cobbledick, J. Curnow, J. F. Pascoe, and Hon. T. piayford. Fruits, collection of,*£4 4s., B.

Judges Be marks — 'Although there is a great falling off in the quantity of the exhibits, yet, considering the season, the exhibits as a whole are very cerdit able. They would specially call the attention of exhibitors to number of exhibits which would have taken prizes, but the Judges were unable to award prizes on account of the neglect of the exhibitors in hot putting the numbers on their exhibits.'* VEGETABLES. The vegetables were accommodated under the northern and western verandahs, and although the display was not so large as many expected tp see, still there was a capital collec tion, which comprised some remarkably fine in dividual exhibits. The principal exhibitors were and Halliday. The onions and potatoes were very superior, and there were some fine cabbages and trombones. The collection of vegetables comprised some well- assorted varieties of green stuff, and altogether the display was very creditable. The prize-list is as follows : — Judges — Messrs. Wm.
