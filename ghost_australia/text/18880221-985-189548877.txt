Another sentry stationed twenty-five yards off, heard him cock his rifle, and asked him what he was about. Willman said he bad just seen a ghost, and asked where it had gone to. The sentry laughed, but Willman, who was very serious, said it was the ghcstof a man whom he had mur dered. Then Willman who has proved to he Pilmore, told the story of the poaching affray, and how he and Roberts escaped the police. He said they succeeded in getting away from the locality, but in a wood somewhere between Leicester and Reading Roberts was starving and utterly Worn out and had diea.
