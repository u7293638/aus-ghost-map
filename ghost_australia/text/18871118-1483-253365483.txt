SELECT POETRY. THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES. I loved a love once, fairest among women : Closed allherdoorson me, I must notsee her— All, all are gotie, the old familiar faces. I have a friend, a kinder friencl has no man; Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly, Left him to mnae on old famii;.. face*. I have had playmates, I have had companions, In my days of childhood, in my joyful school days,— All, all are gone, the old {aces. I have been Laughing, I have been carousing; Drinking late, sitting (ate, with my bosom cronies,— All, all are gone, the old bees. Ghost-like I paced round the haunts of my childhood, Earth seemedadeaert 1 was bound to traverse, Seeking to find the old familiar faces. Why wot tboo IM hxii ti a^ dwelling ? So might we talk of the old familiar faces. How some they have died, aad some they have left me, And some are taken from me ; all are departed,— All, all are gone, the old familiar faces. •—CHARLES LAMB.
