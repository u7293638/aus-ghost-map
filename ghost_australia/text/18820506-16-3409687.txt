NEW SOUTH WALES. [FROM OUR OWN COIUUiSrONntlKT.] SYDNEY. July 1. AFTER. storm comes a calm, and after the Sydney holidays usually comes a period of rest It cannot be denied that during Easter we li id lively times of it in the way as of amusements mile reel cations, these were succeeded by long n i two quiet, and now we have got into every day working under your D ning the week there has been no big event of a very startling character, either political or otherwise, totluovv us into a far ment, nov 6 there's. a thing one thing withthcotliei.tliuchisbeen goodly) number of events worth chronicling, which in a city of the size and importance of Sydney may be almost looked upon as the name and condition of things the Hon Gr iii nu Betts, has i claimed to the place from whence he came no doubt be using his blushing honours thick upon him" with becoming modesty Vom Queensland pi tee tionists were so pleased at the impression he made here (winch, by the way, you would fail if you were upon the spot is very small in deed that they have invited him to heat them to a '-limited issue t action, but Mr. Ben i v, having once more pi ned his foot upon his native heath namely, within the Victorian legislative arena is not at all likely to leave it till the session is over, even to oblige his good friends the Queensland pi mechanists Stn i ed up by what they no doubt consider was a masterly exposition of the principles which they so strongly profess, the ' league' in this city.

With regard to the vacant See of Sydney, nothing more a has been done. A meeting of the Synod of the diocese will be held on the 9th instant, when an ordinance will be submitted intituled " An ordinance to provide for the appointment of Bishops to the See of Sydney" This will provide for the nomina- tion of three ecclesiastics, from whom one shall be chosen as the Bishop of Sydney. It is agreed on all hands that it will be difficult in deed to fill up the place so lately vacated by death so worthily as it was filled by the late Bishop, whose name is never mentioned except with the most respectful i over once The news by wire on Saturday evening, that the Sydney boys had pulled off the inter colonial boat race on the Yarra was for some time discredited When the men left Sydney their best friends did not think they had the ghost of a show, and when they reached Mel bourne and appealed alongside their competitors they were almost "pooh poohed " for their presumption in going so far to court what was looked upon as certain to be a most inglorious defeat Why, they were mere striplings, of no size or weight' while their opponents were strong burly fellows, full of muscle and pluck, who would win As for the betting, time was literally none, or if there was in the last instance it was of from 4 and 6 to 1 against the chance of the New South Welsh men But, keeping their own counsel, they w or Led early and late, and trained themselves into splendid condition for such slim runs, until at the start at the C to 1 had decreased to 2 to 1 And then, as you doubtless saw by the telegrams on the day of the race, the pot boiled over, for our young fellows-notvutlistandingtlic fact of pulling on strange water, hundreds of miles from home, in the most miserable of Weather. against the pick of Victorian oarsmen, won the race, it is said easily, by nearly two lengths so sure is it that you never can tell until the number s are up " And now they have suddenly leapt into high favour here, and will be banqueted and congratulated and all the rest of it on their return , although, when they left, they vi o e looked upon as a sort of job lot, who had a pretty stock of self assurance to date set themselves up to represent the colony against the oarsmen of Victoria So fine is it that nothing succeeds like success This is the fifth annual race, and the second time New South Wales has been victorious Next year the contest will take place in Port Jackson From the race of Saturday to that of Ti Rickett v Hanlan, which takes place to day in London, is a very natural transition of the mind Trickett, who used to be "first favourites these colonies, has of late had few friends, for has he not been unsuccessful and is not non success looked upon by the world, if not as a sm, certainly as a demon it Little head, indeed, has been taken of late of the boat race of to day, the betting being exceedingly limited It is a foregone conclusion that the Canadian must pull it off, although one or two "know ones that is to say, they think themselves to have been heard to say that matters have been so arranged by the betting fraternity at home that if Trickett Ï/ÎOWM win, Hanlan will almost at once come into possession of the finest hotel in America How ever the result will be known among you long before this letter reaches Brisbane Sporting matters generally have been pretty brisk, and the clubs are now preparing for the football season It is hoped that among other visitors during the season we shall have a team from New Zealand, whose footballers usaid to lie the very devil in a sea damage During the week there elias bcenaicgatta and a series of su winning matches, and at these latter M'Indoc, the Australian champion is said to have made better time in the distance of 4000 yards than the celebrated 1 english champion Professor Beckwith the difference being piece of IJ } oils This may or may not be true but person ally it is i of water to which the w or ds cure (franc crisis may be applied There can be no doubt however, that Al Indoe is a magnificent sw farmer and there is some talk of sending him home by subscription to swim the English champion And it this talk it is likely to rcm in unless Ineketl should pull off the boat race This was our 1 pt ob ibl), make a difference, is we might well be proud if we could be it Engl md in cricket, i owing md s i training.', too-to say nothing of foote thing, which will yet be done, and boomcitinging, in the remote distance is da) Archibald Forbes aimed at Auckland (N Z ) from Amend, and the great little soothe his agent in 8) (his), f i in Melbourne.
