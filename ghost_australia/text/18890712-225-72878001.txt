]poetry. Conscience and Future Judgment. B CInALhES W. TSTUDie. I eat alone with my coneaience. In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I should have to answer The question it put to me, Andto lace the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten notions Came dfloating before my eight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my paet life Was an awful thing to face, Alone with my conEcisncO riiting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, Ina land that then was the future, not now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking 01 the judgment day to be, fat sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To thia land beyond the grave; Bet no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then Iflnt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, Forit was but the thought of my pat life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Had a warning of yesterday And I pray I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may inot cry in the future And no one come to save. And so I have learned a lemon Which I ought to have known before, And which, though 1 learned in dreaming, I hope to fcrget no more. Si I sit alone with my conscience, In theplace where the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful 0oo'00 it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough forme.
