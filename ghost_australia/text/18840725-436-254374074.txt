The compilers have done their work with great and painstaking care, aud though thoy do not in every case guarantee tho pedigree and performances of the ghosts, they have taken every means to verify them. Persons desiring to make the acquaintance of a ghost will be able to do so, and, whatis more to the point, they will beabletoselect theparticular class of ghost they desire. â€¢ They will, for instance, find such items as the following : Ghost of John Smith, such-and- such a street.
