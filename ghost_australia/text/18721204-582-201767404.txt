How-far- this very explicit- injunction - is obeyed by those who, both when being ordered as deacons, and when " receiving the Holy Ghost" as priests, solemnly promise to be diligent in teaching the people committed to their cure and charge, is a point upon which we do not' profess to be well informed.

Fijian outrages have taken place at Nadi, this time being the burning of -two small houses, belonging to Messrs'. 'Muir. A mountain youth, who confesses to-being the In- ; cendiary, was captured, and stated that he was ! induced to fire the premises by the turaga-na- vesa. The youth who had set fire to the houses was sentenced to receive forty, lashes, and then to work for two years on a white man's planta tion. The turaga-na-veBa was sentenced to re ceive fifty lashes. The tribe who wore accessory to the deed were fined, and promised to give a piece of land to the Messrs. Muir for losses sus tained by the fire. This is the sixth case of burning which has occurred within about 1 the : last three yenrs at Nadi, and, witli this excep- : tion, without any clue to the guilty parties. The settlers have, however, without- either the sanction or knowledge of the Government, ; adopted strong repressive and retributive mea sures, Mr Scott's saw mills, at the! back/of Ovala, have been burnt down. The fire. is. be lieved to be the act of incendiary natives. ' 'The Maria Douglass proceeded round : the island for the purpose of inquiring Into the matter. On Monday, 11th November, before entering port, the Ethel, man-of-war schooner, gave .chase to a Fijian schooner, the Mary, which Bhe over hauled for the papers in Fijian waters. The Times hopes that the, Government will resent this, insult to the Fijian flag, and demand fitting and ample apology from Britain. Captain Ilill, of Rabi, has been brought up at the wardon's court, and charged before Messrs Brougham and Emberson with being accessory to tlib mur der of several natives. , The charge, was pre ferred on (be aiiousation of some Fijian who was notpresont at the oourt.
