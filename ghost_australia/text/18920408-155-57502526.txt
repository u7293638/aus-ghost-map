A GHOST IN , PALACE. If I were to tell my friends and acquain tances of this practical ago that I lived fcr some years in a palace at my ease. had -free right to wander over its magniflcent apart. ments, to dip?ort myself in its tennis courts aid illeijuro grounds, with vasald2 'o . rather;, ,asvaso. --at my, etdei. tho.. would' wki, :sbhako. their, . knoing helsdpn.d probably ask.ma ;If.

We kent. no servant (my `vasal);.' uame Matilda fledges, a damsel whoborrowed old' style books from thie irculating library, and I went-, to bed replete with. horrors every, night. Occasionally Iwould,.creep down' to the kitchen-it had been a ervaite',halIlin former days-to give Matilda a scare...

One nightl-I think itwas in the middle of' Otober--a mighty storm of wnid and rain Swept:o'r! the anocent city. The gale howled-adti shrieked like a' pack of fiends let loose upon' a tortured -world.. Windows rattled, signboards creaked, huge staoks' of chimniey i ob?bd, and every now and' then came a cr.sh telling of destruction of pro ar d echaps injury to limb and life. yfathe?was at work in a room at the top of the h~use, but he could- stand it no longer.'

My grandmother, who resided with us iat the time, referred him at once: to Buuyan's "Holy War," and to improve the' oo?oasin, fished that most excellent book from a,book i ease, and began to read from it in as soloemn tones as though she yore refreshling. our [ memories with the Service for the" Burial of Sthe Dead.

But my fatherwns in no mood for singing. He ordered me'to bed, and I started on.the 'dark jourbey up stairs, and finally 'f:tond myself in my accustomed bodrdom. .It contained no less than five windows, with diamood.ehaped panes, each'.-being opened with an Iron bar drilled witb hole, to be fitted to a peg as occasion demanded.1 .Our forefathers, we are told,'wero helavy drinkers, and in one respect I am certaladhey were fond of drmughts. When those windows were partly open, it was a fight between cold 'nuthe head andoontitution, and the former 'ienerally'gained the mastery. There were tallonpboards, too, in that room, in which -men six (eet high could have stood upright without fear of knocking their heads, and huge beams, such as would make a "jerry buider" of to-day stare, orosing the coiling. My little bed stood near the door-a massive oak affair fitted with an iron latch, locally termed -a " anatch"-and many a night when the moonbeams played at hie and-.eek with the shadows of the ivy, I have lain and wondered what sort of people oc coupied that room when the duke a:nd his friends quaffed saok and canary out of golden goblets. rAt th'tiLnaeurM wh .Lain writing I ..wa just sixteen yaara of age';, afron, healthb', - ' ' and In ao wea- Bdperstitiouq:.?'.o IU nal'" ch, '" anplace.' hai-t hnight ,brnge nold a'arie a plentiful am sg~en gooso'.i.ca 'iw t '%.istaoenr.. tilide?tralrkeal the ghost. nonsense out of , Ispi a~d w m' uual Bs any I.' yoitl anap'inarn~ vllawith-a poleicsmi of " kpoont dixty ebfacornae ithid' -roidj ara- *-h - tti h tried mtwelIve, , ib - ; S 1't lhtes provocation. . .. .
