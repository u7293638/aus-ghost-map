The SlRajah tlahmanha was a direct descendant of a long line of princes, and, according to Simrha's doscriptlion, wan nlarvellously rich, proud as Lucifer, arrogant and cruel. Ifis domain was of largo extent, and was situated in the district known as Odeypore. ' Can you tell leo,' I asked of Simrha, it you have 0ver knownt of a I[tndoo pince called atvana ?' 'Yes, ealib,' le replied. Tuse Rlsalh Ravano was the father of tlto trajah Nahmanda.' It was only'eimy strong self'control and power to luppress suddon emotions which prevented me from leaping to my feat with a cry of joy. As it was, I started a little, for tihe answer he had giveon tolt me that, through some strange cireumstance, I had engaged an my servant one who was already connected with tle houselhold of the very Rajah to whom I least look for the information I sought in behalf of ogisecll's r.quest. It was then I began to question Stmria, and found hine so extremely reticent and so loth to gire me any details regarding the things I most wi?hed to know.

' If thle sahib does tnot intend to remala long, and will not visit Odeypora during Ills stay, I will readily cosoent to the lhrst part of the conditioln, he said, fillally, \- iBt it is to Oeryporo that I most desire to go,' 'Itl that case, sahib, I cannao remain in your service,' lWhy nota ' 1?,? ecaus I beolong to the household of tle oIajah 'Thlrn Ã½epacity do you servo him?' scerctary,' '"' b our country you would terim llut can you not s5le,.
