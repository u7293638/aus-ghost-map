CURRENT LITERATURE. In one respect Mr Henry Irving must be pronounced the most fortunate of all actors. There is no danger whatever of the world ignoring his genius In nothing is his art so conspicuous as actor and manager as in his arrangement to insure a favourable report of everything he performs. No actor was ever so continually on the stage, or more persistently playing, and it is impossible not to admire the skill with which in every piece the honour and the profit are made to circle round the personality of Henry Irving, ne Brodenp More books have been written to persuade the public that Irving is a great actor than about all the other famous geniuses in comedy and tragedy from Rurbage down to Charles Kean, inclusive If he is not recognised as a purer Garrick, as a kind of living Shakespeare, it is not the fault of the many critics who have striven, with what might seem almost superfluous pains, to exalt his merits More suppers have been held in his honour than over any celebrity of past or present times, and the quantity of wine which has been poured out in libations over this favourite idol of the English stage would suffice to float a first class torpedo launch Of course, we reject the unkindly theory which has suggested in the mind of one blasphemer a connexion between the fame of Mr Irving and " chicken and champagne " But it is impossible for an impartial mind not to be struck with the very elaborate arrangements which in every passage of his career, seem to have been made to keep Mr Henry Irving prominently before the eyes of the public In his progress through the United States he was attended by Mr Joseph Hatton, who has set down Hem a Irving's Impressions m Ama tea, in two volumes (Sampson, Low, and Co ) Of this great work, the readers first impression will be to marvel at Mr Irving s good luck at obtaining precisely. the kind of chronicler to suit best such a hero Whether it was Mr Irving who engaged Mr Hatton to report for him, or Mr Hatton who attached himself to Mr Irving, with a view to making a book, does not clearly appear from the narrative, nor even how much is Irving, and how much Hatton There is a certain convenience m leaving this latter point doubtful, other wise the modesty of either would have been exposed to a severe strain It is not that either of the gentlemen concerned in this publication is afflicted with any undue misgiving, as to his eminence in his profession, for we are no more allowed to forget that Mr Hatton is " the famous London correspondent of the 2/am York Times " than that Mr Irving is the delight of the British nobility and gentry, the companion of Prime Ministers and Chief Justices, and the one and only living medium of the Shakspearian drama Accompanied by Miss Ellen Terry and the whole Lyceum troupe, Mr Irving went to the United States last year, and returned with a rich harvest of dollars from first to last the expedition, as recorded by Mr Hatton, was a series of triumphs, involving, as it appears from Mr Irving's two prefaces, consequences not less momentous to the peace of two worlds than to the future of dramatic art From the earliest period, Mr Joseph Hatton had fixed the illustrious traveller and the style in which the moving story of the first appearance of Irving in New York River is told itself belongs to the highest drama, Mr Hatton is a novelist himself, and knows what belongs to art " Four o'clock in the morn morning, October 21, 1883 -A cheerful gleam of light falls upon a group of Lotos guests, as they separate at the hospitable doorway of that famous New York club, otherwise Fifth Avenue is solitary and cold. We are four Ac. The devoted band have got up thus early in order to meet living They encounter a formidable band of interview ears They are lying about the cabin of the river steamer in every conceivable posture, with an odour of tobacco in the oily atmosphere ' Needless to say they are thirsting for the person of the great English actor There are critics, also writing in the saloon, who talk about Irving and his art methods " New York, they say, " will not be dictated to by London, New York judges for itself Already malignity had been at work to traduce the coming guest Unflattering cheap photographs of Mr Irving had been sold about the streets copies of an untruthful sketch of his life had been circulated through the mails , the "London enemies of the great manager had been so active in New York that his friends were a trifle chilled at the outlook The ordeal of the interviewing was got through, however, very successfully Mr Irving making gn "t play with champagne and cigars, both of which incentives to a right judgment were introduced at a very early period Mr llattonisgoodenoughtodo justice to the New York reporters Though " socially they occupy the lowest station on journalism, ' he, the famous London carres pondent of the year York 7 and, is not too proud to admit their claims to intellectuality The best of them write graphically, and with an artistic sense of the picturesque ' They sometimes "develope into never pushed and powerful journalists, and in point of conversation and manners they are said to be quite worthy of the great journals they represent" But all this time we are leaving Mr Irving and Miss Ellen 'Terry on board the Britannic, waiting to be taken off Their first appearance is thrilling in the ex I treme "They step out into the yacht s pinnace, and some of us wonder if they are good sailors when Mr Irving suddenly up pears at the gangway pale, but firm A score of voices about, "There he is 'the band strikes up "Hail to the chief and Mr Irving ison board the press boat shaking hands with the interviewers Then suddenly they are arrested by what one young poetic soul amongst them promptly designates a vision of pre Kaphaelitc beauty ' His Miss Terry, who as bIic steps over the swinging plank with a pretty little shudder betrays herself "possessed of a marked individuality ' As for Mr Irving, he disappoints the crowd by reason of not being so individual as he was expected M here are his mannerisms i inquires one reporter of another Evidently there is a little disappointment, as Mr Irving annies like any ordinary poison as he pushes round the champagne He is tackled imme diately by the gentlemen of the press with notebooks in hand, and yields copy quite freely Then it is Miss Terry s turn, who is pronounced "not quite pretty, but handsome and distinguished " And this is New 'i York ' ' Miss Terry gushingly buys "And oh, what a liver So different from the 'I hanns lins pleasant) sitting them at their ease, one youngman more tasteful than the man ventures to ask her what is the last message she would like to send home to her friends " 1 eat them I never loved home so well as now, she answers, in her frank, impulsive way , then (urnsiivviij to hide her tears, while the too inquisitive reporter is set upon by his companions In this most delightful way Kpieadnu the arrival of Air Irving over nearly one half his first volume, does Mr Hatton discharge his duties of historiographer, with a result which must make the New York interviewers expire with envy Indeed, this was a muster stroke on the part of the great actor to bring his own interviewer with him, to get him to attend him in every passage of his tour, to chronicle his most private thoughts and actions. Here, at least, there was no room for the enemy-Mr Hatton being already persuaded that Mr Irving is the finest actor that ever lived, and Mr Irving taking no pains to disguise the fact that, if there is a judicious critic on earth, it is Mr. Hatton Under these agreeable auspices, it is needless to say that Mr Irvine's triumphs are recorded with an entire and perfect enthusiasm To the American audience he was a revelation, chiefly and especially because he had no mannerisms " I never was more agreeably surprised," said one eminent critic, after hearing him "The things that have been said about his man- nerves are shameful Why, he has no more mannerisms than Booth " He spoke they all declared, with delighted surprise, " like an educated American " On one delicate point, on which even the Irvingites are apt to speak a little dubiously, there was A consensus of flattering opinion. Unkind things have been said of Mr Irving's legs. Bia walk has been disparaged as stiffy, and his general formation of limb has given occasion to the enemy to blaspheme But to our confusion we discover that if there was one thing the Americans admired about Mr Irving and the Lyceum company generally, it was their excellence in respect of their lower limbs " It walks well, said the Boston manager, 'it is the best company on its legs I have ever Been Our young men, as a rule, particularly in costume, turn out their toes too much, or are knock kneed, all your people stand well on their feet - it is a treat to see them ' All it) is must be extremely gratifying to Mr Irving a admirers and must tend to cement the good feeling which his visit has engendered on both sides of the Atlantic It would be tedious to recount all the happy things which happened in the course of this momentous trip, the profits of which, it is pleasant to know, were quite on a par with the most sanguine expectations, having been equal to some £80,000 in English money Of Mr Hatton s stupendous style it is enough to say that it matches well with Mr Irving a For the first time in fact, we are able to realise from this book some of those great qualities which have conduced to make Mr Irving the consummate actor and manager he is My Ducats and My Daughter (C Kegan, Paul, and Co.) is an excellent novel by a new hand though clearly not an inexperienced writer who chooses to keep his name con created the story is a plain, simple one, clearly told, which by sheer force of clever writing, without much originality in the plot or the incidents, becomes interesting. The characters are somewhat slightly stretched, at least those who play the leading parts but some of the minor ones are capital, especially those which are drawn, obviously, from the author a experience Among these last is an editor, Mr Mallory, whom perhaps some readers will be in timed to identify with a well known ex journalist In Borne points however the portrait can hardly be said to be that of Mr Morley, whose best friend or worst enemy never could say of him that he was " a kind of Apolbon become near Mr Mallory is a far more attractive person than any real journalist we ever heard of London editors of the present day are rather smart business" men, shrewd speculators in articles, leviathan news men, than idealists of destroyers. Mr Mallory, however is sufficiently near to what an editor should be, and is drawn by one who knows enough of the real business to make the portrait it not true, like the truth "He never refused an invitation from Dives or my Lord-if Dives were sufficiently rich, and my Lord sufficiently exclusive At these entertainments Mr Mallory contrived to put a strong curb on his chance political feelings, and surveyed the silver, the liveries, and the flowers without so much as murmuring in the ' A scene in the sub editor 8 room of the Forum is admirable and may be contrasted with some of the absurd pictures of journalistic life which appear in novels written by women One or two other characters in the book appear to be unmistakably from the life, as Lord Fnmavere, the young Radical nobleman, whose interest in the condition of his flying filly Belle Park. is almost equal to his enthusiasm for a grand old Statesman Have we not seen him lately in the flesh on this side of the equator? The gleanings from life lend much piquancy to the store, and there is nothing in them to offend the most fastidious taste Some of the most humorous passages in the book are those of a Scotch election, well worn as the subject would seem to be Indeed, if this is a first effort of the author in novel writing, he may be congratulated on a very genuine success in My Ducats and My Daughter It is difficult to account for the appearance of such books as Thoughts on Shakspeare s Plays, by the Hon Albert T G Canning (W U Allen and Co ). The thoughts of the Hon Albert Canning are such as might occur to a thousand of educated persons of the non literary class. They are expressed in language which is not above the standard of a mediocre schoolboy essay It is impossible that the world can want any of Mr Canning a thoughts. They lend nothing to the understanding of Shakspeare and are, in fact an affront to the poet What human being is likely to be better for having Shale apeare a purpose in his famous scene in Act 2 of ' Henry VI, 2nd part explained to him in this fashion-' Apparently Prince Henry's presence and patronage chiefly maintain this strange establishment for his previous short imprisonment by Judge Gus coigne has hitherto produced no permanent effect on the Royal scapegrace, who, never considering the mischievous example he sets to all the youth of England frequents the Boars Head Tavern with Falstaff when ever he can find time from his military duties, in which however, he always delighted o.C. In this bald fashion does Mr Canning interpret Shakspeare for whose benefit? may we ask Who has demanded that the line are of Shakspeare should he degraded to this pinchbeck' There is nothing in the historical plays which a child cannot understand, and if there were Mr Canning could not explain it Under this process all are light and life go out and nothing is left but dust and dry bones AS a critic either of the drama or of the history, he is beneath contempt Why are such books written? Why, being written are they published A very different kind of writer is Mr J A Symonds who tives us a thick volume on ShaLipearca Pt receivers in the English Drama (Smith Elder and Co) Mr S) moods well known for his aesthetic studies and as an authority on the Italian renaissance, is hardly the man from whom we should look for a satisfactory account of the pre Shaks peanut drama but he has executed his task with much refinement of taste, and on the whole with sufficient judgment In a somewhat fanciful introduction Mr by monds lies down the, principle that there is a process at evolution mall great works of the human mind which is in the oflice of the critic to discover and to follow Criticism ¡ seeks the individuality imprisoned in the germ, exhibited in the growth exhausted in the season, of decline Critical biography sets itself to find the man himself what made him operative, what hampered him in in lion, what after all the injuries of chance undue, survives of linn imperishable in the shoulder thoughts and things ' lime as he was in his individually, the eminence of Shakspeare's dramatic art would not have been possible, to speak in the language of the evolutionists without his car vernments He was the greatest in a long line of great win, whose work he carried on, land of whose claim he was the flower In him is embodied I and carried to the highest perfection the genius of the age He articulated what the nation struggled to express and it was that struggle out of which he was involved there were various forces which combine 1 to start the killing in 1 Inglis J and made it in an especial sense the expression of the national feeling audiences For the 3 afresh people, in the age of 1 Elizabeth when their intellect had for the first time a live scope, the drama was the expression of the national life. It was what the press is now, only in a purer form and with a wider scope for art " It meant,' buds Mr Symonds, with equal eloquence and truth, " the emancipation of the mind from medieval bond ate, the emergence of the human spirit in its freedom It meant newly discovered heavens, a larger earth, sail swept oceans, awakened continents beyond Atlantic seas It meant the pulse of now ascendant and puissant heart blood through a people conscious of their unity and strength-the puberty and adolescence of a race which in its manhood was destined to save social free dom to the world" to the drama was poured the spirit of all our art Sculpture and painting, as in Italy, we had none " But poetry, the metaphysic of all arts was ours ' Poetry, with the drama as its vehicle, conveyed to English minds what Italy, with her arts, her industries and sciences, had made manifest In Shakspeare all these rays of light were focussed, and it is he wore presents our dramatic genius in all its full news So far Mr Symonds has little difficulty in carrying the reader with him His next position, however, that Shakspeare found dry mate art already fixed when he began to write, is more questionable That Shakspeare did not stand alone that he and his fellow play wrights are interdependent and mutually [ illustrative-that he took much from those who went before him, and accepted help from his contemporaries may be admitted Yet, in the quality of his genius, he is so vastly superior in kind he is so different-that Dryden is not far wrong, who said that Shakspeare " found not but created first the stage ' Mr Symonds seems to have studied with great attention the works of the earlier dramatists, and he has followed carefully the development of tragedy and comedy in England But his method is a little tedious and his process desultory There can be no doubt, however, that he has produced a work which cannot but be of great value to the Shakespearian student and to the historian of the English drama. It is always dangerous to announce a new poet 1 here have been so many false starts deceptive first appearances that the critics have learnt to be cautious But a little volume of songs by Daniel Newry jun, (C Keegan, Paul, and Co ), entitled Under a Fool s Cap, seems to contain germs of real goodness in a fantastic dress The songs are narrations, humorous and pathetic, of themes suggested by the old nursery rhymes an idea good in itself, and affording room for original treatment On the text, for instance, of "Hark, hark, the dogs do bark, the beggars are coming to town,' we have the following charming study in colour - The gypsy scold In cloth of gold, An block and gnarled as Sin The pretty slut with nothing but Her shift to hide her skin And in the core of the mad uproar, Like a lily) blossoming A beggar maid ) of one arrayed Fast the glory of a kiln, "In her latter d cloud of a bridal shroud. And patches of white sauce, With her brown legs bare her thick black hair, And o) es of midsummer night Daniel Newry, jun , has a quaint turn of thought and a rare eye for colour There is more true poetry in his simple rhymes Under the Food s Cap than in half of the grand fancies of the wise. Ranch Notes, by Reginald Aldridge Longmans and Co ), is a record of experiences in cattle raising in the far American West, told with much simplicity and spirit Mr Aldridge gives on the whole a favourable account of cattle breeding as an industry in Northern Texas and Colorado, though probably the thing is being overdone like every other speculation in these days The price of a three year old east in Kansas City is from 30 to 40 dollars (62 to 66) a head The wages of men are, for riders, from 16 dollars a month in the Indian Territory, to 40 dollars in Colorado The whole expense of a ranch being roughly estimated at from one to two dollars per head of cattle per annum Nothing appears to be set down for the purchase or leasing of land though of course, as the country gets settled, the amount of waste land available for indiscriminate' grazing must be restricted Mr Aldridge seems to have done very well himself in the business, and he speaks well of the people of the country, having a good word even for the dreaded ' cow boy of texas. How ever he seems to have been gifted with an unusual amount of energy and good humour combined, and probably would have done well with his capital any where The/fat/>¡fcci Homes and family 'traditions of England by J H Ingram (W li Allen and Co.) would have been more interesting had the water either announced himself as a believer in the manifestations or taken pains to sift the truth of the stones But us he is neither a ps) chomantist nor a physical researcher, and simply sets down the legends as he has heard or read them, the book has but a faint reason for existence Neither j is its publication justified by anything in Mr Ingram start of telling the stones He is but a poor hand at telling a ghost story and often spoils one made to his hands by want of art or imagination Nor is the work by any means complete as a guide to English Ghoatland There are dozens of respectable ghosts, inhabiting decent houses, not to speak of No 35 Berkeley square, which are not mentioned here
