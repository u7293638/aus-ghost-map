SCOTCH FOLKLORE SKAESPEABE. AND At the usual meeting of the "University Shakspeare Society on Thursday the Rev. A. C. Sutherland, M-A-, ddivered a lecture on the above subject- Mr. Wybert Reeve, Vice-President, presided over a good attendance. The lecturer opened with a trraphic description of that "'God-forsaken iand." John o' Groais. His references to Srotch fclklore were limited - to the heaii.s and shaggy woods of the North, and he shewed how the fading race was gradually divesting itself of its old tongue, its old customs, its old superstitions, legends, â€¢mythical siories, rhymes, and mystic rites. The race, however, was not fading in intel- 3corr;sl vigour or enterprise. The fancies of folklore had been forbidden, but the whirligig of time brought its revenge, and to-day the despised story was summoned fioFi 'ihe sooty hut to the closet of the phi- loncpV.er, ar.d some went so far as to say that it-was the groundwork of our richest poetry, our philosophy, and our religion. il;e lecturer would not co so far as that. Vir. Sutherland dealt with intimate knowledge upon the witches in Shakspears and their contemporaries in Scotch folklore, and also showed the linked learning of the great poet with the fairies of the "Tempest" in the stories of the Highlands, indicating the characters in the plays as being somewhat synonymous with thos>e imaginary objects of Scotdi traditions, though the methods of magic in Shakspeare differed. An interesting lecture was" brought to a dose with some weird storiesof ghosts, which gave a creepy sensation to the listeners and created sympathy for the players in Shakspeare's pJay who had to deal with them.
