THE EIGHT OF WOMEN TO VOTE. Ill the Court of Common Pleapy on November Pr Lord Chief Justice Bovill, with Justices Willes, Byles and Keating sitting in banco, judgment was given in the case of " Cborltou, appellant, v. Lings, respondent," the appeal from a decision of the revising barrister for Manchester, which was argued on Nov. 7\. The Lord Chief Justice and the other judges delivered separate judgments, but they all agreed that there was not suffi cient authority for saying that fey the common law women had had a right to vote for members of Parliament ; whilst, on the other hand, there was the uninter rupted practice of centuries to show that women had not voted. There was no re ported case in favour of the vote, except that in a note to " Olive y. Ingram" there was reference to a manuscript re port of a case to show that women could vote. This note was only to be foundjn 7_" Modern lieports," whilst there was 110 reference to any such case- in Strange ; and Lord Coke gave his express opinion the other way. In his (the Chief Jus tice's) opinion the Ueforin Act of 1867 in saying that men should vote, although considered in conjunction with Sir John B-omilly's Act, did not entitle women to vote. The term men in the Heform Act did not include women; and even if it did, then women would come within the term " incapacitated." For these reasons he thought that the decision of the revis ing barrister refusing the vote should be affirmed, but he also thought that it was a case in which no costs should be allowed. Mr Justice Byles said that he hoped that their unanimous decision, coupled with j the unanimous decision of the Court of [ Session in Scotland would for ever exor cise and lay this ghost of a doubt which ought never to have arisen.
