Gawler Catholic Otrarch. REV. PRIOR BUTLER. O.C.O.. D.D. S.S. Peter's and Paul's Church was crowded o£p$ffiiay but, especially in the evening, mien' the Ber. Prior Bntler, O.C.C., D|P^a former priest of the G*wler Church, b&aijnrof; Melbourne, oooopied the pulpit. The rev. gentleman enjoyed a high reputation as a pulpit Orator when he resided here, but since tnat time his reputa tion has, been considerably enhanced, and now he is regarded as having no superior in Australasia. His subject on Sunday evening was the part played l-y the Holy Ghost in the work of the redemption of man. In the sanctifica tion of man and his salvation it was fitting tbat the adorable Trinity should be all engaged. Christ ascended on high after His resurrection, and then the Holy Ghost was sent to continue the work which Christ had began by the will of his father. Who were the apostles, upon whom the Holy Ghost descended ? They were poor ignorant men, without thought, fishermen, They werechoBen by Christ ;* 'they did. not choose him. If the narrative was loitowea.ana we noticed how these men were .instructed we would come to the\ ^opnolosioh . that they were very ignorant, unlettered men, for after being taught for- three years by Christ and wit nessing fteMiracleB Which he did, they still remained in ignorance, and even the simplest figure of apeeoh had to be explained to them. They were men of no intellectual training whatever. Simple minded, but possessed of good natural qualities was thd sum total men. What was the object Christ had in wleotingftWajnen? He told them that he was to qjepart, but they were to remain and carry on the work which he had began. He had oonverted very few in his life time. He performed many wonSirf ul works, but there were vary 'lew v*rho turned, over to be followers of Christ in his life time. Now this work was to remain, and it must neces sarily be cmied on by livln^men, Hehimself was to ascend to his Father, having worked our sarvatioti by aying for nsj but the applioa«m; J»f , that SalvaUpn to each in dividual twas *© «ndure to -U time.

The apostles were sent forth to teach men the mysteries of God, the incarnation and resarreotion of Jesus Christ.

Kihermen, unlettered fishermen. How did they speak ? With authority. Why did they speak with authority ? Because Jeeus told them to do so. could they err in their teaching? They 0 )uld not, for it was the spirit that dwelt in them, the Bpirit of truth. Was there lesB necessity now for infallable teaching than there was in the first century 1 Or rather might we not say that as the ages go by the greater reason there is why there should be an infallible teacher in the world, not a letter, because a letter cannot teaeh of itself. There must be a living authority as the apostles were men and talked with the tongues of men, but under the authority and injunction of their Divine Master. The great function of the Holy Ghost was to teach the apostles truth, and arm them with this truth and send them forth into the world as heralds oE truth, and abide with them for ever. That Holv SDirit that was given to the apostles still remained in the Church of God. There was but one church of all churches that claimed to be that church. There was only one church which could say — ' I am now what I always was ; I am now as young and as old— old in age but young in strength and in activity.' It combats to-day, as it did in the past, the errors of human kind, errors ot false philo sophy, errors of religion, errors of politioil economy, and other errors present in the world. There wsb but One voice of authority that rings throughout the whole world at present, It was not the voice of an Emperor or Ring, but the voice of an old man in the Vatican at Home, successor of Peter, Prince of the apostles. And he to day, as Peter did, conscious of the power he received, conscious of the keys that were delivered to him;, tjonsciousof. the abiding, spirit in the chhrch that lie rnles4nd guide*, that old man of the Vatican ^spoke with authority to over 250 millions of men, differing in language, in manners and customs, and who notwithstandihg'the antagonism of all theae things yet bowed down in obedience and reverence to the voice of the vicar of Jesus Christ. Had the world ever seen such a spectaole before ? 'finch an empire over ioindB|so dissimilar and so diverse? There was but one cause to which this could be assigned and it was that the Holy Spirit /which was. to teaoh all truth dwelt, with them. The spirit of troth dwelt with them ' *nd would do always even to the consuma* tion of the world.
