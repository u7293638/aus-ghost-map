FOREIGN SIIIPMASTERS IN THE i IERCANTILE HARINE, A DEPUTATION, consisting of Captains J. C. Bounding, E. E. ?Brett, and R. C. Ghost, in troduced by Mr. Ilurlcy, M.L.A., waited upon thile Premier, Sir Henry J'arkes, on Tuesday, and called his attention to an in justice which they alleged was being done to their profession by the Marine Board of New South Wales allowing foreigners- mon who were not British subjectl:s, and who hbad not at any time served on board a British vessel-to obtain British certificates of conm petency as shipmasters. They pointed out that no other country in the world allowed such privileges to foreign subjects. The ex istence of suche an injustice as this was driv ing colonial shipmasters and oficers off the waters, tlheir places being taken by foreigners, holding shipmasters' certificates n?cepting a nmuch lower salary, which was in many cases not much higher than the seamen obtained. Such a state of things was a great risk to the public and thie shippers of cargo. These objections would not be raised if tllese men had. resided some years in the colony, and became naturalised British sub jects .before they were allowed to apply for these British certificates. In terms of emor geney, in time of war, tlhese men would leave and claim tle protection of their Consul, or could assist an enemy in injuring our com merce. The deputation pointed out that a great number .of coasting vessels were eom mnnded by foroigners. T'hey hoped that these important matters would receive consideration. Sir Henry Parkes, in reply to the deputa tion, promised that the representations which hiadl been made should be properly considered by the Governnunt, and that an 'inquiry should be made into the ciroumstances allege- to exist.
