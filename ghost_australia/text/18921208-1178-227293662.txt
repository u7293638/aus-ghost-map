AT THE CENTRAL. For a Rainy Day. Feminine Frivolities. Italian Music— And What Kate Brown Thought of It. ! William Fleming and William McDonald wero sent to gaol for six weeks and one month respectively on a charge of stealing a waterproof coat, value 7s. 6d., the property of Timothy Ryan. Frederick Smith, 10, and William Smith, 8, were remanded to the custody of their parents, having been locked up for protec- tion at 9 o'clock last night. Minnie Wilson, 20, Vera Young, 19, Annie Taylor, 21, and Elizabeth Burrows, 28, pass cut for a whole week for making things hum in Hay-street at a little before 11 last night. Maggie McDonald, 35, was fined 10s., in default seven days, for a drunk and disorderly performance in Elizabeth- street, and Martha Waters was similarly dealt with for a like performance in Bel- more Park about the time the ghosts on the other side of the road were shaking them- selves up for their constitutional. James Anderson, 19, clerk, was fined 10s., levy and distress, in default seven days, for riotous behavior in Liver- pool-street at 11 o'clock last even ing. The voice of Alfred Allen was heard by Constable Garden at a quarter to 1 this morning in Factory-street, and as the language was rather thick, Alfred was gathered into the fold and asked to pay 10s. or go out for a week. Kate Brown, 33, after being fined 10s. for drunkenness, was asked to explain certain hostility shown to a juvenile Italian harpist named Vincent de Luca. It appeared from the evidence that while Kate was suffering the effects of yesterday's terrible heat she saw the lad meandering along the street with his wild harp slung behind. She rushed him like a mad bull, and the lad and harp went down like skittles. It was good fun for Kate while it lasted, but unless she parts with £3 for the assault and 30s. for the damage to the harp she will retire to an establishment where there are no harps for two months and 21 days.
