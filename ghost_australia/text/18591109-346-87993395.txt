TO THE SHADE OF K R M P R N F BI J D T. I (Per favor of the Bcndigo Advertiser,) Most. Illustrious Grhost,-I have always been under tlic impression Mint your noble ghostship is perpetually flitting about Spithead-the inenio riiblo grave of one of England's finest frigates. Who would have imagined that. you would have taken the trouble to visit so distant a place as Australia, seemingly for Mie express purpose of inditing a letter lo the BENDIQO ADVERTISER? Tell us what sort of a passage you had out here. Did you come overland, or was it a subaqueous trip? Could you help us in laying a submarine telegraph at any time should we requiro your valuable assistance ? " Forgive blest, shade" my unworthy suspicions, feeling certain that the letter before referred to is the insane production of a spurious shade, who deserves to be put. under a glass shade and exhi bited as a model of thick- headed stupidity This "impudent humbug" has not only taken your name but mad". an egregious donkey of himself by rushing into print and confounding Co roper's immortal lines with an humble imitation, commonly known as a parody. Poor fool! he says there is a great similarity in the two, and talks of poetic license. I will wager any sum he doesn't understand the meaning of poetic license. If your original ghostship should ever perchance come across his lamented effusion, pray repudiate the unwarrantable liberty taken with your name, and oblige Your obedient servant (in the flesh), C. U. T. 8th Nov.-, 1850
