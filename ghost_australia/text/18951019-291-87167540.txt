THE FOURTH 'AT HOME.' There was a fairly large attendance at the fare well matinee given by the celebrated American humorist, Mark Twain, at the Theatre Royal on;Wednesday, and the repetition of the collec tion of stories given at his second ' At Home ' gave universal satisfaction. . The audience fairly revelled in the humor of the incidents surrounding the stolen water-melon, and the gigantic enterprise known as Tom Sawyer's crusade tickled them still further. The pathos with which' the story of the old negress separated by slavery from her children was invested made a lasting impression, and the concluding ghost story as related by Uncle Dan'l riveted the attention and awakened the interest of the audience in a marked degree. Loud and continuous applause was accorded the prince of humorists at the conclusion of the ''At Home,' and a large number of the audience assembled on the platform of the railway-station to see the last of Mr. Clemens, who left for the eastern colony by the Mel bourne express. Among those who met to bid him farewell were his Excellency the Lieu tenant-Governor, the Commissioner of Public Works and Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. C. A. Murphy the American consul, Sir E. T. Smith, several members of Parliament, and other leading citizens. Mr. J. Moule, M.P., waited on the Com missioner of Public Works on Thursday, October 10, and presented a numerously signed memorial asking to have the road repaired between Beltana and Angepina. The Commissioner promised to get a report.
