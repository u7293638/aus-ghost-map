THE CORPORATION CRUSHER. To the Editor of The Herald. Sir,â€” -This mighty monster of modern locomotion was industriously nt work last night in Collins street, crushing aud literally pulverising some patches of nowlv spread metal ra a manner that would havo deligh'orl any quartz mining company's mannqer, if in want of a ciu.hing machine. That snob a roller is of u>o for smoothing and o uisolidating newly me tailed streets ami roads, under certain obvious oonditions, is no doubt true, but tbo unmitigated folly of repeatedly passing such a ponderous machine over two or three inohos of metal, uubiiader', with a dry, hard un yielding surface under it, ought to have been manifest to tho veriest tyro in load-making, and ono wonders why it was not so to those who directed the woi k to be done. Better to havo paid the men to smoko their pipes than burn coato to do niiKehie''. GHOST OF MACADAM. G';h August, 1873.
