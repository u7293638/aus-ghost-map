THE CINEMATOGRAPHE. This machine-for it is simply a ma chine, however much what is called photo graphic art as distinguished from photo graphy may have to do with the construc tion of any of the parts of which it is composed-was at work in Payne's hall on Saturday night and again last nighlt. And a wonderful machine it is. It pre sents a series of " living pictures," as real ill a certain sense as the Pepper Ghost pictures, except that the subject of the pictures are greatly more remote-in the one case the person whose image was reproduced was in the flesh, close by, near a mirror-in the other the figure is surrounded by the actual environment of life far away, on London bridge, going south, for instance, and seems to move and live and have hits being both here and twelve thousand miles away. It is really wonderful. Fancy the difference between this show and the Marrionette. And some of us are old enough to remember when the Alarrionette appeared the most extraordinary illusion. -Renders of a controversy not yet closed in the columns of a daily Melbourne paper on the sub ject of spiritualism who have seen the cinematographe should be able to be sorry for the credulousness which is convinced by the cleverness of a Paulus. What the machine does is to reproduce with great rapidity a series of photos taken with incredible quickness. It is too late in the day, however, to explain it. What really remains to be done is to go to see it. And then what a surprise ! Even apart from the novelty of the pro cess these pictures are interesting pic tures, there is nso large a variety that to one person the best is not the favorite with his neighbour-the hunting piece catches the sympathies of some-the street scene holds the eye of another. It is altogether quite curious.
