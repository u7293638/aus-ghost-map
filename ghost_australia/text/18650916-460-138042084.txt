ANGLING. "ALAS, POOR GHOST !" TO THI IDROB OT TBS AU8TB>TJHtiW. Sir,—If by my small contributions to your paper, I hod done nothing but waken up old " Izask's Ghost," I think I can take some credit to myself. I bare read his last letter carefully, and I am convinced that " I have done the state (fishing) some service" by bringing him out of his shell. I only wish that a few gentle men would follow the " Ghost's" example, and jot down their good and ill luck j for it is just of as much importance to know the one as the other, and I have no donbt that in a short time, there would be a very respectable regi ment of the knights of the stick and string. A few such letters as Mr. " Ghost's" would whet the angling appetite. My own experience, on the day mentioned by him in his epistle, is simply this:—I Went, I saw, and did not think that the water was in a fit state for fishing; so I jogged home again, without wetting my line, for leave found out by experience, that it is a waste of time, money, and patience, to attempt to kill bream when the water is like pea-soup, and running at the rate of about I six knots an hour. But for all that, I should have been delighted to have made a quartette of the trio, if only for the sake of the sail, for it certainly was one of the days you read about only in Mrs. Cbisbohn's literary effusions. Hoping that the u Ghost" and his firiends may have better luck next time, and that he will be equally candid on the subject, I em, Ac., PIKE. Akguxo Befobt.—We here been in formed that tome fine bream hare been caught during the put week at Greenwich. About half a doren in all were taken by Messrs. Davidson and Larkins, the largest of which weighed about two and a half pounds. The water was very muddy and thick.
