And there men stoned Fisidiei. In havens of that haunted coast, ..mid the myrtles of the shore, The moon sees many a maiden ghost Love's outcast now and evermore. The silence hears the shades deplore Their hour of dear-bought love; but thee The waves lull, 'neath thine olives hoar, To dreamless rest, Pisidic I -A?ndreos Lang in the entury.
