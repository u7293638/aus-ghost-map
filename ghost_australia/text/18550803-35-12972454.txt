THE CITY OF SYDNEY. The city slumbered, senseless and reliant, Drowned with a dcatn-lcep from the wine success : Not even in form commanding, or defiant, But in the naked shame of helplessness. Are you in downy beds, yo happy sleepers t Dreaming of ingots heaped on every side Where are your watchers, where your faithful keepers ! Within your port six armed vessels ride I , Around your Barrack gates, four hundred Mines, Are ready to mow down each passed out . A thousand and have h indi upon your guineas, Look to your honest throats, yo burghers stout I List 1 Idle sleepers ! to your shrieking children ; Look to your wives, your city is in flame I Dullards I delay not till the hour bewildering Closes around you with eternal shame. Where your watchers, where are your defenders ! The ghost of Volunteers alone replies I- / Not such was Sparta and her ancient splendours, As now they pass before my waking eyes. Australians ! whom a fate portentous urge, Start into mnnhosd,-brook no base dula) ยก List to the Bonn is above Time's moaning surges ; Look at your Sun, and be ye men to day. H. H. July 27th, 1855. \-- life BRIGADE ORDER The Yeomanry Cavalry, Artillery, and Rifles, will parade in the Outer Domain, to-morrow, the 4th instant, at 3 o'clock, p.m., to be brigaded with her Majesty's 11th Regiment.
