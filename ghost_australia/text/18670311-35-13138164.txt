" GEORGE FOX " As Abridgment of an Address delivered to the Society of Friends, by C H Spurgeon, inDevonshire House Meeting House, Bishopsgate-street on Tuesday evening, November 6th 1866. Charles Gilpin, Esq , M P , in the chair. Friends -I shill not be expected to-night to enter into the doctrinal opinions of George Fox, Many of you well know, the opinions which I have set forth, and which I believe to be contained in God`s Word; and you know also that these are very different from the theological teachings of George Fox would not be profitable to enter into controversy tonight, nor are we at all in the frame of mind for it, and I shall not, ttherefore, introduce any discussion of the doctrinal teaching of George Fox. lndeed, doctrinal teaching does not appear to me to have been George Fox`s forte. We have to look to his successors and his immediate disciples for a fuller and clearer Iaying down of the theological basis of your Society than we find in Fox himself. I look upon George Fox rather as a practical than, as a doctrinal man, and as experimentally carrying out in his own life the work of the Spirit of God rather than as being a creed maker, or as fashioning formula or framing propositions to which any man might be required to subscribe. I suppose that Fox would object to your own creed. I have the notion that he would object to any creed, as a creed , and that even if he agreed to vvhat was laid down, he would object to its being laid down at all. I think he would say, " No, these things may he true enough, but, lest by any means this creed should be used to bind another man` s conscience, I will not agree to it, I believe it and re- cive it, but I will not subscribe to it, lest it should become, as all creeds do become in process of time, mere dead letters and instruments of tyranny." Looking through George Fox`s life, and viewing him as the great champion of purely spiritual worship, one is inclined to say, with William 1 enn, that his epitaph might well be, ' Many sons have done vir- tuously, but thou excellest them all ; " for thought in his own age and in his own time there were many bright stars, jet there were some points in which George Fox outshone them all. There were some particular truths which it was given to him to feel more intensely and to set forth more vehemently and constantly than any other man of his own time, or than any other man since his time, more especially the great truth that religion is of the spirit, that it is an inward thing, and is not to be judged, and weighed, and accounted of according to the externals of a men, but according to his inmost soul. When George Fox appeared it was a singularly perilous age for true godliness, when a new band of witnesses must arise, or truth would be put to shame. Now it so happened that the Puritans were getting into the sere and yellow leaf, and the Independents, and Baptists, and other sects, who were at one time thoroughly and even remarkably spiritual, were grow- ing worldly, political, and vainglorious; the evan- gelical professors had come to feel that they were numerous and powerful, they had an opportunity of grasping the carnal sword, they embraced that oppor- tunity, and from that moment very many of them lost the spirituality for which they had been eminent. The danger was lest the evangelical sects should quietly settle down in one State Church, make a scramble for the good things of the Ecclesiastical Establishment, and preach each one after his own fashion, in the numbness of death rather than in the power of life. It did not quite come to that, but it did seem as if it would do so.The very men who were once most vehement for liberty, when they were downtrodden, were ready to put down others when they had the opportunity, and those who had vin- dicated the spirituality of Christ's religion were about to fall into formalism as soon as they had the opportunity of escaping from the galling yoke of oppression and persecution. At that very moment God sent into the world George Fox , who" must have been the most troublesome of men to those good easy souls who counted upon a quite season of sleep. They had said, " Soul, take thine ease ; thou hast much goods laid up for manv years " It was by the mouth of George Fox that God said to each of them, "Thou fool ! Very soon declining professors found that another . people would spring up to take their place, and that if they left the separated path and begin to mingle with the world, and to war with carnal weapons, God would find another people who should stand alone and vindicate his truth against all comers. George Fox, it seeing to me,was a blessing, not to you alone, but to the whole of Christendom. He was sent of God, not only with a view to this Society in after years, but to the Christian Church at large of that time, and to the Church of God in all times. I do believe that iunder God , directly and indirectly, perhaps more indirectly than directly, George Fox was the means of driving out from their nests those who were very willing to have feathered those nests well, and to have taken their rest. He stood up in the face of the Christian Church, and said to it, "No, thou shall not do this' Thou shalt not conform thyself to the world ; thou shalt not go into an unholy alliance with the State; there shall still be in the midst of th-e a spiritual people who shall bear their protest that Christ s kingdom is not of this world, and that reli- gion standeth not in forms and ceremonies, but is a matter connected with the inner man, and is the work of God s Spirit in the heart." Now, who was this man whom God thus raised up ' I cannot pretend to go through his life , besides you know it all, but if one might put a finger on one of the most beautiful events of his life, one would single out his conversion. He had a godly mother, but yet he needed conversion. He was an excellent lad, naturally disposed to everything that was serious, not at all given to the usual vanities of youth, not undu- tiful, not likely to run into vice, or even into ordinäry follies , and yet the truth was applicable to him, " Ye must be born again ' He was not exactly the kind of child that we should wish all our children to be, for a little of the natural sportiveness of youth, when it is not associated with sin makes the family hearth happy, and the prattle of childhood we would not re- strain. George was a special child, a prophet in his youth, a Moses acceptable with God, and, strangely enough, his parents thought to put him into the priesthood of the Church of England As Moses` s supposed parents would have made him king of Egypt, who was to be Egypt's greatest plague so Fox`s parents would fain have made him a helper of the Established Church, who was to help to trend it under foot. But, not- withstanding the gentleness of his disposition and the excellence of his deportment, like our own chil- dren he needed conversion, and that conversion, in God`s grace, came. He has given us a very interest- ing account of how the Lord met him in his solitary walks and musings ;how sometimes in a hollow tree, or in the open fields , God was pleased to reveal to him the discase of his nature, to direct him to the precious blood of Jesus, and to lead him to put his trust where I hope we are resting, where we must rest if we would enter Heaven upon the finished work of our dear Redeemer . He was terribly depressed and cast down, just as most of Gods children are when they arise and go to their Father. He was bewildered, perplexed, and afflicted by those from whom he ex- pected light and comfort. He tried to trust where you and l once looked in vain for succour , namely, in arm of flesh and in carnal confidences. He went to the supposed ministers of Christ, and found them to be miserable comforters, Some of them may have been real ministers of Christ but they were either in a bad humour or were not skilled in dealing with disordered minds , at all events, they were not able to meet the peculiarly deep and solemn exercises of this singular young man, whose "verilies" were as true as other men`s oaths, and whose conscience was wounded by matters which were sport to less spirtual minds. He found one of these divines as hollow as an empty cask , and another toId him to overcome his distress of mind by smoking tobacco, and singing psalms. He obtained from a third what is most excellent advice to any young man who can afford it, the recommendation to get married; another bade him join the volunteers. ' As he that poureth vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a sad heart " Poor remedies these for a distressed conscience ! Alas for the physicians who prescribe tobacco smoke mid bleeding as cures for a sinsick soul ! And yet what can the world do more for souls who are under the convincing power of Gods Spirit ; What remedies dost thou know of, poor blind world ? Thou canst not open the eyes of thine own blind sons and daughters , how then canst thou lead the children of light in the way of peace "Only one hand, the pierced hand, can heal the sinner`s woe" Fox, after going to one professor and another, enquiring as to this and that, at last found peace where we too found it, lf we really have it namely, from the love of the Lord Jesus. There is one passage in his " Journal " which has been quoted thousands of times, but you will not object to hear it again, it deserves to be printed in letters of gold. ' But, as I had foresaken all the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people for 1 saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hope in them and in all men was gone, so tint I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do, then, oh then, I heard a voice which saud, ' There is One, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition ' And when I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord did let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition-namely, that I might give Him all the glorv, For all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief as I had been ; that Jesus Christ might have the pre-eminence, who enlightens and gives grace and faith and power. Thus, when God doth work who shall let it ? And this I know experimentally. My desires after the Lord grew stronger, and zeal in the pure knowledge of God and of Christ alone, without the help of any man,book, or writing." After his conversion, George Fox took quite a sepnrate path among the Christiains of his age, and those who look at the time in which he lived cannot blame him, although sect making and seclusion are not in themselves commendable, If every young man here to- night should sit up as a separate religionist, I am not sure that he would deserve to be commended for it, for I find that those people who belong to no sect at all are each one a sect to himself, and in their unsectarian zeal they make sects by wholesale, and foolishly hope to create union by fomenting division. On the whole it is best for the present distress that each man should unite with those Christian people who appear to him to walk most according to the Scriptures, and have the most spiritual life, not separating ourselves for mere novelty or love of singularity, lest we be found following our own devices whilst we imagine that we are following the Spirit of God. However, supposing it to be your firm conviction that no man has a right to rule another in matters of conscience, and that you found all the sects more or less approving of legislative interference in religion, which would you unite with ;Consistency makes you answer, "None at all' You would say, "No, if I unite with a Christian society I am, to some extent, accountable for what is done by that society, and I cannot share the responsibility of actions and opinions which lead to persecution ' When Episcopalians clipped the ears of Puritans, what spiirtual man would become an Episcopalian ; When Presbyterians hated toleration and turned the dungeon key on lovers of the Liturgy, how could these who hated oppression join with them ? Al- though our hearts with all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,yet if they do these naughty things we cannot unite with them. Moreover, George Fox`s doctrinal views were such that he could scarcely have consorted with any then existing Christian deno- mination. Be those views right or wrong, he would have been a dishonest man to suppress them, and if he received them, as he believed he did, from God, if he had not held them nnd proclaimed them, he would have been a traitor to his trust. If he could not be faithful in viable communion with others, what could he do but walk with God, and before men walk alone. George Fox thought that a kingdom of tins world could not be the kingdom of Christ, and that enforced support of ministers by state aid was only fit for hirelings and false prophets. I have sometimes said that there was an old superstition that the royal hand would heal disease, but that the truth was far otherwise, for whenever the king puts his hand on the Church of God it causes disease. Never has any more evil event happened to the Church of God than when that baptized heather Constantine pretended to be a Christian, and set up Christianity as a State Church . Upon this matter the whole spirit of Fox`s teaching is decided and clear. Besides, Fox was a man with so many angles and corners that he was best alone, or with others who would recognise his gigantic spiritual proportions He could not do as some people do, put his conscience into his pocket and say nothing about it. There are some passages in his "Journal" which one ought not to read just before going to bed, be- cause one would lie awake thinking of them, or else would dream about them .Readily may a tender mind wet the pillow with tears of grief, to think that man could so torture his fellow man under pretence of doing God service. He was frequently immured in dungeons, where it would have been a detestable cruelty to have confined dogs. How many months he spent in prison we need net here tell, but you may count by years the period in which he was a prisoner of the Lord, and although, I doubt not, he found, as Rutherford did, that though man had put him in a prison that prison became a palace to him, yet the dungeons were loathsome to an inconceivable degree. Sometimes he was compelled to re- main upright both day and night, because it was ""impossible to lie down, the filth being over the tops of his shoes, with no possibility of clearing it out, filth of the most abominable kind, and too foul to mention, being poured upon him from above, and coming reeking into his nostrils from beneath. One can hardly tell what his sufferings must have been in the form of rheumatism and neu- ralgia . He was a life-long martyr, If any of us had to suffer for one week what he had to suffer for six months together our bodily frames would bear more painful memorials of the strain. His pain of body must have been extreme ; and yet with all that how little he says about it ! As an eagle outsoars the clouds, so does he rise above the influence of his outward man. In his persecutions he stands before us as a true man, a complete man, one of the noblest types of manhood, a model of what gracious manhood may become. When falsely accused we find him declaring the gospel of Jesus Christ to his persecutors as boldly as though they were his friends. You cannot but love him. Even if he had preached false doctrine we must have sympathised with his sufferings; but teaching, as he did, some of the noblest of truths, what shall we say of him !. As for his labours, he shames us in the present day, The man was everywhere. He flew as swift as a seraph in obedience to his Lord . He preached the gospel in almost every town and every village, from Falmouth up to Aberdeen, and then crossed the Atlantic to preach to the settlers and the Indians in the land of the setting sun. When did he rest ? Filthy prisons could not have yielded him ease, and yet a sojourn in jail was the only rest he had. He was a man all ablaze with the fire of zeal and the light of unselfishness. We all like a little recreation now and then, and need it, but he had it not. Who is there amongst us who has not had a fortnight at the sea-side at least this year, and felt he wanted it ? But Fox had no fortnights, nor even minutes of rest. It was all work, work, work, from the day when he found himself saved till the day when he died in harness, and slept because his work was done, and his Master had said to him, " Friend come up higher ." Oh that those who are engaged in the service of God would learn to emulate his industry ! We frequently hear complaints about the hardness of the Christian service, but ought they ever to be raised ! We get weary in preaching perhaps, but if we preached oftener sad more fervently we should not grow half so weary. Nothing becomes George Fox more in his while character than his perfect self- possession. Sometimes it was outwardly winter with George Fox, and some- times it was summer, but it was all the same to him inwardly. I cannot detect him unbelieringly de- pressed, I cannot find him unduly exalted. If he is bound in prison he does not despise a poor girl who is there detained for execution, but draws up a peti- tion on her behalf, that her life may be spared, and when he visits Oliver Cromwell-let me say a right royal man, a true king-he is not at all abashed before the Protector, but speaks to him just as plainly as he speaks to the poor girl in the jail at Darby; he does not forget the little, or fear the great . When he writes to Friend Charles the Second-who, by the bye scarcely deserves so honourable a title-it is just in the selfsame bold but courteous style. There is not a grain of the fear of man about him. He is humble before God, but there is no affectation of humility in the presence of kings or princes. He never held men`s person`s in admiration because of advantage, but spoke to men as his fellow mortals, and as God s servant he was bold to tell them the Lord s mind concerning them. The death of our friend w as the noblest thing of all. Not far from this spot he finished his course. I have prayed many times-in fact it has grown to be almost a daily prayer with me-that I may be able to say when I finish my course what George Fox said, ' I am clear, I am clear ' Oh ' it will be a special mercy for you, my brethern, in the eldership here, you who speak in God s name, if you shall be found clear at the last. It would not be right, perhaps, to close this mere sketch of George Fox` s life without saying that 1 do not think that his career is at present under- stood by the outside world. Generally, when lacturing upon his life I go into details because they are not known by the outside world, and the man`s history is garbled. I would like to think every man honest, but I really cannot think that Macaulay was honest in what he wrote as he did about George Fox. I fear that he slandered him I am afraid he had a prejudice against Quakers In general, and against George Fox in particular; like Sydney Smith, who wanted to roast just one Quaker, onl) one just for the satisfaction of the thing The storj which Macaulaj tells of lox giving ai an nutlioritv for wearing his hat the fact that the three liol) children w ere cast into the furnace with their lints on is not according to the fact of the case but s a manifest perversion of the true stor) lnwhichFor. instead of being ridiculous, might even claim tok eimnentlv witt) lhe outside world supposes lint George Pox was a wild, mad, scurrilous fellow in I suit of leather who weht about making disturbance! in churches and abusing ministers, and, to say t e truth, the outside world cannot make out ho« it ia ihat vou sober, quiet people could have sprung froa linn lhej suppose that j ou are descended from him I v a pedigree of contradiction They cannot understand how he who "turned the world up side down' should have been the fouider of such » serious, orderly, peaceful boa) of people a« you ate to t-oberthat there are none so sober on the face of the tarlh Put if thej would reall) read the man s Me- ntid) ou mus' make them do that, font would dj ' them good-I think the) would say, " Well, though lhere are min) ecccntriiiiies, jet this is the bio I 0rnphj of a great man , Speaking of eccentricities the worst of them are ' ensil) understood when j ou know vour man, and see | lhe one idea winch burned within lum Tike for ia j stance his w alknig through Lieliüold crjng, ' Woe to the blood) city of Lichfield ' Now supposing a n an w ants to produce n certain effect on a certain | cit), if he selects the surest method of so doing is he | therefore unwise' It is quite certain that every J bod) at that time heard of what Fox had done but p if he bud merelj preached a bcrmon in Lichfield the | discount might hav e gon dow n w ith the geMial cur , rent of bib sennons, and w e should have heard no mote t about it His walking through the street was tallied ¡ of even where, and if he wished it should be, he certainly accomplished what he desired i It ministers now a da)s used justifiable meaos of ¡ making men hear their teatimon) the) might certainly ^ do woree Proptiel) is sometimes to be disregarded , when truth is to be manifested, and it is even belter to break through rules of decorum than to leave men £ at ease in their Bins 1 or mv part, though I do not j intend walking barefooted either through Licaneldor I onden, if I felt that good might be done thereb), or thought that the Lord bade me do it, I hope I MoM I hive trace to act out tonight upon my erranu , Lien bod) would laugh, but what would it mattet" ¡ conscience did but approve Now Foxs conscience j did oj prove, need I sa) more It was an age m which people were somewhat fanatical in reunçra I ox waa very much more sober than many of me religionists of the «cnod, and he bj no means endorsed all that was done even bv his o»n pro.«« follow erg We dare not la) at the door of our MMier, the Lord Jesus, all the things that lus followers mar happen to do and we cannot, therefore, «»Mg«T George Fox all the eccentricities and the «i'*««» which were to be seen in some of mm mediate followers 1 hough he was one m the best of men, he was but a man attw» lhere must be some flaw somewhere in mortuca« rnctcrs, but Pox carno ver) much nearer to pert«non thon most of his critics , and it is safo»») «* lox knew better what he ought to do than we vrw Ino two hundred j ears after lum -\\\ hen Mr John Weslej was asked how muchpi»e he had, he answered that he had one «.?«"P^11!' me lum and one at Pristol, and that was a 1, «m4« there were so manv poor people in the «T should not increase tho stock George ^-* f^i think, did not ev en come up to that, but he bel«»»» to ua n his last will and testament more *»«»» had given us the mines of Peru, for lie h»T*?

Ono thing moro which one admires m this great mans character is hit fearless reliance upon the force of truth He states a truth boldly, and does not bolster it up with human authorities as though he felt it to bo too weak to stand alone Ile knew that truth springs fully armed from the mind of God, and is able to light ita own battles Ho declared the truth not in gaudy periods draped with rhetorical embellishments, but he let it fall upon tho conscience in its simplicity, believing that it would wake an echo there which, if it did not bring the mon to salvation, would at any rate leave him without excuse "When he had truth committed to his trust ho did not cry, "I wish that this little stranger had been left at somebody else « door, 1 nardi) know how I shall bring it up, it is such a poor weak little thing ' Ile did hide it for three months, as the Hebrew mother did with her goodly child, or make for it a little anonvmous pamphlet, like an ark of bulrushes, into which he put it and left it to crocodiles or reviewers, but he owned tbc truth, and was not ashamed to defend its cause Truth was to lum a fire brand, which he hurled upon the stand- ing corn of the Philistines Ho knew that what God gave him to proclaim would win its own way 1 [am goin,, to conclude, but I desired to say to the rnends assembled here, and to all Pricnds m this kingdom, beloved brethren and sisters m Jesus Christ-for that I trust wo are-docs not the present agc greatly require you' It wants all Christians, bit docs it not specially need you' Ifjou are or wished to lie at all like George Pox, wa3 there ever a period since his day in which the existence of the 'luakcrs was moro necessary than now5 I think not, and this was why I wanted to have told jon some time ago that I thought you stood upon a special vantage ground in the fi(,ht wuti KiUiahsm this covert Popery which is coming back amongst us "\\\ hen an opponent con say to vou, " Physician, heal thyself, it weakens )our position Putin the matter of Hitualism an opponent cannot say this to von, un less, indeed, ns I have heard some wicked people sa), you ma) become as ritualistic in the -utter absence of form as others do with the excess of form I do not know whether that is true or not, but if eo, do not lot it be the case anj longer As far as I can judge however, I believe )ou to be clear of this sin A\ eil, then, are you not the verj persons constantly and vehcmentlj to speak against it5 Is there not need that you should speak against it r A\ hat greater evil can there bo than for the pon ers of

relation to political matters and to matters of social and pt liticul cconomj Some of you are getane fairius m antiquanunitni, and all sorts ol literary fame are open to you I hope, however, that this will never be jour chief glory I hope it will never be the chief ambition of this bo"iety to be chief aad foremost in politics and literature I hope j ou will never drivel into mere politicians, for it ia drivelling if )ou cense to make religion )Our main business, and I cquall) hope that )0U will not dtivtl into mere ?¡cholars or mere antiquarians or meteorologist", for it is a fearful coming down to come tobo any of these rather than to be first and foremost a servant of God I know my friend in the chair will say "Amen" to this, anil that he feels that to«crvcGod is the first and chief thing, and is the highest position of man- hood In addition to all this undoubted influence j ou have considerable wealth, you have a lorge amount of plant m the form of chapels-I beg pardon , I should have said " meeting-houses '-(that word " chapel " is a bad word , I wish we could get rid of it1)-j ou have a large body of highly disciplined Christian men , jour young men, I should think, are, on the whole, better educated than tho joung men of anj othf r class-and now, I ask jou, is all this power, and wealth, and position, and influence to be unused It is used, I know, in a thousand excellent wajs Are you not foremost as philanthropists 5 SVill not the negro always remember your names, and the freetl man alwajs recollect xou m his prayers 5 But I claim for Christ, I claim for truth, I claim for the Spirit of God, this power which He has given you Dear friends, j ou hav > among you honoured men who preach the gospel of Christ, and testify to the truth which thej thej have received, but should not more of you speak for Jesus s Will there not be more pub- lishers of the gospel if the Spirit of God shall visit j ou with a revival, and come upon j ou as he did upon those upon whom Joel prophesied, " And your sons and a our daughters »hall prophesy, jour old men shall dream drcamB, x our j oung men shall see visions It would be a great calamity for your society to cease to be until its great fundamental principle is accepted bj the whole Church lhere are borne of your prin- ciples to which j ou need not testify just now, because thej arc generally received, and your tesli mon) is acknowledged, but this principle of spiritua- lity of worship needs to be testified by us over and over again Luther said that when he preached the doctrine of justification bj f nth he felt as though ho could take the book and knock it against the people s heads to make them see it It were vam to do that, but tins doctrine of the spirituality of worship needs to be iterated and reiterated, to be dinned into people's ears continually , and then unless the Holy Ghost puts it into their hearts they will only hear it with their cars, but not receive it m their souls Friends, I pray you bear this testimony ' I do not know in whot woj jou can do it It is not for me to pre- scribo to j su, but I did feel it m my hean to say as much to you as I have said. In proclaiming the truth of a spiritual religion may God bless ou and multiply jou. and make you great upon the face of the earth "\\\ e will sympathise with you Wherein we think you err we will sorrow, wherein we think you right w e will rejoice
