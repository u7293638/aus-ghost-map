Branxton. [FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT] THE all absorbing topic of conversation here during the past weak was the cricket match which came of on Satur-<*> day last between the two well-known ''Tetnron'cricki'ters, Samnol Buckingham | pod. James Chalker, tho stakes being Â£1 aside. Tho rcsvlt of the contest, con- ] trnry to all expectations, was that Buckiughnm gained n decisive victory qver. his-younger opponent ; aud many a.iover of tho game iv our town left the ground with a sadder heart and lighter pocket through placing too much con fidence'ou Jim Chnlkor, who, I might mention, novor hnd the ghost of a show against his adversary, who played a splendid gqmo throughout, and> well' ?ipetiled r the ronndrf of applause which greeted him on Lis return from tho .vtickots.,., ;I often wonder what reason the selection committee of the locel crickot cl ib caa havo for passing him oVcTwlTen picking an cloven, for, con ? tbe manner in which he wioldod last Saturday, I am confident that, if given a fair chance, ho wonld compile 11 better scoro than somo of their best batsmen iiuve beon making lately. I roatnot forget to mention that Mr H. Fit,-. _Hi>rh;.rt JParrott bowled for tho winner, and Air W. H. Rudd for tbo loser.-. ?? A handicap quoit match will take placo here on.Bp-.ing Day, Air Georgo Collins being the promoter ; and as the prize is a very good one, nnd there being no other sport of any kind in tho vicinity, I frost thrt Mr Collins will be well re paid for bia generosity. Thunderstorms nro now tho order of tho day. For moro than a vreok past wo have scarcely missed n day without a thunderstorm passing over tho town. No loss than seven or eight treco have been struck in. tho vicinity, but for tunately no dnning-v has boon done. Branxton, Dec. '2-kth, 1888.
