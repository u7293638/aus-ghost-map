The scene in particular in which the ghosts of Richmond's victims — as we must now regard them — 'came to my tent, and every one did threat lo -morrow's vengeance on the head of diehard''- -now Richmond — will, perhaps, have to lie cut out altogether. Of course, the (wo names illicit be exchanged for each other I without iloinj; any violence to the metre; liut it would not he so easy to pi event the ghosts, in that case, frain prophesying victory lor me wronj* man. Historical whitewashing has lieon for a ?,'ood many years past a pretty familiar in dustry ; lmt we do not renieiulier any pre vious achievement which is quite, so remark alile as this. To ask where it is lo stop would, we suppose, he useless; and, .i mired, we do not know (hat in a good many cases we need care whether it stops at all. The ingenious writer who the other day published a definco of Jezebel in a since defunct periodical has probably not succeeded in making many converts to his view of that Queen's character. People will probably continue to use her name as a typical descrip tion of the female villian, just as if nothing had been done In rehabilitate her. Still, we could in any case have parted with thcitheoiy of Jezebel's wickedness, holding ns we do so Ktrong a card in the person of Ahab. There are cases, however, in which the good or evil character of a historical personage has definitely associated itself with the picturesque in history, and to redraw the figure or to repaint it in a lighter shade is to spoil the whole composition of the picture.
