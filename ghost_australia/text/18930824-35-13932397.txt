Everything at present goes to suggest that the demonstration made on behalf of the party a fortnight ago at the Protestant Hall was a mistake in strategy, and was the result of some of its leaders allowing themselves to be led into snareB from -vi Inch they had. of since seen the necessity of escaping If that is the case, the sooner they get a job and make their political position clear to the public the better for themselves and for the party which relies on them for guidance. The tone of the speeches on that unfortunate occasion, with their enthusiastic advocacy of taxation for some supposed benefits to be derived from it, was not the tone we are accustomed to hear on the part of freetraders The speeches contained nothing to show that the land tax which was advocated with such zeal had any definition whatever in the minds of the speakers The only definition before the meeting, as we have shown before, was that supplied by the manifesto of the Freetrade and Land Reform Electoral Committee, under the auspices of which the meeting was hold. We readily admit that the proposal contained in that document, to raise by means of a land tax of 4d in the in the sum of £3,211,903, "or more than the whole of the revenue obtained through, the Customs House last year," did not expressly hind the advocates of a land tax, who were speaking under the sponsorship of the committee. But it must be remembered that part of the business of the evening was the speaking to and passing a resolution affirming the desirability of forming branches to propa- gate the opinions of the Freetrade and Land Reform Electoral Committee throughout the country. This comes perilously near a committal of the leaders of the freetrade party present to an identification of themselves, and so far as it was possible of their party, to an acceptance of the principles of the committee in their entirety. Sir Henry Parkes, with the wariness of a veteran politician, detected the danger, and took care to guard himself with a few words of caution in which he professed that he " held the broad principle that no Government and no Parliament had any right whatever to levy taxation upon the people except to meet the necessities of Government." What the freetrade party in Parliament and in the electorates of the country is now entitled to know is, what in precise terms is the policy to be submitted on its behalf to the country A second question of not less importance is, who are the authors of this policy ? Are they the ostensible leaders of the party ? or are they the unknown members of an organisation, who, though they now call themselves by the ill-fitting name of " land reformers," not long ago presented themselves to the public under another designation ? Here we may ask, what has of late become of those zealous and enthusiastic propagandists, the " Single-taxers ?" "We have not heard much of them lately, at any rate under this appellation. But observers of the course of politics have marked that, while the *' single-taxers," so called, have disappeared from public life, another set of land taxers have sprung into existence and activity. These call themselves advocates of the " taxation of land values," but personally they seem to be closely identified with the energetic section whose disappearance has been noted. Their arguments are much the same, their purposes are much the same, they too desire to collect by means of a land tax what is now collected by means of Customs duties, and they also display that enthusiasm for taxation which is never exhibited save by those who wish to place the burden on some class other than their own. In other words, the single-tax propaganda has undergone reconstruction, and has now become one for imposing a tax on land values, which some of its advocates ingenuously admit may develop into the single-tax in time. All this is very well, and if it only concerned the tactics of a small political scot it would deserve little notice. But when by an unaccountable lapse of political sagacity some of the leaders of the freetrade party allowed themselves to be captured by this pushing section, and to be taught to publicly argue that freetrade and this land tax possessing these powers of expansion were but parts of one and the same cause, a situation is produced which requires the closest watchfulness and the gravest consideration. We feel it the more necessary to emphatically urge this point because we see signs tending to show that some freetraders are being driven by the recoil from a fantastic and unjust policy to lose their hold on the principle of direct taxation altogether. For ourselves, we have lost no opportunity of maintaining that a just and duly proportioned land ' tax is a proper part of any comprehensive scheme of taxation. The State can make no juster demand than that properly of all kinds, land included, shall pay its due share of the cost of its own protection and of general government. If the land-owning class were to object to pay this just share, we certainly should give no sympathy or support to that objection. But when the proposal is to introduce a system the logical and avowed object of which is to place the whole burden of taxation upon a single class of the community, we shall do our best to secure to that threatened class a fair hearing against being thus selected as a propitiatory sacrifice for the community at large. Meanwhile, there is for every practical politician work to be done before any question of additional taxation can arise. We have to reform the fiscal policy of the country so as to remove all needless impediments to trade, and we have to systematically reduce our general expenditure, which is still largely on the lines of the past days of' financial inflation. These are our first duties, and the danger is that, if the party is so conducted as to disagree and fall to pieces respecting its secondary and merely consequential tasks, it may never have the opportunity of dealing with those which stand first. Major-General Hutton has already signalised his regime by several alterations, in which, however the military men themselves might be concerned, the public did not greatly interest itself. His two more recent innovations are likely to be more canvassed, because they have called forth I the twofold opposition of self-interest and of sentiment. The costume of our forces on review order does not please the Commandant, and " as far, at any rate, as the infantry is concerned, the scarlet tunic is doomed." Furthermore, the helmet is to go, the " trousers " are to be abolished. For the bravery of scarlet, we are to have the utilitarian drab for the white helmet, the felt hat; and knickerbockers and puttees will be worn. Compuuotious- visitings Major General Hutton must needs have had, for he offers ingles and shoulder knots. Anglers are " attractive decorative coloured cords " of crimson and other lines, and they will depend, all being well, " from a very pretty shoulder knot the coloured cords and the knot combining to give to the brown coat a charm which is almost irresistible." For commissioned officers the agents and knots are to be supplemented by silver bullion. It really seems that the gorgeous array hero faintly set forth might have irresistibly charmed the military mind, but for the shrewd bargain which the Commandant would drive. Not only agletB and shoulder knots, we may suppose him to say, but also pantaloons and puttees. And undoubtedly the military mind hesitates at puttees. These are ton-feet lengths of black or blue-black woollen material, wound in a spiral around each leg from boot top to knee. Major-General Hutton believes that trousers are unsuit- able for heavy marching in our climate, that knickerbockers are more comfortable, and that leggings in wet weather are a - less. Very likely, but puttees are no joke ; they must be troublesome to put on, and if they are not intended on service to be taken off, they may be more inconvenient and dangerous to health even than the despised legging. Besides, any one who has seen the naval forces in service attire must has-been struck. with the apparent comfort and smartness of the wide trousers and leggings. Then there is the question of the scarlet tunic, This, as far as the infantry is concerned in review order, is doomed. In exchange, as has been said, the force gets a brown jacket, with a plea to protect the vertebrae, and aglets and shoulder knots, attractive and decora- rivers combination of the useful and the ornamental which should have secured the approval of the men, but does not seem to have had that good fortune. Some officers, when the change was announced, were much disturbed. Scarlet to them is an historic colour, a colour which permeates all the records of our achievements as a nation, a colour which has been fought for and is still worth fighting for. With the idea of offering an seventeen, the subtle suggestion is made to allow these gentlemen " the privilege of continuing to wear their scarlet tunics at levees and at social gatherings." Dismissing for the moment the historical and belligerent value of scarlet, we may turn to the representations of a correspondent, who asks that it may be considered before the change is decreed what a powerful influence for discipline and self-respect is the showy coat of British infantry. We may add to this suggestion the argument employed some time ago, when Englishmen were discussing the abandon- ment of scarlet as the army colour. It was said by men of experience that half the attractiveness of the service would dis- appear in the eyes of recruits if they had to wear khaki or hadden gray, instead of red cloth. No doubt the Commandant aims at economy, and is consulting the soldier's comfort as well as the Treasurer's vote, but a great courage is required by him who would alter the attire of men. The clothes-philosophy is deeper than any of us knows, and the most thorough- going of Eidioals becomes a Conservative when it is a question of the shape of his hat or his dress coat. Let us remember the forlorn hopes of drawing-rooms that have perished in the attempt to subvert the funeral garment of society, and Major General Hutton deserves sympathy. There remains the very practical matter of pay to the partially-paid forces. There are those who believe that the best force for this colony is a purely volunteer one, unpaid by the State, self-enrolled out of patriotism, and recompensed by the sense of duty and the admiration of less unselfish citizens. That is charm- ing as an ideal, only it cannot be realised ; it cannot be materialised, to borrow a term from occultism. It is found that, just as the masculine dignity ' has to be consulted in the matter of puttees and shoulder knots so the masculine patriotism has to be stimulated. Major-General Hutton is reducing the allowances to the partially-paid forces, and he hopes to be able to provide for an Easter encampment next year. That is the water and the sweet. Unquestionably the yearly encampment with its gaiety, its camaraderie, and its emoluments is popular among all ranks of the volunteer army, and the abandonment of this gathering recently has been much felt and much resented. But it has to be feared that reductions in the payment of the volunteers may affect the strength of the commands materially, and that the result will be to reduce the usefulness of the encampments. We have only to look at what has happened in the case of the partially-paid volunteer rifle corps to recognise that the subsidy which the State pays for efficiency among citizen soldiers is an important factor. It may not he true to say that the play's the thing wholly and solely, but it is the attraction to many and the necessity of some. Let us have economy, by all means, in the military expenditure as well as elsewhere ; but the apparent saving is sometimes the real loss. If the service is made burdensome instead of attractive, by lessening the emoluments of the efficients, the only result will be to drive such men as have hitherto filled the ranks out of them. This must not be lightly done, because once lost to the standards men are not easily regained or their places filled. It would be agreeable to possess a citizen army, disciplined and equipped to equal volunteers in other countries, who should cost the State little or nothing, an i serve out of patriotism alone. No doubt a crisis would marshal a patriotic force, but in times of peace men will arm and drill and serve only as may be convenient to them, or worth their while. In making changes which may powerfully affect the prestige of the military service, the authorities must consider more than precedents. Local circumstances and the local customs have to be studied, and to make haste slowly in a win- 'life. It is evident that in some districts there will be strong objections made against the results of the work of distribution as performed by the Electoral Commissioners. That was to be expected, and was we may suppose quite inevitable. The circumstance that in some cases what may seem to be an anomalous result has been produced by no means implies that the Commissioners have not done their best. As we have before recognised, the work was one of considerable difficulty. At the same time the Act provides an opportunity for the consideration of any objections that may be urged, and we may be sure that the Commissioners, who can have no other object than that of bringing out the best and most workable result will give their best attention to any object-. tions that may within the period prescribed by the Act be brought before them. It is satisfactory to observe that those who have tried to form a general estimate of the , manner in which the work as a whole has been performed have regarded it as done in a careful, satisfactory way. Better opportunity for criticism and judgment will be afforded when the numbers of electors in each district and their relation to the ruling quota are attached to the report of distribution. On this point it is well to know that the Commissioners have been enabled in all cases to keep within the prescribed margin of deviation, and of course the smaller the degree in which the quota is departed from, the greater should be the satisfaction and the better the result. In the mean- time all those who regard the boundaries iib capable of amendment should lose no time in bringing their objections under the notice of the Commissioners. The quarantining of vessels from cer- | tain ports of Europe, as proclaimed by his Excellency, is an excusable precaution againsttheintroductionofcholora, although, it cannot be said that the probabilities of ' such a misfortune visiting us are very great. The malady has certainly renewed its appearance in Europe, and in cases ' where the conditions are favourable, as in [Russia, its virulence seems little if anything abated. Such reappearance of pestilence after the interruption of a season is in the usual order of things, but it will probably be found that the lessons of last year will not be lost, and that in many cases more effective provision has been made for fighting the foe with the only weapons capable of driving it off- those of sanitation. In Bosses, where the deaths are said to reach a thousand a week, the belief in sanitary remedies is not so generally diffused as to have caused much change in the habits of the people or the cleansing of their towns But there is little doubt that in Western Europe science and the intelligence of the people have been working hand in hand, and that we are not likely to hear of such results of apple paredness as those which were so harrowing in last season's visita- tion Apparently the Mediterranean ports intended in the proclamation which has been issued are those in the direction of the Levant, where the conditions of social life are not much removed so far as cleanliness is concerned from those of Russia The sporadic cases alleged to have occurred in London and elsewhere are not of serious importance and we may with confidence expect that the sanitary reforms in which England has taken such a lead will preserve the mother country, as they last year enabled it to beat back the approach of the pestilence.
