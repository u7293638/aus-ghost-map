ORIGINAL POETRY. GOOD NIGIIT. Embrace me, Saviour, ere I sleep, Bestow the word of peace; Thy side, with glorious cleft so deep, Shall cause unrest to cease. Ah, view I Thee, in faith and hope, Flesh of our flesh—like ours thine heart, Clasp now my hand while thus I grope, Nor sleep, nor death avails to part. Where are the ghosts which serve Thy will— Spirits of weal, so light of wing 1 Send some who heavenly pathways fill, The wall of fire around me fling. Good night! I leave each sensuous thought, And darkness shuts the world away; Yet sometimes haB the Spirit brought To closed eyes a beauteous day. [The above lines, written by Mr. John Holt, of Port Darwin, reached us a few days before the electric wire brought the sad intelligence of his untimely death. They will be read with interest by his friends. —Ed.]
