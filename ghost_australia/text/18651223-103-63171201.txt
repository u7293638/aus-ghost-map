On thisi Mrs Kinder was arrested at Bathurst, where she had gone to l-eside, and on her were found cer tain letters fr'6m./Bertraud,whioh clearly established her crimihal 'connection with liinii bat which are so alsgus'tUig in.

In one' 'of- them, however, was this . remarkable'1 passage, 'referring' to the fact of Jack son's1 having been' sent' to gaol' for ' threatening him , MiThus*, tltiiu',' ?affdiri' perish:iny enemies.'

'(It may 'is remarked that the corresponding place in ;the'head is; where Kinder was shot.) He also di-' reoted the 'witness to purchase two red shirts, so that-lib marks of blood might bo soon. The witness about this time got frightened,' and declared .his -intention of having no more lo do with the affair, as it iwa's growing too tragic '-'f or 'him.

It turns out, however, that paison was administered, under Bartrand's diroc-' tions ; and it is supposed that Mrs Bortraud, aoting under coercion, gave it to the deceased. The body was exhumed, and -the stomach analysed;, but the evidence bu that point ha3 not been tiken.

The evidence, as taken, has not 'as yet boeu'publisbod, and the above is ouly a general 'abstract of its more salient points. The. affair is . .oreadug a great Bcnsatiou in Sydney, aa Borlraml wus well known, having resided for several years in the city. M'rs Bertrand is the daughter of a Mr Paliner.a taxidermist, in- Hunter-street, arid ip a pretty innocent-looking yPung woman. Mrs Kin der is a tall dark woman, of anj1 thing but prepos- . sessing appearance. The court has been crowded^ each day. _ .'' ????.-'?,' \: - -..-?'.-??. ??? -..'' - W'iKi v^V From the 8. M.Itcrald of the 7 th mst.ywe give the opening address for the prosecution and the evidence of one of the most important witnesses in the case :— . ,? . . : . Mr Butler, in opening the case for the ; Crown, refprrod to the nature of the evidence intended to be adduced, in order that their worships might un derstand the relation of its parts, and judge of their effect as the evidence was in course of hearing. Tho principal evidence as to Bertrand and his wife would be admissions made by them, taken in connec tion with other testimony ; and, as far aa Mrs Kinder was concerned, it would be for their worships to take into account the ciicuoastances tending to prove the probability of her being connected with the alleged crime. . If the other two prisoners 'were to be committed on these admissions, it would be a question for^ their worships to consider whether the ciroumstiinces did not also.- involve her \oornmital. Indeed; the state. af circumstances;-. bor should lay before the court would, JioVbelieved, 'rendei1 it mo rally impossible to commibithe'othei' prisoiieis with out 'committing Mrs Ivitfderi i /vTke Motive for: tho crime would be found -'iff thbV writings ? both of Ber trand and Mrs -Kinder ,^ns'. there 'would be suflibient' tq satisfy their worships Uliat 'even; daring the lifei time of tho husband; alleged to have beeii.inurdered, there was a personal iiitiinaoy.'and perhnps ^an illipit intercqarse between: B.ettranVi5and' Mrs ';Kinder*;'at all events, spch;ari,intiaiacyj;iis'.cauld not'eyst withi out furnishing/ a - cluetq^the impdtedpritnoHiQn the occasion when-: Biertranji;p:roaeoute3 i' ai-irian, named Jackson, for Beiiding hiin fa *-;t&rea.teniog; liitter^ what /he said .in referen^vt6fthit!shwed\ith;at;t,here,{ was the strangest possible iritimacyi;tand o!ri the;same bo--, ?casion Mrs BertrandyujiderlcrpssVexainiriatipnv bping asked if her huaband.',waa'; n'opijealdus;. df;lipr,'said; ??'Yes, but he never had-any'roc)3asioii;f'.-;^ *Jt .would be proved that he bed 6hly*tooiniuchViqccasionis;arid thac this was a falsehood* uponi'o^HiiiS-'XiiAifter -tlio death of Kinder, andiwhonJiMrs^i^'der liajjvgone to reside at Bnthurst, what' wds'ciilled'o/ jbur'n^l'pr a diary was kept by Bertrand,- it' Being anmiiderV standing hetweeu them that ho should jot {Town 'his thoughts, feelings, and the events of .'the day for her perusal when they should meet again. ? From entries in thio diary it would be ? clearly seen that it -was -his1 intention to procure a divorce from his present wife, and to marry Mrs Kinder ; the very first entry was in a most impassioned strain. He talked of her as his wife, and of ' ssveei)ing away, as with a scimitar, his enemies,' or those who should 'step between her love and him.' ' Think kindly of me— of niy great failings,' it proceeded—' see what I have done for tltee — for iny, for our love ; think of that, and doubt me if you cap.' In reference to the pro secntion of Jagl- sou,.and his committal to prison for sending a threatening letter, there was an entry to this effeot : — ' It pleased me — ^1 am satiBfied— thus: once more perish my enemies; Ho is dispoaed of for the present— are you sorry. ?. dame' hotn'o. The* first thing t[oao clid was to' tell- mo' tlia't affer all our quairel with' r'eglird to ypur lauRhing at Jackson, jlou) while I was in court; luusbed openly at him. Didyou do 'bo? — if bo, you will be his ruin, for I have not done with him yet. ' Why will yon enrage me? I called on Cooper; at the City Bank.' It might be necessary to explain that grounds would be found for imputing to Jackson an inliin^oy .with Mrs Kinder, and that Bertrand, having an affection for the woman, bec^ire'jealoua'of this' man on ac qdunt pf b\s ^ntecedent'relations with Mrs Kintlor whilst they were living'ihrNow Zealand, In an'other entry ho said, '_' I dih novy by nly own agoaies pay ing a dfebf to retributive justice ; how or what I bavo made others' suffer, fiod only' ^io^fs j but if I have I richly deserve all t feel, and you,1 my love, have yon not dpnp the s.an\o.'-.

Then he said, ?' Thinking of the time when we shall meet to part only iii'deatb ; when will that time arrive? It approaches slowly, but with sure steps ; bat it will come, believe me, as surely us jou believe there is a God — I havo said it.' He said furlher, ' what would life be without thee, or even the hope of possessing thee.' In another passage this occurred :— ' I look back at the past, and I. am almfflpst astonished at what I have dared and successfully executed. Can you, after that, sny you have riot faith in mo— that I am changed, anil that I could care for others' : beside thee^'M Thbn, -in rofereppa to lier ' 'futuro1'' conduot,'-' ho ? advised her to- be gooa, ^s ilwas not too. late to pray i to God 'with a-, true rnpentant heart,1 adding, !

Hertoprrespondenoa with Bertrand would be pro duopd.'.ilisclositig an attachment quite as ardent on her part as that entertained on his part towards her. This was ono of the aaain foots corroborative of the ndinissions that would be given in evidence. Part of Bertrand's evidence at' the inquest would be proved by this correspondence to bo utterly false. When asked if Kinder was jealous of ' his wife, Bertrand said, ' He was jealous of his wife with every person; he was a monomaniac on that point; she would answer when he abused her, but to ' my knowledge for the last six months I' am certain Mrs Kinder never gave da ceased' occasion for the kind rnnnner yihioYi he showed towards her.'

Tbe statement given of wli'at 6'ocurred 'when deceased was shot was that, when Bertrundj Mrs Bertram^ and Mrs Kinder' were present, Mr Kinder cn'me intpthei-oom, having been drinking, ond, having some-tinj.e bj3for,o been talking about hi3 affairs, got o^e|ted,' fired a pistoj at bis- head and fell &ov;/n. Tho curipiis' fact con nected with this was that neither Mrs Kinder nor Mia IjJertrand gave information to the police on the matter. It was stated that Kinder died of the injury he then inflicted on himse\f. ! But; subse quently Bertrand stated to hifj own sister,' who. had come up from MolboHrue (referred to. in the diary as the person for, whom,' ho bud; a'great affectiontand Who had a groat affectiop for him)., that tho mode of I^iniler'^ death was. not as mentioned in the riewspap.ers or at the inquest, \ thftV be (Bertrnjifl) had shot hini,,'an.d that us he. lingered, ana oppenrod likely ta' get somewhat bettss1, Mrs Ber trand ^nd; Mrs I^in^ev oonouifred in. poisoning him a^d thus put an cud t&hlB; life. Something similar to, this won.]d ba deposed to by a' young man .who had been in Bertrand's. employment, ; and whqso statement, if uncorroborated, would certainly bo most incredible. This assistant nwouid prove that Bortrnnd admitted snbatantially,; the ;same thingto him; that hoi (the assistant) wasfor weeks ? beforo privv, to a design to commit the'alleged mur der, and .to repeated attempts to murder Kinder ; that ho sent his assistant to buy pistols, 'Bertrand .accompanying him in woman's attire ; and it would, be proved that with one of these pistolSvKindox came by his death.

I said that I often thought my brother waB inad from 'th'u way in which he went on. I,. did not say that Defries Baid bo.(. I. have said to Mr:Dofries that ,1 thought my brother! must bo a luuutic, or he could riot hiivo done and said what, lib had. . When my brother mentioned the circumstances iirst he said thai, he had'shot him. ;My brother was ciilrn at the time ho ;s'aid 'bo.' He did not say thatKinder died-; he mei'ely''suid' that he had uhot hina. Mj brother might have used the word ',' dio ' in many convetaatioiiB, but he did not uso it in the first.' Ho often Btated that, people, .believed, that Kinder had died: by his own hand. .^In one conversation-. he (Bertrand) leunedover to me, and said that he did not die ,by the shot. Thnt conversation took place about three f or four. weeks ago. At the time that Bortraud stated that to me, I thougJjtthat.Mrs. Burtraud was asleep. She wnsin a kind of stupor, , SUeused to po oil' into those sleeps tkat'wouH last-some lionra. Ber trand asked mu not to mentiou tn. his wife that ;ho had said he had shot Kinder. J. rnontionod to his wife that he! had said tp me that, befoco I- left for Brisbane, which I was' then shortly about to do, I shoultTsee Mrs Bertrand's funeral. :, That was three weeks aftpr Mrs Bertraud had told mo that prisoner bad shot If inder.; tn one conversation,, ho told mu that deceased did not dio by the shot, but that ,' we poisoned him.' All that conversation took plaoe on the! same night, I did nofcVnueuk to Mrs .Bertraiid about it the game night, P.s.thp ,-. conversation took place at about holf- piist twelve o'clock, : nnd.. Mrs Bertraud -waa so drowsy- thut-I could not talk 'ta her. ,1 ennnot swear that it wag the next, morning that I spoke to.' Mrs Berti-an'd '. about what her hus band hud said. I ulivaya tplcj her' what-' Bertrand said. I wished to protect Mrs Bertrund. In fact, that was what I stayed in Hie house for ; and I must also say that I Btuypd pnrtly for fear of my life'. Whenever I tried to shelter Mrs . Bertrand in any way, hor .husband ulways Heeineilto hayo some! re., venge against me ; even if Mrs Bevtrund only took a fork up at the table, arid he told her not to do so,' it would give oilence ; and if I said anything in Mrs Bertiand'a favor ho would show: his spite ut me.'! Wo were always in dread of our lives. In fact, I ' had not a moment's peaoo in tho honso since I heard of the murder. My brother did ,uot appear' anxious to get me out of tho house, but quite tho contrary ; and when I wan tod to go he til ways hindered nie. Ho always professed to be very fond of mo, and said I was his favorite sister. Although he professed fondness for mo he did not show ifc by his manner.' He was often very eccen tric. Even in gaping ho would imitate the roar of a tiger,, and had done it in the street. Ho always professed. to havo an idea that he could mesmerise people. ;0n one occasion, when we were- spending iho evening at Mr Defries', Bertram!: acted in a ^Bry eooentric -mahuer'all Iho night. He put his iiugers up to hiS'Jipad to make- horns, and lie said he was tho devil. .He said lie1 could oull np Cinder's ghbBtin the room. Of course Idid not, expoot that, he could do such a thing, but thd horror of knowing, what I did affected me, and, I went into, hysterics. Bertrand voluutariiy and nntxpectedly,; maclo,- the statement .that deceased did- not die .by thoishqt,' but that ', we poisoned hiin.'... I believe Bortrand was a temperate man. From all that I have -ob- served; lib was, when .he suid;' 'i We poisoned him;' I did riot 'question'-' him1 about it.

She refused to do so. ; At another time; Mrs Bpr-: traiid told me that her husband wished her to go' and buy -stryohnine, and that sho refused to go.

Mrs Bertrand interfere in' her husband's business as to the poisons used, and as far as I am aware she had no knowledge of pbir sons. After I told her what my brother had said, I told hor that she ought to toll what ahe knew to a magiolrato; that if she did not confess, very likely the woman who ought tp 'bear it would espape, and ?

An attack was also made on the female' prisoner, Mrs Kinder; on her leaving the gaol, on the ; morning of* Friday,, by'a womtHnrin thfe cro'wdi'who tore off the veil which she a'lw'nys 'keeps oVer l}er'faoe^ Tho other -female' prisoner, iVJtfa Bortrana1, is'' the 'oi)jocii!'_pf mu'oli. cp'mmiaerictipn, hdying'crearly been acting' undoi' 'coercipri^ and in fear of ' tho 'brutal treatment ' to which ?'* slip' was often anbje'ofed- by :her' husband.' -She sfiys nothing, but appears tp fpel her situation acutely;- The cou dijcu of ' BeVtren'd is piarked ' by a singular pstenta tioiis ? atfciimpt tp appoar at easg.

'It ia;snid that, he is : very! unruly iu the gaol; and it is 'stixjposed that tlie defonoe will be chiefly on Iho ground of insanity, 'should the evidence for the prosecution be thought Buflicient tp substantiate the charge. Thera is as yet, however, nothing- to : show any insanity, except bo , far as the loathsome working's of'ii depraved sensual appetite end. a; vain-glorious desire for 'notoriety may be termed such ; aud if his singular behavior be, as- snraed'for the purpose of eventually putting in' that pleay 4,tj av; proaant, eppears likely to fail in 'its effoct.

Tho evidence of Jackson (who it will be romcuiberod wap'seiitonced to twelve' monthsVimprisoumt'nt for writing a threatening letter to Bertrand), related to a criminal intimacy which had existed botwei;n.!bim 8elf and Mrs Kinder in New. Zealand, and also11 the intimacy between her 'hnd Bortrand, on the North Shore.- On Friday, the, evidence of Sophiu, Taylor, linrHe-girl in the employ of Bertrund ; ' of Thomas Buchanan, accountant in tho Bank of Australasia ; :pf, William F. J-ind,- the proprietor : of -the. North Shore Hotel ; of- police constable Emerton, and of Dr.' Kichler, vyere taken. 'It was, however, obiefly corroliorative evidence ; that of 'Mr Dind sho.wiug that -Kinder was sober on- the day of the supposed murder,- and .that Bortrand :!was at Kindur's honep, and appeared unwilling that anyone. should see Him (Kinder) ; also Btating-that .the , reason that he hud committed .suicide was ,from. .pecuniary embarrass ments, referring pnrticulxrly to a mortgage, on some prjperty in New Zealand. Dr. Eiuhler deposed to iniving examined tho wound; in 'Kiudor's. temples, upd. stated his beliof that it- had been caused by a pistol shot, although whether there had been u bullet hi the piatol at the timo of firing he- was un able to judge, as the wound might havo been caused by a hard wadding. He expressed his opinion, judnirig from the direction of the wound, that JCincler had shot himself, but would Jiot say that the shot might .not ,havp ,beon fired by another person, ^e had examined the stomach of the deceased after exhupaticn, but thought : that a; chemist would be ' etter, able than himself to give evidence as (,o traces, of, poisou being found, in it. Heha^not been.ablo to find. any, butT believed that b.elladQnna might have been used ; and as that wag a ? vegetable poison, it-would leave no trace. . (A bottle of bella donna, partly emptied, was found- in (,Bor.trand's surgery -at the time of the arrest.) V.Cpnatablij Emorton deposed tliat lie' had, seen the deceased en the'night when hpwas 8hot,'and , fhat Bertron^ had told' him that the, dpotpr'a orders wore ^hat nq one should .talk, tp him. Deceased, however, said to him (witness) that he had not shot himself, us had been; stated. ... Ho (witness) did not' talk to him much, as, he thought it, was 'ngainst' the doctor's orders, and was under the impresaion that Kinder waa rambling in his- talk. ? On Saturday' Mr1 G. Watt,- analytical ohemist, deposed that he had ex amined the stomach of Kinder, but had not .detected poison. He stated, . however, . that , it was not pro bable that 'a 'vegetable poiaon , suoh 'as aconite or belladonna (both of which had ? been - found iu the .prisoner's -?,.; possession) would leave any ..traces :; .tvvo ? .mouths -after death, -..'.or even the next day, if administered, in small quan tities. :Drs.AlIowdy and Alleyne had examined the body. of: deceased, undiind, found a- wound' on tho right side of tho head which could not have been caused by tho firing 6f-a pistol,' unless it were loaded with' a bullet. or; Borne other substance much-harder than a wad, as apiece had. been cleanly broken off the cheek bone, and that that was one of the hardest bones iu the head. The pistol, must have been fired from behind forwards an J from below upwards (thus agreeing .with tho'statoment already 'made that Kinder was reading a card when the 8hot was fired). Dr. Steel deposed that' ho had frequently sold poi sona to the male prisoner. This closed the case for the Crown, the defence being reserved. , The three prisoners were committed to take their -trial for wilful murder at the next 'ensuing ?; assizes, and were remo%rc.d to Darlinghurst Gciol.- : An applica tion w«s made ! for. , baij, whiobi was, hovvevei', re» fuse^. .-:.-.
