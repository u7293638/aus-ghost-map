to have their names placed upon the official ml must furnish full particulars to the satisfaction of the members The) must give assurance of the formation, and that the strip has been issued and is available for transfer and under take to shipped) to the Secretary of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne from time to time (vi without his api 1) line. for some j prompt notification of all calls and clouds alteration of capital or other material information regarding, the company while on the other is list The committee shall have power to remove a) company) from the list if they see cause to do so The application must remain upon the I Exchange notice board for two day s after which members vi will decide by a majority of those present whether the company shall or shall not be admitted to the list The face pal able upon application of the company shall be fixed from time to time by the members the present fees bellin £10 103 for an estates companies and are 5s for mining companies Companies were frequently floated with little or no more to their credit 'The act provided that 6 per cent of the subscribed capital must be paid up, but it often happened that after the promoters had been paid their or 5 per cent, barely sufficient money was left to carry on the company for more than a month or two, or to pay managers or directors' fees The way in which the Stock Exchange read the act was that 6 percent of the subscribed capital must be paid up and placed to the credit of the company, and it was their intention to make the companies comply with that reading of else to refuse to place them upon the official list Mr R! Wallen thought that the deputation were not in a position to offer an opinion at present. Mr. Otrrrmif -I just w but you to say if you are inclined to act with mc Mr Wallen was sure that the committee of the Stock Exchange had done their best to keep mining pure He doubted, however, whether it was possible to make men per feetly honest Mr Oun'itivr said that his remarks had borne no reference to members of the Stock Exchange Mr Mullen-fl eli, persons who deal with the Stock Exchange there was no business in the we oriel in connection with which turns actions weieciirnod out in such an honourable fashion An) failure to can) out a bargain was rigorously punished in fact a man d seed not do it All then trans motions were carried out a most essential) honest way. It had been suggested that brokers should be licensed, thus drawing a distinction between the two CIIISHCS of business The Stock J exchange included both, because it was always found that some men devoted themselves more to dealing, while others went in for broking No man could possibly provide more stringent penalties for dislionestdeuhng Withoutwishin^tomcntion names, he would point out that quite recently) the committee of the Stock Exchange cou ordered a case in which they found that their rules had been v isolated, and on which the person offending had been removed from the list of members without needing any compensation for the loss of his seat which was worth from £1.500 to £2,000 It must be remembered that there was always the danger of over legislation Mining at the present juncture was not in an over pros serious condition, and if it were to be additionally hampered by legislation there was a certain amount of risk As to the question of the amount of capital to be paid up, counsel's opinion had been taken and it was ruled that the amount need not necessarily) be subscribed in cash He could not say per sonally that 5 per cent. was the proper amount, but that seemed to have been the intention of Parliament 'The stipulation had been ridden over and got over in some way, and what was needed was that the whole 6 per cent of the money should be paid up Mr Gavin G Brown thought that the Minister was on the right track and that more legislation was needed on this subject So man) companies had been floated recently that it was accessary) to look more carefully into the whole matter, and insist that 0 per exit in cash must be subscribed d 'I he Stock Exchange had taken counsel's opinion on the subject, and had been told that it was unnecessary to have one single shilling It seemed a monstrous di resign, but thad been confirmed Of course there was a great difficulty in making an act of Parliament elastic enough to carry out all wishes, but the committee of the Stock Exchange were desirous of supporting the measure that would keep milling pine He did not think the committee of the Stock Exchange could frame a rule elastic enough to catch eyes) thin,. Hcccituinl) approved of the state of tendering it punishable to make false declarations up to a certain point He thought, how out, that there would be a difficulty in da lining, the stud t point since the prospect list s were usually) come ned in Itinerate so delightfully vague that it was almost impossible to catch the utilities He thought legislation light fairly be extended in tlintdueelion It could scarcely be hoped to meet the whole question nil it could see impish was to under the Dunn who deliberately falsified a Btuiinitnt and and in it for the picnic He feared that the Stock Exchange could not assist in assuring that 5 per cent of the subscribed capital should be the working capital, and that it should not be paid away) It continued, happened that the legal sum was paid into the bank, must taken out immediately the company had been registered, and paid away to people who had never done anything to entitle them to it. The opinion obtained by the Stock Exchange had been get on so recently as December 22, and if anything were to be done it must be done very quick]) indeed It appeared to him that what was wanted was a scheme in giving a record of what had actually been done, which could be referred to at any time Mr G S Griffiths said that during the last few months the committee had refused to admit several companies to the Stock Exchange on the ground that they were not satisfied that the 5 per cent. had been placed to the credit of the company in a bona-fide manner Mr Walker pointed out that the committee of the Stock Exchange had not been altogether idle During the last few months they had refused to admit any mining coin comes unless registered under the No Liability Act It frequently happened that men who had parted with their interest and ought to be held fice, had found themselves liable for calls Mr OimiUM, in thanking the members for their attendance, said that it was plainly apparent to him that legislation was necessary, but of course he w ushered) prepared to indicate its exact tendency at the present juncture He would do his best with the assistance of the deputation, and would wait and see what the session would bring forward It must be remembered that the public to a very great extent based on the Stock Exchange, and that the fact of stock being quoted by the Exchange carried with it a cer- tain guarantee of its bona fides he felt that in dealing with the Stock Exchange he was dealing with an honourable boil), and he was desirous of fleeing them from a most objectionable class of men He hoped that the act would be in the hands of the draftsmen in about a months time the deputation then withdrew.
