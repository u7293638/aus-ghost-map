THEATRE ROYAL. "HAMLET." If the ability to play the part of the Prince of Denmark were as common in the theatrical profession as is the ambition to make a figure in it, excellent Hamlets would be as plenty as blackberries Unfortunately, however, they are as scarce as pineapples in Lap land, and Mr Leake's impersonation of the melancholy Dane is as unlike the character pourtrayed in the tragedy as Hamlet himself IS unlike Hercules It is the old fashioned melodramatic view of the part which this gentleman presents to na- a part to tear a cat in, to make all split a part for which a good pair of lungs and a sonorous and flexible voice are the main qualifications "These Mr Leake possesses, and he makes an effective use of them. He runs up and down the gamut of his powerful organ like one secure of every tone in it, and bent upon bringing it out His transitions from fortissimo to piano are as rapid and startling as to variations in the velocity or deliberation of his utterance Sometimes he dwells upon an open vowel like a singer holding a favourite note, and sometimes he runs his words into one another with all the vocal agility which the late Charles Mathews was accustomed to exhibit when playing one of his patter parts When Mr Leake wishes to be impressive his delivery is that of Boanerges and when Hamlet is supposed to be oppressed with sorrow, or weighed down by a sense of the onerous duty laid upon him by the ghost, he drops into a lachrymose style of utterance better calculated to provoke a smile than to excite the sympathies of the audience But throughout he is perfectly consistent in completely disregarding the advice which Hamlet offers to the players, and he never once deviated out of the conven- turned into the natural. There is not a trace of real feeling in his acting All is premeditated, and unemotional here a start, and there a pause-now a noisy outburst, and then a sudden subsidence into a stage whisper. When he declaims he rants, and when he wishes to make a strong point he does so by sheer physical vehemence But on all such occasions Mr Leake carries the pit and gallery with him and if he makes the judicious grieve he has the satisfaction of feeling that he secures the plaudits of a considerable section of the barren spectators In all probability he has been in the habit of earning their suffrages by the same methods in other countries, and this has confirmed him in his determination to present Hamlet as it was presented last night at the Theatre Royal, upon the boards of which so many excellent delineations of the character have been witnessed in bygone years that each person who saw Mr Leake in his suit of sables and who remembered his predecessors on the same stage or rather upon that which was burnt must have been tempted to echo the words of Ophelia, and exclaim to woe is me ' To have seen what I have seen see what I Boo 1 " Hamlet is announced for repetition to-night and tomorrow On Saturday "The Three Guardsmen ' will be produced.
