Instructions in the Art of special pleading- Messrs. John ;Doe and Richard Eoe-Conclusion of the first Book. Thus in my saddle I was seated. Ere scarce one Lustrum was completed. But when my Mental Powers I weig'd, My figure and my mien survey'd,' .m ' i . i A bold Causidiual appearance,! Strong nerves, strong parts, ^nd perse verance, - . Far nobler views inspir'd my mind, It seem'd that nature had combin'd " An eye to threaten and command," And brows no mortal could withstand,' With lungs of iEolus andStentor, y For BOme great purpose peradventurp. *.? . There is, I cried, (and dropp'd my Pen,) " A tide in tho affairs of men," i Which leads to fame and fortune those, 'Who take it while the current flows : There is, ye Gods, there is a Crisis ! ?. I'll seize it, whatsoe'er the price is : v * Prozer was dead, and Sergeant Q.uirkit Grew husky, and had left the Circuit, And as for Shark's friend Shovolnose, We long had deem'd him meat for crows : . I scorn'd in this dull scene to tarry, ' Essay'd at once a loftier Quarry, /At once indulg'd my fav'rite bias, v And stamp'd my fame as Nisi Prius : So now I take my brace of nags, ' /My Note-book, Clerk, and Saddle-bags, ? And saunt'ring gently on my Journey, Look out for'some good rich Attorney;: Onethat'saJudgeof parts^and me'-It*" i- Such as that choice discerning spirit, . ..^My worthy little friend Joe Ferret, c'tThpfc honest, free, good-natured Soul, Who stands sa hightupon theRoll, .WSr { i , " i j ? | And nils with such eclat and grace, That pretty comfortable place, ffe,gain'd,by Government Connexions, . And prudent conduct at Elections, By making Ministerial bounty Pass for his own throughout the County . A friend to all who are oppres&'d, And feok by Law to be redress'd, .' One that abhors all compositions, All mean Refcraxits, and submission*, . Scorns Arbitrations as a stain ? To ninoth and tenth of William's Reign, . Acts, which he deems mislead his Clients: ,'J Cramp Genius; and degrade his Science ; ? But when the sparks of discord rise, Should Parties wish to compromise, 'My little friend provokes the flame, ' Encourages and spreads the same, . v And with such zeal and judgment blows 1 Thecoals of strife 'twixt friends and foes, He ne'er can fail at'size oc session, Of growing warm by his Profession; iHis Garden's neat, the Messuage: good, The best in all the neighbourhood, "With door Chinese the front is grac'd, His wiudows are of Gothic taste, The which, to me, though all the Village . , Conceive they're got by fraud and pillage, And both th' Exciseman and the Hector Despise his taste in architecture, To me, -whose taste is lesstefin'd, And more to social joys inclin'd, If chance my penetrating eye His glitt'ring neat buffet descry, A goodly symptom ! and behold His well-scour'd knocker shine like Gold Look all so pretty and inviting, I make no scruple of alighting. At said Attorney's fix my quarters, Flatter and flirt with all his daughters, With Kitty Ferret dance Cotillions While you, ye worthy rum Civilians, Ye sober persevering Stagers, - Hammer your minors and your majors, i And lapt in smoke, and vapours dank, i Pore over Linivood and Lanfranc. r . But soft awhile, methinks, dear Job, i Oar Brethren of tbe Scarlet Robo, Lull'd by the music of my numbers, Seem to resume their wonted Slumbers; ? Good Mercury, with caution tread, . And Morpheus wave thy Waud of Lead; i While they enjoy their meditations, [ We 'scape their Excommunications. I Meanwhile do tliou. the Tale declare, | Meet weapons of offence prepare, ' Open your budget of Resources, Muster your powers, collect your forces, The Truth, and all the Trutb, discover; And add such flourishes moreover, I Such aggravation, and additions, Embellishments, and repetitions, > As Touthful Fancy oft begets j On some young Special Pleader's wits, Which, servo like notes of Commentators, Or speeches of confus'd Debaters, To puzzle e'en by Explanation, And darken by Elucidation, For puzzling oft becomes your duty, And makes Obscurity a beauty; And trust me,'tis of wond'rous use By Nonsense to improve Abuse, As I, thank Heaven, so oft have done. And worthily my race have run. Then let us pray for writ of Pone, John Doe and Richard Hoe bis Crony, Good men and true, who never fail The needy and distress'd to bail, Direct unseen the dire dispute, And pledge their names in ev'ry suit Sure 'tis not all a vain delusion, Romance, and fable Rosicrushn, That Spirits do exist without, Haunt us, and watch our whereabout; Witness, ye visionary pair, Ye floating forms that, light as air, Dwell in some Special Pleader's brain j Am I dcceiv'd; or are ye twain.
