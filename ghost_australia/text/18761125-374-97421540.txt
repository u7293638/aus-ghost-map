BRISEIS, THE DERBY AND CUP WINNER. {From the Australasian.) The glorious uncertainty of racing was never more fully realised than by the result of the contest for the blue ribbon of thu turf, in which Mr. Wilson's grand filly Briseis was the winner. A more sensational Derby few probably of our readers will live, to witness. We need not refer now to the career of Newuiinster, as with the exceptions of the bookmakers. Suffice it to say that, although backed at the start at 5 to 4 against the field, the colt never liad the ghost of a chance in thp. race, and must either have, been greatly overrated, or9 whatis more probable, is not within a stone of his real form. But tlie result of the race proves as we remarked,-the glorious uncertainty of racing, for it is no;secret, we bielieye, that Mr. Wilson only decided at the bust moment, and that for a valuable considera tiori, to .'start' his'filly, and*1 she •not only- woik easily ,bu£ witliin a fraction of a second equals the, best' tim^ ih" "a race for the blue ribobiL Blair Atliol and Kettledrum won their respective Diivbys on Epsom Downs each in 2in.' 43s.^ whilst 35ifiseis . was only, a quarter of a. second | longer;^.Aiid considering, &at; .Briseis's time was on, a. dead level .course, whilst the course at Essoin is an unclulating one,- it is open to question-whether; the performance pf:th.e colonial tiUy ,is not the best of the three.

But what strikes us inorc particularly irt connexion with this Derby- is the' fact- that Mr. Wilson should ever have had any doubt about starting his filly. Can we-suppose S(* clever: a iraiiier as Mr. Wilson to have been frightened- at' tlie' great,. biigl7eM:.Wewminsti;ri-' 'and ready to forego the cliance of "winning a. valuable stake like,the Derby without,ah effort?
