NEWCASTLE ELECTRlC LIGHT HANDICAP. W. W. Morris wins. The first Newcastle Electric Light Sheffield Handicap was brought to a conclusion on Saturday night. There was an enormous attendance, in fact the largest seen on the Newcastle Cricket Ground. The weather was fine, and the tracks were in splendid order. The lights worked as well as on previous nights, and the sport provided was very good. The committee were only called upon in one instance to investigate "stiff" running, when Stettler was disqualified for twelve months. As we pointed out some time ago, the back men did not have the ghost of a show of getting into the final. The only man who did so, with a short start, being F. Martineer, and, had Stettler tried, the former would not have occupied a posi tion. W.W. Morris won every heat with yards to spare, and he made no mistake in the final, for, as soon as the pistol was fired, he went away, and, running as straight as an arrow, won easily by about four yards. The following are the results : SECOND RounD. First heat: F. Martineer, 138.}yds, 1. 0, Crothers 14., and T. K. Bond 18, also ran. Won easily. Time, 123.10see. Second heat: W. W.
