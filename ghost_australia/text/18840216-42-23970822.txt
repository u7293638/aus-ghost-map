A Contractor's Experience of White Labour in the North. MR. GEORGE BASHFORD writes as follows to the Townsville Herald of the 2nd instant:— Dear Sir, - I last addressed the public through the columns of your valued journal. ut tlie cuirmenci'iurut of List December, aitu at that tiw<l <>ye you my imprrsaion w to th* nut no uiul »i>j>curuncv of tho country around Mourilyau Ifarixiur aii«l tv» district throa^h which the Mourilyan Sugar Company's tram way from the plantation to tbo harbour passes, and I abo tlien declared myself as betas titrofiKly opposed to the caijiloyiueut of Chinese, k&nakaa;, or any <jthrr class of coloured labour, cither 011 tlic angar plantations, traniws* works or in any place where the adoption of it ooold W potitibly arohied. Sinoc writing the lrtteiN referred to, I have jnad» another vuit to thia locality, arritlnc hrrc on the lUh January, Mid tho resutta of my making a longer ntuy here, in tho bei|{tai of a tropical ttuuirucr, hnve owned nic to form now ideas regarding vcveral mattent, but more especially uj>on tho question of the re ipectivr vuluv of white mud coloured labour, ami having, as altove stated, not only in rcerat il<*ction speeches, but »»t other tiniw declared myiu-lf to be a ntrong " anti-chinkie " man, 1 consider it to be my doty to «\y yo« «rv reason* for tlic change of my opinion*, mm truat that they may not be considered out of place. My ejcprrienoM during the excooive heat of the past fortnight have provwd to ■*.• that the avemgti white man cannot do the work required of him in railway undertaking, in a, country and climate aiiuibur to thia, and in proof of my a»st'ruon I p\v you bwrwith a ■nail memorandum of the number of whitr men en^^cd uiton tin* construction of thi» tramway, who, durinz the urrk endinjr Satur day, li»th January, daily turned ont in a norn tag, intending to do a fainUy's work. >Vom which it will *c wcou ttiat the proportion off tiicm who knocked off during tho weok mentioned, in workiß^ hours, tr o ui die heat of the sun, midden or continne«l attacks of (over and ague, or by other causes compelled to return to camp, amount* t« 210 out of a total of 4*J7, equal to n loan of .V) pur cent in abour \- -a ver>- aeriou* one in time ami money to th« contracton, and which ahw tolln Kreatlj against the boaricd stamina of the white labourvrs In any cliuiote :— The work of forming the Mourilyaa Com pany's tramway from the harbour to the plan* of but Jaly, and up to tbc prwnt tine—* period of six montlw—mm 800 to MO white men h»ve come and gone, after staying hero but very short periods, in consequence of the heat and unbealthiucas of the place, and oat of the original eighty who came up lint with the contractor* from Brisbane, only tiro now re main here, and theae have all an or lesa suffered from fever during the time. There* fore, considering that there ha* been a hum amount of work to be dose in proportion to the ahort length of the line, ft will be awn that the contractor* (Mean. Boat and Alderton) have had to raScr heavy loan, and a ssest aartoos dttfcolty to contend with, in this Last December U wm found absolutely nrcrsssry to introduce Chinese in order to complete the line within contract tinw, and accordingly fifty Celestials were engupd. Since then the number has been largely Id creased, there being now on the line tew 180 tattoo, trren miles, was comneneed at the end of these gentry at work in the cuttings aad on the embankments. Bat they also are subject to the " ills which mortal flcsb is heir to," and not infrequently drop out of the ranks of their mates in one* and twos, and retire homewards "welly rick," but nothing to the extant that white men learo work. • There Ik no doubt whatever thai Chinese can stand the climate in these scrub countries a very lon*,' way better than even seasoned colonials. But as regards their working capa bilities they cannot hold a candle for a moment to the white man in good health, tho latter being able to «1» at least three times a» much as the former; but against tliia must be placed to the credit of the Chinaman the fact that, although ho may only got through a company trroly tittle work during the day, yet he sticks to it throughont. He hay one steady pace and a set stroke or morenicnt for doing hu work, all daylong, and if h<»it» duturlrad in those ho " takes a spell," and stands still, apparently never to go again until tho granger rerainds him of his duties, but although not such a consummate loafer as the kanaka, the CMnkie teuulres eon* sfamtly looking after.
