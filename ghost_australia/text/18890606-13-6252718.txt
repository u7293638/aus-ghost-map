FARMERS AND PROTECTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir, Ever since my first unfortunate letter on this subject in your columns I have been in continual receipt of pamphlets, newspapers, and letters from places both near home and as far distant as Sydney, Bathurst, and Rockhampton, some quoting me favourably, Borne abusing me, but all apparently astonished firstly, that a farmer should be a freetrader, and, secondly, that he should know why he is so The last reference to me is in the clever "Random Papers, by "Quivia," on an "Unlaid Ghost, ' where I am coupled with the well known "bottlemaker' in support of Mr. Jowett's argument in favour of free trade at the recent debate on the subject held by the Australian Church Literary Society. In the report of Mr. T Trenwith h address on that occasion I find that he also did me the honour of reference in the following words : The farmer who had been last referred to had, no doubt, made his calculations on a false basis. He had started with the assump- tion that his implements were taxed 25 per cent, on a certain cost, and that it they had not been taxed they would have cost him 21, percent less. That was an erroneous impression. The fact was that protection in Victoria had not only enabled the people to manufacture a great deal of what wRs used, giving the consumer is better article at a lower price, but it had reduced the price of the imported articles upon which duty is paid " Now, upon this I join issue with Mr. Trenwith, so far as the farmers' industry is concerned I don't pro loss to know very much about other industries, but with respect to one upon which Mr Trenwith is most certainly a better authority than I am, I may say that I had yet that it I want a good pair of boots I have to pay us much for them as I over did, though I do not deny that a bad pair can be got below the old price And I find also that the same rule applies to everything that I buy If I want a good article I must pay a higher price relatively than for a bad one of the same kind Of course, I don't object to the higher price in itself, but when I know it is proportionately much higher then I think that I have a right to complain Illustrations, however, are better than arguments, and I don't know that they fire any worse for being old ones and so I may take first that most useful farmers' machine, n chaffcutter worked by horse power 1 beat are still imported, and the price of a No 1 when 1 last inquired was £24 duty paid, or £19 in bond , the price; of a colonial machine of the same size berne also £24 It is no use telling me that the colonial article is better than the imported, because I have them both and there is really no difference between a good relish machine and a good colonial one Now, it is an erroneous impression that in consequence of the duty I paid £5 more than its real value for any English machine and can I not justified in assuming that I have also paid £5 too much for my colonial one I met patriotic enough to buy a Victorian article in pre- threat, to any other, and I would not even object to pay a little extra for it, but my patriotism does not extend to 25 percent,, and I really doubt if Mr Trenwith or the machine, maker would pay me any more for the chaff I cut with the colonial machine than for that cut with the imported one Before the duty on i reapers and binders was abolished 1 paid 810 for a M'Cormick machine Immediately after the removal of the duty the price dropped to £75, and afterwards to £70 Well, my impression is that I was robbed by the Government of £20, and I assume" that my machine was taxed 25 per cent on its value, and that I paid the tax If duties do not raise prices, why were the farmers so much exercised about the duty on bags and binding twine? I know that the price of bags rose after the removal of the duty, but that was due to the as in the price of jute in India, and when the manufacture returned to its normal condition the price of the article fell to its pre \ tous price, less the duty. The duty on cord age is 11s 3d per cwt,, and on white hues and other descriptions of cordage not otherwise specified (except coir yarn) 28s. per cwt." The duty on twine (except sew ing or seaming of hemp, cotton, or flax) is 2d per lb There has, I been o, been an immense amount of wisdom brought to bear on the question " What is coir jam? ' with a view to a decision as to whether it could be classed as twine. It is this yarn that is chiefly used for binding sheaves, and it formerly paid the twine duty, but is now exempt the price to the farmer being reduced by the exact amount of the duty In my early days I served my apprenticeship as a sailor, and I am quite sure that if I had then called "yarn" "twine," I should have had the bo'sun after me with a rope's end. But Commissioners of Customs are not necessarily sailors any more than First Lords of the Admiralty are Galvanised wire netting paid 25 per cent duty until in 1930. it was exempted from taxation. The price when under duty was about £2 per mile I bought a few weeks ago at £18, and my " impression is that if the duty were still levied the price would be as of old I remember that a strong effort was made to have this tax retained, because some- body was going to start a manufacture of netting, and during that time we had to pay the good Government, that is so anxious to assist agriculture, about £5 a mile for leave to fence our crops from the rabbits, which ran freely over the Crown lands Quite recently I wanted a boiler The price asked for an English one was £200, and £50 added to duty I bought one from the Phoenix; Foundry Company, at Ballarat, and a. capital boiler it is, but that does not prevent me from knowing that I paid something like £50 more than its true market value. Mr T Trenwith will probably point to the splendid works at Ballarat, which could not exist without this duty. Possibly so, but that does not add one penny to the price I get for my wheat, and as, judging by recent events, the Ballarat foundry-men can afford to knock off boiler making and play at another sort of striking, I can't help thinking that part of my £50 has been spent in strike pay very much against my will When the ] Exhibition was open, a friend of mine thought that he would like an American buggy, and we inspected some which were shown by a Sydney him the price of one chosen was £20 if delivered in Melbourne, or £15 it delivered at Albury, where I should have to pay £20 duty on bringing it across the bridge into Victoria Mr Trenwith, in his speech at the Australian Church. said that he was told that axles are cheaper since the duty was imposed, though ' it varied from 3s to 209 an arm ' a a member of Parliament Mr. Trenwith should " verify his quotations' about duties Had he done so in this instance he would have discovered that the duty on axles is to, 4s 6d , 7s and 10s per arm, according to description and small sales are ccrtmnlydcirer by the exact amount of the duty in the rest I cannot speak ; but in an article can be bought at one price in bond, and only at that price with the duty added out of bond, I can t help having the impression that it is just that much dearer than if it were admitted free Turning for a moment from import to export duties, I saw the other day that Mr. 1 Trenwith was very anxious to add to the solitary scrap iron tax an export duty on sheep skins, which, on pelts, would vary from 25 to 50 per cent in the value taking that to be the price quoted in Jim -imposes the same date Know, there is nothing surer than that the duty thus lov led would come out of the pocket of the farmer who fattened and sold the sheep When the 1 Farmers Protection Association asked the Trades hall to assist them in obtaining an export bonus on wheat, Mr Trenwith as spokesman, met them-quite right) with a point blank refusal But where does the difference come in, except, indeed, that the fellmongering industry is a very small metropolitan one, and the farmers' industry is the largest and most important in the colony ' Shall I be If the story over again of my small roller mill plant, which cost £200 more in Melbourne than it would have cost me either seduce) or Adelaide Helier, perhaps, that Mr. Trenwith should visit the Yarra Roller Mills, and leave there the enormous penalty inflicted on the spirited proprietor for daring to erect, probably, the finest flour mills in this hemisphere That is encouraging native industry with a very gence ' I need not say any thing either about cast iron pipes the slot) is too old ; but I may) mention portable engines, now so much used in irrigation, or pumps and pump fittings, horseworks and horserake, will, all the other in ulupna and implements on which farmers pay 25 per cent duty at least I know that man) Farmers, are now crime for additional pro action on their produce, but in the great majority of cases Hub is merely because they consider that they ought to have a hunger in the pie which they have helped to fill As your (contributor 'Qiiiiia hills, Mr i qiKBtionof free-trade and protection is supply is I to be dead and buried, but his ghost is mill uni aid, and a few of us are yet in hopes that we may see the ghost walk, in the financial sense, and the I r. ii Biirer return to us h inns of the hard < earned money at lime pull him or at last, that we may be excused from paying her any more - hours, U , SAMUEL RINDER.
