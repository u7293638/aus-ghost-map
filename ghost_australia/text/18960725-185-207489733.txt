SOUNDING SAND. There is a wonderful kind of tend which rings, or sings, or barks, when rough winds blow over it, Bounding moat weird and strange. The barking Band in [?] the shore of Hawaii, in the Sandwich Id and?, and sounds exactly like the ghost of a monster dog. Near Capo St. Lucas, in California, a sand-hill keeps on ringing bell?; and in Arabia there is a mountain, which, if you bogin to olimb, will first play the harp, and then get louder and louder till, when you reach the top, it will boom like thunder. The cause of these wonderful sounds is the highly-polished grains rubbing Bgainst each other.
