STORY OF THE „R, si^S INSURRECTION./ . Two men, ragged and tra^l-slimedy-lay sleeping the deep sleep.ofutter'weariness-.on '•; the have floor,ofan-'old'Span^ Island of Cub'ti. ,• < • *" : •' The one with his head; resting :'" of the wB.U o.nd a stewing' : white upon "liis : forehead ^ was.Sh uMes/.fc Marshall, an American J oil l-ualist on: the ''ataft of a paper which Bupported tlie ca.n£g of the Cuban Insurgents, and indeed of revolutionaries all the world over, with the usualvigourof a trans-Atlantic journal. He -: had- imdep&rtqfacairi;^^ surgents, in search of accurate]- details, which he had got—more, in fact, than he /had cared abqut; andeveutually.togetlier with Ilia companion, Don- Jaime do LaiGoatai a leadiug Tevolutioiiai'y, Iell inf,o Uie hands of the Spanish authorities when the. -tro.ops atoruied Lagunitas eutrenehments. •- " Ola comp'anero, wake up-^it is already dawn."/' With tliese words-;rin^ng, iu liis earSj the Auiericau vp-ieed 'hnnBeTf stiffly on one elbow and gazed sleepily about him. Then iheinory camebacli irith ia .pang; and as his eyesfeilon the set face: of I^a' Goata -lie realised thai, this was the last time either would wake from sleep, for both lay under the sentence of death. -..-'': . . .:'"• /y/ By degrees the grey light grew clearer,' until (it length a siiigle golden beain streamr ing 'through' the narrow window, quivered upon the vongli masonry : and dragging hiniselftogether i.iiwards the bai'reiV opening; for he was acMiig iii eyery liuib, ilarriiall looked out upon the sunrise—the last sunrise he would ever see. .///,./':•: Iseneath him lay broad fields of aagarcane, rolling aWay in lush green waves before the morning 'bre^; towaitfs-aowll'of misty mountains/which . rose, against/'.th'e ; eastern sky. Here and tlierc fiat-topped, wliite-walled quintaE nestled' aThong' groves of orange -and-. nispero trees and Broadleaved bananas; while the faint air that entered the celt seemed -cooled"'•until.dew and heavy with the fragrance. of flowers. Under the feathery palnis whifch fringed' the; broad high-road, the white dust lay moist and still,.and put of their blue-greeji shadow cmne the tinkliug of iriule"'"hells and a /clear voice chanting-the choriis;of a viutage.sbrig^ while the merry laughter-of children 'echoed across the wet sword-blades of the sugarcane. Xhe American ground his heels into the boards. The world seemed very good that morning—a place of light and sunshine; and yet before the rising sun. had crossed the meridian, he, now so full of life, would be flung like a dog i;ilo a shallow trench, \- amid bubbling quicklime—and lie shuddered at the thought. . " This is what you get for' interfering in other people's troubles—yellow fever; risk of drowning, a wound when r.thc , troops stormed the trenches, and now—ugh—a white wall and a firingpacty," He muttered half aloud; and La Costa, who was proud of his knowledge of English—or rather American—answered : " Ah,, my front, it is for the fortune of war—all the same in fiftyyear—aiid' we die in a good cause." liven then Marshall could nob but admire the soldierly grace of his- companion, us-tlielatter flunghis arms above his head, showing his broad chest and long straight limbs —a fine type of the old Spanish blood, the American thought; and -lie tried to smile in reply. But it was an unsatisfactory ghost of a smile, for the journalist had tfodesire to die just then—in a good cause or otherwise. Besides, having seen the Spanish, troops, mostly poor hill peasants, torn from their homes by a ruthless conscription, dying like flies in pestilential swamps, and dropping out of the ranks in scores ori every scorching march to die by the wayside, .yet Rearing starvation and siclcuess with heroic, forti-.' tude ; he was by 110 means so sure as he was in the beginning that the revolutionaryparty monopolised the virtues of courage and endurance. Neither was lie so absolutely convinced of the goodness of the cause. Aftefv all/'heiDlioughti^aipbStaiyks right; it would be all 'the same' 1 iff'fiftyyeavs, " ready, present, Ike," a^well-directed volley, tlie sting of a'jbiiHet^-and'afterwards- . im-1 uVjHv.iau-.-' .'I'.a titthat it might not be a well-directed volley ; for he had Been some, ghastly isights ,' that campaign; men, half slain by the bungling; aim of recruit battalions, done : to rdeath . by rifle butt or bayonet thrust; 1 .Anyway; there was no escape now; he must make the best of it, and if the insurgents could take things philosophically he would too. Presently the Cuban also approached'• the window, and pointing to, a distant hillside where tall piling rose-clearly against the morning blue, observed": "There are our friends, the '.Martinez column. It is not far, and yet they do riot know—and to-day we die. ' Ay de miM After this came silence, arid, for-what: seemed hours and hours, the American.; sat with his head in his bands, until-there-was a hammering at the door, and a Spanish 1 soldier stood on the' threshold, beckbriing with his finger. Their time had come; and, pulling himself together, Marshall, stepped out into the glare of tropic sunlights »>; Half a company of Cazadorcs Canarios,- conscripts from the volcanic: rocks of-Teuer riffe and Grand Canary, marchedin' front with fixed bayonets, : and half a company followed behind; tlie iiickel buttons of their dull green uniforms, and the brass Vmedalf lions on their clumsy kepis glinting in the sun.
