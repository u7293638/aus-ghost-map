CHAPtER- LXV —(Continued). ! '*'W*11;'* lie says, (after a pause, 'I don't sup- j pose I had oug-hixto deny my identity— here.' j 'No, indeed!' Baring breaks in. 'We are! all friends here. Yes, Jernynghaiu, he's that j same officer— ' Then turning again to the i stranger, 'Do you tnow, I never heard the j long and short- .of that 'case? Has the poison- i er been found?; Or is it a state secret as yet?' The ( newly-discovered detective seems to hesitate, and then says: 'Well, no, it. isn't a. state secret, although it has not yet been announced— in feet, ' the fellow has not yet been, arrested, but the train is laid, and he couldn't escape if one of you ?were to rush out and proclaim his danger from the housetop.' They all are silent for a moment, then Baring says half to himself: 'It was a horrible thing.'. 'Was it?' asked Stanhope, glibly. 'Well, j I wish yoineould tell us about it I confess to an appetite for detectives' ...reminiscences. Would it be out of the way to ask for par ticulars?' 'Why, no, not if they ^wifl ifiter^st the ladies — of\ -coouse;- .^specially^-as 'you know something about the affair already.' 'It would interest me,' says Rene, her face flushing hotly, 'very much — and you, Mrs. Jermyn?' 'I liave not even lieard of a recent «ease of poisoning,' Mrs. -Jermyn replies indiffer ently. 'Of course, I shall like to listen—' But her tone is more indifferent than her iWords. 'Very well, then,' says the narrator by re quest; and they all compose themselves to listen. The narrator «its oposite Mrs. Jer xnyn, arid Stanhope is close beside her. Bar ing draws forward his chair, and his wife pushes hers a little into the background, and clasps Jier hands in her lip. ; 'The murder was committed &t; tfievdose of the carnival season,' began the narrator, looking over at Mrs: Jermyn, who, being di-'i Teetly opposite -him, came naturally under j his eye, 'at the Hotel Victor, in New Orleans; ?or, rattier, -the body was? found ttrere. .It was pretty clearly shown af the inquest iliat the poison had been administered before the dead -woman was brought into the house. The body was found in the morning. It was that of a young and fine-looking woman, j dressed in some rich carnival costume — every- ! thing about her indicated refinement and deli- i cacy. It was decided 'by the doctors that! she had been a person in delicate health, probably -some northerner come to New Or leans to recuperate. Poor thing! No one knew her; slie. had not a mourner, not a friend, to claim the body. The Toom in whieU j she was found had been secured weeks be- i fore; every thing indicated a skilful hand and ! & daring wit at the bottom of the mystery, j The murder \eae-a strange one; it proved,; upon examination, that the poor girl had been i killed by the hypodermic syringe — a dose of j morphine sufficient to kill had been injected : Into her arm. The house was crowded with j guests, and it seemed ai first as if no one | could tell how the body came there, for, up , to the night before, the room had not' beeii j occupied; then a trunk had been bi-ought to ! the hotel by some expressman, who said it be- j longed to the gentleman and lady wlio had j taken the room. They .were to come during i *he evening.' [ The story is old to all except Mrs. Jermyn. j but she is listening intently, and more and j more as he progresses the narrator addresses j himself to her. } 'At the inquest a witness presented himself Who gave- some interesting aud important evi dence,' he goes on. . 'He had been out all day. with a gay party, and coming in, about mid night,' he saw a man going up the great stair way carrying a woman in his arms. He no ticed that the man was well-dressed, that he wore a light overcoat, and. kept his hat well down over his eyes; that he stepped lightly, and was firm and easy in his carriage. At the room where, . the next morning, the dead woman was found, this man halted, pushed open the door with his foot, and entered. . iWhile the witness was wondering, the mail came out again, and said that his wife had been frightened in the street and had fainted, and asked the witness to go below and order up some ice-water. This he did, and went his way, thinking no more about the matter; (When he saw the body, he was able to iden tify the cloak in which it had been wrapped, and the crimson' drapery which she wore. The i man who brought her there, and who, no ; fioubt, had administered the fatal dose, had pro- ] feably brought her in a carriage, rushed into j *hc- office when thei'e was a crowd about the j desk, demanded his key, and got it before the overworked night-clerk had found time to no tice him, and carried the woman, who was then dead of dying, boldly up the grand stair jease to the room.' Again* he pauses; Mrs. Jermyn is leaning slightly forward, a look of strained expec . fcaney in her eyes. - 'The prisoner,'— she says eagerly— 'was he^ found there?' ; 'NO.' :????? ' ,'.. -..,- ? 'And thJ& waman— she was identified?' 'That's /the singular part of the story; she ?was evidently a stranger in New Orleans: but almo&t; at the last moment a detective, a friend of! mine, made his appearance, and ' identified) the body, it seems that, months befpre, a (young girl had disappeared from her 1 home, a j long distance away from New Or leans, amd detectives J3&6\. been employed :to search fjpr her. At first it was thopght that ? she aadJ been killed by a' jeaknis and dlsap-l pointed/ lover, but afterwards, thfe .officers be-.j came iptetty thoroughly' convinced.-,, that she had sijtoply abandoned her^ome.imd her fa ther tw seek her fortune. She was goodloot ing, jbtever, ambitious, and bold to reckless .:iOessJ She was traced from city to city, and finally, there she lay, a 'stranger in a strange lan/l, murdered, robbed, forsaken in death by thfe mail to whom she had confided her fu -^rure. She had brought her old father to the verge of the grave, caused her father's wife to meet with a violent, horrible' death, .driven a lover to murder and insanity, and brought, by her rash acts, disgrace and imprisonment to an innocent man— all this within less than a year— and there she lay— the victim of a blonde. adventurer, . an. ex-convict, an assassin. ' Poor, ambitious, deluded victim! The career ». fcfce had longed for was ended; her fortune was a . grave in Upton Cemetery. There is her picture. Her name was Bertha War* ham.' He tiad risen quickly;, he is standing before her holding the picture before her wildly staring eyes. She has listened with a grdw ing horror in her face, and now, as. he 'utters these last words rapidly, like, a denunciation, she staggers to her feet, lifts her quivering arms and haggard face towards the ceiling. \f %yiAr falls heavily Cprward, prone lipon the :- fiopr, at his. €eet. ,'..'. ?'.,?':- Her sin ikus found her out. : ;'.'-/? ?..'?: :' ' C-3HAPTJi3jB:- liKVU ' ......y j 'Ob,*1 sotis Bene Baiiritg as they lift -the ^senseless farm and place it upon -a.6Ofa,.'that ??:? x^'^StAbW' --; ' 'v- :'' :-.'.

Hft rises from the Soor- where he iiasibent upon one knee to listen 'to the patient's almost' ini- , perceptible -breathing, and steps back. 'That will do, Rene.' he eays, 'let nature do the rest.' ''?;.. . ? Rene's fan vibrates more siowiy. and sue. gives the sniGlliiig-bpttie into, her husband's hand; but she keeps her place near the head of the sofa. 'Poor thing!' she says, softly, 'I pity her!' - x 'I don't!' says her husband, turning to wards #ie two by the window, 'she's been her own. executioner. Shall I .call her- in now?' Stanhope nods, and Baring goes to the door of the inner room, opens it, and beckons to someone . within. .. . .?.;. . 'Now,' lie whispers, and a tall woman, all angles and sharp lines, with a firm-set mouth, but with infinite pity hi her grey eyes, comes forth. ''??-. ; -'- It is Susan. . . . She- takes the smelling-botHe from the hand of the young physician': and goes, straight to the sofa. ? 'Firm,' whispers Baring. 'Quiet' theu he moves back, and Rene follows him to the window where the two detectives stand. The patient stirs feebly, and Susan, with a quick movement, interposes herself between the sofa and the group at the window, then they are all quiet, silent. ?'' Another movement from the patient — the bead turns from side to side, then she utters a low moan, opens her eyes, and sees the figure beside her. «, ! 'Susan!' . What a cry it is? She clutches at the two firm, unlovely hands, and clings to them con vulsively. ,' ,,. 'There, Bertha, child, you --are better — hush!' y: .'; . ];?? :'''?? ''??' Her eyes -close again/but she clings to the friendly hands. Then once niore ; they flutter open, and suddenly she sits erect, staring at Susan wildly. I V'Drink ? this, Miss Warham;' says a voice at her elbow, and she turns and sees Dr. JBaring at her side, with a wine-glass ia his hand. 'Drink this, Miss -Warham,' he re peats, 'you need it. It is a cordial.' They are prepared for many things — for tears, for hysterics, for denials, for protesta tions, for bravado, for rage. They are not prepared for what comes; they do not quite know her yet— not even Stanhope, not Rene, clever student of her own sex though she is. Twice, thrice, she has been addressed as Bertha Warham; and now, as she looks about her, she sees the group of three still by the window, and Susan standing beside her; she is suddenly, surprisingly calm. She takes the glass from Baring with a steady baud and drains it to the last drop, and as she gives back' the glass she says clearly, distinctly, looking him straight in the face : 'I am not Bertha Warham! I am,'— oh, how bitterly, with what self-loathing she speaks the name!— 'I am Mrs. E. Percy Jermyn.' ? *? 'It is true, then,' says Carnes. coming for ward,-'rhat- she who was once Ellen Jernyng haiu is dead?' Then all that this man has saad— all of his terrible story, word for word, sweeps back upon her memory; she turns toward him a j look of unmistakable horror in her eyes. j \- 'Tell me,7' she cries, 'was it true? Did ! you, did -anyone bury a woman -in Upton—a j woman -whom they called Bertha Warham? i A woman who looked like— like that picture?' i \- With a quick stride Stanhope stands before j her. stern-faced, as Pale. ... ; 'I can best answer tliat,'r he says. 'It was I who found~that body in New Orleans; who identified it as that of Bertha Warham. It was I who took it io Upton and saw it buried by the side of John Warham's two wives; it did resemble that photograph, and it resemb led you even more, It was horribly like you, as you look now. We might have continued 1 to think, it Bertha Warham, but for a dis- 1 covery, made at the last moment, by Dr. i Baring, here, and another medical man; the! blonde hair of the dead woman, that was so j like the hair of the real Bertha Warham, was I only died blonde. The natural hair was j black, ae black as yours is dyed at this mo- ! inent. In your search for something more ; exciting- than Upton and your father's house ! could give you, you have played a desperate j game, and you have left a trail of blood and i guilt and shame and sorrow all along your j path. But your game is ended; so whether j you are Bertha Warham, or the wife of a ; poisoner matters little; you are not Ellen j Jernyngham'; you are an usurper! and unless you tell us all the truth— we already know enough to send the man you call your husband back to the prison from which he came, if not to the gallows— unless you make what repara tion you can, you have nothing to expect from me, from any of us:' If she were doubly the sinner- that she is, i *he is . punished now. In all the days to come, ho matter how dark they may be, she will never suffer again as at this moment, when, standing before her like 'a wrathful Fate, the man whom, in a 'few short weeks, .she had grown to love, -as, hi her -reckless, ambitious life she never dreamed that she could love, denounces her, . despiees her, menaces her in the name of justice; pours -into her eyes from his the scorn he .feels. „ \ ._,. ?'.. For a moment her face is .convulsed, and her fingers wrHhe where they lie' clasped tt-- gether in her lap; .then she rises and stretches out her hands toward him,vana all _the while her eyes look straight into his. ? 'I am guilty,' she cries, 'guilty ofaHihat you say, and more. But not of that — not of Ellen Jernyngham's murder! I did not know it! I had no part in it! Oh, the liar! the assassin! Tell y-Gu all?. Am I not burn? ing to tell you all? -Never fear that I shall keep anything backi The one desire -that I have left is to see him punished! Oh, the eofit, slow serpent!' Her hands drooped loosely, she sways, and falls again, this tune to-be caiight by, Stan^ hope; into whose face for the firstfime comes a ray of pity. . He. lays her; gently down and then recoils with a look of horror; for now, in her death like swoon, she Jooks,' even more than in life, like the dead woman, at the Hotel Victor. They are so like that he feels a- thrill of super stition as he gazes.; and when Baring comes forward the - superstitious thrill passes 011 to him. Something — a look that had not yet. *found its way into her face when ^he1 fell before the finst shock— has byer%nead Jhe ballid features now, and completed the ghastly resemblance. 'It is worse than 'seeing a ghost;' '? Baring mutters acros^i. iiis shoulder io; Stanhope. ,; And now the ; woman in Rene rises and cojh :p-Ss ?all to obey ^ her.
