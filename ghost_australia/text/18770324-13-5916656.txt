NORMANDY IN NOVEMBER. No. ir. The dual aspect of Rouen, which strikes the visitor immediately on his arrival in the famous archiepiscopal city, the presence of two principles, the one quite modern, the other that of the far past, so that the mind works in two distinct grooves in the study of stars far less marked at Caen. The transi- tion from the new to the ancient capital of Normandy is a transition from brick and stirring business to something like the calm of the old Dutch and Belgian towns, to the leisure of VUkggialura. The train whirls -one through some beautiful scenery, Although not through any So beautiful V or characteristic as the country between Le Havre and Rouen, and deposits one in a quiet station, where loiaureliness prevails, and the omnibus service, which is an incalculable comfort in travelling in France, is conducted on the tranquillity and least competitive of principles. Nobody touts for hotels ; nobody tries to hurry one into the wrong omnibus ; the grave drivers and the big grey horses are on the best of terms, and have a mutual understanding that there is never to be any hurry about any thing, and the traveller's very great impression is one of rest and quiet. To this succeeds-when one walks through the ancient town, on the cold bright morning, enjoying the vast height of the sky, and the fine effect of the long lines of poplars planted along the boulevard, which are all topped at this season with a feathery brown-an impression that the people are of a tranquil contented kind, and that there is a good deal of adherence to old ways and old ideas at Caen. No trace of violence marked the public monuments ; the restorations in other places, effected after the rage of the first French Revolution had expended itself upon all that was most noble and most glorious among the records of the past, have been assailed by the fury of later times ; but the more recent storms of popular passion have passed harm. evenly over Caen, and Bet no mark upon the noble monuments which make of the ancient capital a treasure house of art, history, and antiquity. The pastoral surroundings of the town ; the vast outlying plains, on which the young horses bred on the farms graze and thrive; the absence of factories and their attendant noise and smoke there is only an oil "fabrique"at Caen, and the lace-making, which is the chief industry of the place, is done in the cottage homes all these lend it a physiognomy apart. The people are proud of their tranquillity, and, which is even more uncommon in France, of their noblesse. Several very old families lead stately and beneficent lives up in the old quarter, and adhere to the regime of church-going and almsgiving which was characteristic of the period of the Restoration in the provinces. " We never have invites," the people will tell one, and the 25 gendarmes, who occupy a superb building which I could accommodate COO, are amply suffer. I . event for all the purposes for which legend armes exist. The ensemble of the city is wonderfully picturesque, when from the stone bridge one sees the towers and belfries of St. Jean, St Etienne, and Sr, Pierre. The blue sky shining through the pierced trefoils of the unparallelled late of St. (Pierre has an especially beautiful effect as the colour contrasts with the sombre grey majesty of the other unadorned spires, and on a steep height the Hospital, a singularly -fine and spacious building. Every one Bays there is not much to see at Caen, except the churches, but that there are pretty walks in the environs. The churches are, however, a world in themselves-an old world, and a present one-and the walks are indeed delightful. Broad, smooth roads, bordered with poplars in double rows, and kept in perfect repair, with fine views over the famous racecourse (it reminded us of the beautiful racecourse under the old walls of Chester), and the prosperous farms tempt one -to exploits in the way of walking, aided by the bright sunshine and the dry, keen, in- vigorating air, which one looks back upon with amazement amid the mud and darkness of London, as one records one's reminiscences with the aid of lamplight at mid- day. A number of books exist, devoted to the archeology, the history, and the architecture of Caen, subjects which to this day excite more interest among the inhabitants of the city than we found in any other place to "which our excursion extended. At Tours, For instance, even among the better and presumably educated classes, we found little knowledge and less interest in the events and the personages which formed the " illustration of the city which Sir Walter Scott has made familiar and enchanting to every English reader and traveller. But at Caen everybody answered our questions with intelligence, and fully understood that to us the place must needs be full of Rollo, Robert -the Devil, and William the Bastard and Conqueror. There's a bookshop near St. Pierre from which one can hardly tear one's self away, so fascinating are the volumes which lie upon its counters, and appeal to one in old French, with illuminated text, and under the stateliest titles, from the soakage. Here, for instance, is the story of the conspiracy of the barons against Duke William, and of the famous battle of the " Vallon des Dames," when the hero was only 20 years old, and the Irmveres sang of him as " Dux Guillaume, li genz, 11 proz ;" -or, as the modern tongue has it, is general, le Xnreux; and the old chronicler Benoit declared that Jamais on naval ou uno telle solace dans un in Jeune Homme." The "battle-field is distinct still ; a fine road leads to it by the way that Duke William took ; it is still called "Voice le Duc," and only 50 years ago a labourer, carting away the fine white sand of the Dunes, came upon there Teams of an ancient burial-place, three acres in extent, on the traditional site of the Chapel of St. Lawrence, built over the offenses" of the dead in the battle which Saved William's duchy and disinterred a number of skeletons. Among these mortal remains were some of great Biz), answering to the description by the old chroniclers of the knights who fought with and for the illustrious Bastard. These remains were inspected by several archeologists among others by the Abbé Le Court, who gives an interesting account of them in his "Conspiration des Barons Normandy." Ee terminates his recital in these words: - We were gazing upon the remains of men who had been brave, and strong, and rich, and powerful. Since 1917 their bodies had lain in the earth, unknown to all the dwellers upon its surface, even to the shepherd and the labourer, who, as he led his Hock or drove his Slough, had no thought of the dead greatness which he was treading under foot. We were about to retire, when the workman reverently collected the human fragments, forming three skeletons of great size, on which we had been gazing, and replaced them in the | earth. ' I always do that at the end of my day's work, said the man simply. 'I think it is my duty. Are not those the remains of men who were Chr¡8tianalik6 ourselves?' The field of Saint Lawrence is still pointed out, where the foundations of the ancient chapel were dug up in the eighteenth century. The interest of the traveller is naturally greatest in the two famous churches respectively built by William the Conqueror and Matilda his wife, splendidly endowed by them, and form- ing the centre of charitable institutions, un- changed to this day in their object and tradi- tion, which are known, the Conqueror's church as St Etienne, or V Abbaye aux Hommes, and the Duchess Queen's as Li Trinity, or V Abbaye aux Dames." These two solemn and magnificent structures stand at a considerable distance from each other, but both are surrounded by an atmosphere of extraordinary peace and calm. On no occasion during our numerous visits to them was the silence broken, Have by the ring of the stonecutters' tools upon the WocIib of fair white Caen stone (which grows harder and whiter with ago) which are being used in the repairs of the great porch of St. Etienne, and by the case of the rocks of which a numerous colony dwells in the vicinity of La Trials One is always trying to reconstruct the lives of the Conqueror his wife and his sons, hero in the place which seems so full of his memory, where his often disturbed and desecrated remains rest in repose which will hardly again be broken in front of the high altar of St 1 home under a plain marble slab with a simple inscription Hie Bcpultus cat invectiaaimus Gullelmus conqueror Normandorum Dux of AngliL Rex balance comes conditor qui obit MLWWII In the silence of the great church of the grandest and severest Norman Gothic architecture, whose arches and pillars look as if the sculpture of them might have been Gashed yesterday but which were completed in the Conqueror's time for he built the church for his own burial-and we have all learned in our history lessons bow the Conqueror s right to each sepulture was fiercely " interpellated'-one may mass for hours on the scenes which it has witnessed, since the day of its dedication (13th September, 1877), when the duke who had become King of England in the interval since its foundation in 1060 attended the ceremonial with his wife, his sons, his daughters all his nobles, enriched with the spoils of the conquest and the greatest of prelates Lanfranc On the spot where he was to be buried the conqueror made his magnificent offering that day Ten years previously the duke had been present at the dedication of his wife's church, La Trinity and there he had made an offering more precious still his little daughter Cecile (who plays a touching part in the life of her unlucky brother Robert Courthope) who was then and there inscribed on the roll of the Benedictines de La Sainte Trinity The noble damsel became abbess of the convent later and during her rule her mother's body was buried in the church Duke Robert added largely to the splendid endowment with which his father had enriched the Abbaye aux Dames The robbers had great power, ecclesiastical jars diction in several parishes, and civil and criminal jurisdiction which she exercised by a seneschal in the same, and she was mined and entitled Madame de Caen, but the most fanciful of his gifts has the old romance of chivalry attaching to it When, in 1100, Duke Robert returned from the crusade he brought with him the great standard of the Saracens, which he had taken at the battle of Ascalon and laid it in homage to her abbatial dignity at his sister e feet It existed for a long time in the Abbey Church but fell with the other treasures and those of St Etienne, the conqueror crown, sceptre ring, and sword which he left to the church, into the hands of the English in 135 What became of them? Are they still preserved in any of our museums or palaces or are they among the despised and dispersed treasures of the past dumb things with histories in them, soulless things with a whole world of association and interest in them?

In 1522 three Italian prelates visited Caen, and expressed their desire to verify the contents of the celebrated tomb It was opened and the body of the Conqueror was found in such a state of preservation that a portrait of him was taken and hung up in the church opposite to the monument In 1862 the Calvimata devastated the Norman churches, and St Etienne was one of the worst treated Under the pretext that a treasure was concealed in it, they ravaged the Conquerors tomb, and flung out the remains, which were dispersed with ignominy and insult the scene was but a foreshadowing of that which was to take place at St Denis 230 years later, and the sole remnant which was preserved was the thigh bone The church was completely stripped by Admiral Coligny prior to the ' Pacification and a curious old document of the period records that only its walls were left standing In that ruinous condition the great Abbage remained until 1920 when it was again opened for divine service but it was not until 1912 that the Bad relic of the Conqueror was restored to the consecrated earth and a small tomb was erected with an ease in tion which recorded the facts In 1789 the revolutionists destroyed this second tomb on account of the armorial bearings which did violence to their principles, but they did not violate the grave, and in 1861 by order of the Consular Government the often troubled resting place was cleared of its debris and marked by the slab which indicates to the visitor of to day the spot of earth which holds the last fragment of what once was Guillaume h genz li prox The Abbaye aux Dames is less grand and majestic But it is perhaps more interesting for the old world air is upon it more strongly owing to its being still devoted to its original purpose as the abbatial church of a religious order It belongs now to the Augustinian nuns a strictly cloistered community, who wear a white habit and have the charge of the Hotel Dieu built on the abbey lands which were Queen Matilda's (gift Silent sober and peaceful is the 03 pect of the place as we pass by the com emergency and the concierge offers for sale a little basket of the rolled paper Magree work which has been unseen for fifty years and was all the fashion a century ago into a great green square bounded on two sides by wide cloisters, and a bright eyed girl in a nuns dress looks out of a little window and nods to us cheerfully while she rings for a lay sister who will show us the conventual portion of the Abbaye aux Dames where the Queen a tomb in ' notre fondatrice they call her-and the places for the ''maladies and the wide and lofty grille which divides within this division the chapel of the choir sisters from the chapel of the invalids We enter the church the stone is dazzlingly white the sculpture is as of yesterday the stillness order clean lmeBB are exquisite, the decorations are rich and simple the stained glass windows on high are mystically beautiful Behind the lofty grille hangs a thick curtain but we are per- mitted to push its folds aside and look in upon a pure white space with carven choir stalls and a splendid dome roof, gorgeously painted and gilded, and in the centre of the space a plain black marble tomb solid un- adorned This is the resting place of the Duchess Queen, chosen by her and the motionless white figure kneeling yonder, near the yellow glimmer of the lamp of the sanctuary, might be the abbess daughter, in the first long watch of the memorial prayer for any token of change or the passage of time there is upon the place. The Queen s tomb, in which she was laid in 1883 when her crown sceptre and a large quantity of her jewels were given to the Abbaje-was also desecrated, but her rooms were recovered and preserved intact and they rest now in the restored monument ' I have seen the bones said the smiling little man at the anchor, when they re- arranged the chapel and restored the choir they verified the remains and we were all permitted to see them She was our foundress you know.

The present writer learned from the lips of the jovial and kindly old composer, who used to call himself it, doyen de tout le monde 20 years ago, that the was a wonderful place, full of thick clustering shadows of a chivalrous and splendid past Its history, under the Dukes of Normandy, was more grand and important than its history under the Kings of France, into whose hands the ancient capital of Normandy finally fell in 1468, after its brief possession by the Duke of Brittany The old chateau, of which some traces still remain, is an object of great interest to strangers, who climb the steep ascent to it with eager steps, and full of visions of the old old times, when William and Matilda and their court held their state there, of the later days when the states of Normandy were assembled in its vast, gloomy walls, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and the later days than those when Catherine de Medicis carried her young king and bad, Charles the Ninth, northwards from the Chateau de Blois and the fair Tourangeau lands, and received the homage of the Norman nobles in the ancient capital of Normandy, on the same spot where they had paid homage to Francis the First the rot chevalier, the father of her unloving bridegroom, whom she subjugated at length by the spell of her subtle talents and her unwearying patience The chateau presented a brave spectacle in those days, and one no less brave when the man whom Catherine hated most of all mankind perhaps because he was the only man she feared, he who survived and succeeded to all her "Lanson's," Henri Quatre, the seaman, came thither with his wife, the niece of Catherine, the successor to Catherine daughter, the beautiful and dissolute Marguerite, his divorced wife, and the Royal pair were faded and be landed so that no human mind could ever have conceived such possibilities as the knife of Ravaillao for the King, and prison, banishment, and death by cold and privation inflicted by the will of her own only son, for the Queen of that grand and touching pageant The tnpeatneB that lined the feature ways, the sculp- tures and the paintings that adorned them, the portraits of fair women who embellished them, the serious many scripts and quaint drawings which recorded them, are still in the Museum, and in the old Palais de Justice and in the ancient portions of the town the houses lean towards each other, and are lighted by old casements whose ledges rest on quaint carved figures, and have altogether an air of keeping up the memories and hiding in their recesses the ghosts of those old old days and doings. We pass the exquisitely beautiful church of St. Pierre, in the centre of the city, with the tide of modern life surging around it, as the tide of medieval life was wont to Burge, when the great fairs were held in its enceinte, and under that marvellous porch where the carvings seem to be instinct with movement, the leaves to stir with the rustling of the small peering animals, and the saints to uplift their heads in their ecstasy of prayer where the condemned need to pause on their way to death to make amende honorable under neath the roof thus adorned with images of the holy and the harmless-and we come to the wide "Place " with commonplace public buildings around it interspersed with tall old houses, and in the sandy centre a mildewed pretentious statue of Louis XIV , whose ambrosia perruque never did look well in bronze or marble, however it may have looked in horsehair A big, desolate, shabby looking porte soldiers on one side of the square, that adjoining one of the main streets attracts our attention It is an omnibus station, and there a to some long ing men about it. It is the same bureau which has served for the Service des ventures publiques de Caen time out of mind, and a worm eaten, weather beaten old bench stands within the gaping doorway against the stained wall which would be a perfect tree came to certain modern theorists in colour. Perhaps indeed most likely this is the very same bench on which Charlotte Corday Bat and waited for the diligence in which she travelled to Paris reading her rigid classic book by the way and keeping her (fair face cold and unmoved while Bho planned the purchase of the knife at the Palais Royal which was to sever the most execrable of souls from the foulest of bodies when it pierced Marat a base heart The house in which the patriot mar deresB lived is one of the places for which one looks at Caen She was educated by the nuns at the Abbaye aux Dames and left their charge with a high character but grave suspicion of her orthodoxy in a house of the line St Jean a staid modest bourgeois house a room with two narrow windows is pointed out as the chamber of the Mr. who was to traverse Pass b a the Red robs of the parricide where she read and worked and led her quiet life We saw several caps of the fashion which in Paris is known as the "Charlotte Corday in the milliner's shops at Caen but there they are called 1 bonnets du Calvados Caen in a town which grows upon one's liking which leads me to speculate upon a possible return to it in spring or summer weather, when the long lines of trees shall be green, and the wide spreading plains crop bearing when the skies shall be warm as well as high and blue and the broad river gay with boats But these are dreams the present fact is, that we found Normandy delightful in November The Rockhampton Argus reports the following \- 'A thoroughbred gamecock was busily engaged with his wives picking a bone which was lying on the grass About 20 yards distant was a brigalow tree and on one of ten Irauuhes was seated a large hawk, watching the fowls very attentively, and apparently envying them their feed The gamecock on his part kept his eye upon the hawk, occasionally crowing and showing symptoms of wanting a light. Suddenly the hawk flew up in the air described a circle, and with the speed of light shot down among the frightened fowls But blood was to the fore the cock stood his ground and as the hawk approached him he Raw at him and hit him so hard that he brought him to the ground, and before those who were to ik ing on and wondering could reach the spot, the hawk was no dead as Julius Caesar We have heard of a sparrowhawk killing a game cock by lying on his back and ripping him up with his talons when his enemy spurred at him, but we are of opinion that the above tragedy, the truth of which can be vouched for by several eye witueBdoB is without parallel.
