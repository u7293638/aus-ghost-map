JOSH BILLINGS' PHILOSOPHY. I have known peopel to travel on the cars all night to save time, and then sleep all the next day to catch up, but I don't see where the mathematiks comes in. Vanity has a ravenous appetite, and a remorseless digestion. We know a thousand timeB more than we can prove ; here is why our instincts beat our reason. Man, compared with man, is a wonderful creature ; but compared with many other things, he is a mere ghost. All genuine music is pathetic harmony. An educated ear is, like an educated heart, as bloodless as a stone. An epitaph is the safest of all literature. They are always quoted at par, if there ain't a word of truth in them. An idiot is the only being who has a divine right to be an un believer. Old age is honourable, but not always respectable. The reason why good opportunity is so often lost is because most people are hunting for a circumstance. A very long creed is just so much extra baggage â€” at risk of the owner. A literary woman, if she marrys at all, should marry a coxcomb ; she kan despize him az much az she pleazes, and he won't know the difference. The hen iz called a phool, and for kalkulating an eklipse I guess she iz, but for laying 12 eggs in a safe place, and staying with them until they are born agin, she haz no peer. Military heroes are too often military skourges, and should be kept on exhibishun like other feroshus beasts in kages.
