SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS' CONFERENCE. A CONFERENCE of Sunday school Teachers was held in the Divinity Hall Creek- street, yesterday under the auspices of the Sunday School Union. At the morning sitting there were about 120 ladies and gentlemen present. Mr. Simon Fraser, M.L.A. in the chair. The hymn, "Jesus shall reign where'er the sun," was sung, and Mr. B. GREGORY offered a prayer, after which the CHAIRMAN opened the proceedings by saying that the conference was called for the purpose of considering and devising the best method of teaching, and of increasing the usefulness of Sunday schools The results of the efforts of the Sunday School Union so far were not satisfactory, Some time ago training classes were established, but he was sorry to say it had not met with that kind of support which the union were led to expect However it was not proposed to abandon the class, as they recognised the great need for trained teachers, and would carry it on for some time longer, and he hoped the essay s discussions, and expressions of opinion at that conference would result in mutual benefit. He regretted that Mr. J. S. Kerr, who had promised to read an essay on School Organisation was ill in bed. He then read the rules of debate to be observed, limiting the time to be occupied by essayists and debaters THE AIM OF SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS The Rev W Wu He then read the following paper - I rejoice greatly that the union should bring together the teachers for consideration of important aspects of their work, and that the teachers should seek to fit themselves for the more complete realisation of their desires Tlieworl of seeking the religious welfare of the children is one the importance of which cannot be over estimated, and the large army of teachers who go forth to teach and train them for God are amongst the greatest honor factors of their race Seeing you have honoured me with the opportunity of taking part in this conference, and given mean important subject to consider, I will at once ask you to use pt a brief statement on " The aim of the Sunday School Teacher " The committee appear to recognise the fact that each teacher should have an arm This means that there should be careful thought and earnest prayer, followed by direct effort to gain the object in view It is to be feared that many teachers have not defined to themselves the purpose of their Sunday School efforts Desire for occupation is not a sufficient a reason for being in the school, neither is love of friends and fellow workers, but we need to have all our work for Christ in pulpit md in class more directly the expression of well considered part polo And now, what should be the aim of the teacher ' Put emphasis on the distinguish ing word " the " There should be a supreme aim, and that nothing less and nothing lower than the salvation and religious culture of the children Conscious of Gods love to we wish by service to show forth our gratitude to Him This may be called the motive power, and the form in which it expresses itself is in your cases Sunday school work I do not know if teachers have sufficiently thought upon self culture and development of character as grand aims in connection with this work. It is well that the teacher should aim to be, that he may be the better able to do. It is proof of wisdom when a person selects company, occupation, or read ing which will toll for individual improvement on the mind, heart, and life That teacher will do well who puts the matter thus The con seriousness of God's love to me inspires me with desire to serve Him " I can best serve Him by seeking to save and guide and bless the dear children. The Sabbath school offers many facilities for that special kind of service That I may be able to honour God by doing this work I will diligently apply myself to the study of His word, and of the best ways of accomplishing his purpose in the lives of the children " Need I say that such a defining to oneself of motive and method would be a means of soul culture and a source of power You will see from this that the great aim of the teacher is reached by attending to several subordinate aims Dach cause is an effect, and each effect becomes a cause God the great first cause, and then causation goes on, maybe in endless progression The great aim should centre in God The second aim should be the personal realisation of the Christ to-the ideal life. The outcome of these in the teacher is the effort to save and bless the children, for whom Christ died, and who are objects of the Father's love. Then as a teacher simply his greatest aim is to save the souls of the children. Two questions might be asked at this point, and the answers would be of great practical value 1 What do you mean by saving the souls of the children ' 2 By what means may this be best accomplished? 1 What do you mean by saving the souls of the children The discussion of this question would soon bring us into theological debates which are not desirable in a conference such as this, but I may perhaps venture a few sentences entirely on my own responsibility I regard salvation as either the rescue of those who are practically lost, or the prevention of evil to those who otherwise would be lost The former is our general idea of salvation, and that is reached by all evangelistic agencies The latter is not often taken into account, and yet it is the only sense, I believe, in which we can be said to save the young Believing, as I do, that all infants dying in infancy are saved, I also believe, it seems to me of necessity, that all infants living in infancy are safe Dying does not save them, therefore they were safe before they died Such being kept in the simple love of goodness and truth first as seen in good parents, then as taught to find the perfect good of God revealed in Jesus Christ, may be saved from the evils which are in the world, saved from untruth and impurity, and envy, and enmity, and all that is cruel and unjust, and mean from all that which brings the blush of shame and stains the conscience with the sense of guilt The first effort, then, is to take young life and keep it from the evil which is in the world, and nurse and tram it up by love and truth as seen in Jesus Christ in so far as from any reason whatsoever the child goes wrong, and if it should break away from the truth and love of God to any degree, then the second needs to be added We should strive to convert the sinner from the error of his way, for many of the scholars are wrong to some extent, though not so wrong as many others who are far gone in sin These will need the protective salvation of which we have spoken and the rescue salvation from the evil into which they have fallen, and from the state of heart which prompted them to stray I have expressed it thus so as to avoid the theological and ecclesiastical terms as far as possible By salvation of children I mean not the imposition of ecclesiastical rites or ceremonies, of the inculcation of the formal statements of theology, but the preservation of simple and beautiful child life by bringing upon the children the blessing of Christ or the rescue from evils into which any may have fallen, or both In all cases there is a nature which calls for renewal in the love and truth of Christ, and a life which calls for guidance, protection, and culture for the divine glory TIk teacher is under God, and as the servant of Christ, taking up this work of guiding protect- ing, and cutting the lives of the children I come now to the second question £2 By what means may this salvation be best secured ' How shall the teacher reach his ideal of service for Christ' Let us ask where God begins, and where He lids taught parents to begin It is in the heart at d with the heart God u love, therefore He loves and we love Him because He first loved us The first step towards the final aim is to love the children, and each step needs to be prompted by love To beget the confidence and affection of the scholars is essential, and these will not be given mic sponge to anything which comes of mere thought or organisation , it will be in response to confidence and love on the part of the teacher It will be much easier to get the children to love God, if first of all the teacher can win their love to himself because of some what divine in him. The young will also go from the lessor to the greater, and from the known and soon to the spiritual and unseen Love will do more than logic Love is the highest learning Love is the most effective disciplinarian Live begets love and " He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him Othcriiiiliienccsspriii^fortlifroiiitliis for love must needs be of initial of results Childs co are social beings and the company of the Sunday school needs to be congenial seek to make it a happy family , give the scholars, as best you can an interest in each other Organisation has its uses God is not Uip author of confusion Love is orderly and methodical, because order is more pleasing than disorder to the beloved School life forms companionships for taste, and even for eternity , so it should be not the scholars find the school a home and a temple in one The teacher will not regret any care and kindness shown to the scholars Each one should be upon the teacher's heart, and something more than a few minutes' teaching on Sunday should come of being a teacher in a school I know teachers are busy, and have not much spare time, but those who have elder classes can hardly expect to reach their aim, unless, indeed, it he a very low aim, by the Sunday lesson only The so young people are setting forth upon the way of life, and if they are to be secured for school or church, 01 for the cause of God and truth, it is imperative that there be personal attachment between teacher and scholar, and with a view to that there must be warm and loving in crest in all that concerns young life Not putting old heads on young shoulders, but keeping a young hear t in the teacher's breast Teaching there must be, but the effect of the teaching, to ; the spiritual results, will depend more largely upon those cords of sympathy which bind the teacher and the taught than upon any learning or skill displayed in the lesson itself I do not undervalue anything which can come as the result of study, organisa- tion, or authority, but it is not possible to over-estimate the value of the social and heart work, first as an aid to order, and then as a power for getting the heart for Christ If the scholar loves you, and you love Christ, the scholar will be predisposed to love Christ too The teacher's and may be secured by providing such pleasures as are of a social and helpful kind, and such lessons as are instructive and such ftiondsasarc amiable, and such devotions as are enjoyable have said nothing about the cross, but I wish for the shadow of the cross to ho over every page Teaching of the cross as the result of the world's sin and the source of the world's salvation Let the children be taught from the cross to suffer rather than son to suffer, if needs be, for well-doing Let them learn that Jesus by thus suffering conquer ed sin, and that having conquered son death could not hold him, and heaven could not refuse him Trusting in Jesus they will receive of His spirit, and be conformed to His image When the scholar is becoming more and more like Jesus, the teacher has reached his noblest ann It will be helpful to teachers if they are found at the prayer meeting, and get the scholars to be there to it with some of them, and keep them in countenance Get them under the notice and into the acquaintance of the pastor, an 1 have them mindful of the Church as a home for the heart in religious fellowship Do not make ci ideas of the scholars by teaching them to note defects and faults in the people of pastor of the Church, rather seek to develop some love and even pride on account of the place where they are taught, and the Church and all else connected with it In closing this short paper I can only pray that we may all be filled with the Holy Ghost, and moved to such service and such methods as shall have Divine approval May you all have a high and noble aim, and also displeasure of seeing that your efforts are not missing the mark, which is to you The prize of your high calling of God in Christ Jesus " At the conclusion of the reading of the asSay the reader was loudly applauded The chairman invited discussion, but no one responded Mr E Gkkooky read a paper on "Sunday School Addresses,' in which, after referring to the need of training classes as aids to a teacher, he said teaching was a sort of inspira- tion -a divine gift rather than an acquired art He advocated addresses being given in the schools every Sundaj- hodidnotraean sermons, of a mere dishing up of Bible lessons in the teacher's own words The duty of delivering the address should not devolve on the minister, nor would it be wise for the superintendent to always undertake it A man might be an excellent superintendent, but unfitted to always address the school to whom must they look then, but to the teachers But here great care was necessary It would not do to press in the willing and unwilling alike He was about to touch on a ticklish question Why should the addresses be confined to the male teachers alone ' Why should not the ladies to liver some of the addresses The Sunday school was looked on as being the nursery of the Church, then who so fitted to act as nurses, whose voice so sweetly persuasive as that of a woman, and who could limit the result of that influence if exercised in the Sunday school, and who more likely to rivet the attention of the scholars The address should combine references to all the work of the day, and it was necessary that all teachers should qualify themselves for their duties in every respect, from teaching to that of superintendent The Chairman said it was a matter of contention as to whether there should be a system of addresses or not Dr Harvey spoke in favour of the great influence and good work of ladies and favoured the idea of their giving addresses Mr R Bulcock, M.L.A., said young teachers should be encouraged to speak, so that they might become proficient in the art of addressing children. He did not favour the idea of ladies delivering addresses in schools, and was afraid if tried it would be found that their fluency of speech would forsake them on such occasions Mr. J E Jones expressed his approval of the system of addresses proposed by Mr Gregory, so far as they would relate to the lessons taught during the day, for he failed to see how children could be interested in a subject of which they were ignorant Mr T. SliAUOlITBH opposed the idea of addresses being given every Sunday He had seen it tried ; it had proved a failure, and had driven all the elder scholars from the school Very few indeed had the gift of addressing children so as to be able to interest them, and if they failed in this it was an in Diction that the scholars could not put up with Mr. Hodcikn was in accord with the last speaker and said some of the lessons were too deep for many of the children to understand, even if explained in an address, besides, all the teachers would not have presented it to their classes in the same way He strongly urged the necessity for teachers improving themselves by studying and practising speak ing so as to be able to address the school children. Several others joined in the dm cussion, and Mr Gkvgoiiy, in reply, said Sunday schools were a long way off being what they should be The best system of lessons, so far, was the ' International," but he did not say they were the most perfect that could be adopted They should work on some plan that all schools could adopt They should work on some such lines as adopted by the State, and have none but trained teachers He had brought the subject before them more as a matter to be aimed at than to be adopted just now under the present circumstances The ClAim AN expressed pleasure at the result of the conference so far, which was then adjourned until 2.30 p.m. AFTERNON hlTTJbO. The conference assembled again in the afternoon, when Mr N Lade took the chair There were about eighty teachers present Mr J E Jones read a paper on training classes suggesting three modes namely- the Union training Class, the Visiting Trainer, and the Teachers' meetings and laid it down that the Sunday School teachers at present are inefficient, and therefore needed training. He inquired as to what extent training could be carried on in any or all of the departments, and invited an expression of opinion on the points named He urged the necessity 1 for good training and submission to discipline Mr GkfgoiiY suggested that teachers should mci t one night a week to prepare themselves for the following Sunday, and this would do away with what is now felt as a great deal of awkwardness in dealing with the I subject-matter of lessons Mr G T Htmus supported the idea of training classes, and thought the discussion would take practise 1 , shape Messrs R Bulcock, T Snuoiui ii, and J Hark i n spoke in advocacy of the means of training suggested by Mr Jones, who in lef ly expressed pleasure at the practical tone of the discussion Mr. J Jesym» next read an essay on the subject of " How to retain our older scholars " dealing first with the causes of their defection, which he enumerated at great length, and the cure The causes were attributed to want of interest, example of teachers, and having Sunday school teachers who were not professing Christians or converted and the cure lay in having none but teachers whose whole soul was in the work, and so lead the scholars on to a better life. The subject excited some discussion, and in reply Mr Jfvyns said he should be proud if the discussion of the subject I had a practical result Mr Lang expressed his pleasure at presiding over the conference, which adjourned at i 15 p in until 7 pm evening sums On the conference assembling after tea Mr. R Bulcock M L A , took the chair There were about eighty ladies and gentlemen present Part of a hymn was sung and a pray or olfcicdbyMr J E Jones Mr Jowriivtí Having read an essay on Infant Classes and commenced by stating that he was not in favour of excluding very young children from Sunday schools, and there fore affirmed the desirableness of retaining infant classes First, because it gave two or three years' additional culture, second, that invaluable habits may be formed in an infant class that cannot be formed at a more advanced age, third, that by taking a child from the nursery it can be trained in nature's own ways, and, fourth, that no place is better calculated to counteract the poison of wrong example and practice at home He then pointed out that attention had been paid to every requirement of the schools except for infants Asopaiato room should be provided for infants The infant class wishes most important in the Sunday school and it should be under a teacher with special qualifications Mr Tonks in ct stressing the paper, said he would have been glad if Mr Harris had given some practical hints as to what kind of oral teaching should be given to infants In his school the teaching was limited to ten minutes only for any one subject, and as they became able to deal tim infants were drafted out to a higher class Pictures should form one of the great features of imparting knowledge to infants, but there the difficulty arose It was almost impossible to procure suitable pictures here The method of teaching infants was the most difficult of all the school organisations to deal with Mr Jin\\\,s gave his method of teaching, which was of al Mr K Knut, in speaking of the importance of infant classes, cited the saying of a. sort vin Pope, " Give me a child until he is seven years of age, and then I don't care where he goes to " He was of opinion that the parents were the best teachers of infants. After some further expression of opinion Mr H nuns replied briefly Mr H M RirVE introduced the subject of school organisation by reading a few paragraphs from a book on the subject by Mrs Louisa David , written in 18th, Mr T Slvuciiiimi spoke on the subject, and expressed reign of that Mr Kerr was not able to be present and read his essay He would not like to be so strict a system carried out in Sunday as in day schools, yet there was room for great improvement in the matter of school organisation, because it would promote harmony of action and prevent friction Mr Gul cou\ thought there ought to be the same system of admission as pursued in the day school in taking name, address and other particulars, and this would be best obtained by having a visiting staff, as by that means they would get a footing in the houses of the children in a pleasant friendly way In regard to the great want of teachers he advocated linger classes and dividing the schools into four sections only Mr Ji-nvns and two other gentlemen joined in the discussion Mr J HAltltls thought it would be a wise thing for the Sunday School Union to offer peaceful designs of a model school building with suitable furniture He was under the impression that much could be done in the way of promoting discipline and order in the schools, in which respect there was much room for improvement Messrs Rek\ h and SlyuuiuMi replied The Orientals, in conclusion, said the conference had, he felt sure been profitable to all, and hoped that now having been successfully established would be held regularly every year The Rev Mr Williams moved a vote of thanks to the essayists, which was duly seconded and carried, as was also a vote of thanks to the trustees of the Divinity Hall for the use of that building. The Rev Mr Wniiivts pronounced the benediction and the conference terminated
