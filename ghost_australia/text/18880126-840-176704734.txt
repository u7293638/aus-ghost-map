THE EXPOSURE OF SIIA.KESPEATIE. Beadehs of tho St. James's Gazette havo already been told something about the researches which Mr. Ignatius Donnelly is qood enough to undi.-i tnlto into tlio doings of: that urchiin poster, Wi'lium Shakespeare (says- tho above named journal). Tho ' ex-Senator of Min nesota ' has now finished his labours, Â»nd has done Shnkespi-aro's business. Miss Delia Bacon and Judge Holmes, of America, and Mr. Thompson, of Australia, and iu particular Mr.'. Henry P6tt,'were quite right. It was Bacon ?who vrntp Ibn tiIrt r ; Rhnkesn'Mirn. a -nftrAfin nf low tastes, merely took the profits, and acted as Lord St. Alban'R ghost. Wo need hardly re capitulate the arguments by which Mr. Ignatius Donnelly has arrived at this conclusion. Suffice it to say .that tho Donnelly boom iR ' a big thing' indeed, as our esteemed contemporary tho Daily Tciigraph has at once perceived. There are two columns of that paper about Bacon and Shakespeare ('Shucou' and ' Bako Mnearo ' have been suggested as suitablo names for the composite author), and facsimiles enough to convince the -world that more than ono newspaper keeps an expert in caligraphy.
