(Cheers.) Now, gentlemen, see how -different this is fioin what happened 10, 12, .14 years ag». The X.ibj^al party, was defeated in 1874. The j Liberal party was not reinstated tifl 1880, and I will venturje to i *ay that of those BIS years for the first three or four there were no real j signs of a revival. Things remained in | at state of stagnation. We could, uot | say with truth and With moderation t]»t I any decisive indication tad beeu giren o«* that great progress had been made, j The p'Ogress wan ciade in the last tbree j or probably the last two, and above all( the last year or veer and a half. There fore, six years it took, to bring about a i decisive change of public opinion. How 1 does the case stand now ! You are only j 12 months from the last dissolution and j already you can point to evidence-I do ! not say that it is absolutely demons&ri; tivp, bnt it isgood and sound so far as j it goes ; it is diversified, and' it baa notj been cooked (laughter and ^che^rs) within 12 months of youc ^annihilation (laughter) you are able to point to the : remarkable manifestation ;<»£ jthe strong, vivid, determined movement of | ublic opinion in your favour. (Loud cheers.) Allow me. gentlenipn^ to "tfell you an anecdote that will not occupy a moment.; Last week I met a lady, an old and esteemed friend of mine, a ve>y kind friend^ but who has the misfortuue of being-ap strong Tory, and wl o mjast hav« some difficulty in reconciling with the high p<inciples of '! oryisin the recent extraordinary manoeuvring and oj>er ati<ius that the Government have been i performing in the abandonment and betrayal of their own friends in relation to ihe Irish land. (Cheers and laughter} ' We were talking over the recent speech of Lotd Salisbury at the Oarlton Club. This Lady was very much annoy<-d tha. Lord Salisbury should have exhibited great fear of a.dissolution. (Laughter.) I said. .' WW', it is very unreasonnbl" indeed, (iiat he of all people in the w<n*ld should aread a dissolution. Does not -everybody know-presuming to speak of myself as a symbol of ihe party -" is it Dot an established fact, that at tbe general election 12 months ago I was extinguished (Laughter.) She said to me. with considerable readiness, " Tes; but you =>re popping up -«gain." (Lauahter and loud cheers.) Well it is most neci-ssary that our friends in Loi'tion and in the country, alt of whom are centres of thought and action inthrir several "districts, should have conveyed to them with accuracy the presentsitoation. a?it is faUedof public ajfairsandl will iooh for a moment at what I may call a state [ ment of the account between Us and the jreritlemeh, entitled in mv opinion to the j highest respect-I have not a word, to say in disparagement of them-'hose who call themselves 'Liberal Unionists, but whom I confess I- prefer to call by wliatjl think the more accurate name of Dissentient Liberals. (Hear, hear.) 1 Now, there is~a distinction to be drawn of the utmost importance between Dis sentient Liberals within the House ®f Commons andihat body of electors ^of the country who at - the - last election either voted against or-through scrnples and difficulties about the question of1 BomeBLuIe, which the/ lhad aiot shfE cienly considered-1-abstained from voting altogether.' < The consequence of their abstention or of tlieir opposing us was that they returned to Parliament a body of gentlemen, many of them very able men, who give themselves the title of Liberal Unionists. Now, gentlemen, 1 do not .believe 1 thai these Liberal Unionists themselves . at the time tba» they w«ro returned understood orbad the smallest idea of tha position in which they wpuld fibd. thems&lves; afterfraids. (Sear, hear.).. .And mogt certain am I that the liberals--of the countrywho allowed themto go in by absfoinwgjdr who supported them by their Votes, bad n&t; jthe faintest anticipation of what was about to happen; .but jwhafc . they thought was this, that a broad measure, had been proposed-namely, Home Role for Irela'tid-which w*s qnestionabJe, jwhicii was ^doubtful--some of them may have thought was mis chievous-hat tbey thought that in all other respects those Liberals, were Liberals <§!$*?» hear), and that thev would continue to maintain a united action with -us - upon principles of Liberalism (hear,hear), and, .above all, that they would unite with us* to oppose the odipas system of coercion ior Ireland. (Loud eheere.) What lias: been tbe the result ? Tbe result has been that those 70 gentlemen-and do not suppose for pne moment- th*t 1 am questioning their honour or the. fatal consistency with which they h*ve foHow«l out the logical consequences of a particular opinion-those TO gentlemen have found themsj|lv£s to*ally finable to admit JL into any of their councils; they hare found themselves compelled to behave towards us as if we had been their life long foes (cheers); th«y have found themselves obliged to become the most thorough-paced supporters of the Tory [Government; and 1 do not say they are nconsisteat. (Loud laughter ) The rebole source of tlieir error lies in one :alse opinion -viz,, that we are teasing :o pieces the Empire which, gentlemen, t is tbe wish of every man in this room, nith all his* heart ana soul and strength, <o compact, together, jpd .to consoli Ute.* ' (Loud cheers.) It is under his absurd <dfiluradnv-l hope it is »0t discourteous to ufce that* phrase -that theee gentlemen have #cted. it if) better toeupport a "Rtry Jorerment than to allow the * British Empire to be torn to pieces.

These gentlemen have retained the balanoB<of t^rmIndB. (Langhter and ehe^riL^ rfchtese,/ gentlemen, I take it, miA|k note than to take ii (Laughter.)

Having done that, I will venture rfor a ^moment to nsaaoie tlie office a£ ldt!tic,''Aad to make one or.two observations to yon pn the position of' tfa ppety'. , Theft |»te among these gentleman a nqjp^ef of wliat may be called very soouid Liberals -some of- them who bave'be&i; firm Liberals others who .have b£e6. called rather uproarious Liberate. (Laughter) Within the lust 20 or 25,yeara there have been divisions in tbeLiberal party. There was a serious division in the Liberal party in the year 1806, when Mr. Bright exercised his great abilities and his sarcastic power to describe the Care of Adallam and its inhabitants (cheers and laughter), and it is some what more than a fortuitous concurrenc that you find opon inspection, frith hardly an individual exception, ^H^y m&nipho; was in the Qare of Adnljam 20 or 25 years ago is now in a atill largpr and somewhat more airj «are (langh'er), which Mr. Bright hinwelf has, unfortunately, helped to fabrinte for them, and forms part of this formid able body of Liberals with which we are contending. You will recollect also that there was a sort of streak, if T may eo call it, of Jingoism in the Liberalism of 10 years ago. Academical Liberalism was very much disposed to Jingoism. (Cheers and laughter.) All theeemnte academical Liberals ' were so dis posed to Jingoism, and ?. TFfaereas after the subject races HI the East wt-re ground down, they rp-sppeared having undeigooe the.1 operation which Mr. Disraeli once wittily described being " i?»>ufnikhei," they now as great upholders of the Union oflre- - land and strong opponeute to Home Enle [to BE COKTliroBD.} QraBMso?
