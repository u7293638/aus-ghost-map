It was not till the time of Atagulphe the Abbot, who was transferred to St. Hobart from St. Afghan at Orleans, that the rule of St. Benedict was introduced. Like many another reformer, his zeal cost him his life, and he was put to death by a faction of the community who seem at that time to have been little better than a company of lawless ruffians. The monastery at first boasted that it held direct from the Holy See. This independence was lost by the adherence of the monks to the Avignon Popes during the Schism. When the unity of the Holy See was restored, the Pope, who belonged to the opposite party, punished them by putting the monastery into commendation. At the hands of the commendators the monks suffered much and long, for they were generally secular princes, who thought of nothing but getting the utmost temporal advantage out of the islands. And the benefice must have been well worth holding, for we find the distinguished names of both Richelieu and Mazarin in the list of com- mendatory. In the sixteenth century two changes took place : the seignorial rights vested in the monastery to the larger islet of Ste. Marguerite were handed over to the town of Cannes and the brethren united with the branch of Reformed Benedictines bearing the name of St. Justine, of Padua. This union produced a revival of order and discipline for a time, but the improvement was only temporary. The monks relapsed again into their regardless ways. In 1788 there were but four of them left, and they went away without any remonstrance when the commissioners appointed to disperse them arrived. Quite recently there has been a revival of the old monastic life, for after changing hands several times the island has been bought by the Bishop of Freyres, who, with a grand function that recalled the old days of ecclesiastical pageants, restored it to the hands of the Cistercian. There they have remained unmolested during the troubles of their Continental brethren, so that the cradle of Western monasticism seems likely enough to prove its grave.
