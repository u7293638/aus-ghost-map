The Road to Buin. THE Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company pay only at the rate of six per cent, dividend for the half-year. We thought all along this would be the case; indeed, the only thing we wonder at is that any dividend is paid at all, for during the past six months the most lavish outlay, and the most reckless waste of money has been indulged in. We append a few items:— One pot of red paint, and loan of a brush for painting two engines £0 7i One do. do. green paint ... 6 New broom for waiting-room 41 Entirely new step for Butts' platform, 6 x 2£ 0 3 Putting-down same... .. 5 0 Doing-up Secretary's hat ... ... ... 2 Two lessons each in manners for officials, at Id. 4 6 Stopping an extra train at Butts' Station 0 2i Cleaning out smoking-carriage once a month ... 2 Pasting newspaper over broken windows 0 4 Cleaning carriages once during the six months 1 0 0 £1 16 7£ After all this outlay, who can wonder at only a six per cent, dividend? THE MARYBOROUGH GHOST.—There lias been a good deal of excitement about a ghost alleged to have been seen at Maryborough lately, to the great alarm of the inhabitants. From inquiries made recently it has been discovered that it is only the ghost of Mr. M'KEAN'S chance of re-election. "MR. WEST HE DID HIS BEST."—Mr. WEST was not up to the longitude of North Melbourne when he was asked " where the revision of the tariff ended and protection began?" He should have answered "that the former took place when the finances had all gone, and the latter when the man had filed his schedule:" not under the new Act, of course.
