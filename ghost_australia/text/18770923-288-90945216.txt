^tsxtixtQ |tas SPORTING TN ENfU.AND. [By Weston.] The meridian of the present racing season Las been marked by the death of owe who throughout the British Doininioug was known as The Admiral. For well nigh half a century he was the ruling spirit of the Turf, and the one object of his life was to promote its best interests. A link ?jetween the vtast and the nvesent. he was one of the few left who raced when George IV. was King. Link after link of that chain which boiuid the new and the old together has snapped, till now only General Peel, the Earl of 'Wilton, and Mr. George Payne are left. The last race meeting he attended was Epsom, on the Derby Day, and on the same evening he dined with the Prince of Wales at the Marlborough Club. Tbenceafter society knew him no more. During his last illness the Queen and all the members of the RoyalFamilyevincedthe keenest interest in his 'welfare, and his death has occasioned universal regret. He had taken a correct diagnosis of his own case, for when asked by his medical man, ' What is the matter, Admiral ?' he replied — ' The' matter of 82 years, doctor.' Seven years ago the death *of his wife — she was found dead by his side in bed — had been a shock, and it 'was observed that the upright fierure which defied the keen blasts of Newmarket Heath stooped as it had not before, and the hair was whitening fast. The details of 50 years of turf life can hardly be condensed within the limits of a paragraph. But we may say briefly that when he took the reins at Newmarket the Jockey Club was heavily in debt, with circumscribed pos sessions, and in no way acting for the good of the Turf. He paid off the debt, he added some hundred acres to the pro perly of the Club, he increased its revenues more than four-fold, he elaborated a code of racing law that is a text-book through out the world, and he gave prizes at New market such as his predecessors never dreamed of. As a Turf arbitrator one of the best features in his character was his readiness to listen to any case, grievance* or complaint, by whomsoever made, and as he frequently would say, he was there to encourage and help those who, like himself, ' were in the ten pound line of business..' Whether a better sphere of action might not have been chosen for such great abilities is not the question to lie raised now or here. ? England and English-speaking men will not forget that the work which he took in hand he did with, his might, and that he shed over the «port the halo of a great name, a name synonymous with honor and. honesty, and which has' -often saved it from reproach. He commenced one of his famous letters to the Times with the words,' ' So long as these islands keep their heads auove water, so long, . win norse-racuig flourish.' And we may add so long as horse-racing flourishes will the name of Admiral Rous-be cherished as that of a man 'who did that he did in a general honest thought and common good to all.' Would there were. more like him. Tbe.earlier days of June -witnessed the annual Middle Park Sale. If there was no eucb; sensational price hb that given by Bobert Peck last year, viz., 4,100 guineas ? for Maxmilian, still the, young stock did not go for much under their value. Forty five lote realised 12,285 guineas ; making an average of 278 guineas. The colt by Rosicrucian out of Bas Blue, was generally \ spotted as the fancv one, and Captain'' Machell secured him.at.1,500. The brother to. Ersilia, by Rosicrucian out of Hilda, reached 1,050, and a filly by the same sire, out of Pandore, a daughter of old Caller Ou by NewtainBter, fetched 900. There' is nothing much wortli' recording about the other lots, and so. we may turn our thoughts . from tfoe paddock to the post- . ? ? ', Ascort'is par excellence ike meeting bf the, year, . Over the famed Berkshire ' heath nearly all; the best horses in training jBtrive for the inastery. Another feature :--'$H .)?-??? -? ~r ?--?? ???'.';.'?:? --I:' ....;? I ?-. ?n its favor is that the races of a mile and over are numerous and important. If the two-year-old races were weaker than* uMial, the sport in other respects was excellent. The Queen's Stand Plate was really a match between Springfield and Ecossais. Tom Jennings thought no horse in the world could lead tcossais out of slips, but hn found his mistake, and Springfield is probably one of the fastest horses that ever trod the turf. What weight he could give away to the Derby horses it would be difficult to say, so easily did he trot away from Rob Roy. That Silvio had some tbinw in band when he won the Derby was certainly proved by the way in which he carried his penalty and won the A6Cot Derby, beating Glen Arthur and others with marvellous ease. The Prince of Wales Stakes was the good thing for Glen Arthur that on paper and judged by the Derby running it seemed to be, and by this the Royal Hunt Cup seemed at bis mercy, but tbe boy who rode him could do nothing with him ; yet Bates considers him a nice kind horse for a boy to ride. As it fell out Lord Wilton won it with Cradle, who thus followed the lead of his sire, Seesaw, who defeated Cock d' the Walk by a neck for this race in '69. ! The way that Skylark mowed down the treat Rosebery for the Vase was astonishing. But it is the old story. When handicap horses meet class horses they find their level. But the hero of the week and the champion of the year is PetraTch, and there is now no question that he is a Cup horse of the first quality, and all doubts as to his stamina are removed. Tom Cannon made a waiting race of it, and going down the Sevinley Bottom he was about 200 vards behind Sugarloaf, who until he bolted J made tremendous play. A mile from home F. Archer forced the pace on Skylark to find out any weak spot, but Petrarch stayed as well, and always having the speed of his rival won very easily when Tom Cannon asked him to go to the front. Appended are details of the principal events: — The Gold Vafe, given by Her Majesty, added to a sweepstakes of 20 eovs. each. Two miles; 9 subs. Lord Falmouth's b.c.

Rhi doiToch and Skylark, John Day lying next, clear of Rosebery and Dalham, who were several lengths behind. After ? rounding the top turn Labyrinth took up tbe run ning, ard simultaneously with tlie advance of Rosebery into third place John Day be came fourth, Rhidorroch going on fifth, clear of Skylark and Dalham, which pair were tailed off a long way descending the Swinley Hill. There was no other change worth mentioning until half-way through, the Swinley Bottom, when Altyre resumed the lead, and John Day ioinine him at the turn into the old course, the pace improved sufficiently to get rid of the steeple-chaser, who was successively passed by Rosebery, Rhidorroch, and Skylark, before reaching tie last turn. Altyre and John Day entered the straight side by side, and the former giving way directly afterwards left the lead with John Day, who was instantly headed by Rosebery and Skylark, the latter of whom settled the favorite 'without an effort, and won in a canter by three lengths,. Rhidorroch finish ng a neck behind Rosebery, a length in -.advance of John Day, who was unquestion ably 'second best/' Dalham cantered in next, and Altvre -whipped in.

Sagar ' loaf jumped off at hia beat pace, aa if the diatanee traa half a mile only, and on passing the aland had* dear lead of nearly a bimdred yard*. Controversy and Skylark lying next abreast, clear of Cotmmarie, ?eraral length* behind whom followed Pettarch and Wild Tommy aide by aide. At the top torn Controversy drew dear of ' 8kyiark, and Wild Tommy parted company with Petrarch, who momentarily ran slug gish, aa if anxious to return to hia corn bin at the stable* does by, which, will account for Tom Cannon 'driving' him to catch bis horses at that point Descending the Swinley Hill, 8ngarloaf increased his lead, 'but had not proceeded two hundred yards b. along the bottom before he bolted out of the courae by jumping the ditch which runs alongside it. Controversy was thereby left with the lead, and Petrarch having re peated Wild Tommy at the foot of the hilL soon gave Coomossie the go-bye, taking hia place at tbe quarters of Skylark, in which order they ran to the Brick-kilns, where Wild Tommy got on better terms with his hones. It turned \- out to be an expiring effort, however, as he dropped further astern before reaching the last turn, where the two favorites closed aimultaneouely with Controversy. When fairly in the straight both headed him, Petrarch, who was on the outside, having his necic in front, and gradually increasing his advance, he settled Skylark at the dis tance, and won, without being called upon, by a length; Coomassie, who got within two length* of the leading pair at the dis tance, finished six lengths behind the aecond, a dozen in advance of Wild Tommy; whilst Controversy, who pulled up very leg-weary, trotted in some distance behind. ^ ?
