We have such a scene here. A ! host of our cabbies have subscribed a memo | rial to the City Council, imploring the coun-' cil to rsfuse for the future to grant a license to one Sparling, a cabowner,' whom, after tlie style of General Boom, the remonstrants declare to be a "disgrace to the service." : I dare not rertal what I aui told about Spar ling, save the one published allegation of wrong-doing, .ty. wit,, his'permitting hi*cab to be used by a ; husband for the forcible abduction of his wife from the public street to his own house: 'Funny situation, is it not? Funnier,, too;, when it is known to have taken place right in front oflhe Cen tral Police Office; and opposite to the George Hotel. - The woman had a protection order,; and resisted - the essay at abduction, but was carried off. The police; were then waked up, and went in pursuit—all in broad daylight, mind; you-~and found the woman and her husband struggling in the house. The woman' made a complaint, and the man wauduly dealtwitL,by the lriagistrates. The sequel was the appeal by the cabbies to the City Council, whose sub- committee have held an enquiry, and will report to the Coun cil at its next ■sjsfinf '* -„
