There aro three paths opon to tho Treasurer who seeks to rectify tho finances of tho colony, lie must either reduce tlio present expenditure until it equals the revenue, or ho must impose taxation to bring the revenue up to the expenditure, or he must judiciously combine both of these expedients. Our present expenditure is still based upon the boom period, when the revenue was unnaturally inflated. Is it not possible to cut down this expendi ture to such a figure that its increment shall only beproportionate to the existing natural increment in the revenue, the increase in population and tho consequent necessary expenses of tho Government? If we com pare tiie revenue of 1886-87, the year before the boom, with that of 1892, wo find that there is an increase of almost £1,000,000 sterling in favor of tho latter year, the actual figures being £7,601,124 in 1892, as against £6,733,826 in 1886-87. Such an increase is surely a most healthy sign of tho progresaiveness of the colony during that -period. Hut unfortuuatoly the unnatural tomporary inflation of the revenue during - tho boom led to corresponding inflation in the expen diture; and if wo wish' to keep our books in tlio businesslike way whioh any business man follows, wo must reduce our expenditure iu proportion to the reduction of our income. If an indi vidual trader does not follow this salutary rule he must eventually end in ,tho bank ruptcy court, and tiie same laws that govern the business of the individual govern thosoof every financial undertaking, even of a great Government. AVe increased our expenditure during the boom, and when that exciting poriod was over it was tho bounden duty of every patriotic states man to consider how the expenditure could be reduced in proportion with the falling revenue. But nothing of tlio Hurt was done, and the natural consequence is that our expenditure far exceeds our revenue. It is nonsense to talk of tiie colony retrograding. The revenue of 1891- 92 is £984,327 greater than it was beforo the boom, a most satisfactory increase ; .but the expenditure was £2,248,572 in 1891-92 more than it was in 1886-07. This grossly inflated expenditure is the source of all our financial troubles, and unless it is largely decreased wo cannot hope to return' to a sound financial footing, except, indeed, wc are willing to submit to an enormously increased and really un necessary taxation. In order to 'obtain a clear idea of tho great increase in expenditure during the boom period, it is better to select tlw quin quennium from 1885 to 1890 for a com parison of some of tho items in which a drastic reduction should be made, If we woro to compare tlio present expenditure with that of the nnte- boom poriod tho com parison, although equally striking, would not be as complete, for several reductions, notably in tlio railways, have boon mado since Mr. Gillies with bis ruinous extrava gance was driven from power. Mr. Patter son told us on Tuesday that lie intended to introduce retrenchment in two principal items, viz., retrenchment in the Public Scr-' vice and retrenchment in grants and sub sidies. The following table, giving somo heads of expenditure - which grew with mighty vigor during tho boom and now nood pruning, shown that, if Mr. Patterson is in earnest, he will find an ample field for his knife : — Some Heads of Expenditure, 1834-85 and 1889-90.

Although this incronso is not very largo when compared with l.lio in cronso of population, cortnin itoms can cosily be rcdncod. Tints, in 1884-85 tho refreshment rooms cost £983, hut in 1889-90 tho exponsos of that hranclt of Par liament Honso had advoncod to £2112 j and oxpouscs of momhors of tho Legislative Asnombly ran up from £22,675 to £25,316 liotwoon tho two dates, an Increase of £1129 and £3041 respectively. Titoso aro to a great oxtont personal matters with our legisla tors, and if thoy aro really bont upon retrenchment it would bo well for tliom to bogin as noar homo as possible. Passing to tlio Civil Establishment, wo find that the total oxpensos, which aggregated £117,586 in 1884-85, increasnd to £166,471 in 1889-90, an incronso of £48,915. Tlio principal item of inoreaso undor this head is to bo found in tho olllco of tho Governmont Printer, tlio cost of which increased from £52,739 in 1884-85 to £87,506 in 1889-90, nn increase of £34,767. This enormous incronso in ono department alono cannot ho justifiad upon any plon of an in- crcnso in population or tho husinoss dono liy Parliament. Making all duo allowance for tlio increase in litigation during tho quinquennium, tho increase in judicinl and legal expenses is extravagant. In 1884-85 tlio legal husinoss of tlio country cost £183,297, and in 1889-90 £2431856, an nddition of £60,559. AVlion wo examine tho itoms of this increase we find that the judges' salaries and other exponditure amounted to £8661 moro at tlio latter than at tho earlier date. Although any retrenchment which might interfere with tho proper perform ance of tlioir duties must ho doprecnted, tlio entire, judicial establishment should ho run on a mora economical basis " to suit " the times, " regard always boing had for proper vested interests, yet tlio late Government refused to avail . them- solves of an opportunity to retrench wlion it oflerod. There is no just reason why all these well paid oilicers, many of whom enjoy remarkably long vacations, should not ho asked to work a littlo harder, so that the logal business of tlio country might ho carried on moro cheaply while tlio gsnoral depression lasts. Tlio same remark also applies to tlio Crown Law officers, who in 1889-90 cost £26,600, against £17,483 in 1884-85, an additional burden on tlio country of £9117. Again, tlio Registrar-General and tho Registrar of Titles cost £10,677 and £42,944 respectively in 1889-90, while the two officors togotbor in 1884-85 cost only. £33,881. There are sovcral other dctailod itoms under tho head of judicial and logal which would hear examination, and that the large increase in oxpenso is not satisfac torily explained by the increase of population is shown by tho fact that in ono year, from 1888-89 to 1889-90, there was an increased cost of £26,676 in tho judicial and legal expendi ture. Tho reduction of cxponscs in Public Instruction is a subject to be approached with caution. Free education is tlio policy of tlio colony, hut it was never intended that free education should in clude accomplishments. If we resolve to give instruction in special subjects, such instruction should he provided in other establishments than tlio State schools, and tlio latter should bo made as little of a burden to tiie State as possible. Exactly the opposite policy seems to havo prevailed, and in 1889-90 wo find our State Boliools, exclusivo of tho cost of erection of build ings and of pensions and gratnities, alono costing tho enormous sum of £710,477, against £526,626 in 1884-85. The cost per scholar in average attendance increased from £4 17s. 9J. in 1885 to£55s. lOd. in 1890, whereas an increase in tho numbers ought to bring a decreased nnd not an . increased cost per capita. Such has heon tlio result in New Soutli AVnlos, where tlio cost por scholar has been reduced from £7 3s. lOd. to £4 14s. lid. during tlio period under review. In nddition to this increased expenditure thore was an enormous increase in the annual expendi ture on school buildings in 1889-90. During tiie eight years ending in 1889-90 tlio' annual expenditure on school buildings was tolerably uniform, varying from £62,000 in 1883-84 to £94,000 in 1888-89, hut in 1889-90 it suddenly rose to £236,600. It is unnecessary to do more than rofor to tho expenditure upon railway manago- mont, which increased by considerably moro than £1,000,000 sterling from 1884-85 to 1889-90. In tlio department of mining, howevor, -there seems to ho ngond opportunity for retrenchment. In 1889-90 tlio total expenditure wns £137,291, as against £66,736 in 1884-85, nn increase of £70,555. The item under this bend in which tlio principal increase took place was tlio purchase nnd working of diamond drills and otherwise assisting miners in prospecting operations. In 1884-85 this item was £28,306 j in 1889-90 it had risen to £88,080, or had more than trebled itself. Tho increaso in the expenditure for tho administration and salo of Crown Lands is startling, for whilo tiie expenditure increased from. £73,987 'in 1884-85 to- £97,249 in 1889-90, there was a decrease iii tlio number of acres sold from 423,994 to 249,373, so that tiie exponditure of that re- markablo branch increases iu the inverse ratio of the work done. Mr. 1'atterson states tliap he is fully sonsiblo of tlio eccentricities of tlio Land dcpartinout, and lie certainly cannot find a hotter place to begin retrenchment. Tho increase in the subsidies to municipalities is another nddition to tlio expenditure which, as Mr. Patterson says, requires immediate attention. In 1884-85 tlio amount was £310,000 j in 1889-90 it rose to £450,000. It is of course nn unpopular proceeding to cut down those subsidies, hut their continuance in the present congested state of tho finances is Bimply a. public scandal, and tho Treasurer who wishes to pull us out of the quagmire must have sufficient backbone to ignore all claims of. log-rolling members, whose aims are paro chial and not for the interests of tho colony at largo. If a Treasurer is unable to investigate these items and to select such as will hear pruning, all that can he said is that he fails to fulfil his evident duty. It may bo necessary to increase taxation ; but it should he clearly shown before we resort to sucli means that nn attempt has been made to economise and that any fnrther economy would lmvo a deleterious effect. If wo compare tlio two years 1884-85 and 1889-90, we find that taxation increased from £2 13s. lid. in tlio former to £3 5s. lOd. in the latter, and sinco then it lias heon still further added to. In the latter year wo also find that tlio taxa tion per head of tho population in Victoria was 4s. 4d. higher than in the Australasian colonies as a whole. That Victoria should be taxed more heavily thau the sister colu- A nios in of conrso to her dolrhnont, and addi tional taxation should oven on tills ground alono ho only resorted to in tlio Inst instanco. Mr. Jlaytcr souins to think that if tho land tax were proporly administered tlioro would ho an additional incomo from that source, and lie is probably correct in ills opinion. The great difficulty in any incroasod taxation is to find whore it can ho imposed withont doing somo injury. Now that tlio Imperial Parliament has heon opened, nnd that Mr. Glndstono has laid his political bill nf fnro before tlio country in tlio Queen's Speech, it will not ho long before Rritisli politics aro at a whito lioat. This is simply inevitable, sinco many ele ments that mako for tlio intcusest friction nro sot out in tho Ministerial programmo. Rrilish policy abroad, singular to say, pro vokes no difl'oronco of opinion. As a rulo, Mr. Gladstone's foreign polioy tins heon his feeble point, It lins been ono of "scatter " and scuttlo," and its pusillanimity lins always como in for the Bcatliing comments of tho Tories. But with Lord Koschory in tho Foreign Oliico all this is changed, and . in view of tlio dignilied policy of Grant Britain in Egypt, oven tlio Marquis of Salisbury, speaking in the Homo of Lords on tlio Address in Reply to the royil speech, commondod tho foreign policy of tlio Government. But as soon as wo turn to tlio doinostie affairs of tlio country wo aro, struck with the almost sensational character of tho Gladstoninn programme. Homo Rule, as wnn promised, hUiiiuh first, and it is cer tainly a moasuro that would tax the utmost strength of a strong Government, oven if tlio item stood alono ; hut tlio " old "Parliamentary hand," with much tactical astuteness, lias put a "ono man ono vote" monsure in tlio socmul placo, and follows up this by another proposal that will equally appeal to tlio Liberal instinct all through jjlio kingdom — a measure to reduco tho Septennial Parliament to a quinquennial torin. Tho Soptcnnial Act lias beep always regardod by tlio Lihornlism of England as very mucli'of a fraud com mitted on tlio people. Tlio condition of tlio Rritisli farmor is not overlooked in tlio Queen's Speech. His sad plight is acknowledged on every hand ,to ho such as calls for lcgiBlativo relief. Tlioro aro also two otlior measures cimc'eivcd in a Liberal direction. Ono is a stringoftt Bill for giving public opinion a greater control ovor tlio liquor traffic, and tho otlior is drawn in - tlio interests of Trades Unionism, further minimising tho provisions of the law of conspiracy in labor disputes, and strengthening hoards of conciliation. Thore is a good doni of gonaralsllip in the formulation of this programme. Tlio pro- carious position of Home Rule is notorious. Tlio Premier is never sure of his tiny majority from day to day. Tlio 40 votes by which Mr. Gladstono turned out tlio Tory Govornmont aro -safe enough, doubt less, on tlio ordinary points of doctrine in a Liberal creed ; but thoy are skittish on tlio question of Homo Kttlo, and over ready to bolt. For example, Mr. Stead will not hoar of any diminution of tlio Irish veto in tlio IIouso of Commons, wliilo Mr. Lahou- clicre denounces any proposal to retain tlio Irish momhors at Westminster after tho establishment of an, Irish Parliament in College Green. Mr, . Gladstone lias found this ono of tho cruxes -of his ' seliomo. Another point- scarcoly less difficult -is settling as to what shall ho tlio Irish share of tlio Imperial taxation. At present Ireland pays ono-twolftli of tlio total Imperial taxation, .wliilo she lias almost one-sixth of the representation. Mr. Gladstone's schema iB said to contemplate lotting down tlio Irish liability under Homo Rulo to ouc-flftoontli. But this lias , boon found to be a greater responsibility , than a homo ruled Ireland is willing to undertake, , and tlio veteran Premier is reported to lmvo modified his proposal to imposing on Ireland ono-eightcenth of tho Imperial taxation. Thore will be difficulty in this. Ireland lias about ono-eighth of tlio popu lation of Great Britain, and to lot jono- eighth- of the people get oft with one- eighteenth of tlio public liability is a proposal that will lmvo to run tliu gantlob of severe criticism. It is considerations such as these which lmvo mado so standi a Liberal ns Sir Edward Reid, tlio member for Cardiff, shy off into a "Cave of " Adullam," and tempt Mr. W. Ratlihono to follow him. These "Cavo" pcoplo arc stout followers of , Mr. Gladstone on ordinary matters of policy, hut on this Homo Rulo question they cannot see all the way with their loader. Thoy would like to sottlo tlio question by some largo extension of local government, after tlio pattern of tho County Councils of England ; hut tlio questions involved in a perfectly autono mous Ireland frighten them. The fact is that from causes of this kind Mr. Gladstono does not know to-day whether he has or lias not a majority in tlio Honso of Commons. Never was a lender in a groat crisis more uncertain of tlio forces which ho can command. Of course, ns a mat-tor of tactics, both sides talk in. confident terms. Mr. Glndstono professes to feel oortain tlmt his Homo Rule will cement tlio Liberal party, and not disintegrate it. Tho Marquis ot Ripon, looking beyond tlio Commons, when the Bill shall have reached tlio Lords, snyB tlio Govornmont is determined not to allow tlio House of Lords to defeat tho moasuro ; and when men open tlioir eyes and inquire how an evenly divided House of Commons can presume to compel the Peers to accept such a Homo Rule schema on the first tiino of asking, we aro told by the loaders of tlio " Liberal Federation " that " the llousa of Lords will ho abolished " if it dares to reject the Gladstone Homo " Rule Bill." Menaces of this sort count for nothing oxcept to indicate tlio electrical condition of tlio political atmosphere in tlio United Kingdom. In tho meantime Ulster is orating and protesting, and tho Unionists in Dublin, under tlio guidanco of Lord Aslihourno, are declaring tlioir ontiro confidence that the Bill will novor got through tlio Commons. This it is which makes even the' friendly critics of tlio Governmont doubt whothor tlio "Liberal Ministry will bo able to hold office till the end of April. Mr. Gladstone lias a smallor relative majority in tho House of Commons than Mr. Patterson has in the Victorian Assembly, whilo ho 1ms to deal with party, questions of a gravity unknown in our politics. At any rato, tho British Parliament has opened a programme of vast issues, and with most uncertain forces. But for the foot that history teaches that tlio best of national work has of ton heon dono by weak Governments and not by strong ones, tho political studont would say tlmt tlio present House of Commons lias nothing hoforo it but a short and Btorniy life, aud then a dissolution. But of all prophets the political sootlisayor lays himself opon to tlio most ridicule. To him it is always safe advico, "Don't prophesy " unless yon know." Tlioro is ono tiling, hosvevor which it needs no ghost to como from tlio grave to tell us, and this is tlmt the groat national controversies which an old man of 82 is loading tho liorco demo cracy nf Groat Britain to solve, oven wliilo tlicy stir human passion and lasli mon into acrimony and bitterness, will not ho without tlioir solid compensations. Ono of tlio dangers of Democracy is tlio over growth of potty localism which it engenders, But tlio contemplation of groat questions such as thoso which tho British olactor is now called upon to deal with has au educational and elevating olfhct in killing for tho timo parish pump politics nnd Littlo Podlington cries. Groat Britain is now fnco to faco with questions of vast magnitude. Slio may deal with llioin or shelve thorn ; hut wlintovor slio 'loos can ho donu only after groat struggles, with nil tlio world looking on, spootators of the conflict.
