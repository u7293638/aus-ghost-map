LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) LONDON, June 30. London once more! London, 89 in the shade, is entertaining, but not pleasant. What a tu- mult. What seeming chaos, but most admirable order. What heaps and crowds of people. What traffic—omnibuses and carriages, cabs and carts, huge four-horse drays and railway vans; rattling, jingling, electric cycles; grumbling, hissing, buz- zing motor cabs and cars, hideous to look on, and worse to listen to. What forests of hotels. What thousands of workmen— bricklayers and plasterers, and road-makers and menders, and painters. What clouds of dust. What tap-tap- tapping of bricks and smoothing of mortar. What a smell of paint. London is being, as our ’Murican cousins says, “made over.” * * * * London that is not being pulled up is being torn down. All round where I reside — Russell Square, Bedford Square, Bedford Place, Blooms- bury Square— are like ancient beauties— restored, stuccoed, painted, padded, tricked out, and looking, as the Sultan picturesquely observed when auctioneering off his harem (no reserve), “nearly as good as new. * * * * London is full of surprises, and sensations, and revelations — respectable directors, fa- thers of families, and deacons in their churches in the docks, sensational divorces. Dreyfus’ arrival — all eyes turned to the sea waiting for the “Sfax,” that does not come. How will the exile of Devil’s Island look? Some say he is dead. Some say he’s mad. Some say the prisoner is already ashore and interned. Nobody knows. Meanwhile Mme. Dreyfus sits up in her tower at Rennes, which commands a view of the prison precincts. * * * * London lies under the blaze of a big brazen copper-colored sun, sweltering in a heat that is torrid, except when you turn the corner, then a sharp and piercing east wind strikes between the shoulders; but how lovely to be stricken. Everybody straightens up and gasps great big gasps— refreshing gasps—the dogs panting on the side walk loll out their parching tongues, and touching their muzzles draw back hurriedly — the wires are hot. * * * * * But there’s always two sides to the question. Just now we have a full moon, tropical in its brilliancy and luxuriance. The enclosures of Russell and Bedford Squares are green and shady, with leaves that shine — now opalescent, now white — and move with gentle murmur in a summery shifting breeze that creeps cool and ca- ressing over the faces of those happy ones bles- sed with a key to these ancient private and ex- clusive pleasaunces. Tall trees and myrtles, thick with the twitterings of sleepy sparrows, beds of sweet smelling flowers, and well trim- med lawns, odorous from their evening drink. Soft is the mignonette-scented air, and the far- away moan of the city — like the far- away moan of the sea— accentuates the stillness. “Oh lovely night in June.” And memory turning back, I am once more beneath the shadow of the South- ern Cross, and the memories! — well, are happy ones. * * * * * Oh, before I forget, one no longer says “He’s off his chump.” The inner circle remark, “He’s off his burner.” * * * * * Ascot was over before I arrived. Tod Sloan is getting himself disliked— is finding the going a bit too heavy. His recent luck has not been of the extreme kind of the heretofore, and an “inci- dent” (that’s what it is called) has marred these later days of fortune’s favored one. * * * * * On the third day of the Ascot meeting Tod had the choice of two mounts— Miaco and Bettyfield. He chose Miaco, and, dreadful to relate, Bettyfield (ridden by Reiff), a recently-arrived and trans- planted pigmy, riding 4st. won. * * * * After the race Tod and some kindred spirits were drinking champagne at the Royal Ascot Ho- tel, when a waiter, carrying a large tray laden with drinks, in pushing his way through the crowd, jogged Tod’s elbow, and spilt the great one’s wine, whereupon Tod, seizing the cham- pagne bottle, struck the awkward one across the face, cutting deeply, and knocking out three of his teeth. * * * * The battered and bleeding one was taken to the hospital. No proceedings— no police inquiry. “The incident” is being kept very dark; but it’s there all the same. * * * * Great disgust at the general arrangements of Ascot, particularly over the Royal enclosure — where the company, it seems, was more than commonly mixed: Everybody knows H.R.H. is the broadest-minded of men; but you can’t take liberties with him. While escorting through the enclosure the most recently smiled-upon young aristocratic beauty, a lady who had stupidly boas- ted of the Prince drinking tea with her (circum- stances not stated) bent low before his Highness, The Prince nodded curtly, and half an hour later the lady was officially informed her ticket would not be available for the following days. * * * * So you see, “A still tongue,” etc., etc, etc. * * * * * Another thing I missed was the Bazaar. The great bazaar at the Albert Hall in aid of Charing Hospital, two days’ fete, amount realis= ed, £15,000. It closed Friday, the day we got in. * * * * * Such a Bazaar. Although not there myself, lots of people I know were. Seems to me to have beeti as nearly as possible “run” by the smart American crowd. Mr. Arthur Paget was the secretary, and her Grace of Marlborough was here; there, and everywhere. She took £400 at her flower stall. There was an American bar, and Royal Princesses sat and sucked iced poems through glorified straws. * * * * A great run on Lord Kitchener’s autographieal photos. There were gold ornaments and feathers from South Africa; curios from the Soudan; trea- sures from Egypt and the far Ind; wonderful sets of chinchilla from the Argentine; feather cloaks and paintings from South America; Spanish lace from the convents of Mexico and Valparaiso; a lot of lovely silver given by the Duke of Saxe Co- burg-Gotha. Mrs. Mackay and Mrs. Ronalds took £600 at the American stall. Lady Randolph Churchill got up a concert; tickets, one guinea. Mrs. Ronalds says she could have sold three times as many. Melba sang for nothing. Mrs. Brown- Potter sold 1000 drinks at one shilling, and her tips brought it up to £120. The Queen sent £250. Princess Louise had a stall. Young la- dies with the bluest blood served the tea with the grace of Geishas. Duchesses were a drug, and absolutely gave change. * * * * * Dramatic entertainments brought in no end of money. Among those appearing were Mr. and Mrs. Beerbohm Tree, Miss Ellen Terry, Mrs. Ken- dal, Sir Henry Irving, Mr. George Alexander, and Mme. Sarah Bernhardt. * * * * Apropos of Sarah. Monday night I went to see the “divine one” in “Hamlet” (last time of per- formance in London). Sarah, as Sarah, was magni- ficent, but I missed “Hamlet.” Her elocution and action were entrancing, and while one did not trouble about “Hamlet,” it was all right — worth walking ten miles to see her; and walking is not my forte. But Shakepere Frenchified — painfully modern in tone, language, and general effect — is trying. The ghost didn’t seem at home, and once cocked his crown over his right eye, with a deli- ciously comic effect. Sarah looked well, but her legs are a bit “off.” Sarah’s husband— M. Magnier — is decidedly good business; beautiful face, splen- did physique. The dresses were bizarre and effec- tive. Nothing like Denmark, though; more like Port Said, and eome of the “extras” had evidently come out of the Soldiers’ Chorus in “Faust.” Sarah herself— the great and unapproachable — had an immense triumph, and 24 calls. This from bete, blase, perfidious Albion is not so bad. * * * * People are trembling at the possible result of presenting “Cyrano de Bergerac” in English. No- body can I think of Irving, or Wilson Barrett, or Beerbohm Tree coming on with a large, false nose without a great and uncontrollable inclination to abnormal mirth; and it is feared the first entrance of the gallant Gascon will settle the whole busi- ness. * * * * A great turn out at Osterley Park last Saturday. Lady Jersey’s second garden party. The little tables in the hall for tea and strawberries were fairly rushed, and the lawns were crowded. Mu- sic by the Blue Hungarian Band. Lady Jersey wore violet (Lady Mary Villiers is to marry the Earl of Longford, you knuw); Duchess of Albany, pale mauve; Mrs. Bradley Martin, in grey, looked remarkably well. Mrs. Bradley Martin, (nobody ever hears of “Mr.” Bradley Martin) has her ups and downs; also the finest house in Fifth Avenue, New York. Her son married a serio-comic sin- ger; her daughter married the Earl of Craven. * * * * The Cravens, collectively, are in a parlous state just now, being mixed up with the sensational Chandos-Pole divorce suit, which has been running to great houses and much hilarity in the Divorce Court. * * * * Honorable Mr. Craven, younger brother of Earl Craven, married Miss Broom, a horsey, hunting lady, always in the first flight, with Chandos-Pole uncommonly close up. Chandos-Pole was a cow- boy for fifteen years, and his language is accordin’. Mrs. Chandos-Pole asserts the intimacy was carried beyond the bounds of propriety. Mr. Craven stands up for his wife like a gallant and chival- rous gentleman, and paralysed the Court by ac- cusing Sir George Lewis of having bought and paid for any evidence against her. * * * * The jury disagreed. The judge discharged them. Oh! we “are” having a time! * * * * The Queen at Aldershot was the great event of Monday. Her Majesty reviewed 14,000 troops. There ought to nave been more, but troops re- turning from foreign service (notably the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers — the famous “Fighting Fifth” were not nearly in strength, because the scarlet kits were not ready to replace the karkee worn abroad. * * * * A great success — wonderful weather— fine troops —immense gathering of people — and no end of military swells. * * * * It is felt the presence of the Queen was a great compliment to Sir Redvers Buller, it being his first big review command. The spectacle was perfect, though some people think the In- fantry played first fiddle in the color scheme, the Cavalry effects suffering to a certain extent from the dark color of the horses. * * * * The multitude stood in the broiling, baking heat from 10 a.m., her Majesty being timed to arrive at 5.45 p.m. A brilliant assemblage await- ed her arrival. The Commander-in-Chief (Lord Wolseley), Field Marshals the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of York wear- ing the uniform of the Suffolk Yeomanry, Gene- ral the Duke of Connaught, Grand Duke Michael of Russia in the uniform of a Cossack of the Im- perial Guard, and any amount of foreign officers and military attaches. * * * * The Queen was in an open carriage, with the Princess Christian and the Duchess of Con- naught. The Prince of Wales reined his horse close to his mother’s side, and took the salute on her Majesty’s behalf. * * * * The “widow” is not supposed to be emotional, but they do say that when the charge came, tre- mendous and magnificent, her eyes were full of tears. * * * * In the first brigade, with the Heavy Cavalry, rode the New South Wales Lancers; and this is what the war correspondent of the “Daily Tele- graph” says: “The troopers bore themselves gal- lantly, and rode past very creditably. Most of the cheering, however, was reserved for the Aus- tralians, who, both then and in the subsequent movements, did uncommonly well — better than some of the regulars.” * * * * * Isn’t it lovely? Advance Australia! My heart beats with yours — your proud, loving fathers and mothers, and sisters, and cousins, and aunts left behind down under. * * * * We had a great thunderstorm Wednesday night, and the N.S.W. boys were washed off the slopes of Pavilion Hill, and had to go into barracks, poor dears. * * * * Have you ever heard of Acciriato? Acciriato attempted the life of King Humbert in ’97. Ac- ciriato has been for two years in a dark cell — no air — food rotten — water full of worms. When up for his trial he appeared an idiot. They wanted him to confess to implicate others; but nothing moved him to their purpose. They woke him up with a letter from his mistress. * * * * During his imprisonment she had borne him a son. Here is the letter: “If you were free how happy we would be! In the morning you would be the first to kiss our son on his pure forehead, and in the evening when you came from work he would run to your knee. On Sunday we would all go to the country. But, on the contrary, we are in mourning and misery— I a widow and he an orphan. Sometimes I am almost crazy to think that I may even lose this jewel of our love, as he is thin and ill, and I have no money for a doctor and medicines.” * * * * The man came back to life— confessed every- thing—implicated everybody. Then they ex- plained they had caught him with a forgery — there was no letter — no son — and the man fell to the floor in convulsions. * * * * La comedie e finita. * * * * I wonder where is situated the particular hell for which these farcical folk have fitted them- selves. * * * * A., a young bachelor, is asked by Mrs. B., a young and charming widow, to join her party of three others for a week-end on the river. A arrives on Friday evening, and finds Mrs. B. alone. He is told by her that the others have wired to say they cannot come until Saturday. What should A. do? * * * * Just got a charming letter from Mrs. Boesen, who is in Copenhagen. She tells me she saw everything in London, and heard that most “ador- able” singer, Jean de Reszke. Well, I unfortu- nately just missed him. He made his adieu last week in “Tristan und Isolde” — a great send off. It was Jean’s night, and he filled it. * * * ** Then there is great disgust at the many dis- appointments this opera season. People pay 30s for a stall to hear a great work and a great artist. The artist is “indisposed” — the opera is chang- ed, and the public has no redress — the ticket expressly stating the directors will not he re- sponsible for any changes. And there you are, don’t you know. * * * * A great meeting of the Jockey Club to consider the merits of the “starting gate.” H.R.H. spoke in favor of it — as did Lord Durham. Mr. Septimus Miller (president of the Victorian Racing Club) explained its use in Australia. It was proposed by Mr. Lowther, and seconded by Lord Cadogan — “That the Stewards be requested to arrange for all races confined to 2-year-olds during the sea- son of 1900 being started by a starting-machine, subject to such regulations and safeguards as they may consider necessary.” The resolution was put and carried unanimous- ly. * * * * Yesterday Flying Fox “walked” away with the “Princess of Wales’s Stakes.” The Princess was not present—she went to the Cat and Dog Show at the Botanic Gardens, and took all sorts of pussies with her, all sorts of dogs. The cats were very lofty, and much dissatisfaction was express- ed by the more mature ones at the frivolities of some of the kittens who flirted shamefully with some of the visitors. * * * * A great show at Newmarket of masculine and feminine beauty and frocks and things. H.R.H. wore a white bowler, with a black band — only two tall hats on the course. No state or fuss. The Prince and the Duke of York drove up from the clubrooms in a hired barouche—lots of other people ditto. Weather tremendously hot, every- body in flannels and panamas. Lily Duchess of Marlborough in peach; Duchess of Devonshire, grey, and a rope of pearls; Duchess of Westmin- ter, cream serge; and lucky “Alan Richardson,” roses in her belt. * * * * Great fun at the Woman’s International Con- gress yesterday. The discussion was “Woman and the Stage.” Mrs. Kendal, Miss Genevieve Ward, Miss Clo. Graves, and others spoke — then a woman got up and said they couldn’t elocute “fer four apples.” She was a professor, and would like ter give them “points.” * * * * Great weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and bad language over the Australian cricket, especially among England’s youngest. My nephew, a public school boy, writes to his mother “We (the boys in my house) thinks Eng- land had better chuck cricket, and take to skittles.” * * * * A fish dinner at Greenwich on Sunday is quite the latest. The Thames is lovely now, and peo- ple talk about pulling salmon out of it before long. Well, large parties of the “naicest” go steamboating to Greenwich to eat fish cooked in twenty different ways. Last Sunday some friends of mine went down, and among the visi- tors were Lord and Lady Edward Churchill and their daughters, entertaining a numerous company. “Punch” is “the” correct thing to drink with a fish dinner. * * * * Talking about summer outings, I went up the river on Sunday to the most delightful place, “The Abbey Estate,” Bourne End (not far from Cookham), a private estate which has been turn- ed into a private riparian, and locked in from the world-village. A number of cottages built in old time fashion; each cottage has a lawn and grounds, and at the foot of the lawn runs a little river, and each house has a bridge, like the wil- low- pattern plate bridge (in the rafters of one a swallow has built her nest), crossing the stream. On the stream lay a lovely punt, polish- ed cedar, red cushions galore, fishing tackle and books, etc. * * * * The cottages are thatched and covered with flowers, all sorts of trees are there; tall, short, and middling. The banks of the stream are co- vered with great nodding grasses, wild flowers of every kind and overhung with weeping wil- lows. The trees are full of birds’ nests — the air is full of birds’ songs — and the water is full of fishes. Dear beautiful ducks quack melodiously, and scrambling up the bank, waddle gracefully to where we are at afternoon tea under a huge red umbrella, and being presently filled with cake and rolled bread and butter, sit down and regard with inquiring interest the feathers of their tails. * * * * My friend’s house is the “Tithe Barn.” The real old barn of ancient times, turned into an ideal summer residence. Black rafters, black cross beams, white walls and diamond paned bed- room windows, (through which creep the scent- ed honeysuckle and radiant and many colored sweet peas. French windows to the drawing- room — couches and rugs and cushions and chairs of every shape, form, and capacity. A cherry or- chard, full of cherries, hedges of Iris and banks of roses, and tents of stray bachelors to camp out. It’s all delightful. Judge Williams has the Abbey, and through the trees we can see flitting about his lawns pretty girls, and in one corner are a company of mamas sipping tea, and a most lovely and serious minded and hobbled donkey is cropping the grass. Such a pic- ture. * * * * The stream encircles the estate like a shining ribbon. We punt under all the little bridges, and presently come out on the Thames, accompanied and inspected by two beautiful swans. Across we go. The punt is low in the water— four of us, no light weights—and we implore our punter to take care of the steam launches. It’s all right, and across we go to the Quarry Hotel, Bourne End. Lots of people; a string band, pretty gardens, plen- ty of gaiety, heaps of people taking lunch. We have a lavish host and a private room; salmon and cucumber, and new potatoes and new peas; cold duck, tender as marrow, and stuffed; cold chicken, forequarter of lamb, all sorts of salads— pickled onions; cherry pie and cream, fresh strawberries out of the garden, and great glass jugs of iced hock cup, with big bunches of burrage floating on top, country butter, country bread, cigarettes, liqueurs— heaven! * * * * There has been this season much, and to a cer- tain extent hot, discussion, but now it is finally settled. “Hock cup” is the “proper” tipple for lunch. * * * * After lunch we try the piano, and sing about all sorts of girls— “Gaiety Girls,” “Circus Girls, “Runaway Girls,” etc., etc., and coon and coster songs, and the band gave if up — just sat on the lawn and listened ; but when we punted away (a regular flotilla) they plucked up heart of grace, and across the water floated the finale to the first act of “The Belle of New York.” * * * * “For she is,” etc., etc. * * * * A fearful flutter in the House of Lords Monday evening. The ladies’ galleries were full — mus- lin and silk rustled loudly, feathers shook disdain- fully, lips curled scornfully, and heads nodded meaningly. Peers rolled up — no end of them; roll- ed up in white duck and flannels, and the festive cummerbund. Every nook was filled. Cabinet Ministers stood on the steps of the throne. Crush- ed diplomatists, sweltering in the heat, did the goose step, much to their distaste. Plenty to sit upon, and nowhere to put it. * * * * The question before the House was “The Lon- don Government Bill,” “Women as Councillors,” “Should women be eligible for the offices of Mayor, Alderwomen, and Councillors.” The Commons said. “Yes.” But in spite of Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour, “My Lords” said “No,” and as to Lord Dunraven, he would have wiped the floor with the aspiring ones. On division, the vote for the ladies was 68, against 182. * * * * The rector’s cook to the rector’s wife: “Please, ma’am, what are we to do with the sole that was saved last night?” * * * * The New Maid: “Well, mum, if yer cawn’t afford to pye me that wages, tell yer what I’ll do — I’ll come for ’alf and hev every uvver day out on me sissycle.” * * * * Sammy: “Will you love me, Kitsie?” Katie: “Oh, but, Sammy, you’re so — er — so — er— plain.“ Sammy: “Let’s turn the gas out then.” ________________________________________ The following resolution was moved by Alder- man Waine and carried at yesterday’s meeting of the City Council — 'That, in accordance with the recommendation of the works committee,, Dow lingsstreet, between , Cleveland-street ana the Reafern boundary, 5»e re- mejalled, at a cost not .'exceeding £130.
