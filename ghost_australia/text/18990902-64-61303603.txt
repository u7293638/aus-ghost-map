KEID CANNOT UNDERSTAND. Speaking to a reporter from one of the daily newspapers, the Premier said he could not understand the change in the leadership of the Opposition ; and yet only a day or two previously he made some remarks which indicated that he. did understand. As a matter of fact, he is cognisant of all the reasons. Mr. Barton, he knew very well, had not the ghost of a chance of carrying a hostile vote against the Government ; and Mr. Barton also knew that. Had there been a chance, it would not have been hinted to him that he ought to resign, and he would not have vacated the position of leader. Messrs. Haynes, Pegan, Fitzpatrick, Cotton, Storey, H. M. Clarke, etc., all Ministerialists in the past, would not have followed Mr. Barton, but they were willing to follow Mr. Lyne. All this Mr. Heid has known for a long time, and consequently his disgust was very great when the fact was announced that Mr. Barton had resigned and Mr. Lyne had been elected in his place. The change made a very serious alteration in the.political situation, so far as it concerned himself. In the forthcoming debate, we may expect to hear him declare with great emphasis that at no time was he the subject of the slightest ignorance respecting the game of the Oppo- sition. . ? ? -
