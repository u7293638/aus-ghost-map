W e presum e m ost of our readers a re acquainted w ith Bulw or L ytton'e g rea t play, and w ith th e historical events w ith which i t so a b ly a n d powerfully d e als.' T he fereat a u th o r waa in able iand*.Ia*ft night; a n d tlie beautiful ana em uoblibg tongnage fotind w orthy voice and action in Mr W aiter Bentley- Of Riche* lieu i t m ay be tru ly said th a t ‘ none b u t him self could be his • p a rallel.' T he character ib complex, and q u ite unique, and in th e bandB o f a novice o r appretitioo ■would b e sacrileged as well ■a s aacrificed. I t also m akes a heavy dem and on -the actor who essays it. M r Bentley looked th e p a rt a s well &a; played it. D oubtless H am let is th is a cto r’s m asterpiece, b u t a fte r th a t wo like him beet as Richelieu. A ll th e subtle craftiness, th e intrignfe, an d th e vanity of th e g re a t Cardinal was prom inently m ade p la in ; a n d due emphasis w as given to th e noble qualities of biB n a tu re a!bo. T h e patriot, whoEQ love, m istress, e n d wife was France, etood o u t in bold relief. T he occasional relapse of a cruel an d remorseless character, into love, g ratitu d e, and deep affection, was also cleverly pourtrayed, u n til tlie prioatiy d ignitary etood revenled to th e audience to th e very life. T he eoliloquies wore m asterfally spoken, a n d e especially w orthy of m ention.” T be character of Richelieu has always been a favorite one with th e tragedians who h ave visited A ustralia, fo r in th e i u - jw rsonation of th e greatest statesm an t h a t Franco ever know, the c ardinal who b u ilt up'tb e pow er of th e French Crown, th ere are opportunities fo r dram atic power which tax th e highest a r t of th e actor. T he period chosen by L ytton w as & storm y one—m onarchy was falling in all directions j Cromwell, in th e height of his triu in p h , was f a s t . overcoming the ffeejilfe resistance, of Charles 1. j a n d , y e t th e weak a n d vacillating L ouis X III. r e ­ tained • his throne, upheld by .the patriotism and craft of th e aged c ardinal. T he h atred, of th o g rea t F rench nobles to Richelieu never slum bered, aud th e “ o ld fo x ” found safety in tb e K ing’s sense of bis ow n helplessness, u n til, yielding to th e iotrigues of hie courtiers, Louis fo r.a brief p e rio d was persuaded in to abandoning tb e M inister to whom he owed bis throne. I t is a t th is critical hour th a t th e d ram atist has depicted Richelieu, show ing him first pow erful and overbearing, m arching onw ard to his goal w ith th e strongest ten ac ity of purpose, unmoved e ith er by fear or pity. Possessed of a n iron will a nd fiery soul, confined within a fra il and feeble fram e, th e cardinal—endowed w ith tb a t m agnetic power peculiar to th e rulers of men—rises su]>erior to tb e intrigues of the court, and with a glorious patriotism devotGB him self to tbo interests of biB country. F rance is bis guiding star, a ll personal am ­ bition is sacrified to secure h e r supremacy, and th e conspiracies of tb e corrupt and traito ro u s c ourtiers are powerless to tu rn him from his purpose. T ho person of U icheliou has been described as a pale apparition, the mere ghost o f a great m an, n e ith er flesh nor blood b u t all intellect, wirh th a t steady anJ penetrating eye and tb a t im perious gesture th a t overawed th e K ing a n d the proudest peers of France. I t is th u s tluit Mr W alter B entley depicts liiui, th e netor’s Cdo personality being completely disguised in tb o fra il a n d to tterlu g figure of the g reat statesm an. Btern aed m asterful iu bis openiDg scenes bo y e t delicately indicates hie affection fo r bis w ard Julie de M ortom ar, and with every movement is tb e wonderful c ardinal tbe saviour of Franco. T he itnjierioua w anner of a man born to rule gives place to th a t of tho affectionate guardian of youth and innocence, th e g reat dignita ry of the greatest Church tb e world has ever seen can, in spite of countless court intrigues, find delight in th e loves of Julio aud D e M auprat, and w ith a judgm ent ofttim es cruel and unm erciful mingle th a t love of country w hich was his d istinguishing characteristic. Tendor iu his passages w ith Julie, ironically huinfToua in his trea tm e n t of Do Maupre'*, and b itte r in liis donunciatiou of his enemies, Mr H entley’s R ichelieu is greatest in the eceuo in which tho cardinal invokes cnod b y the licentious K ing. Casting off for th e moment th e physical weakness of tbo ag ed M inister, Rieboliou. transfigured by th e vehemence o f his passion, is inform nod fea tu re th e em bodim ent of an avenging church, Equally pow erful is th e la st scone, in which Richelieu, risin g superior to bis enemies, produces tb o fata l despatch which sends to tb o block tb e very conspirators who wero plotting his destructiaa.
