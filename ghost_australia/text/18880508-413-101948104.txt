THE history of the Parkes Government up to date might be summed up as that oÂ£ a Government much attempting, and accomplishing nothing. When Sir Henry Parkes took office over 12 months ago the State coach was all but crippled, and going down hill at a rate which threatened general disaster. The task before him was, consequently, one of great difficulty, but he was powerfully supported in the House and enjoyed the sympathy of the entire community, for great things were ex pected of him. The Press was with him-even those journals which had previously opposed him on certain points of policy, gave him a general support, and nothing was wanting in the shape of encouragement to assist him in giving effect to his commission. The nature of that commission everyone knows. It was very similar in every respect to that which Mr. (now Sir John) Hall was elected to carry out for the people of New Zealand in 1880, or that which Sir Harrie Atkinson, the present Premier of Moari Land, has been engaged in quite recently. But here all similarity between the posi tions of the New Zealand and New South Wales leading statesmen ter minates. The Hall Ministry at the period indicated were entrusted with a commission to do the homely work of putting the State House in order, and substituting economy for extravagance in the government of the country, and they were content tosimply do their plain duty. The Parkes Government were returned by the people of this colony to perform a precisely similar work, backed up by a powerful following, and the result of the experiment is too well known to need mentioning. It cannot, strictly speaking, be said that the Government have failed in the work they were elected to perform, for " failure " implies " effort " as a condition precedent, and the Parkes Government have never attempted to keep faith with the people in any single particular. Simple negleot of duty has been their crime, and it has characterised almost every political act of their life since they were re turned to power. They certainly reversed the fiscal policy of their pre decessors in regard to the ad valorem duties, but in all other respects they have betrayed the confidence of the electors; and it is just as well that this should be borne in mind. The finan cial question should have been the first dealt with, but it is still in abey ance, and meanwhile the : Government have been piling up legislation which has not the ghost of a show of being carried within a measurable distance of time, with the result that the affairs of the country are in a worse state of confusion now than ever. Among the measures which the Government were " determined to carry," according to Sir Henry Parkes at Wagga only a few weeks ago, was the ? Local Government Bill, which, it was pointed out, would pave the way to the imposition of a tax upon land, as the extension of Local Government would facilitate the collection of ihe tax. At Bathurst, howover, only a short time after the bombastic utter ances at Wagga, the Premier " backed down" as to the Local Government Bill, admitting, in effect, that his post prandium speech of a week or so before was, for the most part, merely " brag." This sort of nonsense, emanating from one in Sir Henry's position, was suffi ciently bewildering; but, as if de termined not to let thp political comedy in which he is engaged flag at all through lack of novelty and surprising situations, he introduces the Land Tax proposal, independently of the Local I Government question-which has been I coolly; put aside for an indefinite ( period-and before the estimates for j the year have been dealt with. What sense is there in this hopeless piling up of work, while the most important Government business is being neg lected. Is it not childish, and worse, to play fast and loose with the country in this way-to make promises one day and break them the next; to go about the country delivering boastful speeches, and almost immediately afterwardB making abject confession of their impotence ? Is there any thing further needed to demonstrate the utter incapacity of this Government ? Truly the indictment is a heavy one which, sooner or later, they will have to answer before the court of public opinion. Our readers do not require to be informed that we favour the imposition of an equitably distributed ;? land tax, though we doubt the power of the Government to carry it at the j present time without interfering with the interestsof the country in regard to other branches of legislation. But we are now considering the general posi tion of things politically, and it must be confessed that the outlook is any thing .bub -promising.; When the Parkes Ministry first assumed office we were prepared to give them what support we could so long as they kept faith with the people in the work which they were elected to: carry out. We had before that consistently opposed Sir Henry Parkes, but in view of the ex traordinary circumstances under which he was returned to power, and the fact that his Government were charged with a definite mission, and pledged to a certain line of action, which it was hoped they would hone3tly adhere to, we recognised that they were entitled to sympathy so long as they remained faithful to their pledges; and as forcibly as we could we pointed out thafcall party feeling should be sunk to enable the Government to perform their onerous task of adjusting the finances, or as it might be put, of reducing chaos to order. But the. Government have tried the patience of their most ardent suppor ters, as witness the debate of last sitting of the Assembly. They have had ample time and every opportunity allowed them, have achieved next to nothing, and have utterly noglected thechief duty they were charged with, and which should have been held as sacred. They began badly, and have gone from had to worse. They have not even the poor excuse of " obstruction " on the part of the Opposition. True, the Premier has endeavoured to shift the responsi bility on to the other side of the House, but the records of Parliamentary pro ceedings are against him. To make | out a case against the Opposition he must first prove his own bona fides, and that is out of the question. The Government are condemned for not doing their plain duo/, for not giving effect to their pledges ; and the Opposi tion cannot be charged with frustrat ing efforts which have never been made. The complaint of the Opposition is pre cisely the complaint of the country from one end to the other, in this re spect, that the Government are ne glecting legitimate business for the purpose of gaining, as they no doubt fondly imagine, political capital in other directions; and on them alone will rest the responsibility for the pre sent extremely unsatisfactory stale of public business. Oan it be that Sir Henry Parkes is, in the language of the turf, going in for " a final flutter." In one sense the Government perform ance has been a "flutter" throughout, resulting in nothing but confusion. If it has been the Premier's aim to asso ciate his name during the last days of his active political career with certain remarkable Legislative achievements, the time was decidedly in opportune ; and unless he has many years of poli cal life before him, he stands a chance of being chiefly remembered as the man of many mistakes, and the victim; of vaulting ambition. THE first football praotice of the season took place on the racecourse on Saturday. A good number ol players turned up and u scratch mutch was played.

WE (Gundagai Times) understand that a Sydney company has purchased the lca9e of 25 acres at Rrummy's Hill, Gundagai, from Benson and pnrty. This is the lease worked by Katto and party for such a long time, and out of which some splendid gold was obtained. We trust to see" the ground thoroughly worked by the company, as for many years gold has been found at Brummy's Hill, but too hard to get by the individual miner, although no doubt it will return handsome dividends to the company. .
