The Supposed Gunpowder Plot Time flies, but truth marches "with solemn step and slow." It is only now, after three hundred years, that the world is finding out the facts of the infamous Gun powder Plot, though they have been Btated times without number. The Protes tant historian, Fox, declared that "the Popish Plot story must always be considered an indelible disgrace upon the English nation." Macaulay, more recently, vehe mently denounced the infamy of that concoction. Strange fact that, although Titus Oates and others engaged in the conspiracy suffered the penalty of their discovered perjuries, the plot-story continued for centuries to do its appointed work of exciting anti Catholic frenzy! However, among scholarly Protestants, at least, the Gun powder ghost will never stalk again. Mr. Gardiner, the most eminent historian of England after Lord Acton, has been con strained by Father Gerard to acknowledge the injustice done to English Catholics, and to express his profound regret that the infamous plot was ever ascribed to them.â€” ' Ave JJlaria.
