' I reckon they're buried in the garden by row,' and be chuckled at be tLougbt of lbe cruel deed which had robbtd tbe widow of her faithful guardians. They entered the drive.treadiog aoflly oo tbe loose gravel. Suddr-uly G«Qllecnan Jack came to a atand.

Tbey wer* now at the back of tbebuildiug. 8potUr pointed dowo the tfaideu. '* If we've to cut sod run,' be abispered, ' clear off that way.' Turning on a bull'a eye lantern, be allowed a momentary gleam to reel en a window etar his elbow. It revealed a clow array of bars. ** Every blessed winder io resch is the same,' he went on. ' That's why I dido't take on tbe job eingle-haaded. We've got to 0te 'em tbrouxh.' Their well- greaaed files made searoelj suy s»und. In less than half an taour tbe protecting bara were eut through and removed. Witb a broad-bladtd putty knife. Spotter then puahed back the window-eeteb, and lifted the sash. All look off their boots aod entered tbe riooo, a kitchen. Dave closed tbe window oautiouily, and the three crept along tbe tiall to another Isrge room on the gr-Hind floor, where 8potUr first made eure tbat the blinds were closely drawn, then lit tLe go*, one burner, wbieh be turned very low. The dim light enahlt-d them to perceive thst tbe walla were oorered with psintings, but lbe glitter of cellaret trs aod silver urnanieots attisctid them to a sideboard, and i.otbing elre bad any interest. ** Hie dlnin'-room,n whispsred Spotter, w| 0 had not M balmed ' the servant* for nothing.

This dene, Dave fetched a cdlarette and gl&ssts; from tbe sideboard. j ' 1 rrckoo we're earned a drink,' be uut- 1 tend, grinning. j ' Held 'ard a bit,' Spotter rejoined. ** It's about time tbe copper passed, I know bis best When Ws gene, well take it eesy for 'ell an hearefoceeleeriDg out,' He tnnied tbe light etill lower end listened ? ?tthe, wiedow* -It wm esBeeewiary, The policeoan's tramp eNdd be besTrd -300 yards away.

As bis gale rested upon it bis jaw dropped , he staggered back, still with bis eyes fixed 00 the pietem. An exclamation burst from bis li pa Then, pulling himself to gether, be walked slowly round tbe ruom, steadfastly regarding every portrait 00 tbe walk, while Spotter aud Dave watched hint in amazement, Tbe tear ended, Gentleman Jack confronted his fellow burglars. Hia hps moved, bet he eeemed unable to apeak. 'What's up, Matey P** ask*d Spotter. **You look m if you'd seen a ghost.' ** 1 have/' said Gentleman Jack, with ae \- ffort. ** Spotter — Dave— we got to put sail tbe things back aad get away.' 44 He m gone balmy 00 tbe crumpet,' niot tered Dave, nodding at Spotter. ** I'll seo bim — Bpot tor's blasphemous exprmioo need not be repeated. ** He must 'ave gout* dotty,' he added.
