Victoria, MELBOURNE, Tuesday Afternoon; Richard Johnston, barrister and solicitor of Seymour, was suspended from practice to-day for two years, and ordered to refund Â£43 received by him as a retaining fee as counsel to defend three clients on a charge of horse- stealing. It was shown that he had failed to do so, or to give any explanation of his failure. T. Dean, the rider of Cerberus in the recent Grand National Steeple- chase, was prosecuted to-day in the Flemington Police Court for cruelty to the horse during the race. The Bench held that the horse had not been cruelly treated, and dismissed the case. The Victoria Insurance Company has declared a dividend of 2s. 6d. per share.
