Crushed Again, THE Editor of the Australasian, in an answer to correspondents, is quite unable to see any resemblance to Diokens in the lubrications submitted by an amateur writer. Now, that's juBt the way with those editors. They never can see anything. We never knew an amateur writer whose efforts did not resemble Dickens at his very best. The only wonder is that the world is not flooded with improved Pickwick Papers, and Oliver Twists, [and Dombey and Sons. How is it that writers whose styles bear so marked a resemblance to the great writer of fiction never come to the front ? The reply is because they are crushed by jealous editors who will not give them so much as a ghost of a show.
