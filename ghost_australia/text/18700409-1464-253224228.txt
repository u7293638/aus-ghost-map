(An interval allowed for chopping down gum trees.) Macb. The cry is still they come. Aha, what's that ? Seyton. A-cat-a-squalling, good my lord. Alacb. (wildly). I have almost forgot the taste of prickly pears. I supped last night at Courvoisier's on a dish of 'orrors. Mess. Was't good, my lord ? Alacb. Ha, ha, ha ! 'twas 'orrible, most 'orrible. And by moonlight there appeared to me a nightmare, Much like the Mare of Waterloo — Methinks 'twas him, 'Cos lie could neither read nor write. Mess. What said he ? Alacb. Fear not till Parramatta Woods do come to Waterloo. Mess. There's some'ut moving. 'Tis trees- on, I will swear. Alacb. They come — ring the No. 2 lire-bell.

Blow the drums, beat the trumpets. Give us nobblers all round and stick them up to me. Alacb. (enters). Oh ! I'm cooked like a steak of Phil. M 'Carroll's, Young Siward. What is thy name ? Alacb.

(Re-enter Macbeth and Macduefer). Alacd. 'Alio, Macbeth, 'old 'ard, I want to fight yer. Alacb. Pshaw ! What you, Macduffer ? Why you don't know how. Macd. Don't T though. By this once bejewelled sword, The gift of Wat. Montgomery, now no more — I'll give thee a quietus unless thou shoutest quick. Alacb. (armed with an umbrella). Lay on, Macduffer, And nobblers round that you'll first cry hold hard. (Exeunt fighting ; both re-enter, pause for breath, and re-commence fighting. Macbeth slips. ) Alacb. Ah, I'm down. Alacd. So am I upon you (sticks him through the heart) ; that's not a liver now, but I'll make sure, or he may save his bacon (chops ofiLiis head). Aha! so much for Macbeth ! ! (Dances a hornpipe round the prostrate body. ) N.B. — This scene is generally encored, and Macbeth, by the aid of restoratives in the shape of corpse revivers is induced again to face the terrible Macduefer, amid the brayvos and ancores of the small boys in the gallery. (Flourish of trumpets. Enter Malcolm.) Male. I'm much obleeged to all of you — and to each I hereby give my blessing and a peach. Go— dismiss ! Macduffer, you're an ass. (General scramble for p»eachcs.) All. Reign, Malcolm ! (Enter Manager, breathless. ) Afanager. Don't, please, we've had rain enough, and we've got 4 feet 6 inches of water under the stage, and the water still rising. Save yourselves. Fire, fire ! Exit everybody in a blue funk. This pun was condemned by the 8. M. Herald in next morning's theatrieal notice as being unseemly.
