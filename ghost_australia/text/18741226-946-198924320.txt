T O 0S£ PINTL IE, : A TALK OP The War of Independence. . ? « ? s Chaptbb VII (Continued.) ' Dick, are you there ?'! .: ' Yes, massa,' Raid Dick, who, like Kill, had already ariued himself with an old mnsket. , , . .' Throw down that musket, eir, and UtlkU blllB 11UIU I-U X/1UJLUI1D. SJflVU 1b . tu the old man, or one of the boys, and tell them to muster all the men that they can find at the village. Come back to the house yourself, bar the doors and windows, and .you and Cupid keep the rest quiet until I come back- — ' and away, in a perfect parox-ysni of importance, went Dick after Onpid. The rapid clattering of horses' hoofs along the avenue in stantly followed, nnd as Hailshot buckled on a cavalry sword, . and banded another to Baird, Kill entered to announce the Waggon; ??.'.?' ??'?? ' Lock the hall .door, . and give the key to Simon; and now -for* life and death to the village. It's lucky; Thomas, that the ladies are absent. ? I think if we lose no time at the inn, I. shall be at. the General's in season to anticipate onr ci-devant friend,' Lear. This bold dash ; ? i6 worthy of his spirit, and I 'am 'much ' inclined to think, from some circumstan- ?: ces which have lately come to my know ledge, that, young as: lie; is,- ho-is- in \- command of the boat: which Kill' saw pass np the creek.' , 'I swear to dat, Massa,' said Kill. Him sharp young officer, and he speak in de boat as if he be do 'captain, and nobody else.' : ??'',. ? ' Here we are,'1 said Hailshot, ' a few minntes after, ' and luckily the tavern is full of men. Where is Pierson ?' ' Here, sir,' said mine host, showing his ample person on. the porch,, beneath the door-lamp. ' Mr. Pierson, come into the bar room, if you please. 1 have something to say to the company.' 'Yes, air,' 6«id mine host, showing the way into the low room, where about' twenty men, farmers and fishermen, were seated around small tables, drink ing and amusing themselves with various games. There was a general move among them as the gentlemen entered. ' Attention men !'' said the landlord, ' to Mr. Captain Baird and Mr. Hail shot. Something is out.' The rattling of dice and dominoes ceased, and even the clinking of glasses, as, open-mouthed, the goodly company gazed on Baird, who leaped up on a table, with his sheathed sword in his hand. ' ? ' My men,' said he, ' I have certain news that an English cutter, filled with armed mon, has just passed up the creek, by the herring bridge. I- want you all. to arm yourselves, and meet: Mr. Hail shot in the least possible time. Any ? man who is ready to follow me, must be here in fifteen minutes. Those of you who belong to the troop — I see four or five of my men here — will get to .their saddles and notify -the rest, and be ready to meet me in an hour's time at ?? Scrag town. Be lively, for there is-more work to do below, and little time to lose.' 'Three cheers for Captain Baird/ exclaimed the host. 'Hnrrab, hurrah, hurrah ! I'm with Mr. Hailshot forever.' ' And so are we all,' answered the rest, as Pierson sprang up on his bar, and took down a long single-barrelled gun and its accoutrements. There was a considerable demand for his six stout sons, who all belonged to the troop. They soon appeared, with the exception of the two eldest, who were with the guardboat. With tho promptitude and intelligence of American militia, the thing was understood, and under arrange ments at once. 'You'll find ammunition enough at the grocery,'' said Pierson, and hero in good time comes old Dennis himself. Hurrah, Dennis, your friends are in the creek, and we are mustering to lick 'em. ; . We want powder, arid buckshot, and flint. ' _?: . . ?- ?' Away wid you, thin,' ' said Dennis, . ' if it's powder you want, sure there's enough in the cellar ito blow up the .whole fleet- — and as f«r balJs, I've enough to supply a regiment. Come away to the store,' till I git my own pace-maker. Arrah ! I smelt this spree in the air this morning, so I cleaned up and oiled the piece after breakfast, and, be my sowl, she'll have a voice inthe skirmish.' In less time than Baird had given them, forty-seven men,armed with mus- ' kets and fowling-pieces, had assembled at the inn. Some brief arrangements were made to dispatch expresses over the country, and Hailshot took his rifle from Kill, and marched down the road at a quick-pace, followed by upwards of fifty resolute men. They passed down the road, and over the new bridge, without seeing or hear ing any signs of tho enemy. As they ncared a small shed, where the General kept, his boats, Kill was called to the front. The shed was about four hundred yards distance from the house, and be ing surrounded on one side by several old willow trees, and built at a point where the enemy would be likely to land, Hailshot determined to 'occupj it. A party of ten men, commanded by mine host, was left at this point, with strict orders to report, on tho instant, by a chain of sentries, tho appearance of the enemy. Kill was ordered to remain' with them,; and' his master, with the reBt, proceeded directly to the: mansion houBO. ' ??'??? : Hailshot halted .his party 'under' some trees, and despatching two sen tries to the rear of the house advanced to the door and knocked. The ? door was opened by an ' overseer in the employ of the family, who evinced great surprise at the appearance of Hailshbt. ??-?' -?'??-;=-''? :??;,: .';' Where is General' Grayson'?'' said the latter.'' ????'?--?? ? ??-''???[ ;: '? ? ?'? ?;; ??????? ''He ' isMhot at home ht present, sir,' answered the fellow; ' I believe he 'has gone to- — — . Miss ; Grayson is in the drawing-room, sir,'- ? The man spoke in such evident' alarm that Hailshot's latent suspicions were confirmed. On . being shown up. he found Miss Grayson and- her cousin seated at a table calmly engaged; in reading. At the sight of Hailshot: they both rose in some surprise,' that of the elder being mingled with hauteur,' the younger with confusion. The first was the daughter, and the second the orphan niece, of the General, the same young lady who was the object of so much interest to the lieutenant.' -?' ; ? A few moments ^sufficed to ''explain the state of things.- Both, declined Hailshot's offer to guard them to a place of. safety. . ; 'If Mr. Lear,' said the General's daughter, 'commanded the party, they considered themselves safe in their apartments, and as the General was expected to arrive every moment, they preferred awaiting his presence.' ' Hailshot was confounded. The letter which he had received that night, through the hands of Kill, had crushed at one blow the dearest hopes of his life, and the coldness of his reception, on such an important occasion, seemed to give a terrible import'to every sentence of that fatal epistle.. : In, truth his situation was awkward' in the extreme. He was a newly rejected lover, anticipating and endeavouring to defeat, an enterprise of the enemy, to which- he had reason to believe his mistress; was. a secret party, and upon the1 snecess 'of which1 depended tho chances of, her'' leaving the country forever. From his embarrassment he was, in some measure, relieved by the voice of his chief object of solicitude. '. 'It is not too late, Mr Hailshot, to iavoid thespillihg of blood. Promise me, by our old friendship, that you will parley with Mr Lear and his party should. they arrive, and that you will not at least become the aggressor, and ever command pur gratitude as you have our undivided esteem — no matter what becomes of us. Reflect Mr HaiU shot; that my uncle's life, and the life of many others, hang upon your de termination, not to speak of your own, than which believe me, save those to whom we are bound by blood, none are to us more dear. If you cannot with draw your party, sir, at least promise me that no violence shall be used : until we have spoken to Mr Lear, or the officer commanding the party.' ' Be it as you will, Miss Grayson— at least as far as I have power to con trol the destinies of this night. I have no earthly right now to speak your con fidence,' and as far as my earnest en deavours can prevent no violence shall be committed in this house. The country is up, however, and Mr Lear will find it difficult to secure his retreat unless his force is very strong. For myself I am ready to obey you in any thing — always reserving my duty to my country. If tho General : should ' return before the enemy arrives; per haps ho may suggest somo medium course — though it is useless to attempt to conceal the' fact of his being in timately concerned with this movement. I do not say this to give pain, but in order that we may in somo measure at least, understand each other: If it is your wish,' continued he, advancing a step with something of Miss Grayson's candour, ' to embark on the fi igate, perhaps I can assist you materially to achieve what, I confess, I came hither with tho determination to prevent. The eldest bit her haughty lip, and looked down as if in thought; but Helen, with a trusting smile, placed her small hand in that of Hailehot; 'I have known you longest,'* she said with enchanting grace, ' and I claim the right to know you best. It is, Mr Hailshot — do not interrupt me, Augusta, I know to whom I speak — it is my uncle's wish to leave this land. But, believe me, cold and stern as he is, he is utterly incapable of anything dishonourable. I am his ward, and as such am bound to obey his wisheR as my own-; — but wherever I go, or whatever be my fate, be assured I shall never forget the one fast friend of my youth.' Tears glistened in her dark. eyes. Hailshot stoopod to kiss' the trembling hand, which he would have given worlds to call his for ever. ' ' Be it so,'-' he said. L' I must not leave yon, Helen, to prepare for an event which has been /for., years the secret dread of my life.'j- ;, ; ' But you will see us „' again,' ? said J ?Helen, anxiously. ' You will riot be long gon3 from us ?' jt ' . 'No longer than tho , difficulties of the service I would. render demand;' and bowing low, with, a steady step, he left the apartment. . ;? ? . Chapter YIII. . ? ? , : THE ^ENGAGEMENT. ? . Inthe meantime the cutter was pro ceeding up the creek as fast as the difficulties which she had to encounter would permit. The darkness was 'm-. tense, and in spite of all . their pre cautions the boat grounded on a point, ? and some time i —was 'cdtisumed before she could be made to, float again. At length they reached the bridge where the officer had been directed to look for the spy, on whose guidance the success of the expedition in some measure de pended. The boat pulled close tp the bridge and dropped her grapple in a position where she was most securely concealed from observation. Perfect silence was then commanded, and a sharp look-out was then kept for the signal. Ten minntes had hardly elapsed, before a small, pale light was seen to glimmer over thei'r'heads, and was in a moment followed by two others. The three hung in the wind, while the officer counted fifty, and wore then in 'stantly withdrawn. The grapple was thon weighed, and she pulled, close to the pier, where a-man in an otter skin cap and dark storm- coat was seated on the stones: The Childe was at, his side in a moment. ' Who killed King Rufus?' said, tho : officer, in a stern whisper, his' hand grasping his dirk. , 'Sir Walter Tyrrel, him do man, sir,'' was the prompt reply. V All right,' returned the Childe. in the same guarded tone. ' Tumble in to the boat, and see that .you keep your eyes open, for the night is as dark as — ' '.' His face,' [suggested little Billy Broom. ' Silence, Mr Broom. Give way now men with a will. Coxswain, keep her head more in the stream.' ' All right, Massa Lear,' said the : spy, who was no - other than David's friend Jonas ; ' we git to de boathonse in no time now.' A nod of the head was the only answer, and they proceeded on their way — the black sitting beside the cox swain and directing the course of the boat. In a few minutes, when in the act of rounding a bend of the creek, the heavy dash of oars was heard coming down the stream. 'Run her over on the edge of the reeds on the starboard hand, coxswain,' said the Childe, and steering as close to tho reeds. as the mud would permit, the men lay on their oars at the command of their officers. Profound silence was then preserved until the strange boat passed down the stream. ' Him bo de guard-boat, bound down to Jossey Gill s shantee,' said Jonas. Dere him lie till daylight. Den all hands turn in; ; and . de apple toddy suffer.' i ' Ay !' said the Childe. ' Give way men, arid let us see this same schooner at the General's.'' A short distance further and the spy had the boat brought up on the counter of a schooner of somn size. ' Dis be deGineral's yacht,' soil the negro. She lie just off do door, of him house.' ' Mr Broom, show yonr small body aft here. Be lively, sir. You will take ten men and the marines; and occupy -tho boat ahed at the landing, until you receive further orders. Keep the men close, sir, and on no account lose sight of the negro for an instant. You understand me, sir ?' ' Ay, ay,1' said Billy. ' Tumble up out of the boat, you yachtmen. If . I am attacked, I suppose I can defend my post, Mr Lear ?-* ' Ay, sir, until yon are reinforced. Be liv ly, mon, or these Yankees will wake np, to play us some trick.'' ''They have their nightcaps on to night,' said old Tom Pintle. Never theless, if they wake up, as you say, Mr Lear,' ho continued, as the distant re ports of cannon broke suddenly upon the ears of the party, ' Brother Jonathan isn't going to lose his cattle for nothing. Well, if he wont fight for his beef, he deserves to lose it, hide, tallow, and horns.'1 ' Shove; off, Billy,' said the Childe, ' the, play has begun ; off with you, my boy, or you will be too late for a front seat.'- ? ' Shove off, out oars there for'ard ! Now Jonas,' said Billy, as they got into the stream again, ' look sharp, .my lad, as the grindstone said to the jack knife. The safest place for you my lad, while we eraiso together, is as closo to these barkers in my belt as you can stow yourself; and, as you hear that my name is Broom, remember that I sweep clean.'' , ' I likes young niassa all de betterer fur dat,' said the black, ' and I t'ink him name be Broom, too, for oartain he smell ob de birch.' ' Smell what you please, Jonas,1' said the mid, ' only keep your eye, open,, and show us this same boat-house^'- ' '?' ' Dat it, massa,' replied the negro, standing upon the bow grating, and pointing to the dim outline of trees on the bank. ' Dis be de gut, sir.' ' Sheer to port, coxswain.1' 'Plenty of water, massa, choke np to de landing.' ' Ay, ay,' said Billy, ' I see the shed now. Lie on your oars, men, a minute. All right. In all but two oars. Look out and tend bow there.' The boat touched the steps of the landing, and the negro and a sailor sprung out to make her head fast. ' AH aroung seemed silent and deserted. The six' marines had landed, and the rest of the men were securing their arms, when the sharp bark of a dog was heard from the boat-house, and a 6mall black terrier flew furiously at Billy. 'Down in the boat, men,' exclaimed the officer, as his ear caught the click of gun- locks. ' Down all of you !'' His voice was drowned in a volley of musketry, which, from its proximity did some execution. Four of the mar ines fell, either killed or mortally wounded, the negro was shot dead, and of that landed not one was untouched, save the officer. The midshipman, though a mere boy, behaved with admirable courage. With a pistol in one hand and a half pike in the other, he literally foreed the men on shore to a sword's point, and led them directly to the low shed where the Amer icans were bosted. A few yards from the trees which stood near it the party received a second discharge, which, how ever, killed but two men. The rest, led on by their officer, rushed on through the door and wings of the little building, with pike, pistol, and bayonet. The milita gave back in disorder, through the door in the rear, and while crowded together at the threshold, suffered se verely. Half of their party were eithor killed or wounded, and old David cap tured, after a desperate struggle, during which his life was only saved by the interposition of tho midshipman. The pursuit was checked by Billy, who now occupied the post, according to hisorders. Ho was slightly wounded in the arm by a bullet, but haying now encountered the enemy, was as lively as a young grasshopper over his first bumper of dew, 'Dillon and Smith, fun down to tho boat, and bring up the muskets and cartridge-boxes. Jump ! bring that spunky old darkey out, and let me look at him.' ^ Kill was led up with his arms tied behind him. ' I say, my old Trojan,' said Billy, snuffling through his nose, ' how do you call yourself ?' ' David Kill, sir,' I nebber denied my name.' ' I have heard of you, old fellow. Your name has gone abroad among the nations of tho airth. But David, ray old Nimrod, who is at the house there eh?' ' Massa Frank Hailshot and two. hundred rignlars, besides the militia men,' said Kill stoutly.' ' Billy whistled a bar or two of Nancy Dawson sigificantly. ' Jack, hand me my pistols,' said he as he finished. ' Now David, I hear yot are an old' soldier, and I should hato to hurt you. But,' he continued, shut ting down the pan and cocking his pis tol in the old man's face, ' I must have correct intelligence.' Now shell out; as the jack-knife said to the oyster, or it's all up with you.' ' You no scare an old rovolutioner, sir,' said Kill, undauntedly. .' If you no believe me, go up wid your men and see what come of it. I say no more.' At this moment a marine levelled his musket at a form which was dimly seen advancing towards the shed. ' Who comes' there ? Standfast.' ' Belvideres,'' answered a voice, which Billy knew full well. 'Advance, then, Belvideres ! Ah, is that your majesty — I got the first taste, King.' ' ':''-'.: ' Ay,', answered Harold, ' you have the luck of it. Is there many of the men hurt, Billy ?' ' ' Knocked into a cocked hat, ' King,'' answered Billy, heroically, all blown to blazes ! Fifty men at least in atnbuscade at the landing. Nevertheless I obeyed my orders.' , ; ' '. ? ' Has the negro bolted ?''.said Harold — ' the spy I mean.' , ' Ay, he has bolted . the door .of his life. Your ebony friend here did it for him.' /.;, '?-. , . ;, . ' ''It's.-.jus,t like ^hirii,' said' .Lear. 'Here, you, Green,' cut iooso the pris oner's lashings. David, my old friend, keep close to me.. Mr Broom, draw your men off to the boat. Away, there, second cutter. Down to the boat with ye, and wait for your officer. 1 'What's in the wind now ?' said the younger midshipman anxiously. ' I fear our friends are faring badly below,1' said the other in the same key. ' The whole country is astir, and the firing has been very heavy. Billy, I shall place the General and , his family in the yacht schooner, with as many men as I can spare, and you must get'under weigh immediately. Set old Tom Pintle on.'.- the jib-boom, and as the ebb has already began to make, with this wind you will be in the bay in two hours. Then make all sail to the frigate.' ?' Little Helen is ours ! I will hurry up the cakes, and keep a sharp eye on the muffins. But, King, .one word — did you meet your old friend Hailshot up there?' ' Ay, and have made an armistice of two hours with, him, ? on condition that we burn none of the small, craft on the creek. The yacht belongs to the Gen eral, and he is allowed the privilege of conveying his family off to to the frigate in her.' ' I'll give you a word of cawshun, and then I'm off, as .the crow said when he smelt the powder. Keep your eye on Hailshotl' and!off he went to the boat. ' Now Kill,' said the young officer kindly, thrusting a handful of gold into David's palm, 'run up to the house my man, and hurry off the party. Heave ahead there, you Belvideres.' 'Ay, ay, sir;' answered Tom Pintle. . In a few moments tho General, with two ladies under his arm, escorted by Hailshot and old David, who had man aged to arm himself again, made their appearance. They wero immediately joined by, Lear, and the party proceeded to the schooner, Hailshot's men occupyT ing the mansion in tho meantime. When they reached the spot, and all was ready for them to embark, Lear , formally in troduced Billy Broom to tho General and tho ladies. He then turned away, while Hailshot made his adieus, took his watch from his fob and , placed it in David's hands — - 'Give this to your /master, David, from me,' he said and turning round on his heel, was'instantly lost in the dark ness. , ? David started at tti&riclily; enamwlled repeater fora momentjartd then looking . after the rapidly retn-ati'iig form of the Englishman : ' i\4-y ftr- acioire,'.' said lie' with unwonted ' emi'ltu'si's, ' ' dese'- be none of d« sons of old Cobwallis.1' Then mechanically putting the watch to his ear, he liu/g'-l out his own turnip, ' and was only awoki) fiioraj his - sombre' j reverie by the sweet voice tof Hlileii, i-ns1' I she called out from the vussel— ' Good bye, David.-!' ??????? . . Chapter IX.. ., The parting of General Grayaon r and.. Hailshot was still and formal. ' In'. fact, ^here was little time for the ? passage-, of compliments, for Billy Broom, who ,wnsi now- , on- his element,- ,in command of,, a craft,, with the ladies- under charge, , politely informed the- ; General that, wind and tide, waited for- no leaye takingi.
