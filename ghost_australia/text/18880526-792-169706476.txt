A THING OF THE PAST. Air—" Widow Malone." Brave Balfour : Ob, the League is a thing of the past At last; 'Tie its spectre we see flittiuttpast Aghast; for where'er 'twas suppressed Its demise stands confessed, Yes, the Leagne is a thing of the past At last, 'Tie a momory now of the past. Chorut of Cork, Clare, and Connaught men : If oar Iisagae is a thing of the past At last, We have piohed np the gauntlet you oast So fast; We have proved to the world Tfaat the flag 'tis unfurled (And defies—for 'tis nailed to the mast— The blast) Of this Frankenstein thing oi the past. Ennis, Soariff, Milltown, and KUrush Yon ornsh, And free speeoh with the oold steel yon hash Nor blush; At Maoroom and Kantnrk, And lioaghrea the same work Has gone on against things of the past Thick massed, Against freize- ooated ghosts of the past. Thus yonr latest perversion of troth Uncouth, Down yonr throat has been rammed without rath, In sooth; And the National League Despite foroe or intrigue Will flourish with influenoe vast At last, of the past.
