'gentleman had to face to s something the very 'nest 'door to "a tt beggarly array of empty benches.' There dect were THIRTY- SE-on persons in the body of e the hall-just itirty-seven members of the, the human family-not one more or one to less. Twenty-three of these appeared in 114 Spantaloons, and fourteen in petticoats. The cam number included two little boys and three Sep r little girls. And this was the audience as- sm sembled to hear the big gun-the great brat SsrTTERB l e RAM pounding at the Education reas Act. But the platform-what about the pcrf I platform ? Was not the lecturer well sup ported upon the platform ? Was not his a r worship the Mayor in the chair Were not e Sthe City Councillor there,, at least the the emajority of them? .Wero not the local. Pt' magistrates and the ex-councillors present n a 1 All these questions can be answered in. the d onegative. The mayor was conspicuous by of I his absence-and even the ghost of a city ofi Souncillor, or the shadowof a local Justice the f othe Peace was not to be seen. Four rei r gentlemen-no more, no less-occupied the con platform-the chairman, the lecturer, an abi elderly gentleman with a white waistcoat was at one end of the platform, and another the, elderly gentlemen of the same stamp, minus Chi Ii awhito waistcoat, at the opposite end, just has I. enough, and only enough to move, to. a c second, and to "put" the usual stereotyped Sh 'V "cordial vote of thanks to the lecturer." t e The chairman was undoubtedly aman of the- nt o right sort, one of the "goodiest" of, the sidi t " goody- goody-goody "'class. An unctuous, oily, stel ie self-elected saint, every inch of him. The wit a gentleman in the white waistcoat lookbed F r exactly like a well-to-do ilition of Gold- pa smith's Village Schoolmaster, "A man he c r Swas, severe and stern to. view." Although rea it not given to betting,. I would not mind not :h wagering a dozen of cigars that. the old me Id gentleman in question once filled the position d of a village pedagogue. The gentleman we a without the white waistcoat wa something Ce I less severe and stern, and a trifle more at is unctuous in appearance. It may seewm H strange, but it is nevertheless true, that no 81 person in the body of the hall appearedto to i know either the chairman or the mover and aal seconder of the " inevitable s vote of thanks. PI I asked the question, "Who is the gentle- cec maio'in'thte. chaoi." The, ans?r as, " I don't know him." I asked again, and ot c- the came answer. Like Miase Mehitable Ire Cartright in "' Ten Nightsin a Bar-room," H K I kept repeating, "I wonder what's his Gi Sname," but all to no purpose. It was the IIe same case with the two elderly gentlemen- rei NT nobody appeared to knwi either of them. u SThe lecturer comhenced, and for nearly two f a 'mortal hours he pounded away at the Edu l- 'cation Act, but the poundig was at h picaninny " pop-gun " practice, and nothing Lct more.
