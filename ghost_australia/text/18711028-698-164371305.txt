PATENT CHARMS. Mk. John G. Saxe has -written some rhymes in which he thus describes a Saratoga belle :— Hark to tLe music of her borrowed tone ; Observe the blush, that purchase makes her own ; See the eweet smile that sheds its burning rays, False as the bosom where her diamonds blaze. Thereupon, another writer says : Good enough, what there is of it, but he might have continued the inventory thus : — Ancn the changes of the walk reveal The patent instep and the patent heel ; TTia *in4-n»«4. «tn«4in.« **?t...t«l 4li« -£a«-v« Jlirrtm^^ xuu jmwuu £muioi auuuu iuq iviuj VLiviut7, The patent arch supports a patent spine ; Lends matchlesB symmetry and etyliBh gait, And bears the label ' Patent— 68 ; ' Behold the plaintive glance of languid eyes ; The pencilled lashes nutters as she sighs * And lifts her crayon eyebrows in surprise. She shakes her head— four pecks of vagrant hair Fly like a hop-yard in the August air ; And twenty grim ghosts whiBper her aside, ' Dear sylph ! we wore that wig before we died.' To whom responded unabashed the beauty, ' Git out, you spooks ! I guess I know my jutey \ ' The garish gas her patent charms revealing, Her bosom heaves with cotton batting feeling, Her false teeth gnash with gutta-percha ire ; Her false eyes flash with fabricated fire ; She drops her patent chignon in a chair, Then jumps to pick it up — But I forbear.
