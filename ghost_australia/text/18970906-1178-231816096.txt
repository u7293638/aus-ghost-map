SOME ANTI-FEDERAL SPOOKS. Jealous Fears. i ! Financial Fancies. Is it possiblo for tho Fodoral Convontion to ap point a'oliapluin ? Tho fodoral eauso just now re quires a chaplain fully ordainod and iustallod, anil fit, in wlmtover olso ho might fail, to lay ghosts. A full half-dozon conjured up spooks, goblins, ghosts lurk mid hover about tlio Fodoration road just now, and their offoot is -n'mrvaUoui in sear ing timid pooplo back. First amongst those is tlio ghost horn of jealous it.au, a hobgobljn tills who appears with a torriblo tail, . who so ragos about tho wliolo fiold of viow of the timid folk lis' to begot in them a condition similar td'tliat of tho wiso man from York. Ho lost all power of spoooh through absolute rlread that if lie opened his month. lie would bo "had." In ovory nvohub this ghost appears.

Why should nvo smile conlont at tliat monaco of leagued obstruction ? For tho good and sufficient reason tlmt we can trust Australia, tlio Australia which is to bo, to overcome it. And why sliouid wo bo utterly derisive at tlio monaco of tho monstrous blaok man?

Tlioy do not ospouso the ghost fear, tlioy aro doomed to it, and if tlio Great Word of itself does not deliver thorn it is to bo feared tlmt tlio ehapluin, if ap pointed, would preach on it in vain. There is nnotlier ghost of a 'mean, subtle typo, who upp'ears insionifioant and mean in evon an exaggerated foreaast of tho future. The spook-raisers point to it, and say, boliold yourself, your colony, your Stato. Tims you will dwindle, to tliat you will bu reduced when tho Federal gamo is played through. But how, awl why, and wliorofor ? Explain to us tho processes, ioxpound for us the reasonings. Wo say that this Ighosp also eludes our grasp, anil vanishes from our kiarnost viow.

Ho is undoubtedly the ugliest, the most substantial and difficult of all, anil for tho reason that ho grows out of a perverted idea vory generally hold, whioli is that a fedoral legislature once created will constantly sock to usurp tlio rights and absorb tho rcvonuos of fodo- . rated States, A disposition to trust tlmt Legisla ture us it must bo trusted is vory rarely evinced, oven'by our leaders. Yot why should it -not be trusted ?

How strange is it to turn back now to "tho pages of history which record the events of times somewhat like our own to read in all that is printed tlio story of Canadian 'fodoration (and owing to tho closed doors of Canada's convontion meetings there is vory little of it, and tliat at second-hand) how anti-federalists and prudontialists argued, and warned, and supposed, and wore defeated tlioro oven as here.

And has tliat powor been evor abused, or has its oxarciso been evor opposed to the host interest of tho nation, or oppression in its operations on any undividunl Stato ?

ICxcopt, and horo iu the origin of yet anotliorof our own ghosts, in connection witli ; -. SURPLUSES. Ain'oriea, owing to accumulation of revonues, tho ' result of a strong protectionist polioy, bod for years surpluses whioli burdened her Treasury, and at a curtain puriod in hor history something like a tid'o of uorniptioii sot iu in comioclioii wit h tlio dis tribution of those surpluses.

It ia corruption umlduhtudly, ami in a permanent ami not easily cui'iibla form. And bceuuso of the surplus caina tlio corruption. . Is it so.iudood ?

Tho "crcato a surplus und -breed corruption" argument docs not very well' stand the test of facts. Ami tlio small, aniiiially-rauurring surplus witli which miller any proposed arrangement our Fodural Legislature is likoly to be cumbered is surely too cuntuinpliblo a quantity to bo feared in tliat way, Can we not trust them so far ? If uo it must bo that we ourselves are miserably en dowed witli the very FACULTY OF OONFIPENCIE, of trust.

A little story illustrates this well chough, A physician resolved to - establish a- hospital for consumptive patients on tlio moun tains, and . as usual tlio crltiu intruded,. Tho physioian was perfectly satisfied as to tlio wrilfaro of his patients ami tliu security of tho population generally. Tho critic had liis doubts.
