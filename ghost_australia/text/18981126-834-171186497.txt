Capture of a ' Ghost.' m â€” Perth, Thursday. Considerable alarm was experienced by timid residents of Connington, near Perth, at the fre quent -appearance of a conventionally attired ghost. Lately a number of residents waylaid the apparition, who surrendered on being bailed up by a revolver. The costume consisted of a sheet, with a eyelet holes, and decorated with red paint and other elaboration. The resi dents decided not to hand him over to the police but to administer a sound thrashing with a paling. This was accordingly done and the ghost set a liberty.
