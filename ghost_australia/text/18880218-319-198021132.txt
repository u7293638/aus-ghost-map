There had been a rathe' serers drought for II months, and when we ware ai ozr last extremity for water I asked ihedoctsr cf He tribe when we were going to get "wiH«."(raiu). His reply was ; "By and; bye. Me put in "gibber" (stone) long a- creek, direcHr come up plenty wal- Iem" Oa fee third day rain did come, and it wis something to be remembered. The Uira Creek, a large tributary .of He Darling, apoa which Ha Backingar head station, which I r-nrri -d, was ataatei, and which had been perfectly dry its entire length, was by fee morn ing running a banker. When I reached home feat night, which X V»1 some diSzralty in dang, the plains being kzee deep in water, we bad cot a drr thing in the boose; fee ehingles' had shrunk so dcricg the hot. dry weather that fee rain came through them everywhere ; oor bedding was drenched, and everything we hid in oar trunks and cores was wet too. Now, feme mystic ceremonies oi saying incantations otpj a stone and depositing it in a dried up waterhcle mart have had some spirit nil mean ing? Was He stone or 7 ; gibber," as the blacks call it, sa oziring to she water spirit ? What a grand opportunity the bush missionaries last in rests long part — that is, Hose among them Hat were possessed oi sufecient intelligence to collect materials far preserving He orig-inal enstams and observances at the blacks, instead o! making mischief, which many oi Hem did, between them and the owners of stations ; and who more capable of tracing ia Heir sepulchral and oHcr rites He symptoms of a religions belie: than in educated churehman?. I have no; seen oc heard oi a single work . upon He aborigines by any of He. cloth. The oppor- tunity has been lost, and it is now too late to investigate, owing to the total disappearance cf the old men who were He depositories of their ancient tribal custom! and superstitions. The young generation of fee aborigine! are like the young whites, and care not for the past o its traditions.
