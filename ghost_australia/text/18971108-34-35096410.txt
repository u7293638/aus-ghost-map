I can raise a better song any day of the week in Melbourne ; and Five jet to learn that Sydney is willing to take a back seat to Melbourne. (Cheers.) Now, then, you up in the top shelf there—(laughter)— unions the gods, why don't you sing. If you don' l, I won't tell you what's id aide- these papers." (Cries of "Oh.") It was Com mandant Booth who spoke, His auditors ? were Salvationists, drawn from the city and I ail tho suburbs around (writes the Sydney i Dai! : f THe>rruvK of October 27.) They crowded j the Centenary Hnll from the Roor lite-; lolly to the ceiling. I'bero was scarcely' standing room in either of the galleries, j Everybody was more or less excited, and tho I enthusiasm which was engendered knew no: bounds. Tbemeetiag had beeucalledto heartho , official results of the self-denial etfort declared. The totals had been kept a profound secret. £yen tha officers were not takes into confi dence, tod expectancy was written on every Ivor. The officers ol the leading corps and divisions, as well as of the colonies, had invoked a keen spirit of rivalry by challenging each sthiT to head the polL f mutually at 8 o'clock a whistle sounded. Everybody seemed to know thu signal and rose to his or her feet It announced the advent of tho Commandant and Mrs. Booth, who were greeted with deafening cheers, musical honors, and the waving of bandker ehiets. They were preceded on to the platform by seren officers dressed in white duck amis, with ascarletsasb, showing in larsewhite letters across tbeir breasts tha names of the seven colo nies of Australasia, I'heir appearance caused a niiiddensatioo. Colonel Peart tVictoria), Colonel Kit ill, and Mrs. Estili also occupied prominent beata. Colonel Peart opened tbe proceedings by announcing a hymn entitled " -March on," which ho declared to bo "tho grandest song in tha book." Major Braham followed with prayer, until he was interrupted by tha com mandant, who, with his concertina, commenced a. pretty refrain. " I heard ot a Saviour whose love was so great." Tlien Colonel J&tiil; prayed. He thanked God for "the totals which tho Commandant was going to announce," and lor the partial restoration to health of Mrs. Booth. " Now, what's the matter with you Sydney people," shouted the Commandant, as he took charge of the meeting. *" Yon seeta so be on pins and needles." (Laughter.) Then be went on to say that he reckoned the Sydney aoldiers were honored in being the brat to hear tha territorial totals announced. Xh<?e things were usually dono at the headquarters in Melbourne. For that night the head quarters were in Sydney, as he had the conceit to believe that tbe headquarters ol the Salvation Army in Australasia were under his bat. (laughter and cheers.) As the constituted director of tbe Army in Aus tralasia and tbe representative of their beloved General —(cheers) —he was there to give the record of tbe latest la.tt]<j fought for God and humanity under tbe Southern Cross, lie <iid so with mingled feelings of wonder and praise. lie was not a novice in tbe Array. Euro in its ranks he had been privileged to be a participator in soice of it 3 brightest achieve ments. (Cheers.) He rose tv speak, there fore, not as the scribes did merely, but as one with some degree of authority. Somt> people did not know the secret \of the power of the Salvation Army. Next tv [ God and tbe Holy Ghost, it lay in the fact that the Armyjhad gonejback to tbe creed of the Founder of Christianity, The cress wan their attraction. ("Hallelujah," "Glory," and cries of "Fire a> volley.") Self-<]cnial week represented not merely the principle of grasp and cadge, a3 some of their enemies said. It represented the principle oz self-denial. The movement bad been started in England come 19 or It years ago, whoa the Army had little but its wits acd devotion to depend upon. It beean in * small way, and the result the first year waa about £2,000. Last year the total throughout the worid was not far short of £60,000— (applause) —of which Australia bad con tributed 17,000 sovereigns. Woe to them if they had not done as well this year. (Laughter and cheers.) The amount of toil put into tbe effort this year had been enough to make the angels shout for joy. Some oftbe wom<m hail been at it whta aalecp—(laughter)—and very mnch at it when awake. (Cheers.) It was the hardest cross in tha world In ba a beggar—to go round from door to door like the raR and bones man—(laughter)— and to push and push; for God knew it took an awful lot oi push to squeeze a threepenny bit out of some people. (Laughter.) Ona girl, under exceptional circumstances, had collected £4 Km. " God bless the girl.' If it ; hadn't been wicked he would have liked to 'kiss her when site told him—(laughter)—but since he bad been married bis wife claimed all the kisses he could coin. (Great laughter and Mrs. Booth, "Don't enlarge on tbe subject.") Ha knew the character of the Army soldiers in England, Canada, Africa, and on the Continent of Europe; but for devotion, forgoing at it without being pressed, for going at it with a shout, and sticking to it with glorious enthusiasm, he had never met the like of the Salvationists in Australasia— (deafening cheers}—and, added the Comman dant, with a significant nod, " I've told tbe General so in this week's dispatches." In fac e? | he bad told him to make haste and get tbrougb his work on the other side, and coma out to Australia and sea tho real Salvationist. (Great cheering.)
