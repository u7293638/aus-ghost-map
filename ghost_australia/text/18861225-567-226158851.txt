SINGULAR INCIDENTS. Twp remarkable .-and wonderful cases of recovery from bnllet-wounds have lately token place in the metropolis of London. In one case, that of a girl wiio was shot by Jier low, the buuet is deeply imbedded in the head, too deep to admit of any operation ; yet the patient has been discharged from the hospital convalescent. The other wiba was one of attempted suicide, the sufferer having shot himself in the head with a revolver. In ihis case, too, tbe ballet is still in the brain, and in such -a position as to prevent the operation of extraction. In spite of this the patient has been discharged from hospital care, and it is said that he suffers no inconvenience from the con- sequences of his rash act. A curious coincidence in connection with these cases is that both shots were fired on the same day, the 19th of June, and that both cases were treated at the London Hospital. 'The times have been, says Shakespeare, ' that, when the brains were out tbe man would die. Tbe poet puts these words into the mouth of Macbeth, when that wicked king sees the ghost of Banquo rise before him. In the cases just cited, we have a reality which no poet could equal in romance. Feeple walking about in the flesh with bullets in their brains are certainly far more wonderful things than spectres. These marvellous recoveries from what, a few years ago, would have meant certain death, must be credited to surgical skill and the modem antiseptic method of treating wounds.
