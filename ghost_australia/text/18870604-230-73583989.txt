At Half past the Elevenith Hour. A QUEENSLAND STORY. SCHAPTER I. " Go to the window, Julian; the doctor is so. I.~ng of coming to-day." ' : Dear me, Leta, you're, quite well no ;; I'm sure you don't need to watch for the doc :or's visits that way." "But my head is so tired, and it always does me good to see him." 'Well, seeing all he does is to look in your face, and take your hand so and say, ' How is my little patient this morning?' I don't see what good he does you. " When are you coming riding again with me, Leta? I've a new horse that would not shy at a circus band." Julian's voice was soft and' guttural,;-" as if," as some one says, "he brought every word to the tip of his tongue, tasted it, and liked the flavor." Julian's voice was always soft to Leta. " Oh, it's so hot, and my head is so tired," and the beautiful head fell back wearily among the cushions. A clatter of horses' feet. The fair head lifted just a little.- A question, and the raised voice of a servant in reply. The eyes that Julian was gazing into turned towards the door. A clang of spurred heels-a quick, light step. Leta raised herself and held out both her hands. Julian bit his thick lips and muttered something inaudible. "Good morning, Dr.; Elliot, and -you'vr been so long of coming; and my head' is so tired-and it is so hot." " My little girl, the fever is over now,, and the poor head must soon be better. Did you slee last night, Leta?" r. Elliot bent forward to look into e brown eyes, and then he glanced ip.' "Do you intend to sit through. my pro fessional visit, Julian ?" Julian's soft guttural voice 7was perfectly placid in reply. "Dear me, no. Good-bye, Leta. I'll come to take you riding to-morrow, remember."?. i. "Yes, yes, I remember," and Leta smiled after him. The professional part of the visit, though perhaps not quite so brief as Julian's description, was soon over. As Dr. Elliot leaned forward to shake up the cushions, something slid from the lounge and fell to the floor., In an instant Leta started up, the color surging brightly over her neck and face. "Oh, Dr. Elliot, please don't look at it." But her wish was disregarded. He lifted it gently and set it on his knee-a doll. "Oh, Miss Leta Brandon-you-you aged nearly sixteen-you whom a fond mother be lieves now able to take your place in society." The glance that Leta gave him was one of such piteous, bewildered, sweet entreaty that he held the stiff thing out to her and laughed no more. "When I. come back from England, Leta, you.will be quite a grown-up young lady poor dolly will be in the dust-bin then." Leta gave her favorite a guilty hug. " Oh, Dr. Elliot, how long do you mean to stay ?" "Well, Leta, I suppose I shall be away. for about a year.. ""A year-a whole year ! Oh, dear me, what will I do, and what will your children do with out you, Dr. Elliot?" 'Dr. Elliot shaded his bright eyes' for a mo ment with his hand. - S ' Well, Leta;. my. children.don't see much of me as it is, and they are as ,well taken care of now as they ever .can be-without their mother." "" S"Yes," said Leta softly-2iany allusion to Dr. Elliot's dead wife she felt was beyond the pale of her young sympathie's-so she only added vaguely, "You will :miss the babies they are so sweet." "Now, my -little .girl," 'said Dr. Elliot, drawing his chair nearer and looking straight into her face, "I have something to say to you before I go., Leta, my dear, although you held your doll in your arms all day long, it would not prevent your growing up-you can't lielp it, and as you grow up you will find some toys even more amusing than dolls." . "Toys ?" said Leta, vaguely. . "Playthings, Leta; there.wasone of them, here half an hour ago." . " Dogs ?" said Leta, but .she colored, as she spoke. "No, Leta.; men I'meant.; Now, takecare, my little girl, which of them you. choose, to play with. The Carabets, for.instance, ' are they so very nice?" , SJulian is." ":talk others, and looksat me. M... "Julian is so kind. ?When he was in Syd ney I was so dull ;' and nowt he is nicer than ever. Our house is so 'quiet. , Ella has head aches all day long, and she is always lecturing me, and mother is always ill too; anid I hiate to talk either to my father or George-they are so horrid." "Hush, Leta; you must not talk that way." "But they are, and Julian is the only per-, son that amuses me. He rides with me,:and sits and talks with me f6r hours; and he's not so very ugly as they say." : "Ugly--uni ?' ' Dr. Elliot stroked' lhis shapely chin and smiled. ,:?" Well, his move ments are like a cat---and cats are. generally supposed to be graceful-still, Leta, I'rd advise you don't mistake lago for iOthello .in this metance." ::"Desdemona, Dr. Elliot ?", , "The gentle lady married to the Moor," Sanid Dr.Elliot had to shake the purple cushions. .'and hide his laughter. ;:: " A Moor I" said Leta, indinantly. 'He's no -more a Moor than you ar.e yourself, Dr-. " I:am an Englishman, Miss Leta.'I didnot know there was any closeconnection between :-th~i races." ??' He isn't :so.very dark,'and man Queens. land natives ar?ethe same.", m Qe - ens "Well, he would be the be tter of so'de 'of your fairness, 'Leta.' Now,; 'ny child, 'good b ; you will remember what I said." About Desdemona?" . " No, not exactly ; but remember that too if' you like. Good-bye--good bye, Leta.. I will not see you again till you are quite ~gown up, Leta; so you will kiss me good-bye ?" Leta smiled, laid her arm across his shoulder, and raised her sweet lips to his. Dr. Elliot went thoughtfully .along to the verandah to make his farewells to the family. A young man leant against one of the pillars talking with the ladies. As Dr. Elliot came up o-he turned away. He was slight,' graceful, supple, easy in every moment, and yet like Julican Carabet. " .. .. --. "Most interesting young man,"remarked the "Very," said Dr. Elliot following him with his eyes. -" Quitereformed, I believe," said the, sister. " . "I believe so," '"B ut he wants Julian's simplicity and steadi nessi,' added the friend. "He does." D-. D. Ellioj out short the indefinite good-byes 'and long messages to English friends, ' As h??e rode away.he just glanced behind him once at t?he long, flat-roofed house, half shaded by trees, A long holiday was before him-a cheerful, wished-for change of scene-a return to his own country-and Dr. Elliot was intensely patriotic, and yet he felt somehow as if he left a treasure behind him there. CHAPTER II.. :.: - A year afterwards the same whit~e sk,.un changed as if he had been gone but for a day. The same heavenly clearness of s k, ht sun shine and vivid colors. " :' As Dr. Elliot drew his horse tosthe sid.e to let a rush of traffic pass down the street, another rider also stopped-Ewart Carabet . When the greetings were over- ': ' "Tell me the latest news, Carabet,','saidDr. Elliot. "I am wearying to hear some. I have heard no Brisbane gossip for six' i'ionths 'at least." "There will be, no latest news till Wednes Why, what happens then ;?" , : The other. reined back his horse, and'there was a pause before he replied. : . i: ;: "' Oh, our youngbeauty's niarriage, of course, \- "onu mean Miss Blane." ..?"-. . "No. I mean Leta Brandon.: Julian.has fallen on his feet once againi; yodi ie-got all our unele's money--as rich as anythinig lniow- Brandon mare as sweet on him as possible. He's all that's respectable now- quite reformed, the. people say." "I believe them." "Well, good morning. See you soon again." ""Oh, Desdemona !" says Dr. Elliot, riding slowly up the sunny street. "We congratulate you, Dr. Elliot," says the mother, smiling languidly. " So ' you have a wife in England," says the: sister who had tried and failed..: "When are we to see her?" asks the-friend. "I don'tunderstand you; madam.": . "Your marriage, Dr. Elliot." "My marriage ?". - . " Yes, it was Julian who told me," says the mother. "He showed it in a newvspaper,"' says the. sister. "He showed us the paper.' says the friend. .. My brother was married.-in ,April--proba bly Mr. Caraibet mistotk the name." "Oh! that must have been the mi-take. I remember that the newspaper was slightly tori-- thefirst naiiie was no? there," says' the mother. . " He said he had not seen the name," says the friend.' '! The less said about uch a mistake the bettr ; but I suppose I: must receive the con gratulations of the whole town-I can't escape that: But'I came here to congratulate. your .daughter, Mirs. BrAndon: I suppose she's in the honse-may I go in and find her as I used todo?" :'A'-heap of 'white fl.ounces, twvo 'little hainds wrung close togetlwer;'?, beautiful golden head biint low on the sill-of 'tlie widow. . " Leta !" ' .. "' Oh, 'Dr. Elliot is it ireally yit"' ? " I have come back again, you see: How tall: you have grown. ; Miss Brandon,; you have grown quite out of my acquaintance. , (Good Heavens, how lovely !)" ' I hopse--I .hope that may never be, Dr. Elliot. '.. "?Well,lif'I had delayed my coming for two days I doubt if I would- have recognised "my little patient in Mrs. Julian Carabet. ;(Mercy What a fool -I have been.) ' "'I hope Ishall always' be the same to you,' Dr. Elliot." ". Now I must congratulate, you. I trust. you will be very, very happy, Leta." ' Thank you, Dr. Elliot. (A sob:)... S"Julian a very ardent lover?" '(A shiver.) "Yes-very." (A pause.) -' Dr. Elliot, when are y,'u goiiig to bring your wife to see mie ?' ",My wife, Leta-I have noine-ITwill never' marry-now.,: ," ' . :" ' \- "But I saw it in the newspapers-Julian told me."

"Leta; Julian Carabet is a soulless brute; his very glance defiles you. I'd rather see you :in your" shroud thanl in a bridal dress for him.: They call his brother' Edward 'the' worst man in the town, but Julian is ten times, worse than he.., "Dr. Elliot,' I adi going to marry him".

Leta, Leta, darling, you're not anigry .". SHe'bent down towards her. Then she slowly turned her golden head, raised her fice and looked straight into his eyes. SThe burning words died dumb uponshis lips. His passionate, imploring eyes fell. He stood- there sileint befoire that straight, searching gaze.. SHad there been love, honor, or purit$y in the man's soul then it:would have answered, but there' was none;. ... :: . - ::: She drew-the ring off her finger and laid itI down.

The rider was hot and angry. He cuirsed the servants at the door as he flung them.the reins and turnied iiito the house. S"Been to see your bride, Julian? ' - S'" Yes." . "Very charmiiing?"' - "Curse her !"' "Julian,. are you mad, or drunk, or what now?" ". "If Iam--look there I'" and he flung some thing on the.table. ,- .. , .

"Little devil!" : ' ' SEdward lifted' the ring and slippedit up and down his brown finger smiling. - S"Perhaps she met Dr. Elliot--he's come home, you know.

Don't let your angry passions-" "Oh, if I had her in my power, if only for a day, I----" . Edward bent lightly and laid a hand like iron on his shoulder. " Say one word--ju one work more-- you ilying:coward,'thatyoiv3;are, andrdI will thrash you witliin'an inch of yourlife' tth'iat fair naiim is too white for ybur lips, you brite !" - " Fair name, indeed !to jilt me in ithat way, two days before her marriage. Fair name, in deed ! ... ... .. .. . ..... ...... ..... Edward took two paces across the room, and then faced round suddenly.. "Look here. Julian. I loved that'girl morb than you ever loved anything in all your sel fish life. But I honored her too much ever to dare to aiskher to marry a man-who-had'lived' a life like mine.:. I never said a word to her. I scarcely dared to touchl her hands-thefwere so 'whvliite-and you-=you soulless, black-heart ed, lying sinner that you are--you thought she would 'marry you. As sdon believe you might enter heaven." "Are'youdone?"',. ?. : "Yes. " " Well then, get away-I don't want you. An hour afterwardsthe gaudy trifipiig of a Frenich opera air was sounding through the open windows. .Julian was teachiiig the green parrots to Biut that evening Dr. Elliot rode up, to the; Shouse 'and 'had a long, interview with young, ' "Did you: horse-whip him ?" asks; the kind brother, smiling, at the door. ' "I did iiot find itnecessary," was the reply, and Dr.,Elliot rode away. CHAPTEIR. III. " Leta looks like a ghost this morning, Dr. Elliot., I'm afraid she willbe ill. Will you go and see her"?" said the unsuspicious, agitated mother. ' She is taking her conduct to heart, I: am. glad to see," said the sister. "You will find her alone in the 'drawing room," said the friend. ".Well, Leta, things look very black this morning.
