GHAPTER V. -'?? '????' ??'??' A NEW YORK BELLE. Meanwhile all our efforts to obtain in formation in regard to the fate or where ? '?'. abouts of the missing girl had so far proved utterly futile. Even the advertisements inserted : by Mrs. Daniels ..had pro duced no effect; and frustrated, in my scheme, I began to despair, when the ac : counts of that same Mrs. Daniels' strange and unaccountable behaviour during these daysof suspense, which came to me through Fanny (the. pretty housemaid at iMr.. Blake's whose acquaintance.!, had lately taken to cultivating), aroused once more ' my dormant, energies,- and led me to ask myself tif rthe afiair was quite as hopeless as itrseemed. . 'If she was a ghost,' was her final ex pression on the subject, ' she couldn't go perambulating this house more, than she does; It seems as if she couldn't keep still a minute, Upstairs and down; upstairs and down, till we were most, wild, ,And.,so white as she is, and so trembling.' Why, her hands shake so all .the time, she never dares lift a dish; ;6fi the table.' And then the way she hangs about Mr. Blake's door when he's at home ! She never goes in, that's the oddest part of it, but walks up and down before it, wringing her hands and talking to herself just like a mad woman. Why, I have seen her almost put her hand on the knob twice in an after noon perhaps, then draw back as if she was afraid it would burn her ; and if by any chance the door opened and Mr. Blake . came out, you ought to have seen how she run, What it all means I don't know, but I havej| my imaginings, and if she isn't . crazy, why ' &c.; &c.; In case of facts like these I felt, it would be purq Insanity to despair. Let there be but a mystery, though it involved a man of the', position^ of Mr. Blake, and 1 I was safe. My only* apprehension had been that. the whole afiair- would dissolve itself . into anlordinary elopement' or some such commonplace matter. -. . ? To be continued.
