SALE OF AUTOGRIAPIIS. AT a recent sale of autographs hold at tile Hotel Drouot, Paris, some very curious and interesting letters and other documents were knocked down to the highest bidders. The collection contained two letters from Henri IV. to Gabriello d'Estr6s. One is dated 1598, and it was sold for 50Cf. It com mences with the words, "My heart," and closes with "I kiss you one hundred thousand times." The king sneaks of hawking and fishing, and of the pike and carp which he has in view for "Fontenebelleau." In the second letter, which is much shorter, he sends 1,000,000 kisses. This fetched 260f. A letter from Louis Phlllippe to the Princess Mario Am6lie, dated 1826, describing a jour ney from Paris to Eu, was sold for 118f, a less sum by 82f. than was obtained for a letter from Prince Louis Napoleon to his father. It was writen in Spoleto in 1833, and gives some account of/the Revolutionary movement which he and his brothers were then trying to bring about in Italy. Prince Louis assures his "cher papa" that if the ghost of his great uncle could see him and his brother, it would be very pleased with them. The elder Prince died three weeks after these words were written, and the Re volutionary movement, as is well known, was a complete failure. A letter from Voltaire to Thierot fetched 9Sf., and one from the Marquis de Crhqui, written during the Re volutionary period and prudently signed "Citoyenne veuve Cr6bui," was knocked down at 62f.; and one from Capeul, the singer, was found to be worth 20f.
