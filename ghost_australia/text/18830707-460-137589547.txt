CHESS. answers to correspondents. A. L. S." (St. Amaud)—The laws of chess as laid down in the German " Hondbuch" were adopted by the committee of the International Tournament. We will (fire them as soon as we can find spaoe. G. P." (Albert-park)—The road to success in chess, as in most other difficult things, lies through failure. You here nothing to be ashamed of. Correct solu tions of 893 and 899. East Melbourne."—Thanks for the games, one of which shall appear next week. '• F. W. M." (A1 bert-park)—You hare not succeeded with No. 901. If White for his third move play Q to Q Kt so. Black can take the Queen with his Pawn, double check! In chess notation etch side is reckoned separately ; Black's Q S b White's Q 7, White's K B 4 is Black's K B 6, Ac. Benoe the mores you give for Black as Q 3, K 4, Q B 2, should have been Q fl» E 5, and Q B 7. " J.M.T." (Lyndhurst)—Correct solution of 898, very fine problem—beutiful variations (9), and of £99— one of the best two-movers I have seen (10). P **<"» P will not solve 900. Black takes the Book. We are gratified to learn that the problems have afforded you so tuuch pleasure. "R.H." (Findon, S.A.)—Correct solutions of 898— cleverly constructed and variations very pretty— and of 899. ,rX k." (Dembquin)—Very injudicious of you to defy Mr. Massou, or " the shade of Stamina," or any other baleful object. We speak without personal experience; but we can well imagine that defying a ghost mutt be an awkward procedure when one is entirely in the wrong—as you are. If in 894 Black play 1 P takes B, White takes the Kt P with Queen, and thai the Bishop with the Knight, mate. In the variation where White plays B takes Kt (ch) for his second more, mate is given, if Black capture the Bishop, by Kt takes K P, double check. " H.J.B." (Hamilton)—The two departments are not under the same management. Address the Editor, and mark your letter " Whist." '• Jolunont."—You will perceive that if White play Q to Kt sq in 901, Black simply captures with Awn. " J. F." (Warmambool)—II in 902 you play 1 P to K 3 Black answers K to K 5. Where, then, is the mate? In 90S you do not state which Book is to be moved. " 7359" (Echucs).—In 902 Blade defeats your solution by interposing the Kt at K 7 when White discovers check. Your solution of 903 is scarcely intelligible. Neither White Knight can play to B 8. White can, however, check at B 6, in which case Black takes Kt with Pawn and escapes. " F. P. H." (Chines)—The first move in 893 is not B to K 5, but K to K 4. A little further exatninstion win show that Hade is mated next move, day what be will If you check with Knight, Black plays K to K S, and if, as you suggest, the attack is con tinued, by B to R 6 (ch), Black delays the mate by interposing the Knight. Mate in three is no solu tion ; it must be given in two. In 900 the Rook on K B 5 is White, u you begin with Kt to B 6, Black simply captures the piece. The Book in 902 b also what it appears to be. If 1 B to Kt 2 (chl Black does not move the King; he interposes first the Knight and then the Awn. As to 90S, your de scription of the moves to wrong. Black cannot play E to Q fl nor K to Q 3 in reply to Kt to B 6 (ch). He takes the Knight with Pawn and escapes. Problem No. 900, by W. A Bohner.—Additional solu tions by "F. W. Miscamble" (Albert-park); "T. ^B.^SMdridge^Beta;" "K. W." (Get-long) ; Problem No. 901, by G. Chocholaus.—Additional solutions by "AC. T." (Fitxroy), remarkably fine three-mover- and "R. A C." (Hotham), some thing decidedly novel. This problem embodies a «new idea, a* for as such a thing b possible in chess. It deserves a high award. Problem No. 902, by T. D. Clarke.—Correct solutions by "P. R. 1L"'(Emerald-hill), fair(8); "R. AT." i), pretty, as usual with tbh this (8); "H. "J." B."' (Hamilton), 9; "R. AC? (HotfaamX elegant (9); and "AC. T." (Fitzroy), an excellent two-mover (9). Problem No. 90S, by J. Thuroby.—Correct solutions by "H. J. B." (Hamilton), 9; "T. C." (BalUntl difficult for a two-mover (10); "P.B.M."(14ner»ld hfll), very deceptive (9); and "JR. A C." (HothamX troubieaome to solve.
