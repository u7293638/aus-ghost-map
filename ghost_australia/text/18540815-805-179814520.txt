THE CABINET. THE FULNESS OF CHRIST. Come unto me, saith your Redeemer, and all your maladies shall be remedied, all your necessities shall be supplied, What though you have committed numberless sins ? I offer to you unlimited pardon. What though tlio law of God, which you havo violated, the law to which you can render no satisfaction, denounces its curno upon your head? Fear not, I have turned the curse from you ; I have borne it myself in your behalf; I have fulfilled tho law ; I have made an atone ment. What though you arc immersed in weakness and corruption ; unable to think any good of yourself; unable to will or to do ; unablo to discover tho method of pleas ing God ; unable to continue ia tho path of righteousness were you placed in it ? In ■your weakness my strength shall bo made manifest and peifectod. Your corruption I will cleanse in the fountain I have opened for uncleanness and sin. By tho Holy Ghost the Comforter, whoso iufiuenca is at my disposal. I will enlighten your under standing, arid renewy-pur heart. From mo you shall learn the will of my Father ; you shall havo grace, whereby you shall serve him acceptably. What though you are surrounded by present evils ? All power is mino in heaven and in earth. My peace 1 give unto you. All things shall work toge ther for good to you in the end, I lead you to a world where there shall bo neither pain, nor sorrow, nor death. Your light afflic tions which are but for a moment shall work for you a far moro exceeding and eternal Weight of glory.— Gisborne.
