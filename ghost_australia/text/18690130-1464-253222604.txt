THE REFUSAL! As sung by the Hon. J—s M—rt—n, in his new and successful imper- sonation of the "Contumacious witness." I never will peach, boy, no matter how loud The fierce angry clamours of hatred may be; I'll ne'er break the faith to my 'Enery vowed, His terrible secret is quite safe with me. Whatever the quarrels that we've had together— Whatever the words which at parting we had— I'll stick to Hal, for we're birds of a feather; I never will split on that downy old lad! D'ye think I'm a cove as would thus blow the gaff? Or let Robertson's mob get scent of our schemes? Pshaw! Bobby be off now! no more o' your chaff! Jemmy Martin is not such a cad as he seems! No, no; they may talk of their ghosts and their plots, They may bother their heads till their brainpans burst, No finker of mine shall unravel these knots; Macleay and his peelers may e'en do their worst! [Tears up his summons, jams his hat over his eyes, wraps himself up in his own thoughts, and retires into the obscurity of private life.] Name by which the Kiama Mystery is to be Known in Future Ages.—The Frightful Ass-ass-ination.
