Coleman & May, apiarists, of Mount Barker, ordered ten Ligurian queen bees from Mr. Alley, a well-known beemaster of Wenbam, Massachusetts (U.S.A,). They were dispatched per packet post by the Californian mail steamer, being enclosed in pieces of comb containing many other Ligurian bees. On their arrival at Auckland the packets •were opened and examined, and it was found that only three of the queens were alive. They -were taken out, and, after three weeks' spell in hives at that city, they were redispatchea. When the parcel was delivered at Mount Barker it was found that only one still survived. Fortunately she is strong and healthy. It was not expected that the whole of the ttn royalties wou.^ £;et safely through their voyage, but a return of five or six out of the ten was anticipated. Messrs. Coleman and May sent to the United States for the queens because the Americans take more painB than the Italians over the breeding of the Ligurians, and as a consequence they are better and more reliable workers."
