FORGOTTEN SYDNEY. By an Undeveloped Fogy Now and then the disappearance of one or other of the few remaining relics of old Sydney reminds us of what the city used to be, and recalls the figures of well known men once about its streets. It would seem absurd to talk of the antiquity of old Sydney or the reminiscences and associations it calls up where it not that a good deal of history has managed in one way or another to crowd itself into its records. Costumes and manners, both of men and women, have changed much since those streets first began to take shape, and the "old colonial days " seem as far off to us as they do to the modern resident of New England. Marsden and good old Governor Macquarie are as ancient memories in their own way to us as Cotton Mather and Governor Endicott are to them; and it is only now and then when a familiar landmark is romoved that we remember how very modern we are after all. These sage reflections, for instance, are sug- gested by the removal of the Dog and Duck Hotel in George street-on the rise from Brickfield-hill, to be precise. The comparative lack of interest in that old landmark is evidence in itself, if any were needed, how completely the generation that took a personal interest in these things is dis- appearing. The " Dog and Duck " suggests by its very name as much as by its associations those old fashioned old country hostelries of which we had a few examples in this colony dating from the earlier days. But then the " Dog and Duck " was to old Sydney just what the the associations with that old type of inn would imply. As long back as sixty six years ago, and for many a long year after, it was nothing more or less than the last or home stage of the Hanslow coaches that formed the medium of travellers' communication between the metropolis and what was known of the in- terior-not of the colony alone, be it remarked, but of the continent. The older settled districts of Parramatta, Campbelltown, Liverpool,Windsor, and places even furthur afield - where the cyclist now whirls his lightsome way on a sunny afternoon - disgorged their by no means teeming population into Sydney by these coaches, literally through the doorways of the old " Dog and Duck". Hairy bushman, teamsters of full- flavoured speech, and country residents of all callings made it their home in those days, long before and after the gold dis- covery, and in times when the predatory bush- ranger made the journey as adventurous as the old highwaymen made Hounslow Heath not so very many years before. An incident like this acts old wits jogging and old memories wandering. How many such places have not the few remaining old "inhabitants," as the govermnont proclamations still call them, seen shorn away during the past 10 years or there- abouts? Every new city improvement at one time meant the disappearance of one or more such landmarks. It is not so long since the mysterious Bluebeard Tower, a little further up the hill, went its way into the Ewigkeit with its cargo of half told stories and hazy suspicions. It was of this won- der provoking edifice that old-timers told gaping listeners weird stories of how in the days before the opening of the Divorce Court a husband with crude views on the subject of domestic discipline shut up his wife in solitary confinement for a number of years, that always seemed to vary with the mood of the storyteller and the credi- bility of his audience. Sometimes, in more tragic humour, the old timer-the raoe always had an incurable propensity for yarning-would garnish his recital with anceodotes of imaginary hangings that took place from the corners of Bluebeard's Tower. But there was always an element of re- serve about this, as though the story teller, for his temerity, ran a risk of being summarily sus- pended from that ominous pile himself. But the Tower is gone now, as the " Dog and Duck " is now going , and it was time, for soon there will be no more old-timers left to weave harrowing or gossipy yarns about either. When the teams and coaches came to the " Dog and Duck " - and who knows what plans of early colonisation, of gold seeking adventure, of bushranging enter- prise even were concocted and talked over in those old rooms? - when the horn first sounded at those doors George-street was a winding bullock-track as you still ses it depicted on old maps, whence the " brickfielders " in all their pristine vigour swept over the city in dry weather, and when the rain fell, as it sometimes did rain in thos days, though it seems to have forgotten the way now, the bullock teams were bogged in the fairway of what is now Sydney' s main artery of traffic, and it took many bullocks and much objurgation to get them out again. One might have read in the papers the other day how an octogenrian Sun- downer, whose colonial experience dated as far back as 1838, was found in a starving condition in the bush somewhere about Springwood, and succoured and sent on his nearly-completed tramp again. If we could catch a few such types as that before they die out by bush roadsides, what stories they might tell us of the strange old days when the " Dog and Duck " was in its prime. Sometimes, it is true, we get a sheaf of recollec tions and impressions of forgotton Sydney bound up in such a form as the recentyj-published Hartley reminiscences,when the peculiar flavour of the old day s seems to waft itself out of the post and revivfy it for a moment again-like that odour of the gums and the sea, the pines and the figtree, which blew for him across the Domain and Mrs Macquarie's Chair, he says, just as it did in 1832 and 1832, " when the demons (r) now dead were alive and breathed it gladly and freely as we do now " That was written only the other day, as it were, and airead) tlio wnter hies gotio to join tho mon and women who mado tho past with bun It is from suth sources that we got tho lifelike touches that tell us of a socioty through which mon moved in cooked bats, bluo coats, and cp lulcts, or plum coloured swallow-tails ann nankttn lights, and tho hdios ovon in tins Sydnoy of our»-how atrango it sooms '-" dressed as to li air and tontottr like Mnhbran," and wrought havoo in high waists, short skirts, elaborate sandals, and long gloves There is an old print of tho first St Philip's Church which shows some moving figures so attired, and brings back at the same time another old Sydney) landmark, while at a much later date prints of the old Post Office, and even of cricket matches in the " sixties," reproduce costumes now almost for- gotten And thesu old times were the braio da) s -wero they not?-boforo and wl 1I0 diggers " got gold b) the pint nnd quart," when Mel- bourne was n depressing little v ill-go, when tho w lid Howers grew close np to where tho Post Ofiico tower now stands, when lish wtre still to bo f 1 eely caught m Sydnoy Harbour, when wind- mills orowned tho eastern hill that closed 111 tlio old town, when Oathenno Hayes sang at the old Victoria Ihcatro later on, and so back to tho tuno when "Sydney was« coiinlnfito placo in 1832, and jon would havo missed 7o percent of the present tdifiotd " Butthtj wero also tho days, as this fino old " reiininscencor " reminds us, lihou men and women w oro aliv 0 with hair not ) et groy, uud still m their golden primo m the earl) "forties," who halo now only n namo lil tho cometones, as ha Buys, 'or on old deed-boxes on lawyors' shelves, or 111 trust accounts, or per chanco whoro some street or square of tho Sydney w 0 know embalms their names and memory for elf Thoso who know Sydnoy woll eau tell long stones of landmarks going and gone, but thoso who know all tho anecdotes belonging to thom aro fow Thoy can talk to you of n time when Barrack-street was really tho neighbour of a barrack- yard that saw strango. scenes in tho old days, including that tragedy of Sudds and Thom- son we find mentioned in tlio old records, of a timo when that building at tho corner of George street ond Charlotto-plaoe, oirrying tho name " R Towns and Oo " on its front, was tho centro of tho marítimo enterprise that hail its headquarter« m this port, of dsys when valuable oity blocks changed hands for tho proverbial song ; of nu era when the old building noxt the Wentworth Club Hotel echoed to tho hoof-heats of tho gold escort reining up there, and of tlio still moro distant opooh whon Dr Lang's Sr-otoh masons built ina old church wlnoh still atands as it left thoso bundor«' hands, a roveroiid relio of old Sydnoj Such peoplo - when you find thom - can tell you of others who told thora of a time whon " tho Rocks" v as a fashionablo quarter, whtn frequont executions lent their mild attrac- ts is to Gallows Hill, and tho pasBOi -b) m Qcorgo strcol often stopped on Monday» to viatch tho grisly spectacle of enramáis going lo attend thoso functions, with thoir coffins bosido thom on a cart I Thoro is tho ovidenoo of tho Gazette news- paper of the d ly for this, but it represent« v. ry old Sydnoy indeed.

Or about that gigantic figtree in front of the Education Office which someone in authority was going to cut down once to make room for some public building or other, had not someone else - Sir John Robertson, was it not ? - it sounds like him - assured the world at large, with a good deal of unnecessary expletive, that he would kill the mau who laid a finger on the tree that had sheltered so many of his happy days. And still talking about trees, how the old Sydneyite will tell you he misses the one that used to grow in Phillip street, or the little grove of them that shaded the open space in front of the old Australian Club! It is a pretty senti- ment that clings to those things, and once gone they are not to be replaced. Of course, the march of progress must go on, and old landmarks must be swept out of the way, like that quaint old relic of the past that once did duty as the Bank of New South Wales, then on the east side of George-street, - a dark, low, and dismal building, ono of its old clerks describes it, with a dingy grass plot in front of it, and a manager always in white cravat and dress-suit. That was in the " fifties "- but fancy a grass-plot in George- street ! Those were the " golden fifties," of course, and this old clerk tells us he often played with golden dumb-bells there to stretch his arms after too much ledger.
