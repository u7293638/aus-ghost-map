A MODERN MUNCIIAUSEN. Qrom the Saturday Review.) "WiiKN a new writer comes before the public with his report of a country hitherto unknown, and invites its acceptance of adventures and observations not a little in advance of the experience of the powers of travellers at large, it is not too much to look for something in the way of credentials, if not for the good faith of the tale he has to tell, at all events for his competency as an observer and a reporter.. of the means of access to general confidence there are 1 none perhaps more potent or persuasive than such certificates of trustworthiness and responsibility its go with the possession of rank or title in the public service of the country. Army or navy commissions, admitting as they do of being readily verified, arc | a meng the for ernest of this kind of credentials.

Anybody in these days of liberty may make fun with rank and title, within certain wide limits at least, and consequently it the "mire behoves these who possess thegenuitiebadge to guard against a possible confusion with wen term, of the spurious of tide. It is in no spirit of idle curiosity, still Iff s out of any captious or sceptical turn of mind, that MC ask why Captain J. A. Lawson omits to tell us in what service, or in what country, even on what is clement, he attained the rank which his title-page exhibits. Far be it from us to restrict the claim to such a title within the pages of our muni Army or Navy, or even Volunteer, list. If won by colonial service? e, it would all the more prepare us to go along with the waiter as one likely to face and to accord new incidents of travel with sorrow 'I of the fitness which comes of' experience beyond the ? routine of home life or the jog-trot ideas of the Old "World. "We confess ourselves at the outset at a kiss in what aspect or capacity to speak of Captain J. A. Lawson, mainly because he for bears to speak of' himself. king- at Sydney, he tells us, in November, 1871, he formed the resolution of exploring the ant lion of New Guinea, a country that had a great charm for him as being but little known to Europeans, and therefore affording a new field for the naturalist and adventurer. On his qualifications as a naturalist, as shown by what chas to observe touching the fauna and flora of the novel region traversed, we are spared to a great extent the responsible task of pronouncing by his own modest admission, borne out as it abundantly is by his own pages, of a want of all previous study of the kind. r It is under the second category that he comes more strictly within the range of our criticism. late assuredly, if Mr. Disraeli's test is to hold good that adventures are for the adventurous, Captain Lawson goes some way to make good his title. Contradictory reports prevailed in Sydney respecting the char acter of the Papuans. Instead of being fierce, treacherous, and thievish, as more commonly supposed, Captain. Dobbs, of the Nautilus, who had done a good business in trading to the island, described them as gentle and inoffensive,' albeit somewhat given to thieving. With brandies ship our author resolved on li listing his fortune's, leaving Port Jackson late in the month of May, 1872, For the purpose of trellised in a country where Wines or oxen, even if safely' transported thither, would be useless, till depended on providing suitable bearers. These were to haul in the persons of Toolo, a Lascar, who had been two years in his service, an intelligent and faithful fellow, and three Ausii lilian aborigines, Tom, Joe, and Billy, who contested to having led a vagabond isle kind of life, but had picked up a little learning, two of them being able to lead very tolerably. Tom bolted up the country before the day of sailing came, but the rest of the party were limited in due course at the village of flounce, on the southern shore of New Guinea. This place is described as' containing 263 souls, including Kilce, the old chief, and five or six " oranges " ci magistrates under bird, living by fishing and by ( titidiiig'wilhtho'DutcliI'Iwho take from them spices, etc iigi>,"giiri)b, sundry valuable woods, and bark, birds of pin disc'', skirts' of monkeys,' secateurs, and pearls of an inferior kind. Like ' thc"bl!ieU races, at large, they are mostly di mask as long as rum was to be had. Their huts wcic'seattiied about under fine trees, and had large and cultivated gardens attached, growing pumpkins, yams, bananas, cocoanuts, and other fruits and vegetables. The people were very friendly, and, though they at first laughed at Captain Hixson's idea of penetrating into the interior, did all in their power to serve them, for twelve dollars apiece per month, two guides were secured put of a number of anxious volunteers, having a smattering of English, with a little Dutch, French, and Portugese. Aboo, the eldest, about fifty years old, was a most repulsive fellow, with the mark of a tremendous sword cut across the face. He was only four feet' three inches' in height, but strong enough to lift four or five hundred weight with ease. Dallang, thirty years' younger, was also very strong, but lazy, and' for a Papuan very good looking. On the 10th of July the party made their start, with no more baggage or equipment than a small quantity of tea and to flee, some medicines, pickles, and preserves, a set of instruments for observations, twenty-four pounds of' ship biscuit, andhalf-a-dozciibottlesofbrandy, whereof we are not surprised to find that two were smashed by a stumble on the part of Billy, who, before this, had been found helplessly drunks-having drained another bottle and earned for himself a hearty thumbing." Game being pronounced abundant, they depended for' food upon their arms, Captain Lawson carrying a double-barrelled ride, a fowling-piece, a, sis eli.n fired pistols and a cutlass, his attendants an old musket each and their knives. For a long way their road lay through dense forest, skirting a' vast salt marsh or,half-dried ann Of the sea.

Tangled creepers and parasitic plants for an agree- able and sheltering growth, this utter silence at night presented a strange contrast with the hubbub of animal life during the clay. Now and then distant Shots were heard - a sign that the natives, strange to say, had fire arms. A village was passed from time to time, and all available hospitality shown by the inhabitants. By the bank of a large river a herd of fifty or sixty deer were sighted, the old buck chopping to our traveller's rifle, and ere long three cross | discs emit puddling down the stream, attracted by the lord of the animal, their appearance setting the party to light. Another huge deer, of a species he had never seen before, and called by Aboo day in line, was found killed, by a Coolah or tiger, who had been head" long into the I'iplit crunching its homes., The terms of the Coolah kept the native followers perpetually on the issue of.. To this animal we are indebted for the most lively part of the initiative before us. It is the means of bringing out an amount of prowess on the part of the xx. river which may rose to envy the most accomplished and venturous of" Eastern Shckarries. It is not every one who would even in imagination feel equal to facing a wounded tiger, and despatching him with a knife :- , " Finding himself distanced, the moolah, who had lost the use of one of his fore legs, turned back, and again came towards me, before I had time to ram home a bullet. There was nothing left for it but to ' rm., and run I did till 1 Wciitspiawliiigovei a fallen j trunk. Before I could rise the beast was upon me. and with a growl of satisfaction and anticipated vengeance, as I thought, took me into his clutches. I had a long dagger-knife in my waist belt, mull drew it with all speed, and fright lending me more than my usual strength, I drove it up to the hilt in the creature's side. Turning savagely on feeling the pain, it seized the knife in its powerful jaws and broke it. It was its last act, for immediately, it fell dead without a groan and with great relief of mind I extricated myself from under the carcases " Upon hearing my call my companions came up.

Aboo had seen plenty of this species before, always some distance inland, which must account for their never having been noticed by voyagers familiar with the coast.
