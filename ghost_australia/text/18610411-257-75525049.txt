POET'S CORNER THE BETRAYED (By Sarah H, Bolton; from "Once a Week.") She sat alone, on a cold grey stone, Where rivers made a desolate moan. The sycamore trees stood white and bare, Like sheeted ghosts in the dusty air. A black cloud floated along the sky, And a night-bird uttered a dismal cry. Sadly she thought of the innocent time; Wildly she wept for her shame and crime. Darker and deeper the shadows grow: He promised to meet her an hour ago. She sat alone, on the cold grey stone, And the river flowed with a sadder moan. She heard the hum of the distant town, The patter of dead leaves falling down. She heard the toad in the long dank grass. But never his treadâ€” alas, alas ! The morning came with its golden light. To the sycamore trees so bare and white. The mists that float on the river's brim, Went up like the wings of the cherubim. The water-lillies cold and fair, Were tangled with tresses of long brown hair. The osiers bent with a quiet grace Over a form with a still white face. The river flowed with a desolate moan. And dead leaves fell on the cold grey stone.
