INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE LEITCH. (INTRODUCTION) On the first night I appeared in Ballarat I was coining on the stage as Tom Dossiter in a rocking boat in the storm scene of Har bor Lights ” The boat was not properly arranged by the property man, and collapsed, Ibrowing me out upou tbe pointed rockers, I have suffered much pain since, and ought not to Imv e acted afterwards, but important arrangements had been made between Mr M’Mahon and myself—theatres and a com pany secured; so it> would have been a very serious matter all round had I given up I suffered a great deal, and many a time whilst playing Spoffy in “Human Nature” 1 have been taint with pain when the andi ences h ive been laughing uproariously The result is that I am laid up here, aftei under going an opeiation, but Drs Ochiltree and Seott are clever gentlemen, and are most assiduous in their attentions, so I hope soon to be all right again Asked why he had been so long in coming to Bdlarat’ Because I had always been warned against doing so. “ It is not a good theatrical city,” said the knowulls, " people won’t come out to the theatre, ind they won’t like your style of iu ting ” I tun able to emphatically disprove these assertions Not only has the Academy been splendidly patiumsed during my tw o eng igeintnts liei e, but I can honestly siy that I have never played to moie appre civtive audiences Asjto the city itself, well, it was to me a colonial surprise 1 have walked about its streets and suburbs with always increasing adinnation. Sturt street is the finest street in the colonies In tune to conic it should be one of the finest in the world I found the suburbs delightful, with snug cottages and thgunt villas set in gir densblooming with flowers, and neh in ever greens, the well-kept loads, bordered and shaded with trees on cither side, their medi cinal odois mingling with the soft fra grant air, affording exquisite relief and gratification to the souse", and theie arc few prettier dnvos than that round the lake, or mate attractive gardens 1 hive spent m vny a plcisant half houi there and in the fernery; there is su much to admiie, uid I have passed more than one hour in adimialion of the beautiful statuaiy, than which, I suppose, there is nothing liner m the colonies or in Europe V\ hat a noble gift 1 How proud Ballarat should he of it All these, and many other ulv intagcs winch 1 c innot enmunerate, place Ballarat, in my opinion, in the foremost rank of colonial cities What class of characters do I like best to play ’ Those that have given me most trouble Some of the parts I made my reputation in at home I have never ventured to pi ly out here—The Improvisitorc, for instance I was for three yens studying this ch iructer. I could never find my ideal face (a young, handsome Italiui], till one Sum] iy' night I saw it undei a lamp post in Hatton Garden, and went for the owner. He was an Italian image seller. I saw all the color tones in bis face, and bought tho earrings from his ears, and would have bought the hair off his held if I could I also like playing Don Chriss in “ A Touch of the Sun ” I have pliyed that in the colonies, but not often; it shakes me up too much. I played it in Sydney recently for a few weeks I his character is a very complex one, and gave me a great deal of tiouble It was a long time before I would venture to play the piece at all The music composed for it i-, so marvellously elder and psychological that when I fiist heard it I felt I could never do justice to the author’s concep lion, which, like a ghost, was constmtly before me, and I put the play by for 12 months longer. Before I appeared at the Strand in “Inal by Jmv,” I was a long time bunting for a judge’s face. I could not find it m the couits. I found it at last in the celebrated pictuie of the richborne trial, and was able to resuscitate tho judge then dead into life again A great deal of the original business of the scene which I in vented in the six months’ run of the piece has been unit ited m many p irts of the globe since Thibbet", in “ Ihe I’earl Divers,” w Inch I hope to produce by and bye, is an exact replica of a half witted fellow I knew wheh I was a boy, who was attached to a Lunatic Asylum neat where I lived. Many a tune I’ve given him pennies, winch he would haughtily accept, and give mo in return an lOU, for two thousand one hundred and seventy nine pounds tw o shillings and set enpcnce, a penny more or less. I think poor Thibbcts one of the most legitimately humorous imper sonations I have ever attempted, hut then I have hint always with mo in flc"h ami blood, I laugh with the audience at him, while I pity him sadly. Of my present repertoire some pi ople prefer Tom Dositter, others Old Jaikcs; but I think at present tbe majority of good fi lends prefer Spoffy, in “Human Natuie.” He was modelled on a friend of mine ut home, and I often see him when I play the part. These little studies are the salt of a true artist’s life. Actors and actresses groan at tho time they consider wasted over rehear sils. The teally necessary and constant labor with them, is objectionable and laborious work to be got over and forgotten. Artists, on the contnry, feel only the un ending desire to create nod excel, for dia matte ait embraces in its studies all the other arts, of winch too much cannot bo known, and of which Dame Nature is the mother. Ses; I have seen all the best and greatest artiste"; played with nuny of them, whom as a boy I used to worship ’ 1 was teimnded tho other day’ in reading a New Yolk letter of an experience of which I think no other actor can boast, viz , that of hivingbcin announced to appear in the sime b 11 with an Italian Opera Company. My engigement being made for Manchester only, I declined to go with the Diamatic Company to a distant town during the stay of the Opera Tioupe, for I had looked forward to tins special holiday, us I had been woiked very hard The angry mana ger declared I should earn my salary, howevei, and announced me to play in a faice in which only two characters up peired, and which was to follow the opera. It was u bnlhint troupe of urtuts that came down, and my humiliation was grevt “ Whit’s tins, 11011110’” snd Santley, as he. Fob, and Camp mini, dressed for homo, saw the stage set and me ready to go on “ Eh, a f irce, after Italian Opera shouted Foil “ Yes, gentlemen, ’ said our enraged ami witty conductor, who had to stay ami play an entr'acte, “ it’s to strrngthen the bill ” “Oh ,” said Foil, who swore like an Irishman Night after night the opeia artists would come down after their labors, and laugh at the performance, our witty conductor being in the suggestion's box in front of the stage reading in mock It than the lines of the book of the firce, so —“ Enter ah to Flipprent (I was playing a chaiactei called Flipper), takes a chair, oh, after rcoep oh, begins to gorge oh,” and so on, after the m inner of the Itdmn suggest ion, which tickled the Italian artists and emaged the real suggesiture beyond picify mg Twice did the gifted Hina de Murska in her robes of Astnufanionto and cloaked as Duiorah sit in the wings with hei big dog at her feet, and watch my efforts in that miser able faice, laugh at mv idiotic business with a Wellington hoot, while hei dogappliuded witn his iodder, eyeing the real food on the table which he hoped he would, and did, get afterwards. K\D OV A BRILLIANT SINGER It was reading of poor De Mmska’s sad end to day that m ikes mo remember this ex pcnencc What abi ilhunt artiste she was. How I have watched her eveiy action, and perspired with enthusiasm hud cold aim cry ecstacy it her marvellous voice I think her acting in the mad to lie of “ Dmorah ” helped me years afterwards hi ray study of Don C/hnss In reading of her fate I could see her again in the wings in Astnafai.icntc’s tolas, watching mid en couraging my efforts, not know mg my pride or undeistaiuling my humiliation Ore it, yet poor De Murska In thinking of her the lines I haves» often spoken in “ Inelmpro visntore” come back to mo with double sig mfioance —“ Acting is an art unlike any other. A painter may live for ever in Ins pictures, a poet in Ins song immortalises himself. Dramatic art is like a rainbow—a divine bridge at times between heaven and earth —it is adniKed, applauded, theu vanishes with all its colors ' ’
