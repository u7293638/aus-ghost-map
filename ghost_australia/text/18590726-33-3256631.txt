THE DEBATE IN THE PRUSSIAN CHAMBER. The debate which took place in the Prussian Chamber of Representatives on the 12th instant, when a Bill was presented for extraordinary supplies to provide for placing the army on a war foot- ing, and for the eventualities of war, throws considerable light upon the state of feeling in Germany : M. de Schleinitz, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in proposing the adoption of the Bill, expressed the hope that no orator would endeavor to throw obstacles in the way of the Government at so serious a juncture. It was not however, his wish to impede free discussion, especially at a moment when it was desirable to ascertain the real sentiments of the country. M. do Zincke said he should have liked to have seen a little more energy and patriotic spirit in the Government report, he would speak with that sincerity which was due to the nation. No Prussian heart could conceive the idea of Prussia joining the Emperor Napoleon against Austria, ( Loud cheers.) Prussians should never forget that Austria formed a German nucleus, and that they were of bound to Austria by the sacred bonds of the Con- federation, (Cheers.) He had no enmity towards France. Traditional hatred had passed away. Behold the Anglo-French, alliance ! Frenchmen have qualities, which we might envy, but they are superficial ones. We have qualities, which they do, not possess a. fear of God, love of truth, of justice, and consistency. The French are always craving for what they call their national frontiers.' Another danger exists in the system actually in force 'in France-a system develop?!.; in 1839 in, the Ideas JfapolpyJoMies,'according to which the w arid Italy is but the first act of the drama. The others will be played upon the Rains, then in England, turn in Russia. He could not blame the Austrian ultimatum, as it had been blamed by the Government. If Austria has commenced the war, she was driven to it.

The Congress was nothing more than a subterfuge to give France time to complete her armaments. As in all probability Prussia would have shortly to stand side by side with Austria on the field of battle, the sooner the disapproval of the Government of the policy of Austria was dropped, the better, (Great sensation He did not think the moment had arrived for Germany to send an army to Italy.

Moreover, Austria would never forgive Prussia for her influence in Germany, her Protestantism, The? freedom of public instruction, and liberty of the press. But it was very important to Prussia (though of no direct interest to Germany) that the power of Austria in Italy should not be weakened to the advantage of France and Sardinia.

M. de Schleinitz (Minister of Foreign Affairs) said that Prussia did not wish to dispute Austria's yells to send an ozs amalgam, to Sardinia ; but the Prussian Government felt it its duty to disapprove an act which it thought was impolitic, which it had energetically counselled, and which put an end to the hopes of peace. it. Henri d'Arnim (ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, und ex Ambassador at Paris and Brussels-,) was of the opinion that the hope of Germany ought to give its' ac, basin, to the vote a lies, the Chamber would shortly give. Gentlemen, the said, according to the 16th article of the final act of Vienna, the present war in Italy does not concern the German Gqnfedera: ton, But acccording to public ordinary here, as well as in the rest of Germany, the war touches us yearly. The final act of Vienna has the value of a fundamental law for Germany. But the great public voice of German nationality is a window mental law of her national existence hr a much more elevated sense, and this war, though only as yet touching the non German provinces of a confederate State, may become a danger for the Confedera- tion and for Germany. (Applause.) Does that mean to imply that we should enter Italy to assist, Austrians preserving her Italian provinces, her influence over, the rest of Italy, and, perhaps, in stilling the constitutional life of Italy ? Not assuredly not! But Prussia ought to be prepared for every eventuality. Her calling is to defend the interests of Germany. M. Simson (ex-President of the National Assembly at Frankfort) declared that he had no sympathy whatever for the present system of Government in France. The man who has broken faith cannot restore it.' The end cannot justify the means. Since Sardinia had thought fit to join the revolution and call in foreigners into Italy she had lost all claim to respect. Prussia and Austria were at variance on, many points, But Austria counted 8,000,000 Germans among her subjects there was therefore a Gorman interest to support Austria. But the time had not yet come. Prussia should never allow herself to be actuated by 8 vote of the majority at Frankfort. When the time comes Prussia will draw the sword and place her trust in the God of Battles. (Applause.) li. Burger (the reporter of the com- mittee) stated that the policy of Prussia was not neutrality,' but, for the present, an armed mediation. She was keeping guard over the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe, and reserved it to herself to take part in the war if her conditions were not accepted. The Chamber then proceeded to vote. The first proposal for a loan of 40,000,000 dollars was voted without discussion, amid great applause and the other proposals for levying certain taxes, c, were also carried unanimously Times.
