I MB. BUCHARAS 6TH HAMLET. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-Dr Buchanan may have found sufficient reasons to satisfy himself that it was the intention of Shakespeare to portray Hamlet is a lunatic, but the majority of Shakespearian students and ci cities are quite opposed to this view of the character The safest method to arrive at a correct understanding of the question is to take the author as a sufficient authority In the last scene of the first act we find Hamlet giving the keynote to all his subsequent proceedings " But come here as before never so help you mercy I lion strange or odd see or 1 be is myself As I perch ince hereafter shall thin- meet To put an antic disposition on Again, in act II, scene I, having the recorder in his hand, he addresses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the courtiers sent by the King to sound him - "Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of mc You would play upon me you would seem to know my stops on would pluck out the heart of my mystery. you would sound me from the lowest note to the top of my compass, and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speaks blood' Do you think I am easier to replayed on than a pipe ( Call me what instrument you will though v you can fret me, you cannot play upon me " And immediately after, when Polomos agrees with him about the shades of the cloud he exclaims They feel into the top of my bout," clearly indicating that he was merely acting madness, and was satisfied with the success of his stratagem in the closet scene with his mother he still further shows that his madness was assumed Lota v I My pulse as v our-, cloth temperately keep time 1min makes us healthful music It is not madness That I have uttered brine; me to the test, An 11 the matter will re word which in edness Would gambol from Mother for love of grace. Law not that flattering unction to your soul, 1 but not our trespass but my madness speaks " And further on " Make you to ravel all this matter out, \- that Les entirely am not in madness Hut mad In craft "One of the strongest proofs that his madness was all part of the scheme to discover beyond all doubt the murderer of his father, and to satisfy himself about the truth of the Ghost's revelations before proceeding to his deep revenge, may be found in the fact that Horatio, the man to whom he says " Dost thou heart Since my soul was mixture s of mv choice, And could of men distinguish her election Hath sealed thee for herself Give me that man That is not passion s slave and I will wear him In my hearts cure me, in my heart of hearts, As I do thee, * the man to whom he confides all his most secret thoughts and actions- never for a moment doubts his sanity there is not a line indicating the slightest suspicion on the part of Horatio The only characters in the tragedy who think him mad and those whom for the furtherance of his plans, it is his desire should be misled and both Polonius and the King have their doubts, for the formerly act 2, scene 2, says Though the be madness, 'S yet there is method in It " and in net in scene 1, the King remarks love his affections do not that a av tond, Nor what he is Lake though It lack d farm a little, VV as not like madness " With reference to his treatment of Ophelia, the kill- ing of Polonius, &.C, perfectly legal al explanations could be given but the purpose of this letter is merely to show that whatever Mr Buchanan's opinion may be, it was not Shakespeare's intention to make Hamlet mad, and in my opinion, Mr Parker's view of the character is the correct one I am, etc, G.
