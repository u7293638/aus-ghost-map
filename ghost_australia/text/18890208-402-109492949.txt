POETRY. VIGNETTE. The long waves wash the strand, the fog lies low, A moaning wind soft croons along the coast, And, white and gleaming like a new-made ghost, The seagull flaps along, heavy and slow, Then fades in the gray mist. Aye, to and fro The scented seaweed, twined around yon post, Floats, falls, then rises, until we almost Deem that a mermaid calls on us to go And join her court. The earth, the sea, the sky Are one drear tint. Then round me as I dream Dead days arise, and hold me in their arms, And whisper me: All men are born to die, And dawn is nought, save prestige of the gleam That kills our clay, e'en while it gilds her charms. â€”All the Year Round.
