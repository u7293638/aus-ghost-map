RANDOM PAPERS. By Quivis. CUP MUSINGS AND JOTTINGS. There is an association of ideas through difference as well as through resemblance, and it is thus that I am never possessed so strong with the feeling that men are ghosts and I am a ghost watching them as when I am in a crowd which makes both da) in the sunshine. The average ghost haunts the night, and vanishes at cock crow, it is seen only in solitary places, it is generally silent and though it maybe permitted to smile sadly, it never laughs the jolly side shakinglauc.li of the flesh The crowd I am speaking of loves the blithesome light of day and the busy haunts of men and it is noisy) and demonstrative, and its roar of laughter or delight is in the Bound mt of the surf on a rock bound coast And yet by the mental process of association through difference, I find myself compelled to regard it as a mere collection of shapes projected on the background of the Present only to vanish in a twinkling, for between an eternity past and an eternity to come what is the longest life but a brief moment' Yea, verily, VI of are no more that a mere moving row Of mails shadow shapes that come and to Bound with the sun illumined lantern held 11 n Idtilght by the master of the ation Looked at so, the great pageant of the Melbourne Cup with its eager noisy thousands and its plenitude of life and wealth of sunshine, was only for me a phantom elena vanished now as I write nay, tone, as I lingered while the evening shadows were falling on the deserted hill and the silent flat and the empty benches on which ) on th and beauty had Haunted bravely I re this appears in print I daresay most men have come to the conclusion that one can have too much even of racing and that articles on sporting topics may be so tipped with impunity) It is, therefore fortunate for me that knowing nothing about the horse I cannot write a sporting" article My private opinion about the horse is that he was created to demoralise men, by tempting them from the paths of virtue, but as it is perhaps based upon prejudice it is not entitled to much value yet I think few will deny that it by abolishing the horse we could also abolish trainers touters stable loafers and, above all, bookmakers the gain to the human race would be enormous and he would be much nearer the Kingdom of Heaven than we are at present Were Goethe a task of creating 'Faust to be done yet I feel convinced that he would have made Meplna topheles a genial but seductive bookmaker, who hires his victim to rain b) long odds and easy terms. Alter reading the papers of last Tuesday morning I came to the conclusion that the whole world was worshipping the horse and I considered that it would be only becoming and proper for me to show some respect to the popular idol by going to the races.

He was moneys) liable and repellant at first, as are you and I, dear reader, when we feel ourselves in another men's power But after lunch he thawed a little, and permitted me to find a place for him on the lower steps of the stand which crowns the hill. "Dear me, what a wonderful sight, he ejaculated, as he gets his field glass into focus and surveys the scene e around him The "sight" seems, never strict scrutiny, to grieve him, for he continues Softly, as if thinking aloud, "And to think that all these thousands are given over to vanity and pleasure now sad < how very Bad i ' Mr Cropper, having said this, looked so benign and pure that I felt I was dumb an unholy thing when I explained to him that the gentlemen in gorgeous apparel were not the Governors win were the guests of Sir Henry Loch, but four book makers Also when he asked senselessly what the persons were doing who were dropping pellets of paper into one nut and paying half crowns into another, I blushed with shame when I confessed that they were engaged in "sweeps." Shortly after this Cropper escaped from me again, and I retired to the green award, which is behind the hill, where milk is ended at 8d a glass, and where matrons refresh babies from the "material found," in a rustic kiosk Here I find that there are hundreds of people who, like myself, care nothing for the races, and they picnic on the grass, and get up sweeps, or lie luxurious!) looking up into the pale blue sky, as if it were sweet to be "out of the hurly-burly on the other side of the hill A crowd is gathered round a man whose game is "1 French Aunt Sally)," and as the pool amounts to 12s , there is not a little excitement amongst the competitors. Some of the best shots are sailors from the Nelson, and I find that both on the hill and the fiat Jack Tar is what the reporters call "a prominent feature." Later on I foregather with several of them who have imbibed not wisely but too well, and at the end, on the Hut, I come upon a bunch of them fighting with some drunken larrikins, but the picture which is the most characteristic and the pleasantest is that of the half a dozen bronzed faces round the blind man, who sat like Lazarus at the gate of Day is, asking for alms on the pleasure seekers. One half drunken fellow had taken the old man's box. and was rattling it, and asking jeeringly, "How much d'ye take for it ole feller t " but he was sternly re- proved by a burly yellow bearded man, with "Stow that, you swab, let's give 'him what we've got and sheer off ' And as each before he sheered off" dropped a silver coin into the box Lazarus rejoiced, and sent after! them a fervent "God bless you, gentlemen " 'the bell which rang for the Cup cleared the award behind the hill, for even the dullest heart is stirred when the great race of the year is to be run. I had succeeded in getting a place which gave me an exciting view of the coat collar of a tall bushman who stood in front, and I was sitting down on the trodden turf to philosophically await the issue, when I heard a well known voice ex- claim, with a vigour worthy of a bookmaker at his best, Two more chances for the Cush gentlmen, only two half crowns, two Thank you, what initials' BOB, very good.
