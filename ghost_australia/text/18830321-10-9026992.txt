! REVIEW. THE VICTORIAN REVIEW. Periodical literature, by means of which the student is placed on support with the contemporary thought of the world, has long been considered such an indispensable institution that a literal j mans table would be altogether incomplete without representative magazines and re\ lows Europa indeed owes a debt of gratitude to the little band of French litterateur who, in 1905, started the Journal de Savantb, the first publication of its kind that ever appealed (and still, by the way, in existence), and which was such a success from the start that both in England and Germany peas medical literature for a long time consisted principally of a inslations from its columns Each country has now its leading periodical, with the name of which we are all tolerably familiar, that of Australia being pretty widely known as the Victor ian Review If a Master from Europe were to examine critically the number for the current month, he would in all probability be extremely surprised at the high standard maintained throughout He would find the majority of the articles interesting quite a large proportion compared with other row lows-while, wore ho of colonial birth, bowouldpi orally be interested as he assuredly would be in structed by all Were but one feature, indeed, improved the professing to deal with " The Contemporary Thought of Great Britain, Europe, and the United States he would be inclined to mark the Review as one of the best he had over come across, and a very model of its kind As it is, this department is simply a very brief painting of a Bw English and American magazines To make it what it professes to belong to a literary man the task would be an enviable amounts form should be remodelled, and not only English and American, but all foreign review a, should be ransacked in order to keep the leaders of the Review on j support with contemporary thought The first article to arrest the attention of the colonial reader will probably be that by Charles Pridham AA he appeals tolano for lowed the multifarious avocations of a litterateur, gold commissioner, police magis State, and finally a practising blister on the Anthropology and Ethnology of the Abo Lines of Australia T. in the absence of all trace of the n to a place below the surface of actually existing tons which, it must be remembered abound luthrclicaof long extinct species of animal and vegetable life, and from the extreme paucity in numbers of the inhabitants of the Australian con- tinent wbenfir8tdiBco\ercd the writer infers that the continent it is not peopled till comparatively a very recent date In fact, he fixes upon the close of the fourteenth century as the most likely period for the alleged migration to have ocean ed, and thinks he can trace in the resemblance be tween Australian nomenclature and Smgha lose and Malay names, as also in the Bimi party which he seems to have been the first to detect between the Australian aborigines and the aborigines of Ceylon, an organ for the race in the last named island The writer supposes that large numbers of Yakka the name of the aborigines in question - ousted from their original m sentance by their Singhalese conquerors, enrolled themselves in the service of the Malays, at that time the greatest and most daring navigators of that part of the world Had the continent been peopled before the the time assumed instead of a paltry 50,000 inhabitants, which is about all, it is computed, that Australia held 100 years ago there would hav e been nulhoiiB there After pointing out that nigh ations from one spot of the earth's surface to another have in few cases been regulated by immediate proximity, the writer proceeds to give in stances of numerous w o ds and terminations in the Australian vocabulary of Singhalese and Malay origin He disputes the assertion that the Tasmanian aborigines had no thing in common with the aborigines of the continent, with whom he contends they are more or less closely allied, the language of the Tasmanian aboriginal having closely resembled that used by the natives of the western coast of Australia. The extraordinary weapon, the boomerang, which was used by the Drawdiuu races at an early period of their history, is alone sufficient to establish a prima facie connection between the Australian aboriginal and his assumed Indian home, the writer ingeniously point me out that the improvement in the original weapon, which seems to have been made by the Australian after his arm al, was paralleled by the invention of the crass bow by the Normans during the period of their migration The next most interesting article in the Romero is the obituary by Alfred Plumpton of one who has effected a complete revolution in the musical world during his three score years and seven, and who will ever be regarded as one of the most original writers the world has seen In his 10th year Wog ner-who is id then only composed Rienzi and the Fly nig Dutchman-w as already pronounced by Spobr as the most gifted among in my composers at a time when Mendelssohn, Rossini, Mej error, and other celeb ritiLB w el c alive It was from his possession, in the highest degree, of several great qualities that Wagner was enabled to stamp his impress BO indelibly on the musical u world and inaugurate a new era in the progress of the divine art. It was his literary talent, as the writer in the under points out, which was the earliest to develop itself, Wagner's first production, written and published at the age of 11, being a tragedy which he himself describes as a "land of compound of Hamlet and King Lear ' ' in after years the great composer ironically alludes to the design of this premature effort as "grand in the extreme, 42 persons dying in the course of the piece, and the want of hung characters compelling him to let most of them reappear as ghosts in the last act 1 Wagner was evidently a rapid composer, the cut ne opera of The Nugent Dutchman, libretto and music, with the exception of the overture, being completed in the incredibly short time of seven weeks, a feat which, comparatively speaking, is fully equal to that of Dr Johnson, v he wrote Rasselas in a week to defray the funeral expenses of his aged mother During the composition of Lohengrin perhaps the most popular of his works Wagner, at that time chapel master at Dresden, was forced to fly the country on account of the active part he took in the political strife then raging It was in Switzerland, after his escape from the Saxon capital, as the writer in the Review points out, that some of Wagner's most famous literary works were written, including " Die Kunstwerk der Zukunft" (the art work of the future), from which the term, Music of the Future, given in derision by his opponents had its origin In fact, he was so absorbed in literary pursuits for the four years following his flight from Dresden, that he produced no musical work at all, or, as the water in the Review somewhat higher tousfy puts it, he " found an entire dearth of musical ideas It was not till the consummation of this period that Wagner commenced the gigantic trilogy known as the "Nibelungen Lied,' which marks as much an era in his own art progress as his whole life work marks an era in the art progress of the age In fact, if we are to believe the occasionally expressed opinions of some of his more intense admirers, the four years' interregnum was like the retirement of Mahomet and others of his stamp into the desert, whence they emerged with ideas whose comprehensive e breadth far surpassed any they had previously concern ed, and the originality and depth of which enabled them to assume from thenceforth the role of reformers of the world in the article under notice there occurs such a well turned and justly expressed sketch of the most striking characteristics of the great master's style that, were our space not limited, we would gladly quote it at length The gist of it is that since the advent of Wagner,, Voltaire's sarcasm, " Ce qui eel trap set four years died on le change, can no longer be applied, at any rate to any of this matter s productions, the return voyage which was considered good enough for opera before his time being replaced by UlrttU composed by himself, and each of which is in itself a poem of singular men it Perhaps the ablest written at tick in the Review, as from a historical point of view it is the most instructs it, is the attempt by J Crozier to apply the Lations of historical science to the use of Ireland lins writer of acts tho cause of the elaborate discontent in the KinoiaUl Isle to the utter absence of any attempt on the part of the English at adela to harmonise the existing laws of the con- quoting lace with those of the conquered, its was done by the Noiiiiniiu, for example, in their invasion of England One of the most essential points of the old Iii eton lau a which were in force when limit assumed the so\ at dignity of the "Isle of burnt, Mas the popular belief in the choicest light, not of the individual, but of the whole plan, to the possession of the soil, a belief which of us in those early days ingrained in the very hearts of the Irish lace, as it has been for ages post in that of the Russian peasantry 'Ino doo trine of the invaders, on the other hand, was the very reverse of this, the two systems, in fact being so diametrically opposed as to be practically Irreconcilable, and hence the natural result has followed. The idea of personal property in land was indeed, as the writer justly points out, the rock on which all attempts at conciliation by England split. After Robson ing that what in Hungary or Circassia is regarded as patriotism, in Ireland IS looked upon its a crime, the writer concludes by noting the spread of the idea all over her tain that the bush have a right to ask that they should he governed in the way they profess themselves, and by asserting that if this principle is not granted, then the Great Rebellion, the Revolution, and the War of Independence were all in MIHI, that the Italians were wrong in fighting for nation of unity, and the South American Republics were wrong in breaking from the despotism of Mad had Having referred at somewhat unusual length to the above articles, want of space precludes us from more than just mentioning the others 'those ino -An article on the practical working of the licensing system, by 1 C Aldritt, a rather dry, because rather' stale, paper on solar physics, by Thomas Harrison, a poetical account by AN " of the manner in which he at last discovered the latent beauty of the Torso Bolvcdota, some rather pretty verses by H Kingston Kendall, a sketch of a ruling passion of the human race, to wit, gaming, by Hamilton Mackinnon ; some suggestions by J G Starr, C E , as to the cost means of supplying water to northern Victorian plains and last, but by no means least, a critical sketch by D. B. W.
