The light blues began as they finished, lmdiy. In the first over Turner called Bannerman for a run, and raced down tlio pitch. Too late he found there was 110 response, and turned to go back ; but a rather awkward return by Graham was cleverly taken by Trumble, and Turner never bad the ghost of a ebaiicc to get to liis crease. The first wicket Went thus before a run had been scored. But there was no eu- -V- 1 tliusiasm over it. Such luck -was a little too liurd, oven for Victorians.
