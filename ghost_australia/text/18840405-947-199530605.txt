In the summer of 1690, under the most peculiar oiroumstancss, _ a great treasure was hidden in the side of a miehtv chasm on the coast of Antrim. Not very distant was this chasm from jfche spot where William of Orange, landed with his troops, when the Jacobite' flags of Stuart and of Bourbon waved defiantly above Drogheda's walls and the great battle of the Boyne waa fought. That memorable July day when the united forces of Ireland and of France, under the command of James II., fierce and implacable though they had threatened to be, fell -back before the English fire, defeated, routed, shamed, their vacillating king seeking refuge at the Court of France, while the victorious William, emboldened by success, passed with his glorious army, through the capital , of Ireland to beleaguer Limerick. It was at this important era in the his tory of Ireland that The O'Maille, of Oole raine, the head of a family ranking with ! the highest of the great Celtic race, if not the riohost and ataunohest followers of the ? Jacobites — goaled to mad-brained patriot- i ism by the defeat of of his party— con- ' verted all his property into capital to aid | the native troops to make a gallant stand; at Limerick ; 'his chief object being to; gather some eight thousand Rapparees' under the enthusiastic leadership of the; after-famed, O'Donnel. The scheme was eminently successful,, for evan priests and bishops flocked to the standard of the ad venturers, as if the'.houses of O'Donnel and \- O'Maille had been as truly and inde feasibly royal as the houses of Stuart or Bourbon. At, least more loyal, for; their liege defender had forsaken tliem. '? , However, it ia not with the siege of Limeriokthis story has to deal, butwitha hidden treasure onoe in the possession of the family of O'Maffle ere they were scattered about or exiled far and wide, ?with after fate and honours kept green only; by the minstrels' songs or friars' tales, m. the more paacetui. wu»o= n»»mi» ?.«?*%»..— strife and faction. . : ; : ?: About the last convertible property dispatched to aid the . Jaoobite cause- rthe dispatch which neither Berved. its purpose nor ? reached its destination— waa .the family jewels of the O'Maille. These jewels, for the most part hereditary, stil} in part amassed by their present owner, Were muohtalked of by the peasantry of Ooleraine 5 for 'The O'Maille'' had been 'heard to aver on more than one occasion that hiB family. possessed the finest jewels in the world, and certainly his after . patriotism and love for Erin proved he was ? not a merely vain and ostentatious boast. In truth the greater portion of the dia monds had been purchased some half century or so before from some English merchants at Surat— the jewels having ?'been found in the rooks.of Oouloun.in ', the province of Golconda. . However, the ? bxact value of this' property was., never ascertained, being only roughly estimated commercially and- privately when con, fided to the care of; a zealous and conj fidential Jesuit, who had' undertaken t6 .find a. market in England for the jewels, '. and who with that purpose determined to . cross St. George's Channel; at Carriok ? fergus point. . -. :,.-??' ' That a speedy expedition waa absolutely i necessary waB manifested by the -*- threatened want of ammunition and pro visionB by the Jacobite party, who, having fear of this, hesitated not to pillage with out mercy wherever, and wheneyer I 'opportunity occurred.1 ; For, plantations, I and even villages, were laid waste by the I soldiers and Rapparees ; leaving, per I haps, a few naked, starving villagers, con-' I tent to feed off the husks about their own I barn-doors. , , I Thus, O'Maille, feeling keenly this con I ' dition of affairs, and aiming for the I nobler end of victory . with honour, had I made.this sacrifice of wealth to aid his I country's cause; arid Marcus -Verite, a I Jesuit prieBt, » strong partisan to the I Jacobite rebellion, had undertaken the I cpnveyence of the property : a mission re I quiring the greatest care — it being so I necessary, in the event of search, to I avoid all suspioion, that not a scrap of I paper wasto be' detected about the bearer, I - the nature of his commision being written I ' in invisible ink on the buttons of aa under I ' vest. Therefore, beyond tho carriage of I the jewels, the greater portion of 'which I -were concealed about his clothes and in the I lining of a leathern wallet, ?n which some I slight provision for hia journey had ,beeri I made, Marcus' Verite bore no tangible I evidence of a suspioious nature, save the I religion which a : Sebrew Bible and his I garb ostensibly proclaimed. He had a I little English money, by the way, and a I little Frenoh gold, , the brass com with I James's emgy being very scarce,, and cer, I tainly unsafe for! one to Jtrade with; in I auoh active parly times. .-;,'! ; I Unfortunately,, he ,had. not long Bet I forth upori-'hia journey' when he got I mixed uV itfa brawl at ah inn near I C'ABtnmr -wfien? in . jtflcfci obwwanoe.Vith; I the nature. of his miaaipn. he; should' have, I ^Xwfcfiu&f; ^iB^giiifM: I jnga anduB)ieadfa- iM^Mra*}ngtr6irf 1& I jiapute, instead of attempting to »Uay l\ - or 'irritate' the fury of the contending f»ctionB. '/'.''.??? . ? ' . ??';, ?'.: ?' ;': i .'But' the Church of Rome was a subject i nearest to Father Verite' a. heart, . arid ' it- was dangerous to show how far. his discussion would have carried him on this momentous occasion,- had he not remem bered his oath of allegiance sworn to the Q'Maille— remembered it only ou hear ing, with unspeakcble horror, the object of- his mission whispered at his elbow, and bruited round the inn, divulged by some mysterious means, some idle boast, some hint, or giving out of his he wiat not of ; leaving him, however, with ; but one road open, one resource — a speedy .flight. ? But chase waa given by several rnar au'derd who heard of the treasure this Jesuit bore with him, and on the! road to Carrickfergus he was hotly followed': in pursuit. But as his enemies did not succeed in overtaking him, it was supposed. ? by many that he had changed hia course and taken refuge among the wilds and rocks abounding on the coast of Antrim. For his ' disappearance was a mystery to all, trad that he failed in the object of his mission was a bitter truth too soon brought home to the O'Ma'illesj' ? who, bankrupt now in every way, sought refuge in the. Court of Spain,leaving their treasure and the Jesuit priest to the un known fate !which overtook him and his; trust. - ,.';. Still the family waa never thoroughly forgotten, and for many, years the peasantry around Coleraine grew accus 'tomed from their infancy, to tell, their] story — of the noble sacrifice they -- had .made, and of the thousands who ' had flocked beneath their standard for the common cause of Treland. But Time steps in and banishes the proudest of remembrances,' arid when some remnant of the exiled family returned to settle in their native land, little of their past was known to any but themselves,, and even the story of Father :, [Verite, traditionally told by father and son, grew more and more obscure with each rising generation, savouring.., more of fiction than reality. , ' ?'??.. . :.?'?, -, , ' .- ' But there the truth existed; which would come to light some .day,:. the :truth which telb the story ' of .

But the' travellers, deolining1 this invi tation, divested themselves of their coats; and gaiters, arid ( accepting the chairs1 placed for', them before a blazing fire, waited the^advent of. the. whisky., Sir Michael O'Maille, a descendant of '! The , O'Maille,'' whose patriotism andi love of country, was recounted in the opening chapter of this story, was a man who had reaohed his sixty- seventh year,1 an age, however, that ivory few would have ascribed to him ; light-hearted, jovial, kind to a fault, upright, Bincero, with the warmth of an enthusiast, he was more like a man in the summer of hia life than one who fast approaohed the seared and ' yellow leaf. He was a man who never liked to be thought old, a man who rejoiced in youth ; ' but he was now; too corpulent to enter ' into ' youthful sporta — though not unwieldly, be it un derstood, but too comfortably stout, . .His cousin, Maurioe Wiriterton, though well filled up, possessed not the round, jovial, ingratiating : faoe .of O'Maille ; there .was more of tho worldly man in his more thoughtful countenance and heavier brow— a man of cooler calculation and less enthusiasm. Although aome ten years 'younger than his companion, hia hair was really^ greyer— in a word he was of the build and proportion of an active man of business. -'-Both travellers were dressed as nearly, as- possible alike, and both had set out with their own; horses,' unattended, from the seat '.'of the O'Maille, near Bray,- on ' aJ touring expedition through the north of Ireland. Sir Michael O'Maille, who had been a widower for some years, and his son Owen, now a young man recently attain ing his majority, were the only living and direct representatives of the old family of Ooleraine.- . His present companion, Maurice Winterton, was a cousin of his late wife, and had lived for some years with ;the family, presiding as a sort of tutelary mentor to their son, and a faith ful ami defamille. '..? He had also proved himself to be the most invaluable coach when'OwenwaB studyingfor honours at Tririity College, although it must not be concluded from this that Maurice Win terton was a dependant on the family he courted, for he held the strings of a purse of his own, which if somewhat- scantily- furnished, had at least the advantage of being self-supporting. ? 'I' hope the horses win be cared for,' observed O'Maille, loosening hia muffler arid wiping hia face and neck with a silk handkerohief. 'That lout of a boy understands his buisness, I've no doubt,' replied his oousin ; ' but our host's a long time at that ?whisky jar. What a queer nlS nlace it is.' he added : ' verv iollv on a fine day, though, I should think.'.' ' And very comfortable on a wet one,' observed O'Maille, still polishing his face until it almost reflected the glow of the ruddy turf fire before them. 'I wonder what my boy ia doing ?' ho added, always pleased to think of others when himself content. 'Making love under the rose to Miss Selwyn at her father's house in London, I'll be bound,' exclaimed Maurice. 'So he didn't , want me with him,' he added, ' although it's the first time Owen has crossed the Channel without asking me to biear him company.' '(Well he might do. worse than marry Grace, 'observed O'Maille good-naturedly. ' Squire Selwyn iB rich, and — that's the stuff, landlord.' ? 'Whisky, gentlemen, and the horses are dbin' '; f amous; my Terry says; for, though he's rather deaf of hearin', he knows how to groom a horse wld the beat of em*.

Here's the steel, sir,, if the carver needs a re moinder. We're slackest in the evening — nobody, but a few of the neighbours to smoke a quiet pipe by the chimney corner, there. But they'll stick to their homes on such a noight as this. Hark to it, yer. honours, it's raiain' in torrents. And if ; ye'd prefer the lamp, I'll just draw the , curtains; unless my boy Terry's forgot - the wick again. Terry's back'ard in: many things, being rather deaf of' hearin'.' So saying, he pinned together some : old chintz ^which did duty for curtains,; and lighting a paraffin lamp placed it in the centre of the table. . ? ? . i ' Now, gintlemen, maybe ye'd like some ahtowt.

He can't hear; what1 he' does, yer see, gintlemen';' but he meanB well, my boy.' ' ' | ' Just so,' observed O'Maille. 'We'll try the stout.' ' , ' 'Sure an' I can ricommend it to yer honours ; and if yer want the horses got ready to-night ? ' ... ; The travellers exchanged^ significant glances, for as a matter of course they had resolved to remain at the inn until the morning, and so expressed their wiBh, to the landlord's satisfaction and their own. ''Now, Maurice, my boy,' exclaimed O'Maille, with just a sense of amusement in hia tone, as the landlord disappeared; 'let me asaiat you to some of our host's good fare.' ? But even as he spoke both travellers .were startled by a lurid and unearthly flash ot light which for an instant per vaded the room. ' Acoming stormy' Maurice exclaimed. 'I thought we should have it before nightfall. And there's, its accompani ment,' he added, as a . peal .of thunder grumbled overhead and slowly ' rolled ' away. . ' ' Bess is always frightened at a storm,' exolaimed O'Maille, concerned for the safety of his favourite mare. 'lhope that ,' deaf-of-hearing' boy won't let her break her legs.' 'Shall I go and see V asked Maurioe rising.. .' 'No, nonsense ; the idea on such, a night.' .,._,.' ..: . , ??; ''.' ' But Maurice Winterton had crossed, to the casement, and, drawing baok the cur tains, was peering out into the darkened night when alow ory of surprise,: or fear, escaped him, ,. . ? ..??'? ?' What's the matter V. asked O'Maille, turning in his chair and drooping his fork. ?'???- :? ?' 'Nothing much. A face looking in at the window, and preBaed against the glasa.'' '';'.''? ? j 'Some inquiaitive neighbpur, likely, or tho landlord's son,' observed O'Maille. ' No,' . exclaimed Maurice, emphati cally. 'It was a face familiar to me, the face of a man I saw last in the com pany of your son, the face of — don't laugh, Michael.' , -; . , ? ' 'No,', was the serious rejoinder.' 'The face of whom?' ( ' Laurence Selwyn !' , ' Impossible ! ' cried'O'Maille. .?'. Lau rence Selwyn,' ? he repeated, 'is in London. Owen is Btaying with 'him ? at this moment. He — Grace's father — here 1 You must be mistaken, Maurice. Try this bacon,' he added, with quite a relish, prepared to dismiss the subject and the face at the window as tho common ourioaity of some begging tramp. . 'You're mistaken, Maurice, mistaken.' 'Of ? course— mistaken,' murmured Winterton, returning , to 'his s seat. ' Impossible ! ' he added, -in an undelr breatb, ' I am not mistaken. .; Though . ia a squalid wretched garb., the. ;faoe^ via Lautenoe Selwyn'a.

' What possible motive could Laurence Selwyn have for ' ; masquerading in such a garb, at suoh a ' place, on such a night?' he wondered, confident of a sure and certain recognition. ^ For there are Bome faces whioh, once '? seen, ' impress themselves upon one's memory for a lifetime.. Laurence Selwyn's , face' was one of these, and had so im pressed itself upon the mind of Maurioe Winterton, possessing as it did,;an unfor tunate birth-mark, of whioh more dri'on, . rendering forgetfulnesa or resemblance in another a thing impossible. . ? . ? ? Therefore the discovery visited Maurice with a gloomy reticence for hours. So night succeeded, evening, and the. meal being removed O'Maille sat before the fire talking long and cordially of the .past, the present, and the future of his son ; but observing at last tbe strange and un L.
