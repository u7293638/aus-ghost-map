^7 Notes for town and Country pur ON POLE BY TANTALUS. ^ IT is very irritating to the rußhlights oE our Assembly that thosV newspaper fellows should distinctly make statements of political impor tance before they (tht rushlights) become awaro of the facts. There ii that visit of our versatile Premier to Amerioa anl the old country, for in stance. It was pretty well known last week that Sir Henry was going-that the doctors who keep a run of his physical system told him he must go, or risk the consequences, that he has become literally used up with the nagging and worry of political life; and that, to make the most of the stamina still in him, a long trip by sea, new scenes, and complete severance from tho grind to which he has been subjected, were recommended. The Premier took tho advice offered. Be saw its force, and determined to go. That there might be less chance of drawing back, a passage was taken in the Californian mail steamer sailing on tho 29th. Sir Henry, " therefore, will just, .hare tluoo to spend Christmas at horne hore in the colony, see tho Christmas issue of the TOWN AND COTJNTRT (which, I am told, will he something unusual), and then off for his holi day. Peace be with him. T expect we will get along very well in his absence, for it is surprising how men glide into holding the helm of the State, and hold it very well too. I hope he'll have a good time, and if ho don't come back, that he may be able to get that seat in tho greater House at Westminster whioh it is rumoured he is hankering after. It was said in last week's Notes he was going, and if hon. members desire to verify the situation, instead of wasting time in Parliament, a «all in at the office of the Pacific Mail Co. will enlighten them (if that's what they want). Tnere's a list there of the passengers booked for the outgoing boat, and the name of Sir Henry Parkes is amongst the lot. " Tips" are not much in my way, but tho most beautiful thing of the kind I ever got has been spoiled. Here have I been labouring away at a Note concerning tho visit of the Premier to Eng land (after doing America). That same Note is before me, and it winds up with the startling dis closure that the main object of that visit was to select Bix of the perfect order of god- like mortals described during the dobates on tho Sydney Magistrates' Bill as being of tho ealibre suit able to sit and dispense justice in the Sydney police courts. But it's all off now, as the Bportfl say. I hadn't an idea, you see, that there sat around, or lay spread out on the Assembly honchos during Monday night, the full number of incipient can didates who considered themselves fit and cap able persons to fill tho billets in question. And that sticking out of tho coat pockets, or depos ited in the drawers of other hon. members were letters and testimonials from three times as many aspirants lor those police magistrateships as there are chairs to fill. When to that con tingent is added two or three aspiring members of the Upper House, who believe they could still do their country service-for ¿800 a yoar- and quito a crowd of outsiders whoBO ambition has boen fired l y the eloquent descrip tions of model police magistrates, there is no occasion whatever for tho Premier to beat up tho elite of England for right and proper persons. That's where tho point of my Noto is blunted. It is almost startling to find we have such numbers of high-toned mortals amongst us who are flowing over with tho sorb of wisdom whioh henceforth is (that is, soon as provision for paying tho screw is made) to decorate the magisterial honchos of Sydney. I thought every one of thoso wonderful beings described by tho Government would have to bo imported, and all my lamentation that we had no such mon amongst ourselvos is labour lost. Tho mon aro hero, and eager to commonco opera tions, and draw tho paltry salary immortalised in tho pages of " Hansard " by tho eloquent mem ber for Shoalhaven. On Tuesday, -when tho Assembly mat. Mr. Cameron went for b^meone whom he supposed had jeen saying m the pa^Wrs untrue things of him is chairman of committees. Tho explanation was Not a succeBB. Mr. Cameron's efforts'bf that kind »Jdom are. On Tuesday he put »nore foot in it th« the bulk of his body would warrant, ana t'orfct all about a good old aphorism that abase is not tegument. Such words as ** blackguard " flo nobsovnd weii fromtheohairmanof committees of New Suth WaleB. Thero\eing something in the form of a cruelty to animaiKorganisation in this colony of ours, for goodness slte j.et them overhaul the cattle carried in our railwy* trucks. Until I saw those dena of cruel torture\the belief was on me that it was more humanoNp aend cattle by rail than travel them from, sayWellington. But a trip over the Sahara, with d&th; by the way, would bo luxury for bullooks in comparison with a voyage in those truckB. They're frightful, and very much in keep ing with our railwayÑrrangements generally. The said tracks are not wio^enough for grown bullocks, to start with, and af tex a journey of 100 miles or less the tortured occupants ore found to be barked all . round the ruup and tail j the head and knees als > present masses and patches oE raw .kin. So muoh for cattle who are able to hold out upon their legs during a journey.' If they go down, and many do, the other occupants of the car crowd upon or trample them. It is horribly cruel, and I should like to see some of those who are responsible arrested and made to pay the penalty of cruelty to animals. Constitu tional government enables. a majority to do as they can manag9 with minorities. But deliberate torture and injury to the carcasses of cattle are not covered by the constitution. There's aohance for the eruelty to animals society to go in and do a genuine service, and improve the cattle cars. As explained nicely by the following letter, " BaokBlock" thinks that there are bank clerks who do manage to koop honest on JB200 a year. Being of precisely the same belief, space for his letter is mado with pleasure : Tbat was a rory fair ont Ly you at tho twaddle indulgod ia regarding1 tho stinginess ol bank directors in paying low salaries to tboir dorks. The faofc is they would bavo twioo as many as tboy can próvido stools for at nothing at all per annum, Tho honour and (flory of having Augustus, or Harry, or ÏTred, or some other of tho family lu a bank is quito enough for crowds of tho weak kneed, who would Btarvo aud pinch themselves, and put tho poor lads iu tho way of temptation in order to be gouteel. Who is to blamo that the banks aro flooded and postorod with applicants for "a position rather than salary P" Tlioy would run all tho risks rather than faoo the manly but roughor occupations opon to colonial boys. Still I haven't a doubt thoro aro thousands of honost bank dorks who do not got mora, and many of thom loss, than £200 a year.
