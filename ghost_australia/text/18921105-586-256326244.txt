SnBfMTOSIfiHT, THE CAPTAIN'S PERIL. CHAPTER II (CONTINUED). Caplaiu Guiageat wasno coward, bat, -standing there, in the room of that lonely - inn, with the-knowledge thst a murdered corpse lay beneath the bed, and he, too, might soon be attacked, he felt bis nwea quiver with excitemcut The light -. had fallen on the side of the alcove, and be saw there a line descending jierpcndicularly along the wdl to the- ground. The paper that covered it «me of an intricate pattern, and it was at this spot shade J by the ample drapery of--the bed He approached closer; and the' light fell on the wall. He .saw then that the per- . peudicular- line which bad attracted Irs attention formed one side of a welldefined doorway cunningly matched into the pattern of the paper. He touched it, and it -shook slightly, bat it was securely fastened on the outside. Lie stopped with an inroluntaiygasp. What was the meaning of a door so artfully contrived and in so strange a position ? He gnessed-cleariy enough. The other door, with its obtrusive fastenings, was- bat- adevice to delude the occupant of the room into fancied security. At any- moment, and probably without any previous warning, the secret di«or might open, and he would then be at the mercy of treacherous assassins. He saw with dismay that he was caught like a mouse in a trap. What could he do ? He stood and thought. With futile regret he remembered bis faithful dog shut up in the stable outside, and deplored the easy confidence with which he had consented to their separation. Caasar was no. msan antagonist, and, had the gallant animal hcen beside him, • he-might - haw kept the ruffians-at hay But.now the odds against him were Suddenly an idea flashed across his misdL. U-was-horrible and daogerous, but he thought it might possibly succeed, and Jtbere was not much time for deliberation, for-th»--peril was presing. Therefore be proceeded hurriedly 4o carry-out tueghastly plan that suggested'itself. He drew forth the bale of carpeting from under the bed, and with hasty handnn wound the lifeless body from the * «Iusiy folds. It had been partly stripped, omd a deep red stain on the leftside of the undcr-cSothing showed that death : Ind resulted from a -stab snreJy aimed at lie heart. He lifted the body carefully on tothe bed, closed the glassy eyes, aad laid, the dead. man. down in an wtfcitade-that lookedUkenatuial repose; ^he left side lay-uppermost, and the left arm was thrown over the head, leaving "the side- defenceless ; then he drew-the ^coverings. well up so as to shade tbe ••paUorofihelifelesslace. He trusted that, when the assassins mpfinrrfl. rr they certainly would, to .serve him as-thcy bad done the other, in their guiliy -hany-they would not think of looking closely at the figure lying in the lied, and that thus the murderous knife would be-o»d i apoa*the.-dead. instead of . upBB^theiliving md^rew-titt folds of,(he cwpet jNeetiaUyrtvcc^uin.

No one came near the chamber during tbe rest of the night. The - woauded man needed all the care of the other, and it wa« hoi likely that they would risk another encounter with C®sar unaided. It seemed therefore that there were not any other accojip'.ices within call. Subsequent' examination of the stable door gave the due pretty plainly. The hksp that had held the bolt was found on-the ground, and the bolt was hanging useless on the door. The nails that had held the hasp were old and rusty, and must; have given way under the repeated shocks given by the dog as he sprang with violence against the door, which was fastened, and his keen scent maid promptly guide him to his master's side. At Jength the gray dawn came creeping in "through the nnshutteied windows, and Captain Golugent completed his preparations for departure. A distant tinkling made him "aware that the world iwas beginning to star, and that other human beings were awake and probably not far oG. The cheerful sound of-the toukltug bells came nearer, and he found to his satisfaction that it proceeded from the teams of some waggoners, who after-a while appeared within sight, and drew-np at the door of the inn to water theirliorses.

An ashy hue overspread the baidened fsce, and terror made him drop the - glass is his- hand. He thought it was the ghost of his victim that 6tood before him. ^ Bring me my-hotse 1" said Captain Golugent, with stern brevity, vouchsa&g; no word of explanation. he man <did not wait to be told a ind time, and, ioniiig fastened tbe bridle^f the horse to a hook by the «lunkawayeUent1y. The waggoners looked on curiously s the offix»r moualed his horse < and rode . away sternly and silently ; but he judged It '<risest not to gralify their evident curiosity.
