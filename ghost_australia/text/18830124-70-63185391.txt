')The'NeW; South 'Wales team then 'went 'iny-and when; the stumps were drawn on the first day Ban-;, nunnan and-Murdoch had scored;'76 between;' them. Massio was caught off tho first ball.; On the second day, although in the first . part; of the game our cousins over the border ap-! peared to have matters pretty mucljutheir own ?way, the day's play closed with much better prospects for ^Victoria. The not put man, Murdoch and Bannerman, resumed their innings. Both men Increased their . scores materially, and 130 was totalled - . be fore Murdoch was caught at the: wickets, after making 71 in brilliant ,? style. . Ban-v nerman made 78 before he was run out; nnd after the departure of these two douphty batsmen several wickets fell without much of an addition to the score.

Massie made 51 before he was caught, and Bannerman and' Murdoch kept up.. their wickets for the rest of the day with 51 and 55 respectively, so that only one wicket luis fallen for 165, or 108 behind the Victorian aggregate. The local men bowled ?well throughout the day, but the fielding was loose at' times, and more than one chance of disposing of a batsman was missed. The attendance was fairly 'good, and the excellence' of the New ' South Wales batting was freely . .. acknowledged from, all partB. of the ground. On the fourth day, Murdooh increased his ; score to 07, when he-was caught by Boyle off Bruce's' bowling, and 'Davis added 15 to the score. Jones and Bannerman then became associated, nnd made the required number 'of runs without being separatedâ€” tho former being not out 25, and the latter not out 101, compiled during six hours' stay at the wickets.
