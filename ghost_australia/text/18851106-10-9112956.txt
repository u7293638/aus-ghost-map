SPRING MEETING-, ( j ' ' [BY SUBMARINE CABLE.] "M [FROM OUR OWN, CORRESPONDENT.] j ' ", MELBOURNE, Thursday, j , There was a greater attendance than usual at the third day's races, "The weather' was agreeable, though clouds of dust ron defend the outing unpleasant at times. His Excellency the Governor and party were again present. There were small fields for the weight for and events, which made the races less interesting than on other days'. The favourites started at long odds on, and there was only one boil over,' that of Venus in the Flying Stakes, which was due to the filly being blocked in the run. ¡ In the last race an accident occurred similar to that which happened in the Caul Gold Cup, though much less disastrous. In the event Veteran Stakes Grace Darling fell, bringing down the horses Doncaster and Kingship. Doncaster was killed, and all three jockeys were badly shaken, Williams, who was piloting Grace Darling, being most severely hurt. The injured legs were taken to their several homes. The following are the particulars of the running :- ! MAIDEN PLATE. J A sweepstakes of 10 sovs each, 2 ft., with 250 added. The second horse to receive SOaova, out of the stake.

To everybody's surprise, Denmark came down at the third jump at the back of the course, escaping from his rider, who caught and remounted him half-a-mile behind, but at the fence in the straight he came down again. He was again mounted. Then, at fence where Denmark first fell, both Trickett and Banker fall, the former turning a somersault. The former was mounted and, had the race in hand, but he came into the course proper too soon, missing the last jump, altogether. Banker, who was caught after some delay, was remounted and came the correct course, cantering in a quarter of a mile behind' Trickett, and Denmark followed, about 200yds, away. A protest was entered, and the place given to "Banker. Denmark's backers were much disappointed.

As the horses left the starter and passed 'the stand Grace Darling, who got on well, came down. Doncaster fell over her, and was killed. Kingship also stumbled, and dislodged the jockey. How Williams escaped being killed is a miracle, as all the field seemed to go over him. The rest of the horses went on round the back of the course. Tom Brown and Ravensworth in leading positions. The Agent was first in the straight, when Cerise and Blue got to the front, but Britisher supplanted her, and finished a winner by a length. Time 3. 2min. 38sec. Britisher was largely backed in doubles with Trenton. The concluding day's racing takes place to-morrow (Saturday).
