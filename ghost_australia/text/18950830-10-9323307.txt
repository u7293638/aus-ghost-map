BEAUTIFUL BRITAIN. Part VI, of this Art Series is now ready for distribution, and if it is possible to make comparison where all things are perfection, this particular number excels those preced . ing it in the special presentment of charming views of interiors. There is likely to be a run for this particular issue of the series, and those who book orders early will ensure freedom from disappointment. (Copies of previous parts are still obtainable from all Agents in Tasmania.) The famous wit, Horace Walpole, summarised very neatly the absurdity of spook tories when he said, in speaking of the dilapidated condition of Ham House, that it was " in such a state of p cap and tatiara, barricaded-with walls, trees and gates, that one could imagine oneself in the midst of bygone ages, " and that he expected to see ghosts " sweep by him-" g mala, too, that would not give a sixpence to see, Lauder titles and Tollemache a and Maitland a Thereafter all, are very few ghosts among all those with which tradition endows the old homes of England that would be worth seeing if one really could see them. And yet the ghost stories in themselves, full of the quaintness of the past century, make very pleasant reading, as do indeed many of the other excursions into the by-ways of history, which readers of our " Beautiful Brussels " Portfolio find described for their benefit.
