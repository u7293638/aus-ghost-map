SELECT POETRY. ON THE SUN IN ENGLAND. By an Anglo-Australian Poet. [Written in London.] Have you ever set eyes on an English sun? For ten days that he's hidden, he shews his face--one, When his hue is a sort of dirty dun. Envelop'd in clouds, and in vapour dress'd, He gets up in the east, and goes down in the west-- At least they say so, For I really don't know That I every yet saw him set or rise, Swaddl'd up as he is in the dingy skies. I did see him once in the month of June Peep into my lodgings at twelve at noon; But the clock scarce struck ere the struggling ray, Fled like a frighted ghost away, And never since then, and never before, Has he shone forth bright, And I guess that his light Is withdrawn from Englard for ever more! I'll blow out my brains--I shall--I shall! Or plunge into Paddington's bright canal, Or get the blue devils, at least I'm sure If these suicidal days endure; For the wind howls loud in a funeral note, As the smoke-befoul'd air! tries to stop up my throat. I love those climes of a softer kind Where Nature herself seems pleased in mind, Nor sulks, as here, Through the long, long year, With the clouds for a frown and the rain for a tear; Where the air is free, and all blue the sky: Not a breeze below--not a cloud on high, And the sun beams forth with his rays unshorn, From the first red break of the balmy morn, To the spot where the shades of eve are born, And flowers and fruits in their unforced birth But here, the whole ground's but one big bog-- The sky's like dirt, and the air's all fog, And it seems wherever I turn to fly, That an easterly wind runs into my eye; And when death shall have taken me far away, These lines shall my graven tomb-stone show-- "Here in quiet doth lie a poor devil below, Who died of an English day."
