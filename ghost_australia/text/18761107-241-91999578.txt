CORRESPO-DENCE. [It is to be distinctly understood that we do not identify ourselves with the opinions of our correspondents.-EDITOR.] COLAC AMATEUR TURF CLUB. (TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.) SmR,-I notice a letter in the Colac Herald of Friday last, in which reference is made to the illegal manner of electing the officers for the Colac Amateur Turf Club races on Boxing Day. I quite agree with the writer of that letter, "Jorrocks's Ghost," that the officers and stewards were elected illegally, and that the members should have had a voice in their election. I notice that Ihave been appointed a steward, but I would rather that someone else was appointed in my place. I would suggest that the stewads now appointed take some steps, so that this cause of dissatisfac tion might be removed. We are still desirous, I imagine, that the club should not fall back, and the chief way toCaccomplish this object is for all to work in iuison. It is to be hoped that the members of the club will be conciliated by a revision of the late illegal election, and that all will work together to make the races a success. I'am, sir, &c.;, E.
