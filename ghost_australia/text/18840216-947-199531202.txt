ECHOES 0F: MELBOURNE , '.', [By The Ghost.] . At an early period;, of the ; last Parlia menjajtry session the,- honourable and gallant Major , who represents' Ballarat arinouricod ,that . although ho ? considered* that while, thp business which had' fallen in arrear during the preceding. Ministry was being transacted it was. the: duty of the,' Liberal' members .; tOj- support, the ftnvfirrimRTifc. hn should consider himself at lib.erty after the prorogation to adopt any course he might deem it 'expedient totake. Of courBe the meaning of this enunciation was.perfeptly clear. Major Smith, who was, always included in the;. lists of the coalition ;; team handed -about, by the qwfLn^ncs, discovered when the' numbers were iip that ho was not among the selected, and, .fancied himself — and sooth/.-to say with, some reason—rthrown over by Ms, in- timate, ally, Mr. Berry, in, order to please' MrVService. It would hardly ,- have been ; politic ,.$q sit in Opposition,, and. . having to ' take a back seat ' behind the Ti'easury, bench,, was decidedly- infra dig .in, one .who had, so often occupied the coveted place | of,(,,honour i immediately '?, on : the Speaker's right hand. Major Smith, ,it was generally rgmarked by frequenters of ; therAssembiy.n^rer looked, at home- in : , his rearward position.' : It will not cause much surprise therefore to hear that in pursuance of his 'intimation to the. House Major Smith: is actively! . engaged ,in ?. marshalling the . ranks of an Qpposition, destined in -the, course ,of events, at! a period, more - or less; remote,, itself to assume the reins of office.

And a great (.number 'off people, too. 'indolent perhaps, to .be, at -the trouble of contradicting, andr-ras . the niul- - '? iitude generally is^— ready to accede to!any , proposition, however falacious, so it 'be but boldly and persistently uttered, lend' credit ,, to the. assertion. Their! -.faith ?in the, so-called axiom i would most assuredly have been subjected to a shock quite as severe as any suffered in the very latest .railway; collision had they chanced during, the last week to have journeyed to Geelorig. There the announcement that 'Dr;' Anna Potta intended to deliever a lecture, to which the admittance was free, drew together the largest audience j that ever graced, the interior of the hall- of the Mechanics' Institute of 'the Pivot.' ' So pleased ? was , ' the, doctor ' at the attend ance, that, on the next evening, she gave another gratis exhibition, at which ?: the. number of : visitors was in excess even, of that at the former gathering. ?. Next night there was a charge for admission,; when only some fifty peoplo paid at the doors! Does not this prove, conclusively; the.un-. truthfulness of the old saying anent cheap1: pleasures ? Believe me, there are others besides the Gilpin family, who in the matter , of amusements have 'a frugal mind.'' , 'deadheads ' are not so dead as their name would imply, !'; -. . *-' Notwithstanding thei ungallant conduct of tne Medical Board; of Victoria. in re fusing to recognise the medical credentials of Mrs. Anna Potts, and to place that lady's name among the list of 'persons licensed to cure— or kill — in Victoria, the unauthorised shermedico , interviews and prescribes for a large number of patients.' One of the leading Melbourne practitioners ?? was asked the other day why 'the pro fession' did not take stops to prevent the continuance of what in some quarters is re garded, as , a usurpation of vested rights,. ' Why don't you institute proceedings ?.'? queried a friend. : ' Heaven forbid,' re plied the son of ' Escukepius, and closing one eye, and placing the first digi ? of his right Hand alongside his nose (after the: approved and ancient fashion of jokists), he added, 'Why, you see, the more patients she has, the inore business for us.' Which answer— not tq put too fine a point on i. it, as the saying is— -is rather rough, on. the Philadelphia^ M.D, ',!
