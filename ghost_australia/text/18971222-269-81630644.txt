<TK place was Tal /botj, at b e rwise Back Creek, '"n Victoria.. The precise ^pot %as the snug pal lor at tike "back of the " dispensary in Mrs Barr's com Portable hotel, "The Glasgow * Arms." The weather "was exeeraible, rain falling heavily. The whisky was unexceptional, and the party assemb led in the snug parlor consisted of Mr Wilson, a Melbourne barrister, old James the photographer, Mr Hill, of Ballarat, and your humble servant. I had given a mesmeric entertain ment that night for the benefit of the Amherst Hospital, having long before discovered I possessed considerable power that way. Tiie weather had been wretched, yet the audience was good, and. the show passed off with some eclat, and I was awiarded a vote of thanks. Just now the talk was upon mes merism, clairvoyancy, will-power, etc. Mr .Wilson . shook his head and said little or nothing. James scratch ed his, as mucli as to say, he agreed With WiLson, but Hill, who had not been present at my entertainment, point blank declared such things were all -nonsense. . I felt nettled with Hill's doiib tings, and just then Mrs Barr shut the front door, as the old Sergeant of Police, having .satisfied himself. that all was quiet outside, called In for his night cap and stood for a minute talking to the landlady. " Dook here, Hill," I said, " you talk a*bout these things being- non sense. . The sfergeant will waart a drink', *ahd counting 'Mrs Barr, fihat will make six. Now I'll prove to you there is something'in will-power." "How?" he asked. "Look," I continued, "there ere several things on tilie bar counter. Th^« ,a Jboifle ^f "wtiteky, a cork, a bottle of water, two'glasses, a large and a small one, and the wooden things they use for opening aerated trater bottles. I'll'bet six drinks thiat I- will ask the sergeant to touch any one of those he likes, and he shall touch first which ever article you choose to "mention." "It's a wager," said Pill, "provided you give hiim no cue ;_make. him touch the corik." "I'll give him no cue, as you shall see," and I then asked the sergeant if lie. would kindly decide a small Wager. ; "Certainly, if I can. (What-is it?" he replied. " Simply this," I continued, " There are several things on the counter," and here t enumerated them. "We just want you to walk up, and touch one of them.' "Touch one of them, is it. Which one ?" " Whfch ever you like. Touch one of thefif." - - '. ? -i?,« Bedad," s&H; ithe. jovial ser geant, laying hold of the cork, "this is out of place, when the wtiieky Wte," . ' - i:? i ? "Right,'' I said, "six glassess if jfcxi please, Mrs Barr, for you it*?* and while we laughed, 'Mr paid, "and insisted it was only a coincident. I persisted it was nothing &f; 4b sort, alid Wilson and James iagreM it was a -curious but very fait test, ; The wind and rain outside wkr4 having a rare time of it and, 0s Mrs Bart put another log on the fire, Mr Wilson invited us to a final glalSs, \-- I then offered to tell them of ;a matter th£± occurred some years back, and for the truth of which I -could vbuch. The offer was accepted, the glagseg were replenished, the bar lights wete turned out, and t began : r . " It was just before the first <?afele was laid afcooss the Irish Chaliiiei that the Irish m$il packet <m£ brought the news ot a dreadful mu*de£ perpetrated at the Dublin Kaitwiay Station. The particulars were as folhy#^: The station master being absent fikftn business one morning, and it beit^ As certained he had not been jypre all night, attektioflL "0 his private room at frhestatiai£. There were two. doors to that room: one opening on to th£ platform and the other. into the passenger booking oi&ee.; Both do'ors were. locked but a shreWd young cletfc -by applying his eye to file keyholes, discovered that both keys were inside " the room. Out side inspection show^the only win dow was «hut, and it was known it IV#' s<^-fe6.tenin& oh * the inside. Ate" the missing man "indulged" occasionally, tlie; dk>bfs were well thumped, and the platform bell loudly rung, but as no answer could be elicited, the (deputy station master invoked the assistance .of. the police and one of the doors was burst open. The station master's body WSLS found on the floor in a pool of Mood, the throat being cut and hacked about in a xireadful manner, as well as the face jagged wijth the weapon tised, which also lay on the floor, arid was an ordinary small-bladed office knife with a long handle. . The sight was anything but a plea sant one, for 1>lood was spattered in ali directions, and the contents of the wash basin iii the corner of the room showed the murderer had washed his hands previous to leaving. The money the unfortunaite onan was known to have 4aken into his room the previous night to count and then lock isp in the safe^ amounting to over £300, was missing, and a med ical man ceDtified that death had oc- - curred iome hours previous ^lo the dis covery of the body. - Please be&r; In mind that both doors Swfcefl witj} PUP fcejps ia side, and the only window, which was very Mgli up. was shut and fastened insrde with "a spring catch, aM could hot be opened from the outside. ? Day . af ter day the Diibl'in papers commented i^pon this extraordinary jease, and the English papers copied tiieit? reports and made their own com ments, but the police were completely at tf&uit;, iii fact,, they had not the ghost of a clue, nor _ did there seem any probability of them finding one. ]p§ht or nSoedays after fhemurder, a gentleman called on the Inspector ot Police in Liverpool. The .gentleman's name was Plaek, and the Inspector knew him to be a Retired merchant of means, who lived a few miles from the city. Mr Flack had come for a distinct purple. He said he thoughthe could \- possibly throiw some $fehtOTK>n thie mysterious murder of DubllSi Rail way station master, if the In^ectot would listen to him. ._ The Inspector would be pleased to do so. i ^ » v The murder took (place on of last month, June, Mr flack thought. jThe inspector said) the date wa& corr«?t /'It took place about half past six in the morning, 'Mr Flack said. The Inspector was not prepared Either to aJcfemit-or dispute that. Mr Mack then asked a singular Question "Did the. Inspector believe in clairvoyance." The official was very decided In his answer-he did not. Mr Flack expressed regret at such "unbeiief, but with the Inspector's per state his case. The lnspector begged him to do '-'SO. ' Mr Flackthen remarked fhat on ; his part, he wa» convfin'ce'd .of the existence of what is called clalr voyancy? and he had, at his house and living with his family, a young lady who was clairvoyant. It" happened ; that afrout six o'clock on the 27th. of the previous month, June, he had mes merised this young lady, and while she was In a suitable condition he bad - directed Jict to Ddblin. He explained' $hat 'he desired to despatchher intelligence, not her body, some distance, froim the Irish capital, and; as he had never been in Ireland, Jite intention was to'make her follow the railway line until she came to the place he wished, and which she would know' by the words "railway siatioh": painted in .Baztge fetters ^n a bbsuj^ above the platform. Upon finding the Dublin railway station (in her clairvoyant state) she uttered violent screams and gave vent to such ejaculations as : "Oh !, the ,ths-ef ."*' "Oh ! he!&; mucdering^Tiim "Oh, God! the wretch !" plainly show ing she wis witnessing, some scene of horror. Finally she jwent off into a hysterical fit; and had toi*e quieted with sundry parses and left in a "quiet sleep to recover hetself., It was only the previous day that Mr Flack , had perused the details of the Dublin rafilway station murdieiy and noted flie date of it. Ihthatdate: he saw a coincidence.; Again he put the young lady in a imesmerac state, and painfully, with every sign of hor ror, she recounted what she-had seefc on the 27th of June. \- - She described the murder and how the murderer escaped from the rooau Mr Fla<ck stated that a sense of duty impelled hlmto inform the Inspector, nag If he fbcugfct it wotffc wMte &e; was at liberty toheariiheyoung lady, while inthe mesmeric stater flescribg the mur^r andthe - ;; The Inspector askedif lie was at liberty to bring 4i ? v Mr Flack extendedhis Invitation .to a 1* The inspector asked if Mr .Flack was learning home ait once. : .;.. ; p Mr FlaCk^s business - iu" Liverpofi for the presolit was finlgtiedV-hewf going straight home. - * The Inspector thatiked hiiqiv would follow; Mm in half anhonr.
