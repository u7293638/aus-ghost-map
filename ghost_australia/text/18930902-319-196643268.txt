He was too just and true to throw over Kainie. He may think ill of me, but I do not think so badly of him. I tried to buy of her tho rights she had in him, but oho would not sell them. Then I saw it was all up between Mark and me."1 ; "This iB strange— this is very Btrange !" said Drownlaads, turning a (porplexed. face on the girl as he paced the room.

A The justices will W»nt their toasting-forks," . . ' " Keep them amused for a while. . They shall witness my now wilL" Zita proceeded to her room, fonnd the artioles that she had promised, and descended to tho sitting room, where elie found three of the magistrates, all laymen ; the olerioal members of tho bonch thinking it unccolesiastioal to oome after toasting forks. The red faced chair man, Mr. Christian, was there, Admiral Abbott and another named Wilkins. They wore all, merry ; they had been drinking, and they felt SonBiblo relief:that they were not eumbered by the presence of the ecolesiautical magistrates. They were also oonsoious of groat buoyanoy of spirits, due to tho foot that they were beyond tno shadow of tho towers of Ely, and no longer within the numbing oifole of cathedral decorum. Zito's arrival .. was bailed uproariously with lauehter arid loud: words. The gentlemen jumped from their ohairs, .and with effusion insisted op Blinking hands. " Wo'vo rodo over," said Mr. Christian, "but couldn't -persuade.- Sir Bates to mount a horse again. Tha voryilooka of one makes biB-oolor fade. Nothing would induce him — not the pro-' speot of u toasting fork." I-.eay, Abbott, if -wo could have promised the canon n kiss off those mbyTipe, eh? Would that 'have drawn him?
