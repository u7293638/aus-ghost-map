Ita sail flapped lazily in the light lucid, gleamed white in the glare of the Southern sunshine, from which he and Edith were partially sheltered by the scant shadows of the palmetto grove Sometimes it deemed almost like a dream to them both that they should be together among the palm trees of this semi-tropical South they who had parted (it seemed but yesterday, and se' >' was years ago 1) among the Northern pines Yes, years ago ! but " Ruined love when it is built anew Grows stronger than at first.

You should have told me before, Edith I would not have inflicted myself on you for so long" She did not turn her eyes towards him, but he, bending to look Boorchmgly in her face, saw them fill Slowly with tears, saw the full red lips quiver. " Don't cry, Edith 1 " he said hastily, almost parallel), with a thrill of suppressed passion in Illalone " You must not cry. If you do, I-I can't answer for myself." I know men' can never bear the sight of tears," she said, controlling herself immediately, with a watery smile. "I can't stand the sight of yours," he replied. " Other women may cry their fill but you ! You will miss me, Edith ? You have not forgotten? you are not one of the women who forget " The worse for me," she said bitterly. " W li} should it he the worse Look things in the face, Edith I" he added, with sudden abandonment, as if desperately dashing aside and casting off a restraint till now all powerful, "We were cheated out of each other !
