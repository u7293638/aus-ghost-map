CHAPTER V. We trust the reader has not forgotten the eccentric stranger who first informed Hyacinth of the supernatural visitors haunting the estate. 'Flittermouse !' exclaimed the General, as the new- comer entered, "who's that ?" 'A runaway knock,' said Flittormouse, for such was the name of the speaker—who, with little ceremony, seated himself at the table, and lifted to his plate the thigh of a turkey. 'I say, gentlemen,' he observed,' after the first mouthful, 'are you all ready with your rents ; for I can tell ye our landlord is among us!' 'Among us'!' was the general shout — and Peppercorn sat frozen to his chair. 'That is, he will be, for he's sent his bedding. I say, General—ha! ha! we must strike our tents.' ' What is this?' asked the General, with great dig- nity. ' Speak,' Flittermouse. What danger threatens the tranquillity of our happy fireside? What oppression menaces our bond of brotherhood? Rents'! Gracious Powers ! Rents:!' ' Would our pen could shew the dis- gust in every face save that of'Peppercorn, at the word. ' Speak, Flittermouse,' adddd the General, with the air of an emperor. ' You see, I was coming home, when I overtook Sheep- skin's man— I knew him, because I used to go with the show to 'Sheepskin's' at Christmas.; only I lost his custom, in the fight with the devil and the lawyer, I wouldn't give the lawyer the best of it.
