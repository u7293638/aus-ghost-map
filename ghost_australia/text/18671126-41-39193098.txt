WALLAROO. (From the Wallaroo Times) Bushfires have commenced their ravages in this neighbourhood. A large extent of country was on fire on Wednesday, near Ninnes Plains, and on the same day dense volumes of smoke were seen rising not far from Tickara. Grass is so abundant on the Peninsula, and is now getting so dry, that it is feared squatters and farmers will suffer severely during the coming summer from bush fires. There has lately been considerable mortality among the fowls in Wallaroo. Some virulent disease has attacked numbers of them with fatal results. We hear of scores dying daily; when once attacked they rarely recover. Nothing in the shape of physic has yet been found to be ft any benefit to them. One symptom of the disease uppears to be a paralysis of the legs, for after being attacked the fowls are unable to stand— they fall down, and in the course of an hour or two give up the ghost. If this epidemic continues, people will have to go upon short commons in respect of poultry at Christmas. A rather serious accident happened to Captain Duncan on Thursday. He was returning with his family from the neighbourhood of Watervale in an American wagonette, and just as he was nearing Wallaroo he stood up in the vehicle to look around, and the wheels went over a stump. Before Captain Duncan could recover himself a second jolt tbrew him out of the vehicle, and both wheels passed over his chest, breaking one of his ribs. He managed to drive home, and Dr. Sholl being immediately sent for attended to his injuries. Captain Duncan, although suffering a good deal, is not dangerously hurt. It is singular that on the up-journey, about six weeks ago, the whole party —Mrs. Duncan, the children and servant, and Captain Duncan— were all capsized near Whitwarta, but none of them were hurt.
