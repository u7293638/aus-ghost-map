CHILDREN'S CORNER Two Little Jacobites. (From the North British Journal.) It was a gusty stormy evening in the spring of the year 1746. The fiery red clouds that lingered in the sky after the sun had set paled slowly, and darkness was settling down over Craigearn, an old castle perched high above the waters of one of the many "lochs" that indent the weat coast of Scotland. As the brightness faded out of the western sky and off the heaving sea, a light shone out 6f one of the castle windows. The waves leapt up to it, as if eager to look at the warmth, within, and fell back again dis appointed. But we, more privileged, may glance in. '■•,'.:,■•. It was a 80181140010, its dark oaken Walls deco rated by the heads pi deer, o» the graceful spreading antlers of which hung old spears, daggers, helnwta^ gauntlets; Ac.

Don't be afraid: he won't hurt you." The children said they would do this; arid^ after warning them to speak of it to no one, Sir. Eric bade them call Elspeth. Elspeth waa overjoyed to see her master, and. so were all the servants—even Fergus Bain, a thin pawky fellow, who gained his living, as a wandering piper, in various houses in the neigh* borhood. When none of the servants were in the room, Sir Eric put some of his supper in a basket, and told Archie and Shiela to take it to the tower room, which they did, a little curious about this fugitive, and very frightened. The tower room was a very small chamber opening by a concealed door from a disused lam* ber-roonx. The tower or turret was one of four built one at each corner of the castle. Two of them contained stairs ; the third was simply for ornament, and this one had the room which, be sides the entrance 1 have mentioned, communi cated with the secret passage*, although very few people knew of it. B.I.N.A. When the children opened the door the occu pant of the room sprang to his feet, but on seeing who his visitors were he smiled gaily, saying, "Welcome, my kind fairies; I'm delighted to see you and your basket" " Father sent this," said Archie, gravely, set ting down his basket ' _ With his respectable comperments," added Shiela, who was always very conscientious about delivering a message before she had time to for get it " Yes, and he says," Archie went on, wisely refraining from going over the stony ground on which he was conscious his sister had stumbled, 'although he could not Bit her right—" he says if jon will pardon him for not coming himself, but | you knew the reason." ' "You know the reason." Shiela generally echoed the last words of her brother's sentences in this way. ' " I know the reason," said the stranger, laugh- Lag ; " and tell him I am quite pleased with my hosts. Are you going ? Well, good-night" 1 He was such a mud-bespattered, travel-stained, shabbily.dressed foan that Sheila had some scruples about going near enough' to him to 'return his good-nigbt and shake hands with him. ' " What's your name, IRtle lady ?" he asked. '■' u Shiela," she answered, "and that's Archie. What's yours f Archie frowned to his Bister, to indicate that that was not a polite questiou. But the stranger did not seem to mind. "Itis an hnldcky name," he answered, sadly. The two children went back to their father, and told him all that had been said and done. f He wouldn't tell me his came," said Shiela. ♦'Whatis it, father!" Sir Eric pondered, a minute before he answered. • Perhaps I ought not to tell you ; but you may at well know soon as syne. That is Prince Charlie." I "Prince Charlie !" they repeated. "Oh I" aaid Archie, "his clothes are all ragged and dirty, and he wasn't a bit like a prince." Their fattier explained how, the Prince having been sleeping in barns, sheds, boats, or on the open hill, it was not to be expected he should wear a crown and a velvet robe, or even have his clothes brushed every morning. . "Hi* hair v the same oolor as mine," said Ihiela, with a laugh of childish pleasure in oon aeotingherself with the "yellow heir" of the r bjMWie Prince Charlie." As Sir Eric had to go away next day, the: children declared their intention of sitting up until her went to bed; for children thm had a ■trang* aversion to going to bed, considering it beneath their dignity to confess to being sleepy When, there was an opportunity for sitting up. So our two little friend* were seated,Shiela.on her father's knee, Archie on a stool dote beside bJsm, when old Kltpeth came hurrying m, panting With mingled torroV aod haste. ' «Ohl maisterdear," the cried," rta for your ltf*ri* and hide. That ill-fatirad loon o 1 a piper | —if Ihadkent—" *^' • "What piper* What* wrong?

Blspeth was off again etthec tirade; but her matter, trembling for a life dearer than his own, seised her arm, and dwnandad sternly to know what she meant • Checking with tome difficulty bar flow of Cel* He; eloquence, she said that "that fause scoundrel, Fergus Bain, had slipped off to the town and given information concerning the arrival of the fugitive Jacobite ; that an English captain was coming with ' quid kens fou mony sodgers;' that they weraa three mile aff; and that the news had been brought by Jockle Beg, a half-witted boy ; and finally, that Fergus Bain was a base traitor, for whom hanging was too'good," &c.;, 4c. "\ Sir Erio stood silent for a minute, and the old Woman, coming dose, to him, aaid softly, " An' I ken, though I wouldna speak o't afore the bairns, puir lambiea, that there's mair nor yoursel' here. Ye thocht I didna' see, but it's no for naething I nursed ye when ye were a wean, an' lo'ed ye an* ser'd ye amy days ; an' I saw ye puttin' him info the room, an' waitin' on him, an' I kent wba it wu». brawly, though I, ne'er let on I kent" S(r Eric, although listening to the old servant enough to gather her meaning, bad all this time. been thinking on the best means of escape for his Prince. " What can be!d6ne ?" he said, striding up and down the room. "We can't defend the place ; we cay t hide him anywhere. And. as for escape, if they are only three miles off they must see every boat that puts off; and by land escape is impossible. Still, we must try it some way." But the excitement had somehow penetrated to the lower room, and the Prince had made his way to the passages, and now stood before them. Bis appearance somewhat alarmed Elspeth. Had he been dressed in full royal state, she would have considered it right to go down upon her knees; but, thinking that such a demonstration would be ridiculous under the cirqumstaneet, »he contented herself by backing into a corner and wringing her hands. But Prince Charlie had no time to notice her or anything else. " Forbes, what it wrong ?" he asked. « What does this commotion mean ?" Mlt means that my poor roof is not to have the honor of sheltering yonr highness for a* night," said Sir Eric, and he briefly explained the state of the case. "The only feasible plan I can think of," he added, in conclusion, " is for me to take a boat and row up the lock, and the soldiers will follow ate on the shore. Then when they have turned their backs on the castle yonr grace may get down to Lord Ronald's." "Bat by this plan you must inevitably be taken," said the Prince. "No, no; that will never do. Besides, how could I make my way down to Lord Ronald's through a country I never saw before. We must both go there to gether, and take our chance." " Eh ! ay, Sir Eric, he's speakin' sense," cried Elspeth, her fear for her master's safety overcom ing her awe of royalty. " Gang ye wi' him, for the sorigers wud get ye for certain if ye gaed up i' the boat, for they wud get the muckle boat that's lying at the Tarbet ; forbye that, they ken there were twa o' ye cam. Fergus is gleg enuch for that; and when they seed there was but ac man f the boat—and they wud ken it was your honor—they wud send on an attachment here afore his honor" (curtseying to the Prince) "had ties c to get awa'." "She's speaking sense, as she said of me," said the Prince. " Come, Forbes, we're losing time : we'll go off together ; and it won't be the first time Charles Stuart has had to trust to his own feet for his life ! Come." But Sir Erie still hesitated, and Shiela, who, clinging to her father's band, had listened eagerly to the conversation, said, "Daddy, I'll go in the boat, and they'll think I'm the Prince ; my hair's the same color," turning her head to look at the golden curls on her shoulder, with the pleased smile at their resemblance to Prince Charlie's. " Let me go, daddy, and Archie can go too, and pretend he is you." Archie seconded this pro posal, though more gravely, knowing better than Shiela that it was a dangerous one." "Bless your kind little woman's heart," aaid the Prince ; " but Heaven forbid I should take advantage of it!" "But you shall, my lord," cried Sir Eric. " Archie has rowed the little boat up that way a hundred times. All he has to do is to attract their attention, and then to keep out of bullet range ; and, if they do catch them, they would not hurt such children. If that plan fails, your grace and I must look to ourselves. I dare not trust one of the men, or I would send him with them. But come and get off, my brave wee bairns," he said, and hastily muffling Sheila in the Prince's plaid, and crowning the yellow curls with the Prince's bonnet, and followed by Archie and Elapeth (whose breath was completely taken away by the suddenness of the affair, else she would assuredly have objected), he hurried to the stairs, at the foot of which was the rough little pier at which the little boat, named the Flora, was moored. At last they were both seated. Archie got his final instructions about attracting the attention of the troopers, keeping out of bullet-range, and not letting himself be caught for two hours or so. Sir Eric kissed them rather sadly, yet comforting himself by thinking no one could have the heart to hurt them. As Shiela turned back her face, in half terror at going off, Prince Charlie stooped down and kissed & saying, " God bless you. It might bring sue* cess even to my cause to have such a noble little heart devoted to me. Good- bye, Archie ; I shall know where to look for a brave soldier wken I want one." 1 Then they pushed off. The father stood gazing for an instant at the brown head bent over the can, and at the golden hair, that was bo " like the Prince's," gleaming in the moonlight Then he turned, and he and Prince Charles went in to make preparations for their start, while Elspeth remained on the little quay, alternately praying (or her two darlings and cursing Fergus Bam, who had caused this mischance. But to return to our two adventurers in the boat As soon as they got out from' beneath the castle they saw the soldiers coming down the ro*d which led along the shore. Very toon they, in their turn, descried the boat with Hs two oooupants. They, turned and rode back, follow ftifc the boat Then Archie began to pull out to sea. fie was a good rower, and had spent many a day in the samd little boat, with Shiela manag ing the helm, as she was doing now. Observing his maosuvre, the soldiers called a halt, and then about a dozen of them got into the big six-oared boat that was lying at anchor. But it took a good while to get her right and set off, so Archie had a start Still he knew it would require all his strength to keep his pursuers from finding out who the real crew of the Flora were too soon. It was a terrible chase, and poor Archie soon began to feel he could not keep it up long. "Oh! Shiela,'' he said at last, "I don't know what lam to do. They'll be upon vu very soon, and I can't row a bit faster, my arms are so sore." "So sore 1" echoed Shiela, in a sympathising voice ; " but haven't we been away two hours yet, Aichie 1" " Not more than one," answered he, shaking his head ; "and father and the Prince can't be much farther than the Keltia Burn yet, so it won't do to give in," and he pulled away for a little longer. The big boat was getting close now. Archie pulled more vigorously, and in making one long stroke his tired hand lost its grip, and one oar was gone. He sprung up and tried to catch it, but again he overreached himself and followed the oar into the water. One of the men in the big boat, thinking this might be one of the fugitives trying to elude them by swimming, jumped overboard, caught poor Archie, and dragged him to the big boat Great was the consternation when, instead of the stal wart Sir Eric Forbes, they saw a little boy, look ing smaller because of his recent " dook." " Who are you, sir ?" exclaimed the enraged officer. " Archie Forbes, air," replied the boy. "And who is in that boat?" demanded the officer. Archie thought silence was his safest course. " It's him himself, sir," cried one of the men. " I know him by the yellow hair the lassies rave about Forbes has sent his son to row the Prince." "Well," said the efficer, sulkily, "put this chap out of the road, and if I don't get hold of that scamp in the boat, and that before I'm a quarter of an hour older, my name is not John Burton." So Archie was stowed away in the bottom of the boat, while poor little Sbiela drifted on, keeping the boat clear of the rocks by instinct rather than anything else. They were nearing the shore now, and Captain Burton, fearing the Flora might run ashore, and the Prince escape before he could land from his big boat, lost his temper and his patience, and ordered one of the men to fire a shot, "to frighten the fellow." The man fired. Oh I how Archie's heart jumped at the sound I They could not tell at first what effect the shot had. The boat drifted with the tide, which was coming in. Presently she ran ashore, but no one got out Captain Burton and his crew could not restrain their eagerness, and when they came near they jumped into the water and waded to the Flora, followed by Archie, whom no one had time to notice. And when they reached the boat they lifted the Prince's bonnet, and *aw the innocent little face and the golden hair that was so " like the Prince's" stained with the life-blood of the noble little heart that was so devoted to him.
