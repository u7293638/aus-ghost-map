"I have not seen her einues ie was a oliild," replied Il, in a-loaw tone, "IBliyou saw her then I" cried Dexter, with joy at this Ilow bond between thoem. " You will be intereated to know how lovely ael is now, and will luetm talk to you about her, will you not? She will eeln nearer to me, and not ao utterly loot, it I may." " Ye, yes I" said Lir. Blliiani, eagerly. "Tell mu all you know of her I" Theni he looked snarchingly at hinm, and uddenly helhl out his hand, and sanlid earnaetly, "You love her. I will do all in my power to help you unravel the mystery that separteyoyu. Dexter pressed bis hallnd warmly, and found, some way, a little comfort in the words. At Mr. Elilnon did not explainlurlher In regard to his acquaintance with Jerome Addington, Dexter forebore to qluestion him. But alterthie the talk between them was always of Colin.

Addinglon's whereabouts, it possible; and, although the young man aouldl eea no good which would result it he learned theml, sineu Colin had declared her resolve unnltorlble, he finally wrote to his father, requesating hin, to find out where the Addingtons had gone if he could, or any guide to their present abode. Ilaviug desdpatchid this letter, he grew so im. patient for a reply that he could hardly wait the nleeeoary interval. As little iope as there scamed in any event lihe fact of knowing just where Celia was would bring her a trillo nearer to hiin, since it was better than nothing to be certnin of liher whlerabouts. Hle wan doomed to diap. pointment, however. Iis flather replied promnptly, and elated that hoi had found and q icstined AMr. Addilgtoin's lawyer, but that ho u alld h:was unacquailnted with his former eliont's prceunt place: of resideneo; that he had at first 10oo to New York, but liad after. ward moved from that city, saice when all business relations had coased between them. Mr. lIattwiuk added to his own opinion that the lawyor's manner was evasive, and, that it wea evident Mr. Addington, for soaei rea son, did not wish it generally known where he had gone. Dexter took this letter rattier gloomily to his friend. "Ao I thought," the latter remarked, when he had read it. "Jerome Addington fears you, and has taken precautions to prevent your following him, ahoutld you wiehi to do ao. IIo is determained to keep you and Celia apart, Blt do not be discouragod, luy dear boy. VWe will find him outel yet." SBut how 1" asked Dexter. Mr. Ellisun reflected. "I think I will write to thin lawyer," he re plied, at length. "It is probable Mr. Ad. dington's instructlons related particularly to those who might have any anncctlion with you.

" Iow can I over repay you if you sllould be tho me ua of giving my darling back to met" he cried with an outburst of feel. lug. Air. Ellieon replied unly by an enigmatical look which Dexter could not fathom. Yet it some way teemed to add to hlil confJence in his new friend's power. The letter was written at once, and Dexter had just dropped it into a pot-eollico box, and was about to croan the street, when his heart suddenly stood still, than beat again in heavy tiuumps. knor, walting slowly along on the opposite eide of the street, lie saw lir.

Mr. Addinoton stood irresolute, gnaw. ing his fingers. No one noticed Ellison, who still remained eonoealed behind the obair in his accidental asclurion. Coia was the first to break the silence. "It was cruel to us both to come, Dexter," said she, piteously. " I told you there wau no hopo. Ah I why will'you make it eo hard so hard I llor voice broke and she burst into tears. At this Mr. Addington said steruly, " You see, young man, the misery your pro. aence causes. Tlhat this secno imay not be repeatcd, I will nccedo to your ilemand.

At this lMr. Addington turned again to Dex. ter. " It is a painful disolosure," lie commenced with a hardli, grating sound in Ilia lona; "I yield to its being drewn tfrun me that sho need be no longer troubled by your eolicitn tiony.

Her face was hidden in her bnndlcr. chief. A stillness followed the words. " Why have you told her this story, Jerome Addington I It was a strange voice to two there that broke the silence, and Celia looked up it artled to see a gray head rising behind the large armi.hair. tiha gave n cry of eurprioc and fright, but surely eshe had no reason to fear the look she tril, which was kind almost to tenderness, and protectling. Dexter, recalkd to a inowledga ot Mr. Ellieon'e proeience, looked at him wistfully, wondering what his words meant, but not during to hope. Upon Mr. Addington the Tlect of tbis sudden up. parition of al unsuspected fourth inl tile in terview was strangely nmrked. lIe started back, and th, ad' as his eyes eoarched the laco, recognition cniie into his own, and he stared at him appalled, as it he had seen a ghost. "I ase you remember me, although it is many years since we have met, and I have chianged much alines then," said Mr. Ellison, iquietly. " I had not intendud to play teio lisltner here, but, oa it so happened I took advantago of the lireuuiutaues3. IHad yio faithfully discelarged your tluat, you would havo had no reason to lear mu aas you do now." Mr. Addington had lost every partialo of rellfpouseasion.

At these words Celia shrank back elose to liher father, andl covered htier face with toer hands. She comprehended now the looks of Iti which of lteo had surprised and frightened her, and in her outraged feeliongs forgot for the moment the shadow which his revelation had roemoved. " I loved you, Celia, with the passionate love of n man who might havo had the right had not )ou believed him to be your uncle," went on Jerome Addington, while all listened intently, Mr. Ellison with pity, and Dexter with horror. " In ooy jealousy, I kept you eeolud d, as I thought, from tihe chance of any lover, anod I was already planning to win you to regard ona in a different light from what you did, when I discovered in one ter riblue momoent that my preooutiono had been in vain, and you loved.

Invoolntarily, CClia raioed her eyes, shin iog with the gloidneec of the few words which lad momentarily blotted out all the others, to those of her lover, that responded with the same joy. Then she remembered Mr. Ad. dington. A shadow croesed the brightness of her face. She hesitated, thon she said, fal. toringly, " Uncle-let me call you uncle still, for 1 can never think of you otherwise-for the sake of all that hase been, I forgive you the suffering that you have caused, aod-and pity you." "ly punishment is severe," toe returned huskily. " Some time the remembrance of those words will comfort me, but now I can only remember that I have lost you. That is penance enouuh for a thousand heavier nine than mine. Try and think of me as I was. I leave you to'thoes who have the right I have fatfdited." Giving her a last look so full of wretched. neo siho never forgot it, he turned and wont out of tile room and out of her life forever. Tears came to her eyes asn she gazed after him.
