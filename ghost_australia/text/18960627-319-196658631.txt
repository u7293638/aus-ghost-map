A HAUNTED HOUSE. A retired soldier, who complained that bis landlord refused to let bim surrender the lease of a country house because it was haunted, offered (o givo any peisou who might like to make the acquaintance of the ghost an oppor tunity of doing so. His offer wax accepted by two dariug investigators named Fitzmaurice and Tooley, who, armed with pistols and lamps, spent the nigbls of a Saturday and Sunday in tho empty oh&leau.; They were re warded for their pains— uofc, indeed, with the acquaintance of the spook, who fa perhaps too shy to introduce bimseif to mere casual occu pants— hut with some very gratifying nofces. Footsteps came along the corridor and paused outiido their door ; they rushed out and found nobody, though they went into every corner of the house. Then they bcanl a noise ai of some heavy article being pushed or dragged along the corridor, which grew louder nntil it suddenly ceased outside the room in- which tboy were. Again they explored the hoaso fruitlessly ; all the bolts and bars were fast, and nothing was to be seen or heard, dost as they reached their own room, they heard in that opposite, the door of wbioli was wide open, a bang, as if a heavy weight hod been thrown down, which echoed through tho house. The room was qullo empty, and tho window of it was shut and fastened. This concluded the per formance, and Messrs. l'Uzmaurico and Pooloy are quite convinced now.
