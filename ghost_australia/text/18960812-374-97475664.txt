Ta was walking around, thqjfehtofthe lantern gleaming weitdly on the white tiles which lined the walls and'floor, "when I suddenly heard a door bans;.

To remain there all night seemed impossible, yet how much more impossible to get : away. I had always been accounted, .among, my fellow- nuraep as the most courageous, and I fear I had been wont to boast that nothing conld frightexi,, me, .bat I Jiad never 4 ^dreamed of anything like this. To sit among friendly faces |n the daylight, or< i beside a cheery |im£ wasjone thing. Tp •be forced tcraf&nft; alight atonfe wfth I the dead, was another. At .length I gathered sufficient courage to turn round and try to realize my position. Ob, how I envied those fortunate mortals who, in moments of danger_apd dread, can quietly faint away into calm <mconscio|!8ue8s, to re* cover their senses only when the horror is past; tlf^T ,could oiily;lie down on that coldi^.|ocfaml sleep. Aye:! even if it %as the sleep that " knows no waking, how gladly would I hare done so. Anything rather than remain'! terfbr- stricken with these dreadful com-1 panions. I i glanced at the lantern : how long would it barn ? Oonld I depend on its light lasting till dawn 1 I loolp Jit ther trolly, -with its cold, stiUjblitden, then, witha eighty Effort, ' I crossed the chapel, and, seizing the end of the ghastly cajrriagey.'whirled lt quickly .into the large mortuary. With ^ much strength as my arms Bfcill possessed, I sent it irito'^fetfarknesB, and flew back into the dimly-lighted chapel, closing the door behind me. Now at least I was alone, with nothing more unearthly than white flowers, and a large ebony cross which hung against the wall. Sinking down into 'the . corner most remote from the, inner door, wrapping my shawl closely ronnd my shivering shoulders, I placed the lantern beside me, and strove vainly to think of pleasant things. X tried: to think of the ward, with its cheerful fire and rows of .beds with their cosy red rugs; of the fun we had at Christmas with the children and the Christmas tree; of home, with the dear faces I hoped to see when the summer came, and with it the long anticipated holiday. But all in vain 1 My eyes would keep glancing round at the horrible door. My ears would strain themselves to hear sounds from that'silentfoom. Oh 1 Ishouldgo mad! I could- not bear it+ How wicked! how Cruel! that no one1 came to seek me! What was that? The great clock at . the entrance - was striking. One! two!—but, no, seven ! eight! then silence. Only eight o'clock! Only two hours since I ran throagh thegarden to fetch the stimulants! Almost involuntarily I slipped my hand into my apron pocket. Yes, there were the two bottles, carefully wrapped roand with my handkerchief, as r^ad ^pat 'tliem . For sa ftiiom⁢ a ray of hope darted across my^'-mlnd t' aat-ely, wbfen - the bottles were missed from their place, inquiry would be made, and I should be sought for. But a moment's re flection brought back the old -despair. .It was pot an unheard-of thing in those basy - times^for the dispensary to' be forgotten until the door was ? locked and the dispenser gone. Mixtures arid medicines would be left on the little shelf outside, but not the stimulants— and Sister, with a sigh, at the forget i fulness of her nurses, would serve the | patients from the stock bottles, and no thooght would be directed to me. Whether I fell asleep or not I have never -since been able to determine, but when I roused from the semi consciousness into, which I had fallen, .several hours appeared to have elapsed. ^Instead of the dim light of the lantern [ at my side, the chapel .was Mopded iwith' silver moonlight. In spite of my thick | shawl, I waB fearfully cold and cramped with leaning so long against the chilly stones. I was aware that something had roused me; something besides moonlight;; anil di&f;»mfort. . A. glance/: fet the skylight overhead showed me the moon sailing calmly through the dark blue vault of heaven, .surrounded by fleecy clouds; and, even as I looked and listened, the great clock srtuck tffo! For nearly six hours I had lain unconscious in that awful place. The ;fact "didnot-tend to bring me comfort; I felt .sick find ill,, my limbs ached; the' black cross, touched by tue mobh beams, loomed dark and awful against the white wall. Ob, to die and forget everything 1 What was that? A sound> igroftal Oh, Heaven! coming from the other side of the inner door!""""""'"''" I bad risen, ;to:. my ..leet, but now I sank back, frozen with horror, into the sheltering corner. afew moment? silence, ^^^ bameagpain/ I listened —a \o&, )aug moan—bat to^y «pn-, fused b^ap it was^no| the hollow, on-, earthly proaigof^blie stag^ghost such as gfln^^ioassociate withrattling chains and land blue firi^butrather the groan ofaholriatrcfisature in pain. As soon as tbiB idea topk possession of my weakened mind, my. courage re turned. All - my narselike instincts came to niy aid. ■ : : Thesjthoflght ihit a{ living human being was near, much more a fellow creatare whoi needediiielp, Blled: me:' with -new energy,and I rose knd took up my lantern. What I expected to find I hardly ' know; perhaps some ..workman who had been assisting with the new building bad fallen asleep, or been overcome with drink, and shut in, like^'myeelf', "^-fclfroogli misadventure. How improbable a theory this was did not, fortunately, occur to me until long afterwards, and I opened the door and; looked into the dark interior. At the sound of the opening door the groaning ceased, and for awhile I stood uncertain which direction,to take. Presently a movement at the farther end decided me, and I made my way round the stone ledges, casting the :Iigbt of the lj&niiap;' oSi ^e^ro^ittcpf18 I went. Nt> s^n|<of a liniri)i&fija;^<&nld; I see. No Briusfr ^e|im bent form gladdened myeyea." Ifcfcood still, in perplexity.

In a moment the fijagera had'puile& the sheet from the face, and a pair of dark eyeB gazed into mine! , How long I stood thus I shall never, know, At length, a long, quivering sigh 'from the white lips called me to myself, and I gathered courage to bend ove* and touch Ahe prcwtrate fonn. Enough! The <4>eH was broken T il knewthen that tbisTwas no tiiD9 jbo fa esitate—np' time to give way"' to womanish fears. " I took the cold hand in mine. J 'Do not fear,'I said, in as calm a [ voice as I: could command, ' I will do all I ean for you'and, taking . the shawl from my shoulders, I folded it round the shivering form. Instinc tivelyl remembered'the' bottlteintny* pocket, and, drawing thetn forth, dropped a little brandy between the chaptering teeth.After"while the returning color in the lips, the increas ing warmth of the limbs, told me that my efforts h^ not b§en in vain. Oh, if I could only summon aid ; but that was impossible! If I could keep life in my companion, my patient, until help arrived. Fortunately my shawl was a lar^e, warm one; fortunately, old No. 20 had not got his brandy, but I fcad'it sa'felv here. . ' Where am 17 asked the man, as he looked: round the dim place, bis face foil of surprise^—and no wonder, for hi8 surroundings had, to say the least, an unusual appearance. I did not think it wise or necessary to explain matters more than to tell him he was in St. Alban's Hospital, and would soon doabtless be well. He told me what I bad already guessed, that in travelling on foot through the snow he had been overtaken by intense fatigue, and being unable to overcome the drowsiness he knewwell might be fatal, he had fallen asleep. ' It's a wonder I'm not dead/ he concluded, and* I made no-answer. \- I had been so absorbed in my work that I-had taken no "account ot the hours as they went by, until now I heard theclock ring out six! Oh, the joy of that sonnd! We kept early hours at St. Albans, and at six o'clock we were expected to rue. I should be missed, sought for, and found! , * I was shivering and sick. The man had fallen into a doze, from which I could not find it in my hoart to rouse him, lonely and miserable as I felt. Oh, how cold it was! My thin: cotton: dress was scanty covering from the icy air. ■ How ..long": would ^it ; be before they found me ? Would they; seek long before they thought of the mor&ary; 1 Would they think of the .mortuary at all? How all these thoughts tormented me, chasing each other through my aching brain until, at last, a sound of a key turning in ;the lock—the voice of my dear nurse companion saying, in be wildered tones, 'She cannot be here, porter.' Then the whole place spun round, and I saw and heard no more. It was long before I returned to my ' work. Pneumonia set in, and for weeks I was too ill to leave my bed. Tenderly was I nursed, and much was I praised for what they were pleased to call my bravery. My patient, I learned,tad recovered and was full of gratitude for'his strange rescue from an -untimely end. The case of ' suspended animation' was much talked of among the doctors, and the medical papers took it up with interest. '.You saved his life, you know,' said the nurses to me, apparently to console me for my unpleasant experiences; and tlie -patient 'himself has told-me .'the same thing a hundred times since that day, for I am now his wife.
