? A SPRIG OF DAPHNE. CAN I not speak P Have I no voice To whisper soft—" Beware !'* When, rev'rent, to the be&rded; lips He lifts the leaf that touched her hair ? Mast I BO subtle warning give To save from pain, and wound, and scar, No ruddy signal wave, to tell' Of toroh mistaken for a star f To tell him, that a gilded palm Stretched sooner oat, «ould take The blossom that she bid him " wear And keep, tho" faded, for her sake." Ah! conld I whisper in his ear The cold decision I have heard, To Bteal his heart, and fling it down; Alas ! I find nor sound, nor word. I have no voice, I can but die The sooner, fall of bitter pain That o'er my fragrant tablet lies No written truth, no warning 8tain. Ay! fling me down! poor wounded heart; I would have saved you, master, this, If speech had been vouchsafed to me Last night, beneath your raptured ki ss. Your turn has come, the shaft was swift. Its poisoned errand to conclude; Yet courage take! it was Love's ghost, Not Love itself, you warmly wooed. A sprig of daphne, crushed and dim, A bearded face more stern and set. That's all; bring in fresh blossoms now. Who's next ? Smile on, Coquette.
