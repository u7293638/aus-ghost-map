Thefieesfts have had a rare time of it of late, and -pictures are now the recognised medium of high cash prices. The Giliott collection probably fetched larger sums of money than any known collection, the total being over £180,000.

Tim racing season does not appear to have begun with any very particular precipe. With the exceptionof the Two Thousand Gainers Btskds, which was won by a roarer, the Spring. Newmarket Meeting did not attract much attention, and .Chester races are deci dedly falling off. It is indeed becoming a question, whether the number of days of this old-established meeting shall not be curtailed, and I should not wonder if within the next dozen yeu* the Chester fixture falls through altogether, This , is partly owing to the virtuous attitude taken up by tire Marquis of Westminster, w,hp has imbibed a strong dislike tothe dirstations which go onat this season in the ancsent city, and who has for bidden the use of the Grosvenor Hotel to the betting men.
