Coursing Coursing on the Downs Notes by "Melfort" In the "Queenslander" of 22nd April some remarks appeared regarding the num- ber of Plumptons in Queensland, and Plumpton coursing generally, which if al- lowed to pass unnoticed might leave false impressions on the minds of those who have yet to make a closer acquaintance with the sport. I think I distinctly stated in a pre- vious report that to Pittsworth belongs the honour of having the first and only en- closure in Queensland. It was thought that the Warwick Club would have a ground ready for this season; but, owing to unfore- seen circumstances, the project fell through. Mr Harding Cox's comments on the en- closed system have considerable bearing on the Pittsworth ground. Most of the Plumptons mentioned by that gentleman were either "badly managed or money-mak- ing concerns, and for those reasons the public patronage soon fell off. In forming their Plumpton Pittsworth consulted no pri- vate individual, but the interests of cours- ing only, and coursing men showed their approval by subscribing liberally. Let it be clearly understood that the ground will not be managed by a proprietary club whose first and only object is to make money at the expense of the sport, but by a real live coursing club, who intend to make coursing as attractive as possible, and all profits that accrue will be expended in improvements and increasing the stakes. A greyhound admittedly will acquire a knowledge of the run of the hares quicker in an enclosure than in the open. I main- tain if a dog, provided he has descended from a good, honest family - and I don't think any breeder would be foolish enough to use a dog or bitch for stud purposes who has shown signs of cunning at an early age - (I say at an early age is because the trait would most likely be hereditary) - is judiciously coursed the danger is practically reduced to nil. Take, for instance the famous Blackbird, who figured in sixty- eight public courses, sixty-three of which be won, and ran as true as steel right up to the last. Drinan Dhu, Confidence, and many others I could name, who did all their coursing in enclosures, and never showed the slightest signs of 'shepherding'. What the Downs Coursers want are trials of a fair legitimate character, not a 150 yards sprint nor a two mile grueller, both of which are very fre- quent occurrences in the open. Hence the reason for the Pittsworth Plumpton. A match between Dr Salter's Cyclone and Mr A J Harvey's Buttercup was run off in Mr J Porter's paddocks. Mr R Wil son judged, and his verdict was undecided. The deciding hare could not be found, so honours were easy. A large crowd from Pittsworth witnessed the running. During the afternoon the genial Robert enured a fine hare (totally uninjured from the jaws of a dog), whose next appearance will be in the Plumpton. Mr A J Harvey's red bitch Frailty (Lo- tos-Butterfly) has broken her leg, the re- sult of running against a stump. Her own- er was compelled to destroy her.

Mr. 6- Bladon has returned from the old country without Baldcoote and Bogan ; nroMMy the Qusrantine Act was the cause otthat. Both wen disposed of privately, prior to his departure from England, the former to the Hon. O. Molyneaux for thirty-live guineas, and the latter to the well-known Lancashire cricketer, Mr. A. C. Maclaren, for fifty guineas. In comparing the Australian and English greyhound (writes a Southern paper), Mr- *l**"n •£" the latter was more like an Italian grey hound. Mr. Bladon attributes his non-suc oess to the unsuitableness of the Altear country, which was against Bogan's style of galloping. The fdllowing verses, which appeared In •• Coursing Chatter" of 18th April, must ap peal warmly to the heart of every lover of the longtails :— _ When each thoroughbred, in his warm win ter bed, •••: Is cosily dreaming et pace. When "Power" and " Hales" have again run to fat, . And can dare look a goose In the face ; When the hoar frost glistens- and .the red fox listens To a whimper that bodes a crash brewing ; Then put spring in your hips, and your dpg in the slips, For coursing hath charms worth the woo* teg. ■ : • Chorus: ' ■ „ Tis our heartfelt pride, with our dog at our side, . • ■ - 'Long the stubbles and fallows to go.
