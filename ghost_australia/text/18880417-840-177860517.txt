More Power. Yesterday the North Brisbane Municipal Council complained that they had been abused by tho Board of Health ; and in turn they abused the polico. This is passing on tho blame, but leaving a remedy for the malady just where it was before. Tho Board of Health say : ' Theso premises are in a. very unhealthy condition, and ought to bo pulled down.' The City Council sar : ' These bi.ildings are in a ?wretched stato of delapidation, and ought to bo pulled down.' The police say : 'The tenants of these premises are persona of ill fame, and siuce wo cannot rid them by any other menus tho buildings ought to be pulled down.'- Chorus, ' The buildings must come down.' But whilst thero is this threefold nnimimity to which all who know tho ease say 'Amen,' no one appears to havo authority enough to lay hands on these doomed buildings. It is easy for the board to blamo tho council, and for tho council to blame the police ; but if cither of theso authorities had tho ghost of authority to net, thero would bo nothing left for tho others to grumble about. More power to thom. ?
