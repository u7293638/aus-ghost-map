THE GHOST OF THE NORWAY SCHEME. Yah! I'm poorty near tired of dis vatin So long time outside of der House, Dey keep on for ever debatin, Vile poor Norvay's as qviet ash a mouse. I don't moch like dis kind of dreatment, After traggin me all de vay here, Ah! vell, now it's come to defeatment, It's backyards to Norvay I'll stheer. Ven vonce I get home to mine Norway, Yau don't find me dravlin no more; Den I'll dink of Victoria so far 'vay, Und de dreatment I got on dat shore. Ah vell, Mr. Francis, I'm schwindled, Mr. Langton and Casey, good bye, As soon as I get my lamp kindled, I'll dake a run home dro' der schky. Now goot bye, all ye men of dis nation, For soon I shall be far away; Better lock to dis here ligeslation, Dan it met mit, de scheme of Norway. (Exit Ghost, disgusted.)
