TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1891. It need scarcely be said that any real effort to place the state railways on a satisfactory footing demands a sym- pathetic reception. The question is far too serious to be trifled with. On the one hand, it is certain that nothing will advance the fortunes of the country as a whole so much as a network of lines, self-supporting, and carrying the farmers' produce cheaply to market, and so putting money in their pockets and causing a rise in land values ; and on the other hand, it is sure that to saddle the country with the burden of heavily losing lines is to bring about a financial catastrophe. We do not want an income tax and a property tax combined to be levied in order to make up a heavy annual deficiency on the railways, and yet we are steadily drifting to that undesirable position; and more than that, if railways cannot be made to pay, then railway construc- tion must stop, and the hopes of the new districts will be blighted. It is not too much to say that the question whether Victoria will be a good place or a bad place to live in in the immediate future depends upon the railway policy which we are about to adopt more than upon any other one thing, and conse- quently there is the strongest reason why a patriotic effort should be made to solve the problem. For our part, we greatly regret that the issue should be obscured by gratuitous personal charges against the commis- sioners, which may or may not be true, but are left without due support, and we submit that it would be well if even at this eleventh hour the imputations in question could be withdrawn, so that the railway question could be considered on its merits. The question has two branches— construction and management, and to-day we can deal only with the first of these issues. If we make lines where there is no sufficient traffic, then the best management in the world will not save us from a loss. A line from nowhere to a stump would not pay interest oven if an arch- angel managed affairs. Parliament for instance in 1884 ordered the construction of one particular long and costly lino, although in parts not so much' os a flying survey had been made. Thero was not enough goods and passenger traffic to warrant the making of a road or the running of a coach over the greater part of the distance, and a guarantee may safely be given that this line will not pay for a dozen years io come. No possible» management' can be successful against tliis handicap. Of course management is also important, because good and economical arrangements will often turn the scale for or against a line, and moreover accidents have to be guarded against, and the public comfort demands attention, but construction takes by far and away tho first plaoe in im- portance. The railway reformer com- mences with the questions what lines shall bo adopted, and what shall bo their character and cost, as the foundation of any railway policy ; and here it may be said the Government measure is inadéquate, inasmuch as it merely pro- vides for the creation of a board-a branch of the Board of Land and Works- which shall let contracts after the lines have been ordered. The board is to fill up the gap between the ordering of the lines by Parliament and the taking of them over by the traffic commissioners, and this provision does not touch the real evil, which is the ordering of lines that cannot by any chance be made to pay. Against the proposed divorco of con- struction from management there is little, if anything, to be urged. As a matter of fact the responsibility to- day for construction lies with Parliament and the Minister, and recent events show that it is inadvisable that Parliament and the Minister should bo able to u_o the commissioners as a screen. What has happened heretofore is that tho Minister is interviewed by deputations in public and by members in private ; he is enter- tained in the country districts; he selects the lines ; he arranges with the engineers of construction as to cost, and ho submits a scheme to Parliament-and that is the first intimation the commissioners have of what tho Government proposals are. It is true that the commissioners are then supposed to submit certified esti- mates of traffic, Ac., to Parliament, but of course with an octopus bill that is a sheer impossibility. To suppose that this euormous mass of information can be obtained in three weeks is a farce ; it would take a special staff three years to grapple with the work, and consequently tho certi- fied estimates have never been given. Possibly the commissioners might have prepared business estimates with regard to two or three lines, but the pro- posing of 50 or CO lines at the same time overwhelmed thom. What- ever efficacy there was in tho cer- tificate section of the .Railway Management Act was destroyed by the octopus bill, and yet it is behind this certificate clause that members and Ministers have sought to hide. The camel might have staggered ou under a burden of a top, but it was pinned to the ground by the sixty-ton load-and Parliament has sought to belabour the overloaded camel. No plan lins yet been suggested of relieving Parliament of the responsibility of choosing the lines to be made, and consequently it seems best to fix the responsibility as plainly as possible on tho Legislature, making every possible provision for deliberation, inquiry, and publicity, and, as far as possible, imposing checks upon the log-roller. Thore may be better plans than the one in existence across tho Murray, but none has so far been dis- closed to us ; and tho question arises, why not adopt that? Something was done last session in this direction no doubt, and yet wo aro only burlesquing the New South Wales system. What takes place there is that individual lines are first proposed to Parliament by the Minister on his own responsibility. Each proposal is accompanied by reports from engineering and traffic experts, who enter minutely into questions of cost and prospects of traffic. Jf the House approves of the project as thus outlined, the whole scheme is remitted to the Railway Committee, which checks the statements and makes an independent report, and in Now South Wales that report is some- times adverse to the proposal and the knowledge that there may be an adverse report is held to bo a great check upon the Minister. Thus we had Mr. BRUCE SMITH the other day pointing out to the country that his great care in selecting works had boen proved by his success in passing this ordeal of the committee. But what we have done here is to dispense with the departmental inquiry and the Minis- terial guarantee, and to remit 6,000 miles of lines to the Bailway Committee for its members to pick and choose from on the basis of such information as they can obtain for themselves. And all that Ministers now propose to do is to create a board to let contracts after the lines have been ordered, and nfter their cost and character has been decided upon. Surely it must be evident to one and all that the real difficulty occurs prior to the adoption of the line and the decision as to its cost and character, and not after- wards. There will be no objection, we imagine, to relieving the commissioners from their present shadowy and un- real responsibility in connection with construction. That being done it may be urged that the proper step to take is boldly to follow tho lead of New South Wales, and insist that each line shall be proposed by a Minister, who shall submit certified reports from experts, this schemo to bo reported upon by the Bailway Committee. In other words the octopus bill, which is still before the standing committee, though not before the House, should be withdrawn, and a new start made. As to the proposed Government board, it might be utilised for one important purpose. Nothing whatever is gained if we build lines for £3,000 per mile, and hand them over to engineers of maintenance who improve them up to a ¿£7,000 per mile standard. The lines will probably have to be graded, say, to a £3,000, £6,000, and £9,000 per mile standard, and it might be left to such a board as the Government propose to give the certificate without which no lino should be improved into a higher grade. An efficient construction department might give us cheap railways, and the com- plete withdrawal of the octopus bill in favour of a single-line schemo might scotch tho log-roller. But the Govern- ment proposal as it stands calls a huge piece of machinery into existenco to do almost nothing. It leaves almost un- touched the real evil, which is the carrying of non-payable linos in an ill informed and a log-rolling Parlia- ment. There can be little doubt that Russia has contrived to gain some important concessions from the Porte, which will open the straits of the Dardanelles to her fleets. Under the treaty of 1856 the Dardanelles were declared neutral, and A\eie closed against the Avai A essels of cveiy nation except Tuikey Dm nig the întenoniug yeal s the tieaty AMIS once Aiolated by an English squadron, but undei con ditions which made it clear to the whole world that the passage of the Dar ddnelles was deliberately intended as a preparation for wai Tho Russians had been completely victonous in their campaign against Turkey , their troops Avere almost within sight of Constan tinoplo , they had extorted the treaty of San Stefano, AAIUCII would have virtually placed a laige poi tion of the Ottoman dominions nuclei then conti ol, and they îefused to yield to the public opinion of Eui ope, which loudly demanded an international congi ess It was at this moment that Dis>it _i n, Avho was thenPiime Ministei, ouleied the fleet to pass the Dardanelles, ind massed a laige detachment of Indian tioops at Malta Russia then agieed to bubmit hei claims to the judgment of a confcience, and a congioss was held at Berlin, which ai ranged finally the tieaty of peace And since that timo the neutrality of the Dai dancllcs lias been fully respected It is appâtent, however, that tho Russians aie now attempting to upset the treaty of 1SÎ5G Avithout being compelled to do so by any military exigencies When Europe AAOS confused and convulsed by the Franco German wai, they took tho opportunity, in defiance of the tieaty, of fortifying Batoum At the present time, it seems to bo their policy to " sneak " out of it, alleging that they have only arranged for the passage of vessels carrying soldiers or convicts But as thoâe A essels are armed, there would bo no difficulty in finding îeasons for the passage of all ships of wai Coincident Avith this movement we have îepoits that the Bussian autho utics are again attempting to make hcadAAay among the Danubian statos, in which then diplomacy has been most successfully combated foi some yeai s past A commission has been despatched to Servia for the put pose of drawing up a commeiual tieaty and al ranging for the establishment of Russian consulates in the pnncipal towns 'lo extend its interests fuithei in Eastern affairs the Govern ment has been purchasing shaies in tho Sue?

The inquiry will be continued to daj The McCormick v Cuthbert libel case advanced another stage yesterday, when the late Minster of Justice denied most em phatically that either malice or political influence actuated him in his official dealings with the licensing magistrate of Warrnam bool. Mr Cuthbert said he had been a member of the Legislative Council for 17 years and from 1886 to 1890 held the portfolio of Minister of Justice. Amongst the officials who came under his control as Minister, were the licensing magistrates of the colony. When Mr McCormick was stationed at Benalla several complaints were made in reference to him, but on investigation Mr Cuthbert always found him in the right, and gave him the support of the department. When a retirement of police magistrates caused several vacancies Mr McCormick was offered the more desirable station of Hamilton, but could not there find a suitable residence and then Mr Cuthbert appointed him to Warrnambool the most coveted station outside Melbourne with the excep tion of Ballarat. Political influence or malice had nothing whatever to do with the removals of Mr McCormick, nor indeed with any of the subsequent acts on which the proceedings for libel were grounded. Mr Cuthbert's opinion was that the adjourn ment of the licensing cases from Horsham to Melbourne in January, 1890, entailed an unnecessary expenditure of public money for the convenience of Mr McCormick, who was about to depart to Tasmania on a yachting cruise. It was never for one moment sought to charge Mr McCormick with corrupt motives or dishonesty. Had such been the intention the matter would immediately have been laid before the Public Service Board. Mr Cuthbert was still under examination when the Court rose for the day.
