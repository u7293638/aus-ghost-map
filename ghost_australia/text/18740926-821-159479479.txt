SOUTH AUSTRALIAN BAPTIST ASSOCIATION. The annual meetings of this body vote com- { taenced on Tuesday, September 22, at the Lecture Hall attached to the Flinders-street Church. There was a large attendance, includ ing, in addition to a' number of ministers of the Baptist denomination, the Revs. C. B. Byrnes, 8, A. wad J. Jefferis, LL.B., Congregation&lista.; At the opening of the proceedings the Rev. J. Frioe, of Moopta, the Chairman for the past .year, presided. After devotional exercises, he refened. to the advantage of having as their 'Chairman a minister residing near Adelaide, and mentioned that his successor -bad before filled tbe office. He then introduced the Rev. H. J. Lambert, of Norwood, as the Chairman elect. . Mr. Lambert said—I can scarcely takepossos eion of thi« honourable charge without expressing the deep sense I feel of the kindness and confi dence'which my brethren have expressed in me hope and trust is that by God s help X may be ftbfo to occupy the position—representing so many earnest hearts throughout the land—with becoming. Christian dignity, and. to the honour . of the Master whom we all love and desire to serve. A hymn having been sung, Mr. Lambert continued—The subject upon which I have to address yon is " TBE METHOD OF CHRISTIAN REVIVALS. •'Hear Brethren — Christian Revivals—their philosophy, their need, their recurrence, their dangers, and their blessedness—constitute, at the preeent time, the subject of deepest thought and enquiry among God's people almost every where ; their discussion, therefore, in this address will be considered appropriate, and we believe will interest all who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. I have not selected my subject—'The Method of Christian Revivals'— with any thought of presenting what is novel, but simply and earnestly to remind the brethren that our 'God i3 waiting to be gracious,' ,and that if the Churches really desire and seek true revival the blessing will be realized. With the sincere prayer that God will direct us, and own our words for good, we enter upon our task. " We would not presume to judge the spiritual condition of any section of the Church of our Liord; but generally throughout the world does she not appear to be more or less tainted with idolatry and corruption—to be cold with scepticism, frigid with old creeds and tradi tions, torn Willi clivj ami joalisua riralriaa, or paralyzed with the voluptuousness of ritualism, with mammon-worship, and a spirit of fashion able worldliness? And does she not thus present a very different aspect from that which characterized her when, fresh with Pentecostal fulness.of life, she first met the world; perfect not so' much in doctrine, or sacraments, or communion, as perfect in her devotedness to the Master, in her continual prayers, and in her bold faithful witness for the truth as it is in Jesus ? In those days thousands were converted under one sermon, all remaining steadfast in the Apostles' doctrine, and zealously active. Now, with her great efforts and elaborate aeiv vices, the Church scarcely does more than hold her own in proportion to the world's popu lation. "Throughout .her history,. however, the Church has enjoyed many seasons of sweet refreshing—times of true revival, when her spiritual vision and affections have been re enkindled; and in the light which baa come freshly, from her Ziord she has experienced renewed strength and. joy. Christ has never forsaken Hispeople, and aUthe powers of His pre sence, and might lie abqut us to-day no less than they did in apostolic times. . Bearing in mind the fulness of Divine Grace, which Christ has placed within His people's reach, of which, if we 'ask,' we 'shall receive;' ana remembering the wonderful success of the Church in times of true revival, we all must feel, if it be possible for - us to receive renewed consecration and pcwer.then from this time we will not cease to, cry, ' Wilt Thou not revive us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee? " ifor many months past we cave oeen eneerea with good news from home. Whole communities, especially in Scotland, have been strangely moved by a power we believe to be Divine. Marvels of spiritual awakening have been wrought, at whioh art, science, and philosophy upon their seats of learning stare with wonder. Calm and keenly-observant men—e.g.t Professor Charteris, Drs. Blackie, and JBonar, and Cairns, and Thomson, and Pulsford—men representing various schools of thought—are all agreed, with devout and thankful hearts, in ascribing these great spiritual results to God. And it is impos sible for usnottofeelinterested. We pray for like blessings. But while God's breath is thus moving among Bis people, and in many parts the Church is receiving fresh impulses and direction for good, it becomes us to do more than feel an interest— we should aet for ourselves; we should watch and pray, and so spread our soils that, like the skilled mariner, we may catch the gracious breeze, and be carried forward to better and brighter experiences of Christian life. " We would clearly distinguish between revival and revivalism. With revivalism we have no sympathy .whatever. Too often it resorts to novel and very questionable means of mere exdtement, such as extravagant and coarse addresses, impudent and .conceited denounce ments, the thrusting aside of all that is quiet and sober in the conducting of' services, and the introduction of only what is noisy and demon strative. Fear and self-interest are appealed to as incentives to an expression of decision for God. We do not object to an unscholarly man pleading with men for their souls' salvation. His English may be bad or his rhetoric faulty; but if his heart be tender and his soul breathful with the love of the Saviour we heartily bid him God Bpeed. God. has often chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty. But such means as are often employed by those who are styled revivalists, offend the taste of Christian men, bewilder the judgment, and altogether violate the fitness of spiritual methods for securing spiritual ends. Any semblance of success and details of particular cases of con version are eagerly published. Under such influences toe often the type of .Christian character formed is weak, while the result gene rally is not true religion, but merely exaggerated feeling—ra kind of unnatural emotion in relation to rehgion. All tiffs is injurious and tends to excite confidence in over-Btimnlated sensation rather than in a sound faith; and the result is repugnance and aversion in the minds ef many intelligent Christians against revivals or against any special means being employed in their promotion. A Christian revival is not of necessity just any movement called religions, where human feel ings may be deeply stirred and which may be promoted by a so- called revivalist. Giving the name, whether to men, meetings, or movements, will never constitute a true revival. In a genuine revival of spiritual life there is presupposed to have been a decline or falling away. Those who did run well in the race have | grown weary and been hindered—those who With holy boldness and earnest purpose did fight4 the good fight of faith' have become faint and feeble, and have unbelted the sword, laid aside the helmet, and stepped out of the battle- field. With such there is return and renewal of consecration. Among those who have backslidden, and declined into coldness, 'the fountains of tin are broken up;' there is the conviction of guilt because of this condition, and with true penitence of heart there is the spirit of fresh devotedness to God and a new beginning of obedience. Then, further, there are many in our Churches who, after ence partaking of the saving grace of God, never seem to make any advance beyond a spiritual babyhood, but cry continually to be fondled by mother Church, and to be fed upon milk diluted and sweetened; instead of by healthy exercise growing into strength, and entering the lists to do battle for the Lord. Such are aroused in a true revival to seek a higher Christian life and a more ad vanced spiritual state. Where a large number •f persons together are thus similarly moved there is revival, and where such is experienced there quickly follows an awakening among the unsaved. To bring about such a condition of things, special agents or agencies are often, and not always unwisely, employed; and as a rule the speciality of such season or work is a quickening and deepening of the emotional life—the emotion, of course, should be moral, and not merely^ animal. Feeling is chiefly appealed to, and rightly so; because with Christians, mostly, it is the feeling that is not equal to the knowledge. Only recently we had it reported that of 600 con versions in Newcastle, England, all except 20 had been trained in the Sunday-school; and throughout Scotland, where such large blessings have been enjoyed, the numbers added to the Church have been chiefly children of God's people—those whose minds have been intelli gently informed in the doctrines of God's Word, but whose hearts have remained comparatively unimpressed. Wherever the truth of God affects the heait with power there will be emotion, and often deep emotion. And in any large and mixed population, where the masses are not highly cultured, it would be impossible for a .great religious movement which has to do with the affections, and even the, passions, not to produce something that will jar, or shock refined thought or cultivated taste;—accor ding to men's temperaments there might even be in some cases hysteria. Yet on theso grounds are we to deny or refuse such movements for good! Wore we able to determine or control the progress of our Lord's we should no doubt greatly prefer a quiet and continuous advanoe, howeTer rapid, gat is not ours to choose. Throughout the Church's history progress has been made, not in a straight line, but in circlee. The- tide of spiritual life has moved on, not with smooth and, regular hew, but in waves,-the foroe and sweep of whichhave, appeared at times resist less. There have been summer and winter— seasons when the fields have been hard, and the trees bare of fruit or blossom or even leaf; and there have been seasons when,.under the warm breath of a spiritual spring-time, the. life has risen revealing its presence in rich foliage and abundant fruit, and the fields, have again yielded their increase. Such alternations may j not be the highest ideal of growth; but such ] have been; and in so far as ire are able | to discern, sudden and rapid -changes have i characterised thelifeof the. Church. When ] such revival seasons recur among us we need not: wonder at some accompanying excitements. If : we have faith in the old story of Pentecost we - shall deem them possible, and even probable. So not let us demur at this; neither presume to prescribe unto God what accidentals shall ■' attend His gracious work. Let us rather rejoioe in that we receive the blessing at His hands. Better to have life even with some extravagance ' rather than a dead form, although there might■ be all the symmetry and loveliness of sculptured marble. ' A live dog is better than a dead lion.' . " XJnder the old economy God evidently made provision for seasons of revival. At the great feasts held annually, the whole Jewish people gathered together, from every village and home, stead throughout the land; and merchants and traders even from foreign cities assembled in Jerusalem to worship God. Then, as they gazed upon the beautiful Temple, so associated with their whole history, linking the very humblest of their race with those glorious forefathers who had walked and talked with God; and as mingling together they worshipped before the veil spread over the burning glory of the Shekmah, and listened to the Psalms of David hymning from so many voices, their deepest feelings would be stirred, and the great heart of the nation would be lifted nearer God. By such special means God contributed to the mainte nance of religion among his people. "The rapid spread of the Christian Church during the first, second, and third centuries may be justly regarded as a continuous succession of revivals. From this period to the' beginning of the thirteenth century there does hot appear to have been any large 'outpouring ef the Holy Spirit;' but afterwards came the great Reforma tion, uahercd in by Wyoliffo, and Hues, and Luther. In later days occurred the reforms or revivals under Whitefield and the brothers Wesley; more. recently still the revivals in America, Ireland, and various parts of Great Britain; and now in our own day in Scotland. " Thus almost all the true life of the Church has been _ produced bv means of what we may term revivals.^ _ God has taken advantage of human excitability in order to produce powerful impressions, and. lead men into obedience. Owing to our natural inclinations towards the world, and the many influences drawing us away from the spiritual, we need these mighty impulses now and again to prevent us from sinking into utter coldness and death. Think of the present state of the Church. Does it not seem as though a heavy slumber had rested upon us, or a palsy had smitten us; that the visible world which is perishing should appear to be the only real world; and the spiritual world, the truths of heaven and hell, sinners perishing around us, and the all-sufficiency of God's grace, seem facta far away and shadowy? If Chnstendo ,om were really Christian, if pro fessors really believed instead of believing that they believe, if men were logical and consistent, the dread of damnation and the earnest seeking of life everlasting would constitute a phase of wonderful power in every intelligent souL Believing as we do the great truths of God's Word, is it not marvellous that revivals only recur at intervals? • Did we really believe, this condition of life, would be normal and regular in every Christian Church. We seem, indeed, to have been caught in the backwater of a receding wave; there appears ao little confidence in our beliefs, so little warmth and flow in our love, and so little enthusiasm in our service. '' Seeing, however, that as in nature, so in the spiritual life of the Church, there come seasons of renewal and revival, the all-important ques tion arises, Under what conditions can revival blessings be enjoyed, or in how far and to what extent can we promote a Christian revival ? 'Power belongeth unto God.' 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit* saith your God.' Tins, however, does not exclude method in the divine operations. That * power belongeth unto God' is equally true in nature, and yet we should never dream of securing health or gathering a harvest without conform ing to certain conditions and applying certain practical laws. Christians are far too prone to regard a revival of religion as some peculiar and miraculous event—something altogether beyond the reach of human influence or agency, and in no way coming under the ordinary rules of cause • and effect, or showing any connection between 1 means and the result. Such a doctrine is cer. { tainly not in harmony with any of God's acknow ledged methods of procedure, and for the Church ' to adopt would prove most dangerous. . " On every hand we observe the operation of law; and uniformly the Divine procedure is so regulated as to be available on onr behalf. Great physical forces everywhere offer themselves for our use—the rain to soften the soil, the sun*to ripen the corn, and the winds to waft our ships and bear our. cargoes home. Let .man act in sympathy with nature, and apply the powers within Ms reach, and they will pour the tides of their strength through all Ms labours, and yield him abundant good. Let man, on the other hand, think that his labour interferes with the sovereignty of God, or detracts from the Divine honour; and then, jnstead of turning up thedurrows of his fields, or spreading his sails to the breeze, let him fold his ; hands sentimentally and wait God's time for prosperity—Ms fields -will never laugh with har vest, nor will his ships ever reach their port. "Just as truly, there are near and about us m the spiritual realm infinite divine forces; and while all power belongeth unto God, so "that, in the, conversion and- sanctific&tion; of a single soul, He is supreme in His prerogative of bestowing the blessing, yet in these gracious acts He is a God of order; and jnst as tbere is method in all His other works, so there must be method here. God, if the powers of His grace be properly invoked, will undoubtedly, readily andadequately respond. He ' is waiting to be gracious;' yet Hie Church, rehiring te employ the, proper means, dreams en in vague expectation. "It is certainly the will of God that men should be saved, and as certainly that the eternal and unchanging God is always willing that men should be saved. It cannot be that God acts by fits and starts, feeling graciously disposed at one time—e.g. In times of revival—and then through long seasons of coldness in the Church, feeling altogether indifferent. Neither can our God be partial, cherishing different affections for His children in one land and His children in another land. Whatever Divine sovereignty means, it certainly cannot mean that because He wills it, | and for no other reason, He is withholding from us His blessings of mercy and power. The reason j for winter is not that the sun changes—that it is | more distant or less warm. All the difference to ub of summer and winter results from the difference of attitude or position the earth herself takes in her own orbit. Depend upon it, there is nothing our God so intensely desires as the salvation of men; and this should be clearly reoognised and fully admitted. In the Gospel, God has provided the means for saving men; and these means He entreats His people to employ— ' Go ye into all the world, ana preach the Gospel to every eaeature.' He ' now eommandeth all men everywhere to repent.' " One condition in the plan God has devised and revealed to us is that His grace shall reach men through man. God Himself, in visiting our world and dealing with mankind, ' was manifest in the flesh'—the man Christ Jesus. Of the early disciples' work we read, 'The Lord wrought with them,' or by means of them. * The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip' in order that Philip might evangelize at Azotus. Granting, then, that man is the medium through which God is pleased to bless our race, we come to the enquiry—What is the law or method which affects us, and by means of wMch the great work of grace, seen and felt more particu larly in times of revival, is produced and eon trolled ? " A true unnsnan revival is vjoas worn, ana born from above ; so that to ' get up a revival' is a phrase and a sentiment altogether out of place. For a true revival to be experienced there must be on the part of God's people the exercise of much faith and prayer; but under lying these as their foundation there must be real sympathy 'with God. Indeed, all religious life might bo thus defined—supreme sympathy or oneness of feeling with Him—in His love for all that is holy and true, but hatred of all that is evil—in His tender compassion for the sinner, but hatred against His sin- And throughout the Church true spiritual health is a genuine sympathy with God. The Divine method is to act wherever there is this true sympathy, or wherever there is the susceptibility to His influences. *IIe is waiting' to bo gracious;' but He works through us, and where there is the absence of true sympathy there the operations of God are hindered, and His power' is limited or restrained. Without doubt, the lack of power in the Church to-day may be traced to the lack of this feeling. We cannot ; be revived until we are willing to be revived. and also willing to yield ourselves up to the j claims and demands of & revived life. Many in our Churches want a revival which will&oi; involve much trouble or fnoonrenienOe, or that will oost no self-eaaifioe. Nearly aU Christum professors say we need and desire Gpd's Spirit, Let ns pray for iL And we urge fay all means pray for the blessing. But, brethren; let us se^, ^ to it nitm that we are true and sincere. ^ow : many atiama there are in ChrisFs Church} ' fbrfi one by membership in the Church pfo- ' fessed himself to be not his own^fa^c Christ's— bought with Sis precious hloo;i—and to His service he has vowed himself,. Yet with how , many, from Monday nntQ Saturday,' almost the first and last thought is' about self—the chief question, being how boat to advance personal interests rather than God!s work! How intense are the strain and energy devoted to laying up of this world's goods, or the securing of earthly" power, while the claims of a perishing world are unheeded! Hen profess in their creed to warship God, but they prove in their conduct, which all men read, that Jehovah is 4ethroned in their temple, , and the God they worship and serve is mammon. Now, this self-seeking and want of thoroughness and sincerity are altogether oat of sympathy - with, the Spirit of Ged, which is holy and loving and trae. Ab in the case of Ananias, part of the price is held bath,, and in Gpd's sight this is a lie, which grieves His Holy Spirit, and prevents His indwelling presence. Whenever the world comes between us and.God's light, there must be night and darkness. " In our Lord Jesns Christ we have the perfect exemplification of .a complete sympathy with God. In Him dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily. He could say, 'I and the Father are one.' How His life was expressed in prayer and labour! And for an illustration of this sympathy ruling in the hearts of a community, so as to promote a true spiritual revival, we may consider the first Christian Church at Jerusalem. Hero were men who knew the truth, and understood their mission in. the world, but felt they needed force in carrying that truth to others. To them Jesus had thus spokenv—* Behold, I send the promise of my Father 'upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high.' And this was emphatically .the endowment of Pentecost. In that upper room the disciples waited and received the Holy Ghost, who enlightened their understandings, gave force to their will, reality to their character, and intensity to all their life. And you may observe, it was when sympathy ruled their hearts, when they 'were all with one accord in one place, they received the promised blessing. Throughout the ten days'Wnd nights during which the disciples waited they bever wearied or lost sight of the Master's promise. None left the little company, or disappointed with the delay turned to other pursuits. They went up to the Temple regularly at the hour of worship, and between these times, gathered together for meditation and prayer. They waited and pleaded, pleaded and waited. At length on the morning of the tenth day, when their hearts were evidently prepared—when 'they were all with one accord in one place,' the precious promise was fulfilled. "Thus it has ever been. Where among God's people perfect sympathy with the Divine obtained, there has been manifest the full indwelling of God. But, brethren, this is not our case; and lacking this Sympathy with God, we lack the very condition upon which true revival blessings can be received. We scarcely realise to what a lamentable extent tbe Church of Christ is ont of sympathy with her Lord's work. We have tbe promise that nations shall be born in a day; and yet, suppose that the whole of our city, all classes, high and low, were now deeply moved with an earnest concern about eternity and salvation, each eagerly addressing the other, saying 'Let us come together and pray; let us seek the Lord's mercy'—men giving up a portion of the day from business or pleasure for worship and prayer—hundreds being converted —the telegraph lines bearing glad messages to all parts of the iand telling of the Lord's deal ings with ns here—what would be thought by professing Christians? All would wonder, many would be incredulous, and some would object to the gracious movement as containing too much excitement and interfering with trade. When we are prepared, as was that early Church—our hearts in full sympathy with God and His work —then He who is waiting to be gracious will not delay to bless. With a mighty fulness will He take possession of our spirits, moving us forward with a common impulse as the rushing wind through the forest turns every leaf on every tree in the one direction ef the gale. " Faith, prayer, and effort, all hold a most important place in the method of Christian revivals. Each must be in exercise. But true sympathy with God implies the possession of faith, and will most assuredly express itself in prayer and effort. "Prayer is the appointed means by which God's people shall obtain blessing—the prayer of faith He will always hear. By His sure pro mises we can lay hold of God, and say, * We will not let Thee go except thou bless us.' As God gives harvest to those who obey the laws of husbandry, so He gives blessings in answer to - prayer. It is the Divine law; and because God does not change His order, we always through prayer gain spiritual gifts which otherwise we never would enjoy. He inspires the prayer, and can and does respond. But prayer must be distinct and definite. The blind man for a long time cried—' Have mercy upon me, thou Son of David;' and our Lord's answer to that' prayer was, ' What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ?' When the man shaped the burden of his need into a definite request—' Lord, that I might receive my sight'—the blessing;was at Once given. Through the centuries the voice of prayer has not ceased, neither has the Lord's ear been heavy that it has not heard; but too often the prayer has been indefinite. To- day the Lord Asks His people; 'What' will ye that I should do unto you!' We need now to define our needs—'Lord that we might receive renewed life—life in our own souls, in our duties at home and in the mart, in our Church work and every service/ It may be with us as with Israel In the olden timer-God waits to bestow the gifts; yet to do these things He will be enquired of by the house, of Israel, not by one family or one individual,, but by the whole house. Were the Church as a whole in sym , pathy with God—for without this prayer will, not avail—did we really desire revival, with power to win souls, and did we plead this distinct prayer, revival would come. When Elijah was ready, the wood prepared, and the sacrifice laid upon the wood, then in answer to his cry the fire came down. There must be hi our .Churches « vast amount of fuel prepared. There areknowledg and experience resulting from years of labour. We need the fire from God to kindle all into a living sacrifice. Were we ready to cry with faith the fire would come. The waterpots are all filled. Had we faith enough to draw out now we should doubtless find all changed into the true wine of His kingdom. " Effort also enters into the method of Chris* tian revivals; and such in the use of appropriate means will be prompted by true sympathy with God. In so far as by preaching effort is made to arouse men, the doctrines held and. taught .must ,be according to the Scriptures—the Father's tender pitying love for sinners, the Saviour's all*su£Scient atonement and interces sory work, the Holy Spirit's regenerating and sanctifying influences through the Word. These teachings have ever been God's power unto the salvation of every one that believeth, whether 1 rude barbarian or polished Greek. Our re sources are quite equal to our work; for however feeble we are, One is with us whose might is omnipotent. Were we in true sympathy with God, we should all of us be out seeking souls, holding more meetings, and in prayers and labours more abundant. When there is a correct apprehension of these great truths of revelation, with a just recognition of the responsibilities they involve—when the feeling is equal to the knowledge, and each Church-member accepts the obligation, * let him that heareth say come," then will there be a wide-spread awakening, and inners will be converted unto God. "There still remains the practical question —' How on man's part is this spiritual condition to be attained ? Christian revival is revival of the inner spiritual life; the work must therefore commence with the individual. There must be honest self-examination. Very few of us, were we honestly to search our hearts ' and affections, our lives and conduct, but would find in one or other or both, reasons why God's blessings are restrained. One of the first things we need in order to bring about a better state of things is to deal honestly with our own con sciences. Te what a low ebb has our personal spiritual fife become reduced! How languid and torpid! What little true consecration to the Master, or reality and enthusiasn in His service do we realize! What little disposition have we to make sacrifice for the sake of others! We love our own plans and possessions and enjoy ments far more than His work, and would much rather indulge our love of ease than exert our selves for His sake. Have we ever spoken faithfully to another about his soul ? Do we not often, perhaps constantly, stay away without justifiable reason from the regular meeting for prayer, where our presence and sympathy would greatly encourage those who are working? In how far has a worldliness of spirit taken posses sion of me ? Is it possible that I can find more interest and zest in an evening at cards, or in an opera- house, than I do in seeking to win a soul for Christ? Do I really feel more anxious as to the fashion or appearance of my dress than for the possession of spiritual graces? ' If wo are honest with ourselves very many of us will scarcely wonder that God's might is so little felt in our midst. "There must be humble acceptance of all blame,-/ os be«alm and/faitkM la 6ar~sdf-. Ia<^8ir>ent. And if, in view of His claims and~ ?JHr privileges, we reoogrusa onr rariritual stake .j>be poor and mieerable and low] let us humbly j acknowledge bur guilt. It is not our Lord's wul 'that we should be thus weak. We hate neglected i ourselves, and boen unfaithful. When our oon-; scio'usness of blaine is 'deepened, we shall be dis posed to seek that - dear Lord - whom we' have forsaken, but who pleads with us to return, and is smiting to renew our strength. "/There must he faithful recourse to Jesus Christ for renewed consecration. Often when men are conscious, of feebleness or failure, they seek to rouse themselves by spasmodic efforts of self-condemnation, and fresh vows of devotion. But working from, their own feelings merely th^r ▼ows soon ' fade 'and fail, and they sink into a condition more gloomy and' zatal than ever. Christ is our Me,' and fellowship with Him alone can renew, strengthen, ana :mature the inner life. ' Our life has not an independent existenoe, It flows from Him,as the stream flowfej from its fountain springs, or light from the son. 'As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ve except ye abide in me.' Communion with Him is real power. When like a branch in the tree we abide in Him, then like the sap He will abide and move in us. ' "There must be a ready response. in our conduct to the gracious influences of God. Were thiB spirit common throughout the Church of Christ thepe would be no need for fresh or novel appliances or forced excitements. The true spirit of the Saviour—perfect sympathy with the Divine—would pour its living strength through ail our ordinary plans of work—Sunday, schools, Bible-classes, and home instruction. The machinery is not broken, but only needs impelling power, and that we riiould realize in the spirit of Christ, "Dear Brethren, we may surely indulge the hope that all have come together to these meetings earnestly dealing the blessing of God; and we trust that when we shall return to our respective homes and spheres of labour, it will be with an increased spirit of conseoration to our Lord. Whatever xnay be our opinions as to the means we should adopt in order ;to promote revival in our work, let us not depend upon any novelty of form or teaching, but simply upon the Master and the power of His might. Let us humbly and earnestly seek from the Lord a spirit of loving unify and devotednees. By . such; com munion with Him to whom belongeth all power, we shall be made better men, better ministers, and better members of His one Ghurch. " We do ■ believe in prayer, and in united prayer. As one practical outcome of this occasion, could not the Churches here repre sented agree upon concerted action, to plead with God for revival blessings; that at a date to be fixed special services during one week should be held in all our Churches throughout the colony? Such special services would surely stir the hearts of many of our people, and accom plish much good. Attention to divine things would be awakened, and self-examination, with more earnest prayer and effort, would result. From every, part of the land the cry would arise, which cry God would hear and answer, 'Wilt Thou not revive us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee V " (Applause.) The Rev. J. M. Day, of Kapunda, proposed a vote of thanim to Mr. Lambert;-also that the address be printed in Irvih, and Progress. If it were not out of place' he would have liked to have noticed a motion given for consideration next day in reference to the suggestion thrown out in the last paragraph of the address, but probably there would be more members from the country present in the morning, and they would then be in' a better position to discuss the question as to whether it would be possible to have a week's special services throughout the denomination. It was generally understood that they should not enter into anything like an elaborate discussion upon the subject of the address, and therefore he would not enlarge upon the matter. The Bev. J. L. FARSONS, of North Adelaide, seconded, expressing his sense of the enjoyment, as well as mental profit, produced by the address. Attention had been for some time directed to the subject of revivals, and there could, he thought, be very little doubt that all sincere Christians desired to see special in addition to the ordinary services. It seemed clearly to him that however they might endeavour to define the method the revival lay outride the method. He then referred to the revivals of the middle and early ages, and the methods adopted by Wesley, "Whitfield, Jonathan Edwards, and others. How ever, they might shape their ideas as to method, they were, he affirmed, brought hack to the point so clearly mentioned in the address, viz., that all power of revival was from on High. Still they might utilize the means at their com mand in order to assist themselves in their progress. -1 - - The Bev. Mr. Pares suggested that the matters should be thrown open for free dis cussion, and trusted that no formality or want of formality would prevent their esteemed Con gregational brethren from expressing their senti ments on the subject that had been dealt with. The Chairman, on behalf of the Baptist Church generally, expressed the great pleasure that was felt t at f the presence of their dear brethren. They did feel that they werej very ' near to them, and they believed as Christians that there were many tnithB quite as important if not more important than that which separated them. He quite ^believed that on -the main points both -Baptists and Pse do-Baptists were really one. (Hear, hear.} The Bev. J. Jefeeris said that Mr.Byrnes and himself came that night charged with mes sages of goodwill and fraternalsympathyfrom the Congregational Union, and these he had great pleasure in offering. (Hear, hear.) He.had often thought what'a loss of power arose from the holding of such a meeting as the present and another which it. was proposed to hold shortly as two separate gatherings instead of one united meeting. If they could act in concert they would not only double their indiridual strength, but they Would, he was convinced, become four fold stronger;; In his early years he had had many a dream of a union between the Bap tists and Congregationalists, but more mature life brought with it many points' of sadness, amounting Jin some particulars almost to melancholy* JBte was sorry that in this in stance he could not now indulge in dreams of union as he used to, but still he hoped that the ' good day would come eventually. It would, be well if they were to adopt the suggestion thrown out by the Rev, Mr, Mead some twelve months or twe years ago, with which .he at the time cordially sympathized, viz., that Churches should be both Baptist- and Congregational, all neces sary appliances for the offices of either creed being provided. 1 He had,' he mentioned, almost as much sympathy for the Baptist insti tutions as for his own. He trusted the Associa tion would help them in reference to Union College—an institution founded by-the Baptists, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists for the purpose of giving a good biblical and literary training to such young men as were likely to be engaged In preaching the Gospel. Mir. Mead and himself had worked together with the utmost harmony and good feeling. He trusted they would continue to do their best to support and assist what he might be pardoned for calling an admirable institution. (Hear, hear.) ; The Bev. C. B. Syjdes thought the burden of their subject was just this—" Brethren, we salute you," and affirmed that the generic re semblances between the two sects were far stronger than the specific differences, for what* ; ever the latter might be they both sought to ; bring the Gospel to the perishing. There was truth in the resemblance that evoked their deepest feelings, and therefore they would re* joice in each other's success. They did not rejoice in that which tended to part them, neither did they pretend to wish success in preaching pure baptism, but rather the Word ef God. The ties of affection would become closer and more stringent just in proportion as these difficulties were felt more and more to be of a secondary character to the supreme object in view. He had long cherished a hope of union between the Baptists and Independents, but he had begun to feel that it was almost impracticable, and there could be no union without a tacit admission that the principles -upon which the denominations were formed were not sufficient to warrant the existence of two separate sects. Such an admis sion could hardly be looked for, and theymust do their separate works, and simply strive to avoid any collision that would endanger the leading interests of the Christian Church. He trusted there would be a desire on both rides to avoid any such division of the spiritual interest in any particular locality. He rejoiced in listening to the paper read by the Chairman, which he thought contained so many faithful and dis criminating statements, in which, too, they all felt deeply interested. There would not, he thought, be any propriety under the circum stances in his endeavouring to speak on the paper; but be might mention that he felt it to Be their-duty, as Christian Churches, to continue in prayer, although he was not prepared to say that that would bring about a revival of the spiritual life just at the present period. They must await the Master's fulness of time; for while it was their duty most, humbly and constantly to wait upon God, it was not for them to dictate the time of the bestowal of tno desired blessing. He begged to respond thank fully to the cordial welcome they as delegates had received, and expressed the sincere inte rest felt by the Congregational Union in the spiritual welfare of lh6 Baptist denomination, i (Applause.) The Bev. Mr. Pbjce supported the motion vaty coidullyi oonedtringfn the opinionthat the attention drawn to the subject of rerinli was ^ most timely. "They did not, lie remarked** believe In bat rather in '* believen? : baptism—{Hear, near)—and be said tins the more readily because his sympathies and interests with respect to believers amongst chfldren had - -been intensified through reading three productions i '—a set of'papers contributed b^r the Bev. lO. ; Dale, of Birmingham, to the Congr&rationaUtt; j a paper read by Mr. Symas before the Congre- ] gational Union, upon the doctrinal basis upon | which they proceeded in efforts among the J young ; and a very .practical paper read "by j Mr. Jefferis at the same time.

A Prayer Union had been already formed in the colony, in connection with whidh there were 12 or IS ministers of seven or eight different denominations,' (Hear, bear.) ; . The' meeting was closed with devotional exercises.
