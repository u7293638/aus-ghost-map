[?] BETWEEN JOT AND BOEEOW. Bxtwkn joy andoonow. As 'twixt day and morrow, I lay for a space; And I beard, so lying, Myold Grief sighing, From her far-off place. I said, ' Thon art over ; And where dreams hover Thou bovereat now ; In Hie land of thy dwelling ?What water* in walling, And blossoms what bough P Old tears are its riven, The wind that there quivers ? Is breath of old signs ; 'Wreck-strewn ore the shores there, Ahd^sunset cndurea there Through infinite skies. ' But all there is quiet; There no ware makes riot On the waif-cumbered coasts, I Where thou movesfbanished, But not quite vanished— A ghost among ghosts.' —Philip Bourkt UaritoH in the Athtiueum.
