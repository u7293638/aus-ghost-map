THE WESTERN RAILWAY. THE Demonstration on Friday last showed one thing pretty clearly and that is that the public are in earnest on the subject. We give an account of the pro- ceedings. There was somthing more than set intentionsâ€”there was enthusiasm abroad. Nothing less than this could have prompted thousands to escort into Launceston the members who supported the railway bill. The largest room in the Mechanics' Institute was crowded with upwards of four hundred persons who each paid three shillings and six- pence for their cards of admission. In the evening the theatre was chosen in which to hold the meeting, and it was crammed, while hundreds were outside that could not obtain access to any part of the house. There were upwards of thirteen hundred within the walls. Another feature of this demonstration was its quiet businesslike demeanour. There was no rowdyism ; no offensive language uttered aloud ; not a pane of glass broken, not a breach of the peace committed, and not a watch- house case for next day's adjudication. A large number of gentlemen from the country were present, and there would have been many more had not the recent wet weather and backward season kept the farmers busy putting their seed in for the next crop. There appears to be a wonderful unanimity on the subject : the ghost of opposition did not in any in- stance exhibit itself. It reflects great credit on the inhabitants that they can meet in masses after being defeated by stolid ignorance and mistaken self-in- terest, and without a single offen- sive word or act set themselves a-fresh to the work, with a determination that it shall be accom- plished. It was the largest demonstra- tion ever seen in Launceston, and it was the most orderly. The Ministry that tri- fles with or tramples upon the interests of men so much in earnest cannot have a long tenure of office.
