The Old House. , In through the poroh and up the silent stair ; Little is ohanged, I know BO well tho ways ;? ll ere the dead came to meet me ; it was there ' The dream was dreamed in unforgotten days. But who is this that hurries on before, . A flitting shade the brooding shades among ? She turned-I saw her face-Ã– God, it wore The faoe I used to wear when I was young ! I thought my spirit and my heirt were tamed To deadness; hut the pangs that agonise. .The old grief springs to choke me-I ana shamed Before that little ghost with eager eyeB. O turn away, lot her not see, not know ! How should she bear it, how should understand ? O .hasten down the stairway, haste and go, . And, leave her dreaming in the silent land.
