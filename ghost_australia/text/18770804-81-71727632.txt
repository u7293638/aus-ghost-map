Mail Jîews. .following account of tn« sinking 'of a ' "freçonà Turkish ironclad in tbs ""Danube is .telegraphed by tho special correspondent of the'5tîmes' at Buckharest:-"One of thç most', daring deeds ever recorded in the _ history of warfare was performed on the ïr*;Ijôwer Danube^ near Ibraila, -on Saturday 1f morning, May '26. A small detachment 'of "Russian -soldiers, commanded by Lieu '}'' '.tenant Dubaschiff, accompanied by the 'commander of the Roumanian flotilla, Major 'Mufgoséh,' left the northern shore of the Danube' in a number of small boats, and pi-Oceeded^ towards - the point Petra Fetei, below Machio, and ' opposite ." Ibraila, at wjiicb ,- point there was stationed a large .Tnrkish monitor. . The night was very dark, and they managed :to. Burround the monitor before being discovered by the Turkish ©entries on board.' They were challenged, and ?* who goes there ' rung out on the. night air. Major Murgesen implied in ' Turkish, ' friends.' The Turks, evidently not satisfied, commenced firing in the uircction of Matchin, "not knowing' : where, .these boats were. During the firing, > several of the Russian soldiers, under, the. direction of Lieutenant .Rubascíiiff, 'plunged.into",the water, swam ?silently to the hull of the ironclad vessel, and placed the deadly 1 'torpedo in close contact ,' "'"withitHe bottom' of the monitor. After the '. destructive machine had been securely fastened,'and the wire of an electric battery "had been'accurately adjusted, the men retired ' to the neighbouring shore of the river, and at half-past 3 in the morning the monitor was blowni intoithe'air, : with all the officers and ," crew.' The explosion was terrific; and-ns nothing is said'of the crew being savedji it is . supposed that all on board perished with the ' vessel. ' The cool determination . with wliïeh , this fearful enterprise was successfully carried '.out'"speaks' for itself. , The"fate pf the second "" Turkish monitor already sent ' to the1 bottom .of the Danube with all' on board shows how futile is the expectation that- gunboats can maintain the < mastery of aviver liiied with .'O ijhostile :,? batteries^., filled... with enemies as !,asf.resoluteas the mon whose deeds are recorded above'. The name of the monitor destroyed , : ...wasche Dar Martin.", ,' A'German surgeon from Ardahan' reports .', that af ter capturing that fortress the Russians '^.'?Iplnndëred;èvery'house'. and violated every woman, set fire to the hospital, and the t- Wounded soldiers' perished in the flames. The race between Boyd' andHiggins was i,. :> rowed.in tempestsof .wind and rain, and the u ltriver, was, Jasned , into angry roar. "As B.oyd was ,knpwn to be suÖering from an attack of b'óiis, "tfie betting waa ..strongly in favour of' ^ , Higgins. ; A clear lead of two lengths was "gained at the start by. Boyd," whö~'froni that'; moment'held ' ¿lie'"race secure, Higgins not having'a ghost bf a- chance " against him. Altogether it was a hollow affair. The ' Daily fc-Telëgrapîi' commenting on - the race says there w is a'space of at least 200 yards between-the j men.. as "Boyd - went i .under TJJT., Barnes',Bridge,; .and that he could have won' Suilby.a'.quarter of a mile is undeniable had ho not judiciously slackened his pace ; « s it was,' f ,- Higgins, who-showed an utter, inability to 'contend vñjUí rough* .water, was aboutHO . lengths behind at the finish. Boyd won in .n.ij gs-^fouiés'-ÎJ*seWndsi 'by 'Benson's chrono'-* ii-'a meter''watch. With the stakes of í£400 and the scullers' championship, Boyd also took as ..v: « challenge trophy the handsome cup given by ,'auJ.ïth'e proprietors of a Nowcastle paper. It is very likely that Boyd or Blackman will go to Australia and there compete with Trickett, who last June, easily defeated Joseph Sadler .'jj^ forrthevTl]amçs. championship,, but deoline'dj, V * 'before leaving'Ërigiànd, to'row^with- Higgins." \- P .The date of the departure of the Czar from r *"^^lt'^1.*1^s'1 -ï3 purposely not made known. , ''"'^ITbe1 frequent ?uccidents1bn the' ' Roumanian ( \\\railways has ' given rise ' to a'fear that a , *' " conspiracy tb' cahse his death is afloat.
