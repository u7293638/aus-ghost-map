ELECTIONS. The threats of violenoe prevented many re- spectable citizens from recording their votes for aldermen on the day of election, and have given the slumocracy some advantages at the poll. The consequence has most likely been the return of persons whose habits and education totally unfit them for its duties, and who will certainly render the office they disgrace no longer an object of ambition. If the corporation had been entirely com- posed of respectable men, the practical value of municipalities ought to have been tested ; but now we shall scarcely know what to charge to the institution, and what to ascribe to its temporary representatives. We are aware that many persons do not look on the issue of the election as of very great importance ; but they will find them- selves mistaken. The character of the city will be identified with the character of its civic representatives in the eyes of the world. If it should be known that the convict department can actually and openly influence a municipal election, will any respectable person commit his for- tunes to the fate of such a city ? The pot- houses will thrive, but the tradesmen, citizens, and landowners of this city-as well as all who have the supplying of the wants of a commercial port, would be sac- rificed by the ascendancy of the slums. We cannot think that in the late election the citizens of Hobart Town discharged their duty. Had they polled, not the ghost of the scoundrel faction would have appeared at the board, and the city would have been protected from the pollution and peculation which will be sure to follow if the represen- tatives of the convict faction ever gain the smallest footing in public affairs.
