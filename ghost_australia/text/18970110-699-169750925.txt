BY BRIGHT C00GEE. ? e ? A Maoriland Exile's Lament. By bright Coogee, where the surges break On the rocky coast in tnund'rous roar ; And the glittering crests bright foam-clouds make, As they Bweep on shoreward evermore : As they surge, and sweep in their restless rage, And tear at the rocks that they may not move ; . They moah as they've moaned for many an And they stir my heart like remembered love, Beneath the emerald and drifting enow. The long brown arms of the seaweeds wave ; Like the ghosts of a buried long ago, Like the shadowe.that haunt a loved-oae'a grave. With wild uprearing of gold-brown arms, . They sway and sink 'neath each breaking i swell. TW seem to call with a mermaid's charms, ra me in their cool retreat to dwell. ihlSweetis tbe breath of my Love, the sea ! a)i 1 Sweet are the breezes that from, her \ blow. As tney fan my brow they solace me Wijth a solace 1 only here can know. The Kief iern winds come softly in Fron.Yny Island home beyond the blue, Ana mjrpul soars high 'bo've sordid sin And 'fills, dear home, again with you. Where tn- waves break soft on the glittering \ 8SIA-, They se'Pv to bear a kiss to me ; From lips wove in that far-off land, That' ianVd never again may see. And, whertYWn the stern black rocka they And sob, aw sigh, in ceaseless pain ; They rouse lawny heart an echoing tone, They strikiMta chords to an answering strain. U At Bright Coot« is incense sweet ,- The sighwi aiAV the scents of a wave-beat stranti. V To my wearied syul is that incense meet, For it warts it home to its native land. There is no spot on this haunted coast, On the ariolrodks that bound tbe sea, That moves my heart— till it breaks almost, With passion-sweet pain— like Bright Ooogee. \ \ \ NEVILLE FOBDEB. u
