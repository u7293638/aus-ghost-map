THE THEATRES, A THEATRE ROYAL. Mr. Dampier experienced a most enthusiastic reception from a large audience at this house on Saturday evening, when he re appeared, after a long absence, as Hamlet He has not improved, as Madeira does, by a voyage round the world at any rate in the particular character It gave one the impression of being, like the melancholy of Jaques, " compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of his travels, in which his often rumination wrapped him in a most humorous sadness You could not help feeling that he had probably seen several Hamlets in England and the United States, reminiscences of whom were allowed, intentionally or unconsciously, to influence his own interpretation of the character There was no unity of conception, nor con- sistency of execution, and the result was in unequal and inharmonious performance Mr Dampier a Hamlet on Saturday evening had neither the grace and dignity of the Prince who was the glass of fashion and the mould of form, nor the intellectual refinement of the scholar whose "noble and won the admiration of Ophelia And it was grievously disappointing the cordingly, while the misreading of the text were so numerous as to be scarcely excusable on the ground that they were the result of a treacherous memory, cry - "Tempt for "Tent him to the quick,' " take up arms " for " take arms, ' there a the calamity that makes death of such long life,' for "there the respect that makes calamity of so long life, ' who would these fardels bear for " who would farces bear, a " that hath not twentieth part of your precedent lord for " that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord and " the circumstance I told thee of-my father a death, for " the circumstance, which I have told thee, of my father a death In the last named passage, the meaning of Hamlets words 18 altogether distorted, because he is alluding to the mode of his father a decease, __j)¿ndriot to the mere event itself And again, atÍ_-_C¿ose of the closet scene with his mother, MT^fHPpier-d-Claima in a loud voice the passage marked in the idea., is an "aside," namely " I must be cruel, only to be kind, Thus bad begins and worse remains behind ' In this same scene, moreover although the full length portraits of the former king of Denmark are painted on the arras, Mr Dampier adheres to the obv equally erroneous medallion or miniature business We say " obviously," because the case made out by Mr Henry Irving against the practice, in the current number of the Nineteenth Century, in " An Actor 8 Notes on Shakspeare, appears to us to be unanswerable Tom Davies, nearly a hundred years ago, pointed out the absurdity of using hand pictures, and, as Mr Irving acutely remarks " The words *' ' A station, like the herald Mercury, show lighted on a heaven kissing hill, show that the pictures are full length figures, either material works or painted by Hamlet with the brush of memory, and that they were the latter is far from improbable We have said that Mr Dampier's performance was, in our judgment, a disappointing one but it is only right to add that this was not the verdict of a crowded pit and a well filled gallery, by the occupants of which the actor was called before the curtain after almost ever, act The part of Ophelia served to introduce to a Melbourne audience Miss Ada Lester, a young lady with a light, the head voice, an artificial delivery, and an equally artificial manner We do not know whether the demeanour of Ophelia in the first scene of the third act was prompted by MiasLeater s own notions of the character or was arranged for her with a view to an effective exit by Mr Dampier, but it was wholly foreign to the nature of one who, as the finest of her critics had said of her " Seems in her loveliness and perfect purity like a seraph that had wandered out of bounds, and yet breathed on earth the air of paradise That Ophelia, after having listened to the outrageous reproaches of Hamlet, and after having been enjoined, if she must needs many, to marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you (women make of them should 1 by her head upon the prince s breast and stoop to receive Jus endearments, is simply revolting, and brings down Ophelia to the moral level of the woman who, in the original History of Amleth the Dane is employed as an amateur ment to seduce the heir to the throne Mr Carey's reading of the passages assigned to the Ghost was impressive, and would have been still more so if he had dropped the tremor in his voice Mr Stuart O'Brien infused the requisite amount of senile humour into the character of Polonius, and the Lord Chamberlain's son found a spirited representative in Mr Appleton Mr Gladstone's careful and unpretentious deli very of the language which the dramatist puts into the mouth of Her itto, offered an agreeable contrast to the turbulent rant of Mr Sefton as the King Indeed it was perfectly exasperating to hear this gentleman mouthing to the audience that wonderful exhibition of moral anatomy and mental analysis, that awful picture of an internal conflict between a remorseless conscience and malignant passions, which Shakespere has given us in the soliloquy beginning "Oh my offence is rank, it smells to heaven Coming, as it did, so soon after Hamlet a energetic protest against such "robustness, periwig pated fellows as " tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,' one could not help pondering on the question whether actors really under stand that those words were addressed to themselves by one who was a player as well as a playwright himself, and who is reported to have schooled the first Hamlet, and to have acted the Ghost in this very tragedy' Miss Anstead appeared to greater advantage in the Queen than in any part we have seen her undertake, and Oaric is just fitted to Mr Taylor s voice and manner Mr Dampier is announced to appear on Tuesday evening in the " Courier of Lyons, in which he will sustain one of those character parts in which he is qualified to excel. THE TOWN HALL MADEMOISELLE"CHÄR_ONNETS CON CERT On Saturday night, at the Town hall, Mademoiselle Alice Charbonnet, of the Paris Conservatoire de Musique, made her first appearance before a Melbourne audience, and before the evening was over she achieved a brilliant success She is a young but very talented artist, her appearance is highly pleasing, and her manner before the audience in receiving and acknowledging applause 18 properly described by the term effusive, but at the same time it is graceful and proper Her first performance consisted of Beethoven's well known "Moonlight Sonata," which was the least effective of anything she did during the evening, otherwise we should have said above that she at once achieved a brilliant success Mademoiselle Charbonnet a interpretation of the slow movement of Beethoven's highly imaginative composition differs greatly from that which we consider to be the true and traditional style With us, the influence of this remarkable movement when properly played has always been to excite in the imagination the scene of a limitless sky-blue almost to blackness through the profound depths of which shine points of starry light, while in the nearer space the mild effulgence of the lunar rays relieve a solemnity which would otherwise be awful The title suggests the image, the music gives form and colour to it. The picture is that of calm profound and solemn and so should the music be To turn from simile to description, we find that in this instance Mademoiselle Charbonnet breaks the even sequence of the thematic tones by hard and forcible touches in the loss, which disturb the ear and destroy illu- sion. To speak more concisely, Mademoiselle Charbonnet would make a nearer approach to the highest standard of interpretation if she would play this movement more tenderly, more evenly, and let us say more sentimentally And now having mentioned, as in duty bound, the one aspect of her playing with which we cannot wholly agree, we come to the more agreeable task of praising with warmth and without stint the method she displayed in her succeed- ing performances The "Moonlight Sonata led to a double recall, and finally to an encore In response to this she played an allegro movement in C sharp minor, by Rica in the execution of this style of music she rose at once to the highest level of excellence, with which we are acquainted in this country The reader may attribute to her all that he may remember of dainty grace and lightness of touch of lying fingers which in their swiftest passages bit with unerring accuracy and right strength the key indicated in the music-of hands that are equal in power at either end of the key board, and which are under such perfect control that the work they have to perform has about it the polished air of perfect finish At the end of the first part Mademoiselle Charbonnet played Mendelssohn's Concerto in G minor with an accompaniment of strings as follows namely-A'lolms-1st, Signor Orton and Mr Cope, 2nd, Herr Ilegrat tenor, Mr J Ager, v violoncello, Mr A Montague, contra basso, Herr Plock It was amongst these latter that the beautiful theme of the andante movement was treated with all becoming effect, while at the pianoforte Mademoiselle Charbonnet seemed to spread around it a musical halo of sparkling accompaniment The presto move event is a familiar and very spirited theme, and it was really so admirably treated by every one concerned, that in compliance with the loudly expressed wish of the audience it was repeated The Kreutzer Sonata, played by Mademoiselle Charbonnet and Signor Often served to show both those accomplished players in a most favourable light The music in this composition is so full of meaning that it (gives line scope to the players mind in the interpretation of it, and we must say that barring the second variation which was taken a shade too fast by the violin we do not remember to have enjoyed at an time a better performance of it than we heard on Saturday night it in the most conversational music that we know of It suggests two friends of high and sensitive minds discussing a subject dear to both, now disputing now expostulating here the prospect of a wide difference of opinion, there the regret at the falling out of friends, and finally the happy agreement and delight at the restoration of mutual confidence and esteem It was most delight- fully played Finally Mademoiselle Char bonnet played The Prayer from Thalberg a grand fantasia on themes from " Most in Egitto In this the player introduced nearly every variety of ornamental touch with admirable power, grace and skill, and set off the august harmonies of the Prayer with Thalberts fanciful accompaniment in such a manner as that player himself might have excelled in force, but not in delicacy or in grace Throughout the evening Mdlle Charbonnet was constantly cheered, and was made the recipient of more bouquets than she could conveniently well carry, and she was accepted by the audience as an artist of the first rank Signor Orton delighted his hearers with VA Yamawaki s ' Souvenir de Moa ow, with the string accompaniment before mentioned and in the second part he played, for the first time in Melbourne, a magnificent fantasia by Marzorati on themes from LuciadiLammer moor The treatment of the theme, ' Chi mi friend, with arpeggios col also, be longed to the highest order of execution Airs Cutter was encored for singing Tescas A wanderer, and in reply substituted Mej or beer s ' I iahennaiden Die same comply ment was paid to Signor Paladini, who had to repeat 'Mappan, from the opera Martha His Excellency the Governor and his suite arrived at 8 o'clock, and remained during the concert The National Anthem was played on the organ by the conductor Mr Julius acres both on the arrival and departure of His Excellency ACADEMY OF MUSIC Mr Geo Rignold made his first appearance at this theatre on Saturday night and his return to Melbourne was warmly welcomed by a crowded house The programme con- stated of Messrs Palgrave, Simpson and Herman Alenv nie s comedy drama 'Alone and Douglas Jerrold's Black-eyed Susan, in both of which Mr Rignold s admirable acting at the 1 Theatre Royal in November last is well remembered His impersonation of Colonel Challice, a blind old officer, in the first piece, is an extremely life like and interest mg performance and the many simple touches of pathos which the representation of this character requires are rendered by Mr Rignold with an art which conceals all art The audienceonSaturdaymghtwere not slow in expressing their nppreciationoftheactoraabihty, and he was warmly applauded at the close of every Scene The character of Maud Trevor (or Margaret Chalice), the devoted daughter of the colonel was sympathetically represented by Miss Laura W Bateman, who, however, would have been more successful had she been a little less tearful Miss Jenny Watt Tanner took the accessory part of the charming young widow, Mrs Thornton, in which she fully succeeded in charming the audience as well as Dr Micklethwaite (Mr Metcalfe) Miss Jenny Watt (to use the name by which she is best known to Melbourne playgoers) has by the exercise of industry and intelligence, succeeded in acquiring an excellent reputation in her profession, and it is hardly too much to say that on each ap pearance she Show s signs of improvement in her art Her acting in the part of Mrs Thornton, at the Theatre Royal a few months ago, was very satisfactory, but on Saturday night she was even more successful, and exhibited powers of light comedy of a very high order As Captain Cameron, Mr H Flemming played in the easy, natural manner usual with him, and as Stratton Straw less, the low comedy character of the piece, Mr Olly Deering was quite in his element The piece, though of simple mate nalB, is a very excellent one, and retains the interest and attention of the audience from first to last As AVilham, in " Black eyed Susan,' Mr Rignold showed his versatility by being every inch a sailor, such as Dibdin sang of Miss Watt Tanner, who made a pretty and interesting She, must have found his acting of the most realistic character in the scene where William testifies his joy on returning to his wife after a three years' cruise This scene proved most divert ing to the audience the warmth of William s embraces being admitted to be of the most sailor like and appropriate description Mr Hall, as Gnatbram, was, of course, amusing, and as Quid the boatswain, Mr Olly Deering, judging by his performance, might have obtained that rank in real life by a lengthened service before the mast The other characters call for no special mention, but as a whole the drama was very efficiently performed, and the stage accessories were excellent THE Literary World says "we have just made a discovery that will interest some of our readers The lady who wrote, under the name of Mrs Markham, delightful books for children, was a Mrs Penrose, wife of Mr Penrose, incumbent of Bracebridge, near Lincoln She was the niece of the far famed Major Cartwright ' MR VAL PRINSEP has made considerable progress with the large and íniportantpicture which is designed to represent the proclama- tion of the Empress of India before Lord Lytton In order to prepare this picture the artist went to India, where he remained more than a year, and gathered indispensable materials, including a series of portrait studies of native princes, each in his appropriate costume, 30 in number, forming admirable illustrations of character enriched with fine colouring and men of spirit, a series which might fitly find a place in the India House
