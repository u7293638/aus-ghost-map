Why Bid He Wed Her ? — ? ?? ? v ? BY MRS. SOUTHWORTH. AUTEOB OF 'THE HIDDEN HAND,' 'SELF- MADE,' 'THE BRIDE OP AS EVENING,' &c;'. CHAPTEB Till.— A Waitixg Bbuxe. j&boufc; the same time tliat Cleve Stuart and Lamia Leegh. sat together in the parlor of the Vanaltari mansion, going through their final explanation — Palma Hay, the 1 poor little bride-elect, reclined on her rest ing chair, at the Iront window of her room ' 'where her betrothed had left her, three Tnvniis V»efnre_ Near her sat Mrs. Pole in another easy chair. The keroseite light on the centre table had been turned very low and seemed now only a spark in the darkness of the room; 'while Been through the front 'windows, the starlit might was beautiful above the wooded hills, and fragrant with the odor of the pines and cedars. ?Child,1 said Mrs. Pole, after a long silence, ' it is late, ji is time for you to go to bed. v You have not eat up eo long for two months past.' * I know it, Poly. Mot since the begin ning of my illnesB ; but, then, I have never felt so well — physically I mean — as I do to night. It is eo delicious here. One must feel well — in body at least,* replied the girlj with a scarcely perceptible reserva tion. * Then, my dear, yon should try to keep up that good state by taking care of your self, and going right to bed, and to sleep.9 * Oh, Poly, I can not, dear. I would rather sit here by the window and watch the stars shining over the wooded hills. If I were to go to bed, I could not sleep. Oh, Poly, Poly, I can keep it to myself no longer. I must tell you,' she sighed, and paused. * Why, what in the world is it, my child ? What on earth should yon have to tell me ?' 'c Oh, dear, old friend, I do not know why it should be, but there is such a heavy weight on my heart, such a dark shadow over my mind, as of some impending calamity.' . , * & weight ©a your mind? What a notion. It is only your nerves, child. You have gone through a good deal yesterday *nd to-day, and your nerves have given way, and that is a sign you 6hould go to bed.' \- * Oh, I cannot, Poly dear. You don't know how I feel. Such gloom and heavi ness.' . . . ? * Bat what is it about, child ? Anything in partic'I&r;, now ?' * JKfp, it is nothing that I can — make out. It is vague, nebulouslr horrible !' **Now I bet anything in this world as it is nothing at all but them there spring chickens 3^3mdJbr'iled,f--r supper ;V esEclf&ned; Mrs. :-i$te^V-:^ f- .-?*?; *?',???- ;??-.? r'^fr'r \ *$i©*r/ continuedihe woman, 'there aint nothing on earth as sounds more dainty, and SeliHt, and dergesterble than fresh, young spring jcheckens ««iE Sjr'iled.

I feel as if some heavy misfortune were hanging; over me — Bomethingr^-coming — through Gleve,* she said, slowly and thoughtfully, as if she were trying to -ie- j fine the indefiinable dread that, darkened her soul. ' And, oh ! you know, Poly dear,' she added, 'that anything which ehoaild hurt him -would almost Mil me.' s 'Yes, chile, I know. But what should hurt that fin8, strong young genSemanV He can take care of himself, and lie will. You may depend on that.' ,? ' I don't know- There are such events as I railway collisions, you know, and other j accidents, also, in 'which strength is of little avail ; and some one has said or written that ) ' it is the unexpected which always hap- ! pens.' ' * And that is jnsc as true as if it E-jad never been said or written . So 'make your mind easy. You are all right there. You are fearing some trouble, and therefore it won't fall on you. And you are .not ex pecting that everything will go well. Therefore Mr. Stuart will arrive here to-morrow safe and sound. You'll see? Why, chile, these here forebodings ai-e common enough among young people* who are looking forward to something and 'fraid of being disappointed. Why, I reckon there was never a young girl getting ready for her first ball — let alone to be married — as wasn't feared it would rain, or somebody would die, or something would happen to disappoint her!' ' Is that really so, Poly ?' ' Really and truly. Bui nothing ever does happen as is foreboded.' ' Is that so, too, Poly ?' * Positively and truly. So you go on thinking as there will be a collishun of the steam' cars, or something else, and then Mr. Stuart -will arrive all safe and well .to morrow. But, lovey, when he do arrive, yon would like him to find you looking well and pretty, wouldn't you ?' ? . ' Oh, yes, indeed, Poly.* * Well, then, you must take yonrsago bis cuits and iced milk punch and go to bed. Lying down will do you good, even if you do not sleep.' ' Very well, Poly, I will, but, oh. !— ' Heavy, heavy hangs over my poor head !' * said the girl, between a smile and a sigh^as she quoted the line from a nursery play. ''Hnsh, Miss Palma! Don't you cry I Your sweetheart Trill come bye'n bye I When he oomeB he'll coine in bine, To let yon know his love is true ; ' Or if he don't, he'll come in gray, To say he'll aa&rry; you to-day sang Mrs. PoleJ in a very sweet soprano voice. ' You see, lovey, I can quote po'try as well as you J Kbw no more nonsense, honey, or else I'll give you a dose of chloral as will quiet you down to- night, but make you look as white as a ghost to-morrow morning. It always does, devil fetch it for a deceiving drug. Now, will you be good or not ?' . . ' I will be good and obedient, Poly. One ought to be on sacred, holy Easter Eve, you know.' „ . ? ? ? * Surely/ responded Mrs. Pole, and she went and turned up the light, then closed the shutters. ' Shutting out the beautiful starlit sky and pine-crowned hills,' said Paima. ' Well, darling, you can't git star-gazing at the window all night, if you don't want to look like a stewed witch in the morn ing/ * I know, Poly. But it seems such a, pity to shut out the beautiful scene ! I could sit and look at it all night, if I were- not such a poor, -freak creature !' : Mrs. Pole brought a jug of milk punch from the pall of ice water in which it had been kept, and then a box: of sago biscuits, and placed them on the table. Then she drew the easy chair, with Palma in it, up to the board. ' Pbley, here is but one plate arid one glass ; where are the others ?' inquired the girl. ; ' My dear, the punch and the biscuits are for you, and you will not require more than one plate and one glass? *P*)ly \ You are a hqrriblB old humling, and I won't touch bite or «ap ianle^ ?y;oii join 'me, -and '*' drink iair,' . tbo,-^' dnik fair, whatever you do,'as Sairy Gan^i says' 'Who's Sairy Gamp, my child?' ? * Oh, an old friend of mine.' ? '-Wfell, I don't think much of her, honey,' if Bhe's fond of drink. Besides/ there ife rio iMngJiere for. me to drink' but of, aided Mrs. Pole, inconsequently. ' . ?? . . :' Yes, here's a goblet, Poly, that you may use.' ... ' ? ' , . . ? ' * And what'H you do. ?.' ' Bring me that tumbler from the wasSi stand. You may rinse it out as often as you please, and then I can drink my ;mUk punch out of it. I like a tumbler. , It is so old-fashioned and nice.' . *... : This was Palma's not insincere dearice to give the best service to her old friend. ; Mrs. Pole washed and wiped and rinsed the tooth- brush tumbler full iialf &-dozen times before she brought it to Palma. .
