UNSUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. Blessed are the unsuccessful ; the men who havo nobly striven and nobly failed. Ho alone is in evil case who has set his heart on false or solfish or trivial ends. Whether he secure them or not, ho is alike unsuccessful. But ho who loves liigh is kmg in his own right, though he ' live low.' His plans may be abortive, but himself is sure. God may overrule his desires and thwart his hopes and baffle his purposes, but all things shall work together for his good. Though he fall, ho shall rise again. Every defeat shall be a victory. Every calamity shall drop down blessing, inward disappointment shall minister to enduring joy. From tho grapes of sorrow he shall press tho wine of life. Oh, men and women everywhere who aro following on to know the Lord, faint yet persuing ; men and women who aro troubled, toiling, doubting, hoping,, watching, strugg ling, whose attainments ' through tho long greon days, worn bare of grass and sunshine,' lie hopelessly behind your aspirations ; who are haunted evermore by tho ghosts of your possibilities ; who see far off tho shining hills your feet are fain to tread ; who work your work with dumb assiduous energy, but with perpetual- protest, I bid you good luck in the name of the Lord.
