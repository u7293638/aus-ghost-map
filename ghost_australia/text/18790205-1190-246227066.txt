THANKSGIVING REFLECTIONS. Oh, yes, it s all very jolly, This giving of thanks, no doubt ; But what, if a chap's melancholy, Is he going to be thnnkful about ? iiuru am .1 in rue uppermost; ssory Of a boarding-houso, hashy anil drear (Perhaps, though, I ought to be thankful, That heaven and I are so near !) The skies are unpleasantly murky, 'lis the most unpropitious of days, Not the ghost of a possible turlcey Uprises before iny gaze ; I'd demolish the whole of a gobbler, Breast, drumstick and all, if I could (And yet I am told to ho thankful That my appetite's always so good) Tlio air in this room makes me shiver. The coal, like tho fire, is out ? I know 'twill unsettle my liver, And bring on a fever, 110 doubt. I've a cold and horrible headache, And pains 111 my joints through and through (I suppose, though, I ought to be thankful That I haven't the smallpox too!) Here are bills by the score, unreceipted, And duns of the dunningest' kind, And there is an ode I completed On " Thanks " — which with thanks was de clined ; And my landlndy— (-yes, I am thankful, In spite of my trials and cares, That she yesterday fractured her knee-pan, While climbing that fourth flight of stairs !) No longer love's fires may warm me, F or Rebecca— that maiden of grace — Sho wrote me a note to inform me Another had taken my place. O frailty, thy namo is Rebecca ! 'Twas thus in my anguish I cried (Yet really I ought to do thankful, F or tho fellow sho married has died !) So, I ask, how's a chap to he jolly, Or thankful for what he lias not ! Can he hope to escape melancholy If he's doomed to so dismal a lot ? The day seems to me but a mockery, Its spirit's a thing of the past, And— what did you say? — will I have somo- thing? — On my honor, I'm thankful at last !
