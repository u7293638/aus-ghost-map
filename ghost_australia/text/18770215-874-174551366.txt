APOSTOLIC DESCENT. BY THE GHOST OF ROBERT BURNS. WE'RE busy at it, night aud day, Scarce time to drink—nae time to pray, Wi' squatters on the bilking lay, And Free selectors; Then we maun meet without delay Enraged electors. There's thistles, scab, and boarding-oot, The truant question, rot, and fluke, And noo comes up the new dispute— 'Bout Bishop Moorhouse, Whether his descent be sans dispute, Or merely spurious. To apostolic pedigrees, To be custodian o' the keys, Of heaven's will to be trustees, We've had pretenders— And kings in bluid up to the knees, Ca'd Faith's Defenders. We have had Popes and ae Popess Upon whose gender some lay stress, But wha was like the Royal Bess, Or our dear Queen ? Whilst Royal Males were in a mess Frae morn till e'en. My lord, we dinna fash our thumb, Frae whom nor yet frae whence ye come ; The honey bee makes little hum, And far less buzz; He's only handsome and aplomb Wha handsome does. The puir man's frien' in word and deed, Digestion's a' the rich folk need, The foe of faction and of creed— The patriot's part; Play that, and I will say God speed Wi' a' my heart. Ye hadna lang among us been Till some sma/ zealotry was seen In that advice just touched wi' spleen, Your first and latest— " How'er ye differ frae Condemn a frien', the Papist." Newspaper chiels, wha nae folk ken, Are just run deevils wi' the pen, They'll tell ye mair of snakes and men Than maist Professors; They say that bishops are but men, Aft-times transgressors. They banged puir Perry unco sair, Wi' a' his colleges and lair; They made him think that auld Voltiare Was at his heel; He focht till he could Then fecht nae said mair, "FareweeL"
