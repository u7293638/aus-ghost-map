Stoddart put on three more singles and glanced Pierce for 2. He nest cut Pierce for a single, and had thus made 14 while the champion had been putting on 4. Stoddart was playing beautiful cricket, and a sweet cut for 4 elicited hearty-applause from the limited number of spectators. Grace cut Pierce, who, however, apparently troubled him a good deaL Stoddart drove Morgan for a single, giving inid-eff just a ghost of a chance, but the fieldsman just touched the ball with the tips of the fingers. Runs still mounted steadily, and then Grace snicked Morgan off the wicket, the wicket-keeper thinking that the champion had been bowled. He then drove Pierce for 4. At 35 Williams relieved Pierce, and the change proved effective, as Stoddart after glancing the new bowler for 2 attempted a drive, and was caught by Smith at mid-oft. 1—24—37. Eead was nest man, and Grace brought 40 to view by snicking Williams for 3. Eead opened with a single at the expense of Williams, and Grace scored 1 off the same bowler.

Lolimann joined Beid, who hit Williams splendidly for 4, and the newcomer fluked Morgan for 4. One eingle later Morgan clean bowled Eead, the ball fairly beating the batsman. 4—8—54. Badclifife joined Lohmann, who was 6oon afterwards badly missed off Morgan at mid-on. Morgan wa3 now sticking up both batsmen, fiadcliffe was then beautifully eang-ht by Patrick at short-leg. 5 — 0 — 57. An adjournment was then made for luncheon. On resuming after luncheon, Phillipson appeared »-»? Lohmann's partner. Lohmann drove Morgan for 2, and Phillipson hit Williams to leg for 4. He was however, clean bowled with the next ball. 6—4 — 63. Briggs joined Lohmann, and started by fluking Wil liams behind the wicket for 4, and 2 for byes were next recorded. Lohmann skied Morgan for a single, bringing 70 up. Briggs cat the same bowler for 4. Another over later Briggs tried to drive Morgan, but snicked him instead, and had the luck to get 4. Eighty ebon went up, and Briggs was evidently in a hitting humor, and after Williams had bowled a maiden Briggs hit Morgan to leg for 4. At 86 Pierce resumed at Williams's end and bowled a maiden Wills took up the bowling at the other end, and Briggs cut him for 4. The score continued to mount up, and a straight drive by Loh man off Wills dangerously close to Patrick went for 4, sending 103 up. Briggs was then smartly caught at the wickets by J. Austin. 7—23—103. Bean, who was lame, was next man, a-nd Peel went out to run for him. Lohmann drove Wills for 4. Bean opened with a single at the expense of Pierce, but he evidently knew but little about the ball. Lohmann hit Pierce to leg for a couplo, and at 110 Morgan resumed at Wills' s end, and Bean drove him for 1. Lohmann then hit the new bowler to leg for 4, and Bean made matters rough for Pierce in the next over, driving him for 4, and then hitting him to leg for 2 and 4. The latter, however, might have been a catch had not the fieldsman badly misjudged the hit. Buns now came qfuickly, end the fielding of the juniors was certainly not more than moderate. At 137 S. Austin relieved Pierce, and a few runs later J. Callaway went on at the other end. Bean was let off -when he had scored 17 at cover point, and althongh there was no occasson for it the Juniors presented the appearance of having entered a stage of demoralisation. With his - score at 18 Bean gave another chance, but the fieldsman again misjudged the hit and 2 were run,' and soon ISO went up. A few runs later an adjournment was made for refreshments. On resuming Bowden relieved Austin, and Bean cut the third ball for 4, M'Dowall at point showing con Eiderable dexterity in getting ouo of the way. Another single was made ' in the same over, and MoTgan bowled a maiden from the other end. Loh mann was then cleverly stumped by Austin off Bow den. 8—43 — 158. M'Gregor was next man, and started with a single. He made 1 more at Morgan's expense, and then Austin again distinguished himself by catching M'Gregor at the wickets off Eow den. 9—2—160. Attewell was next, but with only 2 more runs on Bean attempted to drive Morgan, and was well caught by Bell at mid-off. 10—31 — 162.

Bowden opened to Eadcliffe, who was miesed badly by Deane in the long - field off the second ball. The next ball was fatal to Attewell, who was caught at mid-on by Callaway. 1 — 0 — 1. M'Gregor was the nest man, and Morgan took up the bowling at the other end and sent down a maiden to Eadcliffe. M'Gregor opened with a single, and Williams for some reason unknown to the spectators was put on in the place of Morgan. Williams started with a maiden. Two byes were run m Bow den's next over. Eadcliffe added 2 to his score at the expense of Williams, and still another single. Through bad fielding two singles were scored on Bowden's next offer, and then Bowden bowled M'Gregor with i. leg. break. 2 — 3 — 11. Philipson was the iierfc batsman in, and drove Bowden for 4, and several singles were scored, _and 20 was posted. Ironsides relieved Bowden, and Eadcliffe hit hin% for 1.
