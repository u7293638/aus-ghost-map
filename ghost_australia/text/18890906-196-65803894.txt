AN IRATE POET. Nevor, since the days of Pope and Dennis, has anything quito '.so savage appeared in literaturo as Mir. Robert Browning 's little ode, "To Edward Fizcond,d" publishoed in' the last A-I't/uroa.. h lr. Aldis' Wright, in his "Lifo and Letters" of the translator of Omar Khasyyam, had most, incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the genial " Fitz," which ran:-"Mrs? Drowning'sa diath "'is rather a relief to' me,'I' must say: no more Aurora Leigls, thank God A. womsa ofl ral goni?s I know; but what" is the upshot 'of it all! Sheo and her sat' 'had bettor mind the 'kitcheon mid theo' children; 'an perhaps the poor, Except in such things' ns little novels,'" thoy only devote themselves to what men do' much better, leaving that which men doworso'dr not at all." 3Mr. rowning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky opasago--nover of course, meamont for tlhe public eye-and blazcd forth into the subjoined volanoio verses: Too EDwoeoim rFzr.noeo.

R-' O unonrU ows!?xa Tantcrnc'animis! Should a great poet thus, for a fretfnl phrase avenge the dead upon thb dead, by telling him who was the "beat fiend" of Lord Tennyston, and author, in ths wayof translation, of the "one thing done ivinely well," that lhis ghost is not good oough to spit at ? Mr. Aldis Wright has cr ainly much ? ?answor for.
