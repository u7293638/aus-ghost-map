To be identified by the ghost of the woman whose younger sister you have married is tolerably terrible ; to be shown by the sexton into the pew of the man whom you hare swindled is satisfactorily embarrassing; to roll a druuk, and then discover by the ghastly light of the mocu that you have de spoiled your father, is conductive of serious meditation; to catch cold in the nose by saving an ugly woman from drowning, and then have her swear she is yours, is calmly disgusting; but to-we had thought we could instance something that would make all these things appear insignificant annoyances by comparison, but that last affair rather gets us.
