TIiatMeeluniieH' Iusiitiiic TO THE EDITH!!. Sir,—I wish to inquire how much longer the long-suffering public of Menzies are going to put up with the slotlifulness of that, body known as the committee of the Mechanics' Institute. Some few months ago a few letters to you on the subject of a new building woke the sleeping committee to a sense of its duty, namely, to provide a more suitable edifice to meet the requirements of this advancing town. Much against, their will they bestirred themselves, and at last had a block of land granted them by the Gevsrmucnt for the purpose, then tenders were, called and one accepted, but unfortunately shortly after the block proved to be on a portion of the railway reserve, which of course was not evailable. Now why did not the committee have this matter rectified at once so that the new building could lmv* been erected as early as possible. They have no reasonable excuse, to offer, as sine* that time not one, but many, of our important and influential citizens have been down to Perth on business matters connected with the welfare of Menzies, and why they have never been asked to assist, as I feel sure they would have only been too happy to hayc the opportunity, is for the reason that si(ch an effor might have resulted in an apoplectic strnke. Then they had this danger saved them by the visit of the Minister for Mines, who was interviewed for the benefit of the town iu general, and generally with most, successful results. All I have to say now is that it is a shame to have no place to meet friends and enjoy a quiet read, or have a quiet social game, say, chess, draughts, &c.;, and that the Rip Van Winkle committee ought to give up the ghost and let some one with energy conduct the business. And I may ask what sort of positjon does if, place thp contractor in who is in doubt as to what the committees intentions are ? how much inconvenience has he bean c-uused by such doubt ?—I remain, Sc., A MEMDER THAT TRUSTED IN HIB COMMITTEE.
