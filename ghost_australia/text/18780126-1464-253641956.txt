BOOKS RECEIVED. London Society. — Certainly one of the most readable periodicals of the day is London Society — the Christmas number of which, just re ceived from Messrs. Robertson and Co. , Pitt-street, abounds in interesting and well-written articles and highly-finished en gravings. A Coachful of Ghosts, The Soldier's Story, and Old Christmas Days may be specially mentioned as being excellent literary productions. The Melbourne Revieio. — The January number of this capitally con ducted journal is just to hand, and contains several articles of great interest, written in a masterly manner. Among the con tributors are Sir G. Gavan Duffy, Messrs. Wollaston and Fitz- gibbon, while Professor Strong gives English and Latin versions of a charming polyglot love song, by the Hungarian poet, Petofi. Mr. G. Robertson, of Melbourne, must be complimented upon the excellent manner in which The Melbourne Review is brought out. The Vagabond Annual, published by Messrs. Turner and Henderson, is a collection of literary contributions from writers in Sydney, Melbourne, and Queensland — of these " Tasma" carries off the palm for the very cleverly constructed story "Malus Oculus. " Mr. Brunton Stephens contributes a clever comic piece of versi fication, entitled " Non-suited." Mr. Harold Stephen gives a very well written fairy tale. With the exception of a sketch by Mr. R. Thatcher and a yarn by Mr. T. Moser, the annual does not display any great amount of literary ability. Bradshaio,s Almanac. — This little book contains any amount of infor mation — and no office or private house should be without a copy. Sydney Illustrated News A Imanac. — -Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, & Co. have issued their usual Weather Almanac for 1878, containing Probable Weather Daily, Mail Tables, Traveller's Road Guide, and much valuable information.
