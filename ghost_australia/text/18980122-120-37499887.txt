SHOULD WE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS P It is difficult to determine whether the 'ought* of your query implies an ethical or a scientific obligation : and I am afraid the ono as little admits of a final answer as the other. The present writer remembers a lady interpolating in the midst of a discussion on the snbjeot of ghosts the following highly original objection :-4 Oh ! but the Bible says there may'nt bo ghosts !' This, of course, waa beside tho mark, even though the lady was prepared to quote chapter and verse-which I doubt. Ard some one, I remember, immediately hoisted her on her own petard with tho citation of the Witch of Endor evoking tho spirit of Samuel from the bowels of tho earth. There seems nothing in the existonco of ghosts actually at variance with onrrent religious notions. To ooncedo thoir existence is to poBtnlato im- mortality or, at any rate, a period of life of some sort after death. Though, on the other hand, it is possible to hold with the Bishop of St. Asaph in his opinion that ' such means were unworthy of tho Deity to employ*-* such moans ' roforiing to the referring to tho childish, oaprioious, aimlepi and knavish tricks which oharaotoriso tho reoorded aotions of tho majority of ghosts, proving thom to bo possessed of a far lower intelligence than our own. Tho claims o* Soionoo are no loss diflloult to doteimino. If wo accept unconditionally tho onoimbus accumulation of evidence and observation, we are bound to boliovo that ghosts exist. On *,ho othor hand, nono of our senses is infallible : things aro not alwuys what they BeeTn : and thero is a vast difforenoo botwoen untraiuod observation and tho soiontifio observation of phonomona (though it is generally impossiblo to analyso tho char- acter of ordinary observation with any approaoh to finality).
