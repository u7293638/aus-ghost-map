' A FUNNY CASE OP CONSCIF.XCB.-Tho following most amusing story was recently told, tile editor of tbe'Boston Post, hy a wog of a doctor belong- ing to Franklin county, Vt., who stated that the caso of conscience really occurred in his own {«.notice, some years ago. Tho story runs as fol ows :-" The wife of a Baptist deacon, (whom, for tho ' purpose of tho . auccdoto, wo shall call Mr. Cushman,) dislocated her arm by a fall, and the doctor was sent for, and came, ;with - nil . con- venientdespatch, and put tho matter '' to rights." Presently after thc operation wns over;' tho * lolly was seized with a faint turn, and beckoned to lier husband for assistance. The deacon wns'u man of slow motion, slow of speech, and ratlior 'slow in point of intellect. He was n strict 'temper- ance man,' and conscientious in this and every- - thing else to tho last degree Being never quito sure that he was 'right,'ho naturally feared to' ' go-ahead.' ' In tho present . emergency, ho went into 1 tho room ' ? where tho doctor was ' sitting, and addressed him in a slow and measured tono 'ns follows : 'Doctor B.i you aro; doubtless,'aware,\of tlie. principios which Mrs. Cushman and ¡mysélf pro- fess in regard to the uso of intoxicating'drinks in any form whatever. Now, Doctor, I wish to put it to your conscience ns a Christian physician, whether it would bo in any manner culpable in caso ¡Mrs. Cushman was afflicted with faintness, if I should so far deviate 'from our habitual rule as to hoUl a lottie of camphor tb $trs'. Cushman's nose /' Tho doctor rushed into tho lady's apart- ment and found his patient bad not waited thc issue of tho deacon's casuistry; but had fairly ' gone oiP in a fainting fit. ' The devil take your conscience 1' said the doctor, half angry and bait' inclined 'to off himself in a fit of laughter. ' Tire devil take your doubts, sir-in a case Uko this, one scruplo of camphor is worth' twenty scruples of conscience.'.
