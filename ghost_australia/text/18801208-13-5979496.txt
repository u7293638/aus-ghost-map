consideied in committee yesterday Thot.0. lines to winch no objection was taken were passed, ind may now bo consideied, to all intents and pu poseí, duly authorised A considerable number, however, were postponed for fuithei consideration, and on somo of these it is the intention of bon mem beis to take evidence Iho piopo.ed railways which did not meet with immediate acceptance were the follow ing -Inglewood to Charlton, llorung to Boort, Elmoic to Reran" Shepparton to Numurkal, Benalla to '.an aw miga, Horsham to Dimboola Branxholme to Casterton, and lach mond to Alphington Witnesses weio called in connexion with the Branx holme and Casterton lint, and some little progiess was made, but if the pro cess of examination should not progress more quickly in futuro than it did la t night, it u ill be some time before it is completed As our readers aro aware, the Government proposes to construct a line fioin Branxholme to Casterton, thus putting the district of which Casteiton is the centre mto easy communication with Poitland, without greatly increasing the distance to bo traversed by tiavellers between Gas terton and Hamilton As soon as it became known that Branxholme waa to be the starting point, the Hamilton people were up in arms agamst the slight offered to the great western town ship They contended that the proper route was fiom Hamilton via Coleraine to Casterton But tins would involve the construction of some 10 or 11 miles of unnecessary railway, cont- ing say £15,000 The gieat argu ment, however, against beginning at Hamilton is the extra dis tance which it would add to tho journey from Casterton to Forthnd It appears that nearly all the heavy traffic from the extieme West goes to the latter town for transmission by water to Melbourne or elsewhere Now, the difference m the journey between Casterton and Portland, tú Branxholme and Hamilton respectively, is 27 miles in favour of the formor route This is a very grave consider ation m the carriage of goods But while the difference of distance in reaching the seaboard is as stated, the journey from Casteiton to Melbourne by rail is only lengthened to the extent of some four miles by being brought round by Branxholme Under the circumstances, then, if Casterton is to be the temporary terminus, there cannot be a doubt that Bianxboluio should be the starting point It seems, however, to have stiuck the people of Hamilton that their case was so bad, in respect to communication with Casterton, nu Coleraine, that they had better throw over the foi mer town ship, and content themselves with a line to the latter Mr MOIT, who gave evidence yesterday in favour of making the branch from Hamilton, ad\ ocated the adoption of this schema veij strenuouslj, but we do not think his arguments ire very convincing Ho contended that some day or other the bl ick line-Geelong to Colac ind Cim peidown-would bo carried on to Hamilton, and that in extension of it from that place to the boidei would form the proper intercolonial i uhay tow aids the west In answer to this, howevei, it is sufficient to sij that a junction with the South Aus traban lines can best be eflected from Dimboola, but that even if tho southern route was 1 necessity, the "black line' might just as well bo earned to Branxholme as to Hamilton Then, again, this witness said that a line from Hamilton to Colórame would run through country fully occupied, and accommodate a large area to the north, while the line from Branxholme to Cas terton would skut i compaiativo debert This assertion, how ever, does not appear to be borne out by the railwaj maps cir culated bj the Government Not only is the Branxholme line shown thereon as ninning foi its whole length thiough settled countij, but also is having evten sivc selections on its western side If the land m that direction is the desert de senbed, it seems strange that people who have to earn their living bj agri culture should hive til en up so much Besides, it must le remembered that thi° line is not intended particularly for the accommodation of the w sol and wheat growers in the valleys of the Wannon and the Glenelg, whose interests Mr MOTT advocated last night It may bo that at some future day they will have a good claim to a line on their own account But at present the object is to leach the settlers towards the bolder, in order that their business connexions may be with ?onie "\ ictorian centro, and not with Kingston or Bivoli Bay Mr MOT i ._ asseition that more goods go bj rail from Hamilton eastward than go south to Portland, appears to us to be altogether beside the question Those ow ners of produce who now find it more profitable, in some way or other, to use the railw iy, can continue to do so, but that is no reason why their neighbours to the westward, who at pieseut pitronise the water route, should not have increased facilities foi reaching a port A great dell was mado of the fact that passengers for the most pait travel by rail rather than patronise the steamboats M doubt they will continue to do BO, owing to the fact that they can always maka certain of conveyance by train, while the steamers only run at intervals But so fai as the people of Casterton are concerned, the Branxholme íoute would only lengthen their journey by four miles, aa compared with that via Cola raine, and this is the merest trifle in a ¿Lstaîiceof over two hundred miles There is one moro argument used by Mr MOTT which wo must notice, beciuse we think it indicates a complete misapprehension of the duty which rests upon the Go vernment in railway matters The lino to Lianxholme was described as a "bud or ' and notas a- "feeder"-that is to »ay» tuat "'stead of directing goods along tho Government lines towards Mell ourne or elsewhere, it would have a tendency to draw them towards Port land where, after conveyance over a coral ai atively fen miles of railway, thoy would be lost to the department Now, tho Government did not undertake to constmct railways in order to make all the possible profit out of them as a joint stoci company would do, but for the purpose of developing the resources of tbc country and promoting tho general interest It is evident, howovei, that tbo general interest is not served if artificial means arc takentofoicetriders to use an expensive method of convej ince uhen a cheaper ono is available The community, is a whole, is so much the l oorerby the waste, and it is for the communty as a whole that a good Go uniment-unlike a joint stock company «-must be concerned W e see nothing iu Mr Moir b evidence to shake our con fidence in the sup nor incuts of the Government scheme The investigation of the painful case of the lateA\ML "MARTIN, an inmate of the Melbourne Hospital, who died on I riday e\ erang from the eflccts of some =eure burns she received three weeks ü{,o, Ins served to show the existence of defects in the mana0ement of that insti tion, for which it ought not to be difficult to pio\ ide a satisfactory remedj It ap pears that the woman was admitted into the building on the loth ult, and was siiffuing at the time not merely from the dangerous accident she had sustained but fiom delirium and pneumonia Her wounds were dressed by Dr Nr\vu\A, one i f the resident suigeons, but although the t) mptonis w ero \ ery serious from the first, the case was not reported to the honoiaiy officer until five clays after waid« On the 20th, the bums were a^ain attended to, and on tho 23rd Dr tiLWMVN ordered her removal to the re fnctory ward because her delirious ravines were a causo of disturbance to the other patients This Older, hov>e\er, was not carried into ellect, owing to the intervention of tho matron, who made such representations to the secretary as caí sed lum to countermand the direc tions given by the medical man At this stjgo of the proceedings the unfor tunte woman complained to one of the nurses of a creeping sensation, and asserted that something was biting her The nurse removed the dressing from one hand, and found that maggots had been engendered in tho soi es, aud the matron made a similar dis co\eiy with respect to the other hand Luder these circumstances Mrs M 1V.IL caused the wounds to be re dressed, and her interference in the matter was reported to the committee, and complained of by Dr NEW M VN Thereupon a communication was ad dressed by the societary to the "\ îsiting Committee, which inquued into the «dole affair, and the members of that body deprecated the action of the house surgeon, and expressed their opinion that the matron was deserving of thanks for the responsibility she had assumed 'lhere can bo very little doubt that Airs M IVIL was actuated by motives of humanity in doing w hat she did for the suflenng woman, and in all piobabihty her action neitherretardednor acceleiated the fatal result of the accident, but it must be equally apparent that the interven tion of non proies íonal persons in cases of this kind is a very objectionable, and is liable to prove a highly dangerous, pro cecdmg 1 he removal of dressings and the exposure of ulcerated ilesh to tho air, cs\ emily in buildings where the atmo3 pliero is sure to bo moro or les" con {animated with poisonous matter thrown off from the lungs or skins of sick 1 ersons, should only be done by direc tion and under the instructions of the medical attendants of the patient, and to that extent tho matron is not free from blame, notwithstanding her humano intentions But in so far as the non remov al of the sufferer to the refractory ward is concerned, it does appear to us lo bo highly improper that theie should be no one but the secietury to appeal to His duties and íesponsibi lities aro of an entirely different kind, and tho case under discussion only ben es to corroborate what we have lepeatedly insisted upon, namely, that theie should be, as senior resident sur £,eon at the Hospital, a professional man of high standing and long expeuence, to «horn reference could be made in such an emergency as the abovo, and whose decisions would be authoritative m all cases of doubt and difficulty As it is, any young man who may happen to be the senior resident sur geon is the nominal head of the est ibhshment as regards matters of professional administration, an au ange went which x\oiks most unsatisfac tonl\ A public

and m J alala of these districts, who derived so much benefit from free access to the gardens from which they are now oxcli ded, having no other reserve within easy distance to resort to ïhoro can be no doubt that the detormi nation of tho commissioners to exclude M'o public norn tho wholo aroa, of the wardens took poople in the neighbour hood by surprise, and waa im Mediately regarded as a grievance For oui own part, wo novor could seo tho necessity for tho stop takon Granting that it is essential to keep the grounds in tho immediate vicinity of tho exhibition building froo from unautho Used intrusion, this might be easily dono without that completo exclusion which is tho rule at present Any ono who is v\ell acquainted with the way in which tho gardens are laid out is aware that in front of tho bunding there are two path Ways sopaiated by broad flower beds, | running parallol to oach other from Nicholson street to Rathdowno street, and connecting Gortrudo street with Queensberry street Now, if a fonce w ere to bo erected on the south sido of the flower beds, the Exhibition building and a sufficient space m front of it would bo isolated from tho- general traffic, and tho public would bo able to use that portion of the gardons which lies between the moat southerly pathway and Victona parado without mconvemonce to tho commissioners At the north end the ground is occupied by certain open air exhibits, so that no concession could bo well made there, but the southern portion of the ¿aidons which wo have described is not in any way devoted to Lxhibiticn purposes,

increased to one . twentieth of its entire length, instead of one tenth as proposed in the clause was rejected by 20 to four v otes A much more formidable opposi- tion, however, was manifested towards clause 10, which provides that the Railway depart ment need not construct fences, aud ulti mately Mr Reid agreed to its postponement Clause 11, 'Prospective fires not to be com pensated for, was likewise postponed The committee began to take evidence about the postponed lines, beginning with that from Branxholme to Casterton 'Ino witnesses in favour of the competing route from Hamil ton to Coleraine were examined, and pro gress was then reported The House ad- journed until 3 o clock this afternoon, when the bill will be proceeded with Mr Reid made an earnest appeal to his fellow members of tho Council yesterday to refrain from asking bim to explain the pro visions of bills entrusted to his charge Ile says it is ridiculous to ask him for such explanations lion members ought to study for themselves measures before the Llouse, and if they cannot understand the bills they ought not to expect him to do so This appeal hiBhly amused the House Hie I stimates were taken m the Assembj after the dinner hour, and a long and warm discussion took place on the police depart ment, with tho result of a farther breach between the Ministry and certain of their supporters Great exception was taken by certain Corner memberB and others to a proposal to reduce the allowances of Super intendeiit Vi inch and Inspector Secretan by £ 0 per annum, which reductions were con demned as paltry and mean, and involving an unjust rellection upon two ofiicers who are, it was Baid, at any rate e jual to their now reduced fellows Mr Berrj ultimately put his foot 'down He complained bitterly of the criticisms of the Corner members, and declared that he will give way no more, but will stand or fall by the votes on the 1 stimates Mr L L Smith poked fun at the Chief Secretary, and said that his "tantrum showed that he had a bad cause and he declared that there is something suspicious in the Bupport the Ministry is receiving from the direct Opposition Sir Bryan O Loghlen was more serious If

would rather go into opposition on the morrowthan put up vv ith the ínsultB and tho humiliation the mem- ber for West Bourke seeks to heap upon them. The "plague spot," says Mr. Richard- son, is that the Ministry has a certain Attorney General Sir Bryan was again on his legs " trembling with passion, according to Mr. Richardson, and said that he could trace tho source of this imputation In Eng land thero IB an officer who IB known as the Attornej General s devil, and hero there is a Minister who is familiarly called " the At tornej Generals dog Tho lion gentleman expressed his belief that what is going on in the House means a reconstruction of the Ministry in the recess and a coalition with the Opposition, and then the radical party will wake up and find itself sold After an acrimonious discussion Mr Berry made the suggestion that the opinion of the House on the two decreases should be taken on the re- port of tho itemB to tho House, and this arrangement waB effected, and the police vote was agreed to Bhortly before 12 The com- mittee went on with other votes, and the House rose at 10 minutes past 2 o clock On tho vote for the police being taken in the Assembly yesterday, Mr. Ramsay brought under notice the claims of Mr. Superintendent Hare, to whose energy and address he attri- butes the destruction of the Kelly gang. Mr Ramsay put a minute on the papers when he left office, stating his intention of reward- ing Mr. Hare with the next promotion which might occur, and he insists that the force and the public would both be benefited were the command given to that gentleman. In reply Mr. Barry deprecated discussion about the claims of this officer or that, pend- ing the appointment of the royal commis- sion which he has promised to inquire into the management of the force. Mr. Nicolson, he says, only holds an acting appointment, and after the inquiry he will be free to take what course he likes. Mr. Berry asks for a little time before appointing the commission, as he desires to select men whose decision will be received with respect by the country. During the pohco discussion in the Assembly last night, Wr Wrixon called atten tion to the circumstance that very serious charges aro frequently preferred by constables on vers înaufficientgroundB In Portland three persons, were recently arrested for murder, they were kept in custody a month, and it waa then discovered that there waa no evi dence against them At Hamilton it np peared said Mr Wrixon, something of the sort had occurred within tho last few days Two ladies connected with the theatrical profession were placed in a dock on a charge that waa sufficient to kill them, and which was Bure to leave a stigma behind Yet thero was no evidence, and the constable who laid the information admitted that he did not believe in the guilt of one of the women when he apprehended her Mr Wrixon ex pressed the opinion that before informations of this Benous character are laid either the Crown law officers or the officer in responsible charge of the district should be consulted Mr Longmore despite the protests of the Government against the waste of time, sub mittod yesterday his motion that the two members for Rodney are unlawfully elected as an amendment on the motion that tho House go into committee of supply The member for Kipon quoted a multi tudc of precedents to show that returning officers have nothing to do but to conduct the election, and he insinuated also that in this instance the officer received orders from the Service Government to omit the name of Mr Crowie and seat Messrs Gillies and I raser without a contest This allegation was specifically denied by both Mr Kerferd and Mr Ramsay who declared that the returning officer waa never many way interfered with The Chief Secretary urged the House not to interfere at the pre Bent juncture more especially a3 the petition picsentcd by Mr Crowie had been withdrawn and Sir Brjan O Loghlen declared that this was the "jellyfish policy now in favour vv lth the Ministry and which makes him ask himBelf whether the liberal party has Minis tera and whether the House baa leaders The lion member submitted an amendment to refer the validity of the election to the Elections and Qualifications Com millee and a lengthy discussion took place on this proposal Mr Longmore s amendment waa first put and it was negatived bj 1; votes to G and this disposed of the matter The nouae by its voto de cided to go into

discussion m the Assembly jesterdaj A question was put by Mr Hall asking the Minister if he ia aware if Mr Ljron Moore is interfering in the business of the Lands department, and Mr. Richardson re- plied that he had heard complaints about Mr Moore, but there was no evidence on the subject Mr Service took exception to the terms of the question which originally alluded to Mr Moore as ' a dismissed civil servant, and this eeemed to cast some reflection upon him whereas Mr Moore who left on Flack Wednesday, IB in receipt 01 a special pension, on account of his services to the state The moral was pointed bj Mr Levien, who contended that the agents who ought to be excluded from the departments on the ground of improper interference are the members of Parliament who practise there and who bnn0 political influence to bear on the officers Mr M Kean rose in the Assembly yester da) to deny that he had ever said, as re ported, that he was in charge of a department in i firm which employed 2J0 000 hands lion members, however, would not take the denial, as most of them heard tho statement, and thej met the hon member with positive contradictions Mr M'Kean then attempted an explanation, the effect of which was that the men were not employed in a factory but I w ere weavers and others who took work from the firm and did it at their homes However, he adhered stoutly to the quarter of a
