At lesst as many selected words are to be used as onehalf of the number of lines in the verses in which they are embodied. The selected words were Gate, Gentle, Ghost, Glitter, Grain, Grave. The following are all that remain for publication :— Though gold may glitter, yet at most What is it but the soulless ghost Of earthly wealth and power ? We seize it; then we let it slip ; We hold it with tenacious grip- It may be for an hour. But like the finest grains of sand, In gentle streams it leaves the hand That would retain it still; Till finally we reach the gate, Where all our strivings terminate, The grave of every ill. CLERICCS. One summer's eve reclining lay within a shady dell, A youth, whose thoughts reverted to the spot he loved so well; Though all around was lonely, and as silent as the grave; No gkost nor phantom did he fear, for he was youn; and brave. Long, long he lay, and pondered over scenes now passed away, When gaily o'er the mountain's side he roamed from day to day; Or through the fields of waving corn then ripening into grain; „ . K'/A Or where the hedgerows glitter when refreshed by falling rain. Such were the loving scenes the youth depicted there and then, ,, -«?" Till there fell upon his startled ear the chimuiL hour of ten; ' Which suddenly recalled that peaceful parting at the gate With her, who in a gentle voice said," Darling, it is late." SYLVIA. Where the rustic gate stands open, Gentle Nellie, fair and sweet. From the porch iose-wreathed is tripping Her young lover soon to meet. Ne'er a ghost of boding sorrow Casts its shadow o'er the soene, But the harvest moon its glitter Spreads both peaceful and serene. See the ripening grain is bending Like the ocean's heaving wave ; Little recks she of disaster. Making for her hopes a grave. JESSAMINE. A FACT. The story of the ghost I tell. Is one that I remember well, Though years since then have passed away. One gentle morn when all was clear, A ghostly phantom made me fear And tremble, yea, look grave and pray. 'Twas not the glitter of a light, Oft seen among the grain at night At autumn, through yon garden gate; But dressed like one my neighbours knew, Whose charms they said were not a few; Such was the vision I relate. _ B. S. S. "B. S. S." states that the incident to which I10 refers happened about twentv- tive years ago. _ He was then living in Buckingham County Virginia! U.S. His sister and himself had spent the Sunday at the house of Widow H., and on" returning home through the back woods they lost their way. It was a bright summer morning, but they continued wandering round in a circle, and returning to a rude log hut in a field about thirty yards from the beaten oath. Here be saw, as he supposed, a pleasant - looting old lady sitting under the verandah in an old - fashioned, high - back hickory, or white pine chiir. She was dressed in blue, and wore a pink sunbonnet an J pink apron. On again returning to the same spot they determined to have a chat with the old lady and enquire their way, but to their surprise they found the house untenanted. On his relating the circumstance a few days afterwards to some feinile acquaintance "they changged countenance, and said 'that must be McG.'s spirit, as she used to sit there often, and was dressed like that when alive!'" B.S.S. adds—"I never knew Mrs. G. when alive, and never saw the same when passing near; so the mind could not have pictured it." We now invite for publication Conglomerations embodying the following words :—Habitation, Hail, Head, High, Hold, Hope. The verses to be written in compliance with the conditions given above.
