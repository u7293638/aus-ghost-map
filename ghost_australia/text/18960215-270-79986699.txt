STRAHAN. [raOM OUR OWN GOBBESPOKDEHt.1 Friday. The Ada Delroy Company played here last evening in Pontifex's Hall, and although tbe price of admission was high for Straban they were greeted with a good house, their fame having preceded them. MisB Delrov in her Oohni-rln. Gapello dance proved herself an artiste of the first water, as she did also in her skipping rope dance. Tbe duet upon the bells by Miss Delroy and Mr Bell was very pretty and a novelty. Mr Bell pleased the audience with his comicalities, and Miss Etta Stanbridge and Mr Lindsay rendered their respective items well. Madam Bell sent (hem all away mystified, and wondering how she could see into their thoughts and tell them about their lost. relations or friends asked for, and ' Your Own ' quite expected to see the ghost of his grandmother or mother-in-law waiting for him upon his arrival at home. The steam ketch Moonah arrived here this morning with a lode of sleepers {or tbe Dundas trams, and I hear (here are more to foils*.
