! Wedlcal and Scientific. The Quarterly Jourunal of Inebriety re marks that: "The man who, while pois oned by alcohol, commits crime; should be the subject of scientific inquiry." That may be, but we should also suggest that he be kept away from alcohol, or that alcohol be kept away from him. The same periodical, rjferring to the action of alcohol, aflirms that: "It is one of the curious errors that alcohol stimulates the imaginatiou, and gives a clearer, more practical insight into the relation of events of life. The whirl of thought, roused up by the increased cir culation of the blood in the brain, is not imagination: it is not a superior insight or conception of the relation of events, but is a rapid production of previous thoughts. soon merging into confusion. The in ebriate never creates anty new ideas or new views; all his fancies are tumultuous, blurred, and barren. The apparent bril. liancy is only the flash .f mania, quickly followed by dementia." Great indeed is the alcohllic delusion Among delusions the alcoholic is one of the most harmful. Dr. Norman Kerr says: " All alcohols are poisonous. The least poisonous are the alcohols of wine. More poisonous are the alcohols of beet root. Still more deadly are the alcohols of corn (all kinds of grain); and the most potent and pestiferous are the alcohols from potatoes. Cider inebriates are usa a ly more heavy and stupid than alert and offensive. Amylec alcohol is nearly four times as poisonous as othylio." It is better to let the poison in either form alone. Go up to your fears and speak to them, and as ghosts are said to do, they will generally fade away.
