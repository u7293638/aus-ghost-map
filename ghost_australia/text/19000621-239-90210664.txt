The moon will be it) in fii ho11r. Wo will sail when there's light e tough, if lyoul please." The herculean s'avago gave a grunt pecuiliar to the Maori race, lit his cigar, and left the hut. The other sat and smoked i:: silence for somne tiliue, until his thoughts found vent in audible miutterings. - "Egad! this is goin, t(he ticket, and no mistake," he, cried, taking the cigur frot his lips, and apostrophising the curling nsokh abovo his head. " Here am I, Timothy Sharpe, alias the Ferret, and tVallet de-Sihail to his greatness Mr. Hilton Fernbrook, Lord of thle Barrier Rock; here am I, ambassador, courier, 1me0i senger, forerunner, and.what not, to .horald tie approach of-.l y .boss--nins: ter, I nmean-to this his home, after an absence of live yeairs spent in England. and on the continent of Europe, ia! ha! ha! it's rnro fun to be it gentle lian, and to do the grand tour, as hll boss and I have done it for these years past. lla! hii " And the idea so tickled the risible muscles of the littlo man that he rolled over the bunk in a fit of uncontrollable, merriment. "Well, well. I've done my mnission here satisfactorily, at any rate," le said, when he had somlewhat recovered him self. "One trump card played, which will go far to win tho game, if pro perly followed up. Now, let ume glance onc more over my instructions to make sure I have missed nothing." "First, to give Bosco, the Maori, a half-dozen lines scribbled in some out landish fashion that old Nick himself could not read it. Tho savage read it though, and deuced glad and pleased he sceneed after it, placed himself at once entirely at my disposal, and lhe put the lmissive away ini his dirty blan ket as if it had been the Kohinoor. Second, received at the house when I got there-and devilish tired I felt too \--scraping my shins against the sharp, steep rocks, received at the house with open arms, and especially by that tall, dark old sho cat, Rita, the house keeper. What an eye she has, and what long claws for scratching. Humph! Ferret, you rascal, beware of that Maori devil in. petticoats. How lher withered face lighted up when 1 told her that Muster Hilton was eom ing home. Ah, well! if the place does not suit you, Tiimothy Sharpe, you can givo notice. iHa! haln ha! Lastly, 1 na not to dolay my return. Very well, Master Hilton Fernbrook. Tihe wind is fair for our sixty-mile journey, and :'m glad it is so, for an open fishing boat is not the most safe and comfortable coln veyance on the coast of New Zealand on a dark night, and with a chopping oea on. Entre non, Ferret, if tho wind holds, the master of Fornbrook shall see the face of his humble ser vant before to-morrow's dawn." " Who's there'?" Thlie harsh voice croaked out the latter exclamation fiercely, and at the same instant a re volver lwas pulled forth from the breast of his buttoned-up coat. iBall! only Bosco, returning," he cried, after an intense pause. " This infernal den of peaks and chasiis would unnerve the devil himself." lie had only time to replace tile weapon in his coat when the Maori re-entered the whlare. " Well, the boat ready?" " Yes." "(Cole, then, lead the way, osco," cried the other, rising and lighting a freshl cigar. " My lmaster gave mo positive orders too e back again at Pukehina. by toimorrow morning." The( old Maori took his gun, and lifter securing the door of his whnaro, led the way down tho ridge of the ravine in silence. It was a perilous path even to those who were acquiain itd with its intricate windings; but HBsco, who, old as lie was, had been born and reared in its vicinity, guided his companion safely to the w?estern ledge overlooking thlo sea. In a ismall, circular shaped inllot, completely hid by the high, overhang ing cliffs above it, a goodly-sizod yawl was seen rising and falling with thi motion of the wiveis. The iFerret and his companion em barked. After they hiad cleared theo covo a large lug sail was hioited, which, catching the bre'eze, sent the boat along at thlo rate of six or seven knots an hour. The Maori held the Ielim, and steered for a proiiiontory opplosite tlioe Barrier, but far away in the distance, and on which a tiny speck of light shont; over the dark waters. For over an hour there was a dead sileuce Ihetween these men; thui the Maori spoke. "Is the master inot well that lie hias sent you to report his arrival ? Why id lihe stay at Pukclhinn ?" "Ah, that's it, Bo~sco," replied Siarpe, oevasively "'iMastors do not al ways consult their servants as to whlat they intend to tdo. They order, and we obey. You will have ani opportunity of asking the boss that samne lquestion two or three hours hence; perhaps he u11i'y alinswer you in a more satisfactory llmannller than I canll. On reoson, no dloubt, is that lie has not been very well. The voyage was as rough one, and Mastor Hilton is a bad sailor." The Maori gave an unmistaklahl, grunt of dissent. "T'lhe young eaglet always loved the sea," lihe said, in his (quiet tone. "Many a time lhas he tenimpted io forth with bribes of to acco whlien the winds roared, and tihe wraters wcro white witli foam. Hilton Fernbrobk hath changed, indeed, if the rocking of a great ship taketh away his health and strength." "Bosco, you are a Muaori, and there fore cannot understanmd the changes whlic may come to one by travelling. lihe master of "Fernbrook has been ab sent live years." "Tut! twenty-five years cannot change meni's likes amnd dislikes," re plied Bosco. '"Argued like a Maori," cried the I'erret, laughiing his discordant laugh; "the boss is not changed a bit;, spite of all the quoor things he has seen. -Ho lovsc old Ilita and Bosco, and hears in his regards all tle old domes tics who served his father before huin." ''"Ah! Bosco loves the boy," grunted the old fellow, inl a mollified tone. "Wheou ho was no higher tlian this thwart I marked hint with the eagle of Te Papa. Let him travel where lihe may, le will remember Bosco." "Certainly! Now I think of it, tlierle is a tattoo mark on my master's left shoulder." "Nay, the eaglo is upon his breast," cried tlhe Maori quickly. "Of course, old mani. What ;init I thinking about ?" responded tlhe Ferret. "See yondor; whalt light is that "' Ihe added, suddenly, pointing to a. red glare shining athwart the prow of the cutter'." "That is thlo Point Light," answered his companion. "From thlat peak it is several mies to Pukeliiii." "Good! H1ere, takei ai nipl olut f this flask. Master Hilton. will ewar''d c,0o handsomely for this job, Beosco." (To be continued.)
