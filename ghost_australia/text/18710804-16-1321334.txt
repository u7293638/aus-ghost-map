leading articlo which is exciting a good deal of favorable com- ment in tho Victorian press, recommends an entire chango in tho mode of conducting Minis tcnal elections It contends that so far as tho opinion of the community is thought to be m dicated by the return or rejection of a Minister bj his constituency, the test enforced by tho presont law is quito worthless The fact being that neither result is worth a groat, and that tho present system is the biggest farce jet incorpo rated with responsible Government It argues that tho return of Ministers is nearly alwats certain, as districts prefer to be represented by thom because it is behoved that more attention will bo pud to local requirement* Consequently principles uro sunk for tho tuno being, aud the choice resoltes itself into mete pounds, shillings, and penco considerations, a rotten borough system is thoroby oreated, and tho AsBemblj is forced to bohevo that tho alvisera of His Excellcucj have the confidence of tho

M'Coll, a local gentleman, m the absenee of the Attorney-General for whom the task was intended, proposed the toast of the .' Mining and Commercial Interests." In the course of his remarks he stated that the members of the Press who were prcent had set an example of talking and disoiderlincas which was a disgrace to the profession to which they belonged. Soino person here called out that the speaker was mistaken, but Mr. M'Coll main- tained that he was not mistaken. Ho referred to members of tho Press present whoso laughter and unseemly behaviour during the speeches wus such that they should be ashamed of it. As tho speaker was not cal'ed to order by the chairman, tho members of tho Press rose m a body and left tho loom umidst cne3 of " Don't go," and expressions of regret from those present. Sojie correspondence has lately taken place on the subject of intercolonial free trade between the Chambers of Commerce of Sydney and Hobart Town, but without any practical result The former bodj reiterates its standing argu. ments against ad valorem and piotective duties, and affirms tho opinion that the tanti should bo permanent nnd the necessary revenuo raisol by specific duties ou as few ai ticks of general con- sumption as possible, such as will not come into competition with articles produced in tho colony, raw materials of every kind to bo ad- mitted free. Tho Chamber, whilst anxious to see as free an interchange of colonial products as possible, considers that this can beat be accomplished bj extending in each colony tho list of exempt'OJS from duty and steadily adhering to the principle of freo trade. The Hobart Town Chamber forwarded two Bills, one by which it wa3 proposed to admit to Tas- mania, free of duty, all articles the product or manufacture of the colonies ; and the other, a New Zealand measure, which would admit colonial manufactures, provided tho raw material is also the produce of the colonies. In both bills, spirituous liquors and tobacco aro excluded from the proposed arrangement. The Sydney Chamber of Commerce points out that even the singlo difference mentioned between tho two plans proves tho difficulty of providing an equitable scheme of intercolonial free trade, and tho continental colonies of Australia would scarcely be willing that their wines and tobacco should bo excluded from tho benefits of such an arrangement. Tho Tasmoman people aro do serving of all credit for their continued en deavoi s to bring about a Customs Union ; but there are so many conflicting interests in the woy that there is no prospect of the objoct being attained for a long time to come, unless the colonies are forced into union by external influences. The Northern Territory of South Australia docs not all seem to be such sterile country aB wus at first supposed ; and, as it gets better oxplorcd, thero is no doubt that large tracts will bo discovered suited for stockbeanug. The first definite application for land for squatting pur- poses at Port Darwin has just been made to tho South Australian Government, by Mr Dillon Cox, a gentleman who has had considerable experience as a stock-grower, both in Queensland and New South Wales. Ho lately devoted a month, while on Ins way from Batavia, to tho inspection of the Port Darwin country, ond was so well satisfied with it that ho has applied to the Government for a grant of a sufficient terri- tory, which he will occupy as a pastoral tenant. Should his terms be accepted, it is his intention to bring over from Queensland, horses and cattle. If the settlement of this portion of Australia is ever accomplished, it must be stocked from Queensland, which will servo as a good outlet for aotno timo for our Northern surplus cattle. Elton tho statistics published by the Go- vernment of Tasmania wo gather that there was i considerable falling off in tho last wheat crop as compared with that of tho previous season, and it is estimated that there will bo 3000 acres less in cultivation with that cereal this year. The ateiuge yield per nero was 13 92 bushels. The total quantity of lund under crops of different kinds was 330,257 acres. The production of butter and cheese, nnd tho cunug of bacon, appear to lncreise. We noto that in the Deloraine district 9i acrc3 in linseed yielded 5213 lbs., troith 2d. per lb. ; and it is stated that at Longford three tous of tobacco were got from half au acre of ground. Nearly twolvo thou- sand acres of wheat w ero reaped by maohmory, I being more thau three times tho quantity of | I last year, and tho uso of warm wutor by tho J farmers in washing sheep has also largely m ] creased. Iho oterago yield per aero of tho I principal crops was as follows -Barley, 22*11 i bushels ; oats, 22 79 ¡ and potatoes, 3 11 tons. In roots there wis a great range of yield, ouo i district giving 16 tons of turnips to the nero, and I I uuother oulj ouo ton , tho highest nverago of I j carrots was 22 67 and the lowest 4 30 tons. Horned cattle increased 6362 head, aud sheep . decreased by 1S1.112. A crniors aud entertaining chapter could bo written on what might bo called tho mishaps of a ball room.

Wo hld a good illustration of tins tho other daj at Sjdtiey. Tho Loyal Orango Institution celebrated the 12th of July by a dinner and ball m the Exhi- bition Building, Alfred Parki and the ottair turned out a success, so far.

It would be interesting to know, for example, what have been left m place of the " kid boots, handkerchief, and light brown otcrcoat" described by ono of tho unfortunate owners j but tte must not pry too curiously into such matters. Suilico it to observe that m con- tradistinction to tho tttolve owners of missing articles on this occasion, there is ono finder, who states that " u black poncho, Scotch cap in pocket, bas beou taken by mistake." It is stated that the Adelaide Government have promised Mr Patterson, the constructor of the Northern Telegraph line, a bonus of £1500 if the Une to Port Darwin is completed by the end of the year According to all accounts there is little probability of this gentleman gain, ing tho reward We leam from the Melbourne Argus that at the last meeting of the Victorian Acchmatisa tion Society, the President was requested to place himself m cominumoation with the French Consul General, with a view to aiding and assist- ing in the restoration of the animals and birds m the Jardin des Plantes, destroyed during the recent siege of Pans, by supplying specimens of tho Fauna of Victoria In America the subject of boiler explosions is attracting growing attention In some of the cities insurance come ames are formed, which undertake the supervision of boilers and keep them properly repaired It is conceded that explosions aro much rarer where these com- panies arc at work. These is no longer any attempt made to deny that the labor system at Fiji in some cases amounts to neither more nor less than slavery, A writer in the Town and Country Journal describes his having witnessed an overseer standing over a gang of islanders with a stick m his hand, and beating them when they did not work fast enough to please him. The fol- lowing statements made by a contributor to the S.M.Herald who evidently does not tell all that he knows, are very suggestive :—" A very serious ob taele to cotton growing-one that will lead to trouble-is the supply of labor. It appears that native Fijtans cannot be tru>ted Ihey aro too idle and desultory Thoy will help occasionally Dut are apt to desert at a critical moment, and how can they be blamed' Ihey live cheaply on vams and taro, bananas, and breadfruit with an occasional treat of fish, and a mild debauch on kata Their houses are easily constructed, and the r scanty co-tume involves no tailors' billa Why should they work for a diet of yams, and £2 and 43 a year, not paid in money but in ' trade5 ' Tijians uot being available the planter seek to get natives from other groups to the north and west They find there is no use goiug eastward They would be glad if the men would come volun- tarily, and with a dear understanding of their engagements, but labor must be got, and tho planter cannot »fiord to be too narticular A number of »mall craft, known as ' labor vessels,' trade among the islands, get cargoes the be t way thev can, and sell them to the planters at £10 or £12 a head. No one at Levuka thinks of doubting that many natives are kidnapped, or enticed away from their homes on false pre- tences One vessel, for example, called at an island where the natives could not be induced to come on boaid, but they were anxiously looking for Bishop Patteson. Theeoupon the trader stood ou* to sea, rep nnted his vessel so as to make her look like the Southern Cross, con tructod a flag like that carried by tho latter vessel, and ogam stood in-shore Some natives now came on board eagerly, were told that Bishop Pattc on had met with au accident at another islaud, and wero carried oil to Fiji. Darker atori03 ure told whicli I will not here repeat And it happens occasionally that a labor vessel goe3 out on hei usual rounds and is never heard of again People surmise that this may not always bo from the natural dangers of the navigation, but that sometimos the outraged natives get the upper hand, and millet summary vengeance" Mu Chabws Matthews gives a California paper the following characteristic account of his visit to Honolulu on his way from Sydney to San Francisco -" Sailed for the Sandwich Islands at 2 in tho Moses Taylor, familiarly, but bv no means vulgarly, entitled tho ' Rolling Moses ' Reached Honolulu, tho capital of tho Islands of Oahu, and tho seat of Government of tho Hawaiian group, on Saturday, the 19th , l8 days, 40134 miles' (aoouncy ogam-exactas an architect's estimate, £4000 1« 3Jd ) Head winds (of course) all the way, longest passage (of course) ever known, and certainly the weariest Heavy rolling seas, not a sail, a bird, nor a fish sighted, tho onlt excitement we had arising from the odd noveltt of two Thursdays coming in one week, two 9ihs of February arm in arm At Honolulu, one of tho loveliest littlo spot3 upon earth, I acted one niaht ' by command, uutl in the pre ence of His Majesty Kamehameha V , King of the Sandwich Islands' (not 'Hoky Pokj V^ouky Fong ' us erroneously reported), und a memorable nicht it was On my way to tho quaint lil tlo Hawaiian Theatre, situated in a rural lane, m tho midst of a pretty gardeu, glowmg with taudv tropical flowers, and «haded oy cocoi trees, bananas, banyans, and tamarinds, I met the pluybill of the evening A pcruibulatine; Kauuku (or nativo black gea tleinau), walki il, between two boards (called m London, figuratively, ' a sandwich man,' but hero, ot cour e, literally so) carried aloft 3 largo illumi mted white lantern, with tho au nouncement in tho Kanaka languago to catch tho attention of tho colorid inhabitants ' Charles Matthows, Keika Kern Po (theatre open this oveuiug) Ka u«uoKe Komo ana (n served seats, dress circle), 2 dol 30 c , It oin mua (parquette), 1 dol , Noho ho (Kauaka pit), 7o c ' I found tho theatre (to uso the te-hmcal expresión.)
