No small constitution as this exists in any part of the world-no constitution exists which has a shadow of resemblance to this one. As Sir George Turner has reported to the people of Victoria, as Mr. Peacock has reported, and Mr. Deakin and Dr. Quick, the majority of the states will not listen to this proposal in its bald form and to ask for unheard of and impossible conditions is to oppose fuU'ralioii. The situation is serious, because if the forces led by Mr. Higgins hills by Mr. McLean unite their. strength undoubtedly the Australian CHUSO is in the greatest danger. Success would hardly be possible. We should be face to face with defeat. This is the real peril, and is ever to be borne in mind. The ingrained pro interest we cannot hope to bring over, but there is what should be an effective appeal to the common sense, the patriotism of the critical politicians. The proposed constitution is the most democratic in the world. Both Houses are to stand upon a man hood suffrage basis. Each colony will send to the one House according to its population, and each colony will send an equal number of representatives to the other. But both Houses were manhood suffrage Houses, and surely if there is any federal spirit tin' manhood of the one state can trust the manhood of the other. Even the most advanced of the radical leaders admit that the proposed constitution is the most democratic in the world. There is no other Upper House which rests on manhood suffrage and which is subject to a dissolution, and afterwards to a joint sitting with the Lower House. Why not rest content with so much, and trust to time to introduce such changes as experience may justify? If a great forward step is taken towards the ideal of the advanced Victorian democrats, should not those democrats be satisfied-romemberlu,. that some concession is due to the advanced democrats of South Australia and the other smaller states, who look upon a States House as a guardian of liberty? The present concession to what may be called the numerical democrats is enormous. More does not seem to be possible. No doubt the Conference will do its best, by tact and consideration, to assuage all feelings; and when it has finished its work the pinch will come. "Will all the political parties that favour the cause loyally acquiesce In the final compromise, and join heartily In the effort to carry the day-? If there is division in the federal ranks, that division is necessarily fatal. If we do not remember the need of sacrificing any crude political idea not approved of by the majority to the higher aspiration of a united Australia we give the hands of the clock a wrong and a backward turn. Another year has come, bringing With it no change in one important element of social life the reading tastes of the public. We allude to that department of literature which in bulk dwarfs all others Action, of which n perfectly Gargantuan meal is supplied naturally, and devoured with an appetite which seems Insatiable. Yet, enormous as is the demand, novel readers are to some extent eclectic In their taste. A certain Epicureanism accompanies their -hunger.- Plain homely fare is not consumed. The novel of the earlier part of the century, was-seven times out of.len..domestic. It endeavoured to Irradiate with interest the commonplace social life of the day. Jane Austen and her cloud of imitators were strictly "society" writers, and poor stuff their work be came when not a spark of the leader's genius was discernible among her dis- ciples. Dickens, dramatic as he was, was essentially domestic In most of his scenes and types of character; the rare gifts of Trollope were almost exclusively exercised In engrossing readers with the purely humdrum. George Eliot's best work depicted with marvellous fidelity scenes of rest ful modern life.
