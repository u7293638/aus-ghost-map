THE GHOST. Its Existence Verified. Several appearances of the ghost have been witnessed duringthe week. The ghost appeared in the back yard of the London Hotel, at about half past 1 o'clock on Thursday morning, on this wise. A company of visitors wer.t staying at the hotel, and Paul, one of men engaged on the premises, was sent on a message to the far end of the yard. On returning a huge apparation appeared, causing him to nearly faint with fright. Recovering his voice, how ever, he called out lustily, but the thing quickly disappeared, and Paul was carried into the hotel in a fainting condition. Then again late on Thursday night one of our esteemed police ofUciafc saw the ghost in a dual form, both dressed in pure white, but before he could come near enongh to make au arrest, it had disappeared. But the very latest is that early in the morning, about 2 o'clock, a milkman was starting on his rounds when the ghost, after giving a fiery warning, asked the purveyor of milk, in very na ghostlike tones, to give him a lift. He then explained that he was exhibiting himself for a wager, and he further intimated that the machine he carried inside his overcoat enabled him to extend his proportions to an enormous size in a few seconds, thereby giving himself a supernatural appearance. We understand that the milkman complied ; with tbe demand, but the ghost dis appeared suddenly, leaving a sulphurous | smell behind. Who was it is now tbe ? question.
