LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, MAY 9. That the times are hard is certain, yet there is now and then a rift in the clouds that Bli o wa the sun is shining somewhere What- ever suma a china vase may sell at, or even a picture at an auction, the fact affords but little encouragement as to the general prosperity of the country. A few china maniacs, or a few patrons of art, may have their ten thousand a year while the world at large is starring in the case of large sums being paid for books, and especially for modern books, the matter, however, looks more hopeful. for the taste for literature is more universal, and to some extent therefore " fancy prices in that line denote a more wide spread well being In this respect the recent sale of early and rare editions of Mr Tennyson's poems is very satisfactory When the ' ' Poems of Two Brothers " was brought out in 1827 there were a good many copies I fancy " still to be had on application at the publisher's for some years afterwards and no one perhaps would have been more astonished than the two authors (there were, in fact, three of them, Alfred being the youngest) if they had been told that 50 years hence, eight, nine, and ten pounds would be given for that not very attractive looking volume Still more surprised will be Smith, pub lisher, Cambridge '-if matters concerning " The Row' still affect him in his remoter sphere-to hear that his " tract containing " Timbuctoo," by Alfred Tennyson, sold for three golden sovereigns Did ever prize poem bring one half such a price ' If it is true that the value of a thing is what it will fetch from henceforth " Timbuctoo ' (which is said to have won the University prize in a very indirect and unusual manner), must be thought much more highly of than it used to be The great feature of the collection, however, was the "Lovers Tale,' a poem of GO pages, almost unknown to those admirers of Tennyson to whom he is as an ancient classic It realised no less a sum than £11 The first edition of even so well known a work as "In Memoriam fetched £3 5s Never before, I suppose, in an authors lifetime-indeed Tennyson himself was present at the sale was a more gratifying tribute paid to his reputation for my own part, though I admire the laureate as much as any of these bibhomamaca, I would rather have the latest edition of his works, with all corrections and improvements, than one 50 years old, but what has happened has caused me to take great care of my own early poetical productions which, since there was never more than one edition of them, must surely one day be more rare and valuable than any of Mr Tennyson's. from some lucus el non lucendo principle (for my poems did not "move"), I am reminded of the poetry of motion and Madame Taglioni From a recently published biography of here it appears that she could never have been popular as a public dancer in these days, for she never showed her legs, she could not be persuaded to wear a petticoat so short as to reveal her knees "She was audacious enough to believe that feminine modesty could be as fascinating as feminine immodesty ' On the Emperor of Russia being informed of this Circumstance, he descended from his box into the stalls of the Imperial opera to con v ince himself of the fact, and did so not, as it would appear, to his satisfaction In Russia, that country of extremes, matters seem to be growing socially worse and worse, as must needs happen when a Government sits upon the safety valve of political life-the press If I were a despotic sovereign (which Heaven forbid and consequently liable to be "potted at at uncertain intervals by those who objected to the principles of paternal government, what I should especially dislike would be, after each attempt upon my Sacred person, to read that there was nothing in it-that it was a sham, a " bogus ' assassination, got up by my own police to excite sympathy and dis- tract the attention of my people from questions of necessary reform Yet this is what always happens in Russia The Government is so "cliques," and up to such amazing dodges, that its statements are always looked upon with suspicion If Mr Reynolds hiajVeies was published there, or even the Vrceklu DiaixUch, one would hear something on the other side of the subject, but there is nothing but the Police News to tell us about such matters, which in St. Petersburg is a Government organ. And I must say the circumstances attendant upon this last shooting at "Mr Alexander Nicolaieutch," as the Nihilists term him, are sufficiently melodramatic to be unreal One has heard of all sorts of things being " at one's fingers' ends," but that an assassin should be found with little globules of poison under each of his nails is a little too sensational What is very manifest, too, is that he had the Emperor under his thumb that is to say, within easy shot, yet missed him with a revolver four times As a rule, the Nihilists don't miss their men, however they may fall short of their objects And they are running their dark horse Anarchy against that net of his stable, Despotism, with great perseverance The publication of their reasons for the murder of General Mcsontrcff - a whole broadsheet, with a cartoon of the victim lying in state-is very audacious, and then, when their printing press is discovered, they murder the poor creature who betrayed them, and explain why they killed him "It will be useless to offer gold, for the last traitor has now left our ranks for perdition We have, too, at our command sufficient funds to resist attempts at bribery The execution (so they term it) of MeBentyeff cost us COO roubles, of Ixrnpotkins nearly as much, but we have 400 000 roubles to go on with One unfortunately cannot write ex while nihilist of such Nihilists as these There is no doubt too that assassinations are epidemical, as indeed, are all deeds of violence Since Peace us hunt, there have been at least a dozen cases of deaths by hanging among boys They amuse them selves with playing it Marwood (ourpre sent Jack Ketch), and suspend themselves to their bed posts A schoolmaster, commenting upon what I wrote to you of the "Dick Turpin boys the other day, assures me that our juveniles are not imaginative, but only imitative Example is of great importance in their education , but precept as contained in books of small account It is curious and very sad to note what a very little will often make the cup of human misery to ov crilow A poor woman Ina lately committed suicide through a heartless practical joke Some brute sent her a registered letter, unpaid, to obtain which she had to borrow 100 and on opening it found only a plain sheet of paper with a farthing in it. She was ill and poor and friendless before, but what seemed to prey most upon her mind was that cruel deception, and it drove her out of the world I pit) the joker he c do not see such things happening in England as your latest developments in bushranging but we see worse At Hands, I read, the bench of magistrates have been investigating a charge of cruelty against an old woman, who, having beaten her niece xy ith excessive severity), " washed her bruises in turpentine and salt, causing great agony) These Solons, having commented on " the undue seventy of the poor girls punishment imposed a fine of one shilling and costs M Leney er so little as a runaway knock 18 given at a London door we Bhnek out, YY here are the police I wonder whether it will strike anyone at Hanley (where the venue of the famous Dog and Mun fight was placed, not, it appears, without, judgment) to inquire, " M here is the Home Secretary ' Things often crop up incidentally in the conduct of some trifling matter of ten times its significance John Castle was convicted in Herefordshire the other day for stealing fowls "He is well known (as) a the newspaper report as the M Old Man of Herefordshire, from his having resided for many years in the woods of that district. It does not appear whether the gentleman is married, but if so, his property would be surely entitled to consider themselves as a county family Mr Onion (a bad name for a penitent person, by the bye), who was converted with many tears by a spiritual appeal from the late Mr Peace, has proved a backslider He was charged last week with being drunk and in capable from his own evidence, having come to the police office and surrendered himself The magistrate, who does not seem to have been reminded of a certain passage in Shak apeare respecting persons who " protest too much took it as a fresh sign of re formation, and only fined him in the half penalty no however added I fear some what cynically, "perhaps you will be send mg yourself to prison next What a revolu- turn it would effect if everybody who knew themselves guilty of an offence should give themselves up to justice Picture to yourself, Mr Editor, the procession-of bank managers, for example wending their way towards your substitutes for our Pentonville and Millbank ' I would as soon be lodged in either of those places as in VI whitechapel to judge by the experience of the sanitary officer in Una dis fact In a first-floor back room he finds a I foreigner, his wife, and two children with 12 fowls feeding under the bed in the next apartment - in fact the drawing room- j belonging to the same tenant he finds 12a fowls In another house in the occupation of another resident foreigner he finds 300 fowls on the second floor The atmosphere of the rooms and passages of these dwellings he describes as stifling I know of some cows who live in a first floor of Baker street but, then, cows are sweet I wonder to what nationality these foreigners belong who can stand such company But I no longer wonder that eggs ' guaranteed to be fresh laid in London do not taste so-at least, they do " taste so, but I mean not fear The golden laurel wreath to be given by penny) subscription among the people of England, to the Premier is now on exhibition at Hunt and Roskell Its value is £220 " Therefore, say the Tory papers, ' it represent the subscriptions of 52 800 persons YA Without challenging their arithmetic, I am not so certain of this fact, considering how far a ten pound note from an anonymous admirer would go in a penny subscription I have seen the Premier marvellously attired on more than one occasion, but I would give several pennies to see him with that wreath on, and I would give five pounds (if I had it to hear what he really thinks about it. There is no alloy of copper in the gold wreath as usual we are told Query, any brass I am glad to hear that we are to have permanent Eastern in future, for its being a movable feast puts my arrangements out exceedingly Sometimes I take a summer excursion at this period and sometimes I find myself, as now, involuntarily wishing my travelling companions a happy Christmas I he professor of astronomy at Greenwich College 13 so good as to tell us that The date of Easter Sunday simply depends upon the fullness of a hypothetical and supposititious moon, invented and made to move in an impossible manner by Pope Hilanua BO called, I suppose, from his indulgence in such practical jokes It is not unlikely, thanks to the improvement in science, that the days of pluralism may be revived, since the telephone now enables a clergyman to equal Sir Boyle Roche a bird, in being, or at least in preach- ing, in two places at once On Sunday morning a number of gentlemen met at a telegraph office in Manchester to hear a sermon preached by a divine at Leeds, a distance of 30 miles During the singing ' his sonorous voice, we are told, was distinctly heard above the congregation, but during the sermon the professional habit in which he indulged of dropping his voice at the end of a sentence made his deliver rather fragmentary In order not to inform the Leeds congregation that he was addressing another flock (which they would probably have resented the transmitter was placed under the pulpit next to the rev. gentleman a legs, and as he could not always be speaking to his boots without exciting remark, a good deal was lost this way Upon the whole, however, the experiment was successful and certain noteworthy BeBidea adapting itself to such serious purposes, science can be very funny A professor of ichthyology, in an article headed "Whitebait, informs us this week that in May and June one tenth of these fish are sprats and the remainder the young of the herring In August he found half were sprats and half were herrings What becomes of the whitebait he omits to tell us This reminds me of a sermon I once heard preached by a great divine in Edinburgh, wherein he said that ninety nine men out of a son dred were something or other (I forget what) and a still larger proportion of women One should always leave some margin, however small The question of copyright, which is just now so much to the fore, has received a curious illustration at Maidstone A London artist painted old Maidstone bridge in oils from a photograph, and the photographer has sued him for infringing his copyright The defendant was adjudged to pay a guinea, and to forfeit the picture, valued at 30 guineas, to the plaintiff, who has generously given it to the Maidstone Museum It has always hitherto been the artist who has prosecuted the photographer, and this inversion of the usual course strikes me as very charming A hy cannot " Mr Beaconsfield ' (us I see some of his penny contributors call him) prosecute Punch for his caricatures He surely has a copyright (through his parents, in his own face I know a novelist who, when he cannot travel to the place in which he wishes to lay his scenes, describes them from photographs Would you kindly Bay, Mr 1 Editor, in your Answers to Correspondents what money is paid to me formers on bringing this description of literary offender to justice I In the last draft of soldiers to the Cape there was a serious omission in llhaui Thompson, of the Royal Horse Artillery, ought to have been included he has been assaulting the police right and left, and could only be seized by the combined efforts of (five constables All this, however, it seems was but an experiment, the cm rents are being the officers of the law ' I am going to the war was his defence " and I wanted to know what I was made of Ivovv he knows, but the experiment has cost him 14 days of hard labour Now that blue china is losing its hold upon the fashion able mind ghosts are looking up none of your provincial spectres in ram shackle old houses, but real London ones, in a fashionable neighbourhoods I notice this week a long leading article in a Society Journal devoted to the haunted house in Berkeley square The writer has invented a couple of deaths in the final room' and one petrifaction " a stoney stare of horror that never left her face after that dreadful experience As a matter of fact nothing of the kind ever occurred there A house has only to be mine habited, and not to have its windows cleaned, to be tenanted by any number of "hosts 'The explanation of its being under is generally to be found in some eccentricity of the landlord In the centre of Kensington Gardens terrace is a fine house that would fetch, I should think, at least iCOO a year, which has to my knowledge been uninhabited for at least 20 years. At the top of it, easily to be seen from the Bayswater road, stands a huge tomb like structure of glass, said to contain human remains The story is that a rich Parsee died there, and provided in his will for his body being placed in such a position that the sun (when there was one should always glint upon it, so his sorrowing relatives stuck him on his own roof No one, it is thought likes to dwell in a mansion, however stately, with a dead Parsee in glass on the tiles-a theory ludicrous enough in these days, when a diminution of £30 in the rent would sweep away the most superstitious scruples The key to the problem no doubt is that it is the landlords fancy to keep the house empty, and make his neighbours mouths agape For my part though The Painters and the little I did give me a turn when I first read it I don't believe in ghosts within the metropolitan districts in the country), however I am open to conviction The Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol was asked the other day to adjudicate upon a matter in dispute between a rector in his diocese and his curate the latter had undertaken to occupy an old manor house in the parish, but had after wards declined to do so, and demanded lodging money instead His defence was that the house had the reputation of her a _ haunted, and that his nerves were not strong enough for the pla e The bishop went down to investigate the circumstances, and the curate brought two we witnesses one the church warden and one a previous curate, who testified to the existence of the shot and convinced the bishop It is not my habit to discourse upon other folks private alf area, and it will suffice to say that the apparition was the famous blue lady of the Methuen family The testimony of the curate strikes me as peculiar from its- commonplace and anything but supernatural character of had lived in the house for some week 8, he says, and never experienced any annoyance, though I was well acquainted with the tradition belonging to it One morning in the summer, I had to go by train to London I had picked my portmanteau, but while at breakfast remembered that I had omitted something My bedroom was rather dark so 1 draDOed the portmanteau out into the corridor, which was very well lit and into which several doors opened As I knelt down to unstrap my) portmanteau I became suddenly conscious of a feeling of awe and terror to which I can give no name except the conventional one of supernatural I knew, though I had my back to them, that some one was coming up the stairs , there was no foot-fall but when what n is coming drew quite close, I looked up and saw a woman dressed in blue She gazed upon me vacant!), but what I particularly noticed was that she made a little detour to avoid the portmanteau, then she w asked through an open door into one of the rooms I was not so frightened but I felt now or never was the time to solve the mystery I therefore followed the figure into the room vi late was bare of furniture, and quite empty The window, it was true, was open, but there was a sheer descent from it of a fit or Lift I have no explanation to offer I only know that I shall never be the same man again This purposeless sort of ghost intent upon its own affairs, strikes me as much more like the genuine article than the one which is now making such a disturbance in Wales because the burial club to which he belonged in his lifetime has refused to make an allow ance to his widow Lord Vivian s dream about the winner of the City and Suburban Handicap (revived by the death of General Taylor) falls in very opportunely with the last fashionable craze to which I have alluded Of course, it is not a ghost story but it is very uncanny his lord ship dreamt that the race was won by the teacher, an animal of which, to the best of his recollection, he had never heard, and which was not in the list of the running horses On his road to the course he tells a friend what he had dreamt, and the latter says, Oh, but there is such a horse , he is now named Aldrich, but he was once called The Teacher Lord Vivian then wishes to back it, but on his friend inform ing him that he is a worthless animal, and his recently been beaten in a trial race aban donE the idea His friend General Taylor, from America, however, who has overheard the conversation, says, ' Back him for me and his lordship does so, and wins to 000 for him What seems to me very charming is that the supernatural intimation intended to be nefit the Englishman was taken advantage of by the enterprising Yankee, and turned out a smart stroke of business Many will be reminded by this narrative of how Gully was induced to back the outsider Bloomsbury, who won the Derby He had not the slightest intention of doing so, but driving down to the rates, was much put out by a taxed cart in front of him, which persisted in blocking his way The name on the back of the cart was BLOORE bury, and Gully Kept repeating it to himself all the way, with the idea of summoning the man On the course, when asked what horse he was prepared to back for a thousand, he namedunconaciou8lyBloou bury, and thereby laid the foundation of his fortunes The decisions of the London magistrates are generally judicious, but I cannot agree with that last edict which permits " bus calls to refuse to admit persons into their vehicle, though the seats are not all called, because they expect some regular passenger The reason given is that your city man's business is of great importance, while your chance passenger can take the next omnibus, or the one after that. The complainant in this case-a lady objected, and I think with some justice, that her errand might be also of importance. The magistrate seems to have been the victim to the popular dear sion that to a city man time u money, 1 and that five minutes sooner or later at his office may make a difference to him of BOM vast sum, where there is no class of people living more given to waste their time in dawdling and " pottering about under pre tence of business It will gratify many persons who have a difficulty in mastering the letter " h to relax the Lancet upon the pathological relation of voice and speech The omission of it i seems is not really a vulgarity but a difficulty of acquiring sound and character as it passes through the mouth m i vocalised rush of air In future therefore no one who drops his his need be solicitous to pick them up again No man is treated with contumely because he has not got at car for music Vu by, then, should we bear so hardly upon the poor fellow who is unable to localise a rush of air which one would think would require natural talent of quite a high class 3 The Rev J G Wood of natural history celebrity has been lecturing on rat pie and making the subject so popular that here cciv 68 a thousand letters a week on that exciting topic Of course his correspondents want the receipt of the dish and he gives of them - Rat pie is made in precisely the same manner as rabbit pie the only difference being that in the case of the rat are the result is far more delicious The cook should be careful to procure as fine rats as possible cut off their tails skin, dress and wash them then cut them into four pieces, and add a few morsels of York fat YA hen cooked and cold to me is full of the most delicious jelly He (Mr v ) has often been dining with his friends when they had the most exquisite vitamin on the table untouched while every seat of the cattle had been devoured Mr Wood may be quite right but such is the unselfish ness of my disposition that so long as there is cold mutton to be had I will not encroach on his favourite dainty I think it would have been more judicious if he had I been with a less sweeping reform and suggested mice instead of rats Poetry has already lent itself to this idea in that famous glee 1 They all ran after the farmers wife who cut off their tails with a can iris, knife M bj should she have cut off their tails if she had not in tended to cook them 5 I am something more than curious to see what will be the outcome of the sentence of death pronounced against the unfortunate miner M ade at Lincoln for poisoning her self and child. The latter is dead and there fore she has been convicted of murder But her lot for the babe throughout is so apparent and the straits to which she was herself reduced SO pitiable that the crime in her case had hardly its usual meaning The letter she writes to the child's father beginning I return jour portrait with a heavy heart on the eve of what she intended to be their last day is one of the most touching I ever read My heart is too full to speak she writes so good bye for ever Respect Mrs v ethrmtton she has been a kind friend to me I have sent you a piece of baby s hair You won't forget her name Constance May Not a week goes by but I read of some case of cruelty. or desertion on the part of mothers: and fathers who are sentenced even when their little babies are starved to death through their neglect to at most a month j imprisonment The law seems to regard the life and the life alone to be incapable of appre carry anotive or of evil pressing its indignation against brutality If I mm i YY a he is to be a mushed more than these people it may not I am the law in some people a every nation, but it will be a blot upon the very front of justice A young" gentleman of 18 years s ago has been convicted of travertine, in a railway carriage with a child a ticket On being detected be maintained his position on the ground that he was only 12 years old.
