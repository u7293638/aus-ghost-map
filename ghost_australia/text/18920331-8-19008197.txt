POETRY. AT SUNSET. It Isn't the thing you do, dear. It's the thing you've left undone. Willoh gives you a bit of heart oche At the setting of the sun. . The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear. Axe your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone yon might have lifted Out ot a brother's way. The bit of henrtpome counsel You were burled too muoh to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time or thought for. With troubles enough of your own. The little act of kindness, So easily out of mind : Those ohances to be angele Which every mortal finds Tbey come in night and silence Each chill, reproachful wraith When hope is faint and flagging. And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And Borr JW Is all too great. To suffer our Blow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bit of heartache At the setting of the Bun.
