" A Subscriber."—Yes. It is our intention to enlarge our paper as soon as wo are enabled to do so, but at the present moment our means »n not allow us to do so.

We hope, therefore, our subscribers will remit our little claims on them, with as little delay as possible, as we have sunk, between three and four thousand pounds ii the establishing our journal, and in order that we may proceed, we hope our friends will sec the necessity of paying up promptly.
