A few' moments later she entered on her duties in one of the surgical wards, (performing , them accurately, fromhabit, ? but mechanically, for her thoughts were 'far absent. It seemed to her that she was failing one who bad never failed her, 'and her self-reproach and disquietude jgrew ^stronger ; every moment. ' After all he has been- to me, can I -leave him to an unhappy, life ?' was , the : definite question that now presented itself. At. last, in a respite from her tasks, she sat Idown and thought. deeply. . ' . ' ; .Roger, having' placed Mrs.- 'Wheaton. in a carriage,, was about to- follow on (Toot, when Mr. Wentwbrth claimed liis iattention for a time. At last, after' the majority of ihe guests bad departed, the pallied forth and walked, listlessly in the frosty air that once had made his step so quick and elastic. /. He had not. gone very far before he heard the sound of galloping horses, then the voices of women crying for help. ..Turning back he saw a carriage coming toward him at n furious1 speed: *A sudden reclclessness kvas mingled' with his impulse -to save jlhose in extreme peril, and Le rushed From the sidewalk, pprapg and caught with his whole weight the headgear of the horse nearest to him. His impetuous onset combined With his weight checked he animal somewhat, and before the jther horse, .could drag him ?very^faiya do1 iceman came to his Bid, dealing' a; utaggering; blow behind the beast's ear withliis club, then catchini? the rein. ' ' Roger's right ..arm : was so badly: strained that it seemed to fail him, and; before he could get out of the way, the rearing_ horse he was ^trying. ,to_,hold, struck him down, and trampled upon him. He 'was' snatched out' from under the iron-shod hoofs by the first gather ing crowd, but found himself unable to rise. . . I 'Take me to Bellevue,' he snid decisively. . \ ' , ; The hospital was not far away, and yet before an ambulance could reach; him he felt very- faint. ? , Mildred -sat in her little room that ; \fas Jpartitfqned. . off; from the ward. Her eyes were wide and. earnest, but that tfhich she saw was not present to their Tision. , .-..,, Suddenly there were four sharp strokes of the Bell from the hospital gate, and ^she started, slightly- oufcr of.vher reverip, the imperative summons indicated a surgical-' case which might'eome under her ?' cate.; .There 'was /something: so ab sorbing iii the character of her thoughts, however, that she scarcely heeded the fact that an ambulanop dashed in, and that a form of a man was lifted out and carried mtn tne central omce. cue saw, all this obscurely from'- her ;wiridow,- but such scenes .had become too familiar to check a deep current of thought. When a few moments later, the male orderly connected [with; the ward entered and 6ftid, ' Miss Jocelj'n. I've been down and seen the books, and accordin' to my reckonin' we'll have.the case,' she, sprang tip with alacrity, and began assuring her self that every appliance that might be needed was ? in! readiness. ' I'm glad I i must : be- busy,' she^murmured,'f'jbr I'm j so bewildered by my thoughts and impulses in Roger's behalf, that it's well r must banish them until I can grow calm and learn what is ricrht ' The orderly was' correct,1 and the 'cane' just brought- in' was speedily carried np on the elevator and borne t(jward't;he ward under her charge. With tbe.'celerity of weH-traioed liarids she had prepared *' 'everything and . directed that her new charge should be p'aced on ? cot near her room. She then advanced to learn the condition of the injured man. After 'a single glance she sprang forward, crying* 1 ? .''' ? Oh, morciful L Heaven ! it's Roger !' | ' Yon are acquainted with- him then ?' asked the surgeon who ha«i accompained the ambulance^ with moch interest. 'He's my brothers-he's the best friend I : have in the world. Oh,: be quick — tore. Gently now. O God, grant his life !

The surgeon is charge of the division soon arrived, and every effort of modern skill was made in the patient's behalf. Bottles of hot water were placed around his chilled arid blood -(1 mined form, and spirits were injectcil hj'poderrnically into .his system. '.'Tho fair young nurse stood a little in the background, tremb ling in her intense anxiety, arid yet so trained and disciplined that '.with the precision of a veteran she could obey the slightest sign from the attendant surgeons. ' He never failed me,' shn thought'; ' and if loving care cansave his life hesha'l have it night and day.' I To be continued.!
