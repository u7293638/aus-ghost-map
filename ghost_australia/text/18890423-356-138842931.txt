THE RED MAN'S DOOM. TnE Canadian Government has lately issued a full and interesting report on the remnant of the Red men, the now moribund race which formerly spread over the North American continent. It appears that 125,000 of these In dians survive in British North America, but how few compared with thbso hordes of warrior braves who chased the bison for scores of miles and filled their wigwams with in numerable soalps! "Fire.water "and small-pox have beeoon the Europeans' gifts to this old race; the Six Nations, our faithful though savage allies in the French wars, still live on, but what ghosts of their former solves!

Perhaps the Bintus in Central Africa will prove a tougher morsel to swal low, and now in the Dominion, the first instructors of the lRed Mon, the Josuits, are experioncing the changed conditions of the time ! It is only 130 years since the conquest of Quebec from Montcalm, and the Fronoh olo mont in the Can: dian Dominion still exists, andl even grows. These France' Amoricans, who now are British sub. jects, and the mixed races of Louisi ana, live on to remind Englishmon of the days when the French possessions in America ranged from the Great Lakes, down the whole course of the Mississippi, as far as Now Orleans. To Wolfe and the old Now Eng landers in the West, to Olive and Warren Hastings in India, the British Empire owes some of the fairest por tions of her domains. The effoects of the Seven Years' War are as active asi ever.
