Iloetr'. The Siit of Omissiotn. Itisn t the thing you do, dear, It's Lit thing you leare undone, Which gives you a bit of htartache At the setting of the sunt. The tender word forgotten, The lett.r you did not write, The fower you might have sent, dear, Areyour haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsomt counsel You were harrikd too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone Tthat or had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These httle acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, Thrse chances to be angels, Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each chill, reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late; And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache, At the settingof the sun. -MAnRGAnRET .
