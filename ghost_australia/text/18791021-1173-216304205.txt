Original Poetry. GOOD NIGHT. [The Christian Colonist «ays the "following lines, written by Mr. John Holt, of Port Darwin, reached us a few dsys before tha electi ic wire brought the sad intelligence of his untimely death. They wdl be read with interest by his friends.J Embrace me, Saviour, ere I sleep, Bestow the word of peace ; Tby side, with glorious cleft so deep, Shall cause unrest to cease. Ah, Ti«w I Thee, in faith and hope. Flesh of our flesh—likeours thine heart. Clasp now my hand while thus I grope, Nor sleep, nor death avails to part. Where are the ghosts which servethy will— Spirits of weal, so light of wing 1 Send some who heavenly pathways fill, The wall of fire aronnd me fling. Good night I I leave each se^guoui thought, And darkness shuts the world away; Yet sometimes has the 8pint brought To closed eyei a beauteous day.
