J.. and R..-.James' >Fortuna did; net even get a- place ::in tlie.frtwe.~races. for-, which, she started at the Wyndham 1 meeting 'Oil' Saturday. She misbehaved herself also, as she kicked Tetn Hales, who was- on Isapper Tandy. I'am'iiot surprised,.at her defeat, as Kenny Cameron on his way -down told me that she was not cherry ripe. ;•'':"; •• ; . ,:.,";:. ; The following are the results of the. Wyndham races on Saturday.

I have been.guilty; pf-great injustice tp Bairnsdale inrallowing this letter ;te gp fprth. Npw.:once fpr all I state here that I thoroughly approve of every word in -" Bow's" • letter, otherwise' I should have disclaimed the part of it in which, il did not believe: So far as-the • statement'that I', " was-informed whilst in Baimsdale that Mr; M'Kean's 1 cup ' had been fcrwarded thrpugh Mr Gppld, J.P., that gentleman- being deputed by the; owner to. name the event for which tlie prize should be given," is concerned, I most emphatically denounce it as a false statement, and to, prove that such is thecase I must say -that I never to my knowledge heard Mr Goold's name; mentioned, • nor have I even ever heard of any such a person being :m Gippsland.- This very, fact; is..flriite .efficient, refutation tp : ,-tlie : - statement made use pf by " Archimedes,": and I am sure tliat'my readers will agree 1 with me, especially when I say that all the members pf the Sale crews to whom I have. spoken are quite as ignorant of Mr Goold's action as I myself am. I understood' that Mr• M'Kean's cupihad .been.. forwaraed';*ttebugIi T^'T^ppmj^"-So'-far? as tlie remarksm V,Bow's'' letter (about, Mr Herbertson) being. unkmd. and ungenerous," I. must say I think the contrary, as the -Sale crew are obtaining the necessary proof frpm Tasmania to sustain their statement that he was in no, way' 'qualified to compete, at"the regatta;. he;-having whilst in the "tight little Island" earned his living on the water and-having wom races there alsou Ifihe committee hadrdecided to hear, the protest the day of the regatta, I believe that sufficient proof could; have been furnished then- and there-to : sustain it,-but m the meantime . I may. state . that, the Sale ccmmittee will by. the 4th pf May.bring fprward the Hobarton papers and show, that Herbertson is not what lie represeuted; himself to fee; viz: , duly qualified to compete '-at an amateur regatta and as a. maiden oarsman.: Before attempting to traduce a brother- scribe, "Archimedes", sheuld obtain such knowledge as would allow him to-.-make-'a-true and not false ; assertion, as -is.thexase in his .notes aneht ' my knowledge ,of,-Mr. Goold. The fact< the whole case -lies m a nutshell and I may.- ^ust ias well speak out pnee. as ' the'.facts .can-' >be ,summedup »:Hi'*'a very'.few sentences., fl'ni.conse-- quence of the accident to Enox, Fricker's departure from'. Sale,.and Campbell's in-: ability to go >to Bairusdalc, the Sale men wrote to the Bairrisdale committee,stating, that they would be unable to- compete in? the Senior/Four race. The reply from Bairnedale swas to the effect that the money had been subscribed by the public of that place in anticipation of seeing tliis race an^particular,land' they:thought it; would spoil the whole regatta jf Sale did not compete for it, as tlie public would not go to see the race if it were to be rowed by two Bairnsdale crews. They urgently .requested -tliat on.- this account Sale would manage • to ->make up a crew. In answer to tlus Sale promised that such should be done, but at the same time stated that it would only be with the view of obliging Bairnsdale, as our crew had not a ghost of a show of winnnig. In spite j.of this,;>and iknowmg.r-as ;;they -did j that it was voiily to oblige Bairnsdale that the Sale men pulled the race at'all,;at, the greatest disadvantage; at .winch a crew could possibly-' compete, the prize of the day was put upon this very race. I shall make no cemment, but if the piece of plate were on my sideboard (had I one !) I should 'take particular carc to have as neat a looking case for it as I could find, . and have it always.kept securely locked. Reports are continually reaching me of the large number of dpgs in training.fer the meeting to be held on Queen's Births day, and it seems as if my remarks about the necessity, of another stake will come true. I am told that some lovers of the leash :have as many ,as four or five -in work, - so' that talcing the hares, the country, the stakes ind .everything, ^se collected ;witli the North Gippsland Coursing Club, there is every reason to:beheve ,that the coming season will have to be recorded as a thorough...,success.:,.Whilst.,m -Traralgon last Friday, Mr Sutcliffe interviewed Mr M'Eean, and that gentleman-very kmdly promised to do his utmost for the club, and even said he , would either become-a subscriber or would, give: a trophy ito. be competed for.- Arrangements are being made to secure,Mr M..Grunton as judge for the meeting. ,:,.This gentleman is m eveiry .'the position, .as he.lias had a large: experience m coursing ih."
