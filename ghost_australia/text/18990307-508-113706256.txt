To the Editor of the 'Evening News.' Sir,— Presuming that it will be optional to 'the representatives of New South Wales to submit only such places as they may think proper from which a site may be chosen for the federal city, then such distant places as Albury, Bombala, etc, could be left out of the list of sites to be chosen from, and so prevent any chance of the federal city being too near to Melbourne. I would go so far as to suggest that no place be submitted further south or south-west to choose from than Duntroon or Yass Plains. Between either of these places and the Goulburn Plains there are several sites -which are all that eould be desired, and by li.Tnit.ing the distance to the south appears to me to be an easy way out of the difficulty of secur ing the federal city within a reasonable distance of Sydney. And if some arrangements could be made to .hold the federal Parliament in Mel bourne and Sydney alternately, there would be less inducement for the small colonies to en deavor to delay the erection of the federal build ings than if they were held in Melbourne only. 1 consider the words of Mr. Peacock, of Victoria, are well worth remembering by the people of this colony, when he said: 'If the federal Parliament controlled the selection there would not be the slightest ghost of a show of any other place but Ballarat being the federal city. I have any amount of private information to confirm me in that opinion.' Comment on Mr. Peacock's words is unnecessary to the intelligent reader. — Yours, etc-» - S. MTSTERNEY.
