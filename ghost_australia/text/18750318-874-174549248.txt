OATMEAL. AT the International and Intercolonial Rifle Match which came off last month at Parawai, N.Z., the English team at 400 yarJs made 225, the Irish 221, the Colonial 218, and the Scotch 211, In telegraphing the result to the LytUlton Times, its special correspondent says :—" The Scotchmen complained that no oatmeal was served to them in their rations, which accounts for their indifferent shooting. Otherwise they are satisfied." Oh, that Buckle could have lived to read this verification of his theory with respect to the influence of such a physical agent as food over the character of a race. As to the ghost of Dr. Johnson, if he is anywhere "knocking about" at Spiritualistic circles, he must blush—by the way, do spectres blush 1— at the recollection of his disparaging definition of oatmeal. Who will speak slightingly of Athol brose after this, seeing that it was the want of this animating and inspiring diet that put the Scotchmen at the bottom of the list among the competitors at Parawai ? According to an old national song, quoted by the Lyttelton Times, " When Fergus the first o' our Kings I suppose, At the head of his nobles had vanquished his foes— Before they began they had dined upon brose. Our soldiers them times wore their kilts and short hose With their bonnets and belts which their dress did compose— Aud a bag o' oatmeal on their backs to make brose." Let the competitors at our Highland sports and pastimes bear this carefully in mind, and dine upon trose before they begm putting the stone, or tossiug the caber, or dancing the sword dance, or going through any of those fantastic performances which seem so inexplicable and purposeless to us poor Southerners. And when our Scottish volunteers march out to the Easter encampment, let them not forget iu addition to the regulation accoutrements, to provide themselves with " a bag of oatmeal on their backs "—say half a hundred weight or so—wherewith " to make brose."
