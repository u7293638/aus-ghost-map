SOMETHING LKIKE A ?CRITIC. A caraTc in a western state of America lately saw George MIiln as IHamlet, and on the following day his conclu sions were published as follows: - " There is too much chinning in the piece. The autlo: is way behind the times, and seems to forget that what we want nowadays is a nnir-raising situation and detectives. Iu the hands of a skilful playwright a detective would have been put upon the track of Hamlet's uncle, and the old man would have been hunted down in a manner that would have excited the audience out of their number elevens. The moral of the piece is not good. The scene where Hamlet spsses his mothebor is a very bad example to the rising generation, and it isn't holped when the dreary old ghost comes in and tells him to hold his jaw. Our advice to the author is, a little more action, a little more gurgling taffy, a fair share of variety business in his next piece. In the specialty acts of the play scene he has entirely missed his opportunities."
