As I hey sal lied in their places, Santa Claus went up to CiistawHj-, Lord Wilton and Ironmaster being next prominent. Castaway continued in a forward position up to the half-mile post, succeeding her being Lord Wilton, Agitation, Ironmaster, and Chuckster, with King Lud last. Coming down to the turn, Chuckster and Creswick made a forward move, and the former was soon on terms with Castaway, who retired, and Ironmasterthcreforo went close up to Chuokfeter. The two latter entered the straight head and head and raced together to the distance, where Hales on Camarina came out from the centre of his horses, challenged Ironmaster and Chucketor, and after a merry finish won rather easily by three parts of a length. Agitation, with a fast run, secured third place a head from Ironmaster, and a similar short interval divided the third from j Chuokstnr. Creswick was next, a couple of lengths from the fourth; then came Castaway, and Trump Yoss was last. Time, 2 minutes 2 seconds.

Tandstickor and Moonlight led the way to a capital start, and Trumpeter went to the front as they entered the back, followed by Songster and Blackthorn. In the centre of the back, Trumpeter became leader, Black Jacket following, then SougBtor, Tundstiokor next, and Hope last, Songitcr, after passing the sod wall, took the lending north, and came into the straight clear of Tandstickor, after whom succeeded Trumpeter, Friendless, Moonlight, and Blackthorn, with Hope as the storn- otuisor. Passing the stand Blackthorn was leader, followed by Friendless and TandBlickor ; whilst I'liondl.ws astounded command in rounding the turn, next to him being Tnndsiiekor, Blackthorn, Trumpeter, and Napoleon, Friendless showed the way up the hill, and the only noticeable incident as they rose on the hill was the extreme rearmost position of Hope, now come 100 yards behind everything. Along the back of the course Tnndhtickor had gone into the van, and attending him were Moonlight, Australian Court, and blackthorn; whilst Napoleon had suddenly beat a retreat in front of Hope. At showed well Moonlight fell, and Governor then led Blackthorn a couple of lengths, close up being Australian Court and Tandstickor. The succeeding obstacle disposed of TandMickor's chance, and Governor now was sent along, but Blackthorn stuck to him for a little, only to fall away, and Governor made A run into the straight clear of Australian Court, Trumpeter, Fickle, and Napoleon. The final run for home was a very hollow affair, as Governor won in a canter by three lengths from Australian Court, and Napoleon finished third at an equal distance: Trumpeter was fourth, and then came Fickle, Blackthorn. Songster, and Friendless, Hope turning up some time after. Time : 4 minutes 26 seconds. ST. VALENTINE'S HANDICAP, of 250 Sovs. 5 furlongs. Mr. J.
