The voice of the fftlliTrfr yi**Kte w^oes of the sea and tke^wind, were as an outer memory to a contemplative listeners buy not particularly so to Mr. Riderffiyd, wheriat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock-gates, dozing. Wine most be got into a butt by some agency before it can bo drawn out; and the nine of ] sentiment'never baring been got into Mr. Biderhood by any agency, nothing in nature tapped him. As the Bogus art, ever and again nodding himself offhis "balance, his recovery was always attended by the absence of any one else, he had aggressive I inclinations towards himself. In one of these. I starts the cry of "Loot, ho! stock!*' pre- | vented bis relapse into a doze. Shaking him self as be got up, like the surly brute he was, ; he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end, and turned his face down-stream to sec w&g; hailed. .. . It was an amateur-sculler, well up to his work though taking it easily, in so light a boat that the Eogue remarked: "A little less on yds, and you'd a'moet hi" been, a Wagerbut then went to work at his windlass handles and ] sluices, to let the sculler in. As the latter stood in his boat, holding on by the boat-hook j to the woodwork at the lock side, waiting for the gates to open, Bngue Biderhood recognized his "T'other governor," Mr. Eugene VVray- j burn ; who was, however, too indifferent or too inuob engaged to recognize him. The creaking lock-gates opened slowly, and j the light boat passed in as soon as there was room enough, and the creaking lock-gates j closed upon it, and it floated low down in the j dock between the two sets of gates, until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it out. When Biderhood had run to bit second windlass and turned it, and j while he leaned against the lever of that gate to help -it to swing open presently, he noticed, lying to rest under the green hedge by the towing-path astern of the Lock, a Bargeman. The water rose and rose as the sluice poured | To, dispersing the scum which had formed be hind the lumbering gates, and sending the I boat up, so that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the barge man's point of view. Biderhood observed that ] the bargeman rose too, leaning on his arm, «»< secmod to have his eyre fastened on the rising j But, there was the toll to be taken, aa the gates were now complaining and opening. The T'other governor tossed it ashore, twisted in a piece of paper, and as ha did so, knew his ' man. , " Ay, ay? It'* yon, is it, honest friend?" ' said Eugene, seating himself preparatory to resuming bis sculls. " Ton got the plane, I then?" "I got the pUee, and no thanks to yon for j it, nor yet none to lawyer laghtwood," gruffly iinsaiiml iMwIinal "We saved pur recommendation, honest fellow," aid Eugene, "for the next candidate —the one who will offer himself when you are I transported or banged. Don't be long about* j it; will you be so good ?" So imperturbable was the air with which he • gravely herd to his work that Biderhood re mained staring at him, without bating {bund a retort, until he had rowed past a line of wooden oljeots by the weir, which showed like 5*«ge teetotums standing at rest in the water, nod was almost hidden by the drooping bonghs . cm the left bonk, as he rowed away, keeping out of die opposing current. It being ftu-n too lafoto retoH*wBh * any effect—tf that could ever have beta done—the honest man con fined himself to curving and growling in a grim under-tone. Baring then !got his gates shut, he crossed berk by his plank lock-bridge to the Ao*uigeja}$ sicto of the river. ■II,-.in so doing, he took another glanced the bargeman, he idid it by stealth. Be cast pirmuUf mi the grass by the Lock side, in am indolent way, with his back in that direction, and, having gathered a few blades, fell to eheir ing fiuan. 'The <£p of Eugene Wrajbuzn's Sculls bad become hardly audible in his . when the bargeman passed him, potting the! width that be could between them, and { keeping under the hedge. Then, Biderhood sat up and took a long look at trie figure, and j then oried: " Hi—i—i 1 .Lock, ho 1 Lock! j , Plsshw aler Weir-Mill Lock !" e lite bargeman atopped, and looked back.

He can't say nothing but cheek, rd'ha* liked to plump down aboard of him, neck and crop, with a heavy jmnp, and sunk him." Bradley turned away his 1 laggard face for a few moments, and then said, tearing Up a tuft of grass: ' " Damn bin, f" "Hooroar!" cried Biderhood. "Does yon credit! Hooroar! I cry chorus to the rotherest." , " What turn," said Bradley, with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe his face, " did his insolence take to-day ?" " It took the turn," answered Riderhood, with sullen ferocity, " of hoping as I was get ting ready to be hanged." "Let him look to that," cried Bradley. "I*t him look to that ! It will be bad for him when men be has injured, and at whom he ! has jeered, are thinking of getting hanged. Let Aim get ready for hit fate, when that comes about. There was more mcmbig in what he said than be knew of, or he wouldn't have had brains enough to say it. Let him look to it: let him look to it! Whan men be has wronged, and on whom be has buto wad his insolence, aj» getting ready to be hanged, there is a death-bell ringing. And not for them." Biderhood, looking fixedly at him,gradnally arose from his recombent posturewhile the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost .concentration «£ age and So, when ■the word* wen sdtHpota®, he' too Wled on one knee on the grass, and the two men looked At one another. " Oh!" said Riderhood, veiy deliberately spitting out the gnus he had been (hewing. " Then, I make out, Tbthcrcst, as he is a going to her ?" "He left London," answered Bradley, "yesterday. I have hardly a doubt, ttaii time, that at last he is going to her." > " Tou ain't sure, then?" "I am as sure here," said Bradley, with a clutch at the breast of his coarse alrirt, "as if fl was written therewith a blow or 11. stab at the sky. "Ah! But judging from the looks tm\ yon," retorted Riderhood, completely ridding himself of his grass, and drawing My sleeve acmes his mouth, " you're made daily sure afore, and have got disapintejj.

And theuflR I red had the ajipcsrance of fading out of ft and mounting up to Heaven, as. we say that blood, guiltily shed, does. . Turning back towards his Lock (he had not gone out of view of it), the Rogue pondered ss -daeply us it was within the contracted j power of such a follow to do. " Why did he 1 oopy my clothes' He efauld have looked like ] what iie wanted to kwk like, without that." ' This'w^ his thbughts; in which, up, by times, hkeahthalf floating uud half sinking rubbish in the river, the^ question, Was. it . done by accident ? The setting of a tap .{or finding out whether it eras accidentally done, soon superseded, as a practical piece of cun ning, the abstniser inquiry why otherwise it j was done. And he devised a means. Rogue Riderbood went into his Lock-house, i and brought forth, into the now sober fP&j; light, his chest 'of clothes. Sitting oaSfl grass beside it, he turned out, one by one, the < articles it contained, until he csone to a con spicuous bright red neckerchief stained black here and there by wear. It arrested his , attention, and he aat pausing over it, until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he Wore round his throat, and substituted the red neckerchief, leaving the long ends -flowing. " Now," said the Rogue," if artcr he sees me in this neckhankechar, I aeo him in a stnxTar ncckhankecher, it won't be accident!" Elated by his device, he carried his chest in again and went to supper. "Lock ho! Lock!" It was a light night, and a barge coming down summoned him out of a long doze. In due course he bad let the I barge through and wu alone again, looking I to the closing of his gates, when Bradley Headstone appeared before him, standing on the brink of the Lock. " Holloa 1" said Riderbood. " Back a* ready j Totherest ?" "He has put np for the nigbt, at an Angler's Inn." wu the fatigued and hoarse I reply. " He goes on, np the river, at six in the morning. I have come back for a oouple of hours'rest." " Ton want 'em," arid Riderbood, towards the schoolmaster by his plank bridge. ** I don't want .them," returned Bradley, Irritably, " because I would rather not bare than, but would much prefer to follow him j all night. Haverer, if he won't lead, I can't j fellow. I have been waiting about, until I could discover, for a certainty, at irhat time IwataiU f irfirafMte'Tiiers made sure of it, I should have stayed there.—This would be a bed pit for a man to be flung into with hit bands tied. These slippery smooth walls would give him no chsnoe. And I suppose those gates would sunk him down P" "Suck him down, or a waller him up, he j wouldn't get out," ssid Riderbood. " Not | even if his hands waru't tied, he wouldn't. Shut him in at both ends, and I'd pre him a ] pint o' old ale ever to come up to me standing here." Bradley looked down with a ghastly relish. " You run about the brink, and run across it, | in this uncertain light, on a few inches width | of rotten wood," said he. "I wonder you have no thought of bring drowned." ** I can't be I" said Biderhood. " You can't be drowned P" "So!" said Biderhood, shaking his head with an sir of thorough conviction," it's well known, I've been brought out o' drowning, and I cant be drowned. I wouldo'tfove that j there busted Blowbridger aware on it, or -her people might make it tell agin'the damages I awn togtt JBat it's weU-lmown to water- i ' ride characters like myself; that hhn as lias ; been brought ont o' drowning, can never tie j drowned." Bradley railed sourly at the ignorance he j would have corrected in one of his pupils, and ! continued to look down into the water, as if the j place had a gloomy fascination for bim,. , ; "Youseemtohke it," said Ritlerhood. He took no notice, bu( stood looking down,' as if he bad not head the words. There was a very dark expression on his faoe; an expres sion thst the Rogue found it hard to understand.
