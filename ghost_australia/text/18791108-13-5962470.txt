LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, SEPT. 20. If the ghost of " F.M.," as the old Duke used familiarly to be called, could revisit the glimpses of the moon, I can fancy nothing so likely to annoy him as the manner in which the officers of the British army, from Chelmsford to Carey, have been taking to the platform and appealing for sympathy to the public. In a smaller way of business than the slaughter of an " inept" of Zulus, a man does not, when his honour has been im- pugned, begin stumping the country to dis- prove the imputation. He offers to his de- tractors a dignified silence, and leaves the world to judge between him and them. And this should above all things he the case with men high in authority who have to answer for their conduct to their country ; they should treat anonymous assailants as though they had no existence. That a soldier should plead his own cause before the public, and make apologies for his mistakes in the field, is an unheard-of departure from discipline, and in the case of the humbler members of his calling would at once provoke censure from his superiors. The seamen at Portsmouth were forbidden to meet together for the purpose even of saying that they didn't like the cat-o'-nine-tails. But what is blasphemy in the private is in Lord Chelmsford but a choleric word. And his lordship has been very choleric. Nothing could be weaker than his tirade against the special correspondents in Zululand, and nothing more triumphant than Mr. Archibald Forbes' defence of them. But what shows the recalled commander's feebleness and want of judgment more than even his professional blunders is his hasty and illogical volunteer defence. In the old Duke of Wellington's time he would never have ventured upon it but the present Commander-in-Chief is " of the stump, stumpy " himself, and has, besides, a tenderness for lords. On the other hand, he must be furious with Captain Carey, who, indeed, has not improved his position in the public mind by his letter to the Christian newspaper. If the religious press is to give special thanks to Heaven for Captain Carey's escape, and to implore its favour for him in his future professional career, it seems hard upon the other officers of the regiment who do not enjoy that advantage, just as it was felt to be hard by the committee of the Botanical" in the Regent's-park that the Horticultural-gardens at Kensington should have been opened by "Bishop with prayer. In England, it appears, a society or two have been started for the purpose of taking Captain Carey's life, which, let us hope, some insurance company has already done. But the manner in which these proceedings have been set a going is vulgar and commonplace to the last degree, and only worthy of " Captain Thunder" or " Captain Swing." In France these things are infinitely better managed. A band of murderers has recently been discovered in Paris which, considering that the eldest is but 19, and the majority of them under 13, exhibits considerable talents for administration. The association consisted of 11 only (like a Bonnet), who were sworn on their entrance into it, very appropriately, upon a knife. Each member was compelled to have some regular employment (other than assassination) in order that his time might be accounted for to the curious such as the police authorities; celibacy was made imperative, as among the youthful Zulus; revolvers, hunting knives, knuckle- dusters, and life-preservers were all per. mitted, but only the two last "sedatives" were to be employed against private individuals, the knife and revolver being reserved for officials ; from what motive (though, doubtless, a good one it does not appear. Each member received six francs a day, with ten francs per diem added for every one thousand francs stolen, which seems a high rate of interest. There was also a prison fund, in emulation of our benefit societies, of two francs a day and of three if the gentleman in trouble was wounded. The band generally, like a Band of Hope, were vowed to eschew drunkenness and bad language, and also to appear well-dressed. Altogether, it seems to have been a very noteworthy institution. The Thames was lost last week in several localities. The river had become a lake, and whether one was rowing in mid-channel or over somebody's kitchen garden it was impossible to tell. From the terrace of Windsor Castle the whole district had become absolutely unrecognisable. The low-lying fields had disappeared, and showed only pools and pondS. It was like a friend's face grown un- familiar from his having cut his beard and moustache off. It is good, we are told, to see ourselves as others see us, and in that case Sheffield should think itself highly favoured. Some of its emigrants have been lately " interviewed" at New York, and afforded an opportunity for the American papers that they have not been slow to improve. They discover that " tea and coffee are not in general use in England," our universal beverage, it seems, being beer. As I have not been able to touch beer for 20 years, though I like it exceedingly, and find most of my contemporaries in the same position, this is a very tantalising statement. It is a comfort, on the other hand, to learn that though he is always boozy' the British workman is " seldom seen actually drunk." The main discovery that Cousin Jonathan has made, however, is that every Englishman is desirous to get to some country " where public sentiment has not irrevocably set against a man who tries to rise in the world" (think of this, oh Mr. Smiles), and where " he can say what he thinks without fear, I suppose, of being tarred and feathered or ridden on a rail. M. Milhaud, a French journalist, has also been amongst us " taking notes, and meets in the East-end of London " numbers of half-clothed women rolling in the mud and insensible to the tread of the horse that crushes them." He attributes the universal sadness that reigns in Great Britain to its " salmon and potatoes, its solid roast beef and its plum-pudding like fortresses." There are a great number of us, I fear, just now who are sad because none of these things are within our reach. If I thought Englishmen described foreign countries as foreigners describe England I should read no more books of travel. French manners, however, even when described by Frenchmen, are queer enough. One of the acts of cruelty of which Baron Scilliese is accused in the present proceedings instituted by his wife is that " when she asked him for money for housekeeping he stuffed her mouth full of bank notes." Now in England there is scarcely any woman who would object to have her mouth stopped in this way. Different nations have not only different opinions, but. diametrically opposite ones. In England, for example, no man who has a horse to sell is expected to speak truth about it. Horseflesh and veracity are incompatible Among the Bedouins, on the contrary, if we can trust Lady Blunt, recently published account of them, " there is only one exception to this general rule of lying every man, they say, has a right to conceal his own thoughts unless he is questioned on the breed of his mare." It is fair to say, however, that her ladyship attributes this inconsistency of conduct to the fact that among the Bedouins each man knows his neighbour's mare as well as his own, and that, therefore, duplicity is superfluous. If you don't know what " alopecia " in, and ate 40 years old, you are fortunate. When you are a man brushing his hair with his hat on you may be sure he's got it. It's the medical term for baldness. When it comes on earlier it seems, from the Gazelle tie They prove, that it may be produced from fright. A girl,' aged 17, though not unusually stout, had the misfortune to have the floor of her room give way with her. She was terribly frightened, but the next morn- mg appeared to have got over it, except that she had an itching in the scalp, her hair came out in great quantities, and on the third day she was as bold as a bell handle Another gentleman has taken up the trade of pretending to be a doctor, and obtaining fees for making sick children worse than they were It is a calling which, if I were the magistrate before whom the culprit was accused 1,1 am sure he would not practice twee 'the crime, as it happens, can only be committed at the expense of the poor, so that it escapes almost set free , but it is surprising that even the poor can he no 103rd upon by such shallow rogues One blows into the child's ear and exclaims, "An ful' the boy has water in his head and body,' and proceeds to cut him with a pen knife to let the water out Yet no suspicion seems to have arisen as to his being a quah lied practitioner Indeed the patients father recommends him to somebody else A matter which concerns, let us hope, a lesS numerous class, but which to them is literally " of the last importance, is that Mr Marwood is altering his system He is enamoured of what he calls "a long drop, and IR making, it seems, experiments upon the ladies and gentlemen submitted to him for operation, in illustration of his new theory Upon this a scientific person writes to the papers to inform us that the consequence of this novelty in that every criminal thus executed suffers on unspeakable agony, last- ing, probably as long as the slightest con seriousness and voluntary power endure, since to the simple and transient pom of strangulation there is added an awful and persistent shock to the nervous system, reaching in all likelihood to the utmost pang of which human nature is capable ' This is not cheerful news, but what strikes one as being almost as appalling is that any person in the position of Marwood should be permitted to institute novelties in his humble butter serious line of business I remember a small literary person as quainting me with some humour, that though it was true he was unappreciated by the public he had at least one believer in his genius that one, however, could scarcely be called " an independent opinion, for it was his wife. The Count de Chambord is more fortunate A lad at the recent Sorbonne ex animation was turned out for crying "Vive le Roi, and the Count has sent him £40 for it At that price he will find no doubt a considerable number of adherents to the white flag, and at all events he has made a beginning. In this dull season, when other subjects of interest are lacking, people take to living to be 100 years old There are many examples in the papers just now, one of an old lady in Skye who was born in the year Dr Johnson and Boswell visited it, but, wonderful to say, who does not remember the circumstance For 103 years she has lived in a turf hut, the smoke from the peat fire of which has had no outlet in the way of chimney Her longevity is, therefore, rather contrary to the views of health entertained by our sanitary authorities On the other hand, it is known that peat preserves a dead body, SO why not a live one' Another instance is quoted of a lady at Tiltia now in the 10th year of her age. , but Tilba is a long way off, and some of the details strike me as peculiar Thus she was married at 15, and her eldest son is almost a centenarian, but her youngest son is 57 ' He must therefore have been born when she herself was that age, which is surprising I cannot help thinking that if Mr Thoms took up this lady a case it would be shown to have a hitch some where Most people discover after their first week it the seaside that life is a little dull They are away from home and home comforts, and if it is wet the sitting in inn parlour and flattening their noses against " the stream- ing pans is very tedious work Yet one person at least has managed to get a good deal of excitement even out of watering places, and that both for himself and his family A gentleman of the name of Davis, with his two daughters, has been patronising our southern coast this summer in quite an original way Swindling is common enough, but family swindling strikes out quite a new line, and this is the me of "Mr and the Misses Davis, as they are described in the visitors hats of Weymouth, Brighton, Bournemouth, and other fashionable resorts they go to the best hotels and live like fighting cocks (and hens), and severing a shilling, or they take hand (some furnished houses and honour trades people with a large amount of custom without the least intention, or indeed capability, of settling their bills I wonder whether they enjoy themselves, or whether the reflection that there is certain to be a row sooner or later interferes with their happiness In my own case, I think I should feel anxious and fidgetty. On the other hand, Mich feelings would at least do away with the dulness and monotony of life at the seaside The " police office would form an additional object of interest to those mentioned in the guide book, and it would be interesting to speculate on how the demeanour of this or that person would alter towards us (whom we have made acquaintance with at the table d here or elsewhere) when our real character becomes recognised As one who interests himself in human nature, I should very much like to see the private diary kept by the Misses Davis on their autumn tour with their papa As they are suffering under domestic affliction, however-all three committed for trial for obtaining goods under false pretences one would hardly like to ask for it just now Among the various objects deposited the other day under the foundation stone of a schoolhouse in Massachusetts is a specimen of Mr Sankey's voice It is not, I need not say, in the form of sounding brass or tinkling cymbal but " photographically preserved in tinfoil A thousand years hence the antiquary may be astonished by hearing " Hold the Fort, which is the specimen selected, proceed out of that hole in Mr Sankey a best manner One has read of Sermons in Stones, ' but a by inn in granite is quite a novelty It has been quoted as an instance of extraordinary presence of mind that when the keeper of the Scarborough Aquarium was attacked last week by the octopus, who fastened his tentacles round his leg that " he hit upon the expedient of slipping his boot off, upon which the animal stuck to his boot for 20 minutes, and then dropped it, as if, though there " may be nothing like leather, calf was better But the intelligent device of the keeper, however 1 roseworthy was not original A similar instance of intelligence is said to have occurred in Borrow dule, Cumberland One of the simple farmers of those parts beheld for the first time a saddle m Keswick market, bought it and returned home in triumph, having put it to the use for which it was in tended only, unfortunately, his heavy wooden shoes stuck in the stirrups and he could not get out of them His sons were for putting him into the stable, but his wife, near Bon of great natural intelligence, suggested that they should take the saddle off, which was accordingly done, with her husband on it, and he was kept in the kitchen all the winter cording wool When his youngest son, how ever, who was a student of St Bees came home for his summer vacation, be at once exclaimed, " Why on earth did you not take father e shoes off The happy suggestion was acted on at once, and has long supplied in that district an argument in favour of university education An Italian professor has discovered that agents have a marvellous effect on the moral faculties He caused 75 girls (says the Vein York Times) to be subjected to different per- fumes, whereof milk produced amiability , geranium, decision of character, violet, gentleness and religious fervour and patchouli, moral depravity I don't believe one word of this but even if it were true, it would not be the first time that many young persons, and for that matter, old ones, have been led by the nose The Servians have applied to the British Government to have their new money minted for them in London. The adjective new is not a very delicately, for it is generally understood that hitherto they have had no current coin of any kind However everything must have a beginning, and the first issue is to be of bronze If the Turkish Empire should ever follow suit, I would suggest for a commencement as being more typical of its character brass The London Mint has a great reputation for coming, and some years ago the United States Treasury applied to it for a designer for the Bland BtHer dollar The principal figure on the com- was to represent Columbia, and he looked about him for a ' representative head of America female beauty This he found on the shoulders of a Miss Annie Williams, who was quite ignorant that she was about to become an historical character She would have been over to so much publicity it seems many eve but especially to " the fluffy hair and folded liberty cap, in which the artist has represented her However, there she is and I need not say is immensely popular It is shocking to think that this poor young lady's notoriety can never cease, except through her country s suspending cash pay ments On the other hand, when a head was wanted for Britannia, in the time of Charles II , the Duchess of Richmond, who sat as the model, appears to have appreciated the compliment It is in America I need hardly say, that the first umbrella school has been started in six lessons the pupils are taught how not to forget their own umbrellas and how to exchange them for better ones " in an artistically accidental manner What is quite as necessary and still more advan Hfceous to society, they are taught how to carry them without putting out other people 3 eyes There is nothing makes me more angry- except seeing a brute throw down a blazing fuses on the pavement than the way our London fools walk with their umbrellas under their arms with the ferrule projecting in the line of sight, or get into omnibuses with them brought to the charge as though they were taking the vehicle by assault with the bayonet It is certainly very trying to find delicate articles that have been consigned to us by railway or parcels delivery cart arrive broken to a recess notwithstanding " glass with care and this side up have been legibly written upon the packages, but even this does not justify such a superscription as "Handle gently - do naming - certain destruction, ' which it is now the practice to affix to such merchandise It is the usual way, it seems, in which honey now arrives in London in glass jars Putting aside the fact that a nervous railway porter may well object to handle such packages at all, which would considerably delay their transit, it is a most mischievous device, since if it becomes general real dynamite or gan powder will not be believed in when upon its travels, but will be thrown about as though it were a French clock the works of which, for the best of reasons, 1118 impossible to put out of order There is bad news from the Cape for the teetotallers Lord William Beresford s horse has gone out of his mind, without doubt from indulging in that stimulant which has here before been thought " to cheer but not in- ebriate It now appears that that recommendation is only a poetical licence, and that nothing that requires a licence is more intoxicating than tea A staff cook having left Borne tea in a sack, a Kaffir groom filled it up with corn and served it out to a troop of horses Lord Beresford s charger got the tea, and consumed it greedily Then it began to " plunge luck, and gallop in circles till it leapt down a precipice and was killed.
