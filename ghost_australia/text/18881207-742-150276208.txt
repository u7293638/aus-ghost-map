AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE. Perhaps one of the most extraordinary cases of somnambulism which has ever come under our notice occurred early yesterday morning. A young man, named Alfred Goodger, was returning from a fish ing excursion at Pig Island (his mates, three lads, named respectively, Billy Douglas, George Dean, and Tom Price, re maining to count the fish). As the little fellow arrived opposite the Old Noah's Ark Hotel, he was suddenly startled by a ghost-like apparition in front of him. The youth, however, evincing a great amount of courage, walked up to the 6pectre, and striking him heavily the sleeper awoke at the blow, stared at the lad, and exclaimed with a loud voice— 'Young man, drink T-i power's Montserrat.' — JAdvt.]
