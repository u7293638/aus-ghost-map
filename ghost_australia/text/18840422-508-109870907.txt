A Lunatic at Large. EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS. (by telegraph. from ottr correspondent.) Adelaide, Tuesday. An individual of extraordinary appearance, and decorated from head to foot with flowers, haÂ« been parading the streets of Adelaide and forcing himself into religious meetings, declaring that he is Jesus Christ. He arrived in Adelaide some time ago, and rode into the city on a donkey, with M6 hat and clothing and the ass' head covered with floral tributes. This eccentric con duct caused eome amusement at the time, and the extraordinary being was greeted with cheers and .hoots by the assembled crowd. Nothing daunted, however, he shortly afterward appeared in the police court, and having obtained .per mission to speak, was beginning a long harangue when ;the magistrate, having interrupted Mm, said that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter. The man then declared that during the last seven years he had announced to the world the very important fact that he is ' the Son of God, the Christ of God, created solely by the Divine Power of God, the Holy- Ghost, for the purpose of accomplishing His divine purposes relating1 to the personal reign on earth of the Lord Jesus Christ.' Tne man has a few con verts, and is trying to get assistance from the clergymen of the various denominations to hold a public meeting. He lately published a book in which he attempted to prove his identity, and he vainly endeavoured to found a new sect.
