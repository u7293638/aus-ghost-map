The Old Familiar Faces. CHARLES LAMB. I HAVE had playmates, I have had companions In my days of childhood, in my joyful school days; All, all are gone, the old familiar faces. I have been laughing, I have been carousing, Drinking late, sitting late with my bosom oronlM; All, all are gone, the old familiar faoes, I lored a lore onoe, fairest among women ; Oloaed an her doors on me, I matt not mo hex- All, all are gone, the old familiar faoea. I bare a friend, a kinder friend hai no man; Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly ; baft him, to mow on the old familiar faoea. Ghost-like I paoed round the haunt* of my childhood; Karth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse, Seeking to And the old familiar faoes. Friend of my bosom, thon more than a brother, Why wert thou not born in my father's dwelling? Bo might we talk of the old familiar facesâ€” How some they have died, and some they hare left me, And some are taken from me; all are departed; All, all an gone, the old familiar facet.
