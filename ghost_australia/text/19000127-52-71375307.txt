Genius and Insanity, There is undoubtedly (says "Science Siftings") some relation between extraordinary activity of mind and insanity. Geniuses are apt to exhib't symptoms of mental alienation, and,-singular to relate, their, children are usua'ly inferior to those bf average men. For instance, Cromwell, was a hypochondriac, and had visions; Dean Swift- in herited insanity, and was himse f. not a little mad; Shelley was/ ca'led by his .fr'ends "M?d She'ley;" Charles Lamb was crazy; Johnson was another hypochondriac; Coleridge was a morbid maniac; Mi!ton was also of . a morbid turn . of mind, nearly approaching insan'ty-rrolern ideas as to Hades are largely formed on the de scription evolved by his diseased : imag'nat'on and Byron said he was visited by ghosts. ., To' apply the Jaws of logic,, if genius denotes insan ity, insanity does not point -Â¡to. genius.
