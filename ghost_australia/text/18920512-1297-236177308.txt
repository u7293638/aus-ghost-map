The German mail steamer Lubeck cleared Sydney Heads at 7.30 a.m. yesterday for Tonga and Samoa. Tiie ship Lake Superior, at Melbourno from Glas gow, report that ou May 4, during a squall, tho jib- boom wits carried away.

The Orient Steam Navigation Company, Limited, arc tho Sydney agent of tho steamer Duke of Argyll, now iu port, loading frozen mutton, etc., for London. The steamer Loveroft is to he offered for salo at auction by Messrs. Fraser and Co., at their City Mart, George-street, at 11 a. in. to-day. Our Newcastle correspondent telegraphed last evening:— "The ship Templemorc, Captain Thom son, arrived hero to-night from Monte Video in ballast. She is to load Greta coal for Samaraug. The Teinplumore proceeded to the quarantine ground on arrival, and will bo inspected by the Government Health Officer to-morrow." THE ACCIDENT TO THE PORT PIRIE. With reference to tlio accident to the s.s. Tort Pirio the manager of tlio Tosmanian Fruitgrowers' Co-operative Shipping Agency Company states that there were ies than 6009 cases of fruit in tho ship's nftorhol'!, nnd it is thought that by tho re moval id' a quantity representing the square of tho hatch tho bullion which wns taken In sit Sydnuy a stiffening can bo Liken out of Hie lower hold. Tliia if placed on tho deck foiwurd would probably depress tho bows and throw the stern ol tlio ship high enough to admit of the repairs being effected. Tho ship could also coal at Monte Video instead of llio do Janeiro, thus es caping quarantine which would have to he under gone, as Rio is an infected port. Tho temperature of Mrutfi Video i3 slightly under that of Sydney and nearly equal to liobart. Therefore the fruit that will need removal, provided Mr. C'onnacher's idea are adopted, should not suffer much. Itis also stated that the fruit is under the charge of one of tho most Rkilful engineers iu the trade, mid the condition of last year' cargo speak highly for tho reputation of tho hqat and . all . connected with her. Tho delay caused by the loi, of tho propeller may not there fore delay tho steamer more that 48 hours. CHIEF STEWARD LOST. During tho passage of tho steamer Glan worth from the north (says the TownsviUu " Bulletin " of April 30) the chief steward, .Mr. Taylor, jumped overboard | and was drowned. It had been noticed tlmt tlio un fortunate man was in low spirits for several days, and at Cairns he obtaiued medical advice, and it was thought that his lit of despondency would quickly pass away. Shortly after leaving Cuims, however, Taylor went over tho stern of tho vessel and im mediately disappeared, no sign boiug seen of him afterwards. THE FLOATING OF THE BELLINGER. The steamer iicllingor, which was stink in Hokum's Bay by collision- with the barque lTcsto, has been iloatcii. Mho is said to have a very dilapidated ap pearance, the fillings of tho deck and bridgo being comjiletely wreckedr There is a Luge hole forward of the bridge extending well down the side. Tho task of raising the Bellinger was entrusted by tho Marino Underwriters' Assignation to Captain wynmrk, ono of tl\cir surveyors, who was at work at the wreck for two weeks. The salvage lighter Endeavor, be longing to tho association, earuo in very handy, and from hoc divers- tuid workmen were abio to get the. steamer ready for pumping out. The weather. .at times was very unfavorable, the heavy seas nnd tides in the channel washing away the llttings on several occasions. JTho uieu, under tho direction of the captain, " however, repaired . tho dumago timo nnd again, ami their eff ort have at lust been crowned wiLh tuiceess. On .Saturday the Eagle went to tho steamer, anil suc ceeded in pumping out tho' hull. Tho Bellinger rose from her sandy bed, but listed over bo much that tho Eagles pumps could not work, and before they could bo moved the steamer fell back In the water, . lilb.nl, nnd sank bark to her old position. 'J ho work had to be done nil over again, ami on Monday tlio Eagle once more engaged to pump the vessel out. As she rose the salvagu lighter was placed on ouo side and tlio Eagle ou tlio oLlior, and wire rope made fast across the steamer to keep her in posi tion. Tlio powerful pump .soon pumped tho water out of tlie- hull, ami at 3 p.m. a start was made for Williumstuwn. Tlio passage up Hobson's Bay was luade.vory slowly, but without accident.
