Yesterday morning a house on the Bo- tany-road was forcibly entered, and robbed of money? und goods to a considerable amount. One mun has been apprehended on suspicion of being concerned iii the transaction. A Coroner's Inquest was held in the Court House at Parramatta, on the 3d instant, on the body of an aged female who was found drowned in a place called the Dam. It appeared she had been seen the previous evening about seven o'clock, in a state of intoxication, and it was believed that she had missed her way and had accidentally fallen in. The Jury returned a verdict accordingly, at the same time recommending that the state of the dam be reported to his Excellency, in order that it may be fenced in. It is not long since a man and 4 horses were drowned in the same place.
