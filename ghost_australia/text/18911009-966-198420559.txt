THE RAILWAY CROSSING. Xbere are some who die on mountains high, And son** in war's oemmotjon; -Some suicide and cross the tide 'lo satisfy a notion, . And some ,there he who death must see Amidst the tempesttoswng. But far the most give np the ghost Upon the railway crossing. gome silly loons jump from balloons. And meet the fata that follows- Some lose ttieir breath and choke to death Upon thenaneman's callows; But those each day we lay away Beneath the headstones' mossinr Who try to beat the engine fleet, ' And die right at the crossing. Ob, you may to; with bnzz-saws coy. Whenever they're in motion, Or on a feather in stormy weather Attempt to cross the ocean: And even jaw your mother-in-law, Who Always does the bossing, Jtat don't go near—if death you fear— The fatal railway crossing.
