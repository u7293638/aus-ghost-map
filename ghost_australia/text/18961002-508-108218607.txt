CHAPTER XV. „ No sooner did' 1* begin to feel freed from Voltaire's power tbau I began to exert myself to find Kaffai-; if indeed lie were to be found. There was niiicli in my favors I possessed freedom; I had plenty of money; I bad plenty of time. On the other hand, there was much against me. Was he alive:* Were Voltaire's words true? Had I in my mesmeric condi tion yielded to his will in such a degree as to kill the wily Egyptian- and hurl. Max. in the pond? Again, if he were alive, where was he? Who could tell? Supposing lie had gone to Egypt, how could 'I. ;find Mm? .'' Pos sibly .he had a 'thousand haunts unknown to me. I determined to go to- Yorkshire, and soon found myself within the heritable walls of Temple HalL The houise 'was very quiet, however, for which I was very glad. I want ed to taut quietly with Tom; I wanted to in vestigate the whole matter. When I had finished telling Tom my story, he seemed perfectly astounded. 'What, Justin!' he exclaimed, 'do you mean to say that the villain used such means to get you out of his road and win Miss For rest for himself?' , ' 'I felt he was unscrupulous when I first met him,' I replied. 'I am sure he guessed my secret, and determined to get me o\it of the way by fair means or by foul.' We talked long concerning the matter; we tried to. recall all that had been said and done: but, in spite of all, we could not hit upon any plan of action. - ? . . -v 'Do you think she will marry Voltaire,' I said, after a short silence, 'if I cannot find Kaffar or prove that he is alive?' 'I am sure she will, Justin. Never did I meet with any one who has a higher sense of ihonor than she. I believe she would rather die than do a mean thing.' 'And yet,' I said wearily, 'I am almost cer tain I did not kill Kaffar. I can remembei nothing distinctly, and yet I have the con sciousness that I never struck him a blow.' 'And I, too, am sure you did not -lo this, Justin,' replied Tom. 'I felt that he was acting, in spite of the terrible evidence against Vou. But what is the use? If you cannot find the Egyptian, he will marry Miss Forrest, and after that— well, all seems hope less.' ' . , 'It shall not be hopeless,' I said. 'If he is alive he shall be found, and I will bring him back, and she shall see him.' 'Ah, yes; and that reminds me, Justin, she bade me tell you j that she would be in her own home at Kensington until after the next new year.' ' ?? This made me joyful in spite of everything. She still had an interest in me; she still be . lieved me innocent ' 'By the way, Tom,' I said, after another short silence, 'have you found out anything in relation to the ghost which appeared here during my visit?' 'Nothing definite. Stay, I forgot Simon Slowden said he had something particular to ^fell you when you came, to Yorkshire again. *1 asked him the subject of this 'something \- particular,' and he said it was about the ghost. I tried to 'make him explain further, but could not', ? 'I'll see Simon at once,' I said. 'I cannot, afford to let anything pass without examining it. Any little thing might give a clue to the mystery.' I sought Simon in the stable-yard, and t ' found him as grim and platonic as ever. 'Glad to see yer honor,' said Simon hastily. 'I've made up my mind scores of times to write a letter, but I hev had sich bad luck wi' ?letters, feat I 'adn't the necessary quantity o' pluck, you know.' r ? 'Bad luck with your letters, Simon? How?' 2C 'Why,, yer see, .yer, honqr, after the doctor experimented on me by waccinating me agin' small-pox, cholera, and the measles, together wi' 'oopin' cough and several other baby com plaints as 'ev a hinjurious effect upon people -as 'ev cut their- wisdom teeth, you know as I told yer honor that I caught that 'ere werry disease of small-pox which epiled my beauty for ever. Well, as I told yer months ago, I went to the housemaid for a mite o' comfort, and catches 'er a-eourtin' wi' the coachman. So I goes 'ome, and I says I'll write 'er a let ter as would charm a dead'duck in a sauce pan. So I begins my letter this yer way: 'My dearest dear,' I says, 'times es bad, and people be glad to catch anything; so I, think in' small-pox better than nothin', catched that. Forgive me, and I'll never do so no more. Tm cryin' all the day, as though I got my livin' wi* ekinnin' onions. Relieve me, my dear, or my feelin's will be too much for me. They be fillin' me faster'n I can dispose of 'em; and if you don't leave that 'ere coach man and smile on me, I shall either go up like a balloon, or else there'll be a case of combustion.' Iv went on in that 'ere style, yer know, thinkin' she'd melt like a h'yster in a fryin'-pan, but she didn't; and the next thing I hears wus that the coachman wur at the wiUag'e alehouse readin' my letter. Siiee then I've, guv up the tender passion and guv up writin' letters.' ? .?? ' 'Well, you hav.e had bad luck, Simon; but perhaps you'll,. be more fortunate next time Mr. Temple tells me you have something to tell me about the ghost What~is.it?' 'You ain't a-seen that 'ere ihinndel willain since he went away from 'ere, Mr. Blake, have 'ee?' / ? 'I saw him in , Hyde Park hne day, but have never spoken to; him.' - 'Well, I'm in a fogi' . . ? 'In a fog! How?' 'Why, I can't understand a bit. why that 'ere ghost wur a got up.' \ 'You think it was got up, then?' 'Certain of it, yer honor.' 'Well, tell us about it' 'Well, sur, after you left all of a hurry like, we had a big party in the house, and all the eeryants 'ad to *elp; and no sooner did I git hi that 'ere house than I beglnned to put two and two together, and then I see a hindi widual that I beginned-to think wur mighty like that 'ere ghost:' r - 'And who was that?'! :???.- 'Why, thatlere jbartctent: wirguv Miss'Stag-. gles.'

'And why did you not tell Mr. Temple?' ' 'Well, Mr. Blake, he didn't know anything 'bout her evenin' rambles wi' that 'ere hinfidel willain, and wasn't acquainted wi' the things that you and me hev talked about; besides; 1 thought as 'ow you wer the one that ought to ?know first of all.' .1 thought long over Simon's words, but could not understand them. Why should Miss Staggles pose as a. ghost even at. the in stigation of Voltaire? There could be nothing gained by, it, and yet I was sure that ft -was not without, meaning. ... Somehow it was con nected with Voltaire's scheme: of that I was sure, but at the time my mind was too con fused to see how. . So far, not one step had been taken to prove whether Kaffar was. dead or alive, and al though I knew nothing .of- a .detective's busi ness, I did not like taking any one into my confidence. I resolved to do all that was to be done myself. : In spite of everything, I spent a pleasant evening at Temple HalL We talked and laughed gaily, especially as Tom was prepar ing for his Wedding with Miss Edith Gray, and when I told Mrs. Temple how Tom had pop ped the question on the landing at midnight, after the appearance of the famous hall ghost, the merriment knew no bounds. ' ' ' It was after midnight when I retired to rest, but I could not sleep. I could hot help thinking about this great problem #f my life. How could I find Kaffar? How could I tell whether he were alive or dead? After toss ing about a long time, I hit upon a plan of action, and then my mind had some little rest - The next morning I bade good-bye to my friends, and started for the station. When I arrived all was quiet Not a single passen ger was there, while the two porters were lolling lazily around, enjoying the warmth of the bright May «un. I asked to see the station-master; he was not at the station. Then I made inquiries for the booking-clerk, who presently made his ap pearance. I found that there was a train leaving about midnight, which travelled northward, one that had been running some yeans. 'Were you at the booking-office on the day after New Year's Day?' I asked. 'Yes, sur.' 'Do you remember a man coming for a ticket that night who struck you as peculiar?' 'What kind of a man, sir?' 'A foreigner. Small, dark, and wiry, speaking with an accent something like this,' I said, trying to imitate Kaffar. 'No, sir, I don't remember such a person. There were only three passengers that night —I remember it very well, because my bro ther was here with me— and they were all Yorkshire.' 'This midnight train is a stopping train?' 'Yes, sir. It stops at every station from I/eeds. ' 'How far is the nearest station hi the Leeds direction?' 'Seven miles, sir. The population is rather thin here, sir. It gets thicker the closer you get to Leeds.' 'And how far the other way?' 'Only a matter of three miles northward, .sir. There's a little village there, sir, has sprung up because of Lotd ? 's mansion, sir, and^the company has put up a station.' 'A°,d ?now far is the next station beyond 'A long way, sh-. It's a junction where some go to catch the night express to iJeeds. It must be eight miles, further on. The train is now due, sir, that goes there.' 'And it «tops at the next station?' 'Oh, yes, sir.' I booked immediately for it, and in a few minutes arrived there. It was, if possible, more quiet than the one from which I had just come; a more dreary place one could not well see, I soon found the man who had issued tic kets on the night I have mentioned. Did he remember such a passenger as I described? ^'Yes, sir,' he said- 'I do remember such a chap; partly because he was the only passen ger, and partly because he looked so strange He looked as if he'd been fightin', and yet he was quite sober. He was a funny chap sir one as I shudd'n like much to do wi'.' ' 'Arid where did he book .for?' 'Dingledale, Junction, sir.' -? . 'And . he . would be able to catch a tram from there?' ,;; '}3e would have to wait a -quarter of an hpurtfprrthB^fexpress. to Leeds,' replied the, man. . ? ?;?..: : ?- . . . ? ? ^'And how long will -it be before there's ano ther tram tol?ingleaale Junction?' I asked anxiously, ??.-'?-. -:; ; - ? 'Three houijs and a-lialf, 'sir.' This was an; awful blow to me.« To wait ;all this tmie'^,''i]^tVlxA4side'''Bta.tidii was weary work, *speeiall^sas i-l ^ could do nothing I found, however, that' I ?coUld^hire a horee and trap thafejwould- take line there in about two hours. I theref oje closed^with this offer aad shortly after drove r«wayi-:.ri' I felt sure T .had made one istep forward Kaffar was alive. The.^lunt Yorkshireman'a description of him ? tallied exactfy with the real appearance of the Egyptian. Of course I was not sure, out this was strongly Sn favor of Ms being alive. There 'was something tan- gible for which to work, now, and iny heart grew lighter. ' Oingledale Junction proved to Tie rather a busy - place. There w.ere two -platforms in the.jstationi and h. /refreshment ^ooin. I found .also that Mr.' Smith wsie' SefuaJSty represented there, in the shape of a small boy, ^i dozen novels, and a few newspapers. This, . howV ever, did not augur so7 well for my Inquiries. The officials here Tfrould'iiot be so likely to notice any. particular passenger. Still there was someQitag In ihy^avbr.- Kaffar would in any circumstances attract atten^on in a conn try place. His appejaranee was so remark able, that any countryman would stop for a second look at him. \' .

Still I thought the balance would be heaviest on the side of his returning to Egypt I naturally thought he would return to his native land, .because I had heard him say he talked none of the European languages besides English and a. smattering of Turkish. My next step, therefore, was to return to: London; and then go to Dover, Calais, New haven, and Dieppe, to try to see whether Kaffar could be traced. At the same time, I determined to have a watch set upon Voi talre,* and his .every step dogged, so that, if he held any communication with Kaffar, ne cessary steps might be taken to prove to Miss Forrest my innocence, and thus she might at; once be freed from the designs of the man she hated. No sooner did I arrive in London, however, and took possession of my -easy-chair than. I knew Voltaire wanted me to go to him, and I knew, too, that a month before I should have had to yield to the power lie possessed. I need not say that I did not gor My will Was now stronger than his, and by exercising that will I was able to resist him. Still, none but those who have been under such a spell can imagine what a struggle I had even then. God only gives, us power to use, and He will not do for us what we can do for ourselves. For two long- hours I felt this strange influence, and then it ceased. Evi dently he had' failed in his design, and, for the tune, at all events, had abandoned it Next morning, when I was preparing to visit Scotland Yard, a servant came into my room bearing a card on a tray, I took it and read, 'Herod Voltaire.' ' 'Show him up,' I said to the servant. (To be continued.)
