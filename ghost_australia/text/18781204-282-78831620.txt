A Ghost near Maitland Correspondent of Newcastle Herald A SENSATIONAL story comes from Four-. Mile Creek. One of the supernatural has been paying nocturnal visits in the vicinity, and if all said is true, the nightly visitantâ€”whether of the spirit world or some one of the number of those in the flesh, playing up some pranks, -- has been the cause of frighten- ing a gentleman belonging to a party of surveyors now engaged in that neighbourhood in such a manner that he has been very ill, and under the care of a medical man ever since. The event mentioned happened about a week of ten days ago. The ghost was said to appear near an old coal or saw-pit. Two gentlemen of the party alluded to one might resolved to solve the mystery; accordingly at a late hour of the night, they set out, armed with axes, on their expedition. In due time something white of a curious shape, about a man's height, made its appearance before them. One of them advanced to it, got up quite close, struck at it, and it then instantly vanished down the saw-pit. In a short time it appeared again--this time right between the two men. It was again struck at by one of the men with an axe; it again disappeared, and one of the men then fainted from fear, and as stated above, has been ill ever since. This is how the story goes. It is stated that a party of police are going out to investi- gate the matter. Something or somebody has been the means of causing a serious illness, and how the affair will end remains yet to be seen.
