I 1. ..'..'...' i 'i .M!,; "av character like Hamlet ia a work of supreme diffi ' oulty and labour. An actor says he has. studied a part when he has committed it to memory. Sup pose an idea of spoiling a line by pronouncing it in defiance of emphasis and arobroology ocours to him he considered himself inventor of a new reading. The same idea presents itself to him' if he stamps twice where a predecessor was wont to stamp once. But the real student, after years bestowed in sur yeying a part indifferent aspeots, knows he is yet is yet far from comprehending it. He knows; more- over, that if at the end of a life spent in loving and arduous pursuit of his profession, he has mastered half-a-dozen Shaksperean characters and made thom his own, ho hos done well. Since the world began there never was an actor who could perform respect- ably the feat to which Mr. Montgomery challenges th** attention of London. A' dozen' charaoters of the poetical drama represent all in which the greatest actors have been seen at their best. : Hamlet is the part t. frith which Mr. 'Montgomery has commenced and is i obviously that on-which he challenges criticism.' : That his performance of this character ia improved since he was last seen in it in London, and that,'. : compared'with representations by living actors, it is' : more than respectable may at onco hs conceded. "We cannot admit, however, that it throws any light upon the character, that it reveals the' nature of the man, or is in any sonso .the Hamlet' of our ideal, concep- tion.' Mûre paina heve, apparently; been taken I to: give what aro considered now readings' than to i' illustrate '-'the character"' as : 1 it ' is traditionally handed dswn. Our chiof objéotión' is that the 'alterations that -have 'hoon '.made aie in'fact trivial, and that" the idea on which they are .based is erroneous. 'In giving a species of realism to many of the situations the beauty and 'dignity of tho oharaoter are forfeited. We see a fairly well- bphavëd man placed in conditions of considerable'difficalty.; ¡but tue Hamlet of Shakapere, prince, soldier, scholar, statesman, we do not soe.' Mr! Montgomery appears indeed, to have limited himself to presenting an agreeable Hamlet. He has troubled; himself little about the psychological depths of his nature, but has shown him worthy in bearing and polished iii manners. So far as this' goes it ÍB well enough, and we find muon- for which to bo thankful in' the tem- perance and; moderation of the early scenes But' the behaviour is that of a noble, not of a prince, and the-kingly 'side of the/ character is' never evoked, To ' take an instance or two. The manner in; which his friends aró ' -hidden' ba'ok,; who' would follow Hamlet when he yields obedience to the' Ghost's summons, is'not" that likely to have been' adopted1 by" Hamlet were.i'he ¡mastor' of his faculties; and is assuredly still less appropriate when we think of, the possession in' which all his'faculties must-have, been bound. His treatment of Ophelia' also is too prosaic. '"We soe an attempt tp 'supply'a motivo for aotion and language which tho poet un- doubtedly -left 'inexplicable.' Nothing, indeed,' in the performance ;'is," to our thinking, more iriconsis^' tent with'the charaoter bf Hamlet than'that he should, before asking Ophelia where ber'father is,' .peep behind'a curtain to see if he is in hiding.. To .pry at all in such a manner is unworthy of n prince' and is altogether inconceivable'in the case bf a man, like Hamlet.' It is an instance of that over-emphasis and over-explanation which, to our thinking, is;the most prosaic of all maaners of treating the charao- ter. ? On the "finer-issues" of Hamlet's nature .we do not dwell, but maintain that, acoepting Mr.' Montgomery's own estimate, such actions ; as aro exhibited are wanting in dignity and propriety.
