I fancy those who have backed the son of Grand Flaneur for the VATC event will all going well get a man for then money Strughtfire s form is certainly as good as anything shown by a Caulfield Cup candidate up to date The little horse is in great buckle just now, and his trainer may find it hard to keep him in form but all the same one must greatly respect his chance He carried 8st 10lb in the August Handicap on Saturday, and, including a 5lb penalty, he will only have to put up 7st 3lb at Caulfield He is a genuine stayer, and this weight will be a treat luxury for him. After looking all over a winner in the August Handicap at Flemington on Satin daily, Mon men finished very feeble and he is apparently not a is little Mischief, who divided him and Stmghtfire as the frost was passed, ran better than she has or some time past She had, however, a nice weight The Cup candidate St David was in the field, but he had not been long enough in work to give him a chance, a damaged hock ret u ding his preparation He always was a handsome colt and on Saturday he was certainly one of the finest looking horses on the course Homespun made his reappearance in this race, and shaped well enough to show that he has by no means lost his form Each two-year-old race in this season in Victoria has brought out a fresh winner which is somewhat of a relief after past experience with Meg Rain, over Silui day's Minnet was 1 assassin who owned the colours of Mr P Russell, one of the new V H C committeemen She is a racing like daughter of Neckersgat and Perhaps the latter a full sister to Guess work She showed a nice dash of pace, and won comfortably, though if Good Shot had not run so green early in the race the finish would have been much more interesting Portasst is, so far, the most expensive two year old to win in the colony She cost CO guineas Good Shot is a very fine filly, as good looking as anything that has been seen out this season, and she is cut trim, with a bit of luck, to was in a race for Mr Purdie's before long On the track Good Shot has done some fast gallops, on the strength of which she was heavily backed on Saturday With Poitassi out of the win the race would have been a gift to her Pen Mot ran up to her Moonee Valley form, but Malwa and Embleton did not show to advantage this time Horses earthing the Messrs Miller's colours have now had 37 times without scoring a win Such an experience is unprecedented in connection with the Mill Park stable, at least in recent Years The stable is clean out of form, and cannot even win a small suburban lace Backers who are accustomed to follow the red and white livery console themselves with the reflection that things must change soon They may, but at the same time it must be admitted that the Messrs Miller have at the present time a poor lot of horses in training, and until Griffin and Bundook get into form, or some of the two year olds come on, there does not appear, with the present material, to be a chance of Songs improv ing that is to any appreciable extent The stable lost one of its -members on Saturday Artist thing to run through the second last hurdle and breaking his leg, Mr Allan afterwards destroying him Like Helios, Dart, and one or two other horses that went into the Messrs Miller's hands, after showing good or promising form mother stables, Artist proved a most disappointing wear or of the red and while jacket, not landing n lace after leaving T Wilson's Dowling Forest stable Artist was by King of the Ping from Picture, and his best performance was winning the Hurdle Race at the last Flemington Autumn Meeting Though Bev erley only won the Flat Race at Flemington on Saturday by half a head, it was a fairly easy win, as he had the measure of the field during the whole of the last two furlongs The race afforded an interesting comparison between the Ans tralian and English styles of riding S Thomas, who had the mount on BOY ci lei, I kept as still as a mouse until a few strides from the post when he moved on his horse, and just but died off Emon na Ixnuck A Brown, the recently arrived English jockey, was on 1 mon nee Killick, and he rode with his arms and legs vigorously at work all the way up the straight Secttrttv won again at Adelaide on Saturday, giving weight away to all his opponents this time As the son of Padlock cut out the half mile in 51sec, he must be a pretty slippery customers There were a couple of good dividends at the meeting, which seems to have been very successful Black Flag s essay over the big jumps was not encouraging, as he refused early in the race for the Grand National The winner, All Pom's started a good favourite The Messrs Miller are out of luck with their own horses, but their cast oils are
