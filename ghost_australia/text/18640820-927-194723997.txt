? WOUNDED FAWNS. '-..??:. (From the Saturday Beview). In his last story, Mr. Trollope has nnder taken.to; paint the sorrows of A'youne lady whose lover has jUted her. £be is called' m' ' Wounded Fawn,' and the name f ery aptly describes both the extent and nature of her sufferings. She feels wounded to tlie heart by the evU that has come upon her, and she .also feels the 'smart of little tilings— the annovance of, jceoemng uitjr, and the shame of such uubli city-as she 'has' acquired in Tier little circle. The picture is a vivid, anil, we should imagine, a trueBnc, find the interest of ihe' story lies, to a. large extent, in this description of. a suffer ing girl. ' Siie is Otherwise an 'ordinary amiable creature, but when a'greai1 misfortune wrings her eool, it is toundliiat she 'can suffer. Her misery docs not 'exliale'in/ exclamations, or melt away, in tears. She endure? bravely, tries to bear up, wishes to do her' 4»ty, and even mttke* -a yain efibrt to 'be cheerful.

As ordinary people feel slightly and .shrink from feeling more strongly than they are wont, a jilted girl is* often willing to dry no her tears as soon, as slie is convinced, that she Is not ' ridicnlous. Comfort is the medium by which afilicted people regain the footing in daily life which they are longing to 'regain. Deep feeling is an ideal tb'which the world knows that it ought to aspire ; and, in real life, feeling may be,, to a great extent, cultivated, and, so far as' it can be cultivated, without insincerity, it is of the ntmost gain to cultivate it By reflection — by thinking over all the goodness and sweetness, all the long suffering end nobleness and gentleness, of those who are so dear to us — by tnrning an open car to the calls of reverential and solemn 'emotion, by expressing feeling in slight actions, nnd by controlling words that would torn the opportunity of feeling- away, there can he no doubt that depth of fi-i Hug inay be cultivated, , and that to cultivate it is o.'c of the greatest 'gei'S to humanity. But it will not do to go too far. Common -sense will not bear too violent a strain, and there is a bad and foolish cultivation of feeling as well as a good. — Common sense cannot cease to be common ?sense becanse it sees that there is a depth of feeling- beyond its reach ; and common sense discovers that in a ' large portion of deep feeling there is something exaggerated and, to a great extent, absurd. 'Wounded Fawns* ore not apt to be pert-oily -wise. A 'girl may think that, because a lover who has deserted her used to kiss her to tlieir mutual satisfaction, sue is bound to him for ever ; but the truth is, she is hot 'bound. The facts of life are one way, and her feelings and opinions and assumptions are the other; The ? novelist paints her with this exaggeration, .for he sets himself to ; paint a .giil with deep feeling, and exaggeration and djUy^fenlinit^jo.'MtnfHy, jthoBBhamttinTJtri. ably, .together. Bnt ordinaiy people are;not novelists. Then liare not to describe or realise a particular phase or passion, bnt themselves to be of one character or another — to do this or that particular thing. ? When their common sense shows them the .exaggeration : that goes with deep feeling, they cannot shut tiieir eyes to it; or if they do, they are. sure to' pay the heavy penalty ; of becoming sentimental ; for sentunentalism is Aothmg but .tfio aspiration — sometimes honest, sometunes, consciously insin cere—of ordinaiy common Bense people to have feelings deeper than they possess. In particu lar states of society,: like that which' prevailed in Europe at. the end of the eighteenth century, it became a fashion to 'provoke and foster this play of Gham feeling ; and the feeling which is thus stimulated by an excitement pervading large masses of people is not hollow or impo tent at first Sentimentalism may easily quicken sensibility. But common sense and the lower nature of man soon quench any feel ing that is not profound, and society grows sick of being sentimental. A time comes when even tbe ghost of feeling has departed, and nothing remains but sentimental talk, and a flux of foolish words. The sooner common sense sweeps away this .remnant the better.
