SELECTED POETRY. GRANNY. " Sing to me, childie darling, Or some soft music play ; I dream by the window, darling, Watching the dying day. Granny has grown so weary, My tired old eyes are dim ; Shadows creep in from the garden, But sunbeams thro' them swim. " Sing to me, childie darling, In vague, sweet minor lays The tender tone of the music Bring the dream of other days, And the sweet ghost-world of memory Is stirred by the plaintive strain. Old thoughts, I deemed forgotten, Come back to my heart again. " The deep full hours of sunset, Solemnly, slowly pass ; I hear the chirping of crickets, . Muffled in moistening grass. The sough of leaves in the lightwoods, Out in the darkening space ;— Shadows ! come in from the garden, And rest on my tired old face ! " Sing to me, childie darling, Granny is worn and grey; My life is low as the light-tide That ebbs from the shores of day. My wrinkled hands are folded, And closed my faded eyes;— Sing to me, child beloved, While the stars glow thro' the skies. " 0 childio childio ! singing In deep, soft husky hours. The dews slip into the lilies, Wooing the scent from the flowers. Music, mysterious, tender, Filling the peaceful place !— O shadow, come from the garden, And rest on my tired old face !" —From Poems by Jennings Carmichael, (Meville, Mullin and Slade, Melbourne.)
