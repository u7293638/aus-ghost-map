On tbe last day of Ibis month a registered letter was delivered to her, bom which •he drew three crisp five-dollar bills and a not- . from Hnlford, staling that he would soon send a friend to take potf* e&ion; of the rosm. Bet when this and se»eral mops months passedi without other sign or representative of Hullorti* than the regnkar lcttero inclosing tbe bills, tbe cental of the upper chamber became a sensation. At last, however, one wnv Iteeember af tesnrwn a little old man appown, rripgug from Halfotd a note which stated nil wish that His. Prowitt would place in his row.
