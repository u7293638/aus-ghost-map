Pr0Dably from jfP'^^ Rahu, and, anxious '!» only to escape from the vengeance of the Dutch, had connived at my ruin. Naturally, my first and only consuming thought was one of revenge, and if it had not been for the restraining influence of that wonderful priest I would at once have choked the life out of Bancroft. But I feigned to listen to his exhortations not to stain my hands with his blood, and I know now that it has given me a surer and more lingering vengeance. The unhappy Raka found a friend in the priest, who promised to see that she would be cared for at his station; but before we left that accursed spot where first I learnt that I was an outcast leper, she came to me and told me some thing ere she bade me good-bye, something that you will not believe; but you will; befoKe you re turn from No. 14 Island. She told me of a charm, a spell, one practised amongst her people, by which one could bring the soul of another under his sway before and after deatE: Without believing at the time, I grasped eagerly at what promised, in however wiid a way, to satisfy the desire for some abnormal form of vengeance which madly posse- ccd me. Prom her I learnt the heathenish rites which gave me a power over Bancrc/t, during life as I know, and new, from what you have told me, during death also. When we finally got to Queensland, I told him that he must hide himself from the vengeance of the Dutch Government, though he stood in no real danger from its power. Therefore, I advised that we took an island on the Barrier, and started fishing. Goodness knqws, I, too, had cause enough to hide myself from 'my fellow men. So we cams to No. 14 Island, and got some Binghis from the mainland and started fishing for biche-de-mcr. and I lea him a life of torture from that out. I was in hopes that he would catch tha leprosy from me, but he did not, and as my disease got worse, I had to make up my mind to bring things to a climax. I sent the blacks away; then one night I told Bancroft that I was going to toard a steamer going up to Thursday Island, and we would put off and get in her track. Now, Bancroft always had a horror of drowning, and when we got well away from the island I forced him over board, and told him to swim behind till he was tired, and then I would pick him up again. He swam behind, calling out to me in terror now and again, until at last, when I heard him getting faint, I hailed him- and told him that when h& died he should pass his time in vainly swimming off to passing boats and being taken on board, but it would avail him nothing, for my curse would com pel him to jump overboard again and swim back to the island. And he is doing it, and I shall die happy, as happy as I was when I heard his last choking cry.' This was practically the end of Vantroop's letter, beyond directions for finding the pearls and what to do with them when realised on. This was a nice sort of legacy to leave a man,, to search over a ghost-haunted islet for some pearls which might, after all, be only the mad creation of a leper. However, it suited me to go, and, after returning to Cooktown, I leased a lugger, got an old friend to accompany me, and, with a couple of kanakas and an old Malay,- started for No. 14. We reached there, and rigged up a camp, and that night the old- Malay came and asked who the white man was walking -about the island.' I told him I knew nothing about any white man, and he retired, vowing something in his native tongue which did not sound like a blessing. However, he could not do much harm to a ghost, and by to-morrow I hoped to be away. Before dark I had noted down the spot where we had to look for the pearls, which were enclos ed in a box much too big for them; and after tea my friend and I took a spade and lantern, and went to dig them up. 'There's the old eerang sitting on the very place,' said Rental, as we approached. But it was not the old serang, and as we approached the figure glided away in a very uncannie fashion. While we were digging up the box, which was there right enough, although I scarcely expected to find it, it flitted around us; but as it did not approach us, it did not disturb our labors, and we got safely back to camp with the box, but I swear that I heard a sound of wailing and sob bing as we left the spot. Next morning it was a dead calm, and one of | the hottest days I think I ever experienced, even in the torrid north. The sea had not a ripple on it, and the sky was without a cloud. We could not start, and had to spend the day on that oven of a place. Towards dusk a wind came up, and we made a start. Just as the sails were drawing, and the boat was getting way on, we all heard a cry, and in the dim light saw a figure dashing along the reef, through the shallow wa ter, to overtake us. 'Don't let him on board! He no man!' screamed the old Malay, but the next minute the thing was alongside, and had scrambled on board. It was dark, but a lantern had been lit, and we could see that the thing that had boarded us had the eemblance of a man, and I knew it must be the 'extra hand.' ? Then a horrible thing happened. The old Ma lay, with the 'amok' fire in his eyes, threw him self on the stranger, and they fought together until they both went over the low side of the lugger. And they never came up again. I delivered the pearls all right, but I heard from the doctor at Thursday Island that Van troop, the leper, had committed suicide, and, as near as I could make out, it was about the very time we were leaving No. 14. I suppose Van troop's death took the spell off the other fellow, and he was able to drown in peace.
