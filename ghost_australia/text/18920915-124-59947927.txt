Mr. Whitelaw estimates that there is enough gold in the U.T. Flat, Alexandra, to pay off the whole of the National Debt of Victoria.

A quartz-bearing reef has been discovered on Mr. Robertson's property, Wandong, near the Sunday Creek.

Large bodies of quartz have been met with in some of the prospect ing shafts, some of the stone showing good samples of gold.
