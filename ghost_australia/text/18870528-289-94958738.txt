(Homsyoribma. (For other Correspondence tee page 19.) THE YANYARRIE GHOST. TO THE EDITOR. Sir— In this day's issue of the Advertiser appears a letter upon the above subject from a correspondent signing himself ' Fred Wood bury,' casting grave doubts upon the state ments forwarded to you by your Gradock correspondent relative thereto.- I have read tnese statements, as well as tnose from tbe pen of M.C. Shegog, and can from my own per sonal observation confirm the statements given by your Cradock correspondent, as similar manifestations have been observed here at Black Rock, where the child Schnltze is now staying since the 17th with Mr. Rodeghiero, whither she was taken by her father in conse quence of the reluctance of both Mr. and Mrs, Hamdorf to keep the child any longer at their place. From what I myself witnessed on hut Saturday night, although unaccountable to me, I fear Mr. Shegog in giving the report attri nited to him must have drawn considerably on his imagination, and in furnishing such a report without good grounds for bo doing he has been the means of casting crave doubts upon the statements made by Mr. Hamdorf and confirmed by several disinterested persona. As your correspondent 'Fred Woodbury' is so sceptical about these manifestations, I have Mr.Rodeghiero's permission to ask Mm to come and examine the singular phenomenon for him self, and if he succeeds in unravelling the mystery and prove any fraud in connection with the affair he will hand Mr. Woodford a cheque for £5, or to any other person who can give a satisfactory solution of the matter. It has been a source of great annoyance to the whole family, and as Mr. Rodeghiero or the child's father are deriving no pecuniary benefit whatever I fail to see how they can be accused of practising any fraud, or for what purpose unless for gain, which is not the case. — I ain, &c;, A. HEALY. Black Rock, May 24, 1887.
