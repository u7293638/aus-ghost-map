BENEFITS OF SLEEPING IN TENTS. A CONTRIrnTOR to the Vegetarian has been describing the delights and bene fits of camping out in tents, and in the course of his account he esays:-The first night's sleep is broken. By the eecond night the forces of nature com bine to make for sleep, and even though it thundered and lightened over so, the inhabitants sloop soundly on. It is always so in camp. When I was a volunteer in the Oxford Uni versity Corps years ago we used to spend the first night in Colonel Mor roll's Park in singing and music and tale-telling and practical joking. No body could sleep. In spite of all the bugles of" last post" and the warning cries of sentries, "lights out," the camp was full of 'noise till late into morning hours, but the next night an enemy could have wiped out the battalion; it was a camp of the dead. The only sound to be hoard was the regular snoring of those whom nothing would wake till morning. I have been speoially pleased to find that not only is tent life conducive to sound sleep in the normally healthy, but that it has a direct curative effect in bad cases of insomnia. A lady who had scarcely slept at all for several weeks, and who had tried all sorts of reme dies, opium included, and was begin. ning to look like a wearied ghost, came to me, and I sent her out to sloop in a tent under the trees. After the first night she obtained sloop, and after the second or third night she oven felt dreadfully sleepy during the day. She bravely refrained, however, from giving way until night, and always got up at 6 a.m., with the re sult that the sleeplessnoeo has gone, and she gets good long nights of rest in spite of the noises of nature. The delights of the open-air sleeping in a tent are so fascinating that I begin to wonder why the whole world does not turn out of bricks and morter during the summer, and go under canvas.
