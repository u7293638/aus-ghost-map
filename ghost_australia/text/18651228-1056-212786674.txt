ORIGINAL POETRY. THE RACE HORSE AND THE HORSE RACE. AN ALLEGORY. Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? The glory of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength.—JOB, Chap. 39, verses 20th and 21st. The sun rose in splendour, the mists of the morning Curld'd like wreaths, the proud brows of the moun- tains adorning; The river ran murmuring along as by force— A streak of bright silver that bordered the course; The fish all swam high, such a morning to share, And they leaped in their ecstacy into the air; The tents all are pitched, like snow-huts on the green, And, goodsooth! to my heart 'tis a picturesque scene; In the plain afar off see tho multitude blending Their way to the course—the "convincing-ground wending; What crowds of youths, what crowds of girls— While younger ones at home are sighing— What dashing tandems—four in hands— What music playing—ribbons flying From all thy plains Australia, From thy homesteads far and near, Streamed forth to see man's best friend run The great race of the year. But one was a colt of such promise and beauty, Whom to worship a Pagan had deemed it a duty; Such a horse as Caligula never had sold, But fed him on pearls, from a manger of gold; His forehead was noble, his eye like a deer, With that flexible, narrow, long, thin, mule-like ear; His shoulders oblique, his chest not too wide To impede the quick brilliant strike of his stride; His quarters were lengthy, his hue golden bay, And it changed with each change of the sun's changing ray; His hock was a study—large, angular, clean, And his back was as mighty as ever hath been; His nostrils were terrible, trembling with flame, Like a beautiful woman's, when threatened with shame; Indignant of wrong, of a proud modest mien, When the tears are suppressed, such a woman I've seen— Such a horse as would makee any man a horse lover, In short, he was Panic, Sam Blackwell's all over; Odds-takers all stared, joy beamed in each face, But bis owner declared he was scratched for the race; The saddling bell rung—the jocks are arrayed In black, red, and white, blue with white stripes, and plaid, And the hues of all flowers o'er the wide world that bloom, From the top to the toe in full jockey costume; And rearing, curvetting, dancing up to the post, Give to me that old horse that walks slow through the host; Now see you, yon Jock, who winks quick and looks knowing, Barabbas, the publican, alias -------, Insolvency's outlaw—the Back Creek Levanter, The Bankruptcy Sweepstakes he won in a canter; Thus ran his farewell—dear friends, when I'm gone You'll remember the horse that I rode "Dies Non," 'Tis not the first stake of the like sort he won; Since Creditor, distanced, pulled up sadly done, And Detective, the fly horse, close up to him run; And this, too, I know, for he was in the race, That the long-winded Capias could not gain a place, Though he was a lawyer of quality staying, The devil an inch would he go without paying; And Flatcatcher, 'mong the first flight for two mile, Though Anthony Green propped his legs for awhile, Broke down on the course, but he went in good style; And Done-brown, the fleetest and best of his year, Who broke down in running against the Wild Deer, As game as a game cock that never knew fear, Came to grief in a mile, and was pulled up dead lame, Though he outpaced them all in his zenith of fame; And Thimble- rig, known on the turf as a queer one, Who, oft to the novice has proved such a dear one; Sheriff, who at Auction Stakes always won gold, His backers declared was most terribly sold, And Bailiff, who never had breeding to lend, Was soon all abroad, with "bellows to mend," And Jailer, and Turnkey, who strove hard to win, Notorious for letting and keeping "legs" in, Played the Bull 'mongst the China, with no time to spare, But after two miles they pulled up in despair; And Cracksman, who never in large affairs trusted, But his backers returned, sore, sick, and disgusted, Though strange it may seem, when he looked most a winner You suddenly found you were done like a dinner: The public all thought that something was rum in it, The judges declared that the rider was gumming it, Neither stewards, nor judges, nor in nor outsider, Could ever sheet home a clear case 'gainst the rider; But I'm of opinion (I hate a loud blower) That Cracksman, although not a brilliant goer, In Botany Bay idiom, and this assever— Both rider and owner were certainly clever. There was Bushranger, Merrymaid, Funny Girl, Shingler, With Vagabond (son of Cain), Bolter, and Swindler, Also, a Premier's son, sent to keep metre in, Dam by old Emigrant, grand-dam by Peter Finn, This was good breeding Australians all know, But he had China legs—still he could go; And Fine-drawn, who always looked stiff as a post, If horses had souls, you had sworn t'was a ghost, With his dull sunken eye, tucked up flank, and hard breath, Seemed galloping fast on the racecourse of death: There was Eye- opencr, lately imported from Sydney, And Sharper and Nipper—all of the same kidney, Artilleryman too, and old Cannon Ball, And Moreton Bay Shark, greatest rogue of them all. The mob were tailed off, and far, far away, Some cantered, some limped, and some walked on their way; And brutes clothed as men, steel and whalebone were plying, As if for the victory still they were trying. 'Dies Non' led the way, and he gallantly went On honour, and glory, and victory bent; Approaching the distance, 'tween three led the race, And the bright sward was trembling, so hard was the pace, With toes slightly out, and each horse well in hand, The set-to commenced as they neared the Grand Stand; Such a classical picture drew smiles from all eyes As they gazed in the glow of a gladdened surprise: Such artistical jockeyship seldom is seen— Some thought that Detective was rather too green; But his nerves were of steel, and to make the time shorter, He hung like a bull-dog dead on to his quarter, And gamely he strove off Detective to shake Who shot as the lightniug shoots forth from the cloud, And cut like an arrow his way through the crowd, Who came with the rush at the critical moment And went to the neck of his plucky opponent; But the old horse was there, with life's wine on the lees, And broken the first virgin bloom of his knees; Though the cheering was great and the crowd thronged a host, He rallied and struggled bang up to the post, With his large eye of fire, his nostrils all wide, He sprang to the whip at the very last stride; For I saw the race (see Bell's Life) 'tis said Barnabas slipped 'Dies Non' in a long head, And one shout rent the air—ran like fire o'er the sward, "Dies Non! Dies Non! he's a trump, by the Lord!" SHEPHERD. Talgai, December, 1865.
