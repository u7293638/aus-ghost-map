Rode a Race With Deatfo NIBUPOBT'S ORDEAL. " I saw a pale horse and his rider^was Death." says St. John, in Revelations,, and some such spectacle was presented in the first contest of Le Prix Zimmerman at the Seine track^ 'on Sunday, April 25, reveailng the heartleBsness of management and public^ Nieuport had ridden a lively heat in the opening handicap, and in the big race had had a hard fight with Taylor in his heat, and another' fierce struggle with Lambrecht in the semi-final. He seemed ito be in distress when be went off to prepare for the final. Time went by, and the crowd grew impatient. Word came from the riders' quarters that Nieuport had an attack of cardiac syncope,, or heart failure. More impatience/ no sympathy. Finally Nieuport came out for the start in thie final. He was pale as moonlight, aj^d his face was-set in lines in ^aiiu Not an expression of sympathy from the benches; just a big bitez of expectancy, made more intense by the knowledge that the heart of one of the two waB affected, and that he might actually drop dead. Then they would get their money's worth, sure enough. Piette, his opponent in the final, ha$ no mercy on his. ghastly adversary, and dashed into the last lap at a fearful pace. It looked like an easy -win, but I heard'Nieuport gasp out to his pacer "Plus vite" (faster), and his almost glassy eyes flashed out again as the .Fbsisier team carried hitii ahead. It was a lap seldom equalled in Paris racing history. There was no suspicion of a loaf. It wa,s reeled o£E at a speed of 60 kilometres fen hour,' 10 more tbtip Tom Linton made in his world's record ride last fall ; but still the ghost bent over hiB handles, never let up. GAMK TO THE LAST. As his white face" swurtg into the straight, the grand-stand arose, some , of them equally pale as the thought of seeing a real death. at the tape. But Nieuport lasted longer than th6v thought, or wished,' perhaps, though only , his moving legs, showed he w&& aiive as he crossed the line, for not'even victory had raised a flush to relieve'thie pallor of hip face, fixed in. tbe rigidity of death." , All knew he, couldn't-last lonj( with that look. The collapse came as soon a¥ he slowed up turn, apdi got off. The blbpd, released, from bict ! legs, rushed back upon the overt-strained heart, and Nieuport y^nt down «lth such a look as Corbejbt inhst h^ve, faift^jtfyt: CSarson Oity. .His c'oniirades jpicke^^iijii ; up and carried him off t<> a doctor, while the crowd filed out; happy that it had got, all it paid for, «ud little mqrt'., i For^a lopg WhUe the ^octffl: woj^^ oyer the gritty rider be|pr« he qbf^du^t the heart to working again. \\\fheh'he j . was restored the pfc^eicjjah t61d'.ffim jf nari-owly be Had escaped deatL Th|l; man's stamina ougl^t t^igiVe' the. lie ^' . the statement, often heard; that the French are o^teri quitters field.
