To some persons who had previously ,« taken exception to the article Mr. Scotthad.it ' . eeema, explained that it was written for a religious , : journal. This, the American actor thought, was ? simply an aggravation of the offence. Why, he : asked, should Mr. Scott picture the stage in a worse light in a religions journal than he would -??; if he were writing in a theatrical one ? -?-' Mr. Jefierson characterised the article as illogical ;''' and contradictory, and stated that his observation of V the creenroom caused him to dissent from Mr. Scotf s I. opinion that it was a dangerous place. 'If, when Mr. .'v Scott says greenroom, he alludes to the wineroom of -7''JJtho London music hall,' said Mr. Jefferson, ' he may ' ^possibly be correct, but if he would so scandalise the -./ greenroom of the Lyceum Theatre, managed by Sir : Henry Irving, or those of the theatres under the ? management of Mr. Hare and Mr. and Mrs. Kendal, I : should fancy he makes a very grave error. The green -r room is an institution that has existed for bnndreds of ' years, and possibly there have been instances ofimpro ?* priety in tee greenroom of the theatre, but they have v= . elso occurred in the drawing-room of society and in the v ? clmrcn itselL Our profession is so public that the evil ' ; tliat is done stands bo in the electric iisrht of public gaze that nothing good or ill connected with the stage can be concealed.'

A young man named Ford, employed in a wild ??:?' beast show in England, was recently the victim ;': of his own temerity. Ford was in the buildings where the lions and elephants were kept.

On, Collier, the elephant man, going into ins building he saw Ford in the cage, and told him to«omeout. Ford replied, 'Wait a bit till I make them show as the tamer does.' No sooner had* he said this than one of the lions seized the r poor fellow by the head and inflicted such dreadful injuries that he died next day. r Becently^at the Winter Garden, Berlin, English and American variety artists were very largely ? represented. . ?; For the Paris Exhibition of 2900 a theatrical . . - . section has been appointed, for which a president \- has been elected in the person of M.
