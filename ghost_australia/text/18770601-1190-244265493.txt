Theatre Royal sir unmpicr appeared last evening as Nnicissc Raman, and met with a most enthusiastic reception, being called before the curtain at the end of each act, heartily applauded as lie mado lus various poults, ana vociferously cheered at the conclusion of the drama. There wns a very excellent attend ance. Mr Dampier's Narcissc has not previously been seen in Melbourne, but after one pciformancc, it is plentifully apparent that it is not only n carefully and well studied conception, but at times rcnches to a point of pronounced excellence. The declamatory passages wero well done, Mr Dampicr happily hitting tbo medium, and while folly conveying intensity of feeling, mnnaging to avoid that abomioation of tbo drama, etsgo rant. It may be said that these paBsngcs could have been made quito intcnec, and yet not loft open oven to the suspicion of ' robustiousness ;" but in that cse6 Mr Dampier would havo to some- what alter hiB wbolo conception of tho character, or rather of tho proper manner of its representation, and tho question is whether that would be any decided improve ment. For the present, it is sufficient to recognise the fact that Mr Dampier's Nar- cissc is a careful and intelligent exposition of tbo character. Of the other characters it is not necessary to say more than that Miss Dcey Stewart was a hotter Doris Qninault than her best friends might have expected ; that Miss Georgo, as Pompadour, was some what disappointing ; that Mr Hollowny certainly acquitted himself in a highly creditable manner as the Due do Cboiseul, and that Mr Applcton had littlo to do as the Comto da Barri, und did it with his usual care. Tho others do not onll for remark, An amuBing farce, A Ghost in spite of Him self, with Messrs Hollowny, Gfovills, Taylor, and Dcorwyn in tho principal parts, con cluded the entertainment, which will bo re pented this evening.
