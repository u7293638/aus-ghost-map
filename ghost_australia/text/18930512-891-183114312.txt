Reciprocity Treaty. We beg pardon for treating so great a theme in only a few words; biit reciprocity treaties are ghosts which are- raised and have to be " laid" periodically. It is now a long time, however, since Victoria raised the ghost of free transit over the border between her and New South Wales. When the facts were examined, they were found to be curiously in favour of the proposer. What is iu the wind this time? The wooden horse of federation is put "up again. Look inside of him before you draw him into the city. He con tains armed men who will sack the city. For if free border may be allowed, why not free coast traffio ? Victoria is so modest in all these things, so generous, so neighbourly. She always has a little to give and ever so much to take. Nevertheless, being in friendly mood we say, by all means let us have free trade over the borders if it at all approximates to a fair thing all round, for levying duties as at present is a great nuisance, and small benefit.
