Wallaby Drivo. A HIALF-noA's wallaby drive came off at Upper Foroest, the' estate of M]esrs. M?illor Brothors, on Saturday last, which was veory suacessful, about sixteen shooters and] twenty drivers taking part. About one o'clook a start was made for the hhnting ground, and after having some good sport until about six o'clook all hands returned to the homesteid, whore a sumptuous ropastrhwaitod them. After tea th tallies were made up, and it was found that 65 of the " varmints " had given up the ghost (if they have any), the top scorer being that gallant sportsman, J. Yeadon, with 9 to his credit. Following him wore-A. Grubb, 8; J. Cooper and Frank Stein, 6 each; and then somosmaller scores. Of course the customary ohcering took place when the result was made known; and when that was over Mr. J. Miller told those present that they could dance away as much as they lilked until twelvo o'clock, and take my word for it woe did dance. I fancy the young ladies were quite glad to hear the clock strike twelve. Of course opinions differed as to who was belle, but in my opinion the belleship lay between two sisters from Goulburn dressed be comingly in black, with the darker of the two for my preference. As far as I am concerned, I never enjoyed myself better in my longelife. Rory O'More.
