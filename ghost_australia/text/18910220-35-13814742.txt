On his approach a beautiful young lady stepped forth, and presented him with a drinking hour and a pipe, requesting him to drink the fairy king's health and to blow in the pipe He took the born and pipe, but at the same moment spurred his horse and galloped quick as lightning back to mansion, and, regardless of the throats and cries of his fairy pursuers, delivered both born and pipe into the ends of his mistress The fairies, It is and promised prosperity and clothes to her race if she would restore the pipe and home, but she refused to give them up, and they are still preserved at Llungby as memorials of this supernatural Christmas event But the same lomond adds that the fal h ful servant died three days afterwards and his horse on the second day The lady, too, did not escape with impunity for the mansion has been the ice burnt, and the family have never prospered since the fatal day Many similar tales are told on the Continent and Mr. T Thorpe, in his " North German Mythology " tells us that on the wall of Vox top Church, in be and, there is a painting represent- ing a certain knight, named Herve blf.
