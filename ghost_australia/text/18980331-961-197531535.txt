A GREAT Cti-OPERATIVE ..'......,...,, MOVEMENT THE BROTHERHOOD TRUST. A Realisable Dream. Both 'Individualists arid Socialists agree tbat m co-operation lies the solvent of many, if not most-social evils. But frequent failure has disheartened ' most who have sought this clue from the den of the monster of competition. / Distributive co-operation has- liad some success,, but has hitherto tended to degenerate into a competitive , co-opery * tion tainted with most of the old evils. r Profit-sharing, is still in the experi mental stage, and is shadowed by a ghost, whom we may call Loss -sharing.

But there is an English movement, s recently started, founded on Labour Exchange lines, which certainly appears to deserve more consideration than has yet been given to it in, Australian ., Labour circles. , !: ;?? ' I allude to the 'Brotherhood Trust,' the object of which is to ' build a ' city of Reiuge' from the tyranny of Mam inon, by banding together in ? ? * a gigantic Co-operative Society ' true sisters and brothers, -who shall eventually produce for each other and entirely free them selves from the present competitive feystem.' There is a branch of the Trust in Prahran, Melbourne. I don't know of any publication which 'better, illustrates the possibilities of beneficial co-operation than the pamph let which I propose to publish from y/eek to week in this page, dealing with ,' the methods and proposed procedure of the- Brotherhood Trust. The pamphlet is called ' Preparing for the Twentieth Century,' and is by J. Bruce Wallace, M.A. It may be obtained from ' The ^Brotherhood Press, 28 Clerken well road, London, E.G.' ?
