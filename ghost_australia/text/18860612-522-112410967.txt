The Degradation of the N. S. W. Assembly. [Extuact from leading article in the Sydney Bul letin.] The reconil main cause of tho degradation of the Assembly is " the operation of sectarian bigotry and old-world religious hatred." Tho maintenance of the old feud of some of our fanatical ancestors if responsible for the election and re-election of sonic of tho most insignificant and unworthy members. There are constituencies in the colony for which no Protestant can be returned, and there arc others where it would be useless for a Romanist to venture. The candidate of the dominant religion will succeed m hucU electorate*:, although his utter unfitness for mÂ«inbersliip may bo plainly demon strable. Firm belief in the Kiamu Ghost, and en - thusiastiu admiration of Edith O'Gormun and similar deities, is generally crcditod with tho milking of such members as Mr. Hanson, Colonel Holbor* row, Dr. Wilkinson, and Dr. Renwick. Wo nso the word "mombers" advisedly, for nothing short of regeneration could transform them into capable politicians. Of the representatives of Holy Water, it must be admitted that their creed docs senm to have utterly beroft them of brains, nnd, in conse qnenco of this fact, they compare favourably with many of tho moil wlio liavo been elected in this colony bocause a Dutch King camo over to England to assist with a rebellion 200 years ago. As wo liavo previously pointod out, the overthrow of Orange and Green influonce will bo effected by tho spread of education. Ignorance and bigotry, tho unlovely twin-sisters, will make their exit togothor ; 'he Bturdy and enlightened intellect of tho rising generation will burst tho bonds of fanaticism, and cherish instead that true religion which is forgotten ia the hoat of sectarian warfare. The Kiaraa Ghost will vanish before tho white light of knowledge, and a main causo of tho present, degradation of tho Assembly will oeaso to operate whon that historical apparition finally disappears.
