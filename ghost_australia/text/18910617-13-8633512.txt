IRISH AUSTRALIANS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,-In your leading article to day the following sentence occurs -' It has been pointed out that among a very large section of the Australian Catholics the one standard and motive e of morality is fear Your own motto "I am in the place where I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth encourages me to hope that you will accept from me an explanation of one word, wherein the pith and marrow the sum and substance of the whole question in dispute are comprised shall try to give you, as well as I am able, the standard traditional teaching of Catholic theologians on the sub- jector fear All theologians make a broad fundamental distinction between servile fear and filial fear The first is mere pure fear, the fear of punishment as such the fear of the lower animals the fear which the dog has of the lash, or the bird in of the scourge The second is the reverential fear which the child has of his father, the subject of his sovereign, the citizen of the law, the intelligent man of legitimate, authority This is the fear which St Paul inculcates in his 13th chapter to the Romans, where he writes - For princes are not a terror to the good work but to the evil Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ' 1 or he is God's minister to thee for good But if thou do that which is evil, fear, for he beareth not the sword in I am This enables us to understand the generic difference between the one fear and the other. The first is seen by animal, and therefore has no moral value, no meritorious worth, no social sanction or appreciation It is only used to tame and restrain the brute The second is founded on intellectual apprehension and intelligent love The child tears his father because he knows his obliga- tion to honour and obey, because he recognises the no of the father to inflict salutary chastisement, when it may be pain fully necessary. lins primary instinct of human nature is beautiful], can we ed in the idea of kissing the rod which inflicts the pain The child developed into the man the citizen, the subject, extends this final fear to all his social relations He accepts, obeys, and even enacts laws to regulate all the relations of society, and to ensure their obser- vance gives them the necessary force and sanction by attaching punishment to their violation A community without laws, prohibitive and punitive, would be soon reduced to primitive barbarism We should again have the home subalterns of Lucretius In good sooth the highly civilised state of modern society renders the concep- tion of such a state of nature practically impossible We must not forget that this highly civilised, cultivated, elevated state of society owes its progressive existence to the restraints and repressions of w wise legislation and wholesome fear Now, this is precisely the kind, and the only kind of fear which the Catholic Church teaches her children She teaches them for instance, not to fear but to " fear God In her standard general catechism, taught in all our schools, she instructs the children that amongst the seven gifts of the ' Holy Ghost the last in order is not fear, but " the fear of the Lord in her books of devotion she places before the eyes of her subjects "the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord She teaches them to pray "Pierce O Lord my flesh with 1 by fear for I am afraid of Thy judgments Please to observe ' thy fear and Jlij judgments 'The distinguishing feature of filial fear is running throughout all the facts and prayers connected with this motive of moral conduct In our catechism the fear of hell and the loss of heaven are set down as motives of screamed helps to repentance and justification Jins would seem to countenance the imputation of servile fear But, like to many other things which are not properly or fully understood by those who are not of the household of the faith, this is made easy and intelligible by proper explanation It is laid down, as a primary general principle of our theology that us am essen really consists of a regression of going away from God, so, converse!., repentance and renovation must essentially include a return to God , or, in other words, repentance must be sorrow, based on the loss of God, which thus includes regret, not for the mere consequences or punishment of sin, but because these consequences include the loss of God 'the truly repentant sinner will fear hell, or regret the loss of Heaven, principally because they entail the loss of God 'The lost child will sorrow for having forfeited the happy home of his "Father in Heaven lue further loss of plan to himself may and ought to affect his natural sensibility and thus help to produce the supernatural sorrow which is indispensably necessary Ihm qualification is entirely borne out by the v army of St. Peter in his epistle which I have so often urged myself while instructing those in my charge "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God We have here the motive of little fear, as we have had throughout the living God, our Father in Heaven is kept before us as the principal subject of our sin-, and therefore the principal object of our loss Now for the life of me, I cannot. see any thing degrading or saccaline or enslaving in this if in no true that there is a God and that man is his creature and therefore responsible to that God who made him and that this creature is left in the hands of his own counsel free to act to obey, or to offend and that therefore he must be prepared to accept the consequences it follows from the very essence and nature and object of all law human and I dream that remedy and punishments must exist and must be adequate to tin let whctheutraii} do good or evil Hence it follows that there must be a bell as well lit. a heaven The one is the counterpart of the other and in spite of all the false philosophers ancient and modern ]. epicurean Hedonistic or Atheistic the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the want of it insane, destructive folly -I am Vic P J.
