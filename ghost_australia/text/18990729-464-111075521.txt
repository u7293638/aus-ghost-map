MNEMOS1THE. ? * ? (For the Freeman.) I gazed into a maiden's starry eyes, And drank therefrom such draughts o£ love divine That my brain reeled, and earth and sea and skies Swam round, as though I had drunk deep of wine; And all the gladsome world seemed full of bliss As our lips clung together in a kiss. Oh, memory of an hour too swiftly flown, Dost thou now meet me in the barren 3 oars, When my waste heart with tares is overgrown, And gaze upon me through a mist of tears, Yet with a tender pity in thine eyes That to mine own doth make the teardrops rise? And wilt thou seek me in the after-life, Thus gaze into mine eyes and touch my lips, When, after this novitiate of strife, I pass to brighter day thro' death's eclipse ? And shall I meet thee face to face again Where memory will no longer be a pain ? Thou canst not answer— thou art but a shade, A soulless thing, that out of hollow eyne Looks at me like the ghost of that fair maid Whose true heart answered every throb of mine,. And wanting whose response, this life has grown A weary burthen I would fain lie down. GEORGE GARNET. Randwick, July 3.
