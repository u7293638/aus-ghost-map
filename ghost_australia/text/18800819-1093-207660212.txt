' A little rain has fallen. , "Residents of the qniet township of Bosaville, near Mount Gamble?, have,"8ays the Siuth'Eastern Star ef August 17," been startled _ during the past week by the nightly appearance of a ghost. The nocturnal visitor assumed the form of a young girl, draped in what appeared to be a white shroud. Children were frightened, and a few older heads,believing that the departed ere allowed to revisit the. ear th', were fearful that some crime had been perpetrated, and that the embodied spirit of the victim was permitted to haunt the vicinity. Others of a more prac tical turn of mind looked npon the matter as a hoax, and one resident'who bad no faith in supernatural visitation decided to te?t whether . it was a spirit 'doomed for a certain term to walk the night, and for the day confined to fast in fires,' or some resident of the neighborhood playing a practical ioke. On Friday night he therefore laid in wait, and when the nootaraai: visitant appeared made a dash forward, and' found that his arms ehoircled the form of a young girl, daughter of a neighbor, who .was en veloped in a sheet, instead of a disembodied spirit. The practical joker was conveyed home and cautioned against repcatingher folly." a
