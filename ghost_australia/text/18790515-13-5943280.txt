THURSDAY, MAY 15, 1879. The trade of these colonies with the mother country has assumed dimensions of such magnitude, and the conduct of it is necessarily based to so large an extent upon mutual trust and confidence, as to render it more than ever essential that a high standard of commercial ethics should be set up, and faithfully adhered to by merchants on both sides of the world. And _ our mercantile readers in England will learn with some degree of satisfaction that the subject was one to which con- siderable prominence was given by the retiring president of the Mel bourne Chamber of Commerce in his address to that body on the 29 th ult. Reviewing the events of the year, Mr. DAVID MOOKE congratulated his fellow members on the vigilant attention which the Chamber continued to pay to all matters affecting trade and commerce ; and although ho was obliged to admit that the colony was passing through a period of considerable depression, owing to adverse circumstances abroad and political and economic troubles at home, yet he indicated, on the other hand, that we have many reasons for hopefulness and confidence ; inasmuch as the na- tural resources of the country are very great indeed ; the energetic habits and enterprising spirit of its inhabitants are undeniable ; and it is not to be sup- posed that any British community will tolerate for any lengthened period the rule of demagogues and the ascendancy of men conspicuous chiefly for rashness of speech, inexperience, and unwisdom. All popular delusions aro short-lived ; and the more violent their mani- festations, the more speedily do they exhaust themselves, and bring about a condition of languor and reaction. Our prosperity may receive and has received a serious check, and our pro gross may be arrested, but the most mischievous of politicians enjoy but a brief tenure of powpr "They have " their dav, and cease to bo," but m the mean time spring time and harv est sue cecd each othei with their accustomed regularity, til o soil LS found to be moic and moic abundant in nuneul tiexsuics, .ut, science, and industry, continuo then iimestmg work, and while the men who make themselves most notable bj their clamours on the platform and ni Paihament, pass away aftei enjoy mg au ephemeral notonety, and ¡ne completely forgotten, capital and hbom aro patiently pursuing their bencfiffnt opciations, and wo mike the discovery that the flies upon the wheel aie aftei all of much less unpoi tance than they imagined, and that the community has advanced m spite of them And, speak ing on behalf of the business men of Melbourne, tho e\ President of the Chambei of Commeico bays "I "know them too well to believe "that then spirit and entcipnso will " not use supcnor to all pieacnt diihcul " ties, if wo ne only permitted to cany " on the busmen of the colony quietly, " and without any uncalled for and pel " mcious embroilments, which can only "piovo disastious to oin ti ado and " cicdit, and a great hindiauco to our ' gen ci al prospeuty ' Lut, as Mi Moori' also took occasion to lemnik, it is indispensable to the soundness and security of commerce, whether internal or external, that it should be " conducted on stiaight " forward and honest principles " And he indicated cortain evils which demand the application of a prompt andefhcacious îemedy ' W e muBt (said he) set our facea agamat that pernicious BJ stem which has too long prevailed of suffering firms and individuals to carry on business for jcara without capital, and with the full knowledge that they have not twenty shillings m the pound to meet their liabilities I altogether dissent from the doctrine that it is justifiable or praiseworthy for a man, discovering a den ciency m his assets, to continue under the sanguine hope that he may retrieve, too often resulting in the further depreciation of his estate. At Bvtrh a "tate, it 13 his duty to submit his affairs to his creditors and to take their direction, instead of which, as we hav e too fatally experienced during the past j ear, firms, long hopelesslj bankrupt, conceal their position and eventually, when denied further banking accommodation, call their creditors together And what is, then, their demeanour' Instead of meeting those upon whom in all instances, the) have entailed heavj losses with becoming regret thej sub mit neatlj drawn statements of accountants and before rigid examination of their mode of trading has been made propose

feeling, but the majority carelessly and cul pablj nidifièrent to thi» maintenance of proper and honourable trading 'W e do not know that tho tone of commercial morality, is lovvei in Victoria than it

essayed to carry out steam com munication with Australia, it would Lave been well, if any new venture was tobe made, to withhold congratulations until the event justified them, but we are still to be in the hands of the P and O Company, whose régulai and punctual delivery of the mails has partaken of the marvellous, and not a doubt of their ability to carey out the contract to the letter can be enter tamed The success of the P and O Com pany in obtaining the contract is the moro crediwMo to them because they worked again», t difficulties Minister» have never n'ade any concealment of their

accident, and with out a late mail delivery worth calling attention to, and this remarkable success was achieved, we aro told, "not by " chance, but by the most careful supei " v lsion, and particularly by di\ ldmg " the work which each steamer has had " to peifoun " iSuch piactical considen tions as these set aside the sentimental reasons uif,ed in fivour of the "one " boat theorj,

that in the smooth waters of Colombo Haibour the transhipment will be leheved of all personal mconv emence In one other respect, the commercial public is to be congratulated upon the îesult, inasmuch as the service now arranged foi interferes with innato enterpiise in the Australian shipping trade as little as possible A special vvoik is done by a special agencv, and the geneial tiaflic ísleftto its ow n healthy development A brisk competition is now pioceeding for the canning tia Je to and fiom Australia, and owneis of steamships are working out foi them selves the problem as to the most piofit able vessel to be employed Eveiy trade has its special requirements, which can only be met by careful evpeument, and as îegaids the Austiahan tiade, these experiments are now ni active progiess Each ycai of late bos wit nessed an improvement, and by the last mail the agents of one of the lines had particulars of the commencement of a new vessel, which will embody the ex penence acquired by her owner» Oui niteiest is to encourage this competition, and not to discountenance it by giving an enormous subsidy to some particular line, which might then be disposed to stand still The new arrangement whichsecuie3 us the best possible postal service-tho one object to be secured-leaves the carrjuig tiade fieo, and, now that owneis are relieved from the fear of state mteifeience with their business, we may expect them to exhibit îeiiewed vigour, and we may hope that the stndes made m the past will be moie than equalled in the futuie If tho Government would now go on to in stitute a scheme of assisted lmmigiatiou, in the benefits of which all the lines might share, the satisfaction we have already expressed would be complete Hie Ballarat Mining Boaid decided unanimous!}, at its meeting on Monday last, that the Government should bo asked to appropriate the sum of .£100,000 to restore the mining »' dustry of the colony to its old pro spenty The mover of tins motion, Mr RICHARDS, urged that the real difficulty was a want of sufficient capital, and ho seemed to think that if the Government would invest tho money, a very profitable state of affairs would bo brought about It was also urged that the minors had paid special taxes, for which they had got nothing m return, BO that they had nvciy good claim on tho Government for assistance Obviously, the two arguments aro not required , foi, if the investment is to leave a largo piofit, as stated somewhat loftily, th it is buflicient to justify tho .expenditure Hie other argument applies alike to tho farmers and the minéis, for both aie ta\ed foi the benefit of the factories, ind both ought to receive assistance, if the plea bo a valid one As a matter of fact, the selectors can nial o out quite as good -n case as the miners, and they can pie id \a\\\ addition that they aro under the pro etion of the Ministei of Lands, who lias taken such good care of thom til it they are all but ruined through his solici tude on their behalf 'N o think, theref01 e, that the second plea must bo set asido, tinco all classes s ivo one luve p nd taxes from which they get no benefit, and if an inquiry is opened in this direction, it will leid to some veiy Btaillmg results, the least startling of which will bo the oppression of the inmeis Ihe whole question, so fai as it is likely to be entertained at all, must turn upon tho point as to whethoi Government prospecting is likely to do any good, and whether thue really is tint dearth of capital which js sud to bo tho cause of the fulling oil m the yield of gold We aie asked to believe, in f let, by the Ballant Mining Poaid precisely what the Secretary for Mines in New South Wales asks us to behove of that colony, that liiere aro a numbei of good things into which enterpuso will not gobe cause they aro so veiy good Hie whole case seems to us to bo based on a mistake, both as to the duty of the Government, its power to help the miners, and the dearth of capital We aie quite sure that any Government vkich undertakes either to work mines or to largely assist thoso who aro pie pared to work them, is simply laying itself out to waste the money of the people From the ordinary protec tionist point of view, there is no reason why a Government should not próvido capital for tho miners as well as sudsidies to the manufacturéis, but both aro morely taking money from one lot of people to give it to another, only the mining case is even a vvoise one than that of the manufacturer The latter does take the risk of his business , ho only gets paid when he has actually produced and sold tho articles which he manufac turcs, whereas tho mmei asks the Go \ eminent to find tho money and take all the nsk of its being leproductive The same objection holds good in regnd to giving assistance to mines actually at vroik, or to parties which are prospecting All the i isk is taken by the Government befoic the gold is produced, and thebiisi ness is carried on_ i icticallyattheGovein ment s cost, w lthout the Government hav ing any leal control over the operitions In pi ospectmg the G ov ei nment, of course, finds tile money and the piospectors spend it, profitably 01 otherwise, is the case may be, md the Government is asked to pay before anything LS pi O duccd, 01 befoie it is known that theio is any thing worth pioducing Hie case is thus far more rotten than tint of the protectionists, who only vv ant to be paid a bonus on what they pi oduce at then own risk, and if it is unjust to tax the rest of the community to help them, suiely it is fal moie so to tax tho iv hole population on the chance tint prospecting may prove that theio is still aunferous giound to be worked, whilst the whole thing may end in no discovery at all of any value to the country But wo take exception to the state ment that there is a dearth of capital for nuning purjoses so long as theio aie good reasons to believe that the v entines aro legitimate On the con trary, there aie many si0ns that even tho depression of the times is not Buflicient to prevent investments in sound enterprises, as we had occasion to point out only the other day Wheievei theie aie reasonably good piospects, theic aro tho funds, as a nile, to test them, and wo do not know of a single company at the present timo which has a good " show ' th it is in want of money to go on with Pio specting is proceeding rapidly, and in the most legitimate manner At Kingston, for example, the diamond drill is hard at woik, putting down boies to test tho direction of the deep level which is known to exist, and as fast as the ground is proved, shafts aie begun The work is going on as fast as is desn able, and there can be no ques tion as to the important discoveries « Inch vv ill be made in that locality At Sebastopol thoro is a rush for quartz claims, whilst at Carisbrook, Mary boiough, Homebush, and other places tho woik is going hopefully on At Sandhuist and Stawell the woik is proceeding energetically, as the weekly total of the calls is quite sufficient to pi ove, and there cannot be a doubt that it vv ould not bo wise to rush into all sorts of enterprises with Government money, in the hope that tho results would be favourable The falling off in the yield of gold is inevitable, and was predicted many years ago We do not believe that it would be helped by the expenditure of the Govern mont money, whilst the money itself would most certainly be lost The caso does not seem to us to have been made out It is not true that legitimate enterprise is neglected, on the contrary, it is looked after m a most hopeful manner, and we are strongly of opinion that the best results are brought out when enterprise ia thus left to itself to solve its own problems, and look after its own interests We do not doubt that the miners would like to iavo such a sum as £100,000 spent on their particular industry, but we are unable to seo what the public would get in return, even if the money was not wasted on a senes of gigantic jobs under the supervision of the servde tools of the Ministry Mining enterprise is healthy, and if it is carried on honestly and faithfully, public confidence will be regained, and a considerable increase for a time m the yield of gold may be looked for Parliament waa further prorogued yester flay untd the 24th June It is not summoned to

Mr Joaeph Hill, on behalf of the salesmen, denied that any monopoly existed, as had been alleged, and stated that the chief causc of the high price of fish in Melbourne was the excessive freight charted by the railway department for carrying fish from Sale to Melbourne Mr Fitzgibbon, town clerk, stated that the market inspector had reported that during thelast 12 months not a single fish had been destroyed to keep up the prices, as was currcntly reported to be the practice Mr B G Davies M L A , who accompanied the deputation expressed his opinion that the freight was too inconsiderable to influence the price of the fish After some desultory conversation, in which the salesmen several times assured the secretary that there was no monopoly whatever Mr Labertouche said he would lay the representations of tho de putation with regard to freight before the Minister The Government has so far recognised the inquiry Messrs.Mason and Smyth ML A's are conducting into the state of the Gipps Land fish trade as to request Captain Payne to accompany those gentlemen on their visit to the Lakes.

the line of the latter for about l,000rt , and then curves off to the northward, so as to give greater protection to the bay Tho great ex pense of the work is owing to its extent, to the materials employ ed, and to tho combination of breakwater and wharf It certainly does not appear from this plan that the money ex pended on the breakwater has been " thrown awa),' as the first telegrams on the subject intimated On the contrary, Sir John Coode has used np a portion of the breakwater in his plan, and the rein ander will Borve as a support, so far as it goes, to his breakwater pier The minimum length of tho break- water pier contemplated by Sir John Coode is 1 200ft, at a cost-together with nther works-of £180 000 This, it may bo ob served, is double the length included in the abandoned contract for the breakwater, and would run into upwards of four fathoms, thus allow ing largo vessels to ho alongside, besides sheltering the baj If this length were constructed, it might bo found
