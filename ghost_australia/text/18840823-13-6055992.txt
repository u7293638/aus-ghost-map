MELBOURNE: ITS INFANCY AND GROWTH. IV. THE BOROUGH OF PORT MELBOURNE Was originally know as Liardet's Beach, and afterwards and for many years as Sandridge. Its present name was given to it quite re- cently. Until I860, when it was proclaimed a borough, it was the Macarthur Ward of the city of Melbourne. Perhaps if the separa- tion had not taken place, the Macarthur Ward might have been, now a much more prosperous place than the borough of Port Melbourne. Who can tell? Some little time ago a movement was started which had for its object the amal- gamation of Port and South Melbourne into one municipality, but it came to nothing. The proposal seemed to be more popular in South Melbourne than in the borough, which, it would seem, would sooner be re-united to the city of Melbourne than to its eastern neighbour. Liardet, after whom the present borough was first called, kept an hotel there in the very early times, and plied a ferry to and from Williamstown. In 1852 "Orion" Horne, in a letter to Charles Dickens described his first landing at Sand- ridge, and spoke of that locality as "wild bush, varied only by sandbanks and swamps, and by the appearance of a supposed bushranger, who watched all movements with equal distrust and preparation." Sandridge once had a great reputation for snakes. Immediately after the gold discoveries it began to grow into importance. Before then it was pretty well covered by ti-tree scrub and ferns. When early in the "fifties," the shipping began to rapidly increase, the Melbourne corporation found it necessary to "mend its ways" there. The road making system adopted was to remove the surface sand to a certain depth, cut down the ti-trees, bind them into fascines, place them in the excavation, and then cover them over with soil and stones. The removal of the scrub converted Sand- ridge into a Sahara, Port Melbourne was once a much busier and more important place than it is now. Soon after the gold discoveries hundreds of ships were lying at anchor in Hobson's Bay. Goods had to be lightered from the vessels to the beach or up the river, such work giving employment to great numbers of men. Mer- chants erected capacious warehouses and carried on business there. Land went up to fabulous prices very much beyond its pre- sent value. "Port Melbourne would then have been an eminently appropriate name for the place. But this wave of prosperity speedily subsided. The railway to Sand- ridge, the first line constructed in the colony, begun in 1853, was finished in 1854. This line was made by a company, and, although the land was given by the Government, the railway cost about £90,000 per mile, in con- sequence of the high price of labour in those days. That railway struck the first blow at the prosperity of Sandridge. The Yarra was also improved, and gradually made available for vessels of a larger and larger class. Sand- ridge has also suffered from fires. In 1854 there was a conflagration which destroyed the buildings on a considerable area. The destruction by fire of the Victoria Sugar Com- pany's works, at a more recent period, threw large number of men out of work, and what was left of the building has since been unused except for storage purposes. It is said, however, that the place is to be converted into a porter brewery. Bay street is the principal thoroughfare of this munici- pality. A pedestrian can generally saunter across it without incurring much risk of being run over. Their is a quietude about this street which is very soothing to everyone but the shopkeepers in it. Towards the bay or south end of the street one or two small groups of men, evidently connected with the shipping interests, may generally be seen hitching up their trousers or gazing at the offing through a telescope. If the vessel they are observing is seen to head for Williamstown, they solace themselves with a few expletives and probably a drink. A conspicuous building in this street is a large iron church (Church of England), which was imported and erected m 1855. On a fine Sunday afternoon, Port Melbourne is lively enough, owing to the influx of visitors from other parts of the metropolis. Not the least noticeable persons in the crowds on such days are young middies, who invariably look at least twice us nautical as their captains. However, Port Melbourne has evidently seen its worst, if not its best days. It is thriving, not so rapidly as South Melbourne but perceptibly. The following figures ob- tained from Mr Clark, who has held the posi- tion of town clerk there ever since the muni- cipality was created, are indicative of pro- gress :— ..............................| 1863 | 1873 | 1883 Dwellings ............| 1,027 | 1,600 | 2,019 Population ..........| 3,900 | 7,200 | 9,350 Annual valuation| £38,923 |£48,168 | £59,637 The place is filling out on both sides of Bay street. Near the South Melbourne boundary, particularly, population is in- creasing. There is a demand for dwelling houses in that direction suitable for working men. Population is beginning to overflow into Port Melbourne, not from the bay, as in the golden days of old, but from the east. The improvement of the Yarra diminished the prosperity of Port Melbourne; the same work, still being carried on, is sending the place ahead again. The widening, deepen- ing, and straightening of the river is being accompanied by the reclamation of the low lying lands of Port Melbourne and the raised lands are valuable for various purposes. Anyone looking at a man of the metropolis will see that the Sandridge Bend constitutes a great part of Port Melbourne.The area of this bend is over 1,000 acres. About half of it is a sandy waste, from which sand is being daily carted. Until recently, the sand drift- ing from the opened up surface was a great nuisance, but now that the carters have reached water level, the drift has decreased, as the sand is damp. Unless something is done soon to stop the mischief, much of the bend will degenerate into a swamp like that of West Melbourne. The corporation can do nothing except protest, the lands of the bend belonging to the Crown. The other, or northern half of the bend, is covered with ferns, with here and there a few patches of ti-tree. Anyone in quest of a little solitude ought to go to the bend on a Sunday. At a distance of only a mile and a half from the heart of this great metropolis one can there wander about on a Sunday perfectly alone and amidst the most profound silence. The work of cutting the Coode canal across the bend has been begun by a contractor under the Harbour Trust, and considerable progress has been made with it, but doubts are entertained as to whether the new channel will be finished in the contract time, which expires in the latter half of 1885. The deepest part of the cutting is about 22ft deep, and the formation revealed shows some 10ft of sand on the surface, then 10ft of rich black alluvial and marine deposit; and then 2ft of clay. It is a light, dry clay, the depth of which has not been ascertained, but it goes down lower than the intended bottom of the canal, which, at low water, is to be navigable for vessels draw- ing about 24ft. There is some talk of covering over the bend, excepting, of course, the canal track, with silt. No doubt that will be done in time, and the at present despised bend will be covered with buildings, and Port Melbourne will be one of the busiest suburbs of Melbourne. There are several large manufactories there already. The silt taken from the cutting is being deposited on the low Crown lands in its vicinity, under an arrangement between the trust and the Government, who are also taking for the same purpose large quantities of stuff raised from the river by the trust. The quantity of stuff to be removed from the canal track is 700,000 cubic yards, and it will all be used for filling up lands belonging to the Crown and the trust. In other parts of Port Melbourne there are factories of various kinds, including Government railway workshops, where about 100 men are employed, and Messrs Swal- low and Ariell's gigantic biscuit fac- tory. Port Melbourne evidently has a great industrial future before it. What old colonists are there who would not readily drink to "Prosperity to Port Melbourne"? Most of us who are not natives of the colony touched Australian soil for the first time at Sandridge. We landed there when we were much younger and more san- guine than we now are, and we intended to return to the old country in ten years,"at the very outside," with fortunes. But the return has been delayed decade after decade. Many of us would not care to go back now. The girl we left behind us has, perhaps, developed there into a portly matron, the mother of a dozen or so. Maybe she is a pallid ghost. The grey haired parents who remained be- hind, and whose love for us we never fully appreciated until we had left them, are doubtless dead, Our brothers and sisters are married. We have formed other ties. Per- haps we are bound to Victoria by dear links, whom we often astonish by tales of what Melbourne was like when we first saw it, and who in their turn will astonish their children in time to come by the stories that grand- father "used" to tell them. Any account of the growth of this metro- polis would be lamentably incomplete if it contained no special reference to the work of the Harbour Trust. Indeed, a much greater amount of information about that work than the writer proposes to give would be highly interesting and instructive. The trust was created to improve the port — in other words, to provide the greatest possible accommoda- tion for the shipping, so as to enable vessels to be loaded and discharged at the least pos- sible cost. That object cannot, of course, be carried out without benefiting exporters and importers, producers and consumers, through- out the colony. Melbourne is the chief port of Victoria, and the Melbourne Harbour Trust has recognised from the outset that one of its most imperative duties was to enable shipping to come up as close to the centre of Melbourne as possible. The harbour commissioners would have proved recreant to their trust had they sought to promote the interests of any small portion or portions of the metropolis at the expense of the colony generally. The revenue of the trust is not paid solely by dwellers in the metropolis. Out of the total income of the trust in 1882m namely, £177,798, £132,317 con- sisted of wharfage rates, which are really paid by the consumers throughout the colony. The trust has considered the improvement of the navigability of the Yarra to be its para- mount duty. That work is being carried on with diligence. It is intended to deepen the river to 26ft at low water up to the Custom- house. Year by year, as that work has been progressing the tonnage coming up the river to the Melbourne wharves has increased. The following table relates to the Melbourne wharves, and shows the results of the opera- tions of the trust so far as the improvement of the river is concerned. The number of brigs and smaller craft coming up the river is not given in the table, but their tonnage is com- prised in the tonnage given in the last column - MELBOURNE WHARVES \- | | | | | | | | \- | Imports| Exports| Ships| Barques| Steam| Register 1878 |550,368 | 208,773 | - | 127 | 1,856 | 635,330 1880 | 502,469 | 249,223| - | 87 | 2,079 | 725,804 1881 | 576,625 | 276,312 | 1 | 106 | 2,180 | 816,356 1882 | 611,356 | 283,840 | 4 | 124 | 2,174 | 864,123 1883 | 669,817 | 382,015 | - | 101 | 2,537 | 1,926,848 In the two next tables are given similar particulars as to the Sandridge and Williams-- town piers - SANDRIDGE | Imports | Exports | Ships | Barques | Steamers| Register \---- | Tons | Tons | | | 1878 | 90,647 | 90,971 | 104 | 174 | 154 | 300,013 1880 | 259,970 | 95,172 | 94 | 100 | 223| 384,841 1881 | 353,991 | 106,149 | 71 | 115 | 240 | 427,968 1882 | 384,176 | 83,617 | 94 | 76 | 150 | 366,028 1883 | 336,982 | 60,794| 75 | 83 | 77 | 298,048 WILLIAMSTOWN \------ | Imports| Exports| Ships | Barques| Steam| Register| 1878 | 118,109 | 36,999 | 60 | 64 | 74 | 199,813 1880 | 140,477 | 57,818 | 53 | 38 | 796 | 274,549 1881 | 179,509 | 59,782 | 59 | 18 | 623 | 279,826 1882 | 219,285 | 74,426 | 50 | 4 | 612 | 344,277 1883 | 209,752 | 67,210 | 38 | 6 | 681 | 496,772 From these tables it will be seen that the tonnage of vessels berthed at the Sandridge and Williamstown piers increased from 505,826 tons in 1878 to 794,820 in1883, whereas during the same period the tonnage at the Melbourne wharves increased from 635,330 tons to 1,020,848, the increase in the former case being 288,994, and in the latter 391,518 tons. But every year there are a few vessels that load and discharge in Hobson's Bay, and as their cargo is all lightered to Melbourne, and discharged at the wharves there, these vessels should be included in the Melbourne returns. That tonnage in 1883 was 99,048 tons, which, added to the tonnage at the Melbourne wharves in that year, makes the total Melbourne returns 1,125,896, or 331,076 tons more than the total of Sandridge and Williamstown. As the work of improving the Yarra proceeds, the shipping trade of Sandridge and Williamstown must diminish. To provide the requisite accommodation for the increased shipping coming and expected up the river the trust is building sheds on the north and south banks, lengthening the river wharves, and making new roads behind them. At the same time, it is by no means neglecting Sandridge and Williamstown. In the last published report of the trust (that for 1882) it was mentioned, inter alia, that the Sandridge town pier had been, and was to be still further extended; that during the year 476,830 cubic yards had been dredged at Sandridge and Williamstown, against 469,827 cubic yards dredged in the river, and that plans were being prepared for the improve- ment of the Sandridge lagoon. This latter work is now being carried out; when finished it will mitigate a great nuisance. It has been stated that at one time the price of land at Port Melbourne was much higher than it is now. The value of land there has fluctuated violently. At a Govern- ment auction sale in 1852, £700 was bid for a quarter acre allotment in Beach street, and the purchaser forfeited his deposit. In 1853 the Government sold the piece for £3,400. Before 1852 lands there fetched very small prices. At the last sales in 1850, 9½ acres were purchased for a total sum of £1,365. In 1851 4½ acres fetched altogether £959. These lands were in what turned out to be the best parts of the place. A year or two later quarter acre allotments in the same localities were worth up to £4,200. Before the gold discoveries some men bid £70 for four allot- ments in Rouse-street, and forfeited their deposits. These same allotments were sold in 1853 for £9,600, and are not worth as much now. Port Melbourne is improving itself, and is being improved. Its new town-hall cost about £7,000, and contains a free library. But much remains to be done in the way of drainage. There is some stagnant, vile smelling water near the Montague-street railway station and in other parts of the muni- cipality. Still, low-lying as Port Melbourne is, and great as have been the difficulties that the corporation has had to contend with in regard to drainage, the borough is not an unhealthy one. The local health officer, in his last report, states that the death rate for the previous year was 17.75 per 1,000, and that the average for the 10 years was 17.2 per 1,000.That is much below the average death rate of the whole metropolis. As to vital statistics, however, Port Melbourne prides itself on its birth rate. During the 10 years ending with 1880, the annual births per 1,000 of the population were 38.99 in Port Mel- bourne. Only one municipality scored higher, namely, Footscray, just across the river. The average of "Greater Melbourne" was only 33.50 per thousand during the same 10 years. Kew had the lowest birth rate during the 10 years in question, and singularly enough, the lowest death rate also. These be mys- teries. Hayter does not explain them. He simply gives the figures and then abruptly changes the subject. The Port Melbourne health officer, thinking apparently that any explanation was better than none, in one of his last reports say - "The high birth-rate is mainly due to the Intermarriage of persons of different races and nationalities at suit- able ages." In 1882, however, Brunswick had the highest birth-rate, overtopping even Footscray, and Port Melbourne only came third on the list. Still, even in 1882, the birth rate was higher in Port Melbourne than the average of the 10 years ending with 1880. According to the Port Melbourne health officer's theory, they must be more mixed at Footscray than in his own municipality, and still more mixed at Brunswick, while at Kew they must be pretty well all of one sort.
