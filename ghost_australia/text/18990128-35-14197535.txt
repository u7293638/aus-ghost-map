IME BISHOP OF BATHURST AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. TO THE, EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-As considerable interest is still taken by many of your readers in the controversy initiated by Cardinal Moran, I am induced to ask for the in- sertion of this letter as a supplement to my previous remarks on January 14, which I abbreviated as much as possible in order to make them more readable and likewise to bring the Cardinal face to face with his familiar " windmills," and let these without any obscuring " cloud of words " stand out clear and distinct in the light of ordinary common sense It was for this reason that I only brought one line of argument to I car upon his favourite plea that the unorthodox of some individuals within a Church destroys its power of teach- ing All I had to do was to show that what applied to the Church of England applied equally to the Church of Rome , but now, with your permission, I shall proceed a step further and adduce the highest authority for stating that " the whole of his argument based upon individual unorthodoxy is ab- surd" viz , the authority of Holy Scripture S Paul, writing to the Corinthians, speaks of " the Church of God which is at (Corinth," thus recognising its full authority, and yet in the same epistle he refers to certain unorthodox members of that Church " For there must be heretics among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you " Even if we give the mildest interpretation to the word " heresy " it is amply sufficient for our present argument and makes it perfectly clear that b Paul did not write in the same strain as the Roman cardinal. S Paul acknowledges the existences of heresies, and whilst he strongly condemns them throughout his various writings he does not unchurch a Church a unless that Church, as a Church, has formally accepted and approved of heresy Thus unless the Church of England has formally denied the divinity of our Blessed Lord-a thing which even the Cardinal, with all his romancing powers would not venture to assert the argument based upon individual unorthodoxy is not only absurd, but falls absolutely shattered to the ground Then we come to his quotation from St Cyprian which he so calmly appropriates to the Roman Church, v boreas St Cyprian's reference, judging from his actions and writings, was to the catholic, and not to the Roman Church only His actions have already, in the course of this controversy, been referred to, and therefore I only quote from his writings " There is one episcopate, a part of which is held by each (bishop) in joint tenure " (De unites, Ecc , c 5 ) " No one of us sets himself up as a Bishop of Bishops " (Speech of Council of Carthage ) " Undoubtedly the other apostles also were what S Power was endowed with, equal partnership both of honour and power " (Da unitat , Ecc , c 4 ) In Ep , 72, " Each prelate box in the administration of the Church the exercise of his free will, as he shall give an account of his conduct to the Lord " This is in accord with the principle laid down in canon 39 of the African code,-" The bishop of the first see (i em- any province shall not be called prince of priests or high priest or any such title, but simply bishop of the first sod " And so also we find in b Piraicleau (Ep and Cyp 74, 16),-" The power was given to the Apostles and to the bishops who being ordained into their places succeeded them To these quotationsImtghtadd the well-known one from St Jerome (ad join 26), "Christ founded the Church on all the Apostles, and all of them received the keys of the kingdom of heaven " from S Chrysostom, who (t vin, 11s) declares that " The Apostles were ecumenical i piers, all of them in common were entrusted with the whole world in and i S Basil, who thus writes, " Christ conferred on all pastors equal power with b Peter ' of feeding his stock " Our own Vea Bede, comment- ing on S John c xxi , says, " When our Lord says to a Peter, ' Thou art Peter, and upon this rock ' vic He signifies by b Peter the universal Church for the rock is not derived from S Pater (son a Petropetru), even as Christ is not derived from Christian, but the Christian is so called from Christ Therefore, because Peter had said Thou art the Christ,' Sec the Lord says, ' upon this rock I will build my Church, that is, upon this rock which thou hast confessed I will build my Church for the rock was Christ upon which foundation Peter himself is built, for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Christ " This subject may well as summed up in the words of a modern w liver, " When our Lord delegated to His Church the powers with which He was en doned, to be ministerially exercised, He entrusted the legislative and executive potestas not to one, but to all the apostles not to an individual, but to a body And this jurisdiction consequently passed on, not to one bishop, but to all the bishops Jurisdiction was discussed in the onus episcopate, not centralised in the nuns episcopate The governmental poisons is corporate, not individual, and the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit has always been true to her divine constitution Hence flowed synods, provincial national, patriarchal, ecumenical The daily choice lies between the Catholic and what has been aptly it somewhat inelegantly, termed the ' one man ' or Papal system, which latter, in w whatever grade of jurisdiction, is a flagrant violation of the divine charter of the Church to say nothing of the fact that necessarily and logically it demands infallibility in him who would thus, aside solus, exorcise the delegated jurisdiction of the Divine Head of the Church " The next point to which I would refer is the Cardinal's statement that the Archbishop of Canterbury made this avowal in his recent charge that "an orthodox Anglican is quite free to hold with Calvin in the belief in the real absence of our Saviour " The Cardinal should really be a little more careful in his assertions the habit of romancing is bad to got rid of especially as he assumes the office of teacher It is not my business to uphold Calvin, but " fair play is a jewel, and before the Cardinal said that Calvin believed his real absence" he should have looked into his writings In his Doctcna Domini Opuscula, p 133, we find these words " If we believe the truth of God we must believe that there is an inward substance of the Sacrament in the Lord's Supper joined to the outward signs and so that as the broad is given by the hands the body of Christ is also communicated that we may be par- takers of Him " That surely does not signify a " real absence, " and as to Hooker's words referred to by the Archbishop, they are the utterance of one very weary of the state of words, and anxious that the real subjective presence should not be lost sight of " What these elements are in themselves it skilleth not, it is sufficient for me which take them they are the Body and Blood of Christ." He also further wateR This bread hath in it more than the substance which our eyes behold " The fact is " The Body and Blood are in no way carnally and corporally presents of , after the manner of a body, physically, and according to the law s which govern a local and material presence-for the Body of Christ is present in a manner above sense and nature, by the power and working of God's Holy Spirit and for the highest PPintutU and." (Gibson, JJ,, 66 J,) But the Cat,. dinal goes on to inform us that a certain Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1382, did hold the doctrine of transubstantiation ? Well, and what of that stone did, after the Norman invasion, thrust certain doctrines and practices upon the Church of England. No one who knows anything of Church history questions this for a moment But the Cardinal draws an inference which, to say the least of it, is amusing when he points to Dr Temple patronising " as orthodox doctrine what was condemned by his predecessor in the see " No, after all, Cardinal Moran, when freed from the influence of the ghost of Henry VII!, does recognise Dr Courtenay in 1382 us the predecessor in that see " of Dr Temple, or, in other words, recognises Dr Temple as Dr Courtenay's successor but if we want to know what were the nil doctrines held by the Church of England we must go back in her history to those times when I Rome had not " got her by the throat," and what do we find there - In the 37th Canon of Alfnc (or Elf ric) m sir we read "That housed li Christ's body, not corporally but spiritually," and in one of his letters to his clergy Elfnc Putta, Metropolitan of York thus expresses himself The sacrifice of the Eucharist is not our Saviour's body in which He suffered for us, not His blood which He used upon our account, but it is made His body and His blood in a spiritual way, as the manna was which fell from the sky and the water which flowed from the rock This gathers all the more force when we know that this is supposed to be a translation from the Latin of a homily which had been long used in the Anglo- Saxon Church Thus the eminent Church of England in 657, and before that, taught Just what is taught in the Church of England in 1899 on this very important subject, whilst the doctrine of trans substantiation as at present held by the Church of Rome did not spring up in Western Europe much before the eleventh century, and was not formulated as a dogma until 1210 One of the greatest writers of the sixteenth century is in accord with Elfrio when he ia) s "We hold it as a most infallible | truth that Christ, as a man, is not every where pre- sent His human substance is naturally absent from the earth but that we sell is naturally absent He, being God, imparts in that blessed Eucharist in a supernatural and mystical manner really and truly through sacramental " and Bishop Costs, of Durham, so well known as a great authority-on liturgical revision, says " Though it be good catholic doctrine that priests receive power over the true body of Christ, and consecrate and offer it upon the altar in a true catholic sense, that is by consecrating the elements so that they may become sacrament ally the body and blood of Christ to us, and by making these a commemoration of that sacrifice which was but once offered up for us upon the cross, yet in the | sense of transubstantiation or a rea! sacrificing of Christ again for the quick and dead it is not so. This power there never was priest that had it but I Himself, nor shall have it to the world's end." All members of the Anglican Church must, if they accept the Book of Common Prayer in its entirety, believe in a real presence-" a presence," as the Archbishop of York says, " unique in its character and spiritual in its conditions to talk of a " real absence " to a thoughtful Anglican savours of absurdity The whole confusion and controversy. which has gathered about this deep mystery is caused by man seeking to define what is undesirable, to limit what is infinite, and to dare thus to dogmatise and to exclude all other views after a manner which has no sanction either from our blessed Lord or the Apostles Depend upon it the primitive Church was right " when it left the mystery of the Eucharist side by side with the mystery of the Incarnation, with a reminder that he who could explain the one might explain the other." Centuries have passed away since then The Church of Rome has grown older, but not wiser Whereas the Church of England, by going back to primitive practice and teaching, has proved her undoubted right to her position as a true branch of the Holy Catholic, and Apostolic Church Some day or other the Cardinal will realise, I trust, the force and power contained in the noble words of St. Augustine in his De Doctrina Christiana, who tells us that the good and true Christian will recognise as his master the truth wherever he may happen to find it I am, As CHARLES E.
