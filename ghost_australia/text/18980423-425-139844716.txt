Original Poetry. TEIE OLD DAYS. WHERE are all the old time swagmen, That I knew in days gone past; Have they started on that journey, That we all must take at last; Have they gone to meet the squatters Who have crossed the River Styx— To the land that has no pluera, Where there is no thought of ticks? Perhaps they're travelling on the rivers, Of that far and distant land; Or calling in for rations Off the ghost of Bobbie Rand, Or perhaps they're shearing stragglers, As they did down here below, Or mustering sheep and cattle, For the shade of Jacob Lou! Do you think it to be likely That they'll meet with Locky there; Or Desaillie and the others, That they use to know down here? For I often think and wonder What they can be doing now, If they still are drafting ewes and lambs For old "hopping Jacky Dou." And the men they've left behind them, They are only city oafs; Whose ways are bad and dirty— Whose only words are oaths. They will rob the poorest travellers, And tobacco ask of you, While their talk is interlarded With "Oh, strike me pink" or "blue." Many yarns the "old hands" told me, When at night we used to meet— Tales about old Dou, and Locky, Some of them I can't repeat. One or two, though, I remember, How one night when it was late, Jacky Dou had met two swagmen, Who were swinging on his gate. For a job at once they asked him, "Yea," said he, "I'll give you one, Be here early in the morning— At the rising of the sun." In the morning they went to him, And down the road together strode; At the gate he set one swinging, While the other on it rode. Ah! the good old days are over, And the banks have got the land, You will find some of the swagmen, Down in Sydney shifting sand. The squatters, too, have gone to glory, While overseers and jackeroos, Take their places and want paying To let you shoot the kangaroos. —MARSU, April, 1898.
