DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS. ' HAVE CURED MB. JARVIS OP LOCOMOTORATAXIA AFTER DOCTORS AND HOSl'lTALS HAVE UTTERLY FAILED, LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA, LONG BEEN CONSIDERED INCURABLE DV THE MEDICAL PROFESSION, HAS AT LAST BEEN CONQUERED. HAS A UIRAOLE BEEN FEKFORHED ? (From the Auitralian Workman.) la reply to the preliminary questions, said : " You want to know all about my case? Well I am glikd of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may be of value to those who are stricken as I was." "About five years ago next Christmas, I met with an accident. I was badly scalded while taking a bath in Pitt-street, Sydney. Since the accident I have been in failing health, aud after four years of gradual development of tho malady I was foiced to give up my billet at the Glebe Island." " What were the symptoms?" " Simply indescribable. The pains were something terrible. They were just about as much as I dould bear. They were far all the world like as if a saw was cutting my bones iD two in every part of me. I had no control over my bowels or bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and everynue else. I was incessantly shivering and shaking, aod could neither eat nor sleep. On the 23rd March last I saw a well-known dnotor, and he told me that my, cuse was utterly hopeless. However, he gave* me an order to the Director of Charitable Institutions." " Did you make use of the order." " No ; I came home and went to bed, and have been pretty well in bed ever since. Fife weeks ago I could not walk across the floor; iu fact, I oould not get out of bed. I felt then that it was all over with me, and only a question of days when I would give up the ghost. My doctor was attending me, aud did all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was under him for five or. six weeks. He came to the conclusion that I wai suffering from locomotor ataxy, or progressive locomotor ataxy, a disease of the spiual cord, charac terised by peculiar disturbances of gait and difficulty in co-ordinating voluntary move ments. He told me that I might last for 10 years, and that I might never get the use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his legs about with energy to show that mcdical opinion is not infallible.). Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by an advertise ment describing the cure eBected iu the case of another boiler-maker iu England, which I read in the Juttralian Workman, by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I read in the advertisement of a case which seemed to fit my own. I determined to give the Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent for a bpx. The effect was as marvellous as it was magical. I was able to eat and sleep as though nothing was the matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest I had for many a day. It was inoredible. I immediately left the bed, and was able to move about. I have taken four boxes of Fink Pills during the past four weeks, and am now taking the fifth box. I can walk about with the aid of a stick, and am gradually, but surely, recover ing my former vigor .and vitality. You see these orutckes here? They were made for me before I got Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, but I waB too weak to use them, aud now I don't want them. All I want is this stick, and I hope soon to do without it. Tou see I am rapidly regaining my strength," " He is 100 per cent, better," said Mra. Jarvis, who had come in and taken the baby on her knees. " Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have eaved his life, aud made another man of him." A friend who called iu at this point, said that Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he did a fortnight previously. "I can now," continued Jarvis, "ha\e a cold bath, and all the feeling has oome back in my legs. If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able to resume work us a boiler maker, and you kuow I have to be in the very pink of health and strength to work at that trade. I um better to-day than I have been at any time during the past fivo years. I osorible all the change and benefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved my life. I am in do pain now, whatever, and feel like a new man. On the mantlepiece there is a box of opium and morphia pills, which the doctor gave me to deaden the excruciating pain. But they can stay where they are, for I no longer need them. Everybody who knows me haB been amazsd at the change in int. They can hardly believe thoir eyes. My being about again has oausod quite a scusation out hero."
