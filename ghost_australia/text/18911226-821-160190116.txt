A REMARKABLE WEED. It is reported (says the Melbourne Leader] that tbe loco weed has found its way to Aus tralia from America. The looo weed is to vegetation what the rattlesnake is to animal life. The name comes from the Spanish, and signifies insanity. Is is a dusky .green, and grows in smaU bunches or hanafuls, and scatters itself in a sparse and meagre way about the country. It is a sort of vegetable nomad, and travels about not a little. Locali ties where it this season flourishes in abundance may not see any of it next year, nor indeed for a number of years to oome. The prime property of the loco is to produce insanity in men ana animals who partake of. it. Animals —mules, horses, sheep, and cattle —avoid it naturally, and under ordinary circum stances never touch it. But in the winter, when on inch or two of snow has covered the green grasses, these green bunches of loco, standing clear above the snow, are tempting baits to animals. Even then it is not common for them to est it. Still some do, and it :« once creates^ an appetite in the victim similar in its intense force to the alcohol habit in mankind. Once started on tbe downward path of loco a mule will abandon all other kinds of feed and look for it. In a short time its effects become perfectly apparent. You will see a locoed mule stand ing out in the shadowless plains with not a living, moving thing in his vicinity. His head is drooping and his eyes half- closed. On the instant he will kick and thruBt out his heels in the most warlike way. Under tbe .influence of loco he sees himself surrounded by multitudes of threatening ghostB, and is repelling them. The mind of the animal is completely gone. He cannot be driven or worked because of this utter lack of reason.
