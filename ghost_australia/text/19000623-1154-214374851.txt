WHEN FATHOMS DEEP. A sailor tells tho story of a diver who . saw two ghosts. He had gone down to the wreck of a largo steamer and was crossing the main saloon when two gray shapes of enormous size camo ambling towards him. Ho did not wait to make notes, but gave the dangor signal and was pulled' up. Told in the cheerful light of the day, it seemed rather a lamo story, so another divor went down to see what he could make of it. Towards him also came the ghostly gray shapes. He stood irresolute for a moment aud then, going boldly forward, struck bis hatchet through â€” a mirror! The ghosts were only a dim reflection of his own logs, much- enlarged, of course, as everything is that a diver sees through the frontal eye of his helmet.
