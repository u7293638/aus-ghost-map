A WEIRD NIGHT IN MANDALAY. -S A BUDDHIST'S BELIEF. It had been a hot and dusty day in April, when no one remains in Mandalay who can help it, and even the club in the added police grows dull as one thinks longingly of the approaching water-feast on the of weather that it should inaugurate Even as the buggy whirled along the wide straight streets that seem so strangely out of place in an Eastern city (writes Mr Budgett Meakin in the " Pall Mall Gazette ") the air was not only willing but burning, and the only promising spot scorned the wide cool mont, forbidden, alas' since the English began to drink out of it Early in the day, in prowling round the native quarters, study- ing colour and smelling " agape," threading my way through the markets and temples, I had lighted on a monk, who having been educated in a mission school, spoke English Spain and grant of fruit was he, has excellent cle in shaven crown display- ing as much fat as any other part, his sunken eyes in cavernous sockets posing, as it were from some centre of meditation his fingers and limbs more like a half-clothed skeleton than parts of a living being So when I ft and that he not only spoke my tongue, but made me welcome for the comparative cool of the night, I accepted a rib pleasure his invitation The sun had but recently shot, and the darkness has not yet complete when my ghan set down its face at the temple door As I heard it nimbly away and entered the shadowy precincts I wondered what lay before me One or two indistinct figures still loitered about at their worship, but otherwise all was still, and the giant figures of Buddha all round had been so well watered that day that the place felt quite cool, almost chill), after the dry air outside As I entered the courtyard it was with no small relief that I heard the voice of the monk, and port ceived him coming towards me for in treating thus with Orientals one is doomed so often to disappoint- ment " So you have really come I am glad to see you ' " " And I to be here," " Wall, come and sit under this face, we hope we can talk unhindered, for there won't be many more come to-night, and we have much to discuss " So we sat down together, he in the peculiar Burmese posture both can kneeling and sitting, his feet tucked away to one side, and in the more familiar cross- legged style We sat on a species of platform of cases mound a well leafed tree-trunk in the centre of the temple court and, for there was no monastery) proper here, and my friend lived alone from the first we were in sympathy with one another I wanted to know what he really be hovell, what his hope was, and if he knew fear to know the religion of Buddha, that controls the greatest number of my iollo-y-subjocts Holt it was not sufficient to peruse the works of D Eastern or Western scholars; least of all their poetry , I wanted not only to see it in practice, but to hear from living lips what sincere Buddhists think M) orr and having been made clear in the morning, no time was lost in coming to quarters, and note- book on knee I was soon at work interrogating him "Why do you live home alone i I commenced *' Because the monks in Burma are not sincere Once, perhaps, they are, in India and Ceylon , but not here, and in China certainly not. Thovdonot keep the precepts, so 1 excommunicated them I am only a novice, for whom there are but 10 rules, whereas for the monk there are 22, only possible to really good people who desire to leave this world for Nirvana " 5 Do you believe in spirits P " u Of course I do-in Nats because they are real, living things with forms Uko men, but lugger and more powerful Once in India and Ceylon the good Nats came down to earth, but not now, only the bad ones come still, they are always on earth " "Have you ever seen them " .' Yes, I have seen ghosts myself Some years ago in this place I saw one. I saw it sitting quite near me a man whom I had known what living I saw him there," as with a gaunt Unger he pointed over my shoulder to the corner of the yard His tones were so intense, his gesticulations so rapid, his evident sincerity so marked that I felt almost scared A dismal bell which some belated worshipper had struck hard by gave me quite a start, and when the moon peeped between the clouds and lit up the white- washed walls and pagodas and idols it deepened both the shadows and the weird impression of the scene I was glad when he proceeded " Did he speak ? No, they don't speak, but other ghosts there are whose voice is heard This one did not move When I was a layman I saw a ghost, but only shadowy, exactly of the colour of a photograph, but as a statue, with form It was at midnight Europeans don't believe in ghosts, though there are ghosts It is important to know this for the truth's sake And there are many witches in Burma who make women and children old and young They make people cry, they make people dead, they make people used by their witchcraft It is an evil craft What I am telling you now is all truth " " Now, in your religion, do you believe that there is a God i"' " In our religion there is no Everlasting God Tromonoto four Buddhas have become gods, but not everlasting in different worlds In some w worlds one, in some two, in some three, am some five On this four now, and one to come in others there is no Buddha They live for some ears, and then they are annihilated The spirit is entirely annihilated, and has no more existence Buddha's disciples also become gods, but not all, Only those called Va- hands " " Where did this world come from, the '" " By itself it came , it had no maker and no end of other worlds, too, some peopled by celestial beings, or good Note, and some by men They came from former worlds the very beginning of any world even our Buddha could not tell There is no written account of the very beginning of any world, or of the very beginning of any being " " But how do you account for the way all things round us work together so well ."' " That is for the interest of the beings but I can- not say how, because even Buddha himself did not tell For the use of the being this sun this moon, these stars fit in, for the interest of all beings Just how, nobody knows You see the moon over of us now , it moves by itself, by any force No one moved it nor the sun nor the stars No one directs them. If I move my hand or yours it is the power in me , there is no such force except in themselves Whence did they get it? I havatohl you for the interest of the world, for the interest of the being " " I agree to that, but what causes them to move ?" "I have said there was no maker they care of themselves, and will last as long as the world, and after they and it have disappeared now worlds will come again " " Do you pray?" " Yea, to Buddha AH Buddhists pray to Buddha " " Is he then a god ?" " Yes , but not living " " How can he hear, then " " He cannot hear but the prayer does good to him who prays All pray or comes from a good heart In every man's heart there comes a wish to do good to others or himself-that shows a good heart, and in Bnddlusmthsworkof a good heart is the main thing Through it we can become good celestial beings, and can get better existences in future live 1 brough the work also, of a bad heart men become lower barge in after existence 1 Those are the points of Buddhism Let me explain also that through very, very bad hearts men have to suffer punishment m ball and through very, very good hearts men may have especial enjoyment in this world and in heaven the worlds inhabited by good celestial beings Hell is inside the earth , bad people go there immediately after death, but some go into animals On this earth men are not punished on account of bid lions to, but the natural law really punishes in after existence, except in BOIUO things, as if one do wrong to the Aifica. of Bud Ilia's disciples *' What a good man does for others returns to himself. We love our children because in former lives we had children, and fed and nursed them, which was in this life repaid to us by our parents, which debt we again repay line to the natural law There is no perfect happiness , there is no perfect goodness except in annihilation-in Nirvana -w hie causes us to cease to exist There are many stages below us, the animals, the souls III hell and many stages above us, in heaven, the Nats, and still others above them which owing untold bliss for very long, but these must some day return to earth, and it once they But they must go back to hell and home again, coming on through the animals as before " Much more he told me as for hours I sat and went", till at last, after putting before him the brighter hope of the Gospel, we stretched ourselves out Bile his de on that platform of cane, with a brick four pillow, and soundly slept till the early worshippers gathered about an, and so put an end to one of the most interesting nights I have ever sport A Central News Agency telegram from Turin says -"The Countess Maria Mara; to, wife of a local nobleman here, has met with a terrible death The unfortunate lady was taking luncheon in her bedroom, being out of health, when by some accident at present unexplained she overturned a near. Mount lamp standing by her side Instantly the room was enveloped in flames, the Countess herself being on fire from head to foot before help could reach her Her husband and their three children were taking luncheon in another part of the mansion at the time These rooms in the Countess's suite of apartments were quite burned out."
