Sib, — VV hen tho storm of indignation and horror at the nefarious attempt at assassination of 'his Royal Highness Prince Alfred, which a few months ago had so fiercely and justly agitated the bosom of every man in these colo nies, had in a great measure subsided, and the feelings of anger and revenge which that foul deed had evoked had been somewhat appeased by the retributive justice dealt out legally to O'Farrell, wheu the fury of the movement winch had penetrated the hall ot our legislators, and compelled them in a fit of awful terror, to nass with almost one voice that suicidal enactment the Treason Felony Act, avid surrender .with one blow the high privileges of freedom which this colony so enviously enjoyed, had spent itself ; when even that thieving 'Opposition,' which «ive3 so much vexation and sorrow to Mr. Parkes and his colleagues, had sunk all common differences, and joined issue. with the Govern ment, when it announced: the- dread. revelation that, it had abundant' evidence of the existence of Fenianisai and treason in our midst, and when that motiumeut of shame; and lasting disgrace to our colony was kindly, sent back; for correction and safety by our Gracious Mother -the Que-.'ii, who did not wish that her. loyal. children in the ?excess of their devobedness, should wilfully avid shamefully commit themselves t) suicide, degra dation, and the worst of . species of. tyranny to themselves and their posterity .;.' ami when, finally, those immense rewards so, prominently and attractively pasted ami circulated through out the colony,': had failed* to evolve the ghost of a Fenian, orr: .other ?-. -treasbuable individual thereby proving / irrefragably that,; the Government, duped nob only the colony, ab.largevvith ihisrepresetitatibui bub eveu cajoled the; gloveipickibg.
