Simple Rot. What a waste of time to discuss such questions as "Reincarnation." And yet the compositors on one of the dailies are at work constantly on such stupidity. It may be diverting reading this hot weather, but it is about as valuable as the discussion of the school men-"How many spirits can dance on the point of a needle without jostling each other?" If anybody at the time had questioned the utility of such a discussion, he would have been ostracised as a dangerous heretic. Re- incarnated "egos" are about as sub- stantial as ghosts, satyrs, ghouls, incubi and succubi; indeed, I suppose some theosophists would admit the tangible existence of all these morbid fancies. Everybody will remember the satire of Voltaire : There were two parties in hostile camps debating the length of a giant's little finger. Words came to blows, blows to slaughter, when, a by- stander modestly asked, "But, gentle- men, does your giant exist ?" Straight- j way the opposing parties left off fighting ' each other and fell upon the inquirer, j So I suppose for my doubts upon , "egos" and other such non-identities ยก I shall be "christened" with -bad ยก words, but my uncharitable friends , I will continue to be as absurd as ever.
