CHURCH OF ENGLAND SYNOD. Tuesday, June 16. The President took the chair at 4 o'clock and read prayers The minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION On the order of the day for the resumption t " the committee on the Draft Constitution being read, the President left the chair, and the Synod resolved itself into committee of the whole Clause 27 was verbally amended and agreed to Mr Justice Lutwyche moved that the following new clause be inserted to follow clause 23 of the canon -" Any Bishop elect shall, either before his consecration, or, if already consecrated, before exercising any episcopal functions in his diocese, sign and subscribe the following declaration -'I, A B chosen Bishop of the Church and see of Brisbane, do promise that I will teach and maintain the doctrine and discipline of the United Church of England and Ireland, as acknowledged and received by the Synod of the diocese of Brisbane, and I do also declare that I consent to be bound by all the rules and regulations which have heretofore been made of which may from time to time be made by the Synod of the diocese of Brisbane, and in consideration of being appointed Bishop of the said Church or See of Brisbane, I hereby undertake immediately to resign the said appointment, together with all the rights and emoluments appertaining thereto, if sentence requiring such resignation should at any time be passed upon me after examination had by the tribunal acknowledged by the said Synod for the trial of a Bishop saving all rights of appeal allowed by the said Synod " Mr. Bernays said he was sorry he could not agree to the clause His principal objection was that they were gradually establishing a new Church, and he objected that such a principle as was now proposed should be imported into it. Mr Drew objected to the class because he thought the powers already granted to the Bishop in clause 6 which gave him the power of a veto, rendered it compa atively useless He is also thought that they ought to take a Bishop i when they got him for better or woke, as they took their wives Mr Justice Lutwyche said that if it ever became necessary to put a Bishop on his trial, that he would not be tried by the Synod, but by a competent tribunal appointed for that purpose The President said that strictly speaking he did not consider the clause applied to himself' but he thought a Bishop should be bound by the regulations of the Synod and when he signed the Constitution he would consider himself to be bound by it. The Rev Mr Matthews quoted from other Constitutions to show that there were precedents for the insertion of a clause similar to that proposed by His Honor The President said he scarcely thought the Synod could try a Bishop, but a tribunal appointed by the Provincial Synod would have to do it Mr Justice Lutwyche said that in due time he thought that the Synod would proceed to constitute a voluntary spiritual tribunal Those persons would be the delegates of the authority of the Synod, and would stand rather in the legal position of arbitrators They would have no temporal authority or power of coercion When they had investigated the case before them, and reported to the Synod then the Synod would con- fired their decision But to give effect to that decision, it would be necessary for the Synod, as for all other bodies voluntarily associated together, to apply to the temporal courts to enforce it From the Supreme Court of the colony an appeal would be to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council The clause was then adopted On clause 2 Mr Douglas proposed that all the words on the first line to the word that be omitted, with the view of inserting the following - " Whereas Christ commanded his disciples to teach all nations baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and whereas, building on this sure foundation, men have at sundry times and in divers places, joined themselves together for Godly edification and whereas, in England, Ireland, and Scotland, churches have been established by law and whereas", in Queensland, a dependency of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, it hath not been deemed expedient to establish by law any ecclesiastical polity and whereas, the members of the United Church of England and Ireland, resident in the diocese of Brisbane, in Queensland, beating in their hearts true allegiance to the United Church of England and Ireland as their mother Church, are desirous, Ac , Ac, At Mr Justice Lutwyche said he did not oppose the Union, but thought it um eces sary, and labor at variance with the general character of the preamble After some discussion, The question was put that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the canon The committee divided Ayes, 174, noes 17 The CiiAlRJtAt> said that there being a tie, he would (give his casting vote with the ayes The question was therefore decided in the affirmative, and the clause, as printed, was On clause 1, Mr Bfrnats moved that the words " as a branch on the first line, be omitted Mr Justice Lutwyche hoped sincerely that the amendment would not be carried In his opinion although they were at present members of the United Church of England and Ireland their descend- it is would not be members of the Church They would be baptized by priests ordained out here, and consequently could not belong to the United Church of England and Ireland as an establishment although they might belong to a Church holding similar dog trials That was the reason why the word " branch was used Mr Dudgeon thought they must for the future take it for granted that they would be a branch of the United Church of England and Ireland only The Rev Mr Jago said that they could be a branch of the Church of England and still be of that Church They were not separated from the Church of Eng- and because they became members of a branch of that Church The Rev J Bliss said it was an accepted doctrine in England that they were free out here in every respect When they chose a name it would be just as well not to adopt one which the great authorities at home said they were not. There was no necessary connection between the Church out here and the Church at home. He would most gladly welcome the day, if it ever arrived, when the Archbishop of Canterbury should be not only the Primate of all England, but also the patriarch of the whole colonial Churches and patriarch of every Church which had originated from the Church at home The President said he had no intention of ceasing to become a Bishop of the Church of England Had Mr Justice Lutwyche's proposal been that he should become a Bishop of the Church of Queensland, he should have objected to it After some further discussion, The question was put that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the clause The committee divided -Ayes, 29, Noes, 6 consisting of Messrs. Bernays, Blakeney Belbridge E Macdonnell, Sparrow, and Walls Clause 1 was put and passed On the motion of Mr Justice LtnwrCHE the Chairman left the chair, and reported the canon, with amendments Mr Grees in moving the re committal of the canon said that the amendment which he had brought forward had been agreed to by Mr Ramsay and himself, with the hope that it might meet the views of what might be termed the extreme parties in the synod It might have been crude, but their intention in introducing it was good and he was sorry it had not been adopted With regard to the position taken up by the clergy, he might call attention to the fact that, in the division on the amendment, only four lay members of the Synod voted with the clergy, and that the majority in the division consisted of one only The lay delegates were supposed to represent a very considerable portion of the laity of Queensland, and it should not be forgotten that the laity would have to raise the money to pay the stipends of the clergy. He believed that, if it went forth to the world that the clergy in the Synod formed a party in opposition to the lay members, there would be some difficulty in raising this money He thought it was not necessary that they should make so very distinct a confession of faith The Wesleyans had a very distinct confession of faith, and they were consequently broken up into five bodies For the same reason, the Presbyterians were broken up If by leaving out a few words they could prevent such a result this Church, it would be all the better The only argument he had heard from Mr Justice Lutwyche in favor of the adoption of the clause in toto appeared to him to be adduced solely because it was his offspring, as it were If they could get rid of these words, which had been a stumbling block to some members, without sacrificing any principle, he thought they should do so There might not be much in those words, but some persons thought there was a great deal They saw some very extreme doctrines introduced into the Church of England By the latest newspaper 6, they had received intelligence that cases had been tried at home in the courts in which the Ritualists had gained a great triumph Many people objected to some words in the third clause, because they supposed them to give authority for ritualistic practices and if these words involved no doctrine, it was better for tho sake of expediency that they should be left out He advocated the greatest simplicity in the con- duction of the Church services and strongly disapproved of the introduction of ritualistic ceremonies He would conclude by may And, " That the Draft Constitution be so committed, for the purpose of amending the third clause " Mr. Blakeney seconded the motion The Rev. E. G Moberly referred to the fact that several speakers had argued most forcibly on the desirability of a close union with the Church of England, and went on to state that if they wished such union they must adhere to her doctrines What they required was to closely, clearly, and thoroughly, follow up the doctrines of the Church of England, as contained in the Prayer Book The third clause asked nothing more than that they should hold the Bible, the Prayer Book, and the Thirty nine Articles Every amendment that had been proposed on that clause had been open to ob lection, and for the most part those amendments had been brought forward by persons who showed that they knew little or nothing about the matter These amendments could not do any good, and might do an infinity of harm Many of the gentlemen who supported these amendments must have felt that, in so doing, they were not representing their constitu- ants, and that, if they went before them, their acting would be repudiated There were two sides to the Church that they must maintain On the one side, there were the Protestant doctrines He did not wish to see those ritualistic innovations brought in, and believed that the words, " according to the Prayer Book," excluded such things, which were in fact outside that Book They wished also to maintain their Catholic position, and they would lose in mensely if they gave up this clause for a more uncertain one. The Rev. J R Moffatt did not think that he should give a silent vote on this question nor did he think that he would properly repo e sent those over whom he was placed were he to do so. He would candidly admit that he did not possess sufficient legal acumen to weigh the effect of so me of the clauses of the Constitution they had just passed through committee, and he had therefore remained silent during its passage He highly approved however, of its general plan employs, and hoped that would safely pass through all its stages While listening to the various speakers, he could not help observing that, on | several important subjects, considerable differ once of opinion existed , but he must, in justice, I say that the arguments advanced on both sides were urged fairly and with much force and that there was no factious opposition When he saw this, and reflected that considerable injury might, perhaps, be done to the cause they were trying to uphold if put vi ed at mrs, the bill was read a third time without being further considered, he came to the conclusion that his plain duty was, irrespective of party, and for the sake of of unity, peace, and concord, to give his adherence to the re committal of the Draft Constitution He thought he behaved wisely 'in doing so, not only because he wished that those who had so conscientiously acted in opposition should have a further opportunity of again pressing their views, but also because he himself wished for an alteration in the third clause, as also in the twenty- fourth In his opinion the definition of the doctrines of the Church, and the subscription required thereto, as set forth in these clauses, were not in accordance with that established by law, as would be found on reference to Victoria 28 and 29, chapter 122, clause He did not see why at present the Church in Queensland, in the Constitution, should not accept the phraseology of the Imperial Statute, or why it should be stricter in her requirements He wished his Church to open her aims for the reception of all true believers, no matter of what creed or denomination they might be Tohismind that Church was intended to be the aim sing mother, in these latter days, of all Christians, and if they have erected barriers so high that they could not scale them, and so close that they could not see through them they defeated their own object and caused many to turn aside from their fold who might also have been worthy and loving members For these reasons he should support the re committal Mr Bernays stated that he should support Mr Green's motion He considered that the precise definition of doctrine, as laid down in the third clause was unnecessary and unwise It had been found unnecessary elsewhere, in larger communities of the Church of England Elsewhere they had Church Con- stitutions working remarkably well, in which the references to doctrines were extremely slight in comparison with those it was proposed they should adopt In New South Wales and Victoria no such offensive exposition of doctrine was laid down in the Church Constitution [Mr Bernays lead from the Canons in question ] Then, again, in the New Zealand Constitution, from which it was professed that this draft had been taken, the parts of the latter to which he objected most strongly were not in cluded in this pattern, which they professed to copy, they did not find that precision, though the doctrine was more definitely laid down, than the two instances he had quoted By adopting this Draft Constitution in its present form, the calibre of their cler gymea would be much reduced, because the more desirable would not come here if they were to be tied down to a definition of doctrine, which was certainly held in England, but by the High Church party What good purpose could be answered by insisting on this definition ' He was aware that the option had been offered to him, and to the others who agreed with him, that, if they disagreed on this matter, they might leave (No, no ). He maintained that it had been offered in a leading article in a newspaper of the city, the author of which article be very well knew He would oppose a Constitution which compelled him to subscribe to the Combination Service, and he objected to the form of Oath of Supremacy used in the Ordination Service It treated through out, from end to end, about as un Christian a spirit as was ever imported into print Pie suming even that the objectors were simply weak brethren, their number was large 'The parts to which they objected were not necessary, as he had shown by referring to the larger places, and if they offended, why press them' What good end was to be answered ' Why were they to be called upon to strain their consciences' and why were many who stood on the verge and who would join their ranks to be excluded as they would be by this Constitu- tion' If all these persons left the Church, from whence were the ranks to be recruited' Men who came to the colony, and who regarded their Bible first, and their Prayer Book second, would not join the Church in such a case, nor would men coming here do so who held what might be called extreme views It forced upon them too much of man's interpretation of the Scriptures. They must accept the Prayer Book as the Church's definition of the Scriptures ¡ but he declined to accept it in place of the Scriptures themselves, as the proposed Constitu- tion called upon them to do. This extremely minute definition of doctrine was a kind of the cry from the High Church party. Mr. Drew would vote for the recommittal of the draft. He had no desire to impute Ritualistic motives to the clergy, nor did he believe that the Constitution had been drafted with any such motives. It was not wise to force upon the Church in the colony a Constitution which would be carried by a bare majority of one Mr Si'ARhOW had supported the amendment brought forward by Mr. Ramsay, and would support it again and he knew that a very large number outside endorsed his views on this matter. In founding branches the Church here, they should use every precaution to adopt such a Constitution as would drive no one from them Mr. Clarke, M L A , would support the motion, but not because he wished to see the amendment which it was intended to bring forward carried, as he intended to oppose it But, as this amendment had been lost by a bare minority, the majority being composed chiefly of clergy, he should like to give the laity another opportunity of carrying their wishes if possible The words in the third clause which were complained of were a mere nothing , but the expunging of them now would lead people to think too lightly of the rites and ordinances of the Church H they had never been put in, he should not have asked for them. The Rev. Mr. J we fully believed that his constituents at Toowoomba would agree to the clause unaltered Those who supported the clause did not wish to oppress the consciences of the laity ; they were simply members of the Church who desired nothing more than the rites and ceremonies He thought every member the Church of England ought to agree to it, and saw nothing in it to hurt the conscience of a weak brother. Mr. Coxen said he should vote for the re committal of the canon. If there were anything in the amendment that would affect the general principles or doctrines as expressed in the Tos farmer t, Bible, and Pi aver Book, he could understand the opposition, which had been shown to the re committal of the canon The gentlemen who had opposed the course which so many wished to adopt should have exhibited a greater spirit of charity, and have met them half way the amendments which were proposed the first evening that the canon was in committee were waived, and the gentleman is he now wished for the recommittal of the canon met the other party half-way, and said they would accept a Constitution of the description of the New Zealand Constitution. That Constitution was held out to them as a pattern, but now it was said that the Synod must take it in the form in which it was put before them by a portion of that body There appeared to be a desire to force it on in a way he did not feel disposed to accept Mr. Blakeney rose to address, the Synod amidst cries of-" spoke, spoke " Mr Walsh rose to a point of order He certainly understood that Mr Blakeney had already addressed the Synod. Mr Coxen said that, although he would be glad to hear Mr Blakeney, yet he thought it would be establishing a bad precedent to allow him to speak if he had already spoken. Mr Blakeney said that he had no desire to infringe any of the rules laid down for the guidance of the Synod Mr. Walsh moved the adjournment of the debate. Se< oral members of the Synod expressed a desire to proceed with the business Mr Justice Lutwyche said that he hoped the debate would be adjourned, as there was no probability of a division that evening. After some little discussion, The question was put and the committee di- vided Ayes 18, noes 18. The President said that as it was usual to courteously accede to the adjournment of the debate when the gentleman in charge of the bill For canon expressed a wish to that effect, he should give his casting vote with the ayes. The whole of the remaining business on the paper having been postponed, the Synod adjourned at twenty minutes past 9 o'clock until 4 o'clock next (this) day.
