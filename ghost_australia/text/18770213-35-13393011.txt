MR. DAMPIER'S HAMLET. so LAST evening, " Hamlet" vis lojSeated at the Victoria i Theatre to another full house. It is creditable to the public taste that -such large audiences should nightly assemble to enjoy erratically, so far as Mr Dampier is concerned, is an intellectual a cat The second performance of the great tragedy was a decided improvement on the first in ty on respect, and it is due to the members of the company today that there was an evident desire to improve, and to support the leading artist The hint we gave yesterday as to the accessories was fairly taken, and its adoption was decidedly to the improvement of the performance Mr Dampier's Hamlet is a fine conception of a noble character No one, after seeing it, would doubt that Hamlet was perfectly sane Madness with him isapictcnr-e assumed to suit his own purposes of avenging his father's murder and to baffle the emissaries of Claudius There is nothing in his manner either to Horatio, to Ophelia, to the Queen, or to the living, but what is perfectly natural under the circumstances It certainly s nts the purpose of Claudius to prove Hamlet mad if possible, and Hamlet is not unwilling to humour that purpose by assuming the risk of folly from time to time But it is novel done capriciously, if we rightly understand Air Dampier , Hamlet is wildly excited at the slightest thought of his father's death and his mothers his grief, and it any allusion which can be restored thereto but the passion is exchanged for a purposely recess and banter ng tone at the approach of those whom he either did trusts or knows to be the King' satellites To almost even character lnthoplnv he adopts a different manner I, and not least in this is Mr Dampier's power of acting manifested No marks, of course, the difference between the tom test due to Marcellus and Bemirdo and his own friendship for Horatio, nor is this altered by the awful revelation made to him by his father's spirit, except in so far is manifested by more punctilious politeness in the one case, and by increased confidence in the other Then to Koson chintz and Guildenstern he is quite another man 1 oth appreciating the motive of their interviews, it is his idea to mislead them as much as possible For Polnious he has a scarcely disguised contempt, even while recognising his Inch official position To the King, purchased governs all his thoughts and actions, and he never dreams of concerting 1 is meaning But towards Ophelia, whom he loves, and towards his mother, vi horn he is bidden to spare, he his entirely different parts to play that he does tendency and truly love Ophelia he makes manifest, but that he distil s's her truth is just as clean Her impression of his disordered mind, not knowing what he has observed of the son he had for him, through her agency, by the King and Polonius, and ignorant of his consequent idea of her perfidy is quite justified by his strange conduct A portion of the play scene which is quite in keeping with, and, indeed, more fully carries out the idea of the madness of which It under has conv need Ophelia, inculcates the representation of the drama in deference to modern delicacy , but it should be remembered, if one is to judge aright of the characterise Gertrude, Hamlet is, as he says, cruel only to be kind It is simply impossible that a mother, so she what Sherry, could judge her son mad upon such proof as Hamlet gives her Whatever she might have thought of his behaviour during the interview with the ghost, she knew well, from her own consciousness of guilt and from her son's subsequent conversation, that there was no madness about him Nor was there any taint of it in his soliloquies, or in his occasional remarks-to the players for instance, or to the gravedigger Mr Dampier's gave, in fact, the most emphatic contradiction to the idea by proposing one of the crucial tests of insanity, namely, to reward the matter which madness would gambol from Therefore, it would seem that Mr Dampier has adopted a quite consistent and intelligible notion of the character Exceptions might, as a matter of taste, be taken to portions of his reading, just because evo j one has his own idea as to how certain passages should be rendered But it was, as every student of Shakespeare must admit, alone, careful, and scholarly rendering of a most difficult part
