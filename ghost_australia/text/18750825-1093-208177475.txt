FREE EDUCATION. •TO THE EDtTOB. Sir—I hope you will allow me to say a word iu reply to " J. A. H." In his letters he classes free education with pauperismrand says we are going to make paupers of our children by-giving them free education. I ask '• J. A..H," if the working men objected to the Government.granfr to the University. No; they considered one was wanted in the colony, and they won't call; those : children paupers who go there, but they olaim the same privilege for their ohildren they so willingly concede to their wealthy fellow-colonists. Then "J. A. H." asks what Is to become of ~alI ~our private schools. First he says that all . the teachers will be thrown out of employment; then-he says people will send their children to private schools in preference to free sohools if the pri vate one is best. J. A. H." reminds me of the time when railways Were first opened in Englandi People said if:these railways go-on what ia to become of our coaohmeU and1 poBt boys,. to say nothing of the poor coachmakerB and horaesi? Well* railways did go on, and so will free education; until -every child in Her Majesty's dominions shall be' able to read and- - write. . But "J. A.JE." - says we want to tax the whole community to educate children at sixpence a week. I can inform "J. A. H." that the land we live In belongs to those ohildren who have been horn and who have yet to be born in the colony, and all they ask is that a portion of that land be kept back from sale, and that it be let-on lease. The rent will then pay all that will ever be required for education, for as the inhabitants increase so will the price of the land, and "J. A. H." will find the education tax I gatherer only a ghost. . I am,-Sir &o.;, J. E. T. Mount Gambler, August 16.
