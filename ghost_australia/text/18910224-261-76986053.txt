AM Ikoojsbjoible JOEBB. Among the weltremembared charac ters of my dramatic life was an actor named .Salisbury .... Life was one huge joke to bim I he treated noth ing seriously. He was the delight of actors and the bane oi managers. It is related of him that he once sent a tele gram to Mr. Rice, of the Chicago Theatre, applying for an answert-"I would not enjpge you if you would come for nothing." To which Salisbury replied:-"Terms accepted. Will be with you tCHnoirow." This man's memory was so wonderful that it was al most impossible to ask him a question without getting a Shakspearian quotation Sn repAy. If he was imperfect in his part, which was generally the case, he would interpolate speeches from other characters, talking the most absurd non sense, and turning a serious scene into ridicule. . . . One morning the poor old laundress was dunning him for her hard earnings. He was standing at the stage door surrounded by a circle of admirers, and, turning furiously upon the old woman, he paraphrased Mac beth's speech to the ghost of Banquo in the following words:-Avaunt and quit my sight. Thy tubs are marrowlessl there is oo starch in my fine shirts that thou dost glare withal. Approach thou like, the Russian manager, the Hyrcan critic, or the.old rye whisky-us; or, be alive again and make it salary day. If trembling then, I do inhibit thee, confess me but a babe of a Salisbury." The laun dress Aed in despair,' only too glad to escape unpaid from the supposed lunatic.
