REVIEWS. of The Livery Companies of the City of London. By W. CAIVEW HALLETT, Barrister-at-Law, Swan, Sonnenschein, and Co. 1892. Public opinion having shown a tendency to inquire into the constitution, vested property, and financial administration of the great city guilds, a Royal Commission was appointed, and the report of its investigations published in 1884 This authoritative statement went far to exonerate these ancient municipal bodies from the strictures which had been passed upon them, but it failed to entirely allay an agitation on certain grounds for the taking back of their charters, and the appropriation of their funds Under these circumstances, a comprehensive description of the once organisations, and an account of their origin, character, development, and social and political importance, together with a statement of their income and expenditure, such as Mr Ha-flitt furnishes, is opportune in three ways as solving a legitimate-, if mistaken, public doubt, as confirming the status of the guilds and as correcting the impression that they resented investigation, or had anything to conceal At the present time 75 corporations exist, of which the mercers, grocers, drapers, fishmongers, goldsmiths skinners, merchant tailors, haberdashers, salters, ironmongers, winners, and cloth workers are the great companies, the remainder being styled the minor companies In 1880 their charitable or trust income was returned at £200,000 a year, their corporate income at upwards of £550,000, and the capital value of their property at £15,000,000 There is also a long list of voluntary associations, which have disappeared, or have merged in the Livery Guilds The word guild's obviously derived from " gold," money The root idea was the erection of a guarantee for his good behaviour from every free- man on the attainment of his fourteenth -year, and the common sense of a trade thus acquired was the germ of industrial union In the beginning, these mutual benefit associations were voluntary First, there was a manship of separate trades, there cognate callings ran together, and, finally, the surviving interests were consolidated into corporate bodies The antiquity of these fraternities is so great that there is evidence of the existence of guilds in London in Anglo-Saxon times, and in the Middle Ages almost every hamlet in Europe had one of some kind Mr Hazhtt'B descriptive catalogue is enriched by woodcuts of the companies' armorial bearings, and of designs taken from the quaint old broadsheets which he has occasion to quote It is a close history of the growth of British commerce which he has compiled, as well as a chronicle of the notion through centuries of the protectionist spirit of trade, and a record of pecuniary privileges secured by success ary of charters to merchant bodies in return for the services they rendered to monarchs in time of war or other special need Lending to the Crown was so habitual a function that the operations came to be considered as banks and although the conditions of our constitution are now less procar lous, the disendowment and re-distribution clamoured for by an iconoclastic party would only be justified on evidence, not forthcoming, of abuse- in stewardship The enormous increase in the value of city property is the cause of the corporations' wealth, their property having been of small pecuniary value when one-month acquired, and that it has so augmented is due to the national industry and prosperity which they have been instrumental in fostering If the product of their foresight and thrift is to be wrested from them, in the absent of of an evident of maladministration, what about the possess on of noblemen and gentlemen (equally fragments of national property) which have been acquired under circumstances analogous, if less creditable, and no portion of which is directly applied to public purposes "Lot a Royal Commission issue," says Mr Hu/tt, to report to the nation upon the property of the Dukes of Westminster, Bedford, and Portland, the Marquis Camden, Earl Cadogan, Lord Portman, and a few more,

Roundabout Recollections. By Jones Anastas O'SHEA. Ward and Downey, London, 18!)-. In his pleasantly written preface Mr O'Shea modestly claims nothing more than " a few nega- tive merits" for his book , but we think most readers will be disposed, or closing the volumes, to allow him Several positive ones as well The title of " Roundabout Recollections " exactly expresses the nature of the book There is no part secular scheme or order about it, the writer skips from place to place, and from person to person, in a light and airy fashion which has a certain charm of its own and if he is not weighty, at any rate neither is he wearisome His style is amusing, and his pages plentifully sprinkled with good stories told with the Hibernian flavour which the author might be expected to give them. We go with him from Italy to Paris , visit New York, Belfast, Dublin-, in his company , have a peep at such an incongruous collection of great personages as Napoleon III, Victor Emmanuel, Thiers, J L Poole, and T P Barnum, so that there is no lack of variety in Mr O'Shea's pages We are sure he will not quarrel with us if we use a reviewer's privilege and quote one or two of his stones, which will no doubt only serve to whet the reader's appetite for more. He has two or three anecdotes to relate of Victor Emmanuel, first King of United Italy, who was remarkable (among other things) for the extreme plainness of his personal appearance - '' Oncomeotingan old woman gathering brambles as he was on a hunting expedition in the Alps, she asked him was it true the King was in the neighbourhood that day, and if so, was there any chance of seeing him "'Yes, lion about,' he answered, "would you really like to see him " " Thougcdfeimlo avowed thatfowsights would give her more delight " ' Well, mother, I am the King ' " She stared at him a moment, and grinned " ' Get out with you, jester ' Do you think a nice won in like the Queen would marry a hull ing fellow of your sort with that hideous mug ' ' "He was not offended Possibly the compli- ment to his spouse mollified him Anyhow he gave the outspoken dance some of the largest which was also a j s ready to his free hand " By the following description of the monarch, from Mr O'Shea's recollection of him, it will be seen that the old woman's unflattering remark was strictly in accordance with truth, if not with politeness -" VictorLmimuuel, as I bring him up before of me, was a squat Hen i lies, a history epitome of vitality- brown, bull-necked and broad-cloth dered, a man of co also features and sensual lips, with bush), upstanding black hair and aggressive Wack moustaches curling mutinously in connection with his whiskers " The chapter of theatrical reminiscences contains seven 1 amus new episodes, particularly the story of the ghost of Hamlet's father who danced a hornpipe on the stage, which, however, is rather long for quotation Another " ghost" story concerns a butcher's boy " with elocutionary aspire to is " who took this part in a strolling company aVil went well till the fifth scene of the first act, where the ghost armed rail pic in block' tin, be gras his dialogue with the Prince of Denmark " ' I am thy father's spirit,' said the amateur gentleman in a v ault-like voice, when an interruption came from the back of the gallery ' And an -iforii'tlly ugly sports on are The Ghost clattered to the footlights and, shaking one in used h n 1 tli.c_te- iui_li, exclaimed with most human and angry at emphasis " 'I recognise you, Tun Mullowney, my right customer W by the care of' war, as soon as the play it over, and I got the rumour off, I'll warm the wax in your can In - englishman III EMI (Yo'et and Pe-ollce'ioni) In two v volumes.

names alone would occupy considerable space follow each other in rapid succession like the changes of a k 'telescope the general effect on the mind is that of something like personal knowledge and contact with the persons, events, scones, and modes and manners of life of the long period over which these recollections range The writer tells his readers that unlike many Englishmen brought up in Paris he was allowed from a very early ago to mix with all sorts and conditions of men, which resulted in his being on familiar terms with a great many celebrities of the upper and lower worlds before he had reached his twenty-first year A constant companion of his youth, he says., was hand and glove with some of the highest in the Hundred, if the truth must be told, with a great many of the lowest

story 11 these made up a scene worthy of Version himself, but somewhat appalling to the cry Khan who h happened to come upon it una w ages of such material in the first volume mostly made up, frittering away the hero-worship of a good many popular idols, and curiously seasoning re- putations which have been handed down by the printed pages, with personal impressions of these heroes as they appeared to their families One could draw from this volume material enough to illustrate many curious sides of Parisian life by judiciously bringing its scattered material into order for such a purpose for the more modern reader, however, who is not so much interested in the artist life and gossip of the Paris of 20 years ago as in the history political developments of the Empire, the second volume will be more attractive The writer was clearly no sympathiser with the Empire or friend to the Empress He has been at considerable pains to bring together a large amount of discreditable personal gossip about Eugenie, and, being evidently a man of no illusions himself, he has no scruple about dispelling what he regards as the illusions of others In such terms of unreserved that Sir Lintorn Simmons has not hesitated to call his production " n scurrilous book," which is, perhaps, the best advertisement for this particular class of li term time that its least scrupulous admirers could desire If Napoleon III had been a man of any means, says the writer at the opening of the second volume, the Second Empire would never have been " Since its fall I have heard and read a great deal about Louis Napoleon's unfaltering belief in his star I f ney it would have shone less brightly for him," he adds, smartly, but for the dark, impenetrable sky of Hope curiosity in which it was set " The impecunious circumstances of others seem to have also favoured Napoleon, for this writer goes on to say that Lamartine proclaimed the Second Republic in a means of staving off his creditors This writer has the grace to let it strike him that this is not an elevated standard by which to judge political events, but he excuses himself on the plea that "I do not profess to be an historian mines is only the little huckster shop of history " The sketches given hero of Du Persigny, De Morny, Walewski, and other famous -gores in the early days of the Second Empire are scrappy, but vivid enough in their way Both Walewski and De Morny, we read, spoke and acted as if Louis Napoleon occupied the Imperial throne by their goodwill, he writes and that he was therefore in a measure bound to dance to their fiddling The death of Maximilian is traced to a dispute about an opera box between De Morny and Wales, and it is shown how Lord Palmerston supported the ionia detail, not bec IUSO he cared much for Louis Napoleon, but because he had been piqued at Lords Philippe's conduct over " the Spans mar riages The whole story of the marriage of the Emperor with Eugenie de Montijo is gone into, at the writer claims, from behind the scenes Napoleon, he says, was looking out for a La VaLUcro or Montespan when he met the future Em - press, and when he uttered the word "manage" it was merely because a cold in the head prevented him from pronouncing the word 'mistress" the writer chats about the beauty of Eugenie, her iron will, and the lines on which she modelled for court, taking Marie Antoinette for her model At the hunts at Compiegne, Days this incorrigible scandalmonger wickedly, Sirs Grundy was not banished, but specially in flood and dragged, and he quotes, with evident appreciation a most of the Emperors when the court ladies at Compiegne danced " Lo Diable a Qu the in ballot costume, and afterwards appeared at a ball in the same airy attire "Aptis tout," said Napoleon, blacking his eye, " nice ectU manie dis hommes de cost is apt ci dis danse ties, it taut mieux four on font as a bonne mason Of social life under the Empire, the sculptor, David, D'Angers, Marshal Vaillant, and the ad- ministration at the War Office the visit of Queen Victoria to Paris, the Franco German war, the siege of Paris, and the Com mane, this anonymous writer gossips in the same airy and piquant style The book may or may not have historical value, but from cover to cover there is hardly a really dull page in it.
