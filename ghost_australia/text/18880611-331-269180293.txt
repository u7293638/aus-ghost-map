The Country Party. Tlio Melbourne correspondent of fclio Lihjdaln Express writes : —Now that that extraordinary ghost-like combination, the country party, iias discovered that f have been saying all along the .Ministry had not the least idea of what their Electoral Bill was likely to look like when finished, they have ceased pestering 'lr Gillies to tell them more than he knew, ami have resolved themselves into a standing committee of three. Mischievous people say that the country party consists only of the two North-Easterners with an odd man in now and again to prevent them from feeling lonely, hut I con fess, though us .Ilnmlct says “those things I do most powerfully and potently believe, yet I count it not honesty to have thus sot down. “ It has always been a puzzle to me why it is that all attempts to form a country party fail, for* there is great scope of political action for such an association. Some day a smart man with keenno's enough to appreciate how nicely the country representatives played oil cleverly against the town ones, could ho made the stalking horse to success, will get into Parlia ment, organise these men of diverse views, who yot have so rnany in terests in common, attain the Pre miership, and achieve such a work in the development of the country districts, and in restraining for a few years the rapacity of the octopus Melbourne, that his name will bo honored, and a future political posi tion be assured to bini. Had lie been a more ambitious man with greater glibness of tongue, Mr Ander son of Koroit might have filled this role, and have made himself indis pensable to every Government that hereafter ruled'Victoria. But bis ambitions scent not the wind of such (last tires, lie loves the rural scenes The dandelions and blitter cups t jild all the lawns, the drowsy bee .Stumbles among the clover tops. O ! uncstrangcd birds and bees, O face of nature always true, O never unsympatl.ijng trees, 0 never rejecting roos of blue" \Ylio*c rash disberision never falls On us unthinking prodigals, \- et who convietest all our ill, So grand ami unappeasable.
