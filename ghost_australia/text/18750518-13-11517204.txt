INSTALLATION OF THE FIRST BISHOP OF SANDHURST. (ABBIDGED THOM THE BENDIGO ADVERTISER, MAY 17.) The ceremony of the installation of the first Bishop of Sandhurst took place yesterday morning at St Kilian's Church. Although charges of 5s and 2s 6d were made for ad mission, the church was densely crowded, a large number of persons of other denomina tions being present. Punctual to the hour named for the commencement of the cere mony, the choir, accompanied by the organ, sang the Hallelujah Chorus, during which a procession passed up the aisle in the fol lowing order -It was preceded by two boys in vestments carrying the crucifix and lighted topers. They were followed by the Very Rev Dean Backhaus and the Rev Fathers Revel and Allen. Then came Bishop Crane in full robes, and with his crook in his hand. He was followed by the Metropolitan of the diocese (Archbishop Goold), who also was in full canonical costume, and carried the emblem of the church, the crucifix. As the last of the procession passed inside the altar rails the chorus ceased, and the metropolitan, taking the bishop elect by the hand, briefly introduced him to his flock, impress ing upon them the necessity of pay ing obedience to his commands. Ponti fical High Mass was then celebrated. The Rev Father Kelly then preached from the Douay version of the 2nd chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, descriptive of the descent of the Holy Ghost. In a brief but eloquent sermon he described the duties of a bishop, who was, he said, placed amongst his flock as the representative of the guar dian appointed by the churches, and acknow ledged by the Divinty as its head. Referring to his antecedents, he said the bishop came from an order which had sent many noble and good men to do the work of the church amongst whom was also the archbishop. Their new bishop had been the head of an Augustinian monastery, and there he had exercised all those Christian virtues, and performed those charitable deeds which had fitted him for the position to which the head of their church had seen fit to elevate him. At the conclusion of the service addresses were presented to the bishop. The first address presented was that of the clergy of the diocese. It was read by the Very Rev Dean Backhaus as follows - "May it please your lordship-We, the clergy exercising jurisdiction in that portion of the Lord's sacred vineyard recently erected into a separate diocese, welcome you with feelings of great delight and satisfac- tion to the sphere of your future labours. It hath pleased the Holy Ghost, through the selection made of you by the Su premo Pastor of the fold of Christ on earth, to constitute you a prince of his Sacred Spiritual Kingdom, to govern the Church of God , and to take such special charge of the children of Faith in this diocese, that, under your spiritual guidance living in the Spirit of Christ, from that Spirit they also may reap life everlasting. We ap- proach you with the profound respect due to your high ecclesiastical dignity, we approach you with an even more deep feeling of dutiful devotedness to your person as the Father of this our portion of the Household of Faith, the golden link which binds us to the great apostolic centre of Catholic unity, the 'Heaven guarded ' infallible teacher of saving truth and sanctifying morals, the fountain head of Christ ' jurisdiction here on earth, we approach you, moreover, with sincere promise of that canonical obedience to your pastoral direction which we all know full well is not only the duty, but must be the delight of every true ecclesiastic. We all shall be but too happy with God's blessing to co operate with you to the best of our abilities in the glorious work to which you have been sent, and to which you have devoted the remainder of your life amongst us, that is, the preservation and extension of the salutary influence of Gods holy empire of truth, and grace, and peace, the salvation and edification of the body of Christ . Serious work is before you, with its con comitant severe struggle, and with sad disappointments perhaps not a few. You know the world hates us, and just now stands in a more than usually threatening battle array against God's Holy Church and His Christ. What happened to the great vessel of election in Macedonia is very likely to happen to you in Victoria, so that 'Whilst you strive to cleanse your flock from all defilement of the flesh and the spirit, per fecting sanctification in the fear of God-you yourself may have no rest, suffering all tribu lation-"combats without and fears within ' The solicitude for all the events of all the churches under your jurisdiction will inces santly demand the exercise of your pastoral care and vigilance, but we venture to say that few considerations will fill your mind with greater anxiety and apprehension than he working of that baneful law of public elementary education, which, enacted in political hatred and haste, wilfully shut its eyes to the claims of justice, and ob stinately set aside the well known and by far better means to its ostensible object which, whilst it has decreed banishment like unto dangerous beings to God and to Christ, from the public instruction of our youth, deprives most unfairly of their just share in the disbursements of the public taxes that integral part of our common wealth which cannot and will not, brook this implied blasphemy of that law, which like its system, called compulsory and free has disfigured with legal despotism the glorious code of our constitutional liberties. Your struggle ngamBt this evil influence will bo a hard and an unremitting ono until those who frame our laws shall understand that it is neither honourable nor to the fur therance of our common weal, for a triumph ant majority to trample under foot tho natural rights of an out voted minority Wo know, however that in tho spirit of your holy vocation you shrink not from this for mumble conflict As for us, wo will stand by your side, and BO will, wo aro convinced your faithful people, and, undor your wiso and fearless direction, will assist you in Ereventing the little ones, for whom Christ as died, to fall into the snares of godleis tuition and tho shades of eternal death We respectfully entreat your lordship to convey to Ins Holiness our humblo gratitudo for his having been pleased to erect tina new Episcopal Seo of Sandhurst, and for having placed you over it as ita first bishop We Bincerely wish that tho Almighty Ruler of all things will vouchsafe to your lordship a long and prosperous reign over ua, and that atter a life of health and success m this cause of salvation, Ile who comforteth tho humble may comfort by victory and everlasting re warda on the great day of Christ Jesus your lordship, your beloved Hock and ourselves, also your faithful and devoted humble fel- low labourers in the vineyird of salvation On the part of the clergy of this diocese, HENIU BACKUAUb Vicar general.
