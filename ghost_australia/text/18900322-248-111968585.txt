An Ingenious Swindle.—A swindle. recently detected is conducted as follows: A cheque, say for ten guineas, is obtained from a depositor at a bank, and a blank cbequa exactly like the filled-in cheque is secured. The two cheques are laid one upon the other so that the edges are exactly even. Both chcqucs are[then torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the filled cheque appears on one piece and the amount and name of the payee on the other. The chequcs having been held together while ">cing torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payca and the amount to suit himself, say one thousand pounds, takes it with the piece of genuine cheque containing the sig nature of the bank, and explains that the cheque was accidentally torn. The teller can put the pieces together, and as they fit exactly, the chances are that he will think the pieces are parts of the same cheque, and become a victim to the swindle. The trick, of course, suggests its own remedy. .'Tha teller should refuse to pay any cheque th*< i» mutilated.
