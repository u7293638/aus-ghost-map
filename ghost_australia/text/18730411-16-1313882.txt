LADY TELEGRAPHISTS. (From the Queen,) SINCE Government have undertaken the management of the telegraph service the public have occasionally been allowed a glimpse of the inner mysteries of the Central 'Telegraph office But hitherto these more cups d oil have been from a passing visitor's point of view, or through the medium of a detailed, scientific, semi official article in a newspaper or magazine Suppose we plunge beneath the surface far beyond the ken of the " casual observer," task nig cure at the same time to divest ourselves of the rosy hand spectacles of officialism-and consider the daily life of the telegraphists themselves Any morning, at a few minutes before 9 o'clock, troops of girls-fair and dark, tall and short, pretty and plain, with a sprinkling of " unclaimed blessings" of more advanced age, and here and there a wife or a widow may be soon entering the gloomy portal of the Cantrill Telegraph office Exactly as the hour strikes, those whose duty it is to Bond and receive messages take their places at their respective instruments, thus releasing the drowsy, heavy-eyed night clerks, who instantly vanish, like ghosts at cock crow Before five minutes have passed, all the fresh arrivals have settled to their work, though there is comparatively little business done before 11 o'clock. About that time messages begin to pour in thick and fast, the noise of the working instruments gradually increased from an intermittent letter to a continuous deafening din Ever and anon, above the tumult, may be heard the voice of a clerk in charge issuing som J direction or reprimand, such as, "OH calling," or " D. Y waiting," or " Miss Smith, why have you left your circuit? " sec T here are about 900 telegraphists employed at this office daily, of whom considerably more than 600 are of the gentler BOX And yet the work gets done, and well done, too, upon the whole However and women's rights bigots may protest and argue against the employment of women in public offices, it is very certain the "powers that be" find the system paya, or they would not so recently have admitted them into the Savings Bank Department of the Post office. At the time of the transfer of the telegraph! into the hands of the Government, Mr Ã¶eudii more made a startling innovation with regard to the arrangement of his staff, which excited much criticism, and not a little scandal This was by annihilating the social distinctions which had hitherto been rigorously preserved between the sexes In spite of 1 the decorous dismay of Mr. Grundy, 1 and she SoutH tee whose will come of it " of habitual croakers, Mr Scudamore persisted in carrying out his design The bold stroke scores on the whole to have been productive of more good than evil, at all events, the authorities say "the plan works well " Elirtmg is, of course strictly proln bited, though, indeed, the work is too incesBont to admit of much impropriety of that kind even if the upon lion were less strict than it is Won betide the unlucky wight whom the instinct of a superintendent catches exchang- ing unnecessary remarks with a fur neighbour, for the culprit is there and then condemned the night duty, and thus effectually prevented from repeating the offence When any event of public interest is in pro gross-such as the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, the Derby, are the excitement at Telegraph streets rises to favor pitch the deluge of messages, the noise, rushing to and fro, and general anxiety to got the work off with as little delay as possible, render the scene almost as exciting as a racecourse or hunting held Stn oh, if all the ungallant, stiff necked old fogies who still mental in the opinion that women are little better than incapable inanities, created for no loftier purpose than " to suckle fools and chronicle small beer " could be admitted as spectators, and induced to remain from 9 a.m. till 3 p m in the principal gallery of the Central Telegraph Office on a Derby day, ; they would be for ever silenced, if not wholly converted from their mistaken notions But the overwhelming honor, great as it may seem to any modest little medicine in her teens, or even to it mere woman of mature years of being admitted into Her Majesty's service, may be purchased too dearly It is very injurious even to those of the strongest constitution, to toil eight hours daily in II noisy, overcrowded, badly ventilated room, with the close unanimity ting attention which is absolute y indispensable to avoid making mistakes Now and then, however willing a clerk may be to do her work carefully and quickly, the over tasked mind will wander to that long letter only half read, which is BO temptingly near in her pocket, or the weary brain, connected with the perpetual din, will seek a moment's refreshment in recalling those louder words somebody wins period last evening as they two, aim in arm, threaded their way through the crowded the roughfare of the city But should he attention wander an instant, a mistake is almost sure to be made 'The omission of a word for instance, and Ilion, relentless as fate, down ooniosarapoit, and two hours extra duty without pay ore in posed on the toiler This punishment, is more as it is, land strictly enforced, is as a rule patiently submitted to But the system generally, which has of late rapidly extended, of imposing extra duty for the most trifling steamers, is gradually, but none the less surely, arousing a strong and defiant spirit of dissatisfaction Doubtless the nut li on tics find it an economical means of defraying overtime expenses But the interests of the public would be far more conscientiously Bon ed by employing fresh relays of clerks and abolishing overtime altogether except on special coca sons, when an unusual pressure of business makes a larger stall indispensable
