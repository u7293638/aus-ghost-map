THE BISHOP IN LAUNCESTON. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH. Bishop Montgomery preached at St. Paul's Church yesterday morning. His Lordship chose for his text St. John xvi., 7 -" It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will send Him unto you." The immediate effect which followed the ascension of Christ was the strengthening of the understandings of His disciples, who as it were grew from children to men, and understood why their Saviour should have left them and what work they themselves had to perform. They and other Christians met daily after the ascension, and rejoiced in the knowledge of the truth amongst them selves and their own personal redemption, and for the period of ten days were what might be termed "exclusive brethren." But the Holy Ghost came upon them on the day of Pentecost, and all the ex clusiveness was swept away, and they went forth from the upper room in which they had met to the market places, and mixed with all sorts and conditions of men, preaching the Gospel in all directions. The Bishop then dwelt upon the results of the power of the Holy Spirit working by an undivided church as shown in the conver sion of the whole Roman Empire to Christianity within 300 years, and pointed out that the same Spirit was guiding the church to-day, and not only the church as a whole, but also the individual life. In the afternoon Bishop MIontgomery visited St. Oswald's Church, Trevallyn, and gave an interesting address to the children on church and Sabbath school work. In the evening his Lordship preached at St. John's.
