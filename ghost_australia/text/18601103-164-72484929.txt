' c H A R A D E S, &c.; I. DR. BUSBY kept a school; Dr. Busby sat on a stool, And thrash'd the boys with his ferule! Grammar, from A to Swine-t&x;, He taught them with strokes upon their backs, 'Counts from 1 to Rule o' Three He taught them likewise as easily. And all the boys at Pons Asinorum Could master it when he was o'er'm ; And penmanship in equal strain He taught with rigour and with pain: And many a scholar from his school Acknowledg'd the virtues of his ferule. . Look at my first! attend, thou drone !' Cried he one day in a hasty tone: . By all the gods on ' Lympus mount, I'll raise from thee a clearer feunt - Of wisdom than appenrs to be At present in thy sleepy, slothful, sullence.'' The lad affrighted, as well he might, Could'nt say his hie, hcec, hoc aright, But stood there like a whipping-post, -Aghast, as looking at a ghost; But soon the changes of my second he could trace, And read the accents in a proper place, And he as a scholar in his sehool, Acknowledg'd the virtues of his ferule. The task so bitter now was past He wished to Heaven 'twere his last; Then laying my first within my whole, Denounced old Busby's iron soul. But up he grew and now a man He sees the wisdom of his plan, And vows with candour now for wunce. But for Dr. Busby he had been a dunce. And as a scholar from his school Acknowledges the good of his ferule. BAN.
