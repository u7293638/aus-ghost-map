[?] Sailing Notes. The ' twenties,' a class that promisee to provide some of the best racing for the season in England, bad their tint race on the loth May. From The field we learn that there were five entries, including last year's crack, the Dragon, and four new vessels designed by Messrs. Fife, Watson, Payne, and Clapton. There was a stiff breeze, and a reach all round, the order of finishine being Siola, Ghost, Velr.ie, Dragon, Chiqmta. The Siola was designed by Mr. Alfred Payne. The Elf, 2-rating, has changed hands. We believe that her new owners intend racing her next sea- on.
