He superintends carefully the saddling and bridling of Lothario, an attention the animal acknowledges by laid-back ears and a weU-£ireoted attempt to kick his jockey in the stomsdh. Mr. Snipe grins playfully. "U you was only as fond of me as I am of Soul says h* between his teeth; end taking bis friend's arm, whispers in his ear.

The young man's qyo» bright, and the colour stands in bis cheek He means 4o win if he can, and is not the least nervous. Captain Hughes, who thinks it looks correct to be on extremely confidential terms, remains assiduously at his elbow, and whispers instructions in his ear from time to fi'mg, as he has seen great noblemen at Ascot do by some celebrated jockey. "Hon't disappoint the horse, Gerard," says he, one urinate; "perhaps you'd better wait on , Lothario, and come when you see Snipe begin, the next; with various other directions of a contradictory nature, to eaoh of which Gerard contents himself by answering, " All light!" religiously to do hie very beet for the race. But if the rider'# nerves are unshaken by the prospect of a straggle for victory, as touch , cannot be said for the horse. « Booby by Idle boy" w not quite thoroughbred, but has, i nevertheless, been put through so severe q* preparation as might have served to disgust an "Eclipse."

Mr. Bruff, on the contrary—for it is that celebrated actor who has taken on himself the pleasing task of | attending Fanny Draper to the noes—is minutely observant of the demeanour affected by those who ride.

Every turn of Mr, Bnipe'a body, every inflection of his eomewhat un pleasant voice, is a lesson for the actor in the leading character he hopes hereafter to assume.

There is a horrible fascination in all this, no doubt; and then, bow well be looks in his silk jacket! "He's a handsome fellow, too, isn't he, that one in green P" she whispers to Mir. Bruff.
