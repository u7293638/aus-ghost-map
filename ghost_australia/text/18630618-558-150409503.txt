WOMEN S RIGHTS. To the Editor of the Qeelong Advertiser. f | Dear Ma Editor,—It is oo wonder that I conld | not understand the letter that I wrote to you about | the other day, for, from another that appears in to day's paper, I see that.it is the production of a ghost, and haying read a little of the proceedings of ghosts, I am not now surprised at the letter being of so mystifying a character; bnt not being at all afraid, of such creatures, I would recommend this particular ghost—that would play such pranks on a certain individual, if it only had the chance—not to trouble itself paying me a visit, either before cock crow or at the hour of midnight, as the" effect it would produce would be so small as to result in disappointment. As for Parliament doing anything towards their emancipation, I think it is not at all probable; and as to my uncles and brothers being returned as members,- they do not wish to have the honor of being at all connected with that institution. Yours sincerely, • ' ' ' Mary Ann. Ashby, Jano 13th, I8G3. ,
