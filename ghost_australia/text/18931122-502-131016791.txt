Mrs. Phillips. Mrs. Phillips, the wife of one of Glasson's victims, and who was nearly done to death by the murderer, has (says a Sydney corres- pondent of the Dubbo Dispatch) arrived in Sydney. She hovered for days and weeks between life and death, and at one time it was thought the awful wound she received would prove too much for her. The careful nursing and the attention bestowed on her by her Carcoar friends pulled her through, and now she is able to move about. A friend who has seen her since her arrival in Sydney says she looks very pale—more like a ghost than a humun being. Her face is pale and bloodless, and her eyes sunken and lack lustre. It is not to be wondered at, poor woman. She has had an awful ex- perience, and how she got through it good- ness only knows. The ??????????????has determined to recognise the great service which the late Mr. Phillips had given prior to his being murdered in so nobly averting a serious loss to the bank, by allowing his widow and children an annual sum of £100 for 15 years.
