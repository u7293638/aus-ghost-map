Slouching along towards Botany, ho saw two men busily engaged in Bawing a block of wood with a oross out Baw in a wood and ooal yard. One man was very tall and the other very short. After looking at them for Bome time through half-oloBed eyes Jack entered the yard, and, without any warning, knocked the tail man down. ' What's that for ?' shouted the injured man. 'Look yere,' said Jaok, 'I've seed you a-trying to take that saw away from the little 'un for ever so long. Just you let him have it, will yer ? If yer don't; I'll blind yer with soience.
