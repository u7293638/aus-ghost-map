THE GHOST ENTERTAINMENT AT SAND HL'RST. to the editoi: ot the age. Sir, — In yesterday's , Aye I noticed a para graph relative to the' ca«es which came into court for the recovery of accounts for ad vertising aud printing, Ac., for my ghost entertainment, ordered by Air. Medculfe, To-day I see there is a letter in w hich he states that it "simply resolves itself into a breach oi contract.' It may be very simple in his esti mation. but not in mine, as his conduct has cost" me upwards of £80, which I hive been compelled . to pay through his misrepre sentations to those who gave him credit here that he was merely acting as my agent, aud not on his own account, the proprietors of the papers slating in court that if 'they had thought it was for Medculfe they would not have given him credit for a shilling advertisement. I had no idea of any account being unpaid, as he has misled me altogether. . Modcalte states that "It will come before tbe court shortly." When I catch hint it will, and in a manner that he will uot relish. — Yours. Ac.'. li'AKCV READ. Sandhurst, 20thApril.
