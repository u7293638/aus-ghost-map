NIGHT. Night the solemn, night the etarry, 'Mong the eak trees old and gnarry ; By the tea shore and the ebtpa, 'Neath the stare I eat with Clarl : Her ellitn bodice was aniseed. My arm was trembling round her waist, Iplncked the joys open her Hps; Joys, though plucked, etlll grow again I Canst thou say the same old Night T Ea ! thy life Is rata. Night the kolemn, night the atsrry. Oh, that death would let me tarry Like a dew drop on a dower, Ever on those Ups of Clari t Oar brings mellow, then they fall. Like o'er-ripe peaches from toe wall ; We ripen, drop, and all Is o'er ; On tbe cold grave weeps the rain ; J wiep It ebould be so, old Night. Ah I my tears are vain. Night the solemn, night lbs starry, -Sir, alas ! tbat years should hurry Gloss from life and Joys from lips, .Lore-lustres from the eyes of Clari ! Noon! that walkeet the blue deep, Like naked maiden in her sleep ; Btar I whose pallid splendour dips In tbe ghost-waves of the main. Oh, ye hear me not 1 old Night, My tears and cries are vain.
