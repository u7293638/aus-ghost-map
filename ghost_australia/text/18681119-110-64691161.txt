5ElEAaHsD. (From Chaosers* Jour at] The gay, glad year was yet in its prime., WheLn I lost the pearl I had only won At the close of the previ us surname-tia e The pearl of oy ifee, and her little one. The younger drooped ahen the rlder died Yolloeed her our the brcad black River, Leaving the gap in my ,oei more wice, A gap that wlt gape therein lfor ever. My loss has darkented my manhoo.'s dran, Has shadowedl all that was ou.ee to fair, Till the sky of my life is quite o'ndrawn With the web that honow has wov. n there. And oftentimes, when the reatless ghost Uf that vantahed teeremouth haunts my brain, I feel as if nipped with a s-dden frost, And racked with a something worse thr:n pain. Yet I bear it all with a bold, brave front, And go on facing life as befuore, With an inward anguish nought can blunt, And s sond in my heart for evermore.
