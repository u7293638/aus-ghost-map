JOHN ROBERTSON, MY JO. (With apologies to the Ghost of Ilabbie Burns.) John Robertson, my Jo, John, I wonder what you mean By sticking to Jem Martin, and showing Harry spleen ! | Ye're very full of spleen, John, and why should you be so ? Gang sooner to your bed at e'en, John â€” John Robertson, my Jo. John Robertson, my Jo, John, when Nature first began To make of you a statesman, she made a proper man ; And you among them all John, that you have, diddled so, Then used to hold the leading hand, John Robertson, my Jo. John Robertson, my Jo, John, you were my first conceit, But ye'll na think it strange, John, though I call you trim and neat, That some folks say ye're sold, John, and 1 be lieve it's so : 1 know you're not the man you were, John Ro bertson, my Jo. John Robertson, my Jo, John, what pleasure does it gie To see sae many rows, John, spring tip 'tween you and me? Now with your old companions, no doubt, you'd like to go. ; But then they wouldn't hear of it, John Robert son, my Jo. John Robertson, my Jo, John, through years of pay ye've past, But soon the day maun come, John, ye'll see of ' screw' your last ; But let that nae affright ye, John, ye'll have a chance, ye know, To take up with the other side, John Robertson, my Jo. John Robertson, my Jo, John, we've clamb the hill thegither ; And mony a canty day, John, we've had wi' one anither; Now we maun totter down, John, but hands apart we go : We work thegither now no more, John Robert son, my Jo.
