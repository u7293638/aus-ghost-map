Well we met to celebrate the jubilee of the New South Wales Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society and your committee, In presenting a statement of the scene ty's operations, desire to acknowledge, with devout thankfulness, the goodness of Almighty God in permitting them to witness the fiftieth anniversary of its formation. While inviting their friends to join in the celebration of its jubilee, your committee are forcibly reminded of the passage of Holy Mtlt,"rthcrircn have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours" Those who formed the society and nursed It into strength and vigour have passed away to their eternal rest Among Its taiHest friends and sanctions supporters, we would especially mention the names of the late Rev. Samuel Marsden and the venerable Archdeacon Cowper. To their exertions, mainly, tbU Auxiliary owes its existence, and from a very comme ree mine they took an active and zealous interest in all his proceedings, devoting to it their influence, and taints, and lime Fifty years have passed away since this Auxiliary was first! instituted. It was established on the "9th March, 1847, at the suggestion of the Right Honorable Lord Teignmouth, then Preside at of the Parent Society, under the sanction and with the liberal assistance of his Excellency) Governor Macquarie, his Honor Lieutenant Governor Molls, the Judges, and many other persons of rank and influence in the colony. Amid the many changes and vicissitudes through which the colony has passed since then, this valuable Society has six II on. It has had to struggle through many difficulties and adversities, contending; area all tititl surmounting the opposition of his enemies, as well as the lukewarm indifference of its professed friends ; ever striving to carry all the great object of the founders, is stated in the first n port-" to co-operate with the British and Foreign Office Ministry In promoting amongst all classes the dUtttbuiloi of the Holy Scriptures without note or comment." And nsw. In ii.? I fresh year of its existence, with the same single object still in view, it appears beforoyou more rigorous than over, with lbs representative of her Majesty occupying the chair at annual mt i tinge, and the representatives or almost every Protestant dim mination nriiocMlng In cause. The formation of the auxiliary)- was pregnant with advantages to the colony, which soon became manifest Previous to an establishment the scarcity of the Scriptures both in Sydney and throughout the country was most appalling; and the society's first attention was to the supplying the pressing need. Through various agencies It distributed the Scriptures not only in the city and the suburbs, but in the interior and in the outlying; districts, where there were many who were destitute of almost every means of religious Instruction It Immediately formed social tone In the sex in) inland towns, and a branch was established in Tas mania for the promotion of In one great object the saving to every household a copy of that volume which teach men how they may live peacefully) and happy) on earth, and prepares them for a far higher and nobler state of existence beyond Nothing of moment occurred in the society's history until the discovery of ihcgiild-mldsin 1851, when the tide of dwarfs fitful attentive in a story i..vu»ana8 of atiit-nteirer« write nostalgia at rsee put forth every effort to introduce the Scriptures among the rapidly increasing population, and, for the first time, club fished a system of eclportsge. similar to what e exists an extra sheet) on the Continent of Europe. The colporteurs traversed thoughout districts of the colony with a stock of table and statesman, carry into the very doors of the people the word of eternal life. From time to lMhaboUtillSOO were spent In support of them, towns in which the parent society grain flour and by their agency nearly POCB copies of the Scriptures were in to circulate among those who might never olhorilsohaxe heard the glad tidings which the Bible makes known. Averages rare, however, your committee felt constrained to relinquish the valuable agency, owing to the scattered state of the hope's thousand the great expense and difficulty of the work, and have ion pit to establish branch societies and depots for the cure of the scriptures a when the last ten years the society has been gradually and dancing. In 1848, the Rev. M. H Beecher and Thomas, Charles, Esq A visited the colony as a deputation from the parent society, and were successful in exciting a deep interest on behalf of the society throughout the colony. More than forty branches were formed by them, and many that were lukewarm and in operation they For Ix ed. The number of branches at present in connection with this auxiliary is only twenty-six. Th la arises from Ihcauxlltaryiuelf mixing been Halted in lUcx tent The branches In Queensland, Goulburn, Parramatta, Xlelt land, and Newcastle On viz constituted themselves independent as 1 ladies,; and have attached to them all the branches for their immediate neighbourhoods. This arrangement has not been without its nttranlagcs, Inasmuch as 11 has been hearing of calling into operation other branches and affording Increased aid to the parent society) since the formation of this auxiliary there has been trans- mitted to the parent society, as free contributions, the sum of ASHES 6s Id And no fewer than U2.2Í copies of the scriptures hair have told your committee have much pleasure in stating that the first portions of Scriptures translated into any language in the South Pacific, being parts of the New Testament in Maori, were printed here in Sydney at the cost of the society. Three thousand copies of portions of the New Testament in the Nieu language have also been printed by your auxiliary the whole of which were immediately disposed of on arrival at Savage Island. A complete edition of the New Testament in the same language is now being published, and will shortly be ready Your committee have also For suited to bear the expense of printing and publishing the New Testament in the Maori language whenever the translation is a day The paper for this and also for the MtU Testament, has been sent out by the parent seeks). 1 large grunts of Bibles and Tcstami no, amounting to nearly lP.Lbu copies, have been made at different times by the parent society), for gratuitous distribution to the sabbath schools within this auxiliary; the whole of which have been ludicrously issued, and have proved of great assistance * of those who are engaged In the religious; Irish notion of the young x. our committee would make special allusion to the appoint a chief the Rev Dr Tucker, who came to the colony some Mt TI years ago, to occupy the important and rcs|>on>lb!c office of n el ill 11 agent of the parent society in the Australian colonies, are appointment has been attended with the most favourable results, from his counsels and labours the several auxiliaries have made considerable progress, and his annual visits to the most important branches have already had the effect of stirring the war into activity, and Imp writing to them fresh life and vigour Your committee would remind you that one of the objects of this meeting is to raise a special fund for the erection or purchase suitable premises in which to carry on the operations of the Eyelet) It will be recollected that so far back as 1853, It was resolved to raise a fund for this purpose, in commemoration of the jubiltcxearof the parent society.
