THIS DAY'S EVENT'S. Mectiticr to form branch of Australian ]N atives Association, 8 p. in., Palace Hotel. ■The Sort of Man Wrigt is.—Isaiah or •• Wild Wright, the most noted assosiate of the Kellys, is; upon his trial for horse-stealing, and the Yictorian police will not be sorry to see him put in some safe place. Probably no single man ever gave the force so many and such severe pummellings. Before any hair grew on his face he was the bete noir of the Mansfield constables. Whenever they had to arrest him, they generally received a con siderable amount of rough treatment, and sometimes he would stack three or four of them in a heap before they secured him—to the great delight of his admiring sympathisers. He was a great reaper, and could fairly claim to be an "acre-a-day man." As a wrestler few could tackle him. He went into Riverina for the shearing for several years, and soon became known both for his quaint expressions and irrepressible rowdiness. Though not a scientific -fighter, his bony strength and en durance made him an awkward opponent. He frequently walked into a hut full of total strangers, and asked whether " any flash man would care about a round or two ' —but. he was very seldom accommodated. As most men have a favourite exclamation when excited, Isiah had his ; generally it was "Hi for Hogan" or "Hogan's ghost!" In fact, the mythical Hogan seemed to be his patron saint on all critical occasions.: and to that personage his poem of victory was always addressed. Wright would fight any man for pure love ; it was quite immaterial to him whether there was any point at issue. As an indication of,his endurance, on one occasion when the frost lay thick 0n the ground, he swam a mile in the Murrumbidgee before breakfast, for a ridiculously small wager.
