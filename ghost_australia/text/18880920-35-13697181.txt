FEDERAL PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY a- -a ANNUAL SESSION. The third session of the Federal Assembly of the Presbyterian churches of Australia and Tasmania was opened in St Stephen's Church, Phillip-street, last evening. There was a good attendance. THE OPKVISO SKIUIOH The Rev Dr CAMERON, retiring moderator, preached the opening sermon from Colin li " And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body" and also Psalm cwn 6 -"Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within the palaces " He felt how desirable it was that the words he was to address to them that night should be words suited to the occasion Ihoywero met in their third Federal \sscmbl>,and in pursuance of a movement which had for its object the gathering together into closer union and more effective co-operation the scattered forces of Presbyterianism in this Southern world At such a time, and on such an occasion, their thoughts would naturally turn on the subject of unity-its importance, its obligations, and the benefits it was fitted to confer The words chosen as the ground of the discourse referred to this 1 he spoke of three things unity, peace, and prosperity 1 Those three were mutually related The ona followed upon-flowed out of the other Unity bogus peace, and peace brought forth prosperity He then went on to speak of the unity which bound together those who were members of Christ, and subsequently proceeded to consider the peace with which this unity was associated This piece was, first of all, an individual peace, a peace ruling in the hearts of those who had responded to the call of God But it was obvious that the peace here spoken of, while riding, in the best instance, in the hearts of m div idual belov ors, was fitted and intended to be got peaceful relations between those who were joined together in the fellowship of the one faith in Christ It was a peace which, flowing forth from the hearts in which it dwelt, would pervade the whole body-a social peace diffusing the spirit of harmony through all the members, in all their relations to each other, and in all the work in which they were called to engage And here it was interesting and instructive to notice the bearing which unity had upon the reception and enjoyment of this peace Unity was represented as the basis of the peace, as that by and through which it was to be reached They were allied to peace, not, however, as isolated units, but they were called to it in one body In one bed) they were to advance to the attainment of it. Thus, and not otherwise, was it to be secured The way in which peace was thus made to depend on unity was well fitted to remind them how important was unity and how incumbent it was by all possible means they should strive to secure it. Should it be said that the inward unity was the only really important thing, and that about the outward they "need not much I concern themselves ? It was, indeed, quite possible to make a too much of a more outward and visible unity , but it was at the same time, quite possible to make too little of it, for it was not to be forgotten how intimate was the connection between the outward and the inward w here the inward unity was real living, and energetic, it would work outwardly toward the production of a visible unity in sympathy, association, and effort They may set little value upon a visible unity which had been effected by the iron hand of a despotism, which united all by crushing the life out of all, but, on the other hand, the chaos of conflicting sects, which was the reproach of our I Protestantism, might excite in them less distress than such a spectacle was fitted to produce They might try to persuade themselves that such a state of things was the inevitable result of their freedom, that those divisions were not an unmitigated evil, but served certain useful ends They might learn so to view those unhappy divisions as to become in great measure blind to the Sin and shame which they involved. Much only there was in these divisions to distress and humble them for might it not be warrantable affirmed that just in proportion On the spirit of unity was lacking, would allegations and separa- tions multiply, while, on the other hand, in proportion as the spirit of unity was living and energetic, would it manifest itself as a constraining force drawing men together in visible fellowship and in brotherly co-operation It was pleasing to think that the drift and tendency of things in their day was not toward further separation but toward closer fellowship and more visible union The conviction appeared to be growing from year to year that only something absolutely fundamental and vital could justify separation from those with whom they were joined in essentially the same faith, and that among principles, even such as were held to be of primary importance, it was possible for men to lose sight of, to sacrifice that which was higher and more comprehensive, through an inordinate zeal, on behalf of that which was lower and loss valuable. Might they not venture to hope that the time of disintegra- tion was past, that the time for reconstruction had come, that the Church, after her long and painful experience of the evils of ecclesiastical imperialism on the one hand, and of an ultru-rndividuali&m; on the other, might reach at lost a higher and J as her conception of the true and essential oneness of the body of Christ, alike in its visible and in its invisible aspect, and be enabled to exhibit ere long the pleasing and imposing spectacle of on all-embracing, sympathetic, loving brotherhood, visible one in association and counsel, in fellowship and in co-operative c effort In regard to that movement for closer union on which they had themselves embarked they felt no hesitation in having that no trivial matter, no undivided opinion, no merely local or personal interest, could warrantable be allowed to intervene, to hinder its consummation, orarrostits progress The prosperity of a Church was not to be measured by the number of its adherents, by the magnificence of its edifices, by the vastness of its resources, by the brilliance of its assemblies, and the splendour of its ritual A Church might have all that, and yet be a dead Church A prosperous Church was a living and a loving Church, a praying and a working Church, a giving and aggressive of Church, an energetic and a growing Church A Church pervaded with the King and life-giving breath, by the spirit of God Church instinct in all her members with the life of her Lu mg Head-a Church the atmosphere of whose assemblies was so laden with the breath of heaven as to constrain all to feel that God was of a truth in the midst of them a Church whose members were all active in some form of Christian work-a Church that reckoned nothing that she had her own, but held it for her Lord's church that was lengthening her cords and strengthening her stokes day by day-a Church that was going forth into the highways and byways of heathenism, near at home and far away compelling the outcasts to come in, labouring Honor getically and successfully to turn the desert into a fruitful held, and to make the moral wilderness around rejoice and blossom as the rose such a church they might justly designate a prosperous church VII history bore testimony to the intimate connection which subsisted between peace and prosperity And so in the Church when peace abounded prosperity followed AS its natural fruit It was som the infant church, " Then had the churches rest, or peace, and were edified and walking in the fear of God, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied." Edifi- cation and multiplication wore the blessed fruits that followed from that brief breathing time of peace in a new country like this where there remained so much land to be possessed, such multiplication was manifestly that to which, as a Church, they were specially called And nothing could tend more to hinder this multiplication than internal conflict, or the absence of that unit) with its concomitant peace, which were the conditions of its attain- ment. Lot but the spirit of unity pervade the churches of their federation, and let the peace to which it conducted reign in their hearts in their congregations, in their assemblies, and in all their relations towards each other let there be the one supreme aim and the one high and holy enthusiasm, animating the whole body, and it would be hard to assign limits to the measure and amount, both of edification and multiplication, that would follow. The Federal Assembly was then constituted with prayer offered by the Rev Dr Cameron The minutes of the last Federal Assembly were laid on the table and signed by the moderator and the roll of the Assembly was called by the clerk (Rev J S Laing). THE MODERATOR ELECT Ino MODERATOR stated that in connection with the appointment of a successor to the office which he had had the honour to fill the center of the nominators had fallen upon the Rev Dr Hay, of Rockhampton. (Applause ). He felt sure that this choice would be very cor ally endorsed by the members of the Assembly, as the many and well known attainments of the Moderator elect eminently entitled him to this honour In retiring from the position he had held as Moderator of the 1 Federal Assembly, he took the opportunity of expressing his deep sense of the courtesy and kindness he had always received at the bonds of the brethren during his term of office The rev gentleman then vacated the chair, which was subsequently occupied by the Moderator Elect Till- MODERATOR'S ADDRESS The MODERATOR'S ACT then delivered his address in the course of his remarks he said -I his is now the third Federal Assembly of the Australian and Tasmanian Churches, and it is admitted that the issues that hang upon its deliberations are of vital and far-reaching importance to the federation itself to the several Churches embraced in it, and through them to the future of Prosbv - tenants in these colonies In other circumstances, I might have felt at a loss in regard to the selection of a subject on which to address you But the acknowledged specialty of our position at this juncture has relieved me of this difficulty We seem to be called to pause and retrace our steps not by actually travelling backwards or undoing anything that has been done, but by looking again at primary facts and first principles, and drawing therefrom, under the guidance of a broad Christian charity and an enlightened and unselfish esprit de corps and public spirit, the Divine inspiration of practical duty thus only can we hope to prove ourselves "men that have understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do," and to rise to the due appreciation of the exigencies of the present in the anticipation of the grand possibilities of the future It is the glory of Presbyterianism that it recognises the place and the potency of the individual mind and will Its movements are not dictated by a central autocracy, which demands the surrender of judgment and volition by all but itself. " The voice of the people the voice of God, in the Christian sense of the words, is its fundamental maxim Action follows deliberation, and obedience to authority is the outcome of assenting reason Progress, therefore, is often Blow Practice over logs behind theory. Logical and on thusiastic natures are both alike apt to sicken with disappointment because of hope deferred Where are such nature among us, and they find it difficult to ship the tardy response which their reasonings and their aspirations meet with in natures of another stamp. they are apt to forget that true progress owes its production to conservative, as well us to reforming forces, and that the excellence of the final result is not seldom due quite as much to the former as to the latter " Rome was not built in a day " Pardon me for quoting BO into a proverb for, true as it is, it is often forgotten just where and when it should be remembered to reconcile apparently conflicting interests, to bring machinery, constructed on Minons principles, and timed for different rates of motion, into simultaneous and harmonious action, to marshall for mutually supporting movements forces that have hitherto been acting independently these cannot be effected by a stroke of the pen, by a decree of legislation, or even by the flat of an autocrat The considerations which we so readily admit and realised the world of politics are not less valid in the sphere of religion the churches represented in this assembly have been drawing closer to each other now for a period of ten > ours The fact had been staring them in the face that here on this great > island content not they were cut off and isolated from the greater world > beyond But Those other facts had been equally patent-that they were > separated from each other neither b> doctrine nor b-v police, nor by > relation to external institutions or authority that the only lines of > demarcation between them were but river courses which bridges had spanned, > or mountain chains which roads and railways have pierced, or perhaps nothing > more than parallels of latitude and longitude marked only the lines of the > engraver on the map, or by the page of the survey on the ground there was > not even the pro text of a customs' tariff to hinder the transfer of real, > learn- ing, or energy from one to the other What was to be expected, then, > but just what has taken place in-the gravity tion of these churches towards > each other Their federa- tion is but thotmtcomo of a great law of our social > being In that federation, common colds may be sought by the combination of > hitherto Scattered resources mutual sym pathies may be drawn forth in the > prosecution of common work, mutual confidence may be generated in support in > common dangers Whom "God who hath determined the times before appointed and > the bounds of our habitation," bath thus joined, let no man put asunder We > speak, it must be confessed, rather in the language of anticipation than of > experience Our hopes have not got men to full fruition Many of our dreams > every day dreams are still inn and unsubstantial visions But this is only > after the analogy of nature In that union of hands and homes, in the > celebration of which we are so often called to take a prominent part, how > frequently does the true union the union of hearts come only after months it > may be years of life day by day under the same roof Is, than, the outward > trip to be undone because the inward unit is not yet completed' showers ' > dissidence of conjugal dissent," in which there is neither a common purse, > for a common table, nor common speech, may become the normal condition of > life But what is the remedy P Is it to call in the divorce court to make the temporary gulf permanent and impassable? Is it to assay the holy vows spoken in the kindness of youth and the love of espousals { Merely to put this question is to answer it, and to answer it with an emphatic negative (Applause) If we are true to ourselves and to the great interests con- fided to our charge, we shall recognise that the federation of those Churches is a fact accomplished-a marriage con- summated for better or for worse We are no longer masters of our own actions 1 fine and the world, and the Church and the Master, have taken pledges of us V of may have married in haste, but we have no place and no leisure for repentance Aulla tesligia retrorsum is true of many other things than the fabled gates of Avernus We are here on the road to the Land of Promise The faint hearted Italy say, ' Let us make a captain, and let us return into Lurjpl." But God in His providence, is strange to us as to Moses of old, " Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward " (Applause ) We are here representatives of federated Churches, and the work to which we are called is to make that federation a reality The maximum that is implied in the word may not be at the present moment attainable, but let us not be content with less than the minimum There have been federations in the political world, in which the control authority has been little else than a mere ma ma J he federated States have added little or none of their individual autonomy the central authority has had little more than the doubtful privilege of giving advice that may be ignored or rejected A federation of this sort would not be worth the parch- ment on which its forms are engrossed (Hear, hear ) Let us mark the trend of thought and the current of events in regard to the mutual relations of those colonies in which we live labour loading minds are recognising the fact that, in spite of local jealousies and hostile tariffs at no distant day they must, like the provinces of New Zealand and Canada, merge their individual political life and politics in those of one great nation (hear, head-on in language and in national feeling, one in the free interchange of all that is valuable and useful within its borders, one in all that gives a potential voice in the counsels of peace, and a strong arm in the conflicts of w or VII the arguments that the statesman can marshal in favour of a united Australian nation are even more valid in favour of a united Australian Church (Applause ) Other sections of the Christian church have not been slow to own their validity, and we cannot so differentiate the interests of the parts into which our Church is divided as to w oaken the claim of those arguments on our attention These interests are embodied in mi identical faith, in iden scalpers, and an identical mission 1 Those need no definition They require no illustration They make us one, and their logical and practical issue must be organic co-operation every regiment in the British army carries alongside of the Queen's colours its own regimental colours, emblazoned with its own cypher and badge, and the record of its own n honours in the held But us well say that those regiments cannot be brigaded together to adv once in one line, and for one object, because each has its own rapid de corps, and is proud of its own history, as allege that the co-operation that is implied in federation is for the churches of Australian Vtoiian drouin is not the progress of these colonies, in the development of their material resources and of the agencies of civilisation, effacing day by day the impediments which time and space presented in yours gone by v Has not the iron path of the railway at each bound together Adelaide and Brisbane through Melbourne and Sydney Only a few years, and the enterprise of a broad statesmanship will bring Perth and Fremantle into direct touch with Rockhampton, and still more remote Townsville and Normanton Is it pro mature, then, to suppose that the time will come when the great centres of Presbyterian life and energy, now in this and the Victorian capital will it prepared to lose themselves in a fresh and higher centre, whence all may alike derive guidance and stimulus, and in which the sympathies and the loyalty of all may coin cargo i that centre must needs be local in position, but it cannot be local in its spirit and atmosphere It must be a centre of wisdom, experience, practical aptitude, acknowledged zealand established world Those bolong exclu seven neither to ago, nor population, noroxtentof territory, nor wealth of resources There are more or less the possession of a 1 and true federation is nothing else than the organised concentration and utilisation of these highest gifts, wherever found, for the consolidation, the extension, the upbuilding of one Australian Presbyterian Church It is in no narrow, sectarian spirit that we cherish these hopes, for the essentials of Presbyterian polity, the principles of constitutional and representative government, are far more widely spread in the Church than the Presbyterian name We can leave those principles to take care of them selves Great is the truth and it must provide Nor do I speak from the standpoint of a local partisan To us remote dw offers in Galilean Queensland it matters little whether the tribes go up to the banana of Svdncyorto the Jerusalem of Melbourne-road, hear-but it matters a great deal that " Ephraim should not envy Judah, and that Judah should not vex Ephraim, "-(applause)-tnat attention should not be concentrated on points of difference, on ad vantages which confer power and influence, or on disadvantages which suggest inferiority but on the means which special and distinguishing resources provide for advancing the common weal The aim of confederation is to secure this most desirable one But the question is how is this end to be attained I Certainly not by any one party grasp- ing at what belongs to another, any more than by those who are rich and increased in goods grudging their cordial help to the poor and wretched and blind and naked (Applause ) The spirit of true federation accepts the ine- qualities which Providence has made the rule of all life it recognises these at once as Incentives to greater die once and exertion on the part of those who luck, and as provocations to love and to good works on the part of those who abound 1 he riches of the A alley s and plains of Queensland, not to speak of her mountains of gold, would have remained all but unknown but for the capital and enterprise of New South Wales and Victoria, and the full strength and resources of our Presbyterian Church will never be realised I until we cease " to look each one upon his own things," and learning to " look also on the things of others." ( up please ) The days of separation are past The churches have best the State an example within our own borders we have united the dates member of Scottish, Irish, and English Presbyterianism is not the existence in growing strength of the united Press feminism of Victoria, New South Wales, and of the sister colonies a pledge that a united Prosbv Romanism of Australia is but it question of time, of practical wisdom, and of Christian fervour and charity A Hard and knotty questions have to be solved Natural susceptibilities have to be met and conciliated Mutonal guarantees and preferential rights have to be provided for But surely the faith that removes mountains, and the charity that seeketh not her own, and never faileth is sufficient for these things In those wide and fair colonies there is much land yet to be possessed, and the command is laid upon us to go up and possess it The power of this federation should be told to the utmost shores and the inmost settlements of this great land the Church should go forth with the mines, and the farmer, and the squatter, to the mountain, and the river bank, and the plains of the far interior the Church at his father's teaching him the simple faith of a free salvation through Jesus Christ, training him in the manly liberty of Christian law, and making him feel that his privileges are not the luxuries of the selfish and self-indulgent, but the riches of righteousness, which God has placed in his hands, therewith to do good and communicate What are the questions of versed rights, of preponderant influence, of relative prices that will come directly or indirectly before us in this assembly, compare with the grand interests that are confined to- our trust 2, those Australian lands, the interest of a pure Gospel, a, liberty wherewith Christ hath made us exist and a mission of mercy Huit no geographical line circumscribesJ Let it be our earnest and! united prayer in this fcdorU assembly that we may use to the " heights of this high argument, and deliberating in the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and aright, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of God," lay broad and deep at least the foundations of a platform on which there may be reared, at no distant period, a great united Australian Presbyterian Church established on the top of the mountains and exalted above the hills, and shining forth in the beauty, splendour, and attractive power of the bride in the song of songs, "1 air as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with ban- ners." (Loud applause.) On the motion of the Rev. J. K. McMILLAN (Victoria), seconded by the Rev. J. Dox (Victoria), a vote of thanks was accorded to the retiring Moderator for his opening sermon. The Rev. Dr. CAMBT>OX announced the receipt of a letter from the Rev. Dr. J. Nish, resigning his position as senior clerk of the Federal Assembly. Dr. Nish stated that his interest in federation was unabated. Dr. Cameron said he felt quite sure I hey ulldcoply regretted the absence of their friend from the Assembly. (Hear, hear.) On the motion of the Rev. J. K. McMILLAN (Victoria), seconded by the Rev. W. BAIN- (the Hunter), it was re- solved,-" That the Assembly have heard of the resigna- tion of Dr. Nish of his office of clerk with much regret, and that it appoint a committee, consisting of the ex Moderator, Mr. Laing, and the mover, to confer with Dr., Nish with a view to induce him to withdraw his resigna- tion." It was agreed that the hours of meeting for the transit c tion of business should be as follows Morning, In /m 10.30 to 2 p.m.: evening, from 7 to 10 o'clock. Some formal matters having been dealt with the Assembly 8ld ajourned until to-day.
