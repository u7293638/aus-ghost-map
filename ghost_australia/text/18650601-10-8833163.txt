LADY DON'S PERFORMANCES. Last evening a numerous audience patronized the performances at the Theatre Royal, when an attractive bill was presented, commencing with Mrs. Planche's sparkling comedietta called the Handsome Husband, which afforded so much satisfaction on Friday last. "Mrs. Wyndham" was represented by Lady Don, who sang the Grand Finale of " Joys all Surrounding." The ghost scenes from the Castle Spectre were next given when the ghost made a re-appearance, under less successful auspices than on the previous evening. The burlesque of Prince Florizel was repeated very successfully, Lady Don as the " Prince," supported by the entire company. At the conclusion of the comedietta and the burlesque, Lady Don obeyed determined calls by the delighted auditory, and her ladyship appeared before the curtain and received enthusiastic tokens of applause. The farewell performance of this highly popular company will be given tomorrow evening under the patronage of His Excellency the Governor. The pieces for this evening are The Contested Election, Casell Spectre, and Slasher and Crasher.
