TO THE EDITOH OF THE BE.VDtBO ISDEPF.NDENT. —Yours, ect, CALIFORNIA GULLY WESLEYAN. Mar. 15. SIR,—I crave a small space in your value able columns to make a few remarks on the Wesleyan Methodist Conference—the union question which was rejected on the two-third dodge. Now, sir, I think the most important vote was that of the members, whoso vote was 10,780 in favor of union agviosl 2581. But, sir, the 10,780 have lost their senses, according to some, 1 am sorry to say, of our reverend gentlemen, or false prophets in God’s name. After asking for God’s guidance in prayer, and then to ignore it —Ob, what a force! “God is not mocked.” Bow long is it since God gave theso reverends the power to judge the intellect of His children? Ac cording to the remarks of the R'*v. H. Bath his mol Per was a Wesleyan, nod his grand mother once had breakfast with John Wisloy, May God help you, Mr, Bath, to bo pure in heart, because you know that Wesley's ohnroh i« not now the same a* it was of old,seeing thot his rules nro defaced (except Rule 2); Again, Mr. Bath speaks of tho fly getting into (he throat. Well, then, 1 say, Mr. Bath, “be careful of tho fly, as if it gets into your throat it might choke you.” God does work in mysterious ways. Then, again, wo have, Mr, Blamiros talking as ono of the “moderate party.*" Ho acknowledges calling the “caucus meetings." Well, sir, I would to God that be bad the grace of God in his heart instead of in his pocket, and would acknowledge his unfaithfulness and receive tho puce salvation of the Holy Ghost which oometh from God. He seems to have tbo ministers’ salaries on tho brain, I wonder what would John Wo«Iey say? Would be acknowledge Mr. Blamires as one of bis ministers? Moy God help us, wo of weak intellect, according to Mr BUmiros.
