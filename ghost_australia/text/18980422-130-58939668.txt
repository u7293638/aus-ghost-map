"And it will come to-tight, slir, if at all,".Cody added, firmly. "Well, waanre prepared for them here, and my couriers are coming in from the camps and report'that all am'Å½ ready for an attack, though It is hard ftr any one .to,believe that the :Indians Intend'to swoop down from the mounitains at this tfmne."'., , . Night settledl down upon. the fort, with all prepared to be called to arlms'at any moment. Cody and all ils scouts were out after Sltghtfall,:gohli .on foot so as not to at tract ittention. Tierchief of scouts had gone alone, giving orders.to his men not St venture more than half a mile away from the fort, and, to thus encircle it, keeping within call of each other, and be ready to give the warning to fall back should any onenmake a discovery. The chief of scouts had Ventured a lit tle furtlher.thanl he had told his men tO go: The night was cool, but not frenz lng, and the walking was bhad, but the trail bhe was on;led'towards'the moun talns and was the only one by which the Indians would doubtless come. Suddenly he halted, for he distinctly sheard the splasli of. hoofs. He gazed fixedly ahead and saw a horseman com Ing Into view. "My Ghost Guide, as sure as death!" said the scout, and from his hiding-place he felt that he could hold upl then and there the 'weird horseman. "I'll treat him.squarely as lie has mei. But iwhy is he ciming here, I wonier?" muttered the scout Then-he called out: "Ho, Friend'.Ghost; I am Cody, and I ?m alone!"' The whivlllte horse was brughllt'to a sud den halt, and half .wheeled at the first tadrindof the scout's voice. rutitthe words seemed to reassure the rider, and he hesitated, and then came in a deep voice,tnost sepulchral in sound: "Colonel Cody, heed the warning I gave you. The red-skins are not half an bhour's ride away, and moving to attack the fort in large numbers. The camps and settlements will also be attacked at the same time." As the last word was uttered the white horseman wheeled, and rode away in the darkess as he had come. Instantly Cody turned and retraced his way hack to the circle of scouts. He gave the signal to fall bnck, anl.they. \---weret soon all'JuSt inlTide the post. "Men, the red-skins are coming. Keep a close watch, and fall back into the post ithe moment you see them approachlng. !Allwill be ready then;" and so saying the ,cout entered the stockade gate, and at once told the officer of the day that the Indians were coming. Going on to tile colonel's quarters, he told him of his meeting the ghostly gulde, and word was at once.sent round to call all the garrison silently to arms. In fifteen minutes the whole force was ready and soot flei' rte fcofl catlio in and reported that the iddiins ivert sur rounding the post. Thus the moments passed, until sud denly there was heard the tramp of rushing hoofs, and at the word of com mand a circle of flame flashed out, and hundreds of carbines and rifles rattled forth death, while the.artillery belched forth shells that Il'rst in the midst of the mass of warriors and ponies. The red-skins had made .their swoop, and expecting to: crush their foes, had suddenly been hurled back by striking \- against a wall of fire, lead, and iron, that cut them down without merry.
