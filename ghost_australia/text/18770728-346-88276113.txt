It was Bimie time ago fitted up.for the occupancy of a newly-wedded couple, but shortly after ; they moved into it the young brido died, and the building was again left vacant. Within I a few weeks past estrange sounds and Hitting | liglft« have been seen in the house; occasiou j oily ^ pale wan face would appear at one of the windows in the dead of night, and pitious wails would rssutt apparently from between thuUvivi l*ps, and then the "perturbed spirit" would wander from room to room throughout the house; as if looking for something that could .never bo found. Babylon enjoyed the sensation of having a " haunted house." Some of the young fellow3 in th« neighbor hood, however, wero not superstitious to the extent of being afraid to make an investiga tion and one night last week two or three of them concealed themselves in the building to await the "ghoBt'a" appearance. About the hour " when churchyards commence to yawn" one of the windows opened, and his ghostship entered in u very unghostly manner and com menced his usual performance, his form being just distinguishable in the d<u-kuo»s. In the middle of one of his most interesting acts the concealed persons crept softly oil all fours to the spot, and suddenly grasped him by the ankles, a proceeding which was followed by a series of terrific shrieks rory human in their tono, and indicating an agony of fear, and it was somo time before the bogus ghost was brought to the point of belioving that he had not been seized by a real one. The explanation of his proceeding is found in tho fact that a certain person was desirous of owning the house, but the proprie tor refused to part with it on the terms offerod, and this novel method was adopted by tho would be purchasor to depreciate the market value of tho property.
