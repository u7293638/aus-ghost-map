I am going to be nominated, for aldermian of tlis ward."s .d" ;" Yr. Bowser, is itposible that you nregoing to let them leiadl you into aov such foolishness ! Ithought you hlid a ore level head than that, in spite of all your mistakes." "My mistakes !" lie shouted. "I never made one in my life, except wheh I married you. Level hliead! I'd like to sea someone who carries a more level head than I do !" "Aind so you are going to be alderman?" " If I live." " But what for?" "Because it is the wish of the people. My country rails. The commities have canvassed the ward and concluded th?t I was not only the best man for the office, but the only one who stood any show against the vicious opposi tion. It isa sacrifice on my pIart, bat the true patriot must be ready to sacrifice." " I'm so sorry." "So sorry! For what? Because I have been selected above all others! Because honours have been thrust upon me! Mre. Bowser, you have never appreciated the man you married, and you probably never will." "Well, I shan't say any mere. I thinkit is a put-up job to get money out of you, and I know what a gang will be running here after you. It's your own affair, however. Don't blame me if you get left." "There you go! Always opposed to mie! I can plainly see why some men never get along. If I had a wife like some I know, ofI'd have been governor of the State long ago. I'm going to run, however, and after I'ln elected you'll probably be just mean enough to say you brought it about." I didn't say any more. As soon os he left the house next morniig I prepared for visitors; and I was not disappointed. He was hardly.out of sight before the bell rang, and I opened the door to find a dirty-looeiug fellow with his hat on his ear, who asked "Is Bowser home '" "No, sir." "Gets out pretty earle, doesn't he? -Leave: any money for me" "' o, sir." "He didn't, eli? Party specimen of a can didate he is ! Expects us to do all the figurin' fur nuthin', does he ?" " Who are you, sir?" "Who are I?" he repeated as heo slanted his hat a little more and- spit over his shoulder. "I'm the party as carries this ward in his vest pocket, I am, and if old Bowse : don't cum down liberally he gets left. Tell him tr come and see me." Nine times that iorenooin I answered the bell to'find a ward heeler or some otlher sort of political parasite on the door-step. - One of them even went so far as to ask me to pledge M?ar.Bowser to vote for him to run one of-the irty-hall elevators.. There were three; others v~iitiag for him when ie got home to dinner, anid I saw him give them mOn.ey. HIe ciie in excited and jubilant, and when I told-;him what had occurrdd, he replied: \- "Let the dear people come ! They know that I am the man to do all I can for them if I am elected, alid elected I shall be as sure as the sunrises on the day. -'What do voui.tiik ? I was talking with a prominent mail belonging to the opposition, and he said it would be no use for his party to put ,up a man againsb-me.

As soon as nominated thiere, would be no more heelers runningmafterl himi,' and a nomination meant election bv. a largo majority. I didn't say much, butI felt,: prtty: sure how it would come out.
