A REVIVALIST RUN MAD. The Kyneton Guardian records some of the incidents of a Tevival mission of the Rev. John M'Neill, 13.A. In his message recently Mr. M'Neill said that he was sometimes asked whether it was sinful to attend quadrille assemblies or dancing classes. He was not going to say whether it was wrong or not, but his text told him that they should be " sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise," and have " the earnest of their inheritance" within. He would give a cheque for £50 if they could produce any one who was filled with the Holy Ghost and yet attended dancing assemblies. If a man had the earnest of the inheritance within him, and was full up of the Holy Ghost, it would take a very strong rope and a powerful locomotive to drag him into a dancing room, where people went spinning round and round like so many idiotB, and it would be hell to hiin until he could get out again. The preacher also indulged in parable. He represented the Lord as having lost some of His flock, and as saying to. the angel Gabriel, "Gabriel, just go down to the world, and see H you can hunt them up." Gabriel started ou his mission, and reported—" Lord, I hear the shuffling of feet in here," when the Lord replied, " Oh ! none of my flock could be fouud there ; that is a ballroom.*' Mr. M'Neill concluded this illustration by expressing the hope that the Lord would never send Gabriel to look for him in a ballroom.
