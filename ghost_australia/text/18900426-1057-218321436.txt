A Woman" Rises from her Coffin. A very strange artd\ 'sensational event happened; n short 1 time ago ! in Jelzelsdorf, in Lower Austria. ' It reads like fiction (says a Vienna .correspon dent) but, nevertheless, it seems to bo perfectly true, as it was told hero by tho Burgomaster of the place himself. Tbe wife of a tradesman succumbed there at the end of last month to a lingering illness, and after tho physician had declared death had taken place the remains were conveyed to the mortuaiy. TiÂ«o lirtflhftnil wlm tinrl Inroil liia wtfn dearly, hod ordored that his wifo should bo buried with her rings, eatrings, and other jewellery on. Tno night before tbe fuueral, a good-for-nothing fellow of tho villago, who had board of this broko into the mortuary with 4ho inten tion of robbing tbe corpse. A9 ho could not draw ono of the rings off the dead woman's finger ho drew his knife to out it off. But as soon as tho edgo of tho knife penetrated tho flesh, the ap parently dead woman, who bad been in deep unconsciousness only, gavo a loud cry. Life had returned to bor, and she rose slowly in her coffin. The robber, horror-struck, rushed off as quickly as Lib feet could carry him. The woman, who was dressed in ordinary clothes, as ib tho custom iu Austria, left the mortuary and wont homo. When she knocked at tho door it was opened by the apprentice. Ho asked 11 Who is there ?" and ono can easily imagine his amazement when ho received tho answer, " It is I, tho mistress," and when he saw the woman whom he be lieved to bo dead in her coffin standing upright before him. In fact, ho was utt- rly speechless from terror and trembling. So tbe woman had to an nounce herself personally to hor hus- mcant to be present at her funeral next morning. The meeting with bini, of course, was of a still more exciting nature than with the apprentice, and it took some time before she conld convince hor husband that it it was not hor ghost who spoke to him.
