THE .ALDINE HISTORY. To the Editok. — Sir — Being one of the supposed victims as a subscriber to the above I beg to state that I am iu no way impli cated in the matter I Some two or three months ago. a pair of agents called upon me to take delivery of the above history. I declined for the following reasons : — First that I gave no order ! Second— That I signed no order, nor in any way made myself responsible ! ' But,'*said they. ' we have your order.' I said, ' produce it.' One of them held forth a document, purporting to be signed by me. Mr. Editor, I never sawjthe document before, and I am prepared to swear this in any court of justice. On Monday last another pair of agents called ia a similar manner. I refused to have anything to do with them, in the shape of taking de livery, but said '* if ;jn pnt them (tbe books) on my premises you do so at your own risk!' The outcome was that one of them stealthily placed them on my door step, as if he was a receiver of stolen goods, and dropped the parcel like a hot potato, at the same time being as white in the face as the 'ghost' ia ' Hamlet,' and stalked way like a guilty thing. By inserting these facts, for they are facts, and ' impugn them whoso list.' I am, Sir, &c;, WlLtTAM BASSETT. Bassett Town, AuguBt 27, 1890.
