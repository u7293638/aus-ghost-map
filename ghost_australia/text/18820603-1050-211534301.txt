Gis ( cori- firmeri appoiutmerit will be looked', on. as ' coriiB rmation of the' acceptance at ..Gome ' of?? the' lntamous charges laid 'the Pontiff , against the/, late , Bishop" Quinn and the Irish priests. The service for consecration is of such an elaborate and fatiguing character that although it waB begun at 3 o'clock, it lasted into the usual, hour for vespers at St. Mary's, and the usual evening ser vice had to be oiriitted. . The absence, however, of the vesper collection-was amply compensated vby the charge of one shil ling for admission to the dedication. It is a most wonderful and wearisome piece of acting, four hours long — the oath, the , suffrages, the so-called examination/the mutual benedictions — the pastoral staff — the oil put on and wiped off, etc., etc. — dismal, dreary, and foolish. There is one thing which strikes .the' observer, who can perietrate the Latin veil i in which the whole, is enveloped, namely, that although the -Elect (is asked many things concern ing his belief and teaching ; with i the one exception of the promised , allegiance to tb'euPope as successor "of St. Peter, i he pledges himself to not a Bingle one, of the peculiar - doctrines of the papal, -church, hei doctrines, off /the-i protectant churches are , those i ori which) alone be is questioned. 1'heiteaching-ofjthe Holy i Scriptures, .and their 1 inspiration, the incarnation-;Qf the Soiri';of God--the: , relation, of -ithe Father andjthe Holy Ghost, etc., just as in, opr creeds and articles. Not a word is asked qr, i answered respecting purgatory, saint Worship, Madonna mediator; pepance, in dulgence,, extreme .unction, or in fact any 6'ther popish doctrine; What) is.the.irea- 8on of this? , The ffac.t is r.that , this and many of the services of the pontificale Ho- inanum date from .parly,. times, .before the modern papal . doctrines were invented, rind the church in -using- them testifies against, herself. The only chance of keeping .-the i fact- from the. people is to hide it in, a dead: language. We do not care - again to refer- .to (the oath which is takenati this service. , "W.e have never yet beeri able; to - get, a clear, denial that the oath is taken here exactly as in the, pon tificale, and therefore including the words "/heretics, schismatics , and rebels against his : holiness I will to my . utmost power persecute 1 and attack.", Mr. Duncan (.un dertook to say on the, occasion of the consecration of Bishop Lanigan, that those words were, -by... a . special, grace of, the Pope, allowed to. be omitted -in -Eugland and America — in deference, no doubt, to Protestant opinion. But, he would not say, -when challenged, that .the, words, were omitted at Goulb.urn.; and (we .cannot say that they ivere. omitted in Dr.-iCani's.case. Weihelieve they were not .omitted, i- .At all events, the remainder of . the j oath -is stilliw.orse, as.it is really nothing-more nor less than the for m ,by which .vassals , bound themselves to fight for their lords, laga-piBt all-comers — " That they shall observe the apostolic commands with all , their power, and cause them to be observed by others ; that they will aid in maintaining and. de fending the Roman Papacy and the roy alties of St. Peter againBt every, man," Ac. The royalties of St. Peter havelobg passed away! but they dream of them still ; arid ,Sy this, oath each, bishop binds himself fhe/'foe of the King arid 'people of Italy. 'By the way, these very ,, words, royalties of;1 St. Peter, are themselves ari.iristarice ot the dishpnesly of that Church! Id the regorian decretals! the words stand, ' regulas sanctorum patrwri the /rules of 'the holy fathers iri f the newer, oath, they are changed . ririto ; regalia 1 ' 'sancti Petri " — the royalties of St. Peter. Por- gery and fraud— forgery and fraud—we meet: them everywhere' iri' that system of 'lies. ' : :' ' ' r" ' ' -I i if! > ; « t -
