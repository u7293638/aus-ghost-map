OUR GOLD-FIELDS STONEY CREEK"DIGGINGS. (From the Bathurst Free Press.) On Wednesday morning we received a visit from a gentleman who had just returned from Stoney Creek, bringing with him upwards of two hundred ounces of gold which he had purchased at that place He also informs us that a party connected with the Bank of New South Wales, who came over from the Meroo, purchased upwards of £2000 worth, on Saturday last, and, but for want of money, could have purchased a considerably larger quantity This account given by our friend is on the whole of a very encouraging character, and inclines us to believe that there is a fair prospect of the richness of the gold-fields in the Wellington district being properly tested Though the number or fresh arrivals is by no means so great now as it was a row weeks since, they are fewer leaving The population, including about 230 Chinamen num- bers about 2000, who are scattered over an area of at least twenty miles, and now that the drones and the waiters on Providence have taken their departure for places more suitable to their peculiar habits and temperaments, consists principally of men able and willing to work until success attends their labours From the absence of any escort and the unwillingness of the miners to sell more gold than requisite to supply their immediate wants, no estimate can be formed as to the quantity obtained from this field, however, there is reason to believe that a much larger quantity has been found than the public are aware of Ever) thing at the present is very quiet, robberies or outrages of any kind being of rare occurrence This may be perhaps owing to the presence or police who have been stationed there lately As if with a full determination to make the present obnoxious license system the means of checking the development of the gold-fields of this colony, notices have been issued that the law would be strictly enforced, and it has been so in several instances In consequence of this a body of Chinamen, who were either unable or unwilling to pay the license fee, have shifted from the field to some unknown quarter in the direction of the Mookerwa The increased demand for flour at Molong has raised the price to £40 per ton, with the prospect or a further rise Provisions generally, are, however, very reason able, owing to the large quantity on the ground We have been furnished with the fellow ing communication from a gentleman who has

straightforward and temperate manner in which you have treated the question at issue, I am induced to give my reasons for A visiting the place, and the impressions formed, after using every available means to get at honest truth The accounts in circulation appealed to me so extravagant, and, on the other hand, so directly counter, that I determined to visit the place, and make it my) sole object to get all the information possible, and no far JL-, practicable to ascertain the opinions of the best informed miners upon the a various matters which the question involves On my way up I met from ten to twelve return diggers, the majority of whom appeared physically) unfit for the toil and di udgery orgold- dipging I passed about a like number on their way up, but not to the land of promise, because they were already diane intended by their returning friends, and from that moment had made up their minds, although they would fain persuade themselves otherwise, not to dig a second day unless they could at once hit upon big nuggets 1 h field around Stoney Creek is admitted to he very extensive, even by the most sceptical The decidedly) h app) appearance of the people bespeaks

The mass upon the creek and within say five square miles, are I think, truthfully estimated at about 2000 souls, and they appear to consist of bona-fide digger s The place has been needed of the " never do wells " Every party I applied to had gold to sell, but would not part with it at less than a tip-top price Once a week gold is sold, but just sufficient to cover current expenses Extreme caution and scores are apparent in all the diggers' transactions, yet, any known, respectable person, may e easily satisfy himself that three-fourths of the miners are doing well, and many of them saving money, whilst others are making fortunes On the creole it is undisputed that almost every) day large quantities of gold are sent across the country One of the fortunate diggers, in reminding a party of the risk of cam ing down his own gold, expressed himself quite at case about it affirming, that begging a meal at one place on the road, and offering part of a swag for sale at another, are the best means yet concocted for taking a large nugget to market in safety, adding that he know of the of lots, one 28 lbs, and another weighing upwards of 40 had been dispatched in like manner, the week previous The s uno was stated by several parties to be a fact and that one man had then in his possession 1100 ounces, the result or five weeks' labour The truth or these statements admits or

is the miner's only present protection, which renders the task of getting information really difficult, yet I cannot imagine the possibility of an) unprejudiced person, after a careful investigation upon the spot, coming to any other conclusion than that Stoney Creek bids high to become the most productive gold-field that has yet been discovered in New South Wales. It must always happen that out of the mass that usually rush to a newly) discovered gold- field, there will be some unfortunates Disappointment to a considerable extent must result at Stoney Creek, where the gold is so irregularly distributed, but a decided majority are doing well Those who represent themselves as unfortunate diggers are composed of the following-the penniless, who are starved out before having it shadow of a chance to realise anything, the physically weak, the incapacitated from other c raises, the 117), who w on threw, the drunkard, and last not least, the loafer figure conspicuous!) in bringing up the rear One of the above lot, the Stoney Creek ghost of misfortunes, may have had its resurrection
