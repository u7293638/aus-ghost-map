DINGO'S LAST WORDS. Oh, the dingo's wild, untamable and free, And the tame curs soap at him in fain; Critics, Observers or whatever they may be, Or poets with a softened braio. The poet will improve with time no doubt,. And we'll let him buDt for rhymes io peace: But Observer and the ether are eager for a boat And would like to have a dingo's fleece. Observer first began other people's faults to Bat he cant bear a baiting in bis turn; And the parson's such a dude, be thinks it very rude, Any faults in tbe Argus to discern. Observer -is officious, and he thinks it very [f you drink a friendly glass at an inn; He's a prudish sort of gent, and he'll nev be content Till Parliament declares it a sin. If Observer had bis way in less tban half day All tbe inns in the land he would close. No more wine would be made, the vioeyards he'd invade And plant thistles where the vine now grows. It's more than likely he, at one time used to be A toper of the reiy worst kind; The man that has been foroed from diink to be divorced Is always to bigotry ioclined. I've had my bit of fon, I've very uearly done, And when they read these lines with their toast, Observer aud his friend, with me have had tbeir end Fcr Dingo will have given up tbe ghost.
