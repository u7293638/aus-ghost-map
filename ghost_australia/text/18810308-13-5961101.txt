." ABOVE THE SPEAKER. BY TuiomEus. I 11 Timotheus placed on high." The poet has declared that 50 years of Europe are better than " a cycle of Cathay and certainly the three hours after 9 o'clock on Thursday evening were worth the prior three weeks of the Reform debate thrice over The previous Speeches were a weariness One orator jogged after another as steed follows steed in the circus the piebald as good as the grey, and no better Mr Laurens was equal to the best and the boat was nearly as bad as Mr Laurens But after the call of the House the star rider of the Opposition bounded into the ring Mr Gillies chose his hour, like the Parliamentary artist that he is The galleries were naturally full, because of the expected important division, and the call of the House had brought every member to his place, so that instead of the depressing influence of a few members droning out the evening, there was the excitement caused by a crowded Chamber and by the expectation of an event A full Parliamentary audience is rare, and the occasion had its orator There is a con series of testimony that Mr Gillies was heard at his best It is not only his tones, clear as a bell, and his logical sentences and his air of candour and conviction, that enchain attention when the member for Rodney speaks His addresses are " understanded by the people He has the faculty of the successful barrister at Nisi prius of making the same point a dozen times, and each time so varying it that while the idea is again grasped the identity is not recognised On this occasion his text was that the radical leaders for three years have insisted that it is dangerous to strengthen the Upper House by widening its basis, without at the same time restricting its powers, and that in a day they have abandoned this principle His Second contention was that men who had utterly mistaken what the country wanted before have no right to be obstinate and dogmatic now Both sides must submit to be taught by experience These points served Mr Gillies for an hour and to all appear- ances might have served him with equal effect for another The Opposition were jubilant while he was on his legs Each man experienced the delight of hearing the case stated as he would like to have put it himself It cannot be said that Even the ranks of Tuscany Could scarce forbear a cheer, for as a matter of fact a majority more mute and motionless than that on the Ministerial benches was never witnessed before The dejected looks of hon members to the right were enough of themselves to convince a stranger to Victorian politics that there must be something in the argument of Mr Gillies that the radical party has raised Mr Vale had been reserved especially to follow Mr Gillies, and Mr Berry took the trouble to prepare notes for the use of the Attorney-General in reply The member for I Fitzroy had risen from a sick bed, and though he stood up boldly to his antagonist, there is no second opinion as to whom the honour I belong "In debate said one Minister to an Opposition leader, after the evening was over, " Duncan Gillies is only second to Graham Berry " I will agree with you, was the reply, " if you say that Graham Berry is second only to Duncan Gillies The second reading debate was a sham, but not so is the discussion on the proposal to refer the Reform Bill to a conference The vigour of the speeches shows that there is reality in the movement Ministers meant to put an end to the discussion on the Thursday evening Mr Berry duly announced this determination, and there were clamours for a division But before an hour had passed over it was clear enough that some of the Ministerial supporters had minds to make up and that the motion to adjourn would have gone against the Government, and once this fact is ascertained no one is more courteous than the head of the Ministry Mr Berry gave way as if it was a real pleasure to him to be able to oblige the Opposition The hon. gentleman will obtain his majority against the conference no doubt By Tuesday he will have rallied the waverers, on the plea that a party vote must be taken But in that case the Ministerial majority will not be more than the half dozen and if party were discarded and the House left to vote on the merits of the question the conference would probably take place, and reform might be settled before the month is out Two points weigh with members in favour of holding the conference now The one is that time will be saved There will be no occasion to discuss Sir Bryan O'Loghlen a amendments in committee, and Mr W Dixon s The other is that the bill would go to the conference as the bill of the whole House Whereas after the discussions in committee and the third reading division it will be the bill of a party The league policy, which could only be hinted at when the session opened, is now large as the rising moon at harvest in the bill as it stands the league members have made the last concession If made ration means compromise then Mr Long more undertakes that Mr Patterson shall eat every word he has uttered on the subject He and his colleagues are to be denounced as traitors This sort of thing falls flat upon the House Whether or not there is likely to be any response to it in the country, Mr Longmore presumably knows best, but there are politicians who profess that it would fall still matter there As to Ministers, they have not yet said one word against compromise Their argument has been simply directed against offering terms now A report which may be accepted as correct is that already Ministers are substantially agreed that they will take a small property qualification for members of the Council, and a £10 rating franchise As the Service bill proposed a £10 ownership and a £20 ratepaying franchise, distinctions are likely to become fine drawn and if party ties can for once be forgotten we may yet see the Assembly united on a reform measure the league members excepted In Parliament the joint leadership of the Opposition is looked upon as a wise arrangement The nomination of Mr Francis is regarded as a pledge to the country that no crusade against protection enters into the counsels of the constitutional party at this juncture Out of doors the partnership in thought to savour of weakness, and the selection of either the one candidate or the other would have been better appreciated A ballot was taken, but the voting was not an nounced It is known who had the majority A section of members could talk about the press until judgment day, and in all probability would have a great deal to Bay on the subject afterwards They were all on the spot on Wednesday, eager to pour out their unpremeditated eloquence The amusement comes in when it is remembered who these hon gentlemen are There are members who never indulge in personalities or insults, but debate the questions before the House, and who would not so much as dream of violence, or of attacks upon the innocent and the helpless out of doors Mr Gillies, Mr Murray Smith, and Mr Wrixon are the first names that occur to memory These and other members have not a word of complaint to utter about the press, but If there is a member conspicuous for the old fashioned vices of " brawling and evil speaking he is the first to contend that the newspapers are course Mr Mason has some little reputation in this way Mr Gaunson is known to fame as an offender, and if there is an attack upon the press, either Mr Mason leads the van and Mr Gaunson brings up the rear guard, or Mr Gaunson leads and Mr Mason follows, with Mr Longmore sandwiched between them This is human nature George Eliot records that when the outburst occurred at Milby against the introduction of evening service, two delegates offered themselves to visit the rector and represent the intellect and morality of the village The intellect was personified in Mr Dempster, who was an ignorant drunkard, the morality in Mr Budd, whose way of life was Boards less Perhaps the situation on Wednesday was a little more farcical than usual. The Chief Seen try expressed the suspicions of his party about the integrity of Supreme Court juries Mr Longmore described the Chief Justice as a fraud Mr Bowman affirmed of his own knowledge that magistrates are bribed. And the hon gentlemen individually and collectively complained that if The Argus criticised the Ministry it " libelled the colony The idea that reducing the administrators of justice is really " libelling the colony never occurred to one of these hon gentlemen Mr Mirams was strangely moved His declaration of the terrible things he contemplates when he has " made sure of a jury was dramatic He waved the umbrella so close to the head of Mr Laurens that that rival financier was glad to leave the spot, and the Speaker, it is understood, has under consideration whether he shall not enforce the picture gallery rule of requiring sticks, parcels, etc to be given upon entering the chamber Still, there is a deal of method in Mr Mirams " I spent a little fortune on counsel, and yet I lost the case, says the one litigant in the story "What responds the other, rubbing his hands, I put my money on the jury Mr Mirams keen as the secretary of the League should be-knows exactly whom to make sure of Many a vote has the hon. gentleman made BUTO before now We may yet hear of proper representations addressed to a foreman But the member to be most commiserated is Mr Fincham He heard one member charge The Argus with untruth, and he could not conceal his sympathy He listened to Mr Longmore accusing the Age of publishing the greatest falsehoods ever written, and he sighed deeply, as one who would say, " Too true His heart burned within him, and he spoke Even Timotheus, he said, " is got at sometimes and the mournful accent laid on the word "even told its own tale He had no hope left now Faith has departed from him Charity is dead When he could believe in none else, there was still "Timotheus, and now even that refuge is gone " Et la BY the Land, gathering his robes about him, Mr Fincham gives up- not the ghost, but the press decently It would be idle to speculate upon the causes of the catastrophe At some periods all men are pessimists David cried in his haste thus anticipating the manners of the As sembly that all men are liars The day came when Hamlet lost all his mirth, fore went all custom of exercise, and affirmed that in men he found no delight whatever One of the poets of the century writes 1 of all the creatures under heaven's wide scope, He Is most hopeless Who his d once most hope And most beliefless that had most bello You Here, again, is Mr Fincham A hot Wind often occasions these bouts A politician of Queen Anne mentions that when the east wind blew ' Then to some coff chouse I stray For news the means of a day And from the hipped discourses rather That politics go by the weather Generally it is the liver that is to blame and in these cases with proper treatment one may reasonably anticipate a recovery To cure the mind's wrong bias spleen Some recommend the bowling green, Some hilly walks All exercise King but a stone the giant dies Laugh and be at all Moukcys 1 a\ e been Extreme good doctors for the spleen A course of shower baths, accompanied with friction of the skin , another top score in the annual cricket match and so on, and we shall have the original Mr Fincham back again reading his papers with an intelligent pleasure and replying to the next Long more diatribe with a hearty assurance that Timotheus at all events, can never be got at _^______
