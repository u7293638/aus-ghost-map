HI-eX did not appear to relislhthe remembrance, and bade me be quiet raither roughly. The fact that lie appeared a trille. uneasy only incited me to further effort in the same directidn; and I repeated some stories of supernatural visita tions,-each increasing in horror, until at length hIt fairly begged me to hold my peace. I took a malicious pleasure in still further arousing his fears, at. which I inwardly laughed.. Finally he said abruptly, "There is no use. lishing hieirewe are catching nothing but cold. - Come on ; let us get on the beach and inakeforhome.: I'am all in ashiver.". After some conversation we started; - in fact a cold. wind had arisen; ind it was now past midnighlt. . ,The witching hour of nighit;when churcli: yards yawn and sheeted dead arise and walli the earth."'I repeated these lines aloud as I led the way to a cave near by; in 'which.we took shelter. "~For goodness sake stop your confounded nonsense about ghosts :and :such-like things," he rather angrily said, but I could see. him glancing nervously on either side iand behind him. In fact'- it was evident- he was greatly frightened. '" It was just right bleforie us, ii that narrow cleft -in' that rock, that the lod): was', found, swaying back and forwards with'the action'of the water,as .if 'she wieie still" alive, although headlessi. :What would-you: think, if, ee were to seeiher now?" : : :: "' Hold. your tongue, will'you I: will not stay here another' moment,""and` away he went at a rapid pace up the narrow footpath, a:nd I followed. We had got about half way'up, when he' caught hold of me wÂ·ith a terrified stait, aind pointing down he gasped out, S"See there what's that? ..Lord have' mercy uponius l There she is !' I turned and looked, and as I am" a; living man I saw the form of a woman, imagedin a white and glowing vapour, which rose and fell in a bright light, clear and bluish like: the electric light, although not so brilliant. The form increased and diminished; rising up like a column, and. again sinking down to about the human height, yet always retaining the' outlines of a headless female form; clad. in white and ,waving glittering raimilent. To say that I was startled would not be all the truth. A cold, clammy dew stood on my forehead, antd my hair seemed to stand erect. My companion was completely paralysed with terror. After a few moment's pause, I took out a pair of opera glasses, and had a fuller view of the apparition, which only seemed clearer and nearer thanbefore. " It must hae lbeen my nervousness caused me to miss mycoat-pocket; and drop the glasses, which tell over the cliff and dashed on the rocks nearly at the foot of the figure, which never stirred at the sound. 'We had seen enough for the time, and ascended the-rest of the steep path in less time, I thilk; tlian it was ever done before.. We had niot- advanced.far on our ivay when I observed the figiire vanislh in an instant suddenly as a gas' jet when extinguished. But when vwe reached the top it Was there again, swaying and quivering brightly as before. .. To say that we got home rapidly is a very mild way of putting it, but we agreed noti?to speak to anyone of whatwe hadil seen. It 'was only a few days after, when we heard it spokei 'of-others' had seen it as well as us, 'and their, descriptioin was exactly in accord with ours. 'Tie subject was metitioned alta friendly meeting. I was present, and oneoflmy friends 'roposed we should all go down together, ind see this strange :phenomenon.
