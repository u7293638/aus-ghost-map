LCCAt ANB GENERAL, AN* OLD DODGE REOIVIVIUS.-Â friend of ours, reading not many mi es from Wind- sor Post Office, W39 waited upon one day läst week by a polished individu il, who, in a most plausible manner, conveyed the sur- prising nert-s fiat Aw wife knev a sister of our friend's residing in a L'indon suburb ; that his wife saw this sister two years ago in ve rv poor circumstances-so m Heh so thai; she (the plausib e one's wife) lent her £10. Oar friend-who, by the bye, is a man of good family connections, and his held in several p arts of tire world very h in lUrable and impor'ant positions, was considerably excited at this news-it was so new tj him to hear from a complete stranger that a very dear sister was hard up-and gave this ret tiler of news some encouragement tu proceed further with his narrative. Ii2 did so ; and in the course of his recital, men- tioned tile fact of his wife being an accom- plished woman and an excellent linguist: concluding by asking our friend for the loan of £lo9, and extending an invito to Iiis country residence away up on the hills whether the Himalayas, the Pyrenees, or the Australian Alps, is immaterial. Our fri&nd; was feverish with a desire to know m ire of his sister, and to hear from the accomplished lady's own lips more particularly of the circumstances under which they had met in London ; and he, therefore, got himself behind two well trained nags, used to climb« :ng hills, and made for the direction of the plausible one's country mansion. He found it. The polished plausible one met him at th.s gate, and the greeting lae gave the niau from the lowlands was limp and sid indeed. His face had not the expression of exuberant j »y-hardly of welc one : it was pale green, necked with yellow (those who have been in the Eist and have seen the first symptoms of cholera will understand the tint) - he looked os if he suffered from un maladie de foi. The fact is he teas slightly indisposed-his visitor's apparition was so sudden and " promiscuous like." The accomplished lady was interviewed ; and receiving en- couragement from a casual remark, our iriend \- wiio, by the bye, knows more languages than most men know of their own, began a ! conversation in the language of Li B¿L'e j Fiance. Madame did not, however, corc j preh'-u 1-her Fre mb was rusty-it was so many years ago since she was in " Paree'' ; shí could parle* vous much better a la Ang'ais. " Vety wed then, we'll put our French aside," said our friend, " we'd have our corrohbjrre in le langue d' Espagne (it wi!l he observed that two strangers were also pres- ent, and it Wis on that account, as well as to spare the lady, that he suggested thase 1 iiiguages in which, he had been informed, she was proficient). Alas ! mitters were even worse, for M adame couldn't get up ever, a ghost of a decent sentence in the sonorous, liquid language of Cervantes-a language in which, of all others, our friend excels, li was pitiable ! and the confusion that followed was such that we had better draw the curta:a over the sid sc¿ne. It was a bad case of " try ou," and our friend, and his two com- panions, descended the hills to leveLer country-too fall to Say much; and he, a: any rite, a wiser-and. ¡et us hope, a shrewder man. At any rate, his opinion of Iiis fellow mm has not been greitly elevated ; and no doubt when the next poli-hed stranaer comes slung and asks him fora loan of_£lQx> on the strength of his wife's linguistic attain- ments, he will politely, but firmly, give kin* a heave offering, and consign him to thî abode of imposters an J liars.
