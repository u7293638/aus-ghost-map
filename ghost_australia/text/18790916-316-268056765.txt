But, all 1 she. thought, us the long, slow days wore on, if she were only with him again—if she could only look upon his face once more, he would know all without the telling.. : There was another reason.

She turned away with'a long,shuddering sigh. Hope - was dead . within. her. Matthew Enckson had; gone out to ier, little . world into another, of which she knew nothing. He would have been nearer if he had been dead. Once m a wnile, as the years went on,: at rare intervals, news of him came to Eysdyk: " He was well,; he had fair wages, thoughgold-.wasnot to be had forthe gathering in America any more than m'England; he had been promoted and had charge of a gang of men. At length there was a long interval of' silence: Then came floating, rumours of ill; then after awhile aletter m a strange hand-writing; : a letter to his uncle who had died three weeks before it came. There ha«t been a bad accident in the mine—an explosion; and in the effort to save others, Matthew Ericksoa had himself received dangerous injuries. No one thought he could live. But now, after months,, he was Blowly recovering, if recovery it could be called. For he was blind., Thepoisonous vapours had destroyed his sight. >•. It was five years since he went away—; five years that had brought many changes to Meg. It was a sobered, thoughtful woman, not a hot-tempered girl, who knelt liy Widow Neale's side a week after the letter came, and said: . • - " Mother, have I, been a good, faithful child - to you . these .many years ?"

But I' wish-you were married, Meg. I've saved up a good penny for.your dowry, you.know, that." « Yes," she said, her hps quivering. " Whatever-was, the reason you did not have Matt Erickson?'? her mother went on, querulously. " You'd have been a proud wife, now,,and he here, hale and hearty." •,, With a. quiok gasp, Meg threw . up both, arms, ana- then .buried her face, in her mother's lap; sobbing vehemently while the latter sat aghast, half frightened at the storm, she had unwittingly raised. At last she, tonohed her daughter's hair softly. Don't, Meg," she, said. " I did not meanit " Jlct Meg only drew the wrinkled hands about her neck and let her. tears flow unchecked.

But here's your. Bteamer if you're going up that way." Her heart sank like- lead.- Would she ever, ever reach the end ? All day, and day after day she sat silently in the bow of the " boat, gazing steadily forward. On, on, till Erie was-passed—on through lonely St. Clair with its softly rounded shores and fairy islands—then up through Lake Huron, still struggling up, as it were, pas'' • towering, frowning heights,' past stretches of interminable forest; past rooky head- . lands, past sandy beacheB, through, tortu- ' ous channels and - devious: ways, into the wild rapids of. the Saut St. Mane.'
