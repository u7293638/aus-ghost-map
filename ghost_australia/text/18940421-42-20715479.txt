A Pantless Army. In the fall of 1861, at Fort Donelson, U.S.A., where there were only some half-a-dozen com- panies fortifying and drilling, the men had not yet given up white shirts and underclothes, and every night undressed and went to bed. One midnight, while all were sleeping soundly, the long roll began to beat in the company stationed on the river bank. At once there was a stir in the camp ; officers were calling the men to fall in, and there was much hurrying to and fro. Captain Beaumont was always careful about his dress when on duty, and even now he quickly put on his uniform, buckled on his sword, and stepped out of his tent to take com mand of his company. His men sprang up and grasped their muskets, and formed in line in front of their tents ; but every man of them had forgotten to put on his trousers, and there they stood in the starlight, in their nightclothes, like " sheeted ghosts," trembling with cold and excitement. As the captain stepped out, and his eye glanced along the line, his sense of propriety got the better of his military ardour, and he shouted out his first command : " Con- found your foolish souls, go and put on your breeches!" The situation dawned on the men, and, with shouts of laughter, they prepared for battle by putting on those needful articles of apparel. After all, however, it was a false alarm.
