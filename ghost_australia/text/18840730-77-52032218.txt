On a nn.-tion for adjournment Mr. HAMIL- TON called attention to a. statement recently Wade by tho Miniskr for Works willi refer- ence to Mr. Hodgkinson, and ashed whether that gentleman had been dismissed.

After a day or two I got tired of laying down, and told the atten- dant to bring mc a chair that 1 might sit on the verandah. Hi» reply to my request will do more to enlighten the Committee upon one of tile great wants of the institution than any Ihiiig 1 could write. He «aid-"There is but one clinic suitable for you in the place-a man who sutlers iront epileptic (its is now using it. 3 will see if he has done with it, and bring it to you." I replied, "No; do not dis- turb that man, be wants it more than 1 do. Are you sure there are no more ehair^ like it in the establishment?" " Positive," he said ; " there was at one time twelve, the rest ure broken, one only re- nnins. " lleing in a rejecting mood, my thoughts dwelt upon this chair, and its eleven lost brothers. I came to two conclusions concerning them ; firstly, that the Committee in funner times must have thought twelve of these chairs desirable for thc comfort of the patients; and secondly, on account of so many bein;.' broken, they would bc weakly put : 1=l:i^y^t\w^ n.\\.,thr,.<:I«wp n'id na*ty prin- ciple for sale, not for use. lo verify this last idea Ï told thc attendant to bring in thc chair if it was nut in use. He did so, and 1 fin«' before mc what is termed a squatter's chair, a fragile structure built of pine, with a cheap hagging material for the back. One side of it was broken. Some enterprising genius had lapped a piece of hoop- iron around the break in thc hope of saving it, from following its lost kindred. A futile cflbrt. Its days are numbered, soon not a ghost of a chair will remain. I told the attendant to take it away again as I WUB aflraid to sit down in it. He picked it up tenderly, and with cave, as though he recognised to the full its invalid Btatc, and took it gently away ; this was the last I saw of the sorrowful looking object. After describing this chair, it is not necessary to tell the Committee, they want a chair of hardwood with iron rods running along thc rails, to hold thc sides together ; after thc fashion of the top nnd tho bottom nings of a ladder ; with a strong canvas back. This chair will last. The Governor of the Institu- tion will see that at a glance. I leave it in tlu-ir hands. "While ut thc Institutinn, I had thc pleasure of lying upon ono of- the beds recently, presented by Mr. Morgan. Every time 1 turned in it, 3 thanked my stars that such a man as Morgan lived. 1 had a good oppor- tunity of judging what the old beds were like, two of tlie best lay on a sparc bedstead by my aide. Oil, ye Gods, if these were the bosfc, what were the worst like ? Mr. Morgan deservís io be commended. He no doubt cunio to the Hospital, saw the want of beds but J id nut go away, saying " Ï'our Devils, how I pity you !*' He put Iiis hand in his pocket and relieved the want at once. Deeds like this have a more humanising effect upon our race, thc» all thc r-emioiir- ever preached. If more of our rich ne», would follow Mr. Morgan's lead, they would do niu*'h to bridge thc gulph between poverty, and wealth. [After complimenting the doctor and at- tendants our correspondent concludes :] I take this opportunity of thanking the doctor, dispenser, and attendant, tor their kindness to me while in their care.
