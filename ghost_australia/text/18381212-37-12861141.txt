E2¿ TRACTS. I RELIC WORSHIP.- ST. VALENTINE'S DAY. The Church of Rome, it with no other view than the ungodly traffic in "the blood of the Saints," has been very busily engaged, since eman- cipation, with the importation of the dead bodies, mouldering bones, and other relics of her supposi- tious saints and martyrs We lately exposed two superstitious investments of capital in this line of trade, viz ; the sacred relics of St Peter and St Paul, and of St Nicholas, invoiced to this country by the late Henry, Cardinal of York, the last pre- tender in the right line to the British throne, and the arrival of the precious bale of St Modesta's body and blood in the city of Waterford a few months since We did not imagine we should have been called upon again (at least so soon) to notice this abominable traffic on the credulity of our countrymen, but the letter of the Rev John Spratt, of the Carmelite Convent, in Whitefriar street, addressed to the editor of the Globe,which has just come to our hands by the mail which in- rived this morning, leaves us no alternative but to recur to the subject, or appear to give up for lost that cause on which we are so anxious to disabuse the minds of our Roman Catholic fellow subjects We have therefore to call public attention to the pious fraud practised on the ignorance and super- stition of our Roman Catholic fellow citizens m the Carmelite chapel of Whitefriar-street, whither, it seems, the monks of that order have imported, direct from the sacred crypts of his Holiness the Pope, the body or sacred relics of that blessed saint who has hitherto been so devoutly worshipped by the youth of both sexes on the 11th of Eebtu aiy in each year, being St Valentine's day This impious imposture Futlici Spratt has un dertaken, openly and m the face of the Protestant public, to defend and justify in the fallowing terms - " TO TUT EOTTOR OF Tilt CtOllH " Carmelite Convent, Dublin, Ni» IS, 1S37 " Su-As you ha\c followed some ot the anti Citholte joutuils ni expressing disgust al 'the translation of the body of St Valciitinus, Muityi, from Rome to Dublin,'und lune lent the uid of your piess to the usual misrepiescntation of Ca- tholic doctrine respecting the relies or saints, per- mit mc, through the medium of your columns) to ny a few wouls upon the subject " Those who deny the communion of saints, ' which theï rcpcit in then creed,' will costly deny the doctune ot ages concerning the veneration of saints Those who pay no icspcct to their own bodies, but, like the voluptuous and adultcious ' Riformers', tient them as beasts, may indulge in then jccis at Ihc bodies of the saints, but those who act eontiary must ever hold their remains and 1 niemorv in veneiation ' Knowing with the apostles that ' the saints shall judL,c the ivoild', whilst the apostles shall j jdgc angels (1 Coi vi, 3, ¿,) because, bring ' uus'icd mid sanctified, and justified in the name of out Loul Tesus Christ and the spuit of God (ibid 11), then bodies arc the members of Chust,' (15 v)-'their lumbers temples of the Holy Ghost-who is on them whom they hive dom God, and not ot their own -bought with a deai puce- gloiilynig and beal- ing God m their bodies,' (ibid 19, 20 v ), and because although they have been sown natuial bodies, they shill rise incorruptible , sown in dis honoui shall rise in gloiy, although sown m weakness shall use in power (1 Cor x\ , 4d, 41) , 'those who blaspheme «hut they do not know,' (3 Petei ii, 12) linville, no sunts ol then own, may ' lauah' and ' seofi' at the absurdity of talk- ing ab jut tches in these ' enlightened days,' and, like you, su, may say, ' it is too late m the duy for this stud , and pttiuding it bcloic the public at present, only gives a batidle to the evci-\i¡,ilant enemy ' Whilst I tear not respectable publicity, 1 denv haung given euculation through any hawking medium of the translation alluded to , that has been done hi the re\ tiers of sncied things toi their own vile pin poses, the scoilcis of old ' laughed' at the respect that was paid to the bones ot the prophets The rcvilcis ol Tesus Christ and Ins apostles likewise laughed at the nurneles they perfoinied by ' things the most lowly and contemptible,' and we line the testi- mony of the best lnstoiuns tint the holy fathers and sainte 1 doctors ot the chuich were called (as t*itholies me now called) by the impious, 'adoicis ol duH nun's bones' on uecount ot the icspect they paid to sacred relics ' But all those ' laughs, jeers, and scoßs' did not pre cut the tuithiul in ull nges fiom honoring the icniaius of the just " J. bus in the hook of Kings we aie told that ' Ehseus stiuck the watcis ot the Joiduu with the mantle of Elias, and they were diudc t luther and thither and Ehseus passed ovei ' Ami (in Ibid, eh xiii,-. 20,21,) wc lead that when ' Lhseus died, some that wcic burjing a m m saw the rovers and cost the body into the sepulchre of Ehseus, and when it hud touched the bones of Lliseus, the man caine to lite and stood upon his feet ' And as the scoffers no doubt will . luugh' at all this, and at the translations ot the bones of ft Valetittnus, thty ma) also ' laugh' at ' the lolly' of Moses, ' who took Joseph's bones with him be- cause he bath adjuied the children ol Israel, say- ing, God shall visit you, cairy out my bones from hence with you ' (Exodus xui, 19, 20, also Gen xxiv. 26) And if the scollet» wish to * laugh' more they have only to tuin to2ml l'malepomenon, or (Protestant veis ) Chron v , 2-6, where they will find not merely all the ancients-princes of the tribes, and heads of families, * but all the priests and Lévites with King Solomon,' translat- ing the inanimate aik-and, what is moie, God honored this translation so much by a miraculous cloud, for the gloiy of the Lotd filled the house of God ' (Ibid, ver 14 ) No doubt if oui modern 1 lughcrs and ¡.collers lived in the days of Jesus Chi ist, they would have also ridiculed the 'cre- dulity* of the devout woman who exclaimed when the touched the hem ot his garment ' I shall be healed ' But the Redeemer despised such benders, tor he turned about, seeing hei, and said, 'Be of good heart, daughtei, tin faith hath made thee whole* (Matt xix 20, 21, 22 ) And that tins 4 credulitv' was then common, the Lvaugehsts bear testimony, when they sav, ' the whole multitude ought to touch him, foi health carne out ot lum and cured all' (\laik v SO, Luke vi 19, vin 46) And least the ' scoficis' should say, tins might be all light with lum, or of him, but not of mere men, we are told that 'multitudes' of the sick weie earned into the streets on beds and couches (more Popish translations) and were miraculously cuied by even the shadoi» of St Peter (Acts v 14, 15), and again« »God wrought by the hand of Paul splendid miracles, so that c\cn theie were brought from bis body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went of them * (Ibid xix li, 12 ) And it the saint hateis and miracle îe viieishad lived in the first age, no doubt they would have ridiculed the primitive Gin ist ians, ' who carried back to Antioch the holy relics of St Ignatius the Mart}!', and wrapped them up in linen, as an inestimable treasure leit to the Church ' (Ruinait, Act, Sine ) Thev would hive also laughed at the same Chu tuns 'foi gathcinig tip the bones of St Polyc irp (B shop ot Suivi ni), more pieeious

Ung this letter, I remain, Sir, your most obedient sci'wint, 11 JOHN SPRAP1, Clerk' It weic in vam to remonstrate with the Romish Priests on this disgusting supeistition, this profane violation of the icpulchml rest ot "those who have fallen on sleep " It may be nioic to the purpose to address the educated and enlightened of the Roman Catholic laity , mid by le ison to pcrsuule, 01 bv udiculc to shame, them outol any participation in ptactices at once so impious and abominable We should beseech, therefore, such ot our Roman C itholic counti y men as have understanding to comprehend nu abuse, an 1 patience to on dine the rebuke w Inch an cxposuic ot the corruptions he is required to icceive conveys, to examine and inqtine what it is the church imposes on him, us well as the moic ignorant or his pcisuasion, to be- lieve lespectmg the dead bodies and othci relies of the Smuts, real oi supcistitiaus, what ure the vntues they possess' W hut the benefits they con- vey * What the duties they deni md * In the hist place, they nie to beliesc that the person s i culled u S nut-s ly Simon Styhles toi instance, a t iniitic who passed Ins useless existence standing upon one leg, on the top of a pillai-is really a Samt in llenen iceogmsed as such by God und by Him endued with catani miraculous privileges and powers In the next place, that the bones oi telles presented foi vcuerilion nu the iden- tical bones oi telles ot the peison to whom they nie uscniicd , in the third, that these bones mid îelics possess and exercise miraculous powers of vuuous nnd wonderful kinds, and lastly, that icnsoniiblc Chustidii men should fall down and woislup them The fir t point is of little oi no consequence The supposed Saint may be a ical Saint foi uhal any of us knows to thccontmiy , oi he nny not be a Saint, for what anybody knows lo a ceitmnty The second pontt is of mote tmportiince, and is it lequnes the bellet that the bones or relics pa sented tor veneration are the genuine and identical bones oi relies ol the poison to whom they nie useubed, it requires a belief, in that which in nine hundicd and ninety nine cases out ot a thousand, is incapable of any proof, and has all the unprob ibi lily of the giossest filsehood " Ihc greater pint of the bones now up m the Roman altáis," says an acute w uter upon this subject,* " have been taken out of the catacombs whcie the heathens weic buried, and us the Popes wcie ignorant of the names of the peisons to whom they belonged, they baptize them and },ivc them names as it pleases them And this hnth caused ficqucnt contests and tunis between puests nnd monks, who vehe- mently contend with one anothei thatthev ure the sole possessois of the piinntncSaint, ot this oi that name In i landers, Jtmncc, and Spain, there mc eight arms of St Matt hen, and thiec of Luke, which the compiler of a catalogue ol relics asserts he himself had seen, and he could not tell how many innis St 1 homos a-Beckctt hid Some of them must have had as many limbs as a centi- pede" Now, who intoims the Roman Catholic layman that the relics presented to lum me the genuine remains of the asserted S unf Win, the puest, who expects money foi the exhibition And who told the priest so3 The monk, who sold them to him for a puce And who told the monk ' The bone grubber, who dug them up for his day's pay And this is the chain of évidence on which a Christi in man of reasonable mind is to hang his taith Shame shume He wuuld not take the pedigree of a horse worth ¡£50 on the word of a notouous hotsc jockey, and yet he will pin the sah ilion of his soul on the evidence ol a spiutual swindler lu the third place, what is the rational Roman Catholic laymun icquircd to believe respecting those bones and relics-genuine or fictitious» Why-that they arc not only useful for exciting rational devotion ' but they are actually stinng ramparts, capable of piotccting towns fiom military nssuults '-stiong defences uj,ninst the unseen snares of demons, and the wiles of Satan, that they possess such wonderful virtues, that the very touch bungs down n blessing, and will accom- plish all the wishes of those pcisons who are ad- mitted to so great a fnour as to touch them " Gennadius," says the iiuthouty wc have nlrcidy quoted, " intoims us, that Nisibis, being a frontici town of the Roman empne, was theiclbrc liable to be attacked by encintes , that the Emperor Con stme h&i;\ foi lifted it with the body of Holy James, its deceased bishop, who, for the put pose of de- fending it fiom hostile attacks, was buued within its walls " The citizens of Antioch refused the body of Simon Sty liles to the Emperor Leo, alleging, " our etty hath no walls, therefore wc brought luther the most holy body of Simon, that it might seivc us in the stead of wall and bul wiuk " Do rational Roman Catholic laymen be- lieve all this, 01 any part of ii ' If not, why do they suflcr then priests to make a gain of inclo- sing such awful mid ubsurd impostuies upon the ignoiant and unthinking7 But in the fourth place, what is the duty ic quued of the Roman Catholic laity towards those wonder-working relics' 'lins wc shall not attempt to describe m woids of our own, lest we be thought to nusicpicscnt 01 exaggerate, but y\c it in an extract from the second Council of Nice, held A D 7S7 " I adoi e, and honaui, mid salute the relics of the sumts, as of those who have wrestled on behalf ot Christ, and who have re- ceived grace fiom Hun to accomplish healings and cure disordeis, and to eject demons, accoid ing as the chuich of the Christians hath received from the Holy Apostles and Fathers, dow n even to ourselves " Do the educated and enlightened Roman Ca- tholic laity believe that they ought to adoic the dead bodies, hones, ot other relics, laid befóte them by monks and priests for a price' If so, they are not of one mind with St Augustine, with whom, whenever he jumps with their humour (and that is not always), they are very apt to agree as a competent authoutv He says, "Men were, in his time, scattered up mid down in the dress of fuars, some of whom piofessed the trade of selling the bones of maityis-if we util believe they were the tnartyts' boncs\" (he slyly subjoins) But, perhaps, a General Council will bo ot nioic authouty with our Roman Catholic lay country- men We therefore rcler to the Council of Lao dicca, held A D 820 (four hundred and sixty years earlier than the second Council of Nice), in which it is decreed " that Christians ought not to forsake the worshipping of God, and depart aside, invocatmg Angelso> Saints, therefoie, if any mm be lound using this <:eciet idolatry, let him be accursed, because he hath jorsaken our Lord Jesus Chi ist " Now, as to what the Roman Catholic laity of li eland are required by then pucsts to believe and do at this present day, and what thousands of them actually believe and practice, with respect to this monstious and disgusting supeislition, the most unexceptionable testimony will be found iu the following lettci, addiesscd by the Rev C M.
