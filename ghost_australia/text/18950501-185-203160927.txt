CHORAL SERVICE. Last evening a united choral service was held at the Cathedral Church in connection with the assembly session. The church was quite full, and the sacred music most im- pressive, the anthems being “The Lord is exalted’ 1 (West) and Beethoven’s “Halle lujah chorus.” The sermon was preached by the Dean of Melbourne from Acts x., 28— “It se«mpd good to the Holy Ghost and to us.” Such bold words could only be ex cused by their truth, bat they befitted the occasion, and without taking this lofty but legitimate ground the apostles never could have ruled and taught the chnrch. From them emanated synodal action; they divested themselves of their autocracy and shared in the work of synods with enormous results in the development of the church. So in these colonies the bishop at first was absolute, but Bishop Perry brought about a revolution which made co- operation of clergy and lai>y possible; the synods exer cising much of the powers of the episcopate in administration, and claiming the august authority attributed by St. James to the first synod at Jerusalem, The hope of the future was a synod of all the Anglican com munion, and ultimately nf the whole catholic church to which the text would be obviously appropriate. The offertory was for foreign missions.
