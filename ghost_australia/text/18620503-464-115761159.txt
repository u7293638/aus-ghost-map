The Gold Fields. — It must not be supposed that because the escorts for the last two weeks har» ' been small and that those succeeding are not likely to be larger unless some-new ground is discovered, that therefore the gold fields of Otago are about to ' collapse. What with the broken weather, which, ; I suppose, we must now count upon as likely to last for the next four months at least, the miners have only been working half-time, and consequently ', the amount of gold produced has been proportion- a ably decreased. To this cause alone is to be* attributed a large portion of the falling offt '? although it is also notorious that the population on the gold fields has sensibly decreased, and con sequently the less gold rpf6ducea. — Otago Time*, 9th April. ..-.??. i . ,...' . .. . ?** . : ? f n The late -Murder in Wood's Lanb.-— On Sergent Harris yesterday morning going to the house occupied by the Fletchers, who- were the- -- previous evening committed for trial on the crime '- of murder, he discovered in a reoess underneath the : !

Among those who subscribed are the Earl of Dunraven, the Right Hon. William Monsell, M. P., Major Gavin, M.P., Heffernan Considine, ; Esq., J.P., Derk, and a large number of magis trates and others. The meeting wa3 altogether ,v private ; but the spirit by which, those present . ^ were actuated, is one which we are sure will pervade the 'vast majority of our countrymen, ' and force the Government into the recognition of r the only University in which the Catholics of : . Great Britain and Ireland can repose confidence. ., — IAmeriek Reporter.
