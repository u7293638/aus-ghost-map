IN THE COUNCIL. geldom of late has the Legislative Coun cil been "by strangers honored," but on Tuesday the benches both above and below the clock were far from bare, and it is safe to assert that the attendance there has not been exceeded this session, except when the Governor performed the opening ceremony. The House- hold Suffrage Bill was the attraction, and among those who show ed an interest in its progress were several ladies. Not even influenza could keep members awayâ€”there was hot a single absentee. In moving the second reading of the measure, the Chief Secretary"made .out a strong case for its passage. He was attentively, listened to, but members ap pear to have already made up their minds" as to which way they will vote, and those who do not like the proposal listened merely with a desire to - catch the Ministerial representative tripping . and strengthen their position. Mr. O'Loghlin ; said that even if the Bill be shelved for some time the difficulty must eventually be settled, for every three years at least like a ghost it will arise, and. the people will be stirred again into protest. The more it was realised that the national Parliament of Australia was to be elected by all the people, and the State Legisla ture, with its merely provincial interests, by a few,^ the stronger would become the already strong agitation for constitutional reform, and a settlement of the difficulty would be compelled. Mr. Stifling will con tinue the debate on Tuesday next. As soon as the consideration of the matter was postponed the galleries were deserted, and members proceeded with the Crown Lands Bill, in which several amendments were made. After' sitting exactly three hours the Council adjourned till next day.
