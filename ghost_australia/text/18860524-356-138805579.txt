The country has: obtained a masterpiece very cheaply. T'ne price, 1770 guineas, has some similiarity of numerals with the Blenheim Raffaelle price, but other wise there is no affinity in the sum. His lady watering flowers in a garden fetched a price that seems enormout- .Â£1865-for about a square foot of paper, telling no story, and dealing with no remarkable slpeclmen of girl's. beauty. But we shall get no more of Walker's handiwork, and therein lies one secret of his rising prices. I remember that when the painter was alive, a poor brother brush, who could only afford a guinea sketch by Walker, looked longingly week after week at an unsold and larger drawing of his, "The Violet Gatherers," at the Old Water-Oolour Society. Mr. Thomas, the keeper, advised Walker to have a " sold" ticket put on the picture, for his reputa tion's sake-his reputation was already considerable-but Walker obstinately refused. The drawing ultimately was disposed of, betore the close of the exhibition, for fifty-five guineas. London Correspondent.
