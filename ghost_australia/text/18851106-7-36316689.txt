V.R.C. SPRING MEETING. OAKS DAY. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] Melbourne, November 5. Thursday being the off day of the V.R.C. Spring meeting, the attendance was very small compared -with that of Tuesday, -whilst the weather was anything but enticing to pleasure- seekers. Melbourne was enveloped in dost, and quite a tornado was blowing daring the morning, making one fancy it would carry the trains off the rails. The course was better than the streets, as the grass surrounded the stand, bat the dost was blown over in clouds from beyond the river, Occasionally the sun shone feebly, but altogether "Oaks* day was not the ladies' day as far as the elements were concerned. Owing to the big ball at Govern ment House last night none of the vice-regal party were present; but although the atten dance was comparatively poor the club expect to make a profit of £15,000 over the meeting. Should the weather be at all favorable oa Saturday there will be another monster crowd to witness the Open Steeplechase and con cluding events. Joe Thompson got himself into hot water during the day by abusing one of the members of the V.R.C. He was called before the steward?, and after being compelled to give a written apology was cautioned that for another offence of the kind he would be warned off the course for ever. A singular fatality seems to hang about this season 8 racing, as even the Flenrington car nival has not passed by without an accident, in which * horse has men killed, and a jockey badly injured. Mr. Watson bad a goad deal of trouble at the poet -with the twenty-four horses who faced him in the Veteran Stakes, and for enoe he failed to effect an equitable start. Standing in front of his horses, he had succeeded in getting them into a very good liii^ when, in order to newt being himself nm -ever, he stepped ueiwmai them to the (ear, before he gave the word to " go." Several of the ciders anticipated his signal, and broke away while others were in the act of fa"*"rg round. .Metal -was one of those -whore bead was the wrong way, while Bosworth was several lengths in advance of anything else. The field had not gone above fifty yards when one of the horses fell, and two others rolled over him. These proved to be Doncsster, Grace Darling, and Kingship, who were all near the end of the ruck, so that the twenty-one other horses went on their way, the majority of the riders in fact being ignorant of any accident having occurred. Young Ethridge, the rider of Doncaster, who was once in Mr. Ferry's employ, was picked up badly hurt, with several of his ribs broken, while his horse Doncaster lay motionless -an the turf, dying ordead, bis caresses being after wards dragged out of the way by the by standers. He either broke hia neck in falling, or was galloped upon by ?other horses. Williams, who rode Grace Sailing, was supposed to be much hart, but he was soon able to talk, and like Tools, the nder of King&him; his escaped alsraet aninculoasly without injury. It is a singular 43ii?g- that Kingship was the horse Oracknell was siding whan the bad fall occurred in the -Coalfield Cop, and that dace Darling who von that event should get a fall at Flemington. The mare was pretty heavily hacked by her party for the present event. The horse tint -was killed was half brother to Mr Savill's Banter, and ran at Adelaide in the cup won by First "Water. Doncaster won the Geelong Handicap this season, and was afterwards purchased by Mr. T. Jones, of Caulfield, and placed in J. Morrison's stable. The two first events of the day afforded very little sport, as Winchester was so strong a -favorite for the Maidens-that 4 to 1 was laid on him, and the books would not lay even money the donble with Acme. The Maidens was a, very slow race, and Winchester won with the greatest of ease, though his rider cut it rather fine at the -finish. Acme was mostly -saved by the books, who wonld not lay money, but wanted 4 to 1 on her. She ran a Jade, however, and never tried in the race, which was won easily by Blair gowrie, to whom "MaJMnKy* ran a moderate second. The Spring Handicap brought out twelve runners, and St. John was made a -very warm favorite, while lantern was also backed by his party. It was * good betting race all round, and a few of the knowing men pot their faith in Cerise and Blue, who -laraxded them with a ckver win from Veloci pede, -the £ood looking- bnt nafortonsfce Jjstvingtan bemg once more third. This horse has had an almost unprecedented run of bad luck, but it is not owing to any defect on the part of his trainer, as jFiigate has brought his -charge in excellent condition to the post. The JJoyal Park Stakes was almost a walkover for -Trenton in more than one sense, as the horses merely cantered till they had gone half the dis tance, the lighter weights desiring to reduce the race to a mile. Even under these circumstances ihc Kew Zealanderbeat then with the greatest ?of earn, gliding away from his field when called -upon, audwiwimg by* couple-of lengths. The Steeplechase was regarded as each a dead cer tainty for Uenmark that the public had to lay money on him, bat for about the best time iu his -career he fell at the third jump, and though remounted crate to grief for a sec ind time opposite the 6tand. He was, however, set going again by EakluC in time to see Trickett pass the poet first after falling. Banker also came down. Trickett miesed a jump, and was disqualified, .and Banker was awarded the stakes. .Some ugly things were said about Denmark, ?who was reported to be running for the books, tut iheee rumors were probably without foaa ?dation, as a rider would hardly risk hia neck by f?ll?ng twice in a steeple, whatever the owner t-f the hurse might a?dre. Uralk was made s warm favorite for the Oaks, sod ehe had so trouble whatever in winning the race, jib Hales took her to the front *t the start and kept her there, winning easily in fair time. Lady Claudia, who was supposed to be a good thing-, got no nearer than third, the second place being filled by Parody. TtfffiMHg MASK. A etreep?taies of 10 aovs. each, with 259 added.
