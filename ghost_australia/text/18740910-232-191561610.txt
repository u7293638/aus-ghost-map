It is high time some drietrnkaed steps were taken bv the Gorenajest to bring to as end the dk jwte which has so long bees raging between the Age newspaper and the Public Works Deoartnieiit. The Govern- ment has. of course, so coniroi ore- what ever sztides or papers sppit phbScwtais may appear in the columns of ocr oostem- paraty; neither is it aS dearabte that it should have. , Bat it has foil .control over the PobGc Works Office 'and a searching inrestigatkm into the charges of incom petence sod negfet JeveOed at this depart ment hy the Age, wotM be taiitamoaist to sitting in judgment upon that news paper. and the resolt wooW show whether the joomalist was right, and the permanent head of the departroeiit wrong, or whether the poadonof the twbparoestothe qnarrei should be reversed. At first sight it may Bean do part of the icncticos of the Govern ment to sit in jndgmest upon such quarrels : but when the subject is investigated it wiQ be found thai iiiasnmch as it is the first duty of a newspaper to expose abuses, with a view to tbeir rectification, it is equally in- OTmV«rt npan the Government to asoatain whether a circcmstaritial charge made by an infinentiai ion real against a State de- partmait, can be substanriated ; and if so, to take the proper steps to prevent the re currence of the wrong done. Not to do tins, is for the Government to neglect a cimary dnty which it owes to the people, and to peonh a prejddke to take root in the pablij mind against a Stale depart- ment, which most excite very tmpfeasani reSeions afterwards, or ehenhierany new ttdEBpOlllOtWfk Cfiflnpy (Q PfttaroPfi to to adanmstra&m.; The PdbGc Works Office is a branch of the JStste whkh has the expenditure of large sums of money under to control ; and in the djsborEeroent of these, ifoms ft stoglj acts.-nsa Jrostee for the people, seeing that it is tire public money winch ft expends. It is, therefore. jastifiaUy open to newspaper watchfulness and criticism ; and for any journalist, seised of information tending to show that it is not faithfully performing to toost withhold - iag what he knows form the public, woidd be for that joomalist to dow himself unfit to awthrae in sack relationship towards the community. In like manner, it is quite as tench the dntv of the '-Government to protect to officers from unfounded attacks, and the oolv way by whkh ft can attain ti&send; is totfcaniBgtty fmqmrexnto: charges made against than, whenever they assume dimensions sufficiently formidable to jaattfy iuvesSga&m.; If the janrealist is vrreig, tfaeakt him bear afi tbe pffium which -a. sfanderer deserves; if right, thea let him carry off the honors doe to his peoetrstion and foresight, and the Government follow tq> the result of the enquiry made by the substitution of a competent person for one who has shown himself unsaited orvmable to discharge the Unties whkh have been entrusted tohkcareanddSigmroe.

I The real question is. snet those foasda- j tioEE hcaft coutoaiy to what was actbo- rised ly the Public Works Depart- meat; and if sa,"bow was ft that the j alterations were zEo wed to be made? We do 1 not care, however, to ester tofiopar&ars;, | as tins cooree is foreagn to our present ob- 1 iect. AS we desre to contend for just now j is that- the Age cckkzboes to charge ' after charge against the Public Works De- j partssesL, and that these charges are of \ such jss important character tb».r they j ought to form, the subject of an exhaustive i ettpary by a ssct ccenztoeeof the Hoose. ' Tbe people cannot fed theft- money is being wisefy expended while these charges hang over Mr Waebell and las subordinates : and it is the people whkh the Gov ernment has to respect in tins matter, azri not the convenience or peace of mind of two or throe persons to to em ploy. If the Public Wockg Department has the best of the quarrel, by all meats let ft enjoy a hearty triumph over to sssrihnt. But if the honors of aa enquiry should fall to the lot of the Age, thea sot only will that paper stand justified to the position which ft has taken up, but the public interests will also have beets largely subserved by the cisiossres whkh ft has ma.de. Tbeqcsrre! between the two has gone so far by this tone, that ft will be a disgrace to the Go- verEueut if ft chrghi be permitted to remain to to present unsatisfactory stage, or in complete coodfttoc. Is- tbe ooorseof bis speech to the Asenbiy on Tuesday evening, the Treasurer stated that ft was not tbe intendon of the Govera- nttt to rase one stogie penny more oil boots or any other article th" was raised by the ad red'jrezr, duties, and if any inridmt- tal discrepancies had crept to, they should, as far as passible, be rectified to accordance with that principle- Accepting this declara tion as the views of the Ministry, we will pxst oat one article — namely, boots — in which Mr Seeyicz may well make some alteration. Under tbe ad r-aforera system, women's common kid boots bote a duty amounting to Is a pair, while women's glove kM boots paid fs .fid doty. .The reasmt of tins was that the first cost -5s fd a pair, and the last lis $L Under the new system, or fixed duties, tbe -duty will he raised oa the former, while it will be lowered on the latter. Thus tbe duty on the cheaper artide wifi be increased to Is 63 a pair, whSe ft will be reduced in the case of the dearer description of boots, from Ss fid to Is fid a pair. Tbe one class cf boots is largely, indeed we might almost say exclusively, used by the poorer classes, whilst the other ft seldom purchased except by people who are well oS. The same line of argument applies to boots of all kinds, whether men's or women's, ft is obvious, therefore, the new system of fixed duties will increase tbe pride of the cheaper article, whBe ft will reduce. tbe cost of the more expeorive production. As this policy, if perasted in, would he in creasing taxation to the case of poor people, wh3e lowering ft in that of the rib, we fed sore that Mr SEBVXCE win show Ms respect for Ms own deliverance on Tuesday evening, by taking tins injustice into very genial conadecattoo. \Ce would suggest, as a way out of the difficulty, that there should be two rates of dniy appertatotog to boots, and that the mean should be struck at €s. The lower duty should be charged on .all hoots invoiced up to 8s, and the higher cm boots charged above that price. If tins were done, the revenue would be maintained, and the rich pay their fair proportion of the money procured from this source, wbst the poorer classes would be by so mnch relieved of taxation on an essential article, of consumption. Some change, ai aD 'events, to deariy required in this ffirection, and we thtok the one we suggest would tolly meet the case we pre sent, as well as all. contingencies that could posstoly srtoe oot qf ft. As recraftiy as the year 1803, a celebrated member of tiie English 3Lreee of Commons — Mr WlLBKAHAM — opposed in that institution tbe abolition -ftf boU- bafttog. "He was of opimon that gentlemen should set about reforming themselves before they endeavored to reform otbers.

S They have got some of the immigrants at Inver- canrill. and this is what the Southland Times has to say about them " The immigrants, who are at present residing In the old barracks in Esk I street, are an amiable lot-, They are, it is true, but few in number, and nearly all women, with ! tawdry clothes and outworn faces-; but for pawning their goods and chattels for strong spirits, and for drinking, fighting, screaming, blaspheming, and in making night hideous in a general way, they are, we should say, simply unsurpassable. They seem to be fit for nothing useful, and the life they lead Is truly a pitiable oue. Still they are human beings, and must exist somewhere or other; but it is galling to think that the colonists' money should be wasted — literally thrown away — in bringing out people, who, instead of being a benefit, are a burthen to the colony." According to the Southern Cross, Miss Atica May's professional connection with the colonies Is about to terminate with her recent tour in New Zealand, as she will then proceed to America, and thence to England. On the 25th of last month Miss Slay made her last appearance in Auckland, and the same paper reports as follows of her leave- taking : — " Daring the course of the concert last night at the Choral Hall, Miss Alice May was pre sented witb a very handsome and valuable diamond locket and necklace, manufactured by Mr Heinrich Kohn, which hadjbeen subscribed for by a few of her friends and admirers in Auckland. Miss May has made a tour of the principal cities of New Zealand, in each of which she has been paid a similar compliment." The Great liibernicon was again largely patron ised at the Theatre last night, when the panoramic scenes were greatly admired. Tbe singing, dancing, and comicalities of the various per formers created roars of laughter, and met with rounds of applause ; the music of the capital band also elicited merited praise.
