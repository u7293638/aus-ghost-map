THE REVISION OF THE AUTHOEr IZED VERSION. OF THE NEW . TESTAMENT. ..-..v . : ,.;.i PAPER XV.. It is proposed:. now to examine the; changes introduced by the Revisers into the fifth and three following chapters' of the Epistle to the Romans. It is thought that a better idea both of the number and character of the alterations which' the Revised Version exhibits will be ob-! tained by examining continuous portions than by examining isolated verses. The; portions already examined have been typii' cal of the (contents of the historical- books ,of the New Testament. The first; two ; chapters of St. Mattbew;'s Gospel1 may be regarded as typical of the' n'arra-. tive portions of the Gospels. \ The fifth,, sixth and seventh chapters as /typical of those portions which preserve the dis courses of our Lord. . The, chapters,., on which we are now entering may/be' re- garded as typical' "of St; Paul's Epistles? The present1 paper ' will be 'dbvoted tb' 'the' fifth chapter1 of ' tlie- Epistle !.':tb "'tbe' Romans; ' »»; The 'first verse' exhibits 'two ' alterations.
