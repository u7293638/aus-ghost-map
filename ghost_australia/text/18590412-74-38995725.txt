OIRDNANCE AND COMMISSARI?T. In days long past-thu dark ages of Tasmanian history-the ordnance and commissariat departments were impor tant institutions. They occupied a largo space in thie public eye, and as government agencies weore liberally accommodated with land, houses, and et cetcras. Now all that is changed. Only the ghosts of these departments exist, and for all colonial purposes we can dispense with them entirely. We hear there has been an attempt to annoy the local executive by impertinent in terferenco on the part of some who, though we have a free Government, wish to persuade us that there still exists in our midst an imperintu in itAperio. The sooner this delusion is dashed to atoms the better. It must be dealt with promptly and decisively. The ministry have just to lay down and act upon this doctrine-the colony for colonists. In the few cases in which grants have been improperly issued to the ordnance, let the property be resumed by.Act of Parliament ; and in every other instance let the Govern ment take immediate possession of the premises as tile property of the crown, to be dealt with as a responsible minis try may advise her Majesty's represen tative.
