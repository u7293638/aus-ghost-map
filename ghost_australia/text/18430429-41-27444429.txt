THE MORMONITES, OR LATTER DAY SAINTS. Many of our readers are aware that some years ago, a tribe of insane fanatics turned up in America, calling themselves Mor- monites or Latter Day Saints, under the leadership of one Joseph Smith, a self styled "Prophet of God" . ■ov{ of soi'lu; i:i:i ('..'o;.

Tl?e following: equally intelligible sentence was enounced viva vocc in a sermon deli vered between the dutc of the two above passages : — " Miitiy of the English who have lutely come here have exuiessed great disappointment on tlnir anival.

We shall now make sonic selections move ' illustrative of the general proceedings of the Mormons. It will have been observed, that one feature in the character of the sect is a kind of gross and superstitious love of the marvellous in those who believe, and an equally gro*s ttyle of imposture in those who teach, —an imposture so coarse: and impudent, that one scarcely could have fan cied that it could have obtained accep tance from any large body oi' people in any, much less in our own civilised country. I One lesson certainly it amply illustrates, — ! the power of mere bold assumption over un educated minds, l'ositiveness, confidence, and decision in those who teach $i doctrine, pecm to be really almost the tests by which ,i large number of our fellow-c*e:itures judge of its truth. Whether that larger .number also embraces the purer and higher class of minds, —those who would be must benefited by, nnd are most deserving of the possession of truth, is another question. Certainly, Mr Caswall's account of Narvoo -fives little rea son lo fear that such can be the case with this miserable imposture. The audacious and blasphemous assumption of inspiration on the part of Smith und his friends, though | they have attracted, and may continue in their gross way to amuse, a large number of converts, do not appear, in fact, to liave mas tered any greater number of pure and wise intellects than might have been expected from the character of their tenets, their reli gious services, and their leaders. Mr Caswall took tome pains to ascertain the character which those Mormons bore in their own neighbourhood, and the result was not satisfactory. It would seem that the peculiar temptation of Mormons lies in I the article of thieving. " I have already staled some circumstances which may itppear to tiuet't on tin* common honesty oi some of the Mormons.

He as!;ed for the signs of their commirsion !opre;u!> this new religion. An old mats told him I that miracles —the ht-al:r.^ of the sit-k, the fiiistinjr out of devils, and the speaking of unknown tongues, were rife mnuiij them. Mr Caswall asked the old man to cure him (Mr Caswall) of a slight deafness. "lai- nedintely the old m;in stepped forward, and bufoi'a I was aware of his objeer, thrust his totetiiujfi's into my ems, and, lifting up l;is eyes, uttered for atioul n minute in u loud vci-e Mime unintelligible gibherieh. • Tln-re,' he shul finally, • the Holy Ghost prompted mo to do lliii!, and now you have heard ?he unkn 'uu ton-u,' ' • |>ut my hi-atiii); is not improved,' I «;iid.

Mr Caswall urged the gross mistake which their Prophet had made, in pronoun cing aGrecl; psalter to be an Egyptian diction ary. " Sometimes," said tlu Mormon due tor. "Mr Smith sneaks as a prophet, and sometimes us a mere man. If lie gave a wrong opinion respecting the boo!:, he spoke as a mere man." Mr Caswall expressed to them hovv much he pitied ri.cni. •' The. old man in blue now «u!d ma that they pitied me us much nu I pitied tiiem. ' Cuuie. my friend," lie wiid to me. • let yo:i iiiid I gi; down to I lie MissifEippi, oniy let inc|jii: you under rli L - w,i. tor uud baptizi* you, anj wiii:ii you c.i;ne u;i apam you wiil see till th« iiiystcrie"? .:iai:riv, ;t::<l will 1 believe in out j;rcat f.gas and vvondeis '" | Mr Ciiswc-H then thanked them fur not j having puthim under the Mississippi ingood earnest and kept him there, and departed. The mode in which this baptism is prac tised i3 pretty much might wlml have been expected from the character of those wh j practise it. " On one occniion, [Cm persona were b ijiliv.L-.l | by immersion tit Nauvoo,some for the remission of sins, un-i Mjir.e loi their d"cr.,-ed friends, which is tSit-ir Imptism forthede.'d.

Uut to return : the controversy ended, Mr Caswall too 1; his leave. A Mormon ferryman ferried him a.cro.--s the riwr, whose cx])ies!'ed opinion of his brethren in the faith had been " that it was no use to h.'jist a flag at Xarvoo as a signal to passengers, for it tvassure to he stolen by the people there, they had so Uuch of the Devil in them." He was destined on this occasion to verify by his own experience the truth of which he had warned the world :— " When w<; arrived ut t'n« bout \v fontni i: Raff, us it l> nl liei'ii i.ire.hitly padlocked m tit nioriiiuir.

I On the 14th July. 1842 (since Mr Cus wall's book tippearcd), a prodigious c.v plosioTi took place among the faithful in the city of (iod al Xtirvoo, which threatens to retard this debasing delusion, or at any, rate to hold up its rii>glcailurs to public cxe ri.itiim.

Mr Cas wall's work will illustrate! the peaceful character of the founder of this Mormon movement, who, according to his bosom friend's testimony, stands charged with '• murder, treason, burglary, and arson." " On his trial for high treason against the state of Missouri," " John Corrill testified that he had heard Joseph Smith say pub licly, that, *if people molested him, he would establish his religion by the sword, ami that he would become to this gene ration a second Mahomet.'" Mr Caswall adds, that the Indians have the greatest possible contempt for Joseph Smith, and denominate him Tshe.w;il-lis-ke, which (signifies " rascal," a vobriquvt so eiiphonous, us well as appropriate, that wo almost wonder that the prophet has not willindy substituted it for his prosont leas dignified appellation of "'Old Joe." According to Bennett, Smith's method j of fiillil'.iiv.! prophvey is as strange aj his ; mode of ejilerpreiing it. In 18-11, Smith j predicted or prophesied in a public con gregation in Kativoo, that Lilburn W. Hoggs, ex-Governor of T?lissouri, should die by \ iolent hands within one year. lYom din: to t\u) months prior to th«; rtwnipU'd p.s>i;i.isit;;ilion of Governor; ViO'jg*, a Mr O. 1\ Itnckwcll left Nauvoo for piiris unknown to the citizens at large. Dennett, then on terms of close intimacy with Joe Smith, asked him whore Rockwell had gone. ''Gone," said lie, '■ <;oxk to jci-i jl ritoi'i'iKCY !" Hockwell returned to Nauvoo the day before the report of tin- assassination reached there, and thcArtfctvM li r asp remarked "it yet remains to be known who did the noble <ieed !'' Hockwell remarked to a person now iu Nauvoo that he " h.td he<;n all over Upper Missouri, and all about where , llodgs livouV1 ! Hut we must close our narrative of this precious scoundrel by a notice of his per-' son.il vices, ns attested by the .-tfiidavits of Heimeti, and corroborated by llio testi •lloll3' of many of bis frail and too credu lous victims. "Smith the Mormon se ducer," says Uennott, '•hasseduci'd not only hundreds of single auil married females, but move than the groat Solomon iittemp- i ted to seduce," and he proceeds to give tha public a catalogue of Smith's cl.tndes- j tine wives, and th.-i disgusting manner in viliicii he trapaimud ihein, under ihe new j (li.sprnsation, A specimen or two must suf fice. It appears that, inthe early history of the City of Nttuvoo, Smith told Dennett ho iiiteniirii (o make Mrs Sarah M. Pratt, an amiable and accomplished ludy, the wife of Proii's^or Orson I'ratt, of the Uni versity of Nauvoo, one of his spiritual i<u(\'s\ for ih>> Lord had given her to him, and lie refjue.-:ted IJennett to assist him in consummating his hellish purposes. Ben nett told him that he would not do it— that (she bail been nvuch neglected and abusi'd by the chmeh during the absence of li<t husband in Kv.rope, ami that if the Lord hail p.ivon her to him he must at lrr.d to it hiuiseli'. "1 v. ill do il," said he, " for 11-.ere is no harm in it if herhus hand wlioulc! tievcr find it out." Dennett called upon Mrs I'ratt, and told her that Joe contemplated an attack upon her vir tue, in (he name of the Lord, and that she must pn>ji?m lo repulse him in so in. famous an assault. She replied, "Joseph c;:nnot be such a man ; I cannot believe it until I know it for myself, or have it from his own lips ; he cannot be so cor rupt." " Well'," Bennett replied," you will soe unless he changes his niitid.*' A few days afterwards, proposed to lleniK'lt lo accompany him (o liamus.

Uen tioit roiii'jiislra'.ed viith him, telling him thai illdcr Kigdon was one of his be«t friends, and that it would L.: a pity to ap. j proach any member of hia family, seeing ' that they were truly virtuous. " But," saya Joe, " the Lord baa given her to me to wife. I have the blessings of Jacob, and there is no wickedness in it. Itwould be wicked to approach her unless I had permission of the Lord, but as it is, it is as correct as to have a leyal wife in a moral point of view." Nothing daunted, he went alone to Miss Rigdon's, took her into a private room, locked the door, and com menced by telling her he had long loved her, and he asked the Lord for her, and that it was his holy will that he should ( have her. He said that it would not pre vent her from marrying any other person— that he had the blessings of Jacob granted to him—and that all was right. He then [ desired to kiss her, and wished her to kiss him, but on Miss Rigdon's threatening to alarm the house he desisted. He after wards had an interview with her father, taking with him his High Priest, George I Miller, for a witness, and by boisterous ! words and violent gestures tried to deny the attempted seduction; but, not being able to face it out, he made an acknow ledgment of tlte tvftole affair. AH the family, and many other persons were pre sent, and when they threatened Smith with condign punishment, his High Priest ex claimed, " You must not harm the Lord's anointed—the Lord will not suffer his anointed to fall!" We pursue this niass of corruption, in inui*y, and fraud no further. We hope we have repeated enough of his blasphemies and bestialities, and detailed sufficient of the profane ceremonies of himself and his miserable impostures, to 6ave any enligh tened mind from the peril of such a monstrous delusion; whilst it is lament, able to think that such delusions are not only possible but popular. It appears that, since these discloses, the people of Illinois and Missouri are greatly incensed against Smith and his brother prophets, and threaten to drive them out of the State; but subsequent accounts state that Smith had actually been arrested or had surrendered himself into custody. The Springfield (Illinois) Journal, how ever, Buspoets that his surrender was not made until he was tolerably well assured of a speedy release by habeas corpus, or some other trickery. The same paper contains a formal renunciation of Mor monism, signed by ten late members of the Mormon Church, who declare that they have been most scandalously imposed upon in matters and things of a Divine character." Oliver H. Olney, late • a preacher of the Mormou doctrines, has also renounced all connection with the '"Latter-Day Saints," having been a witness to the corruptions and debauch eries of their leaders.
