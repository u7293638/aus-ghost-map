The British Museum authorities have made J a rather startling discovery lately. Some tune - -| ago they purchased a magnificent marble *ast ~~ at tiie Emperor Hadrian at a very reasonable '- price. In natural pride they invited a number of distinguished foceignerB to view it, anitall conceded that it was a priceless treasure of . antiqueatt. Among the spectators, however. was a member of the Greek diplomatis service, who instantly declared1 that he nadsaenthe same bust in the Royal Museum at Athens. - He notified his Government, and an investiga tion has followed, which reveals that not only tiie bust in question but -a large number of the most valuable specimens have been stolen. ; Some high Greek officials ace under suspicion, it being' evident that the theftB hare been carried on systematically for a considerable ' time. Doubt, however, has since teen thrown on the accuracy of these statements. The Vienna correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph {quoting bat not. naming a source from which much valuable information has been obtained) says that the leading : statesmen of Europe are considering a new scheme of peace in Europe, 'It ifl their opinion that there is not a single, difficulty amongst any of the European Powers which cannot be disposed of by. peaceful methods. This applies anfee to'tnestanding feud between ^ France and Germany, and to the precarious ' state of relations between Atuferia and Basaia. The idea is that diplomacy offers sufficient re- . - sources to establish a new order of things . - in Europe whereby peace would be guaranteed : ?' sabetatttislly,' The scheme, .remuss the ''?

Well may he eidaim,' What a waste of strength.1' For many weeks past (remarks the St. Petersburg correspondent of the London Times writing on December 4) the Tf,rc°HiaTi press baa never ceased, to bewail the unexpected me. to ; predominance ol England's infLuence at the - expense of Russia's in Teheran. This feeling , has now produced a vigorous press attacton England, Persia, «nj ^1»a Russian Foreign Office. M first the Russian ambassador, Prince Dolgoronky, was cgnaored for being y absent from his poBt, thus girahg Sir Bleary Drammond Wolff an opening. Neither M. de Giers nor M. Zinoviefi, who did so much to «s- ' ? » : tabliBh Russian prestige in Persia, in conjunc tion with General Skobeleff, is spared in the sweeping denunciation levelled against the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on tile subject of its unsucceeBful- condact of affairs with Persia. For three days in succession: the Novoe Vremya has contained three cohanna on this theme. To-day it reprints a long letter from General Skobeleff to a Russian- diplomatist, written in 1879, which- waa translated into tiie Times and other LacdonnewBpraeES in March, 1881. This political ghost of General Skobeleff i* again brought before the directors of BoBsian diplo macy to warn them, in the words of tiie fete here, agaratt the attempts sure to be saade by England, 'bearing at first apnreiy comntenial character,' bat in reality eonaUtuUug 'indMect , invasive action aimed against Baoaa'si puses ejona in tbe Caocasos and Central Aria, and against preponderating infloenco tfasongbout Penia.' The oampaigB opened in tiie jfiwoe Vreeiya against the diplomatists is evidently the work of its staff of military palitiaan» and writers. In their opinion- Sir H» Drammond Wolff has not only secured the navigation of the Karon, bat has also instigated: Bbcbm's refusal to permit the residence of a Buaaian Ccneol at. Meshed,- emboldened the Shah's Government to prohibit tbe sale of wheat to ] the KusnaitB at Lutfabad, and encauraqed tiie 1 Persians to shirk the confttmotion-cf their half I of the high road from Askabad to Method. I Both North and South Persia, have suddenly . I fallen completely under the power of I tbe British Ambassador, whose appointment 1 was not so lorn; ago hailed by Muscovite -1 editors almoBt with derision— Boabsoloulyoon- I fident were they of a monopoly of inflnsww at I Teheran. Sir U. Drummond Wolff* success 1 is considered a national Bosnian disaster, equal I to the failure of the first Afefcal Tekkee expedi- I tion. Such a collapse of BusBiaa ascendancy I is described a*, a ' derailment of thediploamtio I ? train,' for which the Foreign Office and the I whole system of Russian diplomacy aw to I blame. To obviate tiie evil effects of the I catastrophe, concludes the Novoe Vremya, | Ens&ia; mwst not counterbribe all the Persian I Ministers, bat take strong action directly I againtt the Shah for his violation of a treaty 1 in respect of tiie repotted prohibition of the I sale cf cereals over tiie Khorasan frontier.
