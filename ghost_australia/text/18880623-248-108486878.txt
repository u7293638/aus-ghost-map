Meadow Sweet. In Summer fields the meadow sweet Spreads its white bloom around the feet Of those who pass in lore or play The golden hours of holiday, And heart to answering heart can heat -Where grows the simple meadowsweet, Embosomed in some cool retreat The long seed grasses bend to meet The stream that murmurs as it flowl • Songs of forget me not and rose; The filmy haze of noon tide heat b faint with scenes of meadow sweet. Ah, lore I do you know meadow sweet f Does some pale ghost of passion fleet Adown this dreary lapse of years, So void of lore, so full of fears ? Some ancient, far off echo greet The once loYedname of meadow sweet f An Ingenious Swindle.—A swindle recently detected is conducted as follows: A cheque, say for ten guineas, is obtained from a depositor at a bank, and a blank cheque exactly like the filled-in cheqne is secured. The two cheques are laid one upon the other so that the edges are exactly even, Both cheques arejthen torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the filled cheque appears on one piece and the amount and name of the payee on the other. The cheques having been held together while 'yeing torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say one thousand pounds, takes it with the piece of genuine cheque containing the sig nature of the bank, and explains that the cheque was accidentally torn. The teller can put the pieces together, and as they fit exactly, the chanoes are that he will think the pieccs are parts of the same cheque, and become a victim to the swindle. The trick, of course, suggests its own remedy. The teller should refuse to pay any cheque that is mutilated.
