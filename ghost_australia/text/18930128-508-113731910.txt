Was He Dead? This question was strangely asked of ft body which was not a corpse, although to all appearance actual life had departed. . The following narrative is a truthful Halation of what happened to the narra ' tos'a father many years previous to his dttoeaee. It may be tha more interesting because just now physical research is striving to let us know how we feel when n^a die, or to indicate continued ^terrene knowledge,' whatever that IB, in phantasms of the dead. A -feoent issue of the Review of Reviews directs attention to the eubject and the story which follows is another illustration of the unfathomable. The subject of the story had been a resident of the then town . ««r now city--— *f St. Albans, built on the ?ite of the ancient Roman City of Verulam, in Hertfordshire, England. He had suffered a severe attack of rheumatic fever, been. ' blooded '.in both arms at once to : . fainting, just to reduce the fever, and after some six weeks of the medical treatment then in vogue succumbed to that treat ment and - to all appearance gave up th» ghost. This, however, as , subsequent events proved, he had not done. The wife believed herself to be a widow, the body was being measured by the under taker, and it was in the hours that elapsed Vhjle waiting for the arrival of the coffin that the following incidents occurred, These will be given in the patient's own words as told to Ms son when that son was old enough, to understand the effect such circumstances had upon the father. The ion quit* remembers being held up to receive .a farewell kiss, and soon after this was told his dada was dead. The father, relating the event, Q&id;: **I remember seeing you in ypur mother's arms, and felt your lips upon my che~e~k, which, at the moment Caused intense pain, and I lifted my hand tK- wave you off. I heard you sob and saw , mother take you away, and as I sank back I feeard Dr. Webster say ' It's all over, Mary.' 3?hen there ensued a period of silence and of darkness, although I had no notion of time. I n$xt found myself floating about in the air perfectly sentient of all surround ings, but quite unable to make my own / presence known. I tried more than once to do th-ity for I could hear and see as well. as ever I did when alive. I heard my late friendB commiserating with my weeping *Wif« upon my decease, although I felt that if dead I was very sensible to their coin pigmentary comment's as to what a good man I ha,d been when alive. I could recog 3HC9 each, friend perfectly in feature, manner, and voice ; but could do no more.' . . My father smiled as he added that he had Igeen previously unaware of his virtues, and 'Seemed to bay© lost them again on his ? ftptuai return to ordinary life. After moving about in the room among JUA Talatif es my father said ; ' I '?; ©ould feel nothing bodily, could 3}9$«ee myself ox individualise myself in *ny way beypnd being conscious that I was, jftgi4.th.at I moved and perceived without : - «Sort of, any-kind.

Down this streak of light I saw coming to me a cir-.. cular box about as big* as a penny piece. This I took, and from it received a written, message on a scroll, that I should be received into a certain state of eternal happiness, but net e£ so high a degree as it would have been had I been a more regular attendant at the admini stration of the sacrament of the Lord's supper. While still looking at the scroll, the light departed. I thought I heard the Abbey clock strike, and without perceptible return to my body. I opened my eyes, and to my intense surprise found my bodily self lying flat on the bed, my hands by my sides, and Dr. Webster looking down on me. I heard him ask, ' Do you know me, Sam ?' I again opened my eyes. 1 could do no more, when he rushed downstairs, and I heard 'his cheery voice '? saying loudly, ' Mary, Sam will get over it yet.' And Sam did, living for many years after this strange episode, which at all events had the effect of rectifying what seemed to have been a hindrance to the degree of hie future reward. It was'a subject upon which he Beldom spoke, and always with. a solemnity befitting its apparent mean ing. What is here set down is simple truth, but whether the spirit can thus vacate its earthly tabernacle and return the writer does not attempt to decide.
