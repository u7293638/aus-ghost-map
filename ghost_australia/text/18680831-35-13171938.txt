SCIENCE. Tun LAVA rp VESUV ms-M Silvestri observed the crust tion of Vesuvius in December last at its maximum activity, and anal) send many of its volcanic products The lava is dark grey), and sometimes greenish or reddish on the surface, has a crystalline structure, and exerts an energetic action on the magnetic needle The classifies the lava in three kinds, varying in density from 2 46 to 2 81 One compact variety can turned about 2 per cent of water Three distinct estimates were found, composed mainly of chloride of potassium and sodium, and traces of copper In greenish brown sublimate continued 5 85 per cent of copper I CAL ANESTHESIA ion TETANUS The Bumbo d Medical Archives writing several cases of tetanus (ragged) called lockjaw), which had been successfully rented by a local or places son of chloroform to the entire spinal ce funds by means of cloth saturated with it and evaporation prevented by covering the cloth with oiled silk The application was made just at the approach of a paroxysm As a result of the application the paroxysm was averted, and the patient fell into a calm and natural sleep On feeling a returning paroxysm the same application was made, and the paroxysm again asserted For forty eight hours the occasionally threatening tetanic symptoms immediately yielded to the application of chloroform, and the subsequent convalescence was very rapid ruuiT Sinup" -A fact of considerable importance to our fair readers who are skilled in preparing preserves is that cane sugar b) long boiling will be turned into grape sugar, and thus loose one third of its sweetness Grape sugar- is less soluble than cane sugar, and when fruit juice has been sweetened and boiled for a long time the grape sugar separates in the form of white crystals, and the juice is found to be deficient in sweetness To obviate this, let the fruit juice be boiled by itself until brought to the proper consistence, and after it has become lukewarm, add the required quantity of white or loaf sugar It will dissolve quite readily, and two important objects will be attained Just, a saving of sugar, second, the actual preserva- tion of the fruit free from any of the effects of fermentation CKAMIAONE rite of PETROLEUM -The beautiful synthetic process by which Berthelot succeeded in combining a molecule of defiant gas with a molecule of water, and thus forming alcohol, has led to experiments with hydrocarbons of the marsh gas series which it is said, have resulted in the production of an alcoholic beverage In this day of adulterations it may be useless to warn those who may require alcohol for medicinal purposes against the use of any decoe tions containing spirit not made from sugar, gram, or the grape The real safeguard, however, against this class of adulterations lies in the fact that no chemist has yet succeeded in producing, from hydrocarbons, alcohol at as low cost as it can be made from Indian corn, and further in the probability that the large area of land now being devoted to vineyards will result in the production of mild wines much cheaper than the doctored dilutions of corn whisky, constituting the inn ation ArLANATicLïNs -This is the name given by Stem bril to his new camera lens used in photography, which has lately produced extraordinary effects at Berlin Two varieties of flint glass, different in density are used to form two meniscus lenses which are made achromatic and placed so numerically to the ends of the tube It has no chemical focus and does not give rise to " ghosts ' It furnishes sharp pictures with the diaphragm stops, and can be used with full opening for portraiture as well as for outdoor views and copying, being entirely free from distortion In this respect it is superior to a Dallmeyer triplet, and is but little inferior to the latter in producing pictures of Moree are It has in fact about double the light of a Dallmever of the old construction Its simplicity of construction enables the maker to sell at Berlin an Arlanatic of 10 seconds focus, giving a picture of 8 j inches for 20 dollars 32 cents, write a triplet of the same focus, producing a picture of the same diameter, vi will cost 26 dollars 42 cents THE FECUNDITY or FISH -The enormous fecundity of fishes some of them yield their eggs in millions, and most of them in tens of thousands has given anglers and others the idea that it is impossible to effect the supplies by any amount of fishing The female salmon yields eggs at the late of 1000 for every pound of her weight A fish of twenty pounds, as a general rule, yields 20,000 eggs As regards the productiveness of a salmon river, the question be solved is, not how many eggs the fish produce, but how many eggs arrive at the stage of table fish or in other words, grow to be salmon of say twenty) pounds weight Well what e the authority of Sir Humphrey Davy for saying that out of the 17,000 ova which each finale sa men on an average annually deposits, on!) 800 in ordinary circumstances come to perfection Some fishery economis s do not allow that such a large number ever grow to be table fish, and perhaps Sir Humphrey did not mean that the number specified h) him became table fish, but merely that they were hatched into life One water on this part of the salmon question thinks that only c no per cent of the eggs emitted by the mother fish attain to the point of perpetuating their ku d The destruction of eggs and young fish must therefore be enormous Large qun titles of the eggs, it is known, never come in contact with the milk and so they perish Countless numbers of the ova are carried away by the floods into unsuit- able places, and they too perish Then, again, numerous fish cannibals are waiting at the spawning beds to feast on the appetising roe the thousands so eaten cannot be calculated, but so they perish The young fish, again, are always in danger, and although a river may be positively swarming with young salmon, comparatively speaking, only very few of them ever live to reach the salt water, all kinds of fresh water monsters are constantly extorting tribute from the shoal The smoke slaughter which occurs when the juvenile army reaches the sea is awful Hordes of largest fash are always in waiting for the estuaries at the period of migration, instinctively aware of the least that is in store for them, that only a very small percentage of the young salmon which go down to the sea as smelts ever return as grilse is obvious Yet that large quantities of grass are still left is also obvious from the fact that tens of thousands of these fish are annually killed indeed, the fishery lessee is the greatest enemy of the young salmon It has been shown very conclusively that grilse are Noung salmon that have not spawned Then why kill them It is surely the worst possible economy to kill these virgin state before they have at least one opportunity of per- pears ing their kind -St Paul s Marshall MacMahon recently) addressed a letter to Archbishop Lavigne on the famine in Algeria, in which the following passage occurred -"You will doubtless admit with me that Ireland is one of the most religious countries in the world Nevertheless, during the last famine, cases of cannibalism occurred there as well as now in Algeria," the object of the Marshal being to show that such horrors were not, as the Archbishop supposed, occasioned by Mahomedan ism Cardinal Cullen, naturally unwilling to allow such a stain to remain on the character of the Irish people, has addressed a letter to the Va ven, giving a positive contradiction, couched in terms the most re- spectful to the Marshal, to that statement He says that the moment his attention was called to the Marshal's letter he set himself to procure information on the subject from the very best sources, and he is now enabled to declare that the statement had not the slightest foundation, and that during the long years of famine Ireland never witnessed the frightful scene of violence and murder of which the followers of the Koran have for months past offered the sad spectacle in Algeria." It is true, the Cardinal says, that the famine was so long and so severe in Ireland that the sufferings of the people may be said to have been almost without example in the annals of the vi old Yet, amid their sufferings, they derived from the true religion and the lessons of the Gospel and nimble patience and resignation, and were ever prepared, in the pangs of hunger and the agony of death, for the reception of the sacrament of penance and the Holy Eucharist And far from committing violence on their fellow creatures, or seeking to save their own lives by sacrificing those of others, even of their own children, like the Mahomedans of Algeria, the poor Irish Catholics shared with their companions in misfortune their last morsel of bread He could mention, numbers of parents who, suffering all the tortures of hunger would not touch the last morsel of food they still had, in order to leave it to their children THE S VLF or MEN or WAS, the Controller of the Navy is reported (says the United Set vice Gazette) to have explained to the Committee of the House of Commons that when a purchaser pays £300 for a ship and gets back £1055 for a part of it, that as the part received back was worth that sum and would I reach that amount in the market, the Admiralty were clear games of £300 ' This out-controls even the Controller If the copper was worth £1655 in one case, why was it first given away and then bought back again s The gallant admiral says, as an explanation in full of all demands, that " figures are mere abetractiorB " It seems to us that other things beside figures are abstract nouns, and abstractions of a nature that demand the fullest explanation, and we nasty, without being thought unreasonable, fairly salt, for a little more lucid explanation than this.
