The Kensington Park September Meeting. The nsaal Kensington Park September meeting took place on Saturday last, but rain setting in about midday considerably inter fered with the attendance, which was much below the average. The rain ceased before the flrst race commenced, but subsequently fell at intervals during the afternoon, and as it was also very bleak and cold, the visitors did not have a very pleasant time of it. The opening event of the day — the Hurdle Race — produced one of the best jump ing races ever witnessed in the colony, terminating in a dead heat between Niin- rod and Black Prince, Marie finishing so close alongside of them that the general opinion was that there was a dead heat "between the . three. The run-off. between Black Prinoe and Nimrod took place later in the afternoon, but the latter broke down so badly, after he had led for upwards of a mile, that he could not complete the remainder of the coarse. Subsequently, the owner of the horse, Mr. T. Jones, presented him to Mr, W. . S. Cox, and. the old horse will be turned out for a spell a J Mr. Cox's paddocks near Cranbourne. " Elsa May, who came very hots at the last, won the Gailovray Handicap in a. ridiculously easy manner andthefiret favourite, Luydaie, very cleyerly appropriated the September Handicap. The Trotting Race was simply a faxce, as bjd "Rambler won by Ahy distance ; and Rebec6a, who -Was served pp very warm for the 'Free Entry Handicap, fairly romped home in front < of ; a very wteak field. The last , event 'of the afternobn, as related above, was the ran off of the dead-heafc between Black Prince 'and the unfortunate Hunrod, which terminated the' proceedings. The following ate the results Handsoaf Hurdle Race, of 15 sovs. Twioe round the course. Mr. W. E. P ovreaff W g Black Prince, 6 yrs, lOstAlb , _ - F.Hfil -fel Mr. T.

Black Prinete went to the front when the flag fell, followed by Marie and Nimrod, bub after they passed, the stand Marie took & strong lead of Blaok Prince, Nimrod and Nameless apparently beaten off. Marie led Blaok Prinoe some two lengths or so all the I Way, with Nimrod running third under the ! Whip, lengths behind, until they neared the home turn, whore Black Prince challenged fts, and Nimrod began to improve his posi tion. Marie was a little in front of Black Prince over the last hurdle, and Nimrod joining in, fifty yards fromlKxne, a desperate finish ensued between the three, terminating in a dead heat for first place between Black Prince and Nimrod, who just got up in the last stride ; Marie third a very short head behind the pair, Nameless fourth-. The run-off between Black Prince and Nim rod took place after the Free Entry Handicap, the last eventof the day on the card. Thebetting was 2 to I on Black Prince. Nimrod mad© strong running for the first time round, when he broke down, just after, he passed the stand. Finding that it was useless fo persevere with him, King discounted, and so all Blaok Prinoe had to do was to canter over the remainder of the course in order to secure the prize. 1 Handicap fob Galloways, of 10 sovs. Four furlongs.
