Nothing else, was backed. Tho Agent was quickest on his legs. Approaching the first hurdle, the ' little chestnut gave way to Tantaliser and the grey Student, who together- were first over the jump. Then followed. The Agent, with the favourite close at his heels. As they turned by the river side, Hunts man rushed up ' alongside the leaders, the others following him in order being Guard fish, Tantaliser, Sheet Anchor, Cockboat, The Agent, Star, and Student,: 'with ' Tattler still driving them along. At the first hurdle in this stretch mishaps bo-' ' curred, as both Star and Tantaliser; came down. Croker, the rider of the latter, was -. thrown on his head. As the field rattled' : along up towards the biidge, Guardfish had ' taken command, with Huntsman second, arid these positions were maintained for ' some time. As the field filed past tho ; abattoirs there was a ten lengths' gap between Guardfish and the next horse,' ?' Huntsman. Guardfish still further, in- ; creased his lead as they appreached the straight/and it seemed impossible that ' he ' could long continue to make the pace.' 'At !; the last hurdlo before coming into the ? ^straight for the first time Omadhaun /, '(Same down with Batty. Oma'dhaun' inter- ' ;fered with Sheet Anchor, who got the bridle rein wound about his fetlocksj but i;I although delayed for some time, he kept ' on his legs. Galloping up the straight.' .Guardfish ?w'aB 20 lengths in advance' !ofi: ?everything. After him came, 'fattier, ''? .Huntsman, Student, and- Cockboat- alto- gether, with Sheet Anchor last.; 'Around H by; the river Bide for tho second time H Guardfish was a clear 50 yards before the I others; and the rider ?was driving the horse I along vigorously. The Agent movod into I second place here, and running behind the I Adelaide horse were Huntsman, Tattler, H Student, and Cockboat, with Sheet Anchor I Btill' last. Long before they reached the I abattoirs the favourito -was palpably I beaten. Tattler and Cockboat were the I first pair who tried to reach Guardfish, but I both failed to get on terms, and tho puce ? ' jacket was still in tho van. Ferguson, on ? The Agent, delayed his rush until just I before turning for home, when he made up ? so much ground that in the straight he I' had the leader and Cockboat, the pair still I in front of him, perfectly at command. I Coining up the straight The Agent came I along, quietly overhauling Guardfish, and I getting a clear lead about the end of the I carriage ' paddock, cantered home an easy I winner by three lengths. Guardfish I finished gamely, a length and a half in I ' front of Cockboat, but was unable to make ? a race of it with The Agent. Tattler was I fourthi Student fifth, Huntsman next, and ? Sheet Anchor last. Time, Ginin. OJsec. I Grand National Stehplecbase— Of 15 I hots, each, with 500 added. The second I horie to reoeivo 50 bovs,, and the third 25 I * both, out of the stake.

Denmark, Forester, Progress, Sailor, E and Leo, 12 to 1 agst Mernder, and Gran I Ville. ?;. ;? ; : I Wymlet, Denmark, and Sailor, were. I quickest in , getting away, but Native led I the others past the stand, with Minerva, ? Leo.-and' Forestor just behind him, and I Governor- gblloping quietly in the rear. I Over the'first fenceJNative was followed in I order by Denmark, with Leo close behind I hiiri1,' and then in a group came Wymlet, I Mernder,' and Moonlight, while. Progress I was; whipping up the others. At the third I jump in the hollow near the bridge Gran I ville struck arid came down.- Along the I back ? were Native and Denmark ' close I ? together, being 10 lengths in . front of I Wymlet, Leo, and Merndor. Denmark' I and Native wore so .close together along the I f,ar-si^e of the course that the lead was ex I changed once, or twice. Wymlet dropped I back as they neared i he abattoirs, letting I Leo into, third place. At the abattoirs I Denmark was the leader, and he with I Native still held their 10 lengths advan I tage from Ballarat's second string Wymlet. I Minerva, Leo, Mernder and Trickett, showed I in advance of a group of other horses. I ' Thus far the horses had jumped beautifiilly, I and there was every prospect of a big field I atithe finish. Moonlight had baulked, but I his rider, sent him over and went after the I field .again.. As . they came towards the I row of solid fences running paralled with I the' straight tho order amongst the leaders was Denmark, Native, Wymlet, Minerva, Leo, 'Forester, Mender, and Morvari. When they left the grand stand once again behind thein the field was sadly reduced. Wymlet was nearly down at the jump ber fore the palings, but Corrigan pulled him onOhislegs and kept going. Denmark, Native,1 and Minerva passed along safely, but the big Mernder, who was lumbering behind her, struck and came down heavily over the stone wall. Almost' at the same instant ' Moonlight and Morven toppled over 'the wall and fell alongside him. Moonlight turned right over and crashed down 'on the saddle'. Scohie, who rode Morven, was on his feet in an instant arid rari.tb get clear of the horses following him, : i At the Iog3 Forestor was also down, and his rider in the white jacket rolled over 'pit ..his back. In the meantime' the leaders,' 'Denmark, Native, Leo, Minerva, and Sailor .were galloping, in a string, up towards the bridge, and all fencing cleverly. They went almost without alteration in thp leading ranks to the back of the course, where Governor, who had been far in the rear, but making up his ground, ran up into fourth place. Before they had reached the abattoirs Native had again deprived Denmark of the lead, and the next horses behind tho pair were Leo and Wymlet. ' The first fence on the home side of the abattoirs brought down Leo. A couple ? of seconds later Progress also tumbled over, and the two horses galloped away riderless. Native went on with a good lead, but the last fence' before getting into the straight running brought the lavender jacket to the grasa, and Den mark', with his big, weight, was left with nothing between him and the winning post. The' problem., quickly resolved itself in f ayour 'of W(ymlet, who came along gallop ing stoutly, :and won by five lengths, with Sailor 'two jegnths 'and a half in. advance: of 'Denmark. ',.
