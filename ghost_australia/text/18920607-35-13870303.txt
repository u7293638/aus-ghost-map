MEDICAL DESIGNATIONS. I TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-The question of " medical quacks " has come before the public rather prominently of late, and while interest in the subject is aroused I beg to make the following suggestion, i.e., that Parliament should pass a short Act making it penal for anyone not registered by the Medical Board to put up on their doors or subscribe themselves "authorised medical practitioner" or some such designation. The failure of the various bills which have hitherto been intro- duced, dealing with this matter, appears to have been from the fact that they embodied too much, but such an Act as above-mentioned would at any rate secure the public from unwittingly employing men who have not satisfied the duly- constituted tribunal that they are fit and propor persons to practise medicine.
