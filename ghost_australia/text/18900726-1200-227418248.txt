Ten drunks in one day is a, sign of the reviving prosperity of Framantle. * # # # # # # # # The Mayor of Guildford invites tenders for a quiet bull. We hope she'll get one. The proprietors of the Phoanix have had their claim iumped. They are lumping mad over it. J V * * # * # # • * « The D. N. of Tuesday last states that " Newfoundland is an island." "Who would have thought it ! # # * # # * * # * # A Newman has been appointed Supervisor to the Fre- , mantle Town Council. We hope he will supervise them— thev want a lot of looking after. * * * * * * * * * * H. M. Stanley had the tummy-ache when he was married. An aching void was also caused by the absence of Tummy, alias the P. of W. from the ceremony. # # * * * * * * * Sir Thomas Campbell's friends of Albany are going to present him with a purse of sovereigns in recognition of his pumvering * * efforts * in *connection * * with *the *Enabling * Bill. A. Gra Rosser, the Robins of Western Australia, has been hammering away like a coffin maker. He is doing a big business at the auctioneer's rostrum, and his many friends are glad of it. # * * # * * . » * * * The new paper in Fremantle is to be called Truth, as a tribute to the veracity of one of its proprietors. All being well it should 606 up serenely in a fortnight, a fact which it is As(h)well to mention. * * * * * * * * * The supper arrangements at the Fremantle Bowing Club Ball were supper-isingly good. The decorations were, however, rather ghastly in conception, namely, rows of sculls along the walls. This is one little joke. * * * * * * * * * We -fcere glad to notice from the West Australian's cable that despite his illness Stanley was able to be present at his own marriage to Miss Tennant. It would have been annoying # if he #had*been#compelled * # to send * a * substitute. * * It was feared that W. E. Marmion's bull pup had shuffled off this mortal coil. This, we are glad to learn, is not the case. He has been suffering from distemper, and has become nearly bald in consequence, so has gone to the Canning for a change of hair. * # # # # . # # # # The Brassey Baron is going to marry again, despite his former marital experiences. This time it is to an aristocratic and reposeful de Yere, and not to a skittish young person with a partiality for yachting, writing twaddle, and vinous excitement. * * * * * * * * * * P. Fitzpatrick, a new chum, is surprised that there is no debating society in Fremantle. He would not be surprised if he were aware that cheers were frequently mingled with brickbats, and applause with rotten eggs at "talkee-talkee" meetings at Fremantle. # # # # # # # * * # A well known Perth wit, referring to Lady Fraser's little act of kindness in giving the orphan girls a present of lollypops, draws the following distinction from an orphanage girl's point of view :—" Lady Broome and suite, Lady Fraser and sweets." # # # » * * * * * * Surely Sir Thomas Campbell has returned to Perth, and to his journalistic pursuits ! In last Tuesday's issue of the West Australian we find the unmistakable expression, "Certain London journalists wrote their singularly ill-informed, articles 011 the affairs cf this colony." # # # * # # # * # * The two representatives of the Prophet in "Elijah" last evening were the antipodes of each other in appearance, but one possessed a more or less Semitic cast of countenance, not inappropriate to the part. This one had a cold, and represented Eliiah the 'Tishoo-bite. * # # ' * * # # # # The " gentleman " from the South at the Rowing Club Ball who interruptedCommodore Gawler's nice little speech was considerably eat on by the President, but he came up smiling, and succeeded in making himself obnoxious to ' about a dozen others before the evening was over. * * * * * * * * * Commodore Gawler came out strong in regard to Responsible Government in addressing the guests at the F. R. C. Ball. Does he mean to stand for one of the Fremantle Divisions at the coming election ? We feel sure if the ladies had the suffrage they would vote for him " like one man," # #after# his #adroitly # flattering * # little * *speech. * One gentleman went down from Perth to the Rowing Club Ball by the 11 p.m. train, purposely for his supper, and then didn't get any. '1 lie lions started feeding at 11.30, and when the late arrival put in an appearance there were only a few bones, paper table napkins, and empty bottles left. *He says * you * will * never * get *him*on'that * racket * again. Sani Weaver is a bit of a wag, and has invited the Fremantle Town Councillors to aquatic sparts to be held on a big puddle in front of his hotel. This was " sark," but it might have drawn one or two thick-headed Councillors if the Dxily News hadn't kindly pointed out that Sam's advertisement was a joke. The jokist should have advertised free drinks and the Municipal Council would have rolled up like one man. # * # # # # # # # * The barque Pallas, bound for London, put to sea last Sunday in tow of the Rescue, but after getting some dis- tance out, it was discovered that some of her papers had not been sent aboard, and she was therefore obliged to put back à la Airlie. The captain, who is a German, says " Dat vas too bad, and by de smoking Josephat I vill make some poddy pay for it." We have not given the whole of his German expletives, which would not bear translation, but they were as full-flavored as Sauer Kraut. * * * * * * * * * * The virtuous Saving Influence says : " M uch as we dislike the law introducing a property qualification for members of the Assembly, it cannot be forgotten that it is the law." Any sensible man would have as little compunction in breaking this law as the average man has in doing a little mild smuggling. It is an immoral law, and there is little if any immorality in breaking it. We should like to know how many members of the existing Council are duly J and legally qualified. * * * * * * * * * There has been fowl play going on in Lake-st., vide the following advertisement in the Daily News :— ^ mHE person who yesterday caught aud . JL annexed three FOWLS belonging to a neighbour in Lake-street is requested to return them, or unpleasant consequences may follow speedily. The party is well known to the advertiser." The person who was guilty of the poultry act of robbing a hen coop had better produce the fowls unless he wants to be cooped up himself. Marshall being in the field, he may now be regarded as a field Marshall. Mr. A. Y. Hassell is a coming candidate for the Plantagenet District. His qualification is dollars. Long odds that the first Premier of Western Australia will be a West Australian native. Ten to one we name him. F. C. Piesse will offer himself as a candidate for the Williams. He is one of our best and most practical settlers, and should have a piesse-ful victory. Silas the Pilent will have a walk over for North Fremantle, where he was born, and which his enterprise has made into a flourishing little community. He deserves a quiet victory. Charley, alii s the Early Pearler is going to run for Beverley. His policy will be to make that lively township the centre of the Eastern Districts as against York, hie present constituencj\ Sir James Steera is likely to be opposed for Nelson by a dark horse. If all we hear be true the contest will be a a kean, and exciting one, as the dark horse is both a flyer and a weight carrier. 0 After considerable rasse-ilation 'Arry has decided to stand for the constituency which did him a good turn, and gave him an easy seat. The electors, fortunately, do not hold strong views in regard to the Chinese question. Pills remarked when he heard that Teddy the Contractor was going to run against him for St. George's Terrace, something which sounded like "Ungrateful brute," but which he says was only the quotation " Et tu Brute." It is said that R. F. Slioll, alias "big and burley Bob" will not stand for Carnarvon again, the electors having turned dog on him. He is said to have his eye on an adjoining constituency, but we are not aware if the electors have their eyes on him. W. E. Marmion is the only candidate at present mentioned for Central fremantle. Dingdong Congdon is looked on by some as a likely opponent, but his vote on the Property Qualification Clause won't give him a ghost of a show against his whilom friend. The London Daily News states that Mr. W. H. Smith will be appointed to the House cf Lords, anjl that Mr. Goschen will aBsume the leadership of the House of Commons. It is more likely, however, that Lord Hartington will lead his party on to destruction after Smith goes to the Lords. The Hon. John will have a walk over for Bunbury, as no one would have the temerity to oppose our future Premier on his native heath. We may expect our famous Commissioner of Crown Lands to issue hiB manifesto very soon, which we prophesy will include a vigorous Loan Policy, liberal Land Laws, and protection to Native Industries. Canny McKenzie is coming forward for Geraldton, and Mr. Hensman has been asked to stand for the other seat. The Irrepressible Teddy, alias Mr. Wittfnoom is likely to come forward as the representative of the Murchison Squatters, unless Mr. E. F. Darlôt will stand, when Teddy will present himself on behalf of the Flats, of whom he is already a good representative. 0 It was too bad of Mr. Byatt to ask Brother Traylen those very awkward questions in the West Australian. Can it be true that the reverend printer pays his mechanics less than five bob a day, and a leading hand five and sixpence per diem, and also employs a number of girls and boys at the case, including his own children, after school hours ? The public is yearning for a reply. It is variously rumoured that Sir Malcolm Fraser will go on a Europsan tour when his term of office expir?e, and on the other hand that he will remain in the Colony and present hims .'lf for one of the constituencies, sir Malcolm is well eutitled to a rest, but if lie is determined to keep in harness one would have imagined that his ambition would have induced him to be on the look out for one of the smaller Governorships. o The smart G. T. Simpson is coming forward for York alias the Eastern Goldfield. He is tolerably certain of getting the miners' vote, en bloc. He is an energetic aud ahle man, both in mind and method, and would make a capital member of our first free parliament. Geordie would also make things lively. There would be no fear of his being sat on after his experiences with Frasiir's shareholders. We will back him to hold his own even in a South American legislature, where such arguments as pistols and bowie knives are resorted to. o Cr. T. Harry Marshall has seriously announced his intention of presenting himself for South Fremantle at the forthcoming Legislative Election. We are anxious to read the Councillor's address to the electors. No doubt it will be a very "floury" one, if not exactly well-bread. The < 'ouncillors will, of course, ask the electors to roll up, and will promise that so far from indulging in levity, i.e., undue lightness, he will give full weight to their wishes. It is said that Mr. James Lilly, J. P., will sit as Cr. Marshall's Chairman of Committee, but we can't believe this. He ia more likely to sit on Marshall. In reply to a correspondent signing himself "Coming Candidate," (Perth), the facetious editor of the Albany Observer writes :—" The only qualifications you need to woo and win the voters of this electorate are an elastic conscience—this is the first requisite of every politician—the air of a saint out in the wet, the voice of a turtle dove cooing to its mate with a slight nasal intonation, the eloquence of a chaffcutter, the appearance of cleric down on his luck, the faculty to wriggle like a serpent, and the cunning of Mephistopheles and you're right as rain ; send along your ad., cash in advance, and we will secure you a committee as long as your arm, and a joyful resurrection in—well, ahem !"
