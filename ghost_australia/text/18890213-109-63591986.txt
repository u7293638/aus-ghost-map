In the horror of her position, anur ronnied by rough and brutal soldiers of the King's guard, she found a momentary chance of escape, and rushing through the long gallery, ran to seek her husband who was at the moment hearing mass at the chapel, to cling to his knees, to, soften 'with her tears .that heart of adamant. The guards at their utmost; speed followed the poor distracted creature. Just as she reached the1 .King's closet they overtook her .ands dragged her back, her. frenzied screams( resounding through the palace, The gal lery is now. used as a sort of lumber. room, :bt still the shrieks of the agonised Queen are to be heard at times.
