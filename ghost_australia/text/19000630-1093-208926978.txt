As a musical critic Mr. .Sutherland Edwards has naturally come into contact with .musicians and. librettists.

This is'how it once worked . out in iflie case of Macready:'-'Mr. Mac ready, the' great'performer, came out last aright as 'Macbeth, and showed himself thorough!}" at'Kome'in the character of the_ atrocious .villain';* He is, indeed, a", monster." iWith i.long experience of the stage we can call tb "milid :uoi. one so base, so brutal," so' bloodthirsty:- '"It is difficult to see him without at once perceiving that 'be is a miscreant of the worst species; while to tear him-speak- is.'at once to understand that not the slightest confidence can be placed in-^he rascal; ;" The wretch will ap pear .'again, to-morrow evening,' and will egain/'be'hissed and hooted (as happened to him several times last night) by an in dignant-public, -which hates treachery and execrates murder.- At the end of the per 'formatrce-'.Mr. Macready received sevetil . summonses.'. _ . ..

There - are .many stones of the eccen tricities of the late Mr. Frank Marshall, the Shakespearian .scholar, and author ot onevor two plays of- considerable merit. .Mr.r Marshall -was not a sate man .to in dulge in rude pleasantries with, as appears from the following anecdote:--;'He had in vited a number of-friends'to dine with him. it.liis house iii Hans-place.

"Do they, indeed, said. .MaTshall'- verv bitterly. .?! have only one remark to make.1 -Reserving bur observa-; iion, lie ran# the bell, and when the ser van t'-appeared, «aid'in a stern voice, - "-No dinner:to-day.'." , Mr. Edwards cites'many examples ot tne want of comprehension ol one branch of art for another. He quotes a letter to Halle, in which Ruskin'. was rash enough to put his views .on mnsic to paperrand. says tnatr mrheniGiistave Don: began.; to" illustrate'the "Idylls of the King,"- Tennyson-did- not .sven' know', him by name/'-'.

The Paris recollections furnish some in teresting gliinpses of the.- warm , friend ship 'between. Berlioz and Vincent Wal lace, the composer :dmiwrline" and "Mari tana.". "' . y '' ' *rI" niet.-Berlioz- aganf jn' Paris, where he was-ofteri, at-Sax's, j£nd constantly "in the £ociety :ot-~V rncent /V^allace; whose acquain tance he had made jn London. He knew .Wallax^a. compositions only1 through hear ing -Wallace ,hiaiself' play them on the piano.-. But-fie thought highly of them, as also didTmajy. other of Wallace's French friends; .aji'd Berlioz -.tells iis in one oFhis books-Jtiat; the management of" the Paris Op^S'^Hbuse was about to entrust Wal la^e wi^h a. libretto,when suddenly he left Europe. Wallace tieing "essentially a co'm . Jxiser of melodies."; (andNsometimes very graceful ones), Berlioz; ought not to have valued .-him much as'an opera-tic composer. But"who" carries his artistic principles into private life?. Was not Xiiszt chiefly known as an airanger of airs ? extracted from the very opetas which Wagner loathed? But this in no way prevented his being adop ted, into the "Liszt-Wagner' combination. Wallace was- an agreeable man, a delight? ful talker; and 'his stories of. his own ad ventures in : outlandish parts , were not made less interesting by the fantastic de tails witfh which, in the ardor of narration,, fee sometimes adorned-them. His-gorgeous tales of .life in 'South America, his pic turesque \ legends of adventures in the wilder regions of 'Australia, made a deep impression, on Berlioz, who has reproduced cue; of Wallace's Australian romances in language as. glowing as that of Wallace himself." i' -r - Eugene Viyier, musician, .diplomatist, ircost-chanrriag of men, and "spoiled child of nearly every Court in Europe," natural ly provides -Mr. Edwards with a-fund of anecdote from his description of the Em peror-{Napoleon .as -"the most gentlemanly Emperor I know,", to his blowing of soap bobbles at a window in St. Petei^burg. eansing the obstruction of the traffic and the Tsar Nicholas.
