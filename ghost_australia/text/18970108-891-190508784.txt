Federal Spirit. ! Ono of the Melbourne newspapers is in a | bud way oyer the luck of a federal spirit in Australia. It would appear from the ! jeremiads poured out by that paper that no one but itself hoe tho federal spirit. If this is the case, why further trouble about federation ? Eych the ghost of poor old Partes would be disturbed could it hear the things now said of him. It is charged against him that with all his efforts in regard to federation he never made tho slightest attempt to put tho consti tution of 1S91 before tho Parliament of New South Wales. Quito right: he did not. Within a year after the passing of that con stitution by the convention ho moved, no doubt at the instance of Victoria, that the people elect a convention, and that that convention should frame a constitution to bo accepted by tho people. This was a short and easy method with anti- federationists. Our Sir Hugh Nelson is very roughly handled. Ho should feel very bad on reading what is said of him. But Benjamin's mess of abuse is reserved for Mr. Reid, who lias been "the mo3t cynical in his anti-federal spirit." Tho curse pronounced on him is because lio passed a frcetrade tariff for New South Walcs.when he knew that federation would come first, a reformed tariff afterwards, and that that reformed tariff would be the present tariff of Victoria. Mr. Kiugstou, Premier of South Australia, u is but one whit more' eiucero " (tho other man is said not to bo sincere at all), and' Sir John Forrest, of West Australia, is nearly, if not ijuito as bad as the Premier of Queensland. An example parallel to this may be found in the old lady who was not quite sure of tho orthodoxy of any one save herself and her husband, and sbo had her doubta abont John.
