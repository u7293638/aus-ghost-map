HIGHLAND √èIIIIIVIIS. Duci.u.ii JM'CAUI. was a professed thief in tho Highlands, and somotimos took young lads into his sorvieo us apprentices to tho saino business, With one of these hopeful youths, who lind recently engaged with him, ho agreed ono night to proceed upon an excursion-tho ap- prentice to steal ti wether, and Dugald himself to steal kale. It was also ngreed that thoy should, after being in possession of (heir booty, meet ,in tho kirk-ynrd, where they were pretty suro of not being molested, as it gol the name of being" haunted by a ghost. Dugald, as may well bo supposed, arrived first at the piuco of rendezvous, and, sitting on a gravestone, amused himself until tho np'prciitice should arrive with tho wether, in a neighbouring farmhouse a crippled tailor happened to be al work, and the conversation having turned upon tho story of tho kirk- ynrd being haunted, tho tailor boldly censured homo young men present for not having courage to go and speak to the supposed apparution, adding that if ho had the use of his limbs ho would hait: nu hesitation in duing it himself. Uno uf the young men, nettled al tho tailor's remarks, proposed taking tbe tailor on his back to the kirk-ynitl; mid, as the tailor could not well recudo from what he had biitd, oil'they went. The moment they entered the kirk-yard, Dugald M'Caul baw them, and think- ing it was the apprentice with a wether on his back, ho said in a low tono of voice, as they approached, " J s he fat I'' " Whether lie bo fat or lean," cried the young niall, " there he is to ye j" mid throwing down the tailor, run off as hard nshe could. On entering the farm-house, to his utter astonishment, ho found the tailor cluso on to his heels ; intense fear having sup plied him with the longloht use of his limbs, which, it is said, ho retained for over after.
