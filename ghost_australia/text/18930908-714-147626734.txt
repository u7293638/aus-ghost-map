HEADING IN BED. The Glebe begins an article with the words Of course we are all agreed that reading in bed is pernicious." My dear old Globe (comments Dr. Gordon Stables), we are nothing of the sort. By the crimson hood of my toga, no. If my opinion is worth a penny piece, then you shall have it, and, to use a somewhat common phrase, I hare the courage of my convictions. I am turned 50. I have read in railway carriages, read on the sofa, and read in bed all my life ; I read myself to sleep, or nearly to sleep, every night. Yet my eyesight is splendid. I can read the smallest type without spectacles by the light of the moon or a prisoner's dip. My constitution has not been shattered, and I assure you I have never been burned to death in bed. Why should yon be bnrned to death in bed, I wonder? What nonsense! Your candle is on a table by yonr bed side. If you do drop off, and the candle does burn itself out, what is the harm ? Oh, dear, oh, dear 1 what a lot of old wives there are in" the world! But the truth is that, unless a man is a navvy, a tiller of the soil, or toiler of the deep, and can drop off as soon as his head touches the pillow, it is good for his brain health to read in bed. If there is the ghost of a chance of his beginning to think after lying down, the book or magazine must at once be had recourse to. This keeps the mind on an even keel till the waves of sleep begin to waft the soul to dreamland. Let him, just before this, put out the caudle, aud a good night's rest will be his guerdon. To think in bed is self murder. To read in bed is life. In this advice lie sense and science both combined. Mrs. Cleveland has a manner of scenting her rooms which is both unique and dainty. She does not employ Chinese powders nor perfumed woods to burn away in vases, but. she lays little bags of heliotrope and rose sachet under the carpets in the corners, and the perfume, smothered, at it were, lasts for months and is at the same time mysterious nnd-beautiful.
