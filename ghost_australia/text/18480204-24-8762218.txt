Out of doors, not the shadow of doubt existed us to this most proper and perfectly constitutional bfoceeding.'and we were utterly astonished when the Attorney-General rose to oppose ,the,,',motion,, and upon what grounds, does the reader imagine? Why, because 'first, it was contrary to, all, precedent, and, secondly, ' it would establish a a very dangerous precedent' ' Oh ! that till technical and equivocating " law work," as Jeremy" Bentham termed it, was wiped away for ever, with all the special pleading rubbish attached to its practice ! Doubtless the hon, and learned member had his back, and he " stuck to it;" and so did another lion., learned, and financial member, the Colonial Treasurer, (of an empty, chest), who opposed the motion of Capt. Swanston because it was contrary to some fusty old as connected with the practice of our to positive Parliament. We should mention that Mr. Gregson seconded Captain Swanston's motion, and I supported it in reply to the speeches of the two honorable and learned Government members who opposed it. The question was put to the vote, and the motion was lost by Mr. Kermode voting AGAINST IT ! Fellow colonists ! Mark these things, and marKThera' diligently : times are coming when we shall have in the way of legislation something more respectable than the present packed Council, and when it will depend upon yourselves to construct it properly or otherwise : the sham patriots you will, of course, exclude ; your true friends you will not fail to remember. The bearing of counsel having been re- fused most wrongly and unjustly, we must saying needed no ghost from the grave to tell us the result of the next order of the day-the second reading of the Doubts' Bill, thereafter a rather stormy discussion, passed also, and by the following votes : ron THE MOTION. Inglorious Majority Government Officials. Mr. Gregson. Kerr. Kermode. Dunn. AGAINST THE MOTION. Glorious Minority The Chief Justice. Capt. Swanston. ' Fenton. Mr. Dry. O'Connor. , , Now, by these extraordinary acts and proceedings, principles and consequences of the most momentous character are involved ; the right of petitioning one of the most important and valuable to the British sub- sections virtually, nay absolutely, denied, and by the passing of this Abolition Act the Council have taken upon themselves to legalise their mischievous blunders, contrary to all reason, propriety, and justice. What may be the ultimate result of these very extraordinary proceedings we dread to contemplate, but " time will show."
