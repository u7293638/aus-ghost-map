AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY. A most circumstantial ghost story, which may interest tho Psychical Society, is disturb ing the mind of New York. The editor of the New York World vouches for tho good faith of his informant â€” a professional man of high re pute. The house is a new ono, and is lei out in flats, Tho following are a few manifesta tions as told by an eye-witness' who went scep tical, but soon found that somothing more than ordinary was up. First of all there was much knocking at the front door. It was watched open and closed, before and behind, but the knocking stili came, always in four strokes, sounding like blows 6truck with billets of wood, Then came bell-ringings in all parts of the bouse. Tappings were heard on the glas3 of the windows, tho coats of the hoarders fell down from the hat-rack, each falling a yard apart. The plush cover of a roundtable standing in the hall gracefully floated on to the floor. A clotbes-prop was hurled over the top of a portikrc ; the walking-sticks standing in the hall were flung up in different directions, and before the scared residents had recovered a leaf from an oak dining-table was hnrled through the hall for 20 feet, striking the wall and coming to the ground with a fearful crash. Another table took a series of somersaults. Such violent " goings-on" had such a bad ef fect upon some of the family that tbey began to think of retiring, when a frightful shriek echoed throughout the whole dwelling, pierc ing, and evidently coming from no human throat, followed by " soft, insinuating1' whistles. Iu the evening "it" tried a few notes in arpeggio, and was successful in keep ing time and tuno with tho piano. The tone of the w'histlo was sometimes that of a fog horn ; at other times sounding like tho " blow ing in tbe neck of a bottle." AU this is said to be a " plain, truthful statement of facts," substantiated by fivo witnesses. Bevies of policemen have searched in vain, and a curious English detective has been baffled.
