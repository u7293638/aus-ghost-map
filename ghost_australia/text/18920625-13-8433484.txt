CURRENT LITERATURE. -. It is the custom among artists when elevated to the Academy to paint what is called it diploma picture, a warrant at once of thin w patroness and the discrimination of those by whom they were elected 1 An was to judge of the works of newly made professions in a like was) a justification of their dignity * There is Mr Froude who to the great disturbance of Mr freemans ghost, has just been made Regius professor of modern history at Oxford, almost simultaneously with which advancement he has brought out a new volume, entitled The Spanish Slot y of the Armada (Longmans), with other casings This was not the first time that AL 1 ronde, who is loud of showing his knowledge of the Spanish archives, which presumably includes a knowledge of the Spanish language and history, has treated us to studies of Spanish life and character In the present instance the stud), as usual with Mt 1 lode, has involved the smallest possible labour, for though he talks of the archives of Spain, Paris, and Vienna in, which have been newly) opened to (the historical student his own work in connection with the Spanish ArmAda might nell had been written without being very) fat held Roman the SW postal dis-

1 Froude tells us of a great desire on which he had once made lated of writing the lives of Charles and Philip II - monarchs to whom had fallen the task of confronting the storm which had broken over the rest of J mope Mr 1 roude s own despatches had shown him that the picturing opinions about these two ounces required wide cor section They) were not in his own opinion, rael 11) ' reactionary bits He) had to deal with a world in arms, with a condition in which society was disintegrated by a universal Muututd revolt, of which the outcome was still utterly un- certain that all this means, except that Mr I roude, had time availed, would have whitewashed Philip is even as he has attempted to w limewash Henry) VIII, and made out the Retaliation in J stops to have been an unholy) uprising of an incendiary) and wicked spirit, the partial suppression of which, in the interests of civilisation and of Ebert), entitled Philip 11 to a Ililli place among the world's benefactors, wedonotlnow On the whole, upon the evidence contained in two of the papers contributed to this volume, we may congratulate ourselves that Mr J route has not persevered with his design For that design he was singularly ill equipped beyond the one "out of style of which perhaps too much has been made-he does not possess the) qualification for writing the history of so momentous a period He is singularly deficient in judgment, in b dance, in taste, m sagacity), even man dustry and in knowledge as to the opening sketch of the Invincible Armada, it is undoubtedly) spirited and interesting Except that it hardly) makes enough of the hard fighting of Griuehnes, when for a couple of d) s the 1 English ships were in close conflict with the Sp music, it is a picturesque account of the cruise of the Armada up the British Channel, and of the disastrous finish of the boasted invincible fleet in the north and west of the British Islands Some new particulars respecting the equipment of the by the fleet and the
