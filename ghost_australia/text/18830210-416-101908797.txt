But if we know that God has spoken wo cannot question His words. The only obstacle to our having f-iithinthem ia our security as to our un derstanding them. The Sacred Scriptures are God's words to ue, and what is our secu rity that these ore God's words but the s ac tion of the Cutholiu Chutch. Away from this sanction, who could deiermino what God revealed to man ? Men might road the history of religion as founded by the Apos tles of Christ, and conclude that ita estab lishment was miraculous; the same might be ooncluded as to the continuhtion of the Catholic Cliurch, for it is wonderful, indeed, to consider an institution living' on, genera tion eftergeneration, so unlike all other in stitutions ; change marks-everything; else, but she works on without cliaugp. She holds the'Sacred Scriptures as God's words, but she does more, bhe saves lior childien from being< tossed ubout by every wind of dootriae—by men misunderstanding and misintefpreiting tho Sacred Sciipiiires,. for she delineB what her children ate to believe With certainty, and williout doubling. By Faith we believe what God has taught, and where can we have any security.for what God has (ought outside the Catholic Church. ? St. Pt ul in his Epistle to, tho, .Hebrews (11.1) says " Now faith is the sub stance of things to be hoped, for the evidence of things .that appear not." - We believe whBt God has taught, not because we niiiy see them or understand them, but because we have divine authority for them. Matters of faith may be obscure, may I e above our comprehension, but when the Teacher' divinely constituted, proposes matters' of> faith, the authority of the Catholic Church offers to reason amply sufficient groundstfor believing without doubting. Men with high intellectual gifts, or in some favourable cir cumstances, may propound opinions in rtli gion, and may cariy followers with ^thein. But ottier men',' too, having the same rig lit, may differ with them, and propound, their, own opinions. Never censingV conflict^, change und doubt, are the natural conse quences, if there be no authority to settlu their disputes, and God's word misinterpret ed and''abused is made •reeponsib!e^lj»r,,,eii.,(; Faith,' it iB true, is a gift of Gud^^d'-mtn cannot,possess this gift without ,His grace, but it is a gift prepared for all who sincerely •wish to reoeive it As St.-Paul to Timothy (2.4) says "It is the will' of God thst'fill men be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth." It is not God's will that any. should perish, but as he that beltevuth not ehftll.be condemned, it is His will -to; have all come to the knowledge of ' the > truth.' Human feeling, human; passion,' prejudice'1: and self-interest may obsiure the lruth> of. God, and keep men away from nccep'ihg ii. But this truth necessary for SBlvationJ as it is God's revelation to nian, must be one'for all, and for all times, ns^ St. Paul pays' " Hold the form of sound words,'which thou hast heard .from me in fai h,j and in\thejlove» •whioh'iB^'iri " Obrist JYsus,'1 Keep ihe'"gb'od committed in trust tothee by thc.ililyGhost, :vrhodwelleth inns."

(St. ■ James 11 14) ; ;and : again i"'As the'body' without the spirit is dead, so> faitU^'without' good works is dead." If we (ire* then to believe what God hns tiiught, we ule to _ do what the "demands; and for one as for the other he bas sent' His .Teacher, for the Spirit of God abides with Hia cburoh to keep ber- .iu Hiq ways.
