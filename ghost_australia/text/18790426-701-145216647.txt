SHAKESPERE ON THE CIRCU LATION OF THE BLOOD. Was Shakespere the discoverer of the circulation of the blood ? Brutus ad dressing Portia says : — You are my true and honourable wife ; As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart. Again Warwick, by the bedside of the murdered Gloucester, exclaims : — See how the blood is settled in his face ! Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost, Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and blood less Being all descended to the laboring heart ; Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, Attracts the same for aidauce 'gainst the enemy Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again. But see, his face is black, and full of blood. These passages have been quoted to show that Harvey's discovery was known to Shakespere. ' Julius Cccsar ' is supposed to have been written between 1G03 and 1607 ; Shakespere died in 1616\. Haruey began to lecture 011 anatomy in 1615, and the book in which he gave to the world his dis covery did not appear till 1628, but he settled in London iu 1604, and thus he and Shakespere may have met ; but after all, as Dr. Willis remarks in the extracts referred to, Shakespere refers to nothing more than the current opinion that the blood was in motion within the heart and vessels, particu larly the veins. — Literary World.
