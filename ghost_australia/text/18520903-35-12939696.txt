JOTTINGS FROM THE NOTE BOOK OF A GOLD SEEKER. No. II. I A DASH AT THE ROAD AND MELBOURNE. August 25. "IIuKKUifortheroad,theroad,"gailyshouted was on the morning of last Monday week and as we passed by the Colonial Treasury, that blight goal of all our hopes, and he thought ourselves of the proximate chance of our calling upon that most obliging of persons, the treasurer, with a receipt note for £500 worth of the precious metal, I need not observe how radient our countenances were in contemplation of the thought. "Brightidea," said George, who by the way was the leader of the party, " capital, by Jove,"- and like the woman and 'hebasketofcggs.theidea becoming contagious forthwith we proceeded to speculate upon all manner of projects, and the Lord knows how far we might have gone in this ideal nonsense, had it not been that one of the party, in crossing the first piece of puddle land, got stuck in the mud-not figuratively, but literally-so fist that all hands had to assist in extricating him. First mishap, however. " Won't be the last," exclaimed an old file who had just joined. *' Stop that croaker," shouted George, and before the words were well out of his lips he measured his length on the aforesaid mud, much to the amusement of all hands. We had now fairly started, and for the first mile or so the road, if i i road it can at all be termed, was pretty fair, j not much above ankle deep, but that at least. As we set out early, we reached Flemington I before breakfast, and here again we were doomed to disappointment. No breakfast to I be had at the inn. Had some wretched ale, land some bread and beef out of own swag, and after a short rest proceeded to wend our way. | I need not give you a detailed account of one a day and a half up, and ditto down, us the cir j circumstances of the trip were fully and graphically described by one of the party was" a lie said that nothing but the courage of a lion would face it. Shortly after we left Flemington we came upon one of the numerous flats which abound in this colony and oh, mercy, still a flat mud, mud, mud, not uncle or knee deep, but up to your middle. An interminable ocean of mud. Nothing but mud, with the exception of a sprinkling of what are termed "crab-holes." And to help us in our difficulties, or rather to soften not only our precious. persons, but to render still more fluid the seemingly interminable quag through which we were wading, it poured rain in bucketsful. It was in fact, The film RIIOTO and the usual follow, And tbecU'Kilntc bush where'er we go We tried to leave the beaten path once or twice and bush it, but it was no go The soil there was too wet to bear us up, and too thick to allow us to wade it, and back again to the bullock track we were freed Oh ye lecturers on temper nee ' how it would have made you start to behold with what çus to each man quaflVd a glass of brandy hot when we reached the Lady of the Lake and there made our abiding place for the night the charges at the place I am informed are moderate compared with other hotels on the road and as a fair indication I may state them 'Brandy hot, sir, yes sir, one two three, five, five of you, sir fifteen shillings " Supper for five, one pound (five, sir Breakfast ditto ditto Ale, bad, wretched ten shillings for beating a horse ? five ditto for leave to enjoy the luxury of a roof, sleeping being clearly out of the question Here, too, I observed the old manoeuvre of land rds Our host and in fact the whole establishment, might be regarded as a peripatetic hue and on and as such might be useful to the police It was mud and rain all day, and long, woebegone stories of bushrangers, robberies, murders, S.C, all night And then the fleas ' Next day brought us to the Deep Creek, and to the termination of our journey for the present at least the roads were just the same as the day previous in mud up to the beheaded meeting with a turn party, who declared that it was impossible to proceed much higher, us the loads were in a dreadful state, that the hills were covered with snow, as indeed we had ocular demonstration of the fact next day, when it was a few inches deep on the ground we deemed it expedient to return and slowly and rather dejectedly did we wend our way back to this vile and filthy place We reached town again on thursday, and the same day two men were drowned in attempting to cross one of the creeks near to where we determined upon turning Melbourne is becoming more crowded every day Crowds upon crowds are landed daily at the wharfs Every steamer from Launceston and Sydney is crammed, and every vessel that enters the harbour has the full complement of p passengers We have had on arrival this week from California direct, and one from Liverpool, with four hundred people on board the wet weather has not at all improved the appearance of Melbourne, nor the health of its inhabitants Since my return I have poram burned the city and its environs pretty much and let measure on that my first impressions of the absolute necessity which exists for some responsible body take g active steps for its sanitary reformation, were rather under than over the mark This may not just force UM. If prominently before the eye of the can d observer who confines himself to the few principal streets, but let him diverge in of any of the by lanes which abound here, let him go into any of the *e cond rites streets where the mills and ware houses of the merchants are,- and if he be not forcibly impressed with the importanceotbome steps being taken, then all I can say is, that his sense of smell and sight must be very poor indeed I had occasion the other evening to go into i one of these prices, and I assure you, were I actuary to an Insurance Company I should require 25 per cent ad national premium on the life that was occasionally risked on such voyages of exploration And oh, what a state of filth and squalor presents itself when you enter one of these places of a ole Dirt, bare, and open, the boards scarcely firm ng a barrier against the admission of the light of heaven and the shingles put on in general as if the roof was intended for a shower but in wet weather And t doing of shown baths puts me in mind of bulls in general, of which there is a great lack here there is only one b us at all here, and it is inaccessible just now in consequence of the flood in the Yarra I do not know of a better speculation at present than the establishment of a bath and washhouse Oh, for a Lord Ashley her that some person with left lence enough to induce the Government of this place to do some thing to promote the health of its bill dut rats would take the matter up for here it is no libel on the people both ' gentle and simple, to call them the " uren unwashed I have visited the public gardens, and gained but little beyond a ducking for my pains They bear no comparison with U ever with your gardens in Hyde Park, nor with any p lblic garden that I have seen they are badly 1 is out, and are situate d too close to the river to he pleasant in winter A day am not the auctioneers here would repay the trouble, were it only for the purpose of seeing how they may see things and also the prices, if one were commer rally inclined ; but not having any interest in the prices of but r, eggs, bacon, clue e kc , I strolled i at?
