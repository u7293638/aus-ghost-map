! ' ? - ? ? / WESTBURY ODDFELLOWS SPORTS On Saturday last sports under the auspices of the Loyal Westbury Lodge of Oddfellows were held in the show grounds, when the attendance of the public was fairly large, the takings at the gate being over .£10. The running track, was, on account of the dry weather which has prevailed, in 'a very bad state and ' quite unfit for bicvele ridinff. The arranee ments;were by no means first-class, but an allowance must be made for the fact that it was an initial meeting. ' The sport was exceedingly slow,. and monotonous; this 'beingvdue to the large amount of time wasted during the afternoon, the 'specta tors becoming wearied by the long inter vals between1 the; different events.' The programme was not: got through until about seven o'clock, although ' the meeting' might have been brought to a conclusion at least two hours earlier. ; The; fields; for the majorityciof the -events were- exceed; inglylargeiiithere being no less : than' 15^ tarters in-^the Maiden Race, and the acing. on: the , whole was. fairly good. * i Ther bicycle ?, ? ; racei ::. only : : brought ' out ? ?'? two start era, others refusing to compete be cause of the Btate of the ground. One of tho most interesting events of the after noon- was the horse jumping, for which the judges wereMessrs.T. Keating.D.Maokay, and S. Scott, but some complaints were heard regarding their decision.1 During the progress of the jumping an unfortunate ac cident occurred, an old man, Mr. D.Brennan, being knocked down by one of the .horses. He was unconscious for a time, but beyond a severe shaking he was not much hurt. At these gatherings the spectators gene rally rush acros3 'the. horse's track, and it is not surprising that an accident occasionally occurs. Mr. F. J. \Betts worked hard as aecretary, but he certainly had too much to do. The judges in. the foot races in one or two instances made mistakes, but this wasowing to the fact that they listened too much to the noisy pleadings of the excited contestants. We would recommend for future guidance that they give their decisions promptly and without listenirig to either, cotripetitors or . the public. The judges on Saturday were considerably hamperedi by the public rushing to the tape at the conclusion of each race. The Perth Band was on the ground duringthe afternoon and played a number of selec tions. ..The following are the results of the various events : — ????? ?? i lOOYardB Flat Race— Open to all who have not won public money.

On running off, .M'Lean won without difficulty.
