THE RING. . .,3?ian:T.m.coME.:-,,jí ,. .Ï Varch 20.-J. Sullivan and.Toni. Sparkes, £50 aside. . Tho fight botwcon 'Kelly arid Bingham scorns but little likoly to como to anything. Tho baokors of tho latter aro now,anxious to draw stakes ; and no wonder, whon thoir. man had; not tho ghost of a chance, that thoy don't care to put him in tho ropos any moro. Tho duty of tho rofcroo appears rory simplo, and that of tho merç is, ovi-, dently, to, abide by his decision ; but it seems a very hard caso that tho winning man should bo compelled to loso his money, cither from tho indecision of tho ono, or from tho unwillingness of ono of tho othors to continuo tho con- test. ', AVe.hopo tho affair will bo pvoporly settled; it is tho froquont occurronco of such " barneys " which des- troys tho, prestige of the P. lt., and rondors it now al- most impossible to got'a " mill " brought oiT properly.. Having had nothing to do with tho matter in quostion, wo give no opinion upon it ; hut wa would warn .the would be patrons of tho Bing, that they only injuro themselves hy these attempts to "alido", whon they soo they havo , made a bad bargain. , , , ,
