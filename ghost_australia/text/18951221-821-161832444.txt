A Chmsthas Wish. I wish I were Father Christmas, Just for this one sole night I From house to home with Santa Clans I would go by lantern-light. We would creep so softly, softly, Nor make tho ghost of a noise. Each with a Back on bis beaded bade, For love of the girls and boys I One of tho beBt ways to carve the Christmas turkey is to drill a hole through fowl, didi and table, and then insert an iron rod m tho aperture, screwing a large nut on each end. This obviates the necessity of the amateur carver placing one foot on tho jrreast of the bird and tho other on the chair, wliieh looks ungainly, and is not exactly nice.
