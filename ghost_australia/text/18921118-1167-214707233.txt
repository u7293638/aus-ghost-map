W.C.T.U. Column. Port axi> Semaphore W.C.T.U. — During the week set aside for special prayer and self-denial evangelistic services were held every evening at the Purt and Semaphore W.C.T.U. Reading-rooms, Robestreet. The attendance and attention were good. We much appreciated the help of the members of all the local Christian Endeavour Societies, who rendered valuable assistance both in praise and prayer. Mr. Hounslow very kindly attended, and conducted most of the meeting- 1 - Me?dameg Henderson, Hatnence, Donnel, Miss McLeland, aud Mr. Haoience alio gave addresses, which were acceptable. At the late W.C.T.U. Colonial Convention it was resolved that November 1 and 8 should be set apart as a week of prayer and self-denial for the Uniou in Sooth Australia, and that the money given by members and friends be sent to the colonial general funds as a thank-offering for blessings received through the Union. It is gratifying to note that the resolution has been acted upon by a large number of the Union.*, and while as yet the financial result is unknown reports have come in »l meetings tliat bare been marked with the presence and the power of the Holy Ghost. Members bare had their spiritual life strengthened, and several friends have b*+n led to give tbemaeSves to Christ. Meetings were Iwld daily at 11 aw. and 7.4-» in the Bechsbite UaU.
