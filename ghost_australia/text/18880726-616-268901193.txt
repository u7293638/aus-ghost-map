XaMea’ Column, ! ! Bachcloy s Mali. By If.- C. Dodge. Hurrah! hurrah for Bachelor’s Hall; The Queen's away anil I’m monarch of all j I don’t have to hang up my coat or my hat, And when I get lonely I talk to the cat. I come when I like, and I go when I choose. The finest cigars help me scatter the blues; Nojiundles I carry, and nothing 1 buy ; There’s no one to care about—only “ big I.” I revel in wildest confusion around ; There isn’t a thing in its place to be found ; My books aud newspapers, they litter the j That hasn’t for weeks seen the sight of a broom. There’s clothing or something on every My bed’s never made, but it’s little 1 enre; 1 sleep like a top, for there's no one to call— 1 take solid comfort in Bachelor's Hall. I've'used all the dishes and now it’s my fate To eat, when I’m home, on the back of a I’m learning to cook, but, alas, I confess I choose to go hungry than swallow the But, Bachelor’s nail with its comfort and Is almost too spooky for regular diet; No children live in it to welcome their clad, No supper is waiting, no wife—0, so glad, No ! Nothing but ghosts of the loved ones Inhabit this tomb where alone I must stay, Compelled to break silence by having a ebat With my woful companion, the Btrange act ing cat. 0, gladly I’ll yield [my crown sceptre and The Kingly delights of a Bachelor’s Hall To the Queen of the Home when she come* with her train To wisely and lovingly over me reign.
