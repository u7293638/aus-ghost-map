í -ME MELBA DIVORCE SUIT. THE HISTORY OF THE CASE. A Lindon presB correspondent writes :-A '^reW^B'TIBTTSasational nonsense has, ne doubt, been cabled to Australia during this last week concerning the Armstrong divorce snit. The plain truth ÍB said to be as follows : .-^be^^'AiolBt^^eamo from Aus tSaTJj^Miftame 'iBélbá -wade a desperate "attempt # Bve"~wiïh Tiîm;"'**Sir-tast»V-an« ^w»''!w$re''<<enti*e1^ rtotfcew.í SttUehe trlea, as ehe.oxpUins,1 to be abe, and fcï nBborfc tí«ó life tan falrkr smoothly ,.<*. V t.'s-tTÄ.f «a,, - r ¿. ., * With thé reunited couple. When however, the novelty of being a great prime donna e Tiusband wore off, Armstrong e^natvajUy*'^6 amege8,dll;itrea^a her. Poor MelbaAn%red it aa long aa she donia, hating che TUBS" and scandal of legal proceedings; Bat seven or eight weeks ago things came to a crisis,- and Mrs; Armstrong instructed Malleson & Mal« !eson< her solicitors, to file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty; Armstrong has retaliated with » petition for .divorce, making the Dake of Orleans oo-re. .pondent. .This is /aklly, MilBJa'frianda say,lá pietíe^of the merestXrAf' ' Jin ot* the truth about the Duke. In pdre selfish thoughtlessness ho eompromised her aborflin* ably in public. ' There, howevor, the matter ended. Armstrong knows- nobody better-= that he has not the ghost of a chadee of proving adultery. Melba is a passionless woman, wrapt up in her art. All ber life, all ^ her energy, all her all are' in it; Tho young duke's adoring a i miration tiokleä her vanity at first. He followed her about every where, listening to her lovely voice with hungry ears, and snapping np greadily any kindly word she threw at bim; Mest prima donnas are troubled with a follower or followors of this description! If the young man had not sheen the Pake of .Orleans no one would have noticed bim.; i At; Vienna madam reoeivedthe duke ether-lietel occasionally, and let him escort her once to the opera when she was not playing. This evening's entertainment was a serious indiscretion from an Austrian point of view, and led to scandal. Tho Imperial family formed the worst conclusions on seeing the pair together in pnblie, and it is alleged that when they oame to the front of the duke's box, the ladies of the court withdrew. When Melba learnt the significance plaoed on thia" |ncident she was s greatly, annoyed, and upon -the duke folldwiajg \hfer ito St. Peteraberg she got the Cear to intervene and order him off. The young man seemed bent, however, on playing the fool, and presently actually ventured to Paris to see and heat the prima donna. The absurdest stories Were current at thia time. Oas paper deëlared the ddks was in Melba's house disguised as butler ; another that sho had oonoealod him in thsr boudoir, r J When, however, the police ««aaÍly'Íid¿payLmMlame a domiciliary visit they found not nu indication of his reyal highness having been there. The sole eus» pioious fact was that Melba declined to say whether she had or had not seen her friend in Paris. Armstrong has had two detectives and a solicitor rammaging in Vienna for the last fortnight, but without mach malt. The allegation] ia the petition ia that Melba committed adultery with tho dake of Orleans In Sadhest'e Hotel* Vienna, en February 20, the latter figuring aa H< de Villiers. The proprietor, according to Arm« strong, admits Melba oame there, but blandly dobies) j ébè ; *fae ) aooempanied by the ôr'leantst prince:^ The Dnke of Orleans Was warned tea days or" mofe ago that an Attempt waa about to bo made td serve him with a citation as do-ie* epottdent in the divorce edit, ¿ad his í Sr vant« have been eu the alert for suspicious strangers. At St. Johann, in Moravia, where the prince was staying with Baron Hirsch, several stratagems were tried fruit« lessly. On Wednesday morning, however, aa he arrived at Vienna, his Boyal Highness got neatly caught. Two gentleman in evening dress asked leave to present a bouquet and a petition as the duke stepped from the rall* way carriage. He .handed tho Howers te . a aeoretary, and opened the petition, which was neatly tied with ribbon. No sooner, however, did "Victoria, by the M <3t^''' reach his eye, than he realised what had happened, and flinging ^emanerjtfrora him, cursed the rapldly-retreatiag: fora'oi the probess-server with fluency. It subsequently transpired JurMtrong£l^^ fate now, to a great extent, depends on the reality of her reyad-friend'a friendship. If he 8ubnHw^mself^eiÄii! ordeal of the -wifaKss box, all will be well. If, however, his royal ; highness Mi *0^:^^^ *°° Proua *° &° 80 the jory will armóse certainly charitably assume the .worst. , * A gossip Wninds^ïthat it was in ecmse qUenoe of a breach of etiquette at a State ; concert that ;thednke0 was obliged ti leave St. Petersburg. After Melba sang the prince was BO enraptured that he led the applause instead of-'waitmg:Éor \he Czar to do so. His Majesty ordered him out of the room forthwith, ' :bnt he . ignored the Imperial message' tilt ene ortfae^grand duoheases came and implored him not. to make a scandal. Next day. he was! requested to leave B-nssia. In the Italian Opera Company at present in London are many-artists who know Melba and sympathisai with "her in her present trouble. None of them' for a moment be- lieve her to have been guilty of anything wor«e than indiscretion in her friendship for Prince Lioia. An abiurd efcory appeared in last eve ling'u pipers to tho effect that the trial would take place in Melbourne. Need« less to say, as p -ooesdiugs have been com- menced in the English Courts the case will be triod iii tho English Courts. On dit in Vienna that the Dnke of Orleans ii intensely chagrined at having ba^l BnooB»fuUw-Bèïfrerl wtth" oitation. Hiaacheme was ilji^ajf^oe'lpaffinitely, and thus render Armstrong's malice abortive. Now the prince is on the horns of a deliemma, and either horn means scandal.
