I knew the spot by what Jate, the groom, had told me, close against the pollard oak, and there were the footprints of the men who had carried away the body, and rthe grass 'all . trampled and beaten where the corpse had been dragged put of. the, ditch. I don't know what made me grope about and «x amine the place, for there wasn't much to see—idle curiosity I suppose; but the more I hung about the spot — the muddy ditch-, and the broken hedge above itj and the bank,? with the footprints of ahorse shar pened off by a light morning £rost, — the_ more- I had Sir Everard and his white _ face,; and his. hunter all over muck and miie, in my mind. I couldn't give over puzzlmg;myself why yhe should £ave.; been, out so late on that particular; night,'; and. why hevshould have come home in- such a state, him as was one of the neatest pf riders, and ueed to bring his horse home as fresh as paint. I stood loitering about like/ smoking my morning pipe, and looking, at the place, when all at ;pnce I spied seme thing glittering in the thick brambly hedge just belcw the ragged gap that showed whereaherse had been pver it. What could it be ? Some of the plunder which the murderer had pitched there inhis haste to be off . A pencil-case pr a silver whistle, I thought ; nothing much, or the fellpw would have npbbled ify I sprang across the ditch, and scrambled up the bank, and parted the brambles, and there I found a spur stuck fast, with one of the straps and buckles hanging to it just as it had been torn off, as the horse went over the hedge. Itwas^ tough black-thorn branchthat had done it, I knew the spur f or Sir Everard's by the make of it, and I should have known it for his anywhere, even if I had not no- . ticed the missing, spur as he walked across - the yard overnight. I put it into my pocket and jumped back into the road just as the police: constable and his pal came up to search the place ; but I didn't say a word to either of them as. to what Pd found. * Pretty clear where you was last night, Sir Everard, and what you was doing/ says I to myself ; you gentlefolks gives way'to your evil passions just as often, as the ppprest. of us, though all the catechism books teaches us different.' - : /'Did you tell any one what ^ou Had'* found ?/? asked Jane Barnard.
