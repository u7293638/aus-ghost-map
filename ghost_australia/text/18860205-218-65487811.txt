AVENEL. ————♦———— (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The Longwood juniors visited us on Saurday last, and had a very enjoyable game with our school boys. The Avenel captain winning the toss, sent his men in, and they succeeded in putting together 38 runs. Hexter proving very destructive with the ball, taking 6 wickets. Long- wood then went to the wickets, but could only respond with 23. Robins making top score with 8. The team then, at the invitation of Avenel, retired for some light refreshments, after which Avenel went in for their second innings, and at this attempt scored 44, T. Planck heading the score with the respectable total of 25 runs, going in first and carrying his bat right through till the last wicket, when he was caught by Hexter. Longwood having 56 runs to get to win went in, and seemed at one stage of the inning to be in a fair way to get the required number. Robins, by hard hitting, putting together 14 in a very short time, when a fast low one from Tonkin, who bowled well all through, proyed too much for him, and Hexter, who was backing him up well, shortly after, playing too far back, went out hit wicket. The rest succumbed to the bowling, 6 wickets being down for 24 when time was called. Avenel thus winn- ing on the first innings by 15 runs. After each side giving three hearty cheers for their opponents, the Longwood boys left for home, accompanied to the railway station by most of the Avenelites. Prof. Carl paid us a visit on Saturday evening, and gave a very good entertain- ment, illustrating the Ghost story from Pickwick ; " Grub the Sexton " with some very realistic weird-like magic-lan- tern views, following with a number of scenes if noted places in Europe and America, closing with some capital com??calities. Mr Hill kindly acted as lecturer for Prof. Carl, who is unfortu- nately deaf and dumb. Owing to the very short notice there was a very sparse attendance but we can recommend it as a very pleasing entertainmemt for young or old.
