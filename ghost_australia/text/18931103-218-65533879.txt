kGHOST?OF THE PAST Sir Roleit Lsbern and his wife were not particularly silly, as newly married .couples go. For one thing, Sir Robert was thirty-something; and when you' are thirty something -;gravity comes. But he was very much in love with his young iife: ?''He hindlediher'oit of the Ã½: family om?hiibus chrefully, arid the very \- prettiest ankle cands the -tiniest shoe peeped out for a -ininent as she' stepped down before one of. the big hotels on Trafalgar square. As she trippe?-updthe broad, carpeted stairs to 'her room, therel was. a look, of great.happiness.in.her,eyes.,,, ,. "Andis,my dear girl'qnite happyl'" said Sir Robert..... Young Lady Lisburn (shie was tall and .pleasant'. looking) ',turied", to. him affectionately. ,' Your dear girl," she said; "has had her worries'in'her life.:" She had one big worry. ' " How big ? " Lady Lisburii widened' her "arms' to give an idea;of the size. '' : "But it's all over now, aundI am very. happy, Robert.", .. "Perhaps;" 'said- he;. "' perhaps; the dear girl will tell me all abouit'it some day." " She -may-some day," s:eaid. the young bride; flushing.' ". Just now she is so contented' that -she doesn't want even to think about'it.' The next morning, they went. off.to the Engadine. It was two: months later when 'they' returned, trunks and portmanteasneplastered :all over, with ,sqdare and circular. labels --Hotel rBelle-, vue, and Hotel Beau Rivage, and a lot ot others. :Both Sir Robert and Lady Lisburn looked .very jolly aid well. .... Theie'were letters waiting for Lady 'Lisburn : She read.' them in her bed room. As she saw the writing, on one of the envelopes, she grew .red and then very white. She perused the letter again ;and again, with hands trembling and a face that looked into the mirror with a frightened look. Then she turned off the electric light and sank on her knees and sobbed. They stayed in town for some days; They drove out a good, deal, visiting; but' young Lady Lisburn looked ill and out. of sorts,. and- scarcely spoke to her husband. ' ' He seemed to be repelled by her. coldness. Once or twice she tried to rouse herself ; but the look of worry. quicklyr.came back, and her husband, placid and even as he was, could not help feeling disturbed. One evening, in the latter part of the week, Lady Lisburn was sitting at the 'open' window of their room, her face resting' on her hand, looking outu into .the square and seeing.nothing..., 'A. page- entered with a foreign mes sage.. She' opened 'it," read the 'type written words, and crumpled quickly 'the sheet.in her hand as Sir. Robert came i . i . I want-to 'say' something to -you, Robert," she said in.a shaky voice.i .. He came over'to.her.. ,. "I, want., to: go- away 'from' you-for a few weeks." ' A few weeks ? "he repeated blankly. ., few, weeks.

I shall be nothing but a curse to 'you and a misery,to myself for all my life:. 'Do let men go." . M ,My dearn love,"' said S?ir Robert, rising with a very decided air, " if you absolutely refuse to. tell. me the motive Ifor your disappearance, I absolutely re fus' to ,let. you go." ; SThen I- then I must go' without' your permission'." 'She said thii without defiance, and in' thieihumblest way.. v ; . Sir Robert went downstairs and stood at the hotel 'door for a: few minutes, smodking his cigar rather.quickly: Theni he ,turned 'and. went;to the telephone room and looked in the book- and rang up. { , Lady" Lisburn, White and' set. of :face, returned to her room and prepared f:or her,journey.,',: It was a surprise to Sir Robert to find in thehall, not, ten minutes later; the man for whom he had telephoned. He was a burly, scarlet-faced .man, and he gave his card to Sir:Robert with an awkwardi fat bow'- "'.Tioac.s BESTER,' Fayre;, Sweever and Company Inquiry Agents." - " Come intor this room, Mr--Mr Beaster.,': ; Mr Bester wipedhis bodots.with .par ticular care. . .
