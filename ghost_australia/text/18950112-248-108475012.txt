THAT GHOST. Every night this week the residents of Bank-street west, have been annoyed by the number of persons who have congregated in the vicinity of the Riding School owing to a rumour having spread that a ghoat was to he seen. Between 200 and 300 people, we have been informed, collect and walk up and down, and it was stated in the court yesterday that three con stables have been told off to clear the roadway and footpath. On Thursday a young man named Alfred Needham, was arrested by Constable Garrett on a charge of unlawfully assembling on the footpath. When the accused was brought before the court yesterday morning the arresting constable stated that be re peatedly requested Needham to move on. Defendant would move a little way and as soon as witness' back was tnrned he would stand with about 20 other young fellows. Finally he locked lum up. The crowd was a great nuisance to the people in the neighborhood. Constable Western, gave evidence as to the obstruction to traffic caused by the great crowd of persons nightly visiting the place to see an imaginary ghost. Defendant stated that he was on his way home from the beach, as he heard there was a ghost, he stopped for a few minutes. Each time he was cautioned by the constable he moved on. The bench said that the practice of congregating on the footpath carried on by young men, both on the parade and other parts of the city was as source of great annoyance to respectable pedestrians and must be put down, as a step in that direction defendant would be fined 10s, or 3 days imprison ment.
