There are very many doctors in China, and ibeir profession is on sinecure,'for if a patient has medicines from a medical man he not only wants a quantity, but expects it to change his condition immediately, and it is nothing uncommon to have three or four different doctors in the course of 24 hours. The medical men, knowing this, try and give them retl-hot compound that can be felt at once. The superstition that pervades every class is one of the many things that tend materially to keep China from advancing rapidly. Every shop has its joss, and the proprietor seeks its advice before deciding any momentous question. And he abides by its decision. The strange unwillingness of the Chinese to afford help to a drowning man, or anyone in absolute peril of his life, or otherwise, is based upon the belief that the ghost of the last man killed always acts as watchman " of the hades, or purgatory," into which, according to Chinese belief, the spirit of the departed first enters, and from which he can only be relieved by the arrival of a fresh ghost. If, therefore, a man's life be saved from accidental death, the spirit of the person who died immediately before him is in a manner cheated out of his relief, and will assuredly haunt the person whose misplaced humanity has condemned it to a fresh term of servitude.
