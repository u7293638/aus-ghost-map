POETRY, GRANDMOTHER'S MUSINGS. Eight tails apace. Shades gather round us. Dim mysteries. Present, future, past. Each brings its ghost of sorrows, or of hopes. Glory, and grief, and gladness, gliding fast. What once we were. What once we meant to be. Dear Past! locked up in childhood and in prime, When heart-beats thrilled with buoyant life, Free step and brow, alike untouched by time. Dead Pasts ! where lie so much of brave endeavour, Of trustful hope, and patience strong to bear, Of love rewarded, and that same love hung'ring For some faint token, that not vain its care. Dead Pasts! made up of presents and of futures. Laden with crowns of roses and of thorn. Twining of garlands, mixed with sable raiment, Preans [sung in triumph, heart-breakings to be borne. Eight falls apaceâ€”and still the shadows trooping, Flit o'er the picture canvas Memory weaves, And on this present, with its sterner bearing, Still prints a lesson from its folded leaves. Sunshine and shadow, God's eternal law. Must in life's mystery be mixed and blent; Till future lives to nobler knowledge soar. We with our pasts and presents work content. We work and wait, with what we may of courage, Hoping that those who follow in our rear, Reaping the fields we sow, may garner harvests Rich with the fruits born of a knowledge dear. Marabel, August 29,1881. ELLIE L....
