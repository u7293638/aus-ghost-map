TEAPOTS AND CREAM JUGS. STRANGE to say, the teapot is a modern invention. The ancients never saw the tea-plant, nor tasted that delicious beverage which " cheers but not inebriates." Among the remains of ancient Egypt you will find plenty of earthen jars once filled from the sacred File the mighty empire of Aztek has still its cine- rary Burns to show ; the earthenware of Celtic peoples is constantly coming to light and Etruria, the long vanished home and kingdom of the arts, preserves to this day her vases of every shape and unrivalled beauty ; but none of these extinct nations possessed that precious teapot which every hovel in England can boast. The case is not the same with the cream jug. The museum of Gregory XVI. contains numerous vessels which the Etruscans probably used for milk. Virgil tells us of the parts in which the Russian peasants carried their goats' milk to market at day- break and every reader of the Georges remembers what pains they took to render the milk savoury how they feed the ewes on clover, lotus, and salt herbs, that so they might drink more water from the brooks and yield more copious and tasty milk, having a pleasant smack of salt. As to asses' milk, the Roman belles used to bathe in it, as certain Parisians are said to do in champagne and we may be quite sure that those who knew the value of milk so well had no lack of elegant and costly jugs in which to serve it. The delight of tea-drinking had been felt by the Chinese long before it became common to the rest of mankind. It was not till the 17th century that Pekoe and Souchong visited Europe, and nowhere did they had a more hearty welcome than at English firesides. The Russians, indeed, get tea in greater perfection than ourselves. With them it retains the flavour of which a sea-voyage deprives it and being conveyed overland through the large fairs of Ladak and Night Novgorod, it tastes of the leaves of the area fragrans, in which the Chinese pack it for a journey northward. But there is no country where its use is so general as among us, What Belgian and Italian domes call tea is nothing but its ghost. We for the most part make it good, and drink it often. Plenty of tea-the water quite boiling pour it off quickly- that is the true receipt. It must wind up our breakfast, even if coffee takes the precedence ยก it must follow the late dinner, and be served in every gentlewoman's boudoir at five o'clock. To the Englishman it scarcely comes amiss at any hour. It is the student's stimulant, the in- valids medicine and to the lone woman in her old age it is more than her spinning wheel ever was, or hear cat and canary ever can be. It affords " the nice young gentleman for a small tea-party " an admirable opportunity of displaying his affectation, and cracking his feeble jokes. It is the most social of all beverages, and the already immense euuD'ar..p;iui- heat here is decidedly on the increase" But though the Chinese send us their tea, we are not indebted to them for our teapots. Indeed they have none properly so-called. They have each a tea- cup furnished with a lid, in which the tea is made separately The leaf, chopped up very small and almost in powder, is put into the cup in the quantity required Then hot water is poured upon it, and the lad replaced When it has stood a little time then stir it up, and drink it quite hot and turbid, without sugar or cream It is a very different thing from our ten having a delicious flavour peculiar to the climate there can he no doubt that the extensive use of the leaf in this country has given a great impulse to the ceramic art During long ages its beauty and perfection lay buried in Etruscan tombs The Italians first raised it from the dust in the 11th century, and Luca della Robbia, using glaze and colouring with his term bottles, produced the famous Majolica The delicate art then moving northward, forsook the Tuscan factories, and fixed its home in the little town of Valence in France Here and at Nevers, patronised by Catherine de Medici, and improved by Bernard Puliwy, it attained high reputation, and its productions are well known to collectors of old "china" by the Serpents, fish, and other creatures, which cover their surface in relief the manufacture of porcelain in China and Japan had been common from the first century of the Christian era, but it was not till 1918 that the Portuguese imported it into Europe Tactoncs followed each other in rapid succession in France and England, but the articles produced cracked easily, and would not bear strong heat The first real porcelain was made at Meissen, on the Elbe, in 1710, and under the name of Dresden china became known all over the world Its patron, Augustus II , Elector of Saxony, was commonly called the Porcelain King The true Dresden teapots and cream jugs have particular marks by which they may be tested, and so have those manufactured at the Hague, Vienna, and Majenco Some- times the mark is n shield, at others a wheel, now an eagle with the hind foot raised, and now a stork standing on one leg or living with a frog in his beale The Berlin porcelain ranks next after Dresden but that of Sevres surpasses them both Louis XV , HI 1756, there founded the great factory which has since become so eminent and about the same time the Worcester Porcelain Works started as a company, and Josiah Wedgewood, like another Prometheus, brought the fire of genius into the Staffordshire potteries, and gave new life to their club The beautiful green lanes, the banks and nooks where wild flowers blossom, were the school in which he first learned his art The berries in the hedgerows, the clinging ivy, the trailing tendrils of the convolvulus, the straw berry s luscious scarlet, and Nature s own exquisite commingling of colours, formed his earliest lessons, his silent out daily teachers Forced by pain and disease to abandon the work of the thrower, he turned, while still a youth, to the moulders board, and there produced the specimen known as Wedgewood s first teapot," which is carefully preserved at " Etruria " This little work was the beginning of a career of ceaseless activity life crippled boy rapidly became an eminent artist, a profound chemist in relation to his art, i philosophical thinker, and a great industrial lender With self culture, and on a system self devised, he moved onward from one success to an other He converted " again we are into imitation of porphyry, sold knife halts and snuff-boxes of his own design in this ware in his eighteenth year, and showed extraordinary accuracy and taste in the early Etrurian cream vare, which was afterwards to attain in his hands such lightness and perfect linear harmony The tea service of our day differs widely from that of our ancestors Whether made of chinaware or earthenware, it is more shapely and beautiful fine old blue Eastern designs, in which truth was outraged and taste disregarded, have passed away, or linger only on cottage shelves Even before Wedgewood began business, though coffee and tea pots were usually coloured black, several improvements in crockery had taken place, especially as regarded table plates Many of them were v tried by scalloped or embossed runs, and coloured so as to resemble tortoise shell or the vein ings of the ripe melon The cauliflower and melon w area were the result of ochre and metallic oxides, applied to the biscuit with a sponge, and the tortoise shell ware was produced by a like use of manganese ore Small dishes to hold pickles were modelled from natural leaves, and coloured with oxide of copper in various shades of green The tea equipages continued to be very small, as may be observed in some of Hogarth's pictures and engravings All who have preserved their grandmother s tea things are puzzled to know how that excellent old lady could have been satisfied with such a thimbleful of tea She must have sipped it as though it had been a liqueur, and as to her old china, it is curious enough no doubt, but quite unsuited to present use Tol- mer! j, too, tea equipages made a great show in the lady's boudoir, and consisted of a greater variety of pieces of porcelain than is now thought requisite Besides the usual cups and saucers, plates and bowl, there was the china teapot with its pretty stand, the coffee pot, the tea canister, the cream jug, and the spoon tray The last was a pint little article, wantonly for he tiniest of spoons, such as might have served Titania and her court when sipping drew out of the acorn cups It would be evidently presumptuous in us to discuss the relative merits of silver and earthenware teapots It is our happy part to drink the tea fair hands set before us, not to make it We have heard, however from those who are believed to be knowing in the matter, that when an earthenware teapot is sure ciently strong to stand on a hob near the fire, it draws out all the virtue of the tea-leaf, and fairly beats its silver rival There are certain persons who have a conscientious preference for ugly things They rejoice in square toed shoes, coal scuttle bonnets, and whatsoever is most unlike the lavish beauty of nature With such we shall always be at issue in matters of taste Luxur may be excessn e in China as in dress, but frightful furniture and slovenly attire can benefit and please no one It is surely an innocent and elegant enjoyment to adorn the tea-table with what charms the eye and suggests agreeable associations the translucent w late body of the porcelain, with its transparent glaze, the exquisite modelling, the enamelled flowers, the fine colouring, the landscape, the pictured tale-, the Corj don and his pipe, the Hebe offering her cup to Love - make nectar and ambrosia of the viands, and kindle a smile on the face of the tea-table that welcomes us like a living friend We are insensibly put into a good humour by this hospitable display of ceramic art What beauty reduced from clay from mere mud formed by the wearing down of rock surfaces in the silent depths of the sea during countless ages of submergence ' It enlivens comer sation, and helps to form in his habits of taste and refinement Even a cream ware teapot and cream jug, or a fireplace tile with reliefs in coloured chip, may awaken in the mind the love of the Beautiful, and if the Beautiful and the Good are not alway s united, we can only say that they ought to be so, for they belong to each other as the blossoms and the fruit-London Review, November 11 THE PRECISE Si or WHERE mr MAIITVHS writE BurNED AT SMITHUFLD-Chester, in his "Life of John Rogers, ' vicar of St Sepulchre, who was the first martyr to the Christian faith in Smithfield, writing on the spot in Smithfield where he suffered, says, " the precise spot where the fatal stake was usually planted in Smithfield has been sufficiently identified For a long time, a square piece of pavement, composed of stones of a dark co our, a few paces in front of the entrance gate of the church of St Bartholomew (the Great), traditionally marked the locally In the year 1849, during the progress of certain excavations, this pavement was removed, and beneath it, at the distance of about three feet, were found a number of rough stones and a quantity of ashes, in the midst of which were discovered a few charred and partially destroyed bones This spot accords exactly with the one designated in old engravings of those times, and there can scarcely be a doubt of its identity " Two of these are to be found in the work, one representing the burning of Anne Askew and two others, in 1516 (published in 1863, and the other shewing the spot where the relics where discovered City 1 ress IvtrnoMPTtis -Burns, going into church one Sunday and finding it difficult to procure a seat, was kindly invited by a young lady into her pew The sermon being upon the terrors of the law, and the preacher being particularly severe in his denuncia- tion of sinners, the lady, who was very attentive, became much agitated Burns, on perceiving it, wrote with his pencil, on a blank leaf of her bible, the following " Fair maid you need not take time-limit for the tests pursue 'Twas only sinners that he meant, Not angels such as you " After Burke had finished his extraordinary speech against Warren Hastings, the latter (according to his private secretary, Mr Evans), wrote the following sarcastic impromptu " Oft have we wondered that on Irish ground No poisonous reptile ever yet was found The secret stands revealed in Nature s work She saved her venom to create a Burke " Dr. Johnson's definition of a note of admiration (2), made on the moment, is very neat " I sec-I sec-I know not what I see a dash above e a dot, P presenting to my contemplation A perfect point of admiration I"
