PICTURES OF TRAVEL. HOLYROOD PALACE. THE ABBEY CUUnOU. Upwards of 750 years ago, as ancient legends tell us, when King David I of Scot- land was accustomed to administer justice at the gate of Edinburgh Castle, after the primitive custom of the times, and Co give the homblcstof his subjects audience, he chanced to ride forth hunting, upon Rood day, into the thick forest of Drumsheugh, which then covered the whole of the valley lying between Salisbury Crags and what is now the Calton hill Losing his way in its dim recesses he was suddenly brought to bay by an enormous white stag, which made a rush at him, and overthrew both horse and rider Inode quately armed, he was like to be gored to death by his antlered enemy, when a silver cloud suddenly shone before him, and a hand, reaching from it, placed within his grasp a jewelled cross of marvellous beauty 'she stag fled at the apparition, and the King returned home marvelling much at the super natural vision which saved his life. On the same night the patron saint of Scotland ap- peared to him in his dreams, and commanded him to found a monastery upon the precise spot at which he had received the cross, the injunction was faithfully fulfilled, and the jewelled gift enshrined in silver, was set up in the rood loft of the Abbe) Church Iht. charter which be granted to All in, the first abbot, constituting the institution and suitable endowing it written on vellum, about the year 1945, is still extant, and forms one of the most precious documents in the archives of Edinburgh 'the cross itself, which is said to have been composed of a material unknown to human beings, re mained in the Abbey Church until after the battle of Durham, in 1340, whither it was taken by David II and falling into the hands of the English, was deposited in the cathedral of that city of the abbey itself, nothing now remains but the four walls of a portion of its beautiful church, erected in one of the best periods of gothic architecture. The western doorway, with its deeply recessed and richly- sculptured voussures and the elegant arcade in the tympanum, is not unworthy to take rank with those of Rheims, Tours, Poitiers, and Chartres ; the tracery of the great east window, which was blown in about 90 years ago, has been carefully restored by replacing the original material, and is now partly mantled by ivy and the rootless nave, carpeted with turf where it is not slabbed with tombs, is almost as picturesque as that of fountains, lïïevant, or Bolton, while it is from its historical associations even more interesting. For, standing upon the site of the altar at which Mary, Queen of Scots, knelt to give her hand in marriage to Lord Henry Darnley, a crowd of figures pass in proces- sion before the mind's eye, and a series of brilliant pageants Hit across its vision. When the revolt of Alexander, Lord of the Isles, against James. of Scotland was crushed at the battle of Lochaber, and the angry monarch refused to listen to any appeals for mercy from his rebellious subject, Alexander suddenly appeared in the midst of a great religious festival at which the king was present, and kneeling before the high altar surrendered his sword to his sovereign, be- seeching the exercise of his clemency. The queen interceded on his behalf, and the Lord of the Isles, after undergoing a term of imprisonment in Tantallon Castle, was re- instated in his honours and possessions. Here, after the murder of James I the crown was placed upon the head of his youthful son and successor and here also was celebrated the marriage of the latter with Mary of Oncldres, in the presence of a magnificent retinue of French, Burgundian, and Savoyard nobles, and with the accompaniment of jousts and entertainments over which the Jpvelujess and winsome manners of the royal bride qualified her to preside as the queen of beauty ten years later the king who had been killed by the accidental bursting of a cannon, was buried in this sanctuary " with the year of his people and his haul army ' throat vault occupies a position on the south side of the choir, near the east window In 1480, James III, being then scarcely 18 years of age, was married in this church to Margaret, of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, who was under lb, and brought with her as her down ry the islands of Orkney and Shetland Here, too, the Popes legate solemnly deposed Patrick Graham, archbishop of St Andrews, who soon afterwards died of a broken heart, and bestowed the pallium on a royal favourite named'William Lehner In 15-2, the doctrines and disciples of Martin Luther were formally condemned from this spot, and about 12 years later the temporal buildings of the Abbey of holyrood were burned to the ground by the invading english and, although they were afterwards rebuilt, they were once more devastated by the Southern enemy after the battle of Pinkie in 1317 His lead was stripped from the roof of the church the bells were stolen, and the monks were turned adrift After the imprisonment of Queen Mary), the iconoclastic fury of the Earl of Glencairn found vent in the destruction of the sculptures fittings, and ornaments of this beautiful structure, but it must have been after vi ards remove used for Charles the First was crowned here, with much splendour, in 1633 but an enemy mg of the interior in 10 87 shows the clustering shafts of the central aisle to have been disfigured and hidden by the 12 stalls of the Knights of the J whistle and the King s throne, at the east end, executed in accordance with a classic design When James the Second of England lied to St Germains, the palace of Holy rood, ns Macaulay tells us, "ninth had been turned into a Roman Catholic seminary and printing house, was stormed and sacked Huge heaps of Popish books beads, crucifixes, and pictures were burned in the High street 'the abbey) church suffered most severely by this outburst of popular fanaticism the whole interior, vented another historian, was instantly gutted and destroyed, and the magnificent tin one, stalls, and organ were ruthlessly torn down, conveyed to the cross, and there consigned to the flames amid the frantic shrieks and yells of their Bands Not content with all this, in a spirit of mad sacrilege, the mob, now grown lawless burst into the royal vault, tore some of the leaden coffins asunder, and carried off the lids In this vault had been deposited the remains of David the Second, of Prince Arthur, the third son of James the Fourth ; James the fifth, his first Queen and his second son, Arthur, Duke of Albany, and Henry, Lord Darnley In later times it has received the ashes of the Duchesse de Grammont, and of Mary of Gueldrca, Queen of James the Second of Scotland. These were recently removed father. THE PALACE Is of a much more recent date than the church, and the first mention of it in Scottish history was in the reign of James I., who celebrated his marriage with Margaret Tudor inside its newly-erected walls by mosques and tournaments and pageant, on a scale of great magnificence, for, as the great necromancer of the North has told us, -the merry dance, traced fast and light The makers quaint, the pageant bright, The revel loud and long." And never was it more blithe and jocund, never had the King appeared so joyous an aspect, or worn the iron belt " That around the breast In penance pain In memory of his father said" with a lighter heart or nobler man than on the night before he quitted Edinburgh for the fatal field of Flodden. His successor, James the Fifth, was crowned in Holyrood Palace, and from hence he was accustomed to sally forth in his bachelor days, disguised as one of his poorest subjects, in search of those adventures of which he has left us some record in his own ballad of "The Guberlunzic Man," while in another the King would have lost his life but for the timely in- terposition of Jock Howieson, upon whom he conferred the broad lands of Braemar in re- compense for his services. Father this monarch brought his beautiful young wife, Magdalene, daughter of Francis who died of consumption in less than two months after her marriage, and in the year following He) road opened its gates to Mary of Guise, the second wife of James V The King died of a broken heart, occasioned by the rout of Sol way, just after the birth of his daughter Mary in Linlithgow Castle "Ah, said the unfortunate monarch, " by a girl the cross r of Scotland come into the house of Stuart, b) a girl it will pass out of it it was a fatal heritage.

Mary's dressing-table stood where it is, and on it is her workbox, and some fragments of embroidery wrought by what all her contemporaries pronounced to be the most beautiful hand in the world, "tongue at trial at delicate," writes Hansard, who also says : " 15 votes main des plus belles la belle N'a rich baron sa blanched naturelle. Et ves longa doigts, cinq rameaux Margaux. Scott tells us that the slaughter of Iliraio was " a catastrophe which had chilled with horror all even in that rude age, and which had been the theme of wonder and pity through every cottage and castle in Scotland." Nor would it be easy outside of Ireland-to picture any assassination more cruel, dastardly, and cold-blooded David Rizzio was a foreigner, a Roman Catholic, the favourite friend and faithful counsellor of the Queen, who probably found in his society and his conversation the sympathy and solace which it was hopeless to look for from her coarse, scrupulous, and brutal husband, by whom the elegant and accomplished Italian was detested and despised. Darnley determined to destroy him; but the conspiracy which he entered into with a number of nobles, with John Knox, Patrick Bellenden, and other malcontents, aimed also at the de- thronement and imprisonment of the Queen, the maintenance of the Protestant religion, and the bestowal of the crown upon Mary's worthless husband. On Saturday evening, the 9th of March, IOHO, Morton, Ruthven, and Lindsay, with a following of 200 men at arms, repaired to Holyrood, where Darnley awaited the coming of the principal conspirators. At 8 o'clock they stealthily mounted the staircase spoken of above, followed by Ruthven, George Douglas, Andrew Kerr, and Patrick Bellenden. Darnley was the first to enter the little supper-room, where the Queen was seated at her evening meal with her natural brother, Lord Robert Stuart, Lady Argyle, the laird of CrcicU. Arthur I Erskine and Ilirzio Leaning over Mary, her husband kissed her to disarm suspicion, and the moment afterwards Ruthven Douglas Kerr and Bellenden thrust aside the tap str) covering the doorway,

quit her presence on pain of being arraigned for high treason, in vain the remained object of their animosity clung to the flowing robes of the Queen, entreating her in French and Italian to protect him from the weapons of the assassins He was stabbed over her shoulder by George Douglas with Darnlc) s own dagger, and then the chief conspirator, half drunk with wine and wholly) made dened by rage, dragged his wretched victim, all gashed and bleeding as he was, through the queens bedroom to the door of the presence chamber, where he was literally hacked to death, his body bearing the marks of 56 wounds , while Darnley) s dagger was left buried in it to the hilt, in order that all men might know that the Queens husband had been the chief actor in this ferocious tragedy 'Hit corpse was then stripped of its clothing, and flung out of the window into the court yard below, where it was exposed to the vilest indignities at the hands of the brutal soldier) Ruthven returned to the supper room, his dress bespattered with blood, and his face as white as ashes With truculent insolence he called upon the Queen to hand him some wine Mar), almost beside herself with grief, wounded dignity, and

have seen Delarochos grand picture of the death of Queen 1 Elizabeth, and who will recall to mind the loneliness and miser) of that great, little, vain, irritable, selfish old woman, in her last hours, will feel that she, too, was called upon to expiate her share in the guilt of this dastardly!) crime, and to learn the bitter lesson that "even handed justice doth commend the ingredients of the poisoned chalice to our own lips How terribly the pro natal influences connected with this tragedy operated on the mind and character of James VI and I , no one familiar with the Jlthtoi// of England, 01 with 2/c For tunes of Nigel, will require to be reminded His morbid sensitiveness amounted to abject cowardice, he had a perfect horror of firearms, and the sight of a naked sword would convulse him with irrepressible terror You are brought more completely face to face with this blade episode in the annals of Scotland, in Que n Mar) s apartments at Holyrood, than you are with the assassinations of the Due de Guise in the Chateau de Blois, because no renovating hand has passed over the furniture and fittings of the former, and the ineffaceable stain of blood which John Evelyn
