I A Good Ghost Story: Dr. Russell tells, in the JNinctccth Centuri/, an excellent s;host story which occurred lo a friend of his. He begins, as is the fashion of mosl peop'e who" have such stories to tell, by asserting, that he dors not believe in ghosts. Nevertheless, he tells the story on the authority of a friend, who is slill- alivo, and it is gruesome enough to satisfy the most exacting. Three hundred years asp-Helen Stuart' the dnughter.of Lord Auchintyre, was killed in the castle of the Earl of ytrathfullar. by the countess, who chopped offthe girl's hand at t lie wrist as she grasped the handle of the door of her ro.un, a tapes' tried chamber, which ever since has been haunted. Dr. Russeil's friend was put to sleep in this room, and awakened three or four times during the nieht by a small iee-cokl hand . being drnwn across liis face. It awakened him instantly, and nothing could have been more definite, he declares, than the feel of the four fingers and thumb, which- were passed lightly over his face from right to left. Me was quite certain that someone was playing a prac tical joke upon him,' and after the third time that lie was awakened lie left the room, aiid ultimately took refuge in a boat-house. Every occupant of that tapestried room in the turret has hee'n subject to strange experiences, arid so far as- Dr. Riisselj knows, the hand may continue to stroke the faces of sleeping guests until this day.
