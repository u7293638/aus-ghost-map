GOLD REGULATIONS. To the Editor of the Empire. SIR-With rcspcot to your profession of liberal principles, &o.;, alluded to in tho Schooling letter from " Cumdobara," directed to and published by yon tliis^ dav, for my part I should be quito grieved if tho Empire ever condescended to givo way to any un-English teaching, so ns to ' connive at the curtailment of our rights in any I British dependency ; and I trust that any anti British movement here may ever bo met in a way thoroughly British, notwithstanding any supposed frightful ghosts or horrors tho imagination of this Cumdebarian may strive to fright mankind with. I hope this may start some abler pens. March 22, 18S3. CITIZEN.
