. &WLn;$zmzni8. THEATEE E0YAL. The heat on Saturday night made indoor amusement almost intolerable and militated considerably against a large attendance at the Theatre Royal, where the Bentley Dramatic Company appeared in Shakespeare's immortal tragedy ' Hamlet,' It was in the character of the melancholy Dane that Mr. Walter Bentley first made his appearance in Adelaide in March last, and the excellence of the im personation will therefore be too-fresh in the minds of local playgoers to require any lengthened notice. It is avowedly Mr. Bentley's aim to present a HamlÂ«p easily nnderstanded of the people and one of whose eanity there can be no ques tion. Physically Mr. Bentley is emi nently qualified to Rive a picturesque embodi ment of the Danish prince, and taken as a whole his Hamlet is one which, while appeal ing to the many, never descends to the com monplace, but is the result of a thoughtful and careful study of one of the most human characters ever Been on the stage. Mr. Lachlan MfiGowan has doubtless been associated with the character of Polonius for many years, and this sterling actor as a result of that expe rience gives an even and humorous reality to the impersonation which is highly pleasing. ? Miss Lilla Wilde is eoarcely an ideal Ophelia, but ehe succeeded in arousing the sympathies of the audience and was seen at her best in the mad scene. Mr. Harry Douglas gave due prominence to the role of Claudius, King of Denmark, but MisB Gladys Leigh was scarcely equal to the occasion as his royal con sort. Laertes in the hands of Mr. Albert Lucas waB a fairly successful presentation of the character, and the Horatio of Mr. E. Cris, a young Adelaidean, was a commendable per formance. Mr. A. Brereton was sentea tiously humorous as the gravedigger, and Mr. B. Marschel unconsciously funny as the ghost of Hamlet's father, the other, characters calling for no special mention.
