" Travaillez, prenez de la peace '" TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-Will i you kindly allow me a small space in your esteemed paper on the subject of musical societies The subject, which has recently been brought under public notice, and has also found its way into your co umns in the form of letters is deserving of more attention than has hitherto been be towed upon it. It is indeed a matter of surprise and regret that, in a city numbering 160,000 inhabitants, that att which appeals directly to the soul should be so neg ected We may, therefore, congratulate ourselves that whereas, hitherto, only one musical society existed, efforts are being made to add to the number and thereby to create a wheat one competition, from which much benefit may be derived There is plenty olr._om.fur more than one society of the kind in Sydney, and I trust sincerely that the petty jealousies of which via hear will be set aside and not up in the bud a valuable blossom I cannot help reminding ' Handel's Ghost of the 1 ranch sa ying, Apns diner monta) de He has allowed others to exert themselves to establish musical societies, and saw that the stone is rolling, he seems completely to ignore them, and gives us the benefit of his advice without How- ever taking the duties of reformer upon himself It is in easy matter to give good counsel, but if a result is to be obtained, a vigorous action is the most necessary factor Now, I presume that "Handel's Ghost is musical and possesses a good voice and perhaps a fair unoivledge of the violin He would, therefore do well if he really has the establishment of a good musical society so much at heart to become a permanent and zealous member of one of the already existing one and by taking an active part to contribute to the utmost of his power to the perfection of the society Rome was not built in a day neither was it built by letter-writing, but Romulus put the hand to the plough himself and marked out the boundaries of the future mighty city " Handel's Ghost" is not aware of the difficulties to be overcome, or he could not have suggested his mode of con- stituting a society The number of efficient orchestra players is limited in Sidney and it would be next to im po able to make them meet regularly once a week for the purpose of practising it is therefore nece san to make use of the existing material, and to hope that with some practice it will, by degrees, improve With regard to vocal - . lists, the difficulties are lessened but it is not practical to exact from intending members that they should pass an examination or in what would this examination consist I will ask " Handel a Ghost if, in his vast experience La he met with in any who could sing correctly pi una use and does he mean to exclude all those who fail to qualify themselves by so doing-' If so, he will deprive every society of excellent and valuable Forces, and will reach them to a few good musicians with, perhaps, very low voice I lie partly law material at present at the disposal it the conductor will with p peace and good humour behind and r deemed fit for public appearance, but to obtain the v strict discipline is indispensible Members in use make it their especial duty not to absent themselves from preside at e sat i unavoidable and further, they must for a time being consider themselves secrets in hands of an instructor, and ob eve strict compliance with his engine c t OJs I have no doubt, Sir, that if "Handel's Ghi? t ' will forbear his criticism at present, and with a "oed will put his shoulder to the wheel and set a good example, ive skill succeed n e tablishing a n musical society which may be a credit to this city I remain, Sir, your obedient servant S.
