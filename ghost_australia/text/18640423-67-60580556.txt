Tua Prorogation Speech of yesterday deserve s larger audience ; and if the public bad bee: aware ortho rich treat prepared for them, th legislative Oounoil Chamhnr would hots boo: crowded,' instead of presenting, as it did, th most meagre attendance > that had ever bee: observed on a simUas occasion. AU «ho wen capable of enjoying a joke at their own expens were almost choking with suppressed laughte: during the reading of that remarkable doeu ment ; and it was .well, foi the preservation o decorum that his Excellency had been so per factly eohooled in public life aa td be able tc maintain his gravity until he had escaped fron the public gaze, and regained the comparativi seclusion of his carriage, when he must ha vt thrown himself back upon the cushions anc indulged in a fit of irrepressible merriment Even the PREMIER, trained in the courts of law, and accustomed to put a grave face upon the most ludicrous matters, .was hardly equal to the present trial, and, in spite of the air of injured innocence which' he endeavoured to maintain, seemed momentarily on the point of bursting into a loud guffaw which would have been more expressive of the geniality of bis temperament than complimentary to his 'statesmanship and politeness.' Keen observers even, asserted thal they traced the ghost*of a grim smile flickering lipon the Bgonised visage of the OOLONIAI SECBETABT. The SECRETARY FOB WORKS, looking. straight before him, had compressed his features into a condition, of stolid severity which must have been the result of many hours' private practice before a looking glass, and seemed to set all funny provocations at defiance. The TBEASORER was, as usda", smilingly self satisfied. Bejoioed : beyond measure, at hts approaching escapé from the parliamentary penalties of an empty budget, his expressive face denoted inward gratitude for his unex- pected and unmerited luck. But all outside the centre of the circle, mirth reigned supreme, and the ladies appeared to bo divided between a sensation of pleased surprise and something like oomio indignation at the , absurdities. which they had been invited to listen to, and which had been heralded with so muon pomp and ceremony. Their sensations1 were probably mash the same as if, thby had expected to witness the performance of the sublime play of HAMLET, and had been treated instead to the most extravagant, travestie - the Prince of DENMARK, for instance, singing Old DAN TTJOKEK," or balancing a donkey on the top of a ladder. The whole scone was worthy the pendil of (be hest caricaturist in the world. In fact it was, ip itself, a caricature' of the most. grotesque, character, «nd will not soon be forgotten by those who witnessed it. With all its faults, the Speech opened with a paragraph which was a graceful concession to the conscientious scruples of. the Governor, and Kuat have cheered bis Excellency on thé task that W&8 yet before him; " It affords me much gratification to bo able nt' last to release you from your legislative dutieB." No sane man could doubt that fact ; and we only wish that the dis- tinguished spokesman had been permitted to add another sentence, in which case tho paragraph might have been beautifully.> ¡and truthfully rounded thus:-"And I devoutly trust that it "will never be my misfortune to meet you hero again." But, however grateful such candour BS this would have been to hÍB Excellency's feel- ings, he waB not Allowed its expression, but ^ompelled-tor^ddres^ before lum in tho'language bf admiring symp thy and intense compassion. " You must lot forward with a feeling of roliof to tho cessation labours so severe and continuous as tb OB o v\hii you have undergone." Perhaps, after all, t! Governor perceived and enjoyed the sarcast interpretations of which this sentence was su captible. If a troop of brawling mountobanl had bellowed themselves into hoarseness ar silence with utterly profitless roaring, or a bei of donkies had been stunning the cars of ti neighbourhood with their braying until th( eonld bray no more, they might bo amusing congratulated upon tho "feeling of relief" whic they must experience at "the cessation < laboura so severe and continuous"-an withal so uselesc Or if-which may have bet the case for all we know to the contrary-sorr member of the Vice-Regal staff had been ii structed to convey an intelligent wink to tl bystanders, they would have understood tl Governor, to mean that the " feeling of relie: was all on their side and his own. "Althoug those labours have not resulted in the passing < many new laws," we are' told-and this con mencement must have forcibly reminded hi Excellency of the hacknied quotation, pdrtarfai montes, and so forth-yet "thoy have ia. all pr< bability paved tho way for the more easy soli tion of questions of importance which sti remain unsettled." How do they make th out ? We could very well understand how tl " labours" in question had " paved the way" t the " solution" referred to if they had" pave the way" to a dissolution ol Parliament. In tht case it would be readily allowed that the wind "labours" of the overworked unfortunate addrésaed had " paved the way" to the true "soli tion,'' by convincing the electors that they mue return a better set of men next time. As it ii we must only suppose that his Excellency eharitably giving honorable members som credit for good intentions, meant kindly to ii timate that these-had "paved the way" of nameless place to which, politically speaking they must finally be consigned. This " soli tion" will be generally acceptable,. when : arrives. " That those questions have not bee disposed of," says the speech, " is to be attribute in some degree, perhaps, to the'recent changée Ministers." This is candid, at all events, ant we may add, magnanimous. We dare aver thi the present COLONIAL SEORETARY had no han in such a confession, although the honorabl gentleman and bis financial colleague are prc minent amongst " the difficulties by which sue changes are not unfrequently attended." The: follows a choice bit of sly humour :-" In th midst of those difficulties, the zeal and industr which you have displayed cannot fail to be af predated by the country." In the nam and on behalf of the country, we ' hèartil assent to that.. The " zeal and industry" whio! resulted only in the imposition of a distinctiv tax upon local newspapers and in the voting awa of eight hundred thousand pounds more than th anticipated revenue, is most thoroughly; appre ciated by the country, as will be satisfactory shown whenever au opportunity -offers. " thank you," the Governor is made to say, " fo the provision which.yon have made for th various exigencies of the public service." Wh; the fact is that they had made no provision d the kind. " Thank you fornothing," would hav been more appropriate. Members. of Farlie ment have voted that certain sums of money amounting to more than two millions,' may bi paid away, but they have not voted or provide« any method for raising it, and that, we appre hend, is a Blight omission. But the Speech i full of omissions. The seventh paragrapl says :- " Large reductions have already beet made in the public expenditure,"- ant also, it should have been added, ii the public revenue; and then th remainder of the paragraph would havi been intelligible; namely, that' " daring tht recess it is hoped that steps may be taken bj which further reductions may be carried oat.' Whether such a consequence is " hoped" or no: we oannot say ; but most assuredly it ia vcrj generally (eared. " Honorable gentlemen o the legislative Council and gentlemen of thc Legislative Assembly," says the Speech, rising into lofty grandeur, " the maintenance of the public credit ia one of the first duties o every Government." The Ministerial MICAWBERS might have been expected to have followed ur. this dignified self-reproof with a quotation fron the aphorisms of their great prototype. If i you: income is one hundred pounds a year, you maj safely spend ninety-nine pounds ?hillings and eleven pence three farthings; Thai is the secret of the maintenance of crédit. Bul has this prudent bourse been, taken': by. the Ministers or the Parliament ? Nothing of the kind. Like MICAWBER, they content themselves with a grandiloquent sentiment while 'their whole'career is. opposed to its practice. Mr. MICAWBEB was all his life indulging, in .great expectations, but fate was against their .fulfil- ment. 1 This is precisely the csBe of the Ministry. They expected to pass certain "measures" to increase their. " income ;" but Parliament was against them, and their ".measures" collapsed; yet they go on with the expenditure just the same, and, to use the imaginary revenue of MIOAWBEB, they sanction a hue dred and eighty pounds of outlay with only a hundred pounds of income. And now'we are treated to such consolation as may be derived from what has been called the balance of remote and unrealised,contingencies. There is "every confidence ' that another session will not be permitted to elapse without the necessary enact- ments being passed for the purpose of placing our financial affairs in a sound and satisfactory condition." Very definite and satisfactory this 1 The amiable confidence of MICAWBER again asserts itself; and Ministers are waiting for something to turn up 1 The best thing that can be said of this Spaech is that it faithfully reflects the programme with which the " session ; was inaugurated. ' Ten months, ago the "Governor had to open Par« liament with an Address which promised nothing, but told us that we had had a great deal of dry weather, and now his Excellency hos como in state to inform us that Parliament has done' nothing:, accordingly, though it has f'i laboured", tremendously, but that we have had a great deal'of rain. If Vice Regal speeches continue to' be 'concocted on this principle, tho .collector pf curiosities .mayhave them bound up together,--for : reference; ns registers of the weather. Meteorological phenomena will, per- haps, be recorded'in them, and we may learn from their perusal the course of the last comot, and the date and duration of the most recent eclipse. Bat more useful information may jot bo gained, even from speeches like this, coming after such a session BB has just closod. Although we"have all tho'stalest news about the weather, thore ia no. hint of the political storm that is gathering ; yet ' those who trace effects from ,causos cannot fail to discern|the> lowering tem- pest, and "to foresee that it must burst with trfesîstîblè"Wry~ùpôïi^ho~së"" who mSKe~auöiri pompous mockery of an ill- governod country andi a bankrupt treasury. " 1 ','. il ASSERTIONS) marked by a reokloBs dhregard of¡ facta, were made in tho Assembly on Wednesday' night, to the effect that the figures lately pub-,' liahed in the Empire as to the falling off in the Land Revenue, the probable amount of the General Revenue for tbe present year, and the actnal sums voted by tbe Assembly, Mere false. We challenge Mr. WILSON, who had the hardi- hood to say that " bo would tako upon himself to state that the whole article was utterly lalee," to point out a Bingle error either in tba figures or tho deductions drawn from them. So iar as, regards the land sales the figures were taken from the quarterly official "returns published in the Government Qaeette.^ . They 'givo the .precise amount realised from land sales, and the total land revenue, as follows :-wo.T ? J' "?'; ? V' ,t,:' Total Lend Iiind 3>les. . Bevenae. jg ; e. . d, ' e. d.

Although still nominally MINISTER FOB LANDS, and in receipt of fifteen hundred a year, as the wages of prostitution, it is painfully evident that he has lost all regard for character, and . has become a mere tool, a puppet, in the hands of his former political opponents. We know of no instance in the history of Responsible Govern- ment so degrading and disgraceful as this man's apostacy. Assisted for years from the hard earn- ings of his fellow diggers, and enabled by that means to lire in luxury in Sydney, he was no sooner offered a Ministerial appointment under a man whose political creed waa at direct variance with his own, than he grasped at it in the'most selfish and'greedy manner. He deliberately sold his constituents, and to keep his pUice> voted for taxing, almost everything they made use of.., He infamously turned his back on his professed principles^ and with a total sacrifice of political, .character, appears to have lost all regard . for truth. In his desperate attempts to justify bis conduct he has made assertions which he mast know to be false. Ho. may. rest assured, that his career will' end with the present Parliament. No constituency in the colony walliston to such a renegade, and the sooner his official and political lifers terminated, - the better for the country and the institutions, which he has dis- graced. ; . Let it be remembered that the Mr. WKSOK who rqakeB this unfounded charge - of falsehood against the Empire is the Mr. WIXSON who, pre- vious to his accession to office, was the most determined opppnent of capital, punishment, bot that immediately after taking office he joined in sending to the gallows a man who had not oom* mitted murder, Let it be remembered that this whilom enthusiastic advocate of land law re- form, voted in favour of handing over' the free selectors to the tender mercies, of the squatters by denying their right to impound. Let it be remembered that he Bigrialiaed himself' as the determined opponent of State-aid, and brought in bill after bill to declare the : Church and School estates waste lands of the Crown, but that as soon as he was in receipt of £1500 a yeár of public money he sanctioned the referring of the matter to the arbitrament of the Supreme Court-a tribunal which he was perfectly cer- tain would decide against the view he bad always advocated. Let it be remembered that as a private member he was always a fierce free trader, but that after taking offije he was the zealous advocate of a protective policy. Let it be remembered that as a private member he advocated the interests of the gold diggers, who had for years supported him, bot that after taking office he voted for taxing almost everything they ate, drank, and used. Let it be remembered that in bis patriotic zeal be moved for a committee of inquiry into the atrocities of lunatic asylums ; but that on becoming a highly paid official he did all he could to burk the inquiry, and allowed the unfortunate keepers who had given evidence to be sacrificed for telling the truth. We might go on' multiplying instances of thia man's recreant conduct, but it ia needless to.do so. The mark pf public scorn has been set upon him, abd at the first oppor- tunity he will experience the miserable fate of a BLACK, and be cast aside, to have his place filled, it ia to bo hoped, by an honester politician and a more sterling man. With regard; to the sums voted by the Assembly for the current year, wo appeal to the Appropriation Act itself "for proof of the correctness of the figures quoted in the Empire. To prevent any possible mistake in this matter, we publish I below1 the: wholo amount, as given in detail in the Aol itself. And as to the amount oí revenue to be anticipated for the current year, we took the sum realised in the first quarter as the surest guide. That sum (£»74j870 12s. ld.) multiplied ? by four, gives £1,090,483 8J. 4d, as the probable year's re- venue from all sources.' ' If to this is added the sum of JB461.1S7, authorised to be raised by loan, wo shall find that the total amount which the Government can calculate on to meet an expenditure of £8,178,094 3s. 7jd. is £1,550,609 8s. 4d., leaving a deficiency of X027.48115a. 3jd. This is bad enough, in all consoience, bat it is not tho- worst. There ÍB sure to be a supplementary estimate for 1804, and, taking this at . a very moderate sum, the deficiency for the year cannot fall ehort of ONE MILLION POUNDS. . - :r- ' The details of the sums voted, and included in the Appropriation Act, are as folloW:- ' SCHEDULES, : ? . .i : 1, Supplement to Belledale B (Pensions) ; £2063 1 .7 2\.
