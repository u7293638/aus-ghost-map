TRANSLATED. A lady writes from Germany that she is difloouraged about learning the German lan- guage. A German friend who tried to oonverae with her in English made such a mistake that she fears she may do as badly in German. The German gentleman innocently gave this rendering of a familiar saying : ' The ghost is willing, but the meat is feeble.'
