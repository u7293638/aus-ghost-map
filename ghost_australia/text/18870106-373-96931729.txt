Original lap«. ; YEARS AFTER. : Bv Ibis. CHAPTER I. The P. and O. steamer Assam was anchored off Glenelg. on Sunday evening in January, 18—. The steam launch had plied busily all the afternoon between the jetty and the mail boat, and was once' more panting and hissing through tbe broadening glas*y ripple' of the golden crinkling water, splendour-flooded from the sunset. . Colonel Scott leaned over the ship's side. gaging on the distant hills, aad scarcely noticed the passengers -on th6 approaching launoh. : He turned away to avoid the smoke from the funnel, and the newTcomers ascended the ladder and stood about- on the deck, looking a little helpless and bewildered, until the stewards came to their rescue and shewed them to their allotted cabins. The tewnd bell iTCDg?for dinner before Colonel Scott could mkta; up his mind to leave the beautiful prospect from .the deck and go downstairs. A white mist was sinking down upon tbe -summit of Mount Lofty, circling ^ lower and lower till the 'semicircle of brown hiOT'' became indis 'unguubable from the clouds. The shadowy plains strechingtjr ten mllejtbelween coast and' hills, were still aqffused/-riGb,th*e sun aet -glory, and-lhe longi^d rayrshone on the windows of houses.-' in Gl^aelgi .and made them glow and sparkle like 'gigantic rubies and .topases. -.-. ???? ; '?„ , v _ . ??/?_ -.?.??-. The shimmerng water lapped: ajjalnst the black pirated eides of the eteimer, snow-bright foam crested the^rey riiges of the little- wavVs ; which laV ? beyona - the evening glow ; the murmur of- the in flow ing tide as it beat upon the , broad, distant yellow shore, reached the 'listener's' ears. Colonel Scott Toused . himself from his reverie, land de'^cendectSthe 0ompani6n stairs. Wfaen he entered the saloon, he found that everjone else h'aij-beguri '^fnoer: He took his seat at the tablev 'Ion 'the ieaptainV left hand, and began to eat'nU soup' in silence, and without casting,^, glance at the :newly arrived 'paafoigws,'1 who were seated oppos'-te tolitni. The lady on the other side of him made some remark about the beauty of Adelaide scenery, and asked binf' whether he had been on shore. =~- Be was about to reply in the affirmative,. tsble'datbv Wfeen.Jlf r^^^d^i^atioleht sbook.

' No. indeed ! What should I go on. shore for? Never saw such a, hole aa this Glenelg in my life.' Caii'V think what people live in these colonies for, I'm sure. What do you say Colonel Scott?1 ? ,- Robert glanced involuntarily; across the table, to see whether the 'mention of his name would cause thedadk,. drooping head to be raised, and the 'eyes, whuh . he thirsted to look into, to. meet his own. ; He made some.vague reply to the ^cap tiin, as he watched his opposite neighbour, who still gave no sign. He forgot all the past years and their drawn-out-sorrow, and was once more suffering the old fierce pangs which he had felt when he was parted f.om the' girl ^hbWh#Wfff wished, to marry. .__.f ,.£.,_ gj^ v -*'rt Poor Helen Cragthorpe was also very young, *a mere 'schobl-gifl^ but not wUhn out a will of her own, ^Wtfh at seventeen, unequal to the tat-k ofjpeady resistance to her nioth'f rV imTnovab^7ldetermination to prevent her from m«ri'ying the young lieutenant; ' on wht»m-s?e had placed her girlish - affvetions. ??- Yoamg Scott- had not^ given her up without Soaking a' desperate figh*. He' had induced a. mutual friend to try to make teimV with the old beldame, but it was useless... Mrs. Cragthorpe would be satisfied with nothing 1- sa th--n a com llete and formal renunciation, on his part, of all claims to Helen's band, and finding that his will was likely to prove a match for hen, she resorted to 'stratagem. .
