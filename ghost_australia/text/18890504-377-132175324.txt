A Snow-white Crow. For some time past there has been observed, in the vicinity of Bowenfels (remarks the Albury Banner), a snow white crow, flying about in company with its companions. As might be ex pected, this conspicuous bird has been eagerly pursued by many a covetous eye, even by its own species, which seemed at a loss to comprehend the meaning of this ghost-like intruder being amongst them. No doubt its presence alarmed many of them, as they boldly attacked and wantonly tried to drive the unoffending bird away. The bird itself seemed to understand that it was always in personal danger, as it has ever been very wary, shy, and cautious when attempts have been made to shoot it. Its existence was, however, terminated last week, when Mr. Carter, jun., of Bowenfels, was fortunate in bringing the bird down at a very long range. He afterwards lost no time in placing it in the hands of an accomplished taxidermist and natu ralist, Mr Robert Grant, of Tank-street, Bowenfels, who has by now got this rare bird stuffed and mounted in a very artistic and life- like manner. Mr. Grant described the bird as a pure albino female of the common Australian crow.
