TALES. E D I N A. By Mrs. HENRY WOOD, Author of ' East Lynnb.' ?[The right of publication in Australia has been purchased by the proprietors of the Sydney Mail.} Chapter XXI. — A Tigeb. The late spring flowers were blooming ; the air was soft and balmy. Easter was that year nearly as late as it could be ; in fact, April was drawing to its close ; and when Easter conies bo late as that it gene rally brings with it glowing sunshine. Eagles' Nest, amid other favoured spots, seemed to be as bright as the day was l®ng. Once more Major Raynor had all his children about him ; also Frank ana uaisy. j?or anytning tnat coma be seen on tne surface, merry hearts reigned universally; none of them seemed to have a care in the world. Frank decidedly had not. Sanguine and light hearted, he was content as ever to let the future take care of itself. Yielding to persuasive hospitality, he «till stayed on at Eagles' Nest. His wife expected to be laid up in the course of a month or two ; and where, asked the Major, could she be better attended -to than at Eagles' Nest ? Daisy of course wished to «tay: she should feel safe, she said, in the care of Mrs. Raynor. Twenty times at least had Frank run up to town to see if he could pick up any news, or hear of any place to suit him. Delusive dreams often pre sented themselves to his mentaTvision, of some doctor, rich in years and philanthropy, who might be willing to take him in for nothing to share his firat- class prac tice. As yet the benevolent old gentleman had not Tjeen discovered, but Frank quite believed he must ?exist somewhere. Another thing had not been discovered : the missing money. But Major Raynor, sanguine as ever was his nephew, did not lose faith in its existence. It would come to light some time he felt certain, and so he never ceased to assure Frank. Embarrassments de cidedly increased upon the Major, chiefly arising from 'the lack of ready cash : for the greater portion of that was sure to be forestalled before it came in. Still, a man who enjoys more than two thousand per annum ? cannot be so badly off ; so that on the whole Major Raynor led an easy, indolent, and self-satisfactory life'. Had they decreased their home expenses, it would have been all the better : and they might have ?done that very materially, and yet not touched on home comforts. But neither Major nor Mrs. Raynor knew how to set about retrenchment; and so the -senseless profusion went on, « What is there to see, Charley ?' The questioner was Frank. In crossing the ; grounds, some little distance from home, he came upon Charles Raynor. Charles wasstooping to screw his neck over the comer of a style by which the high hedge was dividedthat bordered the large, enclosed, threecor nered tract of grass land known as the common. On one side of this common were those miserable dwell ings, the pigsties : in a line with them ran the row of new skeletons summarily stopped in erection. Op posite stood some pretty detached cottage-houses, -'inhabited by a somewhat better class of people ; while 1 this high hedge — now budding into summer bloom, and flanked with a sloping bank, rich in moss, and flowering weeds, and wild blossoms — bordered the third side. In one corner, between the hedge and the bettermost houses, flourished a small thick grove of trees. It all belonged to Major Raynor. ' Nothing particular,' said Charley, in answer to the question. ' I was only looking at a fellow.' Frank sent his eyes ranging over the green space before him. Three or four paths ran along it in dif ferent directions. A portion of it was railed off by wooden fencing, and on this some cattle grazed ; but on most of it the grass was growing, intended for the mower in a month or two's time. Frank could not see a soul, and said so. Some children, indeed, were playing in front of the huts ; but Charles had evi dently not alluded to them ; his gaze had been directed to the opposite side, near the grove. ' He has disappeared among those trees,' said Charles. ' Who was it ?' pursued Frank ; for there was something in his young cousin's tone and manner suggestive of anxiety, and it awoke his own curi osity. Charles turned round and put his back against the stile. He had plucked a small green twig from I the hedge, and was twirling it about between his lips. ' Frank, I am in a mess. Keep a look-out yonder, and if you see a stranger tell me. ' Over-run the constable at Oxford this term, as before r ' questioned Frank, leaping to the truth by instinct. Charles nodded. ' And I assure you, Frank,' he added, attempting excuse for himself^ 'that I no more intended to get into debt this last term than I intended to hang myself. When I went down after Christmas, I had formed the best resolution in the , world. I told, the mothjr she might trust me. No body could have wished to keep straighter than I wished,' and somehow ? ' ' You didn't,' put in Frank at the pause. ' I have managed to fall into a fast set, and that's the truth,' confessed Charles. ' And I think the very deuce is in the money. It runs away without your knowing how.' ' Well, the tradespeople must wait,' said Frank cheerfully ; for he was just as genial over this trouble as he would have been over pleasure. ' They have to wait pretty stiffly for others.' ' The worst of it is, I have accepted a bill or two,' returned Charley, ruefully. ' And — I had a writ served upon me the last day of term.' ' Whew !' whistled Frank. ' A writ ?' ' One. And I expect another. Those horrid bills — there are two of them — were drawn at only a month's date. Of course, the time ran out ; and the fellow would't renew ; and— and I expect there'll be the dickpnB to pay. The amount is not much : each fifty pounds ; but I have not got the ghost of a shilling to meet it with.' ' What do you owe besides ' As if I knew ! There's the tailor, and the boot maker, and the livery stableman, and the wine man — Oh, I can't recollect.' Had Frank possessed the money, in pocket or prospective, he would have handed out help to Charles there and then. But he did not possess it. He was at a nonplus. ' When once a writ's served, they can take you, can't they ?' asked Charles, stopping to pluck a pretty pink blossom from the bank, the twig being bitten away to nothing. ' I think so,' replied Frank, who had, himself contrived to steer clear of these unpleasant shoals, and knew no more of their power, or non-power, than Charles did. ' Well, then, I am going to be arrested,' continued Charles, dropping his voice, and turning round to face the common again, ' It's rather a blue look-out. I should not so much mind it for myself, I think : better men than I have had to go through the same ; but for the fuss there'll be at home.' ' The idea of calling yourself a man, Charley ! Yo^ife but a boy yet.' 'liy the way, talking of that, Jones of Corpus told me a writ could not be legally served upon me as I was not of age. Jones said he was sure of it. What do you think, Frank?' '* I don't know. But I should suppose that the very fact of the writ's having been served upon you is & proof that it can be done, and that Jones of Corpus is wrong. William Stane could tell you : he must have all points of the law at his finders' ends.' ' But I don't care to ask William Stane.. May be they take it for granted that I am of age. Any way, I got served with the writ. And unless I am mis taken,' added Charles gloomily, ' a fellow has fol lowed me here, and is dodging my heels to arrest me.' 'What are your grounds for thinking it, Charley? Have you seen any suspicious person about ?' 'Yes, I have. Before you came up just now, i 1 — ' ! The wordB were broken off suddenly. Charles i leaped aside from the stile to hide himself behind the J hedge. Some individual was emerging from the grove I of trees ; and he, it was evident, had caused the movement. ' If he turns his Bteps this way, tell me, Frank, and I'll make a dash homewards through the oakcop pice,' came the hurried whisper. 'All right. No. He is making off across the common.' ' That may be only a ruse to throw me off my guard,' cried Charley from the hedge. 'Watch. He will come over here full pelt in a minute. He looks just like a tiger, with that great m nm of brown beard. He is a tiger.' ( Frank, leaning his arms on the stile, scanned the movements of the ' Tiger.' The Tiger was at some distance, and he could not see him clearly. . A thin tiger, of middle height and apparently approaching middle' age, dressed in a suit of gray, with a slouching hat on his brows, and a fine brown beard. But the tiger, whomsoever he might be, appeared to entertain no hostile inten tions for the present moment, and was strolling leisurely in the direction of the huts. Presently Frank spoke. 'He is well away now, Charley — too far to dis tinguish you, even should he turn round. There's ho danger.' Charley came out from the hedge, and took up Jus former position at the extreme comer of the stile, where he was partially hidden. Every vestige of colour had forsaken his face. He was bat young yet ' — not much more than a boy, as Frank said — and un- , familiar with these things. ' I saw him yesterday for the first time,' said he to Frank. ' While wondering in a lazy kind of a way who he was and what he wanted here, a great rush of ' fear came over me. I thought he must be a 6herifF(t officer. Why the idea should have flashed on me in. that sudden way — and the fear— I cannot tell ; but it did. I made the best of my way indoors, and did not stir out again. This morning I said to myself what a simpleton I had been — that I had no grounds for fearing the man, except that he was a stranger ; and I came out full of bravery. The first person t saw upon proceeding to cross this stile was he; just in the same spot, by the trees, where I saw him yes terday; and the rush of fear came over me again. It's of no good your laughing, Frank ; I can't help it ; I never was a coward before.' ' I was not laughing. Did he see you ?' 'No. Neither time, I think. I'm sure he is look ing after me. If I were well up in funds, I'd . be olf somewhere and stay away.' ' You could not stay away for ever.' 'There's the worst of it. 'But then, you see, that money may turn up, and put all things straight.' ' Well, you may be mistaken in the man, Charley ; and I hope you are. Let us go in.' William Stane was at home for these Easter holi days, and still, as heretofore, the shadow of Alice Raynor. It chanced that this same afternoon they encountered the 'Tiger' — as, from that day, Charles and Frank both called him in private. Strolling along side by side under the brilliant afternoon sun, in that silence which is most (eloquent in love, with the birds . singing melodiously above them, and the very murmur of tke waving trees speaking a sweet language to their hearts, they came upon him, this stranger in gray. sitting on the stump of a tree. The trees, mostly beeches, were thick about there, the path branched off sharply at a right angle, and they did not see him until they were close up. In fact, William Stane had to make a step or two of detour to pass without touch ing him. Perhaps it was his unexpected appearance in that spot, or mat it was not usual to see strangers, or else his peculiar look, with the slouching hat and the bushy beard ; but certain it was that he especi ally attracted their attention; somewhat of their curiosity. ' What a strange-looking man !' exclaimed Alice, under her breath, when they had gone some distance. ' Did you not think so, William? ' Queerish. _ Does he live here? I wonder if he is aware that he is trespassing ?' ' Papa lets any one come on the grounds that likes ? ? , to,' replied Alice. 'It's a stranger, I never saw him. before.' ' Oh, it must be one of the Easter excursionists. Escaped from smoky London to enjoy a day or two of the pure air of the Kentish Wolds.' As you have done,' said she. 'As I have done. I only wish, Alice, I could enjoy ? it oftener.' The words and the tender tone alike bore a pre cious meaning to her ear. TPs eyes.met hers, and: lingered there. 'I am getting on excellently well,' he continued. ' By the end of this year, I moke no doubt I shall bouse. Perhaps % ' Look -at the ^riyof JwwtlMm f A firUlffied Alice, darting to a hedge they were now passing, for. she knew top ^well what the words implied.

' 'What did he say r' 41 I'll tell ye what he. said, Miss Baynor, if ye like. He said dootors and doctors' stuff was o' no good, so bang as the houses retrained what they was — pes-ti- fe-rus. That was the | word, pes-ti-fe-rus. I should not have remembered it, though, but for Jetty's lodger repeating of the very sfelf-same word to me a minute or two agone. I've jtist passed him. He's sitting down yonder, under the beeches.' Alice, as well as William Stane, instantly recalled the man in gray they had seen sitting there. ' Jetty's lodger !' repeated Alice. ' What lodger r' ' Some stranger what's a-staying in the place, Miss Haynor. He come into it one morning, a week agone, and took Jetty's rooms. They was to let.' ' What is lie staying, here for r' 'To pry into folks* business, I think,' replied the 'woman. ' He's always about, here, there, and every where ; one can't stir out many yards but one meets him. Saturday last, he walks right into our place without as much as knocking ; and there he turns his self round and about, looking at the rotten floor and dripping walls, and - snifting at the bad smell that's always there,' just as if he had as much right inside as a king. ' Who is your landlord?' Bays he, ' and does he know ?what a den this is r' * So I told him that our landlord., was Major Raynor at:Eagles' Nest, and that he did ? know, but that nothing was done for us. He have gone, I hear, into some b' the other houses as well.' : The woman's tone Was quite civil, but there could be 110 doubt that, in her independence, she was jj talking at Alice as the daughter of Major Raynor. 1 'As I passed him (now he asked me whether my sick children was better — just as you have, Miss Haynor. I told him tihey was worse. ' And worse they will be, and never jbetter, and all the rest of you too,' says he, ' as long as you inhabit them pestife rus dens!' ' Alice drew her head up in cold disdain, vouchsafing 110 further word, and feeling very angry at the implied : xeproach. The woman : dropped a slight curtsey, and ?went on her way. , ' How insolent they, all are !' exclaimed Alice to Mr. Stane. ' That Sarah Croft would have been v abusive in another moment/' ? ' Their cottages are bad,' returned the young man, after a pause. ' Could nothing be done, I wonder, to ? snake them a little better r ' ' It is papa's business, not mine,' remarked Alice ' in semi-resentment.
