,. FOUL:. Li` ' AWAT1iHtaus I n The following yarn is told in the 'Daily a Telegraph' to. 'A Seafarer' by "hisfriend, t the Second Mate' :-' The chief mate was a cheerful little Welshman-God rest his t soul-ons of the most intelligent seamen I Swas eover assaeociated with, with as tender a e heart as ever heat under a velvet waistcoat, i, and eyes so bright that I'd sometimes think d that the rdune.s that tinged th.m was nothing but the scorching of the skin by the t lvhio, of his g:ss. We were very good e friendesboth of a rather poetical torn of mind, 0 no v.ery great rarity amongstseamen, though n the conformedly strained manlinoess of the Csailor makes him feel sheepish even to be Ssuspected of a romantic humour now and f again. The skipper hovered about till 10, a then went below. I joined the mate, and a we fell to quietly pacing the deck, talking of t, anything but the weather and the heat, and s. the calm, being sick of the things. No, sir, Y our conversation went to covsideration of e the sort of times we were to expect at d Calcutta, and I was in the midst Sof telling him that I was thinking tseriously of looking 'onut for a mate's berth aboard a country wallab, where the month's s wage sounded tall in the shape of rupees, w wben he Interrupted me by coming all m a d sudden to a dead stand, whilst he cried in a >t tragio voice tbah was scarce more than a ri hoarse whisper, pointing with a little arm as he spoke: ' My God, what is that ?' His >r forefinger indicated a apmce of dusk that lay r like an ink-stain upon the night that was 9 dark as the sea-line everywhere else was; ir and "n the heart of this peculina murky n blotch I observed what looked to me to be ,a two fine lines of flame close together, forking at out of the Eae, and lengthening upwards as id one watched with a kind of throbbing pallor id whence they proceeded, thoogh this last was at very elusive, and noticeable only when the 0 eight went a little to the right or left of it L Hush I' said I, after straining my hearing Sa moment, whilst the mate stood watching i tockatill, as though spellbound. 'Do you rbear it?' The noise I meant, which, though re faint,was naudible enough amid the pauses ly of the flapping canvas on high. Thick of a 7' kettle boiling in a room next to the one you d a'e seated In, and that will be the character s, of the noise I heard. As I spoke there was Sa flash of lightning right betwixt the two fine lines of fire, and the wild glare threw I1I out the ponderones folds of a great aloud ' hanging, like masses of smoke arrested and d preened down, above these strange and ever d growingluminous stalke. 'A waterspout-two 8 of them, it looks like,' oried the mate. 'Ha.w d does it travel ? Why, by all that's precious, ,y if Its growth slgnifies its course, it's heading t direct for the barque.' Hi vehement ex s clamatlons startled the men who had stowed I themselves away about the decks for a nap e and you saw flitting of dusky figures to e the rail, and caught. a note of alarm in the Shalf-amothered growl of voices which came along Saving, always, the swing of the d swell, t>e barque lay as deadon the sea as a Slightship, not an inch of way on her; '-o a that there was nothing possibehle to be t done in the way of mancauvring. ' But I watersponte don't shine,' cried I, to the mate. 'Yes, yes,' he answered, 'yonder 0, does, anyhow. It is the phosphorous in the water. I have seen such thiogs again and again, glowirg as though they had got a streak of lightning stowed away in their coil.' Ho continued to look; then, with an ,ath, he cried out pas.iouately that the appearance was heading for us, and, with a -bound. gained thi companion, down which he i bolted, retureine after a few breathlest Smoments followed by the captain, who rose it olut of the hatch like a ghost. habited in his tshire and drawers only. Believe me or nos as you will, but what I'm going >to tell yen is as tnrue as that I, who wask by Syour aid, now, am a Ilving man.

I gained the deck. The night was brtsithlees.

But we found the body of the mate, oruelly buiud and barely distinguishable as a human fcrm, lying under a mass of gear. Well, to end the yarn, for t's nearly told, we passed three days of desporate pumping, for the voteel touk in water as though her bottom had been a grating, and 'twas pump or sink, for we were without a boat. But on the meoreing of he fourth day a steamer hove in sight, spied I us, and came alongside. She won jubt in itime; we were more spectres, with the s etrength of euch things, and I believe if the next relief of the pumps had been called there would have been no answer."
