It was the odour of wine, and very strong They must have broken a bottle carrying it up, I thought. Perhaps, after all, the old lady DI not so strict a teetotaller when alone. And I laughed at the idea, little dreaming from whence the smell came. I could find no one in any of the sitting rooms, and, as I heard persons moving in the basement, proceeded there. My aunt, hearing my steps on the stairs, ran to the kitchen door roses who it was, I noticed she appeared vexed as she met me. i J "Tam particularly engaged in this afternoon, John, and can't speak to you now,' she said. III ' " As she spoke, I noticed the smell of the wine was almost overpowering, and I wondered what she was doing. j. " She had some old gown on, and that covered with a rough, white apron, apparently soaked with some coloured fluid. She was dusty, dirty, untidy, and heated, and ii noticed blood flowing from h cut on her hand. What extraordinary house hold exploit could she be engaged in it" When a lady tells you decidedly she I Can't stop to talk to you, and when she appears up to her eyes in cleaning the house or something of that sort, the next thing to do is to make yourself scarce ; so I apologised! for my intrusion and promised to call again to-morrow. > "i'Bnt what a strong smell of wine, aunt " I said. > . Don't you notice it Y II ," 'My servants have just broken a bottle or two,' she replied, looking rather embarrassed ' Good-bye, John shut the door after you.' ' ' , " ' Good-bye,' I said, and retraced my steps. j " As I went up those dark kitchen stairs, a sudden thought struck me. And yet it seemed so wild and absurd that I laughed at the idea. But, before I had reached the top, it had taken full possession of me, and I felt cold and pale with dread. I could not bear the uncertainty, and determined to ascertain, at any risk, if my suspicions were correct. Instead, therefore, of ' shutting the door from the outside, I 'shut it with a good bang from the inside- and waited scarcely breathing, at the top of the stairs. After a minute's listening, my ears caught a crash of glass, and then a rich gurgle of fluid that sent a thrill of horror through my heart. Another crash, another gurgle, and then another and another, and even that strange scent of wine stronger and stronger. It must be as I thought, so I crept like a cat down the stairs once more, and gently opened the kitchen door. No one was there, but I heard another crash and my aunt's voice exclaim, in a tone of exalted fervour, " * Glory-Alleluia-another ball taken from Satan's trap .' ' " I passed across the kitchen and looked through the door of the scullery, and there I saw my aunt and one of her red cheeked servant wenches busily engaged in knocking the necks off the cobwebbed bottles, and-oh, desecration '-pouring their priceless contents amid potato parings, soapsuds, and beastlinesses of that sort down the sink to gladden the hearts of the rats in the main sewer. " For a few moments, I was so taken aback I could not speak or move. It seemed like a ghastly dream. Yet it was real, and I could see an exalted look in my aunt's face, and as I heard her exclaim with each cruel decapitation, Another ball snatched from Satan '' I knew the poor woman was earnest in her conviction, and imagined she was doing right. As I looked at this strange scene, think- ing what course to taken an exclamation behind me made me turn, and' I saw in the kitchen the other red-cheeked servant girl, bearing on her muscular arm a bottle basket holding a dozen of wine she had evidently brought up from the cellar for the purpose of immolation. Ob, William Stagg, you must have turned in your grave ! If I had ever believed in ghosts, this work would have banished my belief, for if anything could have brought a ghost back to earth, the sacri- fice going on would have brought yours back. That basket contained the very particular, the joy of your heart, the wine that only came forth on the most important occasions, the very opening of which was a religious ceremony, and fervent prayers went up over each bottle that the cork may have withstood the ravages of years and the , wine be still sound ! And new" c , J "Even if the servant had not His covered me, I should have interfered then, SO I stepped boldly forwards into the scullery and confronted the heartless executioners. The servant,' looking sheepish and ashamed, put down the bottle, the neck of , which ', was just approaching the edge of the stone sink. My aunt, with the consciousness of rectitude, met my gaze firmly " ' Thank heaven I returned. 'I, said What does this mean ? ' ' , ", " ' Mean John Only thallium doing my duty.'
