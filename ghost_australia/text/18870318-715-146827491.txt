Murmuring " Charmed to see you back—liappy occasion!" she tripped past him. "Happy occasion, is it ?" said Dick to himself, wishing his gushing acquaintance and the rest oE the guests at the bottom of the sea. It would have been a happier occasion still if he could have found his; Dorothy alone in her amber-tinted s'ooin. ,Wheu Captain Irton. reached the! door, he could see Mrs. Lennox stand- \ ing in the midst o£ a small crowd of people, who all seemed to be talkiug at pnce. By Jove! how "fetching" she looked in her silver-grey gown, with a huge -bouquet of orchids, aa<3 i that gray;tulle sin had on her head ! Wats that a new fashion, Dick wou ler ed, [for women to wear bonnets at their,; .-opt, "at ..home ?"'. Arid there! Was that ass Shorthorn close beside her, With a paj-ticulai-iy fatuous" and" gloating 'expression on his face! It was high tluie he had written, Dick ;thought! it was high time he had come. Why, the fellow was far gone —gone head over ears; Dick could see!that by the way he appropriated Sirs. Lennox with his eyes. Then one of the circie moved away, and Dorothy turned and saw Captain Irton at the door. She looked as if she had seeu a ghost. Coming for ward, he took her hand, and he saw that something was wrong. Without a word, she motioned him into aa adj&ining; room, which for the moment, was empty. "Good God!" she whispered, " why have you come now ? I wired that you were not to come, that it was too late. I wrote, too, but you cannot have got my letter." " Too late, Dorothy! what do you mean? Your telegram said, " Do not come too late.* Well, I staited the next day.' " Poor Dick," she said at last, " what a dreadful mistake you have made. " Do not come. Too late,' was the message I sent. Did you not remember that there are no full -stops in telegraphy.? I was married an: hoar ago to Lord Shorthorn. Come ju, and let me introduce you to my husband." And this was Dick Irtou's little mis take. There are no full-stops in tele graphy, but when, ten minutes later, Dick saw Lord and Lady Shorthorn drive off amidst showers of rice and slippers he knew that he had had a moral full-stop which he would remem ber all his life.
