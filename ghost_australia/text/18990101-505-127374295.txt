They ha^e a deal: to ,do^ and tMey like doing it; but the man ha§ nothing to 'do except to swear arid suffer. There is no place where he can escape fi'tim the: distraction and riot cither, for he has no. sooner settled down, in one corner with comparative. tom- forf rthan he is. requested ' to 'movie . 'to another, and -this-- annoyance is finally capped by his. superior, hplf^s testy query: 'Why can't- yoij' sit 'otitfin. the yard-.^nd read something?''* 'Certainly,' replies her alleged Icrd and master, =with a fine tinge of sarcasm.

In- time- you meet with something that can -.be made to suit-.i-ibut- ? it ;is': only then: that your troubles begin in dead earnest. -Ja-taking possession of a new house igno rance c.? its history is often bliss indeed. Many houses, fair to vierw outside, have been the scenes of terrible tragedies inside:, not' to speak of the - countless tales of struggles against, poverty, of defeated hopes, and of bitter recriminations between those who had linked their lots for ever until death (or the ..Divorce Court) , doth part. There is a skeleton in every house, but that, of course, comprises, part of the movables, and is taken ;'off by; the owners. After a deal Of trouble a friend of mine once secured a house that suited him in _eyery way, and, meeting an acquaintance, he' 'old him of his good fortune. 'Oh!' exclaimed the latter, innocently: ' 'I know that place well. It's the house where the tailor murdered his wife. You must re aiember the case; he cut her head off witn a razor, and people say the blood stains on the floor can't be wiped out. He did it '.in the front room upstairs, and then took the body down te the kitchen , and tried to burn it, but he was caught and hanged. Barring that, however, it's a real a ice house.' 'Good Heavens !' said the other, 'that's the room I have just had my bed put up in.' He forfeited a week's rent arid' had' his furniture out again before dark, after while he remained in .lodgings until he was able to build a brand new house of his own, on^i!L.w.biGfe no ghost, .would have., any authority to enter. j ; ticCv {: . * * _r' After a month or t«0 of house hunting a man gets used to jit in a tired, helpless sort of way, and will- follow his wife to the four corners of the earth, if necessary, and they can be reached . by 'bus or tram, and experience a morbid 'delight in mooning round empty, musty rooms, climbing more ?or less . dilapidated' stairs', and ?ins'pedtinig'J 'large yards,' which he can generally cover in three strides. The, fatal morn ar rives, however, when his wife breaks the glad tidings to him that something decisive Is about to be done. He is getting through . the morning paper and his breakfast when his spouse says,- in a firm, business-like way: 'My dear, I want youTt'o. do a-.sm&Il; favor before you go to business this morn ing.' 'What's that?' asks, the dqo^ied^ man. 'Oh; nothing much-,, only -t'wigh ?y&u;:' would help Lizzie to mdye the-piano .out^ into the hall, and to ' get : those; big,, heavy,' bookcases arid that great couch- carried - into the back yard. Then you miggt.-Ja'^lp't'osSet the carpets out on th^ line, so tha't'-ybu can beat them well when you come home. And perhaps you had better take down those iarge pictures on the sitting reom walls, for they want a good .dusting, too. The carpet is the maifa thirig,' so. you. 'better get, home as early as you can, and — well, I declare, if that man didn't clear out Ihe moment -Ivwent;- into, the -kitchen*, to tell Li_zzie he was ready to help her now. Ask hiia to do any little' things about -the house an& he;ll fly off faster, than if %he taxman was after him. , I never saw anything like itjip all my life.'.. . r . - ' « ~. ? ? ? -. 'Commenting on. carpet-beating, a man. ot bitter experience says, there .is,-orie thing on, which a husband and :wife; never .cjin and 'never v/ill agree; and that is what con stitutes a well-beaten carpet. When the article is clcari, it- is a man's impression that it, should be reirioyed, . and he be; al-, lowed to Wash, ana quietly retire on, his laurels. But a woman'3 appetite for carpet beating is never appeased while a man has? a whole muscle in his body, and if he wait ed, until she voluntarily gave the signal to stop he might pound away until he dropped dov/n dead. It is dircctly owing to man's superior strength of mind that the civilised wo'rld 'is not a widow this day. . * ♦ * * * * The same gifted authority further states that the first Sunday spent by a man in a new house is a day to be remembered by 'him even if die' lives.:for 1500 year's. There is -an ..entire'-, absence' of-all old landmarks; when ho 'gbes to where ho thinks the wash stand is, he .bumps up against a chest of drawers, and ; when he'' really -wants the 'drawers . he dives into a stack of woman's fixings dangling .hcbind^a door. When he wants a clean ?shirt he has to search round for half an 'hcirr 'f)!r so, and then he is told it is in cine of the bureau , drawers which are piled . one ? upon another in the parlor, and- he h^ .tQ.xeinove about half a ton or carpets hid feather beds before he can burrow :do:-vn; to ' the drawer. ^ Then he ^nds that;h'i .has.;'biieii pla'ccd oil a wrong scent,' and his jflustered wife suddenly remembers ;tliat., the desired garment is in one, of the ?casks-^— the .one in the shed, she thinks, al though it may be the.'one in the attic, and fyet'il woifld have been- just like that stupid vanman 'if 'lie had humped it down ths cel lar. : -The- man says nothing, but appears to be doing' a deal of very hard thinking, and he resolves to explore the fir3t cask he comes to. ?a » - * « Armed with a chisel;. and hammer, the man begins. to dig, and ',tli'e result is stu pendously surprising. He has never seen anything like it since the excavations were' nrst made at Pompeii and Karnak. A bed quilt cernes out first, and with it half a dozen tumblers and a- couple of lamp globes,' ail of which go to pieces on the floor. The woman lets off a hysterical shriek, .aridra3ks:'.='Why ever can't you use a little' cafe?' And. the man, with a dry senEe of humor, such as that occasioually found in pantomime libretto writers., re plies': 'M; dear, I .am-Teally using as 'little care as ever I. possibly can.' . Another -.live into the magic cask and out comes .a red flannel petticoat and a ham, the latter being very carefully wrapped in the man's faVorite vest, and then up conies a pie dish, two or three towels, half a loaf of bread, a. pair of mildewed boots, a couple of Scriptural ? pictures, and., a book of Tivoli songs. -Just here. the man pauses, and en deavors to make a mental guess at what he will, unearth yet. He has a hazy notion that he may yet comc across some traces of -Leichhardt; wr-a few of the multitudi nous' Six Hundred Who fell during the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava. *. * ?- * * Another dive brings forth a choice and variegated assortment of stockings, . all knotted together, in some mysterious man-, iner, 4- lot of half-emptied medicine bottler,. ;and a- couple Cf illustrated almanacs dated foiir'or five yca'rs'bcfbre. ' At this stage the cask, itself, puis in a. claim for consideration By peeling' off half a shirt sleeve and en graving, a fine, red.- line: on the man s arm, from his elbow to ; his wrist. Evidently the cooper who. built that cask was called away before he had time to clinch the nails, and so the explorer grips his .hammer savagely 'as \it 'he' half . -expected to ; see him ' and ret 'in -^'Stirti'cii :.hea!vyv expostulations. Nothiiig;'cf the. kirid; ocbtirs, of course, and so thfe\i.man yeiifffta-his^wife. to repack the cask again while lie- starts-, after .something easier/ itoHfind than his ' Sunday shirt. .And so tlig^ -''d'feiary,- weary^ day- di-.a^ ajprig, until night-falls ^rid ;{he.;-raoon ' looks through the windo^'tod vlj&uclicg; istj' with a clow' of burnished silver a heap ' of tinware, half a dozen old chairs, and several barrels with bed quilts foaming over the tops. There may .be^-.pleasanter^Xo^ms of death than .being '^jlllpd ;;o£': a.' .'gridiron, or soaked in iboilflig pil/ibut .house hunting cannot be classed up'6ri the lisL. ?
