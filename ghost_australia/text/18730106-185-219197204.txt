THE MAGDALA COMPANY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR. —Yours, &c.;, Y OUR OCCASIIONAL CORRESPONEDENT. Stawell, 2nd January. SIR, —A letter from a "Melbourne Shareholder ” has drawn out from a shell a kernel, I had almost determined should never again see the light. You may recollect that I wrote you another letter on the same subject, giving, “ simply,” my ideas; you, not deeming them correct, very properly did not give it a place in your columns, and I, as you will now admit, very properly delined to write further. I now simply have to state that I will stake my reputation—what ever it may., be worth—that the Magdala Company have passed the Flat Reef.eight months ago, as I then said, and that it was the height of folly not to test it. It is sixteen yean since I first worked the same lode, and our results were ounces to. the ton in one part of our claim, now known as the Crown Cross Reef, and not the ghost of a speck in others. It was always patchy, and the talk 'of ho footwall, &c.;, is simply bosh, as sometimes we had a .smooth face, and other times not. - :A “ Melbourne Shareholder”: can now r takea prophecy l if-he likes. If -they open the' flat reef thoroughly wliere they have passed : it, it will pay. If they drive in to the east at their lowest depth, they have every chance of getting the Mariners and Sloanes Reef; but if they-keep on their present course of con duct, dheir portraits ought to be handed down to posterity as worthy progenitors of the most persever ing men Victoria ever saw; but I must Tegret I cannot add “sensible” to the sentence.'
