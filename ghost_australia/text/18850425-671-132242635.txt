STOPPING A PANIC. Six or. eight congenial spirits sat around a stove in a grocery out ' West- one night, and, after several other sub- , jects lia-l been. exhau- ted, some one in troduced that of panics in churches, theatres, and halls. This gave Mr. Hopewell a chance to remark, ' Gentle men, I just long to be there.' i Where ?' ' Why, in one of those panics. Yes, sir, I'd give » new twenty dollar bill to be in the theatre one night ?when there was an occasion for a panic.' «' Why ?' ' Why ? Because one cool level-headed man could stop the thing as easily as yov could end up that barr«l of flour. ' ' Well, I dunno about that,' observed one of the sitters. ' There is something awful in the cry of ' Fire,' and, hear it where and when you may, it startles and frightens. What would you do in ; a theatre in case of ' Fire ' and * rush ?' ' I'd stand upon my seat; pull a revolver from my pocket, and shout out that I'd shoot the first man who attempted, to crowd or rush. One cool man would' cheek the p#njp in ton seconds.' While the subject was being continued, the grower withdrew to the rear end of the vtp re,' puured a little powder on a board., and gave three or four men the wink. Presently there was a bright flash, yells of ' Fire 1'' and ' Powder !' and every man sprang up and rushed out. Hopewell did not spring up and talk of shooting. On the contrary, he fell over a lot of baskets piled between him and the door, got up to plough his way over a rack of brooms, and when he reachcd tho street he was on all-fours, white as a ghost, and so frightened thaft he never looked back until ha reached the opposite side of tli'e - thoroughfare.
