TILE HOUSES OPPOSITE. Br Vaumes. It is only when I look across this silent suburban street at the houses over the way that the fact of God having made the country white man made the town comes home to me Man's handiwork in aggressively apparent in every roof, window, and front of them Their align- ment and sizing are on the plan of a militia regiment mar 'rug before the Queen at Aldershot The Guards, say, have just gone by m companies of equal stature and superb, roothnearit/ A portion of the Rifle Bngadomny have passed with, perhaps, a few lines corps fairly dressed It is the militia's turn And as her Majesty looks from her carriage at the series of boomer inga wobbling by her thoughts must be somewhat similar to mine as I look at those houses opposite and reflect " who aligned, Hized, built them? Who permitted that little chap in the centre to encroach a couple of foot on the footpath, and above dormer windows through every square yard of roof ? Who induced tlioBO grenadiers at the flanks to step short and permit the wee follows in the middle to put on airs by bringing into the roadway and flaunting centre verandahs and meretricious fronts in the faces of inoffensive wayfarers ?" It must not be supposed that ours is a low street where the four are occupants haggle, high and shrill, with Chinese law here in the forenoon, and exchange confidences through fences during the balance of the day On the contrary, it is what might he termed a roomy thoroughfare and but for the fears hardness of some dwellings, which necessitates the backwardness of others, it might almost be of died genteel Not that it is genteel right through -thoroughfares, like cupboards, have their skele- tons-but ord) m portions To find a street ro spectable from end to end one has to go to Paris or Petersburg, where the municipal powers are arbitrary Every second house in this block of it, even those lastingly abnormal edifices opposite, has its piano, verandah, balcony, small grass plot, and venetian blinds But humidor domiciles have found a place among their betters, and saucily hold their own Everything about these humbler premises in offensively unconventional The roofs are of corrugated iron as diversified with patches as Don Caesar's double in the opera, the fences of broaches, with here and there a paling standing as a mute token of time's relentless march, and the blinds of calico with interstices which permit the air to come in while enabling the tenants to look out without being observed The children, too, who apparently belong to those ostentatiously unkempt dwellings, have a general air of half-dressed, irrelevancy in keeping with their habitations, and appear to revel in incongruous apparel As the lower animals conform in colour to their sur- roundings-the lion assuming the sombre tone of the desert, the tiger the variegated shaping of the jungle, and the polar bear the bright hue of the snowfields he traverses bo children come in time to resemble in some particulars the houses they inhabit Thus by a little practice an observant person can tell by a lad's boots whether the front gate of his dwelling is off the hinges, while a casual look at his cap or snr ill- clothed is fair circumstantial evidence as to whether the back fence is down or the rain comes in through an opening over the kitchen stove There is little doubt that the children of the poor, so long as they got abundance of food, have much to be thankful for Children are always at their happiest when permitted to make a partial return to a state of nature by leaving most of their clothing at home There is something intrinsically sad in the wistful aspect of a well-rooted, bleached, and loved bairn as he stands about the distance of a bow shot from a pool through whose shallow depths a number of sun browned, bare-footed lads are clamorously wading I was about to take up, follow, and reflect upon this matter of clothes and their effect upon mankind, but abandoned the subject on hearing that a meddling person named Carlyle had been before me and had reaped the field so carefully that it was useless to follow him for the sake of of the gleanings The greatest mistake a writer can make is to permit himself to be born into the world so late in the day that all the subjects worth pondering on have been viewed in every possible aspect by those who went before There will soon be no subjects left in either literature or politics In the former they will be exhausted, while, as for politics, the onward march of Democracy will shortly change subjects into citizens as in France and America Truly, the scribblers that were born during the world's morning, when everything was fresh and green from Nature's hand, have reason to be grateful OF 1 Fountain Arethusa The joy of finding oneself in a world where no one had as yet written of the moon, the setting sun, the cloud, or the sky lack-where the mountain daisy, the thunderstorm, the rainbow, and the twilight were still unsung ! How you could not in accents metres with no fear of plagiarising, and no sour centre to scoffingly allude to the blighting fact that the same theme had been handled better a hundred generations before It may be said that the luck pipes and the daisy lifts its woo head for us as for Horses or Shelley or Burns No doubt, but who will undertake to sing thom so- who will enter the lists against such competitors ? Even the few subjects grudgingly afforded by unromantic Australia-the bush, the lyrebird, the wattle and the gum tree have been long since appropriated and presented in every variety of versification Therefore, lads and losses, if you are of an intellectual cast and would fain be the first to explore new worlds, It is to science you had better turn In art, in music, and in poesy nearly all the ground has been covered by persons some of whom wore dead centuries before you were born But so long as this old world continues to twist round itself and the sun, there will always remain fresh fields to be discovered or surveyed in Nature's boundless domain-fresh shells to be had for the search along the strand of Truth's illimitable ocean This brings me back to the houses opposite Their chief productions seem to be children and horseshoes The former gambol in front, while the latter are nailed to the verandahs, and do duty as mascotte How it comes that a cast horseshoe bringing luck to those finding and fixing it above their doors is buried in mystery Not that it can always be depended on, for, if it could, the people over the way would be rolling in riches, judging by the assortment of the articles attached to the facades Every variety of footwear, from the dainty sandal of the Shetland pony to the log of the cart-horse, claims a place, and has its charms allowed That the theories of Malthus are either unknown or unheeded among the lodgers is pretty clear from the cataracts of urchins that come surging through the halls and tumbling down the steps when the neighbouring fire-bell rings Nothing so fires a child's imagination as a good blaze The lad that grumbles at being sent on a message for milk will gladly spend a day chopping wood for a bonfire Unfortunately the houses' back yards are out of sight, so that it is necessary to gauge the characters of the inmates by what goes on in front This, of course, is an imperfect and unsatisfactory method, for a dwelling is like a man-to know it thoroughly you must viewed from different standpoints That is why detectives become so knowing and so cynical After watching front doors for a time they find their conclusions completely upset by taking a turn at the back Then they become sceptical of appearances Come to think of it, it's more difficult to watch a house properly than to build it Mon can be brought up to do the latter, but the other comes by nature, and can no more be taught than music to a deaf and dumb asylum Bailiffs, also, who take a becoming pride in their profession, have rare opportunities for getting an insight into human nature The air of guilenessness, in which these people can wrap themselves as in a mantle when there is a delicate mission on hand, is worthy of the most generous recognition About 7 pm, when the sires have returned from the city and whole families come to the front to promote digestion and enjoy the evening air, is the best time to see the residents Unlike those in the small Terrace a little distant, who sit and smoke on the thresholds in their shirt-sleeves, they appear in walking dress, while the youngsters Foyster in knickerbockers and neat jackets A little practice in houses enables you to say with considerable certainty how the muster will come to the front for his summer evening smoke whether with a coat and hat, or innocent of both The same with the females With the hall-door, the knob, and the knocker to go by, it is possible to say if the girls will appear on the balcony with fringes, or with hair tied in a queue by a bow of blue ribbon Another good method of prognosticating how the occupants will appear in front on Sunday and during those evenings is by hearkening to the conversation of any parrots, magpies, or ravens that may be hung outside. If those percipient creatures confine their confidences to " you're a bad boy " or " " walk along, John," every woman may be looked for in a new print dress with lace trimmings and a rose in her zone, while every now and have a neat black tie and flower in his buttonhole On Sundays all the household will be observed proceeding to church or Sunday school.

The story, like most of Its land, should be received with caution The tents. kept his own counsel, so that when he moved from the premises the neighbours were not above circulating a report that the carriage folk had made a mistake and drive into the wrong street But it is beyond question, that a mounted orderly from Government House once knocked at one of the doors Wk a large letter There were not w unting ill-natured people, to deny this also, but the evidence was too clear, as the trooper was seen talking to a policeman at the corner a few minutes before, and the constable, when questioned, declared that the latter was a genuine invitation For sometime subsequently the dwelling, in envy, redoubt, was known as the " Vice-regal Lodge, " nVamowklch. only faded, and finally disappeared, when the tenant died I'io mentioned the pi ask but the music as a rule is not of an entry ching character. It usually consists of old Jacobite airs such as the " White Cockade" or " Wue's me for Carrie," which had u moaning and a pathos after he will rising of '45 and the fatal affair, of Culloden, hut which have lost much of that meaning of the House of Brunswick is so firmly seated . the Stuarts' throne. Whose blood over surges those days at-? Up an' inn away, Hawley, Up an' au awa', Hawley, Take care, or Charlie s stud carmen. Will give your legs a claw, Hawley ? Yet, there was a time when such uncouth rhymes did more to keep the Stuart memory alive thanks songs of stranger to put life into the water Napoleonic legend And the wonder of it is that not one of the family, from the slobbering Jan. I to his grandson the morbid bigot James H was worth the life of a Highland clansman, Nothing has a greater tendency to make a person despise his kind than the thought of the creatures for whose Bakes brave men risked and lost their lives On calm nights when the sky is clear and the moon riding high it is almost possible to consider one of the untenanted houses opposite to be haunted It is squat, a little out of the perpendicular, and lonesome looking Through the large tree at the back the moon's rays struggle to reach the earth, but seldom succeed One night when a ray succeeded in finding a small opening and reaching the ground, like a sheet of paper or a white pocket-handkerchief, it was curious to watch the efforts of the half-witted and partially-paid old lady next door to slyly lift it from the footpath and put it in her pocket "It is but moonshine, poor body, I was about to shout to her, tall, checked by the remembrance that in the journey of life we all follow moonshine m youth, manhood, and old ago-follow it, and feel indignant with those who suggest we are but making fools of ourselves It was on this particular night the thought obtruded that the lonely house might be haunted, and the old lady the tutelary ghost But the thought faded as soon as formed The idea of a haunted Australian house is too grotesque too long entertained It is questionable if any shade, familiar, sprite, bogie, or fairy over crossed the equator At any rate, none ever found its way to Australia Fisher's ghost, to be sure, did its boat to establish a reputation Uli careful investigation knocked the immaterial stuffing out of it Spirits do not take kindly to of places, which may be one reason why theosophy has found such as un- stable footing in this matter of- fact Southern land.
