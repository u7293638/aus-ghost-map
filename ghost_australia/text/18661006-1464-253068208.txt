Wanted a Subject— Address, stating Terms, &c.; What can I send to you, Punch, I pray, To make up a column of fun to-day ! Like Byron in want of a hero I'm Hard up for a subject whereon to rhyme. I've racked my brains, but it will not do. I ve hunted the newspapers through and through. I can't even find out an ungrammat- Ical advertisement to poke fun at. Ive walked the streets both night and morn, Till feet are weary and boots are worn ; For it were possible I by a mere Chance might pick up with a new idea, But no, at this horribly slow dull time There's nothing to twist into prose or rhyme. Every day the very same faces Every day in the self-same places, The same swell or two lounging up the Strand, The same old tunes on the German band ! And the only fiddler about the town Is the one that plays on it upside down. The same old fogey that cries ' ' pies hot " Every night at the same old spot ; In the same costume, and the same tone of voice, As if for another there was no choice. The same seedy loafers, the same police, Oh powers ! that this horrible sameness would cease. 'Tis true when one's got to the end of one's tether Of talk, one can always fall back on the weather, And shake one's head at the want of rain, Look solemn and shake one's head over again. No talk but shop, not the ghost of a pun, Not the shade of the shadow of any fun. Except of course at the temple of wit That every one knows of course is sit- Uated in George-street, not far from where The turning leads off into Wynyard-square. Oh ! I vow by the goddess of dread Ennui, (If god or goddess of such there be) If things go on as they're going now I'll get up a jolly great Fenian row. Become head centre, get sent-er gaol — (There's a try at a pun, but I knew 'twould fail) Till times are better, they can't be worse, And subjects are plenty for prose or verse.
