SPIRITUALISM IN SYDNEY. It was not in an auspicious moment for themselves tbat those privileged beings who recently, in Sydney, were supposed to bold converse with materialised spirits iavited Mr. T. Shekleton Henry to their seances. He appears, indeed, to have carried thither a pretty open mind on the euVjict, hut at the same time an eye which was still more open for imposture. It was Mr. Henry's happy chance to be present at that memorable test on Friday, October. 12, when the spirit of tbe child ' Ciseie" was revealed "wearing rgaln the garments.of the flaeh," or seemingly so. Suddenly grasped by the too sceptical Mr. Henry, she offered a further trial lor the constancy ol true believers by as suddenly resolving herself into the personality of the medium, Mrs. Mellon. The spirit which so resented the prying incredulity of Mr. Henry had, it will be remembered, previously suggested other Intricate problems as to the conditions unler which she had revisited the glimpses of the moon, or, rather, it should be said, of the lights in the partially-darkened room. This festive apparition had partaken of chocolate creams. "Can a ghost laugh V txclaimed CharleB Limb in one of his whimsical reveries. With more pertinency, the attendants at Mrs. Mellon's seances, while watching tbe chocolate performances of "Cissie," might have asked " Can a ghost digeBt ]' However, the results of Mr. Henry's search after knowledge as attainable in spiritualistic circles is duly eet down in a little book which he has just published. It is entitled "Spookland," and is issued by Gordon and Gjtcb. It contains very curious reading indeed. It still leaves thf question undecided as to whether what is now called spiritualiem may iÂ±ot be in reality the first discoveries ol some natural force. But it certainly goes far to ehow that at present the ranks of spiritualism must have a large percentage of brezsu impostors and a yet larger one of very silly dupes.
