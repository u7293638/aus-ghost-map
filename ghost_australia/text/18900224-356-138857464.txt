A LIVE CORPSE. A CERTII'IED corpse was being taken by two porters to the Paris morgue on a stretcher, on 2nd December, when it suddenly alarmed its carriers by sitting up and asking for .a drink. It was a worthy female, who, having got out of a train in the ~Montparnasso sta. tion, fell down on the platform and appa rently gave up the ghost. A reputed doctor who was near said that the woman's heart and pulse hd ceaised to beat, so she was ac cordingly sent by stretcher to the unlovely establishment in mid-Seine, where the dead bodies of city castaways are kept for dissec tion and burial. The woman awoke in the Pluce du Parvis de Notre Dame, and, in stead of taking liher to the direful destination for which she had been intended, .her Lind carriers marched her into the adjacent hos. pital-tho Hotel Dieu-whoro shle was in stalled temporarily in a warm ward, and received refreshments. She had been over fatigsied by a railway journey from Brest, and thie cold had brought on an attack of congestion of the brain.
