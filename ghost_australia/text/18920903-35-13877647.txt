LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT. I (CHRONICLED BY HENRY LUCY.) lonD SHEBnnoo-tE AND "Bon" LOWE-The. DOSE OF YORK COUSIN MAY-On DraE or Davoren's-, PAST, PRESENT, AND TO COME. WESTMINSTER, JULY 29. | Lord Sherbrooke, whose death was announced yesterday has long been an extinct v volcano If he had not married again, he would doubtless have disappeared from the political and social alone But the lady who begun by being Robert Lowe's secretary, and finished by being Lord Sherbrooke who, was not disposed to hide his fading light under a bushel With dauntless pertinacity once literally " took him out," leading him into quiet corners of crowded drawing room, or guiding him to his seat in the side gallery of the House of Lords In either aspect it was a pathetic eight to those who remembered "Robetown in his prime Last time I saw Lord Sherbrooke in society was in a drawing room an Arlington -street, the lions of the evening being the King of the Belgians and Sti they, then just home from his latest trip across Darkest Africa Lord Sherbrooke stood up with the rest as the lang walked post with the lady of the house on his arm, Stanley following after His, tall figure, crowned with a meek, white hood was plainly seen Doubtless if the king's attention had been drawn to him he would gladly have spoken to this relic at once supreme Parliamentary fame But there was no one to point him out, and when the loyal procession had passed, Lord Sherbrooke, at a signal from the peremptory lady who had him in charge, quietly resumed his seat Perhaps the of gladiator would have been better and happier at home The whole thing was sadly Uko Samson at the time when he was made a show of in the city of Gaza Not that there was anything of Dohlah about Lord Sherbrooke, but he, in his day an intellectual Samson, was now so woefully shorn of all his strength, and seemed so pitifully cut of place in this gay), bustling scene I wonder if there are any reminiscences of the young Oxford tutor, who, having just been called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, went out to New South Wales and carried all before him That was half a century ago But probably some are still living who remember the w white-haired, pink eyed youth with his hesitating deliver), his thin voice, his awkward gestures, and his brilliant piercing phrases Lowe brought back, from the new world some strong prejudices against democracy that lasted all his life, and did much to hamper his career He was over a fighting man, and from time to time crossed F words in the House of Commons with Disraeli, Bright, Gladstone, and the Englishman who was then known as Lord Robert Cecil In a recent letter apropos of Mr Goschen Budget speech I described the scene in the House of Commons when Lowe made his memorable and final breakdown in Parliamentary oratory He was only 70 when he left the Commons, an ago by no means incompatible with fresh triumphs in thonewsceuo But Robert Lowe died in the House of Commons, the Viscount Sherbrooke, who for a time blinked upon the House of Lords from a seat behind his old colleagues in the Liberal Ministry, being nothing more than a feeble ghost, wandering aimlessly among the memories of a brilliant past At first he was pretty constant in his attendance, and came to be reckoned by the Conaeri active whip as a safe vote in any contest with Liberal of on But as the years passed his blindness more ised, and he could not be trusted to find his vi ay in and out among the benches and through the du sion lobbies Then it was his faithful wife took him in hand, and on big nights brought him down to the House, sitting with him in the side gallery, whilst hooked on land Gooniod to follow the debate When the House was cleared for the division he was led downstairs, and handed 01 ei to the charge of a friendly Lord, who conducted him through the division lobby, after which he was taken home cheered by some dim sense that he had done fresh service to his country, once more helping to stem the tide of that democracy which had been the bugbear of his life, and which he had lived to see steadily advancing, falsifying all the fearsome prophecies with which he had attempted to stay its progress After long lull, rumours of matrimonial engagements for the Duke of York are revived It is now said hope to marry his cousin, Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein There may be no more truth in this than has been found to pertain to earlier reports , but there is no doubt that in family) councils the necessity of the direct heir to the throne marrying grows in urgency In the meanwhile poor Cousin May has completely retired into the background Cmdorollu has gone back to the kitchen Her name is never now mentioned radio Court Ciuii'ai She has once more become an inconsiderable per- son in the very minor household at the White Lodge Nothing came of the outburst of national regret and sympathy which proposed to itself to take practical shape in the presentation to the suddenly bereaved bride elect of the < costly presents prepared for her wedding day That is the kind of thing which if 'it. were done 'tw are well 'were done quickly The first impulse was restrained on ing to doubt as to how the movement would be received at Marlborough House Then the Lord Mayor shut out other agencies by announcing that he would see to it, and would on some convenient early day tall a meeting of intended donors at the Mansion House Thus the right moment dipped away, the Mansion House meeting was never held, the gifts were either taken back at due discount by the tradespeople from whom they had been ordered or utilised in the series of other and more fortunate brides, and Princess May is left alone with her sorrow The late Duke of Devonshire's will, just proved, discloses the not unsuspected fact that he was more than a millionaire The gross value of his personal estate exceeded Â£1,799,009, which, after provision made for other relative, is pretty. evenly divided between the Duke of Devonshire and his nephew and heir Mr A actor Cni ending This vast sum of money accrues lest, from land than from industrial enterprises The late Duke was an exceedingly shroud man of business , devoting much of his time to the personal direction of the enterprises in which he was concerned He created Barrow-in Turueea, now a thriving town u, with railway ay, docks, etc unship companies, and steel foundries In all these concerns the Duke of Devonshire was the largest shareholder, draw - mg princely revenues lins mine of wealth legitimately accrued to him just as other hard headed men w recent ducal titles make fortunes But in the South of England he came into a princely fortune by that process of unearned increment which vexed the soul of the Progi essionists on the London County Council Daily in the century a canny Cavendish bought a stretch of land on the Sussex coast It was chiefly wood land, with a few houses in a tiny village by the sea Long it lay, unremunerative, till some fashionable doctor discovered special health giving properties in the neighbourhood Well to-do patients were sent thither its fan o spread, a new street was built, and so glow the East- bourne of to day, one of the most popular and wealthiest watering places on the south coast Every inch of the ground belongs to the Duke of Devonshire, and as the limits of the town extend his rent roll increases, without the trouble of lift- ing a further except to sign a new season To-morrow, Mr Victor Cavendish is to be married to Lady Evelyn Fitzmaurice, daughter of the Marquis of Landsdowne I happened yesterday to meet her uncle, Lord Edmond 1 itzinaurito, Who mentioned that he was distraught between two engagements About the time the wedding bells would be coming for the bridal of his niece. his old chief, Lord Sherbrook, Will be laid to his last rest A grim conflict of duty this in which a man is called one way by the clang of marriage climes and in another direction by the tolling of the funeral both At present the young bridegroom stands next in succession for the historic position of the Dukedom of Devonshire with its princely revenues Only one con- tingency stands in the way, that is the marriage of the present Duke and the birth to him of an heir If the marriage never takes place society Will have to confess itself far out of its reckon- ing That the personage so long known as the Marquis of Hartington would, when opportunity offered, many the Duchess of Manchester, has long been accepted as a settled thing Her husband has been dead for more than two years now, and when the appointed time of mourning was passed the wedding was looked for as a matter of course It was explained at the time (though not by either of the parties most interested that the ceremony was postponed pending the life of the late Duke, an obstacle which in the course of nature could not long stand in the way Probably in due time the expected will take place , but it does not necessarily follow that the heir presumptive will be dislodged The present Duke of Devonshire is verging on his 60th year, and the Duchess of ilw.cli.aUir is at least, old enough to have been married 40 years ago It is a curious thing that in respect of two of the principal peerages the heritage threaten, to pass out of the direct line owing to failure of issue by the present poor. The other case is that of Earl Spencer, who, married 34 years ago, remains this day childless The next Dall of Spencer will be his half-brother, well known in the House of Commons as "Bobby," who sits for the county of Northampton and his during the existence of the late Parliament stn iigtlioucd Mr Gladstone's hand, an I advent ed the cr use of Liberalism by acting as junior Whip
