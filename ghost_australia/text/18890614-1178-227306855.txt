THE RUSSELL DIVORCE 4 A Seven Hours' Sitting. All About the Jury. Setting up tlie Co-responilents. — She cost them je3000— And Exs.— A Juryman Stood Out— The Whole Hog or None. The jury fn tho Russell divorco suit came into court aftor wo went to press lust even ing, having then been locked up for nearly seven hours. During tho time thoy made frequent attempts to arrive at a unanimous verdict, hut they failed to do so, because two of their number stood out for exem plary damages. Tho desires of ono juryman were ovcrcomo at length, and he threw himself in with tho general body (consisting of 10). but tho 12th iurvman. who seemed a bit of a bush lawyer, con tended that as £5000 damages were claimed no less amount could bo dealt with. On the jury coining finally into court at 6.10 p.m. Mr. Ralston, who saw what tho difficulty was, obtained leave from tho court to so amend Jfiio claim as to include any loss sum than £5000. And the jury, being hungry and slightly thirsty, seized hold of the brilliant idea, and forthwith fixed lip the damages at £1500 each against Hunt and Stevenson. So wo went out and wept over the Kiama ghost, and hoped ho won't walk any more.
