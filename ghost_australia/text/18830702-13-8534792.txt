SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. The second Bracelet Meeting held under the auspices of the V.AT.C, took place at Caulfield on Saturday. The weather was fine, and there was a good attendance, but not bo large as there ought to have been, con sidering the character of the sport that had been provided. The entries were good, and it was generally expected that over 40 horses would Bturt for the Ladies' Bracelet ; and this alone should have been sufficient to have drawn a much larger attendance. From a sportsman's point of vieVv, tíie meet ing was highly successful, and the receipts were large enough to insure a substantial Burplus for the club over and above ex penses. Ilia Excellency the Governor, accom panied by Lord Hervey Phipps, A.D.C., and Captain Lo Patourcl, private secretary, and a party of friends, drove his own four-in-hand from town to the course. In the arrange ments for the day, one or two innovations were noticeable. The first race was started ut 1 o'clock and the last at 4, intervals of three quarters of uii hour occurring between the several events. Visitors were thus able to see Hie whole of the racing and get back to town before dark. At previous meetings the concluding event usually took place very late ; but M r. Bond, the secretary, was not altogether a free agent in the matter, having to adapt his programme to the time-tables prepared by.the Railway de partment for the running of trains. On the present occasion there was no scarcity of rolling stock, and no dilliculty in running the trains at convenient hours. Another change which came under the observation of the public on Saturday did not appear to give general satisfaction. At all the gates placards were exhibited stating that no passes would be issued, consequently persons who wished to leave the enclosure between the races had to pay for re-admissiou. The holders of grand stand tickets were precluded from visiting other portions of the course. Doubtless the committee have good reasons for discon tinuing the issue of passes, which opens the door to many abuses. Those most incon venienced by the new regulation were per sons in charge of homes or vehicles, who on former occasions were in the habit of paying for admission to the fiat, and passing in and out at the gates immediately before and after each race. The racing opened with the Selling Race, fori which seven out uf the eleven on the card weighed out. Halifax and Queen Elizabeth were most fancied, and although they both f ....,..? ?...Il llu. fniliwl ,.v,.n tn imf.il iilnz-r. Once In the straight, the issue was left to Castaway and Nymph, and the former lusting the longer, he won by n length, Whisper being a good third. Ten horses started for the Hurdle Race, Triplet and Buzza having the call in the betting. Black Prince made the running for the first half-mile, when Miller took it up, and after about two-thirds of the journey had been traversed, Devilshoof went to tlie front, but only for a short time, as Mr. Inglis rode Buzza with great judgment, made his effort at the right time, and won rather comfortably by a length and a half from Triplet, who was two lengths in front of Miller. The Victoria Gold Cup was reduced to half-a-dozen, and this number was further reduced in the first round by Baronet coming down at the fence on the hill. It should be Btatcd, however, that Mr. T. Watson wits 121b. overweight, and that he rode without a saddle. Gold Top cut out the work at a fair pace for about half the distance, when Ab dullah assumed the lead, but he had quickly to give place to Black Jacket, who led for the rest of the distance and won easily. Abdallah being second, nnd Ycrlo third. The 2>i¿ce de reaMcmce of the meeting, the Ladies' Trophy was the next event,' and when the numbers went up it wits seen that 42 horses had weighed out. It is a great pity that four more had not faced the starter, as that would have mude the largest field of horses that ever started for a nice in the world. How ever, the number was very encouraging, and the course seemed to be fairly alive with horses us the preliminary canters were taken. When assembled at the post, tus might be ex pected, there was a good deal of trouble to get them in anything like a decent line. The start consequently was not a good one,Trans ferred getting away with a lead of three lengths ; Dukedom, Liddington, and Mumu luke also got away well. In the straight Liddington and Transferred seemed to have the race in hand, when The Ghost suddenly shot out from the ruck, and won by a couple of lengths, Liddington getting Becond place by a length from Transferred. The Gold Cup and the Ladies' 'Trophy were presented to the winners by His excellency the Gover nor. Thirteen horses started for the Steeple chase, and Vaulter was mode first favourite at 0 to 4. Gold To]) got away with the lead, which he maintained for more than a mile, when he dropped buck. Along the far side Vaulter took up the running, and looked nil over a winner ; but ' at the end of the carriage paddock General Jackson came with a rush and beat! the favourite by a length. Napoleon was a good third. Annexed arc the details uf the different events :? KKLUNU HACK, Of 50 SOVB. Tho wlnnur to bo Bold Tor .C100. Weights? 2 yrs, 8st.
