SLEEP. Throughout the day of labor, The striving and the pain, The duties done or just begun. The sunshine and the rain— There is a ghost that haunts me — A pillow soft and white, Its linen spread upon my bed All ready for the night. I know when day is ended, ■ Its tasks and duties done, And night comes down upon the town At setting of the sun, That, weary with the working, I then may gladly creep To where is spread my downy bed And lay me down to sleep. And so through all my lifetime, My little earthly day, It is not fear that’s ever near, Bat happiness alway. And, a- I climb life’s mountain, So rugged an-i so steep, No task I shirk, but sing nnd work, Since I so soon, may sleep !
