JOSH BILLCNGS OS BIBDS, The quail is a game bird, about one size bigger than the robin, and go sudden limit they ham when they fly. They have no song, but whistle for music; the tone is solitary and sad. They are short on the wing, and a nun tnav hg good in. arithmetic, fostrxte at nuEJug, and even be able to preach acceptably, but if he ami; studied quail on the wing he might as well shoot at a streak of lightening in tine sky as at a quail on the go. Bnled quail, properiy supported with jeHtyE and a Champagne Charlie, iz just ihe ^rn-^t difficult ithing) in. my hmnble opinion, tew beat inthe whole history or vitiles and I am no gourmand for I kan eat bread and joiQk five days out ov seven* and «mack my lipe after I get thru, bnt if I amaskedtoeat brfled quafl oy a friend, with jodishouB ac companyinent, I blush at fust, then smile sweet acquiescence — in other words, I always quail before such a request. The partridge zz aboa game bird. Their gaaatutew drtuoos & log in the spring ov the year and keep both eyes wide opean watching the sportsman.
