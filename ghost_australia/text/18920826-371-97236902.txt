MUDLA WIRRA SOUTH ELECTION p To thb Editob.— Sir.— Your oprrupon* ,. v- . dent— our late representative— has honored y me with a reply, although starting with tha .% assertion that ?' I am doubtful whether hf ' IS a ratepayer of Kangaroo Flat Warf'aV' all' Considering 1 have been one far ionftr* ?*- than your correspondent I oan affotd to 8mUeatone*e:disappftU»tbd,*for4ba*.-;ha is ,f disappointed in various wayil have feot W*' '? aliafotaat donht. far^'antiona anmk tonaW and he must tak? fear* be is *&fcairikd;' ? away by the exa&raooe; of Us fairs* ?? ? verbosity, as JjotA BsAconiAeldboeaeitaid. used in my letter.'1 I amjlad of that, as n\ , he bad used It it -won Id have been** decide* ' £ misnomer. , Heroes on to say '.'Any person with a grain 1of , ooinirion .' senw would jWfuitr, ! T - that If Mr. WcwrsU bafl resigned fa||NM^ j time there still wonld have had to be another election.' Hotr can be «xp«ot oommon sense in others when he hap got it all himself ? But if he reoolleots the wording of tbe information that I presume life' instructed his solicitor to israe, be will- ? remember it says. 'Whioh seat rightly belongs to the said John George Follaut,* or ??'? wordB to that effect ; but winning only half his case. I oan quite understand him in structing bis lawyer to publiely anert that he did not wish to be in the Council, knowing as he did that he hadn't the ghost of a chance. But to quote' htm still again; ' I say positively that there waa wine there, and that several electors had a drink, and some more than one drink. Whether this shad anything to do with the fact of. there being three informal votea of v total Ittf fifteen I cannot say.' Now, in the faos of such a positive assertion -would not anyone . „, expect that be, being- tfie plabttft;-;oouM: M have obtained some evidence to that effect I But in the absence of such, ooupled with snob a positive assertion, some people might reasonably imagine that be ia. that man whs knows all about it.

Not even nominated, and I am sure my fellow rate* payers can appreciate auoh pluck, but on* and all know the reason why.
