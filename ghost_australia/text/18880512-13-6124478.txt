REVIEWS THE AUSTRALIAN RACE. Tiunn Notice. The portion of Mr. Curr a work devoted to the diseases and decline of the Australian race is an important part certainly, but, as might be expected, it is melancholy reading As far as can be gathered the blacks were an exceedingly healthy people prior to the arrival of the whites and it is probable that their span of life was above the average of that of the English or the French On page 209, vol. I, we find the following. remarks - 'Kxperienceshowsthatapopulous town will kill out the tribes which live near enough to visit it daily in from two to ten years Lung and other diseases become prevalent, and births cease "In more sparsely settled country the process is somewhat different and more gradual, but it leads to the same end. in the bush many tribes have disappeared, and the rest are disappearing Towns destroy by drunkenness and debauchery, in the country from 15 to 25 per cent fall by the rifle , the tribe then submits and diseases of European origin complete the process of extermina- tion It has frequently been noticed that many natives bear the seven of small pox. Mr Curr is of opinion that it was introduced to the colony by the first convict ship, which arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788 Had it appeared amongst the natives in times prior to this its effects would have been noticed by Dampier in 1863 or by Cook in 1770, for both these navigators visited the spot where now the natives show most signs of the disease A number of extracts from various authorities are given, which show that the convict ship in question had some malignant disease on board, though in every case no specific name is given to it There can be scarcely a doubt, though some writers raise one, that the disease which attacked the blacks was smallpox "ft overran the whole of the continent south of the tropic of Capricorn, swept backwards and forwards over the area in question at least twice, and finally died out in 1846 or thereabouts Since 1815 the same disease has been introduced into the north western portion of the continent at least one, probably by the Malays, and committed great havoc, but there is nothing to show that it ever found a footing in the country north of the tropic of Capricorn, and east of longitude 18deg ' 'The most fatal disease at present afflicting the blacks is consumption, and this apparently was not known to them before the arrival of the whites. " It is to be regretted, remarks the author, "that the subject of the diseases generally of our aborigines, and the peculiarities of the constitutions, have heretofore failed to attract the attention of the gentlemen of the medical profession in these colonies that some competent persons have not made the whole matter a study " And he suggests, further on, that the subject might be studied to some extent in the Melbourne Hospital and on the aboriginal reserves On pages 235 to 211, vol I, is a criticism upon the works of former writers on the subject of which Mr Curr is a master In a note he gives a list of the most trustworthy writers on the blacks So far, our notice of this work has been confined to the first nine chapters of the first volume, in which has been treated the native race as a whole and these chapters bring us to the end of the last book The remaining four books comprised in this volume deal with various tribes in detail, the material for which has, to agrcatextent, been furnished by gentlemen residing in the localities of the different tribes 'to each of these Mr Curr has appended some prefatory remarks, and there is a great deal of most interesting information to be derived from a perusal of these accounts Volumes If and lil are compiled on a similar plan, and volume IV is a comparative vocabulary which should prove of great value to the philologist Accompanying it is the map to which we have more than once referred It is not bound into the volume, and is therefore made more accessible when required than otherwise would have been the case Book the second, vol I contains accounts of a few tribes scattered over the eastern half of the north coast of Australia Owing to the fact that a very small portion of this district is settled by the whites, very few specimens of the majority of the languages in use have been obtained The country occupied by the Larrakia tribe extends along the coast from the mouth of the Adelaide River west to Port Patterson, and stretches inland to a distance of 25 miles lines and neighbouring tribes are to some extent physically different to the common Australian type All told, they number about COO and the majority of the men are well built They have but little hair on their faces, but on the head it is invariably thick and curly The women, as a rule are not so stoutly built as those of the southern tribes The men do not wear clothes of any descrip- tion, but at night in addition to large brea, they cover themselves with paper bark They believe in a Being who dwells in the stars and never dies, also in a Good Spirit who dwells in the bowels of the earth 'Their idea as to the creation and the world of the future is given on pp 55 4 0 it is too long, unfortunately, to insert In this article. Mr 1 Foelsche, the contributor of the account of this tribe, gives the following interesting note on the subject of snake bite - Snake bite is treated by putting ligatures some distance above and below the wound and then opening the largest artery in the vicinity of the bite with a stone, shell, or other sharp instrument, several incisions are made until copious bleeding is the re suit the ligatures are not removed for two or three days, when the patient is all right I have never heard of a native dying of a snake bite 'He Limba Karndjee tribe (Port Essington) cure rheumatism by burying the sufferer in the and of the sea shore, the head alone remaining uncovered One of the beliefs of the Uralla tribe (Bales Hay) is that when the flesh of a dead man has decayed from the bones the deceased comes to life again, and goes into the bush, where he joins his previously departed 1 kinsfolk 'They then amuse themselves by playing wicked tricks on their living friends, especially annoying the aged people Book the third, vol I, p 247, "treats of the tribes which dwell on, or are adjacent to, the west coast of the continent, from a little north of the De Grey River to Albany " The women of the ISgurla tribe adorn themselves by affixing little pellets of gum to the locks of their hair Nets are made from the fibre of the spinifex (porcupine grass and food is frequently boiled in a couch shell, a mode of cooking very rarely practised in Australia.

A custom observed by these people is the horrible one of eating the fat of certain portions of their dead relatives The reason assigned for this practice is that by so doing the nearest relations may forget the departed, and not be continued) crying Mr Gason says " The order in which they partake of their dead relations is this " The mother east of her children "The children enter their mother " Brothers in law and sisters in law cat of each other Uncles, aunts, nephews nieces, grandchildren, grandfathers, and grandmothers eat of each other But the father does not eat of his oil spring "- the offspring of the acre.' The making of rain is one of their grandest ceremonies, and the custom has in it certain elements of poetry But the account is too long for quotation (See pp 00 7 S, vol ii, of Mr Curr work) The Arkaba tura tribe, 70 miles north of Port Augusta, state that they sprang from a number of individuals whose crimes had made them outcasts from their several tribes that they met at various times at the waters, and agreed to cast in their lot together YY hat a pleasant colony of scoundrels must they have been I An illustration of the old saying that Birds of a feather flock together The modes of fishing practised by the blacks are many, but here is one adopted by the Yorke's Peninsula tribe (west of Adelaide that is unique -"A good sized fish, being roasted and tied up in a bundle of rushes is fastened round the neck of a strong swimmer, so that it hangs down his back YY ith this he swims out to sea a mile or more, and then returns to the sandy beach, the roasted fish still hanging behind him When near the shore the swimmer attaches the fish to a spear stuck in the sand where the water is about 3ft. deep In the meantime the men have got ready their long nets, and the shoal of fish, as soon as it arrives on the scent of this drag is surrounded and taken ' (p 114, vol II ). In the Ringa-Ringsroo tribe, dwelling between the Georgina and Burke rivers, the star Venus is known as mxmangoona, or £117 eye- It is believed to be a fertile country, covered with Pippo, a sort of grass, the seeds of which are used by the natives on this earth for making cakes The star is inhabited by blacks, there is no water to be found there, but ropes hang from its surface to the earth, and by this means the Inhabitants visit our planet from time to time to assuage their thirst A big old man of great power is said to dwell in the star (p JAP, vol II ) It is curious to notice that several tribes, some of them separated by long stretches of intervening country, detest pork, and can- not he induced to eat it They do not give any reason for this, and as no pigS were known to exist on the continent before the arrival of the whites their objection to the flesh cannot have been a matter of tradition A form of duelling practised by the Ivabi tribe-Moreton Bay is both painful and protracted Two men, armed with sharp flints lock each other in their arms, and then proceed to score their adversary's back, They cut gashes in the flesh from the shoulders to the waist, and this continued until one cries "Hold, enough Among the Maryborough and some other tribes it is the custom to skin their men after death After the skin is dried it is carried from camp to camp for a considerable period, and is supposed to act as a charm against imaginary ills In volume III, p 170, will be found two corroborees set to music, and on page 17 is an account of a love letter sent by a man to woman It consisted of a twig upon which were cut three notches The control notch represented the carrier of the " letter' -the go between, and the remaining two, one the man, and the other the woman " It meant in the language of Dickens, ' Barkis is willing ' " The practice was well known, and appeared to be common " Message ntlcKs ' are in use in nearly every tribe They are a few inches in length, and in shape resemble a miniature boom mug Y'onous lines and notches are cut upon them. The messenger however, in variably gives his message by word of mouth, handing In the stick afterwards, so that it is difficult to arrive at the meaning or utility of the piece of wood, unless it be that it certifies an accredited messenger between two tribes When travelling to deliver a message, the life of the carrier is held cured!, and he is allowed to pass on his way unwatered and inspected From notes on the Gippsland tribe, supplied to the author by Mr Bulmer, wo cull the following tradition of a deluge - ' Ages ago there was no water in what are now the lakes, rivers, and seas known to the Kurnni, for an immense frog had swallowed up the whole it This state of things is appeals, was a source of great discomfort to the animals generally, and especially to the fishes, so they held a consultation on the subject and came to the conclusion that the only remedy was to make the frog laugh and that it this could be accomplished there would soon be plenty of water To give effect to this idea ever) animal presented himself before the frog in the most ludicrous postures he could assume, and went through his funniest antics. For a time, however, they were unsuccessful until the eel stood upon the tip of his tail, which so tickled the overgrown frog that he literally burst with laughing, and the water poured from him in such vast streams that there was presently a deluge, and all the blacks would have been drowned and not one of them, Loan by a line made a large canoe in which he lived 11 great many (p nil vol III ) Among the Marlborough blacks a belief exists which refers to rewards und puniBh ments 111 a future life "li the deceased has been a bad character, he is compelled to wander over rocky mountains until all his earthly friends are dead, and that with the Ing of them he is allowed to enter the spirit land is here 11 man of good character dies he is allowed to enter the happy hunting, (grounds at once, being first ferried our the sale river which bounds it by two young women in a bark canoe 0110 of whom subsequently become his wife ' (page Lib of vol 111 ). In writing upon the subject of ovens, paintings and sculptures, Mr Curr refers to 11 conjecture made by writers of recent date that higher race of men than the present blacks once inhabited this continent it is this view he does not agree, and believes that the blocks known to us were the only people by whom Australia was inhabited prior to the arrival of the whites The presence of a light coloured race amongst the tribes of the north west coast, of the sculptures and paintings in caves found by Sir George Grey, he thinks are to be attributed to the visits of Malaria In appendix A (vol III ) a short reference is made to the Taamunlans, based upon the authority of 11 little work by the late J E Calder Mr Curr points out that evidence leads to the conclusion that the Tasmanian must be traced direct to the negro without the intervention of the Australian But, he concludes, there is no evidence to show at what epoch the forefathers of the Tua manians reached this island, nor by what route they travelled But we must now draw our notice of this interesting work to a conclusion, and hope that the hasty sketch we have given of its principal features will lead those who may be interested in the study of the Australian race, not only to read the work for themselves, but to go out and add to our knowledge by practical observation Mr Curr expresses a fear that even ethnologists will wear) of his numerous vocabularies, and tables of comparisons of different languages But to no student worthy of the name is that portion of the work before us likely to prove irksome Numerous illustrations are to be found 111 vola 1 and li.
