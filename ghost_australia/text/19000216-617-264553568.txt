Eccentric Ghosts. A story was recently related by a correspondent of the "Realm" savoiirinq t.f the ghostly description ; but with the difference that his ghostship was ff It more than seen. The story, as related, is altogether a most extraordinary one. and runs as follows:â€”" A friend of mine was recently staying in a country house in Cheshire, where there are some or the largest and finest portrait", in England. One evening, tlndlns; himself unusually late for dinner, my friend proceeded to run down tlie central staircase, the walls of which were hung with large portraits. Suddenly two strong arms were laid on his shoulders and held him back. He turned round indignant, to find no one anywhere near. At that moment a llfe-atzed portrait two steps from where he stood fell with a crash to the ground, breaking the balustrade and the stair to atoms. Had he not been detained he would have been killed."
