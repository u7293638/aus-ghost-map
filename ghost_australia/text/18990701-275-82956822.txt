Then sho laughed slightly. 'You aro trying to tost mo, made moiselle-,' she said. 'Tho lotter and tho cheque aro written by tho sanio man. He is tall and dark, and wishes great harm to another man. It seems to mo that you love tho other niaoij so it is love after all that you ask me about. Wait a minute- j it is not clear yet.' Gloria stirred restlessly. Sho did not speak for fear of breaking tho spell. Could tlus bo true? It was what Lily had suggested — Maurice tiiffard had written out tho cheque himself, and forged Frank Manner's noino at the bade. He had dono this vile thing to force hor to marry him I v, ? The clairvoyant went on in her mono tonous voice — 'It grows clearer. This man forged tho cheque for an evil purpose, but not to obtain money. A woman is mixed up in it ; you aro tho womana. But all that lies in the past. Ho is no lon ger connected with your life. — but ho ia with tho other man's. It is very dim — very misty, Givo mo your hand.' Gloria held it out, and the woman grasped it. 'I cannot toll you much more,' she said, in a disappointal tone. 'This man you lovo seems to be in trouble; but you will 'help him — you will savo him!' She returned suddenly to her former manner. 'Have I helped you?' she asked abruptly. 'You have, indeed!' Gloria cried. 'I ennnot help believing you I' 'There is something else on yoiir mind,' the clairvoyant said, looking at her with knitted brows; 'you confuse tho two thiugs, and that makes it diffi cult for mo.

'It is the saane man,' sho said pre sently ; 'the same :two men.' \ Gloria could not repress a start. \ 'No, it is no use ; you confuso them in your mind,' tho woman said again.

Glowia's brain was in a whirl na she loft thl) bazaar and walked in the direc tion oil Sir Frank Grey's house. The could rlally read what Avas hidden from most mortals. It wais bo sinrpio, too; it seemed in credible] that sho should have believed tho millionaire's boro word. Frank had never owed him money, had never given him a ?elvuquo p|i;',S|y Frank's in pay ment. It.wf^'ft;Ij^fibaso fabrication, and,i:A JpW|^^/||-*^:heart was light wrtiiip! bWb^eivsk ?'..' it this cloud, which h^/aQQo'fe.i^n««V'to shadow her whole lifq .'vyitln impenetrable gloomi had cleared awl.\y, why not this other greater ono as ?wclu'i Sho dottlrmined to go to Sir Frank tion to heir soul. It seemed that she woman's whole manner carried convic .Grey, and! hoar hk wniirma,tion of I ..-♦—.- ? Frank's innocence, of Maurice Giffard's treachery. Ho was at home, and sho was sho\vn into a line, spacious room, while tho man took up her card, on which sho had scribbled a few words, begging him urgently to see her. A photograph or' Frank smiled at her from tne mantelpiece; one or two law pamphlets he. had written occupied a conspicuous place on the well-fdled bookshelves. Why had she not come sooner? sho asked herself. Sho had inado a great mistake, and caused herself and tho man she loved a great deal of unnecessary sorrow. If she had come to Sir Frank at once, instead of believing Mr. Gifi'ard, much pain might havo been spared them both — to him the thought that she wa3 heartless, to her the agony of doubt. Sir Frank Groy entered th© room and greeted iher kindly. Ho .was a white-haired, rosy-oheeked old man, with the kindest eye sh/J had ever seen in her life. She began to speak in a trembling voice, and asked a curious question. 'Do you know Mr. Giil'ard, Sir Frank?'' 'By 'repute, cei'tainly,Miss Tennant,' ho answered, with an astonished look. 'You will excuso me, but tho question is a strange ono, and as I have not the honor of knowing you ? ' He stopped, waiting for hor to spe-ak. But in her excitement she did not no tice it. 'Do you mean to say that you have nover seen him — never spoken to kirn?' sho asked. 'Never in my lifo. I am an old man, and I havo no taste for the society of young millionaires.' Sho held the chequo towards him, with trembling fingers. 'That is not yours, then — you' have never seen it before?' Ho took it in increasing wonder. 'What does this mean?' he exclaimed, 'I never signed this cheque.' He turn ed to tho back. , 'Why, it is endorsed by Frank Manners! What cioea it mean? How came it in your possession? Do you know Frank?' Suddenly he stop ped, and laughed slightly. 'Why, this is nonsense,' he r,aid. 'This is not oven a ehequo on my bank! Someono hns been fooled!' Indeed, someone had been fooled, and sho was tho someone. There was not the slightest foundation in the story. Ib was a trap for her, and she had fallen in blindly. Sho told him tho story, rapidly, con fusedly, not stopping to think whether ho would consider her unmaidonly to avow her love for Frank to a stranger. Ho listened sympathetically, his as tonishment growing every minute. 'Tho scoundrel !' ho exclaimed, when sho had finished. 'To terrify a girl with such a vile libel on an iiuiocont man, We must say nothing to the world on your account, Miss Tennant, but he shall hear of thia privately. I am glad you came to me—you aro a bravo girl. Frank is indeed lucky, despite his mis fortunes. But Ktay, tho poor boy's counsel is downstairs this moment. May I show him this chequo and tell him part of the story — it may be of use if he knows that Frank has an enemy same whoro ] I will say nothing that you will mind, my dear young lady.' 'Oh, tell him anything,' sho cried, ''if you think it will help.' 'Will you come downstairs with! me?' he asked. Sho followed him nervously. Mr. Raymond, a, tall, clever- looking man, roso as she entered tho room. 'Thia young lady, Raymond,' Sir Frank explained, 'is a friend of Frank's — in fact sho has done such a brave and loyal thing for his sake that sho deserves to be called his best friend.' He laid tho cheque and letter before tho eminent barrister. 'Look at this cheque,' ho said; 'it is an unscrupulous forgery, and was used to intimidato this young lady to pro mise to marry a scoundrel. Now, I know you aro a bit of an expert as well as a inna of the law, Should jou sax that the writer of tho letter forged tho cheque himself, or was it done for him ?' Mr. Raymond put on a pair of gold oye-glnasss and examined the cheque carefully ; then ho looked at tho first pago of tho letter. After a moment's intent scrutiny, he laid aside his glasses and said emphatically: 'Undoubtedly ho did it himself. It is very interesting. It throws a new light on tho case. I came to you for a friendly visit, But it seems, that profes sionally it ia an important ono, too. My client evidently has a powerful, enemy.' 'No Ies3 a person than Maurice Gif fard, the millionaire,' Sir Frank said, in explanation. 'Maurico Gift'ard— M.G.— that is curi ous,' the barrister exclaimed. He turned to tho second page of tho letter, on which was tho signature. 'Great heavens!' ho cried. 'Hero if is— the clue— at last!' He rose and paced the room in uncon trollable excitement, while the old man and the young girl watched him breath lessly. 'I have racked my brain for days and nights,' tho barrister went on, 'and nc'-v -t bas come by pure chance. Don't you see?' Ho turned to Sir Frank. 'Those' letters written to Lindon were wgned 'M.G.' I have oxamined them many a time. This letter is signed Maurice GilYard, but tho initials are the same; ho did not take tho trouble to dinguiso them. Then the piece of paper found on the desk, 'My murderer is my nftster.' It's as clear as- daylight.' There was a dead silence ; Sir Frank md Gloria were too amazed to speak. 'Great heavens!' the barrister burst out again. '-'Only a few link* an- wan ted in the chain, and I havo one o! liieni. Maurice Giffurd has chambers in Jmnyn strcct, next door to tho oftices. Wonder was expressed that he kept them on after ho removed to Park Lane. There must do a secret pas-iago, or something —there must have boon a i*oav between him and Lindon. Ho must have come in just as; Frank Manner?-, left the. offices, and gone back as ho came, through tho secret door. After the boy went out with tho police after Frank, Lindon niuot havo recovered consciousness enough to wr':to tho«o words. I believe wo°havo solved tho mystery at last, and through thia young lady.' . And so1 it proved. Tho matter was communicated to tho police at onco. Tho signature of the letter to Gloria Teimrmt and tho initials of the letters addressed to Mr. Lindon wevo. examined, and found to bo identi cal. But what lent moro likelihood toThe corrcctncar, of the ncwcluo than anything ?A:- :? wna the disappearance of Maurico Gifhird one night. It was supposed that ho had been warned. His. chambers in Jeriuyn-street were searched, and the secret passage discov ered communicating with the'offices of th - bogus Me.-wrc?. Salom caisson. On th'. lir.-Jt day no incriminating evidenco wits found in his chambers ; but on tho second a detective accidentally knocked down a c^all Japanese cabinet from its place against tho wall.
