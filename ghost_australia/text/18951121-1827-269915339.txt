It Pays to do it.—Speaking of newspaper advertising a man who has tried it says : " The newspaper is the commercial traveller in city, country, .and home, who tells at the fireside to its evening "circle the merits of your' wares and merchandise, if you are wise enough'to employ'it to speak for you. It never is . neglected, never goes unheeded, never speaks to inattentive or unwilling ears. It never bores. It uevisr tires. It is always a welcome visitor, and meets a cordial reception. It speaks when the" day is done, when cares vanish, when the mind, ati peace and rest, is in its most receptive mood." Then it is that the ^toi'y is told, ang. all wlip: read treasure wlvit.it says, and are influenced to go where it "directs for the thing of which it speaks."—Fourth Estate.

From this point of view we have always regarded' the'drunkard as the noblest of national benefactors and greatest mainstay of the constitution. Upon the highest grounds of imperial interests, then, we plead for the liberty of all Englishmen to get drunk as often as seems to them good. Their noble tliirst brings the Exchequer and the local rates even now a good £34,000,000 a year. Music on the "Waves.—A moonlight excursion by the s.s.
